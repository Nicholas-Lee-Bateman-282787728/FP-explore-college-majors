1211541,5,B00000FELL,"This is a great film. Granted the critics have some valid complaints. to be macedonian was for the most part of Ancient history not to be Greek, but then again the Athenians considered any tribe that did not live in a city state and was not a democracy barbarians. 'This meant the Spartans too in principle but because of their military brilliance they were accepted into the ideological class of Greekhood, this too was the case of Alexander and the macedonians in my opinion. No one can claim that Phillip was thought of as a Greek especially not by demosthenes but I think one has to accept that the great conquests made by Alexander together with greek soldiers made the tribes of this part of the world unite in the hellenic ideal at least for a time. As for the attack on Michael Wood for being self-loathing as a westerner i can only say it is right, but i think that political correctness has banned any video for appearing on the market at all does it not have the customary depreciation of any values connected to the West, Aestethics, or conservatism. All in all it is a good video though, one gets to see many of the famous places, as near as one can come, and hear stories that are still told to this from Pella to Persepolis.
I would say it is a very good production.",973555200,5,1281,4.409282700421941
1211542,1,B00000FELL,"Michael Woods appears to be a self-loathing European, who takes delight in disparaging his own cultural roots. In this video he uses legend, tall-tales, gossip and folklore to do it.
As others have pointed out, ""In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great"" contains some major historical inaccuracies, and some major ""heterophobic"" flapdoodle.
In his roll as propagandist-in-chief, Michael Woods seems never to have met a non-Westerner he didn't like; nor is he able to find much about Alexander to his liking -- except for the talk of Alex's male companion.
This is a ""feminine"" production. It is almost as though Mr. Woods is showing the audience his sorrow for having been born with a penis.
Those interested in the more manly, miliatry aspects of the General, his conquests, and his army should look elsewhere.",973382400,13,810,5.052238805970149
1211543,5,B00000FELL,"Michael Wood's epic journey in the footsteps of Alexander, was in short, incredible. Wood analyzes the main sources of Alexander: Arrian and Curtius, and gives us their point of view on Alexander. But it is the local  guides, peoples, and legends that Wood passes through that gives us the  tales behind the man who conquered much of the known world, and makes this  video worth seeing. I highly recommend this production for those who are  interested in Alexander the Great's career on a more psychological,  legendary, geographical level. It is not a hard core military analysis, but  dwelves into the mind, the life of the man who commanded the armies that  conquered the east. Though Wood gives us plenty of military insight, this  video is not recommended for those who search the commander rather than the  man in Alexander. Wood's role in this video is just mesmerizing. He is  non-biased, which is why he is able to provide us with accounts on  Alexander, that allows us to judge him for ourselves. If anything, In the  Footsteps of Alexander the Great is worth watching!",959558400,6,1079,4.836065573770492
1211544,3,B00000FELL,"Very interresting look at the geography of Alexander's expedition (it's a change from books).  The cultural view is good also.  But don't look for much historical facts. Legends, folklore and heresay are what you'll find  here.  Being a fan of military history, strategy and tactics... this was  not the best I've seen.",957398400,8,319,5.0576923076923075
1211545,5,B00000FELL,"Alexander the Great is known as one of the greatest conquerors of all time.  His lifetime achievements are even more extraordinary when one considers that he conquered the greater part of southern Europe, northern  Africa,the Middle East and Central Asia all by the time of his premature  death at 33.  To recreate this amazing feat, historian Michael Wood  retraces the steps of Alexander, along the way meeting with locals who keep  the legacy of Alexander alive through generations-old folk tales.  The  importance of the documentary is two-fold: retracing the conquests of  Alexander and a contemporary glimpse at modern life in these areas.  Besides the wealth of knowledge provided by Wood, his sheer exuberance  throughout the rough journey adds interest to the film.  Watching him  describe Alexander's exploits, I wanted to be right along side of Woods.  As a high school history teacher, as much as i enjoyed the documentary,  I wouldn't reccommend showing it in the classroom.  I think students  (especially freshmen) might be a bit bored with Woods' wealth of knowledge  and the lack of ""action"" scenes.  In the Footsteps of Alexander  the Great is definitely for the seasoned history buff, or for the person  who enjoys a little history lesson to go  along with travelling to exotic  locations.",955411200,16,1307,5.119047619047619
1211546,5,B00000FELL,"Michael Wood follows the footsteps of Alexander from his home country to his death in the Indian sub-continent. The journey examines not only the military achievements but gives insights into the man himself, as Mr Wood  points out, retracing the actual journey reveals much of Alexander's  character and what went towards making him such a fearful enemy and friend.  Still revered in the West and hated in the East, Alexander's achievements  are still staggering by twenty-first century standards. The series is well  presented and is still as captivating after several viewings. I simply  cannot recommend this title too highly, not only for history buffs but for  travellers and lovers of a good story alike.",952128000,11,711,5.184210526315789

1211586,5,B00000FELL,"""Courageous"" and ""thrilling"" are not often used in describing historians or historical documentaries, but Michael Wood makes the exception. Instead of using graphics or re-creations, Wood, as the title suggests, literally follows the path of the legendary Alexander and his army from Greece to India and back to Persia. Even today, it's a dangerous path. The former Afghan military escort him out of Kabul as the Taliban take over the city and he has to duck bandits' bullets in the mountain passes, for two examples. But, along the way, he gains and gives great insight into Alexander, his character, and his lasting legacy. From the Turks who viewed him as a conqueror and destroyer to an obscure tribe in Pakistan that claim they are Greek descendants of Alexander's army and still worship Greek-type gods, Wood's easy charm and catching enthusiasm draw legends and information from modern locals and historians and sweep you along on an adventure of discovery and insight that may top any of Indiana Jones' adventures.",1372550400,,1022,5.089285714285714

1211609,4,B00000FELL,"I'm enjoying this series greatly. I've only given it four stars because I think it needs more maps or graphic support to the story. Most of us are probably not as familiar with Alexander the Great as is our host in the series. That said, however, the vivid portayal of the people and their present ways of life along the journey are forcefully revealing. I don't think I've ever had a better or more piercing insight into the men of Afghanistan, even after all the years of Western reporting from the war there. That alone was worth watching everything else. Everything else, however, is equally revealing of the cultures described as as they are today millenia after Alexander's passage.

1211610,5,B00000FELL,"Few more curious figures exist in history then Alexander the Eccentric. He was a man of almost superhuman talent; and yet he did little with it other then to narcissistically demonstrate it over and over. His men loved him with the almost erotic fervor given to successful commanders in the past(a fervor that is hard to understand in our age when battlefields are to complicated to control by theatrical heroics). And yet Alexander, for years, couldn't be bothered to give his men the greatest gift in his power-simply letting them go home. His life was a true epic that was anomalous even in his own time. And yet it's sheer uselessness seems impossible to give credit to. That is of course looking at it from our point of view when we expect rulers to at least pretend that they are acting for the material benefit of their states. The fact is he achieved what he set out to do. There are rationalizations about his hidden motives but he said that he desired to take vengeance on Persia, gain glory, and prove himself a mighty warrior. And assuming hidden motives is not necessary; his actions are most easily interpreted by the assumption that these in fact were his primary goals. He did few actions that would indicate more then a passing desire to make new laws, patronize scholarship, found a civilization or the other things ""Great"" kings are supposed to do. When he did such things it was almost by accident. He set out to be a mighty warrior; and that at least he accomplished in spades.

Michael Wood sets out on his own epic following the march of Alexander's army as it set out on it's journey from Greece to India and back, a journey that is still uncomfortable and dangerous enough to be recognized by travellers of old. He passes the glorious cities on the Silk Road, and interviews storytellers, villagers, tribesmen, traders, and warriors, who have changed surprisingly little except for technology. He listens to Alexandrian legends along the way, as he shares in the hospitality of the locals. All this is done with splendid video footage, and gives a picture not just of Alexander but of a whole world that haunts our imaginations still.

Michael seems to show a hero-worship for Alexander that is almost like that of a Macedonian pikeman. Of course he is not blind to his faults; but then neither were all Macedonians. This is not surprising; Alexander did have a hypnotic personality, and did have the virtues that heroes of epics always have had. Alexander was not a hero in the modern sense which is inseparable from moral judgement. He was certainly a hero in the Ancient Greek sense; a powerful figure who inspires awe with his achievement, even if his achievements were barren and destructive. And yet the ironic fact is that Alexander for all his attractive qualities followed his journey in what was in essence a large scale act of banditry. Michael Wood followed this same journey-less hard but hard enough-to bring knowledge and pleasure to ordinary people who watch it. Perhaps it is he that is the more heroic of the two.",1351382400,,3056,4.742481203007519

Always driven by his own ambition and the need to live up to his father's legend, Alexander was never content.  Ever searching for the ""end of the earth"" in order to bring it all under his dominion he was locked in a continuous struggle with his own inner demons and balancing the need to motivate his army in the quest.

Wood and his crew are very adept at brining together both the physical landscapes of history and the possible mindset of the subjects himselves. Though history is seen through subjective goggles, Wood's vision feels clear, and the depictions are always based in logic and known fact, with the human touch sometimes lost in academic quarreling.

Could not finish the segment.

But we learn by seeing and doing as well as reading, and I found Woods ""In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great"" to be a great visual presentation of  what I just finished  reading about in another work, that is, Mary Renault's THE NATURE OF ALEXANDER.

1211638,5,B00000FELL,"They didn't give him the epithet `the Great' for staying at home tending his olive farm. In this excellently shot and actually quite fun documentary British historian Michael Wood takes the viewer through a massive journey starting in Macedonia through a myriad of modern nations such as Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Afghanistan and India and somehow manages to meld the entire thing into a coherent whole. With extensive use of ancient sources and by humanising the story by focussing on the character of the main players - Alexander above all - Wood makes this double video spanning 238 minutes seem much shorter than it really is because the viewer is bombarded not only with snippets of facts but also by the actual vastness of the geographical area in question.

Of course there weren't exactly CNN film crews embedded with the units of Alexanders army back in the day so there remains a certain amount of conjecture about many of the thoughts of Alexander himself. After all fate did not bestow upon him an old age wherein he may have set down his memoirs (as it were). But Wood is quite skilful in trying to put himself into the shoes of Alexander and those who followed him and what I quite enjoyed was his total desire to explore not just the factual aspects but also the myths and legends that have grown up around one of the worlds greatest conquerors. And he doesn't just stop at written accounts but also speaks to locals about stories that have been passed down innumerable generations to the present day about the man.

An excellent primer for sure. In fact IMHO this will probably contain everything most people would ever want to know about Alexander. On the other hand it inspired me to further my research and I ended up buying Michael Woods accompanying book as well as a couple of the ancient texts he so openly uses during his journey.

In terms of enjoyment this is probably my favourite work by Wood and it's a credit not only to him but everyone else who worked on putting this together from top to bottom.",1267660800,,2023,4.645251396648045

If you are looking at this item online now then you are probably that rare minority of humans who are history buffs and are interested in learning more about Alexander the Great. I want to HIGHLY recommend this DVD/VCR set to you. I would go even farther and say this is a ""must buy"" situation. Michael Wood in a very likable British manner takes us on a informative and what is even more amazing an ENTERTAINING journey through history. You see folks...some things cannot be learned or experienced through books. A visual experience of the lands and peoples that are connected with the Alexander story is an absolute must if we are to understand the spirit behind the times. But who has the money to travel like that? Not me. So it is PBS and Michael Wood to the rescue!

The various countries and landscapes experienced in this docu-drama make this video set an education in itself. I will not go into detail of what exactly is in this 4 part film as some of the other reviewers below have done a much better job of that, but let it be known that I have watched my set of tapes at least 15-20 times! There is so much packed into these episodes they never get dull reviewing them time and again.

Some of the places are not safe ,and very treacherous. I did go however to many places that he conquered,up to Pakistan and India.

I do not think that this is a waist of money in purchasing this DVD, on the contrary, riding on donkeys sometimes are the only way to go.

In my lifetime I have been to 49 countries,and I understand how Mr. Wood had to travel, it is not fair to judge his ways, without realy having been in some of these places.",1129939200,4,600,4.163793103448276
1211644,4,B00000FELL,"This is a superb presentation which has, nevertheless, some flaws. Segment one, which tells the story of Alexander's youth and the launch of the great expedition, gives due credit to Alexander's father, Philip II, as strategist and politician, but fails to mention that Philip planned the expedition to conquer Persia, raised an army and its supply lines and had a route mapped out. He was murdered just before he was due to leave Macedonia. Alexander was able to move so quickly because the work had been already prepared by Philip. Wood gives the impression that Persia was Alexander's idea. Wood also fails to emphasise enough Alexander's rivalry with Philip. A brilliant and commanding personality, Alexander spent his youth being eclipsed by his father's achievements, and it made him furious to excel Philip. This rivalry was cultivated by his mother Olympias, who had been set aside by Philip and would not accept it. The murder of Philip was most likely organised by Olympias, with Alexander's connivance.

Segment two, which deals with the conquest of Darius, fails to mention that Darius was an usurper who did not command the allegiance of his nobles and their forces. To be exact, an ambitious eunuch removed the legitimate heir and used Darius, who was of the royal house and of an impressive appearance, as a pawn through whom he could rule the empire. This was not accepted by the nobles, and if Alexander had not come it is likely the empire would have broken up in civil wars unless another Darius the Great had emerged. This explains why the Persian army was so ineffective, with whole divisions not engaging or deserting during combat. Alexander was fighting an already beaten enemy. These two instances lessen Alexander's achievement but make it much more understandable.

Segments three and four, on the circuit of the empire and arrival at India, return and death, are more of a travelogue, recounting surviving folklore in a leisurely way while reflecting on the possible collapse of Alexander's character through excess. It gave me the feeling that Wood was running out of steam, filling up his allotted time with lesser material.

On the positive side Wood illuminates Alexander's deeds and character by experiencing the same terrain as Alexander did, and in some instances sheds light on Alexander's actions. Wood is, as always, scholarly, and engaging, prompting audience involvement.

As a whole the documentary reinforces the myth, while highlighting aspects of it unknown to western audiences. It's a populist, and amazing, travelogue. For some reason Wood refers to Hercules (the Roman god) throughout, not Herakles (the Greek god). Alexander? A spoiled boy with a megalomania fostered by his unscrupulous mother, he was able to steal the achievements of Philip, a military and political genius of the calibre of Julius Caesar, by murdering him. Then, fortuitously, he was able to take the Persian Empire away from an usurper who could not have held it. He is famous because he was a prime example for Christian moralists of the futility of human ambition by having conquered the world and then dying at 32.",1129248000,22,3138,5.075581395348837

1211646,1,B00000FELL,"Apart from some scenery shot in Iran and Afghanistan, places of current topical interest, this video is a waste of time. It claims to bring to life the feats of Alexander the Great and to search for the truth behind his legend. It does neither. It tires the viewer with endless shots of Michael Wood riding in all-terrain vehicles or on donkey carts, or slinging his backpack on as he heads up some mountain path, and sitting round a fire (invariably shown close-up) with representatives of the local ethnic group playing their ethnic instruments.  Worse, it distorts history: the narration is sketchy and uninspired, tending toward banality and stereotype, lacking any effort at providing context. Alexander emerges from this treatment as a simple and very violent megalomaniac, in the end ""broken by the loneliness and insanity of absolute power."" The facts that we do have along with educated interpretations about the kind of man he was suggest otherwise. The video barely hints at his singular achievement of transcending the extreme chauvinism characteristic of all cultures of his time. His complex, mutually respectful relationships with his men are dismissed by the statement, ""after all he put them through they could still be won over by his tricks."" Don't waste your money on this video if you want insight into the character and significance of Alexander the Great. Buy and read one of the standard biographies--Mary Renault's The Nature of Alexander is readable, indeed fascinating, and is well-regarded by scholars.",1125100800,26,1530,5.169354838709677
1211677,5,B00000FELL,"Michael Wood decided to follow the footsteps of Alexander the Great by retracing the path of that man and his army. Wood attempts much of the actual path himself, letting us see, and experience virtually, much of what the army experienced. The documentary is worth seeing for this alone, for despite the 2300+ years which have passed since Alexander's time, it is possible to get a sense of the distances, the heights, the valleys, the deserts and the bodies of water which the army traversed in order to ""conquer the world.""

The documentary was made several years ago - the date mentioned for the VHS version is 1998 - as Wood makes his journey, one region mentions Saddam Hussain being in power, and the Taliban being in the process of taking Kabul. Given the strife of the region, one has to admire Wood and his crew for their bravery and daring in shooting the documentary (as well as wonder how much paperwork they had to fill out). The conflicts in the area, as well as the well-documented carnage which Alexander and his armies inflicted, make this a far more sobering work than another one of Wood's documentaries, ""In Search of the Trojan War."" Wood, when interviewing locals along the route, finds that Alexander's deeds are often still remembered - and usually hated. Although Wood tries to admire Alexander throughout the documentary, Alexander's war crimes and slaughters and disregard for the lives of even his own people become more and more apparent. Wood tries to excuse this at the end of the four-part piece, explaining that we needed to understand Alexander within the context of his time. For me, this is insufficient. Great writers and thinkers had already come into being, and Alexander was certainly aware of them - after all, he was a pupil of Aristotle's!",1123027200,5,1782,4.823529411764706
1211678,4,B00000FELL,"The typical documentary of eras before photography struggles for visuals, using blurred reenactments and photographs of artifacts that often add little to the narrative.  The novel approach of ""Footsteps"" makes for compelling viewing.  But the content is far too focused on the details of the journey itself.

The program starts out in Macedonia. It then follows the career of Alexander through Asia Minor, Egypt, Iraq (Babylon), Iran (Persia), Afganistan, India and then the final march back to Iran again. Wherever possible, the actual route of Alexander's army is followed. This involved crossing national boundaries, battle lines in civil wars and some really intimidating mountains, goat paths and deserts. It does a good job of bringing out just how remarkable his achievements were.

This presentation is not chock full of historical facts and hypothesis but both of those are present in respectable quantity. They are present as adjuncts to the wonderful scenery.

Mr. Woods gives a 1st rate job of tracing the steps of Alexanders thru the Middle and Far East. He also takes great care to give a good hard, honest and balanced look at the man warts and all. In my humble opinion, the phrase what ""profits a man who inherits the whole earth but loses his soul"" comes to mind after seeing this flim. (Alexander had become a real monster and tryant at the end of his life.)

Altogether a great Documentary that takes the viewer to places where most of us can't or don't want to go to.(Mr. Wood went to Afghanistan when the Taliban was taking over the place to film the Afghan portion of Al's campaign there.)",1114732800,8,735,4.212765957446808
1211682,5,B00000FELL,"I ordered this DVD, along with two books, because I wished to learn more about Alexander the Great as a historical figure.  This was after having endured the recently released film disaster of the same name by Oliver Stone.  Having earlier watched another of Michael Wood's documentaries, the delightful ""The Conquistadores"", I was willing to gamble on Mr. Wood's skills as a storyteller a second time.  My gamble paid off.

As a trained historian and history teacher, I was again impressed by Mr. Wood's attention to detail and accuracy.  Not once in four hours of viewing, could I jump out of my seat, play the pedant, and shout ""Ah Ha!, he is wrong on this point!""

And the cinematography!  I was as riveted by the beauty of the landscapes as I was the engaging and often humorous commentary of the host.  ""In the Footsteps.."" deserves kudos for presenting the often desolate parts of the world its subject experienced as haunting and beautiful in their own right.

Wood's supreme gift, however, is his ability to tell a riveting story.  And to tell it in such a warm and affable way as to convey the impression he was sharing it with me personally.  It was together we traveled the Hindu Kush, tramped through the snow capped  mountains of Macedonia, and sat huddled with tea drinking Iranians, listening to the tales of ""Sikandur"", the horned one. Mr. Wood's intention is not to persuade, but instead to educate and stimulate debate.  My only regret is that the series was not longer.  Whatever happened to the fruits of Alexander's labors and the labors of his men?  Sadly, Mr. Wood leaves this tale for another to tell.",1107820800,19,1626,4.736654804270462

Add to that, he knows his stuff and presents it in a way that is both accurate and engaging.  The most interesting aspect of this documentary is the way he shows how the memory of Alexander remains alive in the folf memory of the people in the lands that Alexander conquered.  From the perspective of a North American here on the West Coast where history is measured in a dozen or so decades, it's incredible to see bards singing in tavernas singing of the deeds of Alexander that are still as real in the minds of the people as if it happened yesterday.",1107648000,,687,4.428571428571429
1211684,5,B00000FELL,"This is by no means a thoroughly objective view of Alexander and his life but it does do what it claims-to retrace the footsteps of Alexander as he continued exploring for the ends of the earth while seeking revenge.  This documentary is not meant to dissect Alexander's persona through exhaustive historical accounting or through scholarly discussions.  It simply tries to impart a small part of Alexander's character by showing what tremendous hardships he and his army endured and overcame, on their way from Macedonia to India. It retraces his footsteps not his being.

Though it does not necessarily explore the man, it does impart some insights. It shows a man of deep passions, perseverance, endurance, hardiness, foolhardiness, intelligence, a military genius with luck on his side and the possessor of a will of iron.  In short, he definitely was a man of mettle and one who changed the course of the world and shaped the thoughts of men for generations to come.

His journeys are re-traced step-by-step through the various territories he conquered.  The battle strategies are not discussed in depth.  Some are outlined in passing but they do paint a picture of a man who would not be denied and who could lead men by his willpower alone.  In short, this is a terrific documentary though it is somewhat one dimmentional. But it is meant to be that way as the title suggests. It is of extreme interest to see how Alexander ""Zul-Quarnain's"" story has remained vividly alive in the various conquered regions of old and how the man and the myth continue to survive to this day.  For a more thorough historical framework and objective discussion, try several well written texts especially the one by Peter Green.  The books and the movie will paint a much more complete view of the most distinguished military man in history. Thoughout, one must remember to judge him as a man of his time and not ours.",1107216000,8,1906,4.836923076923077
1211685,3,B00000FELL,"Despite the breathtaking scenery that he walks through--the Afghan wilderness, the Hindu Kush, the dry deserts of Southern Persia-- Wood's documentary doesn't come close to what he accomplished in 1979 with _In Search of the Trojan War_, his magnum opus.

Even his breathless excitement as he re-enacts for us Alexander's dilemnas doesn't make up for a relatively lacklustre documentary. For instance, in Trojan War, viewers are treated to nuanced scholarly commentaries which made for a certain complexity and richness--all sorely missed in this more recent production. I would have liked to hear what the experts had to say about Alexander and his times. And what happened to the music? The stirring and sometimes incredibly haunting music that graced Wood's earlier masterpiece is missing here; this detracts from any creation of mood. Well-chosen music to accompany the text is essential to any historical reconstruction and the sense of drama. And if that is not all, there is distinct lack of visual and mental variety to this documentary: the imaginative impetus that period art and artists' illustration can provide and which the best historical documenataries use to great effect was absent. We are afforded little else than being guided around some admittedly breathtaking scenery by Michael Wood, but little else to help us try to reconstruct hints of a bygone era. And this I think is necessary for even simply decent historical documentaries--the sensation that we are grasping something of another time.

Although it is undeniable that Alexander's personality, ego, and brilliance all contributed to what took place in history, I dislike the Great-man kind of history that leads to obvious historical distortions and an unnecessary concentration on one man. The temptation to romanticize can be too much. As Wood admits himself, almost as an aside, without his army (actually, Phillip's army) , Alexander could not have accomplished what he did...so why do we know next to nothing of his men? What did they wear? How did they fight? What did they see in Alexander, if anything? Many of these veterans were over 60 years old by the time they resisted Alexander's drive East, and stopped him at the Indus...Sixty! Now how do you expect anyone to fight at that age? Who were these incredible people? And as for that, who were the women that followed the army to what were then the remotest parts of the earth? What happened to the retired soldier-colonists who settled (left? abandoned?) in far-flung places like Bactria? How can anyone call such places ""home""? What did it take for these people to be who they were?

Wood's documentary is frustratingly light, especially when we know he could do so much better! Stick to Trojan War for the kind of attention and scholarly detail that makes for truly great documentary work ... Or, if you can dispense with the complexities and details that delight me, then go for his more recent Conquistadors--at least the music creates a haunting nostalgia..",1107043200,6,3006,5.105691056910569
1211686,4,B00000FELL,"This is a splendid travleogue of Alexander's journey of conquest.  Little is said however concerning his early years in Greece and his development under his father King Philip. Nothing is shown concerning his early campaigns in Greece, his sacking of Thebes and his pivotal part in the battle of Chronea in 338 BC.  The first major battle at the Granicus  in 332  BC after landing at the Hellespoint is also skipped over for some reason.  Despite these failings, Michael Wood provides a fascinating and energetic account of Alexander's route of conquest.  His enthusiam for the topic is evident throughout, and many fascinating people and places are shown. His use of the primary sources of Alexander make for interesting comparisons concerning description and reality.  To read what old sources say, and to try and make sense of them by traveling to see for oneself is one of the most compelling aspects of historical travel.

 The folklore and legends of Alexander in the various regions of the East that he passed through becomes evident in watching this work.  This is more a travelers history of Alexander.  Those desiring some insight into his battles may be somewhat disappointed here.  In my opinion more attention could have been given to this aspect of Alexander's career.  His generalship is one of the most concrete elements we have concerning his style of leadership and deserves greater attention here.  His two earlier battles as noted above are skipped over, and even Issus, Gaugamela and Hydaspes receive only scant mention.  Still, I can't fault this work totally for these omissions.  What we have is still an epic account of his travels and how these places and people appear today.

One comes away from viewing this travelogue with a new respect for Alexander's sheer force of will to conquer so many varied regions and peoples.  Nothing truly daunted him, and his legacy lives on vividly in the East, even if it may not be the most accurate view of him.",1102464000,,1975,4.9154078549848945
1211707,5,B00000FELL,"Around 300 BC, Alexander The Great had conquered the known world. He was only 32.  It is said that he got a fever and died when he realized there were no worlds left to conquer.

At this writing, Oliver Stone's soon to open epic ""Alexander"" is getting a lot of attention, so it's inevitable that similar themed digital editions will ride the publicity wave.

The four hour armchair adventure IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF ALEXANDER (Paramount) is among the very best of all TV documentaries.

Enthusiastic, knowledgable and affable Oxford scholar Michael Wood retraces -- for the first time -- the 16 country war path of Alexander from Macedonia to India. Citing excerpts from ancient Greek and Roman historians, Woods literally treks, rides, swims and sails in Alexander's  footsteps.  Passing through at least four war zones, Wood observes that these regions remain ""on the fault lines of history.""  No kidding.  Along the way, Wood encounters local story tellers who perform ancient recitations that keep Alexander's story alive and current.  For instance, in Iran there's still resentment of Alexander as conqueror of the Persian empire.

This exciting, engrossing documentary is loaded with numerous incidents rich in irony that puts in clearer perspective not only the world of Alexander (300 BC) but our modern, fractured world.  Highest recommendation.",1099785600,65,1350,5.232558139534884

1211710,4,B00000FELL,"In this combination travel guide and history lesson, Michael Wood takes a 20,000 mile journey retracing the steps of the great conqueror Alexander the Great. One of the things that makes this so interesting is that the lands Wood passes through are just as dangerous now as they were in Alexander's time. The video came out in 1998; in the West, we may think of that as a safer time, but many of the places on this map have been in a state of war almost throughout recorded history. Afghanistan, for example, was in the middle of a civil war and Wood was warned by a guide that their lives were in danger as they passed through rugged mountains. In addition to war, of course, nature itself poses a threat in the form of mountain-slides, harsh deserts and extremes of temperature.

As for Alexander, though we know many of the facts of his journey and the many lands he conquered, many things remain disputed. Wood mentions ancient historians such as Arrian, who themselves were writing long after the actual events. It is fascinating how legends of Alexander persist in this part of the world, from Iran to India, passed down not in books but orally from one generation to the next. For the people in these regions, many who live lives not very different from their ancestors in Alexander's day, more than 2000 years ago, history is not abstract but a part of daily life. In the video, for example, we see Iranian storytellers dramatically recounting events of Alexander's time. The diverse sights, scenery and people of these regions alone make the video worth watching.

Alexander appears to have been driven initially by a desire for revenge against the Persian empire, which had long been an enemy of the Macedonians. As other reviewers have pointed out, Wood unfortunately uses Greek and Macedonian interchangeably, which is not accurate. When Alexander came to power, in fact, the Greek states such as Athens were hostile to him and saw him as a threat. This is such an obvious mistake, you'd think someone would have edited it out, but overall it's a minor quibble.

At times Wood seems overcome with hero worship of Alexander, which makes him an enthusiastic if somewhat biased narrator. He does not shirk, however, from recounting some of Alexander's atrocities. Alexander appears to have been a complex and volatile individual who could be generous and magnanimous and at other times vicious and vindictive. Yet he was always a great leader and military commander (if at times lucky) who inspired his army to the most difficult tasks. Michael Wood and his crew follow some of the Macedonian army's difficult treks up mountains and through deserts, but at other times they are transported by jeeps and trains. We can imagine the difficulty encountered by Alexander's army --thousands of people making these journeys entirely on foot or horseback.

Alexander the Great is one of the pivotal figures of ancient history. His campaigns helped break down the barriers dividing East and West. In The Footsteps of Alexander the Great is not a comprehensive or perfect account of Alexander's life, but it is probably the most exciting telling of the story you will find short of retracing the journey yourself.",1093737600,6,3212,4.888073394495413
1211711,4,B00000FELL,"The taunt to Alexander from the commander of the troops of Sogdiana (in modern day Uzbekistan) from the top of the Sogdian rock, equivalent in difficulty to El Capitan.  Macedonians responded by picking 300 mountaineers to do just that.

This documentary is incredible! Historian Michael Wood retraces Alexander the Great's footsteps over 20,000 miles of harsh terrain: desert, tropics, mountains.  A pilgrimage for only the physically fit!  It's hard to imagine how the Macedonian army managed without modern conveniences, cars, ac, radio!  What's so great about this film is how Michael Wood makes you relive Alexander's feats, and he retells the most notable stories of his life with such enthusiasm.

Wood quotes from two ancient historians, preferring Arrian over Curtius.  Probably, Curtius' description of crucifixions all along the coast of Syria and Lebanon is true.  Crucifixion originated with the Persians, the Romans perfected its cruelty.  I was a little disappointed that he didn't use other references like Josephus or the Bible, (see Daniel 2, 7, 8, 11 about prophecies of the Greeks).  In Daniel 8:5-8:8, Alexander/Greece is depicted as a goat whose feet do not touch the ground reflecting the Greeks' swiftness/athletic prowess.  In 8:8, the Bible says of him that he ""magnified himself exceedingly, and when he was strong, he was broken"".  He died at age 33 in ancient Babylon, by the banks of the Euphrates.  The jews did see Alexander as a liberator and their relations with him were good (see Josephus' The Antiquities of the Jews Book 11, Chapter 8, 5 about Alexander's vision of the jew's high priest at Dios, Macedonia).  Alexander tells Parmenio, his general, ""But that God (Israel's) exhorted me to make no delay...for that He would conduct my army, and give me dominion over the Persians...and remembering that vision...I believe I bring this army under the divine conduct, and shall therewith conquer Darius (III), and destroy the power of the Persians.""  The high priest showed him the Book of Daniel after making sacrifice with Alexander in the Second Temple.  Also, Wood's interpretation of Daniel 7:7 and 7:19, 7:23 is slightly off, yet so are many theologians'.  From Daniel 7:19, the beast depicted has feet of brass (Greece, 2:39) teeth of iron (Rome, 2:40).  I believe the proper interpretation is that out of the Greco-Roman world, antichrists would come and persecute the saints Daniel 7:23-26.  (At the time of Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonians' first emperor, the city of Rome was just being founded, 560 B.C. or so., hence even the angel could not put a name to it!)

Anyway, there is probably enough written about Alexander the Great to litter the 20,000 miles of territory Wood walked through.  His military feats, are studied today still and his tactics employed by Napoleon and even Hitler (my reason for 4 stars not 5).  I couldn't help thinking of those poor Greek soldiers dying of exhaustion all along the way.  Yet, to lead them on for so long is incredible.",1092355200,4,3008,5.069105691056911

1211714,5,B00000FELL,"In 334 B.C.E., Alexander of Macedon left his home, never to return.  In these videos, Michael Wood unfolds the journey that Alexander took nearly 2,500 years ago.  This effort, alongside his IN SEARCH OF THE TROJAN WAR has distinguished Wood as the Carl Sagan of classical history.
In this documentary we're able to view the sundry places that the Macedonian visited, conquered and cherished in his journey into history.  The number of countries that he travelled thru are innumerable, including what is modern day Turkey, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Isreal, Afghanistan, Syria, India + many, many more.  Some of the topography has scarcely changed in the intermittant years, while in other places the scenery has changed quite a bit.  The former examples are of more interest, for it engages the viewer to imagine himself marching alongside the legendary General!
Along the way, Wood carries with him his trusty CAMPAIGNS OF ALEXANDER by the Greek historian Arrian.  Wood also consults the local folklore of the denizens who have descended from the very people who fought for and against Alexander.  Looking at the mythology of the man from several cultural viewpoints enhances our understanding of his significance in & around Asia Minor.
Although there is a great deal of information that is offered about the travels of Alexander, precious little detail is given on his tactics and strategies of battle.  Also, almost nothing is said of his father, Phillip II, or the historical background of Alexander's rise to glory.  For a documentary that covers the former topic, I would recommend ALEXANDER THE GREAT AND THE BATTLE OF ISSUS.  For studies of the historical backdrop of Alexander's life, consider MACEDONIA:  THE LAND OF A GOD (parts I & II) as well as the writings of Isocrates.  All 3 of these may be found @ Amazon.com.
As a sidenote, Wood's trek thru Afghanistan may be of particular interest in regards to recent developments.  Wood went thru in 1996, just as the Taliban was asserting control over the country.  One can see just how chaotic & dangerous life in that country was and is.
According to legend, when Julius Caesar was around 30, he wept at the feet of a statue of Alexander.  Caesar was overwhelmed by the fact that Alexander had conquered almost all the known world by the time he was 30, while Caesar had done so relatively little in comparison.  Caesar spent the rest of his life symbolically attempting to re-trace the steps of Alexander's conquests.

I would have preferred more panoramic views. It is rather dissatifying to see the place of the Battle of Issus, without having time to actually look at the place. Just a brief sweep of the landscape would have been enough.  Also, the amount of detail is uneven. Only two battles were covered in any depth. I would have preferred to have more, and in greater detail. It would have been more exciting to the viewer.

This production from Michael Woods has been considered the gold standard of Alexander documentaries for entertainment.  The general scholarship is excellent, while Wood also weaves in a lot of local tradition as he travels actual paths believed to be the route of Alexander.  Some of it is still supposition (he estimates some locations with help of locals and historical accounts), but fairly solid overall.  This program is much more faithful for those seeking specific information about Alexander's journey.  He starts from the beginning and travels as much as possible along actual routes, meeting local peoples all the way.  Some of the people Wood interviews are quite the characters!  It's amazing to see when Wood traveled these paths, Saddam Hussein was still in power in Iraq and the Taliban had not taken Kabul.  He is able to travel areas he could never go freely now, though some northern areas of Afghanistan are more restive.  The strengths of this series are also minor weaknesses.  The smaller details where he relies on local legends and personal guesses are probably not 100% correct.  But they are good theories.  Also, since he is actually traveling the paths, he also tends to be the focal point of most shots.  He is like that spot on the screen that travels with the background no matter where the camera goes (figuratively speaking).  Never the less, it is an outstanding production that has few rivals.  The US version went out of print for a bit and looks expensive at time of writing.  You can get the UK release for much cheaper on Amazon UK.  However, it will only play region 2.

DAVID ADAMS - ALEXANDER'S LOST WORLD
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alexander-s-Lost-World/dp/B00J81M1DQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alexander's Lost World</a>&nbsp;uses Alexander more as a very loose tie to explore civilizations in Northern Afghanistan and other areas to the north and east such as Tajikistan.  In fact, it's a lot about the ancient civilizations along the Oxus river.  Many of these civilizations would have been encountered by Alexander and these interactions do figure into the narrative of this program.  We also get a look at what these civilizations would have been like long before and sometimes after Alexander passed through.  The Bactrian civilization along with it's cities factors in very heavily.  This may sound dull to some, but I have to say it is fascinating!  Afghanistan appears like a barren country of unsophisticated peoples now.  Life tends to cling to the wadies and rivers in the mountain valleys.  We see here how many of these cities were quite extraordinary for their time.  In many ways the society there might have been less backward compared to the rest of the world than the Afghanistan of today.  The cities of Ai Khanoum and Bakh were particularly extraordinary.  Aqueducts with kiln fired bricks covered large distances and were surprisingly complex.  David Adams also explores up the Oxus river to areas where Alexander would not have gone in order to find the source of the Oxus.  Along the way he discusses civilizations and battles that occurred there, including some that do claim relation back to Alexander.  The narration and graphics are also much updated and fascinating in this production as they show you representations of what these huge cities might have looked like.  The entire program begins with a through back to Jason and the Argonauts (long before Alexander) as Adams asserts that Alexander was following old routes that may have been traveled by what Adams believes was the true journey of the Argo.  It's a bit of a stretch, but certainly plausible.  It was really interesting to see many areas of the Hindu Kush as well as the Pamir Mountains where Adams ends his story.  Gorgeous, remote country!

The focus of these two productions are really quite different and both can be watched together without crossing over on material to the point you get bored.  The BBC version is older with a lot less polish.  The Adams production is quite slick, but less about Alexander.",1422489600,3,4391,5.110955056179775
7908342,5,B00000FELL,"I saw this series on PBS and it was phenomenal.  The narrator and host, Michael Wood, actually travels the life's journey of Alexander the Great, as closely as feasible.

Some background helps to appreciate this more;  however, even someone who is new to Greek history can fully appreciate it.  The film has so much more depth than recent Hollywood versions of this story.  The retelling of history, which is Mr. Wood's specialty, practically makes one feel as if you were there, ages ago.

Based on other strong reviews of this show, the odds are you'll also be impressed.",1419379200,,573,4.795918367346939
