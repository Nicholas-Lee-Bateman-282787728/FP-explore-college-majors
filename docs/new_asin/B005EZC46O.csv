8469307,5,B005EZC46O,"As I do not live near a studio, I relish when I get a complete workout/kriya that works certain parts of your body and deepens my meditation experience.  The first set worked on the colon and liver to help release creativity and the second set was ""The Complete Workout for The Elementary being""  The first workout helped me deepen my meditation.  The next day, I finished my idea for a children's book and have a good rough draft.  I am not saying it was due to this yoga, but at the same time, anything that helps me move forward with my life is a plus in my book.
I love how the class was presented with clear instructions and many people to follow if need be.  The only thing I did not like was listening to her breathe through the meditation.  Our breathing was not in synch and I felt it stop me from even going further into my meditation.  Beyond that, I want more.  For those into the yoga part, I can feel the stretch in my back and the warmth in my spine.  However, I could not get sweat on my forehead in the spinal flex.  Cheers to this gal and please keep releasing more videos so people like me that live in the boondocks and no KY for hundreds of miles, keeping creating and I'll be your best student.",1446336000,,1216,4.202586206896552
8469308,5,B005EZC46O,"A great Kundalini yoga workout. The instructor was very straight forward and I liked that a lot. I did both workouts back to back. The first workout is about 30 min. and is a very effective workout. It gives you a cardio element, a stretching element, and a meditation element. It is a great workout when you are short on time. I loved the part where you go through the ""The Complete Workout for The Elementary being"", which consists of 5 rounds of 10 exercises while you chant  ""HAR"". This is where the cardio effect comes in. It is such a great routine and you do not feel as though you are doing a workout. I was engaged and sweating by the end of this routine. The hour-long workout focuses on the liver and colon. There are a lot of standing exercises, such as squatting, and toe tapping/running. It does not feel super hard though, like a typical strength workout would feel. You feel like you are strengthening rather than straining your muscles. Both workouts are so great and can be done as a complete 1hr. & 45 min. workout or can be separated into 2 smaller workouts. Kundalini Yoga has helped me so much. I own over 400 workout dvds from Cathe Friedrich dvds to Jillian Michaels to P90X. My Kundalini Yoga workouts are the ones I reach for most often. I have severe anxiety and self-esteem issues, and Kundalini yoga is the only workout that has ever really helped me get to the root of  those issues. I struggle to be consistent with working out; but if you buy this workout and invest the time in yourself to be kind to your mind and body; this will help you so much. Afterall, it should not be about being the best-looking person; it should be about kindness and spiritual beauty.",1384128000,3,1695,4.446945337620579
8469309,5,B005EZC46O,"This is my favorite Kundalini  workout and I have owned many.  The teacher is excellent and like others that have written reviews, I like having explanations of the benefits of the sets performed.  The gong relaxation is the best I have ever heard.  I could easily do this every day and I am sure the positive results would be many.",1367798400,,332,4.483333333333333
8469310,2,B005EZC46O,"I've watched quite a few Kundalini videos just trying to decide how I felt about this yoga style. The only good thing about this video is the class itself. This video demonstrated that you don't have to be young and fit to practice yoga. You can be any shape and any age to practice and I don't think that demographic is represented that often in the video's I've seen. So, it was very refreshing to see a class of ""real people.""

That being said the rest of the video was...terrible. It wasn't filmed well and it looked like the teacher wasn't really in the classroom if that makes sense. It showed her than it showed the class, then her, than the class and it was not a smooth transition. The classroom was small and a bit crowded with white paint. Raghubir Kintisch was in a wood paneled room that seemed..apart from the students. Plus, the teacher kept referring to notes and would only demonstrate the move once than sit down. I got the sense that she was in a costume and playing a part. As someone who had practiced for years she shouldn't have had to refer to cliff notes to lead her class.

If you're interested in this style of yoga than skip this video.",1363132800,2,1164,4.3842592592592595
8469311,5,B005EZC46O,"This is a very enjoyable video. It is actually composed of 2 Kundalini yoga classes; the first one is about an hour and the second is around 35 minutes, making it a bargain at $10.00.

Raghubir Kintisch is a great teacher who gives clear prompts or cues, which is really helpful since Kundalini yoga is mostly practiced with the eyes closed. She doesn't needlessly chatter on, which is really important to me. I like KY to be an inward experience and that's hard to achieve if I have a teacher who is constantly yapping!

I like the classroom aspect, since most of the time I practice KY at home, either alone or with my husband. It also gives me a gentle reminder that everyone is different, therefore everyone's abilities as well as their limitations are different. Both sessions have great mantras and music from a variety of well-known KY musicians.

This is an excellent addition to anyone's KY library of videos and DVDs.",1348790400,4,927,4.674846625766871
8469312,5,B005EZC46O,"I rented this dvd via Amazon Instant Video.  Viewing this dvd will be a different experience for most people who rent or purchase yoga ""exercise"" videos.  This dvd is focused on Kundalini yoga which is the oldest form of yoga.  This is a dvd to first watch and then experience by following along with the class.  I love the way the teacher instructs the students on what to do and then allows each student to follow at their own pace.  Because this is a real yoga class with students, you get to observe how each student indivdually interprets the instructions according to their abilities.  I enjoy the variety in colors, shapes and sizes of the students. Seeing this variety helped me to be patient with myself as I tried the various ""techniques"".  All of the techniques taught in the video are useful to practice after class to improve and cope in everyday life.  This particular class is focused on women but kundalini yoga is of course for both men and women.  I am going to buy it and I highly recommend it.",1332547200,11,1013,4.521978021978022
