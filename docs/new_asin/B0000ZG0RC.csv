8004895,5,B0000ZG0RC,Cristian delafuente was great in this flick.  It is an interesting plot.  This is a true chick flick.  It makes you believe that true love will always find you.,1400025600,,160,4.448275862068965
8004896,3,B0000ZG0RC,"MURDER REINCARNATED (originally known as Minimal Knowledge) is an original movie, focusing on the concept of reincarnation, along with the investigation of a serial killer.  Don't be misled by the description on the back of the box:  this is NOT about finding who killed a woman in her previous life.  Instead, we focus on a brooding, hunky detective (nicely played by Cristian de la Fuente - Basic, Vampires los Muertos) who is investigating the murders of elderly ladies.  He meets a young waitress (The Forsaken and Coyote Ugly's lovely Izabella Miko) who believes she has been reincarnated several times, but is leary of telling her new boyfriend, Mr. dela Fuentes.  The movie offers some interesting theories behind reincarnation, but it's pace is a little slow to maintain the suspense of who the serial killer is.  Director and writer Gregory J. Corrado has done a nice job with his actors, but the movie suffers from a lack of momentum, and a shaky denouement.  Still, it gets stars for its originality and for De La Fuentes' impassioned performance.",1109116800,6,1058,4.9772727272727275
