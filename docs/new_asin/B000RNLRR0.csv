2869831,2,B000RNLRR0,"The copy I bought was titled ""Joongcheon"" with English subtitle. It's visually beautiful. It also has some substances in the plot but overall it's not a good movie. It's because relationship between the 2 main characters are not touching at all. The fighting scenes are not good as in other Korean-made movies such as ""Shadowless Sword"" or ""Warrior"".

It's worth watching once.",1213056000,,377,5.080645161290323
2869832,4,B000RNLRR0,"The plot of the film is not really a strong one (nor original for that matter) but a good one never the less. There will be times where you are left scratching your head hoping for an explanation for certain things but they are not harmful or have a great impact to the plot so it is forgivable. But what truly saved the film more for me and for some people who agree with me is the graphics and the landscape of Midheaven. And the action sequences even though there are not many, they don't disappoint. The biggest scene stealer would have to be the protagonist vs. 5,000 to 10,000 demon soldiers. The acting is a bit stiff and the female star of the film (Kim Tae-Hee) really needs to learn how to have more than just two facial expresions (wich are only just a surprised expresion or a sad expresion). She has shown promise but she has long way to go. This film is more for the WUXIA fan freaks including myself and in no way should it be compared to Crouching tiger (overhyped film) or Hero. It should be compared with films like The Duel, The Storm Riders, and mainly Bichumoo. But of course because of a film called The Promise most people will compare them at first glance. So in closing, the story could have been executed better but the graphics deffinetly makes up for it. And the movie is not really a martial arts film so don't compare the film with them.

2869833,4,B000RNLRR0,"The RESTLESS (aka. Jeong-Cheon) is a fantasy adventure film set in a world of souls that have passed away long before they are reincarnated. This latest WUXIA foray from South Korea combines the elements of love and romance, fantasy and terrific swordplay, martial arts action in an eternal battle between good and evil. Directed by Jo Dong-Oh, this fantasy epic gives its focus on elaborate costumes, expensive set designs with a tale of romance and loyalty. People who are familiar with Chinese Wuxia epics will no doubt embrace ""The Restless"", with the usual style of wire fu reminiscent of Chinese outings such as Tsui Hark`s ""The Legend Of Zu"" and the more recent Korean Wuxia such as ""Shadowless Sword"". (It would be unfair to compare this film to ""Musa the warrior"" which I will review later on)

Jung Woo-Sung(Musa the Warrior) is Gwak Yi, a former Chuyongdae(Royal Demon hunters) who after an encounter with demon-hybrids to protect a village, unexpectedly finds himself in Mid-Heaven, a pseudo-Buddhist holding where deceased souls gather to wait 49 days for their eventual reincarnation. There, Gwak Yi meets So-Hwa (Kim Tae-hee), a supposed deity who is assigned an important task. So-hwa must deliver the so-called ""Holy Stone"" to the ""Pool of Reflection"" in order to prevent evil-doers from upsetting the balance between Earth and Heaven. If she fails then no one will be reincarnated. Noble and fearless, Gwak Yi enlists in Son-Hwa's cause immediately but he has his own hidden motivation.
Son-hwa is a dead ringer for Gwak Yi's former love Yon-Hwa, whom he failed to protect from an untimely death. Actually, they are the same being, Son-hwa is a ""Chuneen"", resurrected deity with no recollection of their past life on Earth. This complicates matters for both Gwak Yi and Son-hwa even further when Gwak Yi's former comrades(led by Hur Jun-ho) as a ""Chuyongdae"" are the ones who threaten the stability of Mid-Heaven. Meaning that in order to help Son-hwa, he must once again send his former comrades(to whom he owes a debt of honor) in the earthly plane to suffer a second death.

The astounding CGI effects and set designs, awesome action, superb martial arts choreography are the elements that carry this Wuxia swordplay fantasy tale. The film is definitely technically sound and it is so obvious that its budget went to the film's special effects. The Martial arts choreography rivals other Chinese installments, and definitely displays its competency in regards to adrenaline-pumping action sequences. The film is definitely engaging when it comes to action sequences; Highlights include a very cool forest battle and the grand-daddy of all climactic battles where Gwak-Yi engages 10,000 demonic spirits alone. (Azumi would eat her pretty little heart out). The action is engaging and plentiful; that will make fans of superb CGI designs stand up and cheer. PS3 and Xbox fans will no doubt be entertained.

Aside from the CGI-enhanced action sequences, what stands out the most is the spectacular costumes and sets. Although, the colors and rendering may not put ""The Promise"" or ""The Banquet"" to shame, it is nonetheless very impressive. The acting is quite decent, Jung Woo-Sung shows his usual charismatic manly appeal that wooed female fans in ""A Moment to Remember"". Lovely Kim Tae-Hee performance is partly acceptable, I do have mixed feelings about her performance after this 2nd viewing; she seemed to have limited expressions in emotion. The villains seems to be a little over-expressive in their demeanor, but thankfully, Heo Jun-Ho bears much of the weight since he does have a unique villainous aura.

Visually stunning and quite beautiful, the film is not without its faults. The problem with the screenplay is that when there are no fights, the proceedings are slow-paced that it almost stops to a crawl. Strong characters are definitely needed to form an attachment to its viewers. People may say that the characters are a bit underdeveloped and while I do partly agree, (there was no explanation at all as to how the villains gained their powers); I do believe that the reason why some people may feel this way is because a lot of it happens in the form of flashbacks and at times, it does prove blurry, which may result with some difficulty in making a connection to its audience. Folks unfamiliar with Buddhist lore may find themselves a little lost, as to what some places mean and as to why are reincarnations relevant to the lost souls.

The Restless is indeed a masterpiece in Korean film-making in terms of technical aspects. This fantasy-adventure will definitely charm the audience with its gorgeous execution in set designs. It is not a piece of contemporary Wuxia but more of an overindulgent fantasy epic that has gained mass international appeal. The film is also geared for action/CGI fan boys. The film may have some difficulty connecting to some viewers and some may consider the film very superficial. There's good and evil, love and hate; but it all seems to have been overshadowed by its stunning visuals that it seemed to lack credibility. It may be a little difficult to wow an audience if all you have going is the action and grand sets.

""The Restless"" may not offer much in originality which would make it stand out, it makes the film a little forgettable. On the action-entertainment side of the coin, the film doesn't disappoint. It may be more of an execution of ""style over substance""...But what a style it is to behold!

Recommended! [3  + Stars]

2869835,4,B000RNLRR0,"The RESTLESS(aka: Jeong-Cheon) is the latest in South Korea's foray into the Fantasy- epic-romance/WUXIA Swordplay genre. This fantasy-adventure can definitely charm the viewer because it looks amazingly beautiful. The set designs are superb and the action is very entertaining.

Jung Woo-Sung(Musa the Warrior) is Gwak Yi, a former Chuyongdae(Royal Demon hunters) who after an encounter with demon-hybrids to protect a village, unexpectedly finds himself in Mid-Heaven, a pseudo-Buddhist holding where deceased souls gather to wait 49 days for their eventual reincarnation.

Meaning that in order to help Son-hwa, he must once again send his former comrades(to whom he owes a debt of honor) in the earthly plane to suffer a second death.

People who love SFX-laden epics will no doubt embrace ""The Restless"". There is plenty of action and they are very enthralling, thanks to the top-notch visual effects and awesome fight choreography. Highlights include a cool forest fight, and the very awesome epic finale, where Gwak Yi takes on about 10,000 demonic warrior spirits all by himself.(Azumi and Casshern, eat your hearts out!). The CGI effects are well-done and is sure to impress PS3 fanboys. The set designs are awesome and stunning.

The story itself is not very original, but quite bearable. It is about Love and Hate, promises and loyalty, good and evil. The costumes and set designs may remind audiences of Tsui Hark's ""Legend of Zu"". The film's main WEAKNESS may be that the plot/characters may have a difficult time connecting with some viewers. The two leads do a decent interpretation of their characters. Jung Woo-sung suits the character of Gwak Yi, while lovely Kim Tae-Hee fills the screen with her charisma.

I bought the KOREAN (region-3) 2-disc Special Edition when it came out a month ago. Korean released dvds have such good presentation, which is why it's no wonder they're expensive. Great DVD from CJ Entertainment.
Take note that dvds made in Taiwan(like the unofficial ones circulating in Amazon)may be compressed in a way that may freeze in most stand alone players. They are encoded with no region coding to fool U.S. players.
PICTURE: 2.40 ratio Anamorphic Widescreen. The video transfer is phenomenal, sharpness and detail is awesome. Colors are very vibrant and the flesh-tones are very good. No complaints.
AUDIO/Subtitles: 5.1 Dolby Digital-Ex and DTS-ES Korean Language track. The sound is POWERFUL(especially on DTS), the channels are very nicely separated. English Subtitles are well-timed and translated.
EXTRAS: Music video, commentary, ""making of"", Behind the scenes, trailers and more.., unfortunately there are no subtitles in most of the docos.

CLOSING REMARKS:
The Restless may not be wholly original but it is a very well-made feature. You can really tell that they spent most of their budget in the visual effects, costumes and set designs. It is worth seeing and is quite entertaining. Fans of Wuxia Swordplay epics will definitely embrace it for the action, if not, for it's beautiful visuals.

2869836,2,B000RNLRR0,"***************Mild Spoilers********************

I have to say I was fairly disappointed with The Restless. Having read a wonderful review about it, and an interesting synopsis, I was hoping that this movie would be as good as my favorite Korean epic, Musa.
The story focuses on Yi Gwak, a demon slayer who is poisoned by a group of villagers who intend to kill him and collect the bounty on his head. He manages to escape, and passes out. He wakes up alive, but in Midheaven, the place where souls go and stay right before reincarnation. There, he meets a white reaper, who resembles his long dead wife. The plot gets complicated when his ex-squad of dead demon slayers show up chasing after the wife. Apparently she has something they want.
Unfortunately, the interesting plot is just about all this movie has going for it. The two lead actors were kind of dull and had no chemistry. Dare I say the acting even borderlined on bad? The fight scenes were redundant and cliched. They were all typical of your average Wu Xia films. The female lead tries to fight, gets overpowered and the hero runs in to save her... not once but SEVERAL times. In fact, in ALL of her fight scenes that's how it ends up. And the ending has the obligatory one man against a gazillion soldiers that he cuts through with relative ease. And some parts of the films just flat out DRAGGED. The dialogue was quite boring, leaving the characters very two dimensional.
That being said, the special effects were pretty. There was even one memorable and touching scene of a close up of the hero's friend as he dies, turning into this burning paper.
But unfortunately, special effects alone can't carry a movie.
So needless to say, I'm still searching for that wonderful Korean epic that will blow Musa out of the water.",1182384000,5,1790,4.682539682539683

2869842,4,B000RNLRR0,"Yi Gwak is a demon hunter, who after falling asleep in a temple after being posioned wakes up in the Wuxia version of purgatory, a holding place for souls who have 49 days to reflect before they are reincarnated back to earth.

In Mid Heaven, he meets his dead girlfriend who has been reincarnated as an upper-class angel in this new heaven. She protects the lost souls and is battling members of his former demon-fighting team, who have also died and live in Mid Heaven. Although she fights her attraction to Yi Gwak, she finds herself falling in love with him.

First, I really liked this film, even thought the plot was noticibly thin. I felt my eyes get moist during the ending during the final showdown, and I felt sad for the nice demon-hunting brother who refused to kill Yi Gwak, and whom Yi Gwak inadvertantly destroyed.

I felt Yi Gwak's girlfriend was a rather weak character. She is supposed to be a swordswoman in the afterlife, but is knocked out and easily defeated. So was the other female character who loved Yi Gwak. I also felt the explanation as to why his former friends turned evil wasn't clear and seemed rather contrived. I did like the special effect of having the deceased souls break apart into embers was very cool.

Overall, while I found this film on the wek side, I thought it was beautifully filmed and exciting to watch.",1288828800,,1353,4.578512396694215

2869844,4,B000RNLRR0,"This movie is about a demon hunter who is trap in the spirit world where those who dies goes to stay until they are reincarnated. Gwak Yi is the hero who happened to be in a village during a demon invasion. With his martial arts and special sword, he easily kills off his these demons. The ungrateful villagers thank him by drugging him and trying to capture Gwak Yi for a reward. Somehow Gwak Yi is wanted by the government. Gawk Yi escapes but still falls prey to the drug that was given to him. He finds himself in the spirit world. He can't figure why he is there because he is not dead either. He's alive, yet stuck in the spirit world known as Mid Heaven.

Upon his arrival, Mid Heaven is attack by demons led by his old Demon Slaying friends when they once lived on earth. One of the last remaining defender of Mid Heaven happens to be his former wife, So Hwa, reincarnated and doesn't remember her past life. Gwak Yi saves So Hwa's life and they continue to be on the run from his old allies.

Gwak Yi was later captured and brought to his old master and he explains his reason why he is doing what he is doing and warns him not to interfere. For his former friends to achieve their goals, they needed the Holy Stone that So Hwa have in her possession. Gwak Yi decides he just can't stand there and watch So Hwa goes against his former allies because of his love for her. Once they realize that Gwak Yi won't understand their cause, they go after them trying to achieve their goals.

The good:
Action, color, artwork, costumes, love story....and did I mention the action? A lot of fight scenes that any martial arts fanatic can enjoy. It seems that the direction of Kung Fu movies are moving towards the beautiful artwork like Jet Li's Hero or House of Flying Daggers. Extremely colorful and amazing to look at. I could only imagine what they would look like in Blue Ray Disc. The story is focused between Gwak Yi and So Hwa. Relationship. The present and the past. How they once loved each other and how they rediscover their love.

The Bad:
The plot is a little weak. There were missing or un-explained things that could of thicken the story line a little more. The writers did not build enough of a story line between Gwak Yi and his friends. Even though they did flash backs of them and their past to explain why they were now in Mid Heaven.

Despite being a love story, somehow it lacks emotion or attachment to all the characters. I didn't feel any lost or sadness as these characters faced hardships and sufferings. I guess not enough character build up that as a viewer, I didn't form any attachment to them. They didn't move me. For example, when I first watched Mel Gibson's ""Brave Heart"", I was extremely moved by William Wallace and rooted for him until his death. I felt bad and heart broken that the main hero have lost at the end. The death of his family, his wife and eventually his own life was extremely moving.

Overall, this movie still catches my attention. The beautiful artwork, costumes, and action scenes were enough to gain my interest through out the movie. Not the greatest movie and plot but I find it good enough for me to rate it 4 out of 5 stars....well not quite 4...more like 3.85 out of 5 stars.",1221091200,3,3238,4.388333333333334
2869845,4,B000RNLRR0,"The Good Things
*Loads of slick, stylish special effects.  Some of them are gorgeous.
*Quite a few good fight scenes and a couple of battles.  I loved the ending battle!
*Interesting usages of mythology and theology.
*Production design is splendid.
*Storyline is not bad.
*Characters are not bad.  Good acting.
*Music is good.

The Bad Things
*A little slow towards the middle.  The story seems to have lost momentum there.

The Questionable Things
*Lots of melodrama, and it can also be seen as sappy.  I didn't mind it so much though.
*For a couple of areas, I was reminded of a few other films (the main character initially reminded me of Jubei from the ""Ninja Scroll"", Midheaven reminded me of the ""Bleach"" series, and the ending resembled ""Lord of the Rings"" a little bit).

The storyline is simple, but leaves a lot of room for strong emotions and lots of style.  The drama can be a little too overwhelming, but there are enough slick action scenes and special effects to entertain.  Altogether, it's a visually immersive fantasy epic that's worthwhile seeing.

The DVD has good quality video and audio.  It has only a Korean language track with English subtitles.  It includes one making-of documentary and a couple of other featurettes.",1217548800,3,1244,4.866666666666666

8201529,4,B000RNLRR0,"This movie is an odd bird--a really mediocre movie, with an excellent movie straining to get out of it, but not succeeding.

The overall story line is great. The relationships between the characters are really interesting. The hero, wandering demon hunter Yi Gawk, is transported to Midheaven, a realm where the dead wait to be reincarnated, while still alive. He was apparently called by the celestial powers to put down a demonic uprising, because only a living person can use his special demon-killing blade. In Midheaven, he finds his dead lover So-hwa/ Yon-hwa (whose death he blames himself for), now elevated to a celestial power-in-in-training--with all memories of her mortal life erased. And the villains are Yi Gawk's former demon hunter comrades-in-arms (unjustly executed by the aristocracy), who have staged an uprising in Midheaven to invade the world of the living and make it a more just place. The villains aren't card board cut-outs, but people with realistic motivations, even sympathetic if misguided ones. The film attempts to explore some interesting philosophical points about the role of suffering and memory in what it means to be human and whether the desire for revenge can make the world a better place, or if only love can do it. The special effects are generally quite good, with some remarkable fight scenes and great visuals of Midheaven.

But the movie is dragged down by the simply awful acting. Many of the characters are portrayed in a quite hammy way. Others seem to have only one or two expressions they are capable of. Apparently, the actors are some of the most respected in South Korea, but they bombed on this film. Maybe something gets lost in the subtitles, but the film doesn't quite live up to its philosophical potential--I felt like more thought needed to be given to it. It would have helped if Yi Gawk seemed more genuinely torn between his dead lover and his former comrades. And the female lead, So-hwa/ Yon-hwa, despite supposedly being a powerful celestial spirit, spent most of her time being a passive damsel-in-distress in need of rescuing by her lover Yi Gawk.

This could have been a great movie, but it falls short on so many levels.",1457740800,,2194,4.924324324324324
