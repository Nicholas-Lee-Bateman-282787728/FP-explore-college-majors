8394883,1,B003DQOS8S,"I have Les' other dvds & a PDF from Jim Edwards.  Jim is a nice guy, but this is just a bad interview with Les Brown!  Jim talks too much & doesn't let Les answer questions as he would like.  The information Les shares is on Les Brown's ""Live - Step Into your Greatness DVD/CD combo"" for less than $40!!! Great attempt, but you're better off getting the Les Brown: ""Live - Step into your Greatness DVD/Cd set"" & Jim Edwards ""Money on Demand"" Pdf! If you want to complete your collection I recommend you get Les' ""Live Full & Die Empty"" and ""The Les Brown Story"" (All for less than $40 each)!!! Don't forget to get Les' older PBS Specials (""You Deserve"",""It's Possible"", and ""Power to Change"")that are ""free"" for Realplayer download on the internet. Hope this helped...",1279843200,,768,4.510791366906475
