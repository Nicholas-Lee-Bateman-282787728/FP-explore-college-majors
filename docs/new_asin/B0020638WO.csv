If you, like I am, are starting as b-bender guitar player, you will of course be able to pick up some tricks and inspiration, but as an education course, I find the DVD has some fundamental shortcomings.

The DVD is not divided into tracks, but runs like one long continuous video. It is therefore difficult to find a particular lesson if you want to repeat a technique or want to use the DVD on and off in smaller pieces.
In addition to this, the licks are not in any way arranged progressively. WR starts very promising showing five different finger positions and holds out the prospect that they are basically in the b-bender technique taught on this DVD. Unfortunately, there is almost non relation between the positions and the licks being demonstrated. One thing does not lead to another in this course. The DVD is apparently produced without didactical considerations.

As I said, there are some inspiration and tips for the novice on the DVD. The prices I've seen on the material however,is quite high, and I do not think that you get bang for the buck. Perhaps it is quit easy to get it as second hand?",1351814400,2,1204,4.621495327102804
