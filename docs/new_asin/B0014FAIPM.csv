3133190,2,B0014FAIPM,"The biggest problem with this film is that it doesn't have an audience. It contains adult language and themes and combines it with ham acting and juvenile humor. Seriously, when was the last time you laughed at a grown man without a car, riding a little girl's bike. And to make this a real side splitter, he rings the bell. I'm surprised they didn't have him arrested for violating helmet laws.

The moovie [sic] starts out good with animated cows in a 60's style credit run. Once it starts...well you wait for it to start. Steve (William Mapother) is the main character. He was run his life and company into the ground. They are the company that developed light sticks. By a freak chance the agricultural dairy business has a need for them and there appears to be a buy out in the making...but not until after a silly board scene.

The characters were lame and not well developed. William Mapother comes across as a dorky Eric Roberts. Wild Bill (Ernie Grunwald) was interesting but not at all developed. Harry (Daniel Baldwin) was too crude to like. Not enough real comedy or drama to make it worth the view.

3133217,2,B0014FAIPM,"Made in 2007 but feels like made for TV circa 1987-slow moving and flat.  So a couple of friends have a struggling glow stick company and struggling personal lives.  FYI there are some mild spoilers, but the plot is so slow you might sleep through most of them.  Luckily for the glow stick company guys a military truck just happens to be carrying a crate of their light sticks through the middle of no where country road-of course, why wouldn't they!  The military truck just happens to have no back and it just so happens-luckily, that crate of glow sticks happens fall off said military truck and then is found by a farmer who is quite inventive.  What would a farmer in the middle of no where do with said glow sticks within a military crate?  He, of course, thinks of a way to use said glow sticks to tell if a cow is in heat!  Yadda-yadda-yadda-boring-slow-moving-plot and they become successful, personal lives fixed, financial trouble fixed!  So, besides the mind-numbingly slow pace and predictable script the ""stars"" don't really do much except complain and rant.  It isn't their hard work or good idea.  Not sure what the point of this is other than to waste some time.",1412553600,2,1180,4.6298076923076925
