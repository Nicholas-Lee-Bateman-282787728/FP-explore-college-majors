2193708,5,B0006SSO36,"This DVD is a wonderful documentary on the life of the most influential fashion designers ever to live.  It documents so many various levels of the fashion world and really gives you an insight not only into his amazing life, but truly into the world of fashion.  It's a must have for any YSL fan and a must have for anyone who loves fashion and the art that is fashion.  Yves Saint Laurent was a man like no other and he will always be remembered as one of the most fabulous men to ever live and grace the every changing world of haute couture and pret-a-porter. Buy this DVD, trust me, you won't regret it and you will tresure it as much as I have and always will.",1125100800,5,666,4.1875
2193709,4,B0006SSO36,"Yves Saint Laurent is one of the greatest  French fashion designers and his work has been raved and worned by fans worldwide. In this 2.5 hrs long documentary, we get to have more intimate look at the life and career of genius through the changes of more than 4 decades in the fashion world. With segments devoted to his fashion shows, and interviews on him as well as on others(influential fashion people) ultimately revealed more about the man behind the glamorous haute coutures.

It's very captivating to see how he became Dior's apprentice at 17 and when Dior died, he took over the job at the age of 21, with a debut show that dazzled the world. Eventually, he resigned from Dior, and just when everyone thought he was making a mistake, he launched his own label and started a smaller couture house of his own, and the result was astonishing as his first YSL collection became a hit. His work was especially adorned by divas like Catherine Deneuve, and even Jackie O.

I especially enjoyed watching him talk about himself in terms of family, love, career, and creativity. ""I never plan what I draw, it just comes to me, and I have no vision of it"". is one of the more interesting things I learned about him. He also openly talked about his passion for couture and resends ready-to-wear. He loved Chanel and Piccaso, and Balenciaga. He preferred Black models, because the colours of the dresses looked better on them and they have fabulous bodies......

The first part of the movie is finished at halfway, and followed by a complete domcumentary on behind the scenes of the preparation of a collection; from illustration to fabrics, toile fittings, to fancy embriodery work, to final fitting. He sits in a room, while his team makes his dream(designs) come true, and they have a model wearing the newly finished piece to let him critique the work. The head of his assistant would say,""Merci Monsieur!"" if it turned out to be the way he imagined it.....

The second part is probably more interesting and worthwhile watching if you are into studying fashion, otherwise you might find it somewhat long and slow to watch the fittings and sewings take place. Well, at least you'll understand why couture is outlandishly expensive.",1112832000,22,2230,4.766839378238342
2193740,5,B0006SSO36,"If you are remotely intrigued by fashion watch this video.
It is a fascinating behind the scenes look into the creative process in the Haute Couture.
Unfortunately, this is a dying tradition and YSL was one of the last great Couturiers.",1408924800,,236,4.780487804878049

2193743,5,B0006SSO36,"The film is engrossing, a thrilling representation of a retiring genius, one France 's greatest souls. Yves, a worthy tribute. No praise too great.",1394409600,,147,5.166666666666667
2193744,5,B0006SSO36,YSL is truly a great and talented person. It is quite sad to see him so fragile and tortured by his own mind. He did not seem to enjoy his brief life because it seems that he is constantly chasing something that is so elusive. He made an impact in the world of design and his name will live forever. This documentary is a good study of a small part of his life. I sometimes think that very creative people are tortured by something in their live,1385769600,,445,4.126436781609195
2193745,4,B0006SSO36,"I liked watching every minute of this.  Nicce to have such a long and comprehensive (it seemed, anyway) look at how it all gets done.",1383177600,,133,4.32
2193746,3,B0006SSO36,"I am not very happy. The DVD does not have anywhere what region it is.
Unfortunately it does not work in my Blue Ray which means I can only watch it on my laptop.
Very unhappy with it.",1373068800,,184,3.8684210526315788
2193747,5,B0006SSO36,"My wife and I  used to have ""Life and Times"" saved on our DVR, until the DVR broke down. I especially love the part that starts with the Proust questionaire and ends with the Betty Catroux interview. All the interviewees except Pierre Berge simply talk about themselves, it seems to me, and with St. Laurent it heightens the sense of vulnerability. Could be too insufferable for some.

Also IMHO the above itself is worth the current given price. The other film is a bonus.",1360627200,,473,4.619047619047619
2193748,5,B0006SSO36,"I LOVE this documentary. You hear and see the man behind the YSL name. You understand his thought process; therefore, appreciating the brand much more.",1357603200,,151,5.08
2193749,5,B0006SSO36,"Not as produced or slick as ""Valentino: The Last Emperor"" (which is fabulous), this is a simple documentary on an extraordinary man. Something almost meditative about it at times. Yves was a deeply complex man, and this gives a beautiful and honest glimpse of him. This is not a documentary for those who just want to be entertained, but rather a fascinating character study at a person who changed the fashion world forever. There is not much footage of his clothing, but that is fine... there are books and websites that cover that.",1350172800,,534,4.752688172043011
2193760,5,B0006SSO36,"If you love fashion... if you love exceptionnal man and creators... you will have as much joy as I did as discovering these interviews as well as his daily work in his atelier... all with deep intimacy and authenticity... As an artist, as a painter and as a photographer... and as, in general, a great admirere of great talent, I loveddddddddddddd it!... my 2 cents :)
I truly hope that you will enjoy the depth of that documentary as much as I did...",1331164800,,451,4.445783132530121
2193761,2,B0006SSO36,"The DVD wasn't as good as I expected.  St. Laurent talked about his life, but did not show many garments.  I expected a runway show of some of his creations, but didn't get one.  I wouldn't buy it again.",1315094400,,203,4.153846153846154
2193762,5,B0006SSO36,"I loved this DVD. Not only is it on a fashion designer and his business that I've admired, but it goes through the bits and pieces a business must go through to bring a line of clothing to fruition. I will watch it many times.",1285372800,,226,4.044444444444444
2193763,5,B0006SSO36,"This engrossing documentary give us a glimpse into an exquisite world of haute couture that no longer exists. The first part of the film is biographical; we learn about Saint Laurent's happy childhood and his early years in Paris. The film moves at a slower pace than most contemporary documentaries; but that's what gives it its charm. The second half of the film shows the day to day activities of his fashion house as Laurent prepares for the 2001 season and it's extraordinary to see the dresses take shape under his direction. It's a stately, dignified way of life that's gone forever.",1250812800,,590,4.794117647058823
2193764,5,B0006SSO36,"Having completed my undergraduate work in Clothing and Textiles (eons ago), I still crave watching the masters create.  The skill of Saint Laurent, Blass, Givenchy, and Chanel among others will never be rivaled.

Although I watch Project Runway and against my better judgment, The Fashion Show, this video of the life and magic of Saint Laurent sparked my desire to once again drag out the dress form, cutting table, and 20 year old sewing machine, and create.

Inspiration is gained by watching on the masters seek perfection in design and detail.",1249084800,6,548,5.0
2193765,5,B0006SSO36,"I love watching this over and over again!  It's a documentary about Yves Saint Laurent hard at work, aided by his assistants and models.  It's like you're there!  What an excellent fashion designer!",1235001600,,198,4.9393939393939394
2193766,5,B0006SSO36,"There have been many designers that have shaped the world of fashion through the years: Balenciaga, Dior, Chanel. But the one who created the many looks still worn today is YSL. The tuxedo look for women, the Safari jacket, color blocking(Mondrian dress), the peasant look. All designed by him.
This documentary is divided into two parts: His first years growing up in Algiers, his move to Paris and his beginnings working for Dior, and then heading the House after Dior's passing when he was just 21. The second part takes place at his atelier, almost 50 years later, working on his collection. You get to see the man at work, bringing his sketches to life, a change here a change there, and the people that help him bring it to reality. You hear him talk, move, answer questions, talk about his life, his acomplishments. You get to see a man who, in spite of who he is, is humble and totally dedicated to his craft. It's about the design, the clothes, the women who wear them, not the fame or the money or the accolades. His friends are also interviewed (Betty Catroux for one), and his mother.
And talk about the reverence, the total respect the people that work for him have for this man. They are dedicated to him, to help him achieve his vision.

I love fashion and the power it has to change the way you feel about yourself and how you present yourself to the world. I bought this DVD to better understand the process of designing and the man himself, and I thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end. If you love fashion as much, you'll enjoy it too.",1230076800,6,1559,4.48943661971831
2193767,5,B0006SSO36,"Having been in the fashion world for more than two decades, this DVD is the best example of what the Couture World is all about, perhaps a vanishing art but Yves was one of the last great real couture designers and this movie demonstrates that to the best ability. For anyone interested in Fashion and art in general, this is perhaps one of the most interesting documents on how the true couture work, men and women with true dedication to the art of drapping and hand work that produces the small miracles in beadwork, and all elements that made a couture garment different from any other. True understanding of the way a dress should look and how it flows like air. I recommend it highly to anyone going into the fashion world or already in the fashion world.",1175472000,9,761,4.521739130434782
2193768,3,B0006SSO36,"After I saw *Seamless*, I was recommended to see this documentary of Yves St. Laurent.

Other than the interesting facts about YSL and his works, this was somewhat a boring documentary.  And it didn't help that it was a long one.  I think what made it mundane was that it was slow-paced and that there was a lot of silent conversational gaps from the interviewees.  I understand that YSL was old and somewhat ill during this documentary.  However, his friends and colleagues were also not quite fluid in articulating their thoughts and memories.  It felt like they had to think and re-think before saying anything, like there was a darker or a secret side to YSL that shouldn't surface.

Again, I say that there were some interesting facts, such as YSL and Christian Dior and other stuff.  However, I just couldn't wait for the documentary to be over.  I could've just save myself time just by reading about his life online.  However, I did like seeing some of his designs on the models.  Although, I did wish the documentary had shown more.",1163376000,6,1041,4.664835164835165
2193769,5,B0006SSO36,"The 2nd movie (5 Ave Marceau) is a behind-the-scenes look at the creation and development of YSL's 2001 spring-summer couture collection. For fans of the rarified world of haute couture, we get to see the design process from sketch to toile to final preparation of dresses with all the minute and perfectionist adjustments made to hems, linings, collars, flounces etc. YSL's regular house models are featured including the evergreen Amalia. His muse Loulou de la Falaise Klossowski and also Anne Marie Munoz are there by his side to give their opinions and support. For once we also get to see his chiefs of ateliers working out his sketches and trying to come up with creations that match what he dreams of. It's a hushed temple of design with everyone contributing to the final designs. We get to see how fabrics are draped and chosen, decisions on embroidery, how the style of the model's walk can affect the design, how some colours or fabrics are rejected and replaced; successful creations are paraded by the house models in front of YSL and others and greeted by cries of ""ravishing"", ""beautiful!"" and ""sensational"". I only wish that the 1hour plus movie was even longer. There's only a little snippet of the actual fashion show tacked onto the end of the movie but that's not really the point of the movie. The style of filming is slightly distanced - we observe the team observing the designs and sort of listen into their conversations. Totally recommended if you love couture and love YSL. In French with English sub-titles.",1135036800,36,1535,4.840304182509506
