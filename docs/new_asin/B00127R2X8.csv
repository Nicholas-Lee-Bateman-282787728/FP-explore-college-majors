8244489,4,B00127R2X8,"Hegemonic masculinity and violence definitely runs rampant in this series; that being said, this anime is obviously not for young viewers. The main character's mother is a bit on the nut-so side, the father isn't too far behind, and the person on the front of the 1st season's box there is supposed to be 13-years-old. Judging from all of those things it should be pretty obvious that this is not a brain food anime. It's, more or less, fighting, fighting, and more fighting. When I bought this series I went in expecting as much and therefore was not disappointed. I was actually very pleased with this purchase.

The best advice that I can give you is that if you don't mind watching something that's like a UFC/Mortal Combat hybrid saturated in extremely heavy `WTF' overtones (for lack of a better example), then this is the anime for you. If you're looking for something that you can seriously watch and evaluate for ""deeper meanings"" and that has a ""grade 'A' plot"", then don't even bother. It's a fighting anime; nothing more, nothing less. So don't go in expecting to see much more than that or you'll have otherwise wasted both your time and your money.",1215648000,5,1162,4.696078431372549
8244490,2,B00127R2X8,"This is an Anime that I have heard people rave about.  I honestly did not like it. The premise is that a fighting tournament is taking place to determine the best fighter in the world.  Each fight is extremely boring and all of the fighters are generic and uninteresting.  There is little or no character development, period. The animation is inconsistent (several characters look completely different during different episodes.) The show ends in a letdown fight between Baki and His Brother (who he doesn't know is his brother until near the time of the fight.)  This is an anime that I would avoid personally, but some individuals may like it.  If you are into tournament style anime, then I would suggest looking elsewhere. Dragonball Z, Yu Yu Hakusho, Naruto, and others are all better at showing tournament fighting than this show.",1213833600,3,836,4.900709219858156
