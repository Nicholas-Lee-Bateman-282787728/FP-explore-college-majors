Like one other reviewer here, I'm also disappointed not to be able to fast forward to review through the material - esp. as it's the sort of film that's worth analysing shot-by-shot.",1065571200,6,285,4.836734693877551
533924,4,6302969778,"Roman Polanski directed his first feature film in a hale mood: we are sure of what's going on but the characters seem to be too anxious to reflect on their own behavior. The competition is based on a woman (Christine) and she lets the two men become more and more dangerous to each other. It's a subtle study on vanity. As we become more and more involved, the characters seem to become more vulnerable: they gain their own complexity never losing a truly human resemblance with each other.

533925,3,6302969778,"I watched this movie last night, with subtitles which made it harder to watch the facial expressions etc.  I liked it, didn't love it.  Not nearly as captivating as Rosemary's baby, which I give 5 stars.  A married couple pick up a young hitch hiker and then take him sailing on their boat, all the while seeming not to like him.  The husband belittles him, the hitch hiker seems a little mentally ""off"" and the tension builds as these people keep toying with each other, esp. after the appearance of a very large knife. It is interesting...there just seems to be something missing...I guess that I really never cared about any of the characters much.  The husband seems like a jerk, the wife seems cold and the hitch hiker is a bit psycho.  I would have been disappointed had I paid for it, one viewing was enough.",996105600,3,815,4.510204081632653

533927,1,6302969778,"I am a Roman Polanski fan, but this movie, despite its lingering and sometime elegant photography, has no coherent center -- not sure if it was meant to be an art film or a piece of art, because it does not have any  decipherable narrative that pulls you along.

533928,5,6302969778,"This film isn't among the top 100 in the AFI listing, but it should be.  I agree with the previous comments about its potential dis-favor with modern viewers, but as an artistic film this one ranks way up there.  The  photograpy is superb and in a medium of black and white.
The story line  is about a wealty husband who thinks very little about his wife's  abilities, claiming that she would be nothing without him.  The couple  picks up a teen on the road on the way to sailing, and the husband begins a  competive power struggle with the more sensitive and naive hitch-hiker.  The resulting response is a secretive and rebellious affair between the  wife and the teen.
Nearly all of the film takes place in a cramped  sailboad in a lake in Poland.  The filming is absolutely beautiful.  The  overall tone is very relaxing, and at times slow-paced for  ""modern"" action seekers.  It has a ""retro"" sixties feel  to it with a solo sax as musical accompliment.  This is an intelligent  movie for people who really love good photography.",939081600,13,1034,4.613259668508287

For me this film is beautiful in every way, certainly visually!  The husband's character flaws only make him more appealing because he also shows his good and responsible side as well. For me he remained likable no matter what he did (maybe that was due to the very cool Leon Niemczyk who played the husband) :). The relationship with his wife is complicated but I got the feeling they would remain together because there seemed to be a deep attachment to each other.

With that kind of an ending Polanski sort of allowed the audience to conclude the story in any way they wanted. I know how I wanted it to end.",1421020800,,796,4.455172413793103

I had heard about it from reading Roman's autobiography so Id thought I should watch it and see what jumpstarted his career in the film industry. The whole movie is in polish, so if you don't like reading subtitles or haven't had a language course in polish, then this film might not be for you. The film takes place mostly on a boat throughout the whole movie, so it's a little clausterphobic at times. The film has a really slow settle pace to it, and there is really no action to the film except for a few knife brandishings and a couple of verbal fights, but thats about it.

534204,5,6302969778,"I hated these ""Essential Art House"" releases when they first came out because I couldn't see the point. These movies were put out already from Janus in the Criterion Collection. The box sets didn't seem to group the movies all that well (they put this movie in the same set with Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast with Kurosawa's Rashomon and Bergman's Wild Strawberries? Now that's pretty damn random!).  The two crucial differences between this and the Criterion are no bonus features and the cheaper individual price.

The still rotting US economy makes these individual single disc releases appealing but not by much. The new Criterion of Knife in the Water is $18 higher in price while the used price difference is only $8. The Criterion releases also go on sale often too.

Some of these single disc no frill releases make sense to buy instead of the Criterion. Some of the movies have very long rambling audio commentary from film historians. These commentaries seem to want to wreck your enjoyment of a movie you already bought. It's the same as what the schools of literary criticism have done to literature. You may have once enjoyed the sweet beauty of reading but after analyzing it, not so much.

534206,3,6302969778,"Released in 1962, KNIFE IN THE WATER (Polish: Nz w wodzie) was director Roman Polanski's full-length debut. Married couple Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk) and Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka) are driving to the marina when they pick up a hitchhiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz). Though Andrzej is initially angry at the young man for standing the middle of the road, he invites him to come sailing. Once on the boat, tension arises between the two men because of Krystyna sexual appeal and the hitchhiker's poverty versus Andrzej's affluence. Not only is the title a metaphor for the boat as it moves through the lake, but it also refers to the intimidating knife that the young man carries with him.

KNIFE IN THE WATER is entertaining enough. The cinematography on the lake and the low-key soundtrack by jazz legend Krzysztof Komeda are memorable. But personally I don't find this to be an especially great film. It feels derivative of Italian cinema of the time, without an original touch. The casting of the weathered, 32 year-old Malanowicz as a 19 year-old student undermines its credibility. I suspect that the film gained so much attention on release due to its risque nature (especially novel in a film from the Eastern Bloc) instead of its intrinsic merit.

The Criterion Collection release of this film consists of two DVDs. The first DVD contains the film with subtitles. There is no audio commentary, but English-language interviews with Polanski and his co-writer Jerzy Skolimowski are provided as extras. I must express some frustration with the subtitles, as much dialogue is left unsubtitled, especially Krystyna's lines.

The second DVD contains nothing about KNIFE IN THE WATER, but rather makes available Polanski's early short films leading up to the full-length debut. As I go through classic cinema, I'm not yet interested in short films, so I'll pass over them in this review.",1353283200,,1877,5.087662337662338

534209,5,6302969778,"Knife in the Water, Roman Polanski's first film (1962), is widely considered to be one of the two greatest directorial debuts in film history next to Citizen Kane.

An alpha male and his young, voluptuous wife pick up a hitchhiker and invite him for a day of sailing. The two roosters spend the following day and night posturing for the attention of the sumptuous female. A challenging premise for a 94 minute film? Most assuredly but Polanski pulls it off nicely. Leon Niemczyk is superb as the cocksure Andrezej. Jolanta Umecka, in her film debut, is tantalizing as the sexually ripe Krystyna. Zygmunt Malanowicz gives a decent performance as the unsure, young drifter. Not satisfied with Malanowicz's voice, Polanski ended up dubbing over it with his own. Polish jazz legend Krzysztof Komeda's score was cool at the time but rankles today. Jerzy Lipman's cinematography is outstanding. This edition has some great bonus features including several early Polanski shorts.",1276300800,,972,5.151898734177215
534210,5,6302969778,"If this hadn't been a Criterion disk, I would have thought at first that it was a panned-and-scanned copy of a widescreen film, the use of off-screen space is so profound. And it feels, at first, like it should be widescreen -- the empty landscape, long straight road, the couple sitting far apart in the front seat of their car -- it must have been a shock to a lot of cinemagoers 45 years ago. THIS is Polish cinema?  This looks like French or Italian cinema -- Antonioni, or Godard, or Truffaut perhaps.  And though there are some superficial resemblances, finally, it's something quite different.

Our couple - middle-aged Adrezej and his much younger wife Krystyna - pick up a young hitchhiker (never named) and the older man invites him - or perhaps coerces him - along for a ride on their sailboat.  All the elements are in place for a thriller, a murder perhaps or a sexual game play; the older man, cynical and intellectual and clearly hiding much of himself; the younger and quite attractive wife who seems quite bored - though of him, of the sailing, or of life itself we cannot tell - she is a cypher through much of the film; the young man whose purposes and desires are never clear, probably even to himself.

Tension, tension, tension -- yet little happens.  And when it does, do we really care?  Should we?  We're concerned I suppose to see whether the status quo is broken, to see if the wife and husband come to verbal blows, or the young man and the increasingly sadistic husband enter a physical altercation. When finally there is an ""event"" that seems to forbode a major change, even a catastrophe in the situation, we wonder if it will even matter....

I loved the photography, the beautiful tight, cramped and yet desolate compositions of boat, a human or three, and water and sky; the jazzy score by Krzysztof Komeda; the acting, even of the much-maligned Jolanta Umecka as Krystyna, who seemed to me to have the perfect blankness for such a role (she could have been wonderful for Antonioni); but I was unmoved while watching, at first, and even at the end rather unsure. It really wasn't until a day later, thinking it over, that I grasped the greatness of it all, the showing of an event of profound internal significance -- possibly to all 3 characters -- but of no practical importance whatsoever.  Even if it is a life-changing experience, how can it be explained?  Everything is internalized, and visualized only on the faces.  Is this the first ""thriller where nothing happens""? I don't know, but it is certainly one of the more successful examples.

The Criterion disc looks and sounds excellent; you don't get all the extras on this Essential Arthouse edition, which I think in this case are probably worth it - but if you just want the film, here it is as fresh as it was 50 years ago.",1266710400,6,2820,4.604790419161676
534211,5,6302969778,Polish with Wnglish subtitles. Couple pick up hitch hiker as they go the lake country and take him on thir sail boat. Skillfully done with only three characters.,1265155200,,161,4.785714285714286
534212,4,6302969778,"I think most people know who Roman Polanski is.  I mean, he's made such classics as `Chinatown' and the recent Oscar darling `The Pianist'.  Sadly, even if you know who he is, most likely you've never seen his debut film `Noz w Wodzie'.  This small yet startlingly powerful character study pits man against man in what may be one of the better directorial debut's in cinema.

The films premise sounds rather simple.  You have a couple who are getting ready for a day of sailing when a young hitchhiker jumps out in front of their car.  They reluctantly give him a lift, and then for no apparent reason they invite him to sail with them for the day.  The couple is already at odds with one another.  The husband is quite older than his bride, and maybe that plays into their confliction, but this new face (a young man around the same age as the wife) presents a further struggle for the couple.

This is where the film transcends its `simple' plot.

The husband and the hitchhiker find themselves at odds as they struggle to outdo the other.  In everything they feel as though their male ego is being bruised by the presence of the other.  The husband, no doubt trying to prove his superiority, invited the hitchhiker to join them thinking he was an easy target.  This young man is more than up for the challenge though, and that proves to be almost too much for the husband to take.  The wife seems almost confused by the actions of the men around her, but as the day trickles away she begins to disgust both of them.  As the two men continue to look for ways to humiliate the other they bring themselves to a dark place, where one contemplates murder and the other contemplates adultery.

The film works almost perfectly.  Polanski knows how to build tension very well, and he delivers a fluid and tightly woven film with some nicely crafted performances as well.  I will say that the film can, at times, feel long.  The score, which I appreciated at first, kind of gave some of the scenes a soap opera vibe and I think that took away from the serious nature of the film.  The acting is good, but never truly great.  The two leading men (Leon Niemczyk and Zygmunt Malanowicz) are very good in scenes, but Jolanta Umecka is merely `there', never really taking hold of the potential within her character.

The films final moments are brilliantly realized, and the final act of dominance that comes is superbly understated (I love how this film plays everything so small so as to create a beautiful illusion that nothing that extraordinary is happening).  This is a must see film that is elevated by Polanski's marvelous direction (hard to believe this is his debut) that exemplifies intensity with every sharp turn of the camera.",1241049600,,2729,4.581443298969072
534213,5,6302969778,"Just saw this film and it has held up very well.  A chamber piece almost entirely on a smallish sailboat between three characters. Most dynamic parts of the movie are the shots, close-ups, camera angles, which do compare favorably with Citizen Kane.  There isn't hardly 30 sec. of wasted footage.  Very subtle symbolism and building tension in this amoral morality tale that isn't about resolution, but the conflicts we inevitably wade through.  Great work.",1228089600,,457,5.135135135135135
534286,4,6302969778,"Roman Polanski is at his best as a filmmaker when he focuses on the realist and small moments of horror in a human life. When he goes a bit overboard, and into the grotesque or surreal, such as in The Fearless Vampire Killers, or: Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are In My Neck, Rosemary's Baby, or Chinatown, his films tend to lose their way, even if still good. When his focus remains tightly on the real, such as in Repulsion or The Pianist, his films are amongst the best on screen. His very first feature film, 1962's Knife In The Water (Nz W Wodzie), is more in line with the latter films, and as such, is one of the best debut films in cinema history, and was even a nominee for Best Foreign Language Film at the 1963 Academy Awards, where it lost to Federico Fellini's 8.
  Filmed in black and white, not long after Polanski finished film school, the 94 minute film features only three characters- not a single other actor, not even an extra, and is a taut psychological exploration of masculinity and testosterone. Yet, despite that, it's a stretch to term the film a `thriller,' as many critics have. There is very little action in the film, at least in a material sense. The real crux of the film revolves about the mental games that the two male characters play with each other, to impress the lone female in their group. In a sense, the film has much in common with many of the American television dramas of the 1950s, even though it was filmed on a real lake.
  The film opens with a married couple driving in the countryside, early one Sunday morning. They are headed to their boat on the lake. He is a fortysomething, dark-haired sportswriter and avid sailor, named Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk), while his brunet wife, Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka), is a bit younger, nearing thirty, and at first seems a bit chunky and nebbishy, as she wears cat-like granny glasses. As the film progresses, she will appear more and more svelte and sexy, and it is this subtle evolution which seems to kick the two males into overdrive. The third character is a blond hitchhiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz), in his early twenties, whose name is never revealed throughout the film. Andrzej nearly runs him down on the road, then offers him a ride, seemingly to show off his prowess in front of his wife. He rides with them to the deserted marina, and is about to take off, when Andrzej offers to let him come on the trip on their sailboat, the Christine. After first declining, the young man accepts, stating he knew Andrzej would ask. This is his first upping of the ante, as he lets it be known that he is no naf. Krystyna merely watches the two men tangle, early on.... Another thing that sets the film apart from lesser works is that it was very cogent in its critiques of Soviet dominated Poland, yet it still works today at a more personal level. As example, in its day, there was a direct stab at the supposed classlessness of a Communist society, for the married couple are obviously well off Party apparatchiks- replete with a fancy car, yacht and apartment, who worry if their windshield wipers will be stolen, if they leave their car for a day. They are stolen, at film's end, but even such a worry says much for the dire state of things in the Soviet bloc. The young hitchhiker is the common man, the young idealistic sort that totalitarian states despise, and a good deal of the tension between the men has to do not only with testosterone, but with class differences. But, it is the testosteronic tension that still resonates and carries the film today. Also, there is a Twilight Zone-like otherworldliness to this film that also resonates. After all, it's a Sunday morning, there are many other boats docked in the marina, but only the three characters in the film are boating, as if they are occupying some usually unseen portion of an Apocalyptic film's world.
  Knife In The Water is a quiet film, unlike showier Hollywood knockoffs, thus why it still works, and has not dated. It could be set in any part of the world over the last hundred or so years, for the setup is timeless, even if Polanski's denouement is unique. If Andrzej wins, and the youth is really dead, there is the classic might makes right motif. If the youth dispatches Andrzej, then there is the classic father/son conflict, but if the film ends with all three surviving, and with the woman holding the upper hand in a conflicted state between the three, then the narrative has taken a turn toward realism and depth with strong claims to being great art. Polanski makes all the right choices in this film. That all the `action' takes place in about a twenty-four hour period only heightens the intensity of the subtle gamesmanship on all three parties' parts, and allows the narrative to be both naturalistic, yet also classically dramatic. When one can get `the best of both worlds,' to such a degree, one is accomplishing alot, and Roman Polanski's Knife In The Water does that and much more. Would more art supply the `much more' it often promises, works like this film would not surprise and delight the viewer to such a satisfying degree.",1221264000,3,5108,4.595394736842105
534287,5,6302969778,"Before he gave the world ""Chinatown,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Macbeth,"" ""The Pianist"" and ""Tess,"" the great Polish director Roman Polanski released his first feature film (1962) ""Knife in the Water."" It is much better than I remember since I saw it when it was first shown in the U. S. The plot is simple and straight-forward. A Polish couple, Leon Niemczyk and Jolanta Umecka, pick up a young hitchhiker Zygmunt Malanowicz and invite him to go sailing with them on a beautiful Polish lake. These three are the only characters in this low budget film although the lack of money certainly did not affect its quality. The movie teems with sexual energy as well as a certain scary quality that Polanski of course was to perfect in later works. Much is made of the hitcher's knife (phallic symbol?) which he bandies about and the viewer is never certain that something ominous is not about to happen. There isn't a lot of dialogue although not much is necessary so the subtitles aren't much of a bother.

Shot in beautiful black and white, the film often has the look of still photography. Some of the frames are suitable for framing. Polanski in a very informative interview included with the DVD discusses his art school and still photography background. He also says that the female in the movie had no previous acting experience and that he ""discovered"" her at a public swimming pool and that his own voice was dubbed for the young hitchhiker whose voice was too high pitched.

The beautiful cinematography, the fine directing and understated acting make this film a joy to watch.",1185494400,3,1576,4.790441176470588

You could watch ""Knife in the Water"" in Polish without any subtitles and still get chills.  A young, privileged couple pick up a hitchhiker and take him out on their boat for the day.  That's it.  The rest is the suspense that builds between the three, especially between the two men, almost destined by biology and the nature of confined spaces to fight it out over the girl, at least symbolically, if not literally, to the death.

534289,5,6302969778,"The first Polish film to be nominated for a Foreign Language Oscar, Roman Polanski's ""Knife in the Water"" is one of the most impressive director's debuts I've seen.

The story is simple. A wealthy couple on its way to spend a weekend on their yacht picks up a young and attractive hitchhiker. The middle-aged husband, a successful and cynical sportswriter invites the young man on board, perhaps to show off his nice yacht, his seamanship, and eventually, his superiority. His young and sexy wife does not say much but as the yacht moves along and tension between two men rises, she seems to enjoy the presence of a passenger and the obvious competition between them for her attention.

Made of the very simple material, the film is a brilliant psychological thriller that shows the young writer-director's extraordinary ability to create menace on the screen throughout the profound study of the characters' deep hidden emotions. Not as widely known as ""Chinatown"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Knife in the Water"" is the perfect introduction to the work of the director whose craft in creating disturbing studies of anger, humiliation, fear, and sexuality is truly remarkable.",1171843200,2,1172,5.098958333333333

This is basically the dramatic premise; the viewers and the couple do not know anything about this sinister and disturbing character. And the legitimate strength of this clever film resides precisely in the next step to follow, and this unpredictability will generate in the audience an authentic cornucopia of diverse anguishes or fears.

Filmed with visible economy resources, the egregious gifts of Polanski blossom from the initial frames, nourished and supported by admirable traveling, angle shots  and mesmerizing close ups.

The movie possesses a discrete charm, visibly influenced by the raising French New Wave (Breathless) though its profound expressive burden derivates from the theatrical environment.

A must-see of undeniable historical importance.",1141862400,2,1002,5.6092715231788075
534291,5,6302969778,"A married couple (played by Leon Niemczyk and Jolanta Umecka) on their way to the harbor and a yachting outing pick up a young hitchhiker (Zygmunt Malanowicz). From then on the two men engage each other in a childish but brutal war of wills, as each tries to outbully the other. Malanowicz joins the couple on their yacht and near the end falls overboard; when he doesn't surface Niemczyk dives in after him. A short while later Malanowicz re-emerges, hops back on board, and makes love with Umecka. Niemczyk and Umecka later confront each other with some upsetting truths about the incident.

This was Roman Polanski's first feature film, and it reveals what a master he was already; he knows exactly how to build the tension between Niemczyk and Malanowicz, heightening it ever more by having Umecka, who doesn't say or do much, always in the picture prancing around in her bikini or short sun dresses: the sexual tension is intense. Polanski's use of symbols - the knife, the pole, the wind directing the boat this way and that - is also masterful. Some think this is Polanski's best movie or that he never made better movies once he came to America, but they must be forgetting CHINATOWN. The second disc of short features is okay, but not up to the feature film.",1138752000,5,1267,4.681614349775785
534292,4,6302969778,"""Knife in the Water"", an early Roman Polanski effort is a simple, unfettered yet analytical probe of the human condition.  Filmed principally aboard a sailboat in the lake region of northern Poland the film examines the potentially explosive interactions between three people confined in this restricted setting.

A squabbling couple pick up a young hitchhiker on their way to the marina where they are about to embark on a weekend sailing trip.  The husband an arrogant, bourgeoise writer Andrzej decides to invite the young man along for reasons that will soon become apparent.  The hitchhiker, a landlubber is initially ill at ease on the water.  The wife Krystyna is sympathetic to his plight.  Andrzej however uses this as a wedge to commence berating the boy to help evoke within himself feelings of superiority.

The drama continues with the writer putting down the boy to bolster his own ego in front of his wife.  A storm hits and the group in forced below decks where the confrontation continues and threatens to erupt in violence.

Ultimately the plot reaches a climax when the writer throws the boys treasured knife into the water causing the boy, who could not swim, to dive in after it and apparently drown.

Polanski using a cast of only three demonstrates his immense skill in fabricating a taut drama with a nicely conceived plot and very decent cinematography on a shoestring budget.",1132790400,4,1401,4.948717948717949

The couple is not a happy one, and the overbearing husband, irritated at his spouse's admiration of the young hitchhiker's beauty, apparently feels the need to dominate him as well.  What follows is a subtle jockeying for position (not the ""thriller"" it is advertised to be) that was somewhat interesting but not terribly involving.  If you love sailing, you may be the ideal audience for this film.  The actors appear to be sailors and director Roman Polanski (in his first film) gives us lots of wide, unbroken takes of the characters controlling the boat.

Like many other reviewers, I was also annoyed by the disabling of several functions of the DVD player.  Unless you are quite sure that you will love this film, I recommend that you avoid the annoyance of dealing with this disk.",1131753600,5,903,4.756410256410256
534294,5,6302969778,"Three people aboard a fairly leisurely sailboat excursion on a Polish lake, sounds rather dull, but Roman Polanski's first feature length film is an absorbing intense drama in which even the mundane manual rigors of sailing becomes an exciting metaphor of human manipulation. The three characters, (the only three people seen in the entire movie, as a cost saving measure Polanski tells us in the DVD extra), are as perfectly formed and developed, understated and powerful, as we could expect from an Ingmar Bergman troupe of actors. Unlike most DVD extra director interviews, Polanski's inclusion of surprising facts about the film actually enhances the viewing of it. We learn of the difficulties involved with getting a film accepted by the then, (1962), socialist minded, communist controlled Polish film board, which explains some unusual dialogue concerning the difficulties of being a university student. The dialogue was added only after the censor board determined the film was of no social value.  The actress, Jolanta Umecka, in an accomplished solid performance, was discovered at a municipal swimming pool, specifically for the casting of the film, and had no previous acting credentials. The actor, Zygmunt Malanowicz, had an inappropriate high pitched voice, so it was dubbed by Polanski's own speaking voice. The film itself is perfect satisfying drama. The DVD extras, including several Polanski student films, makes it shine all the more.",1131235200,24,1456,5.385964912280702
534295,3,6302969778,"Let me say right off: this was a pretty good movie.  The direction was very good, the cinematography was beautiful (especially when they're on open water much of the time), it was a bit slow, but that speed felt right for what was going on.

But at least 30% of the movie didn't have subtitles and, since I don't speak Polish, that's a lot of the movie that I missed.  Granted, I could pick some of it up from context, but in a movie with so little dialogue, every bit matters.  I don't understand how the vaunted Criterion can translate Japanese and Korean with ease, but not be able to get a good Polish translation.

There wasn't much of a story and sometimes it felt more like a sailing movie than a thriller, but this is a movie one should watch just to see how good direction can elevate a story.",1130371200,5,802,4.28476821192053

534338,3,6302969778,"This slight yet compelling film worked its way into the NY Times' list of ""1000 best films ever made,"" so I thought I'd give it a look.  Like most Americans who came of age in the ""Star Wars"" era, I've always found foreign films to be nearly impenetrable, for the most part, so I'm a bit handicapped by the way I've become accustomed to Hollywood spoon-feeding stories to me without a lot of subtext.....and this is a film brimming with subtext like a Hemingway novel.

The film opens with a couple taking a silent Sunday drive to the marina for a day of sailing.  The tension is palpable; this couple, as one will later sing about on a dare, has lost the passion of their relationship.  They encounter a teenaged hitchhiker who hails them by standing in the middle of the road; the husband says he should have run the guy over but angrily accedes to his wife's unspoken desire to give him a ride.  This pair knows each other quite well.

For some bizarre reason they take the hitching teen sailing with them, and while this is later explained I never bought the explanation as to why they would invite him or as to why he would accept, when he apparently has someplace farther down the road and this ride was only part of the way to his destination.  Since the entire film hangs on their decision to sail, all three on a sloop, everything that follows is IMO tainted by lack of a plausible explanation.  Ultimately it's a Hemingway-ish unspoken he-man ""king of the mountain"" competition, apparently.

One cannot fault director Roman Polanski's choice of camera angles, the cinematography (reminds me of the Swedish films of the time), or the inerrant acting skills of the three (this is critical because there are only three human characters on screen for the duration; one could certainly make a case for nature being the fourth character and the student's knife as the fifth).  Ultimately the story has a satisfying payoff, and one can even accept the gamesmanship that goes on among the various relationships within this triangle.  But the fatal flaw, to my view, is the inexplicable decision of the writer to invite the student to sail with them, and the equally inexplicable decision of the student to accept.  The only plausible explanation to me would be mutually macho posturing, something so banal to me that it's as bad as having no explanation at all.

I never did care for Hemingway.",1110412800,6,2396,4.6761904761904765
534339,4,6302969778,"I recently saw ""Knife in the Water"" for the first time.  It was in Polish with subtitles which always means that the viewer has to watch intently.  That was OK because the actors all acted intently.  This is one of those European-style movies of the 1960's where people confront themselves.  Some of these movies do so in often outlandish settings.  However, the setting in ""Knife in the Water"" was so casual that I was beginning to wonder what could possibly happen to create a meaningful story.  I was gradually able to understand how the setting was able to work out quite well.

The plot, for lack of a better term, has a couple in their 30's pick up a 19 year-old hitchhiker.  They do so after a near-disasterous ""run-in"" and the relationship between husband and hitchhiker becomes the focus of our attention.  The couple is on their way to a Sunday outing in their sailboat.  Hitchhiking is so bad on a Sunday (apparently few private cars in Poland and the truckers take the day off) that the couple invites the hitchhiker to join them.  This is about the point where I started to wonder, ""Where the heck is this movie going?""  However, the husband starts acting like a ship's captain treating the boy like a servant and he, in turns asserts his independence.  This friction is what carries the movie.  That may not sound like much but the subtlety of the script, direction and acting makes for a very introspective movie.  It explores the relationships of one to another (although these people should have realized early on that they didn't belong together).  The conflict escalates later in the movie and we are witness to the extreme examples of our inability to properly relate to one another.  I had figured out a couple of different ways for the movie to end but neither of them were used.  The actual ending left the picture unended.  A choice needed to be made; what was the right one?  In essence, the director left that up to the audience to decide.

If this film is not noteworthy for anything else, it is important as the first film by the talented director, Roman Polanski.  After seeing his recent movie, ""The Pianist"", I was reminded what a genius Polanski is.  Much of that genius is present in ""Knife in the Water"" although this movie will be more limited in its' appeal.  If you like the writings of Camus and Sartre or the films of Bergman, this should be quite an enjoyable film to watch.  If you find that stuff boring or irrelevant, you'll probably react the same way to ""Knife in the Water"".  Personally, I liked it.",1100131200,4,2545,4.6
534340,4,6302969778,"A fascinating, suspensful film debut for Roman Polanski, who already shows great promise with his amazingly original camera angles and creative shots. However, Criterion allowed Polanski to dictate the terms of the disc in which the step back/forward function is disabled. This is maddening, especially if one misses a subtitle or two when pondering some of his amazing shots.
Another complaint I have is about the subtitles. I don't speak Polish, but it seems to me there is a lot of spoken dialogue that is not translated into English. I can recall several instances when the characters speak, but no subtitles appear. A harmless error, or a glaring mistake? I don't have an answer.
This doesn't detract from the movie itself, which is excellent. Five stars would have been given if not for these flaws. However, I do hope Criterion does not repeat the very rude mistake of disabling disc functions in any other future editions of their releases.

534341,2,6302969778,"I have to say that the pretentious move of the Director to disable DVD navigation is so irritating that it distracts from the movie, and may create in you a desire to fire the disc against the wall.
What do DVD controls have to do with the movie anyway? Is it supposed to make us feel like we're at the theatre? Well, we're not. And unless Roman Polanski is willing to buy me a 52 inch TV set to go along with the experience, I wish he'd keep his hands off.
Further, I don't see it mentioned anywhere that in addition to disabling the scan features, the resume function is also gone. So, let's say, you have to go to the bathroom; answer the phone; exit the building due to a fire alarm; whatever. Well, make sure you use Pause, and leave it that way, or else the disc will start over. If you accidentally push Stop, which is what I do, the disc will start from the beginning and you'll lose your place. And you can't scan to find it. So, I guess you're supposed to watch the movie all over again.

One tip for you if you do get the DVD: some Sony DVD players have an ""instant replay"" feature, and this actually *does* work, I figured out after the fact.

534344,5,6302969778,"Roman Polanski's Knife in the Water is a masterful piece of filmmaking, and surprisingly the director's first full-length feature. To the uninitiated, Polanski is the man who's vision gave a signature edge to films such as Chinatown, The Pianist, and the film adaptation of Rosemary's Baby.
A graduate of the state-run (and communist backed) Polish Film School, Polanski made the controversial effort with his first film to not only avoid any state propoganda, but to actually call into question the very topics that nearly every Polish film to date had been required to avoid; namely the interaction between the upper and lower class, or more accurately the ""haves"" versus the ""have nots.""
The film revolves around a wealthy man, Andrzej, his attractive wife Krystyna, and a young, unnamed hitchiker that Andrzej decides to bring along on the couple's evening out on a boat, more to toy with him than anything else.
The first thing that will probably strike most people about the film is the absolute harmony within each frame, especially once the trio pushes out on the lake. Polanski favors very long, complicated still shots in which the characters may move in and out of frame several times, but the angles are always in such a place as to accent, and occasionally even generate, the tension that permeates the entire movie. In addition, the weather in the film is nearly a character in and of itself, and overall the feeling of being on a boat and out in the elements is portrayed so incredibly that you're practically feeling the water splashing on your face. Quite remarkable for a mono, black and white movie shot in the early 60's on a handheld.
Of course, the scenery can add to a film, but what really makes it is the characters and their interplay, and rarely is this more important, or executed so well, as in Knife in the Water. While the title of the film seems to evoke something like Cape Fear, there's neither murder nor any real violence to speak of in the film. The knife of the title refers to the knife the young man carries on him, which he explains as being useful in the woods, but ""useless on the water."" It also acts as a rather obvious phallic symbol, changing hands as one man bests the other in seemingly trivial contests of significance, each trying to outdo the other as the wife essentially throws gasoline on a barely subdued fire.
I won't ruin the story or the events within it, but suffice to say that there are very marked levels of subtlety that come across, and the film plays wonderfully with the idea of the ""unspoken but obvious"". The dialouge is terse and typically very brief; it's what is unsaid that stings the most.
As far as the disc set itself, Criterion once again shows everyone why they're the first and last name in home film collection. The movie itself looks absolutely beautiful, with just the right amount of fine film grain, but nothing else. Distortion is nonexistant, and the picture is exactly as sharp as it should be. The sound is only in mono, but everything comes across perfectly clear, a critical point in a film such as this.
In addition, we get a very funny and informative interview with Polanski and the film's co-screenwriter Jerzy Skolimowski, which is very much worth the time to watch.
Disc 2 is a real treat for film fans, as it contains eight of Polanski's short films made while he was in film school. These rare gems illustrate how Polanski's style was developed, and even display some stylistic tendencies that he dropped before moving on to feature films. These will be more interesting to those studying film than anyone else, but the fact that they are included at all is a very nice addition indeed, and Criterion certaintly deserves a good number of brownie points for it.
In the end, this is a fascinating film delivered in a fantastic package that every film buff should have a copy of. Fantastic stuff all around.",1069545600,12,3902,4.714494875549049
