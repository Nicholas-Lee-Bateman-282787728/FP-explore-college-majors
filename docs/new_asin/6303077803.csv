7837817,5,6303077803,A friend of mine recommended this movie to me because he came to the United States from Romania.  He said it was a pretty decent representation of life in Romania before the fall of Caucescu.  I really enjoyed this movie even though I really couldn't relate to aspects of it as an American and I hope I don't ever have to relate to those.  The acting was excellent and so was some of the cinematography.  Especially some of the scenes of the run down areas of Romania.,1038182400,6,468,4.344827586206897
