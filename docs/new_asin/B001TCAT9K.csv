3789120,3,B001TCAT9K,"I always liked the Oakridge energy but too much talking, very little from early concerts, and age kept this from rating higher with me.  The blend and quality in their voices is gone in my opinion and thus not too enjoyable watching for an hour.",1251417600,,245,4.444444444444445
3789121,5,B001TCAT9K,A great one to add to your Oak Ridge Boy collection. This also gives you insight into how the boys were raised on gospel and history of the guys and the music they sing. If you like the Gaither Homecoming videos you will like this one also. Can't wait for another one like this.,1250035200,2,278,4.166666666666667

3789123,5,B001TCAT9K,"Excellent entertainment.  Loaned it out to friends and had to fight to get it back!  Offers a good short history of a group with a long history of producing phenonimal harmonies, through today with The Boys Are Back.
I'm 46 and saw these guys when Elvira went #1, now my 11 year old son can't wait to see them in concert to hear ""Seven Nation Army"".  What a cross audience appeal.",1242864000,7,380,4.323943661971831

3789148,5,B001TCAT9K,"The Oak Ridge Boys have been known for different kinds of music in the past
years, but they really had their start in gospel. In this DVD which is done by
William Gaither & co., they go back to that, (which by the way doesn't keep them
from singing Elvira). Along with songs, there are interviews and some of their old
clips (quite a difference in the hair). It also shows a couple of songs from the
old Jake Hess noon-day show. That is where I first heard them sing ""Jesus Is Coming
Soon"", it's also the song they opened with on the DVD. During the interviews they
go somewhat into their history.

I do agree with another reviewer that it would have been nice if they had showed
more of their old clips from the early days. Still this is well worth watching. If
you are a fan of the Oak Ridge Boys or simply enjoy listening to their music, this
should be an enjoyable couple of hours.",1329350400,4,885,4.236686390532545

3789150,5,B001TCAT9K,I also have the audio CD and it is wonderful to see the performance especially video clips from the beginning days of the Oaks.  Loved the interviews.,1304899200,,150,4.555555555555555

3789152,5,B001TCAT9K,This DVD has the type of Oak Ridge Boys music we love the most which is southern gospel and some of their standard hits. The interviews and clips from years ago are very interesting too. We really enjoyed watching this.,1267142400,2,219,4.5

8341050,3,B001TCAT9K,The Oak Ridge Boys got started in Gosphel music and put at least one Gosphel song on most of their albums.  I like to sing Gosphel music but I don't like listening to it that much.  I would rather that this had been a country concert.  But they do throw in Elvira and a few other country songs.  All in all this is a good concert.,1506902400,,330,3.9545454545454546
8341051,2,B001TCAT9K,"The first one I received would not play at all so I returned it.  Received the 2nd one and the same thing will not play at all.  I still have it.  Didn't go to the trouble of returning it.  Was very disappointed.  Would think a product produced by the Gaithers  would be top of the line, but this one isn't and I'm sure the Oak Ridge Boys would not be pleased with this also.",1504310400,,375,4.0

Their devotion & feelings that come across in their songs truly are Fantastic! You will not be sorry with their excellent Harmony & Spirit they give you when you listen to this Godly group. Also, what helps to round out their Harmony is the Wonderfully Bassoprofundo Bass Singer! Again I must say ""These gentlemen just HAVE IT""!",1477267200,,473,4.642857142857143
8341056,5,B001TCAT9K,"I seen this group perform live in Little Nashville back in the late 70's/early 80's when they were just Pup's.
My, how they have grown since then and have become one of the most respected groups in the Gospel Field of music. .
Teem'ed  up with the Bill Gaither's group, what more could one expect in a performance. ???
If you like the Oak Ridge Boys, then this Video is a must to see. Yes, hey do sing ""Elvira"".",1465516800,,411,4.2025316455696204
