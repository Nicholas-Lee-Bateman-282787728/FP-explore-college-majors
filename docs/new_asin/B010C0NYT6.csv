8721767,5,B010C0NYT6,"I have never had a DSLR camera but my last point and shoot was a Canon 5s which had a built in zoom with a lot of the buttons on this camera on my old one in the same positions so the transition wasn't as hard. I am a dummy when it came to exposure, IOS, rule or thirds and so much more stuff, but I am up to par quickly with Mikes schooling. I'm no pro yet, will take time to learn everything, but Mike and his video  has made it much easier.",1462406400,3,443,3.7127659574468086

8721771,5,B010C0NYT6,I have several training courses by Michael. They're the absolute best you'll find for photography. He speaks very clearly and could not be easier to understand. He teaches at a pace that makes it easy to follow. By the time you're done with the course you will have a truly thorough understanding of your camera. I recommend his courses to anyone who mentions an interest in photography.,1444089600,5,387,4.791044776119403
8721772,4,B010C0NYT6,Just average compared to Canon instructions,1443830400,,43,6.333333333333333
8721773,5,B010C0NYT6,Trying to get better pictures than what I could capture on my cell phone I purchased a T6i. I had no idea on what I was doing and was very confused by all the buttons. I bought this video and it has helped me so much! The instructor presents the information so clear it is impossible to misunderstand. After watching it once I was out shooting and creating images that I couldn't believe I took. Im so pleased with this video and recommend it to anyone who wants to save some time and quickly learn the camera.,1435795200,6,510,4.268041237113402
