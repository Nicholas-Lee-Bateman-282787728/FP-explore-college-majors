8296749,4,B001E6PGY4,"I have been teaching for 33 years and I recommend this 1970 American Heritage film production.  The Jacksonian Age is difficult enough to communicate to students.  This film deals with fundamental issues through a series of theatrical vignettes involving Webster, Clay, Calhoun, and John Q. Adams.  For a low budget film, the actor who portrays Jackson does quite well.",1260230400,,369,5.220338983050848
8296750,5,B001E6PGY4,"I teach U.S. History to juniors in high school, and all of us use this (I also use the companion) video. Why?

Well, the acting is terrible. The social studies staff at any high school could act just as well. It's really corny - and I do mean corny. These are, however, its charms. In a way, it is like the stereotypical trainwreck (""I was horrified but couldn't turn my head"") that holds the students' interest. It also manages to cover (with its companion) all of the major subjects of the era needed for survey courses. You can't really ""fire-and-forget"" the dvd, it does require some teacher commentary, but it does provide a memorable visual for it all. Even Thomas McKenney is covered, including the support of Calhoun that put McKenney at odds with Jackson.

So, it is so badly acted as to be almost silly, but it is this and the corny action that keeps the students' attention - thus the rating of five stars. Highly recommended for school use.

Note: This all applies to the other volume as well.",1257897600,,1005,4.541436464088398
