6396166,3,B00JWS9HAK,"I thought this dvd was ok, I was looking more for performances by prince, the history of his evolution into music was very interesting, I will probably purchase his next musical cd.",1411084800,,181,4.6875
6396167,5,B00JWS9HAK,Sure did. Finding myself longing to see the next chapter of Prince and the way he chose in finding new ways to get the music to the fans (Me!),1410912000,2,142,3.9310344827586206
6396168,4,B00JWS9HAK,"Think was a great documentary
i really recommend it
it tells about Prince albums as well as the bad deal with Warner brothers",1409616000,,125,4.478260869565218
6396169,5,B00JWS9HAK,Wow! Great!,1409270400,2,11,5.0
6396170,5,B00JWS9HAK,Amazing!!!!!! Every question I had about the record company and Prince in the 90s were answered. The interviews are great and informative.,1408924800,16,138,5.318181818181818
6396171,4,B00JWS9HAK,Very good and informative for a prince fan like myself,1408838400,4,54,4.5
6396172,5,B00JWS9HAK,Excellent! I love that it covers his WHOLE career all the way up to 3rdeyegirl. Most Prince docs only cover the 80's. I've been a DEEP purple Prince fan since 1979. I didn't think there was anything i didn't know. U get commentary from Mivhael B. and Sonny T. along with Alan Leeds. Well worth watching.,1408233600,43,303,4.428571428571429
6396173,5,B00JWS9HAK,"I had very low expectations for this DVD, but wow!  A very well researched and produced documentary about Prince in the '90's all the way up to the 3rd Eye Girl project.  I thought I knew everything about the ""slave"" era, but learned much more.",1407888000,31,244,4.4
6396174,5,B00JWS9HAK,"I have followed Prince since the beginning, I have been to 27 shows. This documentary contains a lot of never before seen footage and information that I was all new to me. Loved it!",1407542400,29,181,4.352941176470588
6396175,4,B00JWS9HAK,"This picks up Prince's career around the Diamonds and Pearls album.  I thought I knew/understood the story behind the contract issue and the rights issue.  I did not, completely, until this DVD.  With interviews from the insiders, including NPG band members and ex-Warner execs, this gives a pretty fair shake at what went down.

The documentary ends with the introduction fo 3rdeyegirl, which makes me wonder why it was not shot in Hi-Def, but I accepted it as required since there was so much archive footage that was not in HD, it would have made it look worse.

It is long, well over 2.5 hours if you watch the extra footage, which is sort of a summary of the main feature, but a couple of new nuggets can be found there.

Though Prince is not interviewed FOR this film, the interviews over the years are presented in a well organized fashion.

The interesting story is how right Prince was about the future of music.  In 1995 he predicted the impact the internet would have on music, and most people just laughed at him.",1405036800,86,1025,4.562841530054645
6396176,5,B00JWS9HAK,"Powerful documentary of the business of Prince vs the record industry. An absolute true pioneer in the industry. One of the first to ""give"" his music away and piss off the label.!  Love it Love It Love It. Required viewing for any musician and any fan of Prince. Even if you are not a fan it is a story told by many close to Prince about the dealings of the business side of the music ""business"".",1488931200,3,396,4.2105263157894735
6396177,5,B00JWS9HAK,"I'm a pretty avid fan and I'm surprised how much I enjoyed this and how much I learned! I knew he used the ""symbol"" to be able to record outside his contract but wasn't aware of just how prescient he was in understanding (and escaping) the collapse of the record industry. I highly recommend it whether you're a long-time fan, just curious about how he disrupted several industries or just learning about his music.",1487808000,2,415,4.621621621621622
6396178,4,B00JWS9HAK,Informative and great addition to any Prince fan's library.,1484784000,2,59,5.666666666666667
6396179,5,B00JWS9HAK,THE best entertainer of all time! RIP,1483488000,,37,4.428571428571429
6396180,5,B00JWS9HAK,This is an excellent documentary about Prince and how he changed the music business.,1483315200,,84,5.071428571428571
6396181,5,B00JWS9HAK,"He was very astute, ahead of everyone. I truly believe he had a God given gift he was happy to share with us and some are just realizing his impact yet I will forever love and listen to his music.",1482192000,,196,3.925
6396182,5,B00JWS9HAK,"Arguably the best documentary on Prince. He was a true visionnaire and genius, hence sometimes misunderstood. But in the end he was right A must-have for fans and newcomers.",1479081600,3,173,5.0

6396189,5,B00JWS9HAK,"Some laughed at him but how many today are laughing?  He exposed the exploitation of artists in the music industry (among others), he fought against it, and now that he's gone others have taken up the cause to continue to make sure artists are treated equitably and fairly.  He was a man of his time and ahead of his time when it came to fairness and freedom for artists.",1469232000,,371,4.36231884057971
6396190,5,B00JWS9HAK,Package arrived in good shape.,1468800000,,30,5.2
6396191,4,B00JWS9HAK,"Good DVD  of a documentary of Prince's fight with Warner Brothers to get control of his masters for his songs. Was not sure how this was going to be, but I found it a very interesting watch. I would recommend it.",1468195200,,212,4.170731707317073
6396192,1,B00JWS9HAK,Two times and the item is defective. Now they want ME to take the time to send it back in order to get a refund. It is trash and neither dvd played at all! I thought it broke my dvd player. I had to unplug it and plug it back in in order for my dvd PLAYER to work again. I would not recommend buying anything from this seller if they can't even send a good replacement dvd......,1468195200,,378,3.858974358974359
6396193,5,B00JWS9HAK,Love Pince! RIP,1466553600,,15,4.333333333333333
6396194,4,B00JWS9HAK,"It was actually nice to hear the record company's view of the turn of events, as well as Prince's side of it, brought the whole business into better perspective.",1465344000,,161,4.586206896551724

6396196,5,B00JWS9HAK,EXCELLENT!,1465084800,,10,10.0
6396197,5,B00JWS9HAK,"Great movie that shows the inside of the music industry, what Prince said was happening (years ago), how he helped change it, but how it even keeps changing.  There are excerpts of interviews from Prince and he is amazing talking about what he was doing trying to help his music.  I only wish that we had a whole DVD that was just hours of interviews with Prince (instead of just excerpts of news / talk shows).  If there IS a DVD out there that is a documentary of Prince's life -- one that he authorized -- please let me know.  In the meantime, this is a must see.",1464912000,,566,4.212962962962963
6396198,5,B00JWS9HAK,Loved this!  A clear representation of events.,1464912000,,46,5.571428571428571
6396199,1,B00JWS9HAK,"If I could have watched it I could have given it a proper review but this item arrived in horrible condition.
It was impossible to watch even a minute of it. :(",1463356800,,160,4.03125
6396200,5,B00JWS9HAK,what an eye opener. ANOTHER EYE OPENER. thank you.,1463270400,,50,4.666666666666667
6396201,5,B00JWS9HAK,"Like other reviewers I had very low expectations for this dvd. I've been a Prince fan since 83 and I figured it would just be a rehashing of stuff I've read or seen before. To say I was pleasantly surprised would be putting it mildly. This was pretty well done with interviews with Alan Leeds, Michael Bland, Sonny Thompson, Jason Draper, Marva  King, and Joe Levy. Granted Prince had no input, they did not paint him in a derogatory light but basically told it how it was.  Its amazing how prophetic he was in dealing with digital music. I highly recommend this to any life long fan of the man. As added bonus, there is plenty of obscure footage to go along with the documentary. Grab it now before the Purple Police catch wind and confiscate it.",1455753600,8,747,4.445255474452555
6396202,5,B00JWS9HAK,"Nice interviews and info on Prince...behind the scenes extra was appealing; would have liked to seen more concert footage and more talking from Prince, but all in all, a nice video.",1447200000,,181,4.870967741935484
6396203,4,B00JWS9HAK,This video was very informative about the dispute between Prince and the recording industry.,1445904000,,92,5.642857142857143

6396206,5,B00JWS9HAK,"This is a really good documentary about one of the most well known creative artists of modern times. A warning though. This is a very, very, very long film. You might want to watch it 45 minutes at a time. If you care about the music industry,  though,  you will learn a lot. I recommend it.",1434326400,4,291,4.178571428571429
6396207,5,B00JWS9HAK,"Thank you TIM! So glad I was wearing my Prince t-shirt today and you told me about this.

6396209,1,B00JWS9HAK,Im very upset. Im really sure it's a great video. I brought this for my wife for a gift and when we sat down to watch it. It was all digitally messed up! Cant see it at all! All green and purple blobs! Very mad! And now my wifes disappointed!,1426377600,2,242,3.86

6396213,4,B00JWS9HAK,"I find the documentary really informative for any Prince fans wanting to know about him during the early 90's till now. The only thing I dislike about the documentary is the title; Prince wasn't traded from his record label,he was trying to get out of it! The title should have been called ""Prince-The Symbol Years"". There were interviews from former band mates as well as some insiders from the music industry. You should check it out!",1423180800,,436,4.75

6396217,4,B00JWS9HAK,if you like prince buy it,1421366400,,25,3.3333333333333335
6396218,5,B00JWS9HAK,"At nearly 2 and half hours in length, this documentary is very thorough and informative. It does a great job of explaining the business practices of the 80's, how they impacted Prince, and how he rebelled in ways that rewrote the rules of the music business - especially when it comes to working with record labels. Many documentaries are usually edited to fit into a 60 or 90 minute format, but this production allows the ""talking heads"" to present detailed tellings and complete their thoughts. Of note, Alan Leeds has much face time and is always very articulate and insightful. Other good interviews include members from the NPG. Due to its length and great detail, this project may not be for everyone, but if you're a fan of Prince, or interested in the business practices of the music business, this is a must see. (FYI - As a college music biz instructor, this is going to be good material to add to my class discussions!)",1419206400,9,930,4.642424242424243
6396219,1,B00JWS9HAK,This DVD was damaged. Couldn't even watch it due to pixelated picture and voice dub not matching the visual. Returned it.,1415577600,3,121,4.809523809523809

6396222,4,B00JWS9HAK,"Gives Prince his due as an innovator and visionary. He will only be appreciated for everything he is later on in history. The average pop fan has no idea of his sphere of influence he has had on music. Since 1982, there has been music before Prince and music after. Most of the current pop stars of our current day would not exist without him. His current reunion and deal with Warner Bros. is only further proof of his business savvy and his continuous efforts to revolutionize the music Biz.",1412726400,14,493,4.488888888888889
6396223,5,B00JWS9HAK,Great detail story of Prince career from1990 to now.,1412553600,,52,4.888888888888889
6396224,5,B00JWS9HAK,"Excellent - this DVD is a must own!!!!! The interviews with Michael B. and Sonny T, and Alan Leeds are extremely informative, and they lend great insight as to what Prince was going through at time of his contact dispute in the 1990s. It explains in detail why the Gold Experience was released over a year after it was originally recorded, and It also explain why he wanted to, but could not release awesome projects like The Undertaker, and many of his other gems in his vault. The DVD really highlights the fact that Prince is a genius, and has always been ahead of his time as an artist, but also as a business man. Please buy the DVD, because once again, it is Excellent!!!!",1412553600,20,678,4.432
6396225,5,B00JWS9HAK,This is exactly what I've been wanting in a prince documentary! Something detailing prince's career from the 90's through 2014...if you're a major Prince fan like myself you will enjoy this and if you're a fan of music in general this is very educational about the music industry,1412208000,2,279,4.833333333333333

8654279,5,B00JWS9HAK,"I watched this doc. on the TubiTv app for free. I have seen several Prince documentaries and interviews with him and his associates, and read several books about him and this is by far one of the most informative things I have seen on him. This doc. offers so much information on how the industry works and how it worked around Prince. I really really loved this documentary and I am so glad I discovered it.",1519689600,,408,4.381578947368421

8654282,5,B00JWS9HAK,"Very well done documentary, gave a great inside view to the music industry, history on Prince's relationship with WB from beginning to the early 2000's. His early awakening to online music sales and distribution and literally being the master of your own domain. Wonderful to hear from those that worked closely with him. Great doc for Prince fans, musicians and artist of all kinds.",1509148800,,383,5.0

8654286,1,B00JWS9HAK,"I have not one but two copies of this dvd and both are complete garbage.. At some point I ended up with the two copies without realizing it, and as it had been some time since their purchase, I left well enough alone and kept both. Fast forward a couple months and it's time to finally watch it. Needless to say it did not go well. I put the first disk in, it got to the menu screen, and after hitting play movie it pickelisated, froze, and my dvd started making a grinding sound. I had to turn everything off and back on to get it out. Assuming it was a defecting disk, I let some time pass and tried again.  Same result, maybe more grinding noises. It should be noted that I've played other disks with no issue both before and after all of this. I am so disappointed, the loos of money (twice) is bad enough, but the Prince forum I read highly recommended this documentary, and now I'll never see it. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER.",1489449600,2,936,4.2
