8341267,1,B001TH16HO,"This film has a good title and intriguing picture on the cover of the DVD and that is it. It is very misleading. No story of interest. No action. No mystery. No interesting characters. Slow. Meandering. The film was so unmemorable and so boring that I cannot remember enough to criticize it properly. It is like an employee, who is so bad, the manager must say, ""I cannot criticize your work, because you have not done any."" All the reviews over 1-star are shill reviews by the sellers. A good mystery films are: ""A Cottage to Let"" with Alastair Sim and ""Green for Danger"".",1478304000,2,573,4.519230769230769

8341270,4,B001TH16HO,"A man tries to pawn a necklace he doesn't own, immediately tipping off the police to a potential crime.  The police, however, already have their hands full with a pesky PI named Clay Holt (Ralph Graves).  His arch nemesis (James Burke as Detective Aloysius) has tattled on him to his superiors because Holt will keep making him look bad.  Holt is an out of work, out of money, down on his luck PI with a secretary (Lola Lane as Peggy Cummings) he's never bothered to notice because she always wore ""cheaters"" and naturally, a pair of spectacles automatically made a woman look homely.  They get a case and a ticket to a swanky country club.  Aloysius also shows up in time for a murder.  Both men are competitive and have a grudge against the other so the race is on to solve the case first.  Along the way, Peggy takes her glasses off allowing Clay Holt to fall instantly in love with her.  And the necklace shown at the beginning of the movie goes missing again, resulting in a ransom to complicate matters somewhat.

This is a lightweight mystery/comedy that is entertaining due in large part to character actor James Burke as the bumbling cop Aloysius.  Otherwise, it's par for the course for that time period.  I liked it.  It's a keeper.",1433721600,7,1243,4.54954954954955
