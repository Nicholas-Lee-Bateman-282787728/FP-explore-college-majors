1359423,5,B00004W20Z,I was only 10 ys old when this was taped. I didn't become a fan really till after his death.

There just isn't enough of Elvis singing and performing his hits, and I didn't like the way that this DVD was formulated.  Elvis, Aloha From Hawaii and Elvis, That's The Way It Is are both much better DVDs, especially if you are an Elvis fan and want to see and hear him at his best.",1472688000,,428,4.283950617283951

1359432,5,B00004W20Z,Wow!  What do you think?  This is a fabulous performance.  Too bad Elvis didn't do more work with people like Steve Binder who wanted to nurture his talent instead of exploiting it.,1465257600,,181,4.59375

1359465,5,B00004W20Z,"He was the one that started it all...the thin ""Hillbilly Cat"" from Tupelo Mississippi. From the ""Big Bang"" of Rock and Roll which occurred at Sun Studios in 1954, to the dynamic entertainer who never played to a venue that wasn't sold out in the 1970's Elvis is simply ""the man"".

His 68 Comeback Special caught Elvis at his absolute peak. Towards the end of his movie career in the 1960's, it was a well known fact that Elvis had grown sick of the trite and unambitious formula of his movies. Luckily for all of us, Elvis was able to overcome this frustration, by taking it out on everybody who watched this special.

Dressed in the iconic black leather suit, Elvis reinvented himself, as a large portion of the Special was filmed ""unplugged"" as a jam session in front of a live audience. He never looked better, and from the start of the show when he starts belting out ""Trouble"" you know you are in for an unprecedented experience. It was like he was breaking free from a self imposed prison sentence. He jokes around with some of his old band mates from his Sun days, interacts well with his mesmerized audience, and paces the stage with an electricity that cannot be described in words.

He sings all of his old standards, but with an updated sound that tells the audience...""okay we all grew up, so let's not take this too seriously"". Other classics such as Mac Davis's Memories is one of his best recordings of all time. The simple lyrics, and the earnestness in which he sings it,  evokes a strong feeling of nostalgia and even a bit of sadness, as we reminisce about the best days we enjoyed with our soulmate.

Other songs on the recording includes a rousing rendition of ""Guitar Man"" where a guy with stars in his eyes comes to the realization that he will ""never be more than what I am, that swingin' little guitar man"", and at the end of the song he accepts and embraces this simple truth.

I would be remiss, If I did not mention the show's opening song. Elvis close up singing his 1958 hit Trouble from the movie King Creole. Driven by intensity and emotion, Elvis is letting us know that he is back, and we'd better not ""mess"" with him.

Elvis delivers the knockout punch to end the show with If I Can Dream...in my opinion the greatest vocal performance of his entire career. In anybody else's hand, this song may fall flat...It was recorded shortly after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and many may have seen this recording as a duplicitous way of capitalizing on this terrible tragedy...but in the hands of the master, it becomes an anthem for anybody who has ever struggled, and encourages all of us to never capitulate, even when we are staring at overwhelming odds. The strain of this song was actually so great on Elvis that he actually passed out in the studio while recording it. Straight from his heart and soul to ours...it is truly a wonderful gift he gives us.

Yes the 68 Comeback Special's historical significance cannot be understated. There is true magic in watching a performer of his magnitude rediscover himself. Although cast aside in the 60's and relegated to filming inane (yet very profitable motion pictures) other musical acts such as the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and the Beatles were now ruling the music scene. The '68 Comeback Special was Elvis's not so subtle way of telling everyone to ""step aside"" the King is back.

The Special also acted as a bridge for him to recommence a regular touring schedule. From Las Vegas and Reno Nevada, to New York City, Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles, Jacksonville, and all points in between...everyone was put on notice that the King of Rock and Roll, although gone for awhile was back and better than ever.

If I could own only 3 Elvis CD's, I would have this one, the 69 American Studio recordings, and Elvis Aloha from Hawaii.

HIGHLY recommended.",1455667200,,3845,4.6149341142020495

1359468,5,B00004W20Z,"This is one of my favorite DVDs in my collection and I watch it regularly.  If anyone wants to know what rock and roll is really all about, these performances by Elvis are the best.  This is Elvis in his prime, looking every bit the quintessential rockstar and showing the world that even with all the other popular bands that had emerged by 1968, Elvis stood tall above them all as the undisputed King of Rock and Roll.

It is interesting to consider that at the time this was recorded, a lot of music critics and even people in other bands had written off Elvis as a musician and live performer.  He had spent most of the years between his return from military service and the 68 Comeback Special filming movies instead of touring and performing.  What many of these critics, especially in hindsight, didn't realize is that by making those films, Elvis was able to reach far more people and gain an order of magnitude more fans than if he had simply toured the world for most of the 1960s.  Remember that there was no MTV back then, nor any other way for a musician to get there music out through the visual medium of film and television, with the exception of making appearances on variety shows such as Ed Sullivan.  Elvis was one of the few performers, along with Frank Sinatra and a handful of others, that could command leading roles in films with strong box office receipts.  The films built Elvis into an even bigger star than his music, yet the critics continued to claim that his star in rock and roll was fading in the late 60s after the emergence of so many other bands since 1964.

In the 68 Comeback Special, Elvis successfully put all those criticisms to rest with powerful and passionate performances of both his old hits, covers, and a number of new hits.  The actual TV special that aired on NBC is a tour de force with visuals, wardrobes, and dancing to complement the powerhouse performance by Elvis singing songs such as ""Guitar Man,"" ""Big Boss Man,"" ""Trouble,"" and a mesmerizing rendition of ""If I Can Dream.""

I honestly can't get enough of watching this DVD set and play these discs several times a year.  Each time I find something new to appreciate about how amazing the 68 Comeback was for Elvis.  This is rock and roll.  This is the greatest superstar the entertainment business has ever known at the top of his form.  Nothing else even comes close.",1453593600,,2378,4.5362997658079625

It was just like the dvd was put out just to make money. Well, I read the reviews and can't believe they weren't disappointed. Oh well, each to his own. Just sorry I wasted this kind of money.

Too bad he didn't do more specials like this one and ""Elvis That's The Way It is"", ""Elvis On Tour"" (which has too many non concert scenes in it) and the ""Elvis Aloha From Hawaii"". One other ""sad note"" it's a pity that well known people cannot live ""normal lives"" due to the crushing number of fans who might mean well, but really encroach on the celebrities ability to go places with family and friends and enjoy the same things these ""crushing fans enjoy"". They have to make special arrangements to shop where stores are closed for the day, rent a movie theatre just to take family members to see a movie, or anything else after midnight.

Awesome performances and the embryo for MTV's ""Unplugged"" concept several years later. After watching the two uncut sit down performances, I went back to the sit down performances from '68 Comeback Special.

I am hoping the DVD set will be re-released in a Letter boxed H.D.-BLU RAY version ..at a future date..and hopefully soon !!
I hope the same for the 2 DVD set of
ALOHA FROM HAWAII.. which was Elvis Presley's second T.V. special- recorded and video taped on tour in Hawaii.
This set is highly recommended.",1416528000,,731,4.537878787878788

1359617,5,B00004W20Z,"There is no disputing the '68 material's superiority over any other Elvis D.V.D. There is great inherent drama in seeing a man fighting to save his career and reputation and winning the gamble. The 3 DVD set is the definitive statement on the pivotal moment in Elvis's post-Army career. It was time for him to either show he still had the stuff to strut or to disappear into the ""Nostalgia"" or ""Oldies"" section of record store bins. The boxing ring aspect of the ""set"" for the sit down sessions which are the truest video revelation of what made the man great couldn't have been more appropriate for a champion returning to try to regain his title and succeeding. These 2 sessions alone make this worth buying, and there is much more. Anyone who can see this material and not get hooked on Elvis is permanently immune to his talent.

I have written to Amazon before about the confusion that arises when they indiscriminately mix the reviews for various different versions of the same source material. The confusion expressed by many reviewers is logical, as reviews of 1, 2 or 3 disc versions are all lumped together. Just look carefully at the description of what you are ordering. The 3 disc set is the real treasure trove. Few will be interested after the original broadcast version from Dec.,'68 and the 4 ""mini-concerts"" which follow. That takes care of 1 1/2 DVD's. The rest is strictly for the already converted. BMG seems to have discontinued this complete set, and the higher prices reflect this. Why can't BMG, Sony and others fathom that some items will never be ""best sellers"" but will always have slow, steady sales and an eternal shelf life? Watch for a good offer from a separate seller and you can get this set for a reasonable price. I just found and ordered it as a gift for under $40.00. ""Quite likely the greatest Rock 'n' Roll ever recorded"", as Greil Marcus called the sit-down material in his ""Presliad"" in Mystery Train, is a pretty strong statement. But while watching and listening to Elvis as he redeems himself and saves his career with such as ""One Night"" ""Lawdy, Miss Clawdy"" and, best of all, ""Tryin' To Get To You"", it's easy to believe his statement.",1399507200,,2183,4.67012987012987

Here he rocks, and for a while he returned to his roots and sang Gospel Music dancing to it with a group of dancers, dress in beautiful suits.  At the closing of this dvds he sings the historic song IF Y CAN DREAM, dress in a beautiful white suit, same song that he sang with Celine Deon later on, when the technology put them together.

1359685,5,B00004W20Z,"He may never have liked the term ""comeback"" that described the special he did for NBC-TV in 1968, since he didn't think he had anything to ""come back"" from, but the truth is that this was indeed a comeback for Elvis Presley.  Or, to be really precise, it was a total Resurrection.  When he agreed to do this thing, he had spent much of the previous eight years submerging himself in mediocre movies (CLAMBAKE; PARADISE, HAWAIIAN STYLE, etc.) and even more mediocre, sometimes downright awful songs (""Ito Eats"", anyone?).  In the meantime, his singles had stopped becoming automatic hits like before, and disciples like the Beatles had cut into his dominance; only the 1965 release of ""Crying In The Chapel"" (a song recorded actually in 1960) made the Top Ten on the singles charts during the period of 1964-68.  Only a dynamic change in the way he did things would help the situation, and this TV special was it.  And this time, we may thank heaven that the Colonel's idea for this special, a far more mundane and routine Christmas holiday set-up, was scotched by NBC, producers Bones Howe and Bob Finkel, and director Steve Binder for what people really wanted: the Real Elvis.

""If you're lookin' for trouble, you came to the right place"", Elvis sings at the opening; and what we see is a man who has finally come home to doing what God put him here to do.  With Binder's encouragement, and his having managed to get longtime Elvis favorites Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana to help him, the King finally stepped into the breach once more, with results that galvanized viewers when the show originally aired on December 3, 1968.  A lot of this special was pure Hollywood, but more of the kind Elvis should have gotten in his films than what he actually did get.  The proto-""Unplugged"" segments of the special that he does with Moore, Fontana, Charlie Hodge, and Alan Fortas show that Elvis still has it in him to jam on songs like ""One Night"", ""Trying To Get To You"", and the raunchy ""Tiger Man"" (""ain't no end to this song, baby"", Elvis tells his guys and the audience of young girls at the end of that one).  He brings new vitality, in that leather jacket of his, to old favorites like ""All Shook Up"", ""Don't Be Cruel"", ""Jailhouse Rock"", and ""Love Me Tender"", as well as a new mellowness on the Mac Davis composition ""Memories.""  He also pays his props to the R&B/gospel genre that helped spawn rock and roll by doing a set of gospel songs, which was next-to-unheard-of for network television in those days.

Finally, in response to the terrible events of 1968, including the murder of Bobby Kennedy in Los Angeles and Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis, Elvis concludes the special with the epic, inspirational W. Earl Brown piece ""If I Can Dream"", which unquestionably must rank up there with ""We Shall Overcome"", ""Imagine"", and ""Let It Be"" as all-time anthems for peace and brotherhood.  Elvis' galvanizing recording of that song not only vaulted the special's soundtrack recording to million-selling status on the album charts, but also gave him a big hit single that got him away from the shallow schlock of ""Do The Clam"" and on to soon-to-be classics like ""In The Ghetto"" and ""Suspicious Minds.""

This three-disc collection of that special is absolutely essential to understand what kind of an artist Elvis really was, as opposed to the guy whose manager had forced him into some of the worst musical films ever made, and then in later years overworked him in Vegas and on several tours a year until that terrible August day in 1977.  Its importance to popular music can never be overstated, and that's why I can't recommend this special highly enough.",1329091200,,3658,4.7115987460815045

I had heard the records and all, but after seeing this, I know what the hype is all about. Excellent song assortment. Can do without some of the Hollywood choreography on a couple of numbers, but the Gospel-tinged songs really hit the mark.

1359719,5,B00004W20Z,WOW I do wish the last three generations could have seen a true professinal such as Elvis was. I remember seeing this really one of a kind performance and I was glued to our set . This set has helped all those unlucky people see just how great Elvis was. These videos do show Elvis at his very best be it just talking or showing everyone how he could go from is early up beat songs and then he would show us all how he could do gospel songs. Now be sure to watch just how great he sounded on songs like Up Above My Head and Saved. Now these three c.d's do contain over seven hours of material so I suggest you watch about an hour at a time so you can really see how Elvis had all of the girls in the audence get to enjoy him up close where he sat with him from almost the very start or shortly after such as D.J. Fontana Charlie Hodge just to name two. These videos show Elvis at his very best.,1300492800,,894,3.9175824175824174

I really liked this '68 Comeback of Elvis's. I can remember when it aired on TV, altho for some reason I didn't get to see it all then. I liked the joking, cutting up with his band members and friends. And the music as always was Great. What a talented man he was. Beautiful voice (he had matured quite a bit from his voice of the '50's). And he showed more of his human side of himself. I did not get the one that had the 3 disc in it, thought it was a little pricey. But I would recommend this for anyone who loved/liked Elvis. That was a Special moment and time in his life, getting back into doing what he was so good at. His movies for the most part were all alike and he was sick of it. His Fans were all still there, tho most were older (but not all) and loved him and his music.",1296000000,,940,4.662650602409639

this is a great set of discs that cover the 1968 comeback television shows elvis did.

elvis was the man. plain and simple. he gets up on that little stage and sings. plays guitar. talks to the crowd. its cool.
this is a good set to put on the tv and just relax. i watched the first disc and then played the second and third while i read a book on the couch.  what book?  that doesnt matter.  just know that this is a good disc set and if your any sort of an elvis fan, youll like this.

1359725,3,B00004W20Z,"I have to say that I was a little disappointed.  The audience really looked staged and not involved in the performance at all.  They should have filmed a real concert with ticket paying customers who really wanted to see Elvis.  Fans that would be inspired and who would in turn inspire Elvis to perform even better.  Instead we get a stale staged performance that was not authentic.  Secondly, we got 1960s style television production numbers which weren't much better and sometimes worse than the phoney concert.  The reason I'm not totally disappointed is because of the third section with Elvis and the boys playing their guitars and singing old favorites.  This section alone is worth the price of the video.  Until this part, I actually questioned why Elvis was such a superstar.  Well, when you see these ""unplugged"" jam sessions with some of his old musician buddies, you realize why Elvis is Elvis.  Unpretentious, wanting to please, reminiscing, just being his natural self, you start to realize why this man is so great and why he was the King of Rock n Roll.  I am glad that I chose this basic edition of the 1968 Comeback Special, because,  the expanded edition probably would just have a lot more of the disappointing stuff.",1288656000,,1238,4.787735849056604

 The Comeback special is charming,  a bit dated, but Elvis Looks great, and is singing better than he ever has, with all the energy and passion of his early days.

1359767,4,B00004W20Z,"First, I'd like to let eric, who gave the previous review dated 29 Dec 09, know that you can identify the discs by the number of ""dots"" on the disc, 1,2,3.

For historical context, this is the best Elvis performance that exists in color. For that alone it is worth having a copy.

The first 1 1/2 discs are great material and mostly great performances, including the original show as broadcast, two unedited versions of the sit down sessions and two unedited versions of the stand up session.

The advantage of having this set compared to just the show only is that you get the continuity of the actual live performances here, verses a ""cut & paste"" of just the best bits from the boradcast only.  The ""cut & paste"" broadcast is great, but if you want the Elvis live exeperience, these two uncut sessions are worth the premium you pay for this set.  You can watch them in the context and continuity of a single perfomance.

The last 1 1/2 discs are cutting floor material that would appeal to an Elvis completist.  I am guessing that watching E practice endless takes of production dance numbers will only appeal to a small minority of viewers.

I don't understand why every few years the Presley estate feels the need to release yet another ""gretaest hits"" CD package.  Perhaps they believe there is an unlimited number of people who still don't own one or or greatest hits they like (my personal favorite / best value is still the oddly titled ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50-Worldwide-Gold-Hits-Volume-1-Parts-1-2/dp/B000002WFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50 Worldwide Gold Hits: Volume 1, Parts 1 & 2</a>"").  Therefore, the fact that half this deluxe DVD set has little artistic value and the retail price of this set is so high should not be a surprise.

Still, at $25-$45 for the deluxe set, I feel the 1 1/2 discs of the original show plus 4 sessions of uncut performances make this set worth it.  You can use the third disc as a coaster though if your objective is Elvis the singer.

One more suggestion: get ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Johnny-Cash-Show-The-Best-of-Johnny-Cash-1969-1971/dp/B000TLMWMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Johnny Cash Show: The Best of Johnny Cash 1969-1971</a>"" box set and contrast it with this broadcast.  Here are two Sun Records two biggest alumini having ended up in two very different places at roughly the same time, 1968-70.  Both were musical geniuses, had their demons and give great performances.  Cash's ability to branch out and Elvis' search to redefine himself during this period is worth exploring.",1262390400,,2638,5.2601431980906925

I can relate to all these areas, because, I used to live in Mobile, plus I've been to Memphis, and Panama City, many, many times.

Anyway, you get to hear his classics, such as ""That's All Right"", ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Hound Dog"", ""Can't Help Falling in Love"", ""Don't be Cruel"", and others. Plus, he does a tribute to Gospel Music. He performs another ""series"" of ""Guitar Man"", and ends the dvd with the song, ""If I Can Dream"".

 I think this debuted as a TV special, which is where I first saw it almost 40 years ago. Wow, it sure doesn't seem that long ago. I re-watched it several times on video back in the '90s. The main benefit to having this now on DVD  is mainly to have this guy in ooncert on film. How many bigger names in show business history are there than Elvis Presley?

There are some good songs on here and his voice, even today, remains distinctive to me. I have never heard anyone who sounds quite like him. My favorites are his fast numbers.

What I didn't like here was all the clowning around. Elvis does that way too much here, especially early on - laughing and joking in the middle of some of his songs, instead of just singing them. I bought this to hear him sing, although I'm glad he was having a good time, which is certainly entitled to having. Also, the dance numbers look really dated and stupid now. That's not his fault; that's the way they presented music shows back in the '60s.

Something else you don't see much, if at all, nowadays: a secular recording artist doing a bunch of gospel songs. Elvis was into that his whole life and that was nice to see in here.",1234137600,,1311,4.266129032258065

1359825,5,B00004W20Z,"I grew up in the era of arena rock--if you can pack in ten thousand fans, why not 20, or even 30 thousand?  I could never understand why, by the early 80s, so many bands were 'going back to their roots' and playing in small clubs.  Well, I had seen the Comeback Special years ago and never appreciated it.  Finally, I figured it out: in the big arena, half the time you need binoculars even to see the band and you are just rockin' out with some guy next to you.  The band is irrelevant.  Well, with the Comeback Special, Elvis nails it--he's the center of attention, and, good grief, he has real charisma that a small audience can *feel*! That's what rock n roll is all about!

More or less, there are three main parts to this show. The first I'll consider is the production numbers.  Well, these are all forgettable and really unnecessary.  I guess the 'Big Boss Man' number might actually be the prototype for the MTV videos. So, they might be interesting from that perspective.

Let's turn our attention to the 'sit-down' sessions. This is where Elvis really shines. He's sitting with his buddies in a very loose atmosphere.  The producer wanted to create on stage what the boys did at their jam sessions--sit around, talk, joke, sing--and it works.  It's not the greatest music ever recorded, but it works perfectly for its purpose. It's rough, it's raw, but it's from the heart, and it's cool.  Elvis puts on some great performances.  NO ONE could sing rockabilly or rhythm and blues like Elvis does in the sit-down sessions.  Here, he looks good, he sounds good, and he's at the top of his game.  ('Tryin' to Get to You' is an RnB masterpiece!)

Next, there are the 'stand up' sessions.  Here, Elvis is alone on stage--to sink or swim on his own. The band is no where to be seen.  Elvis paces the stage (a boxing ring without the ropes) like a caged animal.  He exudes energy. He's dressed in black, he looks good and he's hungry. HUNGRY. (""It's been a long time, baby""). He cuts into some of his old hits and it's great.

The only problem with his performance, especially in the 'stand-up' segments,  is that we already see some of the elements that would become part of the 'cheesy' Elvis of the 70s--a bit of self parody and the huge retinue of band members and back-up singers that took the focus off him. This DVD, ironically, shows the two paths that Elvis could have taken--the 'sit-down' with Elvis as the focal point with a small band and the 'stand-up' with Elvis as an ornament with an army of back up people.  Well, he unfortunately chose the latter.

Since this CD set has nearly every scrap of filming for the Special, including mutiple takes, it's really only for the serious Elvis fan.  If you just want the final product, get the non-deluxe version.

For a few days in 1968, Elvis was king again. But had this been the '1963 Comeback Special' and had he been able to keep up this level of energy, maybe we would not have needed a British Invasion to reintroduce us to rock n roll.",1206748800,,3004,4.477941176470588

I wasn't disappointed!  What a fantastic show - some production numbers, a great set where Elvis does some medley solo on a small centre stage (his band is on a side stage), and a fantastic mostly acoustic set that he plays intimately with 4 of his band mates. The performances are electifying, and the banter between musicians is great to listen to.  Elvis' charism shines through.

Some of the music has a bit of a dated 60's feel to it - overblown horn sections in certain areas. But, it was the 60's! However, the performances are so good, that it doesn't distract.

Though I didn't have to do anything special to mail it back (Amazon provided a return label for me that I simply printed out), I was just a little worried that people are not paying attention when they pack customers' items!

I wanted to see exactly the show that finally aired in Dec. 1968, just as it was shown on TV from beginning to end, but that didn't happen.

1359863,5,B00004W20Z,"The original Elvis mania was a little before my time - I rarely can say that about anything anymore, but I can say it about this. I was too busy being a kid during his first wave in the 50s to be very aware of popular music. I didn't really start listening until the British invasion of the 60s, which Elvis, following advice, wisely sat out. He kept busy in Hollywood instead. Until I was 15, I knew him mostly from his string of B movies. A few early ones (including Jailhouse Rock and King Creole), rose to the level of camp classics. The ones from the 60s struck me then as watchable but forgettable.

The time came when Elvis Presley wanted to return to live musical performances. In 1968, I watched the TV special ""Elvis"" and was blown away. I didn't see this show again until earlier this week, nearly 40 years later. My response was the same. This is classic Elvis at the top of his form before he became a caricature of himself. Others have commented with some justice that, in the 70s, the first Elvis impersonator was Elvis, but no such gibe applies here.

The show featured a mix of performances. Elaborately choreographed stage numbers presaged his later Las Vegas shows; they also presaged, to some degree, the acts of many present day pop stars, which seem to be as much about staging as about music, and which feature ""electronic enhancement"" (often little different from lip synching) of the voices. The bulk of the show, however, and by far the most effective part of it, is Elvis' straight-up un-enhanced music, played and sung almost casually and with humor in the midst of a fairly small audience.

I became a fan in 1968. What is on this DVD is the reason.",1188259200,,1678,4.5131578947368425

This man and his music is ELECTRIC...the performance is outstanding. I now understand my parents when they talk about the influence he had on them, and all teenagers at the time.
He looks and sounds great, he plays to his influences (gospel and blues), as well as the classic hits he was famous for, and he performs like a true professional.

I now realise what a great loss he was to the music world. Forget what he became in the 1970's just before he died...this is ELvis as he should, and I'm sure will, be remembered.

A fantastic set....Very Highly Recommended",1188000000,,769,4.605839416058394

His performance was none other than spectacular and he, himself, was in the best possible condition of his career. Not that Elvis could ever be anything but spectacular, but this one particular DVD was just the most electrifying and yet showed Elvis as a dear, gentle young man who had the world at his fingertips and after seeing his performance, had every girl's, woman's and even every grandma's heart in his hand. This DVD is a MUST for anyone who enjoys the music, the persona, the talent and the love of Elvis. If I could have only two DVD's of Elvis, this is definitly one of the two.

Musically, it is some of the best he has ever done, but on a personal level, he never looked better.  He was thin and tanned, and he had just become a new daddy.  It shows on his face.  He looks so happy.  And, Elvis in black leather, it really doesn't get any better than that, ladies!  Wait.  It does.  Check him out in his black velvet outfit!!  WOW!

I watched this with my 72 year old mother, and both of us spent the 90+ minutes drooling and singing.  If you are an Elvis fan, this DVD is a must.  I hadn't seen this special in its entirety since the 70's, and I had forgotten how great it was.

1359911,5,B00004W20Z,"After years and years of making movies and largely neglecting his musical career, Elvis did this TV comeback special in 1968. The success of this show rejuvinated Elvis, and within a year he had recorded ""The Memphis Album"" (also recommended) which included ""In The Ghetto"" and ""Suspicious Minds"".

The TV special reunited him with his original 50's band for the intimate small stage set. He is seated and singing some of those classic Sun records ""Thats Alright Mama"" being perhaps the best known. Then, dressed in black leather he is backed (out of sight) by a bigger band and here Elvis is in rocking form, tearing up the stage with fabulous performances of Jailhouse Rock, Heartbreak Hotel and many others. During the remainder of the show a full band and Orchestra back him, together with additional dancers and large sets. The show ends with a breathtaking version of ""If I Can Dream"", which remains my favourite Elvis performance of all time.

This 'special edition' has a few humourous outtakes and some stills, but really its the main film your buying it for. If you want a proper special edition buy the 3 disc edition. If you've never really understood what made Elvis so great, buy this DVD and you will.",1177459200,,1216,4.785714285714286

This is also a good choice for non Elvis' fans, who could be less interested in buying a three discs de luxe DVD. This DVD shows no any thing, it shows maybe the best live performer of all time in one of his finest moments, for many the finest. And for those who are disappointed with Elvis making jokes: Elvis used to make jokes in his concerts and he did it even through of some songs; it was one more side of his showmanship and his sense of humour and it worked on stage and made him greater on stage, although it is true that sometimes these clowning arounds went too far; but this is not the case.

Here the `King' shows why he was and continues to be a global phenomenon: the so-called `sit down' sequences are almost literally electrifying with Elvis reprising some of his early hits dressed in tight black leather and looking the very image of youthful health and vitality and made all the more poignant in the light of what happened less than ten years later.  Although the energy of this performance manifests itself only a miniscule notch below the raw power of the earlier years he is here, arguably, at his best in terms of the quality of his singing and the sheer magnetism of his presence.  His rendition of the last song, If Can Dream, is truly moving and demonstrates what an actor he could have been if he'd managed to escape from the Colonel's fetters: he makes you truly believe in what he's singing.

The choice of songs was great, the venue was wonderful but he just couldn't appreciate it all and as a result, the entire DVD was a disappointment.

1359940,1,B00004W20Z,"OK, let's get this out of the way, the ELVIS ('68 Comeback) is the finest TV special ever presented on American television. So why the 1 star? The editing in this version of the show is appalling, such lazy dilettantes. Every time there is a cut from one scene to another there is a still shot that moves from left to right and then the action resumes. It is grating. The show cuts from sit down performance to stand up and back and forth, all edits being telegraphed with the aforementioned still shot, stop and go routine, it is a real hack job.

  I own the 74 minute version put out 15 years ago and the editing follows the original broadcast. When they can, they put in extra footage at the appropriate time (sit down is added to sit down performance, standup to standup so there is a continuous flow). The edits can be made from scene to scene and the original fade to black for the commercials are maintained. In addition they edited out Blue Christmas for crying out loud, what's up with that? Also on the cutting room floor is the little funky rhythm guitar part that immediately follows the intro Guitar Man and the audience clapping, hey remember the part where Elvis gives that sly smile and says, ""I think I'll put a strap on this and stand up""? , remember his deadpan delivery of ""Man I just work here"" , Good thing for your memory `cause it's gone, cut out in favor of those imaginative edits.

  For the record to edit from scene to scene, if the action can't be done smoothly, you can always insert an audience shot and then back to Elvis, it's called `editing',people. The picture and sound are otherwise fabulous, it looks the same as the BOX set that I also own, I was hoping to get a version of the performance with extra black leather footage, but I was assuming the editing would be handled by professionals who would try to maintain the spirit, look,  and vitality of the original while adding to the show. They ended up subtracting from the overall viewing pleasure. By editing out the Elvis dialog, they've removed the soul of the presentation, the special was all about getting Elvis back in front of a live microphone but also to humanize him, show his gifted sense of humor. What a drag.",1158624000,,2216,4.47029702970297

Been an Elvis fan for awhile but listening recently to the CD of the NBC Special really got my interest about viewing the show. Turns out watching the show is even better than I'd thought. The remastering is fantastic as the picture and sound qualities are really very clear.
The medley segment is the centerpiece in this memorable show. Elvis is encompassed by the studio audience while on a small open stage not unlike a boxing ring. Relaxed, yet with an edginess, confident, he's also having a lot of fun. The audience is just mere feet away and taking it all in and clearly enjoying themselves.",1155340800,,761,4.7727272727272725

My mother will tell you the best part was the black leather, I personally think that it was the great connection that he had with his fans.

The special itself was enjoyable however, the big production numbers were a bit dated.

The real treasure in this set lies within the two uncut sit down shows that are on disc 1.  It features Elvis ""unplugged"" with his original band mates Scotty Moore and DJ Fontana, along with Charlie Hodge.

It's a very informal jam session (that's what Elvis referrs to it as) If you're not a big fan of Elvis before you watch these two uncut sit down shows, you will be by the time they are over!  Elvis is relaxed and joking with his band members and the audience - his true self really comes through.  He goes from belting out a raw rock song (such as `One Night') and then he'll launch into a smooth ballad.... On top of that, he demonstrates that he's a pretty darn good guitar player too!  All and all the shows are a joyous romp through the history of his career.

I have only watched disc 1 so far so I can't comment on the other two discs.  I'm sure they'll be just as good as the first two.",1147651200,,1085,4.177884615384615

However, the bad points of this DVD set is repitition, and eventually overkill. There are two leather stand up shows and two sit down shows all on disc one and disc two, which is basically the same songs repeated. Sure Elvis does say different stuff, and there is a different camera angle ect, but it is basically the same.

Disc 3 is truly horrid, outtakes from the drama sequence that looks very dated, and should only be shown to Elvis completists, or big fans that want every little scrap of footage of Elvis.

The indexing of the DVD does not clearly catalogue what's on the DVD itself and much of the material is far too repetitive, in our opinion.  Perhaps the producers were intending to create the compleat Elvis DVD, but instead it seems to be a hodge-podge of program material.

On the other hand, the actual NBC black leather concert anticipated by THIRTY years the 'Unplugged,"" idea and as other reviewers have noted, Elvis seems to have been born into that black leather suit.  We learn now how insecure he was to be doing that show, but it didn't come through.

It's a shame that Elvis became a drug addict and died at an early age.  His enormous talent and generous personality comes through during the performance.  One wonders at the end of the show just where his life would have gone, where his music would have gone had he lived a 'normal' lifespan.  This is testimony to the destructiveness of the druggie lifestyle, which is often not attributed to him.

This may be offensive to the Elvis diehard, but that's our reaction.  Great talent, fascinating performance, lousy organization.",1127174400,,1131,4.753846153846154

I can understand why the outtake footage was included as that will stop it coming out illegally , but I think most fans would have liked a series of interviews with the special's director or a documentary , or both .

Instead , I recommend Peter Guralnick's two books on Elvis ,

called LAST TRAIN TO MEMPHIS and CARELESS LOVE . Reading about Elvis can make you feel both happy and sad .

If you want to feel sad , buy the ELVIS - ALOHA FROM HAWAII DVD , which has a great band , but an out of tune singer in front of it .

1360012,5,B00004W20Z,"I like so many others think this comeback special is Elvis' finest onscreen appearance. Aside from some of the dated production numbers that didn't age well, this show captures the pure magic of Elvis, just prior to when his amphetamine use started becoming obvious and ruining his onstage charm.

One thing that is interesting about the extra material... frankly you may only need to view it once because a lot of it is nothing special. The editors of this TV special did a fantastic job and truly picked most of the best moments from the show. For example, he probably did 20 takes for the opening bit (Guitar man)... and the only one that REALLY captured the swagger and lip curl of the man we love was the one they use... in all the others, he's not quite right or is goofing around too much.

One thing that is a little disturbing about some of the extra footage is you realize that he is lipsynching more than is readily obvious.

I guess I'm saying that if I could buy the main DVD and rent the other two DVDs to just watch once, I would rather do that to save money. But this show is an absolute must have for anyone who loves Elvis. His genuine warmth and southern boy niceness, his soul and smoothness, his incredible sexyness, and the crazed hysterical reactions of the female fans come through perfectly in this film.",1122768000,,1329,4.483471074380165

And the music from that black sequence <making chef's 5 fingered kissing sign> was delicious. ;) But be forewarned: it takes hours to listen to the whole set, and you will be dreaming & humming Elvis for days if you sit through it all at once!

1360016,3,B00004W20Z,"This is way too much '68 Comeback Special--every merciless inch of videotape from the NBC special on three discs--and it reveals a star unsure of himself, baffled by his image, and leaning on his director Steve Binder like a little lost boy. The outtakes reveal a very different Comeback Special than the carefully edited show that captivated America and breathed life into Elvis's faltering career. The Elvis Legend would have you believe The King finally took the bull by the horns in this special, casting off the stupor of his movie career and getting down and funky with what he really was all about. The unused footage displays something entirely different. From the black-leather segments, we see something akin to a nervous boy pushed on the stage by his mother who bellows: ""Do your magic tricks, sonny!"" Elvis is visible shaking, barely able to stutter the scripted ""impromptu dialogue"" with his band mates, flubbing songs, making cracks that he wants to leave. He pleads with his director, ""What do we do now, Steve?"" He looks like he'd rather be anywhere else. Back-to-back shows were done--two black-leather sit-downs and two black-leather stand-ups--and we can see just how carefully contrived Elvis was in these performances. Far from being spontaneous, even his throwaway lines to the audience were rehearsed. These legendary segments--the most remembered from the '68 Comeback Special--were supposedly as real as Elvis got before the public. But what the DVD ""extras"" make clear is that even by 1968 Elvis was simply the world's greatest Elvis impersonator. The image had long overtaken the man and for Elvis the two--image and man--were entirely separate and non-related. For the rest of his career Elvis would simply try to reflect what the public expected of him, for commercial gain, until his performances became gross parodies and caricatures and bored him to death. This special is Steve Binder's interpretation of ELVIS! in neon lights. And Elvis, mired in his worst career slump, seems desperate for Binder to tell him what he should be. This DVD package offers a vexing revisionist look at a star's greatest moment, showing ambivalence about his image even then, and reminding the viewer that we never really knew the man we thought we knew so well.",1120521600,,2276,5.088235294117647

1360028,3,B00004W20Z,"I had my mate Neil 'mission control' Armstrong-Jones round the flat the other night, when the Elvis 68 Comeback Special came on the telly. ""Elvis!"" screamed mission and pulled out all his hair. ""Elvis!"" he hollered while removing all his teeth with a pair of plyers, spitting blood all over my carpet. ""Elvis! ELVIS!!!!!"" he shrieked, while jumping up and down on my sofa, his head cracking the plaster on the ceiling. This was just the opening number. ""Sorry, I squashed your cat"" said mission. I don't have a cat so I lifted the pillow to see the flat, contorted features of the wife. Not mine, I don't have one. ""You can always get another wife, whosever it was, but there is only one Elvis"" said mission. Yes, he could sing, but could he cook?

If you are looking for a more sober assessment of the 68 special than provided by that fanatical fan aggregiously known as mission, I would say that Elvis had a kind of magic. I would call it a peculiar magic. Elvis was a strange man. That leather suit and weird mannerisms made him appear to be not of this earth. The whole thing gets monotonous pretty quickly but when Elvis goes off into a trance and a croon, well, I can see why mission's dentistry bills are so high. That's why he often sleeps here.

As for the controversy over Elvis coming second to Bob Dylan in the greatest musical icon poll, Bob wrote most of his own songs which gave him the edge, but the verdict is still wrong. The number one musical icon of all time (and time yet to come) has got to be Elvis Aron Presley. The state of my living room testifies to that fact.

The next day, after cremating the wife and buying a cat, I found I could not get Elvis out of my mind. Therefore the 68 special has righteously earned the sobriquet 'unforgettable'.

1360036,5,B00004W20Z,"This is one of the greatest music DVDs of all time. It chronicles Elvis Presley's 1968 NBC special with beautiful picture and sound to compliment what are the best performances of his life.

The first disc is my favorite of the three. The first thing on the disc is the orignal 1968 special, which despite it's somewhat dated editing cannot be forgotten. For the special itself was what the public saw in 1968 and what revitalized his career.

The second things on disc one are the two sit-down shows. During both of these shows (and both of the stand-up shows on disc 2), Elvis wears a black leather suit which has since became his trademark. The music consisted of an electric guitar, two acoustic guitarsm two guitar cases used as drums, and a tambourine. These shows were also the first time Elvis played electric guitar in public. During these two shows Elvis made the best music of his career. He performed his already classics such as Heartbreak Hotel, One Night, and That's All Right. He performed his lesser known songs such as When My Blue Moon Turns To Gold Again and Trying To Get To You. He performed songs he had never done such as Baby What You Want Me To Do and Tiger Man. He performed like there was no tommorow.

Disc two is my second favorite of all of the discs. The two stand-up shows begin the disc. In these shows, Elvis occasionly would play guitar, but he was also backed by an offstage band and horn section. In these two shows he performed classics such as Hound Dog, Love Me Tender, and Jailhouse Rock, which were not found on the sit-down shows. He also performed the criminally unknown peace anthem, If I Can Dream, the best song he ever recorded.

The remaining contents of the second disc include a special 2004 video of If I Can Dream, an session for an intended promotion for the special,  and all the takes of the Trouble/Guitar Man opener of the special, which provided the tone for the special perfectly.

The third disc is last as well as least. It is mostly the same things over and over, but it does give an interesting look at the real Elvis. It contains all of the takes for both of the production numbers in the show. The first of these us the gospel production number which contains Where Could I Go But To The Lord, Up Above My Head, and Saved. The second is the Guitar Man production number, which has the song Guitar Man as a running theme, but also includes the funky-country Nothingville, the too hot for TV (back in 1968) Let Yourself Go, the blues classic Big Boss Man, the ballad It Hurts Me (with a visual showing Elvis' karate skill), the Egyptian-flavored pop Little Egypt, and the 1958 Elvis classic Trouble.

My final word on the DVD set is buy it. Whether you are an Elvis fan or not, buy it. If you like music, buy it.",1101772800,,2777,4.4547244094488185

The first I like better than the second. The audience in the first one were much better behaved than the second. These group of 3 or four girls that were sitting to the left of him in the second show did nothing but squeal which took alot away from the music and you could tell that he was getting a bit irritated with them too. The commentary in the box said that the rubber mats were put down to absorb some of the noise from the stomping, but I think the stomping makes it sound better. It makes it sound like they were really having a good time. I have a three year old son and he loves to watch the stand up leather show where Elvis moves his hips, my son dances along. I liked this whole 68 special a little more than the Hawaii one. Seeing Elvis already bloated and a bit distant (strung out) is a little depressing.

This is Elvis at his best, and thank God this special has been rereleased for all to enjoy.",1096848000,,381,4.4
1360061,5,B00004W20Z,"Like a cat on the prowl, Elvis in black leather comes out to play...

The Comeback Special captures Elvis in top form and comfortable cruise control.  Forget everything he made after this.  This one shows why he was a Star.  Just before he became a cliche of himself.

This is a poignant performance that's often regarded as his most dynamic because it feels like we're experiencing an intimate night with Elvis (pre-dating MTV's Unplugged series concept) - somehow, it provided a rare look in a career that had been riddled with bad movies and over commercial moves.

When Elvis jams with his band, all the years of music that brought him to this moment resonate with a particular impact.  And we enter a very private yet public session.  This is a man comfortable with himself, yet still trying to prove that he's worthy of his fans.

You become aware of Elvis's veering on cheesy showbiz persona as he does his production numbers on cue.  They're slick and well executed BUT the key to this show's success is really the informal and affable jam session.  This is where Elvis connects with his audience and celebrates his human side.

For the diehard fans, there's a lot of extra stuff - making this a worthwhile buy for those who miss the King.

And for the uninitiated, Elvis never looked better.

A special moment indeed.",1096848000,,1326,4.683982683982684
1360062,3,B00004W20Z,"I bought this DVD with expectations of seeing some stuff I hadn't seen before.  I suppose I wasn't really disappointed, but after hearing Trouble, Heartbreak Hotel and Love Me Tender for the 5th time each I was beginning to get sick of it.  The first DVD is about all you need of these three.  The other two are worthwhile only because they show the human side of Elvis that you rarely get to see.  If you're an Elvis fan this is essential stuff, but aside from disc 1, the other two don't bear repeated viewings.

Don't expect much from this set and you won't be disappointed.",1096502400,,577,4.40566037735849
1360063,5,B00004W20Z,"The real gems in this set are the two so-called ""black-leather sit-down shows"" contained on this DVD set in their entirety.  The other portions (including the production numbers and stand-up shows) are entertaining enough, but are over-produced and more than a little corny at times.

But in the sit down shows, all the fame, fortune, money, women, gold records, movie deals, etc., fall away and Elvis is, for those two hours, just a guy jamming with his buddies ... and he rocks!  Picking up an electric guitar for the first time before an audience, he plays some of the tunes that made him a star, plus a couple very cool blues numbers, and injects them with more energy than he did even in his younger years.  He belts out the chorus on ""One Night"" with such fury that he literally looks like he's jumping out of his skin.

And the beautiful part is the sincerity of it.  Although in the production numbers and stand-up shows, he's performing strictly for the cameras, in the sit-down shows, he's playing, even despite himself, for the sheer fun of it.  Spontaneously breaking into ""Baby Whatta You Want Me To Do"" several times during both shows, he's clearly just having fun, laughing with his friends on stage between numbers, mocking himself as he performs ""Are You Lonesome Tonight"", joking as he wipes off the TV make-up, barely aware of the cameras or the audience.

With the sincerity and passion for the music that Elvis involuntarily shows in these performances, he embodies the true spirit of rock - which at that time had been buried in recording studios under psychedelic overproduction and engineering - and he comes off as cool and exciting as any performer before or since.",1093478400,,1691,4.767123287671233

1360065,4,B00004W20Z,"Overall I'm satisfied with this DVD. As mentioned, Elvis is phenomenal! Relaxed and energetic, always in control, with a voice that simply mesmerizes. I saw the special a long time ago on TV, and have been waiting eagerly for it to come out on DVD. It's there, along with the production numbers and the opening and closing sequences for the show; all on Disc 1. There a total of 3 discs, and when they say you get everything, they mean everything.

Discs 2 are 3 simply all the cuts and clips from Disc 1 that didn't make into the final show. You get to see basically the same thing over and over again as they tape it, until they finally get it right. Take 5, take 9, take 12, take 21. Check out the description; you'll notice a lot of repetition and incomplete takes.

Disc 1 is fantastic. Disc 2 is fine. Disc 3 became a little nauseous. Seeing someone in tights ballet dance across the room to 'Sometimes I Feel Like A Motherless Child' several times made me search for the fast-forward button. Seeing 5-10 minutes of just the Gospel back-up singers singing and hitting their tambourines, with Elvis' voice off-camera; next chapter please. And seeing Elvis lip-synch 'IT HURTS ME' while knocking out thugs over and over, became a little frustrating.

I would recommend buying this DVD. Elvis is great, the special is unforgettable, but it should be $24.99.",1092009600,,1360,4.634854771784233

In the ""68 Comeback Special"" you will see a gorgeous, energetic, Elvis; specially when he is singing with his original small group. It is a little bit annoying the full band that he uses for other songs.  The horns are too loud and harsh.

What I WOULD have enjoyed is hearing the commentary tracks that EPE reportedly recorded in 2003 with Scotty Moore and DJ Fontana for the sit-down segments.  What happened to that track???  Why is it that EPE just can't quite complete these projects?  Maybe it's so they can release yet ANOTHER super special edition in the next format that comes down the pike.

Then you get the complete stand up and sit down shows. The ones where Elvis totally proves he is the king and will forever be the king. These are the king of rock and roll at his best folks and they have never been released in their entirty like this. To see Elvis do ""If I can Dream"" in the black leather suit is historical.

I've read numerous Elvis biographies (the best: Peter Guralnick's two-volume set, LAST TRAIN TO MEMPHIS and CARELESS LOVE) and this TV special was one of Elvis' defining moments as the king of rock.  After 9 years of cheap movies that squandered his talents, he found the raw, emotional energy he'd tapped into at Sun Records the decade before.  There are moments when he's putting so much into a song that he's really shouting, ""No, this is me!""

1360107,5,B00004W20Z,"Critics sometimes have the tendency to over state things. To listen to some of them, you would get the impression that before the 1968 Comeback Special, Elvis was musically dead. The fact of the matter is that during the decade of the 1960's, Elvis had more top 40 hits than the Beatles did and was second ONLY to them in terms of OVERALL Billboard Chart success. If you don't believe me, feel free to check.
  What had happened to Elvis  before the 1968 television special, is that his talent and popularity was primarily channeled in the direction of making mostly formula pictures and recording a lot of movie sound tracks. This course proved to be commercially successful but creatively stifling. And by 1966, even the commercial merits of this enterprise had began to fade. Record sales and box office receipts were down but not dead. Presley was still popular and successful but not like he once was.
  In 1968, he took stock of his declining fortunes and decided to re-engage himself in the frontlines of popular music. The result was this Special and he showed the world that he could still be a cutting edge musical artist. Just like he had been from the beginning of his career until the early 1960's.

  The Special was appropriately enough produced by the SINGER Sewing company. A trim, handsome and frequently leather clad Elvis shows both his studio and television audience that he can still rock hard. During the sit down sequence Presley is accompanied by 2 of his legendary back-up musicians - drummer D.J. Fontana and the innovative Scotty Moore. Yet, even with the very capable Scotty by his side, it is Elvis who ""swaps axe"" with him and plays the electric guitar for most of the segment. He plays ably putting to derision nonsense that he can't. But more exciting is his singing. Using a roughened voice, he belts out old numbers with even greater urgency and ferocity than his original recordings of them.
  The stand up sequence is equally  exciting as Elvis prances around the stage like a tiger singing some of his greatest hits while accompanied by a full orchestra.
  During the Special, Elvis also does a Gospel segment and puts a lot of genuine feeling into these songs. Later he does a  musical sketch of sorts where he plays a ""guitar man"" trying to find his way. Just as the real Elvis was rediscovering himself.
The year 1968 saw a lot of turmoil in America. By nature, Elvis  did not discuss his social and political views in public. But he did care about others as evidenced by his many acts of kindness. Presley closes the show by expressing his hope for a better world with an impassioned musical statement called IF I CAN DREAM.  A song whose lyrics were loosely based on Dr. Martin Luther King's famous speech.
  Since Elvis left us, some people have seen fit to falsely label him a racist because he was from the South. Yet, his personal treatment of people and his commitment to this song show us that he was the very antithesis of that.
  This Special represents a pivotal moment in Elvis' career. It is also a significant moment in the history of popular music. TV GUIDE has called it the #1 music special in the history of television. After watching it you will probably agree. Even after 35 years, Elvis remains timeless in it.",1022457600,,3272,4.667247386759582

In this special, Elvis uses lyrics, dance, performance art, wardrobe and music to tell us his life story. Many feel that this performance of ""Baby,What You Want Me To Do"" ""That's All Right Mama"" ""Blue Christmas"" ""One Night With You"" ""Tiger Man"" and ""Trying To Get To You"" are the best rock and roll ever recorded. If you are not an Elvis fan, watching the sit-down jam with Scotty Moore playing his famous rockabilly licks and Elvis just being Elvis will make you a fan. I have wathced this special hudreds of times and love it more each time. My six year old son, Alec, runs in everytime I turn it on and watches enraptured. Alec says it best. ""Pap, I bet all the guys wanna be like Elvis, and, all the Girls wanna be with Elvis.""
For me watching and listening to the Prophet that God chose to introduce the world to rock and roll is a sacred, spiritual experience.
******Commonly referred to as The `68 Special or The `68 Comeback. The actual name of this landmark television special is ELVIS. The sixties had brought about great change in music and pop culture. Change for which Elvis helped pave the way over a decade earlier when he exploded onto the scene with his unique blending of pop, rock, country, R&B and gospel influences. Focusing on his Hollywood movie career in the sixties, Elvis has become less a part of the current pop cultural scene. He has been making one movie after another, and many of the records he has put out in these years have been movie soundtrack albums. In the fifties and early sixties, the films and film-related records were wonderfully successful, but as the sixties have worn on, the movies and records, though still profitable, have not been nearly so successful as they were before. Elvis has reached the supreme level of frustration with the state of his career and all its limitations on his creativity and artistic expression. He had hoped to become a serious actor, but Hollywood had other ideas and Elvis went along with them. His opportunities to show his true talents as an actor have been few. He is beyond ready for a change. By now, it has been more than seven years since Elvis has appeared in front of a live audience. Elvis has missed the closeness of his audience, the energy and excitement of live performing. The '68 Special opens with Elvis singing a hot new version of the gutsy ""Trouble"", from his 1958 film King Creole. This segues into Guitar Man, which, with its semi-autobiographical lyrics, becomes the underlying theme of the show. Then, Elvis is reunited with two of his original fifties band members, guitarist Scotty Moore and drummer D.J. Fontana. (Bass player Bill Black has been deceased for several years by this time.) They sit together on stage in the round, along with several other friends and associates of Elvis for an informal session of singing, jamming, and swapping stories. Parts of this jam session are woven throughout the show. There are also sequences of Elvis taking the stage alone and performing many of his greatest hit rockers and ballads, and he introduces a new song, Memories. One can surmise that he pours out years of career frustration and pent-up creative energy into the performance of these songs. His natural talent, charisma, sensuality and stage presence have not been diminished by the years in Hollywood. In fact, he looks, sounds, moves and grooves better than he ever has. At 33, he is better than he has ever been. Better than anybody in the business. For the group jam session segments and solo stage performances Elvis wears a two-piece black leather outfit specially designed for the show by Bill Belew, who also designed all the other wardrobe Elvis and the cast wear in the show. The look evokes the era of James Dean and the Marlon Brando type motorcycle films of the fifties, the era when Elvis was first proclaimed the King of Rock 'n' Roll. In one of the jam session segments, Elvis speaks of the gospel origins of rock and roll. This segues into the gospel music portion of the show, which has Elvis wearing a two-piece burgundy suit, singing ""Where Could I Go But to the Lord,"" ""Up Above My Head"" and ""I'm Saved,"" backed by the female vocal group, The Blossoms, and accompanied by a troupe of dancers - all of this for a rousing gospel production number. Toward the end of the special Elvis appears in a lengthy production number that, through song, dance, karate, and various situations, traces a young man's journey from a struggling guitar player, through the challenges, dangers and compromises on the path to his dreams of success and superstardom. Something is lost along the way. Once the dream is achieved, the man realizes that he remains unfulfilled, that he has abandoned his true self. He decides to return to his roots, doing what made him happiest, what he does best. He sings ""I'll never be more than what I am... a swingin' little guitar man."" The parallels to Elvis' own life are clear and deliberate, and his doing the `68 special represents his own return to his true self, to his roots. Free from the confines of his Hollywood grind, this is Elvis the singer, the performer, the musician, the man - the real Elvis. At the end of the special, Elvis appears alone wearing a simple white two-piece suit, standing in front of the towering backdrop of red lights that spell ELVIS. He sings a brand new song, ""If I Can Dream,"" especially written for the show. The writers created the song based upon conversations with Elvis about his own thoughts on what was happening in the turbulent sixties. It seemed appropriate that he close the show with a personal statement. His powerful and passionate performance of this song of hope for mankind is one of the most brilliant moments of his singing career.",999648000,,5859,4.700389105058366

1360112,5,B00004W20Z,"OF COURSE THIS WAS A GREAT SHOW! THE KING AT HIS BEST!  THIS WAS ELVIS'S BIRTHDAY GIFT TO ME. 12-3-68 WAS MY 21ST BIRTHDAY. I HAD 125 PEOPLE AT MY  HOUSE AND HALF OF US WERE IN MY ROOM WATCHING THE KINGS CONCERT COMEBACK.  SO THE CONCERT WAS NOT RECORDED 12-3 BUT ORGINALLY AIRED THAT DATE. IT WAS  TAPED IN JULY,1968. AS THE STORY GOES ELVIS'S MANAGER TOM PARKER WAS AGAINST  ELVIS DOING THIS SHOW AND TOOK THE TICKETS FOR THE 2ND SHOW.IF YOU NOTICE  WHEN ELVIS IS SINGING ON THE SMALL STAGE WITH THE AUDIENCE SITTING AROUND  IT THEY ARE ONLY 4 DEEP. THE PRODUCERS RAN DOWN TO BOB'S BIG BOY IN TULUCA  LAKE AND ASKED THE PEOPLE EATING THERE IF THEY WANTED TO GO SEE ELVIS !",966988800,,674,4.170542635658915
1360113,4,B00004W20Z,"Okay, this is a 5 star special.  Any Elvis Presley fans will want to own Elvis' 1968 TV special, and most probably already have it on VHS.  The  question is....is the DVD worth purchasing?
To start, the DVD is not  complete.  Evidently, there was some issue about the rights to ""Are  you lonesome tonight?"" so this song is NOT to be found on the DVD.  Other from that, I didn't find anything missing from the DVD.  The picture  quality is a little soft, a little grainy, and looks like the show was  recorded on videotape.  Of course, all of this is how the special looked in  the first place, so it's not a big deal.  In fact, given the limitations of  TV broadcasts back in the 60s, the picture quality is acceptable.  The  soundtrack has the original mono soundtrack.  There is also a 5.1 dolby  digital remix which sounds good but is maybe a little bass-heavy.  Young  fans weaned on ultra-glossy DVDs of recent films may be disappointed with  the picture/sound quality, but those of us who grew up on Elvis will  absolutely love the DVD, which is pretty much the best the special has  looked and sounded.  The main issue is whether or not to purchase this  particular edition....or wait and hope that a future second edition will  contain the deleted song.  It's a toss-up.  Personally, I am happy I bought  the DVD and I will probably listen to it quite often!
Other than the  special itself, there is little else on the DVD.  There is a website  link-up and a small slide show.  That's it.  I would have liked a subtitles  option (who wouldn't want to sing along with Elvis?).  Or how about some  outtakes?  So, given the incompleteness of the DVD, I can only rate the DVD  4 stars, although the special itself is 5 stars.
One last thing - this is  obviously a 1960s product.  The production numbers have a surreal, almost  psychedelic quality to them.  Elvis himself is in superb voice, and he  delivers a performance that cements his image as the king of rock and roll.  But Elvis fans already know this.  To the uninitiated, there is probably no  better way to see the King at the height of his powers as in this special!  Recommended!",966816000,,2145,4.492146596858639
1360114,5,B00004W20Z,"We just returned from Memphis where we had the pleasure of viewing the new ""That's The Way It Is."" Let me tell you, this will be the  greatest Elvis product EVER.  It was amazing to say the least. The huge  crowd went CRAZY. The sound and the images were out of this world. First  movie I have ever attended where flash camera's were exploding all during  the film. The film we saw was 97 minutes long. The dvd version will have an  extra 60 minutes of excitement. The street date will be January 9th. I am  still excited. Can't wait till January 9th.",966470400,,551,4.29126213592233
