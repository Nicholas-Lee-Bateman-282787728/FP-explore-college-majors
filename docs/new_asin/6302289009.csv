450489,4,6302289009,"I don't often comment on films beyond a simple ""I liked that"" or ""I didn't like that"". However... ""Dead Again"" is a bit of a turkey given the unbelievability of the plot (which seems to me to  have been crafted simply as a vehicle for showing the two lead actors in  their real-life couple role). Nonetheless, it sports fine acting from a  mixed and talented cast (including, to my surprise and intrigue) Robin  Williams. And Patrick Doyle contributes a memorable score as always.  Kenneth Branagh's accent does chafe a little in places, but his acting  (such as the opening scene when one of his characters is on death row) is  priceless. Interesting and well-made, though not in all respects.",947808000,,694,4.781512605042017
450490,3,6302289009,"This movie probably has too many cinema gimmicks to be taken too seriously--Hitchcock, Huston, etc.--but is a lot of fun.  Robin Williams' bit part as a defrocked psychiatrist is, I think, his greatest screen part,  a completely different characterization as a vengeful, bitter soul.  If he  could put the same legitimate drama into his other ""serious""  roles, he would really arrive as an actor.  Derek Jacobi is always a  pleasure to watch, and I think that Emma and Kenneth had some great fun  with these roles.",939772800,2,514,4.895348837209302
450491,5,6302289009,"I've been a mystery fan for as long as I can remember, and ''Dead Again''was a delicious whodunit which satisfied my cravings, keeping me on the edge of my seat as we rode the dizzying roller coaster between  black-and-white flashbacks and present-day color, and if anyone has another  mystery video in their collection which they've considered near and dear  to their hearts, GET RID OF IT, GET THEE TO A VIDEO STORE, and rent, if not  BUY, ''Dead Again''! You won't be disappointed!",926035200,,484,4.795180722891566
450492,5,6302289009,"A brilliant and brilliantly-realized film using modern film techniques to  evoke the best old films. A young woman suffering from amnesia and violent  nightmares turns to a cynical private detective to help her uncover not  only her present, but also explore her past, as they begin to suspect she's  been reincarnated after a violent murder in the '40's. Kenneth Branagh  directs a superb screenplay by Scott Frank and plays two roles (as does  Emma Thompson and a few bit players). The film is shot in black and white  AND color, with both stars using different accents and realizing two  complete performances each. Cleverly, the script has characters both  believing in -- and not believing in -- the idea of reincarnation, which  gives depth and balance to both cynics and romantics in the audience.  Beautiful film score by Patrick Doyle, which only heightens the melodrama.  Everything about this film is tops (including an uncredited performance by  Robin Williams -- and it's a gem). I'll never understand why it never  received a single Oscar nomination -- Hollywood, you've done it again! If  you truly love thrillers, this is one you can't afford to miss!

450493,5,6302289009,"This is one of the best films I have seen in many years.  What makes Dead Again so wonderful is the great script and especially the gripping performances by everyone in the cast, especially Emma Thompson, Kenneth Branagh and Andy Garca, magnificent as always.

Twists and turns.",1506211200,,88,4.933333333333334
450575,5,6302289009,"""Dead Again"" is a psychological thriller that grabs you from the first frame of the title montage and doesn't let go until the climax.  While it has a supernatural-themed plot, the conclusion is nicely grounded in reality. The highest compliment I can give this film is that it stands up to multiple viewings, even long after you're well acquainted with the surprise ending.  The performances and atmosphere are just fun to watch.  You can tell Branagh had great passion for this project -- his second directorial outing, after 1989's ""Henry V"" -- and quite a departure from Shakespeare.  There are delightful touches of experimentation throughout -- some, perhaps a little over the top, but never enough to be distracting. Cameo performances by Robin Williams as Doctor Cozy Carlisle and Andy Garcia as Gray Baker.  Glad to see Branagh back in the mystery genre with a remake of Agatha Christies ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (2017) where he directs and plays the lead role of detective Hercule Poirot.",1505865600,,1004,4.9880239520958085

450673,2,6302289009,"In order for this to work viewers must accept hypnosis and reincarnation. Otherwise, the whole thing makes no sense. That would be a first inconvenient, but I would be ready to suspend disbelief and accept both unscientific concepts if only they were handled with verisimilitude. In my opinion that hasn't happened here.
Dead Again tips its hat to some Hitchcock productions but it also fails to turn as good as, say, Vertigo, Rebecca or Spellbound, the films this one resembles most. Something is not right with the music. Unlike Hermann's melodramatic and overboard score for Vertigo, for example, which nevertheless makes a mark on the listener, the score here is also heavy handed but it fails to leave a melodic impression.
By far the worst aspect of this film is its plot, which starts intriguing but it goes downward as minutes (too many) pass. The final ten minutes are involuntarily laughable. It is impossible to swallow the many absurdities they contain.",1487980800,,965,5.0

DEAD AGAIN: 1949: L.A. composer Roman Strauss (Branagh) gets the chair for murdering his wife Margaret (Thompson). He claims he loved her, thoughand that this is all far from over. Fast forward to 1991, where low-rent P.I. Mike Church (also played by Branagh) gets stuck baby-sitting amnesiac Grace (also played by Thompson), whos been traumatized into silence by a pair of scissorsthe Strauss murder weapon.

Enter flaming antiques dealer Franklin (Jacobi), who uses hypnotic regression to help her. Under his spell, she regains her voice and her memory. But its a memory of a past incarnation, in which she finds herself reliving the Strauss fatal attraction. A nutjob defrocked shrink (Robin Williams, in an uncredited role) explains the karmic credit plan, speculating that Mike and Grace might be the Strausses reincarnatedand fated to repeat their experiences. Before long, personal history is indeed repeating itselfbut through a mirror, darkly. No one understands the rules of karma, however, so whose life is at risk this time around? Will it be replay, revengeor are they both pawns in a game far more complicated than they could ever guess?

Discussion: Is it incredible coincidence or cosmic conspiracy? Even the question indicates the larger-than-life nature of this stylish thriller. Part Hitchcockian psychological suspenser (with a New Age twist), part film noir mystery with romance, this is a giddy, tongue-in-cheek romp played dead straight, despite its grandiose gestures.

Much of its appeal lies in watching a bunch of classical actors happily slumming in a B-movie; beyond that are velvety black and white flashbacks and an ending that overlaps past and present plots to come full circle for karmic (and poetic) justice. If you just accept the born-again premise of overlapping, interlocking lives, you're in for some unpredictable intrigue and real suspenseas well as some outlandish fun.",1423180800,,2167,5.182857142857143

451132,5,6302289009,"If you have thought that Kenneth Branagh was an excellent actor but not particularly sexy or romantic, you have never seen him in ""Dead Again."" Believe me, unless you have ice in your veins, this film will quicken your pulse much more than his ""Henry V"" ever did. Back when Emma and Kenneth were married to one another, they made this movie together. It is so Hitchcock worthy that if there were such a prize, this film should have won it hands down.  These two are second to none with acting ability. Put them in a Hithcock like film and they make others trying the same look like rank amateurs.

We open in a earlier time in Hollywood in the earlier part of the twentieth century. Kenneth and Emma are married to one another and are superstars. She is brutally murdered. He is convicted of killing her and is executed. He claims to the end that someone set him up. Cut to present day and we have two people, Emma and Kenneth again, as two characters who could not be any less like that glamorous duo. Yet it seems as if they have been reincarnated both as to solve the crime as well as to find one another again.

There is a heck of a twist coming in this movie and it is beyond clever. My hat goes off to whomever came up with that brilliant and startling part of the screenplay.

If you hate thrillers, suspense, Hithcock, etc., never fear as this is also a love story at its very best. When I heard that the two of them split in real life, it was almost as if the two characters in this film had split and thus very sad.

It goes back n forth in time to reveal a very lovely romantic murder mystery that is just too good to pass up. It might be too dramatic for some people, but for the right romantically inclined it's a dream come true. Definitely for the crybabies, because that's what I did, cry, even though I wasn't expecting it. I definitely need to by it, at least for Robin Williams' sake.

I bought it because I remembered the (unbilled) performance of the late, great Robin Williams. Excellent support also from Andy Garcia and Derek Jacobi.

It's one of the most complicated, intricate plots I can recall, and all is handled beautifully thanks to fine direction and excellent editing.
There are red herrings, plot switches, flashbacks, and gender-bending, all kept together by Branagh, creating an exciting and riveting narrative. It's also the first (as I recall) serious dramatic performance from Robin Williams, perhaps channeling inner demons, and it's a knock-out performance, unbilled when released.",1409443200,8,762,5.512820512820513

451184,4,6302289009,"Directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh, DEAD AGAIN is an excellent neo-noir with a supernatural gender-bending twist. He and Emma Thompson play two roles: a contemporary P.I. and the woman with amnesia that he's helping, plus in 1947, a composer exile from Nazi Germany and his musician wife.

In this nicely done b&w earlier tale, Branagh is sentenced to die for murdering Thompson, but may not have killed her. These past lives and the pair's previous connection emerges only when Derek Jacobi hypnotizes them in the modern story. It's a very interesting movie, has a unique resolution and is totally worth seeing.

The opening frame sounds the alarm, and the title sequence montage has you trembling over the stop button.

Among its other sins, at times this ""thriller"" seems to think it's a comedy. If you're a fan of Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson's other fine works, you'll especially want to skip this one.

It's a real shame--after wasting $8-$10 on this movie, you'll naturally want to see it to its conclusion despite all the warning signs that it's not going to get any better.

451476,1,6302289009,"Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson had quite a run.  She basically debuted herself in his 1989 directorial debut `Henry V' and went on to work with him in quite a few films, mostly of Shakespearian origin, and they built this mini-empire of sorts, proving to be the definitive couple for modern takes on Shakespeare classics.  I've always had a soft spot for both, even though I wouldn't call myself a direct fan.  I don't always buy Thompson's naturalness, and Branagh is certainly pigeonholed for a reason.  That said, there is something about them that I am drawn to, and I happen to secretly look forward to each film of theirs I happen to discover.

The idea of them teaming up for a Hitchcock type thriller instead of a Shakespeare adaptation had me excited.

This film is a disaster.  First of all, none of it really makes sense.  The novelty concept of past lives is nothing more than a poorly conceived gimmick here and it never is sold effectively.  Instead the film lacks any real pulse.  I mean, the thrills are borderline absurd, and the conclusion (and that traumatic fight scene) is laughable to watch.  The flashbacks are filmed nicely (in a contrasted black and white) but they are dull, and the modern-day romance that is supposed to link them is equally boring.  The acting is spotty as well.  Branagh and Thompson are so lifeless here, I just couldn't invest in their relationship at all.  Branagh delivers a marvelous accent, I'll give him that, but he has no discernible charm here.  Wayne Knight should have never started acting.  I hate him.  The only light here is the impeccable Derek Jacobi who tries desperately to save this film but is ultimately swallowed up by the ridiculous ending.

I'm not even sure that this film had promise to begin with, but whatever the case; it is completely squandered of all real merit.  It's just downright TERRIBLE.",1339459200,4,1875,4.74922600619195

Others have complained of his accent but it sounds right to me for a 1990s Los Angeles character. The plot, briefly, is that a mystery woman appears in a west Los Angeles orphanage with amnesia. She is having nightmares and does not know who she is. The priest calls a private detective who grew up in that orphanage and who he knows will do an identity search for free for the orphanage. He starts to take her to the LA County psych ward (No longer there) but a nightmarish scene there convinces him to take her home while he searches for her identity. Robin Williams plays an interesting role as a disgraced psychiatrist working in a meat market. He has some serious advice for Mike, the Branaugh character, Derek Jacobi plays a charming villain and the story has twists and turns that startle the audience. It is very well done. Andy Garcia plays a reporter who basically tells the story which has two setting, one in 1948. It is one of my favorite movies.

451480,5,6302289009,"While this film may not make total sense to its viewer because it is steeped in fast talk and moves quickly to advance its plot, in many ways it is reminiscent of the great stuff that sudios like Warner Bros. cranked out in the forties and quite often starred the likes of Humphrey Bogart or John Garfield.
This film flips between a modern day Los Angeles and Los Angeles of the late '40's. The theme here is supressed memories from another life that ended in murder and using the memories to solve the long closed cold case. Added into the mix is amnesia, a shifty art dealer played by Derek Jacobi, and a love story that travels from the past to the present and then back again.
This was the american film debut of the acting tour de force of the '90's, Kenneth Brannaugh and Emma Thompson.  Unfortunately, they subsequently divorced and haven't been professionally paired since their parting, but this is a taut and suspenseful film that nicely displays Brannaugh's talent for accents and Thompson's emotional versatility and neatly illustrates how they got their highly esteemed reputation as an acting couple.
Much as I liked the script and the acting, I loved the way Los Angeles was used as a large and expansive movie set. Enhanced by the vintage cars of the '40's and the wonderful real estate, the script the cinematography, and the acting were merged to create a thriller that kept my attention from start to finish.
I first saw this film in the theater when it was released, and watch it periodically on dvd. I still enjoy it as much as I did after my first viewing. I think it has held up very well and is as enjoyable to me as any of my favorite films of the '40's.",1316044800,4,1679,4.5230263157894735

He and Emma Thompson play two roles: a contemporary P.I. and the woman with amnesia that he's helping, plus in 1947, a composer exile from Nazi Germany and his musician wife.

In this nicely done b&w earlier tale, Branagh is sentenced to die for murdering Thompson, but may not have killed her. These past lives and the pair's previous connection emerges only when Derek Jacobi hypnotizes them in the modern story. It's a very interesting movie, has a unique resolution and is totally worth seeing.

451515,5,6302289009,"This movie, named ""DEAD AGAIN"", will thrill you, again and again, each time you see it!

I saw this movie, seemingly a long time ago, and remember very few of trhe details.  However, two scenes spoke Volumes to me.  Each was extranious, as far as the main plot went -- they could have been left out, and the play, as they say, would have gone on very nicely.  But their inlusion made ""DEAD AGAIN"" so much richer a film!

SPOILER__ALERT___________________________________

The first (I think) scene came when one of leading players of the move, was at the entrance to a big Hollywood studio, and was about to go in.  A young boy came up to him, and asked: ""Are You Anybody""?
The man replied that he was a music composer for the films.  ""Naw --you're not anybody"", replied the little boy ( ! )

The other scene appears towards the end of the movie.  One of the leading characters is in bed with the emphazema which soon will kill him.  (I don't remember whether he was at home or in the hospital).  Anyway, as the other characters question him, you can see that he has had a HOLE made in the center of the he outide of his throat, just big enough for a cigarette to be inserted.  Talk about being addicted!!!!!

This is an exciting movie, full of unexpected plot twists and turns.
It is a literate movie, very, very well-written, and quite witty at times.  The music is tuneful, but not over-whelming.  I keep remembering, especially, the two scenes described above.  Again and again!  This in not exactly a Shakespearean movie -- but IS the sort of movie that Shakespeare might have written, had he been around in the later years of the 20th- / early years of the 21st centuries.  ""DEAD AGAIN"" is a suspenseful little classic that deserves to be better known!",1293062400,,1758,4.506329113924051
451516,4,6302289009,"I watched this without voiceover commentary, then watched it with Kenneth Branagh's commentary, and he was so funny in places, it was as good or better than watching the film. Very dry self-deprecating wit here. I like the use of a reincarnation theme, which one can take seriously or not and still enjoy the film.

Dead Again is a nice combination of suspense, humor, and romance, but there are a few flaws near the end that force one to accept things that don't make sense. You have to have an inordinate willing suspension of disbelief to ""buy"" the big climax in its entirety. Neither director Branagh nor the screenwriter satisfactorily explain it in their separate commentaries in the Special Features.

Sir Kenneth Branagh, Emma Thompson, Derek Jacobi and Robin Williams are all very enjoyable to watch so it's annoying that this insult to the audience was in the film. I still enjoyed it though. Branagh and Thompson do a wonderful job with dual roles using German, American, and British accents! I would call the film ""daring and imaginative."" Try it.",1292544000,3,1059,4.877777777777778

The story is great, with lots of suspense, and the acting.....well!

Mr. Branagh is a superb and very engaging actor, enigmatic, beautiful voice and

in one of the roles he plays in the movie, carries a sense of humor that you can

tell it is all his own, and not to do with the plot..Robin Williams is not only
a fabulous comedian, but an accomplished and very intense actor.

Mr. Jacobi and Ms. Thompson are perfect in their roles and Mr. Garcia once more

proved that his cuban good looks and his acting should be more exploited by the

film industry.",1290729600,,632,4.305084745762712
451518,2,6302289009,"Put aside for a moment the melodramatic overacting, the heavy handed musical score, and the bad American accents, and just focus on the premise - 40 years ago a composer was put to death for the presumed murder of his wife. Now flash forward - a woman who matches exactly the murdered wife develops amnesia, goes to the home she was murdered in which is now an orphanage, and the priest takes pity on her and asks one of his former inmates/orphans to try to discover her identity and, lo and behold, it turns out the detective/orphan looks exactly like the composer. Wait, that's not all. Turns out they are the reincarnated essence of the ill fated couple. Wait, that's not all. Turns out the reincarnation machine switched souls, so that the man is now the woman and the woman is now the man.

If you're still there, then there are some guilty little pleasures in what is otherwise an absurd film. For example, Derek Jacobi snarling and stuttering and then leaping through the air with a murderous shout, or Wayne Knight trying his best not to upset his pizza while all around him mayhem wrecks havoc and people are being shot, stabbed, and impaled, or Andy Garcia taking a drag on a cigarette through his trej hole.

Kenneth Branagh stars and directs. This was his second film as a director, following a very successful ""Henry V"" in 1989. Though I've enjoyed his Shakespearean adaptations (e.g., ""Henry V"", ""Much Ado About Nothing""), his other directorial efforts have not been totally satisfactory (e.g, ""The Magic Flute"", ""Frankenstein""). Unfortunately his acting seems to parallel this pattern - he does extremely well in Shakespearean roles but not so well in more modern tales.

Branagh's onscreen wife is his (then) off screen wife Emma Thompson. They married in 1989 during Henry V and divorced in 1995. Thompson is usually great, hence her 4 Oscar nominations and one win (""Howard's End"", 1992), but in this film she falls flat. Apparently flashing your big brown eyes  and looking lost were her two major character developments, but in an actress of her caliber, this isn't enough.",1289865600,4,2093,4.821727019498607
451519,5,6302289009,I am gland I remembered this movie.  It is a murder mystery with a reincarnaiton twist.  I love unpredictable movies.  You need to watch it a few times to catch the details.,1288051200,,173,4.34375
451520,5,6302289009,"I don't know where to begin. I really don't, other than to say that this is an incredible piece of cinema history.
It deserves more recognition than it's received. It should be a classic that everyone knows, front to back, and it should be rerun on TV like all classic movies are. (And it does deserve the ""classic"" title.)

This is a movie that seems run of the mill low brow, but isn't. It seems simple and straightforward, but it's rather cerebral and brainy, and yes, you can feel the British sophistication in the finished product, and we the audience are better for having experienced it.

Some may say that pacing's a bit slow, and I'll be fair, I can see that. At first, it doesn't quite grab you, or at least it's not evident at first. But the story is so engrossing and each scene immerses you deeply into the film, that you lose track of time, and you eagerly await each new scene. You cannot help it, you're absolutely compelled to watch this film. After a bit of time, you don't even notice the pace, and when you look at the finished product in it's entirety, you see that the pace was perfect and fit so well. This was incredibly well made and it shows.

And then the performances... an absolutely wonderful cast. Each actor and actress perfect for their respective roles, and they sell it so well, you forget that you're watching Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson. You see Mike and Grace, you see them as real people, with real emotional wounds, and when you take a step back and see that it is Branagh and Thompson, you're even more impressed.

Andy Garcia is a terrific actor, and a bit underused in this film, but...(and this is a testament to the talented abilities of Branagh), he's utilized well. His few moments have such a tremendous impact, and his performance so powerful, that if he had been given more screentime, he could've easily stolen the show in many a scene.

Robin Williams...his performance was partially a negative for me. His acting? Oh so good. It was great to see him play a serious role that wasn't a sicko (One Hour Photo) or an insane goofball (Er...just pick a movie, lol), and he handled it well. My only problem with it was the excessive and gratuitous profanity. Now, don't think of me as a prude, because I do understand that some art in this form does call for such language, and in certain parts of this movie it was used and correctly, but past a certain point, his profanity actually took some of the class out of it and dragged the whole thing down a bit. But, even with that, I can't knock the film down a point, nor his performance.

One thing about this film is that it showed me that Branagh is not afraid to share the limelight with his costars. Each and every one of them had the chance to steal the show and make us forget about the main characters or even the story and have it turn back into a run of the mill Hollywood flick, but there was enough willpower in those actors, and the right amount of command out of Branagh to rein it in and tie it all together in a beautiful movie that is simply stunning.

And I must say that Branagh (Scottish) and Thompson (British) pulled off their American accents almost flawlessly. One or two brief seconds you hear just a bit of it slipping through, but 99% of the time they have it down perfect. So much so that if you were to see this movie first, before ever knowing who they are, you'd have thought they were 100% US born and raised. The fact that they could use different accents and do it all so well further proves that their talent is not only incredible, it should be praised. Then you get into the story, the acting, and the directing? Overwhelming.

I thought the black and white for the flashbacks was a nice touch. It not only helped people differentiate between the two timelines, but it added a bit of class to an otherwise already beautiful set of scenes. They were simply gorgeous and I feel that color would've cheapened them. Would've made them the same as any other film out there.

The ending scene (which I won't spoil) is beautiful and heartfelt and surprising in a movie that's mostly dark for the bulk of it's run.

I don't know how better I can say it than I already have, but I must recommend it, at the very least. This is a gem that should be shared with everyone. This is a film of great substance and it's simply wonderful.

A solid A+ for me.

451521,4,6302289009,"This story, taking place in present day, is about an unnamed woman (Emma Thompson) who has reoccurring nightmares about a man named Roman Strauss who, in the 1940's, was convicted and sentenced to death for killing his wife Margaret Strauss. What's interesting is that this unnamed woman and Margaret look identical.  Also interesting is this unnamed woman lost her memory and voice due to a traumatic experience, unknown to her and the audience.

One day, a private eye named Mike Church (Kenneth Branagh), who happens to look identical to Roman Strauss in the dreams, is instructed to transport this unnamed woman (whom he's calls ""Grace"") to a mental hospital. Once there, Mike decides to have Grace stay at his place instead, so he can take her to a hypnotist (Derek Jacobi) who might uncover some of her traumatic memories.

As the hypnotist unlocks more scenes from her dreams, the events leading up to the 1940's tragedy start playing out in present day between Mike and Grace.  This builds suspense as we wonder if Mike will end up killing Grace the way Roman killed Margaret.  To complicate the plot, other suspicious characters enter the picture making us wonder if Mike was wrongly accused.  With the killer's identity unclear, how can Grace prevent history from repeating itself?

This is a very entertaining and compelling movie to watch. The acting is pretty good and there's good chemistry between Branagh and Thompson (it helps that these actors were married at the time).  I also like that the dreams are in black and white to give you the feeling you're in the 1940s.

However, there were 3 scenes that didn't add up for me. The first was when Grace meets Mike and isn't startled or alarmed that he looks identical to Roman Strauss. The second is when the hypnotist shows Mike and Grace a photo of Roman and Margaret Strauss, neither look startled or alarmed that they look identical to this couple.  And third, given how the movie ends, the first scene between Roman and a detective (Andy Garcia) doesn't make sense.

Other than that, and an end fight scene that looked kind of silly, this story is well played.  I recommend it to those looking for a suspenseful mystery.",1277683200,4,2190,4.810666666666667
451522,3,6302289009,"Dead Again: 5 out of 10: On-screen chemistry is a funny thing. Some couples simply have it. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan make a cute believable couple; William Powell and Myrna Loy in their fourteen films together are in my mind the silvers screens best pairing.

On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson have no onscreen chemistry whatsoever. One might say despite the fact they were married, yet I would argue that too often whatever chemistry causes an off-screen couple to hook-up simply does not translate to the movies. In fact in many cases it seems to create a negative chemistry onscreen. (Think Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.)

Since Dead Again is at its heart a love story, the lack of chemistry is deadly. Branagh and Thompson play two couples. The first, filmed in beautiful black and white, are an angry World War 2 refugee and opera composer and his murdered wife. He goes to the chair for her murder and we flash forward to Branagh as a missing persons detective and Thompson as a crazy mute lady with amnesia. They may be connected to the previous couple and both stories are told alternately throughout the film.

The film itself (in particular the black and white flashbacks) is gorgeous, yet Branagh as a director plays too many tricks for his own good. He cribs so liberally from Hitchcock that the film threatens to turn into High Anxiety 2 rather than an original work.

Without the chemistry between the leads we are left with little more than a hundred film school in-jokes and a strange sci-fi mystical story that we simply have no stake in.",1256083200,2,1572,4.684782608695652

Dead Again is, in my opinion, a classic case of a book quality movie. What does this mean? It means I find this representation to be all that a book would be but in movie realism. Every time I've watched this movie, I find something new and unique to this story, something that connects the past characters, Margret and Grace or Roman and Mike, together. Some are obvious after only one or two viewings. The slight stutter of our friendly ""Laughing Duke"" antiquity dealer, the spilling of the Champaign glass  by Margret in the first regression scene. Other's, the `To Margret' toast of the same scene where Roman declares his date to have more charm then Grace, the way Gray Baker holds on to Mike's hand just a smidge too long while looking at it almost, dare I say, lovingly, are subtler examples that make this movie hands down one of thee most interesting, intricate love stories of all time. The relationships are real, not just fluffy prose. The action is believable, the devastation palpable and the score truly embodies, I believe, what this love story is all about. Hardships, loyalty, love, connection, Karma. I gained my first real look into the Karmic world via Dead Again and have believed whole heartedly in it every since. As a writer I thoroughly enjoyed the not one, but two daring plot twists. They are both, what I consider to be, the very definition of shock value. If your looking for an unlikely, non average romance then this is the movie for you. The action is as fulfilling as the story and  the climax will not leave you with that `really I just wasted two hours watching that?' feeling by any means.",1236038400,3,1648,4.6563573883161515

451561,4,6302289009,"Kenneth Branagh's film Dead Again is a superbly crafted thriller that cleverly combines film noir, supernatural suspense, melodrama, and romance. Branagh (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-V/dp/079284615X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry V</a>) pulls double duty, both directing and starring in this stylish update of the mystery genre. The film stars Branagh and his wife Emma Thompson in dual-roles, as well as featuring an impressive supporting cast including Andy Garcia, Derek Jacobi, Hanna Schygulla, Wayne Knight, and Robin Williams.
The film utilizes all of the trappings of a Hitchcock picture, while remaining completely original and contemporary. Though at times pretentious and over the top, Dead Again is a welcome return to a genre that in recent years has been dormant and waiting to be resurrected.

When L.A. private investigator Mike Church is asked to help an emotionally troubled amnesiac woman discover her identity, he is plunged into a mystery that will forever alter both of their lives. After an antiques dealer hypnotizes the woman, they trace her troubles to a murder in the past. In 1948 famous opera composer Roman Strauss was blamed for the murder of his wife, Margaret. Could the answer to this woman's troubles lie in a past life experience. As Mike and the woman learn more about Roman and Margaret, they find themselves falling in love. But then it seems possible that Margaret's killer may still be alive and looking to kill again. Soon Mike discovers the truth, but is it too late to stop history from repeating itself?

The film features an appropriately operatic finale, which is heightened by the dramatic musical score, composed by Patrick Doyle.
Contrived, convoluted, and manipulative, Dead Again received mixed reviews mainly because some critics failed to understand the more humorous elements of the plot. The film's screenplay was written by Scott Frank, who imbues the story with both ironic humor and melodramatic romance. Yet this is part of the film's overall charm. Both Branagh and Scott are clearly having fun with the genre, referencing filmmakers like Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock.
In the end, Dead Again is an effective thriller that will have audiences screaming and laughing one minute, gasping the next, and finally catching their breath after the climax.

451563,4,6302289009,"Accomplished British actors Kenneth Branagh, Emma Thompson (his wife at the time this film was made), the always fascinating Derek Jacobi, and in supporting roles, Andy Garcia, German actress Hanna Schygulla, and Robin Williams, round out a stellar cast that, by itself, would make this film worth your time.  They give this intriguing story of the turn of karmic wheels energy and charm.  I must say that I find the review featured on Amazon by ""The New Yorker"" to be incomprehensible and so wide of the mark that the magazine might have been reviewing a different film.  When I saw this film in New York City, audiences applauded enthusiastically at the end.

In addition to its terrific cast, ""Dead Again"" is well-written, fast-paced, and stylishly produced - it was also directed by its star, Branagh.  It weaves together two stories of what at first seems like two distinct pairs of lovers: foreign-born conductor Roman Strauss and his pianist-wife Margaret in the post-war 1940s, and Los Angeles private investigator Mike Church and an amnesiac who cannot remember who she is in the 1990s.  Both pairs of lovers are played by Branagh and Thompson.  As Church and the amnesiac try to figure out why she cannot remember who she is, and why she is terrified of scissors, they keep bumping up against the forty-year mystery of Margaret's murder, for which Roman was convicted and executed.  Also interested in untangling the increasingly apparent overlap between the past and the present are a slightly sinister antiques dealer with a talent for hypnosis (Jacobi), and journalist Andy Garcia, now an ancient wreck in a nursing home, who once knew both Roman and Margaret.  Robin Williams makes the most of a small role as an eccentric ex-psychiatrist (unfrocked for sleeping with one of his patients) now working as a stockboy for a supermarket, whose experiences with a former patient begin to convince the doubting Church that the past may indeed be seeping into the present.

The conclusion of the film, with its unexpected twist, drew exclamations from the audience I saw this film with.  The overlapping stories are woven tightly together, there isn't a boring moment in the movie, the characters are all sharply drawn, and the catchy, propulsive score is by Patrick Doyle (who also did fine scores for Branagh's ""Henry V"", for ""Indochine"", and the remake of ""The End of the Affair"").  The opinion of the venerable ""The New Yorker"" notwithstanding (perhaps it's a bit too venerable to see beyond its snobbist pseudo-intellectualism), this is an enjoyable and well-constructed suspense film.",1201651200,2,2597,5.056206088992974

Jacobi, as a dodgy antique dealer who hypnotizes people was bad enough but, when he took his subjects into past lives to find their antiques, it just got ridiculous.

Very little that the main actors did was convincing and much of it was irrelevant and confusing to the plot. The switching of accents was as farcical as it was incompetent - ditto, the constant flash backs in black and white.

If the movie, and the story, were consistently awful, the finale excelled. Even ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" tried to give rationale to characters being fatally shot, and stabbed, but still fighting on. Was it only the crazed operatic accompaniment in ""Dead Again"" that finally caused them to be all ""Dead Again?"" For how long one asked?

451596,3,6302289009,"This minority report says that DEAD AGAIN could have been, but is not, a great film.  DEAD AGAIN was obviously made as a loving parody of the Hitchcock/film noir genre, because some scenes, camera work and music are so broad that the tongue positively sticks through the cheek.  However, much of the movie is played straight, and thus, overall, the tone is confused.  My minority report says that the American accents of Branagh and Thompson, both superb British actors, were not convincing.  In fact, their efforts to sound American in their modern ""incarnations"" caused their acting to suffer.  Branagh thinks that to sound American is to be a Noo Yawkuh (sorta), and Thompson is so busy trying to sound Amurik'n that her character lacks luster, even taking into account that the character is a victim of amnesia walking around in a perpetual state of hyper-vigilance, caution, confusion and/or dread.  Similarly, I disagree that the performance of Robin Williams was good.  His character was creepy for no particular reason, although one sinister close-up of him looking back at our protagonists hints at some darker purpose, which is never revealed.  Just another ""fake out"" in the service of phony film noir suspense.

Yes, the film has a very clever plot twist at the end.  But my minority report has a serious bone to pick with those reviewers who feel that DEAD AGAIN holds up on second viewing, once you know the secret:  A major flaw involves the sloppy use of flashbacks in the form of hypnotic regressions that are performed on Branagh or Thompson by Derek Jacobi's antique dealer-hypnotist.  Although ostensibly coming from either Branagh's or Thompson's hypnosis session, the flashbacks frequently reveal both their actions, even when they're separated from each other at the time.  For example, during one of Branagh's hypnosis sessions, he recalls being inside at a party, having a conversation with another man, while simultaneously somehow recalling Thompson and Garcia outside having a conversation in the garden.  It's impossible for Branagh to have been in two places at once.  He couldn't possibly have heard or seen the interaction between Thompson and Garcia that is supposed to be a product of his own memory.  The audience thus receives more information than it logically should.  This method of plot exposition is fundamentally flawed.

And somebody please explain to me how a person that's been stabbed deeply in the knee with a sharp pair of scissors can still walk, or how somebody who's been shot at close range in the left side of the chest can revive themselves sufficiently to fight on and survive.

Add up these annoying inconsistencies and deficiencies (and others I won't bother to list here), and place them side by side with the earnest and committed work of otherwise excellent actors.  You end up with a 3-star movie: entertaining in a campy, kitschy kind of way, but not great, as it might have been.

He affects a perfect American accent (you'd think he actually grew up in LA), and plays a double role as a German composer in the '40s.

Emma Thompson, in her first 'big' film role after appearing briefly in 'Henry V', looks great and acts well playing an amnesiac who starts having dreams of her past life. The script is slow to start but it picks up nicely during the latter half. Many plot devices are used to set up a tone of suspense which culminates wonderfully in the last scene.

Branagh's acting, I believe, though brilliant in most of his other work, is slightly two-dimensional here. However, Emma Thompson picks up his slack and the two talents mesh quite nicely and the film is enjoyable overall. The last few scenes, especially, kept me on the edge of my seat. And, while the majority of the plot was predictable, the last twist just came out of the blue and totally surprised me.

Robbin Williams and Derek Jacobi add nice touches to the supporting cast, each shining in his own moments. Patrick Doyle's score also adds another dimension to this film. His exciting compositions where appropriate really contribute to the heightened suspense of the story.

On the whole a very enjoyable film, especially if you're an Emma Thompson/Kenneth Branagh fan. They look so adorable together...",1141603200,2,1593,5.0227272727272725

451637,5,6302289009,"No, Kenneth Branagh was not arguing his British heritage, he's trying to convince amnesia victim Emma Thompson that he is not the reincarnation of her former life husband who is trying to kill her.  The supernatural meets Hitchcock meets American classic film noir, and Kenneth Branagh managed to complete this gear shifting, classy film for it's day.  It got great reviews in 1991, it's still considered to be top notch 15 years later (judging by all these reviews.)  With a super cast: Andy Garcia, Thompson and Branagh, Wayne Knight, Campbell Scott, Robin Williams (in a scene stealing performance) and veteran foreign actress, Hanna Schygulla, who plays a small but key role.  Branagh, actually doesn't play a Brit either, he plays two roles: the quirky American private eye, Mike Church, and the overbearing, German composer/conductor husband, Roman Strauss.

It was a real change of pace from the Die Hard type thrillers that were being hammered out at that time, but it was a welcome change.  When I originally saw it back then, I could tell that although different, I was definitely watching something special.

Branagh, hot off the success of his first film, Henry V, where he was director and star, he managed to pull off this gem of a thriller, again taking both director and lead actor roles.  It proves that he is one talented fellow, and his former wife does an even better job perfecting her American accent.  Emma Thompson is radiant in both roles, one set in the past and her supposedly reincarnated self in the future.

Not a fast paced thriller, but it has it's moments, and the twist ending is really juicy.  I also liked the visuals and cinematography, especially in the black and white sequences.  It had a simple, but stylish look, which I think makes it hold up very well today.  One of the best films of the early 90's.",1138665600,5,1844,4.7974683544303796

The cast includes his then-wife Emma Thompson, Derek Jacobi (a frequent collaborator of Branagh's, on film/stage), Andy Garcia (the young cop in ""The Untouchables"" opposite Kevin Costner, Sir Sean Connery and Robert DeNiro) and Robin Williams (TV's ""Mork And Mindy,"" ""Aladdin""), here proving that he can step out of his usual shtick (see ""One Hour Photo"" and ""Insomnia"" if you want to catch him out of his fan-loved comedy routine of movies). The intriguing plot involves Mike Church (Branagh, sporting an entirely credible American accent), a hardbitten, but softhearted detective in L.A. who stumbles upon ""Grace"" (Thompson, also sporting a credible American accent), a woman who has no voice and no memory, but who always wakes up screaming in the night, victimized by horrible nightmares. When a noted hypnotist (Jacobi, in a devilishly sinister performance) offers to help discover the source of her nightmares and her true identity, a shocking revelation is uncovered, setting up a breakneck montage of chills and thrills to the film's end. The film's opening of a newspaper clipping that screams ""MURDER!!"" is enough to hook anyone who enjoys nods to Hitchcock's films (particularly to the Master Of Suspense's well-executed classic ""Dial M For Murder,"" in this film). Andy Garcia and Robin Williams appear in small, but significant roles, as do Hannah S. and Gregor Hesse. Branagh's use of flashbacks is very well done. He and Emma Thompson were entirely convincing with American accents, as both of them are British and not many actors can pull off another accent, one of them being Jodie Foster in ""Anna And The King.""

451688,2,6302289009,"Considering the high caliber of the British cast (Kenneth Branagh, Emma Thompson, Derek Jacobi), DEAD AGAIN is notable for being so corny.
Mike Church (Branagh) is a Los Angeles private gumshoe whose specialty is tracing missing persons. As a favor, he agrees to discover the identity of Grace (Thompson), an amnesiac who climbed over a fence to take refuge in a Catholic orphanage and who suffers nightmares that keep everyone awake from her screaming. Put under hypnosis by mesmerist/antique dealer Franklyn Madison (Jacobi), Grace reveals memories of the relationship between composer Roman Strauss (Branagh again) and his wife Margaret Strauss (Thompson again). In the late 1940s, Roman was convicted of fatally stabbing Margaret in the neck with a scissors, a crime for which he was executed in 1949. Franklyn drags out an old issue of ""Life"" magazine, and, golly, isn't it amazing how much Mike and Grace physically resemble Roman and Margaret. Subsequently, Mike goes under hypnosis also and ... well, you get the idea. And every chance the director (Branagh yet again) gets, he points the camera at a big, pointy scissors lying on Mike's living room table waiting for some mischief to get into.
At times, I wondered whether DEAD AGAIN was being presented as a comedy, drama, or parody. The too loud music soundtrack favored either the first or last. But, I finally decided on drama because the actors seemed to be taking the plot sufficiently seriously. Then, they overplayed their parts just to show the audience that they were having a jolly good time. (There were shots of a terrified Grace that almost had me laughing for their absurdity.) The result - a mess. There are some decent plot twists at the end, which, if the script could have evolved with more subtlety, would have resulted in an infinitely better suspense film and not such a silly melodrama.
Branagh, Thompson and Jacobi - what were they thinking?",1072483200,6,1924,4.996884735202492
451689,4,6302289009,"I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi channel several years ago, and was quite surprised by the quality of the film.  The acting is top-notch, and the story is filled with plenty of twists, but not so that it contradicts itself.  Many times, I can spot the twist endings in movies before they're revealed, but the twist in ""Dead Again"" truly took me by surprise.  I dinged it a star for a couple of reasons:
1.) There's questionable editing in one portion of the movie (when Church decides to get hypnotized--it feels like there's a scene missing there.)
2.) The climax.  Not that the story wasn't concluded in the appropriate manner, it's just that the camera work is distracting to the main action, what with cutting between Church and Grace and their past lives.
Despite these minor flaws, ""Dead Again"" is my favorite suspense movie.",1070150400,2,829,4.696551724137931
451690,5,6302289009,"Dead Again is a brilliant psychological thriller! It's riveting and breathtakingly suspenseful from start to finish, directed with style by Kenneth Branagh. Many imaginative homages to Hitchock--and this is as good as anything the master has directed. Branagh fashions a fascinating puzzle that contains its share of action, romance, dry wit, and (of course) twists & turns. And, unlike most thrillers, there's a distinct element of unpredictability to the latter.
Dead Again is a tale of parallel stories in different time frames. The first, which transpires in post-World War II Los Angeles and is presented entirely through black-and-white flashbacks, relates the tragic romance of Roman and Margaret Strauss (Branagh and his then-wife, Emma Thompson). Roman, a German expatriate, is a world-famous composer and conductor, and Margaret, a Brit relocated to North America, is an up-and-coming musician. They meet when Roman conducts Margaret's orchestra, and it's love at first sight. They are soon married, but their fairytale existence begins to fray. Margaret is suspicious that Roman's housekeeper, Inga (Hanna Schygulla), and her son, Frankie (Gregor Hesse), may be stealing from Roman. He, in turn, is wary of her relationship with a reporter named Gray Baker (Andy Garcia), who appears to be exceeding the bounds of friendly propriety. This all leads to murder (I'm not giving anything away here, since this is revealed during an opening montage of newspaper clippings). Margaret is stabbed to death using a pair of scissors, an expensive anklet is stolen, and Roman is arrested and convicted. He goes to the electric chair claiming to be innocent.
The other part of the story occurs in 1991 Los Angeles, where a solitary private investigator, Mike Church (Branagh), has been requested by a local priest to uncover the identity of a pretty woman (Thompson) who has lost her voice and her memory. (She is given the faux name of Grace.) Mike's friend, newspaper man Pete (Wayne Knight), puts her photograph in the local paper, and the only respondent is a hypnotist/junk dealer named Franklyn Madison (Derek Jacobi), who believes that a trauma from the woman's past life may be causing her mute amnesia. He puts ""Grace"" under, and she begins to see visions from Roman and Margaret's life. She regains her voice, but not her memory, and, as she and Mike grow closer, she cannot avoid noticing similarities between their relationship and that of Roman and Margaret. As she looks more deeply into the past, she begins to fear Mike, sensing that he could be Roman re-incarnated and that the murder of 45 years ago may be about to happen again. Then, when Mike agrees to be hypnotized, he uncovers a startling secret.
Although Dead Again's story is complicated, Branagh presents it in a clear, straightforward manner that leaves little room for confusion. Each of the plot twists is exposed with suitable buildup, maintaining viewer interest. The characters, both past and present, are remarkably well-developed, and there is a legitimate sense of uncertainty concerning Roman's guilt. He may have gone to the electric chair for Margaret's murder, but did he really commit the deed? Branagh keeps us guessing until the plot demands the disclosure of the truth. When it comes to interweaving the two stories and offering a fulfilling resolution, Branagh and screenwriter Scott Frank do not disappoint us.
This definitely stands out as one of the most intriguing and memorable thrillers of the 1990s. My heart nearly stopped beating during the very intense finale. All in all, a wonderful flick - highly entertaining and intriguing; a great throwback to film noir with a kicky karmic twist. Recommended!",1055980800,6,3703,5.193979933110368
451691,4,6302289009,"Dead Again was my first exposure to both Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson, and it is a film that I am very fond of. I remember seeing it for the first time late one evening when I was home alone; I couldn't have been more than 12 years old at the time. The film really made a big impression on me: the dramatic music, the swirling camera moves, not to mention the genuinly creepy performance by Branagh as Roman Strauss, really scared me. So much so that I didn't sleep that night. Today it doesn't scare me that much - but it is an entertaining film nevertheless. The plot is a classic murder mystery with a supernatural twist. If you can accept the theatrics of the script and Branagh's direction, it is a very exiting and engrossing film; the kind of stylish, noir-thiller which does not get made any longer. Hitchcock would have loved it, I'm sure. And if you have a fondness for old Hollywood-style thillers, Dead Again is certainly worth your money.",1045267200,2,956,4.5
451692,4,6302289009,"Although he received tremendous praise for his memorable film production of Shakespeare's HENRY V, DEAD AGAIN was the film that really introduced actor/director Kenneth Branagh to mainstream American film, and for a time he and then-wife Emma Thompson were the most celebrated acting couple since Olivier and Leigh.  The marriage did not last, but fortunately this film did--and I say fortunately, for although it is somewhat forgotten today, DEAD AGAIN is an overlooked jewel of a film: classy, noir-ish, stylish, and very memorable indeed.
The story is fanciful.  In the late 1940s noted composer Roman Strauss was convicted of mudering his noted pianist wife Margaret, and was sentenced to death.  Some forty years later, a young woman suffering from amnesia falls into the hands of a no-nonsense Los Angeles private eye--and under hypnosis she recalls not her immediate past, but the lives of Roman and Margaret.  Is this reincarnation?  Is she Margaret Strauss?  Is the private eye to whom she is attracted but of whom she is also strangely fearful the reincarnation of Roman Strauss, Margaret's killer?  Is history repeating itself?
Scott Frank's clever script makes for a fast-paced, twisting, and fascinating plot-driven film--and it is flawlessly played by Branagh and Thompson, who assume dual roles as the 1940s Roman and Margaret Strauss and the 1980s Mike Church and Grace.  The supporting cast is also excellent, with memorable performances by Andy Garcia and Derek Jacobi--and a truly exceptional cameo by Robin Williams, who here for the first time demonstrated that his talents went far beyond comedy.  The shifts between past and present, nightmare and reality are exceedingly well done, and although the plot becomes more and more fantastic the entire film is so perfectly executed that one buys into it every step of the way.
If DEAD AGAIN has a flaw, it is that some of the twists and turns are predictable--but in the film's favor I must admit that it sweeps you along so quickly that you seldom have time to analyse that failing while you actually watch the film.  It is also to a certain extent a ""one trick pony"" film; the film is at its most powerful upon a first viewing, when one is oblivious to what is coming.  But even so, it is tremendously effective and it holds up as well today as when it first appeared on the big screen.  The DVD includes little in the way of extras beyond commentary tracks by producer Lindsay Doran, writer Scott Frank, and director-star Kenneth Branagh--and these are as hit-and-miss as commentary tracks usually are, but they hit more often than miss.  The picture and sound quality is overall very good.  Recommended!",1044662400,56,2676,4.997747747747748
451693,4,6302289009,"Buy into the high theatricality of Branagh's film noir melodrama and you'll have a ball with this picture. Scott Frank's deliciously devious screenplay about reincarnation, murder and love relies on twists, turns and sudden revelations which he unwinds with the skill of master storyteller (so much so that you probably won't even notice his blatant cheats which allow reincarnated souls to narrate events they never witnessed). His script fell into just the right hands with Branagh. An actor-director not generally known for restraint when it comes to the bold theatrical gesture, Branagh plays the material at full volume, taking it to the brink of hilarity - or well beyond, depending on your tastes. In particular, the slow-mo finale with its black-and-white dissolves and frenzied operatic overture will either have chills running down your spine, or hysterical laughter bursting from your lungs. Either way, it's an experience. The performances are all solid, but Derek Jacobi steals the show as antique merchant and hypnotist Franklyn Madson, deftly shifting between campy charity and predatory menace. Wrap it all up with a moody, classic-Hollywood shooting style (with plenty of nods to Hitchcock) and Patrick Doyle's cheeky operatic score, and you have all the ingredients of a minor classic. The DVD commentaries are enjoyable, too - Scott Frank and producer Lindsay Doran make an hilarious double act. It's especially interesting to hear that the final cut is less unintentionally funny than some earlier versions - the original climax apparently had Jacobi slipping to his death on a slice of pizza.

451716,4,6302289009,"DEAD AGAIN is a highly underrated suspense/thriller from 1991 that was also the inspiration for Dream Theater's 1999 masterpiece SCENES FROM A MEMORY.  After watching the movie and listening to the album afterwards, there are a lot of similarities in the plot.  I'm not accusing DT of ripping off the story, since they put their own spin on it and the characters in SFAM have different motives than the ones in DEAD AGAIN.  Personally, I perfer SFAM because it's like a movie written in music which is more original, but this movie is still worth checking out.
Kenneth Branagh (who also directed the film) stars as Mike Church, a smooth L.A. investigator who knows how to talk to people and get secrets out of them.  His next case, however, is much more difficult.  He's assigned by a Catholic rehab center to take away one of their guests, an amnesiac woman (Emma Thompson) who doesn't talk much and keeps screaming in the middle of the night.  The reason she screams is because she has nightmares of a man named Roman Strauss killing her with a pair of scissors.  Mike decides to let her stay at his house, but even he doesn't know why he's suddenly drawn to her.
Out of nowhere comes a man named Franklin (Derek Jacobi) who turns out to be a hypnotherapist and is drawn to the woman's story.  Franklin practices in hypnotic regression, meaning that he hypnotizes people that act like somebody else from a past life during the session.  As it turns out, the woman (now called Grace by Mike) was actually Margaret Strauss, Roman's wife, in the 1940's.  And in another strange twist, Mike turns out to be Roman reincarnated.  Mike starts to fall hard for Grace, but when she starts to think that he might actually be Roman, that's where the tension begins to unravel.
The story is very interesting for the most part and the twists are pretty nifty, if not predictable.  I like the fact that the scenes in the '40s were filmed in black and white and the scenes in 1991 were filmed in color.  A perfect balance between past and present.  Also, the acting is very good.  There's even a hilarious supporting performance by Robin Williams as a former psychiatrist who now works at a supermarket ever since he was caught having an affair with a patient.
My only problem is that the ending is kind of disappointing.  After the finale, you want more explanations.  They gave enough throughout the movie, but at least one more to bring a forthright conclusion.  Oh, well.  That's more of a wish than a plot point.

My supreme disappointment with the easily predicted The Usual Suspects has taught me to approach such recommendations with extreme caution. Fortunately, Dead Again was so thoroughly enjoyable that my extreme caution will be at least temporarily lifted.
Kenneth Branagh sheds his all-too-familiar Shakespearean persona to don that of Mike Church, an L.A. private investigator who gets involved with trying to piece back together the life of the woman he calls ""Grace"" (Emma Thompson): a woman who suffers from amnesia coupled with debilitatingly frightening dreams. These dreams are presented to us as an alternate reality -- filmed in black and white -- which is eventually further explored by an amateur hypnotist. The plot is highly engaging from the start, mostly due to superb characterization in the writing, and excellent acting to back it up (watch for the extended Robin Williams cameo).
There are parts where the directing is a bit heavy-handed. If you're at all familiar with Branagh's directing, though, you'll probably expect this from the outset. It works more often in his Shakespeare films than it does here, but you'll find yourself so involved in the plot that you'll excuse Branagh's occasional directorial overdramatization. Just as you can forgive his overzealous American accent.
Overall, this is just a fun film. The tone is decidedly dark, but the plot rolls along with such a rapid pace that it becomes a fun ride to see what happens next.",989884800,3,1596,5.166023166023166

451723,5,6302289009,"Two reincarnated lovers, a mysterious 1940's murder, anmesia, a hard-boiled LA detective ... it's film noir on steroids!  Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are wonderful in playing all four leads, sliding back and forth between 1948 black-and-white and 1991 color in a complex intercut storyline.  Andy Garcia, Derek Jacobi, and Robin Williams are also excellent in their quirky roles.  It is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again to see what you missed the last time around.  The DVD edition is particularly worthwhile because it has two separate commentary tracks, one by director-star Kenneth Branagh and the other by the producer and the screen writer.  Together, these commentaries supply a mountain of background information on how the movie came about and what decisions were made during filming.",973814400,10,817,5.206106870229007
451724,5,6302289009,"Following on the heels of the overwhelmingly successful HENRY V, Keneth  Branagh, child prodigy of the British Theatre, chose the screenplay DEAD  AGAIN for his followup venture.  In an American interview, he stated at the  time that he decided to make a fun little Hollywood film....which if it was  horrible, he could merely return to England and continue on acting on the  stage.  This little hollywood film is absolutley brilliant, stylish, and  fun.  It has all of the elements of a film noir and ultimately it satisfies  the viewers.  Now with the DVD version, FINALLY available, I can introduce  my friends to this classic.
The DVD is not perfect.  The picture is a  little grainy at times, which leads me to believe that more effort could  have been taken in cleaning it up.  However, it has some nice extras,  including a director's commentary, by Branagh, something that is sorely  lacking on Much Ado About Nothing and Henry V (I won't mention  Frankenstein, because I seem to be the only person in the world who thought  Branagh's version was great fun).
You simply won't find a more  entertaining film than DEAD AGAIN.  And even though the plot surprises will  only grab you the first time, it is a movie that can be enjoyed again and  again.",965606400,3,1255,4.730232558139535
451833,4,6302289009,"I just loved this movie.  I saw it in the theatre & it was just great.  Emma Thompson & Kenneth Branaugh both deliver wonderful performances  playing dual roles.  The flashbacks to the 1940's were so believable &  intricate.  This movie contains many little twists & turns along the  way.  Look for some of the same actors to show up in the past and the  present.
Andy Garcia & Robin Williams both have small but significant  roles in this movie.  I especially enjoyed Williams' role as the  psychiatrist turned stockboy!  He adds much insight to the whole  reincarnation aspect of this movie.  Karma is a bitch!
The DVD is a  little lacking in the Special Features department, though.  Only commentary  tracks.  Although the commentary from Branaugh himself is quite fun to  listen to.

451834,4,6302289009,"I'm an Emma Thompson fan and have seen all her films including those she made with her now ex-husband Kenneth Branagh (their recent breakup occurred over ""another woman"" reputed to be Helena Bonham Carter). My all  time favorite by this pair of actors is ""Much Ado About Nothing.""  ""Dead Again"" is probably my least favorite film, however, Miss  Thompson is a fabulous actress, so a bad day for her is good day for most  other actresses.
The storyline of this film is interesting, particularly  for those who think past lives are possible. According to one of the main  characters, we not only have past lives, but everyone with whom you shared  a past life shows up again in some form in the next life.  It's as if human  existence consists of a repertory company playing endless roles through  eternity.  Well, why not.  I have a lot of unfinished business with various  people I've lost in this life and there is some comfort in thinking I might  get closure in the next life, or the one after that...or the one after  that.
Branagh must have been attracted to this script because of it's  Shakespearen elements...dreams, ghosts, unfinished business, a jealous  husband killing an innocent wife (or being framed for the deed), and  downright wickedness (out damn spot, out).
Derek Jacobi (Cadfael and  Claudius) plays an eccentric antique dealer who tries to help the haunted  Miss Thompson (nameless at first) through regressive hypnosis. Regressive  hypnosis is used by psychiatrists to help trauma victims remember events  they have subconsciously blocked that cause conscious distress.
Miss  Thompson has been exhibiting some very distressed behaviour.  Mike Church  (Branagh) was raised at the Catholic convent school where Miss Thompson was  found one dark and stormy night. The senior clergy have asked Mike to help  Miss Thompson.
But, what if the patient remembers events from a previous  life, and what if that person was not the victim at all but rather a  witness...or worse yet, the perpetrator of the crime?
This film must be  what is considered ""high camp"" as it is obvious to me a great  deal of tongue in cheek stuff is going on.  Picture a disturbed artist with  a loft full of paintings, sculptures, etc. all depicting one or more pairs  of sharp scissors. Jacobi's antiques dealer isn't the only eccentric in  LA.
The actors had a great deal of fun making this film and while I was  scared the first time I watched it, the next time it struck me as really  funny. Too bad Kenneth and Emma aren't ""Together Again.""",964915200,10,2536,4.841121495327103

451836,4,6302289009,"Branagh follows his first film ""Henry V"" with a fun tribute to classic cinema thrillers.  When you look at the cliched elements of ""Dead Again"" by themselves (film noir, private detective,  hypnosis, past lives/reincanation, lost lovers, etc) this film could have  been a big flop.  Instead, it uses them as an homage to those styles.
The  DVD includes the trailler (which is great fun), commentary from the  producer and screenwriter, as well as a separate commentary by  actor/director Kenneth Branagh.  He seems to really enjoy doing this  commentary, and I hope he does more commentary tracks for his other films.  It seems his ""Henry V"" DVD has no such directorial analysis...  which is such a pity as his insights into ""Dead Again"" are great  to jog the memory and provide a few laughs.
If you haven't seen this  film, give it a shot... but temper the great reviews with a grain of salt,  otherwise you'll expect too much.  Just make some popcorn, turn the lights  down, and bring a date... you should get a kick out of it.",963360000,2,1029,4.696629213483146
451837,5,6302289009,"Kenneth Brannagh proves in Dead Again that he can bring outstanding  dramatic performances to movies other than Shakespearean works.  He and  then-wife Emma Thompson play strangers who meet who may have met in a  previous life (the concept of reincarnation plays heavily on the plot.)  Black and white and color filming alternate cleverly as the setting  flip-flops from the 90s to the 50s.  Andy Garcia also does a fine job in  the movie.  Look for Robin Williams to give a stellar bit performance.  Telling much more about the movie would give it away to those who have not  seen it, but what's important is that Brannagh and Thompson are both  unknowingly involved in a 40 year old murder case and the movie has a very  surprise ending.  In fact even though the term ""Hitcockian"" has  been widely overused (to the point of running it into the ground) the  ending to this movie actually deserves that title.  An absolute stellar  movie on all accounts.",962582400,3,954,4.748466257668712
451838,5,6302289009,"Thompson and Branagh both play dual roles in this beautifully filmed thriller.  To fully enjoy this film you have to go with the premise of the  reincarnation.  But, once there, you find Thompson playing an woman who  lost her memory and her voice.  Branagh is the detective, Mike Church who  is going to help her find both.
Little about this film is predictable. I  hesitate about writing too much; it could give away some of the plot twists  and take away some of the fun of watching ""Dead Again"".
Andy  Garcia and Robin Williams each have supporting roles.  (William's role is  surprisingly small.)
Unfortunately, the use strong language is  distracting and unnecessary.  It was probably the the cause of the R rating  and it reminds the viewer that this is not a ""Hitchcock"" film. If  you can overlook this small flaw and have enjoyed movies like ""The  Usual Suspects"", I suspect that you will enjoy ""Dead Again""",958867200,3,916,4.738853503184713

451840,5,6302289009,"In the Hollywood world of the same plots and stories, this film always stands to the side as an original. At the time of this film's release, the idea of past lives, Karma, and reincarnation had not yet been beaten to  death...so I found it to be very entertaining, and a film I still watch  from time to time on a rainy afternoon.
An interesting story that  captures you from the beginning and leaves you guessing ""Who Done  It?"" all the way to the end. The reviewers who deem this worthy of  Hitchcock are absolutely correct!
Both Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson  are fabulous in this film...the chemistry between them is undeniable. Such  a shame that it didn't work out for them in real life. This was a departure  from the traditional Shakespearean roles that Branagh plays, however, his  character in this film(as is Thompson's)is one you can warm up to  immediately. The imagery and flashbacks to the 1940's are wonderful...you  can tell that they were well orchestrated and are delivered with class. The  film has a completely engrossing storyline as well...so many angles to  absorb, so many possible endings pop into your head that the true ending is  a surprise.
Wonderful performances by Derek Jacobi...he is tastily  diabolical in this, as well as Andy Garcia (as the jaded reporter) and  Robin Williams.
Even the most die hard hecklers of past lives theories  and Karma can't help but enjoy this film...a very believable, entertaining  film that you'll want to see more than once!",951091200,37,1496,4.845849802371541

7823946,3,6302289009,"A bit over-rated by other reviews in my opinion, judging only from the number of stars people are giving it (I didn't actually read them). Very slow and almost uninteresting first third of the movie. There, the acting is a bit cardboard and it seemed like a parody of these movie-types.

Having survived that first third, the second third seemed better and flowed better...the gradual reveal of the story in the middle at least kept moving...

Yeah, things moved along until the end when it folded back into weakness. Yes, there are a number of good elements in this as the past lives are twisted to be something other than you would originally think. But it is unbelievable in how the one guy approaches Margaret, facing her holding the gun. Who would push forward that way facing a woman with a gun? No one I can imagine. And how many shots does that tiny antique pistol hold anyway? Way too many to be believable, apparently. Overlapping scenes to show comparisons of past and current lives....doesn't work.

On the positive side, Robin Williams is totally believable in his role (as he usually is). Watch his mannerisms as he does what he does. It is what made him so good. But his minor role doesn't come anywhere near saving the movie.",1506384000,,1241,4.657534246575342
