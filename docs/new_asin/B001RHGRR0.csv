8337975,3,B001RHGRR0,"This collection of World War II documentaries features stories of the American response to the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japanese forces on December 7, 1941. Film by and narrated by some of Hollywood's finest, such as John Ford and Ronald Reagan(!), these classic narratives highlight battles throughout the Pacific theater of the war as the Allies attempt to drive back the Imperial Japanese forces, which had conquered much of the Pacific islands and lands in Asia. Witness the strength and reserve of the American armed forces as the country rises up to face the challenge of the aggressive foes to freedom and democracy.

I think this is a decent collection of documentaries, History buffs and people who enjoy watching old documentaries about the Wars will have a great time watching these 9 episodes. The quality of some of these documentaries is not great, but overall I think it's a good watch. Enjoy ! :)
