7963182,4,B000067JJG,"1.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: RVD vs Eddie Guerrero (c)

As were all their encounters with each other in 2002, RVD vs Eddie was a fantastic opening bout. Highly athletic and consistently fast paced in action. After Van Dam misses a 5 Star Frog Splash, Guerrero grabs his Intercontinental Championship and tries to hit RVD with it and the referee tries to stop him but Eddie shoves him, resulting in a DQ. After the match, Eddie hilariously chases the referee around the ring before re-entering the ring and getting taken attacked by RVD. RVD finishes off the attack with a 5 Star Frog Splash

Terri tries to interview Molly Holly and Jazz backstage about their tag team match but Molly interrupts her saying she and Jazz have a problem with her as well as Trish and Jacqueline and the rest of the divas, saying any woman that would exploit her body is trash. She goes on to show a UK newspaper with topless women and declares that the UK is filled with sleeze and trash. Terri says that Molly and Jazz are jealous and shows them her boobs (not topless of course)

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Trish Stratus and Jacqueline vs Jazz and Molly Holly

Jazz and Molly start the match off cheap shotting Trish and Jacqueline. Fairly standard tag team match. The heels work over Jacqueline until she makes the hot tag to Trish who gets the momentum rolling but she's stopped by Molly. Trish goes on to get dominated by Jazz and Molly for a few minutes. Jacqueline comes back in and we get a chaotic ending with all 4 participants in the ring. Trish hits the Stratusfaction on Jazz while Jacqueline DDTs Molly. They both make pins and the referee counts them both, awarding Trish and Jacqueline the match. It was a fairly good tag team match

X-Pac is backstage swinging nunchucks around (I never understood X-Pac's obsession with nunchucks) preparing for his match when Scott Hall walks in. Pac tells Hall if he doesn't win the match, he's never coming back to England and walks off carrying the injured Kane's mask

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Bradshaw vs X-Pac

On paper this sounded like an awfully boring match and unfortunately it played out the same way in the ring. Complete bore fest beginning to end. This was almost if not as boring as Bradshaw's match with Scott Hall at Backlash. I find it rather sad that Hulk Hogan of all people was the only member of the WWE's NWO that had any great and memorable matches in 2002. X-Pac busts Bradshaw open in the opening minutes of the match, slamming his face repeatedly into an exposed turnbuckle. Winding down to this sleeper matches final minutes, Scott Hall comes to ringside and nails Bradshaw in the head with X-Pac's nunchucks while the referee's back was turned. X-Pac makes the pin but Bradshaw still gets the shoulder up. X-Pac finishes off Bradshaw with a low blow and the X-Factor for the win. Boring match to say the least. Just skip the match unless you want to get bored and possibly dose off during it

Jonathan Coachman interviews The Undertaker about his match with Triple H in the main event. Undertaker says he will show no remorse in the beating he gives Triple H. Undertaker takes a line from his Deadman gimmick and says all of Triple H's hopes of beating him will Rest In Peace

4.) WWF Hardcore Championship Match: Steven Richards (c) vs Booker T

Booker starts the match off beating the heck out of Steven before going to the outside and throwing in a bunch of weapons. But with each weapon Booker tosses in the ring, Richards just as easily kicks it out. Booker eventually gets in a sick shot to Richards' back with a steel lunch tray. Booker spends a great portion of the early part of the match working over Richards. Into the second half and up to the end, it becomes more back and forth with Richards and Booker getting in their shots. In the end Booker gets the win with a Book End on Richards. However just seconds into Booker's victory, Crash Holly runs to the ring and wins the title with a roll up on Booker. Crash mocks Booker after the match and gets caught with a Scissors Kick from Booker. Booker pins Crash to win back the title. Once again though, seconds into his victory, Booker is attacked, this time by Tommy Dreamer and Justin Credible. Booker fights them off and celebrates with a Spinaroonie. This time he's attacked with a low blow by Jazz. Steven Richards comes back in and flapjacks Booker through a table and pins him to win back the title. This was a fun bout, especially with all the classic post-match run-in shenanigans that were common in Hardcore matches back then

Backstage, Paul Heyman tells Shawn Stasiak to stay on Planet Stasiak aka the apron during his tag team match with Brock Lesnar and let Brock do all the work. Lesnar threatens Stasiak saying that if he doesn't listen to Heyman, the beating he gave him on Raw will be a walk in the park compared to what he does to him if he doesn't listen

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) The Hardy Boyz vs Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman and Shawn Stasiak

Stasiak rushes to the ring and starts the match attacking Jeff Hardy. Shawn, still on Planet Stasiak completely ignores all of Heyman's yelling at him. Lesnar prevents the Hardyz from performing the Poetry In Motion on Stasiak and tags himself in. Lesnar picks apart Matt with relative ease as Heyman coaches the Next Big Thing from ringside. Stasiak ends up tagging himself back in while Matt makes the hot tag to Jeff. Stasiak is taken apart and falls victim to a Twist of Fate from Matt followed by a Swanton Bomb from Jeff who makes the cover for the win. Lesnar attacks the Hardyz after the match with the F5 before attacking Stasiak with a spinebuster. Lesnar takes Stasiak out with a spinning powerbomb for good measure before making his exit

A recap of the Insurrextion Make a Wish Foundation dinner is shown

In a backstage interview, Jonathan Coachman gets William Regal's thoughts about his European Championship match against Spike Dudley in his hometown. Regal says that he's a true Brit and the people of England disgust him, calling them underachieving dossers who have no hope or future.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) WWF European Championship Match: Spike Dudley (c) vs William Regal

Match starts with back and forth shots between Regal and Spike. Spike misses the Dudley Dog omething and lands on his ankle. The referee has a trainer come to look at it. The trainer and referee get Spike out of the ring and try to take him to the back to get his ankle treated but Regal attacks him and throws him back in the ring. Regal works over the injured ankle and Spike surprises Regal with an inside cradle pin for the win to retain the title. After the match, Regal takes his brass knuckles and levels Spike in between the eyes with the Power of the Punch to a mixed reaction from the UK crowd.

Ric Flair comes to the ring in a referee shirt and announces that in order to make sure the NWO doesn't interfere in the match, he's making himself the outside special referee.",1433721600,,8222,5.538707102952913

The Trish Stratus/Jacqueline-Molly Holly/Jazz tag team match was a hard-hitting/solid bout. The X-Pac-Bradshaw match was not great but pretty good and the same goes for the Booker T-Steven Richards-Hardcore title match. The tag team match between The Hardy Boys & the team of Brock Lesnar & Shawn Stasiak(What?)was so-so with pretty solid action. The Spike Dudley-William Regal-European title match was a fast-pace,hard-hitting bout. The match between The Big Show & Steve Austin while slow at times,it was still a entertaining,hard-hitting brawl and the same goes for the match between The Undertaker & HHH but that match was not slow to say the least.

7963187,3,B000067JJG,"Eddie Guerrero VS RVD: The preview said Eddie won the title a few days ago. Its a basic rematch that you'd see on Raw. A very good match but the ending sucked.

Trish @ Jackie VS Molly @ Jazz: Four women who can wrestle. Too bad I still don't care about women's wrestling.

Before the match we see Scott Hall and X-Pac talking. This was before Hall was fired and gained some weight, he actully looks healthy.

X-Pac VS Bradshaw: I believe this was when Bradshaw was waging war on a crappy version of NWO. This match sucked, I like Bradshaw as JBL instead.

Coach says the world title match is the most anticipated match in the history of the WWE. Talk about over selling an event that is just seen in the UK.

Steven Richards VS Booker T: I miss the hardcore title, it gave alot of wrestlers something to do. I don't care for either man and this match wasn't so great.

Hardy Boyz VS Shawn Stasiak and Brock Lensar: A stupid booked match. Lensar says he beat Stasiak on Raw that week, so why are they teaming? Oh because Hardys had booked a tag team match and he needed a partner. Anyways, a basic squash job and a waste of time. Fans really aren't getting there money's worth so far.

Spike Dudley VS William Regal: Stupid match. Spike had a broken ankle, Regal had the match won but was too cocky and Spike rolled up Regal for the quick win.

Steve Austin VS Big Show: I remember when Show first came to thw WWF and they had a main event of Show-Austin. This one of the main reasons why I got this dvd. Ilike Austin's lou thez press off the second rope onto Show. Overall, best match on the card. The outside interference didn't take away from this match at all.

Triple H VS Undertaker: A rather short main event. It came off as a good, well paced match. I thought the ending was quick and just seemed like they wanted to get the match over with.

This card is worth it for the last two matches, even though the end of the main event lacked something.",1210636800,,1954,4.256756756756757

7963190,4,B000067JJG,"WWE Intercontinental Championship Match:

Rob Van Dam (c) vs. Eddie Guerrero

This match in my opinion was a very exciting match-up that was cut too short in length. The match still delivered a fast pace with some spectacular high flying manoeuvres although with a disappointing finish of RVD winning by dq. 7.5/10

Women's Tag Team Match

Jazz & Molly Holly vs. Trish Stratus & Jacqueline

Actually this match was actually quite entertaining where in general women matches are quite poor. This match in my opinion wasn't very special although it still was a watchable women's match-up. 6/10

Bradshaw vs. X-Pac

An alright match with a couple of highlights although all in all not too exciting. X-pac does get Powerbombed of the top rope and Bradshaw gets all bloody although the wrong person won this battle, X-pac in my opinion. 5.5/10

WWE Hardcore Championship:

Steven Richards (c) vs. Booker T

This match in my opinion was almost match of the night it was spectacular high flying hardcore match that you see between guys like Jeff Hardy & RVD. This match was still pretty brutal with a unique variety of weapons used such as trash cans, broomstick, sterling silver and tables. The match had multiple title changes which made the match more interesting. 8/10

Hardy Boyz vs. Shawn Stasiak & Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman

I did not see the point of this match Brock's match against Jeff Hardy at Backlash made him the huge heel character. It was short and above all else very boring with little of an arsenal of moves used. 5/10

WWE European Title

Spike Dudley (c) vs William Regal

Very disappointing four mins into the match and poor Spike has broken his ankle supposedly and then Regal beats him up. Then suddenly Spike rolls up Regal and wins. This wasn't a match. 3/10

Stone Cold vs. Big Show w/Ric Flair as guest Referee

This was the match that the crowd had been waiting for and it certainly delivered what it needed to do. Show dominates the first half of the match and then Stone cold with a cool Lou thez press from the top rope gaining him the advantage. Also tons of stunners in this match-up to Show, Nash and yes Ric Flair, an awesome match. 9/10

Triple H. vs. Undertaker

I was very surprised with this match it might've not been for the world title although throughout the match it seemed like a world title match.  This match displayed plenty of nice moves by HHH & Taker a lot of reversals throughout the match engaging the audience to decide who the hell is going to win. The ropes also break during the match forcing the two to use each other as leverage. Fantastic match 9.5/10

Overall mark 53.5/80 making Insurrextion a B in which I believe that Insurrextion is the worth the money although do not be expecting a ppv with the calibre of Wrestlemania or Summerslam. Insurrextion was a good upgrade of the regular matches that you would see on Raw with 2 very superior matches. Thankyou for reading my review on WWE Insurrextion 2002.",1124409600,8,2964,4.672447013487476
