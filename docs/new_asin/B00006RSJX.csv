1790710,5,B00006RSJX,"Though it cannot be listed amongst Kitano's best work, Getting Any is still a lot of fun to watch. It really shows the other side of Takeshi Kitano, and what he used to do when he was doing stand-up comedy. This film cannot [or shouldn't] really be compared to Kitano's other work, since it's theme is so radically different. Getting Any belongs to a different category, and it should be treated accordingly. As a comedy it stands alone among Kitano's other films, yet elements of his comic style can be found in all of those other films as well. Many people compare this movie to Monty Python films, and I think they are quite right; and just like the Monty Python films Getting Any requires multiple viewings to get all the subtle jokes. That also means that one can watch this movie several times and not get tired of its humor. The yakuza sequences are especially priceless [you can watch them over and over again]. This film will certainly entertain both the hardcore Kitano fans and the casual viewers as well.",1053043200,7,1016,4.6187845303867405
1790711,5,B00006RSJX,"What a hilarious movie, made in the Monty Pythonesque style. Some may find it strange, no doubt because they lack even a minimal knowledge about Japanese pop culture, which this film is ridiculing. As the film progresses each sequence gets more and more hilarious, and stranger, yet this allows the film to retain its forward momentum throughout its 108 minutes running time. Not only that but this film makes a great show when you have your friends over. It is almost always guaranteed to provide a great conversation afterwords.
If you call yourself a Kitano fan you wouldn't want to miss this unique comedy gem, and if you're a fan of asian cinema, give this film a try, you won't be dissappointed. Very highly recommended.",1042848000,4,726,4.816
1790712,3,B00006RSJX,"Asao, a middle aged man, wants to have sex and comes to the conclusion that he needs a car in order to get laid.  He buys a car but his plan is futile, which causes him to think that he needs a cabriolet in order to achieve his goal.  This plan fails, which moves him to think that people who flie first class get to have what he so badly wants.  However, he has run out of money and is in debt.  This leads him to conspire to rob a bank and from this point on his troubles increase and it seems like he has lost focus on his goal.  Getting Any? is an comical film that provides numerous laughs through a large number of short scenes put together into a longer film, but it becomes tedious as the film goes on.",1042329600,,710,3.971830985915493
1790713,5,B00006RSJX,"I'd have to say this film is quite different from the usual Kitano fare. Than again it's a comedy, and a pretty wacky one too. Yet I found Getting Any? just as entertaining as all the other more known Kitano films, albeit on a whole different level. As an all out comedy it really does a good job of entertaining, even after repeated viewings, though Kitano tends to go overboard with some of the scenes. I know that some of these scenes were edited out of the so called international cut, though this dvd happens to be the director's cut, which is a good thing because the Yakuza scenes where heavily edited from the international cut, and they are one of the funniest scenes I've ever scene. As a matter of fact the Yakuza sequences [a good part of the film] and the studio scenes alone well worth it for any Kitano fan, or comedy fan to buy this disc.
I watched this film with my friends, and they didn't get all the jokes at the first time [probably because you have to read the subtitles too, so some of your attention is reserved for that], but then we watched it again a couple of days later, and we were pointing out all the subtle jokes and ""hidden characters"" [hint: these are the people who died in the previous scenes, but they keep coming up in the subsequent sequences, it's a bit like watching the Simpsons or Futurama, you really have to pay attantion to catch these little private jokes]. I must say watching this film with others is twice the fun, and it's addictive too [like most cult classics].
I'd have to say Kitano does a great job yet again mixing comedy elements with violence, though there's much less violence and blood in this film [ it's a comedy after all]. People should approach this film from a different angle though, don't expect another gangster flick [not a serious one at any rate].
I warmly recommend this flick for any comedy fan, besides there aren't that many films out there that make fun of the whole Japanese society, mannerism and pop culture all wrapped up in a two hour film. Good job Kitano.",1039478400,5,2041,4.459893048128342
1790714,4,B00006RSJX,"I have to say I find this Kitano film very weird and very funny at the same time. The situations in which the main character gets involved in throughout the whole film get more weird each time, yet the movie remains entertaining. Despite its weirdness I kept watching it because it's also so addictive [I ended up watching some of the funniest scenes over and over again]. Viewers who don't get all the jokes at the first time around should watch the film again 'cause it is fully of subtle jokes that you would miss the first or even second time around. Overall it's a very funny film.",1038355200,3,586,4.435185185185185
1790715,5,B00006RSJX,"I've been waiting for this Kitano film to be released in region 1 for a long time. Finally it has happaned. I must say this movie is a lot different from his other, more violence oriented films, but it's a comedy so it should be. The film holds up very well, even after watching it a few times. There are so many subtle jokes that only reveal themselves after repeated viewings. It is very important for me that any film that I purchase on dvd will remain watchable even after a few viewings, and Getting Any? certainly meets that standard.
DVD content: besides the film, which has a very prestine anamorphic transfer, there is an alternate ending, a very extensive director's bio, and the usual stuff  [trailer, production notes, filmography, etc.].
If you like comedies, done in the same spirit as the funnier Peter Seller movies, like the Pink Panther series and the Party, you should definitely get this one, it won't disappoint. For Kitano fans this dvd is a must purchase, because it really shows his funny side. Highly recommended, and thank you 21st Century DreamQuest Films for releasing this funny film on dvd.",1037750400,2,1120,4.743589743589744
1790716,5,B00006RSJX,"After enjoying some of Kitano's other works [Brother, Violent Cop, Fireworks] I decided to pick up his one and only comedy, Getting Any?. Wow, my first reaction was ""this cannot be by the same director, it's just so different from his other works."" Then I watched it again, and I must say this film gets better and better with each subsequent viewing, as I missed a lot of the more subtle jokes during the first viewing. This film makes fun of Japanese pop culture, behaviour, and pretty much everything else that is sacred to the Japanese. It's done in a similar style as the Pink Pather series with Peter Sellers.
The yakuza scenes are my all time favorites, I can watch these any time and laugh at the wacky characters and their silly situations, and not get tired of it. Any one still wondering whether they should get this film, especially if they enjoyed Kitano's more violent movies, should wonder no more. This film is a must have for any Kitano fan, and it provides great entertainment, especially when you're watching it with your friends. Highly recommended.",1037577600,2,1069,4.721925133689839
1790717,5,B00006RSJX,"I'm a big fan of Takeshi Kitano films, and I'm glad I picked up this rare comedy gem. Getting Any? is definitely different from his other films, but that does not mean it is not entertaining. On the contrary, Getting Any? holds up very well even after repeated viewings, and more importantly the jokes are just as funny as they were the first time around. It is quite refreshing to watch Kitano and his wacky characters in this all out comedy, that makes fun of just about everything holy to the Japanese culture. I sincerely recommend this film to anyone who likes comedies. It's a must for Kitano fans.",1037577600,2,604,4.5504587155963305
7972856,3,B00006RSJX,"Takeshi Kitano's goofiest movie by far is about Asao (Duncan), a lonely man who goes on a series of misadventures while pursuing his fantasy of having vehicular sex. Similar to Jerry Lewis's character in Cracking Up, Asao's predicament gets more troublesome and outlandish as the movie progresses. Not to mention - and not to spoil things too much - his adventure sort of acts as a survey of popular Japanese cinema. While I give credit to Kitano for making Asao's journey so seamless and varied, it will also test your limits for silliness and nonsense. I, for one, rolled my eyes a lot more than I laughed.",1491177600,,608,4.691588785046729
7972857,4,B00006RSJX,Hilarious at times. Amusing at others. One of the better 30 or so Japanese flicks we've watched in recent months.,1457049600,,113,4.7
7972858,5,B00006RSJX,Anything directed by or with Takeshi Kitano in it will be good.  Really funny movie which I have watched more than once.,1434758400,,120,4.454545454545454
7972859,2,B00006RSJX,"I don't know how this DVD is encoded but non of my players managed to give a proper picture and this includes top of the line Oppo BDP83 coupled with an EDGE scaler or a PS3... In all cases the picture is still heavily combed.

Appart from that is still the wacky and funny movie I remembered and I enjoyed watching it again.",1267833600,,325,4.158730158730159
7972860,4,B00006RSJX,"I love Takeshi Kitano's dramas which exemplify the best of what I enjoy about Japanese cinema. I had experienced some of his style of comedy with his redux on Zatoichi but nothing could have compared me for his in/famous comedy Getting Any?, a film that when it flopped drove him into depression that was part of the cause of his accident that paralyzed half of his face. Part of the reason I wanted to watch this was Kitano's recent comedies Takeshis' and the unreleased Hooray Director that gets released in June.

So enough of that jib-jab, hows the movie? It definitely is what could be termed insane with a tone that matches something like Kentucky Fried Movie throwing one idea for jokes into the next with reckless abandon. Describing the plot is almost impossible in my opinion. The basic idea is that thirty-five year old Asao decides to get a car he can have sex in. Whent the several ideas at procuring the car go awry, he then plans to get money to get a first class ticket on a plane because of course the flight attendants have sex with the first class passengers. Where it goes from there is a bizzare off kilter experience that can only be described as a surreal journey of the odd-ball.

Comedies are hard to rate since like horror films they only work for certain members of the audience. Some will like this film while others will absolutely hate it. Me I can definitely attest that I laughed quiet a bit at the film. Despite the overload of the jokes there were some that were indeed humorous to my sensibility. But while there were jokes I laughed at I do admit that a lot of the jokes probably work better for Japanese audiences, and some of those jokes at times are taken to such extremes that they overstay their welcome so to speak. For the most part as well while I liked a lot of the humor the last half of them didn't really work as well as the first despite the presence of Kitano himself playing an oddball scientist.

I guess all I can say to end it is probably the perfect way to end all positive reviews of caution, see it at your own risk.",1171843200,,2073,4.407310704960835
7972861,5,B00006RSJX,"One of the stupidest, most bizarre, and straight up perverted movies I've seen in a long time, but it was friggin' funny as hell. If you can handle 'stupid funny' then this movie is definitely enjoyable. Loosely organized around the fact that this perverted guy wants to score badly.... so he goes off and tries many different means to accomplish this task. The end degenerates into a big of a Godzilla parody, but still funny. Be sure to stick around for the end of the credits too.",1122854400,5,483,4.563218390804598
7972862,1,B00006RSJX,"I am a fan of ""Beat"" Kitano Takeshi.  I laughed during parts of this movie.  Yet I haven't felt more of a let-down watching a movie than when I saw ""Getting Any?"" (Mina yatteru ka?).  This was Takeshi's first film from his production company Office Kitano and like one reviewer suggested, it has a kind of amateurish quality.  This is not the same director who gave us ""Fireworks"" or ""Zatoichi (remake)"".

The film is funny for the first 15-25 minutes:  as sketch comedy, it is very funny but then swings out of control into longer bits where the protagonist (one of Takeshi's disciples Dankan) becomes involved in film (as a replacement for, of all things, Katsu Shintaro (aka Zatoichi)) and then poses as a Yakuza hitman and finally the movie copies Cronenberg/Goldblum's ""The Fly"" (with some Mothra pastiche thrown in).  The movie is a mess.

My wife, who is Japanese, likes Takeshi, but said the film creeped her out:  women are excessively portrayed as sexual objects.  True:  this is coming the mind of a moronic protagonist whose ultimate goal in life is ""Car Sex"" -- sort of like giving Dustin Hoffman's Raymond character in ""Rain Man"" a hard time for holding up ""People's Court"" as the best the American Justice system has to offer...

The pacing of the film is so bad that I'm giving it 1 star.  Perhaps only die-hard fans of Takeshi's HUMOR (not his dramas) would appreciate this film.  Thankfully, the director greatly improved in his follow-up films.",1122163200,4,1463,4.776892430278885
7972863,2,B00006RSJX,"I really wanted to like this film, because it is silly, and weird, and has cute topless girls in it. But I found that it was very amateurishly executed. It may have been on purpose, because apparently film maker is quite famous, and he says he is making fun of himself as a film maker. But it just did not work for me, sorry.",1099094400,5,325,4.09375
7972864,5,B00006RSJX,"Kitano's approach to comedy is quite twisted, yet it works well for most parts of this movie. Although, certain scenes could've been shorter. However, there are so many little subtle jokes planted all over the film, and I'm not talking about jokes that only the Japanese audience would understand or appreciate.
It seems to me that Kitano was greatly influenced by the Monty Python series as this movie definitely resembles the structure of that show, but that's not a bad thing. So if you want to see Kitano's comic interpretation on Japanese pop culture and society don't miss this weird comedy.",1064361600,3,597,4.920792079207921
7972865,5,B00006RSJX,"Most of the reviewers have already praised this rare Kitano comedy, so I don't really see a reason repeating them. I just want to say that this is a really funny movie, well worth the money I paid for it, and yes, it definitely stands well after repeated viewings. I bought my DVD through Amazon Marketplace, directly through the manufacturer. What a deal! Thank you DreamQuest Films for releasing this rare film on R1 DVD.
Kitano fans should really support these small studios that dare to release less known titles from our favourite director. Now what about releasing DOLLS on DVD? I hope that film will be available on Amazon soon.",1055030400,4,635,4.72972972972973
