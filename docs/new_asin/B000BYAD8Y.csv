If it was alittle longer time wise it would definitely be a five star. It's worth the price just to see them perform ""Help Me"" and ""Goin' Home"". If you are a Alvin Lee/Ten Years After fan then I would recommend you add this DVD to your collection.",1228176000,2,383,4.1891891891891895
8193422,5,B000BYAD8Y,"This is a concert from 1983. It includes, ""Love Like a Man,"" ""I May Be Wrong But I Won't Be Wrong Always(a song rarely played live except on Undead),"" ""Good Morning Little School,"" ""Help Me,"" ""Woodchoppers Ball(almost never ever played live except on Undead)"", ""Slow Blues,"" & ""I'm Goin' Home.""

This DVD, released in 2002, and apparently in Argentina, is well made. The sound is excellent and the picture is not at all bad for 25 years ago(It is not Blu-Ray). There are 4 separate cameras used to capture all the action. I am amazed that they actually do ""Woodchoppers Ball."" It is astounding to watch.

Back in the late 1960's and early 1970's there were 2 groups that had to be seen live. One was the Who. The other was TYA. There was no other guitarist out there in the mainstream that could rip out the fast licks like Alvin Lee. Now it has become all too commonplace. Watch ""Woodstock,"" the movie, if you want to see who the star of that show is. It is Alvin Lee & the watermelon. Bet on it.

The songs here are tremendous. While this show is slightly updated from the Woodstock era material(as in Alvin does a stellar job playing harmonica, even using it as a slide, on ""Help Me"", and he even does a one note, one finger shot of Eddie Van Halen, where he used to do a rapid fire blast of killer notes, also in ""Help Me""), it is very much indicative of what you would get at one of the original smokin' TYA shows.

Alvin Lee is as always in top form. Leo Lyons is non stop energy on the bass. Ric Lee and Chick Churchill are equally top notch. There is a short extra section, which features TYA in their heyday doing ""Schoolgirl"" for a bit. This is exhilarating to say the least. This is one of VERY FEW live shows available for Ten Years After on DVD. If you've never seen them live, this is the recording to fill the void.",1219104000,4,1830,4.2956521739130435
8193423,5,B000BYAD8Y,Pretty good stuff.  Alvin Lee is a great player.  Ten Years After was a great band.  I wish there was more live video of these guys.,1201219200,,132,4.0
8193424,4,B000BYAD8Y,I played this for my 16 year old daughter who is taking guitar lessons and her jaw dropped to the ground. I had forgotten what a great guitarist Alvin Lee is and what a together band Ten Years After was. If they are still around they should get back together and do a tour. This DVD really shows the talent of Lee and the entire band. I gave it only 4 stars because of its short length. There is a lot of hits not on it but the ones that are are just awsome. If you are a lover of guitar rock this is a must dvd to have in your collection.,1166313600,7,539,3.8214285714285716
