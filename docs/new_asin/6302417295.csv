7825566,4,6302417295,"Anyone who wants to understand climate change/global warming movement today, might want to view this documentary prepared for the UNEP, back in the early 70's. This documentary features actors like J.D. Rockefeller III, Margaret Meade, Hugh Downs, Raymond Burr and Barbera Ward. Internationalism, a value system based completely in the 'real,' an appeal to 'Gaia.' Anyone whose seen Captain Planet as a kid, might also appreciate the way this documentary is delivered.

I don't value the message as much as I believe this documentary to be essential to anyone who wishes to understand today, as it was scripted in the past.",1357084800,,623,5.1683168316831685
