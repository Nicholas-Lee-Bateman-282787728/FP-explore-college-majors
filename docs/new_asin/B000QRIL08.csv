2839796,3,B000QRIL08,This view is very short - about 12-15 minutes.  It opens with Barbara Walters.  The only notes I took while viewing this video included the symptoms of schizophrenia include paranoia and delusions.  I recommend the movie Beautiful Mind.,1353369600,2,236,5.157894736842105
2839797,5,B000QRIL08,I am very happy with this DVD. It is informative and an appropriate teaching tool.,1280275200,,82,4.533333333333333

2839800,5,B000QRIL08,"I have used used this brief yet remarkable video in two types of university courses:  (1) courses on clinical psychology, and (2) courses on perception, cognition, and cognitive neuroscience.  Sure, it is a bit old (2000), but it remains an extremely good resource.  It captures so much in such a short period that it is simply too good to ignore, in my opinion.

1) SCHIZOPHRENIA PRIMER.  The video provides an excellent brief introduction to the basic features of schizophrenia.  One  strength of the video is that it shows likeable, articulate people who have the disease.  It is possible to see the basic features of schizophrenia, while also seeing the people who exhibit - but are not defined by  -- their diagnosis.  Another strength of the video is that it describes schizophrenic breaks, i.e., the symptoms that appear during the first onset the disorder.  There are many videos on schizophrenia that do not provide this type of description.

2) AUDITORY AND VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS - VIRTUAL REALITY SIMULATION.  Another strength is that the video provides excellent coverage of the auditory and visual hallucinations experienced with schizophrenia.  This is accomplished using a virtual reality simulation (thanks to Janssen Pharmaceutical's ""Walk In Their Footsteps"" simulation).  In the video, we see patient Ken Steele verify that the simulations seem quite realistic to him.  One value of such simulations is that they make it possible for health professionals and family members to empathize more effectively with schizophrenics.  This is an area that remains of interest today (2009).  A group at Hebrew university is using somewhat similar virtual reality environments to develop new ways to diagnose schizophrenia.  Because schizophrenics are poor at multi-modal integration, they are less able than the rest of us to pick out images and sounds that do not make sense in the context of the simulation (e.g., seeing a person play guitar but hearing a saxophone).

3) PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION.  The video briefly presents drugs that have been effective for some people (e.g., Risperdal for Mr. Steele). At the same time, the drawbacks are discussed briefly by patients and the narrator.

4) TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (TMS) OF THE BRAIN. The video features the potentially ground-breaking work of Ralph Hoffman and his lab (Yale).  It describes how TMS, a fairly new approach to stimulating the human brain, has been used to test hypotheses and treat schizophrenia (in preliminary experiments). The neuroanatomical basis of auditory hallucinations is thought to involve increasing blood flow of the speech perception areas of the brain, such as the superior temporal cortex of the dominant (usually left) hemisphere as well as right and left superior temporal cortex.  Brain imaging studies (not discussed in the video) of patients with auditory hallucinations have revealed active areas in the right and left superior temporal cortex, Broca's area, and the left temporoparietal cortex. Magnetic Stimulation of Left Temporoparietal Cortex suggest that the mechanism of auditory hallucinations involves activation of the left temporoparietal cortex.  Amazingly, TMS suppresses auditory hallucinations in some individuals, as shown in the video.  In 2009, research and theorizing has advanced to the point that additional brain areas in the left and right hemisphere has been found to be involved in schizophrenia, and so the effects of TMS on these areas is being investigated.  Additionally, new types of TMS have been developed (e.g., at the Waisman Institute) that can stimulate deep areas of the brain.  So this is an excellent intro to something that has strong promise.

I should add that this video is currently available online (legally) for free.  I hope it remains available!",1251676800,29,3805,5.378378378378378
2839801,5,B000QRIL08,"I teach nursing students at a college and chose this film for my mental health class.  Although it's only about 15-20 minutes long, it does more to explain what it's like for a person with schizophrenia than anything I can tell them or anything they can read.  You actually get inside the head of a person with schizophrenia; wow!  The students are stunned and really gain an appreciation for the patients fighting this disease on a daily basis.  I highly recommend this documentary.",1251331200,12,483,4.783132530120482
2839802,4,B000QRIL08,"My son has mental illness and the National Alliance of Mental Illness
recommended this 16 minute segment from a 20/20 television show  as a good way to try and understand how the mind of a mentally ill person perceives things.
A group of scientists at Yale University developed a visual reality device that one puts on their head to see and hear as if you have schizophrenia. It is an intense video showing a very extreme case of delusional processing.  There are schizophrenic persons explaining their form of this illness.
This CD is informative and worth viewing.  It, in itself, is not enough of an education if one is seeking answers about this terrible disease.  It does, however, add a greater clarity to what it does to a person.",1215302400,31,737,4.689922480620155
8197097,1,B000QRIL08,"Greatly disappointed in a video that cost $25 and ran for 11 minutes  Basically it just reviewed technology where a ""normal"" person can see and hear what a person with schizophrenia sees and hears  if 10 minutes of the video actually let you feel what it's like to have those symptoms I would have been satisfied but the amount of time where you could see and hear what it's like to suffer from this disease was approximately one minute out of the 11 minute video  if 10 minutes of the video actually let you feel what it's like to have those symptoms I would have been satisfied but the amount of time where you could see and hear what it's like to suffer from this disease was approximately one minute out of the 11 minute video  It left me and my students very disappointed",1475020800,,776,4.368055555555555

8197099,5,B000QRIL08,This is a good simple overview of Schizophrenia with a new experimental intervention. I find this to be a good beginning for an undergraduate Psychology class. It holds the students' interest and helps them get a sense of what it is like for the schizophrenic.,1390953600,,260,4.8
8197100,3,B000QRIL08,This was a pretty short video and I didn't really learn much from it.  I guess I was just expecting more.,1376611200,,105,4.0
8197101,4,B000QRIL08,Well done and informative. I use it to educate family members. Children with a parent suffering schizophrenia found it very helpful. Goes a long way to end the stigma they experience.,1375747200,,183,4.935483870967742
8197102,2,B000QRIL08,"I purchased this video in hopes that it might provide some insight into this illness as I have two adult daughters that suffer from Schizophrenia. I sat with my husband and my 29 year old daughter to watch this video and then asked my daughter what her thoughts were about what she just saw. My daughter said that although she has suffered from many hallucinations and has heard voices  for years now, she did not learn anything new or informitive from this video. She also stated that if her doctor grew a third eye she would stop seeing him. This video may be helpful to someone who has no experience with mental illness to give them an idea of how scary hallucations and voices can be to someone who is experiencing them, and hopefully give them some since of compassion for those who deal with this illness daily.",1369180800,,817,4.52027027027027
8197103,5,B000QRIL08,The video was an excellent explanation of the disease Schizophrenia.  I use it while teaching and it has always provided a better understanding of the disease for my students.,1367107200,,175,5.0344827586206895

8197105,4,B000QRIL08,Helpful for describing hallucinations and delusions. Good educational film for starting discussion with people suffering fromdepression and needing ECT or medication.,1360972800,,166,6.9523809523809526
8197106,3,B000QRIL08,"I chose this video to support a teaching module in cognitive psychology and mental illness.  I did not use it.  I can't put my finger on what is missing, but I did not find that it enhanced the lesson at all so I left it out.  I thought for the price it would be longer and go more what schizophrenia is (which it does to a limited extent) but it was a lesson learned to do my homework before a purchase.",1356566400,5,404,3.962962962962963
