8467654,5,B005DVIPNK,"Fantastic resource.  I own many DVDs in this series.  During a typical library time, I will share folklore from the country, show a 15 minute segment from one of the DVDs followed my a short activity.  For the Russian DVD, for example,  my students drew pictures of onion domes. Students benefit from viewing how children in other countries live as well as increasing their global knowledge.",1490400000,2,391,4.878787878787879
8467655,3,B005DVIPNK,"This is a great for a show. Every episode highlights a country & shows a day in the life of a kid in the city & one in the country. My kids love seeing how different their lives are. I would give it 5 stars, but some episodes have so much background noise that you can't hear what the kids are saying.",1489104000,2,301,3.870967741935484

8467659,5,B005DVIPNK,My family absolutely loves watching these. The only negative feedback I have is several of the videos the back ground noises drown out the young speakers and you can't make it what they are saying.,1484784000,,197,4.6571428571428575
8467660,4,B005DVIPNK,"Getting a glimpse into the life of an average German child is a wonderful treat. Shows the life of two German families and what a typical day is like for them through the eyes of children. It is fun to see how life is both similar and different from our own,  in Germany. The children in this film are good role models. Sophia is seven years old and does chores at the nearby farm. She also works hard practicing her guitar and supports her older sister by attending her choir performance. Ole is ten years old and is a hard worker. He helps to set the dinner table, washes dishes after dinner and does chores around the house. The background noise at the farm is a real treat and makes you feel as if you are really there. The locations are beautiful, they show the castles, the city where the Grimm brothers lived and the city of Berlin. Bound to broaden any viewers global perspective and understanding, full of real life current day cultural experiences and information about Germany's rich history. A great way to expose children to the culture of German families and show that they are not so different from those in the U.S.

""I love learning  about Germany and following the kids through a day in their lives."" ""I like the castles."" ""Very interesting. I got a lot of information."" ""It is cool. I really like the handball part, because they don't play it here in America. I would like to play it."" ""I like that they tell about daily lives and not just special things."" ""I like that you can hear them speak in German, but the narration is  in English."" ""This movie makes me think about what it would be like to live in Germany.""",1332115200,,1634,4.4366666666666665
