1392250,3,B000053V4L,"My 3 year old begs to watch a ""movie"" every day, so when I give in, I try to choose something instructional. He knows his letters and their sounds, and is starting to put words together, so this was at the right level for him.

The good: The video is almost non-stop phonics lessons without much filler. This means that in two 30-40 minute sessions, they cover vowels, consonants, special consonants with more than one sound, vowel blends, digraphs, silent e, consonant blends, digraphs, and common phonics ""rule-breakers"". It is actually an astounding amount of material.

My child has seen limited videos that weren't educational, so his entertainment standards aren't high, but the video keeps his attention enough that he asks for it and wants to play one particular segment over and over because it has a scene transition that mimics breaking glass, and the narrator says, ""Oops!"" which is highly comic, in his opinion. Granted, he watches the video while jumping off and on the couch, and literally sometimes standing on his head, but after a week, he startled his father by singing, ""A-E-I-O-U and sometimes Y, sometimes Y."" Obviously something is trickling in.

He can also apply some of it to sounding out words already. He knew tonight that ""ur/ir/or/er"" could make the same sound, and we used it to sound out ""tractor,"" ""bird,"" and ""flower."" This is after only 1 week, mind you, and this lesson comes late in the video, far past the ""oops"" lesson that he has watched repeatedly.

The Leapfrog Letter Factory IS very helpful and educational, but it had him firmly convinced that vowels only made short sounds, and there was no mention of any letter making more than one sound (I know they get there in Code Word Caper, but he was very mistrustful of that video as heretical). He wouldn't believe me that letters could make different sounds, but he'll believe a video over a parent any day.

The bad: Visually, this production is a graphic design nightmare. The words are set against a primary kaleidoscope, and there are these computer-generated characters with abnormally wide-opened eyes that make them look hyperthyroid on No-Doz. The storybook characters on another video by Rock-n-Learn have those same weird eyes, and my son won't even let me get the video out of the package. (They're scary, Mommy.) Fortunately, the comp-gen people aren't on-screen most of the time, although their annoying little voices are heard ""off-stage"" frequently. Of course, their little jokes are meant to appeal to the preschool crowd, and I think they succeed there.

The actors remind me of a line in an Edith Wharton story, Roman Fever, ""that rare accident, an extremely pretty girl who somehow made youth and prettiness seem as safe as their absence."" They're not quite as adept at lip syncing and mimicking guitar playing as one would like, and the dancing reminds me of my first middle school dance, but I'm sure it's better than hiring Janet Jackson as the song/dance consultant.

Most of the video focuses on the words (as they should) and an inset of the actor's mouth, which is useful for pronunciation, but unfortunately, the color balance is off (compared to the full frame people scenes, which look fine), so that the skin looks sallow and the teeth yellow. It's just a little weird when the mouth dominates the screen.

All of this is to say, it's rather a painful video to watch with your child if you're visually sensitive. If your kids are used to watching more sophisticated entertainment, they may very well not find it meets their standards. There is no engaging story line, no endearing characters, no songs worthy of immortalization in Hal Leonard sheet music.

The bottom line is that it was made to educate, not to win an Academy Award, and it does work, at least with my relatively entertainment-naive preschooler.",1237334400,23,3834,4.886153846153846
1392251,5,B000053V4L,"I cannot rave more about this DVD!!!!  I think they did the best they could with incorporating music with phonics.  I swear, my 6 year old who is in first grade had a dramatic improvement in reading and spelling after watching this video.  At the beginning of the school year, she was averaging 3 out of 8 on her spelling and on her first report card, the teacher said she needed more assistance with reading.  I turned on this video a couple of times during the week  for a few weeks for her to watch and each time I started it at a different chapter.  There has been a dramatic improvement in her reading and spelling.  Now she has gotten an 8/8 on her spelling. She started coming home with stickers each day from school that she said she got for doing a good job in reading.  She said that this phonics video taught her how to read!!!  Just a few weeks ago, we were barely getting through Dora phonics series and now she is reading books to me that she got from the library which are at a second grade level.  Awesome video!!!!
I think all Kindergarten and First grade teachers should use this video to supplement there teaching.  Students relate to this much better than a teacher standing up trying to teach it.",1233792000,7,1217,4.364444444444445

1392257,5,B000053V4L,"When I first put in this video for my 4 year old, it seemed definitely too hard.  He had enjoyed immensely the LeapFrog letter and word factory videos (a great start) and I was afraid the quick pace and multi-letter phonic sounds on this tape would bore him because he couldn't follow it. Wrong!  After a couple of weeks and a basic grasp on phonics my son was pulled in by the songs and the bright colors and graphics and was reading and spelling simple words!  We were able to simply pick out a word in any book and he would begin to sound out the letters, including how 'ing' sounds.  He also knows the difference between vowels and consonants, and can sing ""a,e,i,o,u"" and ""sometimes y, sometimes Y"".  He has a little chant that helps him remember his vowels and now I use it when I'm going over reading words with him.  He's learned all of this in a matter of weeks!  4 weeks ago he recognized his letters and could name them, now he's reading and spelling small words.  A terrific video...stick with it and your child will be singing the songs and knowing phonics in no time!  It's also helpful (my child loves it) to have a box of those wooden or magnetic letters at his disposal and he spells words on the rug.  You have to get several sets, though, so they can make words (you need more than one 's', for example).",1088726400,8,1323,4.319838056680162

1392259,5,B000053V4L,"Rock N Learn Phonics and the other titles by Rock N Learn are very good tools to help your child learn to read.  My son started watching the RocknLearn Alphabet tape before he was a year old.  He actually knew the alphabet and was writing them when he was 2 years old.  Now, at the age of 3 he is reading.  I give 80% of the credit to these videos by Rock N Learn.  He loves them and will watch them all day if I allow him to.  When he was 2 years old he would watch one tape 5 or more times in a row.
This Phonics tape is excellent.  It teaches children how to read by sounding out each letter or combinations of letters.  If you know a child that you would like to help learn to read, give them these tapes by RocknLearn.",1021766400,47,723,3.904109589041096

1392386,4,B000053V4L,"I am editing my review below because my kids were willing to watch it over and over. I didn't think it was all that at first, but they are singing along to the songs and laughing over some of the segments. They find it entertaining and have caught some valuable info from it. I hear them singing ""a e i o u...and sometimes y"" His class hasn't even discussed vowels yet, so he's ahead thanks to the video. Maybe I should even give it 5 stars since it has done what I wanted it to do-teach them in a way that will seem like entertainment to them. Even I find myself singing these silly songs. Ha!
I will leave my previous review after watching the video once, but it has grown on us.
Most of my reviews are 1 star or 5 stars, so I am surprised to find something so-so. Even though it's a hard subject to make really exciting, I still say it could be a lot better. It held my five year old's attention okay, however I've never seen him walk away from any TV show. My 3 year old did walk away. It looks out-dated. Not sure how old this video is, but it doesn't seem close to the new style of programs. I was also suprised how fast they went with everything. They tell you the sound of the letters and then go right into reading them. They say to try to read the word before they say it, but there's only a 2 second moment of silence before they say ""cat"". I think most fresh readers need time to think and sound it out/put it together. I think they should sound it out for the viewers ""c"" ""a"" ""t"" and then say ""cat, but unfortunately they don't sound it out. That surprised me because it is such an important step for reading/phonics. Next they go into the sentences and they read it rather fast for a beggining reader in my opinion.",1357603200,2,1729,4.1335311572700295

1392391,5,B000053V4L,"My two year old daughter gets frustrated and resists every time I sit her down to read. However she absolutely loves watching television so I teach her by using educational DVDs.

The Rock N' Learn Phonics & Reading video is an excellent production. Watching adults mouthing out sounds is really helpful to her. The songs are catchy, the stories with captions are great to read along with, and I like the mini-tests to review lessons. It covers a broad spectrum: consonant sounds, vowels, and combining everything to make words.

Right now the Rock 'N Learn DVD is perfect to introduce her to phonics. Some of the concepts are too advanced for her but I like exposing her to challenging material. I am going to play the leapfrog DVD series when she gets a little older and her reading skills improve. I also like to supplement her videos with reading material. I bought a few workbooks on sale at a teacher supply store to help supplement her video learning.

Rock N' Learn Phonics & Reading is really an amazing addition to her video library. She really loves watching it, and I can tell she is taking a lot out of the program. And at this price you really can't go wrong.

1392407,5,B000053V4L,"The DVD is a two volume set on a single DVD, it plays for approximately 92 minutes, and it is rated for ages 6 years to adult.  Students learn phonics skills and phonemic awareness through cool music, very colorful action, and high interest games.

The visual affects grab students attention and keeps them focused throughout the lesson by using colorful graphics, comical animated characters, authentic characters, and playful songs.  I especially like the on-screen-mouth that demonstrates and enunciates how to make the sounds in each catagory.

Volume I contains the following:  Introduction, vowels, short vowel sounds, consonants with vowels, consonant-vowel-consonant game, special sounds of (c, g, qu, x), putting it all together, double consonants (words ending in ll, ss, ff), plural s and ending s, ending consonant blends, practice with ending blends, beginning consonant blends, three-consonant lends, consonant digraphs and trigraphs, silent e intro, silent e makes the long vowel sound, silent e practice, and a fun quiz.

Volume 2 contains the following:  Introduction, long a, long e, long i, long o, long u, r-controlled vowels (ar, er, ir, ur, or, ire, are, air), dipthongs (ai, oy, out, aw, au, aw, all, al), break it down (syllables), schwa sound, ending sounds, y and le endings, rule breakers, ph and gh, memory words, and silent consonants. The Rock and Learn series of DVDs are super tools for helping students learn about phonics.  The DVDs are a high interest method for reinforcing phonics, phonemic awareness, decoding skills, sight word recognition, and letter-sound recognition.

Repetition is the key to helping students grasp phonics skills and phonemic awareness.  The phonics lesson focuses on a specific skill while other skills are being introduced, and or reinforced.  Students watch the portion of the DVD for that particular skill, and in doing so their schema about that particular skill is boosted.

For example, students listen, watch, and engage in fun activities on the DVD related to beginning blends (bl).  Then, I present my students with a blends chart, on large chart paper, that focuses on words that begin with that particular blend (bl)--black, blend, block, bleak, blue, blood, Blake, blunt, etc.

I highlight the blend with a different color marker such as red, and the other letters are written in blue. My students and I use see-say, say-it-slow, and say-it fast to decode the words from the large chart paper.  I also use blends poetry to help my students practice what they have learned.

On early release days (Wednesdays), I divide students into groups of 3 or 4 and we choral read the blend poem together until students sound smooth and fluent.

Students then get an opportunity to practice the poem in their groups.  When everyone is prepared, each team takes their turn reading the poem as a fluency exercise.

The team with the least number of errors gets to choose three treats from the treasure box, second place selects two treats, and third place picks one treat.

I also us the precision teaching model to assess my students progress with that particular blend (bl).  When students have scored 80% or better we move on to a new blend, and or skill.",1353196800,,3218,5.091428571428572

I bought this video a little over a month ago, and he watches it in the car, when we take rides to run errands, etc.  He enjoys it, and he repeats things like ""Daddy, the vowels are A,E,I,O,U, and sometime Y"".  I thought it was very cute, but he has always had a good memory, so I never thought much of it.  However, 2 days ago we pulled out a set of word-to-picture matching puzzles, which we haven't used in quite some time, and unexpectedly, he started sounding out the letters in sequence and telling us what each word was.  We were shocked!  There were about 30 words in the set, and he got nearly 20 of them, before getting distracted and moving onto something new.  We went back the next day, and he did it again.  Through this video, he seems to understand the concept of reading.  I definitely think this video was key to getting him over that hurdle.  He had a good foundation, with already knowing the letter sounds, but this video helped him put it all together.

1392442,5,B000053V4L,"This movie is an incredible value. Most Rock N Learn movies cost at least double this price. The DVD case says that this movie is 104 minutes long and as far as I can tell it contains a lot of clips from those other pricier versions. The main reason I think that this is cheaper is that it is for HOME USE ONLY whereas most other Rock N Learn Videos give permission to show them in a classroom setting too.

I bought this movie for my 2 year old daughter who LOVES the Rock N Learn Series (she even enjoys titles like this that are made for kids older than her). We started with the Rock N Learn movie ""Colors, Shapes and Counting"" when she was about 1.5 and she has learned so much so fast! Though she is not ready to sit and watch this movie straight through (there are some concepts that are over her head) we put it on and let her watch the parts she likes. I am confident that a large majority of the chapters in this DVD will be watched a lot, if not now I am sure she will be interested in them as she progresses.

Contrary to what the cover makes it look like, there are NOT many live people in the movie. It is traditional Rock N Learn style (see their website for video clips of other movies). I would describe it as ""flash animation"" style. There are some sections that have a real mouth or real person (adult) in the corner showing you how to pronounce the word or sound (I love this feature). Some sections are songs, some are reading words along with a beat, some are quiz type games (cool for older kids, but we skip most of these for our 2 year old), some sections are read-along stories (brief animations or illustrations with follow along words at the bottom- they usually give you a chance to read it on your own and then they highlight the words as they read them). Each chapter/section is separate from the others and only last a few minutes at the most. So you could just focus on a few clips at a time to introduce and/or solidify a particular concept.

I am not sure if all of the chapters are clips from other movies, but I know that there are at least a handful of clips that are also on some of the other Rock N Learn movies we own (for instance there are some duplicate clips on the ""Letter Sounds"" movie, and though I don't own the ""Phonics"" movies I would guess that they also contain duplicates of some of these clips). Anyway, I've listed the chapter titles in this DVD below so that you can compare with other Rock N Learn videos that you might own.

Vowels
Common Sounds of Each Letter
Name That Letter
C-V-C Words (consonant-vowel-consonant)
Special Sounds of C G Q X

I was surprised he packaging was not a traditional DVD case (it looks like it on the outside, but inside it holds the DVD in a removable envelope rather than a traditional DVD clasp). It doesn't really matter to me, but it is worth noting.

I think this movie is an awesome addition to any home with children who are learning to read. It is very thorough. Plus, adding music definitely makes reading and learning more fun.  I think this movie would work well with either a phonics based reading method or a sight words reading method (as there are a lot of words they read and show at the same time). Just pick the clips that support the method you prefer. Have fun!",1294272000,66,3824,4.324965132496513
