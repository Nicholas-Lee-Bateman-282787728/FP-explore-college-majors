4121377,4,B003GAMOIW,"Considering all the garbage movie critics have to sit through in a year, it's pretty amazing when a film that's smarter than most hits theaters and makes a bit of an impact. Independent films are one thing, but major ones released by bigger studios are even a bigger deal when this occurs. I think that's one of the reasons Inception was so great. Creativity and intelligence are two things that are usually lacking from blockbusters. The Adjustment Bureau is a film that has a bit more to it than you're probably expecting. Based on ""The Adjustment Group,"" a short story by Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report), The Adjustment Bureau has probably already caught your attention either because you're a fan of Dick's work and/or the movies that were adapted from it.

The film's charm is definitely in its explanation for things. The way the bureau works and how they function is a wonder in itself. You'll never look at a door or a man wearing a hat the same way again after viewing the film. Perhaps the most interesting is Thompson's explanation of how events in history like The Great Depression and The Holocaust came about. The story is very imaginative and different from the norm, which is always a fantastic change in pace when it comes to film. At the same time though, those who like having absolutely everything explained to them will probably be disappointed. The Adjustment Bureau explains enough to get the wheels in your brain turning and leaves some things open to your interpretation, which could hurt someone's overall opinon of the film depending on the viewer.

I've never been the biggest Matt Damon fan. My favorite memory involving him was the Team America parody that he wasn't even involved with, but I think of that ""Matt Damon!"" line every time I see him on screen. However, he did have strong showings in both Hereafter and True Grit from last year. He keeps the trend going here. David seems to be a guy who was once fueled by speaking in front of hundreds of people and politics, but has now replaced that void with Elyse. The chemistry he has with Elyse, despite feeling somewhat brief, is one of the driving factors of the film. Anthony Mackie winds up being the most memorable bureau agent mostly because he has an emotional tie to David, but John Slattery and Terence Stamp have some pretty noteworthy performances as well.

I have the impression that a lot of people will write this off as a Men In Black ripoff, but The Adjustment Bureau is a bit more clever than either Men In Black film. The films surely have their similarities, but The Adjustment Bureau deserves to be given a chance. I think it'll surprise a lot of viewers.

The Adjustment Bureau is easily the smartest live-action film to be released in the first few months of 2011. With a solid cast, a hefty helping of creativity, and just an absorbing experiencing overall, The Adjustment Bureau is bound to leave a lasting impression when it comes time to look back on the best films of the year. The film leaves you questioning how much of your life is really left to fate and chance. Films seem to leave an impression that lasts longer if it makes you think or strikes a cord or hits close to home in some capacity. This film does that and then some. It comes highly recommended even if you have your reservations about it.",1299110400,11,3347,4.648648648648648
4121378,3,B003GAMOIW,"The Adjustment Bureau is well-acted, with engaging performances by Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, and it keeps your attention throughout, moving at a quick pace and exploring interesting concepts of fate, choice, divine intervention, historical development, and free will. Still, taken as a whole, the film is uneven and philosophically untenable. The movie purports to be a celebration of free will over a strict determinism: you must ""fight for your free will"" (a notion that entails some circular logic: you need to use an act of the will in order to be able to have willful acts?). Moreover, the central narrative tension (without giving too much away) is presented as being a battle between fate and free will, but certain plot developments make it such that it is actually a tension between two different sorts of fate; the supposedly ""free"" will that is praised by the movie is itself tempered by a sort of determinism.
The movie's messages are mixed: there's a higher power watching out for us, but it is good to defy that power; we don't know what's best for us, but we should follow our heart; some people are ""destined"" for each other, but we get to choose who we love, and so forth.

The view of history that is presented in the background of the film (in a description of how the Bureau has intervened in the past) reflects a rather unsophisticated interpretation of historical eras (with, for instance, the ""highly-cultured"" Roman Empire being a result of a high degree of the Bureau's intervention, and the ""Dark Ages"" being the barbaric result of the misuse of human free will). The historical periods in which the Bureau is said to have been intervening the most (Roman Empire, Enlightenment, Scientific Revolution) are also, ironically, the periods in which humans depended most on their own reason, while the periods when the Bureau pulled back and let humans run the show (notably the Middle Ages) tended to be times when people were most aware of a higher power. You're left with a view of a higher power (Fate? God?) that is hidden and does not want to be discovered (like Deism), and yet is extremely involved in guiding history (the opposite of Deism). And the more the power intervenes, the less it is acknowledged.

If you're looking for an entertaining movie with a believable romance, this one works. But if you're looking for a movie with a philosophically nuanced and consistent premise, you're best off looking elsewhere.",1298764800,4,2449,4.870503597122302
4121389,5,B003GAMOIW,"One of my all time favorite movies.
Interesting and unique premise; well executed.
Makes me nervous around people with hats.
One note:
The Adjustment Bureau appears to be somewhat gender exclusive: all the 'adjusters' are men.
I'd like to see a sequel, wherein the two lead characters are recruited by the Bureau.
After all he went through, I think he deserves his own hat.",1523318400,,373,4.84375

4121413,4,B003GAMOIW,"This was a pleasant film, which I recently viewed on the Sci-Fy channel. I enjoyed more than not and thought that the cast, overall, gave good performances, despite the flawed script. The premise of the films involves a guy, David (Matt Damon) and a girl, Elise (Emily Blunt). He is a politician, and she is a dancer. They meet, and it is Kismet. It is as if they were meant to be together.

Unfortunately, an other worldly group, known as the  Adjustment  Bureau, thinks otherwise. It seems that humans only think that they have free will, as everything is actually planned out by a higher power, since humans have a propensity for major screw-ups. So, David and Elise are pulled asunder, only to discover that the best laid plans often go awry.

I have seen these themes of free will and predestination addressed in other films. Mildly entertaining, this one pales in comparison to ""Sliding Doors"", which was a far superior film.",1515974400,,931,4.728395061728395

4121418,3,B003GAMOIW,"Nice concept, very solid play by both lead actors. Right mixture of action and lyricism. Would have given it a solid 4, maybe even 5. The last scene on the roof, however, killed it all.

Indeed, one would need to ask herself - what would the run for the almighty Chairman can result in? That is, we all know the ending gotta be good, or everybody will hate the movie. So the question really is - how will the Chairman turn this pursuit into happiness and why.

And the answer offered - you just wanted your way and so you got it - delivered in the course of whole 3 last minutes of the movie - is just lame.
C'mon writers, put on your creativity hat - couldn't you come up with ANYTHING more original and unexpected??? How could possibly the Chairman messenger (since nobody could see the mysterious Ch-man) just praise their free choice after a convincing explanation there is none?
A good script brought an impossible and challenging situation to a head; and filmmakers failed the challenge - spectacularly. Hey, creative writing - anyone?..",1514592000,,1043,4.602150537634409

4121437,1,B003GAMOIW,"Shallow, dumb, and self-contradictory. Blunt's acting was also terrible, though everyone else's was OK. She didn't seem to be emotionally invested in it at all, and often came across almost like she had a head injury. Weird, since I've never seen her make such a hatchet job of a role before. The writing couldn't have helped, of course. The whole plot was absolutely ridiculous, and Damon's character in particular came across as incredibly selfish, self-absorbed, and criminally unconcerned about the effects of his actions on others -- with the one exception of the unbelievable, pixie-like idiot he allegedly, inexplicably fell for. Even the memory of his family had no effect, and neither they nor anyone else were ever mentioned -- by him, the ""angels,"" or anyone else. In the end, ""the Chairman"" gives way to their obviously lust-driven, impulsive, selfish desires? At the expense of God knows how many? Only Hollywood could write this drivel, probably ""inspired"" by copious amounts of illicit chemicals.",1507852800,,1011,5.208588957055214

4121465,5,B003GAMOIW,"This film The Adjustment Bureau features Matt Damon as David Norris and Emily Blunt as Elise Sellas. David Norris unintentionally meets Elise Sellas by accident as they talk about the political run that he did. David Norris and Elise Sellas mutually end up being in romantic love with each other but life has other plans for David Norris. David Norris also ends up in circumstances where he meets some men who say that they are in charge of following his life. Anthony Mackie features as Harry Mitchell  and John Slattery stars as Richardson, Terrence Stamp as Thompson, three of the men who are tasked with orchestrating certain events in peoples lives. Norris has to keep secret even from those closest to him what has happened to him. For instance, Norris admits to his coworker Charlie Traynor (Michael Kelly) how he is going to miss Elise Sellas in one plot scene but he has to conceal the full story from him. I have to credit the author of the Hacking the Afterlife kindlebook (Richard Martini) for inspiring me with the idea to check out this film. One of the reasons why The Adjustment Bureau film catches my attention is that it plays with the idea of fate versus destiny.  Obviously, there is much more to this film as well as other actors featured in this film, yet I know that I must take into account other people looking at this review analysis who are interested in seeing The Adjustment Bureau. I could only speak for myself as I understand that The Adjustment Bureau film is creative fiction, but I personally believe that my own life is a combination of both fate and destiny yet that it is my job to creatively engage both my intuition (instinctive nature) and logic (rational thinking) to wisely decide what areas of my life I am the master of my ship in and which ones I have to creatively meld with my destiny/what is fated.",1501372800,2,1847,4.6109422492401215

Damon's feeble attempts at chemistry, love, passion or even liking Blunt as a person are not convincing.  It's sad to see Hollywood tag their people with monikers of ""talented, exciting or star"" when such a weak performance is delivered.

Emily Blunt is equally dull and would be much better off playing her ""Devil Wears Prada"" character rather than appear with Damon.  She was good in D.W.P.",1495584000,,528,4.833333333333333

I did not like this movie. It's not so bad that I don't understand how anybody can like it. It's just not my cup of tea. I didn't read the story by Phillip Dick in which it is based on.
It's a romance/science fiction movie that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Yeah....I get the 'ripples' thing but there just isn't a whole lot that makes sense. Too many plot holes.
Who exactly are these people from the bureau? How were they hired? Are they human? Who is the Chairman? Is he God or something else? What's up with all those doors going to different place in New York City?
More importantly, has any politician ever really been that morally perfect? Ok So I'm making this complicated. I'm just not a fan of love stories....which this movie essentially is.

Remembered all the broad strokes and a lot of the details, but I still wanted that dang story to advance even though I knew it would and exactly how it would.  See?  Something else keeps the viewer in the seat in addition to all the film cinematically offers.  Probably true of all films that ""get me"" -- something else unseen there may be in the first or more viewings.  Nice.  Emily and Matt both delivered.  The film has more gravitas than, say, Heaven Can Wait, by a whole notch.  My five stars does not mean I thought this film or any of the achievements of it are worthy of the highest rating -- only that five stars is not enough to delineate.  8.5 stars on a ten point system.  But when I give five stars here, it means I don't want to deconstruct this work to sleuth out the flaws.  It passed all my tests -- YMMV.",1472515200,2,897,4.151162790697675

4121615,4,B003GAMOIW,"The movie takes a few liberties with Philip K. Dicks story, but the story was too short to support a movie so embellishment was necessary. Religious belief in a creator (known here as the Chairman, like Frank Sinatra) is at the core the story but it doesnt overwhelm. The addition of a love story (love as fate, as in we were meant to be together) will appeal to people who still have romance in their hearts (those for whom it hasn't been burned away by the hellfire of reality).

Mostly the story is just kind of fun, as the protagonist battles to place his own desires ahead of those imposed upon him by the Chairman. The movie clings to the concept of free will, which makes people happy since they like to believe it exists, even as neurobiologists are becoming more convinced that it doesnt. Im one of those who likes to pretend I have free will because its more comforting than accepting the likelihood that my choices are mostly determined by forces other than my intellect.

The actors all give solid performances. Chases through doors that open onto unexpected destinations are always fun to watch. In fact, the movie is more fun than deep, but theres nothing wrong with having fun.",1467590400,,1192,4.617924528301887

Dick, had me cheering.  Some of my cheers were for Dick and director George Nolfi (who also penned the screenplay) who combined to create a great thriller that doesn't include a single explosion or gun shot (okay, there's one small car crash) and presented 'villains' who don't need to be nasty-evil to make one fear them.  I cheered also for my first view of Damon in a romantic lead, totally believable as a young political up-and-comer and a love-struck man.  And saving the best for last I also cheered for Emily Blunt, seen by me for the first time and was all the more impressed with her performance when I later learned she'd had no training as a dancer prior to signing on for this movie.  Astounding.  Add to that a great supporting cast headed by Anthony Mackie and Terrance Stamp and you have a movie that deserves to be on your DVD shelf.",1445212800,13,1010,4.527472527472527

4121881,2,B003GAMOIW,"David Norris is a rising political star, but then a chance meeting with beautiful ballerina Elise leads him to fall hopelessly in love.  Only problem: this isn't part of the plan of the Chairman of the universe.  So the Chairman sends in angel-like agents from the Adjustment Bureau to alter David's path, and prevent him from ever seeing Elise again.  That's the premise of The Adjustment Bureau, a 2011 romantic thriller starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt.

The movie is based on a Philip K. Dick short story ""Adjustment Team"", and many viewers will immediately realize how it addresses the age-old philosophical question about the relationship of divine sovereignty and human responsibility, particularly the question of whether the idea of God's predestination and control allows any room for human choice or free will.  Is there any true freedom of choice, or does God's master plan mean that our lives are determined by fate, and that we are helpless in the hands of a tyrannical dictator with his unchanging master plan?

As a story, it's a gripping and well-told tale.  We are brought into David's world, and share his confusion as he slowly discovers that someone upstairs is set on determining his life in a very different direction than his own heart wants.  But it's the deeper issues raised by the film that will really interest viewers like myself.  Comparisons with other clever and thought-provoking sci-fi films like The Matrix, Inception, and even The Truman Show quickly come to mind.  Unfortunately, despite appearing to be an intellectual exercise in exploring these philosophical questions, in reality the Adjustment Bureau doesn't live up to its promise or treat these deeper themes seriously or adequately.

First of all, I found the romantic premise to be flawed.  Elise ends up abandoning a man she is engaged to after a long-term relationship, all because of a brief and short encounter with a man in a bathroom, and later on a bus.  Really?  That's certainly not how love works in the real world.  What's pictured here is at best a superficial attraction, and such desires and feelings are not at all a reliable guide for deciding to enter into a life-long relationship, or for such a relationship to last.  Such feelings, the film tells us, can't be wrong.  Well, actually they can be, and this ""follow your heart"", ""love is all you need"" thinking has destroyed many a relationship, and doomed many a new one.  Sadly the film never really gets beyond a view of love as a first-sight and physical attraction, and presents a very warped view of true and lasting romantic relationships.  This is confirmed by the fact that David apparently beds Elise (we are spared most of the details, but it's obvious what is going on) on what is effectively their first date.  Viewers should also be aware of several unnecessary and disappointing incidences of blasphemy and profanity; certainly the PG-13 rating is justified.

Furthermore, the film seems to conclude that freedom of choice comes when we insist on our own feelings and way, and this causes the larger divine master-plan to adjust or be changed.  But what about a different view of the relationship between fate and free will, namely one where our choices are actually part of God's master-plan?  One cannot help but think that the Christian concept of a world sovereignly ruled according to God's plan is being implicitly challenged by this film, and if so, not only is it a straw-man argument based on a caricature, but the solution is not satisfying or convincing.  To be fair, the film's screenwriter and director George Nolfi has stated that he wants to leave its interpretation open and ambiguous, and not identify the Chairman specifically with the Christian God, so that people of all faiths could enjoy and consider the questions the film raises.  But the film pretends to ask big questions, but doesn't really answer them fairly or properly, not to mention it is flawed in how it asks them.

Perhaps these criticisms are reading too much into the film, and the deeper questions raised by the Adjustment Bureau are simply intended as a philosophical backdrop to an entertaining story, and nothing more.  As such, this film is likely best enjoyed simply as entertainment, and any religious conclusions it appears to make aren't to be taken seriously.  But for myself I still find the philosophical backdrop for the plot troubling, because of the wrong messages it seems to imply about God's involvement in human history, and the wrong messages it conveys about love.  It doesn't give a clear or reliable guidance about the divine drama of history, but it relies on a spiritually confusing treatment of the predestination/free will paradox.  Sadly, this is a love story that gives a flawed message both about God and about love, and is disappointing in anything it has to say about theology or about romance.  While appearing to offer a lot of food for thought, it doesn't provide us with anything truly nutritious. It may be an exciting, clever, and thought-provoking film, but for me it's ultimately disappointing. - GODLY GADFLY (August 2015)",1438646400,,5132,4.9533255542590435

 Sci-Fi master Philip K. Dick has had nine of his works adapted for the big screen including Total Recall, Minority Report, Screamers, A Scanner Darkly, Blade Runner, Paycheck, Next and Imposter.  More films based on his stories are in the works.  The Adjustment Bureau is the latest in this distinguished company.  World famous stars are attracted to his works because of their subtle moral complexity and texture.  And of course they are rollicking good yarns.
 This tale can be thought of as two stories smushed together.  In one tale a classic love story unfolds involving an aspiring politician (played by Matt Damon-who keeps getting better as an actor) and a beautiful and free spirited young dancer (enchantingly drawn by Emily Blunt in a spectacular bit of acting.)  To my mind this combination of Damon and Blunt in a romantic drama must be considered as the most compelling, realistic and satisfying film love story in a long time.  There is real chemistry between this unlikely pair that cannot be dismissed.  We would have a lovely movie experience if we had only the love story to watch.
 But thanks to the paranoid genius of Philip K. Dick, we have another entire story to enjoy.  The lovers are thwarted by the machinations of mysterious men in hats.  Damon asks one of them if they are angels.  The man in the hat replies that We have been called that.  What begins with a strangers kiss becomes a twisted theological tale, a deep examination of one of the central disputes in Christianity.  Is there free will in a universe where the All Knowing Creator sees even the fall of a sparrow before it happens?  Or do humans, created in the spiritual image of God, have free will?  As usual, Dick has his own quirky solution to this dispute.
 Blade Runner transformed Dicks story Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? into one of the great classic films of Science Fiction.  Some of his other films have not always translated to film with the same success.  They are all worth watching.  The Adjustment Bureau must rank near to the top of the film adaptations of his work.  Thank the stars, Damon and Blunt, for the success of this interesting, entertaining and important film.
 Director George Nolfi also wrote the adaptation.  It is, in the film version, his vision and he makes it work.  He will surely be financially happy that he also served as the producer.  This four saw blade movie runs only one hour and thirty nine minutes.  The film is rated PG-13.
 This movie should be seen for the fine acting efforts of the stars and for the theological inquiry.  You will go away thinking about very big things.",1437350400,,2644,4.722100656455142

4121991,2,B003GAMOIW,"The Adjustment Bureau started out alright, and the mystery seemed compelling initially.  But ultimately, it became too sentimental in a non-specific way.  Also, the basic premise was a little flat.  If you are really excited about the idea of life being written out for you by a powerful being that heads a huge, unchangeable bureaucracy, then this movie might suit you.  Unfortunately, I found that to be a kind of cheesy, overly literal God reference all dressed up like Men in Black, but without the fun and laughter.  In the end, it was like you were supposed to go from being scared of the ""bureau"" to sort of feeling like it's actually good if you only understood it. The acting was fine, but the story was just too stiff and sappy to really enjoy. Everyone I watched it with was disappointed because it seemed like it had potential and because we all love action and mystery, don't mind a bit of romance if not overdone, and totally dug the last Emily Blunt movie we saw (Edge of Tomorrow).",1432166400,,997,4.578651685393258

4122088,5,B003GAMOIW,"I love The Adjustment Bureau with Matt Damon and Emily Blunt.

That's all there is to it.

This is the story of a young politician who has just lost his seat in Congress, but he has met the girl of his dreams.  It's love at first sight for both of them.

The only catch is that the Adjustment Bureau suddenly appears (angels who look like men and wear fedoras on their head) and set things in motion so he'll never see her again.  They fear she will prevent him from eventually becoming the President of the United States and changing the world to a better place for mankind.  The bureau even allows Matt to see them so he knows how serious they are about this situation.  To disobey them and go after the girl would mean they'd have to erase his mind forever.

Ah, but the strange thing is (not that all of this isn't strange) you can't tell the heart who to love and not to love.  It's one of those mysteries of life.  The heart, no matter what happens, will win over the mind.  That's exactly what happens when Matt decides to ignore the bureau and to find Emily Blunt against all odds and a race against time.

Both Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are excellent in this film, protraying their characters with total belief and displaying for the audience what two people will do to be together.  Emily has such beauty, humour, and grace as a dancer, that you will understand why Matt's character would throw everything to the wind just to be with her.

Another thing is that the concept of the film causes one to wonder about how much control we actually have over our lives and what's really meant to be.  Do we control events or do they control us?  Are we destined to pursue a certain course in life with people entering and exiting it, helping to guide us along the way?  Those are questions I've been thinking about over the years.  One thing I know, however, is that neither death nor hell will prevent me from being with the person I love.  That's both the power and curse of love.

I've heard many individual describe this film as a science fiction movie.  True, it is.  But, The Adjustment Bureau is also a love story on the grandest scale.  If you're an old romantic like me, you'll want to see this film.  Then, take the hand of the person you love and run like hell!

One last thing.  There are about an hour of ""Behind-the-Scenes"" featurettes on the Blu-ray disc dealing with the making of the film and why New York was chosen for the locale.  Great stuff!",1422057600,,2467,4.364835164835164

The movie builds to a climax where you are rooting for our two heroes as they try desperately to stay one step ahead of the agents pursuing them while all the while feeling that they cannot ever escape.

4122287,3,B003GAMOIW,"A lot of the comments here suggest that the movie is about free will versus fate, and the dialogue within the movie is often cast in those terms, but that's to miss the total arbitrariness with which the so-called ""plan"" for David's and Elise's lives can be itself adjusted.  There was an earlier plan -- let's call it Plan A -- that was superseded by a later version -- let's say Plan B -- but for some reason, or more likely no reason, bits of Plan A are still included in the Plan B planning book.  Why?  Well, the bureau is short-handed and can't keep tabs on everybody all the time (as one agent admits to David), and to make matters harder for the bureau, a degree of physical proximity is necessary if an agent is to take action to keep a person on track.  Making it even harder, dry weather is needed, for water seems to fog up the power that the agents have in their pursuits.  What they have going for them is an intricate passage of shortcuts that only they know, though only when they're wearing their hats.  I'm not making this up!!  And we learn by the end that perhaps even Plan B can itself be over-ridden, or adjusted, or rewritten.  The motive for -- or ""telos"" of -- the Plan(s)?  Not even the agents know -- that's for the Chairman to know and the agents to implement.  And the Chairman can change his mind.

Is it clear from what I've said that we're pretty close to the realm of farce here?  Lots of crazy running around, and going through doors -- the one into Yankee Stadium was my favorite -- and not really a sense that a whole lot was at stake.  This is light entertainment, and none of the Fate/Free Will stuff is to be taken remotely seriously -- heck, even the agents don't really know what they're doing.  So the viewer goes along for the ride to see how this very pleasant young couple will finally get together and stay together.  Matt Damon, always an appealing actor, is fine as David, a rising political star.  Emily Blunt, engagingly direct and not plastic-pretty, is Elise, a rising dancer.  They meet apparently by chance, although the meeting was actually part of Plan A that mistakenly got left in Plan B . . . . you get the idea?  David, unlike most of us, finds out about the Plan and is warned off the woman he loves.  Well, that's not going to work . . . and the fun of the movie is how these people try to get together again, with a lot of people running after them trying to stop them.

The action is well-filmed, the supporting cast includes John Slattery and Anthony Mackie as agents, smooth and soulful respectively.  Terence Stamp is Thompson, a nastier, more senior agent, and how an actress of Jennifer Ehle's caliber ended up playing a barmaid in two short scenes, I don't know -- but there she is.  As for the overall effect -- just don't over-think it (for it doesn't raise questions coherently) and enjoy the thrill of the chase.",1407283200,,2886,4.375234521575985

4122317,3,B003GAMOIW,"Inspired by Philip K. Dick short story ""Adjustment Team"", this is a watchable SF film, but nothing more. It could have been better with some more work on the scenario, but clearly this whole thing was made in a hurry and there was not enough time to adjust it...))) Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This film is about a young congressman, David Norris (Matt Damon), who one day meets in rather unusual circumstances Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt), a young, very attractive dancer (it is important to precise that she dances ballet - exclusively). This short meeting develops almost immediately into a mutual fascination... Unfortunately, their meeting wasn't supposed to happen and was just an unfortunate glitch in the Great Master Plan of Reality - and this kind of thing calls for an adjustment by a special reality police, if necessary by some extreme measures... And then the film really begins.

This film is actually better than the original short story in which the ""hero"" was extremely pale, the romance was absent and the ending very anti-climactic. Here we can actually root for somebody and care about what will happen to David and Elise, who are indeed the perfect example of ""star crossed lovers""  and this film is in fact a kind of ""romantic comedy"" SF... The film is not excessively long, there are some smart twists and some humour and at the end I was rather pleased with this watching experience.

the film has however also some serious scenario weaknesses which hurt it a lot. Both main characters seem to be not fully designed, as if the scenarist didn't have enough time to finish them. David is actually a kind of pale, uninteresting guy - God knows why he seems to be such a success with voters... Elise seems to be a plucky, perky girl in the beginning but then her character slows down and withers with every next scene - in the second half of the film she barely speaks and when she does, the scenario hardly gives her the opportunity to say something interesting... In the first half an hour of film dialogs are quite honest, but then it changes radically... Also, by moments the whole romance between David and Elise seems a little bit articificial and forced - and let's not even talk about the immensely romantic place of their first meeting...

In a film which is all about rips and wrinkles in the reality fabric you can rightly expect a lot of plot holes and there is indeed a LOT of them - but somehow they don't do so much damage.

You will also definitely never look at people wearing hats in the same way as before you watched this movie...)))

Bottom line, this is a honest film, quite watchable but I would advise to rent rather than buy (as I did), because this is basically a thing to see once. Enjoy!",1405382400,,2766,4.63265306122449

4122325,5,B003GAMOIW,"I truly enjoyed this film, more than once. There is an interesting philosophical question being raised here, one I think we all wonder about. Is our fate of our own choosing? If so our choices may damn us or save us. But if some other force controls our thoughts, our interactions-for puposes we aren't even aware of, then our entire lives may not be of our own choosing - and the results, good or bad, have little to do with us. Is our fate in our stars or in our selves?
This movie is a bit contrived in it's handling of an issue that we must all wonder about but it's quite involving, intelligent, and leaves you with something to think about.

Matt Damon is, as usual, marvelous. He's real. You believe in this guy. I honestly forgot about Matt Damon and felt immensely for the the character, David, that he was playing. What more can you ask of an actor. Ellise,his counterpart, is adorable, loveable and true to the story. It really is worth seeing and recommending to friends.",1404777600,8,983,4.461111111111111

It is thought provoking regarding when it comes to fate vs chance, and makes you ponder those 'coincidences' and nudges that when you look back you see how what you thought was a meaningless choice turns your life in a totally new direction.
This movie also shows the viewer that joy and love do matter in our lives, and we miss so much when we just listen and follow cold logic and reason.  Maybe if we pulled up our bootstraps and really fought for what we know is right for us in our hearts - stop believing that others know us better and just be ""sheeple"" - humanity does have chance in making this world survive a long, long time.",1402358400,2,813,4.328947368421052

But we each must live with the consequences of our choices, be they wise and happy or unwise and miserable!

4122396,5,B003GAMOIW,"Your stuck in traffic and realize you are going to miss an appointment that you were sure would launch your career. Could you have made it taking a different route or leaving earlier? The guy just a few people behind you purchased the winning lottery ticket and you wonder; what if you had listened to that nagging urge to linger in the store longer instead of rushing to get out? All the times you wonder or wished you were at the right place at the right time. Is it dumb luck that these opportunities are missed or is it by design? This movie puts together a very interesting and compelling possibility to what drives the direction our lives take. The Adjustment Bureau will make you wonder if there is anybody pulling your strings as well.

The Adjustment Bureau is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick; the author whose work has been adapted to movies like Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly and more. While the movie deviates a little from the short story the general premise is the same. In the movie an up and coming politician (Matt Damon) runs into a girl by chance and falls in love. The problem is he wasn't supposed to. And a mysterious organization that controls the direction of people's lives gets involved. From that comes an interesting web of intrigue that is one part conspiracy theory and one part fantasy. It runs like a both a drama and a light thriller.

What makes the movie good is how much it gives you early on. There is no pretense as to what is going on. From the get go Damon knows there is an adjustment bureau and he knows what they do. The point of the story is what he does in spite of the fact he knows his destiny is being controlled, especially when it comes to that destiny depriving him of the woman he loves. The movie is also good because of how little it gives you. Who are the adjustment bureau? Are they angels with God as their Chairman? Are they aliens guiding our development? Are they something else entirely? You get enough to know they are out there and what they can do, however you don't get any answers on who they are or why they are doing this. This really makes the movie shine because it leaves the viewer to their own philosophical questions instead of being spoon fed everything.

As I said before this movie is mostly a drama. Maybe a romantic drama. However there are instances of intrigue and even a bit of action. No explosions, gun play or fight choreography. However you do get a few chase scenes that do up pace of the film effectively. All in all there is a good balance of exposition, romance and action to make the movie flow smoothly without getting boring or frantic. Acting is most effective with the emotionless bureau operatives not acting like robots; just detached. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt have excellent chemistry and pull off an effective relationship portrayal. The cinematography is spot on and takes advantage of some gorgeous Manhattan scenery that help bring some variation between scenes.

This Blu-Ray video is 1080p VC-1 and looks really, really good. There have been some debate that the VC-1 codec is inferior to AVC, but I couldn't tell any inferiorities with this disc. The visuals are sharp and impressive, however this is not an eye candy type film so I wouldn't use it as a gauge for Blu-Ray hardware. The audio is clear with the right kind of atmosphere on the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track (there is also a Spanish and French DTS 5.1 track). The dialog is important on this film, and the BD mix keeps the dialog in the forefront, which is a good thing.

The BD release has all the same bonus features as the DVD, and as a bonus they are in high definition. There is also an additional featurette not available on the DVD. Here is the breakdown:

Feature Commentary by Writer-Director George Nolfi -  It's a little sparse, but when he does make comments they are pretty informative. No commentaries from the cast or rest of the crew.

Deleted and Extended Scenes (1080p - 6:64) - Seven deleted and extended scenes. Most of the footage is apparently a character (caseworker Henderson) they decided to cut completely out of the movie. They are kind of funny scenes, but I can see how that distracts the flow.

Labyrinth of Doors (1080p - 33:57) - This is the Blu-Ray exclusive and is an interactive featurette where you go through doors to get to either film clips or behind the scenes footage. The running time is a total of the various small clips.

Leaping Through New York (1080i - 7:36) - This bonus focuses on the on location shooting and has interviews as well as an overview of the process.

Destined to Be (1080i - 4:51) - Interviews with Matt Damon and Emily Blunt regarding the romance angle between the two characters.

Becoming Elise (1080i - 7:08) - Interviews with Emily Blunt regarding the preparation she did for the character. This includes a healthy dose of behind the scenes footage showing the training she did for the dancing she had to do for her role.

Digital Copy - An activation code for you to download the movie from a website.

BD-Live - A chance to download additional content if they ever make any. You can also rent other Universal movies through BD-Live.

pocketBLU - Communicate with the BD with your mobile device.

My Scenes - A way to make your own movie clips.

News Ticker - Annoying advertising from Universal.

D-Box - If you have a D-Box chair (moves and shakes to movies) this is a code for you to use it on this film.

The Adjustment Bureau is a fascinating look into the concept of your future being predestined. It is done in such a way that doesn't get too far into the fantasy element and has a lot to offer a broad spectrum of viewers.

Matt Damon accidentally finds out about the Adjusters. Who inform him that they can not be a couple. Their paths go in different directions. With this setup its him against the Adjusters. Damon trying very hard to get together with Emily and the Adjusters trying just as hard to see that they don't. Who will win?  I recommend this film.

The acting is excellent, the writing is as well.  Nolfi nails it.  The plot is fine even though the focused ""negative"" review would have you believe otherwise.  He just doesn't get it.
If you have had things happen to you that are, shall we say, unexplained, AND you noticed that what happened doesn't fit, you might actually believe that this could be true.  Maybe some unexplained happenstance occurred to the author which prompted him to write this screenplay.  Don't worry, NO ONE will ever believe it.  And keep it to yourself!!!  That phone call that doesn't go through at a critical time, Bumping into someone, the voice inside your head that suddenly pushes you to do something that you would otherwise never, ever do, but somehow, some way, you instinctively just do it.

After the loss of his entire family and an 8-year career climb as the youngest ever Congressman - US Senate hopeful David Norris is poised for the throne of New York State when a barroom moon years earlier conveniently makes the front page of The Post. Preparing his defeat speech by himself in the men's toilet of a plush hotel - David meets a woman's who's crashed a wedding on a dare and is hiding out in the cubicles from Security. Earthy, natural and everything his crafted campaign strategy isn't - the flighty and talented British ballet dancer Elise is a breath of fresh air. He is stunned and smitten after only minutes of electrifying conversation and they quickly launch into a mutually uncontrollable snog...

But mystery men who stalk the top of Manhattan buildings wearing 1940's style Trilby hats and immaculate overcoats - have other ideas. They carry with them books that show every-changing grids and expanding street maps like they're controlling people's lives. They are convinced their all-powerful 'chairman' has decreed that these two people's pathways must not converge no matter what the personal cost. So David and Elise need to be subtly 'adjusted'.

Adapted from another ingenious Philip K Dick story (other adaptations include ""Blade Runner"", ""A Scanner Darkly"", ""Minority Report"" and ""Total Recall"") - the look of the film is cleverly not futuristic. Director George Nolfi uses glossy uptown locations, clean-lined buildings and real world sets so that it doesn't feel like the mind-bending world of ""Inception"". And the God' angle doesn't get in the way of the story but only adds to it. David's struggle with his heart-versus-politics is brilliantly handled. His suddenly honest speech to the party faithful about ""Phrases that pulled traction with focus groups..."" and why his ties and shoes have the right colour and correct mount of scuffing to secure the workingman's vote - is properly brilliant writing. Then a dozing operative (a great part for David Mackie) forgets to spill coffee on Norris' shirt at exactly 7:05 a.m. one morning before he boards a bus to work - and thus begins the dance of David and Elise towards each other as fate hooks them up and they click like they did before.

As you can imagine with subject matter as ropey as this - it could all have gone horribly wrong in the hands of some `name' stars that might look good but share no real vibe. But the naturalness of both lead actors goes a long way to making the audience care. There are many moments between them as characters that are genuinely touching - giggling over coffee and mobile phones - racing each other down a night street in the wet. Then David stumbles on a mind recalibration in progress in his offices and runs like any scared man would. But he's cornered in a car park by these angels of sorts and is told that not only is his relationship with Elise verboten but if he tells anyone of their existence - he'll be memory-lobotomised (but in a nice way). But love has taken hold of his heart and hers - and they make a run for a future together despite the overwhelming odds.

Will freedom of choice and protecting your soul mate win the day? Well after a few trips to Yankee Stadium and the Statue of Liberty via doors that act as portals and a little help from an angel who feels his assignment is just plain wrong - they might just stand a chance - despite the efforts of a fearsome Terrance Stamp and a bumbling John Slattery (both superbly cast in their parts).

""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a lovely upbeat film with wit, charm and cleverness in its storyline that will keep you coming back for more.

THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU revolves around a heady, far-out concept conveyed in simple everyday terms. The concepts/conflicts are all explained away to young maverick aspiring senator David Norris (Matt Damon) by the ""Adjustment Men"" who oversee the destiny of the world and everyone in it. This, of course, kills this film's potential as a think-piece that many might want but makes it accessible to a more casual audience. Somehow, it all works splendidly, mostly because of the fine acting by all and the solid human interest story of Norris's love for ballerina Elise Sella, memorably played by Emily Blunt, a relationship that goes against the plans of the mysterious ""Chairman"" who makes all the rules and plans our lives for us.

This film is the most realistic sort of fantasy. . .or is it really fantasy?. . . that one can imagine. It's also good science fiction, even for people who generally hate science fiction. Finally, there is excellent social satire regarding politics, civilization in general, and all sorts of other things. While THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU takes what it has to say seriously, its mood is light-hearted and funny, without any need for serious violence or gore.

As Einstein said, ""If you cannot explain it simply, you do not understand it well enough."" That being said, the creators of this film, based on a short story by the inimitable Philip K. Dick, knew exactly what they were doing.",1391817600,,1427,4.96234309623431

Thats right, I am the Chairman, and I just had you recalibrated so you would love this movie. Chances are, though, you didn't need the recalibration in the first place. I know I didnt.

This stunning tale of forbidden romance, mysterious totalitarian control, and the dichotomy between free will and predestination comes through strong in this alternate reality tale. David Norris is a US Congressman that is vying for the New York state Senate race. He loses to his competitor, but ends up meeting stunning Elise in the mens bathroom. This quirky introduction is just the finite tip of her outgoing personality, and the two instantly hit it off. Fate is on their side when they meet again, against the wishes of the Adjustment Borough, who happen to slip up that morning by missing the chance to have Norris spill his coffee.

After the fateful meeting, Norris is abducted by the Borough and finds out how they control every aspect of our lives in an effort to shape things for the better. They tell him that he cannot pursue Elise because it is not in the master plan, which is the guide for all of their actions.

While they seemingly have the world's best interests in mind, Norris is not satisfied, and spends the next few years thinking of her constantly. It is only when they meet randomly once again when he sees her on the street that he feels complete. Instantly, the borough arrives to intervene, as they have been following him closely since it is hinted he is meant to become President.

A haphazard battle for control ensues, as the borough tries to dissuade Norris, and eventually succeeds by telling him he would ruin her career if he stayed with her. More time passes, during which Elise gets engaged once more to her old fiance.

The end culminates with a bang, as Norris races through time and space in order to salvage his love and win Elise back. She is transfixed by him, and even though he has hurt her, he trusts her. This, while one of the sappiest parts of the movie, is the part I enjoyed the most. She willingly chooses the unknown because he is guiding her. Their love is some unspeakable connection that draws them together even when the the gods push them apart. For a neoplatonist like myself, this universal and seemingly everlasting desire is really the highlight of the film.

Other than that, it's just a cool concept that I think was well developed. The movie gives us enough background information on this mysterious agency in order to be satisfied and not distracted by gaping plot holes or eluded answers. However, while this story is certainly complete, it would be interesting to see how the borough handles other cases - certainly Norris can't be the only one who ever found out about them, nor the only one who ever challenged their authority.

In any case, it is a tale that gets its point across throughout its duration. Love surpasses everything, even the will of the gods, if it is true enough. And every path can be changed, or perhaps bent, if one is strong enough to mend their ways.",1391558400,,3149,4.765137614678899

We were together for 28 and a half years, almost 24 hours a day since we worked from home and I truly miss her every second.

This has happen too many times to be a coincidence its happen about over 10 times I say not. NO Its NOT DUMB LUCK has mostly happen to with their ex calling or why is it when you have someone boyfriend/girlfriend guys or girls know this..then they come out the wood works everyone wants you then but when your not with anyone they don't AND NO ITS NOT BECAUSE YOUR CONFIDENCE IS HIGH..ive seen to many strange things this scenario is also in the movie...I knew these things before the movie and i ve kinda always looked For the path to go I'm an great observer..truthfully that has always kept me out of the most trouble. I will even go into greater detail ""there are people I knew were no good for me times in my life"" reason I know is they were not good influence for my good or love me in that way but I wanted to be with them for whatever reason..then I've watched almost like counter intellegents on that relationship..examples the appearance of cheating...I did not cheat on them...but they see my phone an ex on there, they bump into me after I bump into ex so it looks like something, or their friends give them the wrong information's to influence their decisions'anything you could think of to influence the relationship in negative way happen...so when the guy they liked called..its more appealing.. I HAVE SO MANY examples greater than these but these I know some can relate to.....I love the movie so I think itst because it plants the seed FOR people to look at it again and because you have not experienced this by yourself

4122590,4,B003GAMOIW,"This Philip K Dick adaptation posits a world in which anonymous suit becladded men work tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the world continues `as per plan'.  Whose plan?  The movie doesn't go there - just says that `You call it by many names'.  These suits ensure the minutiae of life are engineered such that a lost set of keys or a spilt cup of coffee ensure you get where you should be at the right time.. or keep you from where you shouldn't be.  When by accident one of those spilt cups of coffee doesn't happen, a relationship is built between Damon and Emily Blunt, and the suits intervene - how far will he go to stay with the woman he has come to love?
The leads really convince.. Matt Damon is thoroughly likeable, and the romance never seems forced.. ironically enough, given the context.  The design of the movie has a persistent kind of art deco quality, giving it a sort of timeless quality.  The `suits' are conveyed convincingly enough by Tony Slattery (Mad Men) and Anthony Mackie, with Terence Stamp coming in for the final act.  The resolution is not quite as exciting as it thinks it is, and dodges too many of the intriguing questions such a premise suggests. The movie is not the mash-up the front cover suggests when it says ""Bourne meets Inception"".. it's not got Bourne like action or grit, and it's not mind warping like Inception, or as reliant on effects.  There is a mash-up going on here though, and the question is how well does it work.  As a romantic thriller, there is chemistry, drama and tension enough to work.  As a sci-fi, there is an intriguing concept for you to mull over and leave you with some questions, and done seamlessly enough that we don't stop to question the logic or effects.  As a hybrid of both genres, it seems on slightly shakier ground, but classy enough and with enough joie de vivre to pull through.  Above all, if you like hats, give it a watch.

Not one of the standard formula movies, although the plot has been done before, often.  Thought provoking and with some cute jokes and plot subthemes.  My wife thought it was a bit slow at the start but then warmed up to it.

No sex, no violence, and every other wasn't offensive.  Of course any movie with these qualities is bound to be a financial flop, but it's not due to the lack of a fun plot, nicely executed by a very capable cast and director.

I thought I was in for a treat, a run-from-dangerous-powers-that-no-one-else-understands-are-out-to-kill-you type movie and instead it is a metaphysical romance. I guess that's why I hadn't heard much about it since it came out and looked good. Matt Damon seems to be getting a little long-in-the-tooth for this type of role, too, although I think I would still love him in anything Bourne. He looks great, I'm just not sure his commitment was completely there ... it seemed like it was, which might have been his biggest acting feat. I dunno, maybe this was his project, but I have a feeling he realized this one wasn't going to go over all that well, especially if people were hoping for something Bourne-esque. However, I wasn't a huge fan of other metaphysical romances What Dreams May Come and Meet Joe Black, and parts of those movies linger for me, so maybe only time will tell with this one. It is a Philip K. Dick story, after all ... oh, sacrilege, that I didn't like a Philip Dick story. I guess we can't be right all the time.",1377475200,,1091,4.6875

The simple story is dressed up with touches reminiscent of various films of the past; these end up not carrying much weight relative to the basic Boy Loves Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Gets Girl classical Hollywood pattern. The Fate vs. Freewill business can easily be ignored since is just part of the ""different kind of love story"" and matters not a bit to the basic plot.

4122707,4,B003GAMOIW,"Let's be clear up front. This is a Hollywood movie with elements of thriller/action and probably primarily romance at play. Yes it is very loosely based on the Philip K. Dick story _The Adjustment Team_ but it would probably be more accurate to say inspired by.

But, it does gently poke at some larger questions on the subject of free will. And the importance of self vs. the importance of society. Though I'm not surprised which side it inevitably comes down on.

Matt Damon plays an up and coming politician who suffers a crushing defeat in an election. The adjustment bureau working to the plan drawn up by The Chairman set up a meeting with Emily Blunt a rather more freewheeling character.

Sparks fly and Damon's character is inspired to give a concession speech that essentially lines him up for future political success. They are never supposed to meet again. But they do.

And from there things spiral as the bureau takes ever stronger measures to keep these two people apart and Damon makes ever more frantic efforts to find the person he feels is the love of his life.

It's a well shot movie that switches between tension and calm fluidly. It helps that Damon and Blunt have a great on screen chemistry with each other and you can easily see these characters wanting to be together.

It has what you might call surface depth. Asking questions about whether humans can be trusted with free will. But not exploring them too deeply.

And I'm okay with that. Because it's a fun movie to watch and one that went deep into those issues would not be.

There are avenues I wish it had pursued a little further though. They ending is a classic Deus Ex Machina although perhaps more applicable than in many cases. And they carefully avoid addressing the ""What happens next?"" question. Which is the really difficult one.

Easier to stick with the love story

So no this isn't a great movie. But it's a well executed one and an entertaining one.",1371340800,,1946,4.630813953488372

Fortunately, this movie delivers beautifully and precisely what Inception should have.

If he doesn't get the so-called ""love of his life,"" then she becomes a world-famous dancer. If he gets her, then she doesn't.

Emily Blunt along side, gives an equally strong performance. The one knock on the film has to be its single mindedness.

In this compelling, well crafted film, Matt Damon, as David Norris, is an up-and-coming politician - a Hollywood liberal democrat of course - who has been predestined by the Chairman and controlled by Adjustment Bureau caseworkers to accomplish bigger and better things...to include the penultimate goal of many politicians - the Presidency. He meets a young woman - Emily Blunt as Elise Sellas - after losing his first Senate race, who encourages him to be honest in his campaigning. That meeting is also planned by the Adjustment Bureau; but Elise and David fall in love...and that is not in the Bureau's plans. Elise's destiny is to be a great dancer and her chances will be diminished if she and David become a couple; and David's chances for the presidency will be ruined. That will set the stage for what is a beautiful love story, combined w/some excellent sci/fi...fiction it may be, but if you believe in religious fate, it is altogether plausible. Blunt and Damon have superb on-screen chemistry and both deliver outstanding performances. Damon, of course, is the veteran of many such performances; and while Blunt is considered an up-and-comer by comparison, she also has some superb performances on her resume...""The Young Victoria"", The Devil Wears Prada"", etc. Anthony Mackie, John Slattery and Terence Stamp also deliver excellent performances as Bureau caseworkers.

Right off the bat, I've never seen a screenplay more outright derivative of other far better films -- I'll let YOU reckon which ones. (It might be a fun game!) Toward the end I kept saying to myself: Please, PLEASE don't make this be like The Graduate! (LOL)

Also, a major annoyance was the sheer number of overtly deliberate contrivances to ""adjust"" the narrative and give our hero a possible out. C'mon people, a little subtlety goes a long way. Still, the ending was unexpected and somewhat satisfying and Matt Damon sold his character well enough, yet this could have been SO much better. (sigh)",1361145600,,748,4.666666666666667

Well worth the watch. While the story has familiar romance and hero tones, the paradigm of the movie is so unique that it all feels fresh.  I can think of no movie to compare it to.

4122830,3,B003GAMOIW,"SciFi?  This is a Matt Damon film, which means it strives to be a thinking mans Hollywood entertainment.  That translates to giving what is essentially God, and the Angels, new corporate working titles, like The Chairman, and The Adjustment Bureau.  And they wear retro-cool clothes out of ""Men In Black"", no robes and sandals.  No wings, either, but they've got doors.

So God, I mean the Chairman, has a plan.  The Plan.  But the Plan changes every now and then, no one knows why, and apparently Damon and Blunt were to have met and fallen in love, but now the Plan has changed and that isn't in the works.  One of Angels, I mean the Adjusters, is still on Suburban time though, and doesn't get his butt where it's supposed to be, so when Damon spills his coffee, it's on Blunt, not in Washington Square.

Now it turns out, when this sort of thing happens, the Angels, I mean Adjusters, come in and basically clean it up by wiping out everyone's memory, no harm done.  Except when someone like Damon's character comes along, and sees too much, and then they simply confess and warn him about what will happen if he doesn't get with the program.

Of course, Damon's character does not get with the program, and it turns out that if you can reach God, I mean the Chairman...

Terry Gilliam and much of Monty Python did a low-brow (and low budget) version of this back in the eighties with ""Time Bandits"" where a marauding group of also-not-called-angels, with God's Plan, drop through its holes and loot history, from Napoleon to the sinking Titanic, with, as it turns out, God following them to fix the holes.  Hired hackers as we'd call them today.

Both are entertaining films, I think I'd prefer ""Time Bandits"" as it doesn't go to quite the pretense of not being able to say what it's characters are, but then again, look at how many folks saw this film as SciFi.  Lotta KoolAid going 'round...",1359676800,,1898,4.557522123893805

I gotta say that I do enjoyed watching it. I think this film did an okay job in presenting our reality, dynamics of our lives, and an illusion of free will. It was mainly interesting to see these MIH (Men-in-Hats) making sure that certain individuals are doing as according to ""The Plan,"" especially the one who is a politician (thus gives a suggestive of politicians being puppets of higher powers, well duh, not the first movie on this).

The one scene that interests me was where David and Elise is at a restaurant and MIH guys were trying to make several changes to avoid having David and Elise to experience their ""Kiss."" I was half-expecting a sense of ""Dj vu"" to show up in this scene (where a change in program to occur like ""The Matrix"" film) but what did happened was that these ""obstacles"" was placed on them, to instill an increased ""sense of urgency"" in both of them as a result of the changes, to ""nudge"" them to go to their ""fixed"" directions. Also I really thought the ""door"" thing was very cool.

FREE WILL -- mankind was given it and proved again and again we were not mature enough to be left on our own, we still needed babysitters to keep us out of trouble.  Based on the state our world is now in, I found this concept  believable and also a bit comforting.
The story was light hearted and easy to follow, not slow to get started, just fast paced enough to not bog down, yet not feel rushed, it was a relaxing science fiction movie - again a rare quality for this genre.  Simple but effective special affects and concepts.  Enough character development to care what happens to most of them.
What I most enjoyed was the chemistry between the two lead actors, which I give credit to good writing & good acting.  But I very much got a sense the two actors very likely developed a platonic friendship while filming.  The chemistry felt that real, with their witty banter and how they instantly clicked.  We've all had that happen in our lives, usually that person ends up being a long standing close friend, and if we're lucky, they end up our lover, our partner as well.

Background

I must admit: somehow I ""missed"" this movie when it originally played in theaters. In fact, I had never even heard of it until I was at the department store, back in the summer, and the film's dvd caught my eye. My initial thought was, ""How was this a straight-to-dvd film considering the star power headlining it?""

That just goes to show you how much (or not so much) I know.

As I stated, the dvd case/film poster caught my eye. I liked the shot of the two leads, hand in hand, on the run from...well, I had no idea...but I wanted to find out. I also could not get over just how gorgeous Emily Blunt looked. Now, please do not misunderstand me, I have been well aware of her ever since first seeing her in The Devil Wears Prada, and more recently in The Young Victoria (a very good film you also should check out). But, I had never seen her look this stunning. I was like, wow....

I hope thalia989 doesn't read that.

Ironically, however, as anxious as I was to check out the movie (yes, I purchased it on the spot), I didn't get around to viewing it until recently...and am only now getting around to reviewing it. It is a great movie, and one you should definitely check out.

The Adjustment Bureau

Directed by George Nolfi, and based on the short story, Adjustment Team, by science-fiction author Phillip K. Dick (whose literary works have been ""converted"" into theatrical films such as Total Recall, and the incomparable science-fiction masterpiece, Blade Runner), The Adjustment Bureau is, on its surface, a romantic, roller-coaster ride of an action thriller featuring two young lovers who want, more than anything else in the world, to be together...they just happen to have everything...and I do mean everything, working against them.

Going a bit deeper, ok, a lot more deeper, themes such as pre-destination, free will, and The Enlightenment permeate the entire movie...which is about a young, ""rock-star"" New York Congressman, David Norris (Matt Damon), and his current bid to run for the United States Senate (a not-so-coincedental parallel to President Barack Obama in 2004). At a speech/fund-raiser, David steps into the men's room to catch a breather and gather his thoughts. Unbeknownst to David (but not for long) also hiding in the bathroom...for ostensibly the same reasons is Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). David, immediately attracted to her (and vice-versa) asks her what she is doing in he men's room. She replies that she is ""hiding"" from security because ""I just crashed a wedding."" David says that ""I didn't know people still did that,"" and quickly, all of the small talk leads to a passionate, lingering  kiss. It is ""out-of-the-blue,"" yet works beautifully. As a viewer, not only did it not surprise me, it made perfect sense (more on this later). Elise, however, abruptly states she has to go and David, disappointed but inspired, goes back out to the floor and makes a speech that all but guarantees his election.

A few weeks later, he has a chance encounter with Elise on an AM  bus and gets her phone number. However, David has to commit her number to memory as the feisty Elise accidentally (or, on purpose?) drops his cell phone into his cup of coffee.

This is where things really start to get weird.

David arrives at his office, and, well...I refuse to tell you what happens here, but let's just say that there are a group of men, splendidly sartorially attired--which includes hats (hint, hint)--and they have the ability to transport themselves through time and space. It may sound silly, but trust me, it isn't. They also have a message for David: he is--very soon--going to be President of the United States, and a great president at that.

One more thing: he also better stay away from Elise and have no more contact with her. Even worse, if he tells her--or anyone else--about this meeting, and its revelations, they will....

....I am not giving away anything else about this movie's plot. It would be a crime if I spoiled it for you...so I won't. I will tell you that from this point forward you will have completely, as the movie's viewer, entered a mad, alternate fantasy world that will take you on a frantically-paced run as you follow David and Elise's story, all throughout it. You will also stay on the edge of your seat rooting for these two characters to somehow find a way to be together...all the time hoping that, by the movie's end, that you won't be disappointed.

So, go see the movie to find out how all of this is going to play out! I am not saying anything else about its story. However, I will talk about...

...A Few More Things That I Liked

* The chemistry between the two leads, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. I still cannot get over just how strong their said chemistry was. Going into this, I had no idea what the movie was about or what to even  expect...but, from their first encounter on, these two actors equally radiate the screen--and show us exactly what great acting is all about. I am not usually interested in strictly romantic films--however, from their aforementioned first ""chance"" meeting in the men's room, and all throughout the film, I found myself strongly wanting the two to be together by movie's end in a way that reminded me of James Stewart and Kim Novak in Vertigo. Just two great performances.

* Emily Blunt. She completely radiates the screen as Elise. Now granted, I am attracted to ""arty-type"" girls to begin with, but wow...her role as a feisty, completely self-assured, free-spirited ballet dancer just captivated me. And, did I mention she looks gorgeous?

Side note: I have wondered if my ""captivation"" is due to the fact I also (big mrroland secret here) would like to dance, myself, if I could (being a 6'4"", 220 lbs. klutz doesn't lend itself very well to dancing).

* The movie's supporting cast. No matter how good a movie's leads are, it cannot be a great film unless they are surrounding by an exceptional cast. This is certainly the case here as Michael Kelly, Anthony Mackie, John Slattery and (another ""incomparable"") Terence Stamp all turn in their usual fine performances. There is one scene in particular with Mr. Stamp that I especially noted: After a romantic interlude between David and Elise, they lie in bed asleep...with Terence Stamp's character, Thompson, unbeknownst to them, gazing down hauntingly at them. A great, yet (more than a bit) eerie, visual.

* The movie's pacing. What can I say about this...other than everything is done right. Director George Nolfi expertly sets up the first meeting between our two leads, then continues to let the movie play out at a perfect pace...right up to the film's climax. The movie's action never feels rushed, yet the suspense level is on ""High"" throughout the film. It never lets up. Another great job.

* I also very much enjoyed the movie's score. It is composed by Thomas Newman (The Shawshank Redemption, American Beauty) and lends itself well to the movie's suspense, haunting visuals and pacing. In short, it does what it is supposed to do: it helps make the movie great.

* Finally, I appreciate the fact that, despite Matt Damon's character being a politician, the movie mostly avoids politics and agenda and instead concentrates on storytelling. I watch movies purely for entertainment and escapism, and do not want to be ""preached"" to--even if I agree with what they are ""preaching."" This movie, thankfully--and to its credit, leaves the politics ""at home.""

The DVD

Extras include:

* Deleted and Extended Scenes. There is no ""special edition"" present where these extra scenes are inserted seamlessly into the actual movie, but they do add to your viewing enjoyment and better understanding of this movie's story--and just what exactly the film's director and producers were trying to say.

* Three Featurettes: Leaping Through New York, Destined To Be and Becoming Elise.

Leaping Through New York is a brief (7:37) look at the making of the film, in particular, how they achieved the ""teleporting"" special effects. Lots of making-of footage--shot on location in The City--is also shown, with Matt Damon summing it all up by saying visually, ""the movie is a love letter to New York.""

Destined To Be is a short (4:52) featurette that discusses the movie's theme of fate versus free will, with both leads discussing how far (are) their characters willing to go to be together--and what happens when you defy fate, itself.

Becoming Elise (7:07)--yes, this was of great interest to me. It discusses Emily Blunt's preparation for her role of Elise (as a dancer) and describes the dance training (and diet) she underwent as she ""became"" the character of Elise. I was amazed at just how much dance training she went through, especially considering that her on-screen ""dance time,"" by comparison, is not very long at all.

* Lastly, we get an excellent commentary from Director George Nolfi. This, as film commentaries go, is outstanding. He discusses special effects; the movie's shooting in and around NYC; the chemistry between the film's two leads; (and) the movie's themes. This is arguably the best film commentary I have ever heard (definitely on my short list) and a ""must-listen"" for all fans of this movie.

So, in conclusion

I (easily) rate this film with five very strong stars. Along with The Avengers, this was the best movie I have seen this year (2012). It is so strange: I had never heard of this movie when it was in development, nor when it was playing in the theaters. It was only sheer chance that I happened upon it on a lazy Friday afternoon. I am just so very glad I did finally see it--and I have to ask myself two questions:

* How did I not notice--considering it grossed $127,869,379 dollars worldwide--this film (much) earlier?

* Considering my ignorance of this film's existence, how exactly did I ever manage to notice this film at all--could it have been...fate?

Thank you for reading.

The story follows an elite mechanic/hitman as he weaves through deception and retribution while mentoring the son (played excellently by Foster) of his former friend and boss (Sutherland). Foster was the reason I watched this and have been a fan of his since 11:14; itself an overlooked but good film. Above all of the usual Statham faces, inept bad guys, great stunts and token eye candy, Foster actually carries this film for me and proves himself again.

4122949,5,B003GAMOIW,"""Some things are meant to be."" Sure, you've heard that phrase before, but just who was it that meant them to be? And how will that be enforced?

This brilliant movie starts by assuming an answer that second question: The Adjustment Bureau makes sure things turn out according to The Plan. David Norris (Matt Damon's outstandingly played character) encounters a dancer (portrayed beautifully by Emily Blunt), and mutual infatuation strikes in a heartbeat. Their affection is not part of The Plan, however. It must be stopped. Then, in an unrelated thread of the story, Norris discovers the Bureau's workings.

Soon enough, they're working against him. This keeps a more credible tone than most action movies - no block-buster stunts, no guns, no explosions. Special effects appear in a very few places, neatly done but with a light touch that I appreciate. All that lets the raw characters come through, a Kafka-like sense of vast and unseen powers. Instead of submitting to the faceless forces, however, Damon and Blunt confront them. Although that familiar foreboding echoes many other paranoid fantasy movies, the heroes' determination against those forces keeps the story fresh. I recommend this one highly.

4122953,3,B003GAMOIW,"It's a hollywood story.

David was a congressman at first, but he lost the election due to his scandal.

He hadn't shown how he felt but he was depressed as he couldn't win.

and when he was rehearsing his speech for his supporters alone in the bathroom at the Hotel. He met Elise.

They talked and kissed. but his friend, Charlie interrupted them to notice that it was the time that he should give a speech.
They got to apart soon, but they both seem to fall in love with each other.
After he met her, David gave supporters a arresting speech.

He lost his job as a congressman, but Charlie gave him a job.
It was the first day that David goes to his office David saw Elise again while commuting
and at Charlie's office, he saw someones we mustnt's know due to Harry's fail (both of then).

They are members of the adjustment beaureu that control that people would have fate as they should be.
Harry is the one of them. He is really nice guy,he came to see David to explain who we are and what we're doing,and suggested David to give up seeing Elise as he emphasized with David.

David tries to see her again for three years, he hadn't given up. And he made it.

Elise once had already engaged with a guy , kind of her co-worker in the three years, but she broke up with him,
as she also couldn't forget about David although she just only met and kissed him.

David mustn't see her again as long as the fate that the Adjustment beaureu has.
After David saw Elise, The adjustment beaureu noticed that David had off track.

Some of the members of it began to try him to never see her again with their power like magic.
But this time, David won. He could see her again.

David went to the club with her.
After that he confessed that his entire family passed away when he was still young.
After that... you know? Elise came to his baby.

But still the beaureu tries to break them up continuelly.
Thompson twisted Elise's ankle with using the magic when she's working, to persuade David giving up.
David took Elise to the hospital, but he left her there as Thompson convinced him.

Elise was shocked to be left by David at the hospital without saying any.
After about a year she re-engaged with the  same guy.
When David has been somewhere for speech for the election camgpain, Charlie showed him the paper that Elise engaged.

It seemed to lit David's match again. At the time Harry appeared as David's supporter.
The day that Elise and her fiance submit the marriage paper, David tried to see her to stop getting married to him.

The many members of the Adjustment beaureu chased him and tried to interrupt him so hard.
But tnanks for Harry's help, David could see Elise just before their turn to submit.

But the members are on the way. David ran with her with using a kind of magic with something borrowed by Harry. Elise was panicking, when she nearly submitted the paper with an other guy David appeared in front of her.
That's enought to upset her. Furthermore she's got to face the unrealistic world and was chased by unfamiliar guys.

David decided to explain a little what it's going on and persuaded Elise that they would enter the building of the adjustment beareu to see the president to ask him to allow them to be together.
She couldn't understand her situation yet, but made a decision to be with David.

But they couldn't find him and they were sorounded by the member who were chasing them.
Suddenly they were gone and Tompson showed up....
Hollywood ending was coming with an envelope that was brought by Harrry.

I couldn't feel it pasts ""three years"" since the first time they met when they saw again.
If they had changed their hairstyles or something like it, maybe I could have done.
I couldn't caught David's struggling or sad emotion stemming from their all family died when he was young.
He should have had his eyes look like Keanu.
If he showed sad from his eyes or somthing or add some scenes that he plays with his family
maybe I could have emphasized with him. But I couldn't. This story is going too fast to catch my heart.
I even felt his background shouldn't be so as David seems to be raised in happy family as far as my opinion.
My favorite is Anthony(Harry) he's so cute and I like his way of speeking. so sweet.

4122957,3,B003GAMOIW,"`The Adjustment Bureau' is one of those movies that works so long as you don't try and take it too seriously.  Once you start to break apart the film's elements, it becomes a bizarrely campy mess and it starts to lean on the `stupid' side of things.  The performances by Damon and Blunt are great and they go a long way to making this premise work, but unlike most film adaptations of Philip K. Dick's work, `The Adjustment Bureau' feels kind of corny.

The Bureau itself is an obvious figurative peak at God and his angels poking around at the fate or `free will' of us humans.  The way they are depicted is rather shallow and almost laughable (their introduction on the rooftop made me laugh) and the film really fails to flesh them out, despite trying to (especially with the Harry character).  The film plods along rather well and then dives into lunacy when the final ten minutes roll around and director George Nolfi slams his foot on the gas pedal and the film steamrolls to its finale.  The `Monster's Inc.' type door escapes can be pretty cool (and the special effects are top notch) but they also get rather redundant.  The love story is underdeveloped (love at first site isn't always the most logical plot point) and overall this film winds up being a missed opportunity.  Add to the mix the ridiculous `hat' idea and you have a film that flirts with a depth it isn't willing to embrace.  Instead, it meanders at a decently entertaining action thriller with a charismatic lead performance.",1341532800,3,1501,4.633962264150943

Wonderful story, to be sure.

4122975,3,B003GAMOIW,"Being a science fiction fan, I was intrigued by the premise of The Adjustment Bureau. The basic idea, that a shadow group is manipulating people according to their own plan or design, is not new in the sci fi genre (The Matrix, Inception, and Dark City are the first to mind). Or in political thrillers like The Manchurian Candidate. In this story, Matt Damon plays a politician, David Norris, who has just failed to win a senate seat from the great state of New York. He has a chance encounter with Emily Blunt's character, Elise, in the men's room of the hotel where he's about to give his concession speech. She inspires him to give a great, off-the-cuff speech about the artificiality of political campaigning and how he won't quit politics. He is presented as the quintessential honest politician. He's also the quintessential brash youth, who has gotten into a barroom brawl and other shenanigans that cost him the election.

It turns out the titular Adjustment Bureau has been manipulating his life all along, including providing the ""chance"" encounter in the bathroom. Their plans are not immediately clear, other than they want him to be successful ultimately in politics. And they don't want he and Elise to meet again. They are a charming couple. Damon and Blunt have nice chemistry and the characters are well drawn enough to make the viewer root for them.

Unfortunately, the Bureau itself is a bit of a let down. For all its seemingly omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience, is really rather inept, random, and unfocused. When people don't follow the Bureau's plans, they make little shifts (like spilling coffee to stop someone meeting) to get people to choose freely according to their plan. More than once in the movie, the Bureau guys miss their preplanned changes through incompetence or because they might interfere too much. While you certainly don't want overly competent or successful villains, their flaws and bumbles are so manifold, it's hard to believe they really are as sinister as they seem. When David first discovers that the Bureau exists and is altering people, there's no explanation how he can see the Bureau while all the ""normal"" people are frozen in time. Later, David challenges one of the Bureau's men on why they are keeping David and Elise apart. The guy has nothing to say in his own defense and David concludes that he doesn't know why. The guy is just following orders. Even when he talks to higher ups, the explanation makes little sense. The movie doesn't present the Bureau as really having its act together. They are just too ill defined and too easy to beat.

It all seems a bit nonsensical, which made the movie disappointing for me. Especially since it is based on a Philip K. Dick story. I haven't read any of his books, but most of the movies based on his books (like Blade Runner, Minority Report, A Scanner Darkly, etc.) are interesting and intelligent. This movie promises to be both but does not deliver on either.",1339372800,,2977,4.833333333333333

Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's characters are thrown together and torn apart, all according to a divine master plan.  Can this master plan be altered?  The characters jump through literal hoops to be together despite supernatural forces contriving one scheme after another to keep them separated.

According to this movie, free will is an illusion.  Keep in mind that so many belief systems are based on the premise of free will.  Yet while the Adjustment Bureau won't let us choose our life partner, we are free to decide which brand of toothpaste we want.  I had to laugh and can completely relate to this theme.  So many times I've felt like I do not have complete free will.  There have been times when words I hadn't even thought popped out of my mouth, as though the words were foisted by a ventriloquist.  Another time I felt supernaturally manhandled when I momentarily lost control of my balance and equilibrium (medically, postural hypotension, though it felt more like untoward supernatural possession).  I've also had two chemical imbalances when I was not myself for a period of time and do not know the extent of ""free will"" that I experienced during those times.

I personally am confused about the whole ""free will"" concept and have come to the conclusion that we have ""limited"" free will.  It's as though we are to a certain degree puppets being puppeteered by a master puppeteer, a.k.a. the ""Adjustment Bureau.""",1334707200,,1513,4.817829457364341

4123024,5,B003GAMOIW,"An excellent Philip K. Dick adaptation that comes off as neither too cerebral nor too wantonly action-heavy. Matt Damon slides into the role of a brash, combustible young politician in the mold of JFK, whose chance meeting with his dream girl sets off a chain reaction that alters his perception of the world at large. Shortly afterwards he stumbles across the delegates of a shadow agency, who freeze time and bend reality to tinker with the thoughts and feelings of the population, all in the name of a precise global timeline. Damon, naturally, is immune to their tricks and bolts from the scene. As a science fiction twist on the cat and mouse game, it's a blast of fresh air with an admirable sense of restraint. In a perfect world these agents would do their jobs without being noticed at all, so their methods consist of a series of slick, downplayed visual tricks and slight tweaks to the natural order. That sensibility works for their own purposes, but also for the film's: the special effects are equally moderate, and as a result more believable. Damon and Emily Blunt click right away as a duo, so well in fact that it's no challenge at all to root for them from the get-go, and the agency itself is far from the black-and-white, good-versus-evil gang of naughty henchmen you might expect. A tense, creative adventure with perhaps a tad too much sentimentality, it's a raging, surprising, success.",1332201600,,1410,4.782786885245901

In this amalgamation, Matt Damon plays politician David Norris who has just suffered a crushing defeat as a result of his impetuousness.  While planning his concession speech in a bathroom, he has a star-crossed meeting with a ballerina named Elise (Emily Blunt).  The resulting affair uncovers what is presumed to be the Adjustment Bureau, a team of caretaker angels who control the timeline of humanity's decisions so what is supposed to occur actually takes place.

Damon and Blunt make a good protagonist couple.  The connection between leads is fairly convincing.  It's easy to perceive they were divined for one another.  Which is an accomplishment considering the lukewarm vibe exuded the last time he was supposed to be romantically linked to a brunette with a British accent.  Supporting actors like the always magnificent Terrance Stamp - who was interestingly enough in the movie Wanted, which shares many similarities with this film - fill out the gray more than adequately.  A few pseudo-celebrities and politicians show up as themselves.  They could have been left out.

The major failings of this film revolve around the brief explanation of the caretakers, their abilities and responsibilities, and why David and Elise are doomed to failure with one another.  Especially since the plan is apparently changeable.  Not to mention why one of the caretakers would ever help David be with Elise.  Way too many missing plot pieces.

Action is minimal, but there is a classic running sequence that would make Tom Cruise jealous.  In fact, intensity is lacking as well; the second act just takes way too long to get to the meat of the story.

Decent Matt Damon vehicle about overcoming odds, changing destiny, and finding true love, but it's probably not a must see.",1331942400,13,2294,6.186119873817034

I found this movie to be an inspirational tribute to the ""one God and Father of all, who is above all and in all"" as well as being a good reminder that the sovereignty of God is unlimited. The universe was not inevitable. It is neither an accident nor some self-existent entity of ethereal proportions exploding upon the empty stage of nebular nothingness. The universe is a work of creation and is therefore wholly subject to the will of the Creator. So it is no mere poetic expression that exclaims: ""The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof."" ""He removes kings and sets up kings."" ""The Most Highs rule in the kingdoms of men."" In the affairs of the hearts of men and women, the Universal Father (better known as GOD) may not always have His way but in the conduct and destiny of a planet, the divine plan prevails...the eternal purpose of wisdom and love triumphs! And unlike any documentary that may have attempted to encapsulate portions of these philosophical mysteries in a few condensed scenes featuring talking heads that move their lips in a rapid succession of lingual fireworks but who fail to say anything spiritually significant, this fun-filled flick was supremely entertaining in addition to being a cinematic fountain of intellectual fascination and cosmic enlightenment.",1331251200,2,1311,4.9366515837104075
4123027,4,B003GAMOIW,"The Adjustment Bureau, directed by George Nolfi and starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, is something of a rarity - a romance movie within a sci-fi setting that actually works. The reason for this is that while The Adjustment Bureau is nominally based on a short story - ""The Adjustment Team"" - by Philip K. Dick, at its heart its true roots are to be found in Michael Powell's 1946 romantic fantasy film Stairway To Heaven (also known by its original UK title A Matter Of Life And Death), where two people who meet by chance and fall in love must deal with divine powers bent on seperating them.

A rising young New York politician, David Norris (Matt Damon), on election night of his first senate bid, has a chance meeting with a young dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) that changes his life. But unfortunately he comes away from the encounter with only her first name and nothing else, leaving him no way of finding her. One morning, a short time later, we become aware that a group of men, all wearing hats, seem to be taking a strange interest in Norris. One of them, who goes by the name of Harry (Anthony Mackie), has been given the strange assignment of making sure Norris spills his coffee on himself by 7:05AM. Things, however, do not go as planned, and as a result, two things happen: (1) Norris runs into Elise on the bus, this time getting her phone number, and (2) Norris inadvertently stumbles across the existence of the Men In Hats in the act of manipulating events in his life. And is told by them that he must never reveal what he has learned to anyone, and that he must never see Elise again because it's not part of their plan for him. And because seeing her will not only ruin their plans for him, it'll ruin the bright future they have planned for her as well.

The cast is excellent and is a large part of what makes The Adjustment Bureau work. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt project a believable chemistry of two people who from the first moment know they were always meant to be together. John Slattery (best known from TV's Mad Men) is perfect as Richardson, the officious leader of the team of agents managing Norris' life. Terrence Stamp is marvelous as always as Thompson, the hard-nosed trouble shooter nicknamed ""The Hammer"" who is brought in when things really go awry. But it is Anthony Mackie who gives the movie a lot of its heart as Harry, the low-key agent with doubts about the plan. Mackie never raises his voice, never lets Harry's feelings show on his face, but conveys everything with his subtly expressive eyes.

There are also a host of cameos of public figures from the political and media arenas, meant I suppose to make things more realistic, but in truth they're incidental, particularly in a film like this where a good deal of suspension of disbelief is necessary. Still, some people will have fun seeing how many they can spot. I counted at least eight.

As enjoyable as The Adjustment Bureau is, it does require certain periodic suspensions of disbelief which I cannot dwell on without revealing certain parts of the plot. And while it does at least toy with questions of free-will vs predestined fate, in the end it is a romance story and does opt for the ending that most easily satisfies. It might have been a deeper, more complex movie if Nolfi had had Norris make a less conventional choice, either choosing to stay with the plan the Men In Hats have laid out for him, giving up love for career, or sacrificing his own chance at happiness so that Elise can have the grand career he knows is awaiting her.

Anyone who has seen Stairway To Heaven will instinctively know how this all turns out. Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good love-conquers-all romance story set in a very different reality from the one we know.",1330214400,2,3779,4.559646539027982

Both leads do effective jobs in their roles with Matt Damon as a strong action lead and the Emily Blunt character as a lovely and vulnerable ballerina.

As others have pointed out, the move is taken from a short story by Philip K. Dick whose writing career was unfortunately cut short by his untimely death. Dick was noted for his creative approach to storytelling and this story is one of those. It just happens to tread on some thin ice when it challenges the notion of free will, a sacred cow for those who are determined to believe they are the captains of their own fate; it becomes rather polarizing in that regard.

4123034,2,B003GAMOIW,"Matt Damon is a terrific actor and he's starred in a wide range of exceptional movies.

THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU ain't one of them.

This eclectic hodge-podge of a mess never finds its footing or its message; Damon plays an up and coming Congressman with limitless potential, yet when he falls in love by a chance encounter with a dancer (Emily Blunt) he suddenly finds mysterious obstacles thrown onto his path to keep him from seeing her again.  And these aren't run-of-the-mill obstacles, by golly, these are the shenanigans of the Adjustment Bureau, metaphysical G-Men who pop out of doors (wormholes) throughout Brooklyn and Manhattan to create nonsensical mischief.  Why?  Because, of course, the young Congressman will not stay true to 'The Plan' (and the Bureau, with its 'administrator', has high aspirations for the young pol, of course) if he spends his life with the girl of his dreams.  So Damon's character, once the Bureau lets him in on their secret (at the risk of being deprogrammed, mind you), must decide whether to follow said Plan or risk it all with the girl.  What ensues is, more or less, one chase scene after another, ad nauseum.

As we get deeper into the film, it's readily apparent even the Bureau members (all sporting hats, which allows them to pass in and out of the wormholes) aren't sure of their powers; accordingly THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is confusing, convoluted, uneven, rambling, nonsensical, banal, and trite.  And those are its good points.  Even the extremely talented Terence Stamp makes an appearance as one of the Bureau's top hombres; naturally he lectures Damon's character as to why humans are no longer allowed free will:  because, when the Bureau has allowed free will, mankind gave itself the Dark Ages, world wars, near nuclear extinction, yada yada yada.  It was so superficial and hokey I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry.  So I did both.  Neither facilitated any relief from THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU.  I need a fedora and a couple of doors myself to get away from this gobbler.

The story is about David Norris (Matt Damon) , a young and popular congressman, who one day meets a beautiful and mysterious woman (Emily Blunt) and falls head-over-heels for her, only to discover that there are strange circumstances that arise to keep them apart.
Matt Damon and Emily Blunt's on-screen chemistry is awesome. Both played their characters really well and both seemed to play off of each other even better. If nothing else draws you into this movie, the relationship between these two will. Matt Damon is just an awesome actor. Period.
As with most other Philip Dick stories, the plotline is very mind-bending and supernatural. The story progresses extremely well and leads up to a satisfying climax. Many people were disengaged by the conclusion of the film, and while I thought that it could have been solved better, I was still contented with how it ended and enjoyed the ride getting there. The content could have been delved into a little further and I would have liked to know more about what happened to some of the other characters in the film, but there was nothing that put me off in this film. It was a fun flick and I recommend it if you're in the mood for a good thriller.

4123065,2,B003GAMOIW,"Based on a Phil Dick story, this is a film brought to life by credible performances by Matt Damon (as the ambitious young NY politician David Norris),  the gorgeous Emily Blunt (as Elise, the elusive beauty/dancer whom David meets by happenstance and pursues despite all odds and mishaps), and John Slattery (who can do no wrong in any role as he again doesn't disappoint as the Adjustment Bureau's mid-management enforcer Richardson).

The gist of the story is whether we have free will or not. The film starts with a stark ""NO"" for an answer. David thinks otherwise, so he needs a lesson and his lesson is delivered in the form of a nightmarish visit from the film-noir cast of the Adjustment Bureau (all wearing fedora hats) and the admonition that David can't say a word of what he has seen to anybody, or else... his brain will be reset, and his mind will be wiped out. If the Bureau is flushed out to the public domain, the gig will be up. (So can the Bureau control everything but the occasional indiscretion of its victims? Isn't that a contradiction in terms?)

What's more, the Bureau also forbids David to continue his relationship with Elise since she has a different fate and his rising success as a young politician is not commensurate with her success as a dancer in a modern dance company. He is made to understand that his love for her will have a very high cost if he owns up to it, period. He'd better let go of her, right away. Like yesterday.

So how does the Bureau enforce its mandate over David's life? By assigning ""case officers"" to David and arranging ""little accidents"" of daily life which are anything but. The next time you spill coffee on yourself while riding public transportation you can believe that it's an accident, or that the Bureau is earning its pay.

However, at the end the Bureau relents and throws in the towel because they are impressed with the risks David take to be with Elise. So instead of David ""seeing the light"" and giving in, the Bureau is the one who give him a break since they're impressed by the love David and Elise have for one another.

Yet, after all is said and done, the story remains as unconvincing and contrived at the end of it as it was in the beginning. For some reason I couldn't suspend my disbelief all throughout the film. I kept repeating to myself ""there is no way this is true or can ever happen the way the director says it does!"" For some reason I could not lose myself in this film which is necessary for a seamless movie experience. Which makes me wonder: would I enjoy The Matrix, once upon a time my all-time favorite sci-fi flick, if I go back now and watch it again? Have my sense of ""poetic illusion"" dried up so much that I can's lay down my critical blowtorch aside and just allow for entertainment's sake that the Adjustment Bureau is nothing more than a work of fiction?

""There Will Be Blood"" is a well made movie with a powerful performance by the lead actor, however, when the movie ends, it's a let down. ""There Will Be Blood"" lacked thematic originality. Then there are movies that are not overly innovative from a production standpoint, however, are powerful thematically. ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is this kind of movie. The journey of the main characters was interesting, but, whenever the narrative lines converge at the end with a chase scene - we've seen this format many times. It's this movie's theme where its real beauty is revealed. Having the courage and the determination to set your own course in life despite society's rules is this movie's true allegorical meaning. Social psychologists call them introjects. And they are instilled in us from the day we are born. By our parents first, our communities, our government. Introjects are so powerful that we don't realize, at times, we are being controlled by them. When a student, whose love is art, decides to major in business because our society dictates business is more practical and socially acceptable, this is an introject. The Adjustment Bureau represents everything citizens do because of our societal memberships that go against our truest self. This is this movie's message. And a powerful message it is. Despite the movie's powerful theme, this movie grossed less than 70 million domestically. Perhaps the story's plot did not raise the stakes quite high enough. To give up the presidency of the US at a time of tremendous national economic flux does not seem like a difficult choice to make. Citizens have not been terribly happy with the current president of the US or his predecessor. In this day and time, citizens would easily chose love over a perceived failure of national leadership. Perhaps this is the reason the movie didn't fair well at the box office. The decision to chose love over politics made by the main character (Matt Damon) is not a difficult one to make in this day and time. Despite this inconsistency, there is still something extremely alluring and genuine about this movie that transcends its narrative flaws. It's a message of hope and optimism against all odds that is this movie's promise. This message of hope, optimism and confidence is surely not coming from Washington DC.

Cain married a woman and founded an entire city given his long lifespan, which God began to reduce in humanity at various intervals of time, as stated in the bible.

These are the people that called on God for salvation and refuge, see Isaiah 63-65, and vowed to set aside their alien gods in exchange for life and protection thru God. Especially Isaiah 63:19 We have long being like those whom you do not rule, like those not called by your name.

These are the men that existed outside of paradise in times given like 2 Esdras 10:45. 3000 years of time before ANY OFFERING was offered in it.

Now as end times approach, we realize how far we are straying from the path of our salvation and redemption as defined in narrow terms by God. Example, our soul, the soul of man rationalizes the ""common sense"" of same sex unions and argues the right to even use the biblical name and ritual blessings of marriage, a concept defined and given to us by God in exchange for His protection and His way.

(Note: I am not judging these people, I know some wonderful people, it's just I HAVE NO RIGHT TO JUDGE GOD by teaching my children its acceptable to redefine God's parameters of marriage to suit our mortal human liking.) Civil union is man made and excellent for contractual and legal reasons, it suits it's purpose. Marriage is God defined and it's ritual is for those who obey God's definitions.

If you have read all of 2 Esdras, then you will understand  the angel Uriel explanation of the three parts within us, the soul of man, the spirit, and in the middle is the mind which is the visual interpreter. The mind is the holographic dream machine, the trickster, or the inner eye that enables the spirit within us to grow and change. (2 Esdras 5:22).

Angel Uriel explains we have to earn our spiritual passage to leave earth and join God in His new world. This lifetime of mortality is a CONTEST for our soul of man to grow because it is limited (2Esdras 4), and we must enlarge our spirit through understanding first,  and this understanding comes thru the mind which acts as interpreter.
2Esdras 7:14 ..unless the living pass thru the difficult and futile experiences, they can never receive those things that have been reserved for them.
2Esdras 7:50 For this reason the Most High has made not one world but two.
2Esdras 7 57 127 this is the significance of the contest that all who are born on earth shall wage.

This movie theme explores the concept of DIVINE INTERVENTION thru 'ANGELS' - not helpful ones but forceful men in black suits who like biblical angels also admit they do not know God's plan in it's entirety.

It's disgusting in that it also ARGUES:

1) the SOUL OF MAN is forced to accept divine intervention. (The strange office scene with mind altering wands)
2) Exploiting the concept of undying love, the soul of man is entitled free will to redefine eternal happiness, and that if only we try hard enough God will relent in giving us an eternal Earth where we can incorporate our own chosen version of eternal happiness.

Take note there is also only ONE suited angel who decides to help man force God to change His plan.

Yet God has already given this freedom, and in Isaiah 65:17 God creates a new heaven and earth Reserved for those who accepted His challenge of spiritual growth and reform in the mortal Life of flesh,  and in Isaiah 66:24 agrees the soul of man shall continue, their worm shall not die. It's just those who did not want to accept His enlightenment will not be relocated to His new heaven and earth.

The freedom of choice was always... and has always been ours. It's just we must know that this earth will be destroyed, the sun and the moon humbled, read 2 Esdras and Revelations. And As the Spirit never dies, and we must choose in what world we would like our spirit to pursue in.

2Esdras 7:21 The Lord strictly commanded those who came into the world when they came, what they should do to live, and what they should observe to avoid punishment.

For those of us who have forgotten this instruction during our 'flight/journey' over into this earth to be born mortal (who has not dreamt of an exciting airplane ride full of anticipation) and once here we can CHOOSE to be reminded of God's word by the brave few who attempt to act as ambassadors for God.

This movie is reprehensible for trying to trick ignorant people into believing God is forceful and only concerned  with reforming us to His liking regardless of our hearts desire. That God will relent into incorporating our desires if only we demand it. And lastly to sympathize and side with the one dark lonely angel who will help give man what his heart desires.

Quite shocking, but no more shocking than some of our dreams can be as the trickster of our mind attempts to offer persuasion and bring enlightenment or even confusion.",1322956800,,5601,4.560319042871386
4123091,4,B003GAMOIW,"The Adjustment Bureau is quite the surprise.  It's a romance/science fiction type movie and... at first I didn't see how it was remotely possible to blend these two drastically different styles together and make something watchable, but after witnessing it I now see how!

Let it be known that I'm a humongous fan of movie concepts that are just plain *different*.  I honestly can't imagine anything else resembling the Adjustment Bureau.  It's definitely unique.  Leading viewers into thinking this is going to be yet another election/politician type plotline and then morphing into pure science fiction is a genius and *incredibly* surprising move.

Many complaints that I've read are that the plot is difficult to follow.  It's actually remarkably SIMPLE to follow- it's just that it's unbelievably different from everything else out there that it's hard to wrap your head around the concept.

It's about these mysterious uniform-wearing men that make special appearances before Matt Damon's character.  These men exist to make sure people do things ""according to plan"".  The word ""plan"" is a frequently mentioned theme while watching the movie.  You'll hear this word a thousand times, believe me.  These men don't really have a specific name, and at first their presence is hard to understand because they just *appear* under mysterious conditions, so you're not really sure what to think about them until the film gets going.

Well it turns out these men are convinced that Matt Damon's character has the potential to make a significant impact in his future concerning his role as a politician, so they always appear before him in a firm attempt to make sure he sets on the right course without any distractions, however...

Matt Damon meets a beautiful woman that he falls in love with (of course, just *look* at her!) and every time he loses contact with the woman, he meets her again by total chance either during a bus ride or while walking down the city sidewalk, which means this is NOT part of the plan!  Uh oh!  This means the mysterious men are going to cause trouble for poor Matt.  This means, according to the storyline, anything that goes against the plan will result in Matt's memory being erased.

Well... that particular aspect seems to fall by the wayside after a while, because later on the strange men demand Matt Damon's character to make a really difficult decision- either break up the relationship with the girl so Matt can eventually become a powerful leader (I assume president of the United States) and his girlfriend will become the most famous dancer in the world, or... they can stay together and ruin all the potential they COULD have had.  The choice is Matt's!

To another one more element to the storyline, one of the men actually comes to Matt's aid to help him with these tough decisions.

It sounds confusing but honestly the storyline is pretty simple to understand.  It's just a radically different concept that most of us haven't experienced in a movie before.  As a result, hey, I appreciate originality, so I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

Sure, the concept of being able to change the future by deviating from a specific plan may seem really bizarre and unbelievable, but the fact the Adjustment Bureau is so original won me over in a huge way!  Plus I loved the beautiful scenery of the door concept- whenever Matt Damon or one of the other men would go through a door, they would appear in a different environment.  In one example, they went to a baseball stadium after leaving a dark stairway.  It gets our imaginative juices flowing.  You'll see what I mean when you watch it.

I love the Adjustment Bureau.  Basically the moral is that you have choices in your life, and free will, so you should take advantage of it.",1322870400,2,3770,4.8453125
4123092,5,B003GAMOIW,"The Adjustment Bureau is one of my favorite movies of the last few years. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt play perfectly off of each other while the sci-fi plot tosses enough compassion and endearment in to keep cynicism in check. It's the kind of movie I relish, in no small part because I'm a gigantic sucker for the magical power of true love.

Furthermore, I love this movie because it is the kind of movie that reminds me of the great movies from the 30s and 40s - optimistic movies that take the world we live in and people we can relate to and put them in situations that reveal their strong sense of truth and the goodness in humanity as well as their unfailing belief in love.

I admit that it's way too easy to knock The Adjustment Bureau for being heavy-handed and hokey, and it is without a doubt. But thanks to genuine and endearing performances by Blunt, Damon, and Anthony Mackie as the bureau member with a conscience, the movie manages to sink its hook deep inside my heart and take me along for a thrilling and glorious ride.",1322870400,3,1038,4.401041666666667
4123093,1,B003GAMOIW,"This movie started out like a political thriller, then quickly crumbled into an existential mess. Matt Damon plays a senate candidate who meets the girl of his dreams. According to God's plan, he needs to be kept away from this girl so he wins political office. The Men-In-Hats (God's enforcers) do every thing they can to keep them away from each other.

The problem with the movie is there is no reason to root for one side or the other. The powers that be (God and the fedora wearing angels) want him to be elected to the senate and then president. But we're never told why this is a good thing. The only thing standing in his way of obtaining the highest political office is his love for a free spirited dancer (who he meets while she's hiding in the Men's room from hotel security). Damon and Blunt have very little chemistry, which leaves you wondering why he would drop everything for a girl he made out with in front of the urinals.

This movie was boring because it was pointless. He doesn't seem like that great a politician, their romance doesn't seem that compelling, and the bad guys don't seem particularly bad. There was nothing at stake and nothing to root for.",1322697600,18,1177,4.52112676056338
4123094,1,B003GAMOIW,"While the cover artwork of this movie makes it seem like a fast-paced thriller...this move is 90% chick-flick material!

I thought there would be lots of Sci-Fi action and drama...but the majority of the film revolves around ""cute"" conversations between the two main leads slowly falling in love.

This one's for the girls...not fans of Sci-Fi thrillers or action, like the movie poster suggests.

Plus, was anyone else offended by the line in the movie when the black ""Angel"" character warns Matt Damon about men-in-hats ruling the world and that: """"Even people in yarmulke's!!""...insinuating you should be suspicious of Jewish people, because they control fate?!

4123095,3,B003GAMOIW,"First Impressions:  The movie was not bad, but did not resonate with me at all.  David Norris is a politician on his way up.  But on the night of the election he is losing badly due to an unflattering photo appearing in the New York Post (yeah, it happens).  He meets a girl in the mens' room who is running from security as she crashed a wedding (how, why or when is never explained).

After a five minute conversation they kiss passionately right there in the mens' room.  Yeah, like that would happen, but it's Hollywood.

There is an organization which runs behind the lines controlling Man to some ultimate destiny.  It was explained that when Man was not guided, the Dark Ages and being on the brink of nuclear destruction with the Cuban Missile Crisis followed.

Despite these clear explanations, David Norris still wants the girl even though it would ruin his career and hers.  He abandons her at first and then changes his mind.  He wears his magic hat and runs through doors which act as portals to different areas of the city.  We get to see a freaked-out girl and the sewers of New York, both of which are not pretty to see.

Ending:  No spoiler, but I was not impressed.  The ending was predictable.  I would have preferred Norris making president and looking back at that and chuckle, or God having the last laugh.  Rental!",1322179200,,1337,4.527196652719665

4123098,5,B003GAMOIW,"Not surprised to see negative reviews but that means the movie is not for everyone. I like movies with a meaning. If you do too, then don't miss this one. Some reviews referred it to Matrix, well this is a Matrix movie, only unfortunately when people watched the Bourne trilogy the Matrix, they were attracted more by it's drama, tense, fighting and visual effects. Not too much like that in the Adjustment Bureau. BUT, in the sense of meaning, a beautiful woman who's born to be the soul-mate of any intelligent/remarkable guy, this movie is outstanding. It's sharing the same 'truth' of the Matrix, explaining that our mind has always been imprisoned and our freewill never will get us what we could have had. We were born to believe what THEY want us to believe, adjusted if you dare for anything more. Ever had the impulse that you had to do something no matter what, but suddenly some accident hit you? Ever wondered when you are desperate and was asked: are you OK? Do you ever have the chance to say: No, actually I'm not OK. I did that once and the person who tried to show some concern simply froze with a wide open mouth. You are a performer wearing masks to say and do what you are supposed to, who cares about what you really wanted? You do multiple-choices as if you have freewill, but pretty often none of the choices reflect your liking. As a woman you are supposed to please your guy and even sleep with guys you don't like. As a man you have to kiss asses and keep your mouth shut, qualities more important than any of your glorious credentials. On the surface, it's a peaceful world in perfect order around you, deep in the heart you might felt you are always being watched. Why do we go to sleep 1/3 our time here on earth? You never knew where your soul had been in the darkness: adjusted? Remixed? or Replaced? Ever wanted a soul mate who will understand you totally unconditionally like you can give up the entire world just to have her? Do I need to go on?

When Damon's character fails to win an election, he is bouyed by the fact that he meets the woman of his dreams that very night. The two connect immediately, but there are cosmic forces at odds with this relationship, and for the rest of the film Damon must battle beings who control time, space, and the future, and wear really cool hats, too, if he wants to win his love.

The concepts were amazing, and the love story very strong. The doors leading to different places when one wears the special hat is really interesting, but not enough was done with it. Otherwise this was a pleasant story with a fairy tale happy ending.",1321660800,,772,4.546762589928058

4123111,4,B003GAMOIW,"I watched The Adjustment Bureau with my hubby last night and I quite enjoyed it. This movie is about a young American politician who meet Elise, an eccentric dancer and fells in love with her. Now this could be your typical two people from different creeds in society meet and fall inappropriately in love kind of story, and it is, except this movie bring a twist to the old and tried concept, the Adjustment Bureau. Now as it turns out there are these gentlemen in suits and hats that walk around making sure things go according to plan, and the plan say that our hero and Elise is not to be together. The Adjustment Bureau deals with free will versus destiny as well as introducing a very interesting take on God, angels and the nature of reality. The Adjustment Bureau is what you would get if The Matrix and Dark City sat down one night to watch The American President together but in the middle of the movie they decided to make love instead and had a baby.

The Adjustment Bureau have a good story, it is well phased and have enough humor to make it delightful without ruining the serious tone of many of the scenes. By the end of it you really do cheer for David and Elise to get to stay together. The actors all do a great job and the music works well with the movie even if it is pretty forgettable. All in all The Adjustment Bureau is a good movie, here however I have one gripe with this flick, it seams like the creators of this movie decided to play it safe. The Adjustment Bureau is good, but it is not great, it do not take any chances. This could have been an amazing film, but as it is it is entertaining and fulfilling but like it's music it is forgettable.

Another gripe I have with this movie is Elise. Now I know the director wanted her to be delightfully whimsical, but she is not she is at times just stupid. Ok so she is an adult woman who crashes a wedding just for fun? No reason for it, just fun, seams a bit childish to me, but fine the case workers (the men in hats) could have made her do that, but later when Elise meet David on the bus, and keep in mind they have known one another for five seconds here, she takes his new several hundred dollars work phone and put it in his cup of coffee! Who do that? Is it supposed to be cute? And if so who would find having their very expensive work phone destroyed on a whimsical whim by a woman they have just met? That bus scene really made it hard for me to suspend disbelief because it was just so stupid. I know it is just one scene and the rest of the movie is good, but when the heroine in a love story is presented as half insane, selfish and destructive in one of the first scenes where the main characters interact it get a bit difficult to take the relationship between the main characters serious later in the movie. In general The Adjustment Bureau had been a more powerful film if that F***** Blueberry had never ended up in a cup of coffee.

The Adjustment Bureau is not perfect, not by a long stretch, it pay it safe and while it is never boring the movie is forgettable, it is one of those flicks that do not have any impact on you but when one of your friends mention it a while later you go, humm...ah...yes I think I have seen that, it was pretty good what I can remember, but other than that it will just fade from memory. I do however think The Adjustment Bureau is worth a watch, especially if you are a fan of movies like the Matrix or Dark City. I recommend this movie as a buy as a few months after you have seen it you will have completely forgotten about the movie and can then enjoy discovering the story all over again, it is a never ending bundle of joy that way, and now that I think about it, good but forgettable can actually be a winning combination on the home entertainment marked. :P",1320624000,,3794,4.1945205479452055
4123112,4,B003GAMOIW,"George Nolfi's debut as screenwriter/director sometimes shows in the stressed seams of the plot and slight shifts of tone, but the engaging lead characters played by Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are so engaging and believable on screen that all is forgiven.  Here is what true screen chemistry is all about.

The plot concerns rising politician David Norris (Damon) in position to win a senate seat and his relationship with dazzling ballerina Elise Sellas (Blunt), a woman unlike any other.  But just when he realizes he is falling in love with her, mysterious men plot to keep them apart.  Are there ""agents of fate"" or is Norris going mad?  Is life itself all predetermined or can you actually exercise free will?

This fine film plays with this fundamental question with surprising results.  A Philip K. Dick short story was the inspiration for this film.  Dick himself had issues with so-called ""reality,"" which makes this movie even more provocative and entertaining.  The Blu-ray has interesting featurettes along with a sometimes thoughtful commentary from director Nolfi.",1319414400,,1078,5.149425287356322
4123113,4,B003GAMOIW,"I think it's safe to say that The Adjustment Bureau is unlike any other thriller you have seen in many a moon. It is based of a Phillip K. Dick story so what it lacks in the usual heavy duty fight scenes and unreal exchanges of gun fire it makes up for in making a person think.  This is a film that tells a story and by and large does it well.  The concept of a ""guardian angel"" type of bureaucracy  overseeing the lives of critical people is fascinating and unique and the great acting, script and directing makes it seem plausible.

I do believe the acting needs to be called out for special praise.  Matt Damon as the person who is exposed to the Adjustment Bureau is great as a person who wants control of his own life.  The various members of the Adjustment Bureau are great but special attention should be called out for Terrance Stamp.  He somehow balances menacing and caring without seeming too much of either. If you are open to a new experience then this is the film for you.",1319328000,2,987,4.302702702702702

4123115,4,B003GAMOIW,"This was not at all what I expected, i.e. a thriller about some group that was exerting control to some esoteric purpose.  Instead, it is a kind of metaphysical thriller, where a talented young politician doesn't fit with the plan and fights very hard to go his own way.  It is a nice twist on a totalitarianism that is adaptable and not all that bad in intent, however messy the details are.

On the positive side, the chemistry between Damon (an absolutely first rate actor) and Emily Blunt is amazingly believable.  They are riveting on screen, genuinely moving, at least to me.  This is one level of the film, a kind of love story against all odds - how can they make it work when everything conspires against them.

So, without playing the spoiler, Damon discovers that he is being ""managed"", indeed that he has a destiny.  He is a remarkable young politician, somewhat rebellious but committed to changing things.  He has always felt a certain emptiness, an emotional hole within himself that he is attempting to fill with the ""people's love"" as he climbs the political ladder.  Then, he has a chance meeting with an extraordinary young woman, and enters an adventure that is as indescribable as it is complex and ultimately impossible to limn.  He feels fulfilled, which violates the logic of his destiny.  Any means will be employed to correct things.

4123116,3,B003GAMOIW,"Loosely based on a P. K. Dick story, ""The Adjustment Bureau"" has one good thing in it ... actually two: Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. The sci-fi romance greatly benefits from the palpable chemistry between the believable characters they play, a Congressman David Norris by Damon and a ballet dancer Elise Sellas by Blunt. Without the capable stars, ""The Adjustment Bureau,"" though it has some interesting ideas, might have been just another lukewarm thriller.

""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a romance with a sci-fi twist, in which Damon's David meets Blunt's Elise after his unsuccessful run for Senator. They are meant for each other and that's what they (and we) think. Things turned out differently when ""The Adjustment Bureau"" steps in, with their own agenda to follow.

It is obvious that the film is trying to raise questions about free will and fate, but honestly I could not take the slickly told but not-so-convincing story very seriously. If these guys working for the Bureau are entrusted with such powers as shown in one office scene, why not use them to get the results they want? And why those hats and doors? Those guys are apparently governed by a certain set of rules, rules that we do not really know.

Writer/first-time director George Nolfi keeps the story going. The story is sometimes told at a fast pace. The climactic ""chase"" sequence is one good example. ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is entertaining and often compelling, not because of the theme it deals with, but because of the two leads' star power as well as nice pace and editing.",1318896000,2,1551,4.867424242424242

4123124,5,B003GAMOIW,"If one were to believe the promotional spots I personally saw for The Adjustment Bureau, you'd get the idea that this was counterpart to The Source Code, a sci-fi thriller of sorts with a little Bourne thrown in.  One would be wrong then.

I didn't run to the theater to see either this or the Source Code not that they didn't look appealing in various ways, but neither gave me the impression that any new ground was being broken, and thus, it could wait until Blu-ray.  I was wrong then.

This is easily one of the best movies I've seen all year, and again, it you had warned me it was essentially a slightly-theological romantic-actioner, I'd probably have skipped it.  What the movie has is strong, believeable acting, effects that don't overshadow the plot, a plot that is thought provoking and original, well written AND delivered dialogue, and a certain ""heart"", if you will, that most movies these days are lacking.

Damon's done a lot of work up to this point in his career, and Matt Damon purists might cry foul, but I think this is one of his strongest movies yet.  When the actor and the character flow easily together, like they do in this film, there is a genuine quality that brings this performance easily to the top of the list.  Strong lines, coupled with a tangible chemistry between he and his supporting actors (most notably Emily Blunt, whose time on screen with Damon reminds me of Clooney and Lopez in Out of Sight in its believeability), make an already impressive career even stronger.  You root for Damon in this film because he shows his connection with Blunt, with his best-friend/campaign manager, with the Bureau Agents.  His everyman-vibe has never been more ""real"", and never been more likable.

The movie moves at a quick pace, and says what it came to say in just over 90 minutes, which is a rare accomplishment in its own right.  I can't say enough good things about this film, and if, like me, you dismissed it for something it wasn't, go rent it tonight - it may turn into a permanent addition to your collection.",1317772800,,2051,4.619834710743802
4123125,3,B003GAMOIW,"I adore Philip K Dick stories, so I was thrilled to see another movie was coming out based on a story he had written. This one was ""The Adjustment Bureau"" based on ""Adjustment Team"". I had high hopes.

The storyline is intriguing. Angels, using iPad style devices, are tracking humanity and keeping them ""adjusted"" on their proper paths. If someone veers from the path that is set for them, they are nudged back on path. Little changes don't matter, but if someone does a large change, they are fixed.

Matt Damon is a man running for New York Senate. He's on a great track for success. However, he gets distracted by an offbeat, funny dancer - played by Emily Blunt. The Adjustment Bureau is Not Happy. They need to get him back on track.

SPOILER ALERT

Normally I like Philip K Dick stories because of the twists and turns in them - but this one lays out almost predictably as a romantic comedy. Guy meets girl. Guy loses girl. Guy meets girl again. Hurdles appear. Guy and girl surmount them and live happily ever after.

Even worse, though, it seems really forced. They meet once and kiss, maybe 10 minutes together total. Three years later they meet again on a bus for maybe 10 minutes and separate.  Then I think a year or so later they meet, have a quick lunch, and sleep together. And then he abandons her.

So she also has this great guy, Adrian, who adores her. He stands by her. He takes her back after she breaks their engagement. After all of this, David pops back into her life and POOF she runs off with him again and abandons her loyal guy. All because she has a ""feeling"" that they were meant to be together.

That disturbs me a lot. With all the studies about how those feelings often ride on things like eye dilation and time-of-the-month hormones and so on, do we really want to be telling people to abandon loyal, trusting boyfriends because they have an urge to kiss a guy they've never seen before?

Plus, it doesn't feel like a Philip K Dick story at all. There are no real twists. Things don't always make sense. Why would an angel break all the rules to help them? Why do plans just suddenly 'change'? The ending message felt extremely forced.

So I was disappointed.",1317686400,,2194,4.4625

4123128,3,B003GAMOIW,"Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are star crossed lovers. While that may sound like a set up for a romantic movie, in ""The Adjustment Bureau,"" it could destroy the world as 'The Chairman' has planned. As loosely based on a story by Phillip K Dick, the adjusters come to Earth at the orders of the Chairman to quietly make little tweaks so the world runs just as it should. Trouble is, Damon and Blunt are not supposed to be in the plan.

In Dick's story, Damon's Dick Norris is not a rising polition, but some grey suit in an office who stumbles into the adjusters, who happen to be dogs. In the story, the dog is supposed to bark and delay Damon. In this case, the adjusters are given human form and magic fedoras that make John Slattery look like he just crossed the street from shooting Mad Men, but in the movie give them the power to navigate strange portals (a store door that opens to Yankee Stadium, for example) and make things work as the Chairman sees fit.

Religious Allegory much? While that is never mentioned, Chairman = God gets pretty obvious and tiresome as the movie stretches out. While Dick's original story was deeply misogynistic, at least Blunt is given a woman who could conceivably be the strong character Damon would fall for. Ultimately, the fate versus freewill argument consumes the movie and the holes begin taking up more space than the magic doors. Blunt and Damon have good chemistry, Terrence Stamp is a menacing adjuster, but the movie can't maintain a steady pace. ""Inception"" this isn't.",1316736000,,1519,4.622222222222222

If you enjoyed the Lake House, you will also like this one.

This movie is loosely based on the concept of 'angelic intervention', however, these beings come across more like the agents in the Matrix, but with hats.

Although the plot was pretty well written, you get the feeling that more should have been done to raise the level of suspence. A big let down for me was that you never got to see the 'chairman'.",1316217600,,733,5.715596330275229
4123142,4,B003GAMOIW,"This film is unusual in that it successfully combines genres that don't often work together - sci-fi and love story, with action thrown in to boot. Because of the great chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, it is the love story that works the best. Damon is perfect as a charismatic New York politician, and Blunt is even better as a soulful, quirky, up-and-coming dancer. Casting her against Damon, rather than going with a more traditional 'leading lady'/love interest was one of the best decisions of the film.

The movie is based on a story by Phillip Dick (which I have not read), in which Damon's and Blunt's characters meet by chance, and are instantly drawn to each other, but have no way to meet again. Strange men-in-black types (with hats) seem to be following Damon, and we soon discover are bent on keeping Damon and Blunt from ever finding each other. It doesn't work, they do meet, and everything goes awry from there. The movie explores themes of free will vs. fate, and I would say also different notions of religious faith and the idea of a guiding force (i.e. 'the chairman' in this film.)

I was intrigued the entire time, and the only reason I can't give it 5 vs. 4 stars is that I felt the 'adjustment bureau' portrayals (the men-in-black-with-hats) were a bit cheesy. At times they were comical (especially John Slattery's portryal) and I think perhaps the film should have just gone with that comedic aspect and let this be a little more of a dark comedy. But the others played their parts straight, and so the tone was a bit off. And I felt Harry, the primary 'agent' assigned to Damon's character, never got developed enough to be the centerpiece of the movie in the way the plot set him up to be.

So there was a bit of confusion on tone, and the underdevelopment of that one character. Otherwise, this was a great - and unusual - film, with fine performances by Damon and Blunt.",1315785600,,1914,4.574344023323615

4123144,3,B003GAMOIW,"At first, I thought this was going to be an action movie.  It was not, although there are some action scenes.

Then, you find out quickly that it is a love story.  Love found, love lost, and then love found again.

Unfortunately, I didn't care for neither the politician nor the dancer.  The politician has issues, including excessive drinking and partying, that haunt his political career.  All of a sudden, he seems to be having a tryst with a party-crashing dancer.  Doesn't this sound way too familiar?

Then, there's the element of the Adjustment Bureau, a large group of bureaucrats with the supernatural power to guide human destiny.  I didn't care for the bureaucrats either.  There's infighting, there's disagreements on how to solve a problem, and there's a bureaucrat who doesn't want to follow the rules.  Doesn't that sound too familiar also?

So, you have the imperfect politician, the disrepectful dancer, and the bumbling  bureaucrats, with all three running around in circles and finally with the bureaucrats giving chase to the two, trying to determine some plan.

I don't think the story succeeded in what is was trying to do.  What was the story about anyway?  There's the love story.  As a love story, I'll give it 5 stars.

But what about the question raised with the Chairman?  Is it a reference to God?  Is the Chairman fallible or infallible?

The bureaucrats are certainly fallible, with failings.

I can see how some people may have issues with the whole concept of the Chairman, the bureaucrats, and the two lovers, which points to the greater issue of predestiny and ultimately, God.

But when you think about it, it is just a love story and Sci-Fi film, with a twist of some overarching hierarchy, to give it drama and action.  I just accept it as that and no more.",1315440000,,1795,4.771986970684039

In any case, this isn't your typical sci-fi movie with guns/ships/lasers and aliens. This movie stirred the 'romantic' in me and it's refreshing in this era of cynical 'dark' and 'realistic' cinema. It goes past the science jargon and gets to the point quickly. In the end it's about two people who cannot be together due to circumstances out of their control.

Nolti retains only the central conceit of our world being shepherded along by agents of a grand plan,bolstering it with a love story to heighten the stakes of the conflict between predetermination and free will. Matt Damon's ambitious politician David Norris learn of the Adjustment Bureau's grip on mankind's every move(storm troopers in trilby hats),he faces losing the love of his life(Emily Blunt)if he is to
pursue his path to the presidency. The mysterious Judeo-Christian forces are detemined to keep them apart. There is a link with Paycheck,where a couple go on the run after falling in love,and are threatened with having their brains wiped. The main weaknesses are the flimsy conceptual machinations whereby the love story becomes the films driving force,due to the adhoc nature of the Bureau's operational procedures:unable to keep tabs on humans near water and the network of secret passages the Bureau uses can only be negotiated wearing a hat,and turning the door handles clockwise.

Anthony Mackie acts as the conscience -racked agent,Terence Stamp weighs in with a history of mankind's failings when the celestial stabilisers have been taken off. The film lacks visceral punch and texture. What works is the chemistry of the central couple Blunt and Damon as this becomes an essentially light-hearted romance whereby a single kiss has prompted the Bureau to rewrite the plan.

The mysterious manipulators of their lives were creepy but well played especially by Anthony Mackie as Harry, John Slattery as Richardson, and Terrance Stamp as Thompson. I also liked Michael Kelly as Charlie, friend, speechwriter, campaign manager? for David.

The mysterious members of the Adjustment Bureau, however, make it known to David that his nascent romance is not in his best interest, but David resists what he sees not as their advice, but their meddling.

As the film progresses, it invites the viewer to ask questions and form their own opinion about whether the protagonists make the right choices concerning their destiny and whether free will is a good thing--different viewers will likely come to different conclusions about the choices made.

""The Adjustment Bureau"" is not flawless--there is some silly commentary on the part of the head of the Adjustment Bureau on the history of humanity, and the ending is not necessarily what one would expect from a movie that examines free will and determinism.  I thought that the movie was a bit odd when I first saw it at the theater, but it is well acted, its cinematography of New York City is great, and it is worth your time--the film is one of those movies that gets much better with a second viewing.",1314057600,,1238,4.712962962962963

The Adjustment Bureau is a silly, convoluted story that suggests human destiny and fate are not a result of freewill, but rather controlled by a bunch of federal agent looking dudes in fedoras. Our entire lives are written in a script and if at any point it looks as though we may go off script the fedora wearing dudes are there to make Adjustments to ensure that we stay on path.

While carrying a concept that sounded kind of cool with a trailer that made the movie seem like an action / sci-fi flick, it turned out to be more of an oddly placed love story in the middle of an action / sci-fi flick. Damon shines as a presidential candidate that becomes aware of the Bureau due to his path going off course in the form of a romance with Blunt. The dialogue between Damon and Blunt was entertaining and fun to watch, but the weird ""Damon wants to be with Blunt; the Bureau doesn't want him to be with Blunt; the Bureau will now go through a magic door and change your destiny"" dynamic got tiring and I found myself poking holes in the plot the whole way through the movie versus sitting back and enjoying the show.

Having the qualities of being a generally well-made film, I was initially  intrigued, but as the story unfolded I became less and less impressed.  Before the credit roll I had a suspicion that it might be something by Philip K. Dick.

I have for most of my life had an interest in science-fiction and read a lot of it when I was younger, but there have always been some aspects of it that I simply cannot buy.  In ""The Minority Report ,"" Dick asks us to entertain the existence of pre-destination on which the entire story hinges.  In this one, what with the ""Chairman"" and the ""Plan,"" he wants us to accept the ideas of pre-destination and gods or God -- two concepts that I cannot accept as  story vehicles.

I had washed my hands of finding 'the one', and at 44YO, I am feeling spontaneous as a kid. Reality would try to kill that spark, but too often, our relationships lack that blind abandonment and replace it with reason.

These questions are the basis of the Adjustment Bureau, where Matt Damon's character, a promising senate nominee, is unintentionally exposed to the dealings of the 'Bureau'. He manages to stumble upon something he was never supposed to see, and sort of threatened to keep quiet about it, or else risk his whole memory being erased. He doesn't ask too many questions, and actually keeps going with the flow, except for one aspect. He meets a woman, played by Emily Blunt and instantly feels something. He can't explain it, but in his mind, she is the one for him. But unfortunately, she is not in his pre-fated path and the folks at the Adjustment Bureau tell him as much. He cannot be with her in any capacity and refuse to give him a reason as to why. This is mostly the entire plot of the film.

After Blunt's character, an aspiring ballet dancer, dissapears for a while, Damon pines after her, trying in vain to locate her with no luck. Then after 3 years, as if by chance, he finds her again, and has the Adjustment Bureau guys on his back yet again. But this time he refuses to take no for an answer. I suppose this is more of a romantic film, rather than a thriller or mystery. The plot is very thin and never seems to want to be more. The Bureau men wear hats and can turn any door in NY into their own personal gateway to wherever they want to get to. There are glimpses of intrigue, but it never goes very far.

Matt Damon is Matt Damon, not great, not poor. Emily Blunt is sweet and passive, but as usual has a great screen presence. The other characters are all part of the Bureau and are not terribly interesting. My one huge gripe with the film is the ending. I don't want to say it wasn't satisfying, but for me, it changed the whole message of the film, especially after the whole speech about what happened to the world throughout history when the Bureau did not interfere with anyone's lives...

4123188,5,B003GAMOIW,"The Adjustment Bureau, directed by George Nolfi, is an action packed romance movie that captivates from beginning to end. David Norris (Matt Damon) is a rising New York politician who has a chance meeting with a professional dancer, Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) that completely changes his life. The two fall madly in love and must deal with divine powers trying to keep them apart in a battle between free will and fate. This is a thought provoking film which challenges personal beliefs regarding a higher power and creates an interesting plot. Although I believe in free will, the possibility of ""Adjusters"" or ""Angels"" guiding our lives and keeping us on a predetermined path is intriguing. It makes me wonder what my life would look like if I chose another path or had an ""Adjuster"" correcting my mistakes.

The chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is intense and enhances the believability of David and Elise's emotions. The intimacy and impulsiveness of their first kiss leaves me feeling like they are meant to be together. Although this adds to the predictability of the ending, I appreciate David's determination to win Elise. Since I am a hopeless romantic, watching a man fight for the love of his life is very appealing.

The cinematography is very well done and the special effects create a visually exciting chase scene through Manhattan. The seamless transition as the characters move supernaturally through doors all over the city is mesmerizing. After living and working in Manhattan for many years, the backdrop evokes a feeling of nostalgia and makes me a little biased towards movies set in New York City. The music of Thomas Newman, one of my favorite film score composers, is engaging and compliments the feeling of romance between David and Elise, as well stimulates the action scenes throughout the film.

I would like to see this movie made into a tv series from within the Adjustment Bureau. There is so much more I'd like to know about how they work things.

I hold a soft spot in my heart and mind for stories regarding angels, Fates (in the Greek and Roman interpretations of such), mythologies, and queries regarding free will versus pre-destination. The Adjustment Bureau covers all of that and more, without being over explanatory. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt give excellent performances, as does the supporting cast of threatening and benign ""Adjustmenters"". Watching the Adjustment Bureau is a truly exceptional experience; it is a rare film indeed, that allows me to fully escape into another reality, and let go of myself for a much needed 100 minutes.

The Film 4/5

I almost went to see The Adjustment Bureau at the theater, but generally negative reviews made me decide to wait for the Blu-ray release. The same was true of Clint Eastwood's Hereafter, also starring Matt Damon. I'm going to have to trust my instincts more because I found both movies entertaining.

So why the negative reviews?

What do you expect from a Matt Damon movie? His biggest role was as Jason Bourne in the hugely successful trilogy and I think he's expected to be an action hero in every role he plays. That's simply not the case. The man can act and he has a lot more to offer than some give him credit for. The marketing for The Adjustment Bureau is selling it as an action movie, but it's actually a love story with a science fiction element. The front cover shows Damon and Blunt running. They do run in the movie, but that's not the point of the story.

This is not an action movie.

David Norris (Damon) is running for Senate and he's losing. He meets Elise (Blunt) in a bathroom and they kiss. A brief conversation influences his concession speech and he decides to be completely honest with the assembled crowd. This is not typical behavior for a politician. The entire meeting was arranged without his knowledge just for the purpose of influencing his speech.

We are introduced to four men in suits and hats. They look like the Men in Black. What is their origin and why and how are they trying to influence events? One has an assignment to delay Norris by making him spill coffee on his shirt, but he fails to intervene in time. As a result, Norris walks into his office and sees the men altering the memories of his colleagues. He runs, but is quickly caught. They make him promise to keep their secret. They also demand that he drops any interest in Elise as the two aren't supposed to be together.

Norris isn't ready to give up on Elise and feels strongly attracted to her. He searches for years and eventually tracks her down. The Adjustment Bureau fails to anticipate his resourcefulness and level of determination. In order to prevent the relationship, other methods are tried to tear the two apart. Norris is given some strong reasons to walk away from Elise. Will they be enough, or will his attraction toward her prove to be too strong?

Philip K. Dick wrote the short story on which the movie is based. He was also responsible for Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which resulted in Blade Runner being made. I'm not saying that the Adjustment Bureau is on the same level, but it's certainly a thought-provoking story worthy of your time.

Think about fate and predestination for a moment. Do you live your life thinking that every step has been mapped out? If that were the case, why bother to do anything? Do you think that your overall destination has been decided, but it's up to you how you get there? That would at least give your actions some meaning. Or do you think that everything is random and there's no reason or purpose behind anything we do? The Adjustment Bureau raises similar questions. You might be able to predict how the movie ends, but the fun is experiencing the journey.

Emily Blunt has good chemistry with Damon and the casting was spot on. She had to learn how to look like a ballet dancer for the part and she was utterly convincing in the role.

I love the Bourne movies, but I'm a fan of Damon's acting in general. It dates back to Good Will Hunting and Rounders. In fact, I've rarely seen Damon disappoint. Hereafter and The Adjustment Bureau will stay in my collection and I'm happy to own them. If you give The Adjustment Bureau a try without expecting an action movie, you might end up enjoying it as much as I did.

Video Quality 4/5
While most recent releases use the MPEG-4 AVC codec, The Adjustment Bureau uses VC-1. The result isn't bad, but I've seen more striking presentations. Grain is moderately thick and detail is average. Many of the scenes have an intentional blue tint, but colors are otherwise accurate. I wouldn't complain about the picture quality, but it's far from exceptional.

Audio Quality 4/5
The English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix does a good job for the most part. Dialogue is clear, apart from in noisy settings when it's not supposed to be. When Norris is talking to the crowds of people, the atmosphere seems realistic and sounds are separated well. There are no gunshots or explosions, but the sound quality is good throughout.

Special Features 2.5/5

Audio Commentary by Writer/Director George Nolfi.

Deleted and Extended Scenes (6:54)

Labyrinth of Doors - A Google Map allowing you to explore various parts of New York. Each door offers a small feature; normally under a minute long. It's a lot of work to navigate through everything and the reward doesn't seem worth it.

Leaping Through New York (7:36) - Showing the wide range of locations used during the shoot.

Destined to Be (4:51) - Damon and Blunt talk about the casting process and their characters.

Becoming Elise (7:08) - How Blunt learned how to become a dancer for the role. Acting can be hard!

The Adjustment Bureau asks some interesting questions. It's well-acted and kept my interest for the 106-minute duration. The mystery element and slow exposition have the effect of placing the viewer in the same situation as David Norris, and it works effectively. If you go in with the right expectations (not anticipating explosions and constant action), the story has a lot to offer.

4123194,4,B003GAMOIW,"After watching the opening scene (which seemed to be taken directly from one of my favorite books:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gods-of-Ruin-A-Political-Thriller/dp/B003URRSX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gods of Ruin: A Political Thriller</a>), the plot from Phillip K Dick's short story took hold (a team of adjustment specialists freeze people and adjust reality in order to conform to ""the plan""). The story is wild and the production/acting is great, but I started getting bored toward the end and the finale left me unimpressed.

One ironic philosophical twist was how the screenplay writers tied the concept of free will for humanity with fascism and the wars of the 20th century. When the adjustment bureau left it up to the humans to act according to their will, we devolved into totalitarianism. I'm not sure what this says about the producers' view on freedom, but I don't think it's positive.

AB is certainly a conversation starter though and worth the watch!",1312416000,2,1016,5.766666666666667
4123195,3,B003GAMOIW,If you can overlook the leftist bias in the film its a pretty good movie.  Bias was seen in the trashing of a Republican politician to the numerous cameos of the leftist royalty.  Liked the Love Story.,1312329600,2,201,4.405405405405405
4123196,1,B003GAMOIW,"The movie starts with Matt Damon's character David Norris in the heat of elections which he loses,  then meets a girl in the men's bathroom and falls in love.

Then the Hat People come into picture.  They seem to have special powers, but also seem to be utterly incompetent, and don't have problem changing their minds.  They kept talking about the Plan, preventing the ripples, and everybody neatly fitting into it, and getting punished if they don't go along with it.  Just think about it.  There were at least 9 Hat People assigned to Mr David Norris.  That being average would mean that 90% of the people should be wearing hats all day long.  In the last half of the movie, Matt Damon is running around wearing a hat, presumably giving him special powers.  How could wearing a hat give anybody any power?

Throughout the movie rules are invoked as needed: you can turn the door knobs one way, unless you are wearing a hat, turn it the other way.  What if the door does not have a knob and it has a handle?  Maybe they did not think through that one?

Another angle to this movie would be Fate versus Free Will.  It would be an interesting topic to cover, but not with the Hat People.

This is not an action movie, there are no special effects in it.  It is not a sci-fi movie.  It could be considered a romance or a love story.  Since it is not funny, it is not a comedy either.  What it is is a time waster.  If you have infinite time, by all means watch it!

It is filled with holes and inconsistencies.  I can understand the suspension of disbelief, however there should be some logic, rhyme or reason within itself.

I guess nobody is immune to producing a trash like this, even the legendary Philip K. Dick or Matt Damon.",1312243200,7,1730,4.35423197492163
4123197,5,B003GAMOIW,"I watched this movie without the slightest clue what it was going to be about.  I picked it randomly.  But maybe it wasn't as random as I thought.  I don't want to ruin anything for someone who hasn't seen it.  Personally, I loved this movie.  When things get ""twisted"".....I shouted out, like the little boy from the Incredible's, ""W I C K E D""!  This movie needs credit alone for just being ""out of the norm"".  I feel exhausted  from so many of the newer movies that are spilling  with over-stimulation from too many graphics and special effects.....and sometimes I'm tired of so many ""see-it-coming-a-mile-away"" comedies.....and maybe a bit bored with the warmed-over love story.

This movie might lend a person to contemplate some of the ""special"" things that happen in their own life.  Maybe unexplainable things that make your pulse race or things you know deep down without any way to explain why you know.  There are probably plenty of people who won't really ""get"" this movie and that's okay...but those who do...will surely appreciate the effort.  Do I think life happens exactly like this movie? NO....but I think it's somewhere in the ballpark.  I believe anything that strikes the human cord and prompts you to examine your own life is well worth it.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who believes the truth will be stranger than fiction!",1312156800,,1348,4.774891774891775

Overall a very enjoyable film and a purchase I'm happy about.",1312156800,4,545,4.6875
4123210,4,B003GAMOIW,"The Adjustment Bureau is loosely based on a short story by Philip K. Dick first published in Orbit Science Fiction magazine in 1954.  In that story, Dick conceives of a secret ""Adjustment Team"" whose only function is to intervene on matters of historical importance and set us straight according to an overarching master plan.  The movie takes this concept and runs with it, adding a powerful love story between David Norris (played by Matt Damon) and Elise (played by Emily Blunt), a love that violates the master plan, presumably God's plan, who is referred to only as the ""chairman"" in the movie.  The Adjustment Bureau is called upon to set things right.

Philip Dick is one of my favorite authors and his concepts are consistently mind blowing.  Although screenwriter George Nolfi took liberties with the story, addressing the issue of personal destiny vs. free will and adding layers of complexity, the result is satisfying and superior to Dick's original story, which is one of his lesser works.  I found the movie enjoyable and I especially liked the chase sequences in New York, not knowing where doors might lead to.

Just ENTERTAINMENT in general today SUCKS!! Everything is so plastic, disposable, and superficial.

4123218,5,B003GAMOIW,"I was pretty much blown away by this movie, which is surprising to me because when I saw it out on video I could barely remember seeing any ads or buzz for it while it was in theatres.  While I can't say it rises to the level of say The Departed or True Grit, this movie deserves some high praise and a very enthusiastic recommendation because it is so entertaining and inspired.

The plot of this movie (general spoiler's upcoming) revolves around a New York Senate candidate played by Matt Damon.  Don't cringe, he does a tremendous job in putting together a very down-to-earth and believable politician.  He then meets a woman who he is instantly drawn to--only to find out the the Powers That Be will do everything they can to hold them apart.  The rest of the movie explores Damon's desire for free will, and whether it actually exists.  The pacing in my opinion is excellent and the story-telling and dialogue are as well.  I won't spoil anything else and will conclude just by saying that this movie is well worth watching.

Reflecting on this movie and the career of Damon, I have to say that Damon is fast becoming the best actor of our time.  I can't think of any actor that has put out as many classics over the last 15 years as Damon has.  With the Bourne Identities (particularly #2), The Departed, True Grit, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Rounders, and Goodwill Hunting, Matt Damon has actually outproduced Leonardo DiCaprio in quality movies over that time.  (He was also one of the few good things acting-wise in Saving Private Ryan, but I'd be doing the aforementioned a dis-service by inluding it in that list.)  I have to give DiCaprio credit for playing the lead in two of my favorite movies of all time in Blood Diamond and The Departed, but Damon's work as a whole exceeds his.  Both of these actors have put forth such impressive and consistent bodies of work that I feel like they are already comparable to the tandem of Newman and Redford.  Despite modern-day Hollywood's struggles in putting out good movies, these two actors are finding incredible scripts and talented directors and actors to work with that are letting them put together extremely impressive performances, ones that will be remembered for years to come.

In sum, this is a highly enjoyable movie and I would tell anyone that likes suspense to watch this movie.  I can't believe it didn't do better in the theatres.",1311552000,,2403,4.658767772511848

If a group of beings has the ability to manipulate and steer the futures of humans and use ""portal doors"" to get around, it would seem they would be advanced enough to not have to run around to chase people.

I was excited when we heard about this film and LOVED the idea of the plot ... but it just didn't come together for some reason.

4123236,4,B003GAMOIW,"Based on a short story ""Adjustment Team"" by Philip K. Dick and adjusted for the big screen by George Nolfi, this is one fun chase scene after another. If you look further into the story you can find layers of deeper meaning which are thinly veiled from the viewer. However the superficial story of lovers destined to be together and assisted by friends from another reality is quite enough to carry this movie.

Looking closely at this film you'll notice that many of the people are not really actors there actually politicians and other famous people. However the filmmakers selected just the right actors to play the characters and the actors do not overwhelm the characters they are playing; so you to imagine yourself as part of the story and find yourself kibitzing.

I missed this at the theater but did pick it up on Blu-ray and the particular DVD that I watched had a few interesting extras such as:
Deleted and extended scenes
The labyrinth of doors: interactive map of New York
Leaping through New York
Destined to be
Becoming a Elide

I have to confess that only took advantage of the commentaries. There are no new insights but it is nice to know what Nolfi was thinking.

From the beginning, I was captivated by the obvious chemistry between the two main characters, David and Elise, as they begin something only to have it end.  The rest of the movie is the search for the continuation of that promise with many twists and turns of fate and determination.  I highly recommend this movie!  It will make you begin to question as to how many of ""their"" plans you went along with in your life.",1311206400,,581,4.443396226415095
4123253,4,B003GAMOIW,"In the bleakest moment of upstart New York senator David Norris's political career, he meets free-spirited dancer Elise Sellas and never mind that he meets her in the men's room as he goes over his concession speech. Their flirty chance encounter so inspires David that his concession speech goes on to electrify the crowd and firmly plants him as a frontrunner for the next election. Mysterious are the workings of fate, that unknowable shaper of things that has decreed that this would be David and Elise's sole encounter. But then fate takes an inadvertent nap.

Taking the bus one day, David bumps into Elise again, and this time he's not willing to let go. And this is where fate manifests in the shape of the Adjustment Bureau, comprised of ordinary-looking men clad in trenchcoats and fedoras but demonstrating the uncanny knack for freezing time and folding geography. These strange Adjusters align themselves against David Norris, conspire against his pursuit of Elise. And there's just something quite cool and very Greek mythology about a guy who is so undeterred and would fight fate itself to be with the one he loves. But you can't discount how chilling the Adjustment Bureau's top agent Thompson (Terence Stamp) sounds when he tells our smitten, defiant congressman: ""When you look back at all this, David, just remember - we tried to reason with you.""

In a way, it's comforting to know that there IS a plan. Now I don't have to fret about free will and all that jazz and worry that I chose the wrong pair of socks to wear on a given day. Those socks were simply destined to be worn! It's cute how the story tries to be subtle with its referencing of the Almighty Dude and his assortment of guardian angels, preferring to instead trot out its ""agents of fate"" who - in the midst of ensuring that ""the Plan"" stays on course - would occasionally speak in awed tones of someone called ""the Chairman."" Thankfully, in terms of sensibility, the narrative stays more within the borders of the sci-fi thriller, instead of straying too far into the divine.

Maybe Matt Damon signed onboard this film partly because his pal Ben Affleck had already done a film adaptation of a Philip K. Dick short story (""Paycheck""). ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is based on Philip K. Dick's 1954 short story ""Adjustment Team."" But whatever the motivation, Damon excels in his role of David Norris, does well with the romantic lead bits and, of course, the action hero bits. His very real chemistry with Emily Blunt (who is simply perfect here) sells their characters' immediate attraction to each other. More than anything else, the romance is the driving force of the story. You get invested in what happens to David and Elise, and you pull for David to find a way to stump the Adjustment Bureau, to avoid their recalibration or resetting or whatever it is that they do to you when you get too uppity and challenge fate.

Themes such as predestination and free will are raised, and David Norris must wrestle with two choices, one which will benefit the greater good and the other which preserves his personal happiness. There's even this added dramatic tension in that the Adjustment Bureau is working for the betterment of mankind. As Thompson informs our hero: ""David, you can change the world. But that doesn't happen if you stay with her."" Although, conversely, there's a line of thought which sees the Bureau as these mindless, unquestioning drones. But it's not all angsty navel-gazing. There are some snappy chase scenes, bolstered by some slick special effects. You have to like the seamless visual transitions as the Adjusters navigate supernaturally thru the city by way of these doors that - once activated by the agents' hats - open to other places. And you have to really like it when David gets a hold of one of these hats.

No deep sense of spirituality here or profound reflections on theology, and that's fine. The film was promoted as a romantic sci-fi thriller and I liked that it stuck to its guns. I like that the story earns its emotional moments. David's search for Elise spans years. Three years alone elapse with David every day taking the same bus going down the same route on the slim chance that Elise will one day get onboard (she doesn't). Emily Blunt is so appealing and so sexy that I sort of drowned in her performance. And you couldn't tell at all that she actually isn't a professional dancer; she's so good. You can see why she inspires David to fight for her in epic fashion. To hell with causality. Damn the ripples.

It's unlikely to appeal to everyone - as the reviews clearly show - but I found the story riveting, with a balanced mix of romance, action and suspense. The cast is excellent, and George Nolfi deserves kudos for an impressive directorial debut.

This film has everything many of us want in a movie and then some. It's sci-fi, action, humor, drama, suspense and romance... and only just enough of each genre to make it an enjoyable movie. It's a great date movie, but it's also a great solo movie as well, if you are prone to ""deeper than sheep"" thinking.

The movie makes a very clear statement about theology and our responsibilities as humans... that we have the power to create our own destinies and make our own paths, if we really want to and if we believe in ourselves - instead of believing our fate is predetermined by a higher power or fate.

Unfortunately, we never see the beautiful Emily Blunt or Matt Damon wearing the clothes in which they're pictured on the front cover or the movie poster, which I think is bad marketing... trying to make a movie more physically attractive than it already is. Boo on you, marketing profs!

I was stunned to see that God's workers had the power to open doors and skip to other places but only if they wore hats like Frank Sinatra. Hey, if God is called ""The Chairman"" why not not have them wear ""Chairman of the Board"" hats like Sinatra. You have not lived, in fact, until you have seen Matt Damon in his special Fedora as he scampers around Manhattan, challenging God's plan as he seeks his lady love.

Does this sound bizarre? Don't all men running for the New York senate seat run through New York in a Fedora? Don't all politicians run from beings (also wearing Fedoras) who are given the responsibility to make sure God's complicated plan (the one that makes little sense) is adhered to.

Like ""Inception,"" this movie is built on a created logic where anything can happen. After all, if you write the movie and create your own bizarre reality, who is to say what makes sense and what doesn't.

Wasting several good actors and a relatively sweet love story is excusable but making a drama which easily could have been a great comedy is a waste. If you want to waste time, as Matt Damon did in making this mess, watch it. You will learn to never trust anyone wearing a hat (even a yarmulke, as one of the silly characters says) and that is an essential life lesson.

But after the first moments where my disbelief was seriously taxed (Damon's first contact with the Adjustment Bureau), I found my incredulity rising to the point of sheer hilarity and acceptance of the flow.

I mean, it's nuts.  Note, those who believe in destiny will likely process this film differently from those who don't.  The latter, like me, will probably take a moment to swallow the absurd notion of an adjustment bureau and what it spends its time worrying about.  But once you say, okay, this is a quirky, off-kilter, bizarre love story/fantasy with the good guys at risk from perilous fate-deciders of great power, well...it becomes supremely enjoyable.

Blunt is divine (the first time I saw that about her), and she and Damon have great magnetism.  He does a great job of someone in this scenario, and the drama and tension between them makes it easy to excuse some of the excesses. You've got two people wanting to get together, and a bureau committed to keeping them apart no matter how, and that bureau is severely more powerful (and yet weak in the most knee-smackingly, gleefulyl nutso ways).  Gosh, how could I not find it hilarious?  Its hilarity is part of its absolutely unique charm.  If you don't believe in destiny, just take this as a fun, out-there movie, and you'll enjoy the ride.  I did find my heart rate racing a couple of times.  It's fun, a zinger.

The basic premise (no spoilers) is about a man that gets an accidental peek behind the curtain of reality, thereby becoming a threat to the established order.  The members of the Adjustment Bureau are a blatant rip-off Matrix agents.  They even go so far as to borrow that same stilted speech of the Matrix agents in spots.  Unfortunately, unlike Matrix agents, the Adjusters aren't terribly menacing--or intriguing.  They're more like Disney agents, or something.

The movie also feels like the City of Angels at times as it toys with the idea of freewill, divinity and love conquering all.  However, it never really gains full emotional intensity because the hero's path proves so predictable.  The trailers for the movie practically give you the trajectory of the film before you've begun.

In some respects, I suppose you could accuse Adjustment Bureau of being chick-flick disguised as sci-fi.  Yet somehow the film manages to rise above its flaws and proves entertaining.

The sci-fi element, the Adjustment Bureau, is very well presented and fittingly creepy while also thought provoking as all good sci-fi should be. The key here is that the romance/love interest is not just tacked on to try to lure the female audience in but is essential to the plot. The romance is the plot. And that makes all the difference.

Well acted, well-written, well shot with some very nicely done effects, The Adjustment Bureau does not merely straddle the line between action movie/romance, but, rather, becomes almost a genre unto itself.

All of his work starts with the basic assumption that there cannot be one, single, objective reality. Everything is a matter of perception. The ground is liable to shift under your feet. A protagonist may find himself living out another person's dream, or he may enter a drug-induced state that actually makes better sense than the real world, or he may cross into a different universe completely.'  Given this background information about the origin of the idea of THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU, the story adapted  for the screen from Dick's 'Adjustment Team' by writer/director George Nolfi (The Bourne series, Ocean's Twelve, etc), offers a new appreciation for this well-timed suspense thriller love story - 'Love' being the operative word.

David Norris (Matt Damon) is running for New York Senator guided by the counsel of his friend and campaign manager Charlie (Michael Kelly) and they seem to be on a wining track.  David meets the very beautiful dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) in the strangest of circumstances and their attraction, peppered with very fine comic repartee, is immediately apparently. Past faux pas of David's appear in the media and his chances of winning the election seem to be diminishing.  At this point David meets some hatted gentlemen -  Richardson (John Slattery) and Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie) - who represent the adjustment bureau, a group of men who follow the life plan set by the Chairman to keep people in line with their intended destinies.  David is instructed to never see Elise again as she is not part of his planned life (a career that despite setbacks is supposed to eventually lead to the Presidency of the US). From this point on it becomes a challenge for David to either obey the adjustment team or follow his heart and be with Emily. After a separation of three years David sees Elise again and the fire of love burns even more brightly.  David is warned that if he follows his heart (his free will) he not only will not become the man of his career dreams but that he will also destroy Elise's assigned future of becoming the world's most honored dancer/choreographer.  Which drives succeed and how they happen is a wild chase by David and Elise to run toward their own free will through mazes and secret passages and strange situations a s devised by Richardson, aided by Harry, and controlled by Richardson's replacement, Thompson (Terrance Stamp).  It is a struggle between destiny and free will.

There is a fine line in Philip K. Dick's story ideas that teeters between the credible and the pure sci-fi direction.  In this film the midline is found and the reason the strange story succeeds so well is due in great part to the extraordinary on-screen chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, two actors who continue to grow in stature, having that ability to pull off sophisticated comedy with action packed suspense.  The entire cast is  excellent and seems to be responsive to the well-conceived direction of George Nolfi.  THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is first and foremost a love story, and a very fine one at that. In order to completely appreciate this film the audience must relax and go along with Dick's ideas - then it all seems very right!  Grady Harp, June 11",1308873600,,3734,4.931419457735247

The storyline could've been beefed up more. I felt that when the main character was told that by not being with Elise, she wouldn't be a famous choreographer but instead would be teaching ""6 year olds to dance""...is that really enough to say, ""Okay, gosh, I really must leave her.  She's destined for a life of pain""...I would've point-blank asked her...What was more important to her, our love or her career.  I think we all know what the answer would've been and we would have saved about 7-10 minutes of the movie while he blows her off at the hospital, etc...Even with my quips about this, this movie inspires.  It inspires me to embrace my free will even more and make sure that everyone knows they can exert it to maneuver thru life experiences they want to change.

It's predecessors include Blade Runner, Total Recall, The Imposter, and The Minority Report. Like The Imposter, THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is based on a short story. It's about a man who witnesses something unexplainable and must decide how to react to it. Since the short story (which I reviewed here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adjustment-Bureau/dp/1441894691/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adjustment Bureau</a>) doesn't contain enough for a full-length motion picture, the writers fleshed out the original story and crafted a wonderful treatise on love and self-determination. And it works. Watching it, I was reminded of movie called Made in Heaven where two people search their whole lives for each other because they were in love in Heaven before they were born. That's not exactly what's going on here, but it gives you a flavor. Add the fact that THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU doesn't want them to find each other, and you have a smart, well-paced, science-fiction thriller with a side-order of romance.

Supernatural beings that are representatives of God (or someone/thing similar), require wearing a hat or cap, and and use an ordinary door with doorknob to travel through space and time (and for thousands of years at that) in a physical body (God must have lost interest in the action-at-a-distance routine) with a book (to keep track of things because their memories didn't evolve) in order to effect human destiny is a bit too much (i.e. ludicrous).

Story theme:
The movie is presented as a discourse between free will and consequently self-interest vs. the interests of any other living community (human or otherwise).  The protagonist (Damon) is given the choice of serving ""the people"" and even the environment (he's a solar cell advocate) or serving himself through his pursuit of the one he loves. At first the decision is made for him but then he's allowed to decide then the decision is made for him then he's allowed to decide. Or something like that!

Mother Teresa:
I guess Mother Teresa shouldn't have followed God's suggestion to serve others before herself (at least as the movie would argue).",1308787200,3,1132,4.947368421052632

It's a Romantic Science Fiction film that deals focuses on fate and idea that a power out with our human control is manipulating events and deciding our destiny. Essentially this film is a love story between a hot shot politician (Matt Damon) and a up and coming ballet dancer (Emily Blunt) both on their way to greatness. This film works so well due to chemistry that Damon and Blunt have on screen. Dealing with such controversial concepts such as God and Fate is challenging to convey to an audience, but George Nolfi's seems to have managed to present these themes in a smart and digestible way.

Arguments on fate vs. destiny are fairly black and white and its climax inevitable.

Even after he is told that there are greater things awaiting him, and that it matters to his future and the future of the country that he leaves Elise alone, he still insists on pursuing her.

The 'Adjustment Bureau' are actually the 'Unseen' and 'Unknown' forces that make each individual 'make'
 and 'create' our decisions, or prevent us from doing certain things, or presenting opportunities.

Exactly like the film - missing a bus, or failing to get the girl's number - are all adjustments for a reason.

I first thought the 'agents' running through the doors was crazy - but again a simple analogy... Unseen forces can appear anywhere at anytime... Get it??

The two are not meant to be together. Enter the Adjustment Bureau, an ""agency"" whose sole purpose is to make sure no one deviates from the Master Plan.

I was disappointed when I first saw The Adjustment Bureau. I thought I was sitting down to an espionage / Jason Bourne type movie, and what I got was not what I expected.

However, there were some very strong elements to the movie that drew me to it a second time: ""AB"" is a unique twist on the conventional boy- meets- girl love story... the movie is a hybrid of standard chick- flick and ""Dark City."" There's a philosophical element of free will vs. predestination that runs deep in the film that some will love (myself included) and others will not. Also, the chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is excellent, and I really enjoyed their screen time together. Their characters are very likeable. The chemistry between the two is strong enough that I actually cared whether or not he could outsmart the Adjustment Bureau and find his way back to her without them successfully keeping them apart- resulting in a handful of cross town chase sequences that are highly entertaining.

The DVD sleeve claims it is a ""thriller"" but that's a bit misleading. Yes, the chases are thrilling, but make no mistake: ""AB"" is first and foremost a sci-fi romance, and a relatively light-hearted one.

""AB"" has its shortcomings: I felt the movie tipped its hat too soon: you learn too early into the film who the Adjustment Bureau is (I was expecting that element of the movie to be much more mysterious); and when the big mystery is revealed (why the two protagonists are not meant to be together), I was hoping for more.

Still, ""AB"" is a very enjoyable movie with enough ""meat"" on its ""bones"" to provide plenty of interesting conversation after the credits role. It also has good re-watch value, the kind of movie you can throw in any time when you want something different but not overly heavy.",1306800000,4,2102,4.639784946236559

4123369,3,B003GAMOIW,"This was a very average film. The premise was interesting, but nothing was really done with it. It had the potential to be something like ""Dark City"" but it wasn't. What I really can't figure out is how this film could possibly have had a budget of 50 million dollars. That seems like a whole lot for so little.

Matt Daemon uses the film to play around with his fantasies of being a politican and to preach. And according to the old formula, that requires that he be the good working-class kid from the old neighborhood in Brooklyn who suddenly rises to the top of New York politics. But no matter how many times he tries and how bad he wants it, Daemon can't come across as working class. His entire family is conveiently dead at the start of the film which further reduces him to something like a cipher. He seems to be either fantastically rich in the film or a sponge supported by his childhood friend become venture capitalist. But thats all noble because they talk about investing money in alternative energy. Alternative energy investment has become the magic water in popular culture that washes away all moral problems from characters that would otherwise be seen as greedy wall street hustlers.

Daemon's political delusions run all the way up to being president. He is such a great guy that god himself has picked him to inevitably lead the country in the film. Daemon's egotism run amok weighs really heavy against the film. Its difficult to find any redeeming features in the character he plays.

The heart of the film is basically a frustrated love story. He meets a dancer and its love at first sight. But they can't be together because of the effect it would have on their careers. The unintentional unexplored irony in the story is that either of them could have had love if one or the other had been willing to sacrifice their career ambitions for love. But egos being what they are, sacrifice is an alien concept. They want it all and if they have to resort to a childish tantrum to get it all, so be it. In the end, Daemon is willing to storm the gates of heaven for love but he isn't willing to give up being President to do it. Its a weakness in the film's plot and a rather nasty comment on modern culture.

To work, the love story in the film has to work. But it doesn't. Its all really shallow like both of their characters.

The film is also supposed to be a study of free will in life. But the film lacks any subtilty in the examining that. Every manipulation is blindingly obvious to both the characters and to the viewer. There are no real surprises to speak of with it. Nothing clever done with it.

For costing 50 million dollars, this was a remarkably simple film. There appeared to be no sets to speak of. I think there was all of two effects in the film. And the speaking cast was remarkably small. John Slattery does a good job with his part. Terence Stamp delivers whats expected of him.

If your looking for two hours of entertainment, its better than most. But there is nothing special or great about it.

Matt meets a girl and they immediately hit it off, however they were never supposed to meet again as that would change the game plan. When they do, it sends ripples through that ultimate game plan, apparently flexibility is not one of the Chairman's virtues. The movie is about them trying to be together vs. fate keeping them apart. It is perhaps more of a love story than anything else. For people who believe in a higher power, it is as thought provoking as the book of Job and make it a 4 star movie.

This movie has no great special effects as Matrix, no fast speed fighting, no great sound track, no nudity, no sex (just implied) and I don't recall any F-bombs.",1305936000,,1196,4.58411214953271

  This movie is a very average science fiction story.  Taken as that, it is not very good.  I take it as one of the best love stories I have ever seen.  The chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is dynamite.  I am captivated by Emily Blunt whom I think should become a genuine super star.  I have seen the movie three times.

4123374,3,B003GAMOIW,"It is a film with good intentions, but the plot could have gone deeper. I went in expecting more of a thought provoking movie about a mysterious group that knows everything about us and can change our world as they please. within the first thirty minutes we are told what they are in a pretty unexciting way and there is no mystery left to what they are doing throughout the rest of the film. Also I thought the way the bureau was explained was too feel-good yet vague. So the rest of the movie centers around a love story, which never really feels like the actors believe they're destined to be together, however, we are constantly told they are. Towards the end when the two lovers are breaking all the rules to be together it just starts to feel too sappy and fairytale-like, and I mean that there is no rational thought to their decisions, instead it just seems everything works out for the best and they live happily ever after.

This movie could have been written a little better, especially to round out the adjustment bureau and make them more interesting.

Talking of which, Terence Stamp little speech is really delightful!

LOVE would-it be THE answer ?

That is already a reflection about CHOICE, THE choices we make (or think we make) everyday, and which commit ourselves in a short or long term.  Choice of Life, of way of Beeing, of Lover(so!); and above all, about the consequences of these choices (Domino effect) that we are supposed to take like a responsible adult.

Keeping the movie mind, Believer or not, which is, really, our room for manoeuvre, beetween Chance, Fate and Free-Will??

By the way, it's interesting that Matt's first name is David, a famous biblical character, who fought against Goliath, invincible giant, and defeated him, against all expectations...

Now, about the movie, everyone can question about the processing of the matter, script, directing, interpretation... In my point of view, the film would have been better if it has been rougher and more sensual; but I supposed it must be for general public!??  Personnally, like it is, I thought that pleasant!

But get down on Earth and let appreciate the show: Matt Damon, determined, rush around very much, a little bit of good shape from 'Jason Bourne' probably, but still remains credible and attractive, yes indeed(!), like a young, evolving and ambitious politician.

He make a touching couple with the 'cute-body' and charming Emily Blunt, a promising dancer in a striking and spicy girl! Emily worked hard: the modern ballet scenes are magnificent!  Their mutual scenes, all of them really successful, show a indisputable Chemistry between them.  They are the best of that movie, in my humble opinion...

Don't miss the first meeting, in the beginning...  It's really moving  to see them, touched and surprised by this unexpected 'Love at first Sight', and more than that, terrified and dazzled to recognize themselves like two Soul Mates...  Everyone's Dream, yes??

4123376,2,B003GAMOIW,"""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a blend of genres: Science Fiction, Romance, Political Thriller. For the first forty mintues, the film seems to not really know what it is, beginning, oddly, as a portrait of a young politician, the personable yet rowdy David Norris (Matt Damon). Unfortunately for Norris, it seems his political career may be over after a picture of his butt emerges in the newspaper. However, after a chance (or is it fate?) encounter in the men's bathroom with none other than the beautiful Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt), he is inspired to make the single best political concession speech of his career, a sort of expos on the phoniness of politics.

Too much time is devoted to his political campaigns, with interviews from various cable news entities (Jon Stewart) thrown in there in an attempt at authenticity. All the while, we're occasionally seeing glimpses of sinister, middle aged men in trench coats and fedoras, and an overall sense that something is amiss. These men (?) walk in synchronized fashion, as if rods were up their butts, and occasionally share in small, awkward conversations with each other e.g. ""You should take some time off; even WE need vacations sometimes"". These adroit, uncomfortable beings are apparently angels, or something. ""Some have called us that"", says Anthony Mackie, straining to maintain a straight face. They are members of The Adjustment Bureau, a team of supernatural business men who control everything. Yes, everything. For reasons unknown, it is of the utmost importance that David Norris not fall in love with Elise Sellas, and whenever Norris attempts to be with her, he is thwarted by this mysterious bunch.

The worst parts of Adjustment Bureau are without a doubt when the bureaucrats attempt to explain their existence. ""What about free will?"" bursts Damon, in a fit of bewilderment. They explain that they've tried free will, but humans have a tendency to screw things up when left to their own devices (hence, this movie). ""We (the adjustment bureau) brought you to the height of the Roman Empire"", explains a deadpan Terrence Stamp. ""Then, we stepped back. We watched as you destroyed yourselves; the fall of the Roman Empire, the dark ages. Then we came back in, and gave you the Renaissance, the Enlightenment. Then in 1910, we stepped back again, and watched you descend into World War I, World War II, and then bring yourselves to the brink of destruction with the Cuban Missile Crisis. Since then, we've stepped back in, before you altered the plan so irreversibly that even we wouldn't be able to save you"". Well, he knows his history! Not only is it absurd to think that this supernatural bureau went back and forth between controlling human behavior and giving us free will. But also, I guess we're supposed to assume that all of the atrocities that occurred while under the influence of the bureau were, actually, performed according to a devised plan? Slavery, the Civil War, Vietnam, September 11- these are all events that apparently occurred under the Bureau's divine influence. ""Do you ever wonder if the plan is wrong?"" submits the bold Anthony Mackie. Hmmmm, let's think about that. Or better yet, let's not.

The movie then descends into laughable parody. The bureaucrats can open doors, and travel to any location through the doorways, as long as they're wearing their magical fedoras. This makes for some ridiculous chase scenes through baseball fields, banks, and my personal favorite, the Statue of Liberty. ""Teach me how to use the doors"", says Matt Damon, in a pivotal scene. Spoiler alert: all you need is a fedora, and to turn the doorknob clockwise. The bureaucrats are so powerful, and can do so many things, that it is often extremely frustrating to watch how horribly incompetent they are. Haven't they been doing this for thousands of years? Even Terrence Stamp, the bureaucrat whose nickname is ""The Hammer"", has a tough time quelling the unstoppable force that is Matt Damon.

The saddest part about ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is that there's potential here for a good movie. Matt Damon is excellent as the likable politician, and the chemistry between Damon and Emily Blunt is solid. I truly think this would have been a better movie if there was no adjustment bureau, and it was simply about a young politician forming a relationship which could potentially threaten his political career. I wish I could adjust this movie's fate, abandoning it's silly premise for a simpler, better one. But I can't. Why? Because I don't own a fedora.",1302393600,14,4532,4.974934036939314

The story follows David Norris (Matt Damon), a popular politician who is running for senator. He's at the head of the election race until some college photos of himself pulling pranks are leaked and damage his chances of winning badly.

On the election night, it's already pretty clear that David's chances of winning are none. So while practicing his (Loosing) speech in the men's bathroom, he meets a girl named Elise who is hiding from security after crashing a wedding.

4123379,5,B003GAMOIW,"""Some things are meant to be."" Sure, you've heard that phrase before, but just who was it that meant them to be? And how will that be enforced?

This brilliant movie starts by assuming an answer that second question: The Adjustment Bureau makes sure things turn out according to The Plan. David Norris (Matt Damon's outstandingly played character) encounters a dancer (portrayed beautifully by Emily Blunt), and mutual infatuation strikes in a heartbeat. Their affection is not part of The Plan, however. It must be stopped. Then, in an unrelated thread of the story, Norris discovers the Bureau's workings.

Soon enough, they're working against him. This keeps a more credible tone than most action movies - no block-buster stunts, no guns, no explosions. Special effects appear in a very few places, neatly done but with a light touch that I appreciate. All that lets the raw characters come through, a Kafka-like sense of vast and unseen powers. Instead of submitting to the faceless forces, however, Damon and Blunt confront them. Although that familiar foreboding echoes many other paranoid fantasy movies, the heroes' determination against those forces keeps the story fresh. I recommend this one highly.

The negative part of this review is that, I would've liked if they explained the concept a bit more thoroughly.  I'm a kind of guy who wants to understand not only the plot but the concept of the movie itself.  Such movies like Equilibrium, The Matrix trilogy, Inception, etc. go more in depth with the concept and details.  In my opinion I thought the ""notebook"" could've had more explanation to it and how certain loop holes are figured out.  On top of that, I was looking for more action and ""mind-boggling"" scenes, but found myself watching a more romantic film.  I'm a little nitpicky I admit.  A movie that COULD'VE been an Oscar nominated film, falls short.  The Pro of this movie is the plot, I like the idea of how fate is created and or ""adjusted"" by an organization.

4123382,1,B003GAMOIW,"If you would like to know my take on ""The Adjustment Bureau,"" please continue reading.  If you consider comments to be ""spoilers,"" please stop reading right now....

In Spiderman II, Aunt Mae has a few words for Peter Parker, who has temporarily resigned from his superhero role: ""Lord knows, kids...need a hero -- courageous, self-sacrificing people....I believe there's a hero in all of us...that keeps us honest...gives us strength...makes us noble...and finally allows us to die with pride, even though sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing we want the most - even our dreams.""  Personally, I think those are among the most profound comments to ever come out of Hollywood!

In my religious tradition, much has been written, spoken, and lived about surrendering our will to God's will.  The incredible ""paradox,"" if you will, is that true, genuine happiness is found in this surrender.  How could it be otherwise?  God wants the absolute, absolute best for us; God knows what will bring us true happiness far, far better than we do ourselves.

I am inserting another ""spoiler"" warning right here.  On a deeper level, Spiderman II's Aunt Mae seems to be talking about surrendering our will to God's will.  Here comes my absolute ""spoiler"" warning....

To me, the message of ""The Adjustment Bureau"" seemed to be that God should surrender His will to our will.",1300060800,10,1375,4.934782608695652
4123383,3,B003GAMOIW,"This was a very average film. The premise was interesting, but nothing was really done with it. It had the potential to be something like ""Dark City"" but it wasn't. What I really can't figure out is how this film could possibly have had a budget of 50 million dollars. That seems like a whole lot for so little.

Matt Daemon uses the film to play around with his fantasies of being a politican and to preach. And according to the old formula, that requires that he be the good working-class kid from the old neighborhood in Brooklyn who suddenly rises to the top of New York politics. But no matter how many times he tries and how bad he wants it, Daemon can't come across as working class. His entire family is conveiently dead at the start of the film which further reduces him to something like a cipher. He seems to be either fantastically rich in the film or a sponge supported by his childhood friend become venture capitalist. But thats all noble because they talk about investing money in alternative energy. Alternative energy investment has become the magic water in popular culture that washes away all moral problems from characters that would otherwise be seen as greedy wall street hustlers.

Daemon's political delusions run all the way up to being president. He is such a great guy that god himself has picked him to inevitably lead the country in the film. Daemon's egotism run amok weighs really heavy against the film. Its difficult to find any redeeming features in the character he plays.

The heart of the film is basically a frustrated love story. He meets a dancer and its love at first sight. But they can't be together because of the effect it would have on their careers. The unintentional unexplored irony in the story is that either of them could have had love if one or the other had been willing to sacrifice their career ambitions for love. But egos being what they are, sacrifice is an alien concept. They want it all and if they have to resort to a childish tantrum to get it all, so be it. In the end, Daemon is willing to storm the gates of heaven for love but he isn't willing to give up being President to do it. Its a weakness in the film's plot and a rather nasty comment on modern culture.

To work, the love story in the film has to work. But it doesn't. Its all really shallow like both of their characters.

The film is also supposed to be a study of free will in life. But the film lacks any subtilty in the examining that. Every manipulation is blindingly obvious to both the characters and to the viewer. There are no real surprises to speak of with it. Nothing clever done with it.

For costing 50 million dollars, this was a remarkably simple film. There appeared to be no sets to speak of. I think there was all of two effects in the film. And the speaking cast was remarkably small. John Slattery does a good job with his part. Terence Stamp delivers whats expected of him.

If your looking for two hours of entertainment, its better than most. But there is nothing special or great about it.",1300060800,,3043,4.462230215827338
4123384,4,B003GAMOIW,"The Adjustment Bureau, directed by George Nolfi and starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt, is something of a rarity - a romance movie within a sci-fi setting that actually works. The reason for this is that while The Adjustment Bureau is nominally based on a short story - ""The Adjustment Team"" - by Philip K. Dick, at its heart its true roots are to be found in Michael Powell's 1946 romantic fantasy film Stairway To Heaven (also known by its original UK title A Matter Of Life And Death), where two people who meet by chance and fall in love must deal with divine powers bent on seperating them.

A rising young New York politician, David Norris (Matt Damon), on election night of his first senate bid, has a chance meeting with a young dancer Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) that changes his life. But unfortunately he comes away from the encounter with only her first name and nothing else, leaving him no way of finding her. One morning, a short time later, we become aware that a group of men, all wearing hats, seem to be taking a strange interest in Norris. One of them, who goes by the name of Harry (Anthony Mackie), has been given the strange assignment of making sure Norris spills his coffee on himself by 7:05AM. Things, however, do not go as planned, and as a result, two things happen:  (1) Norris runs into Elise on the bus, this time getting her phone number, and (2) Norris inadvertently stumbles across the existence of the Men In Hats in the act of manipulating events in his life. And is told by them that he must never reveal what he has learned to anyone, and that he must never see Elise again because it's not part of their plan for him. And because seeing her will not only ruin their plans for him, it'll ruin the bright future they have planned for her as well.

The cast is excellent and is a large part of what makes The Adjustment Bureau work.  Matt Damon and Emily Blunt project a believable chemistry of two people who from the first moment know they were always meant to be together. John Slattery (best known from TV's Mad Men) is perfect as Richardson, the officious leader of the team of agents managing Norris' life. Terrence Stamp is marvelous as always as Thompson, the hard-nosed trouble shooter nicknamed ""The Hammer"" who is brought in when things really go awry. But it is Anthony Mackie who gives the movie a lot of its heart as Harry, the low-key agent with doubts about the plan. Mackie never raises his voice, never lets Harry's feelings show on his face, but conveys everything with his subtly expressive eyes.

There are also a host of cameos of public figures from the political and media arenas, meant I suppose to make things more realistic, but in truth they're incidental, particularly in a film like this where a good deal of suspension of disbelief is necessary.  Still, some people will have fun seeing how many they can spot. I counted at least eight.

As enjoyable as The Adjustment Bureau is, it does require certain periodic suspensions of disbelief which I cannot dwell on without revealing certain parts of the plot. And while it does at least toy with questions of free-will vs predestined fate, in the end it is a romance story and does opt for the ending that most easily satisfies. It might have been a deeper, more complex movie if Nolfi had had Norris make a less conventional choice, either choosing to stay with the plan the Men In Hats have laid out for him, giving up love for career, or sacrificing his own chance at happiness so that Elise can have the grand career he knows is awaiting her.

Anyone who has seen Stairway To Heaven will instinctively know how this all turns out.  Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good love-conquers-all romance story set in a very different reality from the one we know.",1300060800,45,3783,4.559646539027982

4123390,2,B003GAMOIW,It's a fine idea for a film but the idea never takes flight.  It feels all a little bit too flat and uninspired.,1299369600,4,112,3.869565217391304
4123391,5,B003GAMOIW,"Based very loosely on the short story by Phillip K. Dick's short start the Adjustment Team, Adjustment Bureau is on it's own pretty much after the first 25 minutes//story wise story wise. You may know Dick's hand in the sci-fi hits as the classic Blade Runner and the not so classic Total Recall. But what they do have in common with Bureau like most of Phillip K. Dick's work there's one big mindfrak after another. This is a timely release after the success of the equally trippy ""Inception."" The premise of things not being what they seem mix with a unrequited and ill-fated romance that should never be, the romantic angle is where the short story stretches to feature length.  Matt Daemon's character learned the hard way that ""Sometimes Being early is just as bad as being late."" David Norris, a would be US senator, president even, brought back from the brink of ending his political career by a speech  inspired by a woman, Elise (Emily Blunt),who encouraged him to be more honest, later he meets her again on a bus he was ""fated"" to miss, he then arrives to a meeting on time but he witnesses situational ""fixers"" in stylish hats no human was meant to see. This is explained to his as is that he must never see the girl again, nor tell of the Bureau's existence. He is also told that ""the plan,"" made by someone they refer to as ""the Chairman"" must be followed. They warn Norris if he tells anyone he will be ""reset"", a personality lobotomy. Norris spends the next three years riding the same bus before finding the woman again, and he must risk threats that the two will lose their dreams as well as overcome the strange suited forces working to keep them apart with the advise and aid of his own bureau guardian angel Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie).

The report between Matt and Emily is as fun and solid, even believable, as that between Matt and Mackie, the other suit ""antagonists have equally superb banter, especially Mr. Richardson (John Slattery) and Terrance Stamp as the Bureau's own Mr. Wolf-style fixer... The Hammer even. The movie may not answer any lofty questions about free-will, but it is a cool ride and leaves you with an uncanny fear of guys in hats. But heed you this, if you want to leak any spoilers best do it from some place near water.

Insert Emergency reset here.",1299369600,2,2303,4.58252427184466
4123392,4,B003GAMOIW,"Based on a  Philip K. Dick short story, The Adjustment Bureau has romance and action going for it, with a touch of comedy and philosophy, too. It's science fiction, but unlike the futuristic Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Minority Report (also films based on Dick's works), it's set in the present.

Basically, the film poses this question: Can free will, determination, and love triumph over determinism? Matt Damon is a young politician on the rise, who is programmed to do well with the public, with everything he does selected by consultants, who run things by focus groups--right down to which tie he wears. Emily Blunt (who plays a dancer) is there to inspire him to make a great concession speech, and then is supposed to vanish from his life, but the Adjustment Bureau (charged with making sure the right events occur, with the right people in power) screws up, and they fall in love.

Damon and Blunt are terrific as the romantic leads, and Terence Stamp, Anthony Mackie, and John Slattery (all of whom must wear fedoras, which allow them to get through special doors to do their adjustment work quickly in New York City, in which the film takes place) are good in supporting roles.

This is an entertaining and moving film, which somehow imparts enjoyment without the usual explosions and long car chases, although there are a couple of scenes which drag on a bit. All in all, I recommend this film for its romance, action sequences, good acting, and decent direction.",1299369600,2,1479,4.811023622047244
4123393,2,B003GAMOIW,"""The Adjustment Bureau"" addresses favorite, and much-contested, themes: the role of fate, or chance, or free will in our lives. Theologians, scientists, theists and atheists have puzzled over these questions for thousands of years. The film posits an official bureaucracy that massages everyday human activities - whether or not rising young political star David Norris (Matt Damon) spills coffee on his shirt during his morning commute through a park, whether Elise Sallas (Emily Blunt), a dancer, falls and sprains her ankle onstage - in order to achieve the outcomes the Adjustment Bureau desires. It's a fantastic premise, which the film thoroughly wastes.

David Norris is a rising political star; Elise Sallas is a rising dancer. They meet and fall in love at first sight. Their love defies the desired ends of the Adjustment Bureau. The Adjustment Bureau may be carrying out the will of God, and its caseworkers may be angels. The film never makes it clear. Hats give the Adjustment Bureau's caseworkers their power. Yes, hats, exactly the kind of snap-brim hat that Frank Sinatra made famous in the 1950s. (Thus the title of the tribute book, ""The Way You Wear Your Hat."") Too, Adjustment Bureau case workers refer to their boss, who may be God, as ""The Chairman."" They don't mean Mao - this must be a reference to Sinatra, nicknamed ""Chairman of the Board."" I'm sorry, but this film was so boring, it sent my mind down these trails.

When the Adjustment Bureau made its presence known, and revealed its near omnipotence over David Norris' fate, I didn't care. I felt no anxiety for David or Elise. The film evoked no sense of mystery, not even the shiver you get when you think of a friend and that friend immediately phones you. I kept thinking of other films that introduced supernatural, fate-altering others into average mortal's lives. Cary Grant as the angel Dudley in ""The Bishop's Wife"" caused more of a sense of wonder and awe. In ""Portrait of Jenny,"" another movie about a fated relationship, there's a scene of ice-skaters in Central Park. The scene is very wholesome and suitable for family viewing. It's shot in black and white. Even so, with no special effects, it creates a powerful sense of the weird that ""Adjustment Bureau"" never matches.

Matt Damon plays, as he always does, Matt Damon: an oversmart, internal guy who keeps his cards close to his chest and doesn't so much relate to others as manipulate them to his own purposes. He was brilliant at this in ""Good Will Hunting"" and he's been good at it ever since.

Emily Blunt is not his best partner. She's a great dominatrix, as she was in ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" or ""Young Victoria."" Her crispness never penetrates Damon's emotional armor, as did Minnie Driver in ""Hunting"" with her over-the-top emotionality.

I never felt that David and Elise were experiencing the kind of love worthy of the risks they take in the movie, and I really did not care whether they were together at the end or not.

Because the movie didn't grab me, I noticed all the plot holes I would not have seen had I been swept up in movie magic. The Adjustment Bureau teams are thrown off their game by rain. But they're shown to be almost omnipotent. Why rain? Throw me a bone, here! Hats make them powerful? HATS? There are simply too many Adjustment Bureau personnel. They're like a bumbling team of Keystone Cops, chasing about, and accomplishing very little. They don't intimidate or impress us. They don't make us go, ""Wow!""

Any discussion of fate, chance, free will and God invokes huge questions. Why does God allow the innocent to suffer, for example? Do we really control our own fates, or are we merely puppets in the hands of the Gods? The movie attempts to address this in a monologue by Terence Stamp. He says that the height of civilization was the Roman Empire. Yes, that same Roman Empire that crucified six thousand slaves along the Appian Way, and entertained its masses with scenes of wild animals feasting on human flesh. Stamp then denigrates the so-called ""Dark Ages,"" a misnomer intended to make the Christian Europe that arose after the fall of the Roman Empire look bad. Oh, how silly.

In order to establish that David Norris is a man on the move, the film uses fake news clips of real personalities, including Jon Stewart and other television news commentators. The careful and extensive inclusion of these real personalities betrays the film's failure. Who cares if Jon Stewart is in a movie about love, fate, God, chance? Don't give me Jon Stewart and Mary Matalin; I can see them on TV. Make a work of art that makes me think something I've never thought before.",1299369600,8,4650,4.782067247820672
4123394,5,B003GAMOIW,I love Matt Damon in this movie. This is his best role since the Bourne movies. This movie has a good mix of thriller and romance. The chemistry between Emily Blunt and Matt Damon was great. I can't wait to buy it on DVD.,1299369600,3,221,4.045454545454546
4123395,3,B003GAMOIW,"I was looking for a way to kill some time today and it was either The Adjustment Bureau or Rango. Since I wasn't in the mood for animation and after reading more good than bad reviews, I went with this mixing of multiple genres. You have your thriller and sci-fi elements, but also a larger than expected dose of romance.

As shown countless times in the trailers, we are all being watched and adjusted by a mysterious group of people. They remind me of the bald Observer characters on the great TV show Fringe. They keep us on track to hopefully maximize our individual potential and to prevent the human race as a whole from utter destruction. Matt Damon's character is a politician running for Senate and falls for a girl, played by Emily Blunt, which clashes with such plan. Thanks to a mistake from one of the observing agents, he meets her again on a bus by chance and The Adjustment Bureau will stop at nothing to make sure their connection is severed.

Damon and Blunt are both likeable and have decent chemistry, but there just is not enough material to really sink your teeth into. It would have worked better as maybe a 30-45 minute segment in an anthology. Still, the idea behind the film is pretty cool and I was never bored, even though the pacing isn't what anyone would call fast. I don't regret seeing it, but I wish it would have been on a much smaller screen. This is one you can wait three months for.",1299283200,4,1421,4.440613026819923
4123396,4,B003GAMOIW,"There's a scene in ""Citizen Kane"" where one of the characters mentions seeing a beautiful girl on a trolley and he regrets not sitting next to her, and not one day goes by where he doesn't think of that girl. We all have experiences and memories like that, we wonder what our lives would have been like if we did sit next to that girl, or if we did talk to her, or get her number (undoubtedly, we lay more importance on these experiences than they may deserve. They're giant `what if' moments in our lives, the path not taken). But what if that moment of decision is the intrusion of destiny or fate? And we we're supposed to be with that person? That is the theme of ""The Adjustment Bureau.""

David Norris (Matt Damon) is a fast rising Congressman with a great political future.  As he is set to win his race for the Senate, a revelation comes out that puts his whole political future in question. He goes into a men's room to rehearse his concession speech and meets Elise (Emily Blunt) and they feel that instant attraction of `knowing' they should be together. But circumstances pull them apart, or do they? The next day David catches an adjustment team, headed by Richardson (John Slattery) looking like he kept the wardrobe from ""Mad Men."" The only reason Norris witnesses this is because the adjuster assigned to him, Harry Mitchell (Anthony Mackie), was literally asleep on the job. Richardson convinces David that it's for the best that he forget he ever saw them and that he should forget ever meeting Elise or else his destiny won't be fulfilled. Of course David can't stop thinking of Elise and sets out to find her, and the right to choose the course of his life.

""The Adjustment Bureau"" is based on a Philip K. Dick short story.  For the past thirty years or so Hollywood has been availing themselves of the topsy-turvy worlds Dick created. Some of the more successful of those being ""Blade Runner,"" ""Total Recall,"" and ""A Scanner Darkly."" Where does ""The Adjustment Bureau"" fit in? Right in the middle with ""Paycheck"" Ben Affleck's Philip K. Dick based movie. Philip K. Dick's novels and short stories can really turn your head around. Dick turned reality on its head in his stories and usually turned that reality in on itself too. ""The Adjustment Bureau"" takes on the challenge of free will versus fate, and while it plays with it a bit it doesn't turn your head around, and leaves it a pretty simple discussion.

The acting in ""The Adjustment Bureau"" is fine. There are no emotional pyrotechnics or great ranges explored but the characters are believable, and the chemistry between Damon and Blunt is palpable. When they kiss at their first meeting you feel the intimacy and impulsiveness of the moment.

""The Adjustment Bureau"" is a nice light movie to provoke a little post movie discussion or a nice adventure and peek behind reality's curtain. It just might be your destiny to see this movie if you make the choice to.",1299283200,160,2941,4.6461538461538465
4123397,4,B003GAMOIW,"I'm a big fan of Phillip K. Dick movies, and Matt Damon's work so I was already pre-disposed to liking this movie before I saw a minute of film. It was hard for me to see Damon as a New Yorker after all the Boston tie-ins he has had over the years. It is also hard for me to see Damon as a normal middle aged man after his run in the Bourne trilogy. To me Damon is Bourne and Boston all the time, but that was only mildly distracting as he is a very capable actor. Another aspect I didn't like was I felt the technology in the movie wasn't updated enough to fit modern day (they used books and library shelves instead of ipads and server racks). However, going for the more modern setting may have ultimately ended up a disaster and strayed too far from PKD's original story, so I'm willing to forgive them on that point.

I did ""jump"" once during the movie and have one ""wow"" moment at Yankee Stadium, which is the reason why we go to the movies in the first place right. It took me out of my ordinary life for an hour, but also made me think about free will and destiny to the point that my brain got a bit of a work out. The plot centers around all those ""what if"" moments of one man's life which invariably forces the viewer to run down the list of ""what if's"" in their own life. The ending had more bite than I expected, and left me feeling very inspired.  As fun or dreadful as the personal ""what if"" thought experiment was for an hour, most of us have to go back to the same job on Monday as we left on Friday, so enjoy the ride while you can.",1299196800,3,1550,4.029220779220779
4123398,3,B003GAMOIW,"I enjoyed this film, but I have to say straight off that it is in a genre and a style that I like. The performances by Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Anthony Mackie are first-rate and it was good to see Terence Stamp in an important role. The story is pretty well summarized in the comments above the reviews and it would be hard to say more without giving the plot away.

I suspect that this will be a movie that people either like or dislike, with little middle ground. The premise is either intriguing or too bizarre to be taken seriously, depending on each viewer's philosophical convictions. However, the tale is well realized and moves along at a good pace and not the least of its charms is the tour of New York that it gives us.

I only rate it three stars for a couple of reasons. First, the original story by Philip K. Dick was only a novelette and it is somewhat short of twists and turns. Once we have grasped what is going on, which is about a third of the way into the movie, nothing much changes and it becomes a tad predictable. Although this isn't a long movie (it runs 99 minutes) the material is a little thin to keep the audience wondering what will happen next. The other issue is that the ending, although neatly resolved, is a little too pat. There is nothing left for the viewers to decide on for themselves.

I certainly feel this is a good way to spend a couple of hours. You may find that there isn't much to it beyond that.",1299196800,3,1448,4.258181818181818
