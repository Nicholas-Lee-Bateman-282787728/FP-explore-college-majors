Albeit the DVD is in German without subtitles but if you pay attention it is very easy to understand the concept discussed. The visual quality is good,the original films are over 70 years old but on DVD it is not a disappointment. If you are history buff, a WW 2 reenactor, a veteran or just curious this set of DVD will a great investment.",1394668800,,475,4.6
