8257591,5,B001556EN6,"Brilliantly told account of the largest prison escape from a Nazi camp in WWII.  As you might imagine, the subject matter is difficult and there is violence, but it isn't graphic.  It's a suspenseful tale that will leave you marveling at the courage of those trying to escape.  I highly recommend this film with a caveat that it may be too intense for viewers unable to reconcile what the Nazis did.",1386201600,,399,4.591549295774648

condition of a Nazi Concentration Camp in excellent
fashion.  Very moving at times at what the prisoners
