1072415,5,6305799687,"I just watched this movie on UPN last night, and I couldn't tear myself away from the TV. As a single father, this movie hit very close to home.  The things the little girl did to match up her father were hilarious!  Excellent performances by James Earl Jones, as the judge, Yasmine Bleeth as  Holly. Also the little girl has come a long way from Welch's juice  commercials! A very stunning performance on her part.  This is an  excellent movie for the entire family to watch.",966124800,,476,4.476744186046512
1072416,5,6305799687,Undercover Angel is such a great movie. It is so funny and it is a perfect family movie. I highly recommend it. It is one of the best movies I have  ever watched. Buy the DVD. It is very very funny and Emily Mae Young is so  adorable. You won't regret it.,966038400,,255,3.8846153846153846
1072417,4,6305799687,"This video has a lot going for it. Dean Winters is adorable in this *very* un Oz like role. He's funny, playful, and tender. Everything you'd want for  a dad for your child. Yasmine Bleeth is good. James Earl Jones is good. The  story is sweet enough for kids, but not so bad as to make a grown up's  teeth rot out.
But, and this is important, there are some *major* holes  in the movie. First off, you've got a too busy mom with a new beau who  doesn't like kids. So off she goes to Canada, leaving Jenny with a perfect  stranger (for Jenny at least). Who would do this?  Then, after Jenny falls  in love with Harrison, who she finds out is her real dad, mom comes back  and makes Jenny leave without even a hug from her father. Who is that  unfeeling?
Harrison is told he needs money to fight for custody. He  becomes a published writer during the course of the movie. Once he has  money, he tries to win full custody of his daughter. Only, why didn't he  just move to Canada himself? A writer can write anywhere. Why go through a  trial and everything else when he simply could have moved to Canada. This  really bothered me because if he really loved his daughter, he'd have  moved.
I did like this movie, though. The love story between father and  daughter was very nice and very believable. The growing romance between  Harrison and Holly was also sweet and believable. At first viewing, Jenny  seemed to be over acting quite a bit. With repeated viewings, though, her  acting seems to get ""better"". I think she's over acting to seem  older, more grown up because mom's beau doesn't like kids. Once she and her  dad start falling in love, she starts behaving more child like. And  realistic.
My biggest complaint remains Harrison's unwillingness to move  to Canada. Other than that, this is a good movie and I plan on buying it as  soon as the price goes down.",966038400,5,1866,4.4017595307917885
1072418,5,6305799687,"This movie has something for everyone.  Emily Mae Young is perfect as a little girl who is forced to temporarily live with her mother's ex-boyfriend (who turns out to be her father).  Dean Winters is amazing,  and the rest of the cast pulls of performaces worthy of this film.
The  little girl playing matchmaker is what makes the film so special, as the  antics she will do and  the things that she will say in order to see that  it happens her way.  This movie is something for everyone, and nothing in  this movie is disappointing, nothing.",962323200,,543,4.515463917525773

1072697,2,6305799687,"I'm normally a sucker for tear-jerkers. This didn't give me one single tear. The story is too unbelievable.

Forget the weird start of the movie, where you are to see a bit of the stuff a not-published writer put together.

Six years old Jenny is brought by her mother to stay with her old boyfriend, that writer. She hides the fact that he is the child's father. So far so good. But then the character of this little girl is totally unbelievable. A six year old would never speak the way she speaks or act the way she acts, not even copied from the boring mother. Nine or ten would have been a little bit more realistic.

But that such a young child would come up with the idea and be able to execute that idea that her father's bedtime story should be read by a publisher, find a stranger to type it for her, and that the publishing house would read it almost the day after they got it, instead of the months they let one wait normally, is just plain stupid. And then it is published amazingly quickly and so on.

For those who do want to see this movie, I will not write down all the completely unrealistic moves this script makes, so not to spoil your 'fun'. But I will inform you that the emotions portrayed by the adult lead actors are like chicken soup without chicken. They either do not seem realistic or the actors are not able enough to live them out for us adequately. Even the love story is put together without much hindrance of psychological insight.

The little child herself is already an amazing actress. So that's why I gave this movie two stars instead of one.",1383782400,,1580,4.342372881355932
1072698,5,6305799687,"UNDERCOVER ANGEL is a story of a technical writer, who tries writing murder-mystery manuscripts on the side, and who receives delivery of a six year old girl. The girl, intelligent and articulate beyond her years, is quiet at first, and the writer is somewhat grumpy at first. The girl's mother, an attorney with dual U.S. and Canadian citizen ship, drops the six year old girl at the writer's apartment. At a cafe, the girl spontaneously acts as a match-maker between the technical writer and a secretary at the next table. The secretary has a dog, and she spends an hour at the out-of-door cafe every day or so. The viewer will be charmed by the words that are stuffed into the 6-year old's mouth by the screenwriter. For example, the girl refers to the secretary at the next table, and accuses the writer of ""drooling"" over the secretary. (Any viewer of this movie will agree that the actress playing the secretary is smokin' hot. Yasmine Bleeth plays the hottie.)  SPOILER ALERT:  IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW HOW THE STORY TURNS OUT, THEN DO NOT READ THIS.  That said, it should be added that there is not any real ""surprising ending"" in this story.  This story is not like a TWILIGHT ZONE story, where most of the plot hinges on a ""surprise ending.""

THE TAPE RECORDER. At any rate, the plot takes an unexpected and creative turn, when the 6-year old girl decides to activate a pocket tape recorder during her bedtime story. As part of the plot, the writer and the girl readily warm up to each other, and the writer embarks on the custom of telling bedtime stories to her. The girl manages to deliver the evening's story to the secretary, because the secretary has agreed to type the stories for eventual submission to a publisher. And so, things seem to be humming along in a charming and semi-predictable manner. A stuffed dodo bird accompanies each storytelling hour, and the stories are about the dodo bird. However, while the attorney mother is in Canada tending to business, she contacts her former boyfriend (the writer) and requests that he take care of some paperwork so that the 6-year old can get Canadian citizenship. While complying with this request, and while helping with the paperwork, the writer notices that HIS NAME IS ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE OF THE GIRL. This is the first that he learns, that he is the real father of the six year old girl. (All along, the girl continues to spew out intelligent and charming lines that are beyond her years.) At any rate, the trio continues to burn their candle at both ends, and they have fun together at a go cart course, and the next weekend, have fun at a miniature golf course.

LOVE HAPPENS. At the 53 minute mark, the hot secretary and the writer are holding hands. The problem with this situation, is that the writer is one week away from being evicted for failure to pay rent, and the girl is one way from being retrieved by the lawyer mother, for a life in Canada. WHAT NEXT? At the 56 minute mark, the writer receives another rejection from another publisher. At the 57 minute mark, the trio is at a drive-in movie, watching a cartoon. The 6-year old sits in the back seat of writer's Volkswagon bug. At this point, the writer is still unaware that the girl is smuggling the tape recordings to the secretary. After the drive-in movie date, the writer gently lunges at the secretary's cheek to give her a peck. But the secretary justifiably get upset, because she also realizes that all three of them are burning the candle at both ends. WHAT NEXT? The writer does the logical thing, and consults the classified section of the newspaper, in search of a full-time job (his only source of income is writing manuals for household devices, e.g., pocket tape recorders and ball throwing machines.) At any rate, the writer's osculatory lunge did not scare the secretary away, and the next scene shows the secretary taking a walk with the girl.

STORY TAKES A TRAGIC TWIST. The mother returns from Canada, a week prematurely, causing the 6-year old to have a meltdown because she is being dragged away from her real father (Harrison the writer). Well, well, that's what happens when you burn the candle at both ends. In the next scene, the writer puts his typewriter up for sale. He consults an international lawyer, in an attempt to get custody of the girl. ""Sometimes you do need money to buy happiness,"" says the lawyer, advising the writer. WHAT NEXT? The next scene shows the manuscript arriving at a publisher's office. ""Clara, get this Harrison-What's-His-Name"" on the horn, says the publisher, referring to the fact that he likes the story penned by the writer, and dictated and then submitted by the hot secretary. Apparently, this represents a turning point in the movie, but the next scene shows the writer's job application at a Toyota dealer being rejected. At the one hour and ten minute time point, the hot secretary ambles through the park and encounters the writer (Harrison), and they smooch on the park bench. Meanwhile, back to reality, Harrison and the hot secretary pack up Harrison's belongings into cardboard boxes, because of the eviction. WHAT NEXT?

TURNING POINT. Finally, at the one hour and thirteen minute mark, the publisher calls Harrison, and informs him that his ""detective manuscript stinks"" that his book ""Terror By Night"" really sucks, but that his book on Mister Dodo is accepted for publication. Things get better. While the attorney mother and the 6-year old are in a book store in Canada, they encounter a display of the story about Mister Dodo. The display proclaims that Mister Dodo is a best seller. The next scene is a courtroom scene, for deciding custody. (Obviously, Harrison was able to afford the international attorney.) James Earl Jones plays the judge in the courtroom. James Earl Jones tells the girl that she is a ""cutie"" immediately after she delivers a letter to the judge, expressing her opinion. ""Thank you, my honor,"" replies the girl. (Again, this is a clever twist of language provided by the scriptwriter.) James Earl Jones rules that the 6-year old girl is to be given custody with her mother. And so, the real father (Harrison) and the 6-year old girl are shown to have a computer relationship, where they communicate by way of a computer device.

HAPPY ENDING, SOB! SOB! The next scene takes place in the house of the lawyer mother, and we see Harrison on a television program being interviewed. The mother sees Harrison on the television, and she gets a bit upset. ""I am your mother and I have just told you to go to bed,"" she angrily proclaims. ""I am sick of Mister Dodo."" ""I hate you,"" screams the 6-year old. The mother then slaps the girl on her face. WHAT NEXT? The mother changes her mind, and decides to transfer custody to Harrison. ""I want Jenny to live with you, she needs a stable upbringing . . . I would be a better mother if I just gave her to you."" (Happy ending, sob, sob.) The next scene shows Harrison at a book signing party, with a display of a dozen Mister Dodo books on the table, and a line of hundreds of children waiting for the author's autograph. If you don't being manipulated and jerked around by a charming but simple story, then you might agree that the film deserves FIVE STARS.",1382313600,5,7242,4.6737254901960785

1072703,3,6305799687,"This movie has a lot to recommend it. Unfortunately, it misses in a couple of big ways. At the beginning of the movie, we meet a struggling writer who lives alone. Out of the blue, a woman appears at his door. It is his former girlfriend who announces that she needs to drop off her daughter for two weeks while she goes on a business trip. At first, the guy doesn't know what to do, but he and the girl quickly begin to bond. At the same time, the girl befriends a woman who lives nearby. The little girl turns out to be very precocious and wise for her age and is the catalyst for a romantic meeting between the two adults as well as the unexpected success of the guy she is staying with. Eventually, the guy discovers that the little girl is actually his daughter. The end of the movie involves a custody battle but ends up happily, at least for the girl and her father. Unfortunately, while the whole middle of the movie involves a lot of cute scenes with a lot of chemistry between the little girl and her father, the beginning and end of the movie are bit too creepy for my taste, at least in a movie of this type. It is uncomfortable to see a woman drop off her daughter with a complete stranger in the beginning and it is equally uncomfortable to see the custody battle at the end. The viewer is rooting for the father to win out, but there is no obvious reason to cheer for the mother to lose custody. For me, the story had a lot of potential, but the romantic aspects are obscured by other factors and the poor beginning and end prevent the story from reaching its full potential. The little girl turns out to be very charming and does a wonderful job with her part. This makes the movie worth watching. However, in the end, the experience is less satisfying than it could have been.",1373328000,5,1793,4.276470588235294

1072900,5,6305799687,"I adore this movie.  A movie where dreams can and do come true.  I have watched it at least 5 times already and love it as much the fifth as I did the first. It was so well done. Jenny was so adoreable, who could not fall in love with her.  Dean Winters did and incredible job as Harrison, who turned out to be Jenny's Father.  His face showed so much emotion, so much love.  Yasmine Bleeth did a great job too as the girlfriend who fell for Jenny too. I loved the end when the Mother did the most wonderful act of love any Mother could do for a child.  She put the child's welfare first.  The unselfish love, caring, and tenderness made this a movie not to be missed.",1315612800,,668,4.0534351145038165
1072901,5,6305799687,"I saw the movie already on Netflix and I liked it so much that I had to buy it.
It's not a better place to find and buy DVD's then on Amazon.
Undercover angel is a heartwarming story about a business woman as mother, a little girl who is smart, cute and  don't have a place to stay during her Mom is on a business trip.
So she ends up to stay up with her Mom's Ex-boyfriend and writer with no success.
He also likes one girl he sees almost everyday in a little restaurant and she is very distance to him and any men. He knows that he don't have a chance to have a date with her.
But with the little girl is the big change of his life, success and love right around the corner.
And like in any other great heartwarming movie, it happens that this little girl is not only an undercover angel for him, she is also his daughter.
I recommend this movie to all fans of a good heartwarming, cute little story which will entertain the whole family.",1311292800,3,940,4.081081081081081
1072902,5,6305799687,"This is one of those movies that is almost one of those 'in the closet' B rated movies that honestly will melt your heart the first time you watch it...and the second and third times too haha! The little ""Welches Grape Juice"" girl steals the camera with absolutely every scene and the movie itself pulls at your heart strings. It's sad she hasn't done anything after this because watching her in this movie you can so tell she was born to act!

A great family gem to add to anyone's collection!",1303516800,,494,4.428571428571429
1072903,5,6305799687,Why is there 2 different covers for the same movie Unercover angel? I love the movie and will buy it soon. I know there is a small increase between the two. I don't think this movie has any extra stuff which sucks but can you all tell me why they have 2 covers and why one is more expensive than the other? especially since it's not blu ray,1303257600,,340,4.014705882352941

1073004,4,6305799687,I love this movie. It is a romance about a guy who takes care of a little girl for his ex-girlfriend for a couple of weeks and how it totally changes his life for the better. I was so happy to find it here on Amazon.com and be able to own it on DVD. The only down side is that the movie is not closed-captioned or subtitled. I am hard of hearing and that would have been helpful. The sound quality on the DVD was very clear and I was able to hear the whole thing when I turned up the volume though.,1216252800,,498,3.8446601941747574
1073005,5,6305799687,"A struggling writer gets a surprise visit from an ex-girlfriend he hasn't seen for six years.  She's now a successful, busy lawyer who wants him to babysit her six-year-old daughter for two weeks.  At first awkward and at a loss, he is gradually warmed by the precocious little girl, who wrangles an introduction to a woman he's had his eye on, and gets him to tell her a bedtime story which she secretly records and sends to a publisher.  He comes to love the little girl and she him and both dread the day when the mother comes back.  But the biggest surprise of all comes when he discovers that the little girl is his daughter. Then, the mother returns.

Fortunately, the moviemaker did not make the casting mistakes so often made in family movies recently.  The little girl is delightful and very appealing.  The girlfriend is not only pretty but appealing.  All look much, much better that their pictures on the DVD cover (but then, isn't that true for almost all DVD covers?).

The character/casting of the man, the central character, is regrettable.  He is whiney throughout, even after his success.  This hurts the movie and may account for why this good movie is going off the market so soon.  His courtroom appearance even strains credibility: everyone knows to be decorous in a court appearance.

The movie begins inappropriately with a scene from the mystery novel the man is trying to write.  This is unnecessary, misleading and inappropriate.  But it is mercifully brief (only a couple of minutes).",1149292800,22,1512,4.783783783783784

Mothers will love how the daddy embraces his lil' Angel and Daddys should be able to relate(and hopefully give my lil' Angels daddy some ideas!)  A must see!",1066953600,,442,4.1647058823529415

1073008,5,6305799687,"Undercover Angel is a movie worth owning because you can watch it over and over.  Emily Mae Young is a very talented young actress.  I like how Dean Winters, Yasmine Bleath, and Emily Mae Young find a loving family with each other.  Although this movie is great for everyone, I highly recommend it to divorced fathers who are looking for love, and are struggling with visitation and/or custody rights of their children.
The movie is great, but the DVD layout stinks.  You do not get a scene selection menu.  Therefore, you cannot return to the scene where you left off.  You have to rewind/ fast forward from the very beginning of the movie to return to the scene.  You also do not get to see Emily Mae Young in the Welches commercial like you do on the VHS tape.",1031270400,5,763,4.446043165467626
