8362422,5,B002BX205C,"I train as a solitaire.  Don't have the benefit of a regular training partner or dojo.  In my private garage I have assembled an adequate training facility with three primary tools, a BOB (latex body opponent bag), a heavy bag, and a mook jong.  I've dabbled around with Wing Chun's mook jong techniques, but gleaned little real world efficacy in my self-protection skill set.  The Slam Set, IMHO,  is a definitive modern form of wooden dummy training,  illustrating powerful and explosive movements that can ""semlessly integrate"" with a knife or stick.  Familiar task transfer!  Shown in different sections with real world application interspersed, it's instructual potential is excellent.  It represents a dynamic, effective, workout in 60 seconds, with street-fight attitude.  If you train alone, this could prove an invaluable resource.",1384905600,3,840,5.392307692307693
