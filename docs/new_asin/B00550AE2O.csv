4570991,4,B00550AE2O,"Good product. May need to be a little versed in ASL to get some of what they are saying since they are a little fast in some areas and don't always tell you what each sign they are doing is.
Other than that it is set up pretty well as far as I can see. You don't stay in one type of educational setting but switch to many different ones to keep your mind interested and alert.",1352073600,14,376,3.896103896103896
4570992,2,B00550AE2O,"My first amazon Disapointment. Dave's are about 30 minutes each, so advertising 16 dvd's is stretching it!  Not arranged like a real course you could teach yourself, like a night school. Cheaply made, not the best resolution, just a person standing there making the sign for a word in subtitles. No explanation of hand movements or what sign is like, or related to. No discussion how signing differs from spoken English, which is very important.
No logical beginning is ""I am... You are... She is... And building in a logical sequence. Seems to be disconnected bunches of words, used in sentences that have not yet been taught.  Almost looks like somebody's basement production. I could deal with cheap production but lack of explanation or teaching makes this an expensive bad choice in my opinion. Don't choose this product if you are looking for a course to teach you signing.
Maybe ok for practice after a year of college level

4570996,4,B00550AE2O,This is a wonderful collection of ASL videos. This collections covers the range from basic ASL vocabulary to advanced ASL idioms. The two DVDs for Kids and Adults were my favorite. My students were captivated by the animal scenes and very quickly learned the signs for each of the animals.,1383696000,,289,4.8

4570999,2,B00550AE2O,"The sign language training in the DVD's is good. Should get 4 stars. Be forewarned that there is a lot of time spent on these DVD's not teaching sign language but instead pushing the authors cause or bringing attention to endangered animals. There are long sections dedicated to pandas and other animals with no sign language training.

I have no issue with their cause but I did not buy these DVD's to watch that.",1381017600,33,414,4.594594594594595

8457181,2,B00550AE2O,"Not what I expected.  I am a native signer and have taught ASL for many years. The video quality was good - signers took care to provide good work - some regional signs were evident but the words were quite accurate. There were problems. 1. The main problem was lesson layout. The dvds provide long lists of words - much like a visual dictionary - with no way to click on the words. You need to wait for the recording to process through each preceding word before you can get to the word you need. Ex. 'cousin' would be buried after a long list of unrelated 'c' words. The words at the end of the list take quite a long time to get to. This is inconvenient for teaching purposes and for student review. It would be much easier if the lessons were arranged in short related modules - better yet if vocabulary was set up by index in English allowing the viewer to select words, as many streaming options allow online. 2. Terrible customer service! I didn't receive all of the contents of my order - missing the workbook. I simply needed to know what happened to it. The accusatory response was very strong and negative, using words like 'fraud' and 'coercion.'  There were a lot of assumptions and misunderstandings. The book eventually arrived but the process was long, difficult and very unpleasant. Their customer service was dishonest saying that they included a note re: delay of the book in my first shipment to justify lack of communication. 3. I was surprised by the poor customer experience and checked their website to learn more - discovered that they offer other purchasing options on their site. There is a comparable set available at 20 percent less and includes 4 more new dvds that were not included in the set I purchased. That was a disappointment. Had these 3 things been handled differently - more professionally with more integrity - I could have been interested in becoming a regular customer. Hoping for their sake that they will improve their business and products in the future. There is great need for good quality products that are reasonably priced. There are other good ones available - the Bravo series, products sold by Dawn Sign Press, Harrison Communications, Sign Media, Gallaudet University, etc. but the cost can be prohibitive. Thought I'd give this one a try. Disappointed. I'll keep looking.",1519603200,,2328,4.731527093596059
8457182,3,B00550AE2O,"I'll write about the video ""American Sign Language Vocabulary Builder 2"", which is the video of the set I've just seen. I am finding it difficult to learn from the video because the resolution is kind of poor. It would also be helpful to see the signers body in a couple of different positions as the resolution of the video sometimes prevents you from seeing her exact hand shapes. Maybe I'm kind of slow, but telling you how to put your hands first and in what positions and signing in slow motion would help beginners a lot as her hand shapes are sometimes obscured by the face-on view. Honestly, you almost need to see the signer in 3-D to get some of the more complicated signs. I know it sounds weird but it almost would be more effective to have the signer wear a black turtleneck sweater for greater visual contrast. I thought I would learn better from a video than a book but I think that may not be the case. Maybe a combo? I'm sure there are other people like me.

On the second run through the DVD I did a little better but there were still some signs, especially those spelling parts of words that were way too fast. I think this could be a useful resource but at least for me only in conjunction with a live teacher or a book showing each sign. You really a more detailed explanation of what the signer is doing. I also think being able to play a sign over and over again without interruption would be helpful as opposed to having to play the whole subsection over again (the formatting is a little odd...Maybe the dictionaries that come with a CD are better). All in all, not the greatest for an absolute beginner.

Having gone through the DVD a couple more times, I think it's useful for passive recognition of other people's signing but not as useful for learning how to make signs yourself. I'm getting addicted to watching this lady sign and some of it is rubbing off.",1436486400,,1887,4.388571428571429
8457183,3,B00550AE2O,"Over all I wouldn't recommend this. I sat down with a deaf person, and a few students and we're not over all pleased with these. The idioms are not used in deaf culture. So that whole section is out.  The other dvds that I thought would be feat fro practice were not.  If I wanted to voice for the signer I couldn't, as for the closed captions on the bottom which I can't get rid of. Very disappointing.  Go out and learn from your deaf community and get involved! It's the best way to learn!!",1420070400,,493,4.168421052631579

8457187,5,B00550AE2O,wonderful thank you so very much,1404259200,,32,4.5
8457188,5,B00550AE2O,"I love it and I'm using it to improve my knowledge in signing. I enjoy using it compared to reading books,I would highly recommend it to people working in special education classes. The price of the item is worthy for its content. Thanks.",1402876800,3,238,4.558139534883721
8457189,1,B00550AE2O,"It's a great idea, but the DVDs are very disorganized, and of the six I opened, there were duplicate teachings (a narrative about red pandas, and words related to New Years). When I wanted to return the set, the instructions indicated that they would only refund any unopened items plus there'd be a whopping 23% restocking fee. I won't be returning these. If anything, I'll resell them.

Although the instructors are excellent (I love the way Avery taught numbers), there's no DVD you can pop in to learn all family relations, all emotions, all words in the kitchen, bath or bedroom and no way to string them into a sentence like kids are taught, ""I am happy to see you, Grandma."" No idea how to ask Who What When Where How or Why to ask questions like, ""Where is the bathroom?"" ""Where did you get that?"" ""How do I sign for (then spell it out).""

I was looking for ASL to be taught the same way one learns a language or teaches a child to read. This was not it.",1402617600,10,962,4.338888888888889
8457190,3,B00550AE2O,"This a great value, no doubt. But the DVDs are too intense, after 15 mins I had to turn it off. Could be me though, maybe I'm just not ready for them. Gave the kids DVDs to my brother, for my nieces, he said they couldn't even get through one. Not for me.",1401494400,,255,3.830188679245283
