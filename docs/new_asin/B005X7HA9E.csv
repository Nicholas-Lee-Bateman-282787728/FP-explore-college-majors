4902366,3,B005X7HA9E,"Thanks, Rudy. I'd love to still be able to go to Limelight (now a shopping mall, in a church), but all I've got left is the Lion King. Nice legacy. That said, this movie is a great reminder of NYC's nightlife in its heyday, albeit one that's a little one-sided (the movie is produced by Peter Gatien's daughter, after all), but even so, still entertaining and full of 90s nostalgia. I grew up right across the street from the Limelight in my early 20s, so I lived and breathed this scene. Still great to see so many quotes from all the people they included in this documentary, including Michael Alig. A good documentary in general, but more specifically for people who witnessed firsthand the nightlife of NYC in the 90s.",1330905600,,722,4.561538461538461
4902367,4,B005X7HA9E,"***-MY FIRST REVIEW-I've fallen asleep both times I've tried to watch this!  I've found myself glued to anything related to NYC nightlife, especially during the time in which Peter Gatien was standing tall.  So far, though, this DVD hasn't captured my mind and attention.

Once I'm more clear-minded, perhaps I'll be able to supply a better ""review"".

*****-MY SECOND REVIEW - Something has clicked inside me:  I've found myself drawn to this film and have watched it again and again!  The interviews make it relevant all over, again, and it gives a glimpse into what happened and the way it seems certain people were targeted while others were over-looked.

This, to me, could be a film enjoyed by anyone:  those who lived the ""LIMELIGHT"" experience, those who have been enchanted by its lore and those who have little or no previous knowledge.",1330300800,,845,4.901408450704225

4902377,4,B005X7HA9E,"What an embarrassment for the federal government, the State of New York, and the City of New York.  Complete and total sham of a case and an injustice.

While I personally believe Peter Gatien was more interested in money, pop, high fashion, and catering to VIPs rather than really interested in the music itself (let alone electronic music) or the common club goer, to go after the owner of venues for illicit activity that usually quietly occurs on the premises and usually doesn't harm anyone, and further has no direct connection to that owner... well, it's immoral of the authorities.

In nearly every concert venue, lounge, and club I've been to, I've either seen drugs being done, asked if I had drugs, or asked if I wanted them.  I have never indulged and never assumed the venue owners automatically had any connection to those activities.  For what it's worth, I've also been asked or outright accused of being an undercover cop, which I was not, either.

What's oddly not fully explored in this documentary is the connection of certain lounges and club owners to Rudolf Giuliani who conveniently went unnoticed by narcotics investigations and who were never bothered with the enforcement of the historic anti-race-mixing No Dancing cabaret laws.  I would have liked to have seen that hypocrisy explored.  There was definite cronyism at work.  I realize it's slightly apart from the laser-like narcotics enforcement Gatien experienced, but a relevant tangent, in my opinion.

The documentary might be a little slow-moving for some viewers not familiar with the subject matter.  It's not the most stylish or extraordinary editing and 'reveals'.  Don't expect The Thin Blue Line quality of workmanship.  The music is also not particularly inspired in the cues used and there's a bit too much use of 'warehouse' re-recording reverb for my taste.  Corben and co still did a respectable job with the rest, though.  You are getting a very big picture here, yet with a lot of nuance.  And I liked the earth turning into the crystal ball at the end.  Classy.

This might seem contradictory, but I tend to think, while what happened was an injustice, it may have possibly done the scene some good, incidentally, to remove someone from the New York scene who had less interest in the music.  Let's ignore for a moment the wisdom of associating with drug dealers or masses of hopped-up trannies.  This possibly helped pave the way for those who weren't simply following the money as much regardless of the upsurge in muggings.  This even more European-style event run by people who intimately care about the art itself (and I'm not talking about their interest in fashion designers or art gallery VIPs), has led to EDM getting back to its roots and then exploding as it has.  This doesn't just go for free parties, but for-profit ones, too.  This is not to say that money is not a component or there aren't some base profiteers at work, but the vibe has improved.

While Gatien got a bad rap (no pun intended, but probably an appropriate play on words), I think he lacked quite the 'purity' that he and the scene needed to be running raves... let alone raves in a church.  The story of the money changers and another one about a rich man come to mind.",1386720000,4,3250,4.791741472172352

4902379,4,B005X7HA9E,"As a social-drama documentary, I thought this was a good movie.  But it was overdone on the clubbed-up visual effects as backdrops for simple talking interviews.

4902380,5,B005X7HA9E,Loved going to the Limelight & hearing this story. Working in the music biz I can relate to so much that happened & it was a shame that Peter Gatien had to go through all the drama. All he wanted to do was bring a good party to the people where you would go & enjoy the music. That is what it should be. I am in no way saying that people should be doing the drugs but he was not involved in that & should not have had to deal with what he did because he was successful. I have seen this with so many club owners & it is so sad.,1367452800,,527,3.672566371681416
4902381,3,B005X7HA9E,"This was an extremely well made, well shot (the colored window gels, Robert Richardson hot lighting), the greenscreening, vfx and editing were near flawless. But, at times they overwhelmed the narrative. The film doesn't really take off until mid way through in which Gatiens legal persecution is well documented. Ultimately, it's a very good doc, but if you're really all about the rave/ ecstasy scene I recommend this film:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-Drugs-Design-The-Starck-Club-Documentary-FINAL-CUT/dp/B00GG0P34G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex, Drugs, Design: The Starck Club Documentary FINAL CUT</a>&nbsp;The scene going on there pre-dates the Limelight's MDMA peak by more than a decade....",1366502400,,750,6.98936170212766

4902383,5,B005X7HA9E,"It's films like these that make me sad to be an American. With each passing day, our freedom is eroded. As pointed out clearly in this documentary film, the government has unlimited time and unlimited resources. They can, and will take down anyone they want. In this case, it was Canadian born Peter Gatien, owner/operator of several NYC nightclubs.

One might construe the statement above to indicate I support tax evasion, law-breaking and illegal drug sales. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. But taking away / shutting down nightclubs will not eliminate nor fix the drug problem in America - case in point, watch:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weeds-Season-Eight/dp/B009TE9GNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weeds: Season Eight</a>.

While most people have heard of the smashing success of Studio 54 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Studio-54-The-Legend/dp/3823821180/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Studio 54: The Legend</a>), Peter Gatien's empire included not 1, but 4 clubs, including the infamous Limelight, housed in a former church and the club for which the film is titled (and focused).  His business model was to offer citizens a place to dance and party and have a good time - much the same way every nightlife institution does - the same reason people go to NYC, Las Vegas, Miami - or any bar/dance club in any town or city in the world.

""Limelight"" tells the story of just one outlet for the people shuttered by the unending government assault on a man, and his business. Trust me, if he was Donald Trump, he would have emerged from this with wealth and with his family living in the USA. But, he wasn't.  In the past decade, changes in society, law, insurance regulations (just to name a few) have all but eliminated the mega nightclub in America. One by one, these institutions have closed there doors, unable to comply with an ever-changing increase in government, increase in insurance premiums and decrease in legal limits for consumption of alcohol.  Again, don't get me wrong, driving while intoxicated is bad.  So is driving while texting, but what has the government done to protect you from that injustice?  Sure, they have enacted some laws - lame laws that are rarely enforced. I would rather be driving next to a buzzed and aware driver than a driver with 2 hands on a cell phone typing a message any day of the week. But I digress.

When the corrupt federal government investigation failed to shutter Mr. Gatein's businesses, the city and state of NY took care of the rest. Under the new ""leadership"" of Mayor Giuliani, the city of New York was being purged of any business that was not considered wholesome by an elite few.

The film through a series of interviews and investigative research tells the tragic story and eventual demise of a business at the hands of angry government leaders. The ending throws one more horrific hit when a judge orders Peter Gatein be immediately deported to Canada.

We as a society are at fault (see:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ethos-A-Time-for-Change/dp/B006H37OQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ethos: A Time for Change</a>) when we allow (and often invite) government to step in and control the free enterprise system.  Best I can tell, Peter Gatien never killed anyone, nor did he sell drugs, nor cultivate them; he paid taxes, he ran a business that employed nearly 1,000 people. When he erred on his taxes, he admitted the mistake and agreed to pay back the money due.  Ask the former Enron employee's how they're doing today.  Peter Gatien made one mistake - he wasn't a man of wealth and he wasn't connected with men of wealth. Therefore, when the government wanted him out of business, he never stood a chance. His story is one of many. And sadly I fear, many more to come.

For me, this is a personal story. I worked in the nightlife business in the 90's and 2000's. I was also a customer of many a nightclub - many of which are long gone. And I visited the Limelight in 1991. Never once did I possess, buy or use an illegal drug in any nightclub. Nightclubs are not bad places. Take them away and the people will continue to seek a means to find what they need legally or otherwise.  We are oppressing the people and this film tells part of that story.

And lastly, even the late great Mayor Koch warned us...",1361145600,2,4423,5.112343966712899
4902384,3,B005X7HA9E,"As someone whose early adulthood was spent in Manhattan at night, I was familiar with the rave scenes, and knew to avoid it for the very reasons the film promulgates. There are the usual over the top clich&eacute;s, wherein the talking heads of the film proclaim the rave scene as making a youth culture for the world, but, in reality, techno and electronica music died on the vine, and hip hop (the watered down version of hardcore rap) is not exactly known as a progenitor of culture. And if Moby is the best the film can do, in regards to talking heads, you know you're in trouble.
  But, the film shines as a police procedural, even if, at 102 minutes at length it often feels like a bloated A&E special on the 1980s. Gatien, deported after being cleared of criminal charges, and nailed on tax charges (ironically just like 1920s Chicago kingpin Al Capone), is not hagiographized, but the film could have done a much better job of fleshing out his personal issues. Likely, given his daughter's role as co-producer, this was a taboo subject for the cameras.
  Corben's film is slick and polished, but its lead subject is just not that interesting. Yes, it is fascinating to hear about how routinely the justice system is abused, and why- so that middle class malcontents can feel smugly superior in the little moralities, but, after such gas deflations, what is really left? There are the usual bevy of talking heads (including former New York Mayor Ed Koch), but little of relevance is put forth, outside of the recounting of Gatien's case. Archival video and film footage fill in the rest, but the lesson to be culled is that the pre-9/11 New York was, for all its glory on cleaning up crime under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, still a cesspool of corruption, only this time of the institutionalized variety. One hopes that Corben returns to this subject in a later film.",1359676800,,1870,4.692073170731708

4902387,5,B005X7HA9E,"This movie gives the viewer a backdoor perspective on environments that were major incubators for modern culture, as well as the ways that they have changes since their heyday.

As political commentary, it serves as a reminder that fear has been taking from our freedom since before more freedoms were forsaken in the name of a war on terror.

This also serves as a warning to anybody considering making cultural investments: if your purpose does not serve existing power structures, they will attempt to damage you whether or not your actions would normally be considered legal.",1351814400,,579,5.020833333333333
4902388,5,B005X7HA9E,Peter Gatien will ALWAYS be the King of the Clubs in NY. This is an amazing documentary that really shows just how the whole Club Kid's scene went from fabulous to sad and how Peter Gatien innocently got dragged into it.,1351728000,2,220,4.390243902439025
4902389,5,B005X7HA9E,"This is a documentary that's almost hard to watch. Here was a man who fulfilled the American dream. Peter Gatien was an immigrant from Canada who came here, worked 16 hour days, and duly became rich and famous. He was the King of New York clubs and The Limelight was his mainstay. Gatien also ran Palladium and Tunnel. This fame attracted the attention of the New York law enforcement so they decided to break him...and they did. First, they engaged in lawfare by forcing Gatien to bankrupt himself paying legal fees, and then, when all else failed they deported him out of the country. He's back in Canada now and I can't blame him if he never sets foot in the US again. The government hated this fellow and would not accept anything less than his destruction. The film--and what I've read about him in the days since I saw it--leaves me convinced of his innocence. The central premise, that a club owner is personally responsible for the behaviors of everyone at his venue, is totally absurd. The city wanted to be done with him and tried to paint him as a major drug dealer. He clearly wasn't and what we as a people need to do is take as much money away from the government as we can. The last thing we need is a huge state apparatus that can be used against us based on the personal likes and dislikes of a few functionaries. If this doesn't sell you on libertarianism, nothing will.",1345593600,3,1388,4.447058823529412
4902390,3,B005X7HA9E,"Is it just me or has anyone else noticed the self-absorbed attitude taken by folks who live in the New York hoi paloi? For some reason these people seem to think that if they're interested in something then everyone else is interested in the same thing, or that they should be. Perhaps this explains why they seem interested in a fashion or idea that never catches on until several years later at which time they think it has passed. High profile dance clubs was one such creature and LIMELIGHT, a documentary covering the life of New York club owner Peter Gatien, tells us much about that world of the past.

Gatien was a Canadian who had an idea, the desire to build the ultimate club in New York City. Long past the days when disco ruled in clubs like 54, Gatien wanted to make something special and achieved his dream when he built clubs like Limelight, The Tunnel and Palladium. Each had its own decor, style and theme and each was popular with various crowds. The clubs became THE place to be seen by various celebrities and in turn created a few of their own.

But the clubs came tumbling down when it came to what went on behind the scenes. While Gatien wanted to create a place for people to hang, for people to enjoy themselves and to ultimately make money in the process, to do so meant including others. When you toss that many people into the mix something is bound to go wrong. As the film describes various people involved in Gatien's clubs were involved in many things from drug dealing to murder and their contributions with these things led the collapse of those same clubs.

While this was going on there was also a change in the world of New York City. Where the world on NYC was filled with drugs and crime and what many would consider socially unacceptable behavior, those in charge changed. Along comes a district attorney by the name of Rudolph Guliani who decides it's time to clean up New York. Times Square changed with the downfall of porn houses, pimps and prostitutes and the recreation of the area into a world filled with family oriented businesses. Included in this clean up were the clubs of Gatien, clubs filled with hedonistic leaning people who wanted to do what they wanted without consequence.

These two items combined to bring down the fall of the clubs and of Gatien. As the documentary unfolds you get the impression that Gatien wanted nothing more than to offer a place for club goers to gather while making a profit at the same time. For one man to control this entire empire would be impossible. The choices Gatien made in those who helped run things was his mistake. It was these people that chose to do things that would harm more than help his clubs.

 The film combines documented footage and stills from the clubs, news footage and interviews with those who were there to make an interesting film. It does so not using just those who were involved in the club side of things but government officials who helped lead to the closings of the clubs as well. Best of all it includes interviews with Gatien himself.

When you walk away from this film you won't consider Gatien the devil that he may have been portrayed as by those who prosecuted him. You won't consider him a saint either. You will have a behind the scenes look at what it takes to not only create a business but to keep it in check as well. This movie doesn't offer any clear cut bad guys. It does show the world as it really is.",1336953600,3,3442,4.4888178913738015
