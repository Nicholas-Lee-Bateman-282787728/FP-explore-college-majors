8722121,5,B010CVV078,"good anime compared to alot on market, Very great art and plot the anime isn't English dubbed but subtitled Still good!! Infact I think the voice acting gives it justice in original format.  It's twisted not what you'd expect. It's well thought out I recommend it",1455148800,,263,4.717391304347826
