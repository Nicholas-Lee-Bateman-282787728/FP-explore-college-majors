7852875,5,6303678580,"The movie begins as a standard bored housewife looking for romantic adventure, but Laura San Giacomo's Nina is self-aware enough to make add the perfect touch of ironic humor to her quest. The scenes of early 90s San Franscisco are appropriately glamourous and the music perfectly romantic, and the romantic tension between Nina and her paramour, the handsome photographer (Paul Rhys) is divine. The film is smart enough to give him enough intelligence to be appealing even though he is classic affair material. The final twist is a shock and there are some interesting insights about marital love. It makes for a great romantic fantasy you want to see on TV, but hopefully not actually act out in real life.",1415318400,,708,4.908333333333333
7852876,5,6303678580,"This is another movie I once had in my hands to purchase but put it back. Since then I searched for it never found it till at this time. If you have seen Laura San Giacomo in other projects including her TV series Just Shoot Me, get this movie. You'll enjoy the movie.",1358899200,2,268,4.0754716981132075
7852877,1,6303678580,I kept waiting for something to happen. I like Laura as a comedy actress. She doesn't cut it as a dramatic actress. Also the plot of the movie was pretty stupid. Wouldn't recommend that anyone waste their time watching this story that goes nowhere.,1334102400,,248,4.659090909090909
7852878,5,6303678580,"This is a very little known movie.  Nina takes a lover is a ""thinking"" movie.  It is one of my all time favorites.  If you have ever been married or especially divorced this is a must see.",1325116800,,188,4.027027027027027
7852879,3,6303678580,"This is a hard one for me to review. On one hand I like the ""surprise"" ending because it was a surprise . . . at least to me. (Interestingly enough, my wife surmised the ending as the plot unfolded. Hmmm?) On the other hand it left me kind of flat. ""Surprise-ending"" movies are usually GREAT because there are so many tired storylines to have to live through. But, once the ""surprise"" was revealed I kind of felt, not quite cheated, but I didn't get full satisfaction either. It was like, ""big whoop"", I'm not sure I really care.

The movie has its charm because it feels very intimate; all nice cozy. The acting is pretty good and keeps the viewer interested throughout the piece. But . . . then again there is that ""but"" for me. It's all OK , but I just didn't get the payoff I felt this movie was leading up too. Maybe it's the ""guy-thing"" in me that just isn't getting it? I think there's something in there that I must be missing? There are a lot of good things about this picture so on that I rate it 3 stars. But . . .",1186963200,,1025,4.125
7852880,5,6303678580,"Feeling this storyline, hearing the rain as if it were outside my window and having my heart race according to the beat of each character's affairs was as lush and satisfying as it gets for me, an avid, observant film lover. Any book, song or movie that makes me cry a good deep from the heart sob is ""A-OK"" in my book.  I LOOOOOVE this movie.  It captures the city, the characters and an artsy, cool quirkiness and works it all to delicious advantage.  The story is about a married woman, Nina telling the background, circumstances and resultant residues of an affair that shook her married life to a gentle, curious interviewer with time to listen and questions to softly ask toward healing and understanding. Why, how, who and for how long are the questions that subtly beg to be unfolded along the way. The acting is easy and down to earth.  You feel like maybe you're watching the characters from across the store, from the booth next door or from the other side of the park.  The surprising ending will hit you in the gut if you are a romantic.  The realism found in the relationships was what made this one of my top ten of all time favorites. Laura San Giacomo is a nuanced genius in love stories and I wanted what she had by the end of the movie. I can't tell what that is because it'll ruin it for those of you who haven't viewed it yet. For those who have, it is all we could hope for in all it's sordid abandon. I think.  (sigh)",1128211200,8,1440,4.311111111111111
7852881,5,6303678580,"Not only the beautiful imagery and the thrill of a realistic love story, the best thing I found in this film was the shocking ending. Throughout the entire film I had no idea what this all was leading up to. If for nothing else see this movie to find out the hidden twist in the plot!",988848000,5,284,4.089285714285714
7852882,2,6303678580,"In the early part of this film, Nina (Laura San Giacomo) tries to attract the attention of a handsome young man in a leather jacket. She bites down loudly (cue sound effect) on an amazingly fresh, crunchy, meaty apple.
As opposed to this film, which, in apple terms, has blotchy tone, a mealy taste, and a sickeningly mushy interior. Not quite rotten to the core, enjoyable if you're really craving an apple.
So, the good: Christi Conaway and Fisher Stevens are amusing in secondary roles. There are some amusing scenes, and there is a kind-of surprising twist towards the end.
Kind of good, kind of bad: Laura San Giacomo, who wields her galactically expressive face like a blunt axe, sometimes hits her scenes perfectly, and other times indiscriminately pauses for annoying effect. Paul Rhys, who prior to this played ""The Responsible Brother of Insanely Talented Men"" (Vincent & Theo, Chaplin), is supposed to be handsome and mysterious, but he often seems to be overacting his underacting.
Bad, bad, bad: The framing device of the journalist interviewing the characters of this story for their take on infidelity. Also bad -- the setting, the lame conclusion of the panty-swiping gag, and some really badly written ""serious"" dialogue.
Recommended for Laura San Giacomo fetishists, or people that really want to see a relationship drama, but have run out of other options.",972518400,6,1375,5.035087719298246
7852883,5,6303678580,"NINA TAKES A LOVER IS BY FAR ONE OF THE MOST THOUGHTFUL, CREATIVE AND UNIQUE INDEPENDENT/LOW BUDGET FILMS I HAVE EVERE SEEN. I FIRST SAW THIS  FILM IN MEXICO WHERE IT WAS SUBTILTLED AND ABSOLUTELY FELL IN LOVE WITH ITS  INTENSE CHARACTERS AND REALISTIC JUXTAPOSITIONS BETWEEN THE CHEATING  PARTNER AND THE DRIFTING HEART. LAURA SAN GIACOMO IS AT HER ARTISTIC BEST  AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF CHRISTI CONNAWAY AND FISHER STEVENS IS HILARIOUSLY  TOUCHING(THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF ME IN EVERY CUP!). INDEPENDENT FILMS, SUCH  AS THIS, COMPOSE THE UNDERGROUND WORLD OF SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL-TYPE  MASTERPIECES. I'VE READ CERTAIN CRITICAL REVIEWS ON THIS FILM BY CRITICS  WHO HAVE NO APPRECIATION FOR AN OUT-OF-THE-ORIDNARY , NON-BLOCKBUSTER  MINDLESS HIT. I GUARANTEE YOU, THE ENDING TWIST OF THIS FILM IS A  REFRESHING, FELLINIESQUE SHOCK. BESIDES EVERYTIME I RENT IT I GET A CERTAIN  WARM FEELING THAT DOES COME IN TODAYS MINDLESS ""MOVIES"". ALSO  WHOEVER COMPOSED THE MUSIC IN THE FILM IS FANTASTIC-I WISH THERE WAS A  SOUNDTRACK!",966816000,3,1024,5.208588957055214
