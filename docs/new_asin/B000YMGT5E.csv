It is great to see someone so dedicated to the cause,doing his best to try and bring the reality of bigfoots existense to the rest of us. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD TO EVERYONE!!!!!KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK TOM!!!!!",1203120000,,366,4.318840579710145
3033373,5,B000YMGT5E,"From the opening scene to the credit roll, this bigfoot movie will keep your eyes fixed and ears peeled.  Tom Biscardi has captured some of the most interesting, factual information on bigfoot around the world.  If you were skeptical on the existence of bigfoot, you will believe after you watch Biscard's journey unfold to reveal facts.  Can't wait to see more of his films.",1202860800,,375,4.828125
3033374,5,B000YMGT5E,"I must say first I was involved in a very small way in Bigfoot Lives. When I viewed the video, what captivated me the most is the REAL stars of the movie, were the witnesses.

In this documentary you hear much more from the actual witnesses devoid of campy re-enactments and speculation. What comes across is the sincerity of the witnesses and the fact they had encountered SOMETHING very unusual and not to the expected belief systems of today's society.

In essence this movie captures that apprehension and excitement of the witnesses.

Truly a must have for anyone interested in the topic!",1202342400,2,593,4.794117647058823
3033375,5,B000YMGT5E,"Bigfoot Lives is a very exciting documentary with real eyewitness accounts that brought a chill to my bones. This movie kept me watching  over and over again. I couldn't get over the up close and personal encounters reported to the Searching for Bigfoot team and the actual footage that was shot during the making of the movie. Bigfoot Lives is a definate must have dvd for all Bigfoot hunters and skeptics alike. No matter where you stand on the issue of Bigfoot, real or hoax, you will definately be entertained. Bigfoot Lives will challenge you to come closer to making a decision about the reality of this creature. If you can't participate in an actual expedition, follow along with Tom Biscardi and the team and watch as they attempt prove that Bigfoot Lives.",1201392000,3,765,4.7518796992481205

3033377,5,B000YMGT5E,"""Bigfoot Lives"" a great documentary for those who believe and for
 those that don't. Tom Biscardi has given you a chose to make your
 own decision. What better way then to show some evidence and listen
 to the eye witness accounts on one of the great mysteries of our
 time. Well put together. Not like other documentaries on ""Bigfoot""
that are one sided. Let people who watch this make their own conclusions.

Once again a great job by Tom Biscardi for letting us into his world.

3033378,5,B000YMGT5E,"Absolutely the best Bigfoot Documentary I have every seen. This movie shows the real thing no staged interviews. The ""Real People"" express thier experiences with emotions. ""YOU Believe The Real People"" This is not a hoax.  The Expeditions Research is conducted totally on location in remote areas where the creature habitats in environments that are unbelievable. The Searches and investigations from the Searching For Bigfoot Team keep you on the edge of your chair. This Documentary Really Delivers. If you have any doubts about the existance of the Bigfoot Creature, This Movie will convince you to really review your convictions and like me, change my mind in believing that the creature truly exists in our midst in virtually every U.S. State and Canada. This Movie will challenge the scientific community to explain that with all thier grants and research funding why they haven't even scratched the surface of research as well as the Searching For Bigfoot Team has. The Movie Shows The Viewer A Significant Body of evidence to validate there is a bipedal creature that lives amoung us. What's amazing is there are more Real Every Day People that encounter this creature than main stream america could even imagine.  My Hat Is Off to Mr. Biscardi and his Team for a Superbly Interesting Real Time Adventure in my living room. I felt like I was Part Of the experience the movie projected and I'm primed and ready to join him in his next expedition. ""WHAT A MOVIE""

3033379,3,B000YMGT5E,"This production is presented by self-proclaimed 33 year long bigfoot researcher Tom Biscardi, not the highest held name in the bigfoot community. He is joined by 'Java Bob' (of Happy Camp 'fame' - locals know what this means). None-the-less, Biscardi takes his group on the road covering many different states and actually presents a few interesting highlights but also some 'so-whats'. There's a number of eye-witness testimonies which are interesting but the photos are iffy and known fakes. There are three very intriguing points in this presentation that really needs to be looked into and expanded upon with conclusions.

A) The unidentified severed hand from Idaho Falls (can be seen on Biscardi's website)
B) Hiriam Upham's juvenile leg video (slightly disturbing when viewed), lost buried in his field - Browning, MT
C) Mike Sell's unidentified large grave skeleton (can be seen on Biscardi's website) and purported 'attack' encounter video - Paris, TX

Downside - Biscardi's constantly saying ""okay"" after every partial sentence as if he is talking to a 10 year old really bothered me. Then there's Biscardi's long time connection to Ivan Marx (known hoaxer) which is not very beneficial to one's credentials (pertaining to bigfoot research anyway). One of his creature photos, I believe, is from the Ray Wallace fakery-collection. But mostly, just Biscardi's reputation isn't that good and he spends as much time pushing himself as he does his 'research'.

It's a 79 minute presentation of which the first 20 minutes or so did very little to interest me, but then it got markedly better and interesting with the above mention three highlights, however, there is also no conclusion to any of those points which is a downer. The thing is, Biscardi is willing to go out there across the country to look into otherwise overlooked reports - for the right price that is (check out his past financial legal problems). Is it the best self-produced dvd out there - no. Is it worthy of your bigfoot collection - sure.",1200614400,16,2017,5.051051051051051
3033380,5,B000YMGT5E,Excellent research and camera work illustrate the nation wide search for Bigfoot.  This was actually a very good documentary and I recommend it to all who believe there just might be something out there undiscovered.,1199750400,2,216,5.171428571428572
3033381,1,B000YMGT5E,"Ive spoken with Tom on the phone and we chatted about the topic. He spoke about a guy in eastern ID that had a BF hand I should've known it was to good to be true. Once I spoke to others in the know they informed me that hes a known hoaxer. That being said I cant say much good about any of his films and supposed evidence. Ive seen a few of Tom's films and each time I came away feeling like my time was wasted. I'm glad I didn't purchase any of them.
Jeff Meldrum knows his stuff and hes a professor at ISU. Hes the one to follow on the subject. His book Sasquatch: Legend meets Science is where its at.
Ive been actively researching the subject for 12 years or so as well as going on a BFRO outing in 08.",1354492800,,707,3.882758620689655
3033382,1,B000YMGT5E,"Come on people, Tom Biscardi has been involved in at least three major and PROVEN hoaxes when it comes to Bigfoot. The latest being the Georga Bigfoot hoax. This whole ""documentary"" is one giant pat on the back to him. This whole thing is one big hilarious joke. As someone else mentioned there is a lot of filming in at night with no night vision and you can hear the man holding the camera sayiing ""THERE HE IS"", ""RIGHT THERE, CAN'T YOU SEE HIM?"" No you goof it's night time and you are filming without night vision. This happens at least twice during the filming.
Throughout filming Biscardi fires off ""fact"" after ""fact"" with NOTHING to back it up. Then the most annoying thing is the end of the film that shows ""a man being attacked by a bigfoot"". You never see anything of the man but his legs and never hear anything but a few grunts and a well placed ""help"". Now, I ask you. If this was a true video of a man being attacked by a Bigfoot how come 1. A known hoaxer has it 2. the film isn't with a police department because, as Tom says this man was attacked so someone should be investigating it 3. the man being attacked is able to keep the camera in his hands and facing in front of him the whole time he is being attacked instead of using the camera or at least his hands to fend off his attacked.",1324166400,2,1307,4.190476190476191

3033384,1,B000YMGT5E,I was in this documentary. Every piece of evidence in this film has had a legitimate explanation. Of course the documentary spins it like it's a mystery. They never say what something is.,1315526400,,187,4.696969696969697
3033385,1,B000YMGT5E,"This whole DVD is a joke, as is Tom Biscardi. Tom is a huge part of the reason people frown on the field of bigfoot research. He is NOT a researcher and in fact at one point, he stated he was the partner of Ivan Marx, who was one of the BIGGEST hoaxers in the field. The only contribution Biscardi has made to bigfoot research is to tear it down and take a giant step backwards. The DVD is full of false information and is very mis-leading. Biscardi turns the evidence however he wants it, to make it say what he wants it to say. Biscardi was the LEADER in that whole ""we have a dead bigfoot body in Georgia"" a few years ago. He participated and pushed the rumor saying that he actually touched, saw and took tissue samples from the ""corpse"". He said that there was ""no way"" that it was ""a gorilla suit"" and even TOOK MONEY during the whole fiasco...$50,000, I believe. When the whole thing blew up (because it WAS a gorilla suit) and he was exposed as a fraud (again)he was never able to give one red cent of that money back, because he didn't have it any longer. So, I guess you could add ""theif"" to his long list of fakery and bad traits. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. All you are doing is feeding his ego and his pocket, while he seeks and destroys people in the field of bigfoot research. There are plenty of other DVD's and books out there that have good, valid information by people who are genuinely interested in this topic. Purchase any one of those, but don't give Tom Biscardi your hard earned money, he doesn't deserve it.",1304553600,6,1549,4.272108843537415

There is no scientific data ever shown in the film. They talk about all this conclusive DNA from hair samples,a hand and a leg that were found. The data they claim proves it is non-human or is not any known primate. So wouldn't the scientist that made the study be really eager to talk about finding the DNA of a new species? There is not one scientist, archeologist or anyone with a non red neck background that is interviewed in this film. Tom Biscardi's only credentials are self given.

I love the big foot controversy, but this doesn't give any useful information. So watch for entertainment only.",1300233600,,721,4.714285714285714

I don't know if the people in this doc are for real or not, im a believer in sasquatch but i have to say most of this documentary is false, all these people finding large footprints, well footprints are so rare in themselves but not in Biscardis documentary. The alleged bigfoot leg is clearly a Bear, come on maaaaaan, its obviously a bear and all the footprints are fakes, probably courtesy of biscardis cronies.

3033389,4,B000YMGT5E,"I have watched every Bigfoot movie/documentary out there and this one is basically legit. Tom Biscardi and his researchers/crew do a pretty good job at getting the point across about Bigfoot. He offers many different perspectives/viewpoints of eye-witness accounts. Tom appears to fall a little short with his patience when he interviews the head of Farm and Land Bureau in his (the eye-witness)county.
If I had to provide a negative it would tough, however, one particular issue comes to mind when eye-witnesses see/hear/fire at or discover tracks, Tom's team will determine usually that the evidence is inconclusive. However, when they are researching an island, a team member states that they were being followed and fresh tracks were located, so what does Tom say for Bigfoot evidence? DEFINITE! THIS DID NOT SEEM FAIR AND WAS SLIGHTLY BIASED TO ME.
All and all--I would say purchase this DVD and decide for yourself--it is still pretty decent with information.

3033391,5,B000YMGT5E,"I got this movie from my gramma for my birthday last year. It was such a coincidense because I was just talking to her on the phone about how badly I need to hunt down and kill bigfoot in order to make a name for myself in the science expert world. You see, it's been pretty hard to be taken serious latly after I lit myself on fire when I attached the jumper cables from my car to a Ghost Radar Gun I invented. The gun itself was originaly designed to be fully powered by an internal battery pack, but I had only just ordered the parts from Amazon and they had not arrived yet.

When I attached the cables to the Ghost Radar Gun, something went horribly wrong and I was severly electrocuted. The jolt of electricity destroyed the Ghost Radar Gun's thermal imaging screen and blew me 10 feet into the road! When I awoke from unconciousness, several neighbors were standing around me in a circle and my pants and Rick Morranis T-shirt were on fire and smoking! I screamed for help, but no one helped. I think they are still mad about me killing the Hegelbeck's golden retriever.

When I start thinking about how some of my inventions have caused me and my mother such grief, I like to watch this Bigfoot DVD and pig out on balogna sandwhiches! It always makes me feel good and gives me the strength to keep inventing!",1253836800,,1316,4.345528455284553

Next time I'll listen to that inner voice.
There is nothing here any more ground breaking or earth shattering than there is on your average TV special on the subject. Nothing I ""Knew"" about the topic changed and the film didn't take me deeper into the world of Bigfoot. If the same old rehashed reports, (""I saw Bigfoot...he walked like this...I was a-skeered"") and uneven, overly dramatic footage from the field are what passes for what is new and exciting in Bigfoot research, then maybe this IS the Citizen Kane of Bigfoot documentaries.
If you have ever watched more than one History Channel or A&E show on the topic of Bigfoot then you have already seen this film.

3033402,5,B000YMGT5E,"""Bigfoot Lives!"" certainly has to be the finest Bigfoot/Sasquatch film that has ever been produced to date!  There are so many great aspects of this movie that could be listed here in this review but the limited space will only permit me to touch on but just a few of the highlights of this highly enjoyable film:  To begin with, the stark beauty of the high quality photography just blows me away! The camera angles are great and the overall photography reminds me of how the late, great film director, John Ford used to love to capture wide-angle, breathtaking landscapes on film.  The technical production values of this movie are of the highest quality.

The overall content quality of ""Bigfoot Lives!"" is of the highest caliber, also.  I would say that Mr. Biscardi and his team have produced a film that contains a wealth of information regarding the subject of Bigfoot that is ""user-friendly"" for the layperson (like me) to follow because it is void of all the scientific jargon that sometimes accompanies other Bigfoot related programs.  This movie is filled also with adventurous, heartstopping moments. The musical score is hauntingly beautiful.  Perhaps you can't help but to be captivated by this movie from the beginning to the end because you are right up there...in real time...with Tom and all the team as they tirelessly conduct each investigation: you are with them as they talk with numerous witnesses, carefully examine evidence, journey from one expedition location to another, ...and so forth.  The conscientious approach that Mr. Biscardi takes in addressing the subject of Bigfoot has resulted in a film that is truly distinctive in content and production value.  Mr. Biscardi made this extraordinary film in such a way that makes the subject of Bigfoot appealing to both the viewer who perhaps may be totally unfamiliar with Bigfoot and also to the viewer who may be the more seasoned ""Bigfooter.""

I highly recommend this wonderful movie! Thanks for your time ...and thank you, Mr. Biscardi for making this fine movie.  I can't wait for the sequel!  May God bless!",1211500800,,2090,4.974137931034483

Eye-witness accounts from mostly new witnesses and law enforcement (minimal reenactments). It features active BF areas in TX, OH, NY, AZ and MN rather than the usual Pacific NW. Three examples of bones and soft tissue are featured (I didn't expect this).

I thought the approach was very honest and the production value was comparable to BF docs seen on Travel Channel but not quite as high as History Channel or Discovery. The producer explains that he had worked with Ivan Marx and some of Marx's controversial photos are briefly featured in the film. I'm judging this piece not on it's evidence (you can decide) but rather it's ability to present evidence, present it clearly and offer enough new material to enhance the BF quest.

The credibility of Mr. Biscardi is questionable in my mind when he referred to the known bigfoot hoaxer Ivan Marx as ""my partner"". He also showed several photos that were obviously hoaxed, including Marx's crippled ""Bigfoot"" and an absurd-looking rubber and hair costume supposedly chewing on a deer's leg.

Also ridiculous was the alleged photo from Clarence, NY, which showed a person in an a bad gorilla suit beside a John Deere Gator.

But the clincher for me was when Biscardi was ""wood-knocking"" on a tree at night and then when the echo came back said ""he just responded!"".

3033410,1,B000YMGT5E,"A friend of mine loaned me this DVD in the hopes that I would become a believer. On the contrary, after watching this video and laughing out loud at times at the absurdity of the supposed evidence, I have now become convinced that the entire thing is a scam. This after going into the video with an open mind. This video leaves more questions than it provides answers (and real proof). The video steadily digresses toward a ridiculous end, almost as if the most absurd, staged encounters would be more believable after a thorough priming. What a crock.

Here are the main issues I had with this documentary:

1) Early in the video we find BF tracks in the mud in a swampy area. Two tracks are side by side, less than shoulder length apart. People don't stand like this when on unsteady footing, why should BF? The viewer is told that there are about ""12 tracks"" leading up to the spot where the two in the video are seen, but these tracks are never shown to the viewer, and no study is undertaken as to the gait of the BF. This is my main problem with the video; statements are made and there's absolutely no proof provided to back it up.

2) None of the video filmed at night was done with night vision (until the very end with Mike's encounter). Many scenes are shot in darkness, as someone is explaining what the darkness is supposed to be showing us. If Biscardi were actually interested in locating BF, he'd use night vision. And don't get confused with the one or two scenes where they say they use ""infrared"". It showed nothing and this is not what you want to be using if you're serious about actually spotting something in the woods at night.

3) I doubt the credibility of many of the supposed eyewitnesses. They talk like they are experts, and their opinions are presented as fact, yet these opinions having no basis in fact are not edited out of the documentary. This detracts from the main premise of the video - that Biscardi will show us proof that Bigfoot exists. My favorite was in Ohio when this one guy was talking about Bigfoot, and said ""there's families of them out here"" with ""babies"", and traveling in packs with ""6-8 females"". LOL.

4) The guy who supposedly shot a BF in Arizona: Biscardi interviews this guy about the shooting, and the scene ends with a BF screaming in pain in the woods (audio added to enhance story). If you've ever hunted, or shot at an animal, you know that the very FIRST thing that you do is go look for the blood trail and try to find what you've shot at. But there was no discussion on this; the scene ends and the viewer is made to accept, at face value, the entire story of the shooting without any discussion of a blood trail, hair, or even tracks. Even if the guy was scared, he could have returned the next day with more people to look for evidence. This account amounts to nothing but a story with no evidence whatsoever to support the shooting.

5) The BF hand: Biscardi claims that the DNA concludes that it is not human, nor from a known primate, but from an unknown species. OK, so where's the proof of this statement? It is never provided. Again, let's just accept Biscardi's word, with no actual physical proof to back it up.

6) Indian Reservation Casts: These casts are HUGE! They rival Biscardi's specimens from Happy Camp CA (20 inches long), which Biscardi claims (earlier in the video) are the biggest ever. Yet Biscardi never addresses that these new casts are some of the biggest ever made. This is very telling.

Also, Biscardi adds to the AZ Dept. of Public Safety Report. The report reads, ""The hairs in Item D are all of non-human animal origin""; Biscardi adds the word ""or"" to read ... ""non-human OR animal origin"" which changes the meaning. Biscardi is trying to say the report is excluding humans and animals; the actual report read that it is excluding humans, but not necessarily known animals.

7) Hans Mobius and the BF by the Gator: This is the dumbest Photshop'd image I've ever seen. The BF image is totally black and lacks any dimension and detail whatsoever. And the picture was taken in broad daylight, yet no detail can be made out, even on close inspection. Furthermore, it's an obvious hoax for two reasons. One is that when you closely inspect the picture, it is pixelated, except for the black, dimensionless image. This indicates that the image was drawn, placed on TOP of the original picture (if the image was taken at the same time as the background, everything would be pixelated not just the background). Worse than this, however, is the Bigfoot's arm. Upon close inspection, it's obvious that its arm is not attached but there is a slight separation from the drawn torso. Only a drawn image would show this.

8) Body Parts: Some guy claims his dog brought home pieces of a Bigfoot. But the Fish and Wildlife took them. Then his dog brought home ""the other foot"", and he ""took pictures of it, video of it"" (Biscardi displays the picture, which is so poor quality it barely resembles a foot). He kept them in the freezer for a time, ""but we finally took it out of there"" and buried it (no reason given). Then this guy ""tries to locate it (later), but couldn't find it"". The video shown in this segment was dramatic but inconclusive. It shows some kind of leg and foot of a small creature (what they claim is a baby BF) but who knows? It's all mangled up and hard to tell, plus Biscardi has no DNA evidence from local testing to talk about, and the evidence was buried after the filming was done and can't be located.

9) Bigfoot skeleton: Wow! They found the needle in the haystack! The viewer is led to a dig site in the middle of the woods in Paris, TX, where a supposed BF skeleton is being excavated. It's about 2 feet in the ground. Biscardi says that they were going to get it analyzed ""and find out what's it's all about"". Then the segment ends. I suppose it was better to turn out the video rather than include more unsubstantiated results. But the bigger question is: what led someone to start digging here in the middle of the woods? This obvious question is never addressed, leading me to conclude that the entire dig site is staged.

10) Mike's encounter: LOL, it looks like Biscardi took a page from the Blair Witch Project with this one! The guy in the video claims that he's bumped in the night by a BF while filming, yet he doesn't even scream. This is poor acting and a dumb way to end the video.

So, after watching this video, Biscardi has left me with one big question: if HE really believes in Bigfoot, why would he put out a video that has so many clearly faked encounters in it? If he were a serious BF believer, he would be ashamed of the things in this video. If Biscardi, who has hunted Bigfoot for 30 years, put this out as the best thing he has to show after all this time, I suspect that knows Bigfoot is a myth. This video takes you on a journey for evidence, but in the end the evidence is always elusive and has either disappeared or is unsubstantiated. As Biscardi says at the end ""Now it's up to you. You either believe, or you don't"". Well, I unequivocally don't! I would rate this video a zero, only I enjoyed the music track, the editing, and the special effects.",1204156800,12,7199,4.44882486732373

3267876,3,B000YMGT5E,"This production is presented by self-proclaimed 33 year long bigfoot researcher Tom Biscardi, not the highest held name in the bigfoot community. He is joined by 'Java Bob' (of Happy Camp 'fame' - locals know what this means). None-the-less, Biscardi takes his group on the road covering many different states and actually presents a few interesting highlights but also some 'so-whats'. There's a number of eye-witness testimonies which are interesting but the photos are iffy and known fakes. There are three very intriguing points in this presentation that really needs to be looked into and expanded upon with conclusions.

A) The unidentified severed hand from Idaho Falls (can be seen on Biscardi's website)
B) Hiriam Upham's juvenile leg video (slightly disturbing when viewed), lost buried in his field - Browning, MT
C) Mike Sell's unidentified large grave skeleton (can be seen on Biscardi's website) and purported 'attack' encounter video - Paris, TX

Downside - Biscardi's constantly saying ""okay"" after every partial sentence as if he is talking to a 10 year old really bothered me. Then there's Biscardi's long time connection to Ivan Marx (known hoaxer) which is not very beneficial to one's credentials (pertaining to bigfoot research anyway). One of his creature photos, I believe, is from the Ray Wallace fakery-collection. But mostly, just Biscardi's reputation isn't that good and he spends as much time pushing himself as he does his 'research'.

It's a 79 minute presentation of which the first 20 minutes or so did very little to interest me, but then it got markedly better and interesting with the above mention three highlights, however, there is also no conclusion to any of those points which is a downer. The thing is, Biscardi is willing to go out there across the country to look into otherwise overlooked reports - for the right price that is (check out his past financial legal problems). Is it the best self-produced dvd out there - no. Is it worthy of your bigfoot collection - sure.",1200614400,16,2017,5.051051051051051

3267879,1,B000YMGT5E,"Come on people, Tom Biscardi has been involved in at least three major and PROVEN hoaxes when it comes to Bigfoot. The latest being the Georga Bigfoot hoax.

As someone else mentioned there is a lot of filming in at night with no night vision and you can hear the man holding the camera sayiing ""THERE HE IS"", ""RIGHT THERE, CAN'T YOU SEE HIM?"" No you goof it's night time and you are filming without night vision. This happens at least twice during the filming.
Throughout filming Biscardi fires off ""fact"" after ""fact"" with NOTHING to back it up. Then the most annoying thing is the end of the film that shows ""a man being attacked by a bigfoot"". You never see anything of the man but his legs and never hear anything but a few grunts and a well placed ""help"". Now, I ask you. If this was a true video of a man being attacked by a Bigfoot how come 1. A known hoaxer has it 2. the film isn't with a police department because, as Tom says this man was attacked so someone should be investigating it 3. the man being attacked is able to keep the camera in his hands and facing in front of him the whole time he is being attacked instead of using the camera or at least his hands to fend off his attacked.",1324166400,2,1307,4.190476190476191

He is NOT a researcher and in fact at one point, he stated he was the partner of Ivan Marx, who was one of the BIGGEST hoaxers in the field. The only contribution Biscardi has made to bigfoot research is to tear it down and take a giant step backwards. The DVD is full of false information and is very mis-leading. Biscardi turns the evidence however he wants it, to make it say what he wants it to say. Biscardi was the LEADER in that whole ""we have a dead bigfoot body in Georgia"" a few years ago. He participated and pushed the rumor saying that he actually touched, saw and took tissue samples from the ""corpse"". He said that there was ""no way"" that it was ""a gorilla suit"" and even TOOK MONEY during the whole fiasco...$50,000, I believe. When the whole thing blew up (because it WAS a gorilla suit) and he was exposed as a fraud (again)he was never able to give one red cent of that money back, because he didn't have it any longer. So, I guess you could add ""theif"" to his long list of fakery and bad traits. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.

Tom Biscardi and his researchers/crew do a pretty good job at getting the point across about Bigfoot. He offers many different perspectives/viewpoints of eye-witness accounts. Tom appears to fall a little short with his patience when he interviews the head of Farm and Land Bureau in his (the eye-witness)county.
If I had to provide a negative it would tough, however, one particular issue comes to mind when eye-witnesses see/hear/fire at or discover tracks, Tom's team will determine usually that the evidence is inconclusive. However, when they are researching an island, a team member states that they were being followed and fresh tracks were located, so what does Tom say for Bigfoot evidence? DEFINITE! THIS DID NOT SEEM FAIR AND WAS SLIGHTLY BIASED TO ME.
All and all--I would say purchase this DVD and decide for yourself--it is still pretty decent with information.

There are so many great aspects of this movie that could be listed here in this review but the limited space will only permit me to touch on but just a few of the highlights of this highly enjoyable film:  To begin with, the stark beauty of the high quality photography just blows me away! The camera angles are great and the overall photography reminds me of how the late, great film director, John Ford used to love to capture wide-angle, breathtaking landscapes on film.  The technical production values of this movie are of the highest quality.

The overall content quality of ""Bigfoot Lives!"" is of the highest caliber, also.  I would say that Mr. Biscardi and his team have produced a film that contains a wealth of information regarding the subject of Bigfoot that is ""user-friendly"" for the layperson (like me) to follow because it is void of all the scientific jargon that sometimes accompanies other Bigfoot related programs.  This movie is filled also with adventurous, heartstopping moments. The musical score is hauntingly beautiful.  Perhaps you can't help but to be captivated by this movie from the beginning to the end because you are right up there...in real time...with Tom and all the team as they tirelessly conduct each investigation: you are with them as they talk with numerous witnesses, carefully examine evidence, journey from one expedition location to another, ...and so forth.  The conscientious approach that Mr. Biscardi takes in addressing the subject of Bigfoot has resulted in a film that is truly distinctive in content and production value.  Mr. Biscardi made this extraordinary film in such a way that makes the subject of Bigfoot appealing to both the viewer who perhaps may be totally unfamiliar with Bigfoot and also to the viewer who may be the more seasoned ""Bigfooter.""

The producer explains that he had worked with Ivan Marx and some of Marx's controversial photos are briefly featured in the film.

3267902,5,B000YMGT5E,"This dvd ""Bigfoot Lives"" was a wealth of imformation for those of us who are interested in this creature and those of us who skeptics. It is not just a documentary but a docudrama. Kudos to the people who came forward with their testimonials. It proves that this elusive creature is alive and well and in various locations of this United States. It takes someone who has the powerful belief, research and enthusiam of Tom Bicardi to pull off these expeditions and find the proof that these creatures exist. I give this dvd 5 stars for its inforamtion, direction, drama.  All around an action packed film.  I will look forward to more to come.",1209254400,,642,4.62280701754386

I enjoyed hearing the testimony from numerous witnesses, the way they travel around the country and collect reports, information and evidence.  It is  worth purchasing.  I enjoyed the DVD so much, in fact I purchased a second for the Auction at the 2008 East Coast Bigfoot Conference.  Tom and crew should be commended for the DVD and the work that they have done.

3267905,1,B000YMGT5E,"After watching this I became less convinced that bigfoot might exist. There was no ""hard"" evidence gained and the researchers were looking for clues that supported their theory, which is the absolute wrong way to approach any investigation.

The credibility of Mr. Biscardi is questionable in my mind when he referred to the known bigfoot hoaxer Ivan Marx as ""my partner"". He also showed several photos that were obviously hoaxed, including Marx's crippled ""Bigfoot"" and an absurd-looking rubber and hair costume supposedly chewing on a deer's leg.

Also ridiculous was the alleged photo from Clarence, NY, which showed a person in an a bad gorilla suit beside a John Deere Gator.

But the clincher for me was when Biscardi was ""wood-knocking"" on a tree at night and then when the echo came back said ""he just responded!"".

Overall a very disappointing, uninspired and unconvincing effort.",1207094400,6,889,5.110344827586207
3267906,4,B000YMGT5E,"This documentary produced by Bigfooter Tom Biscardi, was actually quite well-done and much happened during the course of filming. The journey begins in Paris, Texas, where Tom and his team (Tommy Biscardi, Jr. Java Bob Schmalzbach and the Squatch Detective himself, Steve Kulls) come across some interesting tracks and they also have a sighting through a thermal imager of a large bipedal animal. The next location is Minnesota, where Don Monroe joins the group and they investigate sightings in the area and have more activity. Other locations include Arizona, New York State, Idaho and Montana. In Idaho, the mysterious ""Hand of Unknown Origin"" is discussed and determined to be-well, watch the DVD for your self to find out. In Montana, an unusual leg is discussed and a video is shown of it. All in all, this is one of the better docs I have seen recently.",1204934400,2,860,4.897260273972603
3267907,1,B000YMGT5E,"A friend of mine loaned me this DVD in the hopes that I would become a believer. On the contrary, after watching this video and laughing out loud at times at the absurdity of the supposed evidence, I have now become convinced that the entire thing is a scam. This after going into the video with an open mind. This video leaves more questions than it provides answers (and real proof). The video steadily digresses toward a ridiculous end, almost as if the most absurd, staged encounters would be more believable after a thorough priming. What a crock.

Here are the main issues I had with this documentary:

1) Early in the video we find BF tracks in the mud in a swampy area. Two tracks are side by side, less than shoulder length apart. People don't stand like this when on unsteady footing, why should BF? The viewer is told that there are about ""12 tracks"" leading up to the spot where the two in the video are seen, but these tracks are never shown to the viewer, and no study is undertaken as to the gait of the BF. This is my main problem with the video; statements are made and there's absolutely no proof provided to back it up.

2) None of the video filmed at night was done with night vision (until the very end with Mike's encounter). Many scenes are shot in darkness, as someone is explaining what the darkness is supposed to be showing us. If Biscardi were actually interested in locating BF, he'd use night vision. And don't get confused with the one or two scenes where they say they use ""infrared"". It showed nothing and this is not what you want to be using if you're serious about actually spotting something in the woods at night.

3) I doubt the credibility of many of the supposed eyewitnesses. They talk like they are experts, and their opinions are presented as fact, yet these opinions having no basis in fact are not edited out of the documentary. This detracts from the main premise of the video - that Biscardi will show us proof that Bigfoot exists. My favorite was in Ohio when this one guy was talking about Bigfoot, and said ""there's families of them out here"" with ""babies"", and traveling in packs with ""6-8 females"". LOL.

4) The guy who supposedly shot a BF in Arizona: Biscardi interviews this guy about the shooting, and the scene ends with a BF screaming in pain in the woods (audio added to enhance story). If you've ever hunted, or shot at an animal, you know that the very FIRST thing that you do is go look for the blood trail and try to find what you've shot at. But there was no discussion on this; the scene ends and the viewer is made to accept, at face value, the entire story of the shooting without any discussion of a blood trail, hair, or even tracks. Even if the guy was scared, he could have returned the next day with more people to look for evidence. This account amounts to nothing but a story with no evidence whatsoever to support the shooting.

5) The BF hand: Biscardi claims that the DNA concludes that it is not human, nor from a known primate, but from an unknown species. OK, so where's the proof of this statement? It is never provided. Again, let's just accept Biscardi's word, with no actual physical proof to back it up.

6) Indian Reservation Casts: These casts are HUGE! They rival Biscardi's specimens from Happy Camp CA (20 inches long), which Biscardi claims (earlier in the video) are the biggest ever. Yet Biscardi never addresses that these new casts are some of the biggest ever made. This is very telling.

Also, Biscardi adds to the AZ Dept. of Public Safety Report. The report reads, ""The hairs in Item D are all of non-human animal origin""; Biscardi adds the word ""or"" to read ... ""non-human OR animal origin"" which changes the meaning. Biscardi is trying to say the report is excluding humans and animals; the actual report read that it is excluding humans, but not necessarily known animals.

7) Hans Mobius and the BF by the Gator: This is the dumbest Photshop'd image I've ever seen. The BF image is totally black and lacks any dimension and detail whatsoever. And the picture was taken in broad daylight, yet no detail can be made out, even on close inspection. Furthermore, it's an obvious hoax for two reasons. One is that when you closely inspect the picture, it is pixelated, except for the black, dimensionless image. This indicates that the image was drawn, placed on TOP of the original picture (if the image was taken at the same time as the background, everything would be pixelated not just the background). Worse than this, however, is the Bigfoot's arm. Upon close inspection, it's obvious that its arm is not attached but there is a slight separation from the drawn torso. Only a drawn image would show this.

8) Body Parts: Some guy claims his dog brought home pieces of a Bigfoot. But the Fish and Wildlife took them. Then his dog brought home ""the other foot"", and he ""took pictures of it, video of it"" (Biscardi displays the picture, which is so poor quality it barely resembles a foot). He kept them in the freezer for a time, ""but we finally took it out of there"" and buried it (no reason given). Then this guy ""tries to locate it (later), but couldn't find it"". The video shown in this segment was dramatic but inconclusive. It shows some kind of leg and foot of a small creature (what they claim is a baby BF) but who knows? It's all mangled up and hard to tell, plus Biscardi has no DNA evidence from local testing to talk about, and the evidence was buried after the filming was done and can't be located.

9) Bigfoot skeleton: Wow! They found the needle in the haystack! The viewer is led to a dig site in the middle of the woods in Paris, TX, where a supposed BF skeleton is being excavated. It's about 2 feet in the ground. Biscardi says that they were going to get it analyzed ""and find out what's it's all about"". Then the segment ends. I suppose it was better to turn out the video rather than include more unsubstantiated results. But the bigger question is: what led someone to start digging here in the middle of the woods? This obvious question is never addressed, leading me to conclude that the entire dig site is staged.

10) Mike's encounter: LOL, it looks like Biscardi took a page from the Blair Witch Project with this one! The guy in the video claims that he's bumped in the night by a BF while filming, yet he doesn't even scream. This is poor acting and a dumb way to end the video.

So, after watching this video, Biscardi has left me with one big question: if HE really believes in Bigfoot, why would he put out a video that has so many clearly faked encounters in it? If he were a serious BF believer, he would be ashamed of the things in this video. If Biscardi, who has hunted Bigfoot for 30 years, put this out as the best thing he has to show after all this time, I suspect that knows Bigfoot is a myth. This video takes you on a journey for evidence, but in the end the evidence is always elusive and has either disappeared or is unsubstantiated. As Biscardi says at the end ""Now it's up to you. You either believe, or you don't"". Well, I unequivocally don't! I would rate this video a zero, only I enjoyed the music track, the editing, and the special effects.",1204156800,12,7199,4.44882486732373
