2553393,5,B000F6ZBM6,The intricate layers of the Molly Maguires are revealed in the History Channnel presents dvd. What makes this such a good point of reference is the fact that the dvd covers history realistically and incorpoartes family feedback of relatives affected by this group on both sides of the coal industry-that is laborers and owners. It emotes deep thought and emotions as well.,1168300800,16,372,5.016129032258065
8118088,4,B000F6ZBM6,"Word of mouth family history had my Great Grandfather dying in a coal mining ""accident"" that was purportedly ""encouraged"" by the Molly Maguires. My own research has since disproved this allegation, but the video did lend some additional insight into the lives of the early immigrant coal miners and my own heritage.",1473552000,,315,5.076923076923077

8118094,5,B000F6ZBM6,"This provides a good look into the history of this area and its times.  The documentary also provides a balance of analysis and supposition as to the causes of the turmoil.
It is an excellent partner to the film ""The Molly Maguires"" starring Sean Connery.",1348185600,2,255,4.666666666666667
8118095,5,B000F6ZBM6,"We learned recently that our ancestors were involved in the coal region of Pennsylvania and became interested in learning about the Molly Maguires. Years ago we had seen the movie  (before we knew the connection) but that is a blend of truth and Hollywood storytelling. The History Channel had done an excellent job explaining the Mollies in context of both the coal region and the origins of the group in Ireland. As you would expect, some dramatization is used, but mostly the information is put forth through interviews with historians, townsfolk who still live in the area and an excellent collection of vintage photographs.",1276473600,8,628,5.038461538461538
8118096,5,B000F6ZBM6,"This is the history of the Molly Maguires from the region where I grew up so I ordered this DVD.  It was great so I lent it to a neighbor, who is from Ireland because he knew of the Molly Maguires.  Unfortunately he has a Doberman puppy who ate it so I ordered my second one because I really enjoyed it the first time.  This one I'm NOT lending my neighbor.  I have no quames about ordering from Amazon.com.  I have purchased many items through them and everything has arrived ahead of schedule and in excellent condition.",1222732800,2,522,4.34020618556701
