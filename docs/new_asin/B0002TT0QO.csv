8031804,5,B0002TT0QO,"Ok, if you're interested in Sci-Fi like I am AND, you're an action junkie ( like  me ) then you've first got to purchase
a movie titled , "" The Mysterians "" because it is the prequel to, "" Battle in Outer Space "". They're both very good and extensively use
miniatures which move!
  The script writing is adequate, the acting is good as is the characterization.
  Now, here's a short low down on this movie. ... In the Mysterians, some Japanese scientists discover that there are aliens attempting to build a base in Japan. Well, the Japanese don't like that at all but, they like the second reason why the Mysterians are here even less. You see, the aliens want to mate with human females and, the Japanese don't like that at all.
  So, the people of Earth band together to fight off these women stealing aliens while the Mysterians attempt to stop them with flying saucers, a metallic robot that looks kinda like godzilla and their dome that can pop up out of the ground for defensive purposes.
  The Earth people combat these obstacles with two rocket planes and, the Markalites. The people of Earth finally win and the Mysterians are driven off.
  Then, in the sequel to the Mysterians, the Earth forces detect an alien base on the moon and realize that is where the MYsterians went to after getting the boot off of the planet so, the military forces of Earth mount an expedition to go to the moon and try to get rid of the Mysterians.
  The aliens use some subterfuge and blow up one of the two rockets that were sent but, the second one remained intact. Eventually, there is this energy weapon fight on the moon. The alien base is destroyed, and the humans get in the last rocket and burn for home.
  If you're like me and love the action films, then both of these movies are for you, especially if you like Sci-Fi! - The Anonymouse",1404345600,4,1837,4.441791044776119
