6456240,1,B00L16P1TC,"I think if you are a fan of Derek Jeter or the New York Yankees, you can find most of the video you want from these sets either via through various DVD releases or online somewhere, and thus do not really need to shell out the extra cash for this set. If you really want to buy this set, with its watermarked video and material selection that fluctuates between redundant and questionable, then go right ahead but you were warned. Technically, the set looks and sounds fine but lacks any extras, so again, buyer beware.",1434499200,,519,4.473684210526316

6456245,3,B00L16P1TC,"This set is ok, but since the 96 and 01 games do not have Yankees radio audio track, it gets 3 stars. I hope we can get some regular season games from Jeters career, especially his first game in 96, and the July 1, 2004 game.",1411603200,5,225,3.9130434782608696
6456246,5,B00L16P1TC,"If I'm not mistaken, two of these games have NOT been previously released (1996 ALCS Game 1, 2001 ALDS Game 3).  The other two games are available on the World Series Collections from 2000 and 2001.  All in all, I'm happy with two new games for a fairly low price.  Since they're not listed in the product description, these are the 4 games:

Fan Aids Jeter Home Run (1996 ALCS Game 1): A 24-year-old Andy Pettitte starts, Derek Jeter hits a fan-aided home run, and Bernie Williams ends it with a walk-off home run in the 11th inning.

Jeter Leadoff Home Run V. Mets (2000 World Series Game 4): Jeter leads off with a home run and Mariano Rivera shuts the door, putting the Yankees one win away from closing out their crosstown rivals. Bonus Yankees and Mets radio audio.

The Flip (2001 ALDS Game 3): Jorge Posada's home run holds up a Mike Mussina gem, but Jeter's ""flip"" steals the show and keeps the Yankees alive.

Mr. November (2001 World Series Game 4): After a tense pitchers' duel, ""Mr. November"" is born. Bonus Yankees radio audio.",1410480000,25,1041,4.53475935828877

8663023,4,B00L16P1TC,"The price is right on this nice little dvd package.  It is true half of the dvds are available on other collections. Still, at roughly $4.50 a dvd,it is worth it  to own the 1996 ALCS game 1 and The 2001 ALDS game 3. If you're a Yankee fan it is a must to have these memorable games in your collection.",1453939200,4,302,3.9344262295081966
