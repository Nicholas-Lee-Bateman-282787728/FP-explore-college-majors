7832505,5,6302967589,"I had the book. I was looking for a way to grab my 12 year old granddaughter's interest in science and physics. I looked at the book, and decided it was too long and too detailed for my plans though it is an outstanding book in its own right. I didn't really want a vhs tape, but that was all that was on offer, and difficult to come by besides. I had the tape player, and an Amazon supplier had one copy. Sorry I don't remember his name. He supplied a new set of tapes, as advertised, and my granddaughter them and always wanted just one more episode. The programs might be dated what with all the particle fever going on, but this series did all I could ask for my granddaughter.

  I have no idea why PBS has never made a DVD for this series. If you want to enthuse a high school student with physics, get thiese tapes.",1427068800,,822,4.125
