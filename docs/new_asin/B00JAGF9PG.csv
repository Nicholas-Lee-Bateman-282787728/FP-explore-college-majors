6351664,3,B00JAGF9PG,"I wish the whole movie would have been David Lynch talking to Harry. I think Harry was really comfortable with David Lynch but not the same chemistry or comfort with anyone else. If you liked this movie i would suggest watching Milius about writer/director John Milius, its on Netflix now and probably on Amazon instant stream too.",1400457600,3,331,4.824561403508772
6351665,5,B00JAGF9PG,"Harry Dean Stanton's natural, unaffected singing is more autobiography than a million tell-alls.

David Lynch: How would you describe yourself?
Harry Dean Stanton: There's nothing. There is no self...",1399334400,4,200,5.896551724137931
6351666,5,B00JAGF9PG,"Then you'll love him now. Who would have thought flat singing could ever sound so soulful ? The man exudes power by hardly even speaking, This is such a well directed piece, how they got such a private man to open up his heart was amazing.",1398988800,2,239,4.217391304347826
6351677,5,B00JAGF9PG,I'm a HDS fan and this is a great profile of him. I learned a lot and appreciate him even more.,1422576000,,95,3.5714285714285716
6351678,5,B00JAGF9PG,"Harry Dean Stanton talks about letting go and not letting go, and he's lived well so he knows what he's talking about.
There's a lot of power in his silence and a lot of poetry in his singing.
And that face! When he closed his eyes it was like a pause between two guitar notes.
Full of humor and integrity, with beautiful photography and excellent sound, this film is a keeper.",1419724800,5,377,4.323943661971831
6351679,4,B00JAGF9PG,HARRY IS GREAT.........,1418515200,,23,7.0
6351680,5,B00JAGF9PG,I really enjoyed this. Well worth watching if you are at all a fan of his work.,1415836800,,79,3.7058823529411766
6351681,4,B00JAGF9PG,"I've always seen HDS in movies and wondered more about him. This documentary is a great depiction and representation of the actor. If you want to know more about Harry Dean Stanton, watch this! It's a treat!",1412294400,3,207,4.621621621621622
6351682,5,B00JAGF9PG,A bit slow. Harry Dean sings as much as he talks. Left wishing for more.,1412121600,,72,3.8666666666666667
6351683,5,B00JAGF9PG,Any one that loves Harry Dean will love the DVD.  I give this an excellent rating.,1407801600,,82,4.125
6351684,4,B00JAGF9PG,"Yes, that's ""Individual"" with a capital ""I""! This film is more of document of an interesting character, craftsman and artist than a more traditional biography with a straight timeline. I admit that I would have liked to see a little more about certain parts he's played and people he's worked with, but who they did talk with is wonderful and I'm fine without hearing much of the personal tidbits anyway.

Also, if you like your documentaries with an artistic edge I would say this is a very visually evocative film. Moody, atmospheric and beautiful looking.",1403136000,5,558,4.873684210526315
6351685,5,B00JAGF9PG,"I thought it was terrific. Maybe I'm more of a Harry Dean Stanton fan than the other reviewer. It doesn't have HDS with a mic attached to his shirt, answering questions like, ""What was filming 'Repo Man' like?"" But it DOES have HDS singing, with an unseen guitar and backing vocalist. (I have wanted him to put out a CD of his singing for years, and when I buy the soundtrack [for some reason the soundtrack isn't coming out for a week or so after the DVD] I'll finally have one.) His track on the ""Paris, Texas"" soundtrack, Cancion de Mixtexa, well...it's heart-breaking.

You can see on his face that ""here's a guy who's been around a while."" If you watch (the clip is in this movie) HDS's face in ""Straight Story"", when he realizes that his brother drove a lawnmower just to see him; well, it's a scene that makes me tear up. And just from the gradual change that comes over HDS's face. It's a stunning bit of acting. Wordless, yet full of meaning. And wonderfully mixed into this film.

See, I like HDS. I would even go so far as to say he's one of my favorite actors. And even though there was a lot of singing...no, I'll say DUE TO A LOT OF SINGING, the DVD is worth every penny. The camera just kind of follows him around. He talks to old friends. He talks with David Lynch, who counts five films he's made with HDS. It's fascinating to me. And I cannot believe that anyone who considers himself a fan of HD, this movie is not a must-have. I loved every minute of it. HD singing Roy Orbison's ""Blue Bayou"" completely, with no cuts...what can I say? If after reading that, you don't want this movie, then by all means, stay away.

He talks about his next movie. Just the fact that HDS is still acting puts a smile on MY face.

A stunning film following a stunning man, who just happens to be a great actor, too. Now, if reading this review made you smile, and made you want this DVD, I can only say that I KNOW you'll like it. Correction: Love it as I did.",1402185600,13,1962,4.2520107238605895
6351686,1,B00JAGF9PG,"I waited so long to see this.  All I can say is rent it from Netflix before you buy.  We couldn't believe how bad it was.  Amateurish in every way, never had a point, never set up any sense of anticipation or questions in the viewer, annoyed with having to sit through him singing not one but two songs in the first ten minutes before ever getting to any point at all.  Just awful.  Even the questioning of the actor sounded like it was for a seventh grade paper.  Buyer beware.  Rent and preview before you buy.",1401840000,2,512,4.216494845360825
8649408,5,B00JAGF9PG,Great tribute to a great actor and character Harry Dean is a much better singer than I expected,1530144000,,95,4.333333333333333
8649409,5,B00JAGF9PG,"This actor is a singer, and this singer is an actor whose work I've loved over the years.  Sure, a supporting actor.  Always interesting.  These guitar and voice pieces come from the film, which I also highly recommend.",1517356800,,219,4.7105263157894735
8649410,5,B00JAGF9PG,Very moving portrait of a very interesting man.  Songs in Spanish especially good.  Loved it;,1517184000,,93,5.133333333333334
8649411,5,B00JAGF9PG,A must watch for Harry Dean lovers.  Didn't know he loved to sing so much.,1515196800,,74,3.933333333333333
8649412,5,B00JAGF9PG,I Love Harry Dean Stanton's Work,1511740800,,32,4.5
8649413,5,B00JAGF9PG,"Loved this; HDS not only reveals what it takes to be a lifelong actor, but he's a great model for those of us who need to learn to just stick by a hard-won real-life persona and enjoy ourselves. I also just discovered another documentary in which HDS shines: ""char-ac-ter"", directed by Drago Sumonja.",1510444800,2,300,4.679245283018868

Let alone watching it!!!",1472947200,,57,4.8
8649415,5,B00JAGF9PG,What an interesting character but there was something about him that I found very touching and very sad.,1470700800,,104,4.833333333333333
8649416,5,B00JAGF9PG,Left me wanting more because Mr. Stanton is just so engaging.  He reminds me so much of my favorite uncle in his sweet nature and common sense.  Who knew he was also a charming singer.,1442620800,2,184,4.228571428571429
8649417,5,B00JAGF9PG,I could say it's very Zen and that would be true. But it would also miss the point. I didn't want this movie to end.,1437696000,2,116,3.68
