8478013,5,B005LAJ1S6,"I sure wish this was available now for my son-in-law's birthday. I guess he will have to wait for Christmas. This series is a cut above most sitcoms. It excels with sense of unity as Friends did and Big Bang Theory does. It's easy to fall in love with the characters. It's witty, clever, and wholesome. Of course Tim Allen is superb, but so are Nancy Travis, Hector Elizando, and the three young actresses who play the daughters. Well done ABC.",1349136000,9,444,4.493827160493828
8478014,5,B005LAJ1S6,I was a huge fan of Home Improvement since it's humor could touch everyone at some point. I was not let down when this new series arrived. Tim Allen has been my favorite stand up comedian for as long as I can remember. His humor doesn't rely on ridicule but on just the funny things that happen to us on a daily level. Now his persona had reappeared in Last Man Standing and has morphed into a comedy that fits our daily life just as well as Home Improvement did. I love the show and all it's characters. Here's hoping that Last Man Standing has a good ten year run!!,1348790400,8,567,4.163636363636364
