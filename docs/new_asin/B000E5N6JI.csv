8106230,4,B000E5N6JI,"La Mesa Que Mas Aplauda/The Table Dance(2006) takes place in the poor, humble Mexican town of San Pascual El Chico. Three working class women Pilar, Jenny, and Lupita are sexually harassed by the mayor's son Nacho and they each attack him in self defense!  Mayor Cienfuegos uses his power as Mayor to have each woman fired from their jobs! An exotic dancer from Las Vegas, Berenice(Liz Vega), arrives in town and she plans on helping Pilar, Jenny, and Lupita by opening a strip club. Will their new business succeed with Cienfuegos still in office?
 LMQMA isn't award-worthy cinema, but it's a fun, breezy, lightweight 90 minute film with some solid acting. The film's plot may have been inspired by a song from the band Grupo Climax. Grupo Climax also makes a guest appearance in the film. Director Rene Cardona III knows how to work with broad humor. Sergio Corona plays a priest who has a witty sense of humor(""Stripers don't go to hell. Las Vegas or Cancun, but not to hell!""). Aside from some mild profanity, there's not a lot of objectionable content in the film. LMQMA feels like a Frank Capra movie mixed with a Russ Meyer movie. The cute, sex kittenish Hanny Saenz really caught my eye. She looks and sounds a bit like pop star/actress Thalia.

I rented LMQMA from Netflix and that version is different from the DVD version that I bought from Amazon. In one scene, Padre Carmelo(Corona)tells Lupita that he was watching a movie about Padre Amaro(a priest who broke his vow of chastity). In the second version, there's an alternate take with Carmelo telling a different woman(a blonde) the same thing. I guess there's more than one version of LMQMA out there.

La Mesa Que Mas Aplauda is fun piece of fluff and I recommend it.",1207612800,2,1734,4.712871287128713
