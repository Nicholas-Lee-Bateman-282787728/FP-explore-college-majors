7984358,1,B00008HE5B,"Charley tends bar for a friend of his uncle who smokes cigars and is about to die from it. Charley's friend TK gets killed and Charley's friends enact revenge while Charley doesn't participate. He would rather sit and give us some first person narration.

The acting was bad. The sound was choppy. The dialogue was Jackie Chan in ""Rush Hour""... ""What's up my N@#$er."" Yes, this is one of those films where the N-word is frequently used to address people. The rap/hip/hop sound track was tailored for the specific scenes. If they had spent the same  time on the film aspects as the sound track, we would have a decent movie. People die, but bullets never leave the gun when they are shot. We see a gun pointed, then a still with sound, then someone falls over. It was that low budget.  The film itself was about an hour long. The last 19 minutes is a video of a movie I would have liked to have watched instead.
