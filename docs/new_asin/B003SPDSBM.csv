4189137,5,B003SPDSBM,It was an entertaining and funny anime. Is too bad that ended so quickly leaving you wandering what would happen next. I hope someone finish this story just as well written as the original author. If you buy this anime you will enjoy it.,1288483200,4,237,4.409090909090909
4189138,3,B003SPDSBM,"Kazuma Kannagi was a member of a clan whose skills lay with the fire arts. Not good for him, as he has no talent with fire. After being defeated by his younger cousin, Ayano, his father banishes him from the house and he disappears. Four years later, he returns, now a skilled master of the wind arts, and he has changed his name to Kazuma Yagami. Now Kazuma and Ayano must team up to fight various sinister threats with their awesome ninja power.

When I read the description of this series on AnimeNewsNetwork, I thought it sounded a little cliched, but fun. Then, as I started watching, I found I had been deceived. The synopsis paints Kazuma as the main character, but in actuality, it is Ayano. This means instead of a cool, rebellious, young man OUT of high school as the focus of the show - we get a pushy, hot tempered, and none too bright, Ayano, who is in high school. This change in focus kills anything interesting this show might have had. The plot is lame, the fire art Ayano has is boring, though Kazuma's wind art is kind of cool, it doesn't get much screen time. Ayano is a really flat character.

On a bright note, yes this really is the entire series. It is the first, and only, season. The ending isn't very clean, but unfortunately, the author of the light novels Kaze no Stigma was based on died leaving it unfinished.

Kaze no Stigma isn't bad, it is just not good either. I have watched lots of anime and have lost all patience with mediocre shows.
If you haven't been exposed to much anime, and are looking for an action show with ninja powers, this would suit you just fine.

I wonder if there really will be a season 2 to this awesome anime.

Gotta admit, the ending to the first season is kinda like a cliff hanger since alot of the story elements are left unanswered, such as the Almagest and Stars of Sagacity",1281916800,,300,4.4363636363636365

4189262,3,B003SPDSBM,"This series could have been better had the two main characters, Kazuma and Ayano, not been cousins due to the romantic angle they were in. And to me it felt like that the makers of the show had to compromise with each other on when to let Ayano's undergarments be exposed in some way. Why couldn't they have just drawn her in pants or put shorts on her under her school skirt when she goes off killing things? I enjoyed the characterization of Ayano's friends and Ren a whole lot better and it helped me watch the series.",1387497600,,521,4.326530612244898
4189263,2,B003SPDSBM,"I bought it along with a bunch of other series like it around the same time on my birthday one year without knowing what they were like at all. This series was cheap, long, and had good reviews (I didn't read them so as to avoid spoilers, though), so I thought I'd get a large amount of series like this one so that i could get more for the little bit of money I had.

Here's what I got out of the series:

1. I've seen many animes before this, so I feel like I've seen this plot too many times.

2. When they start to introduce new characters, they almost ALWAYS kill them off or send them away to never return after two episodes, so you aren't able to get attached to the characters (I liked that angel guy [who's name I forgot]. I wanted to get attached to him! Ugh...)

3. The plot is all over the place. It starts out making it look like the whole plot will be about Kazuma eventually getting back with the family and all sorts of acceptance, but then I jumps from plot to plot. I felt like I was being thrown around, and it wasn't fun.

4. I didn't really care for the opening or ending theme song (not the biggest problem, but I never really felt like stopping to watch either of them before or after any episode, which is something I do with songs I like very well).

5. You don't feel attached to Tsui-Ling at all (you'll understand later. Not gonna spoil it).

6. There were times where it tried to be a harem series, but abandoned the idea immediately.

7. They threw in an annoying blonde from America as another love interest. Did I mention that she was annoying? At least they didn't keep that girl with the short hair...

8. The only characters I actually liked were Ren and that girl Ren liked that _____________ (left a blank so as to hide spoilage).

9. I liked how the head of the Kannagi family was secretly trying to get Kazuma and (forgot the red-head's name already even though I just finished the series yesterday) to have sex (it's funny). Also, my favorite episode was the one with the hotsprings episode (not because of the little bit of fanservice, but because Kazuma and his Dad were trying to kill each other the whole time which was super hilarious).

10. Part of me liked AND hated how the two never actually kissed on the lips. It was creative how he would kiss almost anywhere but her lips, but to be honest, I didn't feel like they made a good couple. Neither of them go well with anybody!

11. The last villain was very lackluster. I heard that the maker of this anime died which is why there's no more of it, but you're left wanting more. Part of me is upset that there's no more of it since many questions are just left hanging in the open, and the rest of me is glad because I don't have to waste my money on anymore of this series.

12. There was only a smattering of pantyshots. Don't flame me! If they're going to add pantyshots, they should add more fanservice than that. The thing is is that the pantyshots didn't add anything to the series. It just turned it into a series that i knew I could never comfortably watch with my mom (not that I'd want to even if there wasn't any pantyshots. I did NOT enjoy this series well enough to re-watch it any time soon).

13. This is the biggest problem: by the end of this series, I realized I never got attached to a single character in the series. Kazuma is invincible (with one weakness which he got over all-too-quickly) so he never had room to grow. That redhead (seriously, how did I forget her name?!) was just a random tsundere character. Sure, she didn't have much power, but since she's supposed to be the next Kannagi head of family, I feel like they messed up on that. They made her too weak!

Fans of this show are gonna hate me for this review. Usually I don't rate animes so low. Normally my reviews are high, 4-5 star reviews (mostly five) but I just couldn't like the series. I tried. I honestly did.

Since I'm a collector and I've had my hits and misses, I won't be sending it back. I want to own as much anime as I can, so I'll'll keep it anyway. I'm sure that there's some friends I can let borrow it that would enjoy such a series. I hope I enjoy the next series I watch more than this one.

Also, this series would be rated 1 star, but I liked the onsen episode (super funny!) and Ren is adorable.",1387324800,,4304,4.235653235653236

The reason is, it starts to get very good for as a final battle, but kinda leave you in a cliffhanger kinda way. It's like their was another series that was about to begin but I guess it never happened. Other than that, great music, very few panty-shots, and a lot of action with just a blood scenes but not much to describe as gruesome. Their are some questions that really never get answered in the end, but that's the only downside for this anime. Other than that, it's well worth the buy.

I don't want to spoil the ending so I won't get into it too much but the author to the manga had died before it was completed...this anime has a strong ending even if it never continues.

The plot follows a couple of magicians from the same family but with different powers trying to save Japan. It was good, but it felt so empty! The ending had little conclusion and felt rushed. Literally, after I finished, I said ""Where's the rest?"" There is little to no explanation of why Kazumi is the Kaze no Stigma, or any explanation period.

Sure this story has been done over and over again but this has been done very well and keeps it interesting, with a bit of comedy. and action.  Tie in a bit of Super Natural and a tiny bit of fan service and you got this enjoyable Anime.

Supernatural, Action, Adventure, comedy and a little fan service this anime has it all!!  If your still wondering watch a few episodes online and decide for your self but as for my self this was well worth the price.

4189299,4,B003SPDSBM,"I wasn't sure what to think about it before watching it. I had not read up on it or anything. I literally got it because I liked the artwork on the box and it was a good deal for a full series. After it was all said and done I put the last dvd back in the box feeling pretty satisfied at my watching experience. I won't take you through all of the storyline details but here is the basic premise of the show. You have the Kannagi magic using family who has a son who can't use the family magic. He is basically exiled from the family, goes off and gains power ... We pick up when he arrives back in town and he reunites with his family members. From there we have family drama, plenty of action and a lot of laughs. The series really has the feel of a long 200+ ep. series condensed down to 24 episodes. The great thing is that it still plays out nice without feeling like it is rushed through. You get several different story arcs with a few elements that carry throughout to glue it all together. You have action arcs, character arcs, comedy arcs, and even the obligatory hot springs episode. It is not a fan-service oriented type episode, for those wondering. Pretty much, it has all of the various arcs a long series would contain. Each arc plays out nicely and in an amount of episodes that seems to flow well. The characters are all enjoyable and are voiced well for the most part. Watching the relationships between Kazuma, Ayano, and Ren mature was a strong part of the series for me which I enjoyed. The action sequences were also engaging and fun to watch ... nothing like watching some magic users kick some butt. This series would have been enjoyable to see continue with several more seasons ... it had the right formula to carry on. Although I got a kick out of the Kannagi family and their adventures I have to knock a star off because some of the characters and the music were a bit of a stereotype.",1352851200,2,1915,4.292817679558011
4189300,3,B003SPDSBM,"I went into this series with high hopes. Characters who can manipulate the elements are a personal favorite meme of mine, and this had the makings of an excellent example of the genre. You have the outcast who overcame his own limitations, only to return to the shores that scorned him to seek closure.  Then there is the spoiled princess who took his legacy and made it her own, despite a relative lack of brains and power upon their reunion. Set in a backdrop of monsters and family politics, what's not to love?

As it turns out, that ends up being quite a bit.

Oh, the first story arc is rather grand, and a couple of the secondary plot lines are quite interesting, but as the series progresses you feel like several pieces of information have been ignored or underdeveloped on purpose. Whether this was due to a planned sequel that never materialized or lackluster story-boarding it's difficult to say.  But the end result is a number or excellent characters and mythos that just do not reach their full potential.

If you are looking for reasonable Anime that will intrigue you without having the strength to draw you in, this series is worth the investment. But please, don't expect the depth of other more iconic titles like Cowboy Bebop or Escaflowne. You'll only end up disappointed.

I have heard that the original story was both darker in the original source materials, a series of light novels, and left incomplete with the death of the author. The fact that these novels are not translated, to the best of my knowledge, and will not be completed is a crying shame. The seeds of greatness are here, they just appear to be destined to wither in their current environment.",1352505600,,1684,4.672297297297297

Its quite fast paced alot of good axction and comedy, the VA's did a superb job as always wich is what i expect from the cast of funamation. Also for the price ya cant go wrong so if ya want a light hearthed fast past action/comedy series u really cant go wrong,, now for the down side. The story is incomplete wich is a shame cause id like to seen where the creator was gonna take us. This is the only season of this series and most likely their will never be a 2nd season cause the creator of the series has died so theirs noone left to continue on with the story. Most likely noone will pick it up and continue with it from my understanding this is really taboo in japan so we only have the 1 season.

This title is full of action and adventure. There is some pretty solid character development too. The animation and the soundtrack are also pretty good.

4189305,5,B003SPDSBM,"Ok, The story begins with Ayame, a redheaded fire magic user with a big appetite. She is part of the Kanage family, which years ago, exiled the main character Kazuma for being unable to perform fire magic. That, and the fact that it was his mother and father that threw him out has made Kazuma a little hateful towards the Kanage family. So as the deaths of a handful of fire users coincides with the return of Kazuma, the Kanage family begins to suspect him as the murderer. After the grandfather accepts Kazuma's word that he's innocent, he sends Ayame and Kazuma on ever more missions together to eliminate the yolma threat. If only the Kanage family knew how powerful Kazuma really was in comparison to the fire magic wielding Kanage.
Ayame and Kazuma slowly begin to draw closer together as the series comes to a close, and he gains the respect of everyone in the family.

All in all i rate this 5 out of 5 stars. there aren't any cons accept that it isn't longer.
If you've seen Naruto's fights, this is just as pumped up with action, even more cool, and doesn't have a theme song every 5 minutes.
I recommend to any anime fan that likes darker than black, angel beats, evangelion, high school of the dead, ect.

4189307,4,B003SPDSBM,"The packaging is one of the newer, better packaging designs.  It is easy to remove and replace discs without bending them but they do not fall off if you jostle the case.  I mention this because many of my other anime purchases have involved rather irritating packaging.

The single biggest annoyance I find with anime DVDs is the number of commercials (that you can't skip to get to the menu).  I know this set has some because I used a normal DVD player to watch part of the series, but I was out of the room while they were playing so I didn't pay attention to how long it took to get through all of them.  The rest of the time, I used a player that goes straight to the menu so I can't really comment on how annoying the commercials are.

This set includes an extra called ""Ayano's House Call:  All-You-Can-Eat Cakes"".  I saw the name and thought it must be a short DVD-only anime.  It's not.  It's just a series of (sort of) interviews, which I'm sure is great if you care about that sort of thing, but I don't.  I have never been all that keen on listening to a bunch of giggling seiyuu talk about nonsense.

As for the anime itself, I really enjoy it but it isn't exactly a masterpiece.  It earns its points being fun.  There are plenty of reviews for the show on the internet, so I'm not going to waste time elaborating.  I do not like Bleach, Naruto, Code Geass, Gurren Lagann or many of the other shows commonly loved by ""anime fans"".

4189309,5,B003SPDSBM,"Full, non-spoiler review courtesy at ~ Book & Movie Dimension a Blog ~

In this anime is Kazuma Kannagi is out for revenge. Due to past events, he lost his lover and when he did he pledged his allegiance to gain power. Kazuma was originally a son of the Kannagi family of who had strong powers connected to ""Enjutsu"" but which he was lacking in. His family wanted him to manifest the Enraiha or  Blaze Lightning Supremacy sword but couldn't so he was shunned. This flame has the strangest power. Most manifest the fire power but only a few. Kazuma didn't manifest your average at all. So he was completely helpless when his lover was in danger. Now after he's amassed power he's seeking the person responsible for her death. Just as he's sitting in motion and planning to avenge Tsui-Ling, he encounters Ayano Kannagi who is a distant family relative. Though despises him at first she also seems to slowly get along with him when realizing there is more to than everyone sees. And it becomes obvious she has romantic feelings toward him as well. Although her family wants forget together for social status while she doesn't want to have any of that.  Ayano is definitely a willful person and the carrier of the Enraiha. So some heavy arguments ensue where we further encounter connections between various mages who wield magic from fire, earth, and wind.

Kaze No Stigma, Kazuma's Eyes turn Azure blue (referred to as The Stigma of the Wind) when he uses his wind powers
The ending for Kaze No Stigma was one that didn't capture a whole resolution but rather closure for mostly. It's obvious carries a lot of hate and guilt over 's death, so with the ending of the anime he gets some peace. Kaze No Stigma is much more invested in its characters that its plot development. Throughout the anime it seems fights against various opponents which are entertaining to see. If just for their quirky personalities and their pursue to find answers to the perpetrator of Tsui-Ling's (Kazuma's lover) demise. Your sure to get moments of being a real baddass from Kazuma against his enemies and displaying his unique wind stigma or ""F'jutsu"" (using the wind) which he obtained from The Wind Spirit King after feeling for a time he had to gain his own power after his family saw him as useless. If you enjoy power displays ,then you will enjoy watching Kaze No Stigma. The animation is very colorful and bright and found not entirely unique in any particular way except a little. In terms of anime animation it's just a bit expected but the actual characters are of course one-of-a-kind. The animation is just alright. It doesn't really jump out as being particular special like Blood +, Bleach, Gilgamesh, Code Geas: Lelouch of the Rebellion , and or say Speed Grapher.

Almost entirely a watch if you love anime to that of Bleach and or Code Geass.
Yes, meaning power plays where the main characters triumph over their enemies quite gloriously. For me it was quite intriguing throughout since Bleach is one of my favorite animes.

Genre: Action/Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Romance

Contains: Dark side, Developing Powers

Anime Soundtrack Side-note: The Opening Theme song is ""Blast of Wind"" by Saori Kiuji and fits perfectly to the anime.
The Ending Theme songs of which there are two but only one Op  are ""Hitorikiri no Sora"" by Saori Kiuji and the second ending theme is ""Matataki no Kiwoku"" by Ayumi Fujimura which found not to awful but not fantastic. The Opening in my opinion is so much better but to each his own.",1334880000,8,3517,4.724306688417618

4189311,4,B003SPDSBM,"This was a show I was ready to dismiss due to the story sounding too much like too many other anime shows that I have seen. I originally saw this on Netflix, but ended up buying the DVD for my collection after enjoying it so much.

There is a lot of your typical anime elements...boy & girl team with magical abilities fight demons. There is your obvious sides of good & evil in the story. However, as the story progresses we see many shades of gray with our main character Kazuma, and we have to start wondering if he is a good guy or not. Kozuma is in essence the prodigal son returning to a family he has broken off relations to. His backstory of what took place after exhile is revealed throughout the series, and we start to see his twisted path has not always looked pretty or heroic. Ayano is the good girl who has become heir to the family's power, although she is too immature & impetuous to be trusted in a position of authority as our story takes place. Kazuma has achieved great power on his own, and can easily defeat powerful opponents. He has a desire to prove it his old man & take him out in battle. Ayano has a lot to learn, but has an inner strength & optimism that Kazuma lacks. She is loyal to her family & trying to bring Kazuma back to a rational perspective on things. It is the interaction & character development between the two that made this stand out above other ""battling mages"" anime shows.

It is a show that I could keep watching, but sadly the original author passed away a few years ago. Although much more story could be told, this anime does end at a good place that brings closure to the events depicted. The evil is still out there, but the battle at hand is over and our two main characters have crossed a dramatic hurdle in their relationship by the end of this series.",1332806400,,1810,4.2894736842105265

4189314,4,B003SPDSBM,"Kaze No Stigma does not receive the respect it should. Have i seen better - sure, but the story is very strong. The characters are endearing and the animation is done well. I have not watched the subbed yet although I did purchase the DVD during the big anime sale at Amazon. I have always enjoyed the dubbed even though Ayano can't become irritating with her tirades.

There is a little fan service but it is conservative by many anime standards.

My only regret is that it wasn't a blu-ray option.

I strongly recommend that you add Kaze No Stigma to you collection.",1314489600,2,568,4.495145631067961
4189315,4,B003SPDSBM,"Kaze no Stigma: The Complete Series is a four-disc set that contains all twenty-four episodes of the series.  The box contains two slimline boxes, and each slimline box holds two DVDs.  The first slimline is labeled as ""Volume 1 - Wind,"" and the second slimline is labeled as ""Volume 2 - Fire.""  The first disc of each set contains seven episodes, while the second disc in each set contains five episodes and the extras.

The second disc in the first slimline has three extras.  The first is labeled as ""Ayano's House Call: All-You-Can Eat Cakes.""  There are three parts to this extra, which are videos that run for approximately ten minutes each.  The videos feature the Japanese voice actors for the characters of Ayano, Yukari, and Nanase.  During these videos, you see them at a fan event and dinner, traveling through the streets of Kobe, and an ""early morning ambush"" at their hotel.  These videos include Japanese audio with English subtitles.  It appears that these three voice actresses had an Internet show they did in Japan that had a connection with Kaze no Stigma, and that these videos were filmed and originally included on the Japanese DVD releases of the series.  While I understand FUNimation wanting to include extras on this DVD release, I felt that including these videos on an American release was a bit of a stretch.  Since I've never seen this Internet show, it was a little hard for me to entirely understand what was going on.  This disc also contains ""Textless Songs.""  The songs included in this feature are the opening, as well as both of the ending credits songs that appear in the series.  The final extra on this disc is ""Trailers.""

The second disc in the second slimline also has three extras.  The first is parts four through six of ""Ayano's House Call: All-You-Can Eat Cakes.""  All three of these parts focus on a ""Reflect on our Errors Meeting"" in Osaka.  All of the discussion that takes place in these parts deal with the aforementioned Internet show.  The ""Textless Songs"" are exactly the same as what appears on the other disc in this set that has extras.  The final extra is more trailers.

Overall, I thought the series itself was actually quite good.  There was a bit of fanservice, especially in regards to a number of panty shots of Ayano; however, the fanservice really doesn't distract from the story being told in the series.  There is also some blood seen in the series, especially in some of the earlier episodes.  My one main complaint is the fact that the ending does feel a little rushed.  However, the buildup to the ending is worth going through.  I also appreciated how Kazuma's younger brother, Ren, was treated as much as a main character as Kazuma and Ayano.  Typically in anime, the ""cute"" younger siblings are relegated to supporting roles, so it was nice to see Ren break that stereotype.

Personally, I would recommend Kaze no Stigma: The Complete Series to fans of the series, as well as to viewers who enjoy stories about magic users who can manipulate the elements.

4189317,5,B003SPDSBM,"This series is probably the coolest ever!  If you like weird spiritual-supernatural powers, a weird corny and commedic friendship/not quite ""love"" story, Adventure, and much more without all that unnecessary phsico drama you'll love this series.  (Sucks to hear the Author pastaway before finishing; they really did an awesume job on this one and I was hoping to enjoy more of their work.)
It starts with a guy with supernatural powers being accused by his ""family"" (who basically disowned him after he 'failed' them) of commiting a crime against them.  The whole event turns into him winding up being hired to 'help' teach/partner up with the future Head of the 'family' so she could learn to calm that flaming temper of hers as well as master her owe supernatural abilities.  All the while Helping the unlikely partnership aid eachother in over coming their own commical flaws and journey in life.
Hope you enjoy it.",1291420800,4,918,4.941558441558442
8404587,4,B003SPDSBM,"Really strange, well written to fit the Japanese mind, sometimes difficult for those of us outside of Japan.

This is a pure magic story, just set in a world where magic is common but still somehow kept hidden from public view. The female characters are better written and more believable than the males, but face it, none of it is something we can believe in, just a good story at a good pace.

I can see the gaps in the characters, but I don't know how to fill them.

Still worth the ride.",1524787200,,491,4.258064516129032

8404591,5,B003SPDSBM,I love this series. Not gonna lie I first watched it because of the similarity of the characters looks to those of the main characters in Sword Art Online. But this show is so good I found the books (novellas) that it is based on. Unfortunately as anime goes there is only one season even though there totally should be more. I love the main characters they are quite deep I feel compared to some anime characters. Yes there is a bit of fan service but that also comes with the territory. All in all worth getting for your anime library.,1511913600,,537,4.326732673267327
