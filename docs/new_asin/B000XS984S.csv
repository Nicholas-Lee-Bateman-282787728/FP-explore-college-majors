8325929,3,B000XS984S,My Daughter LOVES this show. We use to have Discovery Kids in Spanish on cable and when we moved we no longer get it. I purchased these DVD's hoping they would come in Spanish or at least a language option. Unfortunately to our dissapointment they are only in English. If it weren't for the language barrier these DVD's would be a five star purchase.,1272326400,,350,4.484375
