8418709,5,B0048JGQOS,"Since I'm a huge Cipollina fanatic (the reason I became a musician) and saw ""Electric Gunslinger"" I've always wanted to see the full length versions of these songs. Songs like COBRA and EDWARD THE MAD SHIRT GRINDER are worth the price alone! The band sounds very good as well as the sound. Although I wouldn't say Nicky Hopkins is very animated, it's great to see footage of this rarely filmed LEGEND up close doing what he does so well.
The weak point I would say and have always thought Terry Dolans vocals were never on the same level as the rest of this unique band. That said, they play as a team and have chemistry you can see, feel and hear. If you're a JC fan I would say go for it! I also recommend the Gravenites/Cipollina DVD which is also from Rockpalast. In fact I'd actually rate it a better collection of songs. Nick Gravenites being one hell of a Blues singer/songwriter/musician/storytellers.
Or just buy the both of 'em! I feel thankful to have a well produced and sounding concert of a long gone era of Rock and Roll artistry.",1331942400,2,1045,4.476439790575916

Dolan more or less screams the vocals @ 1 note. Oh Well????",1308355200,,123,4.166666666666667
