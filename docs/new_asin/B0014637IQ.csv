3123473,5,B0014637IQ,"I've been watching sample songs on You tube and decided I needed the entire concert. The quality is excellent and what a pleasure to hear the duo live. Arthur's voice has not diminished in quality here- but it's one of the concerts where you will here his voice before it sounds strained I later years. The magic in Paul Simon's production is a keeper in this DVD- his song writing, voice and composition. I love it. The highlighted song for me is Bridge over troubled water.",1467331200,,475,4.534883720930233

3123516,5,B0014637IQ,We watched this concert on our local PBS station and were so impressed that I ordered it.  We'd like to see it through again without all of the PBS advertising.

3123524,5,B0014637IQ,"The ""Simon and Garfunkel Concert in Central Park"" is one of the all time great live concerts!! I am a decades long appreciator of their evocative and prophetic music. I was so much looking forward to this DVD. The first time I ordered this through Amazon, the DVD would not play in a U.S. DVD player. I had to return it. I spoke with Amazon customer service and the friendly fellow assured me that the second option listed would play because it was marked for ""all regions"" and there was no warning about area restrictions. However, when that second purchase arrived, the DVD was not the one pictured and did not play in a U.S. DVD player. The screens on both DVD purchases said no playback ""due to area limitations."" Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed and really wish Amazon was able to direct me to where (on their site) I can purchase the ""Simon and Garfunkel 1981 Concert in Central Park"" that will work for Region 1 USA and will actually play on my DVD player. No one I spoke with in Amazon customer service seems to know.",1442102400,,1037,4.463157894736842

It captures a moment in time when two of the greatest artists of our generation were at the peak of their abilities.  I am amazed by the clarity of sound.  You would not believe it was filmed outside in front of 500,000 onlookers--it seems so intimate.

Such a contradiction should be unacceptable to Amazon, while obviously confusing to customers.  It's one or the other.

I bought this DVD from a marketplace seller who stated that its product was ""Region 1"".  But Amazon immediately warned me that it was PAL.  So Amazon enhanced the contradiction I was trying to avoid.

3123569,5,B0014637IQ,"Great concert; a must-have for anyone who grew up in that era (I would say also for those who did not). There is nothing wrong with it.

This review will probably show up under both versions of the dvd, so if you see it under the one that has few problems playing (the NTSC one), category 1 below may not apply. But there are a good many complaints about the one my search took me to first. They generally fall into three categories:

1. DVD will not play.
2. The sound/picture/overall quality isn't as good as it should be.
3. Finally, there was at least one person who said that the pair looked bored during the last part of the concert and how dare they betray their fans like that.

I'll try to address each of these from my viewpoint, YMMV:

1. This _IS_ a region-free disc (I checked it out with a couple of nifty little programs I have). Unfortunately, it is also PAL standard and cannot be handled by an NTSC (the American standard) TV. I place the blame for this problem squarely on Amazon. When I searched ""Simon and Garfunkel concert in central park dvd,' I was dropped first at this item, and the PAL notice is in tiny little print and easily overlooked. In the US, Amazon should always make the first choice fully US-compatible and leave the non-standard for those who want to look for it. There is an NTSC version of this same dvd listed, but you have to go looking for it, and you should not have to. There are ways to avoid this situation in the future. A multi-region dvd player that has a standard converter built in (almost all of them do) costs very little and will make all your problems with compatibility as well as region go away; alternatively, if you are willing to run it through your computer, there is software available to accept both standards and make them watchable (and also take care of the region problem and strip off the copy protection at the same time). Google is your friend.

2. The quality of the sound/picture/whole thing is abysmal; why didn't they do all things necessary to give it the quality of a concert hall performance so it would feed my superb surround-sound speakers?  Well, first off, it's not a concert hall performance; it's an open air performance given to an audience of hundreds of thousands of people, who account for the (objectionable) background noise. Had it been manipulated until it fully utilized your sound system, there would be just as many complaints the other way about the sound being overly sanitized. I look at it this way: if I had been there in the midst of that crowd, I would have heard more background noise than is heard on this dvd, and the music would have seemed to come from a point source (or two, depending on location and setup); ergo, this is probably even better than actually being there. Authenticity--it's great.

2B. The instrumentals are dated. Ah, Sherlock! That concert was performed over thirty years ago, and sadly there was no way to look ahead to see what the fashion would be in the future.

3. I saw only one review in which a person was complaining about the performers' attitude and the contempt they showed for their fans in the last part of the show; after reading that, I didn't go looking for a second one. First, I did not notice such a an attitude; and, second, even if it were so, there was an excellent excuse for it. That fan running up on the stage in the middle of ""The Late Great Johnny Ace"" would have been enough to leave anybody a bit shaken, particularly considering the subject of the song. To be suddenly made aware that there are hundreds of thousands of people there, any one of whom could be a loon with a gun, would be sobering for anyone. I know that had I been in that situation, I would have had to leave the stage for a complete change of underwear. I think that they recovered like pros and carried on admirably.

S&G never should have broken up as was proven with their subsequent careers never matching the success of their joint collaboration.  Their harmonies are always pitch perfect and their timing is impeccable.  Paul Simon may have been the machine behind the success, but if it were not for Art's flawless voice and vocal range, I believe the duo would not have experienced the same degree of acceptance and love from their fans if it were Paul alone.  Even though Art Garfunkel is proficient on multiple instruments and has displayed a talent for composing, I think it would have been interesting to hear what their joint collaborations would have been like had they composed together.  Art has stated in interviews that he may have felt blocked by Paul because he did it so well.  But listen to ""The Thread"", by Art in 2003 and you will see that he can compose.  Too bad, but it seems more often than not,  egos and personalities always get in the way of great partnerships and then we all lose.  These guys are going to 70 years old this year.

3123600,5,B0014637IQ,"This reunion concert with Simon and Garfunkel in Central Park, recorded in 1981, was historically, a very important event for many of their fans fortunate enough to be present for the performance, as well as the rest of us who caught it on PBS, as part of one of their more successful pledge drive efforts.  Though, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel had split over artistic and [no doubt] personality differences, this concert really was the bridge made over their troubled waters, to reacquaint two old friends together through the music that had brought them so close in the past.

Even twenty-six years later, you can feel the real passion that these two men have for music,  and for the best songs from their repertoire.  Paul Simon penned many great hits, during his time spent recording with Garfunkel in their musical partnership.  They include songs like ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" their interpretation of the traditional folk ballad, ""Scarborough Fair,"" ""America,"" ""Mrs. Robinson,"" ""Wake Up Little Susie,"" and a slew of other tunes.  Those two have a haunting quality to their performances that truly sounds like a throwback to the era of minstrels from the middle ages, yet, the arrangements fuse ""old"" together with ""new,"" sustaining their fanbase that they acquired in the 1960s, as well as newer listeners drawn in by the more modern arrangements.

I spoke with Amazon customer service and the friendly fellow assured me that the second option listed would play because it was marked for ""all regions"" and there was no warning about area restrictions. However, when that second purchase arrived, the DVD was not the one pictured and did not play in a U.S. DVD player. The screens on both DVD purchases said no playback ""due to area limitations."" Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed and really wish Amazon was able to direct me to where (on their site) I can purchase the ""Simon and Garfunkel 1981 Concert in Central Park"" that will work for Region 1 USA and will actually play on my DVD player.

3358066,5,B0014637IQ,"Great concert; a must-have for anyone who grew up in that era (I would say also for those who did not). There is nothing wrong with it.

This review will probably show up under both versions of the dvd, so if you see it under the one that has few problems playing (the NTSC one), category 1 below may not apply. But there are a good many complaints about the one my search took me to first. They generally fall into three categories:

1. DVD will not play.
2. The sound/picture/overall quality isn't as good as it should be.
3. Finally, there was at least one person who said that the pair looked bored during the last part of the concert and how dare they betray their fans like that.

I'll try to address each of these from my viewpoint, YMMV:

1. This _IS_ a region-free disc (I checked it out with a couple of nifty little programs I have). Unfortunately, it is also PAL standard and cannot be handled by an NTSC (the American standard) TV. I place the blame for this problem squarely on Amazon. When I searched ""Simon and Garfunkel concert in central park dvd,' I was dropped first at this item, and the PAL notice is in tiny little print and easily overlooked. In the US, Amazon should always make the first choice fully US-compatible and leave the non-standard for those who want to look for it. There is an NTSC version of this same dvd listed, but you have to go looking for it, and you should not have to. There are ways to avoid this situation in the future. A multi-region dvd player that has a standard converter built in (almost all of them do) costs very little and will make all your problems with compatibility as well as region go away; alternatively, if you are willing to run it through your computer, there is software available to accept both standards and make them watchable (and also take care of the region problem and strip off the copy protection at the same time). Google is your friend.

2. The quality of the sound/picture/whole thing is abysmal; why didn't they do all things necessary to give it the quality of a concert hall performance so it would feed my superb surround-sound speakers?  Well, first off, it's not a concert hall performance; it's an open air performance given to an audience of hundreds of thousands of people, who account for the (objectionable) background noise. Had it been manipulated until it fully utilized your sound system, there would be just as many complaints the other way about the sound being overly sanitized. I look at it this way: if I had been there in the midst of that crowd, I would have heard more background noise than is heard on this dvd, and the music would have seemed to come from a point source (or two, depending on location and setup); ergo, this is probably even better than actually being there. Authenticity--it's great.

2B. The instrumentals are dated. Ah, Sherlock! That concert was performed over thirty years ago, and sadly there was no way to look ahead to see what the fashion would be in the future.

3. I saw only one review in which a person was complaining about the performers' attitude and the contempt they showed for their fans in the last part of the show; after reading that, I didn't go looking for a second one. First, I did not notice such a an attitude; and, second, even if it were so, there was an excellent excuse for it. That fan running up on the stage in the middle of ""The Late Great Johnny Ace"" would have been enough to leave anybody a bit shaken, particularly considering the subject of the song. To be suddenly made aware that there are hundreds of thousands of people there, any one of whom could be a loon with a gun, would be sobering for anyone. I know that had I been in that situation, I would have had to leave the stage for a complete change of underwear. I think that they recovered like pros and carried on admirably.

S&G never should have broken up as was proven with their subsequent careers never matching the success of their joint collaboration.  Their harmonies are always pitch perfect and their timing is impeccable.  Paul Simon may have been the machine behind the success, but if it were not for Art's flawless voice and vocal range, I believe the duo would not have experienced the same degree of acceptance and love from their fans if it were Paul alone.  Even though Art Garfunkel is proficient on multiple instruments and has displayed a talent for composing, I think it would have been interesting to hear what their joint collaborations would have been like had they composed together.  Art has stated in interviews that he may have felt blocked by Paul because he did it so well.  But listen to ""The Thread"", by Art in 2003 and you will see that he can compose.  Too bad, but it seems more often than not,  egos and personalities always get in the way of great partnerships and then we all lose.  These guys are going to 70 years old this year.

3358097,5,B0014637IQ,"This reunion concert with Simon and Garfunkel in Central Park, recorded in 1981, was historically, a very important event for many of their fans fortunate enough to be present for the performance, as well as the rest of us who caught it on PBS, as part of one of their more successful pledge drive efforts.  Though, Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel had split over artistic and [no doubt] personality differences, this concert really was the bridge made over their troubled waters, to reacquaint two old friends together through the music that had brought them so close in the past.

Even twenty-six years later, you can feel the real passion that these two men have for music,  and for the best songs from their repertoire.  Paul Simon penned many great hits, during his time spent recording with Garfunkel in their musical partnership.  They include songs like ""Bridge Over Troubled Water,"" their interpretation of the traditional folk ballad, ""Scarborough Fair,"" ""America,"" ""Mrs. Robinson,"" ""Wake Up Little Susie,"" and a slew of other tunes.  Those two have a haunting quality to their performances that truly sounds like a throwback to the era of minstrels from the middle ages, yet, the arrangements fuse ""old"" together with ""new,"" sustaining their fanbase that they acquired in the 1960s, as well as newer listeners drawn in by the more modern arrangements.
