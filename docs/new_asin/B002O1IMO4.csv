8375847,1,B002O1IMO4,"Having read several books on Claude Dallas and the transcript from his appeal, I found an over abundance of errors in this documentary.  For the novice it might be entertaining but for anyone with knowledge about the case, this DVD will infuriate you.  I was actually in Bull Camp a few years ago and some of the scenes from the DVD are not from the area.  Other than some willows along the South Fork Owyhee River, there are no trees for miles in and around Bull Camp.  The DVD appears to be biased and wants the viewer to draw a conclusion based on their erroneous and distorted facts of the case.  Even some of the interviews they conducted where obviously biased where emotions played to the camera rather than facts of the case.  Purchase the DVD for entertainment purposes only because if you are looking for facts regarding the Claude Dallas incident look elsewhere.",1300579200,,873,4.636363636363637
