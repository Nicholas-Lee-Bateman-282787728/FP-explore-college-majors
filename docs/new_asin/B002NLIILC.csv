when she comes to California.  I am waiting for her to make a DVD on eyebrows.",1455667200,,216,3.8
8375127,5,B002NLIILC,"I found this training DVD amazing.  The artist is truly an artist to the nth degree.  I use to work in the fashion show production industry--the make up techniques she uses are perfect for show make up and fashion print, but she walks you through step by step and builds up to it.  So, the beginning stages work for the more natural look.  This is a must have for your collection.  The models on the DVD are beyond gorgeous too; what great canvases to work on for these techniques.  It was a pleasure to watch.",1351382400,,510,4.315789473684211
8375128,4,B002NLIILC,"This is a great Video! I love the creativity that the artist was able to create on the models, however this video is not for beginners. I wish the video include more shots of the actual eye shadows and brush that the make up artist used...I guess I will just catch that on youtube. All in all, this is something to buy!",1323734400,2,319,4.161290322580645
