3590782,5,B001G0MFQU,"This is the most original show I have seen in a long time. It is an amazing look at what life with a person suffering from multiple personalities could be like. At the same time, a lot of the issues dealt with this in this show every family deals with. It shows the struggle a family faces in defining themselves as a family as well as individuals. A classic in the making. Set your TIVO!",1235692800,30,388,4.1866666666666665
3590783,5,B001G0MFQU,"This show is not only entertaining but educational.  I am MPD and have a husband and 4 children (most grown now). My family have watched the episodes more than a few times, pause it, and talk about how that situation has happened in our family and how it has affected each member.  This is the first time that we have been able to communicate how we are feeling and how MPD impacts our lives and relationships.
  I don't think people should critize something they have not experienced first hand.  Being MPD it is easy for me and my family to see her triggers and understand how difficult it is for everyone.

3590784,5,B001G0MFQU,I am astounded that people are only giving this series a 3. It is the first series in a very long time that has actually had me laughing so much my sides hurt. If people are going to over analyze the characters then it really takes away from this show. Tara's character is very believable and her family all deals with her disorder in different way. So far I find the most humorus character has to be Buck. When she goes to recital of her daughter and afterwards is in the parking lot what she says had me laughing so hard.. I won't spoil it but this show is hands down a must for people that can in some ways relate to all the disfunctional things that go on in our lives. Tara just has her own way of escaping and not dealing with it. I cant wait for this to releas on DVD.,1233705600,,775,4.038961038961039
3590785,4,B001G0MFQU,"I just saw the preview video on Showtime and found it enjoyable and entertaining. Showtime is known for its controversial and over the top shows with twists. Such as Dexter, Weeds, The L word etc......It's what keeps the audience coming back for more. I don't think that any disrespect was ment torward's the patients  and family and friends of the people that suffer with multiple personality disorders. As medical profesional I've seen what the disorder has done to families( it's very sad ) and also have seen some stability when patients stay with their medication.
I took the show for what it was....entertaining, a wonderful cast of actors/ characters and I would like to see where they take us down the road and how they handle this as a family. Showtime has a habit of mixing intense situations with humor...so we will see. I think as an audience we should give it a chance.",1232150400,2,882,4.7272727272727275
3590786,1,B001G0MFQU,"The morons who wrote this tripe know nothing at all about Multiple Personality Disorder. I, myself, with a dear friend who is a multiple, know very little of this tragic disorder, but I'm very sure one small thing the writers/researchers/producers/director NEVER researched. To my knowledge, multiples CANNOT TRANSITION AT WILL without something triggering such a change. I've experienced a few of my friends alters, as ""they"", and my friend refer to them, and each transition was prefaced with some form of emotional event, which, inevitably, brings my friend to tears, and, within a few minutes, an alter surfaces.

In Tara, the lead character, changes personalities seemingly at will, with nothing triggering such change. Her alters differ like night and day. At one point, she's  a married mother of two (a son and a daughter), conversing with her family. Another scene has her going thru her daughter's closet, dressed and acting like a teenager herself. Still another, as a horny trollop, and ending this torturous half hour garbage as a dyke, who, oddly enough, gets into a fist fight with her daughter's freaked out, Boy George look alike, wacked out, and pierced boyfriend, aided by none other than her geeky looking son. Too weird for me. I'm quite sure my friend will be as offended as I was.",1230595200,10,1303,5.0

Part of the fun of this show is getting to know each alter and each member of the family. They are all developed so well. While they all have issues, they are all likable in their own ways. My only lukewarm review is of John Corbett. He's not bad. He doesn't detract from the show. He's just John Corbett. The same John Corbett you get in every other John Corbett show/movie.",1466121600,,493,4.369565217391305

3591186,5,B001G0MFQU,"Toni Collette is remarkable!  The show is based around a woman who suffers from Dissociate Identity Disorder (DID), formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder.  The main character is Tara, a married with two children woman who has recently gone off of her medication.  She has suffered a trauma that she cannot remember and it plays out in the alter egos that are there to protect her from the pain of the trauma.  As she transitions into her alter egos, it is very believable that they are a separate identity with multi-faceted characteristics. The supporting cast is great!  I especially love the teenage angst ridden son.  His story is very relatable for the younger generation. I am half way thru Season 2 and I can tell you that once you start watching, you won't want to stop.  It's only been 2 days since I started....",1464048000,,831,4.729166666666667

Is there such a thing as a low key or semi-normal multiple personality that doesn't cause a scene each time it appears? I find this show embarrassing. I guess that's why it only lasted 2 Seasons. I do enjoy watching Brie Larson's smart aleck teen character. It's more true to life. I know MP is a bizarre affliction, but does she have to act so crazy 100% of the time? Her sister Charmaine is such a narcissist too. Hardly anyone in this show is likeable. With the exception of Max (sometimes) & Neil & Kate.",1457308800,3,608,4.342105263157895

I think it brings up some of the realities of long term issues that stem from abuse and trauma. I think it is honest on most accounts, even if it is a bit exaggerated.

Everyone has a aura or forcefield that surrounds the human body.  When there are rips and tears in it. a entitiy who has passed on but is still wondering on Earth because they do not know they are dead, can accidently get caught in someone's auric field. If they are in it long enough or become strong enough can take over the person for a brief periods of time. With the use of Radionics they can be removed within a 24 hour period. After they are removed and moved on ward with their own incarnations. The auric field or forcefield is then sealed up, protecting the person from any further invasion and take over.  Many people who go to wild concerts where the music is blasting at them will blow the forcefield wide open.  The lower darker  entities know this and flock to these concerts in hopes of entering a human. This is the only way they can experience life as a human because they are on a lower ladder of life forms. For those that are going through this problem there is hope so don't get discouraged.

3591626,4,B001G0MFQU,"Make no mistake. This is not  a comedy, although there are humorous parts-----just like real life!  This is a story of a family and how they cope (or do not cope) when the only thing that is predictable is that one key person( that affects their lives) is unpredictable. You can gloss over the seriousness by calling Tara's morphing into various personalities a ""disorder,""  which would be a disservice.  The impact on almost everyone whose lives she touches, can be totally breath-taking at times, reflecting back to us what many families have and are dealing with everyday when a loved one suffers from any form of mental illness. While there are only three seasons, the ultimate definition of what ""Tara"" is about, is that it IS a love story, as their son Marshall realizes.  But it is just not a love story of Tara and Max;  it is the love story of family, friends and strangers who keep providing acceptance, forgiveness and understanding to and for the person who needs it most. While Tara cannot seem to ""pull herself together,"" she is the fertile ground that encourages others around her to be the strongest, best, and most enlightened any person could hope to be---making this a better world.",1447027200,,1201,4.75

3592003,4,B001G0MFQU,"Toni Collette has proven herself over the years to be a solid actor with an impressive range.  I have seen her play comedic, serious, and dramatic roles with the same ease and credibility.  I don't believe she's given the credit she's deserved.  I imagine that her non-traditional looks are the impetus behind that. Who knows?

ABOUT THE SHOW

Plainly put:  Tara has a dissociative personality disorder, better known as having multiple personalities.  Hearkening back to the comment about her range, you can see it here.  She starts off with three personalities:  a hip, school-age girl who competes with the daughter of the family for guys; a redneck, trailer-trash (same difference, I know) man whose primary interests are women and drinking beer, respectively; and a Stepford housewife, complete with anachronistic language and dress styles.  She plays each of these individuals perfectly; you don't see a single trace of Toni in them, and you don't see any credibility conflicts due to bleed-overs, that is, when she's the hip youngster, you really believe it, and when she's the redneck, you really believe it.  Her face aside, you wouldn't know that the same woman is playing these characters.

The rest of the family consists of her husband, a business owner of a landscaping/construction company; her daughter who is positively obnoxious and self-entitled; and her son, who seems like he's the son of the Stepford housewife personality--he's put-together, well-spoken, nerdily dressed, and domestic.  (He makes dinner and enjoys baking.)  Oh, and he's gay, but it's not so much of a focus.  Then there is Tara's sister, who can be described aptly as a walking, roving mess who has self-confidence issues and trends toward promiscuity.  (She even offers to snatch up Tara's husband from her.)

PLOT

Pretty simple:  a family dealing with a matriarch that doesn't quite fit the typical matriarchal role because of her disparate personalities, two of which are impressively disruptive and embarrassing.  The shenanigans affect the family in different ways even though it's clear that they're used to disorder.  The antics bleed over into the school lives of the children and the work life of the husband.

Dissociative issues aside, each family members deals with his or her own issues.  The self-entitled daughter is constantly trying to seek her independence through finding a job, sleeping with guys, and drinking or snorting anything she can get her hands on.  The father is remarkably played and shows both resignation and maturity in dealing with his wife's issues.  He's very laissez faire and rolls with the multitude of punches thrown at him and the family.

The son, Marshall, is played well.  He has the underpinnings of a complex character, but he never arrives there.  The directors keep it simple with him.  What should be applauded is the fact that his sexuality wasn't the thing that ruled his life.  There is an arc in which he falls for a fellow student who is bisexual possibly, but more likely confused.  Other than that, he deals with bullying and life with his unpredictable mother.  Again, well-played and simplistic.

GRIPES

When reading the show's story before watching the first episode, I found the story to be compelling, but I didn't see it as something that could be sustained on a long-term basis.  In other words, there is only so much that you can do with different personalities, even if it's three of them.  (She later develops two others.)  And this is where the show encounters problem inevitably.  By season three, they had run out of ideas, so they started haphazardly injecting new elements into the plot, hoping that something would stick.  It didn't.

For example, at the end of season two, she develops an animal personality, essentially a feral creature that has a penchant for urinating on people and inanimate objects. There's a small arc surrounding how this animal came to be, but you really don't hear much about it after a few of the first episodes in season three.  It was like they put something new out there for the sole purpose to see if people would bite.  If they did, they could then build a greater arc around the character.  If they didn't, they'd move on to something else.

And that's just what they did.  They introduced yet another character, a psychologist who is intelligent and the most self-confident of all her personalities (called ""alters"" in the show).  But it wasn't a character that stuck, so they dropped her and moved on to something else.  The show was getting embarrassing and desperate by this point.

I can't even recall anything from the final season even though I watched it, so that tell you how silly the entire production got.

OVERALL

The show was good despite the downward fall near the end, a fall that deserved to be put out its misery.  If you want great acting, a decent plot, beautiful settings, and interesting characters, you'll find it here.  Just don't plan for it to last, because it won't.",1433116800,2,4994,4.955421686746988

3592043,5,B001G0MFQU,"How I've missed this show, I'll never know! Toni Collette's performance is beyond amazing. All the cast really on top of their game. USOT is a fun, wild ride on the crazy addicted binge-watch train!

Tara, her husband Max and their kids, Kate and Marshall appear as your everyday, middle of the road family living in suburbia. They are honest with their feelings, words, and language. They have their issues as any family does. Kate is a teen who thinks and sometimes acts and talks like the teenager you sometimes cringe to see or hear, but also has moments of beautiful soulfulness.  Younger brother Marshall is the quiet, small, incredibly intelligent and wise old man, who is stumbling his way through adolescence. Finding his sexual orientation and place in society is such an interesting, even uncomfortable journey to join him on.
Max, Tara's gorgeous husband seems to be the rock and glue that keeps the family on a somewhat normal path. He loves his kids, and adores his wife. He rolls with the craziness that is his existence.
Then, there's Tara herself.
Tara is a gifted artist who wants to be all and do all for the family she adores. Thing is, in order to be all and do all, a little stress must fall. In order to deal with an unresolved childhood trauma, Tara has developed the only coping mechanism she can handle - Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Syndrome)
Yep, she calls on any one of them when the going gets rough, and they are ALL incredibly unique, weird, and lots of fun to watch. ""T"" is the 15 or 16 year old who is a saucy little minx, ""Allyce"" the 50's era vacuum in heels housewife, and ""Buck"" the kick ass biker dude.

What Toni gives as Tara (+ + +) is nothing short of mind-blowing. USOT is absolutely addicting! You care about all the characters (not just all of Tara's), and you want to (nay, HAVE to) know what happens next with this completely dysfunctional, wonderful family.

Almost through Season 2, and cannot wait to dive into Season 3.",1430352000,,1995,4.643059490084986

Eventually, it becomes clear why her husband endures their relationship. For the daughter and son, this is the mother they have always known. However, they are at ages where conflict would arise even under more normal circumstances.",1419552000,,520,4.8977272727272725

3592263,4,B001G0MFQU,"I have been a fan of Toni Collette since seeing her in About A Boy (the movie). The I saw In Her Sister's Shoes. That became an instant favorite for me. She's an amazing actress and if I see her name attached to something, I'm automatically interested. Factor in with this TV show the super intriguing mental illness her character is dealing with? I'm all in. The pilot was enough to make me want to see the next episode and now I'm about 4 deep. It funny, there's some drama. But I love the family dynamic and how they already know what the deal is. Each member has a different way of handling, what has to be, this crazy way of life. The dad is kinda zen about it. The teenage daughter, I feel sorry for the most. Being a teen and dealing with the family drama ( her mom's alters) seems to be taking it's toll on her the most. I will continue to watch when I can. I'm interested to see how the story gets stretched out for a couple more seasons.  But overall, I'd suggest this one to friends, for sure.",1419120000,,1004,4.175257731958763

The shortcomings (in my opinion only) are that not all mental health patients should disregard medications that may make them less stressful on the caretakers. I understand the husband agreeing to the absence of medication but I am not sure I like the idea of the children (who were not asked their opinion before birth) having to find coping mechanisms for dealing with a parent who is so obviously ill; I speak from personal experience on the subject.  If the character wanted children than the price of using moderating medication until they are adults (and able to understand the consequences fully if the choice is offered at that time) should have been paid. It is very complex situation and hardly fair to try to cover it in a one hour tv show but at least it brings the conversation forward and, as I said I applaud the effort.

Toni Collette, whom I've seen in other movies, is definitely in her element portraying four characters seamlessly, from Tara, her ""original"" mother/wife character, to Alice, the homemaker/baker out of the '50's with the southern charm, to ""T"" an obnoxious and care-free individual, to Buck, the foul-mouthed redneck.  The interaction between these characters and her husband, portrayed by John Corbett, is very entertaining.  Collette is totally convincing in her portrayal of each individual character and does an excellent job.  The dialogue between each character and the son and daughter is very amusing as well. The son is portrayed as a nerdy student who has some emotional issues with his mother's behavior and the daughter is portrayed as your typical rebellious teenage student who talks back and has a lack of respect for her parents.

It was interesting to see Toni Collete switch from character to character and how the family interacted seemlessly with each personality.  The first few episodes were really all laughs as it introduced each personality, but things became darker as the seasons progressed and the true family impact of this sort of disorder was depicted. Unfortunately by the time we got to the 6th season, things were mostly depressing. I don't want to ruin the story progression for anyone but during this season, one of the personalities was the least believable and Collete's portrayal for the first time felt strained.

3592563,5,B001G0MFQU,"I am not a person who watches TV... Except for United States of Tara and Breaking Bad.  TARA is time I consider well spent.  It is more than just a thing to watch or something to zone out on.  It is a show that can bring a new understanding about people and families.  A way to see things in a different light.  If you are a fan of Toni Collette then you probably already watch UST.  I am so happy that she is finally getting the attention an actress with her talents should be getting.  I have been a fan of hers since the movie Muriels Wedding came out years ago. Since then I have watched many of her movies and wondered why this amazing woman was not yet a household name.  I think Tara has changed that and I am glad it is this particular show that has made it so.  I find myself laughing out loud as well as in tears in many different episodes.  All the acting is top notch and the writing is so real.  I know some will be offended by the ""vocabulary"" used by those terrible teens! Ha It is exactly one of the reasons I love this show. For a program with such original subject matter, it would be an easy mistake to turn it into melodrama or worse, some kind of crazy comedy - but what I watch feels REAL to me.  A real family struggling with real problems. Even teenagers who use fowl language as most teens do.  They are good kids and they love their messed up family as most do.  I love this show and it can be a great way to learn tolerance and if nothing else you can access amazing performances with each episode by the whole cast...

3592588,4,B001G0MFQU,Excellent Cast! Interesting story line ... Toni Collette does a fantastic job being each personality.... John (Corbett) is excellent as her husband. The other actors do well also.... sometimes hard to believe the kids are only in high school. Looking forward to seeing what happens in the next season.,1393891200,,301,5.163265306122449
3592589,3,B001G0MFQU,"Leaves alot to the imagination, lots of butterflys to reinforce programming. Major MK. Good storyline for season 1. Wished producers would have expanded this storyline and let it grow. Obviously too much is at stake. Watch at your own risk if you dare!!!",1393804800,,254,4.930232558139535
3592590,5,B001G0MFQU,Not too many actresses could pull this off- but Toni does it with ease.  I look forward to watching more.,1393718400,,105,4.25

3592592,5,B001G0MFQU,This show is quirky but somehow makes multiple personalities seem normal. This is a dysfunctional family at best but they love eachother and accept eachother flaws and all. I can't wait to watch more!,1393027200,,200,4.911764705882353

3592594,5,B001G0MFQU,"A comedy about multiple personalities is hard to imagine, but Toni Colette manages to slip from one to another so believably! Each personality is unique and totally different from the others and the acting is incredible.  I cannot imagine being one of her children, but the actors do an excellent job.  And her husband (John Cotbett) is so understanding , supportive, and adorable! I will be watching Season 2!",1392681600,,410,4.927536231884058

3592624,5,B001G0MFQU,"If you have any history of dissociation or the like, this show is hillarios. I found myself hearing and seeing scenes that had played / been said to me or by me, so many times in my life. Totally connected with Tara on that level. Some of it is tough to watch as you get the full effect of her behavior and what it does not only to her but also her family. The reasoning for her illness was a little too cookie cutter for me, as you could well figure that one out after a few episodes if you have knowledge of the illness. Gotta say though, it was hilarious in a lot of ways and I enjoyed it be/c I try to not take my illness too seriously and therefor it wasn't offensive how the characters were portraied.",1390867200,,707,4.057142857142857

3592660,5,B001G0MFQU,"1. The acting in this series is EXCELLENT by everyone!  Especially the actress playing Tara!  That being said,
2. I could not have imagined a better example of how a family of secular progressive liberal loons would coexist with each other and amongst us.  This series is a shining HONEST expo-say of the intellect behind the steering wheel of the coexist bumper sticker in front of you on the highway.
3. Buck, one of the personalities of the immoral insane unstable mother of two, Tara, is toting and cleaning a gun and no one has concerns that this crazy woman HAS AND IS HANDLING A GUN.  You can only then conclude that only people who are themselves out touch with reality, would have this distinct inability to recognize A REAL danger of allowing a crazy woman access and possession of guns! This is indicative of the liberal lunacy that results in the school and theater  mass shootings consistently being perpetrated by the children and sufferers of liberalism and socialism.  AND this program BOLDLY and vividly comprises of the probable elements that conclude in the violent outbursts of the loons herein depicted.
4.  The rest of the family members moreover enable this crazy woman in every way possible with their supposed to be vulnerable sympathetic  struggle to support, understand, empathize, tolerate and coexist with an insane mother who deserves nothing less than a padded room and max dosage of Thorazine.
5. As this series evolves, each family member becomes themselves,  a victim of the mental order of liberalism being drug further down the rabbit hole of secular progressive lunacy as they each explore their own self destructive path of compulsively lying to themselves and each-other  as the explore their alternate life styles, irresponsibilities, unaccountability of consequience, and the un-ending tolerance to accept any behavior or injury or infidelity (unless it is over money which is supposed to justify aggravated assault on a plumber)!  In this secular progressive view anything and everything is Ok!

Liberals will find this series enlightening, therapeutic,  entertaining and comfortably familiar.  For the rest if us, finally some one has captured and exposed a contemporary concentrated honest view of the devalues of humanity that make up the secular progressive liberal psychology.  Thanks showtime!",1388275200,,2341,5.205333333333333
3592661,4,B001G0MFQU,Not bad. Gets a little boring some times though. It's funny some times too. Could be a little better in my opinion,1388102400,,114,4.2272727272727275
3592662,5,B001G0MFQU,This was a great show.  Sad to see that Showtime cancelled the 4th season.  It takes inside the lives of a family whom deal with real world problems.  The writers and actors did a great job portraying the characters and the mental illness of Tara.  I would recommend this to all my family and friends (of age). I would also recommend it to those whom are studying psychology.,1388102400,,375,4.470588235294118
3592663,5,B001G0MFQU,I love the Amazon Prime and being able to watch these at my leisure. Sucks the series was not renewed. One of the funniest shows & a great cast!!!,1387756800,,146,4.068965517241379

3592686,3,B001G0MFQU,"the first couple of episodes only made me uncomfortable. The acting is good, the subject matter is ""uneasy"". I have ehard that it improves in later episodes, I'll give it another chance and a new review if I change my mind.",1386460800,,223,4.463414634146342
3592687,4,B001G0MFQU,"This show is so interesting in its depiction of a ""really"" dysfunctional family. Toni Collette is truly wonderful in how she ""morphs"" into her different personalities.",1386374400,,167,5.461538461538462
3592688,5,B001G0MFQU,"This is a very funny series. The show is not appropriate for children, because of some suggestive sex sceens. The characters are funny and the story is unique.",1385424000,,159,4.714285714285714
3592689,5,B001G0MFQU,My girlfriend and I love this show.  I wish there were more seasons.  I saw it when it first came out and told her she had to watch it.  bought Amazon prime just so she could see it.  Awesome series,1384732800,,198,3.875

3592691,5,B001G0MFQU,This show is funny. I love all the characters. It touches on a topic that many don't want to talk about and some don't even believe exists. It shows the struggles that Tara has to go through along with how her multiple personality disorder affects her family.,1384473600,,259,4.531914893617022
3592692,4,B001G0MFQU,good show we have watched almost all of season one and really liked it wish it would have had a third season,1384387200,,108,3.9545454545454546

3592694,5,B001G0MFQU,The acting is very good.  The story is very amusing while still touching on modern family situations. I watch it while riding public trans to work and am totally engrossed.,1383696000,,172,4.733333333333333
3592735,5,B001G0MFQU,We all feel like Tara at times. We do so many different things in the course if a normal day that we almost need multiple personalities.,1383696000,,136,4.269230769230769

3592737,5,B001G0MFQU,"Its tough to connect to characters in beginning because it is such an unusual theme.  But once you get passed that judgement, then it is a really good series.  My favorite was Season 3.",1383091200,,185,4.411764705882353

3592740,4,B001G0MFQU,"I enjoyed this show, though the main character's DID had little to do with it. The real characters (as opposed to the alters) were well formed and the story revolving around a family member's mental illness provided great legs for the story. As for the ""alters"", and I say this as someone who knows nothing about DID, I kept waiting for the actress to stop and say ""scene."" It reminded me of something out of a bad acting class. In my humble opinion, it would have been more powerful if they had stuck to the axiom that ""less is more"" and strove for greater subtlety between the alters. Again, I don't know if that would have been consistent with the experiences of a DID patient, but it would have been better dramatically.",1381449600,,724,4.492424242424242

3592743,5,B001G0MFQU,Toni Collete really shows her acting abilities in this show... The plot gives you a view of a family dealing with multiple personalities and trying to blend into normal society,1380844800,,176,4.9
3592744,5,B001G0MFQU,I started this series by watching the final season first and I ordered the first season. It was interesting but seem short for a whole season so it left me wanting more. Im looking forward to getting the second season.,1380758400,,218,4.475

3592777,2,B001G0MFQU,"I have watched all seasons of this show, I do have DID and I am a writer. Here is something to consider'; if the sensationalism of Tara's DID were removed what would we have? Not much. The conflicts in the show move too rapidly. Tara's alters do not want anything...they have no objective that satisfies their existence. They simply appear at awkward times. There are no stakes in this show. Obstacles are raised and demolished far too quickly, making the characters (the outside ones) flat. The show uses 'colorful and quirky' characters to keep the show interesting, rather than make real characters with real responses. The character of Marshall is gay and that is about it. Isn't there something more to this characted than GAY? The show depends on 'edgy' sexual humor to keep the audience but it is little more than a set up and punch line. Tara's alters appear, run amok then disapper in what becomes boring predictability. The show depends on the sensationalism of Tara's alters rather than writing that uses conflict. What do the characters want (nothing) and what are they striving to acheive (nothing) and there are few scenes that drive the story. This show desperately needs a crash course in Writing. Oh, and yes I was diagnosed five years ago. I do see some events that are somewhat real, but, not too many. Tara's use of many pyschoytopic drugs is foolish. DID treatment does not use drugs. It is 'talk therapy' not drug therapy. I would suggest that viewers start a fund for the writers to take a class with Robert Mc Kee or at least, buy them a personal copy. If we take the alters out, there just isn't anyting left over. Perhaps the poor writing is why the show was cancelled, not jus that 'the viewers were not there,' as stated by Diablo Cody. And, that statement,which is circular reasoning, may be a hint as to why the show had not staying power. Tara could have been a real person, but instead, she was a caricature. For the viewers thinking this show was some kind of liberation for people who suffer with MPD, and the suffering is deep, it fell far short of the mark.",1377820800,3,2093,4.613941018766756

3592782,5,B001G0MFQU,What a great concept beautifully executed. Speilberg's involvement makes sense--it's a very polished show. Why it was cancelled and didn't win a ton of awards is beyond me. Maybe it is too smart for neilson.,1376352000,,207,4.942857142857143
3592783,5,B001G0MFQU,A great show that isn't boring because one never knows what will happen next.  And a guide said six more words are required. Toni C. does a great acting part with her many varied characters that she plays.,1376179200,,205,4.394736842105263

3592798,5,B001G0MFQU,"Recommended by a neighbor, and was instantly hooked. The y way the main actress (Toni Collette) handles all the characters is great display of her acting ability. The rest of the cast is great too. I highly recommend!",1375142400,,217,4.7368421052631575
3592799,5,B001G0MFQU,"I've never had the Showtime channel so I couldn't see this when it originally aired. It's a really awesome show. Everyone's reviews rave about Toni Collette's acting and this review is no different. She impresses me so much that I've gone back and watched quite a few movies she's been in to be sure to get my Toni Collette fix, most recently Muriel's Wedding now on Amazon Instant.

This show is quirky, not for youngsters or pre-teens for sure due to language and sexual scenarios. I can't wait to see what happens next and am a bit sad that I'm now streaming the final season knowing this amazingly strange ride will be over soon.

If you're a fan of high quality off beat shows this is right up your alley. As they say in the intro song ""love the ride."" This is tv at it's best with a fantastic cast, it's comedy, drama, wit and quirk all rolled up into Tara and her team of personalities. Enjoy.",1375056000,,900,4.383233532934132

3592967,4,B001G0MFQU,"Had it not been for the first two episodes of this series that appeared as extras on ""Dexter: Season Three"", it probably would have gone unnoticed by me.

However, with the cancellation of ""Ugly Betty"" and ""Desperate Housewives"" getting long in the tooth, I was looking for something new and innovative to replace my old staples.

While ""United States of Tara"" does not appeal to me as much as the aforementioned shows, credit must be given for the outlandishly original premise: Thirty-something housewife and mother Tara Gregson tries to navigate her way through life while dealing with the multiple personalities that take over her body to help her deal with a traumatic teenage experience.

Like most other Showtime series, profanity and sexual situations run rampant here, and the comedy comes out of everyday life, and sometimes from unexpected situations.

I have no complaints about the casting or performances. Everyone involved does a great job. I was thrilled to see the sadly underused Valerie Mahaffey appear as Tara's therapist.

Keir Gilchrist as mature-beyond-his-years teenage son Marshall is probably my favorite character to watch. It's interesting and novel to see how the family just accepts Marshall's gayness for what it is. The show does not go out of its way to make a big deal of the issue.

In contrast, I sometimes cringe when I see how insolent and disrespectful the writers have made daughter Kate. Jaded and possessing a huge sense of entitlement, the character does accurately reflect the current teen generation, but I don't like seeing bad examples being reinforced on TV like this.

John Corbett as the blue-collar everyman just trying to hold this family together, is probably the most underappreciated piece of the pie. You can tell that his Max is really a good guy at heart who is doing the best he can in a trying situation.

One of the series' hilarious laugh-out-loud moments comes mid-way this season when Rosemarie Dewitt as Tara's sister Charmaine reveals a medical mishap to the guests at her birthday party.

Finally, Toni Collette does quadruple duty as the title character and her three alter egos: Foul-mouthed, boy-crazy teenage hellcat ""T""; prim, proper and controlling 1950s housewife ""Alice""; and male alter, the Jack-Daniels-swilling, porn-loving Vietnam Vet ""Buck"".

It's interesting to see which persona will inhabit Tara's body in any given situation and Collette must relish a role that offers her so many different opportunities per episode, though I imagine the process must be exhausting.

Half-way through the season, a fourth alter--primal and animalistic--begins to appear. This entity known as ""Gimme"" wreaks havoc at a health spa and the results are both tragic and hysterical.

While ""United States of Tara"" is not my favorite show, the premise, acting and writing will have me back for Season Two. Fans of ""Weeds"", ""Nurse Jackie"", etc. should definitely check this out.",1284249600,3,2938,5.162105263157895

I wasn't prepared for such drama, such amazing talent and story telling.

In just 30MIN, I was able to experience the heartbreaking politics of being gay, and TEEN; I dealt with the social demands of a girl with one or too many crazy boyfriends; I endured patiently with a father, stretched to his limits...

And I cried with Tara. Needing to know who she is. And what caused her to be this way.

Crazy is never the operative word here. Ever. It's family.

With TARA, be ready to be BUCKed, ALICEd, T'd, and, well... we shan't speak it's name. You'll be fine.",1271203200,3,746,4.416058394160584

This is a concept I have never seen portrayed in a way such as this, in such a raw and realistic way. I cannot say enough how interesting and intriguing the writers make this and the acting and way it is put together on screen is close to perfect.

3592985,5,B001G0MFQU,"I have always been aware of the stylish actings of actress Toni Colette for some time, and I am a fan of her work in the movie ""Muriel's Wedding"" and her part in the ""Sixth Sense"".. but watching her play ""Tara"" is a whole other treat. Not forgetting to mention the great cast and not least important, the clever writing.. it makes for such an excellent show to watch.

""Tara"" and her -alter's- (alternate personalities as they refer to them,) are really something to watch. The way that Toni Colette executes each character, sometimes seamlessly within the same scene, is totally something special. Her supporting cast, including her husbands character played by John Corbett who you might know from shows like ""NORTHERN EXPOSURE"" and ""Sex In The City"".. is a great accompanying part of the story. He plays an extremely supportive husband and the father of two equally eccentric children, all while they happily attempt to co-exist with Tara and her different personalities. These two children as well, are spectacular in their roles, and add a great layer to the storyline and overall feel of the show.

The idea was put together and written by Diablo Cody, the author and creator of the movie ""Juno"". She is a quick-witted and smart writer that adds the funny where it is necessary, without making it a completely ridiculous experience, unless that's what it all calls for. She did a good thing with the creation of this show, in part due to the production team at DREAMWORKS STUDIOS and the Executive Producer Steven Spielberg. If you get a chance, get it, check it out and love it. It's good stuff.",1269475200,2,1602,4.7797833935018055

The acting is superb and the direction and production keep the viewer coming back episode after episode.  This series is unique in that MPD or Dissociative identity disorder (DID) has never been approached before on television besides the old movie Sybil.  United States of Tara gives a much more realistic view of how a typical family might deal with this.

It's dark, it's funny and I found myself watching episode after episode in almost one sitting.  Collette's portrayals are convincing and really debut her acting prowess.  For something different and oddly funny, try out this series.  With Steven Spielberg at the helm, the series really comes together.",1268265600,3,1085,6.139072847682119

It was like NOT being able to put down a good book.  Tony C. is perfect for this role.  I found the entire cast to be perfectly cast...love the hubby.  I watched the whole season in 1 night.  My only complaint, which isn't really a complaint, is that each episode was too short.  When I purchased the set, I thought it would be like catching up on a show like ""Desperate Housewives.""  Each one of those is about 45 minutes without commercials.  Each one of these episode is on 25 minutes.  I don't have cable, so I suppose each of the regular episode on Showtime is about a 30 min. show.  It's too bad that Showtime doesn't make this a 1-hour long show---it would definitely hold the viewers attention for that length of time.  Of course the storyline would progress more rapidly--and I thought the progression of the storyline in season one was just perfect...DEFINITELY left me waiting with anticipation for Season two.  I find watching an entire season at once MUCH easier on the schedule without having to plan around a tv show.

3592992,5,B001G0MFQU,"Some people say its very realistic to Dissociative Identity Disorder, the single person who gave it a bad review is enraged because they say it isn't. I really don't give a crap if it is realistic. The DID is a metaphor, folks! They say so themselves in one of the first episodes when Tiffany says something along the lines of ""what modern woman isn't torn into twenty different personalities? We are expected to be so many different things depending on who we are interacting with"" then of course, they punish her insight in the very next episode by writing ""Die Yuppie C----"" across her newly commissioned mural. HA! This show is outrageous, and it is for adults. They swear, talk about sex, drugs, etc. Only once did I ever ponder if it were comparable to the experiances of actual people with DID, and it was the regarding the trauma that caused the split, but I won't go into it so as not to risk spoilers. I'll just say that the discrepancies were rectified by the end of Season One.

Everyone knows Diablo Cody is working on this show, but I would also like to point out that Jill Soloway, who used to write for Six Feet Under, is also one of the writers/ producers and I think she has a much more amazing storytelling voice and style. So if you liked the adult humor of SFU and the outrageousness of DirtySexyMoney - you will definitely like this one. Again, not meant to be realistic.

Two notable things that I really like about this show:

1) They are taking the gay teenage son character in directions I've never seen before, at least not on a ""nongay"" genre show. There is no long coming out story arch for him. While that is a very important narrative in every homosexual's life - it's also been done a million times! Nope. This kid is GAY. His parents know it. His sister knows it. His classmates pretty much know it. There is no struggle for acceptance. His gayness is pretty much a nonissue, just one little piece in his entire identity. His ""freak"" status among his classmates have much more to do with a high intelligence and scrawny build than his sexuality. I don't know if THAT is realistic for a teenage boy in the American MidWest, but I sure would like to live in that world.

2) I can't really think of another TV show where there is a mother-daughter relationship where I can relate to both the mother and the daughter in the same scene. It has been a really long time since I have been able to relate to a teenage character. Maybe this means that she is not realistic either, but a lot of her story transports me right back to those days. And of course I am a mother so I also see it through those eyes, as my own daughter will be there soon, God help me.",1262131200,2,2683,4.381526104417671
3592993,5,B001G0MFQU,"I really enjoyed the 1 episode I saw. Don't get Showtime so I didn't even know about this show. I was impressed, enjoyed it and will probably buy the season. Would recommend any series watcher at least check it out. I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more publicity but may have too much sex and adult language for some. Definitely a show for adults!",1261958400,,346,4.507936507936508
3592994,5,B001G0MFQU,"I have had customers asking for this set since June so I was more than happy to finally get it in this week. I cranked through the episodes in a few days and loved everything Toni Collette has made on screen here. Her performance was amazing and in the end, carries the set.

The set is spanned over two discs with the both the PC and DVD supplements placed on disc 2, including:

* Sitting Down with Diablo Cody, 2:30 minutes. An ambush style interview that had some candid and funny moments but was way too short.
* Tara's Alters, 4 clips totaling 7 minutes. Each alter is briefly described by Collette or Corbett with Buck and Alice getting the longer cuts. T and Gimme only get a brief minute.
* Tudors episode 301. That set is already available so I guess they are trying hard to push this series.
* Sweepstakes entry, 3 minutes. A ad promo clip for travel to Collette's ""home town"" of Sydney. Have to admit I enjoyed seeing the luxury options available to one traveling in an Airbus 380.
* Photo gallery. Some decent pics of on-set stuff, lasts a couple minutes.
* Bios. Textual bios of the main cast and minds behind the show.

PC extras: The disc loads a menu which forwards you to a website for the remaining extras.

* Contrary to what the artwork and ads tell you the first two episodes of Season 3 Californication are here - not Season 2.
* Podcast Interview with Collette, 2 minutes. Covers some more of her take on the series and characters. The other three interviews promised are not available.
* On the set - not available.
* Tudors Season 3, first two episodes.
* ""More"" - could not find anything different.

Overall, I think one would be buying this for watching the series only as the extras are short. The sound is selectable between 2.0 and 5.1 for the episodes, region coded 1, 2 discs in thin cases with episode descriptions in each. Solid acting and writing recommendation.

3593018,5,B001G0MFQU,"Toni Colette is such a powerhouse and chameleon-like actress that a show like ""The United States of Tara"" is the only way a television show could possibly make the use of her talents. Because she's playing a character with DID, the show allows her to portray four distinct characters, all of which she does with sensitivity, skill, humor, and passion.

Aside from Colette's performance, the other thing that makes the show worth while is that, unlike with Showtime's other half-hour dramedy, ""Nurse Jackie"", in ""The United States of Tara"" most of the supporting characters are just as interesting. Tara's teenage children, Kate and Marshall, are especially great characters. So many films and TV shows get teenagers wrong ... either portraying them as miniature adults or cookie cutter stereotypes. But Kate and Marshall are both unique and multi-faceted young people whose reactions to living with a mentally ill parent are believable, funny, and touching. John Corbett, who plays Tara's good guy husband Max, is usually mellow and affable onscreen. But as the season went on, the cracks, frustrations, and flaws that started to show through in the character made him more interesting. Rosemarie Dewitt, another interesting actress, plays Tara's sister, who is equally co-dependent and resentful towards Tara's illness.

All in all, ""The United States of Tara"" is one of my favorite new shows to come along in a long time, and I'm hoping it sticks around and continues to grow for a while.",1260144000,2,1490,5.127572016460905

Very funny but sometimes sad, I was not dissapointed with it until the season finale which I thought was kinda weak, well besides that each episode is only 30 minutes long, I thought they could at least of did hour long episodes, (same thing with WEEDS). This is a great new show for Showtime to add to their already awesome line up of original shows and am kinda disappointed that the next season won't be ready till 2010 ( Unless that was a error of some kind, I hope).

Brilliant acting from all of the actors especially, of course, Toni Collette's genius performance.  I must take exception to one of the reviews in regard to Tara's sister, Charmaine, and Rosemarie DeWitt who portrays her.  I think that Charmaine is as screwed up as Tara, but in another way.  Parental sexual misconduct, perchance?

When I watched the season finale, I was so upset to learn that Season 2 will be in 2010!  Another year to wait to see what happens!  I hope I live that long!

There are some people (the minority) that will be offended by the show, quoting it as unresearched or unrealistic. But what is pretty clear (and what they may like to remember) is that the writers have created a dark comedic undertone in which the actors portray very well.
Well done to the producers and all involved for taking quite a few risks and pushing boundaries, I'm sick of ""safe"" TV.

3593025,5,B001G0MFQU,"Tara Gregson (Toni Collette) is just your average wife and mother. However, she also happens to have three other personalities who are anything but normal. There's Alice, a 50's housewife; T, a 15-year-old wild child; and Buck, a foul-mouthed biker dude. Obviously, this makes for quite an interesting household, as Tara's husband, Max (John Corbett), and two children, Kate (Brie Larson) and Marshall (Keir Gilchrist), try to exist in the same household as Tara's many alters.

In Season 1, Tara decides to go off her medication in an attempt to understand what caused her personality disorder to begin with and to hopefully overcome it. As a result, her various personalities make appearances whenever they feel like it, creating tension within Tara's family and with her sister, Charmaine (Rosemarie DeWitt). This mode of coping isn't easy for Tara, and it has some very dangerous consequences that leave her future in question.

I enjoy this show very much. I've never been a big Toni Collette fan, but she is amazing in this series...I especially love her portrayal of Buck, the Vietnam vet/dirty old man. The show also boasts a very strong supporting cast. Larson and Gilchrist deserve shout-outs for their performances as Tara's two children, who suffer through their own teenage trials and tribulations all while dealing with their mother's mental health issues.

The only part of the show that really rubs me the wrong way is Charmaine. I'm not fond of her character or the actress who plays her. I hope things improve with her in Season 2, or that she doesn't get as much screen time.

I approached this television show with trepidation because DID has so often been distorted and sensationalized by previous films and television programs. To my very pleasant surprise,the United States of Tara has presented a remarkably accurate portrayal of an admittedly uncommon presentation of DID (i.e., highly visible and public displays of switching from alter to alter). In contrast, the alter personalities of most persons with DID are quite hidden; the alters intentionally avoid public exposure. That said, the creaters and writers of the United States of Tara sought extensive consultation from experts on DID and have done an excellent job of presenting the symptoms, psychological issues, family interactions, and the difficulties in the therapy of persons with DID. Similarly, the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation, which has provided professional commentary on each episode of the program [...], has consistently found the United States of Tara to be surprisingly accurate (within the limits of a darkly comedic show whose purpose is, of course, to entertain).",1236556800,120,1212,5.4866310160427805
