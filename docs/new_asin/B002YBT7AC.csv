8460854,5,B002YBT7AC,"We have had the pleasure through the years to watch and hear the beautiful
music from Leroy's guitars. It's strange how one can become fixated with
the music from such a beautiful person as Leroy, but we did.

Saturday evening is still our time to enjoy country as it used to be, and to hear and see such talent for our entertainment. We have both albums of Leroy, and when Leroy played with the Eresy band. That is most likely the best money we have ever spent,

We were shocked when we heard of Leroy's passing, but we know there are still a lot of people watching and hearing his music in ""The Great Beyond""

Our thanks to those that made his music possible on the CD's.
