8212221,5,B000001LD0,"I have been a Strawb Fan since the early 70`s istill love their music when I got Geatest Hits Live I was expecting  the Strawbs may not sound as good as in the old days but this live video quickly made me realise they are  just as good now as they were before ,I felt the only weak points were the  keyboard player and the bass player but everyone else was great. Dave  Cousins sounds great as always,Brian Willoughby does a great job on lead  guitar ,Richard Hudson was great as usual on drums and Tony Hooper was fine  I just felt the bass player was weak when they did Down By The Sea and he  left out that great little bass fill and there was just silence. The  Keyboard player just wasn`t the caliber the Strawbs had always used but he  was ok .I really liked the video though ,it was really great seeing this  fantastic band live again even if it was just on tape.",961804800,3,870,4.155688622754491
