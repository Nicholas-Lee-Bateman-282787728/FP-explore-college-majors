8084724,5,B000BBH1LY,"I reviewed this DVD today and say it is extremely helpful expecially for a Beginner.  I enjoyed all aspects of the DVD and the ending of Out takes was funny !!  Enough on this to keep you busy for a while. I would definately recommend it especially to a beginner. If you are an experienced Hooper you may already know what is on here. I also loved the performances, music and drumming.",1339200000,,385,4.333333333333333
8084725,1,B000BBH1LY,"I was really looking forward to this DVD.  I had bought a weighted hoop at Target which came with its own hooping DVD by Gaiam.  I thought this one would be so much better since Diana Lopez teaches at the Ojai spa in California.  I was expecting a whole hooping routine that I could work out to.  It claims I will get fit, yet it only had a step by step instructional lesson.  It does not then take what you have learned and create a workout routine from it.  Instead, there is a long drawn out video of her and her fellow hoopers hooping in different locations including with fire.  It was such a waste of money.  Go and buy the Hoopnotica dvd instead!",1178928000,18,653,4.209677419354839
8084726,2,B000BBH1LY,"Let me start out by saying that I haven't had a chance to practice hooping with the video. This review is based on me sitting down and watching it before I use it. I notice right away that whoever edited this workout seemed to like playing with the fastfoward button. Several times when the instructor is going over a move the picture is sped up. In one section, the part where they show you how to walk with the hoop, the picture is being fast fowarded and rewinded but at high speeds. This makes it difficult for you to study the movements of the hoopers to try and catch what they are doing.

The reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because as I've pointed out earlier I haven't had a chance to practice with the hoop. But what I've seen so far this was not made for a beginner to learn how to hoop.

After reviewing the dvd again, and practicing some of the movements with the dvd I have come to the conclusion that it does help if you can at least do some hula hooping because this will make learning the tricks easier. However it isn't as necessary as I once thought. So I would categorize this dvd as being geared for beginners to intermidate. Luckily with this dvd it isn't necessary to practice everyday with it just long enough to get the hang of the tricks after that put the dvd away and come up with your own routines",1169164800,10,1326,4.237154150197629
8084727,1,B000BBH1LY,"I was so excited to purchase this hoop DVD until I received it and viewed it. WOW, I waisted my money. I do not recommend this DVD; save your hard earned money. The warm ups were longer than the lessons. The lessons are short, lack of technique and uninspiring. I was so sad. Just save your money. There isn't any dancing, no tricks, bad background music.",1162425600,8,355,4.393939393939394
8084728,4,B000BBH1LY,"Aspiring hoopers everywhere can rejoice! Diana Lopez, of BodyHoops.com, has released the first comprehensive instuctional hoopdance DVD. In Hoop Dance Fusion, Diana and a cast of hoopers demonstrate warm-up exercises, hoop basics, knee hooping, shimmying, transitions, hand hooping, and the hoop orbit. There are lots of fun hoop videos that demonstrate how to create your own creative hoop dance with the foundational movements of hoop dance.

I appreciate the balance on the DVD between the instructional hoopdance techniques and ample footage of hoopers getting creative and dancing. In the free-style hoop footage, the cast is hooping in a park, by a pool, fire-hooping on the beach, and Diana performs a tribal-style hoop performance. I loved seeing both men and women hooping in this video, and hoopers of varying ages all smiling and grooving.

At a few moments, while watching the instructional hoop class, I thought that new hoopers might get discouraged with seeing the graceful agility of Diana performing techniques when they try the techniques for the first time alone in their homes. Diana performs with ease, moves that I remember struggling with for weeks. Sometimes it takes lots of practice and persistence to master a move. Then I watched my absolute favorite part of the DVD: the outtakes. I know that novice hoopers will have faith when they see that even experienced hoopers drop the hoop in the bloopers.

In the very special outtakes, you get to watch Diana and the hoopers fumble their hoops, throw their hoops, and bonk themselves. Sometimes everyone drops their hoop to the group simultaneously. Diana adjusts her clothes, and even accidentally hits the cameraman with the hoop during a close-up. It's fantastic! It completely humanizes hooping.

In learning to hoop everyone drops the hoop, and by editing a video of hooping, those human elements can easily be glossed over. I really appreciate that Diana choose to add those human elements, because having a sense of humor and learning through the process are essential elements of hooping. I recommend this DVD to anyone interested in hooping for fitness, creative dance, or to just have fun.
