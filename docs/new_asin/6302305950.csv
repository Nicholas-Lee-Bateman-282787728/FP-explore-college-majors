451904,5,6302305950,"No pair of comedic actors can top the pair of Grant and Dunne.  Witty, somewhat dry in its humor, with sparkling performances by not only the two leads but a young Ralph Bellamy, this was one of the best of the romantic comedies of the 30s, 40s and 50s, a genre that has died out to be replaced by vapid and predictable chock flicks.  The breakup of theri marriage, due to Grant's unreasoning jealousy, the awkward rebound (both choose disastrously) and the wry realization that they can only be happy with each other is filled with humor and absurdity.  Wonderful.",1464912000,4,565,4.63
451905,5,6302305950,"... awfully good... and funny.  Witty dialogue and great character reactions (watch the faces).  There's more to say, but why?  Just watch it.

As an aside, I do disagree with a line in the movie, that marriage is based on faith.  I would say it's based on trust.  Faith sounds like religion to me.  Faith implies no evidence.  Trust is different and can be based on evidence.  I'm guessing that bit of dialogue (which I think was said more than once in the movie) is a result of the director's religious beliefs.  Still, a great movie and I didn't remove any points from my rating for it.",1463184000,,589,4.420560747663552

Oh, sure, it's got goofy 30's humor, especially from Ralph Bellamy, whom I know mainly as Dr. Saprestein (sp?) from Rosemary's Baby!

451992,5,6302305950,"Have you ever been to a play at the end of which you left mesmerized by the acting of at least one of the performers?  I have.  I recall, for example, in 1969 or 1970 going to McCarter Theater in Princeton to see The Merchant of Venice on a senior class trip.  The actor that played the villain was so convincing in his dastardliness that we gave him several standing boos when he came out from behind the curtain at the end of the play.  Of course, he was gratified by our reception.  He did a great job and deserved every last bit of hatred we could muster.  This, oddly, brings me to The Awful Truth.  Irene Dunne is perfect and captivating in her roll.  If it had been a play, she'd have received a number of standing ovations.  Ms. Dunne's timing,  delivery of lines and nuanced facial expressions never missed the target.  I'm a fan of both Irene Dunne and Cary Grant.  If you are a devotee of the late 1930s screwball comedy era, don't miss this one.  It may be the best of the genre.

For those of you who enjoyed the Thin Man movies with William Powell and Myrna Loy, you will recall the great screen chemistry between them.  They were fun movies in which the husband and wife made a great team and engaged in much subtle humor in their interactions.  The Awful Truth is the opposite, as it concerns a husband and wife who are in the process of getting divorced.  Yet, it's a comedy with much understated funny dialogue and a warm ending that will make you smile.  I note that Asta the dog from the Thin Man movies also stars here.  Smart, spunky and funny dog.  He deserved a golden dog biscuit award (or maybe an extra serving of Alpo or Gravy Train) for his work in these movies.  Very highly recommended.",1436659200,,1717,4.3197492163009406
451993,5,6302305950,A true gem. Cary Grant at his best. Irene Dunne is perfection.  The dog steals the show. A lovely litte vintage movie... And that's The Awful Truth.,1436572800,,148,4.481481481481482

451997,5,6302305950,"Movies are not just movies. They can influence peoples personal lives in many ways often inspiring those in one way or another. Irene left Hollywood early as compared to those who kept acting until they passed away. She simply wanted to enjoy a full life in in comfort with her loving husband who was often asked for advice by Irene.  Before she left she stated that she really put Cary Grant on the most top of being the most joyful person he made her feel of all her movies she did. Grant very much liked her calling her the most sweetest smelling female he had ever worked with in his life. They had chemistry together on screen, knew it & both enjoying it as not being work for them. They were tops as a Hollywood couple & their movies show this magic they had together.  Irene never won an Oscar being nominated 5 times such as Barbara Stanwyck had happen to her, even though she received a Honorary  Oscar for all her yrs on the stage,screen & tv. Irene left on top to live the rest of her years with her Dentist husband in privacy. I have her best of many movies she done so very well. This is just one of a dozen I have of her comedy, drama, romance & even a musical.  She was a great, great actress & more then enough movies to show the world for it. She done 43 feature films which in today's standards would be a low count. How ever quite a many would be forever be some of  Hollywood's best classics.  Her characters in her films would be like night & day being so Oscarlly. She was so professional in every genre of films & left us with treasures of the 30s & 40s golden age classics you can't find today. I'm so glad she lived a long happy life after Hollywood passing away peacefully at 92 yrs old. She was a Grand Dame of a Lady, an IDOL  & I wished I could of met her to give her a thanks for movies such as this one. I personally think Cary Grant & Irene Dunne were the best Comic duo of Hollywood & there were others of such worthiness. Irene was truly sincere, honest, faithful & a beautiful actress that became one of Hollywood's best role models for aspiring actresses. God blessed her & we have proof.",1430438400,6,2124,4.203931203931204

In a couple of scenes we get to see some of his skill as an acrobat from his earlier years as a performer in Bob Penders troupe of knockabout comedians. I really enjoyed this old comic piece and find many of the scenes to be real belly laughs! The one thing I didn't like, was that it NEVER clears up what the husband was doing when he was believed to be in Florida but wasn't.

She is so completely natural and relaxed on screen handling rapid dialogue, sight gags and improvisations, it is breathtaking to watch. Cary Grant works wonderfully well with this leading lady; they are obviously both having a ball. What the title has to do with anything in the story is a mystery to me, but who cares. The plot is also completely conventional, but who cares. It's just enormously entertaining to watch and hear these consummate artists: you come away from the film brimming with delight. The transfer on this release, as others have noted, is not particularly good (the vision anyway), and yet I could not advise anyone against buying the DVD if they haven't seen the film before.

Irene Dunne often played dramatic roles, but she is a gifted, natural comedienne.  Cary Grant, of course, is in his element here.  Ralph Bellamy is quite funny, too.  He is usually cast as the straight man, but he displays a fantastic gift for physical comedy in the dancing scene.  You'll also notice the movie stars Skippy as 'Mr. Smith' - the wire fox terrier who played 'Asta' in the Thin Man movies and 'George' in ""Bringing Up Baby"".  ""The Awful Truth"" is just a great movie - cute plot, well-acted, and filled with terrific stars (both the two and four-legged variety).

Ralph Bellamy plays the same character he seems to always play, the script feels like it was ordered up by the studio, the situations are contrived and all in all it's just a stereotypical romantic comedy undeserving of Cary Grant's presence.  I think people are enamored of Grant and Irene Dunn and the whole golden age of Hollywood thing.

Now I can watch it any time I want on Amazon through my Roku, which I've done about five times since I downloaded it!

The film starts out with Cary Grant's New York upper crust character, Jerry, trying to cover his tracks after faking a two-week trip to Florida. We are to surmise he's been up to no good and cheating, yet it's clear from his conversations that he loves his wife. When he arrives home, she's been out with her music teacher and he assumes the worst. An argument quickly deteriorates into a decision to divorce, and off they go to date other unsuitable options.

It has also made me appreciate the talents of Ronald Colman. It is a movie filled with lively conversation and political debate as well as having one of the best love triangles ever made in a film.  A love triangle where I would have been happy no matter which man Miss Nora Shelley chose.  It is also a movie that is just as relevant today as it was in 1942.  The humor is dry and witty. The drama is also pitch perfect as it works seamlessly with the comedy. The plot holds your interest as you wait to see if good triumphs over evil; if someone will put their life-long ambition and whole future on the line to stand up for what they believe in, or will they wait on the sidelines afraid of the dirt that may be thrown their way if they get involved.  The chemistry between the 3 main characters is devine and the secondary characters fill in the rest of the picture.  I bought this on Amazon Instant Videos and the streaming quality was excellent.

452472,3,6302305950,"Although it was fun to see Irene Dunne and Cary Grant together, this was far from the romantic comedy I expected. Dunne and Grant are a wealthy couple who seem to have it all, though through a misunderstanding, they both imagine the other guilty of infidelity. Rather than talking it out, they decide to go their separate ways and divorce. The biting comedy and snide comments between the two are supposed to suggest they really love each other but there is never a tender moment between the two.

Their divorce will be final in 90 days so it is time to make the other jealous and they both begin dating. Dunne ends up with a wealthy oilman played by Ralph Bellamy. This is a fast-paced drama. The dialogue and comments are quick and snappy. The message gets hidden as the two try to outdo each other. Don't immediately assume the worst in a situation. In this case THE AWFUL TRUTH might not really be so bad. There is an innocence in this film and the writers need to skirt the issues of infidelity and extra-marital affairs.

Cary Grant really gets to put some physical comedy into his role. This immensely handsome actor doesn't mind taking his own falls and being clumsy at times. There is a fun scene where he is putting is about to leave and puts on the bowler hat he bought an hour ago. Somehow his head has shrunk in that hour and the hat is too big. Could it be that another bowler-hat wearing man is in the bedroom. There is a beauty in the innocent innuendos.

I wish the characters had shown more warmth and love towards each other. Maybe if they can't show respect to each other, they weren't meant to be together.",1332720000,,1627,4.434782608695652

I fault the direction, which is quite flaccid and does not enjoy the sharp editing and movement of the best screwball comedies. Second major flaw: The total superficiality and unbelievability of their opening argument and divorce. Talk about forcing the plot! I know these are all essentially ""silly comedies,"" but the best films are grounded in real characters. To hear and see Irene Dunn and Cary Grant get ""angry"" with each other enough to go through a divorce was pretty lame. Doesn't work. Totally artificial device meant to get to the real point of the movie: How to get them back together again. Ho hum. There WERE some solid bits here and there -- Dunn's comic acting as Grant's sister; some of the sharp retorts, the ""Southern Belle"" and her whoopee routine.

452513,4,6302305950,"Both Jerry Warriner (Cary Grant) and his wife Lucy (Irene Dunn) are convinced that their spouse is cheating on them. And with very good reason. Looks like their marriage is on the rocks and the couple files for divorce. The decree will become official in 90 short days.  In the meantime both Jerry and Lucy get engaged to other people.  Jerry gets hooked up with heiress Barbara Vance (Molly Lamont) while Lucy manages to get mixed up with a mama's boy oil man from Oklahoma named Dan Leeson (Ralph Bellamy).  Yet despite these goings on something is gnawing at both Jerry and Lucy.  Seems that the prospect of a divorce has made each of them realize that they just can't live without the other after all.  But neither will come out and admit it.  Instead they go about trying to sabotage each others relationship with positively hilarious results.  For me the highlight of this film is when Lucy crashes a party at the home of Jerry's new fiancee posing as his sister.  The interaction between Grant and Dunne in this scene is positively priceless.

Many consider ""The Awful Truth"" to be the best of the so-called ""screwball"" comedies that Cary Grant appeared in. Personally, I prefer both ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" and ""My Favorite Wife"" to this one but ""The Awful Truth"" is a highly enjoyable flick as well.  Leo McCarey won the Academy Award for Best Director in 1937 for this film. Definitely worth seeing!  Highly recommended!",1307664000,4,1429,4.721774193548387

A classic of screwball comedy.",1285804800,,316,4.283333333333333
452515,5,6302305950,"Leo McCarey was famous for creating and working with comedy teams, and he made use of considerable improvisation during both rehearsal and the shoot.  Neither Irene Dunne nor Cary Grant were comfortable with his methods, and Grant was so convinced THE AWFUL TRUTH  would be a fiasco that he tried to buy out his contract for the film.  Fortunately for everyone, McCarey preservered--and the movie is easily one of the great comedy classics of the 1930s.

Based on a 1922 play by Arthur Richman, THE AWFUL TRUTH presents us with Jerry (Grant) and Lucy (Dunne) Warriner, a couple who genuinely love each other but who have significant trust issues--and not without some reason.  Jerry has feigned a trip to Florida in order to conceal an indiscretion; Lucy may or may not have an entanglement with her voice teacher.  Feathers fly and they end up in divorce court doing battle over custody of their dog.  While waiting for the divorce to become final each becomes involved with others.  Jerry sees nightclub entertainer Dixie Belle Lee (Joyce Compton, memorably ridiculous) and icy socialite Barbara Vance (Molly Lamont); Lucy continues her somewhat dubious relationship with voice teacher Armand Duvalle (Alexander D'Arcy, as memorable as Joyce Compton) and Oklahoma oil man Dan Leeson (Ralph Bellamy.)  Before too long Jerry is set to marry Barbara and Lucy is engaged to Dan, but there is one fundamental problem with the whole thing: they still love each other and they know it.  Just how far will they go to get back into each other's arms?  Plenty and then some.

This is one of the several films that made screwball comedies critically famous and audience favorites, and Grant and Dunne would become famous for the style.  Critics and fans debate which film should be considered ""the best of the genre,"" and you often hear such titles as IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT, BRINGING UP BABY, THEODORA GOES WILD, and THE MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK mentioned as contenders.  But whenever such discussions arise, THE AWFUL TRUTH is always a hot contender, always placing among the best.  It is a wildly funny romp that balances out wild story lines, witty dialogue (the Grant-Dunne ""things can be the same"" scene toward the end of the film is drop-your-drawers funny), and a series of sparkling performances that include one memorable turn after another.  The DVD transfer isn't great, but neither is it as bad as you might expect, and in any case the film is so delectible that it is a must-have.  Recommended to anyone in need of a really, really good comedy.

Cary Grant portrays a jealous husband who doesn't believe his wife's story that she and her voice teacher had car trouble and had to spend the night in a hotel.  So, consequently, they decide to file for divorce.  Well, during the waiting period Cary Grant is quite jealous but in a very sophisticated way.  He knows how to say flattering things to his soon-to-be ex-wife's new boyfriend that at the same time contain a barb.  The whole movie is an absolute treat and one of the best out there.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone!",1277769600,4,693,4.532258064516129
452518,5,6302305950,"This is the first of three great movies Cary Grant did with Irene Dunne. Cary had the opportunity to work with some of the most beautiful and talented women of Hollywood. He once said that he had most fun doing films with Irene Dunne. If you want know why he said that; then you may want to watch this movie, because this is precisely what you get, lots of fun watching the easy-going couple go at each other in a humorous sort of way. This is a different kind of ""fun with Dick and Jane.""

Leo McCarey won the Academy award in the best director category, and Irene got a nod from the Academy in best actress category during the nominating process, which goes show the power of this great classic. McCarey went on to make other classics such as: Once upon a Honeymoon (starring Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers), Bell's of St Mary's (Starring; Bing Crosby and Ingrid Bergman), and An Affair to Remember (Starring; Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr). The story is simply put; man meets woman, man loses woman, and finally man finds the woman again. Jerry Warriner (Cary Grant) and Lucy Warriner (Irene Dunne) are married couple and they split, they start going out with others, soon to be ex husband and wife sabotage each other's love affairs, and finally they reconcile. The fun is in the way they play game at each other and cause numerous fun-filled situations; some outright embarrassing for the other spouse; after all the fight between couples doesn't have to be a courtroom drama or a shouting match full of hostilities

The actual fun starts when they both become suspicious of the other having an affair. Then they agree to separate, and the courtroom drama is really about the custody of their little dog called Mr. Smith. Lucy wins the custody but Jerry gets the visitation rights, and they will have 60 days for the finalization of the divorce. This gives plenty of time to do a great deal of damage to each others romantic encounters with other people. There are many funny and sometimes embarrassing moments involving Jerry and Lucy: When Jerry is angry with Lucy's voice teacher Armand Duvalle (Alexander D'Arcy), because of his alleged affair with Lucy. The second one is the nightclub scene when Lucy' new beau, oil-magnate Dan Leeson (Ralph Bellamy) dance (jitterbug) funny with Lucy, and Jerry faces embarrassment when he tries to romance the nightclub dancer named Dixie Belle Lee (Joyce Compton). The scene I enjoyed most is when Jerry romances snooty socialite Barbara Vance (Molly Lamont), Lucy following his romance in the social columns, shows up at the home of Vance's parents as Jerry's drunken kid sister, and then tries to disengage his engagement in front of shocked Vance and her parents. After all the gimmicks and comedy, they find that they are made for each other, finally reconcile and get back together. This is a wonderful comedy and all fans of Cary Grant and Irene Dunne must see, and it is highly recommended.

452519,5,6302305950,"If you want to just sit back, relax and soak in some highly entertaining comedy then look no further than `The Awful Truth'.  This is one of those films that makes up for lack of complexity with superb performances and precise wit, making this one of the most gratifying comedies of all time, let alone the 30's.  In fact, I'd be tempted to say that this is the greatest comedy of all time; but then again there is no way anyone can ever make such a bold statement without it being laced with pure opinion.

So, in my personal opinion, this is the greatest comedy of all time.

As I mentioned, this film is far from complex.  In fact, the story itself is one we've seen many, many times.  Husband and wife are in discord, both of them complaining and accusing the other of things they are both guilty of to a certain extent.  Instead of talking things through they erupt in argument and decide that divorce is the only answer.  In the days proceeding, before the divorce is final, both parties meet potential significant others only to realize that they are only truly happy with one another.  Instead of casting aside differences and looking to reconcile, they allow their pride to convince them the only suitable option is to try and destroy their mate's prospective relationships.

Hilarity, and I mean H-I-L-A-R-I-T-Y, ensues.

Many talk and talk about Cary Grant's charm and charisma, and I too have mentioned this when reviewing `An Affair to Remember' and even `North by Northwest' (not a typical `charming' film but an undoubtedly `charming' performance), but I must say that Grant, while serviceable here, is totally overshadowed by the brilliance that is Irene Dunne.  There is something so classic about Dunne's performance.  She captures the grace of a true star while still managing to make her performance almost slapstick in a way.  There isn't a wary step taken; everything is in the right place at the right time, yet it never comes across as mechanical or forced.  It is a natural and breezy performance that is laced with a strength that can only be seen in an actress of Dunne's stature.  Sure, Cary Grant is his charming self, but Dunne is the films star performer.

The supporting cast is also delightful.  Ralph Bellamy is the typical `good guy', serving as Dunne's over zealous suitor, and Molly Lamont is capable in her few scenes as Grant's wealthy girlfriend.  The real supporting giants are Alexander D'Arcy (hysterical) as well as Cecil Cunningham (priceless) and Esther Dale, who plays Bellamy's cautious mother.  There is not a sore spot amongst the bunch.

With a delicious script that makes the most of each and every scene, as well as spot on performances and an articulately played hand by the director, `The Awful Truth' is awfully good.  Even if it isn't you `favorite' comedy, it is sure to be one of them.  I cannot see how anyone couldn't just absolutely love this movie.",1251417600,2,2911,4.754980079681275
452520,5,6302305950,"Jerry and Lucy Warriner (Cary Grant & Irene Dunne) play a high society married couple in this screwball comedy. Despite being very happy, they both begin to think that the other has been unfaithful which leads to Jerry storming out of their home.  She files for a divorce and is granted custody of their dog, Mr. Smith (who was what brought them together to begin with).  After she leaves the courtroom Jerry is granted twice weekly visitation with the dog.  Despite having to wait ninety days for the divorce to become final they begin romantic relationships with someone else, even though they still love each other.

All the charcters in this movie are wonderful.  Ralph Bellamy is Daniel Leeson, the millionaire oil man/rancher from Oklahoma who lives in the apartment across the hall that Lucy has rented from her Aunt Polly.  Naturally, he falls in love with the beautiful, sophisticated Lucy and they are quickly engaged.  His possessive, catty mother (Esther Dale) has no intention of letting him marry a woman like Lucy.  She appears to be shocked and heart-broken when she tells Daniel that people are saying Jerry let Lucy divorce him so her reputation would not be ruined.  Of course, she doesn't believe them and if she wasn't a lady she would have really let them have it.  Instead, it is left up to Grant to defend Lucy's honor to her and her son.

Not to be outdone Jerry is soon engaged to socialite heiress, Barbara Vance (Molly Lamont). {Ironically, Cary would soon meet socialite heiress Barbara Hutton in 1938; they married on July 8, 1942).  On the day of their divorce Lucy answers the phone in Jerry's apartment, when he gets to the phone he lies to the suspicious Barbara and tells her that she is sister Lola (he has no sister).  Barbara wants him to bring her with him when he comes to the house that evening to meet her and the family but says she can't because she's flying back to Paris that afternoon.  Of course Lucy shows up and everyone is shocked by Jerry's tawdry, heavy-drinking sister Lola.  She dances a dance that she knows snooty rich people will frown upon; and leads the Vance family to believe that Jerry's father was a gardener at Princeton, not a student.  The disgraced Jerry leaves with Lucy in her car, since she's in condition to drive.  (Why would someone that was supposedly leaving for Paris have their own car?)

In a movie filled with great scenes and characters the best belongs to Joyce Compton as the first woman we see Jerry date.  She portrays the ""air-head"" southern-accented, chanteuse, Dixie Lee Bell, who surprises and shocks Jerry, Lucy, and Daniel (Jerry has not seen her show) when she performs by singing an unconventional burlesque type song during their first date.  This is by far the most hilarious scene in a movie filled with them",1246147200,,2804,4.718685831622176

You might be attempted to stop watching after 15 minutes. Don't, it gets better. Not Cary Grants best but worth the price in this 3 CD set. About the reviews about the bad transfer. Forget. It is a 1937 film after all. True, it could have been restored to look better. For a typical Cary Grant film of the 30's, who would expect the studios to spend that kind of money when this is a very good print for the time. Now why would a CD not look as good as a VHS tape? Different source stock. The VHS tape could have been sourced from a 16mm print that is in better shape then the master, but when viewed from a CD to a 40"" 1080p you would tend to see a grainy and not as sharp a picture.

452542,5,6302305950,"The Awful Truth is an outstanding comedy with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne. When they say that this picture made Cary Grant a superstar, they mean it--he really shows his talent in this movie! The plot moves along at a very good pace; I wasn't ever bored and I laughed quite a bit at the one-liners and the gags. The cinematography is good and the choreography is very professional. The casting was well done and the acting is very convincing. I found my copy of this print to be quite satisfactory; I feel badly that some other people were disappointed with the quality of the print.

When the action starts, we quickly meet Lucy and Jerry Warriner (Irene Dunne and Cary Grant) who, despite being married and in love with each other, are also incredibly suspicious of each other when they each slip away without being able to provide a reason that satisfies the other. Before you know it, they wind up in divorce court. They even fight over custody of their dog, Mr. Smith! It turns out that Lucy gets custody of the dog; but Jerry gets visitation rights.

If that's not enough for you (and it all happens in the first sixteen minutes), things really heat up when each of them try to find happiness with a new partner. Lucy's Aunt Patsy (Cecil Cunningham) introduces her to a rich but not too cultured country farmer Dan Leeson (Ralph Bellamy); and it isn't long before Jerry takes up with fabulously wealthy--and snooty--Barbara Vance (Molly Lamont). Lucy also continues her singing lessons with Armand Duvalle (Alexander D'Arcy); Jerry is very jealous and suspicious of Armand's intentions as well.

It seems that Lucy and Jerry are willing to go to extremes to destroy each other's chances for love with their new partners. Both of them show up at the most ridiculous times in order to make their new partners suspicious and disdainful of them. Jerry has his laughs watching Lucy dance with Dan to an old country song at a swanky nightclub in New York City; and he comes to Lucy's apartment when Armand is hiding there, too. Lucy, for her part, dresses up as Jerry's sister (although he has no sister) and then Lucy crashes a posh soire at Barbara Vance's home, doing and saying everything she can to disgrace Jerry. She dances a dance that she knows snooty rich people will frown upon; and leads the Vance family to believe that Jerry's father was a gardener at Princeton and not a student. This horrifies the Vances!

Of course, the plot can go anywhere from here. Will they fight even more over Mr. Smith? Will Lucy and Jerry find romance with their new partners--or maybe other people after all? Just how bad does it get when Lucy impersonates a sister Jerry doesn't even have? Watch and find out!

The DVD doesn't come with too much in the way of extras; but the film is so screamingly funny I can almost completely overlook this.

Overall, The Awful Truth is one of the best screwball comedies to ever come out of Hollywood. I highly recommend this film.",1244246400,,2962,4.632380952380952
452543,5,6302305950,"The Awful Truth is a delightful screwball comedy from 1937 starring Irene Dunne and Cary Grant in their first and best of 3 films they made together. The plot line is pretty simple: husband and wife start to doubt and divorce. However when they both start new romances they each play anti-Cupids and do everything in their power to sabotage their former spouse's new romance.

What made this simple story work so well was the amazing chemistry & perfect comedic timing of the two leads, the wonderful direction of Leo McCary, and an adorable dog named Mr. Smith (who also played Asta in the Thin Man series and George in Bringing up Baby). The end product is a truly terrific film which is just as enjoyable today as it was 70+ years ago.

Some people have been complaining about the DVD quality. While it is not perfect I don't think it is as terrible as some people are making out.

452544,4,6302305950,"The Awful Truth is anything but awful.

In 1937 Cary Grant was already a Hollywood Giant. a dynamic actor and a genuine Star. But in the `Awful Truth,' Irene Dunn took him to school. Yes, Mr. Grant was as charismatic as usual, delivering his lines marvelously, perfect in comedic timing, and demonstrating great physical humor. Throughout most of the movie, Grant and Dunne sparred on relatively equal terms, each earning a fair share of the proliferus laughter generated by their antics. However, at the last hearty chuckle, it was clear that Dunne had been toying with Grant throughout. No, this is not a spoiler and has nothing to do with the storyline, but rather an evaluation of their performances. Despite the magnificence of his, her's was better.

Irene Dunne was simply phenomenal, deserving her nomination for `Best Actress.' She was funny, charming, exuberant, conniving, manipulative, and intriguing. The movie was slow to find it's footing and much time was wasted as Grant and Dunn, in the slower portions, are not on camera together and thus unable to `duel.' But as the plot unfolds the momentum builds to a final crescendo and the mutual magic of these fine comedic artists delivers cascade upon cascade of laughter.

The director Leo McCarey, earning his Best Director Oscar, toyed with both the relatively new `Hayes Code' and the censors, implying with sensitivity and subtlety, a physical aspect of love and infatuation that was unnecessarily suppressed in movies for decades. The witty `doublespeak' dialog at the end was fascinating as each of these protagonists explained the situation in self-contradictory fashions and yet their meanings were unmistakable. Yes, there is a predictable plot but the witty words and scrappy schemes are pleasant surprises.",1231545600,,1780,5.195121951219512

There are some genuinely funny moments, notably the performance of Dixie Lee, the nightclub singer and the dog, Mr. Smith is terrific...but mostly I found it much less sparkly and snappy than most of this genre.

Grant is always wonderful...a true Movie Star of his time....incredibly handsome, very funny, warm and always interesting.  His facial expressions when Dixie Lee performs are almost worth watching the whole film.  I don't much get Irene Dunn, but I guess she was popular at the time.  All of the supporting cast are predictable but entertaining.  If these folks had had a better script the film would have been really good, and perhaps, for the time, it was great.

For now, it's good for film students, diehard fans of Grant and Dunn and folks who long for the days of night clubbing in Manhattan.  Screwball comedies are known for their witty dialogue and this didn't have that.  I didn't see that much chemistry between the two leads, either and that's another essential ingredient.  Mostly the plot is predictable from the opening scene and it plods on way too long.

452591,4,6302305950,"Cary Grant, an up-and-coming actor in the mid-1930's, fortuitously teamed with the more established Irene Dunne for the first of three fruitful pairings in this archetypal 1937 screwball comedy directed with finesse by Leo McCarey. The result is one of the era's breeziest concoctions, an uninhibited farce based on suspected marital infidelity that has the stars bickering and bantering with precision and lan. It's easy to see how Grant became a full-fledged star with this film as his persona already seems fully formed from his droll one-liners to his acrobatic pratfalls. He dexterously balances the urbane and everyman aspects of his personality as Park Avenue social dandy Jerry Warriner.

Adapted by screenwriter Via Delmar from a 1921 Arthur Richman play, the featherweight plot begins with Jerry and his equally gadabout wife Lucy living carefree amid their luxuriant surroundings and wealthy social circle, but the couple experiences a misunderstanding over each other's whereabouts. Both are so smug and proud that neither apologizes for the trouble each causes the other. In fact, they rashly decide to divorce, and a custody battle ensues over their pet terrier, Mr. Smith, the same dog who played Asta in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thin-Man/dp/B0009GX1C4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thin Man</a>&nbsp;series and later the bone-stealing George in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bringing-Up-Baby/dp/B0006Z2KX4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bringing Up Baby</a>. With their jealousy peaked, Lucy and Jerry try to sabotage each other's next serious relationship - Jerry with priggish, suspicious heiress Barbara Vance and Lucy with wealthy Oklahoma oilman Dan Leeson. Things inevitably spiral out of control as the final divorce decree approaches.

Perhaps the most criminally overlooked of the top actresses during Hollywood's golden era, Dunne not only matches Grant's comedic skills here but shows off her impressive singing talent. Along with her insinuating laugh, she has a sophisticated but down-to-earth manner that makes her the classic screwball heroine. Look for the hilarious scene where she pretends to be Jerry's tawdry, heavy-drinking sister Lola. A specialist in playing the third point in romantic triangles, Ralph Bellamy is likeably lunk-headed as Dan, and there are sharp comic turns by Cecil Cunningham as no-nonsense Aunt Patsy and Joyce Compton as nightclub chanteuse Dixie Belle Lee.

452598,5,6302305950,"The truth isn't painful at all but quite hilarious in this Leo McCarey film starring Cary Grant and Irene Dunne. Vina Delmar's screenplay adaptation of Arthur Richman's play is a sophisticated look at what happens when two people who love each other decide in the heat of the moment to file for divorce.

It all begins when Jerry (Cary Grant) returns from a bogus business trip to Florida to find his house empty. His wife Lucy (Irene Dunne) arrives late, her singing coach, Armand (Alexander D'arcy), in tow. One thing leads to another and before you know it they are in Chancery Court trying to hash out who gets custody of their dog, Mr. Smith. Once Lucy wins the battle for Mr. Smith, Jerry only allowed visitation rights, the real fun begins.

What follows is a smart and very funny film as Jerry and Lucy trade gentle barbs about their prospective suitors. Jerry gets first crack as Lucy, at her aunt's urging, hooks up with Daniel (Ralph Bellamy), a rich good old boy from Oklahoma. Later it is Lucy's turn when Jerry begins seeing a high society girl named Barbara Vance (Molly Lamont).

Between the sophisticated jabs are some truly hilarious moments. Grant poking Dunne from behind the door with a pencil while Bellamy asks for her hand in marriage is a riot! Another funny moment comes while Lucy is singing at a recital and Jerry shows up and sits down. Perhaps the biggest laugh, however, comes from a fight scene between Jerry and Armand shown totally off camera. It is the most hilarious scene in the film, McCarey letting us imagine what must be going on.

My favorite scene is where Grant, in conversation with D'Arcy, tells him how ""wonderful"" he thinks Oklahoma City is (D'Arcy is from there and plans on bringing Dunne back home with him).

The film covers the games they play as they seek other partners to make each other jealous. The humour encompasses witty one-liners, put downs, pratfalls, slapstick, the lot. This is a frivolous masterpiece and justly famous.

Cary Grant is famous for his impeccable comedy timing so his performance in this film will not be a surprise even though it was his first really major success. The director, Leo McCarey, made the film in a spontaneous manner which at first unnerved Grant but once he relaxed, the effect was liberating so this became the first film which really unleashed his persona. In 1937, Irene Dunne was a bigger star than Grant although far less known today. Grant said she had the best timing of any of his co-stars and you can see why here. Her gestures, gurgles, sardonic looks etc are perfection. Their interaction is the measure by which other comedy performers can be rated. The scene in which Dunne plays Grant's coarse sister and appals his fiancee's stuffy family is hilarious. Ralph Bellamy also deserves mention for his parody of the lecherous hick. Watch him in the nightclub scene.

The DVD contains no extras and the print is poor, very grainy in places. Surely this is one famous comedy which would warrant restoration and an expert commentary, if only to analyse the superb comic invention of the director and the 2 stars.

The world was mired in depression.  Americans were jobless and insecure, without the Welfare net to save them, and it was considered a disgrace to be on government relief.  Across the pond, Europe was insane and violent, the German people having lost their minds, following a madman, arming as quickly as possible to take over all Europe, and then all America, with their new long-range weapons already in construction, already persecuting their religious minority.  Japan was making its move on China.  Granted, the Far East seemed far away back then, but clearly Satan was walking the Earth, in a manner of speaking.

And what is America watching at the movies?  A charming, cultivated, cultured, unruffled fellow named Cary Grant without a financial problem in the world, upper crust to the core, seeming British in a way, so far above it all.  His biggest concern is to get a nice tan in order to fool his wife into thinking that on his separate vacation he actually went where he said he was going to go.  The implication, never confirmed, is that he was out having an affair with another woman, when he was supposed to be in Florida getting a tan.

So what we have here is an ""escape from reality"" movie for Americans to watch, a little like a baby's milk bottle.  Let's forget the misery around us, the insecurity, the terror, the awful truth, for an hour and a half.  Let's lose ourselves in its antithesis.  Let's watch a light comedy with Cary Grant.

And Cary is just the man to pull it off, to give America a short break from its tension, a nation on the verge of entering the fray, the world war that will cost the lives of millions.  We don't want to look at that awful truth.  Let's look at this one instead.

This movie is a ""light comedy"", but when you think about it, it deals with the weightiest of problems.  Infidelity within marriage, and divorce, are not light issues.  They are the issues that hit us closest to home.  They tear us apart inside.  They bring tears.  They bring physical violence.  They lead to many of our murders and suicides.  They sure bring a lot of shouting and emotion.

And this movie has the Mrs also apparently guilty of infidelity on her separate vacation.  Irene Dunn has just spent the entire night shacked up with a handsome Frenchman.  You know what that means.  Their excuse, that ""the car broke down"", is of course the oldest in the business.  She is conspicuously absent when Cary arrives home with his artificial tan from a tanning salon.  The lady she supposedly spent the entire vacation with is also waiting for her, wondering where she's been these past weeks.

Did I miss something here?  Wasn't Irene supposedly with her aunt for the entire vacation?  How would a car breakdown explain such a long absence?  It's all left vague in the movie.  We are meant to assume that both spouses are cheating.

Perhaps this is just a lighthearted swinging couple, happy in its freedom.  But no, that's not what we are given.  These two people love each other, as the ending shows.  No, I don't think I'm spoiling anything for you.  Any idiot can tell, from the get-go, what the ending is going to be.  You don't need to be Einstein to figure out that Cary and Irene are getting back together at the end.  As in ""duhhhh"".

This is a movie dealing with a tragic storyline that is played for fun.  Cary is unruffled by the whole thing.  He is losing his beloved wife.  She is cheating on him with the proverbial Frenchman.  His entire world has come crashing down.  And Irene has just experienced the same disaster, losing her beloved husband, presented with proof of his dishonesty as she is handed a Florida orange with California stamped on it.

This is in a sense a surreal movie.  Do I really believe that the car broke down?  Am I even meant to believe that Cary has been faithful?  For movie purposes, I am definitely being told to believe that the car broke down, at least.  If not, America would turn its back on this unfaithful wife and toss her to the curb, as they winked conspiratorially to Cary the cheating husband.

Cary is who the American male wanted to be in 1937.  Rich, carefree, charming, unruffled, above it all, getting all the action, and even macho, as he chases the Frenchman out of his house after pounding him, all without much emotion of course.  No fear, no emotion, no vulnerability.  In short, no reality.  Why do we have to face the awful truths in our lives.

So cavalier, so debonair, so in control.  Nice way to be.  Wouldn't you like to be that way?  In your tensest moments, wouldn't you like to refrain from yelling, refrain from succumbing to tension, and just come up with a bon mot?  The only violence in the movie is the Cary vs Frenchie fight, which is handled off screen in a closed bathroom when Frenchie is in fact shown to be completely innocent, and Americans get the comforting picture of Frenchie running away from our hero, hot in pursuit.

This movie is called a light comedy, and some of the reviewers have labeled it ""hilarious"".  It didn't make me laugh once.  It reminds me of white powder on the faces of middle aged or elderly ladies.  It is superficial and it covers up the truth.  It puts a happy face on a troubled situation.  There's really nothing funny going on here, when you think about it.

Cary Grant was a good actor, but he was typecast in the same type of role, playing the same type of character, in too many films.  John Wayne had the same situation, a good actor who was typecast in the same type of role over and over again.  Acting consists of playing a variety of roles, losing yourself in the role, becoming someone else, convincingly.  When all you are called upon to do is revisit a role you have already done many times before, in this case playing Mr Debonair, that's not acting anymore.  That's more like pottery making, churning out the same pot again.

It would be great to be able to handle a devastating experience like marital infidelity and divorce with such coolness as Cary Grant does.  I'd like to be like that too.  I'd like to be untouched by it all.  I'd like to be able to just come up with a smart line, and then go off to date a rich heiress who desires me, take her to the track, and cash in another winning ticket.",1118102400,3,6422,4.501300954032957

452646,5,6302305950,"There are a few great films that never go out of style and seem impervious to time, and this is one of them.  Unlike some pre-WW II comedies that are still a delight but nonetheless feel like they come from another era, THE AWFUL TRUTH seems almost as if it could have been made a decade ago.  Part of the reason for this was the enormous amount of improvisation that Leo McCarey managed to get out of his performers.  Many of the best moments in this film were made up on the spot.  As a result, the film retains a wonderful feel of spontaneity and naturalness that few films from the period can match.
Apart from the great direction by McCarey, much of the credit has to go to Cary Grant and Irene Dunne.  Unbelievably, this was Cary Grant's first great performance as a comedic leading man.  In fact, although Grant was a familiar face from his appearance in Mae West's SHE DONE HIM WRONG (a film he personally detested), he was not really an A-list performer.  Early in 1937 he had starred with Constance Bennett in TOPPER as a mischievous but fun loving ghost.  It was the first great indication that he possessed first rate abilities as a comic, and led to his casting in THE AWFUL TRUTH.  After this, however, he managed to go on to star in an extraordinary string of comedies, arguably the greatest group of comedic roles by any one actor in the history of film.  I have never been a big Irene Dunne fan.  I always feel uncomfortable with her oversized teeth and enormous smile.  But she absolutely shines in this film.  If she and Cary don't generate the kind of chemistry he would with Katherine Hepburn, they still manage to set up some absolutely marvelous comic scenes.
My favorite scenes in the film are those that include Ralph Bellamy, one of the great also-rans in the history of film.  In both this film and three years later in MY GIRL FRIDAY, Cary Grant makes him the butt of a string of truly funny jokes.  The best in this one comes when Cary with his girlfriend meet his ex-wife Irene in a nightclub with her new fianc Ralph, playing an Oklahoma oil millionaire.  As the two explain to Grant how they plan on moving to Oklahoma City.  Cary sticks a knife in by expressing amazement that a woman who is addicted to life in New York City expects to find contentment in Oklahoma, and then twists it by evilly consoling her with the suggestion that on weekends they can take a trip to Tulsa.
The dog who plays the Jack Russell Terrier ""Mr. Smith,"" was probably in more great movies than any dog in film history.  He not only played Asta in the first three Thin Man movies but also played a year after this film in the hysterically funny BRINGING UP BABY (as ""George,"" the dog who steals the bone and buries it somewhere), and in one of the Topper films.",1054080000,6,2772,4.423228346456693
452666,5,6302305950,"- The five stars are for the film itself not the dvd edition-
This is one of those landmark films that really lives up to its well deserved fame, when one finally has the opportunity to watch it.
Irene Dunne and Cary Grant, are perfectly matched as the ever-quarreling wife and husband, who, in spite of loving each other, for rather childish reasons, are granted a divorce, but before it's final, they have the chance to think it over one last time.
Really hilarious scenes by the two leads and by the excellent supporting cast, especially Ralph Bellamy as Dunne's suitor, Cecil Cunnigham as the wisecracking Aunt Patsy and Esther Dale as Bellamy's mother. Nice bit by Joyce Compton too, as an ""air-head"" southern-accented, singer, who gives a very peculiar singing-act.
Perfectly paced, at 91 minutes running time, there's no time left to breathe between scenes, so expertly tied to each other, that it's hard to believe it was filmed, as it was told by the actors, mostly unaware of what was going on. Apparently the only one who knew was master of comedy, director Leo McCarey, who won one an Academy Award for it.
Now about the quality of the dvd edition, I must say that I bought this movie along with the dvd editions of ""Talk of the Town"" and ""You Can't Take it with You"", completely unaware of the absolutely negative customer reviews here at Amazon. As matter of fact, having watched this movie just last night, and still having not watched the other two, I was absolutely frightened of what I'd see (and what I still have to suffer!), upon reading all those negative reviews by Amazon customers, concerning these three classic films.
Concerning ""The Awful Truth"", I must say that I feared even worse, because at least some portions of the movie are crisp and clean, but many others are very grainy, bad quality, faded, etc, so one wonders about the ""digitally mastered"" and the ""remastered in high definition"", as said on the back of the dvd case. It's one of dvd's I own, and I have almost 200, with the most ""uneven"" image quality I ever saw.
It's really a pity that Sony-Columbia Classics, didn't treat this classics, the way they had treated the first classics they released on dvd, of which I own many, so I know waht I'm talking about: ""It Happened One Night"", ""His Girl Friday"", ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"", ""Gilda"", ""Only Angels Have Wings"", ""Angels Over Broadway"", ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington""......especially considering the price of their editions....we all know, Warner releases are cheaper, and until today, their editions are of very good quality, indeed.
So boooohhh for the people who released this editions, so unrespectfully to us classic film buffs, and for charging between U$ 25- 30, for something that shouldn't cost more than 11 bucks.
Still I wonder: The laserdisc editions of these three classics, were as bad as the dvd editions? I don't believe so, 'cos most of the laserdisc editions of classics were of very high definition and quality....so, what happened with the dvd editions? How can it be that one Amazon customer says that the VHS editions of some of this films are better than the dvd ones? I remember watching a TV showing of ""You Can't Take It with You""...and its quality was excellent....maybe the laserdisc was the source? Or those excellent copies belong to some other company?.
Sony-Columbia owes an apology to its thousands of customers, and even more, they should release these three classic films, in the way they deserve, as their first aforementioned releases, and give the customers who had the bad luck of buying these bad quality dvd's, the right to exchange them for the really remastered-restored editions.
Until then, we'll have to stick to these editions, 'cos it's all we have, besides recording a better version on TV.",1049846400,142,3784,4.823076923076923

So when Dunne gets herself involved with resident screwball guy-on-the-side, Ralph Belamy, Grant does everything in his power to submarine the relationship. This is perhaps the finest, most tightly realized example of what the British call ""comedic farce"".  We, in North America have come to affectionately know this style of film making as the ""classic screwball"" and in ""The Awful Truth"" the formula works so incredibly well, I suddenly found myself starved for more great comedies like this one.
Columbia has given us a print of the film that, although riddled with scratches, tears, duped quality master print segments and fading is, nevertheless, free of all the digital anomolies that were present on their ""Talk of the Town"" DVD transfer released just a few weeks before.  Yes, this film is dated, and yes, there are portions of the picture in which fine detail is practically non-existant, and yes, Columbia should have done a much better job on this classic film than they have for this DVD release.  But it just doesn't look quite so bad as their other recent efforts from their B&W catalogue library.  And although this disc has a long way to go before it starts winning any awards, the print, if not pristine, is nevertheless represented by a generally good gray scale that does not diminish the comedic elements of the story.  LET THE BUYER BEWARE: I don't think this is a great DVD or even an adequate one.  It is, however, an outstanding movie!
*Aside: There are no extras and although the print claims to be remastered in hi-def, this is a mute point since the original camera negative is badly worn, hence the over all quality will not be improved by hi-def mastering.  Do not base your decision to buy this disc by what you read from the back of Columbia's packaging! You'll be bitterly disappointed.",1047340800,53,1968,4.781710914454277

452670,5,6302305950,"One of the best screwball comedies of `30's, right on par with Frank Capra's ""It Happened One Night"" and ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town"". In their first screen paring, Cary Grant and Irene Dunne play Jerry and Lucy Warriner, a married high class couple who seem to be getting along fine. Until one night, when the two become convinced, for various small reasons, that there are infidelities in the relationship. They both reveal their feelings about one another (""I wouldn't go on living with you if you were dipped in platinum"") and get a divorce. Lucy gets custody of the couple's beloved dog, Mr. Smith. But, Jerry is also able to get a court order allowing him to see the dog twice a week. And, although the divorce doesn't become final for 60 days, the two start forming other relationships, with each partner trying to sabotage the others romances.
Lucy has a relationship with a millionaire Oklahoma rancher named Daniel (Ralph Bellamy), while Jerry has one with singer Dixie Belle Lee (Joyce Compton). However, Jerry is able to mess up that one when he and Lucy's voice teacher get caught in the same place and battle out of Lucy's apartment. This Daniel to remark ""Well, I guess a man's best friend is his mother"" (Similar to words later said by Norman Bates in 1960's  ""Psycho""). And Jerry's romance with Lee is short lived. He soon starts to go out with high-class socialite Barbara Vance (Molly Lamont). But one day, when Lucy visits Jerry's apartment (On their last day as husband and wife), Lucy answers the telephone only to find out it is Barbara. Jerry lies to Barbara that it's his sister, which causes Barbara to invite her along with Jerry over to her residence that night. Lucy (Or Lola, the name Jerry gave her as his sister) shows up drunk and makes a fool of Jerry, who decides to leave along with Lucy in her car. But, there is a problem with the car radio that causes them to get pulled over by the cops. And the ""breaks"" give out (Actually, Lucy lets them loose), causing the car to crash. The two are given rides by the policemen to Lucy's aunt's place, where they sleep in rooms that are next to one another. But, the door separating the two rooms has a problem of not staying closed.
Now, what does one think of the things Jerry and Lucy do to one another in their relationships? It seemd to me, at first, that they were trying to put the other through hell. But, they seem to love one another more as they are doing it. For example, the scene where Jerry goes to Lucy's voice teacher's apartment. He expects to see her alone with the intructor, only to find Lucy is performing for a group. Jerry sits down and, in a funny moment, leans too far back and falls over. Lucy, in the middle of singing, makes a little laugh; she likes seeing Jerry make a fool of himself. But, she makes sure the laugh isn't noticed. This can be interpreted on that she loves how Jerry makes her laugh. The more they try to hurt one another, the more they see their mutual love for one another, which is the awful truth. Daniel puts it best to Lucy in these words:
Daniel: Are you sure you don't like that fella?
Lucy: Like him? You saw the way I treated him, didn't you?
Daniel: That's what I mean. Back on my ranch, I got a little red rooster and a little brown hen and they fight all the time too, but every once in a while they make up again and they're right friendly.
Dunne got an Oscar nomination for her hilarious, and beautiful looking, performance.. The film was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor (Ralph Bellamy), Best Screenplay and Best Film Editing, with Leo McCarey picking up the first of two Best Director Oscars (His second would be for 1944's ""Going My Way"", which I have also reviewed""). Strangely, Grant was ignored in the nominations (Though he would be nominated twice in the `40's for dramatic roles). I don't know what the Academy had against Grant. Since Grant was from England, was it patriotism for the U.S? If so, why did Charles Laughton get a Best Actor award in 1933 for ""The Private Life of King Henry VIII""? Maybe Grant wasn't a team player?
I must say this before I close the review: The dog, Mr. Smith, should have gotten an honorary award or nomination of some kind. He was very well trained, being able to cover his eyes during hide and seek and, in a clever (And often clichd) scene, forced to decide on who should be it's master. He's also a great companion for Grant when he plays the piano during his visits.

The only problem is that they clearly still love each other. As they respectively figure this out, they do their best to sabotage each others' relationships - resulting in incredibly funny scenes.
The Awful Truth has witty dialogue in the classic screwball style, hilarious situations, and great acting. Cary Grant is wonderful as the confident and charming husband - his facial expressions and muttered comments steal scene after scene.

452686,5,6302305950,"This film is so nostalgically 30's... It is light, elegant, and fun...
The story is a classical re-marriage plot. The dynamics of the young, rich, care-free, and child-free couple [Grant and Dunne] is similar to the  couple's, featured in ""Topper"" [hilarious comedy that Grant has  done right before ""The Awful Truth""].  Ralph Bellamy is the  classic ""third wheel""--rich mama's boy from Oklahoma.  ""Oh,  I can see you right now...in Oklahoma, tsk-tsk""--Grant says. This line  gets recycled in ""His Girl Friday"" [another screwball,  re-marriage comedy with Grant as the divorced husband and Bellamy as the  third wheel]. In ""His Girl Friday"", Oklahoma is replaced by  Albany, but the sarcastic meaning remains unchanged.
Despite seeming to  be quite conventional [for the 30's], ""The Awful Truth"" actually  have some very ""brave""  moments.  For example, in the opening  sequence Grant is on the tanning bed, disrobed and having a discussion  about his infidelity; later, we see a ""risky"" floor show in a  restaraunt; then, there are also those unending hints about Grant and  Dunne's mutual infidelity.
BUT WAIT... THE MOST AMAZING THING ABOUT THIS  FILM IS THE POOCH, WHICH BECOMES THE CENTER OF LEGAL DIVORCE BATTLE.  How  absurd and cute is that? My favorite moment is WHEN GRANT COMES TO DUNNE'S  DOOR TO EXERCISE HIS ""VISITATION RIGHTS""...TO SEE HIS BELOVED  POOCH. This is too funny!
In the end, however, both Grant and Dunne  throw their wackiness and unconventionality away, realizing that they still  love each other and that they still want to be together.

Ralph Bellamy is the  hopeless suitor and does an impromptu musical number accompanied by Ms.  Dunne, which proves to us why he never starred in any musicals. A wonderful  comedy achievement with hysterical moments.",924652800,,928,4.779874213836478
452693,4,6302305950,"From the heyday of the screwball comedies, this amusing and often hilarious romantic farce shows Hollywood in its best light vein. ""The Awful Truth"" provides a consistently witty script, memorable scenes  and lines, smooth comedy direction, and established Cary Grant in a genre  which he made his own, and typecast Ralph Bellamy for years (his  ""type"" was hysterically sent-up in ""His Girl Friday"").  Typical of the vintage comedies of the thirties, the laughs are neither  telegraphed nor forced; pleasantly rewarding for the audience who like  their comedy to connect with their funny bone via their brain, and not  their glands. Diverting fare of the most amusing kind!",921369600,,673,5.233644859813084

7824089,5,6302305950,"This is known as one of the best screwball comedies, and for good reason.  These flims are about couples who break up and make up through convoluted means, as the audience concludes that they belong together because no one else would have them.  Mid-1930's films do this by masking infidelities,and we are left to wonder exactly what Grant and Dunne were doing while apart as the movie begins.  This makes for a charming narrative, completely untouched by bitterness or recrimination.  The two paramours that the couple date while on the loose are perfect comedic foils.  Dunne is surprising and believable despite the back projection used for her motorcycle ride, her singing reminds us that she was a musical star on Broadway at one time, and Grant's flawless timing and expertly done physical comedy are wonderful.  The character actress who plays Dunne's aunt is a comedic wonder with dry, wry rendering of her part. I don't think I've seen her in other roles in movies of the period, which is too bad.  As a mattter of fact, the entire cast is spot on.

A few years later these two were paired in another comedy in 1940 called My Favorite Wife.  They worked together effortlessly and made the film in just a month or so.  After watching both movies back to back, you want to see them yet again.  This is witty, well-executed comedy.",1509753600,,1337,4.719827586206897

is a reason why no one remembers Irene Dunn. This movie was contrived, insulting to rednecks and fuzzy dogs and features some of the ugliest clothes ever seen. The Awful Truth is that this purported classic - isn't. There's a reason why there are only a few old cars on the road today sporting new paint jobs - and why most were melted down or abandoned on blocks, overgrown with weeds in the would-be-legendary places where old cars go to die.",1499817600,,703,4.67741935483871
