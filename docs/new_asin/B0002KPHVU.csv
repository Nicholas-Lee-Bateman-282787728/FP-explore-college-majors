2100366,4,B0002KPHVU,"The first season of Mad TV was definitely the best -- it had more variety (not just the same Rusty, Ms. Swann, old woman who clears her throat, etc. gags over and OVER again), and a clearly higher budget.  If I bought any Mad TV discs, it would be the first season, IMO it is nearly unwatchable now.  The highlights to my recollection were the very high quality fake movie trailers (ususally one each episode) where they would combine the premise of two current movies into one, e.g. one I recall combined a Van Damm move with a Woody Allen movie of the time, and what they ended up with was Allen running around a all-girls school accidently shooting terrorists as he looks clueless and spouts pseudo-sophisticated meditations on terrorists.  My words do it no justice, you have to see it.",1094947200,6,790,4.588652482269503
2100367,5,B0002KPHVU,"I started watching this show many years ago while still in college after hearing my roommate laugh like a crazy man. I suddenly started taping all episodes and boy am I happy to see it on DVD. I have been requesting it to the studio for years and I'm glad all those emails weren't wasted. I used to be a big fan of SNL but through the years I just fell it got more and more boring and I couldn't watch it anymore.

Many of my favorite actors on MadTV have left but the show hasn't lost its vibe. It's impossible not to laugh at Lorraine Swanson, Miss Swan, Will Sasso's interpretation of Steven Seagal and many more memorable characters.

I even been on the set of MadTV once and was invited on the taping of a weird discussion panel. It was an amazing experince, got to meet many of the actors and they were all nice and pleasant to be with, especially Mo Collins, she rocks! She's one of the nicest and sweet people you can find in Hollywood.

I really can't wait to have all the DVD's in my collection.",1093046400,,1005,4.223958333333333
2100368,5,B0002KPHVU,"By the late 1990's, SNL had become too overconfident in it's capabilities. Because that show assumed people would tune in regardless, the sketches became mundane.

Enter MAD TV.

Inspired by the long-running humor magazine of the same name, this show does sketch comedy better than the forerunner. The cast of fresh faces look genuinely happy to be working on the show, resulting in excellent sketches for the studio and home viewing audience.

By far and away, Nicole Sullivan delievers awesome performances in her sketches. Her characters are so hillarious you are honestly not sure how much of it was based on real people.",1091836800,3,625,5.048543689320389

This is season one as you may already know and its impossible to miss the begining of the best comedy-sketch-show there is which started back in 1995. It includes the very first glimpse of unforgetabble characters like the Vancome Lady (Nicole Sullivan), along with extra footage, bloopers, the best parodies in all 9 years of broadcasting, make that 10... and never before seen sketches. This is a DVD you must have if you love comedy. Better than SNL I dare to say.",1089849600,,525,4.595744680851064

First of all - This show steps Off-line to the nature and character of Mad Magazine. Some things are taken Way Too far - and do Not honor the foundation that Bill Gaines set of it's standards.
And 2nd - about Half of the skits fall flat - period. - But - - I still think this set is worth having - and watching again and again.

2100402,5,B0002KPHVU,"I missed the 1st season of MADtv as an 11-12 year old kid. I remember In Living Color during the early 90's. It's very fun to watch. It has a bunch of extras. And it also got subtitles and or closed captions. It's in double sided single layer DVD format. It has all 19 episodes. You get to see alot of Spy vs Spy. And this other cartoon skit, don't know the name of it. You get to see the UBS guy, The Vancome Lady, X News, and various parodies. You get to see all 8 of the original cast members, lined up in tie dye background, with instrumental background. As the years passes by, actors and actresses tend to change.

The DVD box looks brand new, Seasons 2-4 is from Shout Factory. Single dual layered golden disc.
Now I own all 4 seasons of MADtv, can't wait for seasons 5, 6, and 7.",1398038400,,787,4.1103896103896105
2100403,4,B0002KPHVU,"The first season of MADtv saw the cast members and the writers still finding their rhythm and groove. The hit-to-miss ratio of sketches wasn't as good as later seasons, and as such, a lot of the sketches fell a little flat. Don't get me wrong, there are certainly some gems in here. But, while it was a valiant effort, the first season was merely good, not great like the following few seasons where the show really hit its stride. This set is still good for fans/collectors of the show, but if you are new to the show and are just ""trying it out"", I would recommend any of the seasons 2, 3, or 4 (and 5, if its been released) sets instead, as those were the golden years of the show, with the perfect core cast.

Also, I can't believe that Fox is dragging their feet in releasing the other seasons. I bought this season 1 set in 2009 (it was released in 2004). They didn't release season 2, 3, and 4 until 2013, and season 5 has no date set yet for release. Such a shame...",1397865600,,974,4.208556149732621

2100408,5,B0002KPHVU,My only regret is the fact that the next 5 seasons are UNAVAILABLE on DVD or any purchase format They just simply haven't been released and I grew up on this show and would give ANYTHING to have seasons 2-5 in my collection...,1386288000,,226,4.27906976744186
2100409,4,B0002KPHVU,"A classic Sketch Comedy Show that tackles many taboo subjects while making you laugh.  MADTV is not for the squeamish or the easily offended.  There is no such thing as political correctness in this show and every issue that is ""made fun of"" is more to make you see just how ridiculous being offended really is.  The 1st Amendment is openly practiced in this show with little bias politically.  (All sides of every issue are made fun of... eventually).  This was one of my favorite Sketch Comedy Shows and I am really glad they are finally releasing it on DVD.",1384387200,,560,4.56

2100412,5,B0002KPHVU,"This was one of the funniest and most original show of the 90's, packed with hilarious moments, and a number of comedians who have since become very well known.  Orlando Jones and Nicole Sullivan were my favorites, but by only a little bit, as they had very good company on screen and off.  My girlfriend and her son had never seen the show before, so I got them to watch ""just one"".  Before the night was over, we'd watched four eps, and another two or three the following night.  There are some sketches that just don't quite work, but the cast is clearly having fun.

At the time Mad TV came out, SNL was showing its age, and had become distinctly unfunny for a couple of years, and I found it almost impossible to watch.  Mad TV provided an alternative to SNL, which I think strengthened both shows in the end.  The first season is more cutting edge, and reminiscent of SNL's first couple of seasons.

Some of the humor is not for kids!  There's a reason this was shown late at night, and these are some of the funniest bits of the series.  High marks for a very funny show, and a good set.",1362700800,3,1094,4.2926829268292686

2100416,5,B0002KPHVU,This was awesome. Its hilarious for the people with an extraordinary sense of humor. Me and my husband enjoyed this.,1352592000,,116,4.85
2100417,4,B0002KPHVU,"Given the limitations of broadcast in prime time, MADTV was as good a comedy as one could hope for.  With severe limitations on political, social and other topics, the skits that they pulled off were in general harmless fun if not downright hilarious.  As it was primetime and not late night like Saturday Night Live, it was not topical nor political.  Being filmed weeks or months before, it was not live like SNL so the day's or week's events were never made into the news or skits that SNL has made a living off of.  Still, the composite cast was good enough to carry off a huge variety of comedic 'blackout' sketches.  I only paid $5.40 for the entire 1st season which is a great bargain.  True, things broadcast are sold inexpensively on the theory that you could just record it, but I have not seen these shows on the air for some time.",1319068800,,842,4.435064935064935
2100418,5,B0002KPHVU,"Monty Python's Flying Circus, Saturday Night Live, SCTV, In Living Color, and of course MADtv. Being a fan of great sketch comedy, I could appreciate the first few seasons of MADtv before it went off the deep end when it went from hilarious to stupid to completely unfunny. I'm surprised that many reviewers find the later seasons funny and the first season boring. It just goes to show you the attention span has been cut in half. Maybe much of my affection for the first seaons of MADtv is I remember watching it when it first came on tv in '95. It was funny then, and it's still funny today. This original cast is perfect - unlike the cast that followed.
On a side note related to this. I can't stand how people say ""it holds up today"". Who cares? A lot of things made in a certain time period don't have to hold up with today's generation. That's the whole point - tv shows, music, films that were made in a certain time are reflective of that particular period in time. They weren't supposed to relate to today's generation of viewers. When you watch or listen to it, it is supposed to take you back to that place and time in history. If you happen to find certain things that relate to something happening today, great; if not, so what? Great music, tv and films last if you make it last and not because society says it's not cool anymore because it's old. For the most part, this generation does not have enough patience to enjoy something that takes more than a few seconds to get to. They want everything at break neck pace so they could move on to another quick piece of entertainment. Also, if I wanted something that relates to todays generation/world, then I'll watch a modern tv show, listen to modern music, go see modern films. I don't need to see something from 20 years ago that really ""holds up"" with today's generation.
It's a shame that WB didn't release the second season especially since they advertised it on the dvd of the first season. A huge case of flagrant false advertising if I ever seen one. Even if sales aren't that great, why not release a smaller, limited amount of dvds for the second season so at least the fans who DID buy season 1 can buy season 2 as well. It's better than letting the fans (who made the show a hit originally) down all together.",1310688000,,2286,4.40661938534279

2100423,2,B0002KPHVU,"If you had asked me, I would have said I was watching MadTV from the first episode and hung with it off and on for many years. There are several very funny sketches from that first season I remember fondly, especially Dixie Wentworth, Dentist in a Box, the OJ bloopers video and an Artie Lange putting his parents out to pasture skit that ranks as my favorite one ever.

Imagine my surprise when only OJ was in Season 1. And not until episode 18. Dixie appears, though not by name, in a couple of forced and mostly unfunny sketches. Bryan Callen mugs his way through a number of slight bits, though no Australian pitchman, and Artie is largely a no show (though My White Momma is as funny as I remember.) Debra Wilson, an amazing actress, and Nicole Sullivan, a gifted comedian, carried the show for that year, and with great material could have done wonderful things. But given the mostly lukewarm stuff they got, it's not bad. And David Herman is the standout on the male side....I really didn't remember just how good he was. He soon left for work with Mike Judge that has not used his talents very well--the guy was very clever and skilled.

I kept awaiting the side-splitting convulsing laughter that would make me choke. But it never came. My reaction to nearly all of this was a mild smile. And there were lots of non-smiles. The Spy vs Spy cartoons are even less funny today, if that is possible, and the guests were guys I've never heard of (not surprising, considering how weak they were.) The occasional laugh out loud moment is mixed with far too much tepid chuckling. It just didn't get going...not bad, but nothing to commemorate and watch again. Maybe Season 2 is better and those hysterical moments I thought I saw appear then. Or maybe I'm hallucinating the whole thing. Whatever; this has its moments, but far too few of them. Sketch comedy is dicey stuff. The greatest of all, Monty Python, produced whole shows that are unwatchable today. These guys have nothing to reach the heights of MP, and a few that sink to their most discouraging depths.

The extras are far too slight to add much, a couple each of various animations and parodies, and the 200th show that wasn't all that great. This set is a minor disappointment, though it is the hours invested in rewatching awaiting those never-coming riotous moments, rather than the modest cost, that disappoint most.",1216166400,4,2384,4.644549763033176

I started watching this show many years ago while still in college after hearing my roommate laugh like a crazy man. I suddenly started taping all episodes and boy am I happy to see it on DVD.

I used to be a big fan of SNL but through the years I just fell it got more and more boring and I couldn't watch it anymore.

It was an amazing experience, got to meet many of the actors and they were all nice and pleasant to be with, especially Mo Collins, she rocks!

Break out stars Orlando Jones, Nicole Sullivan and Debra Wilson at the very least are served up well here.

Not crazy about the double sided disks, but it's ok. I'd rather have that than more wasteful packaging. Haven't watched all of the episodes, but it's one of the few DVD sets that I've instantly taken out of the wrapper and put in the portable DVD player to watch as soon as I got it!

I love this show and I think it's getting more popular because of it's constant place on Comedy Central. Mad TV's original cast members like Nicole Sullivan who played the Vancome Lady is just one of many talented comedians around. Artie Lange was hysterical as the man who was possessed by an African American mother in That's My White Mama. Orlando Jones and David Herman are better known for their roles in Office Space but they still are dynamite on this show. I loved Mary Scheer who played a range of characters during her tenure on Mad TV. Debra Wilson is terrific at playing African American celebrities like Whitney Houston and Oprah Winfrey. I love Bryan Callen as the dimwitted surfer. Maybe this show is the anti-Friends. I loved the cast and still watch the show as a faithful viewer to this day. The cast is excellent and the writing is first rate. Too bad, the Emmys haven't paid as much as attention as their rival show.",1189900800,2,1021,4.6464088397790055

2100432,5,B0002KPHVU,"It's rude, it's crude, it's utterly insane and hilarious! Like others, I saw this when it first aired and laughed my hindquarters off... However, I worried that the DVD treatment would be poor or that it wouldn't stack up as well as I'd remembered it.

Mercifully, I was not disappointed at all. Even from the first episode, I was laughing myself silly, and feeling guilty about it the whole time (it's a very guilty pleasure). Some of the sketches were a bit off-color, or off-kilter (I've only gotten through a couple so far, since it just got here last week), but for the most part it was on par with the best of Saturday Night Live. It's a great pop-culture send-up. Some of the material is dated, but that happens with any semi-topical show dealing with then-current events.

Still, the picture and music is good, it's got all the original lead-ins and lead outs (going from/to commercial and back), and music, and some special features to boot.

Fan-freakin'-tastic! And the price is right (appx $9 on sale over the holidays; can't beat that for a full season release)!

Now, if they'll just start releasing the other seasons! Perhaps, in the meanwhile, I'll hop over to In Living Color for a while, and catch up on my vintage comedy...

----------

Addendum:
Forgot to mention packaging, so heere goes. It's pretty attractively packaged. However, I'll add the caveat that they used double-sided discs, which I'm NOT a fan of. An extra side to try keeping fingerprints off of, and to keep from scratching. I'd rather see subsequent releases utilize single-sided discs with print on one side and data on the other. It's generally more attractive, and less problematic, even if it costs a fe extra pennies to mass-produce.

I also noted that the clips used on the inside were the push-button-to-release type, however, sometimes pushing the button doesn't seem sufficient, and it feels like the discs get ""stuck."" A few Highlander fold-outs behaved that way too... Anyway, it's worrisome, 'cause I tend to worry about breaking discs or chipping the inner ring of the disc on the holder, which might lead to a larger crack forming... So, if they could remedy that on the next release, that would be good. Otherwise, the fold-out seemed attractive and not ungainly. Likewise the outer box was attractive, as well.",1165708800,9,2314,4.8578680203045685

I wonder if the cast has some sort of deal with Sprite, though, because you see so many current and former cast members from this show, in those commercials for Sprite.

Anyone care to comment on this?

My favorite skits are probably the Movie satires, and the one with Michael Jackson doing an infomercial is halarious!  I also like the Rap Video, with Ice Cube in prison, doing a song about acting, etc.  Just phenomenally halarious!

2100436,4,B0002KPHVU,"INTRODUCTION

I love MADtv. It is so funny. I cant wait to watch it. If you can tell i am refering to the newer seasons. Dont get me wrong, this is a great set. The only problem is that there arn't many funny skits. Most of them are wierd and annoying.

SUMMARY

Now to the positive side...In this 3 double sided disc set there are 19 hilarious episodes plus the 200th episode reunited the first seasons cast. There are a lot of funny special features too. This season has many animated shorts too, like the SPY vs. SPY and others i don't know the names.sorry. but the are pretty funny.

CONCLUSION

The first season of MADtv overall is great, but a few weak spots. It is well worth your money though. I cant wait for the other seasons to be released",1122249600,4,750,4.290780141843972
2100437,1,B0002KPHVU,"I never saw the series on tv so when it came out on dvd, I was excited, remembering the magazine from when I was a kid and being a fan of ILC, SNL, and comedy itself.  I am also known for finding various comic styles funny where others don't.  I write this review now as I am TRYING to watch the third disc.  I got the dvd the first day it came out and I have to watch every dvd I get, even if I saw it before.  Regardless to say, I only broke a smurk ONCE throughout the first 2 1/2 discs.  I even tried watching parts of the disc when I was having a great day and even when I was not in the greatest of moods.  I was in a good mood again this morning so I started watching it.  I think it is the lamest show that I have ever seen.  I really don't know why it ever lasted past the first season.  If you've seen the show on tv and you like it, more power to you, if you haven't seen it, don't buy it, it is a waste of money.  Everybody says that after season two is when it gets funny...  I personaly don't think I should have to endure a whole first season for it to get funny.",1122076800,3,1078,3.7466666666666666
2100438,5,B0002KPHVU,"I've always been a fan of Mad TV. Especially the older seasons. I don't know why but the newer ones just aren't as good, and it has mostly to do with the cast. The older cast from the first seasons were the best the show ever had. Debra Wilson is my favorite. This is a great collection of all the episodes from season one, that will keep you laughing. Lots of extras too. Can't wait for more seasons to be released as the show only got better, until it started losing a majority of its cast.",1116547200,,492,4.135416666666667
2100439,5,B0002KPHVU,"Otherwise I would be forced to spend my hard-earned cash buying them! With the other seasons unreleased I can maintain a healthier savings account. With the economy currently in the doldrums that's important! The rest of the seasons with Will Sasso, Mo Collins, Phil LaMarr, Alex Boorstein, Debra Wilson, Nicole Sullivan are currently unavailable on DVD so Fox needn't worry about any substantial decline in my bank account. I'm certain that's a big concern for them. Also the fact that I might spend inordinate amounts of time re-enjoying Spishak commercials, the Vancome Lady, Ms. Swan, Darlene McBride, Paul Timberman, Lorraine, and the parodies of Whitney Houston, Britney Spears, Prince, Michael Jackson(yes, I know he's gone), and all the rest of the gang. Thanks again, Fox!",1111536000,5,781,5.256
2100440,4,B0002KPHVU,"I love MAD TV and have so for years. I thought I had been watching it from the beginning but I didn't seem to remember anything from season 1 while watching it. I gotta admit, season 1 isn't one of there best seasons of comedy, but it blows these days SNL out of the water. There are few ""great"" sketches, but it really picks up in the next couple of seasons to come, so my ratings are only going to get higher, and higher, the louder I laugh.

The original MAD line up and all the first season shows are presented nicely on 3 double sided discs. The first 2 discs (4 sides) contain just episodes and the last disc has 4 episodes and some unaired sketches, bloopers and the season 2 promo. The flip side contains a 30 minute ""best of"" MAD TV. As usual, I don't agree it's anywhere near the ""best of"" but lets have one review without anyone saying that. And also the 200th episode that does not reunite the first season cast, it reunites a about 5 previous MAD TV'rs, Nicole Sullivan, Alex Bornstein, Will Sasso, Artie Lange says hello from non-live satellite and Orlando Jones wasn't on set, but he did shoot a clip for the intro. Clips of most of the other cast members are shown tho.

Overall I give this DVD 3 stars. It is presented great, I don't think there is anything they missed, they included some good bonus goodies, even tho the bloopers aren't funny, and only about 2 of the unaired sketches proved other wise to why they weren't aired.

But judging by the quality and presentation of this first TV, heres the welcome mat for looking forward to season 2 when the MAD team kick the comedy into overdrive.

EGGS:
  Santa On Cops promoe for season 2: On disc 3a highlight
  ""season 2 promo"" and click left. You will see a yellow
  target icon on Orlando Jones. Then press enter.

2100441,5,B0002KPHVU,"Mad TV is one of the funniest sketch comedy shows around.  It's nice to see the orginal cast members again.  Since the show probably didn't pick up steam untill the 3rd season, I wasn't expecting too much.  But this DVD exceeded my expectations.  The special featurees were ""CLASSIC!""  Although I found the best ofs extremely funny, I do think there needed to be more.  Like the sng paradoides were funny, but I wouldn't the BEST OF.  Maybe the best of the CURRENT, but what about ""Real Lady mad TV,"" or the HILARIOUS ""Keep Posin'""?  Those were thre BEST OFs.  but I understand.  If you find the Easter Eggs by clicking on either David Herman or Orlando Jones in the cast picture.  You'll find that there DEFINATELY will be a season 2 (soon I hope!)  So, they are probably just saving some for then.  The bbloopers were HILARIOUS, and the 200th episode was nice.  Then, there's the actual show!  First of all, we get to see the FIRST appareance of the favorites charecters like the UBS Guy or the Vancome Lady.  I mean, the modern day mad TV is pretty funny, but it can't compare to ""RUN DADDY RUN!""  I think I speak for everyone who's seen this DVD when I say, season 2 BETTER dang well not come out like 2 years from now.  Can we have it now????????  Because we have attention spans that can only be measured in nano-seconds.  ooo look at that...........  What?  What was I talking about?  Oh yeah, Mad TV.  Anyway, I seriously recommend this DVD to anyone who 1. is a big mad tv fan or 2. has yet to see mad tv.  If you haven't seen it, buy this before watching todays episodes.  They're better.  If you don't like mad TV, well...you've fallen helpless and are a hopeless case to something I call.....maturity.  Ugh.  Glad I never got it.  Keep up the good work mad TV!  And keep up the fart joke.  ha ha ha....FART!",1105574400,4,1819,4.385542168674699
2100442,4,B0002KPHVU,"When Mad TV premiered on Fox in 1995, it provided a great alternative to a then duller than usual Saturday Night Live.  While there are a number of skits that are as equally dull on this first season set, Mad TV made a name for itself with it's scathing and irreverant sense of humor and parodies of commercials and general pop culture.  While the first season's cast didn't feature many of the familiar and hilarious faces that fans of the show would come to love (Michael MacDonald, Alex Borstein, Mo Colins, Aries Spears, and Stephanie Weir would come in later seasons), it did feature some breakout talent like comedians Orlando Jones and Phil LaMar, Howard Stern sidekick Artie Lange, fan favorites Nicole Sullivan and Debra Wilson, and Office Space's David Herman.  Dull moments aside, the cast mostly does some great work, and the claymation and animation shorts are laugh out loud hilarious.  All in all, longtime fans of the series will want to check this out for a nostalgia trip down memory lane, and new viewers will want to give this a look as well to see where it all began.",1105142400,11,1088,4.680628272251309

2100444,5,B0002KPHVU,"When MADtv first came out in mid 1995, many speculated whether it would be even close competition to SNL...well it was. With crazy, wild humor and an awesome cast, MADtv was a groundbreaking show that pushed the limits on the rude, and crudness of American comedy. With classic skits like: Gump Fiction, O.J. Simpson bloopers, The XXX Files, and the UPS guy, MADtv proved that not only was it funnier than any sketch comedy show on t.v., it was also more creative. After MADtv all of the original cast has found thier calling after the MADness, for example:
Mary Scheer(host of Cabana Chat) is now producer of the hit t.v. show Most Extreme Elemination Challenge.  David Herman is now voice of Roy on Father of the Pride, and Mayor PoopenMayor on Futurama. He has also starred in Dude, where's my car?
Bryan Callen is now star of shows like Oz, CSI, Law & Order, and 7th Heavan.  Orlando Jones is one of Hollywood's top black comedic actors starring in movies like Runaway Jury, Evolution, and Drumline. Phil LaMaar, maybe the most succesfull of all, is voices and stars of shows and movies like Spider Man 2, Futurama, RENO 911, and Samurai Jack.  Now Stern sidekick Artie Lange has made appearences in Elf, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and Old School. King of Queen's star Nicole Sullivan has been on Family Guy and Kim Possible, and Debra Wilson, well we love Debra Wilson. Features include HILARIOUS bloopers, a ""We're missing most of the first cast, but we'll call it a reunion anyway"" 200th Episode, deleted sketches(that were deleted for a good reason, they're pretty dull),and a collection of MADtv's best parodies.  SO... GET OFF OF YOUR FAT [...] AND BUY THIS DVD, NOW!!!!(you won't be sorry.)

Plus the MAD magazine came out in 1952 and SNL came out 1975. I didn't see this DVD season 1 but I see it LIVE on Fox every Saturday nights at 11/10 PM central. My favorite character is Michael McDonald. He's real funny in the show. I like those episodes where he plays as Stuart. And sometimes, he comes out in his underpants. I hope they make a MAD movie one day. If they do, they should call it ""The MAD movie."" And they should show the picture of the original guy on the MAD magazine Alfred E.

2100448,5,B0002KPHVU,"Saturday Night Live pioneered the art of sketch comedy with its debut in 1975. MADtv first appeared on FOX in the mid-1990s, based on Mad Magazine and ever since people say that its nothing more than a badly-imitated SNL with far less celebrities. Whatever. I believe SNL has lost that essential ingredient in making people laugh: HUMOR. I can hardly recall any sketches that truly made me laugh my ass off, although some did manage chuckles here and there. Maybe it's New York's version of British humor, maybe its humor for adults, I don't know... MADtv has far more brilliant and clever writing. Granted, the show hasn't had many star celebrities visit its set, but it honestly doesn't need them (though it helps). Lately, it seems that SNL has gone totally dependant on its ""What current famous star will be hosting this week?"" roster and forgotten about trying to forge wit and hilarity into its sketches. MADtv has had an excellent forray of cast members, with some exceptions; Pat Kilbane, Andrew Daly, Lisa Kushell just seem like the last-minute comedians tacked on the list. Some left the show I think much too soon since the people in this category (Alex Borstein, Will Sasso, Nicole Sullivan) left a legacy of memorable characters like Ms. Swan, the Vancome Lady, and Sasso's hilarious and brutal portrayal of Steven Seagal. Some may say the show goes for cheap laughs, and yes, sometimes they do. But, hey, at least I laugh. The sketches aren't afraid to cross that politically-correct boundary that those liberal-idiots invented, with political satire, racial and ethnic parodies, and just overall fun. Besides, how can you resist a total lovable idiot child like Stuart?",1100304000,6,1684,4.975177304964539

2100450,5,B0002KPHVU,"19 hour long episodes, one three double-sided/dual-layer discs, at a reasonable price that's not out to fleece the customers, unlike so many other season sets of hour-long shows (or, indeed, the multitude of half-hour shows where they stuff 8, 9, or 10 half-hour episodes on a single-sided/single-layer disc and look like crap and have the unmitigated audacity to sell for the same ~$33 price.)

Not just that, the bloopers and 200th episode extras were a great joy to watch, as were the 'best of' clips and unreleased skits.  Not to forget knowing that Warner Bros (the distributer) has enough faith to announce on disc 3 that season 2 will be coming!!

These episodes look and sound great as well (how could they not?)

No other TV show has been given this excellent level of treatment on DVD, and MadTV itself is a worthy enough of a show (at least to me).

Big kudos to Warner Bros on the quality of this release!  Now if only they would release their 'Doctor Who' titles in dual-layer.  :-)

While I tend to look more at disc quality, I should say something about the show's quality.  MadTV was FOX's latest attempt (1995) to create an edgy show, after In Living Color was put to sleep and The Edge not meeting expectations.  Many skits are brash and envelope pushing, but only in a good way.  (okay, some are distasteful, as is typical for the genre, but most will leave you with a smile on your face.)

The show also has a modern day feel to Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In (1968).  Naturally, as Laugh-In paved the way for all subsequent skit shows, including Saturday Night Live.  (Indeed, Lorne Michaels of SNL fame started with Laugh-In as well.)

Standout actors are Orlando Jones, Debra Wilson, and Nicole Sullivan, but there's not a bad actor of the bunch.

As the last reviewer also said, this was a season where we saw some mock movie trailers where they mixed two programs together. One example in this first season was their film - Blades.  A mixture of the Wesley Snipes movie 'Blade' and the Billy Bob Thorton movie 'Sling Blade'.  I thought it was so hilarious when I first saw it, and I still do.  At one point in the trailer the Sling Blade guy says, ""Yep...ate me a vampire once.  Sucker taste like corn.""
