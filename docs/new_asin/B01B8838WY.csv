8749620,2,B01B8838WY,"James Harris (Danny Dyer) is a paid assassin. He is hired by the Aberts brothers ( Martin and Gary Kemp) to kill Tony Boyd (Robert Cavanah) who reneged on a deal. After the deed is done (EARLY PLOT SPOILER) we discover his one night stand Chloe (Holly Weston) is Tony's daughter. She suspects the Alberts even though it looks like an act of passion. Chloe is determined to prove it, so the Alberts hire James to kill his girlfriend which he has trouble doing. The film devolves into a boring cat and mouse game.

The film has us rooting for a boring assassin and his drug using stripper girlfriend. I never cared for the characters. They weren't that well developed. Bad script.

Might work as a rental. A film you will forget shortly after you watch it.
