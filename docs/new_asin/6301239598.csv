While the Two Mismatched Twins from Virginia (Also Milder & Tomlin) are going to meet for the First Time (Unexpected) into One Crazy Situation.
Directed by Jim Abrahams (Co-Director of Airplane! and Ruthless People) made a fine (If Unoriginal) Screwball Comedy with Some Moments of genuinely Funny Moments. A Box Office Hit in the Summer of 1988, a Delightful Film, which is Fun to Watch. Grade:A-.",1018828800,,558,4.946808510638298

If you have no idea what in the hell that  was all about then you must at least rent this somewhere until it is  available again.

Actually  I would love to see another pairing of these two actresses.",968371200,3,410,4.36

323065,5,6301239598,"So there's nothing on TV except reruns?  Your husband wants to watch football and you hate football, so you go to the video rental to pick out a movie to watch on the spare TV in the bedroom?  Hey, I've been there, done  that.  Now it's time, if you haven't already, to rent a blockbuster funny  movie: Big Business with Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin.
When a rich couple  have to have their twin girls in a small town, all kinds of madcap comedy  starts to happen.  First, the kids get mixed up.  The rich couple is  supposed to have two Bette Midlers, if you can believe it.  And the poor  folks are suppose to have two Lily Tomlins.  But each couple gets one of  each.  And to make matters even funnier, both Lily's are named Rose and  both Bette's are named Sadie.  Each Sadie has a different personality.  Each Rose has a different personality.  Where do I begin?
The poor folks  Sadie is a cow milkin', sweet singin' kind of gal who yodels and has lots  of fun.
The rich folks Sadie is head of the family business now that her  mom and dad are dead, and she thinks she's hot stuff.  She's all stuck up  and full of herself.
But, when poor Sadie visits New York, she has a lot  in common with rich Sadie.  They both like the same kinds of clothes, and  like to eat the same things.
Poor Rose is Lily Tomlin at her best as a  brash, life ain't gonna stop her kind of gal.  Rich Rose is Lily Tomlin as  an accident getting ready to happen.  Poor Rose lets all her attitude hang  out, and says just what she's thinking.  Rich Rose cowers behind rich  sister Sadie.
But when they all get together, the fun really begins, as  ex-spouses and boyfriends find out they are attracted to Sadie, but it's  the other Sadie they're really interested in.  Same way with Rose.  Country  hick Fred Ward finds out he's really crazy about rich Rose.
This is a  really cool movie, and I'm sure it's better than that old footbal game your  husband is watching.  So get hop, hop, hoppin' to your nearest video store  and rent it.  I'd say to buy it, but it's currently not available.",962150400,27,2065,4.2793733681462145

You have one set of twins, raised in the country and another set raised in Manhattan. After many years, the country girls have to go to Manhattan to meet with the city girls. Neither set of twins knows about the other. Mistaken identities, confusion, split personalities and a little romance make for much laughter and so much fun!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Business/dp/B000065V3L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Business</a>",1502582400,,643,5.851063829787234

There are no boring scenes. No staring out the rainy window with music playing a la Sleepless in Seattle.
The scenes segue seamlessly as the storylines flow. Lilly Tomlin and Bette Midler hilariously play twins switched at birth, living in New York and West Virginia. The Big City Bette is the more aggressive twin, whereas the hillbilly Lilly is the more outgoing twin. The misplaced counterpart twins are longing for their rightful homes.
When the hillbilly twins decide to go to the big city to ""kick some snooty New York a**"", the mixups progress not only between the mismatched twins but also the boyfriends, prospective business partners, chauffeur, office workers and Plaza Hotel staff.
This is a wonderfully well-written and excellently filmed movie.  I've watched it many times and never tire of its hilarity. If I could I'd give it 10 stars.",1483401600,4,1080,4.775401069518717

Very hokey, full of stereotypes, not particularly funny. The twins' accents miraculously morph so no one ever suspects anything based on how they talk. In fact towards the end of the movie they all talked the same and I could not keep track of who was supposed to be who.

The only well done part is when the four twins are finally in the same place at the same time.

Being very sick, I watched the whole movie anyway, but I would never recommend it or rewatch it. Maybe if you're a big fan of the Beverly Hillbillies.....",1423008000,,657,4.282258064516129

Bette Midler [Outrageous Fortune,' Ruthless People' and Down and Out In Beverly Hills'] and Lilly Tomlin [All of Me' and 9 To 5'] are the first ladies of laughter. Star in this critically acclaimed box office hit about two sets of identical twins that are mismatched at birth. Forty years later, their paths cross amid the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, and the result is unrestrained pandemonium. New York's opulent Plaza Hotel is the setting for a wildly hilarious, classic case of mistaken identities, split personalities, and double trouble! With the unparalleled comedic talents of Bette Midler and Lilly Tomlin, two's company and four's a riot!

FILM FACT: The film was originally written for Ms. Barbra Streisand (Bette Midler's role) and Ms. Goldie Hawn (Lily Tomlin's role). The plot is a coincidental and playful combination of three previously recognizable stories: Aesop's The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse, Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper and Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors. The production company couldn't get the rights to film at the actual Plaza Hotel in New York City, so it had the hotel recreated on sound stages. To recoup construction costs, Disney produced a sitcom called The Nutt House around it. It was an expensive flop. Jim Abrahams said he staged one of the boardroom scenes based on an experience he had when a large agency used many employees to get him to sign with them. Ms. Bette Midler received an American Comedy Award in the category Funniest Actress in a Motion Picture for her performance in 1989.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Big Business [1988], directed by Jim Abrahams, is a fine example of the comedy releases that we saw in the late 80s. The comic timing which was successfully delivered by Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin is later developed in Jim Abrahams directorial film series Naked Gun and Hot Shots. The concept behind Big Business was loosely based on Shakespeare The Comedy of Errors, being a farcical comedy about two sets of identical twins and their mistaken identify.

Sometime in the 1940s, wealthy New Yorkers Hunt Shelton [Nicolas Coster] and his pregnant wife Binky Shelton [Deborah Rush] are driving through the country, when Binky goes into labour. She demands to find the nearest hospital, which happens to be in the rural town Jupiter Hollow, West Virginia. The main industry here is Hollowmade Furniture, which also owns many services in town including the hospital. Rather than wait around for a room, the  Sheltons buy Hollowmade so Binky Shelton can give birth. At the same time, Garth Ratliff and Iona Ratliff [J.C. Quinn and Patricia Gaul] are expecting a baby; she is taken to the same hospital. After both mothers give birth to identical baby girls, a harried nurse accidentally puts one of each set with the wrong mother; both are given the names Sadie Shelton / Sadie Ratliff and Rose Shelton / Rose Ratliff.

Flash forward to the 1980s, we find Sadie Shelton [Bette Midler] is the tough-as-nails, heartless CEO of Moramax, a large New York-based conglomerate; her flaky sister Rose Shelton [Lily Tomlin] is the vice-president. When Sadie Shelton announces plans to sell Hollowmade to Italian investor Fabio Alberici [Michele Placido], the folks in Jupiter Hollow are up in arms. Rose Ratliff [Lily Tomlin], who works at the factory, plans to go to New York to put a stop to it, while her sister Sadie Ratliff [Bette Midler], who wants more than rural life has to offer, is eager to take a bite out of the Big Apple. When they reach New York, they end up in the Shelton sisters' limo, sparking a string of misunderstandings and mishaps, entangling two gay Moramax assistants Graham Sherbourne [Edward Herrmann] and Chuck [Daniel Gerroll] who have to find the Ratliff sisters, and the men in the ladies' lives Roone Dimmick [Fred Ward], Dr. Jay Marshall [Michael Gross] and Michael [Barry Primus].

While well-constructed and often hilarious, the plot of Big Business' is as improbable as they come. But when something works, it just does, and this film works well in no small part thanks to the efforts of its two stars and its director. Bette Midler, in her fourth film for Touchstone Pictures after Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Ruthless People and Outrageous Fortune and Lily Tomlin have exceptional chemistry in both of their respective roles as well as a wonderful way with the snappy one-liners they've been given; while the idea of Ms. Bette Midler as a corn-fed country girl may be a bit of a stretch on paper, she makes Sadie Ratliff's desire for a more lavish urban lifestyle shine through. Director Jim Abrahams, who directed Bette Midler in Ruthless People' and keeps the pace sprightly and the tone light, and preventing the film's anti-corporate themes from becoming ham-fisted. The supporting cast does a fine job of supporting the stars, especially Fred Ward, who has a very funny scene where his character, professional mini-golfer Roone Dimmick, is clueless to the real nature of the two Moramax assistants' personal relationship, as well as a touching one where he explains exactly what makes Jupiter Hollow worth saving but it's Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin's show from beginning to end. What will happen to these twins when they finally meet face to face...? All I have to say is get ready for some BIG laughs from ""Big Business""!

Overall, I had a great time revisiting the film. Big Business' is just as funny the first time I saw it. The film will certainly have plenty of critics, but the film was never meant to be taken seriously. The film is harmless fun and makes for a very funny experience even today. Built on a solid script the films hilarious humour performance delivery was spot on, special effects were flawless and the music sets the scenes perfectly, in this must revisited 1980s comedy classic.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The film is presented in a lovely 1080p encoded transfer at its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1. Having reviewed a number of 1980s comedies lately, I have come to accept the fact that they will never offer the visual splendour of Disney animated classics, Technicolor extravaganzas, or widescreen roadshow musicals and epics, and I have adjusted my expectations accordingly. The transfer accurately reflects the way the film has always looked, with average contrast, a subdued colour palette, warm flesh tones, and few bright primaries. There is also a fair bit of grain, which is heavier in some shots than others; thankfully, Mill Creek has left it alone and not subjected it to DNR [Digital Noise Reduction] or Edge Enhancement that could make things worse. I also could not find any banding or compression artefacts. Please note, that on the back cover it informs you that the Blu-ray is Region A/1; well that information is wrong, as it is actually an All Regions Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The film's Dolby Stereo soundtrack is represented here as a 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio track. The audio really comes alive thanks to Lee Holdridge's score, with active use of the surrounds and a good balance of low, medium, and high frequencies; strings and horns have a real kick to them, as do the drum machines, which instantly gives away the film's 1980s origins. Dialogue is clear and intelligible, and there are few anomalies save for those inherent in the use of Benny Goodman's 1938 recording of ""Sing Sing Sing (With a Swing).""

Finally, this is a fine release from Touchstone Pictures. Big Business' is a raucous romp that gives Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin a chance to show off their comedic talents; they take that chance and get a huge payoff from their efforts. Despite its bare-bones status, Touchstone Pictures has made it available at a low price that should make it the  upgrade really worthwhile, especially for big fans of both actors. That is why I have loved this film, especially when it originally was released in 1998 and have never stopped loving it. What I also love is the way it was so cleverly done with the trick photography of both Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin and I bet both actors got very confused half the time and now having it in the Blu-ray format, has really brought the film to its best level ever, as both actors are true comedians of their craft, that is why it is a great honour to add this to my ever increasing Bette Midler Blu-ray Collection, but very sad there was not any kind of extras or especially the films Theatrical Trailer. Highly Recommended!

The other gals want to stop her and put things right.  Who will win...a must watch and find out.  Not as good as some Bette movies but a giggle and worth seeing.

I do have to say, Mill Creek's product has improved a thousand-fold since I first had a twenty pack of blurry spaghetti westerns from them.

The DVD did not have a full color graphic on it, (not printed on a printable white background) and the disk just didn't play. It seemed to be a ripped/copied version, not just a used one.

Everyone loved it because it is one of the funniest movies ever. Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin are both wonderfully over the top, and they have different comedic styles, which provide a perfect contrast to each other. This movie has a tight script, and plenty of visual as well as verbal jokes. It's also refreshingly non-reliant on gross-out humor like so many of the current comedy offerings. It's cheesy, it's silly, it's shameless, and it's eminently quotable.

And when you set this or any farce -- bedroom or otherwise -- at New York City's fabled Plaza Hotel, you know you're going to smack your head and say aloud, ""that's so stupid"" as you catch yourself belly-laughing in spite of your high-brow intentions.

The opening scene, driving through the beautiful New England countryside in fall has always been one of my favorite sights; it is even more beautiful in blu-ray. Breath-taking! And the confluence of the two oh-so-different women giving birth is priceless. Even knowing what is going to happen doesn't reduce the sympathy for the elderly, country nurse as she struggles to figure out what to do with 4 babies in the nursery. There's a little lag while viewers are introduced to the 4 girls who are now adults, and we are asked to stretch our imaginations a bit for the ages they're supposed to be, but two great actresses such as Lily Tomlin and Bette Midler swing us around to belief. When the two country twins travel to the big city to fight the closing of the small-town factory owned by the city twins, every moment is hilarious.

324396,5,6301239598,"One of my fave comedies from the 80's, there were reasons why this movie shouldn't have been as good as it was. The major reason being that the ""identical twins"" cliche has been done to death over the years, from Laurel & Hardy's ""Our Relations"" to Disney's ""The Parent Trap"". Thank goodness that it works here, or else it would've been a major letdown for fans of Bette Midler & Lily Tomlin. Playing two sets of identical twins--one set upper class, the other from the folksy ""hick"" town of Jupiter Hollow--which get mixed up at birth, Midler & Tomlin make every comic moment count as their characters cope with the feeling that they don't belong where they are--with the exception of Midler's corporate-driven dragon Sadie Shelton. When the Jupiter Hollow twins come to Manhattan for a stock meeting showdown with the Shelton's Moreamax company, that's when the movie shifts into high gear as the twins have near-misses with each other..and making every person's head they encounter spin off their shoulders!
The direction & writing is top notch, the supporting cast is terrific, and of course, there's Midler & Tomlin, giving it all they've got!

This movie is so happy, uplifting and entertaining from begining to end that I've bought it yet again; first vhs many years ago, then dvd, now blu-ray.  Buying blu-ray will make you feel that you're watching the movie for the 1st time again and a very big difference from dvd.  The title menu is also cool with the black and white screen split in 4 and background music.

I gave it 5 stars because I don't consider that 2 or 3 minutes in the begining of the movie of some graininess is enough to take a star away from this great movie and wonderful video quality after those few minutes.  Also other reviewers have removed more than one star just because of those 2 or 3 minutes.  Maybe they didn't keep watching after that?

No extras at all, zero. Not even a trailer.

But, for the bargain price I got this for today at Target ($3.99), I shouldn't really complain. It's just, to me, a missed opportunity to give this wonderful comedy a chance to showcase some extras.

the story of two sets of twins has been played alot over the years, and this takes the cake.  admittedly, the comedy is physical and situational, and actresses-driven, but the three blend well together.

*Big Business* still cracked me up.  Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin both play a set of twins.  At a small hospital in a small town, Jupiter Hollow, a visiting rich couple give birth to twin girls.  At the same time, a local poor couple give birth to twin girls.  However, an overwhelmed nurse misplaces one girl with another girl in their cribs.

Fast-forward to their adulthood...the rich twin girls take over their father's company.  Rich Sadie (Midler) wants to cut her losses and sell Jupiter Hollow.  Rich Rose (Tomlin) is just not into this whole corporate world and just simply follows what Sadie wants.  Meanwhile, Poor Rose wants to go to New York and give them a piece of her mind about this whole shebang.  Poor Sadie just wants to taste the city life of NYC.

Pretty soon, they'll meet and have a moment they'll never forget.

This is one of those movies that are just hilariously funny from beginning to end. With several cases of mistaken identity. The trick photography that brings both sets of characters together near the movie's end is outstanding.

Incidentally I recall an episode of Entertainment Tonight that compared this movie to the 1936 Laurel & Hardy feature titled Our Relations. Which had Laurel and Hardy in the same kind of mistaken identity situation. They had twin brothers named Alf Laurel and Burt Hardy. And like Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin,both sets of Laurel and Hardy characters eventually came face to face through the same source of trick photography.

However there are at least two notable differences between the two films.

1:Each set of L&H characters had different first names. Whereas Bette and Lily's characters both had the exact same names.

2:The first set of Bette and Lily characters had Bette as the agressive high strung bossy character,and Lily as the more sensitive and shy character. With the other set,these personality traits were reversed. Whereas L&H's characterization format remained the same with both pairs.",1138320000,2,1249,5.199004975124378

I definitely recommend this film.  It's one I have watched time and time again, and now I've just ordered the DVD, I'll watch it even more!!",1035417600,2,614,4.5225225225225225

I would like to ask that people not buy this and write or e-mail disney as to why that decision was made, I already have.  Maybe some good will come of it.  As for the movie, well I of course love it.  Isn't that obvious?",1031875200,4,303,3.9833333333333334
324550,5,6301239598,"""BIG BUSINESS"" is one of the greatest comedies ever made.  Boasting full-tilt performances by comic geniuses Lily Tomlin and Bette Midler, it is a fantastic film.
The story concerns two sets of twins who were mixed up at birth; the city super-rich Sadie and Rose Shelton, and Jupiter Hollow country folk Sadie and Rose Ratliff.  When the Shelton's company Moramax decides to stripmine Jupiter Hollow, the two Ratliff twins journey to New York in order to attend the annual stockholder's meeting and kick up a big fuss.
All the action takes place at the world-famous Plaza Hotel; the film is a delightful throwback to the screwball comedies of the 30's with the opening and shutting of doors, etc).  The cast includes Edward Herrmann, Mary Gross and Fred Ward in fine supporting roles, though the spotlight is always on Lily (Rose Shelton and Rose Ratliff) and Bette (Sadie Shelton and Sadie Ratliff).
Two thumbs up!
The DVD includes a trailer for ""Spy Hard"". (Single-layer, single-sided disc).",1030924800,4,993,5.006060606060606
324551,2,6301239598,"I was on a waiting list to get this DVD since I love this film.  Disney must have been cheaper than usual when formatting this disk, because it has no special features.  Oh I take that back, Disney did manage to hawk their upcoming cheesy straight-to-video cartoons in the previews before the feature.  Does that count as a special feature?  There are not even director's or actor's commentaries on the soundtrack or any information about the making of the film that fans would have loved to see.  The only thing we could hope for would be a special edition possibly when the film turns 20, but don't count on it.  Although a disapointment, still better than a VHS.",1030406400,5,665,4.593220338983051
324552,4,6301239598,"Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin together; sure to be a funny movie. That is very true though onscreen it seems weird that these two would be related in anyway whether familial or friendship. Twins were mismatched at birth and then given to a poor, country couple and the other two to a rich family. Unbeknownst to many for forty years, Bette belonged to the rich family and Lily to the poor ones. As the movie goes on, the twins meet up with one another and that is where the suspense occurs. The supporting cast which includes many men who are the love interests of these women do a great job and Bette and Lily are very funny as Bette is her usual wild, redhaired, funny self and Lily is the foundation holding the movie together while Bette remains herself. Get this movie especially if you like Bette or Lily or even if you have, know or want twins. Great movie!!",1029801600,,864,4.40625

must see this film ,very funny...",1024272000,,301,3.71875
324554,5,6301239598,"Big Business is great fun. Bette Midler has never been better. The rest of the cast also. It is one of the few movies you can watch over and over again without ever experiencing the dreaded ""deja-vu-all-over-again"" feeling so familiar with comedies.
""Camp"" it certainly is, but with such a lack of evil intentions that it is almost miraculous. No one hurts anyone but oneself...It is a real pleasure to watch completely outrageous characters behave in such an over-the-top manner. It must be seen to be believed.
I love Big Business. It ranks at the very top of my list of all-time favorites.
Enjoy!!!",1021939200,,601,4.788461538461538
