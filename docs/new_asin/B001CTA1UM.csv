3518177,1,B001CTA1UM,"Here is yet another Christmas movie that leaves no stereotypical stone unturned.  From the randy grandma character (""Wedding Crashers"", ""The Wedding Singer"" . . . seriously, why do writers NEVER get sick of this character?  It's not remotely funny anymore.) to the bonehead brothers to the father who resents his son's success, the gang is all here.  Vince Vaughn does his usual oblivious insensitive boyfriend thing and the script these cardboard cut-out characters are given to work with hits you over the head with its obvious themes of family, bonding and babies.  After the ""perfect"" couple show off their vibrant sex life (pretending to meet at a bar as strangers and getting it on in a bathroom) and give a giant anti-kids and marriage speech, you already know that this entire movie will be devoted to quickly changing at least one of their minds about all their ideas of what happiness is supposed to be.  And so Reese Witherspoon is handed a baby at practically every house, so she can suddenly start thinking ""Gee, I guess I'm missing out on something with my successful relationship and career.  I'd better get knocked up or I'll never feel fulfilled as a woman!""  And at every house, they get to see a couple that ""really know each other,"" no matter how poor or uneducated they may be, to drive home the point that the two leads don't really know each other at all, despite being together for three years.  Their favorite thing to do when they're together is pretend to be other people, get it?  They were never really themselves, and therefore their relationship is flawed.  You can figure out for yourself how the rest this sap-fest movie ends.

You know what I'd love to see?  Just once, a movie where a woman realizes that it's okay to live a life without children to ""fulfill"" her and to start realizing instead that kids are expensive, smelly, whiny, fatigue-inducing ungrateful little germ-infested noisemakers who drain both your sanity and your wallet that you're stuck with for the rest of your life, and then waltz off into the sunset living happily ever after while her friends sacrifice their vacations and dreams so they can sock money away into a college fund that their kid will decide not to use when they drop out after one semester to join a rock band.

But hey, that's just me and I have weird tastes.  I like movies where I can't see every twist coming and don't leave it feeling as if someone's force-fed me enough sugar to put me into a diabetic coma.  You may be different, and if so please enjoy every rancid moment of this pathetic holiday fruitcake.",1229558400,19,2589,4.696902654867257
3518178,2,B001CTA1UM,"This is a classic example of a romantic comedy trying too hard to be heartwarming. As a result, it comes across as something like a Very Special Episode of an eighties sitcom: occasionally very funny, but excruciating when it tries to be serious. The trope being beaten to death this time around is that of a perfectly well-adjusted individual - or couple in this case -  being compelled to change because of some harmless but unorthodox characteristic. The audience can see that they had no real problem to be resolved in the first place, but somehow nobody in the story can.

The ""problem,"" in this case, is that Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn both come from highly dysfunctional families and prefer - with good reason - not to spend Christmas with them. They also have a policy of lying to their relatives about their absence from the holiday get togethers because...well, because it's necessary to advance the plot. When a series of only-in-Hollywood mishaps leads to their cover being blown, great hilarity ensues as they reluctantly visit relatives who range from mildly annoying to outright abusive.

Some of what follows is really very funny, and of course it's only a movie and not really meant to be taken too seriously. The problem is that the movie seems to want to be taken seriously at times. That makes it only fair to ask why we're supposed to think Witherspoon and Vaughn's characters are flawed in the first place. While they're a bit immature and eccentric, they are also perfectly matched for each other and apparently very happy together. They enjoy each other's company and have no grand schemes for the future beyond continuing with what works, and they prefer to avoid spending time with relatives who are no fun at all to be around. The viewer is left wondering why this is a bad thing. Even in San Francisco, it appears ""family values"" are more important than happiness.

And that's not funny, no matter how many obnoxious relative jokes you throw in. Wait for the DVD rental, if that.",1229126400,6,2015,4.781609195402299
3518179,4,B001CTA1UM,"Brad (Vaughn) and Kate (Witherspoon) are heading to Figi for Christmas so they do not have to spend time with their family.  A dense fogbank grounds all flights out of San Francisco and destroys their plans.  A local television report from the airport seals their fate, and soon they are off to see their families - Brad's divorced mom and dad and Kate's divorced mom and dad.  Brad's dad (Duvall) and brothers (Favreau and McGraw) are hell on Brad, but Kate finds amusement in his discomfort.  Kate's mom (Steenburgen) is a bit of a cougar, making things uncomfortable for everyone.  By the time they have survived Brad's mom (Spacek), their relationship is hanging by a thread.  Kate's dad is not so bad, but by then it may just be too late.

""Four Christmases"" is a pretty funny holiday film.  Vaughn and Witherspoon are two likeable, funny leads.  A star-studded supporting cast keeps the humor coming as well.  The humor is of the squirmy, uncomfortable kind.  You feel bad for these two as they are forced to deal with their families.  This is an entertaining film for fans of holiday movies.  If you are in the mood for something Christmassy, check it out.",1228780800,59,1163,4.698019801980198
3518180,1,B001CTA1UM,"Worse movie I've seen in years.  Should be rated R with all the F words in it. I gave it a ""one star"" and that was generous.",1228608000,7,124,3.5925925925925926
3518181,2,B001CTA1UM,"It can't possibly be a good sign that A-list actors like Reese Witherspoon, Vince Vaughn, Sissy Spacek, Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, and Jon Voight agreed to star in ""Four Christmases."" Given their reputations--and for many, this includes Academy Award nominations--you'd think someone would have noticed that the story was both unoriginal and unfunny. There are only two possibilities I can consider, and neither one paints a very flattering picture: Either the cast was motivated by a paycheck, or they all suffered from a serious lack of judgment, believing that audiences would actually be entertained by it. Maybe it's a little bit of both. Whatever the case, they're stuck in film that tries so hard to be both funny and touching that it fails both ways. It starts as a comedy that only goes for the cheap laughs, only to become a bland sentimental commentary on the importance of family. I don't need to spend $8.75 to be told that we should spend time with our loved ones, even if they're completely insane. By now, I think we all know.

The setup: Vaughn and Witherspoon play Brad and Kate, a happily unmarried couple living in San Francisco. I have no idea what they do for a living, but given the fact that they can afford an apartment in one of the country's most expensive real estate markets, they're clearly paid well. Anyway, at Christmastime, they have a tradition of avoiding their families by vacationing in exotic locations; so as not to upset anyone, they claim that they're involved in humanitarian efforts, such as immunizing disadvantaged children in Asia. This year, they planned on going to Fiji. Unfortunately, heavy fog forces every outgoing flight from San Francisco International to be cancelled. What's worse is that a news reporter is there to cover the story, and lo and behold, Brad and Kate are interviewed on camera. Naturally, their parents, who are all divorced and living in separate homes, see them exposed on television. Now Brad and Kate have no choice but to visit their families on Christmas Day.

Christmas No. 1: Brad's father, Howard (Duvall). Duvall plays Howard like a parody of his role in ""The Great Santini""; he's a tough-talking man who belittles his son for being the more sensitive, more educated type. This is in direct contrast to brothers Dallas (Tim McGraw) and Denver (Jon Favreau), trained cage fighters who are also spending Christmas at home. Aggressive, rude, and always with a murderous glint in their eyes, they take great pleasure in beating Brad senseless, maybe because he no longer goes by his given name, Orlando (all of Howard's kids are named after the cities they were conceived in). Denver is visiting with his wife, Susan (Katy Mixon), who under less politically correct circumstances would be considered white trash--Southern, pregnant even though she already has a nine-month-old, thinking a Christmas feast is a casserole made from Spam and Doritos.

Christmas No. 2: Kate's mother, Marilyn (Steenburgen). Marilyn is apparently starved for some male attention, seeing as she fawns over Brad the instant he arrives. You'd think she'd be getting enough attention from her current husband, a pastor named Phil (Dwight Yoakam), but I guess she isn't. Already there is Kate's sister, Courtney (Kristin Chenoweth), who brought along her bratty daughter and newborn son, the latter of which projectile vomits on Kate. Both Kate and Brad have been telling people that they don't want children, and after Kate has a terrible experience in a bouncy castle--which involves a group of out-of-control kids and a pregnancy test--you'd think her mind would remain unchanged. But for some strange reason, she begins to think that settling down wouldn't be such a bad thing, that marrying and having kids might actually be worthwhile. But before she can even suggest this to Brad, she has to cope with her mother, who takes the liberty of casting her and Brad in Pastor Phil's nativity play.

Christmas No. 3: Brad's mother, Paula (Spacek). For the life of me, I can't understand why she and Brad's father got married in the first place. They couldn't be anything less alike. Howard is callous macho man while Susan is a sensitive pseudo-hippie. Be that as it may, Susan is now married to Brad's former childhood friend, who tries to reassure Brad by saying that he's not trying to be a father.

Christmas No. 4: Kate's father, Creighton (Voight). Creighton, a sincere, sympathetic man, may be the only decent character in the entire film. Given the amount of time spent on less pleasant characters, this is problematic. If he's so loving and understanding, why has Kate been avoiding him all these years? Why not spend the holidays with him? This is when the film shifts from humor to drama, with Brad and Kate coming to terms with the fact that, for all the happiness they've shared, they don't know each other as well as they thought they did. It just goes to show you that even predictable films can have trouble with consistency. At that crucial point in the story, Voight introduces patience, serenity, and charm, essentially going against everything the film established. Did he not realize that the film was intended to be a goofy comedy? I guess it doesn't matter one way or the other. ""Four Christmases"" is a ridiculous, clunky holiday movie, simultaneously desperate for laughter and tears, performed by actors capable of so much more. Here's one Christmas gift that needs to be returned.",1228176000,3,5465,4.968306010928962
3518182,2,B001CTA1UM,"This film did not impress me. I read some reviews beforehand, and figured that it wasn't a masterpiece by any means.

It feels like it was thrown together at the last minute, and both of the leads look totally bored most of the time. Don't get me wrong, there were some really funny moments in the film, but unfortunately, most of the film was rather weak, even stupid. You can tell that Vince Vaughn tries to save the day through improvisation.

See it if you have nothing else to do, or you could just wait for the DVD, which is what I wish that I had done.",1228003200,2,559,4.214953271028038
3518183,5,B001CTA1UM,"""Four Christmases"" is hilarious!

Just finished watching this movie, I was very happy with it. Vince Vaughn is hilarious as always, with his snappy comebacks and clever choice of examples and words! Reese Witherspoon was charming as usual and she did very well with the comedy!

The 1st hour of the movie is absolutely hysterically funny, then it takes a more serious turn, but is good throughout.

Robert Duvall plays Brad's (Vince Vaughn) Dad, his brothers Denver & Dallas (Tim McGraw and Jon Favreau) are awesome!

Cameo appearances by Dwight Yoakam, Sissy Spacek, and Jon Voight!

Funny stuff, highly recommended!",1227916800,9,617,5.13
3518184,4,B001CTA1UM,"Updated on December 24th, 2010;

In honor of today being Christmas Eve, I thought I'd review this movie. It's funny and you can relate to Brad and Kate because of their families. When their vacation to Fiji is cancelled, they are forced to go to each of their parents' houses for Christmas. Both Brad and Kate's moms are cougars, and Brad's dad is old skool country. If you like Christmas flicks, you may enjoy FOUR CHRISTMASES!!!",1227657600,,430,4.657894736842105
3518185,2,B001CTA1UM,"My daughter had it right. When we saw a commercial for this movie before it opened, she took one look and said ""That looks stupid."" And I said, ""But look who is in it! It has five -- FIVE -- Oscar-winning actors. The ending song is by Tom Petty. I love Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn. It has to be better than this trailer. I hate trailers."" So then we launch into why they are called trailers, when what the studios do is play them BEFORE you see the movie. Talk about putting the cart before the horse.

But I digress.

This time the trailer had it right. I was sure there had to be more. I was wrong.

It starts kind of promising, with a fake meet cute between the two leads. They seem extremely shallow and self-centered, but that could be funny. It never got funny. On my notepad I kept writing down ""I hate these people.""

The story revolves around a day in which the leads have to travel to each of their four parent's houses to celebrate Christmas. At the beginning, they come up with an escape word, so if things get too unbearable they just say the word and know it's time to leave. That word is ""mistletoe."" Inexplicably, they only say the word a couple of times.

One thing that surprised me was that the movie sort of hated women. I lost count of the number of times and ways women were put down. With the likes of Sissy Spacek, Mary Steenburgen and Reese Witherspoon in on this, I'm just sitting there, in wonderment.

The last straw? In the closing credits I noticed one of the executive producers is Peter Billingsley, and that he plays a small part in the movie. Do you know who that is? The blond kid with glasses from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Christmas-Story/dp/B0000AYJUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Christmas Story</a>&nbsp;that really really wanted a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas.

the plot

This is the story of an unmarried San Franciscan couple named Brad and Kate.  Brad and Kate have been living together for three years very happily.  They never really talk about themselves except for their pet peeves, which they seem to have in common.  One of their beefs is visiting their families on Christmas.  They both do not get along with their folks back home, and each year they make up a valid-sounding excuse for why they do not come home for Christmas.  It's usually a selfless act like feeding the sick in a third world country.

This year was a little different because they were caught in their lies.  Taking off out of San Francisco could be tricky sometimes with the thick smog, so on this day all of the departing flights were cancelled.  The local news was there interviewing people live about how they are going to deal with being grounded.  Brad and Kate were the first to be interviewed, and of course their families saw them on TV and now they expected them to come home for the holidays.  Since they were cornered now, they had to make the rounds.  The main caveat of course is that both of their parents are divorced and still living so they had to make four visits all day and night.

Their fears were realized as they relived the horror stories of their youth, the teasing of the siblings and being forced to learn the secrets about each other that they tried so hard to avoid all of these years.

the bottom line

It really pains me to give this review a low rating because I am such a big fan of Reese Witherspoon.  Plus in addition to this ultimate eye candy we also have Kristin Chenoweth, a short little firecracker herself who was cast brilliantly as Reese's sister here.  So how can I dislike a film with two of the most beautiful women in Hollywood?  In this case it was easy.

Now don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the first few scenes of this movie.  I actually laughed out loud at a few of these early scenes.  As you probably know already from the title alone - the couple had to visit four different homes for the Christmas holiday.  The first house was when Brad and Kate (Vince Vaughn & Reese Witherspoon) visited Brad's father's home.  Brad's relationship with his father and two brothers was obviously strained due to the obvious differences between his family and himself.  Brad is very successful money wise and not as rube like as they are and their families.  It was funny and also insightful especially when we learn that Brad's name used to be Orlando before he changed it.  It shows that not only are they different inherently, but Brad also chose to widen the chasm between they and he.

It's after this when the film begins to go downhill.  When the couple then goes to Reese's mother's house, it starts off with some funny observations, like the new friendly Jesus statue in the front yard.  Brad also learns some funny secrets about Kate as he leafs through the family photo albums and hears the stories from her mother and sister.  One of the secrets is that Kate has been afraid of the Jump Jump (the bounce house in the backyard where the kids are playing), because when she was a young girl she was trapped inside by her mean friends and family and tortured for an hour or more.  In an attempt to be funny, the writers decide to recreate this situation when she's an adult.  Will the kids still be mean to her?  The answer is yes - but why?  It doesn't ring true, and therefore loses any comedic moments as you're probably spending your time in pure frustration as you watch this scene.

It has more of the same kind of humor for the rest of the movie, except it delves more into a darker subject as we progress much in the same manner that Vince Vaughn's The Break-Up had done.  The subject matter sort of resembles each other from the two movies, except with The Break-Up there was much more reality to the story.  If your families were really this annoying and hurtful, you would probably be at the point where you wouldn't have to lie to them about not coming over for Christmas, you would just cut them off completely.

So what else is there that the film has to offer?  Well for me, looking at Reese would usually be enough, but in an attempt to ruin it for completely, Reese dons an awful wig (or two) for most of the movie - much in the same way she had done in Legally Blonde 1 & 2.  The wig is the wrong color (strawberry blonde); it hides her delicious forehead and ruins the whole natural beauty she possesses.  Luckily Kristen Chenoweth is in the movie, where even Vince Vaughn cannot seem to take his eyes off of her all logic-defying body.

This movie is more annoying than it has to be, and worse yet with no real payoff at then end.  Wait for this one to appear on whatever subscription service you purchase in your home.  You're not going to be missing much if you miss this one.

3518447,5,B001CTA1UM,"A someone with a nutso family I relate all to well to this movie. Vince Vaughn really embodies the child who has put distance between himself and his family because of the disparity in thoughts and values, and Reese Witherspoon is the child who's been in the background for most of her life, not as successful as her sister because of this or that. This review makes the movie sound like a drag, but the acting and directing really puts a very humorous spin on family dysfunction and what we're willing to endure for the sake of love and togetherness. My family and I always watch this during the holiday season, often before we have to go to our own gatherings.

Vaughn and Witherspoon play two horrible, self-centered,  shallow,  self-centered,  shallow, self-centered scumbags. Did I mention shallow and self-centered?  After being unable to fly to their typical vacation, they're forced to spend Christmas with their families. And, spoiler alert, from their family Christmas, they learn absolutely nothing about love, caring, family, the real meaning of Christmas, or anything else. A good contrast here is Jingle All the Way.  That film was,  on the surface, about horrible people focused on the wrong things.  But you can tell it's actually a stinging indictment of commercialism and greed taking over Christmas. Four Christmases,  on the other hand, doesn't seem to have any redeeming message.

3518895,5,B001CTA1UM,"Hysterical Christmas movie for the cynical at heart. Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon play a yuppie couple, who although in love, have no desire for family and commitment. Their Christmas holidays are usually spent traveling the world on expensive vacations, and they lie to their families about the reasons they are never in town. Their explanations concocted for the family as to why they travel and miss the holidays every year is much more altruistic than the truth.

When things go south, and they are forced to stay in town, they have no excuse but to see their families, and they embark upon a hilarious journey to spend Christmas with their various family members.

Vince Vaughn is Vince Vaughn, as always. He plays a droll Christmas Grinch, and his stories and explanations of the couple's behavior are quite funny. Reese is perky and a good foil for Vince's droll humor. She also has some great scenes in this move that will make you laugh out loud.

Robert Duval, and John Faverau round out the cast, and are equally comical.",1476748800,,1038,4.787709497206704

3519189,3,B001CTA1UM,"How many Academy Award winners can a studio cram into one cast and still turn out a mediocre movie?  In the case of 2008's ""Four Christmases,"" the answer is five:  Reese Witherspoon, Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Jon Voight, and Mary Steenburgen.  Mediocre is mediocre no matter who's in it and no matter what the disc format.

The story, a romantic-comedy variation, concerns a fun-loving San Francisco couple, Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon), a boyfriend and girlfriend who have lived together for three years without a hitch.  Things are going swimmingly for them until on their way to spend a Christmas in Fiji they find the airport fogged in, so instead of heading for the South Seas, they decide to visit their parents, each of whom is divorced and lives in the S.F. Bay Area.  Four visits, four Christmases.  But most of their relatives are so obnoxious, they test the limits of the couple's love for one another, and, worse, they're so obnoxious, they test the audience's limits.

The film's biggest drawback is that it can't make up its mind where it's going.  For three-quarters of the story, it's all slapstick comedy, and then, for the last quarter, it turns all mushy and sentimental.  The comedy is far too broad and dumb to be funny, and the ending is too gooey and false for a viewer to take any of it seriously.  Besides, the transition from one extreme to the other is jarring.  In other words, none of it works.

None of it works, including Witherspoon and Vaughn.  You'd think they'd be able to carry anything, but the material here is so thin, not even they make anything of it.  Witherspoon plays a character mainly exasperated, trying unsuccessfully to cope with a canceled trip to Fiji and the challenges of their families.  She gets little that's humorous to do.  Vaughn, on the other hand, has to carry the load, which he does by playing essentially the same character he always does:  the slick, cool, put-upon know-it-all dude.  It's not enough.

The first relative they visit is Brad's father, Howard (Robert Duvall), a grumpy old macho jerk.  Worse, Brad's two brothers, Denver (Jon Favreau) and Dallas (Tim McGraw), are also visiting the dad, and they both behave like sub-cretins.  Brad says they compete in the UFC, but they actually make money in backyard pickup fights.  They make the Griswold's Cousin Eddie look like a NASA scientist by comparison.  Most of the action here is of the knockdown, drag-out variety, with Brad's brothers physically attacking him, people falling off roofs, and the gags telegraphed a mile away.

The next relative they visit is Kate's mother, Marilyn (Mary Steenburgen), who seems to lust after every man she meets, including Brad.  It appears the scriptwriters were going to follow this angle further, but it goes nowhere.  Anyway, Marilyn is also a born-again Christian keen on taking Kate and Brad to Church, where a New Age, rock-star preacher, Pastor Phil (Dwight Yoakam), holds forth.  The disc's deleted scenes indicate the filmmakers intended this relationship to go further as well, but it doesn't.

The third relative they visit is Brad's mother, Paula (Sissy Spacek), an overage hippie now living with one of Brad's best friends from childhood.  Obviously, seeing his mom living with this man half her age, this childhood buddy, doesn't sit well with Brad.

The final relative they visit is Kate's dad, Creighton (Jon Voight), the only sensible member of either family.  As a result, Voight has almost nothing to do but stand around for a few minutes looking earnest and then disappear into the woodwork.

Seth Gordon (""The King of Kong"") directed ""Four Christmases"" as though it were a TV movie-of-the-week.  The dysfunctional family issues fall flat; the ridiculous caricatures are insulting; the film's pratfalls are more annoying than amusing; and even the children are horrible little people.  Mercifully, the movie is brief at eighty-eight minutes, with each of the four episodes only about twenty minutes long.  So, this mostly mean-spirited affair at least doesn't have too much time to get under our skin.

Video:
For this Blu-ray release, New Line use a single-layer BD25 and a VC-1 codec to reproduce the movie in its native aspect ratio, 1.85:1.  If none of this sounds too inspiring, it's not surprising.  There's not a lot to reproduce in much detail.  It's a rather simple, straightforward film, with nothing much more than images of a few household interiors to transfer to disc.  The picture is somewhat soft most of the time, almost nondescript, actually, with colors ranging from bright and crisp to dim and dreary.  There is nothing really wrong with any of it, but nothing stands out, either.  Black levels look good, but shadow detail is just average.

Audio:
If the picture quality is pretty ordinary, the sound is even more ordinary, despite its coming to us via lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  There's simply not much going on here because the soundtrack is primarily dialogue.  There are no dynamics to replicate, no wide frequency response, no deep bass.  There is just a smooth midrange and a touch of ambient musical bloom in the surrounds.

Extras:
The disc comes with a full complement of mainly promotional featurettes.  First up is ""Four Christmases:  Holiday Moments,"" about eleven minutes wherein the movie's stars and filmmakers talk about their own Christmases but mostly talk about the film.  Next is an HBO First Look:  ""Four Christmases:  Behind the Madness,"" thirteen minutes that hype the movie further.  After that is ""Seven-Layer Holiday Meals in a Flash"" (HD), ten minutes with down-home celebrity cook Paula Deen and one of the film's supporting players, Katy Mixon, cooking up a storm.  Next is a two-minute gag reel, followed by seven additional scenes totaling about eight minutes.

Things wrap up with twenty-three scene selections; BD-Live access; a bonus digital copy of the movie for iTunes and Window Media (the offer expiring on November 24, 2010); a slipcover for the keep case; and, despite what the keep case says, English and German spoken languages; German, Dutch, and Spanish subtitles; and English and German captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Shots:
The question I would have to ask about ""Four Christmases"" is, Why?  Why did so many good actors choose to be in it?  Did they need the money?  Did their agents talk them into it?  Did they not read the script?  Surely, they could have foreseen what was coming.",1433289600,,6471,4.968342644320298

3519588,5,B001CTA1UM,"Four Christmases

Its hard for a director to go far wrong when he has such a great cast to work with.  Ill start with the smaller roles and work up.  Country music giants Dwight Yoakam and Tim McGraw have small supporting roles.  Mary Steenburgen and Sissy Spacek are the two divorced mothers.  Robert Duvall and Jon Voigt are the two divorced dads.  Vince Vaughn is back on top after the unfortunate The Break Up.  And Reese Witherspoon, the blazing star, makes this comedy of Christmas come alive.  Reese can carry a dramatic role as well as any actress working today, but her forte seems to be comedy.  This is almost as good as the best of the Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan romantic comedies.
 Reese and Vince are self absorbed yuppies who think more of having a good time and enjoying a busy, exciting but empty life than of holding any of the burdens of family reality.  Their vacation to Fiji is thwarted.  They are forced to spend Christmas visiting their two sets of divorced parents and assorted siblings.  This is a Christmas movie, so there is no surprise ending to give away.  They see how the various members of their fractured families truly care for one another and the familial love rubs off on them in the end.
 When you see this movie, look at Witherspoons eyes.  They show white below the iris.  This is exceptionally rare and may be part of her on screen watch-ability.

Vince Vaughn's comedic delivery style is the dry wit I love - understated with that devilish twinkle in his eyes...  Motherhood must agree with Reese Witherspoon because she is lovelier in this movie than ever before.  Both actors play their respective roles perfectly.  The supporting cast is awesome and well-cast.  There is one sequence in the movie that slightly threatened to turn it into a snoozer - the ""think about it"" scene(s) - you'll see....  Drew that bit out a little while too long, but otherwise it was a very enjoyable movie and I would definitely watch it again next Christmas!",1388793600,,681,4.827586206896552

The script is horrendous, the situations predictable. There are very few genuine laughs in this movie, and it's hard to determine who the audience is supposed to be: the humor is too adult, raunchy, and often disgusting for children, but the script is too inane for adults. And what kind of Christmas movie could be this cynical and brittle?

So unless the movie improved dramatically in its second half, which life was simply too short to sit through, it's only deserving of one star. Or possibly fewer if Amazon would permit it.",1388793600,,669,4.920353982300885

3519696,2,B001CTA1UM,"Some spoilers ahead: I like both Vince and Reese in general.  This movie just didn't have any spark to it. In the end, I barely cared whether or not things worked out for them.  Their relationship seemed sad.  Maybe it was because of a lack of chemistry between them, but the writing of the movie wasn't really top notch anyway.  It wasn't enough of a ""buddy"" movie (where they work together to survive 4 Christmases) and it wasn't enough of a relationship movie, where you see a progression of scenes that somehow change their relationship.  Apparently, holding a baby once and seeing your boyfriend hold a baby is enough to make you do a 180 to go from ""no family ever"" to ""let's start one right away"".  The slapstick scenes weren't that funny.  I did laugh when Reese was tossing around children, but like most of the scenes, it felt more like a missed opportunity for something funnier.  So much potential.",1388016000,,910,4.608695652173913

3519699,2,B001CTA1UM,"When I started watching ""Four Christmases"" I was kind of looking for a Romantic Christmas Comedy.  It was definitely a comedy, but it wasn't terribly romantic.  For me that was no major deal because most romances can almost be too formulaic in a holiday movie anyway.

As the movie begins, Kate and Brad seem like a married couple who like to explore all kinds of activities together.  They look like an absolute fun couple who are trying to take the biggest bite of life that they can.  At first this seems refreshing but as they share about their feelings against marriage with others, they start to get more and more unlikeable.  It was actually kind of weird.

When the weather causes their annual Christmas getaway to be put on the back burner, Kate and Brad instead visit their family who they have actively avoided spending the holidays with.  Each visit gives us a little glimpse into who Brad and Kate are as well as their families.  As both have divorced parents and are fairly dysfunctional, you can kind of see why they are not married themselves.

Overall, considering the actors in the film, I really expected more.  Obviously they didn't write the dialogue nor direct it, but still there just was too much missing.  It was funny in parts but not that funny and it completely lacked warmth which is something I would expect in a holiday film.  Even when redeemed, these characters were not terribly likeable.

Because of the actors and title, I would have thought this would be a family friendly film.  I am not a prude when it comes to movies, but I would say that this is not one I would share with my son.  It isn't over the top in sexual nature, but there are moments that would require conversations that I don't think any of the kids in my family would be interested in having.

But I actually found this movie to quite humorous and even hysterical in parts, and it has become one of my favorite Christmas movies.  Now, it certainly doesn't have that  warm, traditional ""Christmasy"" feel, so if that's the kind of Christmas movie you're looking for then this is not the movie for you.  Instead, it is a funny, light-hearted poke at all of the millions of dysfunctional families out there and how they manage to survive the holidays together and survive each other.  The comedic chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon as a couple is fantastic, which honestly surprised me as I did not realize that Reese Witherspoon could be that funny.  There is a part in the movie where the two are forced to play Mary and Joseph in a church performance that makes me laugh out loud every time.

3519861,4,B001CTA1UM,"Four Christmases(released Nov/08)stars Vince Vaughn as Bradford 'Brad' McVie,Reese Witherspoon as Kate,Robert Duvall as Howard McVie,Sissy Spacek as Paula,Jon Voight as Creighton,Mary Steenburgen as Marilyn,and many others. I recall seeing this film on its premiere night way back when and thought it was not too bad a flick. I was expecting,as most so called 'comedies' are these days,something smarmy,and putting out with the quick witticisms and all,but it was just a little different enough to be able to enjoy it.
The story introduces us to an unmarried ""modern"" couple,Brad and Kate. Christmas is almost here and neither have spent a Christmas at any of their parents(all divorced)for at least three years now. They are a totally self indulgent couple,who love each other and tend to constantly analyze every minutiae of their relationship,in the most clinical and politically correct of terminology. They are certainly imaginative,because as the film opens the two are role playing in a bar(we don't know that until the scenario plays itself out).Brad comes up to Kate posing as a geeky mid westerner,totally unsure of himself. Kate listens then proceeds to blow his lame lines and him right out of the water. As she walks away he starts coming on like macho gangbusters and before you know it the two are making out in a washroom.
The next day the two are packing for and going to the airport,to catch a flight to Fiji. They each take turns phoning their relatives with another lame excuse about going to help out the indigenous population on a charitable flight. However this is San Francisco and the weather conspires to fog them in and get their flight cancelled for a day. And to boot they are interviewed on television,which each and every relative sees. Now they are obliged to go Christmas visiting to their relatives whether they like it or not.
The first stop is Brad's father's home(Duvall),where he lives with Brad's two brothers and one of their pregnant wives. Both brothers act like fugitives from the WWE,with Brad as the brunt of their antics. The next one they see is Kate's mother(Steenburgen)who is there with HER mother and Kate's sister. Brad gets along alright but Kate,not so well. The next parent on the list is Brad's mother(Spacek),ho is shacked up with Brad's old boyhood best friend,so things don't go so well there. With each parent's visit,the two come to learn some awkward things about the other and themselves,which slowly raises tensions between the two. By the time they reach the final parent,Kate's father(Voight),the two are not speaking and Brad doesn't want to even come in,so leaves to go to his father's house. When Brad hears his father say that he is actually just like him,that is the straw which breaks the camels back and he returns to Kate to apologize and make up. And of course with making up comes the gentle toned,couple-self-analysis both are so good at doing. A year passes and the two have a new baby,on New Years day at that. A nurse asks about their families reaction and they say they haven't told them yet. The film ends as a TV camera crew comes in wanting to talk to the parents of the first new born of the year.
I found the humour to be well maintained throughout the picture. Their self analytical and politically correct approach and calm demeanours,when discussing anything related to their relationship,never fails to tickle the funny bone. Their families are a totally dysfunctional lot,which makes the two's mature personalities even more stark in contrast. The film is edited well and all actors involved do a a good job in their roles.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp. There are no extras.
All in all a surprisingly good Christmas film. This is NOT a film for the kiddies,but geared towards a more mature audience of say 17-18 years and up,due to the content. It does stay smart and punchy throughout and the acting is solid. Recommended. 3 1/2- 4 stars.",1353110400,,3982,4.874631268436578

3519865,1,B001CTA1UM,"I'm not sure how to explain all the things wrong with this movie. I agree with the reviewer who said this was a huge step back for Reese Witherspoon. This is a Christmas movie that starts out with a couple who live together but to spice up their love life, they cruise bars and pretend they don't know each other. In the first five minutes there is a word I wouldn't want my kids to hear and I didn't care for it in a Christmas movie either. The big line in this movie is ""you can't spell families without lies. That nearly says it all. This couple plans a trip for the holidays telling their family they can't visit but are caught on a TV camera at the airport which blows their ""lie"" about why they can't visit. They have to visit four families as both their parents are divorced. There is not a redeeming quaility here. If you want a feel good, truly Chrismas movie, this isn't it. One person said she would put this as one of the 25 worst films she had seen. I would take that down to ten.

This film with five Oscar winners - Reese Witherspoon, Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Mary Steenburgen, and Jon Voight - has to be a low point in all their careers. Not a laugh or even a smile to be had throughout the entire film. You can add a star if you're a fan of Vince Vaughn's motor-mouth delivery and antics (obviously I'm not). Predictable from the opening scene to the requisite happy ending. Vaughn and Witherspoon are a couple (unmarried), both with divorced parents. Stranded when their vacation flight is fogged in, Vaughn and Witherspoon find it necessary to visit all four parents and their families on Christmas day. Duvall, Steenburgen, Spacek and Voight (as the parents) are pretty much wasted (Duvall seems to just phone in his now-familiar ""old Codger"" routine), with the first three downright embarrassing. Three of the four visits result in humiliation and unbelievable absurdity, while for some reason Voight (Witherspoon's father) escapes the caricatures scripted for the other three. The only thing good about the film is its relatively short running time.",1342051200,9,1107,5.189944134078212

All stars appear in movies,where the material script and even direction move in directions which really doesnt do the star much good...this is a christmas story much in the vein of national lampoon's christmas stories at first them moves in more serious directions. Always a pleasure to see Robert duvall and here the movie is interesting and there are many scenes of physical comedy among the brothers,and around tv satelite with 'sex predators' as installers or something?,the movie turns in a way showing how the 'mother' abandons the family and christmas values to romp about on her own?The movie then slides into the area that husband and wife really don't know each other her lesbian past(or do woman just have relations with each other their whole life long where men cant enter and center themselves)and this is a problem for him,there not relating is his not having privy to her past,where as she wants to move in direction of love ...love and christmas isn't that a fine indwelling of spirit? The children throughout movie are violent and intrusive,and in comedy like scenes she returns violence,with much upchucking!
Its good to see movie with church scene,of course no protestant minister would mention 'immaculate conception(and as a dogma it is very controversial)but the idea of celebrating virgin mary has cultural overtones here of a type of family,
to which female character seems uncomfortable. Then the cardgames and references to psychotherapy and 'taboos',and the concluding scenes where character is looking for love and acceptance,and those early life experiences hinted at,where as he just wants to vacate his mind vacationing at every possible moment...the vacation the antidote to all our modern ills...so the movie works in telling us about modern families and we could glean much about life and its always good to see this actress work with material which in this
case is not up to her standard,or what we consider her standard to be,but an interesting evocation of modern american life and relationships,with many ideas thrown in for this looking about modern life...",1333238400,,2198,5.14245810055866
3519869,1,B001CTA1UM,"It's a horrible movie. I sat through the movie in utter shock and horror. Every second of the movie was appalling.

The two of them were abused growing up, so now they avoid seeing their families, with good reasons. For some unknown reason they felt they had to put themselves back in their abusive homes for Christmas just because their families realized they were avoiding their abusive families all these years.

So, they go home to visit their now-divorced parents, and no surprise, their childhood abuse resumed, and everyone laughed at their plight because it's hilarious watching the two main characters tormented, beaten up, and placed in situations where they felt frightened or had their phobias triggered. Absolutely hilarious.

The audience for some reason were expected to laugh at the main characters' plights and not feel sympathetic at all to their situation. We were supposed to mock their suffering along with their abusive family members.

Well, unless if you're a horrible, abusive person, who enjoys watching people suffer, I don't see any reason you would enjoy this film.

Disclaimer: I had an abusive childhood, and every minute of this film reminded me of all the wonderful people in my life who watched me suffer and mocked me when I was beaten, threatened, or terrified for no reason by adults.

3519872,1,B001CTA1UM,"Four Christmases is the least endearing Christmas movie I've ever seen. It has a poor story with characters that you are supposed to like but only end up hating. Unlike, say, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, where the family was crazy but we ended up loving them anyway, the four families in Four Christmases are all without any redeeming qualities whatsoever. Whereas Christmas Vacation showed how important family was even when everything around them went wrong, Four Christmases basically supports the notion of the two main characters that they're better off avoiding them.

Basically, all their parents (except maybe her dad) have no parental qualities at all. There is no reconciliation between anybody. What exactly was supposed to be so funny about all the over-the-top things that happen, if there is nobody to like? There are no family qualities to any of them, to the point when it was just downright offensive. I didn't feel the least bit like laughing. I just hated their families - and eventually Brad, too, a loudmouthed and ultimately selfish man. Reese Witherspoon's character was the only character I felt for, but eventually I lost my respect for her too for choosing to be with that man.

The message is extremely heavyhanded and clumsy. How are families as awful as theirs important when they don't care for them in return? In NP's Christmas Vacation, you came to care for the family. Not so much here, I just hated the lot of them. Me and my parents made a mental note to keep this film on the shelf in the future.",1325980800,2,1542,4.837121212121212

The story portrays a couple whose planned Christmas vacation to Fiji is ruined due to bad weather.  The story has an interesting albeit adult beginning.  In fact, I think this is one holiday movie that is for the adults or more mature view audience, especially in light of the fact that the reality of certain cultural/holiday icons are called into question.

Summary of Good:
1. The movie is humorous however, its not really laugh out loud funny.

Summary of the Not So Good

3519886,3,B001CTA1UM,"`Four Christmases' is a pretty funny comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon and is about a couple who decide to go holiday each year rather than spend time with their four divorced parents. Unfortunately this year their flight gets grounded and their usually calm and placid relationship is turned upside down by visiting the various families and the revelations that are uncovered. There are a few laughs throughout but nothing that will have you holding your sides or panting for breath and although this is marketed as a Christmas movie, it is merely the backdrop to the events that unfold. It could be any major family event or national holiday to be honest. The performances are all pretty good and the cast is impressive as well, with Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, Jon Voight and Sissy Spacek as supporting cast. At just over 85 minutes this is short enough to be funny without being wearing and you don't have enough time to get bored. The direction is simple and not that noteworthy, just run of the mill comedy fare the whole way through. If you want a light hearted comedy, with the odd toilet or sex joke and nothing you have to think too hard about then this is the place to go. It's good but you won't rush to watch it twice.

The answer is - two dysfunctional families during the holidays.  And what's funnier yet is being obligated to visit both families twice - hence four Christmases.

Well what else can you do if your parents are divorced and your partner's parents are also divorced?  You have to visit both Mom and Dad, with common family members gathering at each parent's home, and you have to do the same for your partner.  This is especially true when you get caught on national television trying to escape the country for a Christmas vacation rather than commit yourself to family bonding.  And after a glimpse of their happy families, we can hardly blame them.

A situation like this is bound to be funny, yet it fell short from the classic Christmas comedies like Christmas Vacation and Home Alone.  While there was one attempt by the girl's father, played by Jon Voigt, to restore warmth to the holiday and meaning to family, the sentiment was not great enough to cement the gaps between madness and emotion.  This was made clear in the last scene when the couple gets caught again on camera while trying to hide a secret from their families.

3519903,3,B001CTA1UM,"Tell me you want a predictable, formulaic comedy and I will promptly suggest you should watch FOUR CHRISTMASES.  A self-absorbed, yuppie couple (Vince Vaughn, Reese Witherspoon) that historically avoids their extended families over the Yuletide (using outrageous philanthropic lies to explain why they're not available) suddenly finds itself outed via San Fran TV when their flight to Fiji gets cancelled (they are interviewed on camera after telling their families they were en route to Burma to help orphans).  Thus they must spend the Holidays with their families; and because both sets of parents are divorced, they have four houses to visit.

Over the course of these visits the viewer knows darn well there is going to be awkwardness, hostility, anger, confusion, denial, guilt--heck, name the emotion; plus over the course of the story the viewer also knows the couple's relationship is going to be stressed, tested, questioned, ended, then reconciled.  So with such a formulaic set of circumstances, how does the viewer complete this journey?

Through some fine moments of sheer comedic bliss.  Vaughn can still do physical comedy, and his brothers (Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw) and father (Robert Duvall) by far offer the most hysterical scenes of this film.  Mary Steenburgen (playing Witherspoon's mother) is remarkably well-preserved (roar, cougar, roar), and Sissy Spacek anchors another funny scene as part of the family plays a silly board game.  There are also lame parts (the church Christmas play was a stinker) definitely moronic, and the ending is weak, but FOUR CHRISTMASES does offer more chuckles than yawns.

3519907,2,B001CTA1UM,"Vince Vaughn seems to be going down the same path of Will Ferrell.  Two funny guys who apparently have a one dimensional ability to keep you laughing only within the spectrum of specific circumstances.  Four Christmases was not that venue.  While I admittedly did let a burst of chuckling escape now and again it was more of the slapstick comedy than anything the actor might have done.  I am a little surprised that Reese Witherspoon participated in a movie of this nature.  She always seemed more seasoned and above a swing and a complete miss such as this.

Damn, now that sounds harsh doesn't it?  Let me back up a little.  It was a Sunday evening, my fantasy football team had lost, knocking out any glimmer that I had of the playoffs and I was tired from drinking a little too much the night before.  It is surprising how a little wine can knock you for a loop when you don't drink that much.  You get dinged for drinking in excess and you get dinged when you don't drink enough.  You just can't win anymore can you?

So we rented a movie to go with the theme of Thanksgiving since I had watched a total of four in the span of four days.  I seem to go in spurts of movie watching and I am smack in the middle of an episode.  My girlfriend and I don't always agree with our first choices so we settled on Four Christmases as a compromise.  It seemed light hearted and we always like a good laugh.  My first choice was the GI Joe movie but she vetoed that immediately.  I guess I will have to watch that one today while she is out and enjoy it in the quite solitude as I crank the volume on high.

Four Christmases is about a man a woman who are living together and are so removed from family feelings they don't even have the desire to get married.  They spend their holidays on various beaches lying to their families so they don't have to venture back home.  Both sets of both parents are divorced so they have in total four houses for Christmas.  As luck would have it their flight gets canceled and they are they get interviewed on TV at the airport.  Their families' view the nightly news and they find themselves stuck seeing all four parents for one Christmas holiday.  Are you stressed yet?  It is difficult seeing one set of parents, it might kill you to see that much family all in one day.

As you might expect everyone is the most dysfunctional insane people you might find anywhere on the planet.  I wonder how these two turned out normal at all.  The couple goes through the typical road bump that faces all couples in romantic comedies and they then figure out how to proceed in life.  Ah, isn't it good that everything always works out in the end.

It was a little short on common sense and the believability of almost anyone was stretched.  Nobody has that many messed up people in one family.  Somebody needs to be normal to keep the peace.  Laughs were physical acts of babies puking and falling off of roofs.  It just didn't have any depth at all.  I don't have to have much in a movie but give me something.

It is not the worst movie I have ever seen and if you are in the mood for a couple of beers beforehand it might make it a little worthwhile.  I can't imagine there not being something better on to watch but if you get stuck in a pinch it won't make you break out in hives.  How is that for a resounding endorsement?

Stupid humor to be sure, but entertaining. The plot revolves around a dating couple who has to visit the households of their divorced parents - four houses in all. Each family unit has its own idiosyncrasies and grief. One of the things I liked about the film was that, in using four families, it seemed to capture so many of the awkward situations that make Christmas so uncomfortable for people - from showing old photo albums to introducing new boyfriends. The situations were pretty extreme to be sure, but also captured something of the truth of families. The best line was Robert Duvall's: ""You can't spell families without LIES."" That sums it up.

Reese Witherspoon gives a terrific performance, as always. However, I was pleasantly surprised that, with some exceptions, the rest of the cast was equally strong, including Robert Duvall and Jon Voight. I thought Vince Vaughn was a disappointment, as he usually is. He fits some comedic roles, but his range isn't wide enough. I just had trouble seeing him as the yuppie lawyer he was supposed to be in the film. He had some funny roles, but also seemed to be trying too hard.

Vaughn's casting for the co-lead role, plus the film's denouement, forced me to give the film 4 rather than 5 stars. I felt like the movie died down near the end. It became predictable and boring, with the inevitable fight and reconciliation. Worst of all, it lost its comedic nature. We don't need a lesson in family morals and encouraging people to get married and have kids. The movie should have ended on a high rather than a low. Alas.",1267920000,,1761,5.175438596491228
3519909,4,B001CTA1UM,"At one point I almost choked to death while laughing. Good enough for me. This is merely a funny and silly movie, with no malice toward Christianity or anyone else. I was not insulted or offended, and trust me, I know when they are out to insult me. Which is often! For 90 minutes I was amused, entertained, surprised, and tickled. The Nativity and Christ are not what is being made fun of here folks, and if you cannot tell the difference, you are in trouble. What is being satirized is the gooey cultish worship service that venerates the charismatic pastor, thrives on emotion, and celebrates glitz rather than Christ. And to put a couple of self-absorbed jerks into this stage play makes perfect sense in the context of this tale. A Christian should be offended by the pastor's behavior, not that of the yuppies. He should know better; they don't.

The supporting cast was glorious, with nearly everyone working their weirdo mojo perfectly. Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek ARE their characters, filling every nook and cranny of personhood with a believable and real behavior. Kristin Chenoweth, so wonderful in Pushing Daisies, is again sufficiently bubbly to be engaging and sufficiently odd to be quite offputting. She is a hoot! Where Four Christmases failed with me was in the stars themselves. Both Vince and Reese didn't really inhabit these roles. Any comparable actor/actress could have played these parts with the same oomph.

But this is minor. With lots of belly laughs, lots of fiendishly clever throw-away lines, (my favorite, ""And how are you, little lady?"") and enough sight gags to populate a Laurel and Hardy festival, this film offered a quality evening's entertainment.

STARRING: Vince Vaughn, Reese Witherspoon, Robert Duvall, Tim McGraw, Jon Favreau, Sissy Spacek, Jon Voight, Mary Steenburgen, Dwight Yoakam, Kristin Chenoweth and Katy Mixon

WRITTEN BY: Matt Allen, Caleb Wilson, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore

DIRECTED BY: Seth Gordon

Rated: PG-13
Genre: Comedy
Release Date: 26 November 2008

Producers must have mind-splitting aneurisms trying to place a co-star next to Vince Vaughn. The guy is a power-house of talent and very few actors can carry scenes with him, let alone entire movies. Jennifer Aniston, Owen Wilson and John Favreau have been the most successful at this.

While I absolutely adore her, Reese Witherspoon falls short comically in this film. It isn't her fault as her character clearly was not given as much attention as Vaughn's in the script; but the film suffers from it nonetheless. Other than this and a few over the top slap-stick elements that could have been shaved down, the film is a blast to watch.

The opening scene was classic and couldn't have been better. It's laugh out-loud funny and gets the movie going quick and in a hurry.

Vaughn plays Brad and Witherspoon is his girlfriend Kate. They agree to ditch-out on their families and head to somewhere tropical for Christmas. Their plan seemed flawless until they are interviewed at the airport, on live television and their families see the broadcast. They told their loved ones they had other plans as to why they wouldn't be able to make it for Christmas, and now the cat is out of the bag.

As all four of their parents are no longer married, they must drive to four different houses in order to please everyone.

Everything goes horribly wrong from one house to the next and we learn more about Brad and Kate through their families. It seems the two have had some non-transparent issues lurking in their relationship, and the comedy feeds on them.

Their families are terrifically cast with a huge A-list range of names all the way from Robert Duvall to Jon Voight. When you take into consideration how little screen time there is for each side character, you really appreciate the chemistry everyone had in the film.

My favorite scene was meeting Brad's mother (Sissy Spacek) and her new boyfriend who used to be Brad's best friend. This guy was such a creep and you felt Brad's pain as he tried to hold back from strangling this guy, as he made inappropriate comments and gestures. Jon Favreau joins the scene as one of Brad's crazy brothers Denver. He has a ridiculous haircut and the personality of a 10-year-old problem child. Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn together is about as good as it gets, in any movie.",1266019200,,2657,4.815384615384615

3519913,4,B001CTA1UM,"Vaughn, who plays himself, like in every movie, and Witherspoon, as her normal loveable self, are a couple that doesn't want to be a family, have a family or spend time with family due to the scars of dealing with their families. When their plane flight to Fiji is cancelled due to weather, they have no excuse to avoid spending time with their families. This movie chronicles the results of the four visits (both parents are divorced) to their families throughout the day. Along the way, watching their families and recognizing the good and bad in them, the couple start to recognize the shallowness of their co-existence.

The leads are funny, the situations comical and the lesson invaluable. The most important thing is family, no matter if we believe it or not. A fun diversion for adults looking for a capable comedy with heart - no matter the time of year.",1265760000,,863,4.71523178807947

In all honesty I would rank this film among the top 25 worst films I have ever seen.  I found very little humor in it.  Many of the attempted gags are ripoffs of other successful Christmas movies, including Christmas Vacation.  In this film they fall flat.  The adult characters all act like back woods idiots.  The kids are ill mannered brats.  The movie was so annoying I had to turn it off after an hour.  Nobody has a perfect family, but Four Christmas paints such a cynical and negative view of families it's actually offensive to watch.  I'm really surprised that Reese Witherspoon would agree to this script after her critically acclaimed performance in Walk the Line.  This is a major step back for her.",1263600000,15,831,4.662068965517242
3519920,2,B001CTA1UM,"Synopsis:  Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) are a well-to-do unmarried couple who are preparing to go to away for the holidays until their flight is delayed... and a snooping news crew exposes them doing so (much to the chagrin of their families, who now realize they'll be in town for the holidays.)  The couple has to go each of their parents' respective homes (both sets of parents divorced) and watches their bond get tested by Brad's overly-aggressive dad Howard (Robert Duvall), Kate's born-again (and perhaps too-informative) mom Marilyn (Mary Steenburgen) and her pastor husband Phil (Dwight Yoakam), amd Brad's cradle-robbing mom Paula (Sissy Spacek).  During this time, it becomes exposed with how little they know about each other and their own thoughts and fears.  Can they escape the holidays unscathed or are they going to be forced to either change their relationship or breakup?  Jon Voight appears as Kate's father Creighton.

Yeah, you know, the star power was there but I really couldn't groove on much else.  It just seemed like Vince Vaughn was being, well, Vince Vaughn and the story seemed to go toward the predictable when it had 100 or so elements that could have really thrown it over the top.  Murphy's Law applied itself whenever it could until the entirely predictable ""reconciliation moment"" happens which goes towards the typical Hollywood ending.  It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't lasting, either.

If you're a hardcore fan of romantic comedies or Jon Favreau, you might enjoy this film.  General movie viewing audiences, on the other hand, may not find it as rewarding as other films out there.",1263513600,,1644,5.074349442379182

Even though this film is in a Christmas setting, I didn't feel it to be a ""Holiday"" film. I think this film can be enjoyed anytime of year. 4 stars is probably a little too high of a rating, but I haven't laughed this hard in a while!

I've had multiple family visitors throughout the holiday season, all of whom have thoroughly enjoyed this film!  Oddly, it seems the more I see it, the more I like it!  This is just a charming, funny, and sometimes witty film with a healthy dose of  physical comedy thrown in that anyone can find entertaining AND it is short enough that no one will get bored (it actually leaves you wanting more)!

I felt zero chemistry between the two stars, and that might have made all the difference.

3519928,3,B001CTA1UM,"Four Christmases is shot in San Francisco and the Bay Area which is one of the most gorgeous locales on earth. The great advantage of Blu-ray shown in 1080p is that one feels like an observer to an event in real lie or real time. City hotels ought to insert brochures in the Blu-ray edition of this Seth Gordon comedy because it was every thing I could do to resist booking a trip to the city by the bay throughout the film.

Four Christmases is a silly romantic comedy with first rate actors and a third rate script. How many films can get  Reese Witherspoon, Vince Vaughan, Mary Steenburgen Sissy Spacek,  Robert Duval, and Jon Voight in one cast? Added to those stars are folks like Tim McGraw, whose hilarious portrayal of brother Dallas suggests we will see as well as hear him in the future, and Dwight Yoakum, as Pastor Phil, a dead on New Age evangelist.

The problem is that while the situation has great potential-unmarried hedonists caught forced by circumstance to spend Christmas Day with four sets of parents-the writers or director Gordon resorted to slapstick rather thanlet the emotional conflict of such circumstances carry the film. Do we need five minutes of brothers Dallas and Denver wrestling with Vaughan, whose real name turns out to be Orlando, not Bradley? Why does an An Academy Award winning actress like Reese Witherspoon need to conquer her fear of a ""jump jump"" to find out if she is pregnant? Would any female significant other put up with Vaughan's upstaging antics at Pastor Phil's Christmas pageant?

So at the end of the film we are left with a taste of San Francisco, and a sense of loss for what might have been.",1262304000,,1651,4.640410958904109

It works.

The film is kind of like a hodgepodge of other (better) comedies, but within all the madness is a film that is enjoyable to say the least.  My wife commented on how stupid the movie really was, but in the end both of us said it was `stupid funny' and not stupid enough to make us turn the movie off.

Brad and Kate are dating with no prospects for marriage or children.  They like being crazy, spontaneous and free.  Throw any form of commitment or responsibility their way and they run screaming in the other direction.  Every Christmas they avoid family like the plague (they both come from broken homes) but when their trip to Fiji is cancelled due to weather problems they find themselves squeezing in four Christmases with a random group of ridiculous family members.

Really, it's not like any of this seems remotely natural or believable, but I don't think that was the point.

Some have mentioned that Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon have no chemistry with one another (although they do have some), but they have a lot of chemistry with everyone else (especially Vaughn), which more than makes up for it.  I am a huge fan of comedian Vaughn (seriously, why didn't he begin his career like this?) and so I was really excited to see him carry this film, and he did (rather well).  The whos-who of supporting players are really overshadowed by a few small names.  In fact, Katy Mixon is utterly hilarious and steels every scene she is in (the `Taboo' scene is the best in the film) and I had no idea WHO she was (although I know I've seen her before).

It's clich&eacute;d and poorly constructed and generic to tell you the truth, but it's funny, and sometimes that is all that matters.",1261958400,2,2025,4.7025495750708215

This is not an Oscar caliber movie at all but was an entertaining holiday family reunion comedy. Reese & Vaughn's chemistry was funny but seemed to be weak in the romance area. Only a mild spark came through the screen. They didn't seem to fit romantically real well but was not a serious flaw. Fit as good as some real life couples I know so not unrealistic.

Vince and the vomit scenes are just too funny. He does the manic goofball well here. Good cast executing a silly comedy in a respectable way. I like most all of Vaughn and Reese's work to date. There is more to these two than a lot of other Hollywood types.

This not a classic but still a cut above some of the junk coming out lately. Some story plots telegraphed but this is seems to be the norm too often, including big budget and acclaimed movies too. Hey movie makers we're not stupid and can handle a surprise! (Even been known to be able to follow a book) Light fun with good supporting cast.

The sexual references and the language is to be expected since it's rated PG13 and warns of  sexaul references/language the back cover of the movie. So of course it isn't appropriate for a young child. The studios never tried to disguise anything that's why the movie has a PG13 rating. Now in regards to the santa clause spoilers. The movie has its rating for a reason. If parents want to make sure its appropriate, check the ratings and or view the movie without the kids first. Then make your decision if you want them to watch it or not. Again don't blame the movie for being bad because of them saying Santa dosen't exist. In regard to them mocking christians. I'm a christian and I didn't feel insulted about the Mary/Joseph scence with Baby Jesus. They never said anything bad about Jesus or Mary/Joseph. They just made light of the situation to tell the Mary/Joseph story to the congregation. The movie wasn't terrible, you just have to understand the plot and humor in the storyline. Yes they show the somewhat bad sides of families, but that's how Vince and Kate's families are in this movie. Hence, they have avoided going to their families for christmas for a few years until they finally had no choice due to the facts they were caught on the news at the airport and there were flight delays. While it has some crude humor and shows the bad aspects of families; it only makes sense that it's this way in the movie. Because it would be boring and not funny if their families were sweet functional wonderful faimilies. In addition, it wouldn't match the premise behind the plot. They have avoided their families for the reasons you see in the movie. Overall, they avoid their families every year and lie to their them telling them they're helping kids in a third world country. When in fact they're treating themselves to tropical vactions in order to escape from their dreaded dysfunctional families.

I thought the story moved along at a nice pace and my favorite character is the one played by Robert Duvall. If you are on the fence about buying it and have not seen it I suggest picking it up from redbox first. The blu ray is the ""special edition"" and it includes a digital copy, which you can download until sometime around 11/24/2010. So if you are buying around this time you might need to pick it up before the digital copy code expires. Anyways, for less than 20 you get the blu ray and a digital copy.

The disc is BD-Live and there are currently very few features here. Most of the menu items say coming soon. My hope is that after enough people try and select these items the studio execs will see the numbers and get on the ball to keep fresh content there. Other special features on teh disc are the gag reel, deleted scenes, a behind the scenes, and a short movie with Paula Dean that is entertaining.",1261094400,,1072,4.203883495145631

The two main characters are live-in lovers who plan to spend Christmas in Fiji, as far away from family as possible.  When their flight is fogged in, they feel obligated to visit all four households in their fractured families.  The households could have been amusing, but instead they are tasteless and over-the-top.  Somehow projectile vomiting by a baby and wrestling matches between grown men did not seem amusing to me.

3519953,4,B001CTA1UM,"FOUR CHRISTMASES

When this film was first released in theaters I along with my girl, bro, mom, and aunt all went out in Austin to see it. Of course like I do when actually at the movies I completely enjoyed it and found it hilarious. So time went by and I waited for the DVD release that seemed to never come. Finally it arrived and of course I bought it and went on to watch it with every one again, this time instead of my mom coming down to Texas to visit us we were [are as of now] in Maryland to visit her. So this time joining all of us was my step dad, sister, and the grandparents. And like the first time I found it very funny as did the rest in the room.

Brad and Kate spend every holiday away from their families and go on vacations, giving the families ridiculous reasons why they are not there. That is until one year on Christmas the flights are all cancelled, two sets of parents each, Christmas here we come. From understanding parent to violent siblings that seem to want their downfall. Ex friends with parents and others who are very active in very weird ways [you'll see]. Brad and Kate have to battle the families and try to stay sane, and stay together, ""mistletoe"".

Watching it now I can see were some flaws are but over all this is a very enjoyable film that is really funny. Although as it goes along it becomes less funny and more serious with each family visited but it is still very good. Vince Vaughn is perfect for this film as his charisma and style really adds to the over flow of the film. Also his interaction with his family is hilarious, more so than Witherspoon's. Don't get me wrong because Reese does an excellent job on this film but her side of the story is the more dramatic side. Robert Duvall is great as Brad's hard feeling father and Sissy Spacek is great as the good natured mother. Brad's brothers played marvelously by Jon Favreau and country singer Tim McGraw are absolutely brilliant as MMA fighters.

Speaking of country singers Dwight Yoakam is excellent as well as the preacher who is wife Kate's mother played wonderfully by Mary Steenburgen. Jon Voight plays her father and is the sanest parent of the group. As matter of fact all of the family members in this film are brilliant, the whole cast is great to be honest. Director Seth Gordon did a good job with the film although it starts to lack as it goes along. That could of course been a script problem as far as story with the many writers on this.

Still I found this film to be very funny and very well acted so I really can't complain since most Christmas movies lately have not been up to par with past classics. Would I say this is a holiday classic, no, but it is still worth owning in my opinion. The film starts very funny and remains funny throughout but it does get dramatic half way through and towards the end. I would at least rent it and see what you think, I liked it.",1260662400,,2897,4.3082568807339445

Shockingly Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn are totally unappealing playing the worst kind of narcissistic yuppies imaginable.  Vaughn should avoid holiday fare after this dreck and ""Fred Claus"".  What saves this flick from the absolute nadir is the all-too-brief appearances of the aforementioned Duvall and Jon Voight.

This is a story of a commitment-phobe just-want-to-have-fun couple as the rules change and the reasons for the commitment phobias jump out and grab them by the throat. Sometimes literally.

The cast of characters playing small parts makes the movie fun to watch. The physical humor is hilarious in some spots. The awkwardness of getting caught in a few lies, meeting people who are twisted and a heartbeat away from becoming family, and much bizarre acting out make for some moments of squirm and dark comedy. Don't expect family friendly fare either. There are some awkward sexual comments.

There's not a lot of Christmas feel-good spirit in this one. But, if you are a Christmas romantic comedy collector, have a Red Box nearby or a free rental and are a fan of Vince Vaughn or Reese Witherspoon you might want to give it a shot.

In the first 3 minutes there are VERY sexual references, about 3 or 4 cuss words, and Reese and Vince went into the bathroom and it shows them kissing and her wrapping her legs around him and suggests some very innapropriate behavior. Also there are very innapropriate things like a six or seven year old boy streaking, a woman talking about the ""pains of breast feeding"", and a thirty or so man having an affair with like a 60 year old woman, who often talk about what they do in bed.

  This movie is awful. It lacks substance, acting, a believeable plot...well, ok, practically any plot. Why these two people whould ever get together in the first place makes no sense, because there is no chemistry between the two main characters, and that's BEFORE we meet these horrendous families.

Running a scant 89 minutes, it stars no less than five Oscar-winning actors in the standard cookie-cutter story of a commitment-phobic couple who are forced to visit each of their four divorced parents on Christmas day. Co-written by first-timers Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson, along with Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (who co-wrote&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover/dp/B001UV4XEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover</a>), the premise shows promise with Kate and Brad, a pair of self-satisfied, upwardly mobile San Franciscans meeting for what looks like the first time in a bar. Their sharp-tongued banter turns out to be a role-playing fantasy since they are three years into their comfortable relationship. A major fog blanket over the city ruins their plans for a holiday vacation in Fiji. What's worse is that they are caught by a local news camera at the airport. Because they deceived their families into thinking they were traveling overseas to help starving third-world children, they embark on a daylong journey to each of their parent's houses, all conveniently located in the Bay Area.

However, the movie starts to decline precipitously with each visit. The first home the couple drops by belongs to Brad's redneck father, where his other sons, cage-fighting brothers Denver and Dallas tackle Brad with painful wrestling moves. It ends with an uncomfortable gift exchange where Brad's expensive gifts humiliate his blue-collar family. The couple then visits Kate's overly affectionate mother and a den of cougars, an episode in which it is revealed Kate had a childhood weight problem and a possible lesbian past. Brad's therapist mother is next on the itinerary, but he's still angry that she married his best friend, who is half her age, and a game of Taboo reveals the communication gulf that really exists between Kate and Brad. The last stop is at the home of Kate's father, and this is where the tone gets serious-minded as the couple learns a lesson in the value of being with family in spite of whatever personal differences may exist to divide them the rest of the year.

Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon - he with his semi-improvised riffing, she with her exacting intelligence - would seem to be absurdly mismatched, but they spar convincingly, even if they do look more like best friends than lovers. Vaughn gets to shine in a Christmas pageant scene where he basks in the limelight of his ham-fisted stage debut. Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, Sissy Spacek, and Jon Voight play the parents with little screen time, and only Duvall leaves much of an impression as an embittered shell of a man. Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw, Carol Kane, and Kristin Chenoweth gamely play various relatives in equally smallish roles. The whole venture is directed by Seth Gordon, whose only previous feature-length credit is the critically praised video-game documentary,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-of-Kong-A-Fistful-of-Quarters/dp/B000XQ4HR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters</a>, and his storytelling inexperience shows in the sometimes ADD-level pacing of the story.

The story of a happily unmarried couple having to deal with the four Christmas/divorce visits during the holiday is timely, as even in my little store I have plenty of customers that have to do that very thing. As we follow them on their unplanned journey the laughs start right out but it tempers off into a spattering of schmaltz, sap and an overwhelming need to make it a baby story (although the alternate ending was better in staying away from this).

The Blu clarity shows some beautiful Bay Area skylines, but the CGI falters with all of the car driving interiors and fake fog at SFO. The sound was uneventful, but was clear enough to hear the edits and bad voice-overs in certain scenes. The supplements are what gives this 3.5-star film a little bump.

* 13:00 minute HBO First Look. Very clip heavy and the few remaining bits are average.
* 9:00 minutes of deleted scenes. Forgettable except for the alternate ending where they focus on the adults (in the future) instead of being about having a kid.

3519983,3,B001CTA1UM,"Resulting from a Fiji flight cancellation, Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) are forced to act out a Christmas tradition: visiting their families. Although Brad and Kate have been dating for three years (and are currently living together), neither one of them has met the other's parents. And for good reason.

Including Brad's mishap with a satellite dish, Kate's upsetting several babies and even an overly evangelical performance of the nativity, the four-stop tour to each of their divorced parents' houses is exaggerated to say the least.

In typical fashion, the parents are eager to share baby and childhood pictures with their child's significant other. This causes some complications for Brad and Kate when they each discover that neither one of them has been completely honest about their childhoods. Some of the epiphanies are more or less embarrassing than others, but ultimately the arguments drive away Brad and Kate's perfectly pre-rehearsed happiness during the first scene of ""Four Christmases.""

There is little chemistry between Vaughn and Witherspoon. This may have been intentional, to show the deterioration of their relationship. Nonetheless, Vaughn is guilty of his trademark outbursts of hilarity. Vaughn is the master of unknowing misunderstanding and resulting miscommunication. As in ""The Break Up,"" his and his cohabitating co-star's connection breaks down in the face of his never-ending, albeit hilarious, soliloquies.

Witherspoon plays a fairly comedic role as well, although Vaughn overshadows her (literally). Kate does, however, offer most of the substance of the movie, ruing past Christmases spent away from family and contemplating the future of Brad's and her relationship.

The all-star cast holds the film together. Brad's parents are played by Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek, while Kate's parents are played by Jon Voight and Mary Steenburgen. In a way, both fathers and both mothers play the same role. The mothers are very welcoming to their child's better half, while also being overtly sexually open and thus entertaining for audiences. The fathers, on the other hand, offer the most advice and life lessons, causing Brad and Kate to realize the importance of family.

The siblings are also worthy of mention. Brad's brothers, played by Tim McGraw and Jon Favreau, execute their cage fighting routine on Brad when he arrives to exchange gifts. Kate's sister, Kristin Chenoweth, brings out Kate's motherly tendencies while simultaneously embarrassing her with sisterly teasing. In his role as Pastor Phil (Dwight Yoakam), Kate's mother's boyfriend, is undoubtedly an amusement.

The couple's four Christmases are a lesson in the reality and difficulty of relationships. However, with a year-later scene tacked on the end, the viewer questions how much Brad and Kate actually learned from their previous holiday.",1253923200,22,2872,5.469525959367946

What's up with the delay? I hope the delay means the movie itself is doing awesome where ever it is still playing.  My daughter even liked the movie.  Ms. Witherspoon was good as well, but as usual Vince stole the show.  I  totally identified with the movie. Great comedy.",1252195200,,434,4.2073170731707314
3519985,4,B001CTA1UM,"I was not enthusiastic at first to see this movie, but was suprised that it actually was pretty funny. Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon play a couple of typical american couple that tries to hide their families from eachother...then the holidays hit.  Not quite an ""Old School"" or ""Wedding Crashers"", but this should get a few good chuckles for anybody.",1241395200,12,355,4.916666666666667
3519986,3,B001CTA1UM,"To the amazement of all their friends, two shallow, unencumbered lovers (Vaughn and Witherspoon), plan vacations every year instead of the agonizing experience of visiting their families.  They're opposed to the visits because each of their parents are divorced, and their families dysfunctional.  Appeasing their relatives through a barrage of excuses, they happily globetrot across the holidays away.  When at the airport for their trip to Fiji weather causes cancellation of their flight (ironic that their excuses ultimately get derailed by an industry known also for making excuses), the couple ends up on the evening news, and the web of deceit unravels.  Next up: four Christmas celebrations with four stereotypical families.

Family #1: Poorly trained, pot-bellied, hillbillies who practice mixed martial arts
Family #2: Religious fanatics who all but swing around live snakes
Family #3: Borderline incestuous hippies
Family #4: Repentant father and his unsubtle life lessons amidst a Norman Rockwell painting of life (queue the deep thoughts and life altering moments)

Vince Vaughn typically witty, delivering one-liners, quips, and soon-to-be additions to urbandictionary (i.e. pulling the goalie).  His performance at a religious revival with Family #2 was as funny as it was brave; challenging the church in any capacity is questionable at best.  Reese Witherspoon rehashes her role from Sweet Home Alabama, only this time she does it without the Alabama.

Ultimately, the hilarious in this movie is inversely relational to the sappy.  The light of humor dwindles amidst the sweeping night of Vaughn and Witherspoon realizing they are ""missing out"" by not having a family, and eventually decays into a feeble attempt at being touching.  The problem is that neither the comedy nor the drama takes hold, and this movie gets stuck in the purgatory that sometimes occurs in the rom-com world.  The various supporting roles are superb, with Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, and Jon Voigt to name a few.
