The development of this thriller is well done; it is a simple romance at first, and later it is gradually filled out with great suspense and shocking proceedings. It is about a young independent woman, Sarika (Urmila Matondkar), who falls for a young suave man, Karan (Saif Ali Khan) who is actually not the one he appears to be. Unexpectedly, her world is turned upside down when she finds herself jailed because of him. That's how the story of her hardening begins, when, toughened by prison life, she gets determined to take revenge. The film does not go to any unnecessary subplots or unnecessary melodrama, it is relatively short, it has no songs, and all these aspects contribute to the film's realism and suspense, which are also aided by its fantastic background score, well-written dialogues, brilliant editing and superb acting.",1300406400,,992,5.0920245398773005
