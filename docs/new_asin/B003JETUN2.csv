4129595,5,B003JETUN2,"I have all of the Zatoichi movies and I like them all. Some though are better than others. They are like the old cowboy westerns of the 50's good guy and bad guys, except in 1800's Japan, where Ichi fights the bad guys and wins. Good story lines and good acting.",1347926400,,262,4.1568627450980395
4129596,5,B003JETUN2,"Manipulation is the name of the game.  Zatoichi is, kind of, the victim of this piece as he is used both by a gang Boss and the villagers to do their bidding.  The feeling is both sides are, really, not very nice - frankly I found the farmers to be as backstabbing as the gangsters.  Also, the Blind Swordsman gives the impression that he knows this but is trapped between a rock and a hard place - he is the nice guy and has to try to do GOOD.
It is dark with some spots of humor, such as the very smart horse and the opening scene in the ship does gives it a nice change of pace from the opening scenes in taverns most of the films start with.  Overall a very well made if gritty movie.  Enjoy!",1308614400,3,696,3.9784172661870505
4129597,5,B003JETUN2,"I have all of the other Zatoichi films and most of the Japanese TV series DVDs that have been released in the US in my DVD collection. I have waited a long time for a release of Zatoichi #14, Zatoichi's Pilgramage. To my knowledge, this film has never been released in the US. This is an import DVD with English subtitles. I can confirm that it played on my XBox 360 with no problem. I'm no DVD conisseur, but I thought this was a fine DVD and I really enjoyed watching it.

As for the story, without giving too much away, Zatoichi has a spiritual crisis and longs to give up killing. He vows to go on a pilgramage to a series of temples until the gods give him answers to his questions. Before he even gets to the first temple, he winds up being forced to kill a man. He follows the man's horse to his home and there he finds the man's sister and yet another village suffering the depredations of an evil yakuza boss and his gang. The story goes on from there in typical and enjoyable Zatoichi fashion...

If you enjoyed other Zatoichi films, I would definitely recommend this one. Not sure why this movie hasn't been released in the US. There are rumors on the internet, but nothing that I saw confirmed. Regardless, I found this film just as enjoyable as the other Zatoichi films. If you are a Zatoichi film collector, you'll probably want to grab this before it disappears.

The DVD has no special features except a trailer for the film. The film is widescreen in Japanese language with English or Chinese subtitles. The English subtitles appear in white at the bottom of the film, but are removable, if you wish.

To whoever owns the rights to this film, I will gladly also buy a US release of this film if one becomes available (hopefully with more extras, like maybe an explanation why this film was unavailable for so long.)",1297382400,3,1832,4.427299703264095
4129598,5,B003JETUN2,"I bought this DVD from an Amazon Marketplace seller a while ago and finally got around to watching it. After doing so, I was so impressed that I wanted to write a review of it (my first review ever), to give an additional opinion to anyone who was still unsure of whether or not they should buy this.

I won't go into the plot of the film, as I'm only going to review this DVD release. The only thing I will say about the movie itself is that it didn't particularly strike me as really any noticeably better (or worse) than any of the others in the series. Some are better than others, but all are very enjoyable to some extent (and I've now seen all of them, except for the recent ""Ichi""). The only thing I would say is if you've never seen a Zatoichi film, then this MAY not be a good one to start with, although I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's definitively not. But then, I always prefer to start at the beginning and watch things in order, when possible.

As far as what this release is all about -- a little background first, if you don't already know, or haven't read through any of the other comments (skip ahead a paragraph if you're already familiar with all this):

Zatoichi is a long-running film series in Japan -- 27 films from 1962 to 2003. For US DVD release, Home Vision Entertainment (which is somehow connected to Criterion), obtained the rights to release around 2/3 of the movies -- mainly the earlier ones, and including the first 13. AnimEigo got the rights to most of the remainder -- mostly the later ones. Tokyo Shock got the rights to the (at the time) final film from 1989, and then Miramax released the 2003 film. But for some reason, ""Zatoichi's Pilgrimage"", the 14th film, was never released in the US by anyone. The story that I had always heard was that Miramax acquired the rights to ""Zatoichi's Pilgrimage"" a few years back when Quentin Tarantino was interested in remaking it. When the Weinsteins split with Miramax, all movie rights were split up between the two groups and it is uncertain who actually owns it now, or if they will ever decide to release it in the US (or if the license had possibly even expired). But someone stated in the comments to another review that they had first-hand knowledge that this is not true, and that the Japanese rights-holders never licensed it to anyone in the US. Which makes no sense at all to me -- but who knows? He may well be right. Hell, I've never understood why one company couldn't get the rights to ALL of them, but whatever...

So anyway, this DVD release of ""Zatoichi's Pilgrimage"" was released in Malaysia by Venus Video Enterprise. There has been some question as to whether this is actually a ""bootleg"" release. I don't know if it is or not for sure, but I'll say that if this IS a bootleg, it's the best one I have ever seen. It's NOT a DVD-R, both the disc and the cover are professionally printed, and it's in a cardboard slipcase which has some sort of hologram sticker on it. It has a barcode, and the address of the company on the back (although these could always be fake, I suppose). But I really don't think that this is actually a bootleg. My guess is that it was officially licensed for release in Malaysia, and was not intended to be sold anywhere else in the world -- but individuals are always going to buy stuff and re-sell it in other countries through the Amazon Marketplace, eBay, and elsewhere, whether they're actually supposed to or not. If you're worried about the legality of this DVD, my thinking is that you're TECHNICALLY not supposed to be able to buy this in the US -- but it's an individual buying from an individual (supposedly), and not the video company trying to circumvent it's licensing agreement. Even if there ever WAS to be any consequences to arise from this, I'm thinking it would all be to Venus for allowing it to be sold outside of where it was licensed to, and surely not to anyone who bought it. And in the grand scheme of things, who the hell really cares?

What's the actual quality of the DVD, you ask? Actually, the film looks VERY nice. It's been a while since I watched the others in the series, but I'd say from memory that this film looks at least about as good as the other releases. I don't know if there has been any restoration done on it, or if they just somehow got (or were provided with) a very pristine print -- but it looks great. I was just trying to enjoy it and wasn't watching it with a critical eye (as I didn't decide to write this review until afterwards) -- but I remember thinking how good it looked, and never noticed any scratches or any other problems with the image, as is sometimes the case with older movies (this is from 1966). I don't have a big expensive high-end home theater system, but I thought it looked great on my 26"" LCD television.

As far as the subtitles -- no worries there, either. I don't speak or understand Japanese, but they seemed to be excellent, as far as I could tell. I have seen plenty of Hong Kong movies over the years on officially released import DVDs from HK, and sometimes struggled to follow the story, as the subtitles were VERY poor on some of them. I don't know if this is still the case, but I had always heard in the past that HK films were required by law to have English subtitles, as they were at the time under British control, and I guess there were a lot of Brits in HK. It seemed as though some of the HK film companies put the bare minimum expense into the English subtitles, and it showed. There's no such problem here. Venus gets high marks from me for the subs. It may not be an exact literal translation, for all I know -- but it is clear (no ""Engrish""), easy to understand (no grammar issues), and I only noticed one minor typo in the whole film. Great effort from a Malaysian company translating Japanese to English!

There are no extras to speak of -- only the trailer for the film (unsubtitled -- and it automatically plays at the end of the movie). But I don't remember any of the US releases having anything more than that, either -- other than most of them having an insert sheet with liner notes.

Really, the only complaint I would have at all (and it's a VERY minor one) is that it is in a ""slimline"" case, and it's spine design doesn't match the others when placed next to them on the shelf -- but you could say that about the spine design for all of the non-HVE releases, as well. Suffice it to say, if you've seen any other Zatoichi movies and enjoyed them, then in my opinion you definitely should have no qualms at all about buying this one. Buy with confidence, I would say. The only regret I could even possibly imagine anyone having after buying this DVD is if it ever finally gets an official US release and they think ""If only I had waited..."". But honestly, if it does ever get a release here, I am so content with this release that I can't imagine I would replace this copy with the US release -- unless I were to find the US one for DIRT CHEAP...",1296345600,14,6995,4.3506891271056665
4129599,5,B003JETUN2,"Despite the release of the rest of the Zatoichi movies in the US, Zatoichi #14 has remained unavailable.  Apparently, the rights are owned by a US company that considered a remake at one point, so the companies that released the rest of the Zatoichi films and TV series were unable to acquire the rights to volume 14.

As others have noted, this is a nice copy of the film with good English subtitles.  The quality is comparable to all of the other recent DVD releases of Zatoichi films.

However, given the licensing problems and the fact that this volume comes with a price stamped in Malaysian Ringgit, I suspect this is not a legal copy.  Malaysia is well known as a country where DVD piracy is commonplace.  Or, perhaps the US rights to the film are not exclusive.

If the questionable provenance of this DVD doesn't bother you, it is a high quality copy of the film at a very good price.",1292112000,10,893,4.4753086419753085
4129600,5,B003JETUN2,I just wanted to point out that this version has excellent picture and audio (in Japanese) and great English subtitles. I'm very happy to add this to my collection.,1284940800,,164,4.689655172413793
4129601,5,B003JETUN2,"Shortly after the film gets under way, Zatoichi finds himself at a temple, questioning why he kills, whether those he kills are absolved of their evil, asks God that he not have to kill again, and sets off on a pilgrimage to the 88 shrines to learn the answers. Of course, he never gets there, finds himself in a village beset by bad guys, and ends up having to defend the village. Only this time, the villagers may not be worthy of his rescue. ""Those who willingly give up freedom for a bit of peace deserve neither freedom nor peace."" And, yes, the girl is very pretty in this movie, too.

The quality of this DVD is excellent. The image is slightly brighter than many films in this series, and colors very slightly softer, which very well suits the less gloomy tone of this movie. The bad guys are typical dirt bags, but the overall flavor is not as dark as many other films. Whether the pictorial quality results from the DVD mastering, or is the filmmakers intent, I don't know, but it works very well. The image is extremely clean, sound is excellent, subtitles have perfect English grammar with no typos, and are perfectly legible. Overall, as good as the HVE releases of the 17, if not even better.

The only extra is the trailer, which does not have subtitles. DVD comes in a thin clamshell inside a cardboard slipcase, no liner notes booklet. The hub holding the disk is very firm, so you'll need care in removing the disk, but it's not a big problem.

For those wondering whether to invest in an unknown label, rest assured that you will be very pleased with the quality of this DVD, and you may kick yourself for not picking up a copy of #14 should it become unavailable before a US edition is released (the DVD is from Johor, Malaysia).",1280534400,4,1749,4.459375
4129602,5,B003JETUN2,"The fourteenth Zatoichi movie- Zatoichi's Pilgrimage a.k.a. Zatoichi's Ocean Voyage has long been impossible to purchase on DVD.  The British DVD named Zatoichi's Pilgrimage was actually what we know as Zatoichi: The Outlaw.

This is one of the more enjoyable of the series, and I am glad to see it finally sold. The edit is a high quality one.
