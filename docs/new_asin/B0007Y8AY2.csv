8053923,4,B0007Y8AY2,"I give this the same comments that I give other dvds of this kind: This is not good for casual consumers of comedy. If you are looking for a good Friday night in comedy dvd, pass on this. Some may be interested to see what Chappelle was like before he made it big and depending on who you are, for the low price of this product, it may be worth it to you just to see Dave. Martin Lawrence is Martin Lawrence and Steve Harvey's set could have been good if he did drag out this one element of his joke sooooo long. If you're a collector, get this. If not, you should probably move on.",1380844800,,582,4.025862068965517
