8311781,1,B001J2XRLM,"I never write reviews, but this movie motivated me to do so.  It was so incredibly bad it is indescribable.  I was roped in by my local Redbox offering it as a new release, but almost all production aspects of this film point to a late 70's era film (in actality it's a 2004 release but you'd never know it).

Don't rent it, buy it, or in any way put yourself in a position where you might be forced to watch this ""film"".",1248566400,2,421,4.048192771084337
8311782,1,B001J2XRLM,I have never written a review in my life but this one motivated me to do it! One of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen. I missed parts of the movie because I was laughing so hard at the inconsistencies.,1241481600,,204,3.880952380952381
