8474963,4,B0002446AY,"Good film overall.  Strong art direction and well cast delivering solid acting with memorable visuals of Bombay India.

Story of Murder and deception.  Nasserudin and Kashmira Shah are great. Mystery is kept up till the end.

Decent plot twists.  A MUST SEE for introduction to early works of the cast.  Kashmira Shah's first film. Nasserudin delivers solid quirky performance of the detective.

Worth seeing and learning why Indian Indie film is becoming more popular.  There are no songs, this is NOT a Bollywood film but murder mystery.",1109635200,,539,5.114942528735632
