5133638,5,B0085MJJSY,"Another great movie in my humble opinion, again i love it when negative situations cause a person to do something good and positive>  Wonderful that he is continuing to work with the haitians",1354060800,4,191,4.787878787878788
5133639,2,B0085MJJSY,"It's a very short movie, for the price on how short it was, is not worth it. The shipment was quick, just not worth the price.",1348876800,,126,3.8846153846153846
5133640,5,B0085MJJSY,"I will be using this film as one tool in the box to prepare medical teams to travel to Haiti. I thought this was a pretty good depiction (without being too graphic) of showing the intense emotions, shock, PTSD, etc. that Haitians experienced after the earthquake, and it will be a good lead-in to discussion of how that is relevant today. I also liked how it showed the disrespect some people have with their cameras, and will be sure to point that out to our medical volunteers as we talk about respecting our fellow human beings and not just snapping photos without permission because they've never seen anything like it before. It's about 30 minutes long but gets those points across well.",1469836800,2,692,4.680327868852459

5133643,5,B0085MJJSY,"Interesting story, about how we sometimes put family on the back burner, and tend to those other's in need.
However, in doing so, we can lose those that really mean the most to us, and lay upon them, a lifetime of hurt
and rejection.  Good watch.",1464998400,,246,4.3478260869565215
5133644,4,B0085MJJSY,I like this movie very much . But I didn't like the ending . I am one of those satellites a happy ending ever after . That didn't happen here otherwise it is a very very good movie .,1463875200,,182,3.6923076923076925
5133645,4,B0085MJJSY,Worthwhile.,1462406400,,11,11.0
5133646,4,B0085MJJSY,"Good movie. It doesn't have a lot of plot, but it was poignant and moving without hitting you over the head with the message. It was over sooner than I expected, so even though it was mostly focused on two characters, it never got boring.",1460419200,,238,4.311111111111111
5133647,4,B0085MJJSY,"As a faith-based film Eyes to See benefits as a short work to engulf it with ample poignancy and emotional pay-off. Unlike many full-length and short feature faith-based movies, it wisely avoids forcing a religious message. Instead, writer-director David de Vos tells us of the experience of a news photographer on how he obtains another opportunity to warm his chilled relationship with his wife and young daughter. They are suffering from Ray's family man absence and his busy schedule catching sensational news footage including the 2010 Haitian earthquake. Ray's insensitivity extends from his household filming a grieving mother holding her dead son, not a thought of condolence in assisting his star reporter to achieve an ""Emmy"" award.
Usually, there is someone in a faith-based film who's delivering God's message to the principle character so that he or she will wake-up in their belief and confidence in the Almighty. Isn't hat the usual turn-off for perhaps many viewers, thus contributing to these films being a hard sell for general audiences except for the evangelical crowd?
A Haitian mother and school teacher could have easily been that prop to move the story along, de Vos have Marie reveal her personal faith and joy, gently watering Ray's hope for their survival. The two individuals' lives are in peril after they become trapped together in rubble resulting from the aftershocks. With his vision impaired Ray is pending on Maria's vision and heart for physical and mental endurance. She is willing to write a goodbye letter to his wife and read his daughter's report card that was folded and pocketed pulled out of Ray's dusty jacket.
Garcelle Beauvais gives a strong performance in another film missing a moral compass, And Then There Was You. She portrayed a scorned wife affected by a deceptive husband, later to become romantically involved with another man having a troubled marriage. We see movies have different objectives with the same actors crossing paths to participate in faith-based films without the requirement of being devout.
Because as other 'Christian' commercial products money is the bottom line if there are enough people willing to pay to see these movies like The War Room and Son of Man, or purchase the DVDs. Nonetheless, Beauvais reveals her remarkable talents as Marie nailing an authentic Haitian accent. Matthew Marsden is favorable as Ray, who finds himself encouraging Maria to remain hopeful.
I got to view this short half hour film for free thanks to Amazon, How unlikely I will purchase it in a DVD or by video streaming online. Not heavy handed religious Eyes to See is a well-produced film, individuals and families do have a choice whatever they wish to pay to see it.  However nowadays millions of persons can view scores of free, Bible-based movies and videos 24/7 on a major non-profit website at no cost. Would Marden, Beauvais, and their director be willing to engage in such productions, their artistic contributions freely offered? That answer might involve a basis of faith outside of people's pocketbooks.

5133650,5,B0085MJJSY,"Short but poignant account of how a drastic event can change lives.

Ray was a busy reporter who often put the chase of a award-winning story above his relationship with his wife Grace and daughter Mandy. In the midst of filming the Haiti disaster, Ray gets trapped under rubble with a Haitian woman he had been trying to rescue. Stuck there for days, temporarily blinded by the collapse, he has plenty of time to remember past mistakes and learn from his friend about hope for the future. The ending? Watch and see :)",1456272000,2,518,4.56989247311828
