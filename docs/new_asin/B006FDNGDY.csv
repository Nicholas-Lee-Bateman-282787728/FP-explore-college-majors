8496977,3,B006FDNGDY,"RICK DERRINGER-LIVE AT THE RITZ, NY (ROCK SPECTACULAR): This DVD release of the early eighties concert video ROCK SPECTACULAR features RICK DERRINGER, the diminutive sideman to the stars with a big axe to grind, which he certainly does on his two most recognizable hits, the bubblegum MCCOYS warhorse HANG ON SLOOPY and the lust-encrusted anthem ROCK AND ROLL HOOCHIE KOO. Adding to the noisy fun is a rowdy roster of guest stars, behind whom RICK and his band provides stellar support. MEAT LOAF concert vocalist KARLA DEVITO, looking every inch like BETTY BOOP come to life with her dark curls and kewpie doll eyes, trots out schlock-rocker IS THIS A COOL WORLD OR WHAT. RNB shouter SOUTHSIDE JOHNNY (almost unrecognizable without his trademark shade) puts his raspy spin on a smokin' HONEY HUSH, while TED NUGENT wango tangos his way through CHUCK BERRY's party-girl classic CAROL plus his own ornery ode to communicable disease CAT SCRATCH FEVER. Even TIM BOGERT and CARMINE APPICE, the rhythm section for everyone from VANILLA FUDGE to CACTUS turn up here; it seems the only musical maestros missing in action are RICK's old partners EDGAR and JOHNNY WINTER. No matter...with DERRINGER calling the shots, ROCK SPECTACULAR has little trouble hitting the bulls eye.
