8121820,5,B000FFJZ5Q,"I loved the movie

BUT:

1. It was advertised as a dvd and I received a video tape.

2. I ordered it as urgent, and it came about 2 months later, and I had to pay an enormous amount to get it ""urgent"".

3. The video tape from beginning to the end is damaged, I believe it can be the scanners at the airports...

8121821,5,B000FFJZ5Q,This is my favorite movie from when I was a child! I grew up wanting to be Tadpole and was very upset when my VHS of this movie stopped working. I was so excited to see it on DVD. The picture and quality is just as good as I expected it to be. If you love the ocean and fun family films this is definitely got you.,1468713600,,314,3.701492537313433

8121825,4,B000FFJZ5Q,"I saw this movie once when I was in grade school french class, we watched it in English...go figure. The movie stuck with me since then as at some point in our childhood there are a few films that you see as a child that stay with you, for me this has got to be one of the top three. The above review is dead on from what I can recall about the film. I highly recommend seeing this movie regarless of your age, it's one of those classic must sees! My only question is where oh where can i get this on DVD to add to my collection!?",1175731200,,530,3.871559633027523
8121826,5,B000FFJZ5Q,"This movie is the story of a gifted 12 year old girl named Daphne and her extraordinary relationship with some of the world's most spectacular undersea creatures, including Elvar the dolphin, her best friend in the world. Known to one and all as Tadpole, Daphne is as much at home in the water as she is on land. Because of her highly developed sence of hearing, she can hear the songs of the humpback whales that frequent her shores in summer and who seem to respond to the sounds of her flute. This is the story of an exceptionally sensttive young girl who knew how to sing with the whales and reach the heart of humanity. 90 minutes.",1174953600,,636,4.398305084745763
