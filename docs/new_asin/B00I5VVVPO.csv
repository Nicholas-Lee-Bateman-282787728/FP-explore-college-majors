8639516,3,B00I5VVVPO,"This is an interesting pair to have in my collection, but it was somewhat disappointing.  I did read the reviews first so I thought I had an idea of what it would be.  But it was strangely not what I expected.

The first movie (Altar of Lust) was ""mostly soft core"", which I was pleasantly surprised to discover meant that there is some footage that is explicit.  None of the intercourse is real, but there is plenty of stroking of genitals male and female, a bit of finger penetration, and explicit oral both ways.  Amusingly there is also a lot of fake footage where they aren't even trying to conceal it - angles that show genitals nowhere near each other, angles that show pretended finger insertion when the finger is only bent, angles that show mouth nowhere near vajayjay.  Angles where the top girl is in feigned ecstasy and the bottom girl seems to be bored, staring at the ceiling.  Still, I think it's interesting to have a movie that doesn't have the same standard in every scene, because it's so surprising and seemingly genuine when it gets more passionate... it somehow just feels more spontaneous and therefore more real and exciting.

Second movie (Angel on Fire) is fully hardcore - but unfortunately a lot of the performances are weak, and there is WAY too much editing chopping up the scenes into so many intercut angles that are each only shown for a second or two.  You really don't see enough to get into it, and few shots have both partners totally aroused.  If you so much as breathe on your fast forward button, the scene is over before you can blink.  Kind of frustrating.  I know film costs a lot of money, and I couldn't help thinking how little good hardcore footage they managed to capture for their trouble.  Yes I recognized some of the stars here, but wasn't blown away, just felt a brief flutter of arousal for the hot redhead with flawless milky skin, but then it was gone because wow, the scene is already over again.",1417737600,8,1954,4.548571428571429
8639517,4,B00I5VVVPO,"Shows all, but not kinky, good reproduction not a tease as many, but non-stop action ...though poor acting, as most of such films",1416528000,3,129,4.6521739130434785

8639519,3,B00I5VVVPO,"Oh well......1 out of 2 ain't bad. ""Angel On Fire""....with my girl Darby Lloyd Rains......saves the day here. This flick is a really nice slice of 70's pornography....from the story-line down to the bushy vagina's. Sex in Heaven.......""Angel On Fire"" provides some interesting concepts, to say the least. ""The Altar Of Lust""......on the other hand......is less ""Adult"" themed than late-night Cinemax.....and far less enjoyable.",1406678400,2,427,5.6875
8639520,5,B00I5VVVPO,"Porn is porn no matter what decade it's from. Although it's probably theorized that the older it is, the more ""story"" there might be to string the other segments together. With Roberta Findlay as director on these two films, I'd say that's where your bet means a little more.

""Alter of Lust"" isn't bad...and I probably got this disc more for historical significance that anything else.

Findlay herself provides the voice for Viveca, the main character, played by blonde and skinny ""Erotica Lantern""... I think Landers was her real name. Roberta's husband Michael, provides the voice of Viveca's therapist. You see when each of them are speaking, the camera is ON the other person. So you don't SEE the person who's speaking at the time. This enabled the Findlay's to dub each of their own voices to the characters.

The movie is a series of flashbacks as she describes to her therapist the details of her sexual encounters. Once a heterosexual, she finds that she's turned lesbian... and wonders what's wrong with her!!!

The therapist is played by Fred Lincoln who also starred in Wes Craven's first movie, ""Last House on the Left"" ... then went on to a long career in X-rated movies.

Long time adult star Harry Reems (before he got a mustache) is Viveca's boyfriend. The movie was made as the porn industry was teetering between soft and hardcore porn. So while most of the sex is simulated softcore, there are scenes which you'd normally only expect to see in a hardcore film. So, plan on a bit of both...which actually works. Be aware, NOBODY (outside of Findlay) uses their real name in the credits!

""Angel on Fire"" (which was re-titled from Angel Number 9) has more of a plot...and is 100% hardcore. It's about a womanizing boyfriend who's killed by a preoccupied driver on a Manhattan street. His body goes to heaven, where he's instructed by Angel #9 that in order to return to the living, he must assume the body of a woman, meet another jerk like himself, and realize what women must deal with when their boyfriend's are sexist idiots. The body he assumes is that of Darby Lloyd Rains. Jennifer Jordan is angel #9. Eric Edwards, another one of the old boys of porn, plays an angel too. The biggest star in the movie (as we'd know today) is Jamie Gillis! He ends up being the 'jerk' that our man-turned-woman meets and falls in love with.

It's not a bad story...and features several down `n dirty encounters between the leads. Again, this is hardcore, so there's nothing left to the imagination. What bothered me about the DVD presentation is that there are NO opening credits to ""Angel"". I can't believe there weren't any originally...but for some reason they're not there now. Other than that, it's a very good DVD transfer.

Both movies on the disc look good. The colors as well as the audio are as they should be. Sometimes the original film elements for these classics are in rough shape. But these must've been sourced from pretty clean negatives.

I would say if you appreciate 70's pornography, and would like to see a couple of future stars who's careers were just getting underway...PLUS own a movie made by the infamous Roberta Findlay...then go for it!! If nothing else, it's a piece of history!",1403136000,17,3221,4.7272727272727275
8639521,5,B00I5VVVPO,"This movie "" Altar of lust"" is worth a lot, very rare to find a movie like that. It is great turn on for both male and female. You can watch it with your wife or your girl friend, and both will enjoy watching It., beside it is hot with lots of frontal nudity for both male and female involved in sexual action, with close up camera to all body parts, and clean sexploitation. Also the picture is clear, like a brand new movie considering it was made in the seventies or the eighties, but it was remastered perfectly. I am  sure you will watch few times regardless if you are man or a woman.",1398902400,20,590,4.130434782608695
