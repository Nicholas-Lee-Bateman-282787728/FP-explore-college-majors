5049619,5,B0072GPQJK,"Being a new fan to the dirty pair franchise, this collection is just perfect to start off with.  The best features in this set are the audio options.  Not only does this set include the original Japanese Dubs with English subtitles, it includes the 1994 Streamline Pictures English Dub and the 2003 ADV Films English Dub.  The picture quality is another great thing about this DVD set; the picture is really sharp and crisp with little gain and film artifacts.  I'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan of dirty pair or is starting off with the series.",1362009600,2,551,4.5353535353535355
5049620,5,B0072GPQJK,"If you already own these movies, you may consider buying them again. I had purchased the OVA remasters a while ago and while I had already owned the ADV(Section23) thin pack, while that seems to make no sense in buying the same thing again, the video quality is by far much much better then when that set was originally released. The reason I mention this is because this set gets the same amazing treatment.

Project EDEN is considered by many the best feature out of the 3 in this set. While I already own Project EDEN already. This comes with both the ADV Films dub and the Streamline Pictures dub, as well as the original Japanese language. While I am not a huge fan of the other to features for this price and the much better quality, this release is a steal at this great price.
If you're a fan of the OVA and/or TV series this is a must buy.",1358467200,3,848,4.267080745341615
5049621,4,B0072GPQJK,"The Dirty Pair are back in this re-release of the 3 DP movies. Long seen as some of the first strong female characters in anime, the Dirty Pair has always been popular with fans of anime.

Their entire franchise has been re-released by the folks at RightStuf. Today though, we will look at the movie triple-pack.

Affair of Nolandia is the 1st movie. At first, the animation confused me. Kei and Yuri look more realistic than they do in any of the other movies or shows. It's a bit ironic that they look their absolute best in this movie(to me at least), but that this was before they went for the iconic cartoony look that we know the DP by today.  This movie is pretty odd for a DP movie, as they go more for the serious/sci-fi vibe than the action/comedy that we see from the DP. In a way though, this movie is just interesting to watch. The serious tone of this movie actually makes the movie more unpredictable, and i really liked it. The one problem to me though is that the movie ends rather quickly, and i wanted more. Still it is a good movie.

Project Eden is the true DP movie in my opinion. You get all the comedy, the action, and the awesome 80s music that the series is famous for. I highly recommend this movie, especially if you liked the TV series. Of the 3 movies i would say that this is the best, as they took the TV series formula and perfected it for the big screen.

Flight 005 Conspiracy was the last entry in the original Dirty Pair series. It's sad too as this movie was a real letdown to me. The movie is rather morbid, and the lack of comedy was a disappointment. This was the only movie that bored me, and the ending was really depressing. The downer ending also hurts worse when you realise that this was the last time the original DP were in an anime. It maybe best to watch this one first and then watch the other two, as the other two movies will leave you on a higher note.

Overall, The Flight movie was the only real negative in my opinion. Again, i say to watch it first, then watch the superior Nolandia and Eden movies. Overall you get a mixed-bag with 2 great movies and one weak movie.

If you ever wanted to watch the original Dirty Pair, then you can't go wrong with this little collection.",1355788800,,2233,4.264775413711584
5049622,5,B0072GPQJK,"This boxset is a remastered re-release of the Original Dirty Pair boxset but it contains superior video quality since all three features have been remastered from a new Japanese telecline print. Also included is the option between the classic Streamline dub that was previously exclusive only to VHS, the ADV dub or the original Japanese track.

Dirty Pair Nolandia is the first in chronological order, it was released in 1985 and was produced before the tv series and was considered the serious side to Dirty Pair. Since it's serious science fiction and fantasy, it's the most unique title in the franchise, it's also one of the best and has an almost mysterious, twilight zone feel to it. The character designs are also more realisitc and there's very little comedy in this episode. Alot of people rate this 55 minute OVA very highly and it really is a must see. Rating - A+

Dirty Pair Project Eden, also known as Dirty Pair The Movie, is also very science ficiton heavy from 1987. It's almost like Bubblegum Crisis meets Dirty Pair, there's much more comedy 80 minute movie as Kei and Yuri try to take on an evil, mad scientist called Dr Watts. The animation is outstanding and the colours are so vibrant, they jump of the screen, the music is really catchy too. Rating - A

Dirty Pair Flight Consipiracy, which was the last original Dirty Pair animated story ever, came out in 1990 and had mixed reactions. It once again went for a more serious story and feel, the mystery is really interesting but the lack of comedy will leave some fans bored. Running at 60 minutes, it's a good but also sad end to the DP franchise, it's not my favorite by any means. Rating - B+",1344124800,15,1670,4.597315436241611

Kei and Yuri are the Lovely Angels (or more disrespectfully, the Dirty Pair), a pair of ""trouble consultants"" working for a private corporation, the World Welfare Works Association (WWWA or 3WA), which helps member solar systems deal with planetary-scale problems by dispatching agents like them (for a small fee).  Depending on how you look at it, they are either the 3WA's best agents or their worst: because though they always solve the case, solving the case often involves collateral damage on a Biblical scale. It's worth noting that said damage is never technically their fault, but this is usually small comfort to the victims.

This collection consists of the three feature length Dirty Pair episodes: the first anime of all, the movie, and the last anime of all before the reset.  Chronologically that works out like this:  ""Affair of Nolandia"" from this set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Pair-The-Original-TV-Series-Part-1/dp/B00BY6XMKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Pair: The Original TV Series, Part 1</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Pair-The-Original-TV-Series-Part-2/dp/B00CJN84L8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Pair: The Original TV Series, Part 2</a>, ""Project Eden"" from this set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Pair-Original-OVA-Series-DVD-Collection/dp/B005S0STWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Pair: Original OVA Series DVD Collection</a>, ""Flight 005 Conspiracy"" from this set, and finally the reboot series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Pair-Flash-DVD-Collection/dp/B007Q0JK4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Pair Flash DVD Collection</a>.

Affair of Nolandia: Hired to find a missing girl, Kei and Yuri are also asked to look into a series of mysterious plane crashes occurring in the same place and uncover a wide ranging conspiracy.  Collateral damage?  One city, its entire population, and the land form it was erected upon.  Oh, well, a lack of survivors tends to cut down on the number of complaints if not the intensity.

Project Eden: After successfully breaking up a Vizorium smuggling ring (at the small cost of destroying an entire space station), Kei and Yuri are dispatched to Agerna, a planet rich in Vizorium, to investigate a case of monster attacks on a couple of Vizorium mining and processing plants and are forced by circumstances to cooperate with a thief that Kei finds attractive.  Collateral damage?  One space station exploded, two Vizorium test facilities monstered, one priceless bottle of wine consumed, one mad scientist's lair demolished, one mad scientist's evil plan accidentally unleashed, wreaking havoc.

Flight 005 Conspiracy:  Once again Kei and Yuri are asked to investigate two seemingly unrelated mysteries: the explosion of a commercial space liner with 310 passengers and crew aboard and the mysterious disappearance of a scientist and his family.  On the surface there appears to be no connection other than proximity but the 3WA central computer that (to Chief Gooley's despair) keeps selecting the Lovely Angels and clearing them of blame after each case says otherwise.  Collateral damage?  One shut down laboratory blown up, several air cars (one of them a VW in a nice bit of product placement) and one air truck shot to pieces, one hotel shot to pieces and set on fire, one mini helicopter shot to pieces, several space fighters blown up or shot down, a large number of bad guys shot, flying carded, or blown up, one experimental reactor sabotaged, one space station blown to fragments, two gallant allies lost.

Nozomi Entertainment and Right Stuf! deserve a lot of credit for doing a nearly perfect job of re-releasing an anime classic by marrying remastered video with both the Streamline and ADV English dubs along with the original Japanese audio and English subtitles as options, all at a reasonable price.

8508844,5,B0072GPQJK,"after watching the remastered set of this wonderful collection of the 3 movies of the dirty pair i have to say that this absolutly a worth while watching and owning this set for first timers and fans of this unique series .

in this 3 movie set you'll be joining the Dirt... ermmm Lovely Angels Kei and Yuri  WWWA TroCons on many challenging and very dangerous tasks and do there best on succeeding on there missions  , as well giving poor chief gooley the Kookoo's .

the movies are :-

Project Eden :
in the feature film which is still one of the best highlight of the DP series with the girls being tasked to stop a genius madman from conducting an experiment that can cause to the whole human race on planet Agerna , expect refreshing quality even so this remaster makes it more new and i think its the best out of the whole DP Remastered work , awesome soundtrack and the meat of this set overall .

Affair of Nolandia : probably the oldest of the DP showcase history but don't be fooled if your more into the original form of the Dirty pair franchise then that means you're prefer the light novel feel , pacing and mystery of the story and even the art style makes it look old school .

this OVA feature really takes it to the roots of how the DP started as novels and this case has both Kei & Yuri  investigating a very odd case to figure out the cause of a plan crash that involved a scientist with an important research been possibly murdered  , this case will really drive the girls crazy on which is real and which a mirage as they deal with an individual with extraordinary powers and test their limit .

been the oldest this remaster is surprisingly really well done as i noticed a good difference between this and the ADV release which i still own , it really looks fresh enough and i want to say BRAVO to team making this remastered work still good to watch .

Dirty Pair: Flight 005 Conspiracy :

MY favorite in this movie set still ever since i watched the ADV set in 2009 , this by far the most action - thrilling of the 3 movies as Kei & Yuri deal with 2 cases at once in regards to controversial incident of flight 005 in mid travel , you'll never see the girls getting there lives in danger more than this movie as they it seems that this case has more than meets the eye  , this refreshing work is also noticeable that the amount of work makes this remaster really clean and enjoying to watch .

really loved watching this new set and hope newcomers can have a go with this series and relive one the earliest girls with guns anime of all time

wish the series gets brought back again in this same format of Kei and yuri .",1442102400,,2643,4.216269841269841
8508845,4,B0072GPQJK,"The second OVA special featuring the ""Lovely Angels"" was this 1990 one-shot done as sort of a farewell to the original Dirty Pair as it was the last anime done(so far)featuring the non-Flash version of the mid-90s. This was handled through Sunrise, and directed by Toshifumi Takizawa who also worked on the original TV series, so this was treated with more care than the previous Affair On Nolandia OVA.

Kei and Yuri are assigned to look for a space liner that exploded, but was suspected to have been targeted by nefarious forces because a scientist and his family were on board. They go from one government rep to another, but realize that the scientist along with his wife and daughter were kidnapped by a rival planet's government to develop a new energy source for them. The Dirty Pair ally with Dick, the scientist's father-in-law, and storm the bad guys' secret space base, ending in a battle right out of Star Wars, which would make for a decent ""Dirty Pair vs. The Empire"" fandub.

The animation for this got an upgrade since the 10-episode OVA series. This has been released three times, once on dubbed VHS through Streamline Pictures which was one of the first Dirty Pair anime released in the States, then again on DVD through ADV Films with an all new dub, and then recently through Right Stuf which includes both English dubs. It's probably worth getting the Right Stuf version titled Dirty Pair: Features to experience the full fandom fun if you're really interested in it.",1432339200,,1489,4.767441860465116
