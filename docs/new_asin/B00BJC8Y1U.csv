5635025,5,B00BJC8Y1U,"I love this movie [night game]& have been waiting years for this to be released DVD & it comes with another movie. I think Night Game is one of Roy Scheider's most underrated movies. If you like some of his other movies like Blue Thunder , 52 pickup & Still of the night , then you will like Night Game.",1385683200,,303,4.066666666666666
5635026,3,B00BJC8Y1U,Neither of these movies is very well made. Night Game is a decent suspense film. Released to cinema's at the beginning of the Serial Killer thriller craze this film doesn't stand up to its contemporaries. Terror at London Bridge is a fun 1980s TV movie. It has a lot of camp/kitsch value mostly courtesy of The Hoff. It manages to build up some suspense and atmosphere and is a pretty looking show.,1378339200,2,398,4.541666666666667
5635027,4,B00BJC8Y1U,"I ordered this DVD and it arrived ahead of schedule and in very secure packaging.  I had not seen ""Night Game"" but really liked ""Terror at London Bridge"".  I was pleased that both were pretty good.  Not Awards quality, but good enough to give me a scare.  Thanks for making this available, because I think I saw the ""Terror at London Bridge"" first on TV, so am happy to have it now on DVD. Thanks",1373500800,4,396,4.24
5635028,5,B00BJC8Y1U,a good two pack dvd set and at a good price too,1425859200,,47,3.0

I did not care for London bridge",1409788800,,70,3.4375
5635030,3,B00BJC8Y1U,"First off, I understand that if someone remembers Terror at London Bridge from its original airing in the 1980s then, okay, they might have a certain fondness/nostalgia factor there.  But aside from that, oh boy, is this movie laughably bad.  The acting is cartoonishly over the top.  Just watch for when the Ripper first appears, he literally lifts his cape across his face like Bela Lugosi's double out of Plan 9.  And then there's David Hasselhoff... he's trying way, way too hard.  The ""dramatic"" back story behind Hasselhoff's cop character is a laughably bad attempt at angst... and a total cliche.

The directing -- i.e. staging of the shots, camera placement, etc., is clunky and amateurish.  The ""House of Horrors"" set is just an everyday novelty shop with the cheapest Halloween masks you've ever seen.  The examples go on an on.  This is truly the Plan Nine from Outerspace of the 1980s.  (Though, yes, to be fair it was a made-for-TV movie so that might explain a few things.)

Night Game on the other hand is a decent attempt at a real film.  It has real production values, quality actors, etc.  They could have put a little more effort into the climax of the film, but still it's not bad.  For the record the story behind the film is this:  It was produced/financed by millionaires in Houston, Texas... so that's why it's missing some of the truly spectacular action moments you might see in a Hollywood film backed by a billion dollar studio.  Overall a quality movie though.",1406246400,,1490,4.717054263565892

5635032,5,B00BJC8Y1U,"I first saw this 'made for t.v. movie' when i was 9/10 yrs old and was hooked straight away, and they never aired it again to my dismay, luckily i taped it at the time VHS-style until it was lost in the sands of time. The hoff was more or less finishing the final series of 'knightrider' around that time and the excellent 'adrienne barbeau'-'the fog' and 'stephanie kramer'-'hunter-tv series' (remember that?) are all in this. It's a great blend of t.v. A-listers that would pop up in all-sorts from that time that was a crowd drawer for you're aunties...Before i knew it had recently been released on dvd, i stumbled upon it on youtube thanks to someone in the same mind-set whom i salute for doing so cos, not only did it bring back great child-hood memories, but i had a great time remembering some of the scenes word for word. If you like a story-line of 'jack the ripper' being chased by the local bobbies, then occultedly frozen in the ether of time in victorian london via a stone on london-bridge, then through a blood sacrifice being ressurected exactly 100yrs later in arizona (where stone-by-stone the bridge was rebuilt in 1971), then tries to go on the rampage again 'only he didn't count on the hoff as a burn't out cop trying to confront his own demons' getting in his way trying to convince the authorities to closed the victorian-style theme-park down...only they think he's a cooke! (bit like in jaws). Anyone over 35 will love and remember this 'finally available on dvd T.V. movie classic'!!!!....",1401408000,2,1518,4.667910447761194
5635033,5,B00BJC8Y1U,Finally this great little known movie is now available on DVD...I wish there were several more that would use the same format.,1400716800,,126,4.7727272727272725

8569576,5,B00BJC8Y1U,I like both of these film. Night Game is a very good film with Roy Scheider. It keeps you guessing. Terror at the Bridge was a nice surprise. It mixes a mystery with a nice bit of sci do. Hasselhoff does a nice job because he plays it low key. Good popcorn movies.,1514851200,,264,4.0
8569577,4,B00BJC8Y1U,"TERROR AT LONDON BRIDGE (also known as A BRIDGE ACROSS TIME) is the darling to the duo.  It is structured more like a mystery than a horror film, but is actually both.  NIGHT GAME is also enjoyable and is strictly a mystery.",1500249600,,224,4.309523809523809
8569578,5,B00BJC8Y1U,"I had seen Terror at London Bridge before when it was called Bridge Across Time, but I had forgotten how good it really was.
Good actors and a great plot. One of my favorites. The Night Game I had not seen before and it was excellent. A real edge of
your seat movie. Very happy with these movies and the price.",1489968000,,310,4.098360655737705
8569579,5,B00BJC8Y1U,I got this for the terror at London bridge movie. I remembered it from long ago and it's almost impossible to find. It's still a B movie but it's exactly what is advertised.,1464912000,,173,4.2727272727272725
8569580,5,B00BJC8Y1U,Something fun and campy (not too scary) to share with my granddaughter after just taking her to visit the London Bridge in Lake Havasu City.  Lol,1462233600,,145,4.576923076923077

8569584,4,B00BJC8Y1U,"I bought this only for Terror at London Bridge so I will only be reviewing that film.  Very good mid-80's made-for-TV (Cable?) movie, reminiscent of the TV films of a decade earlier.  After the original London Bridge is completely erected at Havasu Falls, Arizona strange murders start occurring.  Turns out Jack the Ripper's spirit was encased in the bridge and when a woman accidentally cuts herself on it, voila.  At times kind of spooky, especially the London tourist village at night.  Still it made me want to visit it (in the daytime).  I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  The DVD is excellent quality.  Highly Recommended.",1431820800,3,627,4.961538461538462
8569585,5,B00BJC8Y1U,"Two rare cheesy slasher films saved from obscurity, courtesy of the DVD format, worth the purchase and a watch if only to remember that a thriller/horror movie do not need extreme gore to be entertaining.

Hope more similar cult titles will be released to be enjoyed and preserved.",1429401600,,281,4.854166666666667
