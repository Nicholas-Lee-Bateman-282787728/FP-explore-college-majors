1107836,5,6305895562,I found Pups on HBO one night when I was channel surfing through my satellite guide. At first I didn't want to watch it then I really did. I turned it on and I loved the movie. When they rob the bank I realize how much guts Stevie has. I'm surprised that Rocky went along with it to. The movie was great and is now my 2nd favorite movie. I cried at the ending because it's so sad and romantic. I hope you like the movie as much as I did!!,1027209600,2,438,3.8241758241758244
1107837,5,6305895562,"This is a cool movie, Mischa Barton as Rocky is great and her boyfriend Stevie is alright.  This is just one of those movies that just kickass.  You'll enjoy it if you've seen Mischa's movies Lost and Delirious and Lawn Dogs as well as her small part in Tart.
The ending has a small suprise if you pay close attention to the beggining. There's also some great hostages my favorite was Joy who decided to smoke a joint while being held hostage",1026259200,2,442,4.378048780487805
1107838,5,6305895562,"this move is about a bank robbery, its not planned. two kids just feel like doing this. then it all slowly comes togeather and the thrill from this movie will leave you amazed at the storys whole plot. the ending was bad but there probably were beter ones",1025654400,,255,4.333333333333333
1107839,1,6305895562,"This is part of the reason good movies are hard to come by. Why bother trying to create a film with plot and character development when you can produce garbage like this without even trying? A couple of kids find guns and see a bank.
""Hey, let's rob that bank.""
""Okay.""
Wow, riveting stuff, Hemingway.
Whoever thinks that this produces an honest insight into the youth of America is partially correct; The average American kid is as dumb as a post and Ash proves it here. Bravo. Just because dereanged kids occasionally shoot up schools and people doesn't mean that's the status quo for every pre-pubescent child in this country. Don't mistake bad writing for ""realism."" Also, to those who say it's there for shock value, they're right, I'm shocked I sat through it.
And yes, you can complain about the legnth of a film if it as bad as this one. Every excrutiating minute of this 103-minute pile feels like sheer torture. In order to simulate the Pups experience, gather a couple friends around and scream the F-word at each other for roughly an hour and a half and you've almost performed 80% of the film!
Thank god at least one of the kids gets what he deserves, I think you know what I mean. What I hated more was the Kurt Loder footage at the end, desperately trying to make it seem like this movie was trying to say something. Nice try, all that was accomplished was showing that stupid kids could lift firearms and scream.
Avoid this movie unless you're into that whole ""pain is pleasure"" thing.
One other question, why does Stevie have a New York accent and Rocky sounds half like a Valley girl?",1008460800,3,1602,4.546712802768166
1107840,4,6305895562,"Many critic's took an extra amount of their time to view Pup's, and most of them liked it.
Two kids decide to hold up a bank. No specific reason, just because it's there. The boy, Stevie, is the leader of the two. He whips his dad's pistol out of his backpack and barges into the bank forcing everyone to the floor. Rocky, his girlfriend, remain's hesitant at first, but is soon enjoying a pleasure that she had never experienced: being on television. It may seem horrible that a film about youngster's holding up a bank even exist's, but Ash has directed a lyrical justice needing to be seen.
You must understand why the movie was made at all; to shock and baffle. In a time where children are shooting down school hall's and killing their parent's, Ash's film gave me a new insight to the kid's point of view. What flow's through the strained mind of a child that doesn't care if he blows away a security guard? Rocky is very disturbed, and at the same time very innocent.
Burt Reynold's shows up on the scene amidst a swarm of cops as the nagotiator. He blast's hateful word's out at Rocky and Stevie so fast that his tongue and lips can barely support the cigarette hanging from his mouth. His problem's range from the bank - to home. (His wife call's him every 15 second's and he blast's her too.)
Some have said that Pup's was too long. How silly is that!
Another problem that someone complained about, was the fact that the hostages could have ""taken out"" the kids by snapping their neck. The person that said that didn't understand the relationship quickly developed between the kids and those held captive by them.",1003708800,4,1623,4.523809523809524
1107841,5,6305895562,"A daring project, an honest look at kids and violence in America.  The director is brilliant!",990230400,3,93,4.8125
1107842,5,6305895562,"In the past twelve years are so, there has appeared a spate of good movies  that proved to be a minor revolution of sorts. In effect, they dragged that  frustratingly enigmatic 10 to 15 year-old age group out of the Pollyanna  era of easy stereotyping and presented the youngsters dwelling there as  real, sentient human beings. Not only did they present youthful characters  who were quite human in their thoughts, drives, ambitions, decisions, and  dialog, but they were cast with youthful actors of real substance, who  could stand up with the best of adults in the profession. ""Emma's  Shadow"", ""Leon"", ""Bastard Out of Carolina"",  ""Ellen Foster"", ""The Mighty"", ""The Cure"",  ""Lawn Dogs"", ""Digging to China"", and  ""Tumbleweeds"" are a few such daring offerings. Unfortunately,  most of these pictures, being independents, made-for-tv productions, or  controversial in content, received little public recognition or theatrical  exposure.
""Pups"" follows the pattern in three ways. The two  middle-school aged kids in this movie certainly have to be taken seriously.  Sure they acted impulsively and irresponsibly; kids who would decide on the  spur of the moment to rob a bank are not acting responsibly. Adults have  been known to choose as bad or worse actions, and for even less reason.  Obviously, there were situations in Stevie's life that seemed to lead him  in that dangerous direction. And obviously, even before he found his  mother's gun, you were given to know that on this particular day Stevie was  a disaster looking for a place to happen. And even though Rocky joined him  in his dangerous acts because of her attachment to him, you were given to  know she did so reluctantly (girls have been known to do that kind of thing  in the adult world too). That she would get caught up in the thrill of the  adventure and power of it all is quite human as well, which made the  situation the scarier since it seemed she might represent the only hope for  a rational resolution. FBI agent Daniel Bender (Burt Reynolds) grew to be  quite concerned for Stevie and Rocky as kids, and he struggled desperately  to keep them from getting hurt; but he didn't seem to know how to relate to  them as thinking and feeling humans.
""Pups"" also follows the  trend of those other revolutionary movies by getting very little public  exposure. Real-life tragedy interceded too dramatically.
Finally,  ""Pups"" follows the pattern by casting in the roles of Stevie and  Rocky two young actors of consummate skill. Cameron Van Hoy is remarkable  in his first major role, and Mischa Barton adds another great performance  to her already impressive acting history (check out her stunning reading of  the role of the complex Devon in ""Lawn Dogs"").
This is as  powerful a movie as you'll ever see, possibly too powerful for some. But if  for no other reason, I recommend you see ""Pups"" for the  excitement of watching a pair of outstanding young actors in action.",965001600,9,2947,4.920570264765784

7899298,3,6305895562,"I bought this movie because I saw it years and years ago on HBO and randomly found it as I was searching the web recently. I remember it being a very intense, interesting story. However, as I watch it again ten years later, I don't have the same feelings about it. Reynolds does a great performance, but everyone else doesn't make the story believable. Mischa Barton's acting is downright terrible. It's an okay movie, but I probably won't watch it again, nor would I recommend it to my friends.",1452124800,,495,4.573033707865169

7899302,5,6305895562,Its just about 2 kids getting into trouble. These kids are witty and some parts are funny. I would recommend this movie to people i know. I bought it as a gift to my Husband.,1328227200,,174,4.0
7899303,4,6305895562,"when I was twelve, flipping though the channels I stumbled upon PUPs though I didn't know what it was called then. I knew I really liked the movie and was bummed I never knew what it was called or who it was with, imagine my surpise when I found out it was with Misha Barton who is an talented actress. Then About a month ago I remembered A movie where two teens who robbed a bank and who kept me interested til the very end; I wrote the storyline of the movie and I found it. I can't believe it took me 12 years to remember but im glad I did. I would suggest it to everyone to watch it. Minors watch with parantal advision but adults though its teens it is amazing and keeps you guessing, The only I didn't like was the ending but overall my all time fave movie.",1286150400,,763,4.026315789473684
7899304,5,6305895562,"A great movie.

It's not about a bank robery you retards!

Ho hum...just watch it.",1128211200,,82,4.4
7899305,4,6305895562,"Pups is an entertaining and what i found thrilling movie. Newcomer Cameron Van Hoy does an excellent job as the very troubled Stevie, who has been left at home by his mother who is at a seminar (?) somewhere. When he stumbles upon his mothers loaded gun he brings his girlfriend Rocky (Mischa Barton) on a crazy ride. On impulse Stevie walks into a bank and starts waving the gun around. Soon we have a hostage situation and there are cops buzzing around everywhere. Burt Reynolds does a fine job as the reasoning FBI agent. This movie is not a classic but it does have some very good moments/scenes and overall it definatly isn't bad. The constant screaming of Stevie gets a little tedious but all adds to the effect of the panic one would be feeling in such a situation. I think Mischa Barton is great in this movie, Im a huge fan of hers. The ending is sad and my mouth dropped open in shock, call me an idiot but i wasn't expecting that! Rent this movie if you're bored one day, it makes for fine viewing.",1101081600,2,1009,4.343915343915344
7899306,1,6305895562,"I was 14 years old when I saw this movie, and it was about the same age as the two main characters. Basically what it's about is two kids rob a bank wow very exciting. ''Stevie'' finds a hand gun and with his girlfriend Rocky they rob a bank. The two 13 year olds go into a bank with a hand gun and force everyone to the floor and so on, nothing new you've seen it all before. What gets to me about this movie is that all they had to do was tackle this kid and take the gun away. The acting (stunk) and I can't believe Burt would do this movie. Now this movie is great....for laughs. They try and be dramatic but it's really a comendy to me. The ending was so cheezy they tried to make it a tear-jerker and it worked I cried! I cried because I was laughing so hard. This should be the voted the worst movie of all time but at the same time it should be voted the FUNNIEST movie of all time!",1029974400,,890,3.8956043956043955
