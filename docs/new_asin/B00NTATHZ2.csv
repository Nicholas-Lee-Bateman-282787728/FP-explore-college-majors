6679792,5,B00NTATHZ2,"Nowadays, if you want to see an original comedy, you have to go the Indie route! The studio films are all formula, meaning if you've seen one, you've pretty much seen them all. This is very refreshing!",1424131200,,201,4.45945945945946

6679800,4,B00NTATHZ2,"A highly creative, 'Scott Pilgrim-esque' office basic comedy... on a budget! Which is no bad thing and the filmmakers use highly creative methods to showcase their unique vision, animation and... erm, ninjas!! For the many of us that have to stare at a screen for hours on end and who's mind tends to wander. Great stuff.",1456876800,2,321,4.75

6679805,3,B00NTATHZ2,"I enjoyed this low budget, part-time movie maker guys' movie. A talented group of film nerds who seem to be having a great time creating this movie.  And very cool was the graphic novel type strips made special for this movie.

I'll forgive the Ninja and Kung Fu speak.  The Japanese Ninja and the Chinese Kung Fu... never the twain should meet.",1445472000,,345,4.532258064516129

6679809,5,B00NTATHZ2,"I wasn't so sure about this one, but am glad I did watch it.  Obviously NOT an expensively made movie, it more than makes up for it by it's humor and substory (animated).  The animated part somewhat coincides with the real life story line.

They even add a bit to the credits that is not usually seen in end-movie credits, as well as a few add-on funny lines to actual required statements.",1431734400,,389,4.375

6679814,4,B00NTATHZ2,"When I heard about Office Ninja from writer and director Bin Lee, I needed to at least find out what it was! He was kind enough to send a review copy. We laughed so much! This is such a geek movie, y'all.

Here's the setup. Tomas (Jade Carter) is a programmer whose bow-tied boss is still using an overhead projector with those plastic sheets to run meetings. His co-worker Jett (Robb Padgett) is a jerk who steals Tomas's work and gets promoted to a position Tomas really wanted and kind of needs, considering his dad has just been seriously ill and there are bills to pay.

So clearly, the only way to resolve this is dress up like a ninja and run around his office spying on Jett, right? Tomas's goofball co-worker Raheem (Jose Rosete) and new hire Jessica (Jessica Mills) aren't sure what to think of the appearance of an office ninja... and neither is Tomas once he encounters another ninja. What?!

I have a special place in my heart for any creative project that people clearly work on from a place of love. This is one of those projects. The cast is obviously having such a good time with this preposterous story, especially the folks playing the more exaggerated characters. The look of glee on Todd Johnson's face as his boss character clicks back and forth on his new digital projector is priceless. Also, an impressive amount of action and physical comedy is crammed into the very small physical setting of a set of cubes and offices and the hallways between them! (One tackle in particular caught me completely off-guard and it was so funny because I was so surprised.)

One small fly in the ointment for me was Tomas and Raheem's continued sexual harassment of Jessica. Raheem's behavior towards Jessica is almost as bad as Jett's, and yet the film mostly gives him a pass because he's one of the Good Guys. Tomas isn't innocent either but we're supposed to see it as ""he likes her."" We wished they'd figured out another angle for the comedy they were going for.

This isn't a polished big-budget Hollywood comedy where every line is perfectly written... wait, big Hollywood movies aren't perfect either. But it's a bunch of fun, talented people getting together to make something entertaining. Especially if you're steeped in geek humor already.",1427241600,,2260,4.711392405063291
