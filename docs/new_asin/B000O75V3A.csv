1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit it, I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway.)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: WNTW eventually stopped making over guys, and I get it ... mostly women watched the show, and they couldn't identify as much with the guys so those eps didn't get the ratings. That said, there's a lot for anybody to like here. Ken is a good ol' boy from Texas, a biker who doesn't want to look like your basic khakis-and-polos kind of guy at work, but his appearance is extremely sloppy and is hindering career advancement. Enter stylish S and C for what is an intense ambush because for a few seconds it doesn't seem like Ken is too thrilled. But he accepts and this actually very likable guy's exchanges with the dynamic duo in New York are hilarious. I especially loved the incredulousness in his voice when he wonders why he has to ""dress up"" to go to the local buffet. But it gets better, as Ken is sporting a braid halfway down his back that makes for the most fascinating hair/no makeup session of all time. Carmindy does some pre-trimming on Ken before Nick chops the tail and gives him a nice style, and her accurate but tough-to-hear comments are cutting Ken to the quick. But he mans up and hangs in there, and he cleaned up incredibly nicely. The reactions from Stacy, Ken's wife, and his kid are proof of that and are priceless. Overall, I'd rate this ep a classic.
3) Oh yeah, the cost ... $19.95 per ep? WTF! I'm a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Nope.",1456358400,,2081,4.270886075949367
