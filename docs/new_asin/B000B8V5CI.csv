8083693,1,B000B8V5CI,"This was a movie that was excrutiating to watch.  The acting was bad, the script too wordy and meandering, the action too restrained, the spfx too low-budget, and the titilation factor was nil.

Firstly, this was played straight, so there is none of the campiness and fun that were there in BLACK SCORPION, BATMAN with Adam West, or in WONDER WOMAN with Linda Carter.  So, we've already a strike against it.

Secondly, you could tell that it was written by someone used to writing a comic book, as everything, right down to the soliloquys were detailed and consequently dragged scenes out that should have sped by.

Thirdly, the creator chose a non-linear narrative, so in the middle of the adventure there is this prolonged flashback sequence providing the origin of the title character, and by the time you get back to the main narrative, the viewer has all but forgotten what the original story was.

All in all, this makes Roger Corman's BLACK SCORPION movies and series play like Shakespeare, and this isn't a good thing.

My Final Rating:  Blech (Wow, OK, Eh, Sigh, Blech)",1138665600,3,1078,4.789189189189189
