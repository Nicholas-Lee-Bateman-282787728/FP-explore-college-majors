8645384,5,B00ITN5RYE,"This concert from 1995 offers an interesting programme which is excellently played and marks a clear improvement over the previous DVD format. One of the interesting things about the early issues in this series starting from 1991 is the very rapid improvement in the recording technology achieved within a space of very few years.

This particular disc is a marked improvement over the 1994 concert  from a recording point of view and both are significantly better than the 1991 and 1992 concerts, both of which offer content of interest even if the recording quality is more compromised. The imaging of this concert is therefore crisp and well defined even on the longer shots. The format is 16.9 and the sound is presented in a very satisfactory stereo only option. The quality of the sound, where the temptation to create a false sub-woofer channel has been resisted, suggests that the venue (Palazzo Vecchio Florence) is a responsive recording venue.

Mehta is on good form throughout and inspires a satisfyingly energetic response to the music from the players. This is immediately apparent in the opening Fidelio overture which is crisply delivered. This is followed by Boris Blacher's Orchestral Variations on a theme by Paganini. This is a composition from 1947 which, although complex in construction, does not contain anything too difficult for an audience to follow on such a celebratory occasion. Owners of the previous DVD version will have had time to assimilate the piece and that will be an additional advantage.

Sarah Chang, at the tender age of just 14, then performs the first movement of the Paganini first violin concerto with utter assurance, technical infallibility at brisk tempi and with that winning smile that regularly accompanies her playing - very much as if she is enjoying particular musical moments with especial pleasure. This results in enormous enthusiasm and many recalls to the platform from the packed audience.

There follows an incisive performance of Stravinsky's complete Petrushka which is well able to withstand comparison with many established recorded performances but with the added interest and frisson of being 'live' and the concert concludes with a very 'live' and lively performance of Dvorak's 8th Slavonic Dance, a particular Mehta favourite (also to be found at the conclusion of his Los Angeles Blu-ray recorded in 1977).

The disc also includes a 19 minute documentary which was originally played during the interval of the concert. it is a particularly well-thought out construction starting with an interview with Sarah Chang and covering her musical life up to 1995. It then focusses on Florence and a wealth of artistic ventures covering all artistic disciplines, then connections with families such as the Medici family and their contributions to artistic life, then theatres then an interview with Mehta before finally returning to the concert venue in time for the second part of the concert. This documentary is tracked separately for the Blu-ray.

I would suggest that this disc would make an excellent early sample from this series for collectors interested in highlight concerts from the series. Other collectors will be interested in the whole set which will eventually be issued as Blu-rays. This particular Blu-ray is particularly interesting and rewarding and well-worth considering for purchase.",1398729600,,3370,5.264432029795159
