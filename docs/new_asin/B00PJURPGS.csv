6809117,4,B00PJURPGS,"Not bad,  went in with low expectations, but it was pretty damn good. Would have like to see the headliners a bit more, but the scenes they were in rocked. I thought it had a good mix, action, humor, and suspense!",1423008000,2,213,4.195121951219512
6809118,5,B00PJURPGS,"OK, I am not one to be drawn to this particular genre however, I Really enjoyed this film!  I was not expecting the good acting, the intense drama on top of the hunor, the surprises, and the cinematography, especially considering it was all filmed in a van!  Wow!  So great!  Crazy Stuff!  This is a Cult Classic about to ""come out""!",1423008000,5,333,4.39344262295082
6809119,1,B00PJURPGS,"I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. This movie is so bad it makes ""Sharknado 2: The Second One"" look like an award-winning feature. The story is not good and the acting is even worse. The film looks like it was shot with a cam-phone. ""The Bunnyman Massacre"" looked like it had more of a budget. And this is like the 20th movie I've seen that Danny Trejo gets top billing and he's in it for about 3 minutes tops. Tony Todd also has top billing and he's in it for a little less time. After running across this on IMDB and reading the plot, it sounded like a grindhouse sleaze-fest. Well, there is some blood spilled here and there but that doesn't make up for all the problems I had watching this atrocity. The creator of this should have taken the morning after pill at first thought of this in hopes that it didn't grow into something that was going to ruin their life. I love watching awesomely bad movies but this is just horrendous.
Plot: Two half brothers kidnap this girl (whom one of the brothers was friends with on Facebook...no joke) after their father disappears 3 months earlier with a suspicion that the kidnapped girl's father is the one responsible after finding an inscribed ring in the missing father's van. An old war buddy tags along as the getaway driver while thinking this is a ransom kidnapping and he needs his cut of the ransom to feed his heroin addiction because he suffers from PTSD and is prone to blackout and go into psychopathic rages. Still with me? Well, come to find out about midway through the movie is the kidnapped girl's mother also went missing 3 months prior. Apparently, her mother and the kidnapper's father had hooked up after she left her husband because he is the head of a Mexican drug cartel (who is played by...guess who?) and then when the true intentions of this kidnapping are revealed to all (that there was never any intent on ransom - only revenge) then everyone starts turning on everyone at this point. Oh, yea, 98% of this movie is shot in the van on the way to the desert to meet up with the kidnapped girl's father.
Some problems: I've mentioned the acting, and bad camera work, Facebook friends, and the top billing discretion. Some of the fight scenes looked like the film was sped up a bit. There was a part in the film where the kidnapped girl tried to open the van's sliding door, only to be told the door can only be opened from the outside, however, they had stopped at one point and the gun-toting kidnapper who has the girl in the back gets out of the van via that same door...then later needs to get out again and asks the guy up front to let him out. There's also a small side plot where one of the kidnapper's girlfriend is kicking him out of her place so in the middle of this kidnapping event they stop over there so he can get his stuff. Plus, its a van with untinted windows all around, yet no one can see this tied up girl and a guy waving a gun around in the back. Then ***spoiler alert*** at the big gun battle at the end, there's about 6 hit men with machine guns, yet, they are acting like the van is as big as a house when they open up the doors to secure the area. Just shoot it up from the outside, gentlemen. Oh, and earlier in the film they had stopped at a motel for the night and 2 of Machete's hit men had broke in to get a name off of the registration when suddenly there's one of the kidnapper's in the back and shoots them in the head - blood splatters on the dash and windshield then suddenly - ta-daaaaa - the blood is gone.
Even the couple of songs used in the film were god-awful along with insipid dialogue that makes Rob Zombie's dialogue sound Shakespearean. There was nothing good about this film. Danny Trejo and Tony Todd both looked bored in their cameos. And yea, there's a bunch of other mistakes and huh? moments I could mention but why bother. If I could give negative stars I would.

6809140,1,B00PJURPGS,"It shouldn't be this hard to make a reasonably fast-paced, yet intelligent, action flick - but beginning with the bad pun in the title, this movie slogs along, delivering uneven performances and predictable plot twists while simultaneously insulting your intelligence. Apparently van seats can repel all manner of bullets and getting stabbed multiple times with a screwdriver is a mere flesh wound. Save your time and money, just watch the trailer - that's about all that's worth seeing.",1442793600,,487,5.256410256410256
6809141,4,B00PJURPGS,"Two half brothers and an accomplice decide to hold hostage a drug kingpins daughter for ransom and from there things go terribly wrong. This movie is filled with many twists and turns and tons of violence and was surprisingly despite the fact that the 3 leads are basically unknown to many. It was compared to Tarantino in many reviews and it does have a  dash of him in the characters and the backstories, but as the movie goes along the characters stand on their own.
It really ran smoothly and fast paced, nice action and some good gore with a def trust no one feel.  Highly recommend!",1435795200,4,588,4.485981308411215

6809145,2,B00PJURPGS,"Two things you need to know, this is not a Danny Trejo movie and this is not worth owning. This is probably closest to these modern day so called horror flicks; no plot, no acting, just lots of gore. This story is very close to the DVD named, ""The Entitled"" starring Kevin Zegers and Ray Liotta. The acting in this one is terrible, the stupidity of the script is even worse. You will not believe the inability to successfully kill somebody who has either cut, shot, or stabbed you first. The only reason to watch this once is for the twist in the storyline. The point where this movie starts to where it ends you would never have guessed all of that in a million years. But obviously once you see it, then it won't be worth watching again. Oh by the way, Danny Trejo spent less time in this film than it took you to read my review.",1430524800,,831,4.232704402515723

6809147,4,B00PJURPGS,"Some vets conspire to kidnap Emma (Maiara Walsh) the daughter of a drug cartel leader (Danny Trejo). Jack (Austin Abke) is the level headed leader of the group. Max (Bryan Bockbrader) is dangerously out of control. Shane (Adam Guthrie) is a bit of a dullard. Emma informs us right off she hasn't spoken to her dad in years and doubts he will pay the $5 million ransom.

About 40 minutes into the film we get hit with the first twist which continues through ""true confession time."" Danny Trejo and Tony Todd had minor screen time. The kill scenes were overly bloody which made me laugh at the blood squirts as we have an extended shootout between guys about 5 feet apart aka ""Police Squad.""  Decent grindhouse.

6809155,4,B00PJURPGS,"""A kidnapping, a road trip, a machete, and buckets of blood, bring a fun, twisted tale of gore, and oh yeah, a gun battle shoot out with the Mexican Drug Cartel. This all adds up to perfected mayhem.""

A deep woven tale of violence that does not hide, that it's a tale of violence. Dumbest criminals, yet violent dumbest criminals. They work there amateur style of kidnapping, but yet, a true reality of violent actions.  This is an interesting tale in that, what social media can lead to, if you don't watch out. Max, Jack and Shane decide to kidnap a girl named Emma and hold her for ransom. Her Daddy Carlos is contacted for 5 million. What the dumbest criminals don't know, or at least some of them, is who her daddy is.

I hope everybody who made this earned a buck because it seemed like they had fun making it. It wasn't pretentious and never tried to present itself as an award winner, or an ""achievement"". The acting was only as good as it needed to be, as though the actors new not to over (or under) do it.",1510272000,,557,4.365384615384615
