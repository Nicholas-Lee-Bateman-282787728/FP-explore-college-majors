8239805,4,B00111L0II,"This is an outlandish price for this DVD.  Almost all of these episodes are available in low HD on Hulu, and I imagine it will only be a matter of time before the second season is available as well.  There are HD versions of these episodes out there so don't be fooled by over priced VHS copies from the T.V. transferred to DVD, likely in someones garage on a computer, like this one.  This set gets a one star from me on quality.  That said, this  is a good show if you like good old fashioned t.v., with a trucker theme that can be watched with the whole family.  I actually watched this series as a child on t.v. when it first aired, and over 35 years later it still holds my attention and a place in my heart.  Very few other shows from my childhood can make that claim, other than maybe the original Battlestar Galactica, which is available on high quality DVD as well.",1382832000,,874,4.228915662650603
8239806,1,B00111L0II,The quality of these DVDs is extremely poor. Image is dirty and color is faded. Sound hisses and pops like old records. Visit HULU for re-mastered quality viewing experience.,1353024000,3,174,5.0344827586206895
8239807,5,B00111L0II,"My rating is for the show; and not for the DVD.
There is a mystery here that is unexplained.  Movin' On was a show lasting approximately 2 seasons.  Around 40+ episodes.  I have seen approximately half of those episodes.  So I can account that there are good, clean prints of Claude Atkins' trucking adventures.
The only reason I know this, is because I had a television network carried by my cable company: RTV.
They were clean and pretty darn good for a 1970's show that know one knew existed, unless you are a trucker movie fan; or happened across it by accident, like I did.
The sound is a little rough in spots; but this is because the entire show was filmed on location and not on sets.  To the best of my estimation, they did not film at all on sets.  I'm eyeballing it; but every place appeared as though it was a real place.  If the script called for Sonny Pruit to go to the shopping store, they filmed in a store.  A bank: a real bank.  I could be wrong; but there seemed to be no indoor studio shooting--based upon the look and sound of the tapes.  When filming not on a set, the picture or show has a certain feel.  And there appears to be little dubbing--except for the closing sequences when the boys are driving away and you hear their voices but do not see their faces.
This show appeared to be as authentic as you could get.  Claude Atkins is even shown unhooking his cab from a storage unit so they can dump it into the harbour.  An episode where someone planted a bomb on the truck.
Research went into it.  Atkins lists the fees they were charged to even drive on roads in Oregon.  No wonder food prices have been on the rise for decades.  Oregon is now getting around to doing this to everyone.
An entertaining show placing the lads in danger; and just showing their vagabond lifestyle as independent truckers trying to earn a very hard to make ends meet living.
The prints are out there; and in good shape.  Universal made the show, I believe.  I wouldn't pay 90 dollars for this set.  Maybe one day they shall come out with an official product.
My station switched from RTV to another classic network, so I wasn't able to finish the series.  Too bad.
John Dehner, Jeanette Nolan, Sheree North; and a cast of what looked like normal people trying to act normally in front of a camera, populate this highly unusual series.

8239808,3,B00111L0II,"If you MUST re-live 1974-76, these are the real deal.  The quality of the series is fine, the quality of the dvd ranges from good to poor. Pretty steep price for average to poor video quality.  Still, viewing these brought out several smiles and I revisited the mid 70's...",1317686400,10,273,4.551020408163265
8239809,3,B00111L0II,"this is a good old  TV show about real men, trucking down the highway of the great USA, but the video is poor, its very dark and grainy. on one of the discs it skips, needs to be digitally remastered by the pro's. only 8 shows for $90 bucks, not worth the money. These shows must be the originals from forty years ago. I would have sent it back but, but thought it may be worth someing down the road. These are a disappointment.",1285113600,14,428,4.095238095238095
8239810,3,B00111L0II,"There was a time when the shows on TV weren't full of vulgar langauge, extreme sexual overtones, heavy violence, and all the stuff that in my opinion continues to ""dumb"" down our society.
  There was a thing called ""action adventure"" that was actually OK to sit down and watch with your kids without having to explain things to them you had hoped you'd be doing at a much later age, Movin 'On was one of those shows, the storyline revolved around the everyday adventures of 2 gypsy truck drivers ""Sonny"" and ""Will"" played by Claude Akins and Frank Converse.
 Together the two traveled across America, simply just trying to make a buck and stay ahead of the game, there was always some type of mischief or mayhem right around the corner, and the shows usually had some type of positive message somewhere along the way.
  To watch these DVD's from Truckerflicks was a nice flashback to the early 70's when Semi Trucks and CB Radios ruled the airwaves.
  The set I watched was The Best of Movin On Vol 1-8, an 8 disc DVD set, the first disc had the original pilot movie, and the other 7 discs each have 2 episodes each, I was hesitant to order it originally as the set is a bit pricey but I was pleased in the end, this however is not for the ""digitally restored aficionado"" because there isn't any.
 Disc playback was decent, there apparently was no type of digital restoration done, just raw transfers from 16mm film, the colors were fairly decent and according to Truckerflicks web site they spent a lot of time restoring the color back to many episodes, in some cases it had almost completely gone Red and had to be corrected to be presentable, there are a few times when you can tell there is a bit of Red tint in certain spots but then it corrects itself and the color comes back.
 The audio is dual channel Mono and always seemed to be good and clear but at times was a bit scratchy which one would have to assume was because of the poor state of the original film prints.
 Overall I was still satisfied in the end as I had been looking for this show for 30+ years to relive some of my childhood memories of watching TV with my Dad so it didn't really matter to me at all... I was in heaven the entire time.
 Truckerflicks also has another set available Best of Movin On Volumes 9-17 and has recently put out Volumes 18, 19, 20 & 21 so if you pick up this set and want more there's still more out there if you can find them... for some reason they aren't listed on Amazon.. at least not yet, i'd check with the seller you got your original set from (that's what I did) or get them from Truckerflicks themselves, from what I read there are some stores in the mid-west and in the south that stock them.. mainly CB Shops and Independent Truck Stops.... and remember..
