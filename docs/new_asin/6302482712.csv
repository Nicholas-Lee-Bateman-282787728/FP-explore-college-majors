477565,4,6302482712,"Sean Connery plays a recluse doctor who discovers the cure for cancer,  while working in a rainforest, among a tribe of natives.  The dialogue is  engaging and often witty.  The plot is engrossing.  Connery's character is  thoroughly likeable and understandable.  The setting is lush and wonderous.  Even the natives' muddled English is translated for you in subtitles.  It's an easily watchable film.  And, listen to the great soundtrack, the  music is intense and vibrant.  It's a gem of a movie.  I've watched it  twenty times, so far.",955929600,2,538,5.0344827586206895
477566,4,6302482712,"We saw this movie in the theatres, purchased the VHS video, and are now purchasing the DVD.  Sean Connery is a favorite actor of mine and I enjoyed the jungle setting, interesting storyline, and interaction between the two  main characters.
Could it have been done better?  Yes.
Does that  prevent me from liking this movie?  Absolutely not.",955411200,4,341,4.912280701754386
477567,5,6302482712,"I could watch this movie everyday for the rest of my life and still be drawn in by it.  Not only is there the Sean Connery factor, but the scenic shots are amazing.  It shows the beauty of the rainforest, and how easily  that beauty can be destroyed.  Connery and Bracco are excellent.  They get  the point across and still keep it all believable.  The story line is  great, it shows just how simple things can be if we allow them.",914889600,2,431,4.234567901234568

When a woman shows up, he acts huffy and says he is sending her back and will let the director know.  She says the Director retired 3 years ago and she is now the Director.

I have an unquenchable urge to taste some nasty 90% caffeine pain reliever, and then almost fall off the world, and giggle about it. It is both refreshing, and scary to see the things that are happening in the last great rain forrest of South America. Sean Connery makes you want that cigarette, and I don't smoke. I'm afraid of what moves in the daytime in the jungle, but at night, nahh take someone else. Casting of this womman in the co-lead was a great choice. They aren't a symphony. They are gentle pleasing Latin classic Guitara or flamenco.

478784,5,6302482712,"OK, this is probably a silly movie. A scientist moves to the jungle to mend a broken heart, finds a cure for cancer, loses it (this is not a spoiler, it's just the set up--the real movie is what comes after) and then goes on a search for it again. Silly right?

But hey, this is Sean Connery we're talking about and he pulls it off--this guy is one fine and enjoyable actor! And the setting is beautiful and mysterious. And, oddly enough, there is a background of real science going on here: the loss of the rainforest canopy, the mass destruction of plants and creatures that probably could save our species. And there is a love story.

All-in-all, a really enjoyable Saturday night movie with a little bit of everything: adventure, science, love, excitement, nature.  I love it and watch it about twice a year just for fun. Oh, and the female lead is the same actress that plays the shrink in the Sopranos! But in the end, it's that Connery fella, wow, what a great actor.",1430611200,,974,4.46067415730337

478874,5,6302482712,"This movie did not get the recognition it deserved.  The story is a far leap from 007's usual, and he is remarkable in the lead role.  Lorraine Bracco is outstanding as the female lead.  The chemistry of the two well known actors is fiery, and the plot of the vehicle is great.  Without giving too much away I will say it is a story that I personally wish were true.  Sean Connery has found the cure for cancer in a remote jungle and then loses it, enter Lorraine Bracco who brings him the necessary lab tools from the US he requested.  The two race to try and duplicate Connery's original formula while trying to fight time, and a new road that is threatening to destroy the area where the 'ingredient' for the cure is.  It does have some humorous moments, and drop dead scenery.  Even the music was excellent.  The natives make up the rest of the cast.  If you are a fan of Sean Connery this one is a must see.  There is no sex, mild violence, some nudity (on the natives part), and very minimal cursing.  I'd rate it as a PG13 flick.",1426118400,4,1036,4.256410256410256

479026,4,6302482712,"Dr. Robert Campbell is obnoxious and at first seems self-centered and self-righteous, but it turns out that is not so. Well maybe the self-righteous aspect is at least partly true, just a little different variation of self-righteous than the first impression. He is trying to atone for his past and at the same time he is hiding from the past, both in the jungle and in the bottle. He also found a rapid cure for cancer, unfortunately he is unable to reproduce the cure and does not know why.

Dr. Rae Crane has arrived in response to Dr. Campbell's request for new equipment and an assistant. She is poorly trained for field work in the jungle but has the power to discontinue Dr. Campbell's funding by the pharmaceutical company which has been financing his work. And it is almost an understatement to say her first impression of Dr. Campbell is unfavorable.

Dr. Campbell's one working batch of the anticancer serum was made while he was experimenting with a flower which grows only in the top of the very tall trees in a very small area of the jungle. A construction crew is building a road which will go through the area where the flower grows and will destroy the habitat for the flower when they move through. When Dr. Campbell and Dr. Crane tell the supervisor of the construction crew about the flower and the cure for cancer he does not believe them nor does he really care.

I have read that there is a romance between Dr. Campbell and Dr. Crane but that is not really true, it is more that they gradually development of mutual respect for each other. There are strong hints at the end that a romance might be developing, but the actual romance would have been in a sequel if there had been one.

The scenery shots form the top of the trees, and a few other places are great. The movie does have a lot of tribal nudity, the natives (including women and children) all wear a small loin cloth which covers only the genitals. Bare backsides and bare breasts are exposed. The overall tone of the movie is light even with the heavy subjects of cancer and deforestation, there are even a few very humorous scenes.

I enjoyed the movie.",1412380800,,2140,4.51937984496124

He is visited by the sponsoring company's lady technician who has come to see Sean to see if he is still worth having as a staff member and to find out what he is working on.  The base motive of the movie is that he has discovered a cure for cancer but cannot recreate it.  He works with the research assistant, the local native Medicine Man and others to recreate the ingredients.  Meanwhile, private industry is forging through the site of the story building a new road.  Just as Sean discovers that the cure is due to extracts from a rare bunch of ants who live in very hard to find flowers, the company loses control of a fire being caused by the road building and burns out the ants and plants.

479166,5,6302482712,"Connery and Brocco are well matched in this film, although Brocco flubs a few of her lines early on in the film.  The premise and message are sound, and as a Naturopathic Doctor myself, I am in the center of the process.  I like in particular, the fact that Connery is allowed to be unapologetically male in the film-something of importance in our increasingly feminized male population.

I watch this over and over, because it is a contextual relief, not embedded in American culture, only referred to as a distant reality.  It reminds us too that we, as well as other cultures, can live in homeostatis, essentially disease-free, using local herbs and plants that target more specifically, and don't have the side effects of petrochemically-based precriptions.  This is something we did for thousands of years, before 'well meaning' Christians sought to save the world, concomittently making off with all the gold and resources, and leaving behind disease, as well as forcing the people to speak a different langugage.  Too, there's the ominous tone of the encroachment and final engulgment and destruction brought my modern man, clearly driven home in the last segment of the film.

A harbinger of things to come if we keep our current pace.  That's the final message. I recommend this film to everyone.",1393718400,3,1305,4.981566820276497

The story is fun, adventurous, and leaves you wanting more.",1389744000,,352,4.515625

479200,1,6302482712,Unfortunately the age of the dvd is such that it is a widescreen format made to be used with the old 4x3 tv's. This isn't a common problem with most dvd but anyone that has a large collection of dvd's that date back to the older format has probably ran into this before. What happens is that the picture gets stretched to fit the 16x9 and you end up with a very distorted picture. I am VERY unhappy that Amazon is selling what is basically an unusable old version of the DVD. I would think that there would be a compatible version of the movie available by now and Amazon should be aware if the issue. This is one of my wifes favorite movie and the dvd was a gift for her. Extremely displeased with this purchase.....is the an option for zero stars???,1389139200,,751,4.258741258741258

With Sean Connery (total stud) and Lorraine Bracco (a girl ANY guy could talk to), it's really hard to go wrong.  Their chemistry is volatile and hilarious.  Their message about the rain forest is clearly demonstrated without preaching.  And the Amazon (sic) cinematography is superb.  And, oh, did I mention it's just a damn good movie?",1387843200,,406,4.728571428571429

Something no one else has mentioned (well, I haven't read all 183 reviews!), is the incredible sound track:  the music is absolutely stunning, beautiful & captivating!

479479,4,6302482712,"Sean is one of my hero's of all time and this is one of his best films from his late career comeback.  I mean to say that in the 1960's as Bond he was on top of the world but in his later years his film choices were spoty.  I wish he would have stayed the course more like Clint Eastwood and chosen the larger than life role's that he is perfect for.
Anyway this is really good and he has good chemistry with Ms. Bracco.
My reason for not giving this a 5 star rating is the DVD needs to be updated for todays big screens hi def quality and aspect ratio.
I have a Panasonic Blu Ray 3D player and a 2012 Sharp 60in 1080p monitor and unless I change the aspect ratio on my player to zoom, the wide screen image has black bars top, bottom and both sides which obviously makes the image too small.  I have few other older DVD's that do the same thing.
You can tell the photography in this is very good and needs to be put on Blu Ray like Red October with commentary etc.
I won't spoil the plot but we need to protect the rainforest if we want to discover more secrets that the planet has to offer.

I bought this movie years ago when it first came out and now, in 2012, I still love it!

First, I am not an Environmental Wacko.  I am, however, a Sean Connery Big-Time Serious Fan and a lover of plants.
Second, this is a very good movie!  I did NOT particularly like Bracco's performance but Mr. Connery carried the movie anyway.  It was overall a very delightful movie.  As a parent with young children, I would probably still allow my children to see this show even though it shows scantily clad and topless natives.  However, having lived in a tropical country for a brief time as a teen, those things did not bother me at all.  It was simply a part of life. But that should be a consideration for a parent to make for their own family. (You are still able to teach your children about the correct dress in their own Country.)

The story was interesting, most of the acting was very good, the music was great & if you like tropical scenery, this show is for you!

The movie fades in and out, the focus is off many times, it even jumps in two places, you cannot see anything when there are fog shots, super grainy in all dark shots (many), and the artifacts are downright distracting.

Honestly, the VHS is of better quality.

Do NOT WASTE your TIME or MONEY on this fantastic movie until they re-master it for Blu-Ray.

479598,1,6302482712,"I might have liked this movie more had a different actress played opposite Sean Connery's snippy Dr. Robert Campbell.  Unfortunately, they cast a strident Lorraine Bracco as a rather nasty biochemist, Dr. Rae Crane, sent to evaluate Dr. Campbell's research (she more or less decides to end his funding before she even meets the doctor).  These two people are contentious from the outset and remain so for most of the film (105 minutes of this is a bit much to take).  He's argumentative and sour, she's unrelentingly shrill.  It seemed absolutely pointless to have this unending bickering as it totally eclipsed the story: a supposed cure for cancer (and the ecological matter of the shrinking rainforest was half heartedly tossed in for good measure).  This was less about plot and more about the relationship between these two malcontents.  That they decided this was a ""romance"" at the very last second was laughable.  A lack of weapons was the only thing that kept them from killing each other.

I wasn't surprised to learn that Lorraine Bracco's performance earned her a Razzie Award nomination for worst actress.

It features an intruiging storyline with a great hook (the cure for cancer), luscious exteriors and two likable leads in the perenial Sean Connery and the earthy Lorraine Bracco. Ok, so a lot of critics harpoon Lorraine's NY twang but for me that adds to the tension as she ""finds herself"" in the jungle with Sean's able assistance.

Then there's the local indigenous community, great ensemble work and a decent message about the consequences of screwing up Mother Nature.

Even if all that's not your cuppa, it's a good, interesting film, not brilliant, but enjoyable and a must have in my library. Something you pull out once a year , settle back and bask in for a couple of hours.

If all that doesnt' tweak you interest, Sean's brilliant as ever and he's worth a look anytime.

Something which could be said of a number of projects Connery has tried to save, even ""Never Say Never Again"". It was, after all, directed by John McTiernan off the back of ""Die Hard"" and it does have a healthy patina of high production values about it. The concept is typical of Connery choices : something interesting - a cure for cancer in remote jungles being decimated before research can find salvarion - that nobody else had wanted to tackle and which offered originality in a copycat industry. The hair style is Connery's best choice till ""Red October"", the scenery (especially swinging in full control through jungle canopies), the support of a well-pre-Sopranos Braco, the contributions of native actors, untapped ideas and locations : this one is worth a look or a re-assessment.

As an example, just recently the venom of the Gila Monster, Heloderma suspectum, has been found to be of great use in treating Type One adult diabetes and possibly some cancers.  We as a race, are just scratching the surface of what these remarkable flora and fauna have to offer the human race and this movie depicts the same and the risks of the loss of it all, due to greed and ignorance.

A bit about the plot...Lorraine Bracco is a scientist sent to check up on Sean Connery who has been working there for years but they haven't heard of any progress, but has requested more equipment. But Lorraine was not his first request for an assistant.  Little by little Connery and the natives win her over as they work on a promising cure for cancer.

Without giving away plot details, I'll simply say this movie is filled with beautiful scenes, and wonderful characters for whom you actually care.

479781,3,6302482712,"The movie, Medicine Man, revolves around a scientist named Dr. Robert Campbell and his research assistant Dr. Pat Crane.  Crane travels to the Amazon rain forest to be Campbell's requested assistant, but she surprises Campbell because he did not expect a woman and thus treated her in a condescending manner.  After a while, he begins to get accustomed to her, and they both work on his search to find a cure for cancer.  Campbell tells Crane that his first experimental serum, made from the flowers of the juju plant, was able to successfully cure the cancerous lumps in an Indian woman's neck and made him the medicine man.  But when he tried to recreate the serum using the same ingredients, it did not work again.  Campbell and Crane continue his research, and they begin the cure race when the previous Indian woman's son develops cancerous lumps in his neck too.  They try to find the original medicine man in order to question him about his knowledge of the juju plant, but they abandon their plan after their encounter with an Indian from a different region.  One day, Crane is testing more samples of the flower when Campbell discovers that specific ants from the rain forest actually are the key ingredients to making the serum work.  He and Crane quickly run to their usual location to gather more ants, but they encounter the road construction workers who beat up Campbell for trying to stop their construction work.  The workers make a fire which burns out of control and spreads to destroy the entire region of the rain forest.  The movie ends with Crane and Campbell following the Indians to their new settlement by the river to continue their search for the crucial ants.

 I thought that this movie was okay, but not great because I did not like the way Lorraine Bracco chose to play Dr. Pat Crane.  Crane is supposed to be a very accomplished and experienced scientist, but she is always yelling and gets easily upset.  There are times when she is silently touched by Campbell's interactions with the native children and his sketches, but these scenes do not last very long and soon, she begins to get upset again.  However, I really enjoyed Sean Connery's performance and portrayal of a soft-hearted man with more bark than bite.  The scenery is also very beautiful and gave me a very clear picture of how precious the rain forests really are.

 This movie also provides many examples of the concepts we have learned in Biology so far.  One of the most obvious examples is based on ecology and the fact that rain forests have rich ecosystems with a diverse population of plants and animals.  Campbell and Crane are in the Amazon rain forest in search of a cure for cancer because rain forest plants have been known to provide many important medicines for diseases like leukemia and Hodgkin's disease (made from rosy periwinkles).  In one scene, Crane gets a headache and Campbell hands her a medicine drink made from a tree bark, and this is the same as in real life because aspirin was originally extracted from willow bark.  Campbell also refers to the rain forest canopy, and this related to our studies because out textbook states that rain forests have ""stories"" and the top layer is the canopy.  When Crane is making hypotheses about the source of the p-37 acid in the original cure serum, she includes fungus as one of her choices.  We also learned that fungus is important for medical purposes, and the textbook says that the drug cyclosporine, which prevents transplanted organ rejection, was found in soil fungus.

 Campbell mentions to Crane near the beginning of their cooperative research that the juju plant flower is only found 100 feet up in the canopy tops of the rain forest trees.  He says that they are unable to grow anywhere else in the forest and that it is probably due to the fact that the tree tops meet the specific growing requirements of the flowering plant.  This is related to what we learned about how some organisms depend on others for growth and survival.  Campbell also says that the natives asked him to pray for more rain and that each year there is a decrease in rain because of the decrease in amount of rain forest land.  In the plant unit, we learned that plants lose the majority of their absorbed water from their leaves and into the atmosphere.  From there, the water condenses into clouds, and more clouds make more rain, and this explains why less rain forest means less rainfall.  Deforestation and habitat loss are also evident in the movie with the construction workers burning down large areas of the forest to build the main road.  The forest is quickly reduced to burnt stumps, and many habitats for the unique plants and animals like the ants are lost.  As a result, the researchers need to look for the ants elsewhere.

 In another scene, Campbell performs a checkup on Crane to make sure that she is not carrying any diseases that could possibly spread and kill the native Indians.  He reveals that the common cold can wipe out the Indians and tells the story of how the swine flu killed an entire population in a different region because a white foreigner went to the rain forest to make a profit off the natural resources.  This relates to our virus unit where we learned that populations never exposed to certain sicknesses have no immunity to them and therefore are at risk of dying out.  Campbell states that no precautions are ever enough because viruses are so small and can easily travel through the air.",1167609600,4,5487,4.705759162303665

The premise of a mysterious hidden cure for cancer in the depths of the Amazon jungle is not all that far fetched when you research what has been found there to date and the fact we are quickly destorying one of nature's real treasures on our planet that affects every living being.

Lorraine Brocco absolutely is stunning!!  She is a great comedic talent, a delight to watch as she matches wits with the ageless (only keeps getting better) Connery.  The charm of their relationship, the incisive banter, the stunning location work, delivers one engaging movie.
They work in the question of the destruction of the rain forrest, and the real cost to man kind; the loss of moisture for rainfal, the loss of special one of a kind plants that could hold the cure for many modern diseases.  I know many critics tried to put it down for offering no real solutions to this problem.  Get real.  This is a movie, it is meant to entertain.  If it makes us think and wonder, then it has done it job.  Solutions are up to the real world, not some fictional work.  If someone could offer solutions to the problem in two hours - they would be a very rich man.  I detest easy 'potshots' such as that.
The leads are charming, the natives in the film are wonderful, the scenery gorgeous ( Connery, Bracco AND the jungle!!), the writing is sheer perfection.
What more could you want???  From the moment Bracco arrives to find Connery in a bird costume and she introduces herself as Crane and he drunkenly replies, ""No, Tucan."",  you know you are in for a delightful time.
Also, notice the inside joke about the snake's name!!
DVD only enhances the experience of this utterly charming movie.",1015891200,33,1556,4.5978260869565215
479856,4,6302482712,"Medicine man could almost be made as a play as the vast majority of the time is taken up by dialogue between Connery and Bracco. Connery's character has found a cure for cancer, but cannot tell which of the various specimens he has been testing is the right one. There is  rather a lot of moralising about the destruction of the rain forest, and whilst admirable sentiments are being expressed, we only need to be told once. The human story is more interesting than the ostensible plot, with Connery being driven by guilt over various events in his life which will become apparent over the course of the film. There is the rather predictable love affair between Connery and his 25 years younger co-star, but thankfully not much time is taken up with this. The jungle settings are well-filmed and shown off to their best advantage, while the native peoples are treated with respect, without being patronising. Despite my reservations, Connery's charisma overcomes all of this to make an interesting, entertaining film.",1008201600,2,1017,4.912790697674419
479857,4,6302482712,"This film is not spectacular. But it is one of the first important films on the deep value of the Amazon's rain forest. A doctor discovers there a plant from which he extracts a miraculous element that cures nearly everything. Then he tries to start again and produce more of the drug, following his notes. And he fails. He never matches the first batch. He asks for an assistant, and the film makes it funny by sending a young woman. She re-does everything and she prepares new concoctions. And suddenly it works. Why ? Because, running out of sterile sugar she uses the one that is on the breakfast table. And in this sugar there are ants. The famous peak 37 that gives its potency to the drug comes from the secretions of the ants in the sugar. What cures man is an animal element. Then the suspense of the film comes from the coming of a road, of the road builders who are pushing the Indians, the forest and their secrets away. Today we are more advanced in the denunciation of this scandalous destruction of the rain forest, just as much as we are more advanced in the destruction of the rain forest itself. But the film is kind of quaint,  precious  as is the last word of the film itself. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.",983145600,5,1249,4.426086956521739
479858,5,6302482712,"I am so offended by Leonard's review that I just HAVE to write at rebuttal.
When I first saw this movie on the big screen it was utterly breathtaking.  The scope, depth, humour, and characterizations were all excellent.  Then there was the incredible view from the top of the forest canopy!
I also lament that theatres are shrinking here in Houston.  So the really big screen that helped generate that reaction are becoming rare.  I have no way to afford a home theatre of a scale to get the impact of that moment.
I have the PAL VHS and am buying the widescreen DVD now that I have a DVD player.
If you are considering the purchase of film, I strongly recommend it.
Sorry Leonard, but this is no where near the only ""miss"" that you have published. It is time to grow a deeper appreciation of the world.",978652800,4,803,4.369127516778524
479859,5,6302482712,"If limited to taking but one Sean Connery film to a desert island retreat, this would be the  choice.  'Big Tam' displays his best in this film set in  the Brazilian rainforest.  With a  conscience ravaged with guilt for  accidently decimating an Indian village, his life as a field  researcher is  tempered by his dealings with the native population.  An opportunity for  redemption appears in the form of a cure for 'the plague of the twentieth  century' which he's  found, then lost.  Portraying the questing scientist  shows Connery at the fullest of his acting  powers, which are here  outstanding.  None of the other films since the end of his James Bond  series comes even close [ENTRAPMENT would be #2 for the desert island].  Connery moves  from towering rages through deep irony to heartfelt caring  without a false step.
His opposite in this film, Lorraine Bracco, is a  mystery.  None of the other films she's made  even approaches her  performance here.  She's hardly a top-notch actress, but it would seem  Big  Tam brought out whatever 'best' she has in making Medicine Man.  The scene  of her  under the influence of yoko extract was hilarious.  She must be  given credit for trying.  It  would be nice to know whether her role was  created around her New York City origins.
There are those who grizzle  about this being a 'message film'.  In an era when nearly every  human  foible becomes the subject of books and films, a little publicity of what  is happening to  the source of the oxygen we breathe shouldn't be out of  place.  Connery's line 'less rain forest  means less rain' must have come  as a shock to those who caught it.  Most people seem to  think the opposite  is the case and that cleared forests can recover easily.  Even now, the  Brazilian government is preparing to sweep away thousands of square miles  of your source  of breathable air.  McTiernan had his work cut out in  covering topics as diverse as field  biology, medicine, environmental  mechanisms, native peoples' issues and the personal  relationship of the  two main characters in this film.  The half-hearted comments of Maltin and  Keogh in the Editorial Reviews section above reflect the superficial view  offered by too many  critics.  This film is a fine achievement and one that  can be seen repeatedly.  Buy and watch  this film.  Then have friends over  for a showing.",967161600,10,2375,4.796482412060302
479860,5,6302482712,"In this movie the lead scientist of a pharmaceutical firm (Bracco) travels  to the Amazon rainforest to see what a field botanist (Connery) is up to.  In the course of their interactions the street-wise city-dwelling Bracco  experiences the transformative value of spending time in nature.  At the  same time, Connery struggles to come to grips with a personal history that  torments him.  In the meantime the two of them work together to race  against time to locate the source of a possible miracle drug.
I show  the movie ""Medicine Man"" to all of my Introduction to  Environmental Studies classes.  Many of my students have seen the movie  either in the theater or on video, but they have viewed it only as  entertainment.  There is a lot more to this movie than entertainment value  though.
If I were reviewing this movie for entertainment value alone I  would probably rate it at about 4 stars.  The cast is good, Connery and  Bracco do a great job, and I particularly enjoy the supporting cast of  local folks.
The reason I rate it as a 5 star movie, and show it to my  classes, is that the movie shows a believable story of the plight of  indigenous peoples and the loss of pristine habitat, the importance of  maintaining biological diversity, and the detrimental impacts humans can  and do have on the natural environment.  More important than that, however,  are the lessons that can be picked up with respect to the importance of  nature's ability to change people's attitudes if they step back and give it  a chance.
Good entertainment, and a great message about the  environment.
5 stars.

7827256,5,6302482712,I saw this movie when it first aired. I haven't seen it since and had forgotten how much I liked it initially. I liked the theme of the movie about the destruction of the rain forests and not knowing what potential medical discoveries could be lost in that destruction. I think Sean Connery is one of our best actors and both he and Lorraine Bracco did a great job. I am glad I purchased it.,1525392000,,391,4.226666666666667
