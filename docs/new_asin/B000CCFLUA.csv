8590666,5,B000CCFLUA,"I purchased the three-pack because we have enjoyed the video, ""Really Big Teeth"" (about saltwater crocodiles and sharks).  I'm saving the other two videos for Christmas gifts for our son, but I'm certain they'll share the same qualities that ""Really Big Teeth"" offers.

First, the style appeals to kids in a way parents can appreciate.  There are many neat video clips of (and about) these creatures.  Dialogue describing these creatures (actors offscreen) is factual and funny.  Background music isn't distracting.

Second, many basic facts are presented about these creatures (unlike many other kid-focused wildlife videos).  I was able to create worksheets reviewing the crocodile's life cycle and basic facts about sharks.  [One neat part was the way they explained the distances at which various shark senses detected prey!  I used that for a fold-out sheet.]

NOTE: They don't cram evolution down my throat, so to speak.  It is mentioned briefly, but it isn't a main theme.

I originally came across this at a library's book sale.  It's been worth the money I spent (and then some)!",1249516800,,1088,5.113636363636363
