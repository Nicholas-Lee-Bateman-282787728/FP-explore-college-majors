8354760,4,B0027IAX46,"A hugely satisfying, old-fashioned, Romantic reading of Haydn's ""Creation"".  Supremely lyrical orchestral playing, impassioned choral singing, and Bernstein's heart-on-sleeve school of conducting (much more feelings than last week's L.A. Phil performance under Dudamel).  Near-perfect team of soloists, except for Judith Blegen whom I cannot stand in anything she appears in.  I wish Popp had sung all the soprano parts.

I urge anyone interested in the ""Creation"" to also study Handel's ""Messiah"" and ""Israel in Egypt"", the former for structural similarities and the latter for the tone paintings (nature sounds, animal sounds, etc.)  The gentle, lighthearted music of the ""Creation"" may not have the same weighty, emotional depth as Handel's oratorios, but that's beside the point.  Haydn wrote the ""Creation"" as a devote Catholic AND as a fan of opera buffa -- you can hear both elements in this optimistic, joyful and deeply human work.",1482019200,,940,5.493055555555555

8354762,5,B0027IAX46,"The magnificence of this setting may only be exceeded by the quality of the voices, both soloists and the choir. Judith Blegen and Lucia Popp are mesmerizing, although it is regrettable that Popp's part was not larger. Moser and Moll do the male solo pieces with energy and fine voice. However the chorus seems to be especially attuned to it's text and Bernstein draws from them an inspiring joyous presentation. Maybe the German setting and the predominantly German performers of a German composition cause this piece to be so well done. The orchestra is not left behind and it's participation under Bernstein's direction makes for a superior performance by all of the participants.",1415577600,4,683,5.053097345132743

8354765,5,B0027IAX46,"MANY YEARS AGO BERNSTEIN'S RECORDINGS OF HAYDN WERE ACCLAIMED BY CRITICS AS SUPERB READINGS IN THE MANNER THAT HAYDN SHOULD BE PERFORMED. BERNSTEIN'S REPUTATION WAS THAT OF PASSIONATE CONDUCTOR WHO BROUGHT OUT ALL THE LIFE THAT COULD BE FOUND IN COMPOSERS LIKE MAHLER, STRAVINSKY, AND BEETHOVEN AS WELL AS VARIED SCHOOLS OF MUSICAL CREATION. MANY FACED BERNSTEIN THE 'CLASSISIT' WITH GREAT TREPEDATION. NOT SO IN THIS DVD.  FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WE FEEL THE CONDUCTORS LOVE FOR HAYDN. THIS IS CLASSIC HAYDN AT ITS BEST.

8354767,5,B0027IAX46,"Filmed in 1986 amongst the breath-taking Baroque splendor of the Benedictine Abbey of Ottobeuren, Bavaria, this old-fashioned performance of Haydn's 1798 choral masterpiece is emotionally raw, unabashedly Romantic and ultimately apocalyptic. Performed under the (literal) cloud of the recent Chernobyl nuclear disaster and the increased tensions between East and West, Bernstein's vision of Haydn's titanic work is of a kind-of redemption through music. This is Haydn seen through a long historical lens that has already glimpsed the orchestral/choral works of Beethoven, Verdi and Mahler. Questions of authenticity are as remote from this performance as one can imagine; even as the historically informed performance movement was gathering steam around him, Bernstein was adamantly going his own interpretive way. It is important to remember, however, that in Haydn's own day the premiere of this Oratorio featured an orchestra containing more than 120 members and a large male chorus. Haydn also provided text in both German and English but Bernstein chooses the German text by Gottfried van Swieten after ""Paradise Lost"" by John Milton.

Bernstein conducts with all of his usual animation and ardor, several times seeming to levitate above the podium during particularly exciting orchestral climaxes. The Chor und Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks are one of the world's finest ensembles, quite underappreciated but always providing brilliantly appropriate performances. Along with a stellar cast of soloists that include Judith Blegen, Thomas Moser, Kurt Moll, Lucia Popp and Kurt Ollmann, the vast array of forces that fill this profoundly beautiful Baroque Abbey embrace Haydn's musical depiction of creation and humanity's place in it. Their performance is stunningly unified; the threads are masterfully interwoven by Bernstein so that nothing superfluous remains. This is a single musical tapestry that is a splendid representation of interpretive art.

If the recent, more modest 'authentic' performances of Haydn's works are what you crave then you should pass this one by. This is an old-fashioned performance in the best sense of that word. It journeys to the heart of Haydn's emotionally moving choral symphony (for that is what it essentially is) and discovers much solace and consolation along the way. Bernstein is buried less than a kilometer from my window. I'd like to think that his oft troubled spirit is assuaged somewhat by the quantity of beauty he brought into the world.

Both sound and video have been digitally remastered. They are clear though showing some age. The video is not as digitally sharp as we are now used to but there are no age related artifacts. The sound is fine but with slightly less presence than in a modern recording. If we make allowances for age the quality of this DVD recording is excellent.
