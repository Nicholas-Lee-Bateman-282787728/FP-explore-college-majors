8534208,3,B0091JJ1E2,"Not something that you review in any normal way, Cuckoo Clocks of Hell is part 3 of Ron Atkins' ""Harry Russo"" underground film trilogy, after Schizophreniac and Necromaniac. Be assured that this is a film for a very specific underground audience without the standard expectations of the movies they watch, and is a good one as such.

Here Harry shares the video screen with Terry Hawkins, an equally insane character from the 1973 underground horror classic Last House on Dead End Street, and the two end up on a psychedelic journey through Las Vegas and its desert countryside that ends....well, you can decide for yourself how it ends, since by then it has dissolved to a point of such madness that there is no objective ending! It could be anything from Harry's soul is saved by Christ to Harry is in purgatory to Harry will remain insane forever, take your pick!

For all the madness, the jaw-droppingly filmed ""rape"" scenes with no indication of penetration, the repeated use of non-actors without the faintest idea of how to deliver lines, Atkins scores again here with his usual grubby, no-budget realism, and the mix of this with the film's more psychotic and hallucinatory aspects somehow works.

Here we do have two ""great lead actors,"" though not in any usual sense, in John Giancaspro and Jim van Bebber. Their performances are so far over the top, in van Bebber's case perhaps with the actual aid of alcohol and controlled substances, that they subscribe to no usual ""acting rules,"" and Atkins anti-style ""style"" of directing is a perfect match for them.

As always with Atkins, the disturbing nature of his film comes across due to overall atmosphere, and is somehow not hampered by no-budget problems. Here one easily sees that a girl victim is not really tied up and in fact appears to be holding up her ropes, that the ""blood"" is fake in a way that gives fakeness a bad name, that people are trying not to laugh while delivering lines and on and on, but somehow it doesn't matter and it all works both as underground horror and as extreme comedy.

Just a few random examples of the mental illness on display here: cameos by serial killer John Wayne Gacy, a total bastardizaton of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" legend, more uses of the ""n"" word by white people than you're ever likely to hear outside of a KKK rally (but also a black Jesus, to supplement the white Jesus played by Atkins himself), Harry dressed up for his usual rant sessions as a series of bizarre characters including but not limited to Oz's Dorothy, and on and on.

A great terrible film, Cuckoo Clocks of Hell may have been one of the last of its kind from Atkins, who has apparently embraced Christianity in a way that precludes making further underground horrors, and is apparently now working on a Christian movie. But I am a Catholic Christian myself and see no real contradiction in liking all manner of horror films and literature, and the great Dante was a Christian writer of the extreme-horror ""Inferno"" some 700 years ago, so we'll see.",1497657600,,3023,4.705103969754253
