7864596,5,6304168179,"The Santa Experience is a nice edition to the Rugrats movies I own.
The Santa Experience- its basically and episode with two problems or plots going on. Angelica trades toys that she got at a mall for Phil and Lil's beloved toys. The twins want to get a gift each other a gift and so they traded a toy for another toy the ore would want, but when Angelica learns about naughty kids getting coal, she sets out to do something right. Another plot away, Tommy and Chuckie are trying to prevent Sana from entering their cabin the gang rented.

The Blizzard- a nice bonus cartoon in which the gang sets out to find Santa's workshop to fix Chuckies broken fire engine.
Very nice VHS and well worth any price!",1366070400,,702,4.4
