3770839,4,B001QU9RR0,My wife loves this show and i will be purchasing the last two seasons once they go on sale.,1240963200,,91,3.8421052631578947
3770840,5,B001QU9RR0,"Going into this season, I was expecting a huge drop in quality with Dylan being gone. That didn't happen. The new characters that have been introduced in prior seasons have gelled well and Brandon is really the heart of the show. I actually don't remember these episodes the way I did the prior years so it's fun being surprised a bit. The only negative thing I would have had to say was David going out of control AGAIN seemed to be overdone but when they actually put reasoning behind it (a mental condition) it was nice to see some thought had been put into it.
 As with the previous sets it's extremely addictive one you get started.
Even limiting myself to how many shows I watch ina sitting I imagine I'll have completed watching this set by the end of next weekend. From a pure product point of view any music replacement or editing was barely noticable and hasn't taken away from my enjoyment thus far.",1239494400,,910,4.481927710843373
3770841,4,B001QU9RR0,"I'm not really reviewing season 7 because i just got it yesterday and i haven't gone through it yet, but I just wanted to say how happy I am at the release schedule for the series. We usually haven't had to wait more than 4 or 5 months for a new season to be released, which is good enough timing to allow us to finish watching one before we are ready for another, and it definitely looks like we will be getting the entire series. I'm a little more worried about Melrose Place, the last couple of releases have been suspicious, first with the different packaging starting with season 4, then the long wait for season 5, then we find out that Season 5 is only HALF a season...anyway back to 90210. The music changes suck, yes. In a perfect world we'd have the series as we remembered it.  I've also heard that some of the episodes are the edited versions. But hey, at least we are getting a decent release. The packaging has been consistent, all the Seasons look great on my shelf next to each other! It kinda bugs me that they didn't include Kathleen Robertson or Jamie Walters on the covers of all of their seasons, and the fact that for the first 3 season sets they used a cover picture from the following season (Season 1 had a season 2 picture, season 2 had a season 3 picture, season 3 had a season 4 picture, that's why season 4  didn't have a group shot because they had used it already!)  but whatever, and the special features stopped at Season 4, but I'm glad I get to watch the series again.",1239148800,6,1503,4.285211267605634

3770915,5,B001QU9RR0,"It's Senior Year (again) for the college kids of 90210. If you've collected up to season 6, please continue on with buying this season. Though it's an awkward season between whose dating who and the breakups that come along with this and the kids trying to figure out who they are until they graduate from CU. Writing is better on certain episodes; however, still enjoyable and well the acting is the same, with most of the main characters still around. Continue with purchase as the storylines deepen and the show continues forward.

3770918,4,B001QU9RR0,"Beverly Hills 90210 is still going strong after six seasons and is entering into seventh season. All I can say is: is it really going strong? I'll have to say...no. I complained about the prior season for having too much of recurring characters that overstayed their welcome. I thought this problem was more ameliorated in seventh season yet some of them stayed far too short and dropped out like flies. Any time a main character breaks up with a secondary character, s/he is conveniently never seen again. The biggest downfall of Season Seven is the recycling of the same old topics. First, Dylan had a drug problem. Then, Brandon had it. On we go to David. Then, Kelly had it. Finally, of all people, Steve was ready to overdose on heroin. This one was really hard for me to believe. Worst of all, no matter how tragic a situation becomes, nobody ever suffered. It's like, ""It's so serious that it's impossible to believe anyone will die of it or whatever."" And of course, nobody did, and all were back for more episodes as usual. That was the biggest failure of the series; please, for a change, just try to have one main character, preferably David, to die; then the show can have its credibility restored. All right, let's review each of the main characters, shall we?
Brandon: The hypocrite is still at it. I felt pretty bad for Tracy Gaylian. She was a very nice girl and a dramatic improvement over Susan Keats. Remembering that episode where Sam from the Ranch would beat Brandon up if he mistreated Tracy? I was really hoping for that to happen. I knew the relationship was going to be a disaster when it turned out to be a workplace romance, and these things never work out for the best. Didn't we see this already with Susan from last season? Too much recycled material going on. When Brandon was trying to have an argument with Kelly about her secretly going to airport to see Dylan after receiving a surprise telegram, Brandon practically said that it was not fair that she was with him while being in love with somebody else. Whoa...whoa...wait a minute, didn't he just do that already to Tracy, and how horribly unfair was it to Tracy the entire time? Brandon really gets the King of Hypocrites award. You know, Brandon is always talking about morals and living by them, yet he has a fling with a stripper for a weekend. Explain that one to me. So, after seven season, Brandon, at age of 21, has slept with thirty or forty women already? He wins the Playa of Beverly Hills award also! Hmm...Brandon won the Dryer award and Best Student of graduating class and was an Honors student. You must be kidding me; he is none of that because he is not the kind of a person capable of winning or doing any of them. At best, he is just a good, typical college student but no more than that.
Kelly: The second favorite character is back but this time with less drama than the prior season. Almost too often, Kelly, as well as other main characters, faces these life-threatening situations and never suffers the tragedy. It was particularly nice to see Michael Stoyanov, a good talented actor from Blossom whose work was largely overshadowed by a huge fan favorite Joey Lawrence, to guest star in some episodes. On the other hand, I found Mark Reese's departure to be the weirdest of any because right after he lost the Dryer award, he just suddenly transferred out of school? What the heck?
Donna: Ah, the poor idiot Donna. Still the same yet still boring as ever. But what's with her hideous hair? That has to rank one of the all-time worst hair disasters ever. She finally loses her virginity in the season finale, but I must ask, is it so important to make a big deal out of it? Really? Anyway, I hated her mother and still do. I just have an incredibly hard time deciding on who was the worst character of the show history: Brenda Walsh or Felice Martin? It's just so dead even, but I may give the nod to Felice.
David: If any of the remaining main characters had to be cut out of the show for good, it's David. He is just as annoying as ever and is the worst character of the group. Every episode I watch and every time he appears, the world must revolve around David's, no other exceptions. Ever wondered why David is no longer with Valerie or Clare but is with Donna? It's because David can't control the first two, but with Donna, she is just too easy to control. And she ends up being his toy to abuse with. Oh yeah, David has verbally and mentally abused Donna for so many years; it's pretty sickening to watch. I just get ticked anytime I see his annoying face on screen and want to punch him in the nose. Of anyone in the cast, Brian Austin Green is the worst actor; pretty much constantly for seven years, while speaking his lines, he would look up, down, up, down, up down; that's a very extremely limited acting range.
Steve: The most favorite character continues to serve up the fun for the show. Unfortunately, he has become so p*ssywhipped that he is just a weak person. He should have broken up with Clare a long time ago and declared her to be a good riddance. Hopefully, after Clare is finally all gone, Steve will return his old mojo back for Eighth Season. I am very surprised that he got addicted to pot and was ready to try White China. That's so unlike Steve.
Valerie: *sighs* Valerie...Valerie...Valerie...she is so stupid that she can't even realize the difference between a dog and a cat. She is so easy that she will sleep with anybody; just be nice to her for a few minutes, and she is yours for good until something bad happens. I just knew after the meeting with Derek Driscoll, a wonderful trip on a memory lane because that's Corin Nemec from the old television show Parker Lewis Can't Lose, it was a scam all the way through. Valerie gets pathetic for the entire season and is at her worst in season finale after committing a fake suicide so she can live in Brandon's house...rent free...in Beverly Hills. It's time to kick her off the show and move on; she thoroughly sucks and has nothing to offer because her act is so old and threadbare.
Clare: Bye-bye, Clare...I hate you and never want to see you again. All that crap about her mommy's death nearly every episode is just one big, huge pathetic attempt to make everybody, especially Steve, to feel sorry for her. Hey Clare...shut the hell up. And also, she would make a big deal out of nothing and start these ridiculous fights with Steve over absolutely nothing. That was a very draining aspect on the show: it's just the same problem over and over. I am like, ""Steve, buddy...dump her and move on."" This should have happened many episodes ago. Hey Clare...shut the hell up. Finally, she would go on and on about how her father is so lonely and all that. I got a better idea, Clare...why don't you sleep with him? And yeah...shut the hell up, too.
Elsewhere, Dylan's presence is missed, and in a way, he is badly needed to get the show going because it's truly almost running on fumes. I found the idea of the rapist being free after serving two years of prison ridiculous and impossible. Not in California. The season finale was pretty bland, and I didn't find the college graduation all that worth it to watch as compared to their old high school graduation. Looking at the size of the class of 1997, yeah...right for a major California University. Speaking of graduates, I found it interesting that all of the members of the cast graduated in four years perfectly, yeah...right. Even funnier, after four years, I still have no idea what collegiate major of each was except for Kelly's. They sure put in very little effort and graduated very nicely afterwards. I see that there is simply too much champagne drinking going on in the show. All in all, I am seriously looking forward to Season Ten of Beverly Hills 90210 because it is becoming a waste of time: it's just routine and bunch of nothing but the boring going-through-motions maintenance of daily life with a lot of recycled ideas.",1306195200,3,7988,4.532548476454294

3770921,4,B001QU9RR0,"i have just finished this set the past weekend....

And i have to say, as a fan of the show, it was a much better season than i remembered it as...

Like most of the seasons of this show, it starts off slowly after the gang return together after their various summer activities... but 5- 6 episodes in, it really gets going and as the show builds up to the finale where you sense the characters really growing up as they prepare to leave colege behind for the big bad real world....

Highlights this season for me:
Val (of course!) and her relationship with married Kenny, Val's mom Abby visiting and us learning more about why Val is so screwed up and her relationship with her dad, Val and Kelly's ongoing bitchiness and jealousy over Brandon..
Kelly's friendship with the guy with HIV,
David's brush with mental illness,
Donna's stalker and the build-up and conclusion to her being held hostage...
Brandon and Tracey's relationship was nice to watch til Brandon's dilemma over getting back with Kelly...

Lowlights....
well, clare was a lot less fun this season... her and Steve's constant bickering over silly stuff got old by the end of the season and it was right i think that Clare bows out in the finale.. They changed her from being a fun, sarcastic character to just a whiner... the constant picking of fights got old...

All things considered, this is another strong season of the show... it's slow to begin with but it's worth sticking with after you are in a few episodes and things take off... and it's kinda hard not to be wistful and nostalgic watching the gang graduate at the end.... this really is it, they are all grown up now....

Looking forward to season 8, though i know the show kinda starts to lose its way in it and seasons 9 and 10 are kinda more soapy than ever and lots of characters come and go. Still, i will watch em all.....
