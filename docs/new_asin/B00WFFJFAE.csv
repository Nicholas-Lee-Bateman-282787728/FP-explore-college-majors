7131501,3,B00WFFJFAE,I'm a big fan of highly detailed Sci-Fi anime.  I loved Moonlight Mile and Planetes so I picked this up right away.  I liked the story with the twist ending which I won't spoil here.  I also enjoyed the detail in the background animation.  The problem is the character animation which almost looks cell shaded.  There's no real facial expression so the characters look and stiff and wooden.  It's very distracting and ruins the viewing experience.  If you're curious try to find a trailer or watch the first episode.  Not for everyone to be sure.,1327276800,,546,4.673684210526316
7131502,5,B00WFFJFAE,"If you like VEXILLE, you will love this Anime.
It's a great SF movie.
2001 nights is a special book for me.",1309392000,3,107,3.909090909090909
7131503,2,B00WFFJFAE,"Picked it up at a big box store before there were any amazon reviews, bit of a mistake there.

Animation very dated, looks like it pre-dates Appleseed and the Final Fantasy movies actually.  Music track sounds like it was created on someone pc not done by a studio.  The idea for the story and voice acting is only reason I give it two stars.  You could compress it down to a 20 minute episode and it would still feel too long though.",1309305600,10,434,4.2560975609756095
7131504,3,B00WFFJFAE,"I love the Appleseed and Vexille films so I was excited to see this two part feature.  I was slightly disappointed because the animation was pretty poor.  I would give it a 2.5/5 if I could.  If you never saw Appleseed or Vexille, go get those instead.. much better!",1309219200,7,266,4.387755102040816
7131505,1,B00WFFJFAE,"I've bought this one blind and thought i'd get a ""movie"", but there are only two 35min OVAs on the discs. However, i only watched the first OVA, that one was so horrible that I didn't even bothered watching the second one. The animation, modelling etc. looks like they were done by a bunch of amateurs. Oh well, maybe even amateurs could have done an better job in this ultra low budget production and don't get fooled by the trailer, they already picked the best scenes for it.

The stories were loosely picked from Yukinobu Hoshino 2001 Nights mangas. 2001 Nights is a collection of short stories that look to mankind's exploration of space, and examine the possibilities that we could face when we decide to take those first fateful steps into the unknown. This sounds interesting and might work in the mangas (haven't read them), but it doesn't in this ""movie"". Stay away from it!

If you like more realistic space anime get Planetes or Moonlight Mile and if you like CG try Vexille or Appleseed ExMachina, both of them are good and were directed by SORI, that's why i had high expectations in ""TO Movie"".

Packaging:
The Funimation US release comes in a standard DVD case, that holds a Blu-Ray and two DVDs (which you can give to some you don't like, fix an always wiggling chair or use them as coasters). Funimation wrapped the whole mess with their ""new"" ""cheap"" slipcase, they are using on their Anime ""classic"" line.",1309132800,6,1425,4.646825396825397
7131506,1,B00WFFJFAE,"I could go on and on with some self-serving pompus review of this movie, but the bottom line is, all the intensity, drama, action, splendor and provocation will be found in the trailer.
Anything other than that found in the actual viewing of the movie will leave you short of less than two hours of your precious life.

No idea who, what or why this garbage is funded and produced.",1309046400,7,381,4.442857142857143
7131507,1,B00WFFJFAE,"Wooden acting meets wooden Computer Generated Animation.  This looked
so promising in the opening credits, where you will see excellent traditional
animation used for the backdrops.  As soon as the characters appeared,
I knew I been had.  With a couple of story plots on par with Star Trek:
The Next Generation,  I feel ripped off and burned.  The incomplete series
""Moonlight Mile"" was way better than this.",1308960000,7,408,5.029850746268656

8713062,3,B00WFFJFAE,"As a casual anime purchaser, I have to say I was expecting more from this collection.  I really enjoyed Vexille and the Appleseed movies, which sport the same aesthetic appeal.  However, TO has little by way of replay value.  Think of something like the Animatrix or Batman: Gotham Knight, but limit the experience to two short stories.  The stories are not connected by anything more than time and setting.  Everything offered on the discs feels abbreviated, including the extras.

While the stories are interesting, I could only recommend this to anime fans looking for something a bit different with expendable cash.  This is a better rental than something to add to your collection.",1358726400,,686,5.017699115044247
8713063,3,B00WFFJFAE,"I viewed this two episode set without any prior knowledge.  I also saw it in hi-def Blue Ray.  The animation did remind me of Final Fantasy.  But, what I found fascinating is the plot line of the first story.  It was all quite plausible based upon physics of the real world.  That is why the comparison to Moonlight Mile is quite true.  I loved Moonlight Mile and I thoroughly enjoyed To.  I find it curious that people compare this with Vexille.  The story lines are quite different from that anime and Vexille in my opinion is a totally fictitious storyline and could not realistically happen in the future.  The other reviews are critical of To, but what I really enjoyed was not the animation, but the story.  Yes, the clunky animation was distracting at times, but once I got deeply involved in the storyline, that was the least on my mind.  I loved to read Author C Clarke and his science fiction which was based upon science facts and have all of his books.  The only thing that I was disappointed in was that there were only two episodes.  The first 12 episode part of Moonlight Mile is the only thing that I have seen that is equal to To in terms of stories that can really happen in the future.  Planetes has also been mentioned and I agree with this assessment of realism.  As far as satisfaction in viewing realistic sci-fi anime I would rank Moonlight Mile first, To 1st episode second and Planetes third.  This is based upon how many times I can or want to see the anime again.  I have rewatched Moonlight Mile at least 3 times with different friends.  I plan to see To again at least two more times, again with two of these same friends.  I have no desire to watch Planetes again and I have started that anime twice, but stopped watching after the first two episodes, due to my friends' annoyance of the primary female character.  I should add that two of the friends I view these anime and myself are over the age of 50yrs old.  To was worthy of adding to my video collection.",1341792000,2,1992,4.402739726027397
