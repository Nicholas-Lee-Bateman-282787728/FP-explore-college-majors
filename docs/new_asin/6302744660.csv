The highlight in this episode was not the flirtatious romance between Picard and Jenice (Michelle Phillips).  It kind of fell flat because there was no chemistry between them.  The effects shots that makes this one a keeper?  The scenes where Data is attempting to plug the dimensional ""hole"" in the space time continuum.  He exists in three different time lines simultaneously in the climatic scene.
The whole premise where Manheim spent his life studying time travel was tragic.  A miscalculation put him in multi-dimensions.  Why the producers threw in the former romance is a mystery to me.  There was no spark between Philips and Stewart that led me to believe that at one time they loved each other.
Data saves the episode in this one.  It was the only saving grace that put this one in my first season favorites list.  I can understand how the producers must save money for the season. However, a little character conflict might have made this a dramatic episode.  I see the contrast in the episodes done on Voyager and how far the producers have come in making the series more interesting for viewers.",987638400,,1130,4.838541666666667
