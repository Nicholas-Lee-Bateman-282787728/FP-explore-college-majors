7579161,5,B019PQ0NZG,"I just saw this film tonight and we loved it! It's a true story about a Coast Guard rescue in 1952 off the coast of Cape Cod. The story is wonderful and uplifting. The characters portrayed, seemed like admirable people.  Chris Pine and Casey Affleck, and the rest of the cast did a great acting job. I read one review that said it was an old fashioned story. Yeah, it told a story about some heroes that weren't shooting each other up like in a video game.  It showed some Americans in a positive view for a change, that there are some good Americans with great spirit. Yes, it was a good old fashioned story.  I loved it. A movie a family can go see.  No swearing, killing, etc.  Heads up parents, this is worth watching with your kids.
I love how at the end of the film they show photos of the actual people the film was about. It's about bravery. Highly recommended!",1454112000,214,869,4.274390243902439
7579162,4,B019PQ0NZG,"""The Finest Hours"" (2016 release; 117 min.) brings the telling, ""based on a true story"" we are reminded, of a daring rescue attempt at sea. As the movie opens, it is ""Wellfleet, MA, November 1951"", and we get to know two Coast Guarders who are out on a double date. Bernie (played by Chris Pine) is immediately smitten by Miriam *played by Holiday Grainger). The movie then shifts to February 17, 1952, where Bernie and Miriam are attending a party, and they decide to get married in April. Later that night, as a nor'easter is bearing down, the Pendleton tanker is in serious trouble, and before we know it, Bernie is ordered to assemble a crew and go out to find any survivors of the Pendleton. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is a big budget movie from Disney Studios, directed by Craig Gillespie (""Lars and The Real Girl""; ""Million Dollar Arm""). If you have seen the movie's trailer (which as been inescapable in the theaters in recent weeks), you know exactly what you are in for: a bigger-than-life, against-all-odds recue attempt of the crew of the Pendleton tanker, which has split in two, by a four man crew of the Coast Guard in Chatham, MA. Don't ask me how the Pendleton's remaining half tanker doesn't sink! I think it has something to do with the boat's balancing tanks, but in the end it doesn't matter, as we are here to witness some of the wildest open sea disaster scenes you'll ever see. In a sense, this reminds of ""Titanic"", except that the action scenes are pumped up and on steroids. Chris Pine (as Bernie) and Casey Affleck (as the Pendleton's main guy) are fine, but to be honest, they and the rest of the gang are all second fiddle to the special effects. I know that it's all CGI, yet it looks so darn realistic! The movie has a great orchestral score, courtesy of veteran composer Carter Burwell (his score for ""Carol"" received an Oscar nomination). Also make sure to stay through the movie's end titles, as we then get a  bunch of period pictures from the Boston Globe and other news sources with the real life people from the events (and likely the source of the costuming for the film). Last but not least, this is released both in 2D and 3D, but just know that the movie was shot in 2D and then converted into 3D (I saw it in 2D). Bottom line: ""The Finest Hours"" is a good ol' fashioned disaster-and-rescue drama that is much better than the ""experts"" would have you believe.

""The Finest Hours"" opened nationally this weekend, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. somewhat to my surprise. Regardless, if you are in the mood for an effects-heavy but very realistic disaster-and-rescue movie, I encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray (although a movie of this kind just begs to be seen on the big screen). ""The Finest Hours"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1454112000,44,3022,4.571955719557195
7579163,5,B019PQ0NZG,"The Coast Guard has always held a special place in my heart, particularly after reading ""So Others May Live"" by Martha J. LaGuardia-Kotis, about Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers (available on Amazon). Now we have a new book co-authored by Casey Sherman and Michael J. Tougias which was adapted by a team of script writers for Director Craig Gillespie (""Lars and the Real Girl"" and ""Million Dollar Arm""). They wrote a thrilling actioner that will leave you exhausted but happy. It's based on a real event which is still considered to be the greatest small-boat rescue in the history of the Coast Guard.

This movie takes place in 1952 off the coast of Cape Cod when a pair of oil tankers are caught in a vicious blizzard where violent seas broke both of them in half. We end up with only the stern of the SS Pendleton left afloat. The crew could see the welds failing and had closed all the bulkheads. Of course their major challenges are maneuverability and communications...along with overwhelming waves, lack of leadership (their captain was in the other end), and an endless series of crises, which prompt one desperate tactic after another.

The cast:
  * Chris Pine (""Star Trek"") Shy, self-effacing Coast Guardsman Bernie Webber knows crossing the bar into a stormy sea is probably hopeless, but if his commanding officer has given the order.... Only three men volunteer to go along.
  * Holliday Grainger (""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" 2015) Miriam is NOT shy or self-effacing. In fact, SHE proposes to HIM because she knows Bernie will never muster the courage.
  * Ben Foster (""Lone Survivor"") Richard Livesey makes fun of his commanding officer's Georgia accent and he seems alienated and surly, but when the chips are down, he volunteers to go with Bernie on that hopeless rescue mission.
  * Kyle Gallner (""American Sniper"") is Andy Fitzgerald, one of the  Guardsmen who gamely volunteers to join them.
  * Eric Bana (""Munich"") Daniel Cluff is in charge of this Coast Guard station. He's unsure about sending his men out to almost certain death, but he can't ignore a foundering oil tanker in heavy seas.
  * Casey Affleck (""Interstellar"") Ray Silbert is reluctant to give orders on that disintegrating tanker, but no one is taking any effective action, so his ingenious problem solving becomes vital to his 31 other shipmates.
Because this is based on real people, we don't see any swashbuckling bravado, but instead we see visible hesitation and concern about this rash decision, AND the aftereffects as adrenalin wears off following that hair-raising rescue.

This is rated PG-13, so expect an overwhelming storm at sea, but no profanity, no sweaty bodies, no gunfire and and just one teeny little car crash into a snow bank! Wow! What you WILL see is the resourcefulness of humans, the tenacity of these seafaring heroes and a wonderful wrap up which includes newspaper accounts of the incident, photos of the ""real"" people and bits of biographies to provide a satisfying end to a thrilling film. Please recommend this to your friends!",1454025600,47,3041,4.933333333333334

I look at the men in that time period and wonder if any of those men would have survived if that accident had happened today. We are growing up a generation of boys that are pansies and some of that blame falls on women! Women need to stop knocking men down and let them be men and men need to stand up for themselves. The entertainment world should be blamed for what is now called ""entertainment""...it is GARBAGE! Literally poison for the mind.
  We need more movies that are based on real life because currently we have a bunch of people running around thinking life is so horrible because it isn't an action flick. The movies now are so filled with, foul language, lewd sex acts, killing, abuse, drugs, etc. it is no wonder people of today are so messed up!

7579245,5,B019PQ0NZG,"The six of us went into this without any expectations, so we were first surprised that this is a Disney movie.
This wound up keeping all 4 of our teenagers and ourselves engaged throughout.

+ Movie is very clean for the most part, even with the PG-13 rating. Rating is for thrilling moments and a few minor profanities. If interested, check IMDB for more details.

+ Movie opens with the romantic subplot, which is needed to set motives for characters throughout the story

+ Chris Pine plays a VERY different character than the smart-aleck, over confident, fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants Captain Kirk.
His character sees an interesting transformation through the story, which is nice.

+ Casey Affleck plays the smartest ship engine-man.
It was almost a little unbelievable at times that Affleck talks like he's been doing the ship sailing thing for 40+ years, yet looks age 30-ish. But we can easily move past that and enjoy his character's creative solutions to situations.

-- This story takes place when religion and God were professed more by much of Americans.
When watching other movies made in that time period about that time period we do get that element as part of the culture and world building, yet we see none of that in this movie. Thus, the immersion into the time period seemed to lack a bit. A minor thing, so no loss of stars.

+ Lots of good ""disaster"" action

+ Lots of good ""rescue"" action

OVERALL:
We were very pleased in how an entertaining, well-acted movie can be made in today's day and age and not have all the shock value stuff.

Its tempered around the nostalgia of the era of the 50's and around coast guard life instead of trying to wow you with flash and over the top CGI and death defying antics. The fact these men went out to sea in a storm to rescue others was death defying enough. (and coming from a mariner family - they were our true heroes)
Chris Pine did a great job portraying, Bernie, a CG enlisted who wasn't too sure of himself until the moment when it counted most and he found his inner strength to pull off a rescue his brethren were not fond to step up too.
Cinematography was gorgeous (which helps this film along its slower pace). Worth watching",1497744000,,716,4.272058823529412

7579279,4,B019PQ0NZG,"At last! An action/adventure film without a single gunshot! Not that I have anything against a good shoot-em-up, but a man vs. nature tale is just what the doctor ordered.

This is the story of Coast Guardsmen at their best, risking their own lives to save others. The story takes place in the winter of 1952 when two aging WWII tankers break in half off the Massachusetts coast in a storm. The story focuses on the rescue of the SS Pendleton in which a small boat must brave towering waves and gale-force winds just to get to the stricken tanker...or, rather, the aft part of the ship since it broke in half and the bow section sank.

There are two related stories in this film. The first is the Coast Guard crew of Bernard C. Webber, Andrew J. Fitzgerald, Richard P. Livese and Ervin E. Mask. These men must risk everything just to get over the bar, a task likely to get them killed even before the rescue even begins. The second story is of the crew of the Pendleton who must overcome their disunity to keep the aft section of the ship afloat long enough for help to reach them.

It's an engrossing film...once it gets moving. The reason it lost a star with me is the rather clumsy romance between Chris Pine and Holliday Grainger which is the focus of the first 15 minutes of the film. None the less, the rest of the film is worth it.

A great action/adventure film and definitely worth four stars.",1493164800,3,1402,4.401544401544402

7579397,5,B019PQ0NZG,"The Finest Hours film had heartfelt performances involving life or death situations and based on a true story (involving the U.S. Coast Guard). Chris Pine stars as Boatswains Mate First Class Bernie Webber and Holliday Grainger plays Miriam Webber (a woman that Bernie Webber is engaged to be married to). Webber, along with some other men, are sent out on a dangerous mission to try to save some men on a Coast Guard ship before it completely plunges in the water. Various other actors/actresses are featured in this film as well because the movie shows various men trying to work together to buy themselves time before their ship goes under. Viewers of this film are also going to get a glimpse inside the mind of some of Webbers coworkers (due to a scene where Webbers fianc comes up to his job to see how he is doing and is told by some of her fiances coworkers what he might be facing).",1482019200,,891,4.540372670807454

Don't know what some of the lower rated reviewers were watching but this is thrilling and emotional from beginning to end.  It doesn't have super heroes with super powers but just real heroes who put their lives on the line for all of us.  Pine and Affleck's performances were outstanding and subdued.  The supporting cast was fine also.  The special effects were incredible and anyone who says they weren't is being too critical.  Sure the ocean scenes are CGI but they are amazing anyway.  How else can you tell the story of a rescue at sea without them, or did the reviewers who knocked them want to have a phony back lot shot instead. The film runs about 2 hours but it feels shorter as there are no wasted moments, it is just compelling filmmaking and worth your while to see it.",1480636800,,881,4.368098159509202

It would have been neat to see a young man behave with such courage and leadership, but Chris Pine was in his mid-to-late 30s. They scrambled the story to increase the tension, which didn't need to be increased. And they turned the hero's wife, who was home sick with the flu for the entire event, into a strident and foolish girl-friend character who behaved with breath-taking inappropriateness. I cringed.

It was fun to see the boats involved. Oh, but they also totally scrambled the story of the men being rescued, and had to create a ""villain"" there as well. Freakin' Disney. I should have known better than to watch it. It was actually a very good *true* story. It didn't need to be turned into a Disney fairytale.

I wanted to know more (in depth) about the history behind the movie and it's characters so I googled after I finished watching.  For me, that's a great movie that leaves me wanting to know more.  It had a bit of romance, a strong female, suspense/thrill and a daring rescue with great actors.  I liked how they showed real pictures from the actual return compared to the movie stills during the final credits.  If anything, I would have liked to have a little more background in the beginning on the area, the previous rescue gone wrong where lives were lost.  But that was really minor.

We know that that night was a real cold freezing day, but in the movie nobody seems to be bothered by the temperature. We also don't think that the boat went under the water like that.

The most disappointing is Pine's love interest Holliday Grainger who is as cold as a winter tempest without any of its excitement. The special effects are incredible, so realistic I felt the chill of both the storm and sea.

7579529,5,B019PQ0NZG,"Set in 1952, this 2016 movie re-tells the story of what has been called the most harrowing and heroic small-boat rescue ever conducted by a US Coast Guard crew. In the midst of an epic hurricane-force storm off Cape Cod Massachusetts, two oil tankers each break in half. Over 30 crew members are trapped in the rear segment of the SS Pendleton, barely afloat in seventy-foot seas and threatened by loss of all engine power and hope of remaining alive if rising water in the engine room reaches the air intakes of their engines.

As Engineer Ray Sybert organizes a strategy aboard the Pendleton to steer the unwieldy third-of-a-ship to run aground, It falls to a crew of four brave Coast Guard sailors led by Boatswains Mate First Class Bernie Webber, to brave mountainous waves in a 30 foot boat, to reach the tanker and take off as many of the crew as possible. Against all odds and much of the time sailing by dead reckoning in jet black dark with their compass destroyed in a roll-over, the four crewmen do reach the Pendleton. They extract 32 crew members and bring them back ashore in a boat rated for only 12 passengers.

The cinematography of this film is truly exceptional. The towering seas and the crash of waves in shoal water are depicted in the finest detail. The acting of the cast led by Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, and Ben Foster is also Academy Award quality. As an added bonus, many of the actors selected for this cast bear striking physical resemblances to the actual participants in the events portrayed.

This is a deeply moving depiction of adventure and heroism among common men who put aside their own fears and exceed their own and others expectations. It is well worth seeing.",1474848000,,1702,4.647840531561462

7579547,2,B019PQ0NZG,"This movie by Disney is contrived, forced and anachronistic.  The event itself couldn't have been more dramatic.  Disney sugarcoated the event with melodrama drowning what could have been a very exciting film.  The acting is wooden.  Even the romantic relationship is canned and wooden.  Characters are caricatures as if from a Disney cartoon. The description of ""crossing the bar"" is so unbelievable as to convince one that one is watching a cartoon or animation.  Worst of all is the anachronistic excising of God from the film.  In great concern about how the rescue might proceed without a compass and in the dark the lead character lowers his head but never utters a prayer or even a sound.  He made me tihink of Peter Townsend's ""Tommy the Pin Ball Wizard"".  Not once was God called out to by anyone, not once does a character pray.  In the 50s people were more humble and realistic.  Hollywood would convince us otherwise.

What is it like to cross the bar that braces the bay from the ocean.  Here is the poem I learned in public school in the 50s.  Tennyson thought of crossing the bar from the bay out to the ocean as a metaphore for crossing from this life to the next.  Perhaps the original men who went out into the ocean to effect this rescue did the same.

""Crossing the Bar"", Alfred Lord Tennyson

Sunset and evening star,
And one clear call for me!
And may there be no moaning of the bar,
When I put out to sea,

But such a tide as moving seems asleep,
Too full for sound and foam,
When that which drew from out the boundless deep
Turns again home.

Twilight and evening bell,
And after that the dark!
And may there be no sadness of farewell,
When I embark;

For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place
The flood may bear me far,
I hope to see my Pilot face to face
When I have crost the bar.",1474156800,,1812,4.368263473053892

7579550,4,B019PQ0NZG,"I had the unique privilege to see this with the crew of a USCG Surf Station in Oregon. This movie is about one of the greatest surf ""small boat"" rescues in USCG history, so this was a treat to see it with all of these fine coastguardsmen who live this life. The movie is not a fast paced, action packed war movie, or anything of the like. This is a well told story, from both sides, of surf rescue and the sort of men and women that hold that responsibility. While the love story isn't quite accurate, it also doesn't really matter to the overall rescue and that is the point of the movie. It's well done, and while there are plenty of technical errors (uniforms, radio jargon etc) the story is still good at its core. Moreover it's a great story and movie that is a nod to simpler times.

The USCG is not always acknowledged for their great efforts to keep this country safe, and certainly there are more Saving Private Ryan, Blackhawk Down, We Were Soldiers, Patton (etc) type movies out there that are not slow paced and methodical like Finest Hours is. However, the USCG has a different mission and boat forces makes up probably...75% of their mission. As a result is delightful to see this movie that tells the story of the boat forces and while I don't know if BMC Webber was a surfman, in many ways this movie about his rescue is a great tribute to all the 500 or so ""surfmen"" who have and do brave(d) the roughest seas to bring mariners home safely. It's a great movie with a great sentiment and feel to it. Think I'll watch it again now.",1474070400,,1546,4.3310344827586205

7579555,3,B019PQ0NZG,"2.5 stars. Solid, stolid, very old-fashioned men-at-sea movie. Tries to hit all the same notes that Perfect Storm did, but comes off flat and monotone. You know every dramatic beat well before it comes because you've seen it all before -- the storm, the ship in trouble, the heroic rescue, the faithful woman waiting at the harbor, etc. etc. The acting's fine but no big deal. Also, no offense, but you have to have a very high tolerance for heavy New England accents, which the whole cast ladles on with trowels. If you're a huge fan of ships-at-sea movies you'll probably like it, but trust me, you've seen it before.",1473811200,,619,4.636363636363637

7579567,4,B019PQ0NZG,"The impossible situation is not new to film. And like any other genres some are, some, not so much. I liked this one quite a bit.

Here's the scoop. Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) is in the coast guard in Chatham, MA. He's just met the girl he wants to marry. A winter storm has hit the coast and a large tanker has split in half. Webber heads out with three buds, in a small boat, to exact a rescue.

This is a pretty cool flick with exciting, but not overwrought, scenes. It's essentially a Murphy's law scenario because all sorts of things go wrong with both Webber's boat as well as the ship they are trying to rescue. There's a lot of CG, and it melts, rather seamlessly, in with the live action. The story shifts, at nearly precise intervals, between the two boats and what's happening back at the base. The performances are uniformly good and the directing is solid.

I take issue (I think) with the depiction of many of the characters and the dialogue. This is set in 1952. Did people talk and behave that much differently then than they do now? It was a bit weird to watch in that regard.

Other than that, this is a solid effort. Not great art by any means but solid craft. I'm not certain I would put this on my shelf for repeated viewings, but I'm glad I watched it.",1473552000,,1274,4.273858921161826
7579568,5,B019PQ0NZG,"I had read ""The Finest Hours"" by Michael J. Tougias and Casey Sherman and recommend it highly. I had high hopes for this movie adaptation of the book, and have to say that Disney did not disappoint. This movie is a film about the courage of seemingly ordinary people under great stress, and is faithful to the spirit of the rescue and the traditions of valor that run deep in the US Coast Guard. On February 18, 1952 two World War Two era T-2 tanker ships, the ""Pendleton"" and the ""Fort Mercer"" split in half within 40 miles of each other in a terrible storm off the northeast United States. Amazingly, portions of each ship remained afloat and the rescue effort was extremely confused at the outset as nobody was sure where the pieces were or what was still floating.

The book details the travails of both ships, but the film focuses almost exclusively on the ""Pendleton"". A crew of four was sent from the USCG station at Chatham, Massachusetts on the 36-foot rescue boat CG-36500 (which, by the way, is now preserved in a museum) under the command of Bernie Webber, here played to perfection by Chris Pine. The act of going out in that weather was heroic enough, but the rescue itself became legendary in USCG circles, and the onscreen depiction here is nearly perfect. Water is very hard to digitally model, but effects have gotten much better since ""The Perfect Storm"" was made, and here they look great. The ""Pendleton"" sets are amazingly realistic and the digital compositing of the stern of the ship against the frothing backdrop of the ocean is superb. Throughout the acting is first rate, though I'm unsure that the character of Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) would have actually been so shy and retiring at the outset of the drama.

""The Finest Hours"" is a great movie that I highly recommend for all adults and mature children. It's clean enough for all kids, though very young kids may be scared by some of the very realistic and frankly terrifying images of foundering ships. Disney did a great job with this one, and director Craig Gillespie (""Million Dollar Arm"") shines through as one of the most versatile and capable in Hollywood. The DVD includes two very short extras, both of which were promotional shorts, one on the mission and people of the US Coast Guard, and one a behind the scenes look at the cast and production.",1473552000,12,2338,4.658595641646489

7579597,4,B019PQ0NZG,"Directed by Craig Gillespie (Million Dollar Arm), this film tells the true story of the greatest small boat rescue in U. S. Coast Guard history.  Set in 1952 on the elbow of Cape Cod, the coast is being pounded by a raging winter storm.  Two giant oil tankers are caught in the high seas and eventually break in two parts.  The first ship is immediately targeted for rescue by the closer Boston Coast Guard.  The second ship is all but ignored due to efforts of ship number one.

There are two heroes in this movie.  The first is Bernie Webber (Chris Pine), a non-commissioned officer who is sent with 3 other volunteers to take on the hazardous rescue mission.  The second is Ray Sybert (Casey Afflick, Interstellar) who is charged with keeping the 35 surviving crew members afloat.  Bernies new fianc, Miriam (Holliday Grainger, Cinderella), calls out the station commander, Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana, Star Trek with Chris Pine) for even contemplating what appears to be a suicide mission.  But he doesnt relent.

Richard Livesey (Ben Foster) is Bernies right hand man in the adventure.  Pine and Foster will team up a few months later in one of the best movies of the year, Hell or High Water.  The Disney produced film is a by-the-numbers thriller that goes slightly overboard in the way of emotional mush.  At the same time the story is remarkable and the special effects equal to the task.

Like the two heroes, the focus is twofold.  One is the challenge of the small boat known as the 36500 and its 4 man crew to escape the dangerous waters of the Cape to deeper waters and then to find the tanker.  While obviously CGI had to be used, it is very effective and by all accounts honest in its portrayal.  The second thing to watch is the detail inside the bowels of the potentially sinking tanker.  Special rigging is concocted for steering what is left of the ship and it has ever hazardous consequences.  The film is entertaining and at times offers state of the art filmmaking.

The Blu ray package comes with 1080p video resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, French and English SDH.  The video looks great.  The film is mostly shot at night, so the detail and contrast had to be spot on.  As are the black levels.  Even the interior shots seem authentic with the lower wattage incandescent bulbs providing dull optics.  I could not see any artifacts or compression anomalies.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 audio option is a killer.  A movie like this needs to be heard like this.  As you would expect the thunderous storm immerses the viewer with action coming from all angles.  As the tanker runs aground and later sinks, it moans to its death with rattling, rumbling and creaks.  All very effective.  Stellar transfer.  Here are some extras:

Do yourself a favor and set the skip-ahead speed to like 2x or 3x, you will save some time and not miss anything.  The dialogue is spoken in a language called ""faked Bostonian"" which you need to jack up the volume to try deciphering and then it's infused with constant wind and rain so there's no benefit to the audio. Zero.
While you're whizzing away seeing this at half or a third of the time that us suckers endured, you still have time to ask yourself whether the coast guard really didn't have uniforms or decent sized rescue ships for the north Atlantic (you can even do double screen action to liven up your mind and research this as the movie is still dragging on).  Start asking yourself intellectually stimulating questions like ""what would am infographic on this nefarious ""bar"" look like to assist in educating the audience so we can appreciate why it's so daunting?""... Because for us civilians who don't live off Nantucket, i promise the movie didn't really enlighten the point.  Try to fathom (pun intended) how the oil tanker could stay afloat in its condition and why the Titanic couldn't.  Imagine the water and air temperature that seems to have no effect on our characters here, and pretend you've experienced some character development, plot development, helpful dialogue, or insightful problem solving without the benefit of technology at sea.

It was made by Disney so there has to be a fairy tale romance involved which I can almost promise never happened the way it was shown in this movie. Bernard Webber was already married at the time but from all I can learn she did ask him. This is an extraordinary story about some very special people who did what they were expected to do and did so in unbelievable fashion. Some of the action was bit over the top but all in all mostly within the realm of what the 36 footers could do and in this case, did, Ordinary men under extraordinary circumstances time ten makers a hero out them all.
The only other thing that was bit odd was the attempt at the New England accent. Little more work there guys!

I do however with that Disney would realize that people have a use for both DVD and Bluray.

7579766,1,B019PQ0NZG,"The PG-13 rating should have alerted me. I'm not sure which part of it is the worst - the script, the direction or the acting. The dialogue is halting and cliched, one moment screamed, the next in a normal tone of voice under the same circumstance; the direction is haphazard with long pointless pauses; the acting is wooden and unconvincing. There is little or no character development. Even the CGI is poorly done and over-dramatized. The radio operator employs jargon not used for another 20 years, such as ""Roger copy,"" when it should have been ""Roger Wilco"" (will comply). It's February, snowing on land, a light breeze and everyone is bundled up. A few miles offshore people are on the freighter's deck in T-shirts or lightweight clothes and being drenched in spray driven by gale-force winds. No one is even shivering, much less suffering the early stages of hypothermia. The girlfriend swans into the Coast Guard station, where a sailor tells her she's not allowed but surrenders to her determination. The grumpy old fishermen take pity and open up to her; then she marches straight into the CO's office to tell him what he should be doing. I suffered through the first half before deciding the rest wasn't worth watching. It will be a present for a friend's six year-old.",1469836800,,1280,4.822727272727272

7579778,5,B019PQ0NZG,"This movie is not your typical Hollywood fare. It starts off slowly, and the male leads are not the normal macho, slightly flawed heroes of action movies or thrillers. Chris Pine and Casey Affleck beautifully portray real men, (Bernie Webber and Ray Sybert respectively) that were evidently humble, gentle, persevering, and brave men, that were forced by life-threatening circumstances into leadership positions. I loved it!

Even though the movie starts off slowly, it picks up speed with the amazing rescue of the men that were trapped on the sinking oil tanker, ripped in half by a raging storm. Wow!

7579817,4,B019PQ0NZG,"Based on the extraordinary true story of the greatest smallboat rescue in Coast Guard history. When a massive storm strikes off the coast of Cape Cod, it rips a T-2 oil tanker in half, trapping more than 30 sailors on its rapidly sinking stern. As Captain Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) and his crew set out in a 12-seat rescue boat to save them, Chief Engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) struggles to buy his men more time. First let me give you the reason for the 4 stars and not 5 which I really wanted to give it. Holiday Granger, the girl that Chris Pine's character is engaged to...useless, worthless to the story and why she had so much to do is beyond me. she was not necessary in any way. every other player is excellent especially Casey Affleck, I am a huge fan and always will be. Chris Pine, Eric Bana as the Coast Guard commander and Ben foster all great the crew on the tanker...great. The story is riveting and rings of honesty.

7579981,5,B019PQ0NZG,"OUTSTANDING A MUST SEE FOR FAMILY,  In 1952 when this rescue occurred the oldest baby boomer would have been only six years old ('46 to '64 years BBers were born) this is to put things in perspective now.  As the hero of the Coast Guard was around 23 years of age when he and three other brave men went out to save souls.  Bernie Weber was 82 when he died.  He was married 58 years so as he WAS NOT married in 1952 I'm guessing he was 23 maybe 24.  How many young men raised today would have the courage to do what he did?  Too many young people today are stupid and think they are owed a living, not willing to work hard and make a living.  Too busy crying victim, racist, I want to use a bathroom which I want to choose men's or women's etc.  More worried about movie stars breaking up then voting.  Too lazy to learn English and expect to blend in as an AMERICAN.  It's so sad to watch for decades as so many businessmen, politicians/government workers and regular people strive for greed and power and could care less about a unified United States of America and each other.

7579997,5,B019PQ0NZG,"With an aunt and uncle living on Cape Cod, as a boy in the fifties it was where I played, explored, and discovered my love for the sea. As a teen, my friend and I took my uncle's 12 foot boat with it's 5 hp engine across to Monomoy Island to see harbor seals basking on the sand beach. We climbed to the top of the dune and saw the stern of a large ship sticking out of the water offshore. It was the Pendleton.  It was decades later that I would learn of its fate and the unimaginable heroics of a Chatham Coast Guard life boat crew.  The Finest Hours is that story.  The book was riveting in itself, but this motion picture was able to capture the location with its unique sand bar and the sheer dedication to duty and lifesaving that is still the essence of the Chatham Station. Watch this movie to be thrilled. Watch it to learn of what simple, uncomplicated devotion to the preservation of life looks like. But above all else, watch it to respect the thousands of Americans who form the fundamental moral structure upon which we all stand.",1466985600,,1044,4.289340101522843

The 3-D effects in the theater were spectacular. Showed the movie to some relatives and we all were on the edge of our seats. It ranks as one of the best movies I have seen in a long long time. I felt like this movie did not get enough publicity before it it the theaters but it is well worth watching. Great story line and great special effects.

7580042,5,B019PQ0NZG,"realistic scenes crossing the bar - Hollywood drama about Bernie's ""fiancee"" as they married a year earlier and she was confined to bed with bad flu during actual incident. Didn't show ""Tiny"" being crushed between boat and derelict - but I agree, and wouldn't want my grandkids seeing that. Also they (rightly) glossed over the others lost in that double-disaster.  This is a documentary more or less designed for kids to see not just the courage of Bernie and his crew, but their perseverance against terrible odds. Bernie should have been awarded the USCG Medal (for extraordinary heroism) which would have given him extra ""promotion points"" throughout his career. (I blame the HQ Awards Board - guys who probably had no true idea of what went on that they awarded him a Gold Lifesaving Medal (one step lower).

The story itself was good. I don't think they needed to add the romantic touch to it, as it wasn't necessary since in real life Bernies wife was sick at home with the flu for the entire incident. As retired U.S. Coast Guard, we felt the film should have spent more time on the story itself rather than the love story on how Bernie and Miriam met, as it didn't really add anything to the story. It was just a waste of film, effort, time and money.
Overall, it did a fantastic job of showing the magnitude of what the U.S. Coast can and does do every day with normal men and woman.",1466208000,,737,4.089655172413793

7580160,4,B019PQ0NZG,"Two common comments made by both critics and movie goers stand out about this Disney made production starring Chris Pine and Casey Affleck - It is an old fashioned adventure film and that the love interest was a bore.

  The Finest Hours  is a film about the true story of the Coast Guard rescue of crew members of 2 tankers hit by one of those deadly noreasters that is not uncommon off of the  Masachusetts coast, near Cape Cod, during the winter of 1952. The tankers, old World War II vessels, that sailed badly even in good weather, were the SS Pendleton and the SS Fort Mercer. Both ships were split in two by fierce winter seas. A Coast Guard cutter, the CGC Yakutat was sent out to find survivors of the SS Fort Mercer before they know that the stern section of the second ship was also stranded on a sandbar near Chatam, Mass. with 33 survivors. The coast guard send out 2 small 36 foot lifeboats to attempt a rescue in fierce 70 foot seas, and to attempt to cross the deadly sandbars surrounding Cape Cod. Seamen and boaters familar with the oceans surrounding the Cape know how dangerous these seas are even in normal weather. One lifeboat reached the SS Pendelton and off loaded all but one of the stranded crew. For this truly heroic effort, the four-man lifeboat crew received the Coast Guards highest medal, the Gold Lifesaving Medal.

 The film did not attract the expected audiences and lost money for Disney. The major criticisms of the film is accurate In that it is an old-fashiioned film made without embelishments. Although a screen appears before the film begins that states that the film is based on a true story, that is an understatement. The screenplay stays very close to the actual event. The only real embellishment is the role played by the female lead. Miriam was actually sick in bed at the time of the event. The inclusion of the romantic storyline does tend, however, to hold the story together. Without the addition of the love interest thread, the film would play more like a documentary and may have attracted even fewer audiences.

 The Finest Hours is a very good film that will interest people who are knowledgeable about seamanship, know about the people who lived and fished on the Cape at the time, and the history of the Coast Guard in the early 1950s. Recommended.",1466208000,,2309,4.61219512195122

The effects were well done I thought. The acting hits the mark most of the time but not nearly all of it. I've seen much better performances from some of the actors. It leads me to believe that the directing was probably off and it definitely seems that some of the casting decisions didn't seem to work well. The chemistry was definitely off a good bit of the time. The marketing versus the reality is the writers went dramatic chick flick with the male and female lead instead of focusing more of the story on the men trying to survive and our would be heroes. If you are looking for something like Band of Brothers you're looking in the wrong place. It's not nearly as bad as Pearl Harbor so if you're looking for something to watch with your girl that you can somewhat appreciate, want to pay attention to, and she'll probably love, then this could be the movie for you.",1465948800,,1016,4.296875

7580239,4,B019PQ0NZG,"The film depicts the true story of the dramatic sea rescue which took place in the waters off 'Cape Cod' on the 18th and 19th of February 1952
by 4 lifeboat-men from the 'Chatham Lifeboat Station' after the tanker the 'S.S.Pendleton' broke in two during a violent storm.
An earlier reviewer rightly points out that the on-shore story-line is a little thin, however the visual content at sea is frankly 'stunning'
We follow a four-man lifeboat crew captained by 'Bernie Webber' (Chris Pine) who accompanied by 'Richard Livesey' (Ben Foster) - 'Andrew
Fitzgerald' (Kyle Gallner) and 'Ervin Maske' (John Magaro) are directed by their Station-Master 'Daniel Cluff' (Eric Bana) to attempt what
colleagues at the Station describe as a 'suicide-mission' - to attempt the improbable rescue of those on the stricken vessel.
The crew face giant waves and a violent under-currant at the 'bar' that during a heavy storm is considered totally impossible to navigate, yet
they battle the elements. (The Lifeboat designed to carry a maximum of 12 in addition to it's crew-members)
Back at the station 'Bernie's' girlfriend 'Miriam' (Holliday Grainger) pleads with the Station-Master to recall the lifeboat fearing her man would
surely perish.
On the stricken vessel with over 30 survivors on-board they struggle to keep it afloat hoping for an unlikely rescue, owing there chance of doing
so to Chief Engineer 'Ray Sybert' (Casey Affleck)
This is a brilliantly portrayed drama well worthy of viewing.

7580259,2,B019PQ0NZG,"Many things wrong with this movie and I almost NEVER do movie reviews. Was a slow movie, no one was shivering yet they were in a freezing cold ocean in winter storm. Just not realistic. The girlfriend always had fresh lipstick on and perfect hair in the middle of the storm. Then people were DRY, yes DRY when it was raining on them??? It was so irritating. I have no clue why it has 5 stars and wish we didn't waste money on this movie. Not made well and it was done by Disney. REALLY BAD! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.",1465862400,2,514,4.15
7580260,3,B019PQ0NZG,"I am a sucker for sea disaster films. The star in this genre is almost always the Sea and you get on board for the ride, so things like cliched writing and shallow characters don't matter--in fact, they're required! This film is no exception. It follows the usual formula:  the noble young hero (Chris Pine) with A Past and Something to Prove battles nature against all odds. The taciturn hero  (Casey Affleck) is unpopular on his ship, but Saves the Day and earns the respect of the men. The Bad Guy who defies him wants to do it his way, but comes around in the end; the Plucky Woman WaitsBreathlessly Back At Home. This film is not as good ""The Perfect Storm"", which was cliched but had some great actors (John Hawkes stole that film.)  But it's miles better than the hammy ""In the Heart of the Sea"", which had overly digitized fake special effects and Chris Hemsworth bellowing at the sea like Charlton Heston in the Ten Commandments. In ""The Finest Hours"", the waves in this film behave like real waves, and the special effects are really well done. But the rest of it was a Disney Theme Ride where no one gets cold, wet, and the waves only show up to serve plot points. I live on a Great Lake (Ontario) and we routinely have storms with gale force winds, especially in winter. I""m not a stickler for realism in movies, but there should be at least SOME effort made. In 40-60 mph. you don't have gently falling flakes of snow where the car windows never seem to get covered.  And most laughable--when the girlfriend goes out in the middle of a winter storm with no coat, hat or gloves--she doesn't even shiver except for one badly acted pretense at it. On the rescue boat, there is supposed to be 60 mph winds, but whenever there is a close-up of Chris Pine, who is steering a boat that has lost its cabin roof no less, there is no wind and his hair is barely ruffled. The boat is submerged many times, but no one looks particularly wet. And although I know it's a true story, we're supposed to be believe that this tiny boat is battered by 40 foot waves, turned over, submerged, and spit out like a cork, yet no one falls out of the boat or drowns. During the rescue, the sailors have to dive into freezing cold water where you would die in minutes from hypothermia, but once in the boat, no one is so much as shivering. On the way back from the rescue,  the ocean Disney-magically dies down--there are no waves and the harbor has barely a ripple. I think the film lost an opportunity. As any Everest climber will tell you--it's one thing to reach the summit---it's quite another to get BACK. Instead of focusing on a pointless love story,  it would have made it a much more interesting movie to show how this tiny boat overloaded with people managed to survive, through the waves, swamped with that much weight. Casey Affleck--who is usuaally a wonderful actor--is wasted here. I don't know Chris Pine's work and he may be be a good actor, but gives an unmemorable performance.  I would not  pay full price for this movie, but if you want a good sea disaster flick--the special effects are good.  And it has made me curious about the true story. Think I'll read the book!",1465862400,2,3178,4.437392795883362

7580263,3,B019PQ0NZG,As noted by other reviews this should have been an exciting recount of a true story. But only the sinking of the freighter seemed somewhat real and generated some tension - the rescue boat scenes did not reflect even vaguely realistic ocean or weather conditions. The acting and writing was wooden. Some suspense but mostly predictable plot -  the guy who dies pretty much was wearing a sign to that effect.

It sent out a sos for help commander at the small coast guard unit ordered a crew to go look for them. They only had a small patrol boat the man in charge knew the waves there and told him it would be impossible to get pass the breaks but was told he had his orders. It was snowing heavy and pitch dark. In the mean time on the ship the Captain and his officers are well you will see.

  watching the newest coast guard ships go out in severe weather in their roll over boats made this movie all the more exciting... were they brave, crazy or just clueless as to what was in store for them out there?  these boats are made for rescue, but those conditions were so much more severe than was expected.  in our modern times, the boats go over those huge waves with design and power.  if they get caught and roll over, since everyone is strapped in their seats and the boats totally sealed, it just pops up and is ready to tackle the waves again.
  in this movie, it just did not seem possible, but it did happen...kudos to those brave or crazy guardsmen for the rescue.  modern technology had to start somewhere...this was a great movie to showcase how brave those coast guard people are in these terrible weather conditions...
it was an exciting movie, but those accents were sometimes hard to understand...",1465603200,,926,4.638036809815951

7580295,3,B019PQ0NZG,"I was surprised to see so many very positive reviews here.  I was hoping for another Perfect Storm, and I'm sure it was that comparison that was used to sell this project to the investors, but if you are hoping for another film of that caliber, you will be very disappointed.  First, films need to have the sound re-engineered when put to DVD.  I couldn't understand many of the lines, although I had the sound cranked up on an expensive soundbar system.  I'm sure my neighbors appreciated hearing all the engine noises, however.  There were a few cheesy fake New England accents which didn't help either.

The characters were simplistic and overdrawn.  Painfully so.

Some of the technical issues needed to be explained more.  Would have added more authenticity to the film. On and on about the problem with a ""bar.""  I guess they mean sandbar, right?  And how did the boat get back in over the bar at the end?  I think it was indicated that they somehow got over with just a small wave hitting them, which we see on camera without any explanation, but again the dialogue was so difficult to hear, that I'm not sure that is what was meant.  None of this is explained.  Nor how the crew of the tanker managed to  steer the back half of the ship.  They jury rigged something, but it would have been interesting to understand better how that was done exactly.

I'm sure some of the ocean scenes were expensive to shoot, but apart from that, this was more like  a TV movie.  Too bad.  There is nothing more exciting than a good maritime adventure.",1465603200,,1544,4.505415162454874

7580325,5,B019PQ0NZG,"An amazing true story of a USCG Search and Rescue Operation in 1952.  The heroic courage and steadfast determination  of a Boatswain Mate and his crew to fight one of Chatman, Ma.'s worst storm in its history.  Their mission is to save the lives of men trapped on a tug boat split in half in the deep waters.  With only hours to reach them the intensity of emotions builds for the viewer as high as the sea bar and swells that the crew are tenaciously trying to get through in hopes of making the rescue. The ferocious sea is relentless!  But not as much as the Boatswain Mate with the USCG training and determination to rescue these men.

This is a movie that defines the USCG.
It depicts a depth of courage, heroism and character deeper than the ocean.

The movie touches your heart with the entwined romance between the Boardwain Mate and his fiance, the strong comaraderie of crew mates and a community that pulls together to drive them home to safety.

A must see. A definite movie to buy and share with family and friends.

Coastguardsman Bernie Webber pilots his small 36 foot boat , with three crew members aboard, through enormous seas and howling winds to rescue the survivors of a disaster: a tanker had split in half !

I'm sorry I missed this in the theater as it would have been much better visually on a large screen. Generally based on the book, ""The Finest Hours"" and Bernie Webber's own book, "" Into a raging Sea"" ( both available on Amazon), the movie tries to show the heroism of the Coasties. Unfortunately, the movie fails to fully translate the events from the books onto the screen. In addition, it takes unnecessary liberties with the facts to inject romantic angles that didn't exist in reality.

Is it worth viewing? ABSOLUTELY! Too often we equate heroism with war and killing . Here we see real heroes dedicated to saving others regardless of the danger they themselves face.",1465430400,,952,4.728915662650603

7580367,1,B019PQ0NZG,"Based on the true story of the greatest small boat rescue in the history of the USCG, ""The Finest Hours"", was certainly not an enjoyable way to spend 2 of my precious hours. It starts off with a 'clunky' love story where Chris Pine acts like 15 yr old on his first date. His performance only gets worse after that as we move onto our story of a tanker at sea needing rescue. Nobody in this film seems to have any backbone; everybody makes decisions in a wimpy ""I guess so"" kind of way. Eric Bana (so great in Munich) is awful as the Coast Guard Commander, and Casey Affleck is no better as the passive, ""leave me alone"" leader of the tanker ship breaking up in the Atlantic. Its a Disney production so it has no nudity or profanity which is all fine and good. But no amount of CGI can compensate for lousy acting and a dumb script no matter heroic the underlying story is. This film was god-awful in my view.  .",1465257600,5,911,4.2057142857142855

7580408,4,B019PQ0NZG,"Having served in the Coast Guard in the '50s and been through several storms, especially one as bad if not worse than this one, I feel that the film makers did a fine job in capturing the realism of the sea in the midst of a terrible storm, catching both the surging force, shape, and power of the overly wildly turbulent waters. Yes, there were activities on board the ships that were not at all plausible, that could not and cannot really take place, getting around on deck for instance, but some of the realism had to give way for the story and for the finally impossible to put by seductive power of Hollywood conventions. For example, I did not like the changes made from the original circumstances as captured in the book from which the film was derived, the at times cutesy wife (changed to fianc&eacute;) story, for example. However the film adhered convincingly to what truly happened, with the film convention additions enforcing the focus and spirit of the great struggle to survive despite nature's implacable will and mankind's conflict with its own turbulent struggle brought on by an errant mind and imperfect heart.",1465171200,2,1131,4.775510204081633

7580506,5,B019PQ0NZG,"My Grandfather was a lighthouse keeper in the United States Coast Guard and I currently live in Massachusetts. This incident happened before I was born and I had never heard about the Pendleton and this major open sea rescue.

There aren't a lot of movies made about the United States Coast Guard, so I put this movie on my to watch list.

I realize this story has been Disneyfied and that the movie isn't completely historically accurate but it's still worth watching. The scenes between Miriam and the commanding officer are completely fictional. Miriam was really at home with the flu. There were a few other things portrayed in the movie that aren't historically accurate as well, but the main idea of the movie is correct. These men went out, they saved people from a sinking half broken ship. They were heroic.

Casey Affleck really does a great job in this movie. He's not his usual I'm from Boston wise guy that is basically the same character in every movie since Good Will Hunting.

Chris Pine isn't his over confident Captain Kirk character. He is vulnerable and I believed he was scared. It was nice to see him play a very different kind of action star.

I was happy that the makers of the film showed real pictures of everyone involved.

I was able to watch this with all the members of our family, there was no nudity, sex, or violence. Obviously, people drowned but it's not shown like in Titanic.

7580508,2,B019PQ0NZG,"This movie suffers from overuse of CGI.  There was so much CGI that I half expected to see some hobbits on the sinking ship.  But the least realistic part of the movie was how the sailors responded to orders.  When told to tie up boats, Chris Pine wanders around then goes to the mess hall and gets soup.  When told to go save lives, Chris Pine goes to the mess hall and has coffee.  This is how millennials follow orders I guess.

Casey Affleck is supposed to be a good actor. He is for sure an A #1 mumbler.  I gave up trying to understand what he said.  Both Chris Pine and Casey Affleck play characters that are extreme introverts.

I think the water is cold in Miami Beach in the summer but nobody in the movie gets cold when they swim around in north Atlantic waters and ride around in small boats in the middle of a blizzard.

The movie loses continuity when, 3/4 thru the movie, we see the light from the lighthouse but at the end of the movie, they have to rely on the car's headlights to show the sailors where the harbor is.  This movie is neither consistent or - because of the overuse of CGI - believable.",1464998400,2,1118,4.2018779342723

This is based on the true story of a disaster at sea and the Coast Guard response which was equally extraordinary.  I never heard of this event before, and is very interesting to see the film adaptation.

The only place where I feel like the movie wasn't so good is the love story angle.  There seems to be a trend where movies that take place in the past (in the 50s in this case) have to insert a minority or female character behaving completely contrary to the standards of the day.  That is great when it moves the story along.  But in this case, it doesn't seem to serve a purpose other than to appeal to modern sensibilities.

Aside from that, great movie though.",1464825600,,760,4.309859154929577

Something my dad would watch, as he is an avid boat and water lover (he has passed this on to me), and he is extraordinarily picky about movies.  If you want a movie that is exciting, uplifting, and without the foul language and nudity that so many movies so sadly portray these days, this is definitely a great choice.

Overall the movie is entertaining and suspenseful.  Certainly worth a rental!  That said, the acting was fair, the accents really varied and did not reflect post WWII Chatham, Mass.  Also the attitude of the towns people, fishermen and Coast Guard were a bit off, they have always been very galvanized as a people, their livelihood depends on the water, fishing, tourism, etc.  You wouldn't know any of this unless you had lived on Cape Cod.  Additionally, the weather depicted during the storm is not at all what it looks like in real life, it's much rougher, windier and with very little visibility.  Obviously there are many similarities to The Perfect Storm, if you liked that film you will probably like this one.",1464739200,,867,4.74

7580647,5,B019PQ0NZG,"Thank you Disney for sending us this Blu-ray to review!

The Finest Hours is based on a true story and is considered to be the most heroic rescue in Coast Guard history.  The main character, Bernie Weber (Chris Pine), is a Coast Guard crewman who follows the rulebook and knows all of the regulations.  Hes very familiar with the ocean and knows how dangerous the bar can be to cross during nice weather let alone during a severe winter storm.  When he was sent to assist the crew of the SS Pendleton, which split in half on February 18th, 1952, he did not hesitate knowing full well that this was a suicide mission.  It was up to Bernie and his crew to attempt to rescue the stranded men since all of the other Coast Guard ships were assisting another split oil tanker, the SS Fort Mercer.

The tiny rescue boat defied all odds and reached the SS Pendleton despite missing crucial navigational equipment.  The next hurdle was bringing the thirty-two rescued men to safety on a boat thats designed to carry twelve.  Some tough decisions had to be made, but they paid off in the end.  I won't spoil any of the details because I recommend watching this thrilling movie.

Although The Finest Hours is a Disney movie, it is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of peril.  There are some deaths and injuries shown and one of the characters cusses (d*mn).  Other than those issues, this movie is safe for most audiences.

The acting was good and I recognized some of the actors in this film.  There were some blue visual artifacts and other inconsistencies that I noticed, but they didn't detract from the story in any way.  For example, sometimes Bernies nose would be pink from the cold and a few frames later it was back to normal and then suddenly pink again.

In the end I highly recommend checking out The Finest Hours.  It has a lot of intense action and edge of the seat moments, but there is also a love story in there too.",1464566400,,1923,4.4798850574712645

7580649,3,B019PQ0NZG,"If you are looking for sensational scenes of a small boat in large seas similar to ""The Perfect Storm"", this movie will not deliver. In fact, there are times when the seas are unusually calm for an event that took place during one of the worst storms in New England history. This movie disappointed me on several levels. The main one being the lack of storm special effects. Another being the lack of emotion of the characters. They all acted like they were on Xanax and their faces were frozen with botox. Rent it if you want but this will not be a memorable survival at sea movie.",1464566400,,582,4.398148148148148

7580654,5,B019PQ0NZG,THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE.....NOT LIKE THE JUNK MOVIES THEY NOW  IMPOSE ON US NOW!  !!!,1464480000,,82,4.0625
7580655,4,B019PQ0NZG,"I really didn't know much about this movie prior to watching or the true story that this is based but I am surprised after watching that this didn't do better in theaters than it did.  Maybe with the release of In the Heart Of The Sea with its similar ocean survival tale, a few weeks prior to this really hurt its overall potential, I am not sure.

Based on an event in the 50s, the movie really does a nice job at recreating the feel of the time with both the look and music soundtrack.  Although this movie centers around the main characters of Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) and Ray Sybert (Casey Aflleck) this movie really has a great supporting cast that includes Ben Foster, Eric Bana and Holliday Grainger, who all plays their respective roles very well.  Grainger with her costuming and makeup really has the aura of tough minded 50s girl.  Pine and Affleck are also good in their respective roles.

The special effects are well done and look and feel very realistic.  The storyline may have that typical rescue at sea feel but being based on a true story, it makes this a bit more acceptable as the story is both interesting and exciting to watch.  This movie is to me underrated and definitely worth watching.

This is the true story of the miraculous rescue of more than 30 men stranded aboard the USS Pendleton off the coast of New England in February of 1952. It is still considered the most heroic small boat rescue in Coast Guard history.
I really enjoyed this movie - aside from some liberties regarding the timeline of Bernie and Miriam's relationship, the movie stays pretty true to the facts. There probably could have been more of a sense of urgency among the townspeople as they awaited word about the mission but the action out on the water was riveting. Amazing special effects and great acting, especially from Casey Affleck and many of the supporting actors. I know some critics panned Chris Pine as Bernie (who had originally planned to be a minister prior to joining the Coast Guard) but I thought he did a great job playing a man who by all accounts was humble and soft spoken.
Knowing that the storyline with Miriam was the least factual, I do think it detracted from the suspense of the movie but overall this is a great depiction of this historic rescue.",1464393600,,1166,4.610576923076923

I found myself drawn into researching more about the rescue and Bernie Webber.  Then you find out the actual event was even more heroic than the movie had really created.  Read the actual Coast Guard reports.  In the movie, from the time Mr Webber and team get into the boat, to go rescue the Pendleton crew, the movie follows the actual rescue almost to the letter.

For example the movie shows how operators used to transfer phone calls. I liked how the movie has a strong female character who goes out for what she wants and isn't afraid to step up.

This is a good movie and for the most part I did enjoy it but it was lacking something the Perfect Storm had; drama and emotion. The fact that this is a true story helps a little and does add something but to me this was just a little to generic and ""Disney-fied"" to have any real punch. That hurt the movie for me.

7580692,5,B019PQ0NZG,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

The sixties delivered to us something that was fresh and new at the time, the rise of the anti-hero. This would be someone of lesser moral compulsion who usually took the wrong way to do the right thing. While it was fresh and new at the time in more recent years its become the norm rather than the exception. So when a movie offers good old fashioned heroes its nice to see. When those characters are based on real life people it becomes inspiring.

Based on the true story of the 1952 rescue of the crew of the SS Pendleton, the movie doesnt just cover the rescue itself but the men involved as well. Chris Pine stars as Bernie Webber, a Coast Guard crewman in Chatham, Massachusetts whos shy, quiet and dealing with a tragedy that happened a year ago under his watch. Meeting with Miriam (Holliday Grainger), a phone operator hes been talking to for some time now, the two begin dating and reach a point where they make plans to get married. All Bernie thinks he needs to do is get permission from his commanding officer.

But before that can happen a terrible storm sets in and two different oil tankers split in half. The crew of the SS Pendleton watch in fear as the front half of their ship plunges beneath the surface with all who were aboard that half of the ship. Still in control of the engines but dealing with a crack in the ship thats allowing water to build up, head engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) directs them to rig a way to steer by hooking girders into the rudder. Its slow but gives them enough control that they head for the nearest shoal with the hope of grounding the ship until help can arrive.

Back on shore at the Coast Guard station one boat sets out to help with the rescue of the first ship. As the only one left behind to command a second ship towards the Pendleton, Bernie takes on three other crew members and heads for the ship. With winds blowing and waves reaching over 70 feet in height, Bernie and his crew also have to deal with what is known as the bar, a series of shoals that are treacherous to go through even under the best of circumstances and the cause of his defeat the previous year. As the small boat and crew make their way through this deadly option viewers will sit in awe and fear gripping the arms of your seat waiting to see the outcome.

These two tales intertwine to make an incredibly suspenseful film. A third plotline of Miriam attempting to deal with the fact that the man she just agreed to marry is in harms way and may not make it back to shore. She deals with his commanding officer, the folks on shore she is now getting to know and the family of members who were lost the previous year under similar circumstances. All three stories combine to move the film forward and to intensify the action on screen.

Not knowing the outcome of the movie or having read about this event I was sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen. The severed boat could go down with all on board or at least a large percentage of them wouldnt survive. The small vessel captained by Webber could find itself in even more disastrous circumstances and no one onboard that ship might make it back. And Miriam could find herself a widow before the marriage even took place. All of these concepts are tossed around much like the ships in the high rising swells of waves on screen but by the end of the film all are resolved.

The most refreshing thing about this movie was that it played out like a classic heroic movie of the past, where black and white good guys and bad were easily identifiable. What these men went through is truly heroic and depicts the Coast Guard in a way that will make you never consider them a low level branch of the military ever again. This is a film that young people should be sat down to watch, giving them a chance to see an example of that old school greatest generation of our time at work. And the fact is that other than the amount of suspense found on screen here its a movie that kids could watch as well with no foul language or exposed body parts as well. Who would think that in todays age that was even possible any longer!

Pine does an amazing job here displaying acting talents that for me haven't been seen before, at least not in the depth that he offers here. Affleck turns in another great performance as well as the man doing his best to save his crew while dealing with those who are willing to look for shortcuts towards survival that he knows will only result in death. The movie is an inspiration and one that, as I stated, needs to be seen. It didn't do as expected at the box office and thats sad as good a movie as it is. Perhaps that will change with the release of the film on DVD. I can only hope so. Take the plunge and watch this one today.",1464134400,,4826,4.307268722466961
7580693,4,B019PQ0NZG,"This was a film that I originally saw in theaters.  I liked it, and wanted to add it to my Blu-ray/Digital collection so I could re-watch it and share it with friends and relatives, but I couldn't make myself give this more than 4 out of 5 stars in my post-theater review.  I don't find myself driven to change that rating (for the film) here, but do like that the Blu-ray offers several bonuses, especially deleted scenes and the other bonuses, including Against All Odds: The Bernie Webber Story featurette.

In my original review, I used some words such as these:  (edited slightly here) I went and caught this (in theatre) today. I found it to be fairly enjoyable, though I would have liked a little less of the love story and a bit more of the drama. Perhaps it should have just been a little longer so the love story didn't get shortened in exchange for more of the drama. I would caution that the movie tends to be a bit dark and hard to see things as clearly as you might wish. Given that the events occur mostly at night, in dark water, this should be expected, but it does leave you straining a little to find the tiny object you want to follow as it perhaps gets shoved around by the wind and seas. Well worth watching, though I can't say this is 5 stars for me.

My original quick review also had noted the following: If you can catch it at matinee pricing, it should be easily worth that. Oh, I'm told by others that the 3D is really not worth it, so I wouldn't spend extra to see it in 3D.  There was no apparent 3D Blu-ray release for this one, so you can ignore that comment for sure.  The matinee pricing doesn't really apply to the Blu-ray or DVD release either, though I suppose that isn't quite true as it should perhaps be re-worded to say if you can find this on sale, it becomes a better bargain.

Those with family that are in the coast guard will find extra value here, and those that enjoy ""based on true stories"" will also enjoy this a bit more, though I should be careful to note that ""based on a true story"" doesn't mean that there hasn't been some creative license with the story.  For the actual story, doing some research on the interwebs would be a good thing.  The story here is close enough to enjoy and have an appreciation for what happened in the actual events, but I would also like to know the actual true story and enjoy stories such as this one when they are closer to the actual events.

Rated PG-13, this is a family friendly tale, but it is tense, dramatic, and at times, as noted in my original comments above, hard to see.  The dark night, rain and storminess means a dark screen throughout much of this film.  Finding the relatively small craft on the screen is difficult at times and really can't be helped, again because of the size and scope of what is going on in the film.

Chris Pine does a good job in his role as the hero, as does Casey Affleck.  Christian Bale doesn't get much screen time, and time he does have leaves us all thinking that his character was not a great leader.  Whether that was actually true or not will depend on the results of the research you do about the actual events.  Holliday Grainger does well enough with her role, though she seems to be a bit strong for the era that she was portraying and that may have added to my own frustrations with the love story aspect of the film.  While I didn't mind that portion of the film that much, I can't say I didn't find myself wishing for more of the drama of the rescue or the efforts just to stay alive and less of the concern of the heartsick lover who may have seen her bethrowed for the last time.

In the end, I like the film, and that leaves me at the 4 stars just for the film.  The Blu-ray is a nice one, but I had hopes perhaps for more bonus materials.  Oddly enough, though I originally stayed away from the 3D in theatres, I would actually have sprung for 3D for the home release if it had been available (now that I have a 3D capable TV in the home, it isn't as wasteful to me as it used to be).",1464048000,3,4032,4.217165149544863
7580694,5,B019PQ0NZG,"I love a good suspenseful action packed thriller so I was really looking forward to The Finest Hours which is out on DVD today! There is something about knowing that it's based on a true story that ads to the excitement of it all!

I had a little bit of a difficult time getting into it at first. I always have a hard time connecting with movies that take place in a different time period I can't relate to. It wasn't long however until I was pulled into the story of Bernie and Miriam.

There was an instant shift in the tone of the movie as soon as we see the tanker on the sea in an awful storm. I could just feel the tension.

When the tanker breaks apart in the storm, understandable chaos ensues. An unlikely leader named Sybert played by Casey Affleck steps forward to take control when the captain is gone.

The coast guard boat driven by Bernie played by Chris Pine was more stressful to me than the tanker they were going to rescue! That got my heart pounding like crazy and I was on the edge of my seat the rest of the movie!

It was a relief when it would shift back to what was happening on land to get a break from the stress of it all!

In the face of crisis leaders emerge and unlikely heroes do what no one else has the strength to do. We see two heroes emerge in The Finest Hours that will inspire you!

7580704,4,B019PQ0NZG,"Director: Craig Gillespie

Screenwriter: Scott Silver

Cast: Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Eric Bana, and Holliday Grainger

Disney has a way of producing some of the most formulaic live-action films that you just cant avoid liking.  Films like McFarland, USA, Tomorrowland, Cinderella, and now The Finest Hours are primary examples of the old adage, If it aint broke, don't fix it.

The Finest Hours tells the story of a courageous Coast Guard team who risk their lives to save the crew of a wrecked oil tanker off the coast of Cape Cod during a historic blizzard in 1952.  Chris Pine plays Bernie Webber, a shy but dependable coastguardsman looking for redemption after a failed rescue some years earlier, which resulted in the death of his friend and fellow coastguardsman.  After an oil tanker is torn apart by hurricane force winds, Webber is ordered by his commander (Eric Bana) to organize a crew and navigate out to the last known location of the tanker.  With weather conditions preventing any large vessels from heading out to sea, Webber and his crew, which includes Richard Livesey (Ben Foster), Ervin Maske (John Magaro), and Andy Fitzgerald (Kyle Gallner), head out in a small 12-man rescue boat to brave the seas and attempt the rescue.

What makes this film rise above the standard adventure/rescue fare is that while the plot I have revealed sounds relatively entertaining, I have not even gotten to the story involving the split oil tanker.  Director Craig Gillespie and writer Scott Silvers decision to feature a balanced story between the rescue and the tanker crew was the films highlight.  Lead by engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck), the films most exciting and powerful scenes revolve around the tanker crews battle to stay afloat whilst waiting for rescue.  Affleck steals the film with a performance far better than a film like this would have you expect.

The Finest Hours does drag one anchor in its wake and thats the romantic plot between Webber and his fianc, Miriam (Holliday Grainger).  This film is based on true events and Bernie and Miriams story are part of those events, but their relationship feels very cool and isolated.  What could have been played out as a strong love story where passion for life plays as a thread throughout the entire film, is surprisingly snuffed out in the scenes between Pine and Grainger.  Furthermore, Eric Banas portrayal as Commander Cluff is very uneven and at the end I was left confused as to what to think of him.

Still, The Finest Hours is a perfectly enjoyable slice of historic adventure.  These types of films rarely reach for the stars, but they are just good enough to be worthy of an audience. The story at this films core is one that was destined to find its way to the silver screen, and in most instances, it is executed very well.  While Pine is serviceable as the films hero, it is Affleck who is the standout and practically makes this film worth seeing all on his own.  B

7580712,4,B019PQ0NZG,"They always told us:  ""You have to go out; you don't have to come back"".  How the effect of that statement varies from sailor to sailor, maybe depending on their age (most in their 20's), their operational function on the lifeboat, and prior experiences of a crewmember in a rescue-at-sea situation.  Bernard Webber (played by Chris Pine)  certainly had a lot on his mind when, at the order of Warrant Officer Daniel Cluff (Eric Banna, with a Coast Guard regulation haircut), he and his crew were sent out in a severe winter storm to rescue the surviving crew of the oil tanker SS Pendleton, waiting for a miracle on the deck of the back half (the Pendleton's front, or ""forward"" half had gone down, taking the crew on that portion with it).  Besides the storm and heaving seas, there was that (single) gasoline engine, prone to sputtering & stopping at the worst moments, just when the crew needed it.  Webber and his crew were aware of their mission and its hazards & dangers, made more poignant when Cluff, with other less hazardous options, chose the option which is now history.  The social situation at the station, however, shined as the new sweetheart of Webber, Miriam (Holliday Grainger) pleaded with Cluff repeatedly, in a calm, rational manner, to cancel the mission (""please, call them back""), to no avail.  In 1952 an outsider's (Miriam's) opinion was doubly disregarded as a non-member as well as being a woman (what do they know?).  It was Miriam, too, setting the headlights of her 1947 Desoto shining out toward the sea, creating a ""chain of headlights"" for the 33-foot Coast Guard rescue boat, carrying crew & survivors totaling three times its capacity.  Miriam got her man back, married him according to Coast Guard regulations and approval, living a long, happy life together.

7580714,2,B019PQ0NZG,"When it comes to military movies the Coast Guard is nearly always given the short end of the oar compared to their land-based bretheren.  While they've often been a subplot in a larger story, films dedicated solely to the Coast Guard's heroic exploits are few and far between, which puts Disney's The Finest Hours in rare company. The film, directed by Craig Gillespie and starring an able-bodied cast affecting their best New England accents, centers on the 1952 Pendletonrescue mission, what many deem their greatest rescue effort ever, one that saw the men involved awarded for their life-saving efforts. But the film fails to live up to that herculean standard, drowning in a sea of coastal cliches and an odd decision to focus everywhere but the rescue.

Taking cues from everything from The Perfect Storm to Pearl Harbor, the film is exactly what one would think a Disney version of this story would be, some of that for the better, most of it for the worse. While it looks incredible, you'll feel waterlogged just watching it, the characters are flatly heroic and thus totally uninteresting.  Chris Pine, who can nearly always be counted on to play flatly heroic and uninteresting characters, plays real-life Coast Guardsman Bernard Webber. When we first meet him he's engaged in an ""awww shucks how cute"" blind date with his soon-to-be fiance, Miriam (Holliday Grainger). She's feisty, doesn't really do anything by the book. In fact, she asks him to marry her. But Webber, he's all about following the rules, even though it hasn't really gotten him anywhere. The other guardsmen, and the locals in this small coastal community, still remember a rescue he couldn't mount a year earlier, one that cost men their lives.  He could barely get out of shore.

A chance at redemption arrives in the form of a powerful nor'easter that cracks in half a tanker ship near Cape Code. The only one with the guts to go out into the perfect storm to make a rescue is Webber, along with a small hand-picked crew (Ben Foster, Kyle Gallner, John Magaro) who don't have the most confidence in the captain of their little speederboat. And that is really what the screenplay, penned by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson, is all about; Webber's redemption in the eyes of the people.  Most of the film concerns itself with whether or not Webber can get beyond the powerful swells and reach the sinking tanker, but it doesn't make for a very compelling tale just to have their boat pass some arbitrary point in the water. There isn't much conflict between Webber and his crew of seamen, either, and even less  among the men on the downed vessel where there should be the most. Casey Affleck plays the one man on the ship everyone trusts, but he probably would have been better suited in Pine's role. He deserves more than listening to the ship's creaking hull below deck. The same goes for Eric Bana who does little but bark orders over a radio, at least when he's not admonishing Miriam for worrying about her husband.  If you figured this was one of those films where the concerned woman waits at the pier for her man's ship to come into port, then you'd be exactly right.

The problems with The Finest Hours aren't technical, but there are only so many crashing waves one can watch before it grows tiresome. There just isn't much variety in the cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe, who fills the screen with one gigantic wave after another. It's a little hard to believe that a boat as tiny as Webber's could withstand waves that look like they were sent to swallow the entire Earth, but that little bit of fantasy is a much needed life preserver in an otherwise uninspired film.",1455667200,9,3679,4.74491392801252
7580715,4,B019PQ0NZG,"I mostly liked this film, even if there were parts which could be improved. I am a little bit surprised that it underperformed so badly at box office  I think it deserved a somehow better fate. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This is a quite faithful reconstruction of true events, which took place on 18 February 1952 near New England coast. During a severe storm two large tankers, SS ""Fort Mercer"" and SS ""Pendleton"", found themselves almost simultaneously in great peril. The mission to assist the latter became, very deservedly, a legendary event and is still considered as US Coast Guard ""finest hour"". The exploit was even greater considering that it was accomplished by only four Coast Guard sailors I will not say more about the story and if you want to enjoy this film fully, I advise not to research it prior to the viewing.

The strong point of the film is everything that happens on sea  fortunately, it is the largest part of the story. I don't usually care for 3D, even in IMAX, but this time I made an exception and I am mightily glad that I did. Sea sequences are GRANDIOSE and I was absolutely impressed by them. The UNIMAGINABLE STRENGTH of the ocean is shown in all its glory and terrifying beauty! The struggle of badly damaged SS ""Pendleton"" and the tiny Coast Guard motor lifeboat ""CG36500"" against the fury of elements is a GREAT SHOW and it is shown in length and in detail. Kudos for all the sea sequences!

Sadly, the things which happen on land, are not on the same level  far from it. The ""romance"" between the main hero, Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) and his girlfriend, Miriam Pentinen (Holliday Grainger) is as unromantic as possible  in fact slightly embarrassing by moments. Total fail for the ""romance"".

Chris Pine, in my opinion, is a bad actor - his acting is as wooden as his name  and here this sad fact is made even worse by the scenario choices, which totally castrated and metrosexualized his character. In 1952 the real Bernie Webber was only 24 years old, but he already lived A LOT! During WWII, when still underage, he served on merchant ships, worked hard and sailed the U-Boats infested waters of Atlantic  this experience helped him when he joined US Coast Guard in 1946,  immediately after his 18th birthday. In 1952 he was therefore already a highly experienced veteran, trusted with the command of a motor lifeboat in bad storms. In this film however he is shown as a shy, insecure, slightly bumbling rookie. There is not even one moment, not even one ounce of pride and firmness (not even talking of swagger and cockiness), which should be expected from a man who already lived and accomplished so much, braving great danger, when still possessing the full vigour and joy of youth. Honestly, I found Chris Pine in this film annoying.

Even worse things were done to the secondary character of Daniel W. Cluff, the head of Chatham station of US Coast Guard and therefore Webber's commanding officer. He is played by Eric Bana, a very good actor, but who was put by the scenario in a straightjacket. In 1952 the real Cluff was, at 36, a highly competent battle scarred veteran. He joined US Coast Guard in 1936 and immediately took service on motor lifeboats  for next 13 years. During WWII as many other Coast Guard sailors, he served in Pacific War, especially in Guadalcanal campaign in 1942 - he led some rescue operations not only during storms but even under enemy fire. At the moment of his promotion to chief of Chatham Station in 1950 he was amongst the most experienced and most respected lifeboats operators in the whole service.  In the film however he is portrayed as a rather pathetic character  mocked and not trusted by his subordinates, insecure, borderline incompetent, he is the kind of guy who couldn't find his own butt even with a map, the GPS and a local scout. I completely cannot understand why the scenario so completely demolished this character.

To not be entirely negative, it must be said that one character was spared and the actor playing it  did a great job - Casey Affleck, who plays Ray Sybert, the chief machinist on board of SS ""Pendleton"". Unlike other real characters, his was not demolished by the scenario, he was allowed to play it as he wanted and it shows. Good job Mr Affleck!

More generally, the powerful, moving, heroic nature of the whole event is totally downplayed in the film, especially by the soundtrack. For most of time it is so discreet that we cannot notice it. It is audible however at the end, at the most moving moment  but the choice for it  was amazingly bad. It is the kind of music one could expect from a Terrence Malick film about a guy who boils soup and is pondering whether he really boils soup or is the soup boiling him Yes, it is that kind of soundtrack

In conclusion, this film is made of two very different parts. Everything on the ocean is SPLENDID  almost everything of what happens on land is poor. For that reason it is a 3,5 stars film, which is a pity because it could have been and should have been a much better thing. I am very glad that I saw it  but as the best parts probably will not as great on TV screen, I will probably not buy it on DVD.",1455667200,4,5208,4.570354457572503

7580717,4,B019PQ0NZG,"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Finest Hours""

1. This movie, based on the book of the same name, tells the true story of the 1952 Coast Guard Rescue of crewmen aboard the SS Pendleton, which split in half during a storm in New England.

2. It focuses mostly on Chris Pine, who plays Bernie, a very simple Coast Guard crewman, who falls in love with a town girl, Miriam. The agree to get married, but then a storm hits and Bernie has to go out and rescue a bunch of people, while Miriam sticks at home and worries.

3. There are three stories going on here. Two of them are interesting: the efforts of a crew of a broken ship to stay alive, and the efforts of the Coast Guard to reach them. The script does a good job of providing enough backstories to make you care about the guys.

4. I don't want to say the movie is a little sexist, but... the movie is a little sexist. The third story focuses on Miriam. She knows what she's getting into by marrying a Coast Guard man. So it's really annoying that when he has to go do his job, she's more worried about her engagement than about the fact that men are dying on the ocean (in real life, they were already married, and she didn't wander around the town wailing about her man. She was home with the flu).

5. There is a lot of technical nautical language in the movie, and I didn't understand it all. But I still learned a lot about how ships and Coast Guard rescues happened in the 1950's.

6. The storm-and-ship action scenes are tense and exciting, although a few of the computer effects were showing.

7. One highlight of the film is Chris Pine. This is probably Pine's best performance of his career so far, playing a guy just a few steps above Forrest Gump, who is torn between following orders and thinking for himself. It's a huge change from being Captain Kirk.

8. The other highlight is Casey Affleck. Affleck is usually an indie actor, and not as well-known as he should be. He is superb here as Ray, the guy that runs the engines of the Pendleton. He has a weird quiet intensity that is perfectly appropriate for his role.

9. This movie doesn't really offer anything new in the way of storytelling, but the great acting and cool storms make this a pretty entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.",1455062400,3,2265,4.32311320754717
7580718,5,B019PQ0NZG,"If only 30% of this movie is accurate - it is amazing, one of the best survival stories since Shackleton.  Now for the acting, also extremely well done.  Casey Affleck shines in this and I am so glad because I have been waiting for him to get some fantastic roles.  Chris Pine is excellent as well because for once he isn't the shiny, perfect hero he usually is.  He plays those roles well but it was nice to see him as just an ordinary man who just happened to have extraordinary circumstances thrown at him.",1454976000,3,509,4.326315789473684
7580719,4,B019PQ0NZG,"The Finest Hours
 Heroic Coastguard men brave a hostile sea in a rescue attempt in a howling, raging storm off the coast of Massachusetts.  Well and good.  We know what will happen.  We have seen the like before.  This presents a major challenge for the movie makers how to make a watchable film when every one knows the eventual outcome.  But, good for us in the seats, Disney and director Craig Gillespie (he directed the recent ""Million Dollar Arm"") are up to the challenge.  This is a well done action/disaster film.  With no surprises.
 The special effects have now become so good that it is very hard to find the breaks between real life action and the computer generated reel life action, if I can say that.  The oil tanker in the film breaks in half, part of the crew go down with the bow section.  33 sailors remain in the sealed off and still floating aft section of the hull.  They know they will sink soon.  Four coast guardsmen set off to rescue the sailors in an absurdly small life boat, a tiny craft lost in waves the size of hills, big, fast moving dangerous hills.  The Coasties embody and live the saying ""The Coast Guard has to go out.  Nobody says we have to come back.""  It really is wonderful to see such courage in the pursuit of helping our fellow humans.
 Great special effects-not over done but always there before our eyes-so, what else?  Good solid acting on all counts.  Casey Affleck plays the reclusive engineering officer that manages to rally the sailors when they start to panic.  Chris Pine (Star Trek) vanishes in his role as the leading Coastguard man in the rescue boat.  Holliday Granger plays Pine's girl friend.  I know her best from her TV role as Lucrezia Borgia.  She is drop dead gorgeous and with 47 credits behind her is a solid and competent actress.  Supporting the lead actors are Ben Foster and Eric Bana.  Everyone adopts a thick Cape Cod accent successfully.  I liked this for reasons of authenticity in the pre-TV induced American standard accent and because it forced me to pay attention to hear what the actors said.
 Scott Silver led a gang of five writers.  Silver has an Oscar nomination but having five thumbs in the soup always presents problems.  Here, the different brains working on the screenplay seem to have helped one another rather than the opposite.
  ""The Finest Hours"", aptly named for a rescue that even after 60 years is showcased as the most difficult and successful small boat rescue in Coastguard history, gets an average but still heroic three saw blades.  It runs for one hour and 47 minutes with a mild PG-13 rating.  The producers lavished $80 million to make the film but the tepid $12 worldwide gross so far indicates that financially it might struggle to make ends meet.",1454284800,4,2755,4.614432989690721
7580720,5,B019PQ0NZG,"It is the winter of 1952.  An horrific storm has snapped a tanker in half off-shore, south of Cape Cod. Thirty or so sailors are clinging to the half of the tanker that didn't sink.  A four-man Coast Guard motor lifesaving boat departs Wellfleet harbor into the teeth of the storm in a seemingly suicidal rescue attempt. This is ""The Finest Hours"", a modest but incredibly moving thriller based on real life events.

Director Craig Gillespie takes his time getting to the disaster. We are introduced to Coast Guard Bosun's Mate First Class Bernie Webber (Chris Pine), the shy, by-the-book but stalwart commander of the rescue boat, as he navigates the shoals of a relationship with a local telephone operator. We meet his fellow Coast Guardsmen at the Station, including Chief Warrant Officer Cluff (Eric Bana), the Station Commander who will make the difficult decision to launch the rescue attempt, knowing the crew might not return. Once underway, the story proceeds along three tracks: the crew of the tanker as they struggle to keep afloat; the crew of the motor lifesaving boat as they fight their way out to sea, and family and friends sweating it out on shore.

The movie seems deliberately understated, but it wholeheartedly embraces its 1950's values. There aren't any grand speeches, just people trying to do their best, coping with disaster. The movie nicely captures a period New England fishing community. It would be a hard-hearted viewer who isn't in tears at certain points in the movie.
