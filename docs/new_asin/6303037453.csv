537471,5,6303037453,"This is one of the best movie remakes of a classic TV show that I have ever seen.  In the movie, the salt-of-the-earth Clampetts discover oil, get fabulously rich, and move to Beverly Hills.  Jed Clampett (played by Jim Varney) is in search of a wife to help raise Ellie Mae to be a real lady, but the family must beware of evil people who want to steal their wealth. Now, perhaps that sounds a little far fetched, but if you've ever met some simple folk who come into a lot of oil money, the whole story sounds very, very close to home.
The casting is superb -- there are cameo appearances by Dolly Parton, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Buddy Ebsen.  Lily Tomlin is hilarious as the familys secretary, and Jim Varney actually plays a very believable straight guy.  This movie has no sex, foul language, or violence, and will bring lots of laughs to the whole family.",1027987200,30,856,4.39873417721519
537472,2,6303037453,"This is the familiar parody in which a 60s/70s TV show takes place in the 90s, a formula utilized two years later in THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE. Film however suffers from very few laughs since the sitcom wasn't very funny to begin with, and there isn't enough story here to carry about two hours worth of film. It tells of Jed Clampett, a primitive old hillbilly who strikes oil in his old country household and decides to ""load up the truck and move to Beverly (Hills that is...swimming pools, movie stars). You can pretty much write the film after this.",987811200,,550,4.51
537473,4,6303037453,"I've gotta say first off, that I never liked the TV show at all...so when this movie came out in the early 90's, I didn't exactly rush out to see it.  First saw it on TV (there was nothing else on that night).  What a wonderful surprise!  The cast is uniformily excellent...they all stood out.  When we got the video, we watched it twice in one evening with the kids.  I loved Diedrich Bader as a hopelessly dimwitted Jethro; Lily Tomlin as a smitten but efficient Miss Jane Hathaway; Dabney Coleman was PERFECT as the investment banker; Rob Schnieder is at his weasily best (ya gotta love the part where he wrecks the entire office!) as the employee out to defraud Jed Clampett, who is played perfectly by the late great Jim Varney.  I thought the storyline - especially making Elly May into a teenager entering high school - was terrific!  Also who could forget the cameos by Buddy Ebsen and Zha Zha Gabor?  There are so many laughs, this is a film worth viewing again and again!
Like ""The Addams Family"" films, the movie remake of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" is superior to the TV show.  Highly recommended!",979430400,2,1108,4.555555555555555
537474,4,6303037453,"This movie was a great verson of the 60's sitcom.  The only person who  wasn't perfectly casted was the woman who played Ms. Hathaway, and even she  had very few flaws!  The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the guy  who sang the theam song.  He wasn't as good as the guy who did it in the  60's.",965606400,,302,3.933333333333333
537583,5,6303037453,"This was a replacement for my worn out VHS. Jim Varney was great in this role as Jed Clampet. A rare view of a more (slightly) serious side to the man. Cloris Leachman, who I typically don't like as an actress  was also surprising in her role as ""Granny"". Unlike most remakes, this version of The Beverly Hillbillies stayed reasonably true to the original TV series.",1498780800,,366,4.545454545454546

537588,4,6303037453,"I'm not usually one to laugh out loud during a movie, but this had me cracking up!  It's well worth the money for the enjoyment!  There is some mildly lude humor that I wish they had done without.

537668,3,6303037453,It probably depends on how big a fan you are of the original t.v. show.  As to how much you'll like this movie.  It's a lot like The Brady Bunch movie where they set the movie in modern times.  Jed is now a billionaire.  And Jim Varney is good as Jed.  And even does my favorite version of the song Hot Rod Lincoln.  But the rest of the cast isn't as good.  It's also got a good sound track.  And Buddy Ebsen as Barnaby Jones was a stroke of genius.  But this movie is okay every once in awhile.,1478563200,,495,3.919191919191919

So on the forget your troubles scale, the Beverly Hillbillies scores a perfect five out of five and can be easily forgotten if you're a diehard devotee to the television series.",1447891200,,549,4.851063829787234

538611,3,6303037453,"Released in 1993, The Beverly Hillbillies is a cinematic version of the hit TV series that ran for a decade from 1962-1971. The story details the family of hillbillies from the Ozarks striking it rich and moving to Beverly Hills where they're strangers in a strange land.

Ive never really watched the TV series, although Ive of course seen clips here and there. Unlike 1994s The Flintstones and 1995s The Brady Bunch Movie and their sequels, The Beverly Hillbillies isn't nearly as effective, not even close. The cast is good and there are amusing moments, but once the family moves to Southern California the story is uninvolving and you find yourself biding time waiting for the next gag. Sometimes its downright bad, but theres enough good to glean for a mildly fun time. Lily Tomlin, Erika Eleniak, Lea Thompson and Leann Hunley are enjoyable.

The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Beverly Hills, Pasadena and Los Angeles, CA.

This movie however adds something more to the plot, an attempted embezzlement led by a bank tycoon (Rob Schneider) and his girlfriend (Lea Thompson). With an ensemble cast featuring Jim Varney, Deidrich Bader, Chloris Leachman, Erika Elineak and Lily Tomlin. This movie is downright fun, and despite several flip offs it's good family fun.

She was brought up in the mountains with the love and support of every down home person that came into their lives. It became a lesson for Hollywood to learn from such down home folk.

 But that's the ONLY good comment I can make regarding this film.  As others have stated, the people who made this movie had no real understanding of the original TV show.  Jed was uneducated but wise and absolutely incorruptable.  Jethro was a dumb but very likeable character who approached every new interest with wild enthusiasm.  He was dumb but never silly.  The Jethro in this movie was so silly as to be unwatchable.  Ellie Mae was always pure and sweet.  In this movie they have her chewing tobbaco and spitting on people.  It was offensive to call this actress Ellie Mae.  Grannie wasn't too bad but still not close to the original.  I supsect this movie will only appeal to the casual fan of the TV show - the people who saw it every now and then in re-runs but don't really know the characters.  I fail to see how anybody really familiar with the original could even sit through this.  The pitiful Jethro was the complete deal breaker for me.  Max Baer's Jethro was in my opinion equaled only by Don Knott's Barney Fife as one of the two greatest TV comedy characters.

JIM VARNEY as JED-SHOCKINGLY WELL DONE, and VERY ENDEARING!  I really wish he hadn't died, there's no telling what else he could have done.
CLORIS LEACHMAN as GRANNY-OH MY LORD, how is it possible to put into words WHAT A GREAT JOB SHE DID!  The word HILARIOUS just doesn't cut it!  Dare I say, SHE WAS A BETTER GRANNY THAT THE ORIGINAL, IRENE RYAN?  THERE, I SAID IT!  Whew, what a relief! I mean it too!
DEIDRICH BADER as JETHRO-VERY FUNNY!  DIFFERENT than Max Baer, for sure, but still VERY FUNNY!  Those big horse teeth really added to the redneck effect.  I really loved the part when he & his mom Pearl were flying down the road, and she asked him didn't he order the new brakes yet, and he said ""sure I did Maw, they're coming in next week""!  He was funny as Jethrine too, although maybe just a little too pretty (?) (best movie line:""C'MON CITY BOY, LET'S DANCE!"" I LOVE THAT!)
ERICA ELENIAK as ELLIE MAE-did a good job, pretty true to the character, although I couldn't get over how bushy her eyebrows were, but I guess that added to the hillbilly effect.  She is a VERY pretty lady.

It's good to see that the old TV series has not been forgotten.

Erika Eleniak as Elly Mae and Dabney Coleman as Mr. Drysdale do good jobs with what they have to work with.

Bad:

Jim Varney as Jed plays his part totally straight - no humor from the star of the famous ""Ernest..."" movies.

Cloris Leachman plays Granny well, but they give her nothing but silly slapstick comedy to do.

Diedrich Bader as Jethro plays a stupid idiot rather than a naive country boy.

Lily Tomlin as Jane Hathaway does a good job, but she hogs every scene she's in and looks dumb in a blonde wig.

Rob Schneider - why is he even IN the movie? His character should have been cut out all together.

Lea Thompson pretending to be a French tutor helping Elly Mae become a lady, just so she can get at Jed's money, is extremely ANNOYING.

He was ""shooting at some food"",as sung on the opening theme. ""And up thru the ground came a bubbling crude"",is the following line. ""Oil that is,black gold,Texas tea!"",is the following line. So Jed,his mother-in-law Daisy ""Granny"" Moses(Cloris Leachman),Jed's daughter Elly May(Erika Eleniak) and Jed's nephew Jethro Bodine(Diedrich Bader) all pack their belongings and head for beautiful Beverly Hills,California. Granny was very content in the Ozark Mountains where this family moved from. Their new next door neighbor is the family's banker Milburn Drysdale(Dabney Coleman). Unfortunately Milburn's wife Margaret couldn't stand Jed and his clan. She thought they were downgrading Beverly Hills. Lily Tomlin is Jane Hathaway,an employee at the Commerce Bank of Beverly Hills,where Milburn is president. Jane and Jethro are romantically involved at a few points in the film,just like the sitcom.

Rob Schneider,late of Saturday Night Live,and Lea Thompson are two devious business people who are out to get Jed's multi-million dollars. Thompson's character was engaged to Jed and at the wedding ceremony,her and her partner's plan is carried out. Then they are both arrested. Another memorable scene is where,when Jed and his clan are enroute to Beverly Hills,another driver ""flips the bird"" to them. Jed and his clan all do the same to another driver who verbally abused them. The only two survivors of the sitcom cast are Donna Douglas,who was Elly May, and Max Baer Jr. who was Jethro.

539091,4,6303037453,"This is one I save for time requiring sheer silliness with no observable traces of reality. I have to admit that it is a very contrived and predictable plot, but anything that is such an obvious spin-off of a fabulously popular television series would have a hard time being anything but derivative. Having said all that, I laughed all the way through the movie, and still chuckle thinking about a lot of the slapstick shtick used so liberally here.  The storyline has been updated to make it a bit more topical, and the characters as depicted in the movie are slightly more contemporary than their counterparts in the TV series. But they are just as refreshingly corny and ordinary, and sometimes that is such an invigorating act to watch that it seems liberating somehow.
The cast is uniformly terrific; the best is easily the late Jim Varney, showing surprising range in his star-turn recreating the Jed Clampett character in the shadow of the legendary Buddy Ebsen, who so many of us baby-boomers remember as being Jed Clampett.  Of course, Cloris Leachman shows why she is such a celebrated actress in her hilariously naughty portrayal of Granny, and Erika Eleniak gives a wonderfully corny interpretation of sexy but innocent Elly Mae, more interested in ?rasslin? than boys, and as quick to ?whup? those boys if they get our of line.
Also quite good is Diedrich Bader as Jethro (and also acting in drag as Jethro?s sister Jethrine, on the make and virtually unstoppable), as is Dabney Coleman as Mr. Drysdale, and a wonderful Lily Tomlin as Miss Hathaway. Of course, the villains are key in all this, and Rob Schneider and Lea Thompson spread their wings into comedic farce quite well. The scene with Thompson vamping Jed Clampett with her false French accent is hilarious for its ?shocking? unintended double-entendre, and is typical of how funny this movie is at times.  As I said earlier, I save it for comic relief when I really yearn for mindless yucks, and it never fails me. Come on down and take a dip in the cement pond. I reckon you?ll find it powerful entertaining. Enjoy!",1032134400,23,2090,4.78393351800554

7835059,1,6303037453,If I could give zero stars I would. I ordered this specifically for bushwhacked as my family loves this show but our copy was damaged. It arrived finally and I guess since its foreign sold it won't play in any dvd player( I tried five different players). So dissatisfied.,1514592000,,271,4.551020408163265
7835060,4,6303037453,"You can't replace the original cast of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", but if you're going to do a movie ""remake"", this is about as good as you could do.

Cloris Leachman channeled Irene Ryan to perfection.

Jim Varney didn't try to channel Buddy Ebsen, and that was for the best. It would have never worked. However, he captured the quiet and naive dignity of Jed Clampett very successfully.

Ellie May is probably the least challenging of the roles, and Erica Eleniak did a good job.

Dabney Coleman was the perfect ""type casting"" for Drysdale. All he had to do was give his normal sleazy businessman performance, and he delivered.

Lily Tomlin was a bit over the top as Jane Hathaway, but that's what you expect, and what you get, from Lily Tomlin.

The only casting I thought missed in big way was Diedrich Bader as Jethro. I just never bought his characterization.

The plot hit on several tropes from the early years of the TV show, and I enjoyed that:
* turning Ellie May into a lady
* Jed finding a mother for her
* unscrupulous people out to swindle Jed
* the whole ""fish out of water"" genre treatment

It's all there. Don't take it seriously, and enjoy the spirit that particularly Varney and Leachman infused this film with.",1512086400,,1230,4.584474885844749
