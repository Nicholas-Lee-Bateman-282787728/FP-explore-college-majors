4849796,5,B005NS0VLC,"Prince William County in Virginia experienced a housing boom in the 1990's that required an influx of manual labor to build them. Mostly latino, workers arrived in droves. Mostly legal in status but, also, there were illegals. A local man, Greg Letiecq, decided he was tired of hearing so much Spanish being spoken that he started to blog about it. Finding an audience for his ramblings, Greg soon ratcheted up the fear by tying the Spanish tongue to an increase in crime, drugs, violence, incresaed taxes to pay for services for the illegals etc etc. He even made unsubstantiated claims that members of the Mexican organized crime gang, the  Zapatistas, were moving into town.

Along with the town supervisor, Corey A. Stewart, Letiecq and the members of his ""Help Save Manassas"" group created a ""probable cause"" law which required the local police to ask for documentation from anyone they felt ""might"" be illegal in immigration status. This basically narrows that demographic down to anyone who doesn't look like a Western White person.

Initially the law received strong support but, one of the major opponents of the law, was the long time and well respected Police Chief, Charlie T. Deane. He  testified the law would cost about $14 million over five years to enforce, his officers were already overburdened, and, along with the county attorney, he said  that without video cameras in every police car, the officers and the county would be open to lawsuits. Cameras would cost another $3.1 million to install.

So began the battle. The name ""9500 Liberty"" refers to the address of a huge wooden sign erected by a local Latino on which he wrote his thoughts and feelings. There followed a slew of hearings as the law was put into effect. Many spoke in favor, many spoke in opposition claiming that America is the land of immigration and belongs to no one race or culture in particular. Chief Dean met with a Mexican government official, and was incredibly accused of treason by Letiecq and his right-wing group for, amazingly, ""negotiating with a foreign power"". Fascinating stuff.

Eventually, Latinos and other cultures started to flee the county in droves and, the local business community started to complain...loudly. Tax income from home-owning legals dropped dramatically. Rental incomes dropped. Proponents of the law became opponents and eventually, the law was overturned.

I have heavily summarized this documentary for brevity's sake. It would be beneficial for many to watch this documentary and see the effect such a law can have on a city, county, state, nation. Such broad terms can have such broad affects. Agreed, illegal immigration, is a problem that should be addressed but, this is not the way as the ""face"" of America isn't purely Western and white.

Highly recommended.",1330732800,2,2798,5.038961038961039

8480757,5,B005NS0VLC,"9500 Liberty starts with a glaring show of bigotrythe dehumanization of others  through mistrust and fearand moves on to explore the myriad complexities of a community struggling to adapt to a changing economy and an influx of immigrant workers.  It centers on a controversial local ordinance that initial led to severe racial profiling concerns, and which was modified in 2008 as a reflection of the social and political turmoil documented throughout this film.

This is a bold, brave film that could have put its makers at risk of reprisal in any event, but it goes far beyond conventional expectations of documentarian involvement with subject matter. Annabel Park and Eric Byler turn the camera on themselves and their creative journey, including the interactive documentary website that they started while this conflict was still brewing.  They destroy any illusions of absolute documentarian objectivity, making a stand for inquisitive truth-seeking over propaganda and fear not only in their creative process, but in the community of Prince William County, Virginia.

This can be a hard film to watch, as some residents unfamiliarity and fears are warped into on-camera hostility and hatred by a local anti-immigrant group with savvy media presence.  Some immigrants and their allies also boil over into frustrated anger at times. I found the film very well-made and well-paced, and I thought that it managed to treat people on all sides of the struggle as genuine human beings with real concerns.  Still, theres no doubt that this is a message movie, and it might turn off some people who view immigrants as a threat to our economic and cultural security.

For those who are already worried about cultural conflict, mistrust and political polarization in America, this film may seem a sort of preaching to the choirbut as preaching goes, its an extraordinarily nuanced and inspirational call to action.  It shows how so-called ordinary citizens can make a real difference with their friends, families and communities by standing bravely for tolerance and diversity instead of meekly submitting to traditional loyalties.

For those who are unfamiliar and undecided about the subject matter, 9500 Liberty could prove a uniquely important film.  I think its the most important kind of story in the world:  how people of various backgrounds can learn to co-exist in an explosively changing and inevitably shrinking world.",1391904000,2,2425,5.27012987012987
8480758,5,B005NS0VLC,"This film follows the course of a community who had originally done a knee-jerk reaction to an immigration problem.  The heroes and zeroes are obvious.

Unlike many documentaries, this film shows the interaction between the film makers, the law makers and the community.

It is a film of redemption, casting a shadow on the entire community and somehow pulling it back from its own folly.

8480760,5,B005NS0VLC,"Living in Iowa you would think I would not have much real life contact with this kind of thing.  But I live near Postville, Iowa and saw a real story of people being mistreated and ran like cattle though their every day lives. Everyone knew what was happening but as I.C.E came in and made the historic ""bust"" on the turkey plant there everyone acted surprised at the living and working conditions of these people.  Lets just be honest.  Everyone knew what was going on.

This is a great eye opening movie about the truth in just one of the many places that this happens.

Great job to the documentarians!",1391040000,,605,4.463636363636364
8480761,5,B005NS0VLC,"I lived in Prince William County when it was Ground Zero for immigration wars.  (Ground Zero was the term Sen. Warner used to describe it.)  The film is somewhat shocking at first viewing, because of the hate-filled hysteria that erupted over the issue of  immigration, which led to an equally shocking edict from the Board of Supervisors that required police to demand documents  from 'suspected' undocumented immigrants.  The filmmakers artfully countered the brutality by posting their film footage online, of both the haters and people of reason, and gradually conflict resolution won the day, if not the war.
I think the film is a work of art and allows you to feel the moral issues before us today.  Because immigration is still such a timely issue I have bought many copies to distribute to churches for viewing and discussion.",1374969600,,834,4.9640287769784175

8480764,5,B005NS0VLC,"In 1988 (barely a generation ago) Errol Morris forever changed documentary films with his seminal work The Thin Blue Line. The film broke the rules: it included re-enactments, opinions, and alternate scenarios and, in so doing, broke the documentary's equivalent of the fourth wall--in this case, the wall between the story and the storyteller.

From that point forward the definitions further blurred. Documentaries took up residence in a gray area that had leapt beyond the boundaried objectives of their prior world. A year after Morris' effort came Michael Moore's Roger and Me, a film in which the documentarian's opinions were broadly front and center.  From there it wouldn't be much longer before the documentarian became the subject, ushering in the experiential documentary most famously exhibited by Morgan Spurlock in his justifiably notable work, Super Size Me.

With the 2009 release of 9500 Liberty, a disturbing yet ultimately uplifting film by Eric Byler and Annabel Park, the documentary took another leap forward. This time, not only are the documentarians part of their own documentary, but the documentary itself is part of its own documentary, creating a powerful recursivity that changes the definitions of what documentaries can mean to society.

The film chronicles a brief period in the history of Prince William County, a generally conservative area in Virginia that had undergone explosive growth, along with concurrent influx of Latino residents. Spurred forward by a zealous purist named Greg Letiecq who runs a web site called Black Velvet Bruce Li (don't ask; I don't know what it means, either), and an overly fearful Board of County Supervisors seemingly concerned more with their own careers than their constituency, Prince William County passes an ""Arizona-style"" immigration law that essentially demands that virtually all minority residents--but especially those of Latino ancestry--be prepared to prove their legality under any circumstances, a situation unenforceable without racial profiling.

The first half of the film chronicles the emergence of Letiecq's organization, Help Save Manassas, his manipulation of emotion through the often hateful (and largely factless) postings on his website, and the slow breakdown of the board members who worry that a threatened voter backlash will cost them their seats in the next election. Along the way we see the usual excerpts of interviews, board meetings, public hearings, etc., all conducted by Park who, with quiet tones and thin emotional responses, gives us a veiled sense of objectivity that quickly reveals itself as a growing revulsion toward the law and its supporters.

To this point the documentary is effective yet conventional. We are halfway through. We've been fed the message (one that skews stereotypically liberal) and, depending on any preconceived notions we have--we either agree or we don't.

Then the film turns in on itself.

Park and Byler begin to share the story with others as it's developing in real time. They, the filmmakers, become characters in the growing drama.

At this point they've merely moved from conventional documentarians into Morris and Spurlock territory. This is proud company, certainly, but Park and Byler aren't done. They decide to post what they're doing out on the web before the film is completed.

As the website takes off, others note the impact and begin their own websites.  Though late to the game, many realize the power Letiecq wields is largely because of his online presence and his savvy promotion skills. His opponents, now seeing Park and Byler do the same thing, realize that anyone can do it.  This is where the film breaks new ground, and it's because the film is no longer a film in the conventional sense of the word, but a stimulus to action in real time, for real people, and in real, impactful ways. The documentary effectively becomes a film about the social power of documentary.

My single complaint with the film is one of missed opportunity: the ultimate responses to the law are very much bipartisan, but it's easy to be left thinking that this was a liberal vs. conservative issue. In fact, it was anything but. The extremists pushing the anti-immigrant agenda may have worn the (R) tag next to their names, but they behaved in ways that would be anathema to any true Republican. They agreed, for example, to raise property taxes upwards of $500 (on average) per household in order to fund the wrong solution to a problem they hadn't even verified was a problem. This is an example of social conservatism run rampant, something that does not represent the interests of most Republicans. In fact, once the opposition groundswell mounts, socially moderate Republicans (like Martin Nohe) team with the Democrats to get the law overturned. Given the rarity of bipartisanship these days, Byler and Park had a chance to make a critical political point--and shatter a critical political stereotype--but glossed over it.

In the grand scheme, however, what the film misses isn't nearly important as what it gets right--showing us that observation and outrage aren't our only options: activism through observation (activation?) is a new and powerful path.

This is a documentary that embraces a post-modern reality through its ability to create itself and, in so doing, let's us all know that we, too, can not only create our own stories, but change the ones thrust upon us.",1334620800,6,5432,5.192
