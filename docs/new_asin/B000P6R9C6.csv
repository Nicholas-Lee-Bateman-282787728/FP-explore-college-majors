8189601,5,B000P6R9C6,"I'm giving this 5 stars even though the visual quality is admittedly imperfect, since it has be judged in the context of its source. This is a teleplay from the early 1950s, a period when TV broadcasts weren't intended to be stored for posterity. Given that we're watching it nearly seventy years later, the quality is astounding. In fact, it's in pretty good shape even without allowing for age. The only problem with the picture is that fine details are starting to be lost, and the black & white images are a bit stark and washed out. The overall impression is that of a film that's a little over-exposed. But there's none of that rippling or bubbling effect that is sometimes seen in very old movies. The picture quality isn't damaged enough to be a distraction while watching, and there's no problem recognizing faces or even interpreting subtle facial expressions. And there's no problem with the sound.

Don't expect the same quality as the latest movies released on DVD, but if you skip this on that account, you'll be doing yourself a disservice. This is the chance of a lifetime: to see Boris Karloff in a role that's almost lost! Karloff has a substantial part, and he's on-screen almost continually, in a role that, admittedly, doesn't offer a great deal of range, but showcases him at his most charming. I would strongly urge all Karloff fans to purchase this.

As for fans of the book...well, there are a good many changes, and of course the plot has to be compressed to fit it into less than an hour, but I think they did a surprisingly good job of keeping the tone of the original. (Without Twain's social satire, of course.) I'm very happy that someone made the effort to preserve this.",1304553600,5,1703,4.6544850498338874
8189602,1,B000P6R9C6,"Simple reprint of an apparently VERY OLD film reel.
Both movies were entirely GRAINY all the way through.
Well, I should say partially ONLY because I didn't
finish A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court
because I just couldn't bear the ridiculous poor
quality of the movie. I would give this piece of junk
a MINUS STAR rating if it were possible but Amazon
doesn't offer that option.",1229126400,5,388,4.720588235294118
