8615724,4,B00FGVRZY2,"So I see that I'm not the only one who noticed this abnormality in episode 137, ""Battle for the Bronze, Part 3"". I've noticed other unusual things about a couple of the episodes, namely from Season 2, Volume 2, as both episode 81, ""Let the Finals Begin!"" and episode 92, ""Mind game, Part 3"" were out of sync. As of this writing, I have not gone beyond episode 138, ""The Final Face-Off, Part 1"", though I have purchased the fourth season, so I don't yet know if there are any abnormalities with those DVDs. The only other abnormality when compared to the other episodes I've noticed is in Season 1, Volume 2, when there is no fade out at the end of one of the segments of one of the parts to ""Clash in the Coliseum"" (I think it was part 2, which would be episode 27).

Aside from this, the collection has been excellent, with only four episodes out of 138 (so far) with any irregularities at all.",1410480000,,895,4.295857988165681
8615725,4,B00FGVRZY2,Audio for episode 137 has an echo and is screwed up. It sounds like 2 English audio tracks are playing at the same time simultaneously even though its only 1.,1407110400,,158,4.3
