2665107,4,B000J10GJ0,My cat is an indoor boy and I don't want him to suffer from too much boredom so I got this dvd. He's become a real tv junkie now because of this and it's revealed some weird behavior. He goes nuts and meows and attacks the tv when the bugs and fish are on and sometimes reacts to the squirrels. He doesn't even look twice at the birds or mice though. Now everytime I put a dvd in he runs to the tv to see if it's his show. Pretty entertaining and much better than video catnip.,1187395200,36,477,3.9278350515463916
2665108,5,B000J10GJ0,"My cat, Emma stayed glued to the television set and was totally captivated by this dvd.  This is well worth the money spent for some entertainment for my feline family member.

2665109,5,B000J10GJ0,"The Purrfect DVD - Cat Entertainment Video is really the ""purrfect"" video for your cat. I have three different videos and so far this has the best entertainment. The other videos have to much footage of cats while this one has everything that my cats seek by watching out their window. The loop feature adds to the fact I can leave it on while away and the cats can choose to leave and come back to their hearts desire. My Casper loves to sit on top of the TV and try to find the squirrels or pidgeons that he thinks are at the back of the set when they leave the screen. This deserves a 5 star and my cuddles can't wait for the sequel to hit the stores!!",1179100800,19,655,4.0852713178294575
2665110,4,B000J10GJ0,"I turned this on for one of my cats and he didn't seem interested in the birds, but as soon as the mice came on he was very interested. He jumped up on the table where the tv as and was trying to find the mice. He's even gone up there looking for them when the video isn't on.",1178928000,7,276,3.694915254237288
2665111,5,B000J10GJ0,"I got this for my cat, Gromit, for Christmas.  Probably because I usually am with him 24 hrs a day, sometimes even 7 days a week, he has a bit of seperation anxiety when I do finally leave him alone.  We're together so much because I was disabled in an accident that makes it difficult to get out very much.  I thought this DVD would help ease his anxiety while I was away by giving him something entertaining on which to focus.  I read several reviews of this DVD which were all positive, but I still had some doubts upon purchasing it.  Needless to say, when Christmas day arrived and I played it to get his review, I was astounded by how engrossed in the TV he was!  I thought he might occasionally glance at the screen, but he sat on the bed transfixed by the images!  He likes it so much that sometimes when he seems frustrated and bored and decides he'll entertain himself by endlessly bugging me, I'll play his DVD and we're both happy.  I can concentrate on the computer and Gromit happily sits on the bed watching TV by himself.  He even likes the soundtrack.  If I start it when he's not looking, he'll come running as soon as he hears the animal sounds.

I definately feel much better about leaving him alone now that he has The Purrfect DVD to keep him entertained.  The loop feature is brilliant, too; I don't have to worry that he might lose the remote control and not be able to play it again!",1174262400,6,1408,4.291666666666667
2665112,5,B000J10GJ0,"This is hysterical -- I got this over the holiday as a stocking stuffer for the holiday celebratives and honestly never thought to put it in my player until my cats were driving me so crazy (work at home, eep!) that I put it on out of sheer despermation.  THEY WATCHED THE THING!  STared at it, looking back and forth, I didn't know cats WATCH TV!  THey do!  They watch it, and they look back and forth like they can actually see the bugs coming at them for real.  WHoever made this, THANK YOU - my cats will stay off my desk and actually enjoy themselves as if the season finale of LOST is on or something.  WOW!  My husband also thinks this, so know it!",1173657600,72,655,4.150793650793651
2665113,5,B000J10GJ0,"I have had different cat videos and DVD's over the years and usually my cat, Tippy, gets bored after a day or two.  I have had this DVD for two months and Tippy still watches it regularly.  Also, there is a loop feature.  the other day I left the DVD on the loop feature and it kept Tippy entertained while I left for work.  I highly recommend this DVD if you love your cat.",1169251200,3,374,4.013513513513513
2665114,5,B000J10GJ0,"I recieved this DVD as sort of a joke gift...for my new cat...and needless to say, I did not expect much.  Upon popping it in the DVD player I found that not only was my brand new little kitten ""obi"" tranfixed to the screen, enjoying all the little critters that are the ""stars""...but I couldn't stop watching it as well!

2665177,5,B000J10GJ0,My cats vote this dvd #1 for keeping them happy and intrigued while I'm away at work all day. They never tire of the movement on screen and often reach out to grab the 'performers'.

2665211,5,B000J10GJ0,"My 3 cats love this video if played from time to time. The best part is, there is action all the time, no ""dead time"" in this one. The creatures being shown change just about when the cats start getting bored, so the timing is good too. The cats don't stay interested through the whole movie, but they get a good portion of hunting excitement. The chirping bird sound through the whole film will eventually put my cats to a sweet and relaxed sleep, which is very nice as well, I can see they enjoy taking naps with the chirping as background sounds.",1412640000,,549,4.339805825242719
2665212,2,B000J10GJ0,"This is the third cat video I have purchased. My cat has really been fascinated by the first two. This one is, compared to the others, a joke. It appears to be the result of one guy who takes his camera to a city park and films squirrels and pigeons for the majority of the loop. Granted, there are some 2-dimensional cockroach silhouettes, some mice for a minute, but in general: same park, same squirrels, same pigeons. My cat turns his back; I think this is a waste of money. Go for ""Cat Dreams""  and ""Cat Sitter "". The quality, the color, the variety, the appeal are SO much greater than for this one.",1410307200,,605,4.307017543859649

2665215,5,B000J10GJ0,"This is a must-have for apartment dwellers with no views of the natural world.  One of my two cats could care less about videos, but the other cat is crazy about this one and even after several months of watching it every weekday, he has yet to get tired of it.  The bugs are his favorite, but all the scenes are interesting (to a cat) and there's a nice variety.  I turn the video on when I leave for work, so when he realizes that time is imminent he starts getting all excited.  The only negative is that it's hard to watch TV now because he jumps up onto the entertainment center every time the TV turns on, thus blocking the remote controls.  Also, I do wish for a better sound track - it's about half a second of a bird chirping repeated over and over.",1405209600,,758,4.164383561643835

2665247,1,B000J10GJ0,"My experience with cats is that sound is more important than vision for engaging them. This DVD has one bird chirping in the background on an audio loop. It didn't very from scene to scene at all. It was a song bird, but most of the birds on the DVD are pigeon's. My 4 cats looked at it for about 5 minutes and then walked off.",1402185600,,327,3.9696969696969697

2665249,3,B000J10GJ0,"I do find the continually chirping to be irritating to me, I can't tell you how our cat feels.  We turn the sound down. I thought the squirrels would interest her more than they do.  She likes the old DVD Video Catnip better",1399507200,,224,4.186046511627907

The bug section makes him leary as he had a bad experience with a bug so it shows us how life like the video is to our feline friends. He is trying to find out where the darn squirrel went!! Keeps tipping the player over!",1394150400,,436,3.898876404494382
2665253,2,B000J10GJ0,"The bad: There is one bird chirping throughout this DVD. It is a repetitive high-pitched sound. I could only take about one minute of it. With all the bird recordings one can hear online, it's impossible to believe they couldn't find a recording of small feeder birds of the type that housecats would be familiar with.

More bad: The animals don't do much of anything. Cats want them to run, jump, and flutter wings. These mostly walk slowly.

The good: Very clear, good quality video compared to most cat DVDs. But, I'm not giving any extra points for that because I honestly don't think cats care.

Bottom line: I'd go with Mewvie.",1393459200,3,633,4.633928571428571

2665255,5,B000J10GJ0,"I purchased this video for my cat T.J. to watch while I am away from home. I chose this video over others because of the Amazon ratings I read. I wasn't at all sure he would like the video, but he is a kitten (11 mo. old now) and needed some visual stimulation while alone. TJ loves this video. He will hop up on the entertainment center as soon as it starts. I think he only views it for about 15 minutes at a time, but returns to it off and on all day long. The continuous loop  feature is a plus. TJ particularly likes the crickets, but as others have said, they do look more like cockroaches.",1392163200,2,596,4.0508474576271185
2665296,4,B000J10GJ0,"They kept looking behind the TV for the birds, squirrels, etc.  They were thoroughly entertained for hours.  I recommend it.",1390521600,,124,5.15
2665297,3,B000J10GJ0,"This product is somewhat good.  One cat is really into, gets up on TV table right in front of the tv and watches the animals flit from place to place.  My other cat did not seem to get it and paid no attention.  My dog was really excited by the squirrels the first they came on and stood nose to tv, but after about 10 minutes lost interest.  Guess she figured out it wasn't real.

There are 5 types of animals: squirrels, bugs, birds, mice, and fish.  My kitty likes the fish and birds the best.  The bugs don't seem very interesting to anyone.  The mice scene is kind of gross for me to watch.

On the plus side: A cool feature is that you can watch the whole tape or select only one animal and you can select the tape to loop or run just once.\

Things I don't like: The filming is pretty plain.  Someone set a camera on the ground in the park and let it run.  It would be cool if it were a more natural setting, for example having birds in the tree instead of birds on cement.  But who knows, maybe cats wouldn't be as interested in that.  I also dislike that the soundtrack has nothing to do with the movie playing.  It is repetitive bird chirps.  There is no variation and it plays through all the animals, including the bugs and fish.  I haven't seen any other movies like this, so I don't know if these features are similar to all of them or not.  I'd like to try another one from a different company to see if it is better.",1390003200,,1432,4.089928057553957

He was sitting in his cat chair and the only time he moved was to do a little lurch forward.  He finally got on the floor in front of the TV and just sat and watched. His favorite parts were the mice and squirrels, although he did try to catch a butterfly.  Rudy watched for about 10 minutes, but stayed in the living room like he was ""listening"" to the sounds. Finally after 35 minutes I had to turn it off...only because we were going to watch something on television.  Leo left as soon as I turned his DVD off. All cats may not be interested as long as Leo, but it took him 5 minutes and he was hooked. I highly recommend this.  If it doesn't work for your cat pass it on to someone else.

I turn it off when I go to bed, but one cat wakes me around 3:30 am to turn it on again.  Her favorite part on this video is the roach and bug segment!  She bats at the screen and tries to find them behind the screen.  This is, by far. her favorite 'movie'.  I am afraid that it will wear out, so I need to get another one for future viewing.",1358640000,,673,3.8613138686131387

The soundtrack is the same though, the same bird chirping over and over and over again, throughout the bird scenes, throughout the roach scenes, throughout the mice scenes.

The loop feature is brilliant- it's good that there is something to keep my kitty entertained when I am at work or trying to get things done around the house.

The chirping soundtrack is annoying, and some part of me is sort of concerned that my cat now expects squirrels and fish to chirp, but the sounds definitely get her attention. Keep in mind that cats have much better hearing than we do, so you can turn the volume down pretty low and she/he can still hear it, and it will be less annoying for you (if you're home).

2665374,1,B000J10GJ0,"My cat responds to various sounds from my TV and computer, especially bird and animal calls. He charges up to the speaker and often spend some time trying to locate the source. With this video, absolutely nothing. He didn't even turn his head. And I am not surprised, because the sound track lacks any of the complexity of a bird or animal call. The sound is more like the ""chirp"" of an electronic alarm. It is played constantly, with no variation, and has no relationship to the video. You don't hear the rustling of leaves during the video of squirrels searching through those leaves. Nor is there a flutter of wings when birds are on-screen.

My experience with cats is that sound is more important than vision for engaging them. Example: Most of my cat's favorite toys are lures on the end of a line. Dragging them across open carpet produces little or no response, but add a rustling sound by crossing a newspaper sheet or a plastic bag, and he charges from across the room and pounces.

My cat has only infrequently shown interest in the pictures in standard TV programming, so he is not a reliable judge of what is here. But to my eye, the video here bears little resemblance to videos I have seen that do appeal to cats.",1341446400,5,1228,4.502242152466367

There are also some fish..

My cats are not impressed with the fish.. but they are totally captivated with everything else. Every time I put in the video you would think they had never seen it before.

My little boy cat leans back in his scratching post and sits there watching. For him it's like relaxing in a La-Z-Boy and watching football. I imagine one day soon he will be wanting a beer :-)

My little girl cat watches it and reaches up every so often to touch the screen. She hides behind the furniture and hunkers down and then comes leaping out to scare the pigeons.

The first time we watched the other DVD, I had to experiment to find the best way to set up the show so she could watch it, and she really didn't ""get it"" until the second viewing. This time around, when she saw me fire up the netbook that I set up next to her cage, she could hardly wait for the movie to begin. From the opening scene of squirrels and pigeons, she paid rapt attention. She even started to step into the litter box, then changed her mind and sat back down so she wouldn't miss anything.

She was less interested in the bugs at first, but now she watches them. The birds on the tile walkway were an instant hit. The aquarium catches her interest, but not as consistently. My computer has an aquarium screen saver, so maybe she's bored with fish scenes.

The video in this DVD is very professional, but the sound track is an hour of the same monotonous bird chirping. There's an alternate soundtrack with music, but to access it, you need to use your remote. Since we're watching on the netbook, I haven't heard the music.

Which DVD is better? If I had to choose one, I'd probably select this one. My cat enjoys both, but the squirrels in ""The Purrfect DVD"" are her favorite of all the scenes in both movies. On the other hand, she likes the walk along the path in ""While You Are Gone."" ""While You Are Gone"" is more interesting for humans, because the audio has music and human voices along with the birdcalls. Heck, get `em both!",1292803200,3,1630,4.26537216828479

She's pretty interested in the animals on-screen, too. I put a chair in front of the TV so she could get ""eye level"" with them. And, set it a little bit away so she couldn't easily reach.
She's up on the chair - back on the floor - up on the chair - back on the floor. Good thing we trimmed her claws last night, too! She was trying to nab herself a pigeon at one point! (Our large screen TV has a textured matte screen)

It doesn't apply to me, so much, since I work at home full time. Nonetheless, I indulged in this video because I thought the cats would appreciate the ""treat"" of a video made just for them. And they certainly do!

Plot? Ha. Characterization? Nope. The hour-long video is nothing but pictures of squirrels, birds (mostly pigeons), fish, rodents, and a few bugs romping around, with a soundtrack of birds, crickets, and other critters. It looks like footage that you could tape yourself with a video camera at a nearby park and pet store... except you wouldn't. Nor would you package it into a DVD that has the option to loop endlessly or to play just once through. Well, _I_ wouldn't, and I'm stupidly devoted to my bosses. Uh, I mean, to our cats.

We've played the video twice, now, and both times the cats are fascinated. Their heads bounce from side to side, they stare at the screen, they look tempted to jump up and bat at the screen. (Fortunately, they have resisted this urge. So far.) One cat got very vocal and meowed in a determined manner; I have no idea what he was trying to tell us, but we enjoyed the conversation. During one hour-long episode where I left them alone with the video (and the volume turned way down, since I was on the phone), both cats wandered away... and then rushed right back. Whatever it means to them -- it sure does hold their interest. Which means that I have loads of fun watching them.

The same pigeons and squirrels shown over and over was not entertaining for them. As for the mice, they didn't react to them at all, making them very strange cats! The bugs were not shot in a way that was attractive to cats but if they had been, all I could think was how likely it was they'd scratch the screen! Maybe I have odd cats but we didn't even run the full DVD since they walked away and started playing with their own toys and wrestling with each other.

The second showing was as big a disaster.  No paws up.

I gave the DVD two stars because I think my cats probably are poor critics since they have access to outside scenes from their own window.  I still believe if they were city cats, there has to be something better than this to engage them.",1236643200,,1056,4.121951219512195
2665469,5,B000J10GJ0,"I have bought this DVD to entertain my cats particularly the one who suffers kidney failure.  Before she was introduced to the DVD, she usually stayed in the computer room and led a lazy life.  Yet, one day when her attention was directed to the TV screen, I could see eyes just opened wide, and she was instantly attracted by the mice, the squirrels and many creatures on the screen.  Over many occasions, she would tirelessly follow the creatures.  It was so hilarious that I could spend a good while watching her and laughing.

Now my cat loves to come to the TV room, and waits for me to pop in the DVD.  She has become more active and gradually leads a healthier lifestyle.  This is totally unimaginable for a 12+yo senior cat.  My other cat loves the DVD too, it is truly a blast to see our fluffy friends get some quality entertainment.",1236038400,2,843,4.428571428571429

Abner realized immediately that he could not catch the bugs or fish and lost interest after a few moments. Clara, however, was mesmerized! This DVD has turned her on to TV in general, and she is becoming quite the ""couch potato"". Now she watches everything from weather forecasts to old reruns of Bonanza to infomercials on weedwhackers (her favorite show remains the Purrfect DVD). She plops down directly in front of our large screen and her head moves with the action and her ears perk up. This DVD has given Clara a whole new world of entertainment!

2665488,1,B000J10GJ0,"Far from purfect.
This video is boring from start to finish. It's not geared to me and even I was insulted by the poor, unrealistic editing. Birds chirp during underwater fish scenes, a repetitive soundtrack which lacks imagination plays throughout the video, regardless of what is displayed on screen.
My cat showed no interest in the video and with no surprise.
This video appears to have been produced by an amateur who recently bought a video camera and decided to film random scenes about their neighborhood. A short, repetitive and annoying soundtrack is dubbed over the entire length of the video which shows no coordination with the visual display whatsoever.

Some of the stuff on it I find annoying. My cats are primarily interested in hunting. We have a kitty home entertainment center outside, its a tree with three bird feeders on it. They would like more videos with stalking and killing prey. Wild cats hunting and devouring flesh. Thats what kitties want to see not feather toys on screen.",1202256000,3,514,4.364583333333333

I was a little skeptical, because I've never seen them engaged in anything and a friend of mine had bought a different DVD and it was terrible... but after popping this in, my cats were distracted by the many animals and sights on the DVD, and wouldn't even play with me!

Don't get me wrong, I can't watch this DVD. ;) I prefer 300 or Batman Begins, but these are my cats we're talking about.  They seem to still be engaged after multiple viewings.  I don't play it every day for them, maybe three or four times a week on the TV in the bedroom, but being city cats, they don't get to see as many things as the DVD shows.

So until I invest in a leash and start walking them in the park, this will be as good as they get, and they seem to love it!",1197849600,14,915,3.9672131147540983

He's only interested in it for short times, say 10 minutes.  If I don't show it for a couple of days and then start it again, he's interested for another 10 minutes or so.  It is fun to see him curl up in his bed and watch the TV and he does, sometimes, dust the TV screen for me.  His favorite is the pigeons, right up by the screen.

8148419,2,B000J10GJ0,"I have 3 cat videos, and like kids.....they've seen them over and over so they're bored, there's not a lot to choose from so I picked this one and cat sitter which is on the way, I will update this when the 5th one arrives. I'll be reviewing this one, Cat Dreams, Movies For Cats, and Mewie. It's our first viewing and I think this one will be getting my money back.....that's how annoying the audio is! This one and Cat Dreams are very similar with scenes of pigeons and squirrels then switching to rats or hamsters in a cage, this one has some fish tank scenes that no other of my videos do. However this video has the MOST ANNOYING SOUNDTRACT of all 4 of my videos! They have a bird chirping NONSTOP, only a deaf person would give this 5 stars! I guess to keep the cats attention....and annoy the humans? However, here we are the first time watching it and after the first 5 minutes I was annoyed, after 10 minutes my cat was annoyed, she put her butt to the screen and put her head down to take a nap, which she couldn't because of the chirping so she left the room! Cat Dreams is definitely a good one, you won't regret buying it, 4 stars lost a half star for the recurring hamsters in a cage which gets boring. Movies For Cats is really good, lots of scenes of pigeons, squirrels, kittens playing, butterflies, and a 3G dragonfly that buzzes through some gorgeous scenery....it gets 4 stars, one star deducted for the 2 scenes of seagulls fighting which soundtrack is annoying. Alas we have Mewie which is very ""grade B"" video of birds on a feeder on a table with a white backdrop, squirrels, baby birds in a nest which is cute, and a scene of 6 white mice on a large brown loaf of bread On a table with a dark backdrop. This is the only DVD so far that stays on one scene for 15 minutes before moving, all the others rotate every few minutes. I give Mewie 3 stars because my cats do enjoy the huge feeder of sparrows every time I put it on. So....of these 4 videos I name Cat Dreams and Movies for Cats a tie with both 4 stars. Mewie gets 3 stars, and The Purrfect DVD gets 1-2 stars. The audio really ruined it, and my cat agreed.",1486339200,,2138,4.204379562043796
