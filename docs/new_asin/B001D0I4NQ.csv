3521295,1,B001D0I4NQ,"I though I was ordering all of season 4, not just two episodes.  That is my fault, however, this appears to be some kind of bootleg copy.  The cover is from season 2 and the set-up is not the same as other shows, not the same intro or menu.  It also is missing the warnings about pirating.  Makes me think it's pirated.  I will send this one back and get the whole season 4 which I had to re-order in the first place because the one I originally ordered and received was missing a disc.

I bought it because I was playing catch up - my husband got me hooked on season 6 so I wanted to go back to see what I had missed before.  I love this reality show because it reveals not only the dangers of the job but also the personalities of the guys on the boats.  I want to watch the show not only for the excitement and danger but also because I feel like I know all the guys and want to see what's happening in their lives.  It helps that most of them have a great sense of humor and that makes it more fun to watch.  This was the season that Johnathon fell off the dock when jumping to the Time Bandit around Halloween with his crew all dressed in costume.
The 'After the Catch' shows are also enjoyable and funny.  This DVD is well worth the money.",1287360000,,820,3.9695121951219514

3521336,5,B001D0I4NQ,"DEADLIEST CATCH is one of the most riveting series on TV.

The work alone is incrediblly dangerous and difficult on heaving decks in freezing seas with wind and weather assailing every footstep. The evidence of this lies in the 90 lost souls over the past twenty years of those who ventured to challenge Alaska's Bering Sea.

But the real drama of the series lies in the characters themselves; the Wizard's captain Keith, Jonathan of Time Bandit, the damaged Phil aboard Cornelia Marie (and his sons), Sig and his family on the Northwestern and so many other brave and hearty souls. They become like part of the family as we cheer their victories, grieve their losses and laugh with them in the joy of their work and play. You come to love Jacob, the great-hearted kid on the Cornelia Marie and to see through Jonathan's quirkiness to his heart for his men and his ship. Sig's toughness metls as he reveals the depth of his pain in losing friends and comrades to the Bering Sea.

This series is a brilliant, vivid, dramatic testimony to the ""men who go down to the sea in ships."" May God bless and keep them.",1230768000,4,1108,4.557788944723618
