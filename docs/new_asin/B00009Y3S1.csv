1896926,4,B00009Y3S1,"I just received this DVD and did it with my baby for the first time this morning.  Yes, it's short and doesn't have any chapters (which is annoying).  But the short length of the workout is actually a positive for me because it's not so intimidating that I don't even want to start.  Also, I love the fact that it really involves the baby and considers his needs as well as the mom's.  My baby is 10 weeks old and really liked it.  Of course, if you are familiar with the exercises already, I suppose you could figure out on your own how to involve the baby, but personally I find it comforting to have a video devoted to my needs as a new mom.  Some of the moves are really hard, but fortunately there are alternative positions for us beginners (they're hard to see though--just a small inset in the corner of the screen).  I'm really looking forward to doing this workout many times with my baby.",1111104000,,898,4.309523809523809
1896927,3,B00009Y3S1,"This is a good workout for those of you who wants to try pilates and doesn't already have a pilates DVD. I bought this postnatal pilates DVD thinking it will be different than my regular pilates DVD. However, the exercises are the same as the ones on my regular pilates except it has one set of squats and one set of exercise to work your arms. The workout involves the baby by putting the baby on your lap during exercises like the hundreds and rollups. You work your arm by lifting the baby up and down. The squats are done by holding the baby close to your body. The baby is put aside for part the workout. This DVD is a waste of money for me because I could've used my regular pilates DVD and put my baby on my lap.",1092355200,,719,4.1063829787234045
1896928,5,B00009Y3S1,"I love this workout!  My baby is 5 months old, so I wish I had gotten this workout earlier, due to the fact that you are supposed to use it for a 2 month old up to a 6 month old.  It consists of classic pilates moves designed to tone your hips, abs and thigh areas.  It also has some upper body moves where you use your baby as a weight to tone your arms.  I enjoyed it, it was a fast workout but very vigorous. The instructions on how to do the pilates excersizes were very clear throughout.  My baby seemed to like it too!  Again, my only regret is that I wish I had gotten this DVD earlier in my postpartum days so I could have worked out with my baby more.",1069200000,,660,3.888059701492537
7994256,4,B00009Y3S1,"loved the ideas for working out with the baby, but could be more challenging.  This might be for very early after the baby.",1424822400,,123,4.3478260869565215
7994257,1,B00009Y3S1,"I have been looking for a way to be able to workout and watch my 2 month old, so this sounded like a great idea.  However, this video is a total waste of money.  For most of the ""workout"" on this video, the baby is sitting on the floor while mom exercises.  and the exercise routine itself is crappy.",1375056000,,300,4.0508474576271185
7994258,4,B00009Y3S1,"I've used this product in the past and know it's great, however this item got lost so never had a chance to use it :(",1350086400,,117,3.72
7994259,5,B00009Y3S1,"thsi video is great its a strong work out, there are less strenuous options for various conditioned  mothers. If you do it often and with cardio you will stay in shape.",1348272000,,168,4.419354838709677
7994260,2,B00009Y3S1,"The instructor says that this is safe for c-section moms, but I tried today for the first time (I'm 7.5 weeks postpartum) and had to stop after five minutes, it really hurt my abs and I'm just not there yet! I was able to do hundreds on my own, but not with an 11 pound baby on my lap, squirming!

The video moved pretty quickly as well and she didn't explain things well (again, only got through five minutes or so), I'll be looking for a better postnatal workout DVD.",1327104000,,469,4.211111111111111
7994261,3,B00009Y3S1,"This may be a good workout if you're already proficient at pilates, but if not, very little is explained and it can be fairly difficult to keep up. I also found it quite difficult to integrate my baby as the workout allows for, and for many of the exercises she just has her baby laying on the floor beside her, so not everything is done with your baby.

If, like me, you're looking into pilates to strengthen your core after pregnancy, I highly recommend Sarah Picot's Beginning level More Than Mat Pilates. It's actually easier to do and is fully explained. Perhaps now that I've done that one a few times I could try her Postnatal one again and see if it is more doable.",1231891200,,673,4.384
7994262,3,B00009Y3S1,"I do enjoy this video. My baby does also. It's a lot harder then I had anticipated, but that's probably a good thing. The only problem is that i had never done any pilates before so I didn't know about the ""pilates breathing techniques"" and such. But I do enjoy it. I bought it when my baby was almost 2 months, he's 3 now, and he really enjoys it :)",1199232000,,350,4.014285714285714
7994263,4,B00009Y3S1,"This is a somewhat tough post natal work out for those of us who are not athletes.  It works most of the major muscles in a relatively short time, and includes your baby in about 50% of the activities.  You will want to wait until your baby is a few months old, and also until your abdominal muscles feel strong enough to do pilates type moves WHILE holding on to your baby.  The instructor is clear in her instructions, and obviously a caring mom.",1143849600,,448,4.309523809523809
7994264,2,B00009Y3S1,This DVD is way too short. It only gives a few exercises that you could have figured out without the help of the tape. I enjoy the Mommy and Me workout more. It has more exercises and you actually feel like your getting a workout. This DVD was uneffective.,1135382400,,256,4.244897959183674
7994265,3,B00009Y3S1,"Good program for including your baby in your workout.  Not for beginners...there's an assumption that you know pilate techniques...advanced poses used, only - beginner/intermediate poses not shown.",1122249600,,197,6.296296296296297
