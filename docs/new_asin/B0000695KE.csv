7965212,4,B0000695KE,"It seems that Helena Bonham Carter's primary goal in this film was to portray her character as nonplussed by the events of her life, and if that's so, she succeeded tremendously. My only real quibble with this film is that James Purefoy's despicable character does not get the level of punishment I was hoping for, but perhaps that's one more thing that sets this movie apart from the typical romcom or female 'buddy movie'. All in all, still a very enjoyable flick.",1372291200,2,466,4.695121951219512
7965213,5,B0000695KE,Bought this for James Purefoy and now his character in this is one of my faves! It's a good film. Keeps you interested and the characters are endearing. I highly recommend it!,1167782400,7,175,4.5
