8595419,5,B001IA9RVE,"Ive always loved this movie. Its my personal favorite movie of the Death Note franchise as the third installment. This movie delves deeper into the character of L and how his mind works. Its a fascinating character study of the mind of a genius and gives an insight to how someone with mild autism/Asperger syndrome think. Its not English dubbed, but thats part of the charm for me. It does have easy-to-read English subtitles, however. Its definitely my favorite foreign film and a great movie for fans of Death Note.",1514592000,,518,4.766666666666667
