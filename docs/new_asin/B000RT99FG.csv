2875426,5,B000RT99FG,"Finally!  My favorite musicals of all time have made it to DVD.  What a beautiful dvd set this is. Thank you so much Warner Brothers. God Bless You!
I cannot wait to receive my set in the mail.;)
Mickey Rooney is great in these movies.  I owned and enjoyed all these films on VHS in the past.  They are timeless.  I never get tired of watching these exciting musicals.  My favorite song numbers from all four films are as follows.  Drummer Boy (Mickey's just awesome on the drums), Hoe Down, How About You, The La Conga, Strike Up The Band, Good Morning, Facinating Rythmn, Could You Use Me, I've Got Rythmn, Our Love Affair and Bidin' My Time.  Wow, there are just too many great numbers.  I even enjoy the minstrel shows.  To me, that was great old fashioned fun.  I don't think any wrong should be assumed by this pure innocense.

PLEASE, buy a set today. Support this great work.  If you have not seen a Rooney/Garland film, you owe yourself a treat.  You will find yourself laughing and having a great time as never before. ;)

I recorded the film off the air years ago and replaced the soundtrack of all the numbers with the stereo versions from the Rhino CD, and it's amazing!  Watching this film with all the numbers in stereo is really a joy - why couldn't WB Video have done the same thing and given us the option of watching it in stereo or mono?

Judy was only the best triple threat (dancer, singer, actor) in the history of the universe.  HOWEVER, I stand by my assertion about her mother getting Judy hooked on pills.

2875435,5,B000RT99FG,"This is the long awaited boxed set of four Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland musicals that includes a fifth bonus disc. The contents are as follows as described by a press release from Warner Home Video:

Babes in Arms (1939)
This is the first film the two did together and was adapted from the 1937 Rodgers and Hart Broadway hit of the same name. Busby Berkeley directed the film and also did the choreography. This film is being shown as it was in its initial release in 1939, complete with the minstrel numbers that might seem offensive today and a sequence involving the impersonation of FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt that was cut shortly after FDR's death since MGM didn't want to appear disrespectful under the circumstances. The plot is simple - Rooney plays a kid trying to prove his musical talent and therefore decides to put on a show. Garland plays another talented youngster who decides to help him do it.
DVD Special Features:
Introduction by Mickey Rooney
Commentary by historian John Fricke
Vintage Our Gang short Duel Personalities
Classic cartoon The Mad Maestro
1939 Newsreel with Mickey and Judy
Audio-only bonuses:

Strike up the Band (1940)
This one has more of a plot than the first, plus some great music. Rooney plays self-involved musician Jimmy Conners  who impresses bandleader Paul Whiteman so much that he offers him a job in New York City. However, a friend's medical emergency makes Rooney choose between his own plans and his friend's health, and he chooses his friend in the end. Rooney's character now has to come up with a way to replace the travel money. Busby Berkeley again provides the choreography and the direction in this film. Highlights include a big Busbv Berkeley production number called ""Do The La Conga"" and Rooney's ""Drummer Boy"" sequence. The film also features the Oscar-nominated song ""Our Love Affair"" and a rousing finale with the Gershwins' title tune.

Babes on Broadway (1941)
Rooney plays Tommy Williams, a singer in a restaurant who wants a shot at Broadway. Garland plays Penny Morris, and Williams uses her interest in orphaned children to come up with the idea of ""putting on a show"" to send them on a vacation in the country. However, Williams really is only interested in self-promoting his talent, not the orphans. However, in the end, he learns his lesson. Musical highlights include the song ""How About You', Rooney's  impersonation of Carmen Miranda, and a massive Busby Berkeley finale which was featured in 1974's ""That's Entertainment!"".

Girl Crazy (1943)
This is the strongest of the four included films. This time Norman Taurog shares direction duties with Busby Berkeley. Here Rooney plays Danny Churchill, a rich college kid that is partying more than he is studying. His father sends him to an all-male college in the middle of nowhere where he can regain his focus. However, Danny does fall for the one eligible female in the hundred mile radius of the school - the dean's granddaughter, Ginger Gray (Garland). Ginger, however, is more concerned that the college is in danger of closing than in Danny's advances. She enlists Danny's help to see that the school stays open. Songs include ""Embraceable You,"" ""Fascinating Rhythm,"" ""Bidin' My Time,"" and a the  Garland solo ""But Not for Me."" Of course there is a huge Busby Berkeley finale done to Gershwin's ""I Got Rhythm"", with Mickey, Judy, a large supporting cast, and Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra.

The bottom line on this set is that if you are looking for ""Gone with the Wind"" level serious drama and you don't like great music look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for charming escapist musical entertainment, these films fit the bill. After all, they were made so that troubled audiences could get away from it all during troubled times - the pre and early World War II era. Plus it looks like Warner Home Video has continued their ""Film School in a Box"" tradition with this set that I have grown to like so much.",1181779200,171,5339,4.976457399103139

2875449,3,B000RT99FG,"Great package, it's good to have them in one set.  Basically, the plot is the same for all four films: ""Let's put on a show!""  Also, all four films don't let you forget that the star of each one is Mickey Rooney.  Somehow his character is always front and center and pretty much the same goof in each film.  In Strike up the Band he's a callow schemer, in Girl Crazy he's a pintsized lothario.  In all cases his performance owes a lot to Jekyll and Hyde.  He erratically swings from one manic mood to another in the blink of an eye, maudlin and super serious in one instance, grinning like a ninny the next, a flurry of facial activity (one would think drugs were involved).  It's obvious that Rooney did not share well with others.  He's a ham; Judy is funny (when they allow it).  The music is all great; the numbers are extravagantly presented by a master of the genre, Busby Berkeley (except for the final film, Girl Crazy, when Berkeley was fired for having ""run-ins"" with Judy Garland).  This is the next to the last time Judy had to work with Rooney.
As a whole, I just wish there had been more Judy and less Mickey.  In that regard, the worst of the lot is Girl Crazy where they cannot contain his brand of giddiness.  In one scene he literally throws himself on and over and around an old jalopy......while Judy is trying to drive and sing.  Rooney didn't know how to be subtle.  If you like his brand of in-your-face acting, then you'll enjoy this set of films featuring just that.  I bought this set for Judy, not the obnoxious little twit she had the misfortune of sharing the screen with.",1399939200,,1601,4.379661016949153

2875452,5,B000RT99FG,"By the late 1930s, Mickey Rooney (1920-2014) was acknowledged as Hollywood's top box office draw, a status he would hold onto for several years.  Judy Garland (1922-1969) had worked for several years as a supporting player, but THE WIZARD OF OZ launched her to international stardom, and she too would rank in the top ten box office draws over the next several years.  Rooney and Garland had played well together in earlier films, were about the same age--in 1938 he was eighteen and she was sixteen--and producer Arthur Freed hit on the notion of co-starring them in a film that would appeal to a massive audience of movie-going teenagers.

The result was a series of films that had tremendous critical and box office appeal: BABES IN ARMS (released in 1939), STRIKE UP THE BAND (1940), BABES ON BROADWAY (1942), and GIRL CRAZY (1943.)  THE MICKEY ROONEY & JUDY GARLAND COLLECTION includes all four films and then some, each movie on a separate disk with various bonuses, a bonus disk that includes a ""Judy Garland jukebox,"" a collection of backstage photographs, and a small book containing both commentary and a great collection of advertising graphics used to promote the plays.

All four of the films have more or less the same ""let's put on a show!"" plot.  In BABES IN ARMS, the children of unemployed Vaudeville performers rescue family finances by putting on a show in a barn.  STRIKE UP THE BAND finds them creating a swing orchestra and putting on a show to raise money to travel to a band competition.  BABES ON BROADWAY has the gang crashing the Great White Way by putting on a show, and GIRL CRAZY has them doing a old west rodeo show to lure potential students to a failing college.  Along the way, they cope with unlikely melodrama, romantic complications, and an inevitable last-minute plot twist in which good intentions and good luck save the day.

Although Vincent Minnelli contributed ideas to STRIKE UP THE BAND and actually staged portions of BABES ON BROADWAY, the first three films in the series were directed by Busby Berkley, who was widely praised for injecting new life into the tired musical genre, first at Warner Brothers and later at MGM.  But Berkley was both blessing and curse.  I am always impressed by the precision of his dance numbers, and this is spectacularly true of his work with Rooney and Garland, who race through complicated dance sequences with incredibly meticulous movements.  On the other hand, Berkley inevitably allows Rooney to overplay, and he had the odd habit of forcing Garland to open her eyes so widely in her dance numbers that she often looks slightly deranged.  Berkley's drill-sergeant manner also grated on Garland, and when he actually drove her to a physical on-set collapse while filming ""I Got Rhythm"" for GIRL CRAZY, she refused to continue unless he was fired.  Norman Taurog directed the film.

All of the films were widely praised and incredibly, incredibly popular, but our ideas about what teenagers are like have changed radically over the past several decades, and the first three films in the series now seem more quaint than anything else.  Mickey Rooney's performing style is too shrill and the scripts creak with a strange mixture of comedy and hokey melodrama.  Although the production numbers are always well done, the songs themselves are not always their equal, and both BABES IN ARMS and BABES ON BROADWAY are criticized for including ""minstrel show"" numbers, which were acceptable at the time but are now regarded as racially insensitive, to say the least.  And yet--perhaps as much because of their naive qualities and failures as their sophisticated successes--they remain undeniably entertaining.

While the first three films are fun to watch, the real knock-out is the fourth and final film in the series, GIRL CRAZY.  The ""let's put on a show"" formula remains, but it has a slightly different spin.  The score, largely lifted from the original Broadway show with songs by George and Ira Gershwin, includes such classics as ""Bidin' My Time,"" ""Embraceable You,"" ""Fascinating' Rhythm,"" ""But Not For Me,"" and ""I Got Rhythm.""  The cinematography is particularly noteworthy and Taurog avoids accentuation of the script's occasional fits of melodrama and keeps everything moving with a light and very smooth touch.  The dance numbers may lack Berkley's edge, but they gain a warmth that Berkley lacked, and Garland's flair for comedy is particularly notable in GIRL CRAZY, which positively crackles with her dry wit.

Rooney had remarkable versatility; Garland, of course, was quite possibly the greatest popular singer Hollywood ever produced; together they had remarkable chemistry.  Some of the films in the series aren't everything you want them to be, but Rooney and Garland always manage to carry them off with tremendous energy and enthusiasm.  The supporting casts are also extraordinary, including names like Charles Winninger, Margaret Hamilton, June Priesser, Guy Kibbe, Paul Whiteman, Faye Bainter, Virginia Weidler, June Allyson, Nancy Walker, Rags Ragland, and Tommy Dorsey.  And this being MGM, of course, production values aren't merely first rate, they are positively lavish.  Everything is polished to a high gloss and every detail sparkles and shines.  And the elements are pristine: the Mickey and Judy musicals haven't looked and sounded this good since they hit the screen.

As a package, this collection is first rate all the way.  Recommended.

2875456,5,B000RT99FG,"""Babes in Arms"", Strike Up The Band"" and ""Babes on Broadway"" were all rather formulaic musicals, specifically designed for Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, and while they were not playing Andy Hardy and Betsy Booth, the innate goodness of those characters were also employed in the script writing of these musicals.  The first three films are very, very entertaining and show a constantly growing, artistically and musically and emotionally, Judy Garland.  Mickey Rooney pretty much plays the same sort of role in ""Babes"" and ""Band"": nice, but manic.  An avalanche of talent and an ego the size of Texas.  I don't think Judy Garland ever really had an ego.  She just went out there and did it.

The break-out film here, is ""Girl Crazy"".  It is in ""Girl Crazy"" that we see the end of Judy Garland as girl-next-door little-miss-fix-it sort of roles.  With a dazzling and classic George/Ira Gershwin score, she can't miss.  And she doesn't.  She hits the bulls eye every time.  And she's beautiful, too.  Gone forever are the pigtails and perky nose and chipmunky facial expressions.  Replaced by a physical maturity, she has cast all of those aside and gladly stands on her own two feet as a desirable woman.

Brash, antic and manic, Mr. Rooney seems oblivious to the change.  For Garland, he has outgrown his usefulness.  The studio executives thought so, too.  His final decent film for MGM would be ""National Velvet"" one year later, but the critics of that film paid attention to the wondrous Technicolor, the beautiful horse, and the striking Elizabeth Taylor.  As an MGM asset, Mickey Rooney was toast.

Not so, Garland.  In fact, it would be up to Garland, after ""Girl Crazy"" to save the studio, as no one else was around.  The legendary stars of the 30's, Shearer, Crawford and Garbo had all left.  John Gilbert, Jean Harlow, and Marie Dressler had died.  Who was left?  Two beautiful pieces of cardboard, Lana Turner and Hedy Lamarr, certainly couldn't deliver the way Judy could, though they were popular.  Clark Gable was in the service and even when he returned, he wouldn't reach the top of the movie mountain again.  Who else was there?  June Allyson?  Nope.  Spunky, maybe, but nowhere near the likes of Garland.  Even the ever watchable Katherine Hepburn was making unwatchable movies (""Undercurrent"", ""Dragon Seed"", ""Sea of Grass"").

It was left to Judy to bring home the studio bacon.  And she did.  In film after film following ""Girl Crazy"", she was responsible for most of the money in the studio coffers.  That's an amazing feat for a four foot, eleven inch young lady.

But ""Girl Crazy"" is the turning point for her career.  And for Rooney's.  It's part of a movie history that will never be duplicated.  Watch it!",1335830400,,2732,4.8207343412527
2875457,5,B000RT99FG,"This is a must for Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney Fans. This couple are very talented in singing, acting and dancing. My favorite are BABES IN ARMS  and BABES ON BROADWAY.

This Box contains a booklet, several photo/behind-the-scenes cards, and each movie beginns with a forword of still living actor Mickey Rooney. also on the Disc are any nice making of documentaries.

We will never get again a voice and such talent like Judy Garland who may be most famous for her part in ""The Wizard of Oz"".

The Picture quality and sound are very good and the movies are much more entertaining than today new-so-called ""musicals"" like ""Step Up"" (in my mind).

TRIVIA: Co-Star Douglas McPhail in ""Babes in Arms"" has a wonderful voice and he appeared again together with Judy Garland in ""Little Nellie Kelly"". Did you know?: he appeared in 3 Eleanor Powell musicals: as masked singer in the ""Beginn the Begine"" Number in ""Broadway Melody of 1940"". His first ""collaborating"" with Powell was in the Entrance the Lucy James Scenes in ""Born to Dance"" and had also a uncredited part as singer/chorus in ""Honolulu"".

Another interesting part he had in Jeanette MacDonalds/Eddy Nelsons ""Sweethearts"".

Sadley he made suicide in 1944 after his divorcing of his wife Betty Jaynes and when his career turned down.",1325030400,,1291,4.894495412844036

2875463,5,B000RT99FG,"I must admit that I had never been ""that"" familiar with the work that Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney had done as actors but, I must say that I was totally missing something great and incredible to enjoy with their work. I have never been a ""musical"" movies fan but still, there's something about these movies that is interesting enough to make me watch them. Beyond acting (that was merely a important part of these movies) the performances and talent of these people were just great. Mickey Rooney had this energy and enthusiasm while he was making a scene (any scene) that you just get contagious by them. On the other hand, Judy Garland voice was so sweet and charming that you just want her to keep on doing her acts. Besides that, she was such a beautiful, young little girl in these movies. The musical parts of any movie you'll watch here have a variety of features that you might find amazing. When it's not about Garland/Rooney duets because of their talent (I personally recommend Rooneys number with the banjo on ""Babes on broadway""... STUNNING!!!)... it's about the dancing numbers and the choreographies they made back then (and I couldn't imagine how difficult was for them to repeat a whole scene if one of the actors might screw it up... that was passion and love from an actor). And whe it wasn't about some pretty songs you might enjoy... it was the delight of the dresses and clothes they wore for each act.

I do agree with the comment someone else posted here when they reffered to these movies as nor being ""academy awards drama"" but still, just to watch the performances and the effort from all the actors to put up a show more than the movies themselves like these ones, it's just great. Now, I'm putting aside the other features of this set like the extra DVD, the book aobut the movies' notes and the pictures which I find extremely AWESOME.

2875466,5,B000RT99FG,"The glory that was Judy Garland falls in two camps. I have always been a devoted fan of the latter one which I felt began in the early sixties ('I Could Go On Singing' and 'The Judy Garland Show')and extended until the time of her passing. How ironic that ""A Star is Born"" took on a deeper meaning for me as it was a pivotal film where she was figuratively born into lasting greatness as a chanteuse who has been considered by notables as the best in the business. This being said, a nagging curiosity regarding a reflection of her early films, especially those with Mickey Rooney, deliciously iced with the songs of the great Broadway composers, never left me. Although I have been witness to many of her biographical documentaries, I knew I had best see her early films in order to better understand their influence as to how her talents were polished as the young performer grew into the star whose light does not seem to diminish with the passage of time.

The quality of the DVDs are excellent as are the selection of Mickey and Judy films. I also enjoyed a small booklet of very attractive photographs which were an added attraction in the box set. Each movie offered its own selection of special features among which I found the dialogue of Mickey Rooney's career most enlightening.

Do I recommend this box set? Yes, if you have the same curiosity as to the history of Judy Garland as these films do reflect well the times in which she lived even though they are regarded as fairy tale stories.",1238889600,2,1502,4.538745387453875

I purchased this item recently - along with the Classic Comedies (Briging Up Baby, Philadelphia Story, etc) and Classic Musicals (Easter Parade, The Band Wagon, etc) box sets as Amazon listed them at a third off and I'd had them on my wish list for a long time. All three sets turned up in very poorly packaged conditions, but the Classic Comedies was a passable acceptance (I wouldn't have taken one home from a store in the condition it was in, but there you go).

I wrote to Amazon about Rooney & Garland and the Classic Musicals collections, asking for replacements. These both came (at a little more cost to me than I had originally paid, the reason for buying them), and were arguably in even worse condition, even though the packaging this time was sturdy boxes. I then wondered if Amazon was selling off damaged or ""second hand"" stock at the reduced prices. I've been an Amazon customer for many years and never had a series of purchases turn up in such a state.

They have now commendedly refunded my money on Rooney & Garland and the Classic Musical boxes (I didn't complain about the Classic Comedies, but that wasn't in the best shape either) and have said they will review their stock on these, barring me from actually buying them again. Now I am still left without decent editions of these boxes and will probably have to pay top price again for them.

I hate having to complain as I otherwise have nothing but good comments for Amazon and how they deal with any issues, but in this case, and being invited to report on my experience, I thought I had better point this out to other potential purchasers of these collections.

2875473,5,B000RT99FG,"I love old movies, so when I saw this DVD set of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland musicals, I was pretty sure I would like it. How right I was! Judy's charm and Mickey's exuberance perfectly compliment each other in these four films. It seems like most of the other reviewers have dismissed the plots as being mostly irrelevant, but I found them interesting, so here are brief descriptions of every one:

In the first film, a group of aging vaudevillians decide to go on a tour to make some money. When their parents refuse to take them along, Mickey and Patsy (Judy Garland) decide to put on their own show. Mickey directs, of course, and Patsy stars until she is forced to understudy by a temperamental actress who will fund the show only if SHE can play the lead. Patsy loyally stands by until Mickey seems to have an interest in the other girl. With everything falling apart, how will they be able to come together on the opening night and put on a successful performance? ""Babes in Arms"" is a cute little musical and gets the series off to a good start.

""Strike up the Band"" was definitely my favorite of the set. The story is centered on Mickey's character, Jimmy, whose passion is playing the drums. The problem? It's his mother's dearest wish that he take up his late father's profession and become a doctor. The only person who really understands him is his pal, Mary (Judy Garland.) However, in trying to help Jimmy realize his dreams, Mary is hoping that he might make a dream of her own come true... The reason I like this story so much is because of the traditional values it cherishes. Unlike the ""follow your heart - no matter what"" motto that most modern movies spout, the moral of this story is that, while it is a great thing to pursue your dreams, you should value others above yourself.

In ""Babes on Broadway,"" Mickey Rooney and his two singing, dancing buddies are in NY hoping for a spot on Broadway. Putting on their own show sounds like a great idea, but where will they get the money? ""What we need is a cause,"" Tommy (Rooney) tells his buddies. When he finds out that the local orphanage backed out of their promise to take kids to the country, he thinks he's found just the cause to pull at the heartstrings of the public. He offers to put on a benefit show to raise the money they need. Judy doesn't know his true motive, and thinks that he such a generous person. When his true colors show, he begins wishing that he were the kind of man she used to believe in.

In ""Girl Crazy,"" Mickey Rooney is a millionaire's son with out of control hormones. His father decides to send him out west to a rugged boarding school where there is a lot of hard work, discipline, and most important of all, NO GIRLS! Danny hates the school until he meets the headmaster's daughter and, of course, falls in love with her. However, she's different than the silly city girls back home, and he finds that winning her over may be harder than he expected.

Naturally, the musical numbers are incredible. It's hard to choose favorites because there are so many great ones! Additionally, the bonus disk includes many of Judy Garland's best performances from her other movies, ranging from rare gems to well known songs. Also on the bonus DVD is a wonderful interview with Mickey Rooney as he fondly recalls memories of his early years and people he worked with. I could go on and on, but I probably should just say, in closing, that I have been saving up for a long time to buy this set, and it was worth every penny!",1218585600,4,3520,4.459627329192546

2875479,5,B000RT99FG,"I was a bit doubtful about these at first.  I'm a huge fan of the MGM musicals of the 40s and 50s with Gene Kelly and an older Garland, as well as Howard Keel and the rest.  But these movies are just wonderful!  The writing is actually fairly fresh and witty--each movie has a nice balance of drama and comedy, and each has some truly moving scenes.  There's no doubt that the basic plots of ""let's put on a show"" are all pretty much alike, but the movies are still very, very entertaining.

I think that what I loved about the post-war musicals was the dancing--in these it's the music and vocals that make magic.  Gerschwin tunes and others--it's about creating a mood rather than the athleticism that I love in Gene Kelly pictures and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.  The instrumentals of the soundtracks are as lovely as the musical numbers themselves.

Mickey and Judy light up the screen--I found the two of them just breathtaking.  You can tell that they're both going to be big stars--the acting is absolutely top knotch from this pair.  They look like the teens that they were instead of twenty somethings.  Judy is acting every second that she's on screen, conveying a whole gamit of emotions all the time.  Mickey's charisma is very powerful--I'm not surprised that he married 5 times!

As for special features, you can read about the wide range of them in the other reviews, and I'll just say that I would have bought this set for the Judy Garland songbook alone with musical numbers that span her career from beginning to end.

I wasn't sure that these would be my taste--but I just loved them.  They have a very different feel than the adult Astaire/Rogers and MGM musicals to come.  I enjoyed them all immensely, and I'm sure that I'll watch them again and again.  You can't go wrong with this set--4 great films, shorts and cartoons, commentaries, radio spots, trailers, a book and postcards:  this is a little snapshot of the history of an era.

I just received this wonderful set & the packaging is very good. I do notice a lot more use of card now rather than plastic in the packaging these days. The stretch wrap on mine was pulled too tight. I have these discs also on Laserdiscs and the difference in quality is hugely noticeable. The extras are normal & a friend who viewed the Mickey Rooney interview with Robert Osborne thoroughly enjoyed this welcome item.
I have listened to the John Fricke commentary track on Babes in Arms(1939) and John makes an error saying that Rodgers & Hart's Isn't It Romantic is from Crosby/Fields(1935)Mississippi. This is from Love Me Tonight(Jeannette MacDonald 1932) but Paramount did often use these numbers as background on other films. He mentions the final scene with the FDR excised footage replaced in this print but doesn't mention that previously on Laserdisc this had been reinserted with Spanish subtitles from the found 16mm print. The subtitles do not appear on the this new DVD.
The one hoped for addition to this set was missing, the 1932 RKO Girl Crazy. Hopefully, this will appear with something else in the future.

Babes on Broadway has an unbilled appearance of Margaret O'Brien where she is called by one of her real names. Guy Kibbee's versatility as an actor is seen in Babes in Arms & Girl Crazy.

Overall these films have more than one performer whose life ended tragically and watching these films and seeing the fine performances of these people will always be very sad.",1194998400,2,1823,5.483985765124555
2875482,5,B000RT99FG,"What a great job Warner Bros. has done with the 4-film Mickey/Judy retrospective.  Yes, the plots tend to run together and yes, some of it is charmingly old-fashioned by today's standards.  But, these films were for their times what ""High School Musical"" is today.  And never were there two better performers than Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland.  It's almost astonishing when you think about the talent that went into these films and how it was all in one place -- MGM -- in the 30s and 40s and how they were able to create such magic.

Cream always rises to the top and it's no accident that it's still evident what monumental talent they had -- even 60 years after the fact.  Mickey's innate showmanship and verve, coupled with Judy's fresh faced, incandescent charm and appeal made for an incredibly potent one-two punch.  They complemented each other beautifully and it's nice to know that they held each other in such high esteem for the rest of their lives.  They were having fun here and that fun is infectious and a joy to behold.

Other reviewers have reeled off the highlights -- suffice it to say that their treatment of the songs and the production numbers are without equal.  And, yes, the minstrel shows seen in today's light are eye popping in that they even considered doing that -- let alone having filmed them!  You simply can't believe they did that.  Many of the people associated with these films -- not just Mickey and Judy -- fancied themselves as enlightened, progressive liberals and I think that in retrospect, I'm sure if they could speak today to those sequences, they would apologize for what they've come to represent.  But, that said, I'm grateful they're included because that's what they did and that's how they did it and there's no point in re-writing history or trying to cover it all up.

All of the extras are terrific.  I'm grateful that Mickey Rooney has lived long enough to see this work so lovingly restored and released so beautifully.  Obviously, his experience here is completely personal, but I hope he enjoys looking back at this treasure trove of material in the same way we fans do.  One wishes that Judy could see this too -- to know that her memory lives on and that her work still shines just as brightly as it did when these films were new.",1194393600,5,2294,4.638613861386139

 This is a set of wonderful Mickey & Judy set of movies. I was almost too
young to remember these films when they first came out. These were real
teen movies with nothing but real talent. Movies with just enough musical
numbers thrown in to make them really enjoyable. Now days when a musical is made its much too much music. I think thats why musicals don't go over
today like they did back then. Mickey Rooney was and is a genious and he
has a lot of fond memories to look back on. And I never realized how great Judy Garland was as a teenager. If she never made another movie after Girl Crazy she would have done her job.

Could two people have any more talent, although some might say Mickey is a little ""too talented"" and could ""be a bit much"". He can wear me out ( or maybe down) with his manic energy,his impersonations, his dancing, his clowning and his tendency toward the maudlin.  Judy, however. is as fresh and relevant as if the movies were made today.  Because she was always so invested in her material and was such a gifted artist, whatever she's doing on screen feels real and urgent, thus  never dated or wedded to a particlar period style.  She pulses with authentic life.
The package for the movies is great, particularly the book and the disc of extras  which includes a compilation of musical numbers from Judy's films, a great bonus for Garland fans.
I'm giving the box set 4 stars instead of 5 because of John Fricke's commentaries  on Babes in Arms and Girl Crazy.  Fricke has made a cottage industry of being a chronicler of Garland's career and rescuing her legacy from the biographers who have focused on the heartbreak and dysfunction of her life.  Certainly hers was one of the great stories of show business and she was arguably, as Fricke dubs her in one of his bios of Garland, The World's Greatest Entertainer.  Fricke is justly adoring of Garland and doesn't subsitute emotion for facts.  However at times, one would almost think he is an MGM flack as he breathlessly recites the facts of Judy's career (facts that any fan would know my heart).  There's never any critical stance or personal perspective just a glowing, hagiography of Garland and Rooney and too much rote  info about the studio players and the films' creators.  Although there are some interesting ( always laudatory)  Rooney, Garland anecdotes, most of what he tells us could be found in any film encyclopedia.
An absoulutely stunning segment occurs during his comments on the minstrel number in Babes in Arms.  It's certainly safe to say that any modern audience who has never seen a black face number will be in for a rude shock.  The racism is jaw dropping and needless to say, of its time.  Fricke discusses it in the most matter of fact , mundane manner, never commenting on the degrading aspects of it or what happened to the number over the years it was shown on television or how Garland, a noted liberal, felt, in retrospect, about doing it .  What impact did it have on black audiences at the time, did the NAACP have any comments, etc., etc.  Instead of answering any of these questions, Fricke gives us  biographies of Stephen Foster and Eddie Leonard(???)!!!!  Is he kidding??  An egregious omission!!",1193097600,6,2747,4.734736842105264

2875490,5,B000RT99FG,"Only one word can describe this set ""Brilliant"". It is by far the best presented box set I have ever bought. For lovers of these two great artists this set is a must buy and the 5th DVD alone is worth the price.

Here we have two stars who can best be described as the two greatest musical talents in cinema history. Even after almost 70 years the sheer brilliance,vitality and overwhelming artistry shine through as bright and as clear as ever. Mickey in his usual frantic form. Judy delivering,as always vocals both tender and dynamic and together thoroughly enjoying their work and each other. The Judy Garland Song Book section on the extras disc is just breathtaking and cleverly opens and closes with Born In A Trunk, a song which in so many ways sums up her life and career. As Mickey says in the interview on the extra disc, Judy doesn't just sing the songs, she acts them, in fact Mickeys interview shines with wonderful memories of those great MGM days and his quite obvious love for Judy.

Todays so called super stars pale by comparison to these two great artists and all I can say in closing is, that if you buy nothing else this year, buy this set and then sit back and enjoy these two great talents. Their like will never be seen again.",1191974400,9,1251,4.458515283842795
2875491,4,B000RT99FG,"I realize that as a consumer of Warners finely crafted box sets and other releases with tons of extras, I am getting spoiled.  This most recent offering is beautiful example of their work with great prints, topnotch packaging and wonderful extras.  I do wish, however, that they would have included all of the existing Mickey-Judy newsreel footage.  Clips from some of the others can be seen only briefly in Rooney's TCM interview, which tips viewers off that they are not getting to see everything available.  It's a minor detail but, like I say, you've spoiled me!",1191369600,6,566,4.864583333333333
2875492,5,B000RT99FG,"Many have patiently waited the release of the Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney musicals and they are finally here in a well-designed box set. The movies themselves are a real treat to watch, as the chemistry between Judy and Mickey is evident. The talents between the two is also nothing short of incredible. Judy is funny and heartbreaking all at once, as she typically plays the plain-Jane who only gets her man at the last moment of the movie after having to compete with glamour girls. In the documentary, Mickey Rooney makes it clear that they had a brother/sister relationship in real life, and this is obvious in their chemistry too. It is somewhat difficult to buy the fact that playboy/jokester Mickey is going to give up a glamour girl for Judy. Of the four, Girl Crazy is my favorite, mainly because of the score and talent (Tommy Dorsey, June Allyson, Nancy Walker, etc.). Judy's singing of ""But Not For Me"" is beautiful; as Mickey states in the documentary, she didn't just sing a song...she lived it. The quality of the image for the DVD is good, but not stellar, as one would expect from MGM/Warner. It doesn't appear that much restoration was done to the image. The sound is clear and sharp, and it is nice that a few stereo versions of the large musical numbers were included (especially ""I've Got Rhythm.""). However, I would ask would it have been that much more difficult to do a 5.1 mix for these extras? As you can read in the other reviews, there are lots of extras. Still, I would have preferred more Mickey/Judy extras than cartoons and unrelated short subjects (which are entertaining, but not why I purchased this set). There is much more audio material that was on the Mickey/Judy Rhino CD set put out years ago that could have been included. The Mickey interview with Robert Osbourne is not terribly long, nor very indepth. It is mainly a rehashing of the same stories told before with a few I had not heard (The Dore Schary meeting and the fight on the set of ""Killer McCoy""). Mickey definitely seems lucid, but quite odd in some of his responses. He overly fawns about Judy, Busby Berkeley, and LB Mayer, almost to the point where it seems insincere. His statement that Judy loved Berkeley and would say as much today if she were alive seems downright bizarre, considering what happened between the two on ""Annie Get Your Gun."" The Judy Garland songbook is an amazing collection of Judy's MGM songs (and a few from ""Star is Born"") that are presented in chronological order. Again, would have been nicer if stereo/remixed audio was included for these clips. And it also appeared that the ""Star"" clips didn't utilize the full widescreen framing from the DVD. As would be expected, John Fricke gives a very thorough and entertaining commentary track. The lobby cards and booklet included are a nice touch, and done very well; for the price, this really is a fantastic set. For the movies, I would rate this set a 5; for the audio/video quality, I would rate it a 3.5/4; for the extras I would give this set a 4, mainly because I feel they could have done a better job of putting in more RELATED material. This set should keep Mickey/Judy fans happy until it is upgraded and revamped for the NEXT boxed set, which you can be sure will be out in another few years!",1191369600,10,3283,4.623287671232877
2875493,5,B000RT99FG,"This is an amazing collection! I bought this set for the movies, and I am thrilled.

The extra nice surprise- I was completely blown away by the huge amount of extras. Each dvd comes with loads of special features- commentaries, interviews, lots more (two pages of extras per film), and even old newsreel footage. I haven't even looked at the ""extra"" special features dvd that came with the set yet. It also came with a hardcover book with info about the films and the actors, and great images of behind the scenes and all of the movie posters. Additionally- there was a folder with many photographs (like large, high-quality postcards), which are a treasure in themselves.

I am so glad I bought this set- what a bargain! My whole family loves it.",1191283200,6,748,4.659090909090909
2875494,5,B000RT99FG,"Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland are one of the best teams in movie history ranking with Laurel and Hardy, Irene Dunne and Cary Grant, and  Doris Day and Rock Hudson in terms of chemistry. Each were bursting with talent both musical and theatrical, so their films together jumped from the screen. Here are their four most popular and profitable ventures featuring excellent musical scores and simple stories about show business.

Babes in Arms is notable as the first smash hit Garland and Rooney teaming. It was adapted from a stage play for the screen, and probably lost some appeal in the transition. What stands is an okay film with a great cast and some interesting musical numbers. A group of vaudevillians led by Joe Moran (Charles Winninger) are planning a big comeback to the stage, although vaudeville is losing its audience. Their kids want to help, but are brushed away. Moran's son Mickey (Mickey Rooney) brings the kids together to perform their own show and to prove to the adults that they can hold their own on a stage. Mickey's girl Patsy (Judy Garland) intends to play the lead, but Mickey thinks ""Baby Rosalie"" (June Preisser) might draw a bigger audience. And they have to battle Mrs. Steele (Margaret Hamilton) who wants to put them all into school.

With lots of notable songs like ""Good Morning,"" in its best form here with the jazz stylings of Garland's vocals and Rooney's piano playing, it's the catchiest song of the film. Most of the others are medleys with good and bad parts. Betty Jaynes and Douglas McPhail sing a few songs in their operatic style, which will be less appealing to mass audiences. The blackface routine might offend some audiences today, but it is really a tribute to the minstrel shows that Mickey's father started his career in. Rooney does an impression of Eddie Cantor in blackface, and also his impersonation of Clark Gable and Lionel Barrymore. However, none of the medleys have the energy that most Garland/Rooney numbers have, so they disappoint, possibly because the spotlight is shared with the lesser talented members of the cast.

Strike Up the Band is an outstanding musical about a group of kids who adore music. Jimmy Connors (Rooney) loves playing the drums, so much so that he scorns girls and goes against his mother's ambitions for him to become a doctor. He ropes a bunch of his friend into forming an orchestra, something more fun than just the school band, and recruits Mary for a singer (Garland). Mary is in love with Jimmy, but he has no time for women, even though a new girl in town (Preisser) tries to change his mind.

The music in this film is a lot of fun. ""Our Love Affair"" is a cute song, but it features an absolutely strange presentation of animated fruit playing instruments. This segment was done by uncredited animator George Pal. Very early in the movie is the famous ""The Conga"" number, a high energy exhibition of one of the eras dance crazes. No matter how many times you see clips of this number in documentaries, it never gets old, and that is thanks to the boundless energy of Rooney and Garland who just leap from the screen. The next best song is performed at a party; Garland sings ""Let the Drummer Boy Play"" while Rooney goes crazy on the drums. Some people might be a bit put off by how over the top Rooney is in these sorts of movies, but he's so lovable that even if he looks ridiculous, you can't help but laugh and enjoy it. The finale is somewhat of a letdown, though it does include medleys of the previously performed songs which saves it, but ""Strike up the Band"" is far too tame to end such a great film.

In Babes on Broadway, Rooney plays a guy who feels it is his destiny to make it big on Broadway. Although Garland has similar ambitions, she is not willing to step on other people to get what she wants. The two team up to start their own musical extravaganza to raise money for some poor children to visit the country, a dream that though promised has never materialized. With lots of talent in their hands but many problems to face, they unravel a simple but fun story.

Garland is at her most beautiful in this film, a true joy to watch. Seeing this film would make you think she'd be soon jumping into films as a romantic lead, not struggling to grow up on the screen. Her magical voice was both an asset and her downfall; it kept her typecast in sunny musicals. Rooney is a ball of energy as always, but somehow even moreso than ever. His impression of Carmen Miranda is very funny. His love for showing off is really catching, like a puppy doing tricks. Virginia Weidler does a good job as well as a secondary character and Ray McDonald does a great job dancing. Busby Berkeley directs the musical numbers, which is obvious by some of the overhead shots and the choreography.

Finally we have Girl Crazy, the story of a playboy Danny (Mickey Rooney) from New York whose father has had enough of his behavior. He is sent to an all boy's school out in the west where the boys get up promptly at 5:45, rarely shower, and find solace in riding horses all day. Danny certainly doesn't fit in, but he finds he can't complain too much thanks to the presence of Ginger (Judy Garland), the Dean's grand daughter and one of the prettiest girls he's ever seen. When the school is threatened to close, the two join up to find a way to save it.

Rooney is a barrel of fun in this film; his energy is contagious. He's hamming it up in every scene, especially in the ""I Got Rhythm"" finale. Although he isn't the most handsome of men, he really pulls off being a charming ladies' man, much like he was in life at this time. Garland is breathtakingly gorgeous throughout the film. Her natural charms, heartbreaking voice, and gentle sweetness add up for an amazing character and performance. June Allyson makes her first appearance in an opener that catches the attention quite well. She seems confident, but it is interesting to know that after each song she had to sing on a film, she threw up in the bathroom.

The songs in this film were later compiled for the musical Crazy For You. The lyrics were changed slightly to fit the altered plot, so if one is familiar with that show, it is interesting to see this film too.

There is a bonus disk of materials to supplement the commentaries, short subjects, and radio presentations on the movie disks. Here we find Rooney's interview with Robert Osbourne on TCM's Private Screenings, Rooney and Garland movie trailers, and Garland's songbook, a compilation of songs from Judy's career in films.

The packaging for this DVD is absolutely wonderful. There are three sections in the box. The first contains the disks for the four films. My only complaint is that they are stacked on top of each other, which can be mildly annoying. However, the booklet features great photo collages for each Rooney and Garland. The second section in the box is a folder of stills from the making of the films; it is an excellent bonus for fans. Each photo is interesting and most are uncommon. The third section contains the bonus features DVD with a booklet of information about each of the film including scene selections and supplemental materials.

This set is perfect for musical lovers, teens looking for more wholesome entertainment, or classic movie fans who can't get enough of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland.",1191024000,40,7349,4.622222222222222
2875495,5,B000RT99FG,"So often, it seems to me, Judy Garland dvd box-sets raise the standard of excellence for all manufacturers of DVDs to aspire to.  This newest Judy-Mickey collection is no exception, it is a stunningly satisfying experience to read the 48 page (hardback) guide, and the very generous collection of 20 high-quality large postcards in the portfolio binder takes you back almost 70 years to when these films were made.
 The hardback book includes reproductions of what seem to be newspaper ads, lobby cards, miniature poster reproductions along with  John Fricke's meticulous research and unparallaled knowledge of all-things-Garland lovingly stamped all over this collection before you even pop in the first DVD to watch. The 5th bonus DVD features more than 20 Garland performances spanning 1938 through 1954 as well as 10 trailers for the Garland-Rooney film collaborations & TCM's Robert Osbourne hosting his 'Private Screenings' interview with Rooney.
It just doesn't get any better for vintage film collectors, in terms of value and content. It's a total explosion for the senses to unwrap this package and take it all in; the extraordinary art design, layout, and such a brilliantly realized concept-  from the fonts used; to the glossy, higher-quality paper than one would expect in the 'Bonus DVD & Guide' book, this is a first class product all-around that deserves to be a huge success.
Turner Entertainment Co./Warner Home Video and Mr. Fricke have all outdone themselves with this release. Easily the best value of any box-set DVD I have purchased in more than a year, which should be used as a blueprint for any (or every!) upcoming DVD release, which so often don't include so much as an insert.

8202522,1,B000RT99FG,"I bought this set a few years ago. Viewed all the films ONCE and then put them in a box with several other DVD's in a safe and secure closet. Free from heat, dampness - the whole nine yards. About a month ago, I decided to take out the discs stored in the cupboard and watch them. This entire set was unplayable. I tried them on a regular DVD player, a multi-region and a BluRay. Each time it did not/could not read the discs. I tried it on my IMac and the disc wouldn't come out until several tries. Then went over to a neighbor who had bought THREE new DVD and BluRay players. ALL the discs did not work  in any of those. A friend of mine who bought these at the same time as I did discovered the same problem with his discs yesterday. What is going on? The packaging is marvelous, the booklet is more than informative, wonderful mini postcards etc. - it's just that the discs are crap! Has anyone else had this problem and if so whom do we need to see about it. These discs should not be unplayable or disintegrate like one sees in a Mission:Impossible opening sequence. They all look brand new with nary a tinge of age or whatever. Whom do you complain to? It's not an Amazon issue but a manufacturers one. Any suggestions? Anybody?",1454284800,6,1236,4.259574468085106
