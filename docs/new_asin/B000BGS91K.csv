8086559,1,B000BGS91K,"Is this an attempt to deliberately make a bad movie, one of those ""so bad it's good"" movies?  Who knows.  It takes talent to make a bad movie well, although I'm not sure you should know you're making a ""good-bad"" movie at the time, it just happens.  Look at Ed Wood Jr., for instance, he though he was making masterpieces, and while today they are pieces of something, they're still pretty fun in ways not intended.  This, however, is just plain amateurish junk, and while I had great hope while watching the opening credits (which are quite impressive) it went downhill after the movie started.  Filmed on video, often dark and murky, hard to tell what's going on and is there a plot?  Hmm, hard to say there too.  Some guy gets changed into a vampire and walks the streets dining on all he meets.  I guess he's in search of a queen (a vampire queen, that is) and if he ever found her I don't know because I couldn't take any more after a certain point.  Not worth your time or money.",1147737600,,985,4.33879781420765
