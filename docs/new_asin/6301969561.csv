The only real shame is that it wasn't filmed in color because the two breathtaking beauties in color would've been something to see. Still the b&w suits them fine too. The acting, the action, and the special effects make it a quiet classic. Watch it if you can, highly recommended.",1146700800,2,417,4.805555555555555
390244,5,6301969561,"This wildly entertaining film set in the days of the great clipper ships has Donna Reed and Lana Turner as sisters in love with the same man for different reasons. Turner is fantastic as the brash sister, Marianne, who is as sharp as her father when it comes to business matters. Donna Reed holds her own, however, as the pretty but more reserved Marguerite.

Elizabeth Goudge's sprawling novel won an MGM contest, and judging by the fabulous results, it was a fine choice. Sam Raphaelson wrote the screenplay and the film was given a lush look by photographer George Folsey and art director Cedric Gibbons. A beautiful score from Bronislau Kaper and a great supporting cast gave director Victor Saville all the ingredients he needed to fashion this fun to watch and lovely to look at epic.

Marianne and Marguerite discover that the new young man they are interested in, William (Richard Hart), even though he is below their station, has, through his father, ties to their own mother. Happily married to their sweet but easy to get around dad, Octavius (Edmund Gwenn), she was once filled with love for William's father, portrayed by Frank Morgan. It was a doomed love that has become only a sweet memory to her now.

Marianne is in love with the man she sees William becoming one day, and though it inspires him to join the Navy in an effort to become a gentleman, it is Marguerite's love of who he is now that wins his heart. Marguerite lives in her dreams the years he is at sea, waiting to be with William when she can. But when he is labeled a deserter after he misses his ship, he joins Van Heflin on board the Green Dolphin and the two find wealth in a far land with timber.

A note written at sea when William was drunk in which he accidentally wrote Marianne rather than his beloved Margueritte brings Marianne across the sea while breaking Margueritte's heart. William has neither the strength or cruelty, as his business partner Heflin points out, to shame her, so marries the wrong sister. Both sisters love each other very much, and it is one of the more refreshing aspects to the story.

While Marianne helps William and Heflin with their business ventures, Marguerite finds the love her sister knows is missing in her life with William. Her love will be for God, however,  and she is on the verge of giving her life to Him when William and Margueritte return. Marianne has found William's original note proclaiming his love for her sister, and knows she must tell her. But does William love Marianne now, and does Margueritte's remembrance of her great love mean more to her than God?

This is a stunning production wrapped around an involving story which is long but never boring. Exotic lands and native uprisings, floods, earthquakes and a tidal wave all hold the viewer's interest. A young Turner and lovely Reed would be enough alone to do so. This is a plush and romantic film of the first order. All who love this type of film will be enthralled by it. It is the very definition of entertainment.",1141603200,4,3019,4.631775700934579
390245,4,6301969561,"This is a fine old movie about love and destiny -- being true to yourself and to those you love.  It is a wonderful opportunity to see some excellent film actors from the mid 20th century, also.  I have always felt that it did not do the book justice, however.  I do think that the casting was very interesting.  Donna Reed was cast as the beautiful, ethereal sister, and Lana Turner was cast as the sister that was described as plain in the book.  Well, that makes for an interesting dynamic.  Certainly, this film is worth seeing if you want to view a perfect example of the costume drama as done in the 1940's.  It belongs in any serious collection of film.",1103760000,12,660,4.360655737704918

390247,5,6301969561,"This is a must see film, for any fan of a good story or the classic movie era.  Donna Reed and Lana Turner both shine in it as the sisters in the film.  It's a very entertaining and meaninful story, of women and men who love a person they can't have, but end up loving who they can have so much more and deeper then their first love.  It truly deserves all the stars it can get.",1032998400,4,378,3.883116883116883
390248,5,6301969561,"I was just a child when I saw this 1947 film in a movie theater and have never forgotten it.  Now, more than a half century later, I revisited it on video.  I'm a different person now, and a lot of time has gone by, but I was still captivated by the film.  Well, almost!
The story is set in the mid 19th century when British colonialism was at its peak.  Two sisters are in love with the same man, played by Richard Hart, who goes off to sea in the King's navy.  He is drugged in China,  misses his ship and goes off to New Zealand to make his fortune.  He's really in love with the quiet sister, played by Donna Reed, but when he sends for her to be his wife, his pen slips and he actually asks for the strong willed sister, played by Lana Turner. To complicate matters, the man who really loves the Lana Turner character is the husband's partner, played by Van Heflin.  But that's just a small part of the sweeping epic that includes an earthquake, a tidal wave and a Maori war.  The film is also about love, the kind that grows through the years, as well as religious love.  Because while Lana Turner is off in New Zealand battling the elements of nature, Donna Reed becomes a nun.
This is a great story and there are twists and turns throughout.  Lana Turner is beautiful.  Her makeup is always perfect and her costumes are great.  I can't help noticing though that even when she is about to give birth, she still has a perfectly corseted narrow waist, and her lipstick and hairdos are just a little too perfect throughout.  But that, of course was the way they made movies in 1947.  The film was 2 hours and 21 minutes and could have been shorter.  Some of speeches were a little too long, especially near the end.  Also, I can't help it, but I now have a 21st Century attitude about colonialism although back then it seemed like a thrilling adventure.  Acting was excellent, several other sub-stories added a rich tapestry to the tale.  Best of all, though, were the special effects, which won an Academy Award in 1948.  I found the earthquake scene every bit as frightening as anything on the screen today even though this film was produced in black and white without benefit of modern technology.  And except for the ending, the story moved fast and held my interest and, for a little while, transported me to a world of adventure, intrigue and romance.  Recommended.",1012608000,69,2375,4.411494252873563
390249,5,6301969561,"""Green Dolphin Street"" was the result of a novel-writing contest, sponsored by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios. The author of the best original novel, in MGM's opinion, would have their novel turned into a screenplay, and then produced/filmed/released as a feature film by MGM Studios. The novel, by Elizabeth Goudge, was published in 1944, and this MGM film was completed and released in 1947.
As a story and a film, it's ALL THERE. Sights, sounds, characters, costumes, international adventure, anthropolical insights, loyalty and betrayal, disaster and redemption. The black-and-white cinematography capture the New Zealand landscapes, Pacific seascapes, French convents and sea villages so skillfully, you would think Amsel Adams photographed them!  Lana Turner never looked better and gave an Oscar-worthy performance. Donna Reed gives a great supporting performance as Turner's younger sister. Reed is afforded a spectacular sequence in which her character must escape from a brutal incoming tide (washing over a landbridge), by clawing her way up a vertical tunnel inside a cliff.
The best sequence, though, is the earthquake sequence. ""Green Dolphin Street"" won the 1947 Academy Award for Special Effects and for good reason. Once the Maori Aborigines stop beating their drum to the seismological gods, a catastrophic earthquake of epic proportions begins. This sequence must have inspired Irwin Allen during the filming of his 1970's disaster epics because it looks like ""Earthquake,"" ""The Towering Inferno,"" and  ""The Poseidon Adventure"" all rolled into one! Geysers, fire, landslides breaking dams, tidal waves, and locals being swallowed up by the earth and being squashed by monstrous falling timber make for a VERY dramatic disaster. And the NOISE...no wonder the film was nominated for Best Sound, if only for Lana Turner's hysterical, banshee-like screeching.
After starting all over from nothing, the main characters get caught in the middle of a Maori civil war and must try to escape.
Whether it be the convent on the island of St. Pierre, France; a sheep farm or timber camp in New Zealand; a Chinese denizen or the wide open sea, this film has something for everyone. Just be prepared to ""hold on tight.""",969408000,20,2221,5.3976945244956775
390250,5,6301969561,"Green Dolphin Street is a wonderfully made film in the tradition of great storytelling. Made in 1947 from its namesakes prize winning novel, the film  took it's fair share of Oscars. Sadly, in 2000, it is a little recognized  film, and deserves a much better recognized place among the great  films.
The story is rich with well developed characters, good acting, an  adventurous and romantic plot, marvelous sets, intimate sub-plots,  grand-sweeping plots, personal tragedies and triumphs, the full body and  flavor of a great novel, and a healthy dose of English, French and New  Zealand history. When you add Lana  Turner, Van Heflin and Donna Reed to  all of that, then you have a rich treat of a movie.
The film may seem  dated and old-fashioned to a few younger viewers, but anyone with even the  slighest bit of open mindedness will find much to be enjoyed in this film.  The production values given by MGM are in that high and great tradition of  MGM. The plots, adventures and central love stories are as intense and  exciting as any film ever  made, and yet one can enjoy it with one's  grandmother.
But there's nothing sappy about the story at all. Rather, we  are given a rich cast of full and facinating characters who tell the story  of a mistake that starts a love story with a big wrinkle.
This film well  illustrates the richness of lives in 'the old days' of thoughtfulness,  courtesy, diligence and devotion. From the elderly father and mother, to  the young adults stepping out into the world, the story includes exciting  and memorable visual and sound special effects which bear up to today's  hi-tech stuff for pure excitement.
Green Dolphin Street shows just how  grand and fine a film can be. It is a great, and lasting, film.",967766400,11,1750,4.718543046357616

390454,5,6301969561,"This meditation on the nature of mature love is a gem.  The story is both epic and intimate, moving effortlessly between continents, characters, and years in the characters' eventful lives with their complicated and evolving interrelationships.  It has everything:  an unusual, intelligent story, exotic locales, sweeping adventure, scenic wonder, thrilling action sequences, unexpected plot developments, excellent pacing, complex characters, probing dialogue, fine performances by a host of Oscar-winning actors, and spiritual and emotional depth.  My only quibble would be the casting of Richard Hart in the male lead.  While his performance is certainly adequate, with all the star power on display the impact of the picture would have been boosted by a bigger personality to portray the character holding center stage in the grandiose story.  I kept seeing Olivier, or perhaps Flynn...

But Hart's lack of charisma is compensated by Van Helfin's sensitive, magnetic turn as the friend and business partner who harbors his secret love for Turner's character.  Madame Turner is surprisingly effective as the hard-hearted female lead.  Donna Reed is moving as the spurned sister who turns to religion.  Edmund Gwenn is very genuine and touching as the father.  Gladys Cooper, who often played haughty, imperious matrons, is tender and vulnerable here as the wise mother who makes a crucial decision while reading a letter to her daughters that alters the course of their lives, ultimately for the better as it teaches them in time about the real meaning of love.

Much has been made of the Oscar-winning special effects, which are enthralling.  The picture offers no critique of colonialism, but must be viewed in historical context of the mid-1800's.  Ultimately, however, it is the sensitive portrayal of the interlocking love stories that ignite the story and make the picture and its theme one to remember.",1429315200,2,1912,5.37248322147651

High adventure that begins near England and transports the reader to the wilds of Australia.  The hard working, brave men and women in this story stand as an example to the sissified, nanny, baby boys and the useless women of our age that accompany them.

The wise old sea captian of the Green Dolphin who warns it is better to leave the drink alone ""than to spend tommorrow counting all of yesterday's bottles"". And Margaritte's final explaination of forgiveness to her sister - ""I've given up nothing. I have been given everything.""

390622,5,6301969561,"This is one of those great movies from MGM that exemplified what the studio was known for. Lush sets and costumes,foreign locations, peril a plenty, irony, a clever plot that involves any number of twists of fate, good casting, and even casting against type. As if it couldn't get any better, the earth moves quite literally in an earthquake that rivals and possibly even surpasses MGM's earlier attempt at earthquake-rama in the film San Francisco. Taken further, the studio even has Donna Reed crawling up the wall of a sea cave to avoid drowning at high tide. All of the natural peril just adds to this tale of redemption.
The basic premise of the script concerns what happens to two wealthy and well-bred young sisters when a handsome and dashing young neighbor moves next door. Obviously, since there has to be some form of conflict, the young man (played by Hollywood newcomer Richard Hart) only has eyes for the delicate and pretty Marguerite. They carry on their mutual attraction under the watchful eyes of lustful sister Marianne (Lana Turner)who appears somewhat oblivious to the young lovers mutual admiration society. Oddly, Turner's Marianne is really different. Less femme fatale and way more practical, she works hard to promote Hart as a person who would eventually be viewed as good husband material by society at large and personally for her.
Hart takes to the sea to train to become a master seaman, but before he does he pledges his devotion to Reed. Of course, fate intervenes and in a drugged/alcoholic state he sends a token of love and proposal to the wrong sister.
In the background simmers Ty (played in that oh-so-masculine way by Van Heflin), who is a rough character who harbors big lust for Turner's Marianne. What a mess!
With more twists than Lombard Street, the plot thickens but eventually comes to a resolution of sorts for the main characters who realize all the missteps may have lead them to a better place.
I liked this movie because it had a good plot, script. The special effects might seem poor when compared to computer generated disasters of today, but looking at this through 1947 standards it works at creating enough anxiety for the viewer. I particularly loved Donna Reed's spectacular fight for safety when she tackled her rock climbing up that seacave.
The casting worked, the actors did a credible job, and I completely bought into the film. The remastered print looked pretty good, but I was so into the movie that it really didn't matter much.",1326931200,,2497,4.850117096018735
390623,5,6301969561,"A lot of people would list GREEN DOLPHIN STREET among their favorite historical romance movies, and it's finally available as a DVD-R (print on demand) from Warner Archive. I bought it, and here's what I think:

First, the movie: This was MGM's attempt to repeat the success of their earlier triumphs like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-with-the-Wind-Two-Disc-70th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B002M2Z3BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone with the Wind (Two-Disc 70th Anniversary Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mutiny-on-the-Bounty/dp/B00011D1OK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mutiny on the Bounty</a>, etc., but the critics in 1947 dismissed it. Based on the bestselling novel by Elizabeth Goudge (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Dolphin-Street/dp/0899661130/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Dolphin Street</a>), it was originally planned as a vehicle for Katharine Hepburn and Gregory Peck, who bowed out and were replaced by Lana Turner and newcomer Richard Hart. Set in 19th century England and New Zealand, it's about two sisters, Marianne and Marguerite (Turner and Donna Reed), who are both in love with the same man (Hart). He loves Reed, but he keeps mixing up their names. When he drunkenly sends a marriage proposal to the wrong one (Turner), all hell breaks loose, and it's many years before the matter is resolved. Meanwhile, we get an earthquake and tidal wave (the special effects won an Oscar), a Maori uprising, births, deaths, and a spectacular religious conversion. Donna Reed is terrific, Turner and her leading man are merely okay (imagine this with Hepburn and Peck!), and the excellent supporting cast includes Van Heflin, Edmund Gwenn, Gladys Cooper, and Dame May Whitty. Nowadays it's mainly remembered for Bronislau Kaper's famous theme music, which became an enduring hit song (""When I recall the love I found on/I could kiss the ground on/Green Dolphin Street""). All in all, it's a handsome, 141-minute historical melodrama about the roles that chance and fate can play in shaping--and altering--human lives.

The DVD-R is a newly-remastered print of the black-and-white film, with clear picture and clean monaural sound. The no-frills WA package includes the original theatrical trailer, and that's in good shape, too. No other extras, but let's just be glad the film is finally available in this new, improved form. If you're a fan, or if you're curious about this old title, it's a good purchase. Enjoy!",1325376000,24,2567,6.167597765363128
390624,5,6301969561,"This film almost screams out for color but I suspect that the special effects were deemed more realistic in black and white. And they are damned good, even by today's standards!
Lana Turner once again proves she can act and even be sexy in outfits that are elegant but aren't especially flattering and the rest of the cast is perfect in their roles, especially Donna Reed, Edmond Gwenn, and Gladys George. Edmond and Gladys have a scene together that only a boulder wouldn't be moved by! The film is grade A melodrama and there's enough plot to fill several films, but there's action galore (An earthquake, tidal wave and a Mauri uprising), and a romantic triangle that somehow never gets too soggy. The movie is deeper than it appears on first viewing, in fact it's quite eloquent.
The whole family can watch this together and find something to enjoy.

390628,5,6301969561,"Based on the novel by the incomparable Elizabeth Goudge, Green Dolphin Street is a story that will sweep the viewer into the passion of unrequited love, tragedy, and the healing that comes with final acceptance of the things we can't change. Donna Reed and Lana Turner, both superb actresses, play sisters who are loyal to each other, but in love with the same man. (""Lord help the mister who comes between me and my sister, and Lord help the sister who comes between me and my man!"")When their mutual love interest, William (in a drunken haze) summons the wrong sis to join him on the other side of the world for a life of hardship and adventure, Turner's Marianne is thrilled to be leaving her provincial life. Reed's Margurite is heartbroken to be left behind, believing (rightly) that it was she he loved. Knowing that Marianne will be cruely humiliated if he does not marry her, William ""goes through with it"". But though he is a dutiful husband, he cannot express love he does not feel. (In the opening pages of her novel, Goudge explained that a similar marital mix-up had actually happened in her own family!)
 The story  moves between New Zealand and St. Pierre Island, following the three for several years as they each try to make sense of their empty lives.
The ""rock"" in all this drama is Timothy Haslam, played by Van Heflin. He takes William under his wing, and together, they and Marianne build a thriving business in the wilderness. Finally knowing he will never see her again, Haslam declares to Marianne that he has loved her for years. Their kiss goodbye is one of the sweetest and sexiest in movie history. Chaste, (after all, she's married to his best friend)
yet expressing all the passion that might have been.
Each of the sisters face danger, and the special effects, including an earthquake and tidal wave are especially good for a movie made in the forties.
Too bad GDS was not made in color, as the costumes and scenery would have been beautiful. This movie is one those for which a remake would be almost heresy - it's that good.",1256947200,,2058,4.635616438356164

390630,5,6301969561,"Love.  That's what this film is about.  The different kinds of love and the interaction of learning to love with developing a sense of self.  I won't repeat what all the other reviewers here have done so well but add a couple of additional observations.  First of all the set location of a tidal flat on an isle was dramatic and awe inspiring.  This setting also is important to the plot as Donna Reed climbs literally and figuratively to a new level in her life in her character, Marguerite.  SPECIAL EFFECTS. Don't trash this film for the special effects.....actually, they are quite good for the time and as other reviewers have written, these effects surround the earthquake and volcanic activity in New Zealand.  DIALOGUE - Quite profound at times, especially the sequences and dialogues where Lana Turner's Marianne discusses the development of the virtue of humility, which she sorely lacks in her youth. CHARACTERS - this is a longer than average movie which enables time for EXCELLENT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT - depicting the characters in many varying circumstances.  SPIRITUALITY - This is an excellent depiction by Donna Reed about how, oftentimes, people only develop a personal relationship with God after severe shock and depression in their lives and how their finding of God helps them to become healed and renewed. Quite well done by Donna Reed.",1236038400,3,1360,5.013333333333334
390631,4,6301969561,"This is certainly a different sort of movie and, for that, I am willing to look more on the positive side.  The most unique aspect of this film is the New Zealand location and the insight to the early days of its' European colonization.  The relationship between settlers and Maoris is nicely developed along with the apparent geological issues that New Zeraland faces.  I learned a few things in those categories.  For one thing, I had always thought of the Maoris as a sea-faring culture and I didn't realize that New Zealand was as impacted by earthquakes as it apparently is (was?).  There is a major scene in the movie that shows a major earthquake and it looks like it was probably ahead of its' time, technologically speaking.

The story itself has to do with loving your second choice.  There are two generations that demonstrate the love that materializes in the wake of true love that was intercepted.  The first example is almost mentioned in passing until a death bed confession brings the whole movie into focus.  It is the second example that plays out over the course of the movie and, all in all, is rather well presented.  Believe it or not (and I had a hard time believing it) a young man sends for the WRONG sister to come from the Channel Islands to join him in New Zealand for the purpose of marriage.  In those days you couldn't just say ""oops"" and book a return flight.  As we follow the sister who won the groom, we also find out what happens to the one left behind.  There is a feeling of ""all's well that ends well"" to ""Green Dolphin Street"" that gives us a positive feeling.  However, there were a few odds and ends that kept this from being a great movie.  Frankly, for example, I thought the earthquake was a bit too much and, in hindsight, it added nothing to the story.  There seemed to be a lack of purpose for some of the characters; Frank Morgan and Van Heflin come to mind.  Morgan wasn't given enough of a chance to demonstrate that he was once a secret love or that his downfall was the result of of that same denied love.  He merely looks like a sort of retired vaudvillian with a tag-along bumpkin of a son (where did the son come from-or did I miss something early in the movie).  Van Heflin plays the movie's heavy and does a credible job in the role.  Other than doing the right thing at the right time on a couple of occassions, he just seems to be another member of the troupe.

With such a unique array of settings and circumstances, I found the movie compelling to a degree that offset the occassional disappointments.  It's a bit long; probably due to an interesting but unnecessary earthquake.",1154217600,3,2641,4.469728601252609
