8086477,5,B000BGQUQG,"Ol' Hickory's rag-tag  militia took them by surprise like the popular song says,
but the British soldiers didn't run through the briars or brambles to get away.
In the best of old world tradition of rank and file and fife and drum, they
advanced until over 2000 were cut down.
News of Andrew Jackson's victory spread euphoria throughout the country. His
leadership, of course, catapulted him from the battlefield to the White House
in 1829 as the nation's 7th President.
A tough old Indian fighter, he seemed indestructible. Deep in his chest he still
carried a bullet he received years before in a pistol duel.",1377216000,2,611,4.819047619047619
8086478,4,B000BGQUQG,This is a perfect movie for those of us like me who will never be able to visit a battlefield in person.  This movie goes into detail just like those at battlefield visitor centers.  The various moves of the different armies are carefully shown and explained how they affected each other.  The other characters at the time are introduced and their parts in the historical narrative are included.  This is a great DVD for children for their knowledge of the War of 1812 as well as for adults who are history buffs who wants a bit more knowledge or just a map laid out in front of them because they are visual learners.,1204502400,5,617,4.433628318584071
