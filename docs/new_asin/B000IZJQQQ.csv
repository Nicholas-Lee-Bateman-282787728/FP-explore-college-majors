8148148,5,B000IZJQQQ,A great hands-on video for the novice motorcycle rider and wannabe backyard mechanic.,1442620800,,85,5.615384615384615
8148149,5,B000IZJQQQ,First  motorcycle repair DVD I've ever seen. Happy with it. Bought it because it's dealing with much newer motorcycles thatn I had in my younger days....so good to get  an update to what I already knew about only older machines.,1383177600,,228,4.675
8148150,3,B000IZJQQQ,"This video does show a few basic maintenance procedures, But I wanted more. Show me how to change plugs. Show me how to check for loose bearings.  I wish there were a part 2",1376784000,,173,4.088235294117647
8148151,4,B000IZJQQQ,I thought this video is well worth the money.  It has been a while since I last watched it but should you own a motorcycle (especially off road) and you are not afraid to work on it then I suggest adding this to your library.  There are a number of books that would go well with this video and I will be reviewing them later.  The only criticisms I have is that more topics could be covered and it would be nice if they would review some of the newer street bikes as well.,1342569600,,472,4.0
8148152,5,B000IZJQQQ,"I don't know the 1st thing about working on bikes so I was looking for a basic DVD to give me an understanding before launching into simple projects like oil changes and possibly chain and sprocket replacements. Now while I plan on using the owners manual when working on my bike I am a visual learner, just watching a few chapters has given me a larger understanding of what my owners manual depicts.

As far as the quality of the video there a few things to mention. This isn't a high quality polished video production (I am a 13 year professional videographer) which is okay oddly because the information is clear and concise. It is easy to tell the mechanic knows bikes in and out and he offers a lot of great tips that you wouldn't find an owner's manual.

Long story short I think the 25 bucks is worth the extra confidence and will easily pay for itself after a few simple maintenance procedures.

Hey guys I saw your website, make a some TW200 videos!!!",1326412800,,961,4.448863636363637
8148153,5,B000IZJQQQ,"If you do a little maintenance on your motorcycle yourself then this is a must have DVD for you. Everything is explained in a easy to understand manner and I've learned a lot of things that I may have overlooked if not for this DVD.  Buy it, you'll like it!",1313020800,2,257,4.14
8148154,5,B000IZJQQQ,"I love to see ""how to"" videos, this video has great suggestions and instructions.  Quick delivery, and will purchase any future videos from this company.",1269820800,,153,5.12
8148155,5,B000IZJQQQ,"I wish this guy would do DVD's for every make and model of bike out there. This was totally bad ass and soooo easy to follow and understand. KICK ASS JOB....very well worth the money as opposed to ""wrenching 101"" which was a total joke...",1254960000,6,238,4.311111111111111
8148156,5,B000IZJQQQ,"This is a very well put together DVD. I know motorcycles pretty well, I've worked on many since I was a teen, and although I knew many of the things already, I also learned a few things from these videos. He goes step by step into what he is doing, and explains why. Plus the benefits are that you can always stop, and go back to anything you may have missed. I highly recommended these videos!!",1213228800,6,395,4.2105263157894735
8148157,4,B000IZJQQQ,"While the video is basic, it is well made, and it will give the person with a little mechanical skill the confidence necessary to perform basic maintenance tasks.  Basically, if you think you might be able to do it yourself if you could just watch someone else do it first, then this video is for you.",1204848000,8,301,4.375
