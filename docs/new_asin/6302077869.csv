421640,2,6302077869,"I remember with great pleasure MEET ME IN LAS VEGAS. Cyd Charisse was great, she danced a lot, and the plot was funny and romantic, with the full treatment that MGM gave to its best musicals. But, is it what I think it is? How should I know? The cover of the DVD is horrendous, nobody would buy it without knowing what is inside, ignoring the quality of the picture (CinemaScope and Metrocolor), the beautiful soundtrack and all you expect to get from a DVD (anamorphic widescreen, the original Perspecta stereophonic sound) because the cover is absurd (and we cannot see the back), the information of Amazon is uncomplete and we suspect that this is not the original MGM material, distributed by Turner Entertainment thru Warner Bros. Home Video. If I buy this version of MEET ME IN LAS VEGAS I must know more about it. Just as it is, I smell a poor result. Thanks a lot but no thanks!",1285632000,12,886,4.509316770186335
421641,4,6302077869,"Today this film suffers from not being associated with the times in which it was produced.  Why did Cyd Charisse do that anti-Rock 'n' Roll number which today seems completely out of context?  Does the film not emanate from the 'sane' world of the time giving its answer to The Girl Can't Help It which, incidentally, had a plot just as forgettable?  The format is the same - guest appearances in cabarets by stars using their own name and, yes, don't miss the names in neon lights, Louis Prima, Keely Smith, the list goes on .  It is all at once naive and fabulous, one of the voices in the wilderness against the intrusion of the decadent Rock.  A collector's item!
Simply cannot agree with the statement that all of the numbers in it were unknown, The Gal With The Yeller Shoes was a big hit and If You Can Dream featured at the time as well.",1088985600,12,845,4.356687898089172
421642,3,6302077869,"This film contains all the marks of the big MGM musical -- lavish production numbers, lots of singing and dancing, and stars... Except the stars aren't exactly top flight. And you've never heard of any of the songs. And the musical numbers veer into the bizarre.

There are two really unbelievable scenes. In one, the British music hall star Jerry Colonna kicks off a number called ""My Lucky Charms,"" and the showgirls have wacky costumes that could have been designed by the same person who designed the showgirl costumes in the ""Springtime for Hitler"" number in ""The Producers"" -- remember the pretzel and beer stein costumes? Like that. And then there's a ballet number in which two dozen dancers play volleyball. Yes, with a net and a ball --  en pointe.

The story is forgettable, and so is the acting, but if you've got a few friends over and you're feeling giddy, pop this into the VCR and let the good times roll.",1011225600,4,921,4.638036809815951
421643,4,6302077869,"This was the first (and really only) film written specifically as a star vehicle for Cyd Charisse and it is far and away the perfect film for her fans. While Cyd was always rather bland in her dramatic roles, in MMILV she  shows an unexpected flair for knockabout comedy. The fantastic range of her  dancing styles is showcased brilliantly from ballet to burlesque. Cyd was  never lovelier than in this film, which displays every inch of her ideal  frame (and her famous legs) in myriad ways. A must for Cyd fans. I withheld  one star for Dan Dailey's presence.",961459200,25,561,4.626262626262626

421715,5,6302077869,"Meet Me In Las Vegas was released in 1956. A good musical it starred Cara Williams,who dances in the Frankie And Johnny number, and does a great song and wild dance number with I Refuse To Rock And Roll. Very memorable for Cara Williams fans ! Dan Dailey does well as the cowboy come to Las Vagas. Agnes Moorehead is fine as his mother. George Chakiris is handsome in a small role early in his career. Debbie Reynolds has a cute cameo role. Fans of the cast will like this the most.",1471132800,,482,4.25

421749,5,6302077869,"we just watched this movie again, and are loving it even more.  It's not a usual Cyd Charisse movie because she becomes involved with the mob, and there is a touch of mob violence, but it fits the story.  Robert Montgomery plays the mob lawyer extremely well, and the movie has a great ending.",1412812800,,293,4.407407407407407

421752,5,6302077869,"There are few movies that can be said by me to have kept me smiling throughout, except when laughing out loud.  This is one of the few.  I first saw this movie in 1956 or 57 when it first came out and haven't seen it since until this new DVD that I bought from Amazon.  Picture clarity good as is the color.
The memories it brought back include my remembering my earliest trips to Las Vegas when the flashing neon signs featured in the movie were the real thing and not distant memories.  The Sands, Desert Inn, Sahara, Silver Slipper, Dunes, Thunderbird were very much the reality of a much more relaxed, westernized Vegas than is there today, to say nothing in the change of population.
As to the movie,  Watching Cyd Charisse dance is mesmerizing..the Frankie and Johnnie dance near the end with the background singing done by Sammy Davis Jr.  is absolutely spectacular.  The early ballet rehearsal is equally entrancing.
Also, the spots done by Lena Horne and Frankie Laine were terrific and both done when they were respectively at the top of their game.
I urge those who weren't privileged to visit Vegas during the years shown in the movie to see this.  It is a snapshot into a time when we old folks understood the true meaning of entertainment.  A dinner theater setting is much more enjoyable than what is most common today and that is theater seating which is about as personal as riding coach in an airline.
The other actors weren't ""no names"" as one reviewer stated, but were among the top box office stars of their time.  Apart from this disagreement, let me say that Dan Dailey played his role very well, Cyd was terrific, Agnes Moorhead did her usual fine job as did Jim Backus and Paul Henreid.
Short cameos by Frank Sinatra, Peter Lorre, Debby Reynolds, Vic Damone and even Cyd's husband Tony Martin (who actually had a line of dialogue) added to my enjoyment.
All said a most enjoyable time and highly recommend this movie to everyone.",1385251200,14,1954,4.605187319884727
421753,3,6302077869,"What if your ""hand"" was lucky to hold? Dan Dailey Grabs Cyd Charisse's hand. and then starts winning. That's one of the main plots of the story, Many ""Guest Stars"" showcase the film. And Cyd's dancing is also worth watching.",1379635200,,224,4.625

It has to one of the greatest family movies of all time, pure pleasure to watch, no smut car chases and violence just clean fun romance and the best of all the dancing by Cyd Charisse, the actual plot is a bit thin but who cares when there's Dan Daily and Cyd Charisse, it's fun and a perfect vehicle for Cyd Charisse to show she can also be funny as well as dance. It is a must have movie if only for the dancing.",1322870400,3,530,3.9074074074074074
421787,4,6302077869,"Meet Me In Las Vegas Remastered!..This is a superb movie and also a historic one, be it just for the cast.
My only complaint is that if this was remastered I dread to think what the original video was like.
May I suggest that Warner Bros. go back to the workshop and give this one the Blu-Ray treatment and remove all the picture defects, not that there are many, but some are disracting and there is a feeling it should be sharpened up, as the focus seems a little soft!",1316476800,6,471,4.2444444444444445
421788,2,6302077869,"I have a VCR copy of Meet Me In Las Vegas (not remastered ) that is far superior in to the remastered CD.  I enjoy the VCR because it permits me to see the most beautiful, talented Cyd Charisse perform as no other dancer can.
I do not blame the poor quality of the present CD on my video equipment for I have eleven other CDs featuring Cyd Charisse and they all view beautifully.
My remastered CD is gathering dust and will probably end up in the wastebasket.

I called April 9, 2011, to complain about the problem.  I was told that a replacement DVD would be sent, and I was told how to return the bad DVD to Amazon.
  I just tried to watch the replacement that I received.  It is also OUT OF FOCUS, worse than the first DVD sent.  Doesn't anyone check these BEFORE they are mailed?

421792,5,6302077869,"""Meet Me in Las Vegas"" is a great movie.  It is fun musical from back when MGM made these kind of movies.  The dancing was great...songs were wonderful from some of these singers you don't see anymore and is a definately cute movie.  This is a widescreen version of the movie which does give you more to look at but is hard to see on your television set unless you have a 60inch television.  But if you want to see a good movie, and don't mind seeing it a smaller version....then this movie is for you.  The artwork on the cover does not do this movie any justice, but it is what is inside that counts.  And the movie is good and fun to watch....  you can always use the zoom in feature on your television set which does help seeing the people somewhat better.  But I would say buy this movie and enjoy a look back to a great little musical and some great stars....to make you happy...",1299801600,2,885,4.195266272189349

7820866,3,6302077869,"This is a pleasant musical from the mid 1950s.  It involves a budding romance between Dan Dailey and, to me, the fabulous Cyd Charisse.  It is impossible for me not to like a movie with Cyd Charisse.  However she is not the prototype leading lady.  Dan Dailey is good, but not great.  There are numerous brief appearances of stars from the era.  Frankie Laine appears and performs a good but forgettable number.  Sammy Davis Jr. performs an excellent rendition of ""Frankie and Johnny"" but does not appear.  Hmm...  John Brascia appears as a dance partner for Cyd Charisse.  John Brascia was also a special dance partner for Vera Ellen in ""White Christmas"".  In reality, this movie is probably of medium quality.  I think it is considered more or less forgettable.  The stars just don't have enough horse power...

Personally, I enjoy the dated, time capsule aspect of many movies from the 40s, 50s, and 60s.  Las Vegas was a far different city than now.  I recently drove through Las Vegas.  It was huge.  I took one look and kept going.  Las Vegas was still just beginning to grow in the 1950s.
