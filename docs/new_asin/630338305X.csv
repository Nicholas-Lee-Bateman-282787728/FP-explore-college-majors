634946,3,630338305X,"I just caught this one on cable. I believe I missed about the first 5 minutes but saw the rest.
First, I should say I was captivated. The music caught my attention as much as anything. The story seemed to be unfolding as a romance, but the music was simultaneously sweet and forboding (I kept waiting for a serial killer to pop in). The sets and clothing were lovely to look at. And in my opinion the story was nicely paced.
My real problem with the movie is a moral one. The main character (played by Paul Newman), is driven to succed in business. However, his employer demands he travel across the country without his wife. Aforementioned wife seems to have no real qualms about dating while her husband is away and starts up a fling with her old boyfriend, a playboy doctor.
The employer is scandalized that his up and comer has a wife who is seeing another man. He feels a strong marriage is a prerequisite to the Newman char. becoming a partner in the firm. Neither the wife nor the employer ever express any regret about their actions.
During Newman's business travels, he becomes enamored with the daughter of a potential client, a young honest woman who initially resists his advances due to his marriage. She eventually changes to the view that ""love"" is the most important thing, and subsequently sleeps with Newman. Niether of them express regrets about this.
I won't ruin the film's ending for you. I did feel empty at the end though. The characters never seemed to think of much beyond their own personal fulfilment, and the message the film put forward was that that was ok, as long as ""love"" was what was in view.",989020800,15,1628,4.559726962457338
634947,3,630338305X,"It's not ""The Long, Hot Summer"" (which is a towering achievement  in cinematic trash, and one of my favorite movies), but ""From the  Terrace"" is fun. As with every other 50's organization man novel  adapted to the screen, it bears only a tenuous relationship to the original  book, but in that case this is a good thing. First, O'Hara's writing is  turgid, self-important pulp, and second, the story is about a total loser.  No one goes to a Paul Newman movie to see the story of a pathetic dweeb,  and they won't see one here, either. He's flawed but heroic, and he and  Woodward look like a million bucks. The movie ends a little less than  halfway through the book, but you can't tell.",959299200,7,688,4.483870967741935
635029,1,630338305X,"Review of From the Terrace
Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

I wonder if Paul Newman ever got tired of playing Paul Newman. It seems like hes always cast in the same role: rebellious but still seeking approval, parents don't like him, bad boy, a ladies man, and a bit of an unlikable edge. However, unlike other Paul Newman movies where this type of character actually captures the audiences attention, From the Terrace is lousy.

Paul Newman comes from an unrespectable family, but he wants to make something of himself. He wants to become a member of high society, so he can see the view from the terrace. In his quest, he pursues high-class Joanne Woodward. In his overwhelming ambition, he works too much and leaves his wife alone too often. She turns to alcohol and humiliates him by having an affair. But why are we supposed to be surprised? When he met her, she was engaged to someone else. She cheated on her fianc&eacute; and left him for Paul Newman. Once a floozy, always a floozy!

The plot is disjointed and boring, and despite Hollywoods repeated casting of Joanne Woodward in sexy roles, her aura reeked like she didn't know where the bedroom was, not like she spent all her time there. The costars were married by the time they made this movie, but if you really want to see their chemistry, you have nine other films to choose from.

The only good scene in this movie is in the beginning. Paul Newman returns home from the war and witnesses an argument between his parents, drunken floozy Myrna Loy and stern Leon Ames. Go ahead and watch the first twenty minutes of the movie, then do yourself a favor and turn it off.",1499644800,,1633,4.54421768707483

635192,4,630338305X,"I admire the hell out of Paul Newman. He came across as regular folks, never mind that life endowed him with spectacular fashion model looks. But he never much used his looks as a crutch. That he had longevity in this cutthroat biz was credited more to his formidable acting chops and consistency and unflagging devotion to his craft. And I love his films with Joanne Woodward, his real-life, very talented wife. My favorite colab of theirs is The Long, Hot Summer (1958), but From the Terrace (1960) ain't too shabby, either, both films being these messy soap operas rife with steamy courtships and human foibles exposed and made raw.

From the Terrace is based on John Ohara's mammoth novel, and, even as long as this movie is, it doesn't even begin to plumb the depth and richness of Ohara's prose. The movie begins with a son's desolate homecoming. Navy Lt. David Alfred Eaton (Newman), back from the war and given lukewarm reception by his father (Leon Ames), a stern patriarch who still mourns the passing of his other son. Alfred soaks it all in anew: his indifferent father; his shattered, boozy, unfaithful mother (Myrna Loy); their inhospitable marriage. These are the seeds of Alfred's disaffection and unwavering ambition. He rejects his father's offer to be heir to the family steel mill, at which point the elder Eaton informs his son: ""You're not big enough to even walk in my shadow, and you never will be."" Damning words that eat away at Alfred. He sets out to make a name for himself, to accumulate fortune, to seize respectability. Charles Foster Kane would like to give him an ""Attaboy.""

From a Terrace tracks Alfred's progress as he relentlessly scales the business world, as he woos and wins a restless, tempestuous socialite (Woodward), as he weighs his career against his marriage (and ever favors his career), as the first blush of marital warmth decays to something ugly and mean and barren. It's a flawlessly, heartbreakingly acted movie, capped off by Woodward's bravura show of wanton excess and by a simply radiant, achingly vulnerable Ina Balin as potentially the ""other woman."" Throughout, Newman is the steady force. He anchors the story, fleshing out a study of a damaged man whose best efforts are submarined by his own neuroses.

The movie did well by adapting much of the author's prose. The dialogue is at times lyrical, at times pointed and hard-hitting. It is unflinching in its depiction of a disintegrated union. And there's potency in the hurtful moments, in Newman and Woodward's civilized yet barbed exchanges and in moments of promiscuity. Woodward is so wonderful an actress, and even though she's as much the culprit, I couldn't help but long to give her a hug or at least an ear for her to confide into. She skillfully exposes the brittleness, the wounded cracks, in the character she plays. I wasn't sure how the story would end, wasn't even sure whom to root for because I ended up liking all three principals. I doubt I'll watch From the Terrace again. I really don't want to put myself thru that emotional wringer again or re-visit such a bleak marital wasteland. It's sad because I could see where it all could've gone another way early on, if only these people weren't so damaged from jump. In the end, the story didn't go where I had hoped it would. But it does end on a hopeful note, and there's a measure of grace achieved. So that's something.",1444089600,,3403,4.774193548387097

I've never seen Paul Newman or Joanne Woodward give a bad performance and this movie doesn't disappoint. It shows what happens when one marries ""out of their class"" and then tries to overcome their humble beginnings by focusing on making a name for themselves through their work while ignoring their spouse.

635258,3,630338305X,"Fairly risque' 1960 adaptation of the John O'Hara potboiler with Paul Newman and wife Joanne Woodward, including a doe-eyed illicit love interest in Ina Balin.  While parts of the movie are literate and well acted, it suffers from extremely poor pacing and editing, occasionally wooden performances, and a (period) hokey and over saturated score.

Had this been redone in 2015 it'd be called ""The Tiger Woods Story"" and have way more sex and bad language.  More prudent editing would have allowed for more emotional punch, but as-is it's a good vehicle for Newman and Woodward to spew controlled vitriol at each other (middle to end). Both Woodward and Balin are lovely, but alas, rather empty vessels.  Not exactly Newman's career zenith either.",1436140800,,746,5.090163934426229
635259,3,630338305X,"Sometimes, and it is the case here with the adaptation of John OHaras saucy melodrama From The Terrace, a film, an older film, can provide a glimpse of what was going on in society at the time for both those who lived through it and those too young to have known about the times first hand. Part of the success of the recently ended series, Mad Men, was that viewers were interested in taking a retro look back at the early 1960s before the big counter-cultural splash tore American society asunder. You know the age of Ike, the age of conformity, and in retrospect the golden age of the American worker before the race to the bottom hit full stride. From The Terrace covers a lot of that same territory, the part about making it big in America, about making a name for yourself with hard work, ruthlessness, and some chutzpah. Some of that ethos obviously still exists now but the rewards for many, like the protagonist of this film, Alfred Eaton (played by Paul Newman) have lost their luster.

Here is the skinny. In the age of Ike (and you knew you were in the age of Ike with all the guys, the Wall Street guys anyway, wearing soft hats to work and expensive nicely tailored overcoats in inclement weather to boot) there was money and reputation to be made by those men who survived the rigors of World War II (and it was mainly men since women were expected to stay home with the kids in Middle America or as in this film with Mary, Alfreds initial love interest played by Joanne Woodward , spend their time looking beautiful if from the upper crust) and had a little luck and skill. That was the case with one Alfred Eaton who wanted to get out from under plodding along working his way up in his fathers mill (and his fathers obsession with a dead brother to the exclusion of any human feeling for him). And so he goes out on his own, first with a fellow veteran in an aircraft business then after a fortuitous event a high end job at a big time Wall Street financial firm with nothing to stop him from rising to the top except his own desires.

Typical Wall Street success story, right? Well yes but remember this is a John OHara story. OHara cut his teeth on chronicling the lives, read sex lives, of the upper crust in places like Pennsylvania and New York  beginning with his classic Appointment at Samarra so that is not the end of the tale by any means. Of course there has to be a love interest or here more than one. Number one is the classic match-up of the unapproachable rich girl of Alfreds dreams (and entre into high society) whom he is able to seduce and marry. But a guy on the way up has to give up things, mostly time for personal relationships and so Mary gets short shrift. But Mary is a fussy young woman and wants companionship anyway she can get it once it is clear that Alfred is driven by success and not by her bedroom eyes. So she wanders, works her way into a little off-hand adultery. Of course that is a problem, a big problem in publicity conscious 1950s high finance where formally stable marriages are a given. Divorce and known adultery are the kiss of death for the young and ambitious on that high road to success whatever else is involved. So Alfred is a very unhappy man who knows he has made a wrong choice in the wife department.

And not just in the wife department as the story unfolds since he begins to have a personal crisis of conscience brought on by an attraction to a gal from Podunk (played by Ina Balin) whose wholesomeness and grounded-ness contrasts with Alfreds whole bloody lifestyle. But our boy gets religion, gets it big when he has the brass ring right in his fingers-and just walks away, walks away the Street for whatever bucolic life is in store for him. Mary, well, the Marys of the world land on their feet so don't cry for her. If you want a glimpse at what high society, its mores, and its hypocrisies looked in the 1950s including now seemingly strange ideas about marriage, divorce, ethical standards and just doing the right thing this while not a great story line when the deal goes down since it was not a great OHara story but one in a line of many along the same lines will give you an idea.",1433462400,2,4172,4.372422680412371

Then he fell in love with another woman after marrying the woman he thought he wanted. He couldn't divorce because the firm would not approve. So he had decisions to make.

He marries a society girl who practices infidelity while he is away on assignments. He meets a beautiful coal miner's daughter who captures his heart and turns his whole life around.

635380,2,630338305X,"I caught this movie on Netflix last night, having never heard of it before.  Now I know why.  I know that Paul Newman was a good actor, which is why it was a bit shocking to find his performance here so wooden.  It reminded me of George Peppard's equally stiff performance in The Carpetbaggers, which is even tackier, sillier, and even more morally bankrupt than this trainwreck of a film.

You can tell from the very beginning Newman's character and Joanne Woodward, who plays his ice queen Barbie doll wife, are going to have a tough time of it as he begins to ignore her and chase wealth at the cost of his marriage.  Maybe he should have let that little brat drown?  His bosses won't let her go along with him on any business trips, so she begins to have a good time with a lot of other men, most notably her former fiancee'.

Eventually, he takes up with a client's daughter, played horribly by Ina Balin, who I, at least, have never heard of before.  As silly, tacky and soap opera-esque as this film is, I just can't find enough bad things to say about this particular woman's performance.  She doesn't look at him most of the time while delivering her lines, but off into the distance like a deer caught in the headlights and delivers her lines in a ditzy monotone that is absolutely nerve wracking.

It's impossible to feel anything positive for this movie except relief when it's over.  I will say that Woodward did her part at least.  If she was trying to be the completely unlikeable trophy wife, she succeeded wonderfully.  As silly as a lot of people think Valley of the Dolls is, this film outdid it by a landslide, plus Dolls had a campy charm that's missing from this story.  Well, you know the old story; you have to try it out for yourself because there are more positive reviews than negative here.  Okay, I've done the same thing only to be confronted with something I didn't like at all.  If you like it, cheers; if not, don't say you weren't warned.",1419724800,,1972,4.436111111111111

In all the vintage films I also look for the costuming and decorating, especially the colors used.  This film is a bit longer than most, I believe 2 hrs and 25 min. but worth the time.  Definitely controversial for the era, well acted, and covers honor issues... will Paul sell out to the dollar?

Excellent direction, screenplay, score, and acting by Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward (in a wonderful role), Ina Balin, Leon Ames, Myrna Loy, Patrick O'Neal, and Felix Aylmer. The opening is sensational -- a lesson in storytelling. Sex in those days (1960) was suggested (and left to your imagination) rather than rammed in your face, which I find much more interesting. The theme of ""what is success"" is just as relevant now as it was then. For me, the actors of today pale in comparison with Newman and Woodward. The camera loves Newman. His ability to capture this kind of character is unrivaled. The novel had a really hair raising ending, but frankly I dig the Hollywood version. I liked the Newman character and prefer to see him live happily ever after. Hey, it's a movie for heaven's sake.",1399507200,,861,4.746666666666667

If I was writing it, I would say something like ""A son of a wealthy man returns from war to find his way in life"".",1398556800,,391,4.226666666666667
635597,1,630338305X,"By far, the worst Paul Newman (& Joanne Woodward) movie that i have had the pleasure of viewing.  Watch it with friends that appreciated irreverent commentary during bad movies.  Otherwise, it's simply dreadful.  If you love characters wading hip deep in syrupy melodrama, than this is the movie for you.  If you love one dimensional characters or characters who radically change their nature in mid drift,  implausible dialogue, inexplicable plot evolution - well,  than have a go at it!  If you want lots of loose threads, wasted motion, plot twists that you can see a mile away and then sit there for half an hour laughing about the  inevitable - than by all means, this is the movie for you.  Please don't analyze any aspect of this movie:  nothing makes sense upon the most casual reflection.  It's strange that the screen writer responsible for this nonsense also wrote the adaption for ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf"".  Loads of wasted talent.  It's suppose to titillate our curiosity and admiration for the world of the super rich (the wealth creators).  Based on this movie i'm glad to report that they generally uphold themselves to the most exacting of moral standards.
Thank goodness!

Of course, if you're a female & love looking at Paul Newman, than there's nothing to complain about.  Also, there is a brief cameo of a very young Barbara Eden (for those ""i dream of jeannie fans)",1397952000,2,1395,4.822784810126582

635646,5,630338305X,"Joanne Woodward is to be applauded for her skillful portrayal of Paul Newman's self-centered larger-than-life trophy wife in this story of a quest for happiness.  The film is worth watching just to see Woodward in this uncharacteristic role.  Paul Newman is less convincing as a WWII veteran (navy pilot) caught between his desire to outperform his cold father in the business arena and his desire for the love that he never received from his harsh father and alcoholic mother--only from the household servants while he was a boy.  Myrna Loy's outstanding performance as Newman's mother, sunk deep in alcoholism, is particularly touching.  The film has a curious static quality, possibly because of its pacing.  Most of the shots are very carefully conceived to convey the underlying message of personal destiny.  In the end, one cannot avoid comparing the fate of Newman's neglected mother with the prospects for his abandoned wife.  Will Mary St. John have enough ""guts"" to resurrect herself from the wreckage of her marriage, or will her ungovernable temper be her downfall?",1396310400,,1077,5.155172413793103

The woman he loves tells him:  ""I saw a sad and lonely man and I fell in love with his sadness.""

In addition, the film is beautifully produced with a layed and complex story matched with poignant dialouge.  This is one of the rare gems of the American cinema.

""From The Terrace"" is a slick melodrama whose ultimate message is...power and money cannot buy you happiness or love!
This film was also maybe the third time Paul had worked with his wife Joanne Woodward, who gets to be really glamorous for the first and maybe the last time in her successful film career. She does a great job with what could have been a fluff role!
In brief, the story is about being robbed of your passions....in this case Paul's dream of working in the world of aviation, and marrying the perfect wife. But by circumstance, accident, or fate? he lands a prestigious Wall Street job that he clearly hates. Out of boredom his wife takes a lover and eventually he does too, (Lovely Ina Balin), but with her he sees the big possibility that he may have found his true soul mate. The decisions he needs to make to follow his heart round out the remainder of the story. Interestingly, the hypocrisy and shenanigans on Wall Street are even more relevant today!
The film also stars the wonderful Mryna Loy, and underrated character actor, Leon Ames as Newman's alcoholic mother and bitter father. Leon and Paul have a scene together at the beginning of the movie that is so harsh that it makes me squirm every time I see it!

The theme is real, not influenced by the woman's movement for equality and the makeup feels right, not a caricature.  Yes, it was only men in the boardrooms of power with  the lust for financial success dominant.  The story and the actors were reflective of their life and times.

That said, all the actors do outstanding acting jobs, being true to their time and place in history.  Paul Newman is just back from WWII.  His mother, played by Myrna Loy"" is an alcoholic.  His father is unfeeling towards Newman and has only loved his other son who had died at the age of 12.  Newman is angry, lonely and determined to do well in life.  As a young man about town in New York, he romances Joanne Woodward, a society girl with hair bleached so blonde that it looks silver.  She has a boyfriend at the time but Newman beats him out to win Woodward's hand.  However, through the years, she keeps an affair going with this former boyfriend.  Supposedly this is because Newman is working so hard in his Wall Street business that he has no time for her.  Seen through modern eyes, however, Woodward has no other choices in life - no job, no children, no appreciation for her husband.  She's also been sheltered all her life and brought up with money, beautiful clothes and no feelings except enjoying herself.  Naturally, Newman falls in love with another woman played by Ina Balin a virginal type from a small town in West Virginia who is completely smitten by him.  Naturally there is conflict and how this all turns out is a satisfactory conclusion.

I enjoyed the film, thought the acting was good, the script fast paced and interesting.  But most of all I liked the period details of all those cigarettes, alcohol, a drive-in theater, lots of parties.  Naturally, in their world everybody was white and the valued partnership in the big corporation came with strings attached.

He has the courage to take that leap forward rather than jumping loops for those in the corporate world and living a pretentious lifestyle.

  Paul Newman is a the top of his career, and with his looks. Joanne Woodward, his real wife and his wife in the movie, is a nasty, possessive, run around, wife. Newman climbs to the top by saving a corporate CEO's grandson from drowning and as a reward, gets a corporate job. But Newman is caught between his corporate job and his unfaithful wife because its against corporate policy, no matter the reason, to get a divorce.
  Newman, on one of his assignments, meets a daughter of a mining CEO in Pennslyvania who is nice, humble, and just perfect for Newman. They fall in love with each other, but, his scheming wife, does not want to give him a divorce because she has the best of both worlds; i.e., a lover and her husband who provides her all the luxuaries she wants.

636044,5,630338305X,"From the Terrace was a huge release in 1960, with its cast, and the long long novel that it is loosely based on. John O'Hara wrote this book with great loathing for the cold war, Eisenhauer, capitalism, and relationships, which he says in his novel have ""no potential at all.""

The film version touches on these issues, but avoids the drugs, addictions to sex, etc. and shows us marriages that are very bad, and affairs that are taudry, and Paul Newman's character etching out a career with a hateful wife and a loving mistress.

The mistress will be his new spouse, but his wife of old will block him at every turn. Paul Newman's Mr Eaton( beautifully played, as is Ms. Woodward's character) shuns NYC for love; it won't play. Hence the underlying tension, the display of virtue by Paul that will never work. Just as it did not work for his promiscuous mother, played with seeringn intensity by Myrna Loy!

Wonderful score by the great Elmer Bernstein, and photography by the endlessly talented Leo Tover (watch the stampede sometime in tghen 1955 western, The Tall Men), and Mark Robson's smooth as silk direction.

636045,5,630338305X,"I bought this movie on a whim. I'm a big Paul Newman fan (who isn't?) and when I read the synopsis, it really caught my interest.

Paul Newman play Alfred Eaton who comes home from the war to broken home of degrading father and drunk mother (Myrna Loy). Desperate to get out, he and his friend decide to go into business together. Alfred's soul purpose is to make money, he wants a life of luxury, far away from the coal mining town he grew up in.

Shortly into the film Alfred meets Mary St. John (Joanne Woodward), she comes from an extremely rich family and is engaged. Knowing this does not stop Alfred from pursuing Mary, and eventually she gives into him, convinces her father he's a good match, and they marry. The one thing the couple agrees upon is that they want Alfred to succeed and make something of himself. Money is important, and Mary wants a husband of substance.

When the plane building business that Alfred has dreamed up doesn't quite work out for him, he's invited into the corporate world. This job is rich and fully lucrative, however, it keeps Alfred away from home weeks and months at time. His marriage suffers from this, and Mary ends up having affairs.

Alfred stays true to his wife, though he knows that his marriage is falling apart. And it's only until late in the film that he meets Natalie, daughter of a Coal Mine owner, that he truly realizes he is unhappy in his life. Natalie is played my Ina Balin, she is fresh-faced and sweet to watch. Alfred and Natalie's love grows slowly, and I felt myself caring for both characters.

The music fits the movie perfectly and I swooned a lot while watching it. It's bit soap-opera like but if you're interested in a classic romance, it's a good way to go. The actors are refining and Paul Newman is enjoyable to look at, of course.",1254960000,,1809,4.486322188449848

636101,5,630338305X,"This is one of my all-time favorites of Paul Newman (Alfred Eaton) and Joanne Woodward (Mary St. John). They play off each other magnificantly, she the upper crust, wealthy, spoiled socialite, he the forgotten son of a steel mill owner with a desire to prove his worth in money and business success because his father deprived him of self-worth and love. Newman does a great job early in the movie of communicating the pain of knowing his father loved his brother most and never really loved him. He was driven to prove he didn't need his father, he would show him he was worth something, his goal was to achieve great business success, be richer and more successful than his father ever was.  The MacHardie character (head of the Wall Street firm of J.D. MacHardie) portrays the businessman who has put the success and the reputation of the company ahead of family, personal relationships, and success in one's personal life.  Nothing matters more than the company--it's first, last, and foremost always, all else is to be sacrificed for the sake of the company.  His comment about marriage to an adulterous wife is less the sin than divorce because divorce breaks a contract and breaking a contract is condemnation on the reputation of the company.  As MacHardie said, adultery is just between man and wife and God, this so exemplifies the all-encompassing appetite of big business--globbling up people and lives and using them up, nothing matters more than the company, lives are lived based on what's best for the company.

The tenderness between Newman (Alfred now David to Natalie) and Balin (Natalie)is touching, it's love at first sight for her, even though she denies it.  Alfred sees the warmth and tenderness of a loving close family with Natalie and her father/mother; he has never experienced this family bond--not in his own family or in his marraige.  The relationship is wrong, but Natalie pursues Alfred without the sleazy feeling of an illicit affair. Ina Balin plays this role perfectly--innocent, caring, loving and kind, there is an instant bond between Alfred and Natalie and you feel the pain of their decision to end it but the relationship haunts them both.

Mary meantime has decided her socialite, partying life is just what she likes, and she flouts her affair with her old flame and fiancee in Alfred's face. She's confident Alfred will never give up his career and compromise his business success. Mary and Alfred grow completely apart and Alfred has to choose between his goal of bettering his father or giving it all up for the love of his life.

The music from Elmer Bernstein is beautiful for this movie.  And Joanne (Mary) is dressed to the nines--such a contrast in her beautiful dress designs and the simple clothing of Natalie, all pointing to Alfred's stark choice between his high-flying career and love.

There is something special about this movie over others Newman and Woodward have done (however, I do like The Long Hot Summer very much, lots of real romance between Newman and Woodward in that one since they were married just after that movie's release).  Newman has other great movies, such as Cat On A Hot Tin Roof and The Verdict, but I have watched From The Terrace many times and enjoy it each time.

636147,4,630338305X,"I didn't see what other reviewers apparently saw in this film. I did not see the moral of the film so much concerning the price of success as it being that despite your best efforts, you are often doomed to become your parents. At the beginning of the film, Alfred returns home after the second World War to renounce his father because he has, in Alfred's opinion, ignored his mother while strictly attending to business to the point where his mother has become an adulterous lush. Ten or fifteen years later, Alfred has ignored his own wife while climbing the corporate ladder until his own lonely wife has become an adulterous lush. The only crime of his father's he does not commit is to produce offspring that can be dragged into the mess his life has become. One person with a more warped moral code than either Alfred or Mary seems to be Alfred's boss. While eating lunch he casually informs Alfred of Mary's affair with an old flame. When Alfred reacts by saying that he intends to divorce Mary, his boss warns him against such an action. To Alfred's boss, Mary's behavior isn't a moral failing or a cry for attention - it is an unforgivable breach of etiquette. Overall, the main characters in this film lack redeeming characteristics to the point where the movie almost becomes a film noir soap opera.

Alfred Eaton (Paul Newman) is unloved by his father (Leon Ames) who resents him because he (Alfred) outlived his brother and overly-protected by his mother (a resplendently drunk Myrna Loy) who tells him that he can be nice sometimes but ""why is it that you are often so cold, Alfred? (In an inadvertently funny scene, Alfred derisively tiptoes out of her bedroom, while his inebriated mother goes on and on about her troubles...but I guess this is what passes as maternal love in the world of John O'Hara)
Alfred sets out for New York City to make his mark on the world and promptly falls in love with Mary St John (Joanne Woodward) much to the dismay of her parents. But then Alfred's father dies (he owns a big factory in Pennsylvania) and the St Johns make an about face and sanction the marriage of Alfred and Mary.
Then Alfred saves the life of the grandson of a big-wheel, disgustingly rich Wall Street Broker and Alfred's life turns around. For the Better: who can say?
Much is made of the dedicated corporate man who cares only about work, making lots of money, buying beautiful clothes and an even more beautiful apartment while his wife seeks solace elsewhere... versus the man who lives a simple life out in the country with a wife and two kids and a Studebaker...but is happy. In it's empty-headed way,
""FTT"" succeeds in making the simple life palatable, if pretty dull. But what man on Earth would choose Ina Balin over Joanne Woodward and a huge (looks like 10,000 square feet to me) apartment in the upper 80's on Fifth Avenue to boot?
Newman bluffs his way through the entire movie with his patented steely grimaces and blindingly good looks. Even Woodward, much less all the other men and women in this movie, fade to almost white when they are put into the same frame as Newman.
""From The Terrace"" is okay for that rainy day you feel like eating peanut butter out of the jar and quaffing a big magnum (you'll need it, this movie is way over 2 hours long) of good California Sparkling Wine. Invite some friends over: maybe they'll bring over the double Oreos and the large economy size jar of Cheese Whiz.",1112572800,9,2378,4.558411214953271
636152,4,630338305X,"A classic film adaptation from one of John O'Hara's massive tomes, Mark Robeson's ""From the Terrace"" holds its age well and is lots of fun to boot.
  Producer Director Mark Robson presents to us in the glossy grandeur of 20th Century-Fox the postwar portrait of a young man on the rise who sacrifices love for money, to a point that is.
  Paul Newman turns in an expertly colored performance as Alfred Newman. His brooding good looks and hard angles are the perfect reflection of young corporate America of the late 40's and 50's. Yet under that cool hard as coal exterior he hides a desire that only emerges toward the end of the film, yet it is there from the first frame of the film fueling his performance.
  Joanne Woodward as Mary St. John is no less brilliant. Her icy cool old money Mary is just the perfect fortress to entice Newman. She plays the part as if she were born to it and in the end she is left hard, jaded and desperate. She proves once again why she is still one of our best film actresses from the fifties who is still working today.
  Studio costume designer Travilla should be noted for his wonderful costumes. He was most famous for his designs in the 50's for Marilyn Monroe. Here he presents a stunningly elegant collection of the best looks of the late 50's and early 60's. His designs are rich and restrained and a feast for the eye.
  The score by the late great Elmer Bernstein is another masterpiece by this musical genius who's work spanned the from ""The Ten Commandments"" to ""Vanilla Sky"". It is a perfect score. Of particular note is the scene between Mary and her old lover at the ice-skating shed and the scene where Alfred rescues a drowning boy. These cues are magnificent and moving.
  ""From The Terrace"" is both trashy fun and a thought provoking view of money, power and sexual politics of mid century America.",1104710400,24,1853,4.514970059880239
636153,5,630338305X,"A view FROM THE TERRACE is what Paul Newman's character David Alfred Eaton has of his future wife Mary (JoAnne Woodward). The screen play was based on a best-selling novel of the same name by John O'Hara. Given it was released in the 1950s when sex on the screen was verboten and not much more explicit in novels (ban a book in Boston), one must appreciate the work it took for Newman and Woodward to give these performances.
Like many other teenagers of my generation, I was ""in love"" with Paul Newman. Newman could make female hearts flutter by simply looking at the camera with his big blue eyes.  Many other teens preferred Marlon Brando, his peer and rival for female affection.  I believe these two actors were the Leonardo de Caprio and Brad Pitt of their day, although in the long run, Newman (like de Caprio) has had more staying power and gracefully made the transition to mature roles.
In the 1950s, to see a film one had to attend a theater, where the screen was usually covered with a huge velvet curtain.  FTT played at the Center theater in my small town, and I saw the film six times after it was released. I was able to get into the theater for a quarter, and as my allowance was $3, this was no small sacrifice. So, you might say this film was one of my all time favorites.
Watching it again almost 50 years later, I wondered how I would react, and of course the passage of time and arrival of many other actors and vast changes in filmmaking have affected the way I view the film and Newman, but I still like him enormously, and this film holds it's own, though the storyline may seem archaic.
This film is about infidelity and divorce and the price of success, a story line that may be lost on generations raised in an age of no-fault divorces and dual earner households. Once upon a time, divorce and infidelity were considered absolutely scandalous, and financially disastrous. In fact, if you divorced, your life was ruined. Many couples stayed together and suffered the ignominy of a cheating spouse. FTT was a ground-breaking film because it tackled these issues head-on.
The DVD version of the film is well done, and the price reasonable (technicolor and cinemascope production). Do your self a favorite, buy this DVD and add it to the shelf where you keep CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF and other 50's favorites.",1089417600,62,2330,4.529691211401425
636154,4,630338305X,"I saw this movie for at least the third time today and I told myself: go ahead and get this on DVD because you watch it every time it comes on TV. Well, I just simply must have it near me. I love the ""how do you like them apples"" part in the movie. What a move! I love every minute of this movie. It is like a short story! I love the dialogue! Watch it people!",1080259200,5,360,3.688311688311688
636155,5,630338305X,"Paul Newman has many more famous roles...but for some reason, this is one of my all time favorite movies of his. It comes on the Love Stories, AMC, or TCM cable channels every here and now...or you could just buy it like I did.
He's nice, determined, well-meaning Alfred Eaton, who starts off with lofty, wealthy ideas about what is important in life...the right woman, the right career, the right friends...and showing them all how important he can be when he has them. Ultimately, he learns that what is important is only what feels right to him alone.
I love his story of personal discovery as much as his love affair story with Natalie. Alfred and Natalie have this beautiful scene where they are saying goodbye, they're barely touching, but it's the most painfully romantic thing to see.
Paul Newman and his wife Joanne Woodward have some excellent scenes in this movie also with real good comeback dialogue. He's the hardworking, decent man and she's the desperate-to-impress and just plain desperate society wife. She self-righteously and hurtfully accuses him of adultery with a girl with no guts when she's been sleeping with her ex-fiancee all along. She actually calls her lover and arranges a tryst while her husband is in the room!!!! She has guts!!!! (if little else) Unbeknownst to her, Alfred has exhaustingly if unaffectedly (if you can look unaffected and disgusted at the same time, that is) done his best to makes her invisible in the room, but she probably just becomes invisible without any real effort on his part to make her so by that point. Their voices just have the most impactful tones...especially when they get to play off of each other. I can play their final scene over and over again where she says she won't give him a divorce and he says,""Any further communication between you and me will be through legal channels."" He has the most genuine smile on that handsome face in that moment than through the entire movie!!!!!
This movie is actually pretty long, but not a moment is wasted. It all comes together in the end when Alfred finally chooses what he actually wants instead of what he's supposed to want.
Maybe it's because it's so subtle and not at all like a ""movie"" that it seems to be largely overlooked by everyone except me and 20 other people. Paul Newman is one fine, naturally classy actor, I say.",1078531200,10,2343,4.7310513447432765
636156,4,630338305X,"Every few years, I sit back and enjoy ""From the Terrace"" for what it is. As good old fashioned ""potboiler"", John O Hara's screen adaptation is not quite as sprawling as say....Edna Ferber's works, but nonetheless is a decent potboiler  in its own right. Alfred (Paul Newman),  discharged from the Navy after WW II is the ambitious, disaffected son of nouveau riche steel mill owner Samuel Eaton, (Leon Ames). Seeking to make his own unique mark in the world he spurns his father's hopes of joining the business and decides his fortune is to be made elsewhere. Along the way, he meets his future blue-blooded trophy wife Mary St. John (Joanne Woodward) and soon discovers her appetites are far in excess even to his own ambitions. Landing a job at a prestigious Wall Street firm in an oblique way that is a potboiler's trademark, Alfred comes under the watchful eye of old money and traditional expectations by J.D. MacHardie (masterfully portrayed by Felix Aylmer). I very much enjoyed all the scenes in which Aylmer's MacHardie was highlighted and I can almost smell the stodginess of old money, ritual table manners, wood paneled walls, cigars, and brandy that were part of his ultra-conservative environment. Soon enough, while on a trip to scout business opportunities, Alfred meets Natalie (Ina Balin), the unattached daughter of a wealthy coal mine owner. Knowing full well of his marital status, she consents, even encourages his attention and unfaithfulness. Balin manages to pull this off with a naive sweetness without ever seeming cheap or trashy.  Infidelity is a major theme in this work and I'm sure its frank discussion must have sparked many a controversy when this film was released very early in 1960. Veteran actress Myrna Loy was given near top billing as Alfred's alcoholic and unfaithful mother, yet her on-screen performance was limited to the first reel of this nearly 2 1/2 hour film. I  enjoyed the  brief on screen appearance of young Barbara Eden as a flirtatious socialite. Patrick O'Neal was perfectly cast as the smarmy Dr. Jim Roper, the illicit lover of Mary St. John. Over his long acting career, Paul Newman has delivered solid performances again and again. This is one of his lesser known works but serves as a fine example of why he was so popular with the audience as a silver screen heartthrob. Watching this film today and being mindful of his lasting marriage to Joanne Woodward just serves to make this movie all the more compelling to me.  I hope you will agree.",1065484800,38,2505,4.882352941176471

7845020,4,630338305X,"I'm a sucker for soapy 1950s films and this one could be the ideal type of such films. Based on John O'Hara's novel, another of his treatises of the normative 1950s upper-middle-to-upper class settings, the film captures the spirit of establishment white mores and folkways in Northeastern America. World War II returning soldier Newman, as the second (in multiple senses of that term) son, Alfred (David) Eaton, first confronts his oppressive steel mill owner father Sam (played with dynamic bluster by Leon Ames) and comforts his alcoholic mother Martha (played with melodramatic abandon by Myrna Loy), before heading to New York City to, as he later puts it, make big money amid big businessmen to outdo his verbally abusive father. Along the way, he meets his wife-to-be (and real life wife) Joanne Woodward, who turns in the best performance of the film as the amoral, materialistic, and (at the time) scandalous upper class debutante, Mary St. John. Through a sequence of accidental encounters, Newman's Alfred/David becomes a rising star on Wall Street, doing the bidding of his stuffy superior, James MacHardie, played with all the snobby grandeur by the great British character actor, Felix Aylmer. Alfred/David's turning point occurs on one of his many prolonged business trips, when he meets his ""true love girl,"" Natalie Benziger, played with soft 1950s femininity by Ina Balin. Natalie wishes to call Newman's character David, which, as it turns out, is his first name. This subtle shift in naming serves as a metaphor of Newman's transformation from the person his father created (Alfred) to the more romantic seeker of the ethereal (David). From there, the philosophical roots of O'Hara's novels become central to the film's discourse. Does commerce always corrupt? Can one be a success in a capitalistic world and still value human life? How important is marriage to the maintenance of a particular society? Does love for its own sake undermine our societal contract? What constitutes success and does it include or exclude happiness as idealized in our culture? The film is pretty choppy; the sex is, as the times would warrant, more implicit than explicit (making it more interesting, in my opinion); and the performances are uneven. As mentioned, Woodward's performance is superb and the aforementioned supporting actors chime in as dictated by the melodramatic tone. Other roles such as Woodward/Mary's lover, ""Grim Jim"" Roper and Newman/Alfred's idle-rich business partner, George Grizzard, are played with confidence by Patrick O'Neal and George Grizzard, respectively. Newman has not yet found his ""acting chops"" and seems to telegraph his emotions and delivery. Obviously, he looks great and does have his moments that foreshadow his greatness-to-come, but he's not ""there"" as yet. The supporting actors often out-do him in several scenes. Also watch for Barbara Eden, playing adventurous society-girl Clemmie Shreve, Ted de Corsia, playing the good-guy capitalist and Natalie's father, Ralph Benziger, and Elizabeth Allen, playing the mischievous, seemingly carefree, upper-crust, and young married WASP woman, Sage Remington. All three give the film breaths of fresh air in their limited capacities. I see the flaws of the film, but for some reason(s), I do not get tired of watching it!",1501804800,,3313,5.312380952380952
