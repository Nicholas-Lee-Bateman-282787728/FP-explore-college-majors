The towel work is a varitation on the wand, just using a towel instead.  Nothing new.  The mat work is neither integritive, nor classical.  Joe would laugh at it.............",1079136000,,237,5.184210526315789
7970553,5,B00006JN3D,"A motivating and challenging fusion of traditional Pilates matwork, Ron Fletcher inspired towelwork, and contemporary innovations, this video is the only of its kind.  In no other video will you find this dynamic, modern approach to Pilates work.  Top-notch Master Teacher Kathy Corey artfully leads three of her students as they demonstrate beginners, intermediate & advanced variations.  This video finally makes the wonderful West Coast Pilates tradition available to a wider audience.",1066089600,,488,5.75
7970554,5,B00006JN3D,Wonderful video. Complete and thorough. Excellent presentation and true to the real Pilates. I did research on instructor Corey and found out she is Master Teacher who learned Pilates from a Master Teacher taught by Joseph Pilates himself! Great credibilty! Nice to know the real thing in an ocean of wanna be's! Video contains important basics and provides for a real challenge for advanced students. Long term resource- great value.,1065571200,2,434,5.214285714285714
7970555,5,B00006JN3D,"The best feature of this video series is that beginner, intermediate and advance positions/techniques are demonstrated and explained.  Progression can be done as appropriate for the student or particular area of the body just by watching a different person.  There is voice overlay of special instructions and breath patterns. Exercises are varied and paced well for a good work-out.",1052956800,,383,5.47457627118644

7970557,5,B00006JN3D,Great workout.  Video details basic pilates principles and offers a total body workout.  I have sculpted and legthened areas of my body that I have never been able to reach.  The video is clear and easy to follow.  All levels of instruction and I have quickly advanced.  Highly recommend.  Worth every penny.,1035763200,3,308,4.826923076923077
