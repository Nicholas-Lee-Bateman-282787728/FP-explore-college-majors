I watched this movie without reading the 1939 Dame Agatha Christie novel that it was based on.  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.

Here is the timeline of this movie:

1896 SOUTH AFRICA: two diamond smugglers turn on each other.
FORWARD 40 years later, London, England.
DEC. 21:  Chief Inspector Japp (Phil Jackson) gives Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) a Christmas present.  Later this day, Poirot is called by a stranger to his home to spend the Christmas.
DEC. 22: A murder takes place.  Was it actually a suicide?  Poirot investigates with the help of Police Superintendent Sugden (Mark Tandy) and later, Chief Inspector Japp.
DEC. 23: The investigation continues.  Poirot buys Japp an expensive Christmas present.
DEC. 24: The investigation continues.  An attempted murder occurs.  Poirot opens Japp's present.
DEC. 25: Poirot solves the murder.  Poirot gives Japp his present.

Who are the people Poirot spends the Christmas with?  They are as follows:

1) Simeon Lee, the rich stranger who calls Poirot to his home (Vernon Dobtcheff)
2) Alfred Lee, one of Simeon's sons (Simon Roberts)
3) Ludia, Alfred's wife (Cathy Babett)
4) George Lee, a politician and another of Simeon's sons (Eric Carte)
5) Magdalene, George's wife (Andree Bernard)
6) Harry Lee, yet another of Simeon's sons (Brian Gwaspari)
7) Pilar Estonbodus, Simean's Spanish granddaughter (Sasha Behar)
8) Horbury, Simeon's valet (Ayub Kwan Din)
9) Tressilian, Simeon's butler (John Horsley)

As usual, Suchet's performance stands out.  He gives a stellar performance portraying Poirot.  Dobtcheff as the wealthy Simeon Lee also does a good job in his role.

This movie kept me guessing right to the very end as to whom the murderer was.  There was good interaction between all the major characters and especially between Japp and Poirot.

The cinematography is visually stunning.  All costumes and props are authentic looking.

The DVD has the usual text extras.  Newcomers to the series might find these
interesting.

Finally, this movie is a solid murder mystery that can be viewed anytime, not just at Christmas time.

In conclusion, this is a fun movie even if you have read the novel it's based on!!

1626790,5,B00005MM5H,"Hercule Poirot's Christmas is an absolute delight.  It's the perfect synergy between book and film, writer and director. As a long time reader of Agatha Christie and devotee of her inimitable Hercule Poirot and his little gray cells, I had expected to enjoy this video.  But what impressed me was the superb dramatic pacing, the use of music to accent and develop the story, and the characters' living, breathing authenticity.  David Suchet is as always the perfect, palpable incarnation of our Belgian detective and as for Philip Jackson, he is Chief Inspector Japp. All the actors, however, clearly seem to thrive under the excellent direction of Edward Bennett.  There's just the right balance of humor and suspense, that splash of wit and verve in a serious story of greed and retribution.
  Poirot's Christmas isn't just for the holidays, although for me it will become a tradition like viewing the original ""Christmas in Connecticut.""  Poirot's Christmas is the sort of feast that you'll never tire of enjoying and I am sure the little gray cells will agree.",1016236800,11,1064,5.011363636363637
1626791,5,B00005MM5H,"David Suchet does a superlative job with the character of Hercule Poirot in all of the BBC productions of Dame Agatha Christie's short stories and novels, but HERCULE POIROT'S CHRISTMAS, one of the lesser known books, has become one of the best of the video adaptations.
Loaded with appropriate Christmas atmosphere and sly Poirot humor (getting an unwanted Christmas gift, attempting to eat brown Windsor soup), CHRISTMAS finds Poirot investigating the vicious throat slashing of wealthy Simeon Lee in a locked room, a man who had just the day before hired Poirot to visit him as all of his children come home for the holidays. He suspects there is no love lost for him among several of his kin, and he's right. With a local superintendent and the ever-reliable Chief Inspector Japp present to assist, Poirot and his little gray cells have seldom operated so judiciously and adroitly.
Production values are lavish this time around. Period details of the 1930s are accurate, and Lee's manse-like abode offers large, beautifully appointed rooms and lots of shadowy hallways and anterooms for plotting and observing.
As has been the case with the other Acorn releases of these television productions, the video is presented in 4:3 ratio. There is marvelous Dolby surround sound in this one, though, and when those wonderful angelic voices begin singing nostalgic carols that wrap around you, you just want to sit back, close your eyes, and listen. Alas, such a plan will cause you to miss some vital clues to the solution of the mystery. The usual and wanting special features have been brought over from previous releases. One longs for a ""making of"" documentary on these marvelous transcriptions of Christie's masterworks.
You can't go wrong with this one!",1001721600,46,1756,5.058620689655172
1626792,5,B00005MM5H,"<Hercule Poirot's Christmas> When Acorn Media began to issue the shorter and longer Hercule Poirot episodes with David Suchet as the Belgium sleuth, they issued a brochure that did not include some of the ""movie length"" (103 min.) mysteries. Since then, they have gotten the rights to several, among which is ""Hercule Poirot's Christmas,"" now available on DVD.
 The murderer in this one is reminiscent of that in another more famous Christie tale, but I will not ruin your fun by saying which. You can e-mail me if you wish the other title. Nevertheless, this story involves one of the great Nasties in Christiedom, Simeon Lee (played to repulsive perfection by Vernon Dobtcheff), whose three pleasures are kissing his diamonds, making passes at women, and tormenting his children. When the inevitable happens, we have the closest Christie ever brings us to a John Dickson Carr ""locked room"" puzzle. As with Carr situations, the elaborate scheme of committing the crime is barely probable, even though we get to see it done in a flashback. But we watch these things for the fun of it.
 Suchet is as ever the incarnation of the annoying little penguin-like Poirot; and the art design is as ever as perfect as could be with its period details, especially inside the little shop where the detective stumbles upon a vital clue. Philip Jackson is still the stolid Chief Inspector Japp, still jumping to conclusions but still respectful of Poirot's opinions. The Watson-like Hastings is not in this episode, nor is the delightful Miss Lemon.
 As with the other DVDs in this series, we have some unanimated special features concerning Christie, Poirot novels and quotations, Suchet, and some filmographies of some actors in this film.",997920000,25,1727,5.010452961672474
1626793,5,B00005MM5H,"PBS frequently broadcasts Poirot's Christmas over the holidays, but never mind, the story is so wonderful and filled with so many characters it's fun to watch any time of year. And, it's simply beautiful. I for one am glad to see the DVD arrive.
Hercule Poirot is not a religious man, nor a particularly sentimental man. He had planned to spend a quiet Christmas holiday alone. Ms Lemon is away visiting her sister, and Hastings is seeking his fortune in South America. A day or two before the Christmas, a disagreeable and wealthy old man, used to others responding to his bidding, insists Poirot spend his holiday with him at his country estate near a small village. The old man says someone wants to kill him and he wants Poirot to find out who it is and put a stop to it.
Poirot declines the job, not only because he would prefer the comfort his own apartment and the cold damp weather outside makes the prospect of traveling unpleasant, but because he instantly dislikes the old man. However, Poirot's apartment heat fails (we see his vintage dripping radiator) and as his landlord cannot make repairs until after the holiday, Poirot is soon on a train out of town.
Poirot arrives in the little village via a vintage London train and there he meets the old man's relatives including a prodigal son and a never-seen-before granddaughter who turn out to have been Poirot's train companions. Are these children to be trusted? Why did the newly arrived son return? Can the apparently pleasant and ""good"" son and daughter-in-law who have been caring for the old man be trusted? Why does the old man keep a large diamond in a safe in his room? Before long, someone is dead and Poirot and a local police inspector are on the case.
This story is not the usual game of ""clue"" played in the big country house. In a preview scene, a pair of young men have been shown sitting before a campfire somewhere in Africa discussing which of them will travel to town to register a diamond claim. Disaster strikes and before long one man is dead and the other dying. The dying young man is rescued by a less than beautiful  woman whom he later seduces and abandons.
Of course the survivor from Africa is the nasty old man with the fortune who has engaged Poirot to protect him, but how does his  past figure into the current plot--or does it? The wily Christie has been known to drop a red herring or two along the way.
The mystery takes place in a snowy village from a Currier and Ives print. Poirot stays at a local inn (where he picks up an invaluable clue) where one can almost feel the warm fire in the old fireplace, hear the crackling pine cones, and smell the lovely Christmas greenery and plum pudding. A sweet exchange of sentiments and gifts takes place between Poirot and Japp (who is called in when the local police cannot solve the crime). A vicarious thrill for Anglophiles.",994550400,14,2873,4.555125725338491

1626816,5,B00005MM5H,"For those unfamiliar with Agatha Christie's 1938 novel, the set-up is that fussy Belgian detective Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) reluctantly accepts creepy tycoon Simeon Lee's invitation for a case simply to avoid freezing (from a broken furnace) in his posh London apartment during the week of Christmas.  Starting with a tacked-on South African prologue set forty years before, it is made abundantly clear that slimeball British prospector Simeon Lee is a treacherous, greedy rogue who may well see his comeuppance one day.

Bragging to Poirot about his wealth (including a stash of South African diamonds), decrepit, wheelchair-bound Simeon reveals that he intends to announce changing his will simply to enjoying watching his surviving adult heirs (three sons; two daughters-in-law; and a granddaughter) squirm.  If anything, hating sleazy old Simeon and sponging off his vast wealth goes hand in hand in the Lee household.  Inevitably, later that night, elderly Simeon is found brutally murdered in his ransacked, locked study.  No surprise, his vaunted diamonds have been stolen from the safe.  Retrieving a grateful Inspector Japp (Phillip Jackson) from a miserable stay with his in-laws, Poirot (with help from Japp and local cop Sugden) tries to decipher who killed Simeon Lee and why.  With a household full of suspects (and a few servants to boot), who ingeniously has the perfect alibi to viciously murder the Lee patriarch and then seemingly vanish into thin air?

The only flaw here is that the adapted script (likely due to time constraints) drops too many broad hints leaving the ""how"" the most intriguing part of the mystery.  Even so, in large part due to its terrific cast, ""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"" is a wonderful opportunity for mystery fans wanting a cure from a cold winter's night.  As a suggestion, you may also like to find Suchet's 3rd series one-hour adaptation of ""The Theft of the Royal Ruby"" (aka ""Adventure of the Christmas Pudding""), which offers another Yuletide treat from Hercule Poirot.

1626817,5,B00005MM5H,"There are two general reasons to watch the Hercule Poirot character (played by David Suchet and based on the Agatha Christie novels): one, you want to try and solve very difficult murders with arguably outlandish clue trails and/or you enjoy traveling about the investigation with Poirot. Speaking of Poirot his humor is sometimes obtuse and other times direct. That's how Poirot ""rolls"". He's a dignified, stocky investigator who loves his comforts, especially fine cuisines and desserts. In fact, in the opening part of this tale his apartment heater breaks down around Christmas and one of the reasons he agrees to come out a snowy estate is because the owner has indoor heating. You will see  a lot of that type of humor if you go through the series (this is my second Poirot episode so I'm pretty new). Poirot comes across as painfully diplomatic but if you listen/watch closely you will see there is the faintest of sarcasm intended. Pay attention to how he reacts to the gloves he receives as a Christmas present which will match with none of his attire, especially as to why he does not put them on right away per the request of the gift giver.

In this tale a grizzled old timer asks Poirot to come to his estate for a family Christmas get together because he fears he is going to be murdered for his wealth in diamonds (and maybe for being a real jerk to everybody). There's a lot of suspicious characters and a lot of passing references that only make sense to the sharpest of people (usually just Poirot I am discovering heh). But don't worry if you don't solve it or even get half of the clues as half of the fun is simply watching the ""over the top"" clue trails make sense. Poirot, of course, is implacable in his investigation, so expect him to keep pushing and questioning even if you have no clue what he is about. Again, that's how he ""rolls"". There is the classic revealing of the crime and criminal(s) at the end.

David Suchet is subtly brilliant in his role as Hercule Poirot and truly part of the pleasure is witnessing his mastery in action. I'm very glad somebody finally recommended this series and character to me. I appreciate my action and romantic comedies as much as anybody else but sometimes I want something with more intellectual depth. An interesting quote from the novels (the first one was written in 1938, by the way) in regards to Poirot was "". . .  his attire was almost incredible; I believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound."" (Wiki)

Poirot is one of Christie's most famous and long-lived characters, appearing in 33 novels, one play, and more than 50 short stories published between 1920 and 1975 and set in the same era (Wiki). I look forward to exploring more of the series.

1626818,5,B00005MM5H,"""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"" was one of my favorite stories by Agatha Christie. Thus, I already knew who did it when I watched this. The story does not perfectly follow the book -- the prologue in this version is missing from the book. And if I remember correctly, one of the son's names changed. To one who read the book, those elements and various other scenes were obvious. Enough to keep me from enjoying it? No. My hunch is one who hasn't read it may not put one and one together until the ending.

1626819,5,B00005MM5H,"""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"" is a 1hour, 45 minute feature-length episode from Series 6 of ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"", which originally aired on Britain's ITV in 1995. On December 21, 1936, Hercule Poirot is looking forward to a quiet Christmas in London with his Belgian chocolates, when the central heating in his apartment building breaks down. An elderly Simeon Lee (Vernon Dobtcheff), much hated and feared president of Zwartland River Mining Company, a diamond mining operation in South Africa, telephones Poirot to ask that the detective spend Christmas at  his stately English home. The irascible Lee thinks his life may be in danger.

Simeon Lee has invited his estranged son Harry (Brian Gwaspari) and Spanish granddaughter Pilar (Sasha Behar) for the holidays. His sons Alfred (Simon Roberts) and George (Eric Carte) live at the house with their wives. Lee intends to announce a change in his will that he expects will ruffle his children's feathers. Soon after doing so, he is found dead in his bedroom, his throat slit and the first raw diamonds that he mined, which he kept for sentimental reasons, gone from his safe. The local police investigator Superintendent Sugden (Mark Tandy) arrives on the scene, and Poirot rescues Inspector Japp (Philip Jackson) from this in-laws in Wales to assist on the case.

Neither Miss Lemon and Capt. Arthur Hastings feature in this story, and the mystery departs a little from the 1938 novel on which it is based. But it is a lot of fun. A little creepy for holiday entertainment, perhaps. Everyone in the house had motive and opportunity to kill Simeon Lee, so Poirot has his work cut out for him. Unusually, he is working with not one, but two, of England's finest. I missed the bright, modernist architecture, which is the antithesis of Lee's dark, overdecorated home. But it's an entertaining mystery with a great cast. For another Poirot Christmas, this one with a touch of humor, see ""The Theft of the Royal Ruby"" from Series 3.

The DVD (Acorn 2001): This disc includes the usual Collector's Set bonus features. There is a text interview of David Suchet, a brief text bio of Agatha Christie, a list of Poirot books, selective filmographies of 4 cast members, and 4 Poirot quotes. There are also 10 Poirot trivia questions with answers. No subtitles.",1308355200,,2307,4.9689119170984455
1626820,5,B00005MM5H,"When most families get together for Christmas, they can end up wanting to kill each other. Most don't actually do it.

But when a family patriarch is a malevolent old lecher like Simeon Lee, and you have Hercule Poirot as a houseguest, it's no surprise when somebody ends up dead. The adaptationof ""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"" is a decidedly unsentimental little Yuletide murder mystery, full of snow-covered manorhouses, gruesome noises and the occasional Welsh carol choir.

Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) is all set to celebrate Christmas at home... until his heating dies. Coincidentally, creepy old diamond mogul Simeon Lee calls, asking him to come over for Christmas.

Lee is also gathering his adult children at his house -- a stuffy MP and his slinky wife, a downtrodden son and his increasingly fed-up wife, a globe-trotting ""black sheep"" and a beautiful Spanish granddaughter Pilar (Sasha Behar). Unfortunately after Lee reveals the intention of changing his will and antagonizes his sons, the house is roused by a gruesome howl -- and he's found with his throat cut in a locked room.

So Poirot lassos Inspector Japp (Philip Jackson) from his in-laws' chorale to help local cop Sugden (Mark Tandy) -- especially since Lee has not only been killed, but his uncut diamonds have been stolen.  Secrets and lies begin to come out of the woodwork, as the impossible crime's workings become more evident to Poirot's little grey cells. Now he must solve it before another Yuletide murder happens.

In theory ""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"" has everything a Christmas movie should have -- gifts, mistletoe, a snow-drifted English countryside, a big old house.. Of course, the outer trappings are where the Christmas spirit stops, and the murderous stuff begins -- although it's only moderately hard to figure out the murderer's identity.

There's plenty of suspense and odd little clues strewn through the plot, along with a plethora of suspects who would have liked to see Simeon cold'n'dead, but who couldn't possibly have gotten inside. And while the investigation is pretty straightforward, it's strewn with some surprising revelations about a couple of the family members. Not to mention a strange old lady who comes into town and seems VERY happy about Simeon's demise.

To give it a festive air, Poirot and Japp have some holiday struggles. The Belgian sleuth has to find a present for his Scotland Yard buddy, while Japp is being tortured by his Welsh in-laws' constant caroling (""I have come to rescue you, mon ami""). And the scripting is full of clever little prods (""You two should get on, being foreign,"" Harry Lee says to the Spanish Pilar and Belgian Poirot).

As always, David Suchet is superb as Poirot -- dapper, precise, with a mind that neatly coils around all the clues and sees where they fit, and a subtle brand of wit (""My family hate me, you know."" ""It is not hard to see why, Monsieur""). The actors playing the assorted spawn (and in-laws) of Simeon all do a thoroughly solid job, from Andre Bernard doll-like Magdalena to Brian Gwaspari's weatherbeaten Harry. Behar is never quite convincing as Pilar, though.

""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"" is thankfully devoid of sentimental reason-for-the-season dribbling -- it's all about dysfunctional families, gruesome murder and too-big gloves.",1226966400,2,3310,5.12430426716141
1626821,5,B00005MM5H,"I am an avid fan of David Suchet's Poirot and I have all the DVD releases.  This is one I enjoyed very much.  As in the book, no Captain Hastings in this one, but the loyal Inspector Japp is rescued from his Christmas vacation at the in-laws to head the case.  It's one of Christie's better stories with a great ending.  While not as detailed and engrossing as the book, it's still an intertaining view.",1184112000,,403,4.333333333333333
1626822,4,B00005MM5H,"Adapted by Clive Exton, this 1994 production of Christie's novel, Hercule Poirot's Christmas (1938), provides viewers with another fine mystery with the pitch perfect David Suchet playing the famous Belgian detective. Exton manages to capture well the professional yet affectionate relationship between Chief Inspector James Japp (Philip Jackson) and Poirot. In one scene, executed with subtle humor, Poirot opens his Christmas gift (from Japp) and Poirot's reaction is priceless. The reference to the same gift at the end of the program is also amusing, if only to emphasize Poirot's gracious acceptance of an unwanted item which Japp knowingly recognizes.

It is this easy humor which makes this particular mystery entertaining given the dark backdrop in which the events take place. The focus rests on an aged patriarch, Simeon Lee (Vernon Dobtcheff), a greedy and sadistic man, whose intention to alter his will during the Christmas season leads to his violent death. Scattered throughout Gorston Hall remain his extended family and servants, all possible suspects in another example of a locked room mystery.

Mr. Exton's adaptation wisely omits several characters thereby lessening the confusion slightly. While this choice makes possible the coherence of a plot which must unfold in under two hours, I was slightly disappointed that Exton excised the clue of the `excess blood' which was significant to the novel. Although this removal does not ruin the story itself, it lessens Christie's intention, which was for her, an unusual choice.

Christie wrote Hercule Poirot's Christmas and dedicated the novel to her brother-in-law, James, with the promise of writing a tale with greater violence (and blood) given his criticism of her previous novels possessing an ""antiseptic"" flavor to them. By emphasizing the blood which poured forth from the hapless Simeon Lee, we readers feel a bit vindicated that a disreputable man has met with his just desserts.
