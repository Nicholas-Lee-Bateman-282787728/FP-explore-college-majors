8669396,5,B00M0JTSUM,"This movie is so off-the-wall that I still laugh just thinking about it.  Admittedly not for everyone, but if you are a bit weird (like me) you'll really enjoy it.
I waited for years for this to come out on DVD and it is just as funny as I remembered it.  A real boffo socko laugh.  Who'da believed that Eli Wallach had this in him?",1435276800,4,332,4.076923076923077
8669397,5,B00M0JTSUM,"This wonderful film is vintage Eli Wallach.  It's a thoroughly charming and funny version of  ""The Ransom of Red Chief.""  It's in my collection of all-time funniest films.",1433462400,4,171,5.035714285714286

I rate It Excellent+ and Recommend It highly.
No Menu of any kind.
Beautiful Clear Picture and Great Sound.
Start of movie the Music reminded me of the film Munster Go Home!
Saw this film when I was A young boy liked It then and I like It now.
You sure can tell that this Is New York everybody wrapped up In his or her problems of the day.
Ben the postman was no exception he was getting tired of getting swashed all the time by everyone.
Leo and his family ripping up their lawn getting rid of the Crab Grass he thinks?
Leo wants to trade his wife for Jerry's,no kidding kids included.
All of the Sleepy-Eyed Executives going to the office If they ever get there.
Mr. Kelly loves to watch his Cartoons In bed all day and all night he kind of Adopts Ben.
So many funny moments and surprises In this movie the kid playing horsey on the subway.
Female Impersonator was really good Ben desired her that Is until?
The Policeman was really fun to watch reminded me of the actor,the Late Fred Gwynne.
Charles Nelson Reilly always A pleasure to watch.
Small part for Dustin Hoffman reminded me of the movies The Graduate and Midnight Cowboy.
James Luisi as Pete he was In The Rifleman as Chuley Carr In the episode 'Sporting Chance.'
Another familiar face would be Judith Lowry as an Elderly Woman she was In Car 54 Where Are You?
In the Episode 'Something Nice For Sol.' she was In the shoe store.
I enjoyed this movie so much and was laughing pretty much all through It.
You will laugh your ass off at this movie!
Has A Unique COOL ENDING also.",1432252800,4,1552,4.300341296928328

8669400,5,B00M0JTSUM,"One of the very best zany movies ever made.  Wallach and Jackson are superb and perfectly cast in this off beat comedy.  Its just sad that it has been out of print for so long.  Haven't been able to find it for purchase in recent years till now.  The video and audio quality of the Amazon on Demand DVD is as good as any ready made disk.  If you are a fan of Wallach and/or Jackson, or if you just want a good belly laugh, this is a must have.  It has been many years since I first saw this movie, but it still cracks me up!  I know I will watch it again and again. The sight of Wallach carrying a gunny sack through the dark city streets, on the hunt for a woman, is just too funny for words.  The only thing funnier is the look on his face when he realizes he caught the wrong woman!  And you thought you had problems!  Enjoy!",1408752000,9,828,3.933734939759036
