The lead actor Gordon Mitchell had a very nice cut physique but that isn't the whole problem I had. The film was way too grainy and the acting even for these movies were sub par. I always get that these movies are not going to shine at all but I do expect some quality and it is lacking all around here.",1495670400,,393,3.925

Before going into the merits of the film itself, I must say something about the technical aspects, something I usually do not care about much. But in this case you must be aware, that the quality of both image and sound is POOR. This is a rather BAD TRANSFER from a clearly badly used copy - and therefore if quality of image and sound are very important to you, I would advise against buying it, as viewing it can be a frustrating experience.

That being said, I personally have spend a very good moment re-watching this old B-movie, which I watched only once before, AGES ago, on a black and white TV in communist Poland, when I was still a little boy. And I am very happy that I bought ""Fury of Achilles"" because, believe it or not, this is still the BEST film on Trojan war to be made yet. It is better than the old ""Helen of Troy"" and definitely better than the pathetic Wolfgang Petersen's ""Troy"" with Brad Pitt.

The reasons why I consider this old B-movie as the best cinematographic adaptation of ""Iliad"" yet, are the following:

- ""Fury of Achilles"" respects greatly the original text of ""Iliad""; it begins in the 10th year of war and it ends with the scene in which Hector's body is ransomed; even the title is very well chosen, as indeed the ""Iliad"" begins with words about the wrath of Achilles

- as in ""Iliad"", in this film Trojan War is waged not only by mortals but also by gods; the immortals send omens and messages to their champions; they send them sometimes gifts to help them; they can hide them from the sight of their enemies; and they can even show their own terrifying wrath if they are gravely offended

- Achilles is presented here much better than in other films; he is not a snotty primadonna as in ""Helen of Troy"" and definitely not an emo/bipolar jerk as Brad Pitt portrayed him in ""Troy""; here he is a powerful warlord, respected, loved and feared by his Myrmidon troops; he certainly has a temper and pride as great as his physical strength - but he is definitely not a brainless brute, much to the contrary

- Gordon Mitchell, who plays Achilles, made an excellent job in this film and I think chosing him for this role was a very good decision; born as Charles A. Pendleton, as a young man he served in US Army in WWII and saw real combat up close and personal (he was wounded and taken prisoner in the Battle of Bulge); he later re-enlisted and served again with distinction during the Korean War; between the wars he went to college and became a high school teacher; because of his size (he was 6 feet 5 inches and build like a tank, even BEFORE going into body-building) and his quite threatening face he teached mostly the particularly difficult classes, composed of young delinquents; after the Korean War he became an adept of body-building and a stuntsman in Hollywood, before going to Italy where under the name Gordon Mitchell he played in more than one hundred of sword and sandal films and spaghetti westerns; ""Fury of Achilles"" was amongst his first films and it was definitely his greatest role ever; when he died at age of 80 in 2003, amongst people whe came to his funeral was a certain Arnold Schwarzenegger, a long-time fan...

- also most of other main characters are present and described very faithfully to the original; Agamemnon, Odysseus, Priam, Chryzes and Andromache are good; Bryzeis, Patroclus and Hector are VERY good; there are only few clearly visible changes compared to ""Iliad"": Sarpedon watches the fight between Achilles and Hector from the walls of Troy instead of being earlier killed by Patroclus; Patroclus falls head over hills in love with a voluptous slave girl he captured and took to his bed earlier during war; Apollo punishes the Greeks by lightnings rather than plague, etc. But those are only minor changes - this film mostly sticks very faithfully to the ""Iliad""

- dialogs are suprisingly good! In most of those old Italian B-movies dialogs are very silly, sometimes borderline idiotic - but not here! Especially good is the scene when Achilles tames Brizeis, who initially is (understandingly) very much against having sex with a man who just one day before burned her city and brought her to his tent by force - it is definitely better than the ridiculous scene between Brad Pitt and Rose Byrne in ""Troy"". Relations between Agamemnon and Achilles are also an occasion to some pretty good scenes, as is the taunting of Hector by Achilles, to make him come out and fight...

- the climactic fight between Achilles and Hector is a very, VERY good (and long) scene - and I was really moved by it...

- last but not least, the overhelming weight of ""ananke"", the unescapable destiny, is omnipresent in this film, as it was in the original text; both Achilles and Hector know their fate in advance - but neither of them will run from it; one will boldly challenge the gods and try to change his destiny, the other one will walk towards his fate with his head up, laughing silently in gods faces...

So bottom line, even if five stars can seem a lot for an old, mostly forgotten Italian B-movie with a body-builder in the main role, I can not help it - I liked this film a lot, I spend a really good moment watching it and therefore I must give it the highest note (even if the quality of the image and sound really sucked). A recommended viewing. Enjoy!",1363824000,3,5439,4.538775510204082
