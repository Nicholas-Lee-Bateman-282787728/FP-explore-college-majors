8593336,5,B001U3YNFY,"Having known Fred Pryor for a number of years and benefiting from his wisdom and kindness, I was excited to see this video from History Means Business and i was not disappointed.  I learned things I didn't know about Fred Pryor, but was also treated to examples of his extraordinary wisdom about people.  His kindness and generosity led him to create the first one-day business seminar company and this great video gives the  viewer some insight into how all that developed.  I am so happy there is a company like History Means Business that is recording and interviewing business people who have made a difference!  Business schools should definitely show these videos to classes of upcoming entrepreners!",1243814400,,706,5.0
