1086413,4,6305854416,"This is a straight-forward but silly and lame parody of the Blair Witch Project. It gets the camcorder look of the original right, but is terribly written and acted, and full of unfunny jokes. This is as ""B"" as a B movie can get.
So, why do I give it 4 stars? It gets one each for the four fabulous babes that spend most of the film hiking in the great outdoors while nearly or completely naked. I especially enjoyed the tough-yet-voluptuous-and-beautiful Julie K Smith. If I weren't already happily married, I'd love to go hiking with her.
Enjoy!",1006992000,3,547,4.5353535353535355
1086414,4,6305854416,"This movie was suprisingly kind of funny and had some really hot girls.  It was only about an hour and 10 minutes though, and could have used much more of a story.  I wouln't waste 90 bucks on it though, just watch it on statilete.",993513600,,231,4.111111111111111
1086415,5,6305854416,"This movie couldn't be more sexy or more hilarious. I liked The Blair Witch Project but this movie was a lot more fun & easy on the eye.  Nikki,Julie & Lorissa are absolute knockouts!  The other girl was not  to shabby either. Even girls that are not to uptight about watching T&A  movies will find it very funny. Sorry Heather Donahue but, Nikki Fritz out  did you on this sleeper. Even the guy called Lunk was funny. If you like  any of the four girls in this show you will want to own this soon to be  classic. The part where Julie does the(I'm sorry for everything scene) is  worth the price!",966038400,11,596,4.258928571428571
1086416,4,6305854416,"I've seen a lot of B-rated movies in my short life.  It seems every new one gets cornier and cornier but I tell the truth when I say this movie was a breath of fresh air.  I liked the blair witch project.  I think it was a  stoke of genius and a benchmark in independent film.  The Bare Wench  Project however takes this one step further by taking the good parts of  Blair Witch and making them better by adding things men (aka: Howard Stern  clones) enjoy.  Adding an All-Star line up made this movie a must see for  guys who like movies, not to mention that God broke the mold when he made  Lorissa McComas.  I tell you fellas, she made me glad I'm a man.  The  perfect combination of beauty, innocence, and curiosity make her an angel.  Just be glad when you purchase this movie that you are witnessing the next  best thing to watching Michael Jordan play live from courtside.  Lorissa is  a little slice of heaven.  The other women are beautiful as well, but  Lorissa is heavenly.  Until next time...",964051200,5,1004,4.3478260869565215
1086417,4,6305854416,"I have to say that the Blair Witch Project is one of my all time favorite movies and when I saw that this was out I thought to myself ""why not get it and check it out"" and I can say that I am glad that I did. If  you like the kind of movie that has nothing but T&A all the way through  it then get this movie, don't get it thinking it is a masterpiece cause it  is not and the only part that I hated was the one girl in it that all she  does is talk and whine about going skinny dipping, not that there is  anything wrong with that but it does get a little annoying. So if you are  looking for a fun movie with good looking women and lots of T&A then  pick this one up, you won't regret it.",962064000,4,690,3.6530612244897958

It stars me (Nikki Fritz.com) Julie Strain,  Lorissa McComas, Julie K Smith, Antonia Dorian and Lenny Juliano - and it  is hilarious!  We're shooting part #2 in a few weeks, so start your  collection with this one!",961891200,16,385,4.507246376811594
1086419,3,6305854416,"This movie-although very amusing, and fun to watch, was a one hour thirty minute video of T&A and a bunch of arguing from some annoying high pitched girls.  I wouldn't reccomend this movie to a few of my friends, yet  then again a few would probaly enjoy it.",960681600,,258,4.354166666666667
1086420,1,6305854416,I thought the Blair Witch Project was a bad movie until I saw this movie. If you like skanky women with incredibly bad fake breasts this movie is for you.,959212800,4,154,4.166666666666667
1086421,4,6305854416,This movie is a good spoof of the BWP. The girlies were nice too. A must see movie.,958435200,2,83,3.6666666666666665

7897441,5,6305854416,Nikki Fritz's is best work and most comical performance yet! I like the other models as well they are a lot of one liners and plenty of skin being flashed to keep things going despite the bad acting!,1378252800,,199,4.2631578947368425
7897442,5,6305854416,"If you love women, and you love camping, this is the movie for you. If you like to laugh, even better. This movie is hot, the women are even hotter!

7897443,5,6305854416,"Instead of writing a page long thesis on this movie's plot or lack thereof, and dissecting the acting techniques of the leads, I am going to get right to the point and tell you what you need to hear: This movie has a cast consisting primarily of hot, well endowed chicks, who frequently bare their breasts, and get naked. There really is no sex to speak of, and the plot is so paper thin as to be invisible. If you're looking for a soft core flick with copious big bare breasts, then this is for you. If you're looking for something with cohesion or plot or great acting, then skip this. Personally, I love it. Couldn't be happier with it, and have also purchased the second one, with plans to buy the third. But it's definitely not for everyone.

Recommended for fans of ""Joe Bob Briggs Drive in Theater"" on Showtime. Everyone else, view at your own risk.",1172448000,2,856,4.417721518987341
7897444,4,6305854416,"This movie is pure greatness. Every girl has massive breasts and they ain't shy about it. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't so stupid. Still you can't deny the allure of naked breasts.
I give it three thumbs up (if you know what I mean)",1064534400,7,245,4.020408163265306
7897445,5,6305854416,"I love horror movies - which is an understatement.  When I first heard about THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, I was excited and curious.  After seeing the film, I found it to be one of the WORST movies I'd ever seen - and to refer to it as a ""horror"" movie is like calling THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE a love story!  THE BARE WENCH PROJECT is truly one of the great satires (compliments to Jim Wynorski - disciple of Andy Sidaris, who has a cameo in the film).  Not only does it have some of the most beautiful breasts in the world, but spoofs wonderfully in true Wynorski/Sidaris fashion.  It's not an offensive sex-ploitation film - it's a great parody with lots of wonderful visuals for those of us who adore the female anatomy.",1021161600,,722,4.398496240601504
7897446,3,6305854416,"Yes, I should have known better.  I stumbled across this film on a movie channel late one night and for some reason thought this might be an interesting parody of ""The Blair Witch Project.""  Four sorority sisters head into the mountains to do a class video project on the legendary Bare Wench and I immediately start rethinking my working hypothesis on what is up with this film.  There is Nikki Fritz as Nikki, Julie K. Smith as Chloe, Lorissa McComas as Lori, and Antonia Dorian as Toni.  Fritz, star of ""A Ferret in My Bathwater"" (how on Earth did I ever miss that one?) is the lead character here, with more brains than the rest of the group put together, a fact which is proven repeatedly.  As their faithful idiot companion is Lenny Juliano as Lunk, who gets ample opportunity to leer at four pairs of bare breasts but not much else.  Julie Strain makes an appearance as the title character who inspires lust in those who climb her mountain at the film's less than thrilling climax.

There are two reasons for seeing this film and neither one of them really pans out.  There are lots of scenes of the girls running around topless and rubbing up against each other, but nothing particularly memorable.  The specific parody elements consist of finding sex toys out in the woods, an obvious twist on the famous camera shot of Heather, and the game of hopscotch.  Most of the film is shot with a hand held camera, in the spirit of the original, which at one point when everyone is running screaming through the woods actually made me physicall ill.  I stuck around for the end to see how lame the final punch line was going to be and discovered that the funniest and best part of the movie are the end credits, which have outtakes of the bonfire scene.  It seems that no power on earth can get Antonia Dorian to say the line ""I used a piece of paper.""  Watch it in total amazement as she gets the line wrong time after time, and if she is even in the ballpark, immediately messes up the next line.  Finally you hear director Jim Wynroski, having given her the line several times, laugh and say, ""I'm just going to put all of this at the end of the film.  It's going to be two-and-a-half hours long.""  Thankfully, this is not the case.

FYI:  Apparently there are sequels to this 1999 film: ""Bare Wench Project 2: Scared Topless"" (which is, I guess, the same as ""Book of Babes: Bare Wench 2) from 2001 and the upcoming ""Bare Wench Project 3: Nymphs of Mystery Mountain.""  Consider this fair warning.",1020384000,11,2500,4.479028697571744
7897447,3,6305854416,"I'm kind of a fan of Lorissa McCommas and Nikki Fritz and I fell in love with this film's naughty lampoon of the Blair Witch Project. Nice little lesbian scenes (made funny by the constant, eager groaning of the only male participant of the group, Lunk, who holds the camera. ""Can I join in?"" / ""No way, this is a girl thing."" Hehe.) Funny out-takes during the end credits. Cameo by B-movie goddess Julie Strain as the Bare Wench.
Just a fun movie, with nudity and light-hearted sexual situations and of course, lots of bouncing around and about as mindless as the movie it spoofs. But at least ""Bare Wench"" is FUN.
I just can't believe Nikki Fritz reviewed her own movie here at Amazon. I'M A FAN! XOXO :-)",1008460800,2,707,4.446153846153846
