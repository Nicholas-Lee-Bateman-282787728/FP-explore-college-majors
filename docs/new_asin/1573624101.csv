193832,4,1573624101,"A very entertaining piece of movie you shouldn't take to serious but enjoy. Julian Sands is playing a male witch that's been sent by the devil himself into the future to combine the single pieces of his unholy book, The Great Grimoire. Followed by a witch hunter named Redfern that seeks to avenge the death of his beloved wife, Richard E. Grant turns out to be a great counterpart for Satan's Son Sands. Lori Singer as the young woman that's supposed to help Redfern though she's first  very sceptic about everything supernatural is just a grey  mouse compared to the smashing acting of Sands & Grant. Another negative point about that movie that has could  done a lot better is the large ammount of grandmommy  superstition that could have been left out if you ask me (though it gives some funny phrases, but it's mostly more anoying than entertaining). But still - this is a movie you should check out if you like to know what the comming of the devil's son could be like  (and DON'T think of Adam Sandler here). The scene where Sands yells at god after knowing his true name has become one of my favourite movie scenes ever. They couldn't chose a better one.
And don't waste too much time with the sequel as it turns out to be a teen horror movie. Great acting from Sands still, but the plot is flat and a whimpy Bud Bundy look-alike is no counterpart for the devil like Redfern/Grant was.
Get the original and unleash the witch !",993254400,,1434,4.478927203065134

193834,4,1573624101,"When a 16th century warlock is saved from being hanged, he is sent to the 20th century to piece together the 3 pieces of a satanic bible that can bring about the end of days. Somehow the very man that caught the Warlock the first time, finds out what has happened, and goes after the Warlock.  Very entertaining to say the least, Julian Sands does a terrific job as the very evil warlock. The reason this movie gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because it relies to much on your basic cat and mouse plot, where they find the bad guy, only to lose him to a twist of fate, this happens a few times and then their is finally a big fight at the end, where of course the good guys win, and thats exactely what you see in this movie. Only the standard stuff, nothing really groundbreaking here.  Some really sick and twisted stuff included here (ex. A child is literally skinned alive so that his skin can be cooked and eatin by the warlock so he can fly,and a man gets his tongue bit off by the warlock) This isn't really what you would call a full blown horror movie, its more like a supernaturel thriller. Like I said before nothing groundbreaking, but defiantely worth the price of rental, or maybe even worth buying.  Rated R for: Violence",989280000,,1233,4.306034482758621

193836,5,1573624101,"A GREAT western! Fonda, Widmark, and Quinn gave superb performances in this one. Fonda as the mercenary lawman has scrupples and is principled, so totally different from the Eastwood types. This is definitely one of the  best of the ""American Made Westerns"" genre. The phasing  complements the story. The finale ""shootout"" between Fonda and  Widmark is classic and will be long remembered. I highly recommend this to  true blue western buffs for this is one of the last ""highs""  before the onslaught of the sphagetti westerns. Ranks up there with  Stagecoach, High Noon, the Searchers, Chisum, Ride the High Country, and  Rio Bravo.",956188800,11,632,5.077669902912621

193842,5,1573624101,"In the late 50s several outstanding westerns came out following ""High Noon"" that offered the same intensity in technicolor or cinemascope, ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,"" ""Last Train from Gun Hill,"" and this feature ""Warlock"" starring Henry Fonda, Anthony Quinn and Richard Widmark; Deforest Kelley (Earp's brother in ""Gunfighrt at OK. Corral"") stokes the fire of the outlaws in this drama. Of the last three films, this is the only philosophical western to date, where all the cowboys seem to be reflective and thoughtful. Its running time was always shortened and narrowed to a pan-and-scan format for television circulation. Until this release I had never seen this film in its entirety. Its relevance in the age of Trump should not be lost on the viewer. For this film is about an impatient town that allowed its consensus to send for a hired gunslinger to handle its lawlessness, to get it back to its former peaceful existence. A very contemporary notion. The hireling is Henry Fonda and his sidekick, Anthony Quinn. The town goes along with the strictures of the new sheriff until they discover the unlawful means that guaranteed constant victories over villains. Observing the confrontation between law-and-order/right or wrong is Richard Widmark, who was a part of a gang at one time and wrestles with his conscience cooly, with growing consciousness. (Uncredited in this film is Frank Gorshin who plays Widmark's brother.) As the movie plays out with resistance growing against the heavy-handed control over events, there is still time for romance with Dorothy Malone actively arguing her stake on events (romance or widowhood). Unlike the standard western there is no comic relief (Gabby Hayes or Andy Devine) to lighten the machismo. Like ""High Noon,"" events force a showdown between the good and bad elements of the arrangement. With the seasoned direction of Edward Dymtryk from a literate script the movie makes more sense than ""High Noon"" here, that was tied to blacklisting of writers and McCarthyism too obviously to be practical. Fonda gets to demonstrate his lethal gun play, teasing you to an exciting finish, when he draws his two gold handled Colts and lets them fly to an unpredictable finish. You see, in this wild west, a townspeople is allowed to learn from their mistakes and find a way to expel a dangerous solution when one individual makes a stand with the town confidently behind him. Whether America will learn from Trump's flaws remains to play out.",1516060800,,2482,5.056097560975609

193862,4,1573624101,"This is a 1959 Western about a town, Warlock, Utah.  There is more than one movie named ""Warlock"".  This movie is a solid, if not great western.  The cast is excellent.  Henry Fonda, Anthony Quinn, and Richard Widmark are all major stars.  DeForest Kelley plays the role of a cowboy before playing ""Bones"" in Star Trek.  Tom Drake, from Meet Me In St. Louis, to me, seems out of place as a brutal cowboy in this movie.  The movie is of high quality but was not a commercial success.

On the negative side, I feel this movie runs somewhat long.  The story could have ended sooner than it did.  There seems to be too many action climaxes.

On the positive side, I like this movie on several levels.  I like the cast.  I enjoy the cinematography.  I suppose most of all, to me, this movie seems to be a series of moral dilemmas and moral ambiguities.  Men are part saint and part sinner, much like life.

193883,5,1573624101,"Fabulous film about a town dealing with evil, recalling High Noon in some respects. Warlock means a male witch and Anthony Quinn scores highly as that ""demon."" Henry Fonda must decide weather to act or not, Dorothy Malone waits on the sidelines as if a kind of westernized tsunami were about to hit

Richard Widmark is always splendid, as are the rest of this excellent cast.

Dmytryk directed a number of films for 20th century Fox,Broken lance, The Blue Angel, The Young Lions, etc. With Warlock, as with The Blue Angel, the studio started to act against Dmytryk for his denunciation of people in the business as reds. Prison frightened him, and to get out he was supposed to inform. He did, and he demanded for the names he gave, a contract with at least two studios where he could direct. Fox as one and Columbia was another.

Brando, who split with Kazan over his informing on people had no ruble actin in Te Young Lions. Bogart did The Left Hand of God with Dymytryk directing. There were shock waves among those indited and those fighting the McCarthy madness. Bogart was in te forefront, and he was terrorized into showing Hollywood at least that he was not a Red and that he supported the HUA to the core. Lauren Bacall went over the Warner Bros to star in a John Wayne film Blood Ally. Wayne was one o the most vociferous of the Red Baiters at that time. It looked good to be in a film with him. Bacall signed on and the film was about Chinese Communists, with all of the cliches that go with Wayne films.

Spencer Tracy did Broken Lance, Montgomery Clift starred in The Young Lions.  Then McCarthy was out, suddenly and liberal Hollywood to revenge. Bacall never made a feature film with her as the star after 1958s Designing Woman. Films with Dymytryk at the helm were avoided and openly criticized in a way not seen Hollywood ever. . Dymytryk's films were dead in the water..Warlock was one of them. I saw that film many times and every time I went to see it the theater  was practically empty.  The Blue Angel with Mai Britt, a Swedish new comer who starred with Brando in The Young Lions, barely made it to the screen,,a big film nonetheless, but everyone who saw Dymytryk's  name on a film, they stayed away.

Warlock was caught in the fallout of the fall of Joe McCarthy.

Dymytryk was shunned until 1963 he directed the very lucrative film, The Carpetbaggers. He went on to direct Bette Davis in Where Love Has Gone..Nothing very good in either of these films, but one can see the sloth, the ennui of the director as ,eg, when Bette Davis and Susan H wanted much of Where Love Has Gone re-shot with a new director.

Sad for Dymytryk, as he did have a flair, and directed with the CinemaScope camera with great elegance. Not a director for the stars of the films he did direct, but definitely not a nobody. But, the message here is, Don't inform on your friends, especially out of fear.

I would look for,as an aside, The Blue Angel, a remake of the Dietrich version of 1930. It is excellent. With Curt Jurgens as the lust-filled professor, and Mai Britt as the blue angel. In color and CinemaScope!.",1476835200,2,3117,4.497345132743363

First time in a long time (other than watching the classics) that a horror movie had not only surprised me, but genuinely terrified me.  First time in a long time I haven't had to fast forward just to find some semblance of a plot.  This story has an abundance of plot, and that is a good thing.  From an initially doubtful hero to a heroine who admits to have finished two grades in high school, the plot really moves, and skids us past a very small underabundance of deep characterization.  Still, the characters hold up, continue to surprise, and as they say, the hits just keep on coming!

The infamous Warlock is sentenced to death via gallows by witch hunter, Giles Redferne for a number of evil atrocities including the bewitching of his bride to be. However, before Redferne can put a victory in the bag over The Warlock, Satan saves The Warlock, transporting him some 300 years into the future in 1988 Los Angeles.

Once in the future, The Warlock is given the task of continuing his dastardly work by retrieving three parts of the Devil's Book that will reveal God's real name. Once he puts all 3 parts of the book together and says God's real name aloud, he will bring about Armageddon and ultimately destroy humanity. However, The Warlock doesn't count on Redferne following into the same time traveling portal.

Now in 1980s L.A, Redferne enlists the aid of a young diner waitress, Kassandra who seems reluctant to help and would much rather be left alone.

193945,5,1573624101,"This film is far better than horror fans today realize and sadly I fear it is overlooked when people delve into 80s and 90s horror to round their horror film educations.  If you're in the market for a good ""witch movie"" or simply a great horror movie choice in general, this is it.

I had long been yearning for a good witch movie after seeing The Witch (2016), which was successful as a movie ""involving"" a witch but didn't at all feel ""about"" the witch.  So it had me yearning for a good movie that ""focused on"" the witch.  And this movie is an excellent choice for that!

After a lengthy atmospheric introduction to 17th century Massachusetts, we meet our Warlock (Julian sands; Tale of a Vampire, Arachnophobia).  For his actions in league with the Devil he is sentenced to death or, put much more specifically by his accusers:  ""You are to be hanged, and then burned over a basket of living cats.""

A hellstorm arrives which by the Devil transports the Warlock through time, three centuries into the future to 1988 so that he may collect and assemble the three parts of the greatest spellbook the Grand Grimoire, the dark Bible.  He is followed through time by the witch hunter Redferne (Richard E. Grant; Bram Stoker's Dracula) to the home of Kassandra (Lori Singer) and her roommate.

Much as with the pansexual nature of vampirism, our Warlock homoerotically kisses and bites the tongue from a gay man and spits it into a frying pan after cutting off his finger and procuring his fanciful ring.  Not only a tongue and a finger, but he goes on to remove the eyes of a spiritualist (Mary Woronov; House of the Devil, Chopping Mall) which look (despite being disembodied) where he must go.  But his spellcraft advances with the story and he eventually casts a spell cursing Kassandra to age 20 years every day--a fate worse than death to a once stunning twenty-something.

Our witch hunter Redferne is similar to a lower budget, smaller muscled, less suave The Last Witch Hunter (2016).  He uses arcane tricks to track the Warlock--like his witch compass using the Warlock's blood, nails in foot prints to cripple him, and recognizing bewitching signs such as cream that sours overnight and bread that doesn't rise to detect his presence.  As Redferne traveled through time to ""the present"" in tow of the Warlock, their dynamic is much as The Terminator's (1984) Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner to the T-800, with an ordinary but brave man aiding a diner waitress trying to prevent the end of humanity from a supernatural opponent against overwhelming odds.

Director Steve Miner (Lake Placid, Halloween H20, House, Friday the 13th Parts 2-3) already had some horror experience, but I think he outdid himself here.  I was pleased with the story from start to finish (a stunning rarity in horror especially back then), the acting was solid (but not wowing), the nuance and discovery of mysticism was developed well, and the special effects were really quite good for their time with the ectoplasmic magical energy not at all looking hokey (although the flying was a bit silly by today's standards) and a nice gory finale!  I was especially pleased with the ending, had a dash of acceptable warm-fuzzy feelings and a bit of clever tongue-in-cheek humor.

This film is far better than horror fans today realize and sadly I fear it is overlooked when people delve into 80s and 90s horror to round their film educations.  Let's correct this.  Buy it, see it, and celebrate the Warlock!",1460851200,,3481,4.7683333333333335

193981,5,1573624101,"The Town of 'Warlock' has been terrorised by the 'San Pablo' gang led by 'Tom McQuown' (Tom Drake) who lets
no-one threaten his rule of the territory.
The elders of the town decide to hire an unofficial 'Marshall' a renowned gunman 'Clay Blaisedell' (Henry Fonda)
to make the streets of 'Warlock' safe and stand up to 'McQuown' - no-one else has dared try.
'Clay' rides into town with his partner and equally renowned gunman 'Tom Morgan' (Anthony Quinn) almost
immediately they lay their brand of law down in 'Warlock'
However, although given the title of 'Marshall' legally they have no real authority to administer the law, once things
have settled down those that had felt disquiet over the appointment of notorious gunman 'Blaisedell' decide they
should seek an officially appointed 'Deputy'
'Johnny Gannon' (Richard Widmark) who had until recently rode with the gang led by 'McQuown' walking away because
he didn't like the way things had been going volunteers to take the 'Deputy Badge' and administer the law despite the
fact his Brother still rides with the gang, he promises to do what is necessary even if it means facing down his younger
Brother and indeed if it puts him at odds with gunman 'Blaisedell'
There is sure to be a showdown.....will the towns people finally face up to what they need to do to create the town they
want ?
The film has a good measure of shoot-out action along with the age-old hint of romance along the way, with some of the
major 'Hollywood' stars on-board as was frequently the norm' back then.
This is an old-style Western as they used to be made back in the 50's and 60's when Westerns had a World-Wide following.
It seemed back then that the made for Cinema and indeed TV were plentiful.
If you're a fan of Western's, this is well worth a viewing.",1447372800,,1790,4.703821656050955

Back in the 80's there was no CGI.  This movies special effects are done very well and make you ask yourself, how did they do that?  It has a solid plot, the hero, the villain, supporting actress, and just a splash of comedy which gives it that rewatchability that you don't see in a lot of movies.  While having a darker tone it delivers good backstory so your up to par with what is happening throughout the movie.  It is a Vidmark low budget film that is done very well.

194039,4,1573624101,"Famed hard boiled mystery writer Raymond Chandler once said that whenever his budding stories stalled, he'd just trot in another character with a gun. Not necessarily firing it; just threatening to. Did wonders for retaining reader interest.

Over in the cinematic wild west world, maybe that's what the director and screenwriter had in mind while constructing this rented gun tale. Dubbed ""the thinking man's western"" after its release, there isn't a minute's worth of actual gunplay in the entire film. There's none at all in two early scenes where you're introduced to the dangerous outlaw gang, whose appearance in a small Utah mining town has prompted the hiring of gunslinger Clay Blaisedell/Henry Fonda and his crew (cunning sidekick Tom Morgan/Anthony Quinn included) as protection. But the threat of violence always hovers, as in the saloon scene when the two sides square off and everybody's gun hand is no more than six inches away from a revolver or shotgun.

An edgy moment if you've never watched it before. And as you get to know and like some of the characters, the tension never lets up for long. Who lives, who leaves? Others have enacted the 'fast gun for hire' theme before and since but rarely with equally remarkable twists. Quinn shines, with Richard Widmark a step behind as reformed bad guy/duty-bound deputy Johnny Gannon. Dorothy Malone is more than serviceable as his romantic interest, ex-saloon girl Lily Dollar. As a final additional plus, the Cinemascope shots of the Grand Canyon and environs will certainly charm the outdoors lovers.",1433376000,,1567,5.093385214007782

194083,4,1573624101,"Taking place in 17th century Boston in the year 1691, the Warlock(Julian Sands) is facing execution for his crimes. Before he can be killed, he's set free and sent through time by a supernatural force which carries him to 1984 in Los Angeles. Once there, he begins on his path to end the world. The man whom captured him named Redferne(Richard E. Grant) follows in hot pursuit. After an encounter with Warlock, a woman named Kassandra(Lori Singer) is forced to join Redferne in putting an end to Warlock's evil ambitions.-summary

Well that was totally unexpected. When I first came into this film I was prepared to see a full fledged supernatural horror film, with demons and the whole nine yards. Sad to say that wasn't what I got at all. Fortunately, I'm able to re-adjust my mindset on the fly, and take the film for what it is because if I happened to be too narrow-minded; then I would despise this film for all the wrong reasons. Directed by Steve Miner, Warlock appears to be more of a fantasy with horror elements that deal with witchcraft, hence the name Warlock. Although the film isn't pure unrestrained horror to me, it's still a very fun and entertaining ride.

The film somewhat begins with a slow start. However, once the plot and side plots are made clear and the characters have been introduced and partially developed. The film finds its footing and delivers well on the old chase formula. Julian Sands plays his role well as the cold blooded chaos bringer, whom will use any means necessary to carry out his goal as well as cause his enemies suffering. The writing was very good when developing him as pure evil without the use of over the top gore scenes. This is a skill certain horror directors lack.

In the violence department, don't take it the wrong way as if the film is on a kiddie level. There are a couple of brutal moments to be found but the gore is minimal. The plot is non stop fun and the writing manages to squeeze in a few comedic spots which really do work, and doesn't seem to clash with the serious nature of the film. The foul language is kept pretty low and nudity is non-existent.

The acting is among the strong points with everyone delivering fine performances. Lori Singer was a standout for sure, but I won't add any spoilers on her end, and I felt Sands and Grant did a great job speaking with 17th century dialect. The special effects really have a dated feel that sometimes comes off laughable, but it's all part of the fun as far as I'm concerned. The climax is worked out very well by tying up loose ends and providing proper closure. The only real issue that I have with the film is that it doesn't completely feel like a horror film to me. It's not the least bit scary at all nor atmospheric either. To include, I never really felt a sense of dread or the possibility of death for the heroes. This is something people whom hate serious gore can easily get into.

Warlock definitely isn't for the blood thirsty crowd. I would like to give specific details on at least one death scene, but I feel it's too big of a spoiler. This is a film that takes you by surprise at times. I recommend this to those whom are searching for a fun story minus the out of control violence.

Pros: Solid acting and fun plot

Cons: Not the least bit scary",1427587200,,3288,4.46089850249584

194140,4,1573624101,"I watched this a very long time ago and just kind of forgot about it. When I saw it on Amazon Instant I decided to give it another go. I am very glad I did.
 While not overtly tongue-in-cheek it still has a humour that shines. It has dated effects, sure, but they actually are pretty good for the time it came out. It's more fun than scary but if you watch it in the right sort of spirit it is very enjoyable.
 One thing that always strikes me is the attention to detail and effort that was put into this movie. Someone really did their homework on witch lore as well as period speech. One of my favorite parts is where Redferne pumps the handle of the sink as if it were a pump. That is a very small, quick detail that passes quickly but one that some directors  would miss. Also, when the Warlock crashes through the window into the present-day home his feet are dirty. Well, he just came from a dirty dungeon so of course they would be dirty. Another small detail that s easily overlooked.
 I don't know the history of the movie but this was not a slap-dash effort. Time and care went into it. The performances are great, too. Serious but with just the right amount of cheekiness to it.  Julian Sands is great. I always love him. He has a great prescence (incidentally, I think he would have made a superb Lucius Malfoy or Elrond). And the other actors really give it their all.

194143,5,1573624101,"This is a much better than usual western because of Henry Fondas excellent cool acting and more so because of the psychological aspects of the film. A town is threatened by gunmen and hires Fonda, a gunman, to stand up to the gang and kill them. Fonda knows from the beginning and says so that the town will like him at first and then hate him and want to get rid of him. Fonda brings his friend Anthony Quinn along. Quinn has a limp. There is a strange strong bond that Quinn feels toward Fonda. He says it is because Fonda is the only man who does not treat him as a cripple. But is there a homosexual element in his feelings? We soon find out that Quinn has been doing things that may seem to support Fonda but may be in in own self-interest.
 There are many gun battles and several attempts to shoot people in the back. The town soon feels, as Fonda predicted, that it needs a legitimate lawman, not a gunfighter. Richard Widmark, a former member of the gang, volunteers for the job. Widmark stand up to the gang despite a wounded right hand, his gun hand. We watch to see if Fonda has to fight Quinn and Widmark and who will win, and how Fonda feels about Quinn.",1417478400,2,1167,4.233183856502242

194150,5,1573624101,"For a 50's Western , this film wasn't too bad . Good cast with Henry Fonda , Anthony Quinn , Richard Widmark, supporting cast : Deforest Kelly , Dorothy Malone, Frank Gorshin . This film is above many run of the mill Westerns that was made in the 50's  Its about a town being victimized by a gang who sets up each Sheriff by calling Him out and having gunners on roofs and behind alleys by the chicken Leader, though each Sheriff is run out of town giving the gang the town to hang at . The Leader , who's brother doesn't like what's going on decides to go against Him . The Town hires a known gunfighter (Fonda ) and his sidekick (Quinn ) to rid the town of the gang . Widmark's characters is  written  weak  , even though He is the key to the plot , He just doesn't  seem to peak in the role even though He is a good Actor , its just isn't written well . Deforest Kelly has a little role , but does  good acting in it , it make You chuckle some to see Star Treks Dr. McCoy as a mean gunslinger  , but He did many Westerns before that TV show so  its good to see Him as well as Frank Gorshin who as TV's Riddler in Batman an a known impersonator also does good in His role . The relationship between Quinn and Fonda is the real  kicker . Though a Gay Person in Westerns are unheard of in any time era , its seems at the end Quinn's  character is very fond of Fonda's enough to die for Him and comes off that way not to say He was  or makes any difference . I liked the film , this is before the Magnificent Seven and Eastwood would change Westerns in the 60's , but Westerns were getting tripped over by its own feet to say with the same plots . This film is very underrated in history and isn't heard of . I bought this along with Last Train to Gun Hill , both with Quinn by accident , both are very good  50 's Westerns . Some People are upset of the film ratio , Im not one , Im happy that its wide screen , the colors are okay even though I watched it on a Bluray player. I gave it 5 stars because of the cast and the production is very good as of the director . Its does lack a outstanding score of music , which would have gave it more of a intense in certain scenes , but I don't see movies because of music , its the acting and how it done and this film does all , only one Character was written poor and I think because of that hurt this film and its not Widmarks fault .A good Western  film to add to Your collection if Your a western Fan .",1411084800,,2451,3.858565737051793

194265,4,1573624101,"The big-screen western was in dire straits in the 1950s as it fought a losing battle against wall-to-wall Western series on TV, yet the decade still managed to see filmmakers rising to the challenge some of the best westerns ever made. 1959's Warlock may just fall short of the top tier, but it's still a remarkably mature and eloquent drama that doesn't always go where you expect it to.

Warlock is a small town that's lost its nerve - they can't hold guns but they sure can hold meetings - thanks to a vicious local rancher and his gang who treat the townsfolk as targets and regularly run off its lawmen. So they decide to sidestep the regular law that's too far away to protect them and hire a `sort of' Marshal who operates just a little to the side of the law in the form of Henry Fonda's calm and collected professional gun, already the subject of dime novels that have helped turn him into a lucrative ""attraction"" in any town as people come in from miles around in the hope they'll see him kill someone. He's not a trigger-happy thug but an intelligent man who knows exactly what to expect, both from the lawbreakers and the townsfolk. He's been through the same situation enough to have his own speech prepared and to sound like he's used it many times before:

""People generally begin to resent me, I don't mind it when it happens. It's part of the job. It will happen. I came here as your salvation at a very high wage. I establish order and ride roughshod over offenders. At first you're pleased because there's a good deal less trouble. Then a very strange thing happens. You begin to feel I'm too powerful. You begin to fear me. Not me, but what I am. When that happens, we shall have had full satisfaction from one another. It'll be time for me to leave.""

But this time he doesn't want to leave. He even falls in love with Dolores Michael and starts to think about settling down, hoping the town has grown up enough not to need him anymore. At first Richard Widmark's gang member whose uncomfortable conscience makes him change sides and become a deputy seems to offer a way out even if the fledgling lawman is clearly outmatched and outgunned, but Fonda's close - very close - friend Anthony Quinn (""He's the only one, man or woman, who looked at me and didn't see a cripple"") can't accept the possibility of his partner losing his power and leaving him. To complicate matters further, old flame Dorothy Malone arrives in town trying to provoke a showdown that will see Fonda killed to get back at Quinn because the best way to hurt him is to destroy the only person he ever cared about. And as if that weren't enough of a problem for Widmark and Fonda, Tom Drake's backshooting, hand-stabbing rancher, worse than he ought to be and getting worse all the time, is determined to play dirty to take back the town...

Civilisation may be stalking Warlock, but there are enough buried secrets and sexual undercurrents in the town for it to be twinned with Peyton Place and for Freud and Jung to open branch offices. Yet it also works handsomely as a traditional adult Western where the lines between good guys and bad guys are both blurred and in constant motion: bad men do good things and good men do stupid ones, and people can change for the better or the worse. The film even shifts main character as it progresses, Fonda's town tamer dominating the first third of the film while top-billed Widmark remains literally on the sidelines, saying or doing little beyond giving that look of discomfort that was the trademark of his heroes as he gradually works his way from social pariah to potential saviour of the town as he slowly but steadily takes centre-stage. The leads are particularly well cast, Fonda and Quinn's Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday-like relationship grabbing most of the best scenes but Widmark making a big impression with the less showy role. And there's a strikingly effective bit of casting against type with Tom Drake, the boy next door from Meet Me in St. Louis, cast as an utterly convincing sadistic and amoral villain who rules by terror. But then it's a pretty impressive cast all round, with the supporting roles filled with familiar faces like DeForrest Kelley, Frank Gorshin (as Widmark's brother), Whit Bissell, Regis Toomey, Wallace Ford, Richard Arlen, L.Q. Jones and Joe Turkel.

Director Edward Dmytryk's work would soon slide into mediocrity in the Sixties, but here, thanks to Robert Alan Arthur's strong script that gives the characters strong dialogue to chew on but not too much of it to give the plot indigestion, he's at the top of his game, managing to be understated without losing sight of the drama and doing a good job with the few action sequences. Best of all it's both an impressive psychological 'thinking man's western' and a solid traditional Western drama, stealing a head start on all those end of an era 60s Westerns about men who have to learn to change or die as the creeping progress of civilisation starts to render them obsolete while still working as a class oater.

Alongside trailers for various other Fox Westerns, the US NTSC DVD also includes the film's original trailer introduced, as was increasingly common at the time, by its star, with Fonda appealing to audiences to see the film on the big screen.",1374796800,4,5287,4.6431623931623935

194267,5,1573624101,"Many people will ignore western movies because they think these kinds of movies have simple plots.  Nevertheless, there are other western story fans who see the deeper aspects of the characters in a western movie.  The theme of this movie has a similar plot which can be seen in other westerns; however, the superb acting is what really can make or break a movie. In this case, it is the great acting of all its stars which makes this a very good western.

This fantastic western stars Henry Fonda, who is such a versatile and skilled actor that he makes you believe the character he is playing, whether a good guy or a bad guy.  In this (Warlock) movie he plays Clay Blaisedell who is a professional gunman that the town of Warlock hires to keep law and order from the thugs who seem to run the town.  Anthony Quinn is also excellent as Tom Morgan, who is the loyal partner of Clay.  Richard Widmark plays the straight pro law and order guy who does not like the town hiring a known gunman to clean up Warlock.

There are many twists and turns in this movie that makes this an interesting study in character development and the ethics of good and evil.  If you have not seen this movie, you many want to check it out.  It has a little bit of everything lovers of adult westerns will enjoy in movie.

In conclusion, if you like westerns you will enjoy viewing Warlock.

A more recent appearance in the movie ""Stargate Ark of Truth"" and his voice over work for Smallville reminded me of first watching this movie.  This movie focuses on his quest for the book of uncreation.  The sexual content is in the sequel.  If you want to see how a male witch from the 17th century can terrorize the modern day people with his powers, watch this movie.

194285,5,1573624101,"Warlock is a forgotten classic and one of the best westerns ever made. It is from a period in Hollywood history  the late 1950s  when the anti-hero makes its first appearance in the western. The American western will have to wait for Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone to give the anti-hero the definitive stamp and iconic status that it now enjoys. It will particularly take a charismatic loner of the Eastwood and Bronson variety to create a mass audience for this different breed of western. But in Henry Fonda in Warlock we see an early blueprint of the man with no name, the bounty hunter in full.

Warlock may be the first movie to give the western the push in this direction and Henry Fonda, in style, bearing, and effortless confidence, is an early glimpse of the stark realist moved by nothing unless there is something in it for him. Fondas Clay Blaisedell is a gun-for-hire, in a town that desperately needs one to resist the whimsical brutality of a team of gunmen who intermittently ride into town to create trouble. Blaisedell has a superhuman aura about him. This is first recognized by his future love interest, Jessie Marlow (Dolores Michaels), who cynically downplays the suggestion that even he, a superman, could not overthrow the notorious gang of thugs who have tormented the town. The major part of the narrative of this film is to prove her wrong. Clay and his friend Morgan (Anthony Quinn) are survivalists. Morgan knows no principle except loyalty to Blaisedell; Blaisedell knows no principle except loyalty to his friends. He looks out for his friend no matter what. The peculiar histories of these two characters, along with the other two major characters Johnny Gannon (Richard Widmark) and Lily Dollar (Dorothy Malone) make for a psychological richness that resists the type of characters one would expect from a western.

Richard Widmarks Johnny Gannon is a profoundly lonely and insecure character. To make a leading man and heroic figure out of this mold is another original feature of this mature western. A testament to both the more subtle characters of Halls novel on which this script is based and Dmytryks inspired selection of Richard Widmark. Gannon has tremendous fortitude. He can stand alone, if he must, against impossible odds. But he is also vulnerable. He is a thinking man and he is profoundly out of place in a world where facility with the gun is the key to survival and respectability. Gannon is a man of principle. But he also cowers, and shakes; he is indecisive. But he grows to a point in the film where he can hold his own against anyone.

Gannon's burgeoning romance with Lily Dollar is a source of considerable support when he needs it most. At a crucial moment late in the narrative when Blaisedell, in mourning, burns down the town saloon, Gannon, as deputy sheriff, is forced to intervene. He reaches out to Lily the day before the showdown. He is uncertain and afraid to take Blaisedell on his own. He is certain that the day before his showdown with the gunman will be his last. But he finds solace and courage in Lily's company. Gannon challenges Blaisedell, even when he is fully aware that this defiance will mean the end of him. As deputy sheriff of the town Gannon has to make Blaisedell pay for what he has done. The dramatic implications of an ordinary man, who chooses to wear the uniform of a deputy sheriff, reluctantly,  is explored with a sensitivity that is rarely found in this genre. Widmark is an underrated actor and for years he was typecast as a heavy. But as Johnny Gannon he proves he can carry a film on his own. An actor who should have gone on to take center stage more often is given, quite rightly, top billing, over Fonda and Quinn. Dorothy Malone is a striking screen presence in her role as the woman who also drives Morgans desires. And Quinn as Morgan, the loyal friend of Blaisedell, masterfully conceives his role as Blaisedell's clubbed foot sidekick. Lily, once his love interest, we learn has repeatedly spurned his attentions. Her history with Morgan is revealed in bits and pieces through the narrative. When Lily spurns him for Gannon we see Morgans motivations change to a grimmer, more ruthless, sort.

Edward Dmytryk, the director, has a spare style. The scenes have a quiet fierceness about them that is a departure from the traditional westerns of the 1950s. This is a relatively austere film, it shirks melodrama, and there is a relentless focus here on moving the plot along, with the weaving out and launching forward of the story in what seems like short narrative bursts. The sharpness of the characters and story has much to do with the superior adaptation of an Oakley Hall novel.

The montage sequence of Blaisedell as the gunman with an extremely fast draw showcases the quiet clean economy of Dmytryk's style. The scene is a face off between Blaisedell and the leader of the team of gunmen who has long terrorized the town.

Blaisedell is first shown in an establishing medium shot in a relaxed, alert, position ready to draw. A reaction shot shows his opponent with his hands slowly getting into position ready to draw. A quick return to the first medium shot catches the fast blur of Blaisedell's draw and the clean, efficient, snap of his gun in position ready to take aim before his opponent has time to react. Dmytryk sticks to one building block for his scenes  the medium shot. This choice reiterates his austere style. He also keeps the music out. The style is intentionally pared down and the only sound we here is the snap of the draw and the spare dialogue. The result is a no-nonsense efficiency of style that does not detract attention from quiet tension of the scene.

Leones famous scenes in the Dollar trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West show a similar obsession with capturing the quiet concentration of gunmen in similar contests of technical facility and speed with the gun. He is obsessed with documenting the details of the quick draw with carefully choreographed montage sequences, with close, even extreme close shots alternating with medium and extreme long shots. His montage sequences are more leisurely in tempo, with a signature brooding  musical soundtrack to build the mood of the scene . Leone is known to have seen countless westerns before he made his masterworks but I wonder if Dmytryks Warlock and Fondas interpretation of Clay Blaisedell had a more sustained influence on him.

Fondas return to the western a few years after that in Leones Once Upon a Time in the West and his intense presence in that later film can be seen right here in the staged gun fight sequences. Fondas full stature as an actor is beginning to take shape in Warlock. Fonda is in his early fifties here (in 1959) but unlike many actors of his age at the time he is only getting better (James Stewart and John Wayne have begun to fade gently). His face is heavily lined and weathered with a new strength. His movements are still agile and he has a lithe grace about him that makes his Marshall with an astonishingly fast draw, entirely believable. Fonda has had his greatest years behind him and his role as the quiet, fearless Blaisedell is consistent with the characters he played until then, from Tom Joad (The Grapes of Wrath) to Wyatt Earp (My Darling Clementine). Fonda's persona on screen has ripened to a form of serenity that reminds me of the early Clint Eastwood in Leone's Italian/Spanish westerns. Eastwood has remarked on many occasions how James Stewart, Henry Fonda, and Spencer Tracy are his big influences. After seeing this Fonda performance I am curious if this particular film and the Blaisedell role had made an impression on Eastwood. Seeing this Fonda performance is like seeing the germ of the great personas that will take center stage in the anti-westerns and urban dramas of the sixties as they were being played out and perfected by McQueen, Bronson, and Eastwood.

The psychological complexity of all the characters in Warlock is compelling. The film has not aged a bit, it even seemed to me ahead of our time. With all our technology, with our sophistication in rendering spectacular images on screen, we forget the simple power of movies of old.

194317,4,1573624101,"Always loved this suprising b movie.  It's just a great story all around, with performances that fit the characters.  Excellent Saturday afternoon fare with a bunch of quotable lines ;-).  What I've never liked - and what seems to be a common review failing - is that a widescreen version never appears to have been released.  VHS, LD and DVD NTSC and PAL... whenever I've searched they all come up full screen.

Last night, out of the blue, I looked again and was tempted to buy the Amazon Instant Video to see if maybe it was widescreen, because there have been times with other movies where for some reason Amazon Instant had them whlle no one else and no other format did.  Before I payed  the 2.99, I did a search to see if anyone was saying  that Amazon Instant had it and saw one tip that the other streaming video service (the one with the big red logo) was showing it widescreen.  I called that up and there it was.  A great, clean, clear, relatively amazing print... not cinemescope but wide.

That service had a small note on the page for Warlock that said that the version would only be available till April 1st, 2012.  Does this mean that there is a new widescreen dvd/bluray coming out?  I don't know.  If you are reading this after 4-1-12 then you maigh be out of luck.

Here's a thing about that streaming widescreen version though... I played it back and forth to compare it to the full screen version that we all know and spotted that we don't really get a huge amount of extra screen content.  It is *almost* like they took the full screen and cropped the tops and bottoms to make a ""widescreen"" version.  Heads and buildings in the original that had lots of sky above them now come up to or are trimmed out of the widescreen version and objects at the side edges are mostly the same (there are a few times when I can look closely and see a tiny bit more on both sides but it's not like the major difference between Lawrence of Arabia's pan & scan vs widescreen.)

I may be wrong but it looks like maybe the reason we all have been getting the fullscreen version for years ... which now does not appear to be a pan and scan but rather a full version... is it possible that the vhs/dvd releases were made off of a ""directors cut"" uncropped print, kinda like seeing a Kubrik movie where he didn't like widescreen so the ""directors cuts"" of his stuff are full screen?  From what I understand, and I may be wrong, most movies were/are filmed in a ratio we would call full screen then trimmed to give the wide view.  If that is the case then we pretty much got the full picture all along, and perhaps MORE of the full picture. I can't remember seeing this in the theater, so I don't know if when it was first released the tops of heads came right to the top edge or if there was more to the tops and bottoms like the vhs/dvd shows.

Minor thing, sorry for being dweeby about it... the beginning of the streaming wide version does not have the Trimark or New World company logos with the sounds coming up underneath them... it starts cold with the cat being pushed in the basket.  Since the dvd version has the Trimark logo obviously cut on the sides, if it were there on the streaming version we'd know pretty clearly if it was a crop of the full screen version.

In any case, the new widescreen definitely comes from a much cleaner print or they did a heck of a job cleaning it up.  I hope it being on the big red streamer means that the widescreen will be coming soon to disc (and now I hope that the bluray has both the new widescreen AND the fullscreen versions both from the clean print)",1332720000,,3606,4.308148148148148

In this fast-paced thriller, the warlock commits some truly evil acts and is played to great effect by the superb Julian Sands.

The DVD itself isn't that great of a transfer and is lacking in features.

194320,4,1573624101,"In the seventeenth century, a warlock (Julian Sands) escapes from its prison tower and time-travels up to 1988 as he tries to find the pieces of a lost Bible that would enable him to find the name of God and uncreate the world. Unfortunately for him, the witchhunter Redferne (Richard E. Grant), who captured him and time-traveled on that time period, and a woman called Kassandra (Lori Singer), whom the warlock put an aging curse on her, are on his trail and will do everything to stop him.

  Now the movie is far from being perfect for there are some one-liners that more or less worked, and some plotholes like how the witchhunter Redferne, when asking the help of a mormon priest, knows anything about mormons when they are not from his time period, but from the 19th century. Not only that, although some special effects were well done, I still felt that some shots were bad and created some illogical situations, like in the cemetary when the warlock casts fireballs in Redferne's mouth for when it happened, I really wondered as to how Redferne could be able to spit them out of his mouth and still be alive for if some wizard tried that trick on me, I know that I would be ""dead"", which is why it is so weird to see Redferne still alive and his mouth still intact.
  Come to think of it, and of plotholes, I still wonder how Redferne manages to time-travel back to his time period at the end of the story when there is no warlock around him that can do so.

  Nevertheless, I think Warlock is a fun movie to watch during the evening or if you want to take a good look at to how they did visual effects before computers became as evolved as they are today and started to over-kill some movies. Not only that, it is just great to see Julian Sands (Room with a View, Gothic, Boxing Helena) and Richard E. Grant (Captain Star, Corpse Bride, Wah Wah diaries) together on the same screen. All those actors, along with Lori Singer (Footloose, Fame, Short Cuts) add a lot of energy and depth to their characters who, in the wrong hands, could have been very ordinary and Hollywood-like in their interpretations. It is also fun to see Julian Sands play such an evil character and Richard E Grant such a macho role, which isn't what he usually does. Finally, although Lori Singer, from what I've read on Richard E Grant's website, wasn't too pleased with her script and her character, I thought that she gave a great job. At least her character wasn't some whiny sex-object bimbo who would become a device for some sex scenes with the main male character. Her Kassandra had at least enough will and intelligence to be an interesting character to watch.

In the end, I would like to say how sad it is that they couldn't state in the movie what is shown on the poster, that the warlock is Satan's son. I find it weird that the studios were able to make a movie about witchcraft, dead children being eaten by warlock so that they could get powers, curses, and possessed people, but couldn't mention the Demon's name. If they had done so, I am sure the story would have been better understood, especially in the beginning as the Warlock is freed from its cell by some mysterious force that is unexplained.",1292889600,3,3201,4.486254295532646

194354,4,1573624101,"I can't hate on WARLOCK; I think it's a cool horror adventure flick. The special effects aren't so special, yeah, but that's one of the few negs I can come up with. The cast is terrific, and the story moves like a mother, one of them frantic cross-country chases with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. Pretty cool shizzy, and here and there WARLOCK finds time to throw in bits of quirky humor.

When the bread don't rise, when the beer goes flat, when the horse sweats in the morning, then you know you got big trouble. In the year 1691, in Boston, Massachusetts, it is the eve of a warlock's - a male witch's - execution, except that the warlock is able to summon the forces of evil and he escapes into the future. Three hundred years into the future, to modern-day Los Angeles. There, he begins gathering the three segments of the Grand Grimoire, the indestructible Bible of black magic, somewhere in which pages is hidden the lost name of God, and whosoever utters this name, back to front, will bring about the unmaking of creation. The only hope lies in Giles Redferne, the intrepid witch hunter who had originally captured the warlock. Redferne himself had been flung into the future, and he doesn't waste time going after the warlock, armed with his superstitious savvy, his bullwhip, his blood-activated witch compass, an iron weather vane, and lots and lots of salt. But try to ignore that shabby fur coat.

There isn't a lot of gore in WARLOCK, but the story is nevertheless fraught with atmosphere and tension. Partly it's because the film's pace is brisk. There isn't a lot of down time in the film. The protagonist is no-nonsense and his 20th century companion is caught up in her own desperate straits, and so both stay on mission. And I guess I'll mention that Lori Singer is in this. She plays Kassandra (""with a K""), a diabetic free spirit who dreads getting old. Kassandra survives the warlock's early attentions, but not before he curses her with accelerated aging. You get the definite sense that Kassandra is more bent on (very reluctantly) going after the warlock more to regain her youth than because the end of the world is nigh. But at least she's refreshingly honest about it. It's also fun watching Grant's driven intensity clash with Singer's more laid back California vibe. One of the film's strengths is the odd couple chemistry between Singer and Richard E. Grant (the witch hunter). I really enjoy their interactions:

- Kassandra, hesitantly, after surviving that first attack: ""That guy was a warlock?""
- The Witch Hunter, almost with relish: ""The rudest that ever troubled daylight.""

There are some nice action sequences, and you feel good with this witch hunter on your side because he seems to really know what he's doing. I particularly liked the sequence at the Mennonite farm, liked the contrast of the picturesque scenery outside with the evil lurking up in the household rafters. I'm not so down with the semi-tacky f/x of the warlock darting around in the air. And there are moments when Lori Singer occasionally forgets when she's in her old lady phase.

WARLOCK's not so secret weapons are Julian Sands and Richard E. Grant. Both go over-the-top and yet their performances are amazing in the way that only Brits can get away with. Well-kempt Julian Sands as the warlock and supposed ""son of Satan"" spews a delectable malevolence, and most of his deeds are performed off-screen or in the viewer's imagination. Except for when he chops off that finger. That was pretty nasty. Sands chews the scenery, tears into his lines, chews the tongue off a guy's mouth...

Even more than Sands' wallowing in gothic-flourished language, I got a kick out Richard E. Grant and his cool Scottish accent. As reflective of his witch hunter's 17th century period, he's got a wonderfully twisty way about his dialogue. Stuff like ""Are you daft? 'Tis mine own casket!"" or ""Never can no witch set foot on consecrated ground."" roll marvelously off his tongue. It's awesome stuff. Not to mention, there's huge entertainment value in watching our time-misplaced witch hunter acclimate to his modern-day surroundings. I couldn't help but grin when our normally undaunted hero develops a case of the bad sweats over the notion of flying in an airplane...",1281139200,2,4284,4.813858695652174

194358,2,1573624101,"I sat down to 'Warlock' with no illusion that it was somehow going to be be the masterpiece of horror that passed me by years ago and I got pretty much what I expected. A standard 80's, somewhat tame, horror flick. It's more a fantasy film than horror, as there is no real horror element to it. The film is akin more to 'Highlander' than it is to 'Mark of the Devil' and even by the over zealous nature of censorship of horror movies in the 80's, it's extremely tepid.

The story, which has been covered on the site before, deals with transportation of a 17th Century Boston warlock (Julian Sands) to ""modern day"" America and the persuit of him by the witch hunter Giles Redferne (Richard E. Grant) and 80's chick Kassandra (Lori Singer) as he attempts to stop the necromancer from discovering the locations of a Grand Grimoire, a satanic tome which will revel the true name of God and enable the warlock to undo all of creation...somehow.

The story is bunkum, of course, but in films of this type that is usually of a secondary or even tertiary concern. So, it suffices, for the purposes to putting the characters in the places they need to be. But that's it. The makeup and effects are generally sub-par, even for the period, the acting from Lori Singer is awful and the general setting of ""modern day"" America has been done a thousand times before and it presents nothing new here.

All that should mean that 'Warlock' is not a good film and it's not. it's not even a horror film...but...it's not a bad film either. It does an admirable job during its opening and manages to retain the viewers interest throughout its running time, which is commendable in itself. Julian Sands lends a certain gravity to his part and is very watchable. He plays his character completely straightfaced and it's all the better for it. Grant, complete with dodgy Scottish accent, seems to think the whole thing is nonsense, but he's enjoying himself and it comes across. Out of the three leads, Singer is the worst by far. In fairness, her character is limited (although the rapid aging is a good angle), but she just isn't that good an actress and comes across as irritating.

Even so, the 90+ minutes of 'Warlock' passes by relatively harmlessly and there are enough good scenes to reward the viewing. Sands and Grant's funny ""period talking"" is entertaining and the film as a whole is not without its charm. Overall, it's worth a watch, but I don't believe I will be seeking out the sequels.",1271030400,3,2478,4.599547511312217

It is certainly a candidate.  Warlock is a supurb mythologizing of Tombstone circa. 1881. The novel, as is usually the case, is about three times as big as the movie, and the encapsulation of that time in US history in the novel is nothing short of a work of genius. Oakley Hall himself said that his history is not a report what happened, but the way it should have happened, or something much more profound to that effect. Changes have been made to make Henry Fonda's character closer, but not that much closer, to the legendary American iconic gunfighter mythos, than to the real Wyatt Earp, who he represents. Other changes to the historical action were created to make the film suitable to 1959 tastes, particularly making Sadie Marcus into a saintly schoolmar'm and making Doc Holliday's attachment to Wyatt Earp less--uh, emotionally correct. When I first saw the film, I recognized that ""Billy"" was mythically Billy Clanton, and said to myself, ""My God!  This is the gunfight at the OK corral. It was years until I even discovered the existence of Oakley Hall's Warlock, but when I did, I found it stunning.  I recommend watching the film and reading the novel highly. Study the historic Earp clan (aka the Fighting Pimps of Tombstone) and see that these men really were, as the song says, ""Brave, Courageous and Bold."" Do not pass this experience up.

194394,5,1573624101,"Julian Sands is the time traveling son of satan looking for a means to bring on the end of humankind and... you know, what have you. A pretty standard idea that combines elements of Terminator with more traditional boogeyman characteristics is given quite a bit of life thanks to a very strong cast (especially Sands as the heavy, but the rest of the cast is worthy of note as well) and a very smart, engrossing script by David Twohy, one of the best filmmakers/writers in the science fiction and horror genres today.

Much like Curt Siodmak did with his trailblazing script for the Wolfman, Twohy puts together a whole mythology from bits of superstition, previous fiction/lore, and A LOT of creativity.

Steve Miner pulled directing duties and, quite honestly, I've always liked his genre efforts (excluding his Day of the Dead)and this is easily his best movie. Unfortunately the special effects are lackluster, this is a low budget movie and some of the more extravagant ideas are not realized very well. I really couldn't care less, but I know that some have a hard time.

The script has lots of shooting and killing, but it seems to be over at least 30 minutes before it actually is, and the many shootouts become repetitious. The female leads bring little to the film; Dorothy Malone pouts and postures, and Dolores Michaels was a fairly colorless ingenue.
Still, the film has its place as a more adult Western than many others, and can be recommended. The quality of the DVD is variable.

Interestingly, somehow it spawned sequels, a Warlock II and a Warlock III
although the 3rd movie is only nominally a sequel, since none of the actors nor the plot bear much resemblance to the first and second films.

Very early my thoughts were: What makes a bad film worse?  NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES! (sure sign of low budget).  Second: Oh, the horror!  The horror of bad CG, that is!  This is not really a ""horror"" film, as it isn't scary and it isn't that gross either.  Other reviewers have amply sketched the plot.  The plot is thin, the special effects are pretty shakey at times, the budget is limited, and some of the acting is lame.  On the other hand I've seen worse movies.  I actually watched the complete thing in one sitting, which is not bad.  What saves this movie?  Well, Sands as the Warlock really throws himself thoroughly into acting this part.  He seems to give his best acting skills to what is, let's be honest, a second-rate film.  He plays a charater that is completely, entirely evil (what more could one expect of one Satan is willing to make his chosen one?)--with no redeeming features.  He does it with a quiet intensity that actually starts to draw one into the story.  Second to him is Richard Grant's performance as his nemesis, the witch (the movie keeps changing the reference-witch, warlock--who cares?  Witch seems to be the generic term and most were female; warlock is specifically a male witch..but I digress)  Grant as the witch hunter does I'd say the second-best performance, with Lori Singer trailing in 3rd place as a modern LA girl caught up by circumstance (and romantic interest to the witch hunter).  The soundtrack is nothing special.  Some decent performances by supporting actors (like a Mennonite farm owner, for example) help a bit.  The visuals do manage to get generally better toward the end of the movie.  If you like a modest attempt at another ""save the world from Satan"" movie, maybe you will like it.

Warlock is a small frontier town that is being terrorized by an outlaw gang, led by Tom Drake.  The desperate townspeople hire a well-known gunslinger (Henry Fonda) to get rid of Drake.

Along with his traveling companion (Anthony Quinn), a crippled gambler, Fonda brings order to the community, but then Widmark, a reformed member of Drake's gang, is hired as the town's legally appointed deputy sheriff.

Now, with two lawmen in Warlock, each with a competing agenda, a tense confrontation is brewing that can only lead to a deadly showdown.

194430,3,1573624101,"This unjustly neglected Western, one of the few directed by Edward Dmytryk, the other being ""Broken Lance"", was too far ahead of its time perhaps because rather than action we get a psychological study of a western town in chaos. In a way, this Western pre-dated ""The Unforgiven"", ""High Plains Drifter"" and ""The Wild Bunch"" into delving into the psychology of the characters and their relationships.  There is the town tamer (Fonda) and his buddy (Quinn) who have what one might call a latent homo-erotic relationship underneath their co-dependancy. And the ex-gang member of group of outlaws (Widmark) who gradually shifts to the right side of the law when Fonda & co. start controlling the town.  And of course there are the women (Dorothy Malone & Dolores Michaels) who indirectly cause a split in Fonda/Quinn relationship. This was pretty heady stuff for 1959 so I doubt if many people were ready for this--a Western film noir!! And of course, the book, itself, by Oakley Hall had to be severely altered for the film version since it ran well over 600 pages long.  Nevertheless if you want to see something other than a standard Western--check this out. Widmark, Fonda & Quinn have never been better!!",1214870400,6,1205,4.897058823529412

As he is the 3rd key factor in this story, this is too great a failure to hook me into caring for him. Not least, for this reason: although all 3 are killers, Widmarks mass-murderous past makes his new-found 'moral code' somewhat shakey. I enjoyed the movie for its ideas and complexity nevertheless, and for 1959 it may well have been worth 5 stars, but today we expect the script to be a bit tighter. I found far too many moments of Huh? What? Where did that come from? ... as the characters changed their behaviour and attitude too suddenly for me ... against the apparent flow of the tale. Perhaps something like a modern miniseries would be needed to give such an interesting story the space and the time to fulfill its rich character study potential.

194434,4,1573624101,"The Edward Dmytryk directed western ""Warlock"" proved to be a worthy flick that borrowed themes from classics of the genre.  As in films like ""The Magnificent Seven"" and ""High Plains Drifter"", among others, a town is targeted for mayhem by a marauding band of desperadoes.  The denizens of the town get fed up and hire a shootist to restore order.

The town in this film is Warlock and the hired gun is legendary lawman Clay Blaisedell played by western veteran Henry Fonda.  Fonda, whose M.O. finds him roving from one town to the next with his gold handled Colt revolvers keeping the peace and then overstaying his welcome.  Backed by his promoter and sidekick, crippled inveterate gambler Tom Morgan played by Anthony Quinn, they have quite a system worked out.

A group known as the San Pablo cowboys led by Abe McQuown played by Tom Drake has remorselessly prayed upon the town.  The group includes Star Trek's own DeForest Kelley and Richard Widmark playing Johnny Gannon. Widmark has misgivings about the behavior of the cowboys and eventually becomes the deputy of the town.  Fonda who has been hired as a marshall threatens to shoot it out with any of the cowboys entering Warlock.

When Widmark's brother Billy gets gunned down by Fonda during, the inevitable showdown between the San Pablo group and Widmark, Fonda and Quinn plays out.  The ethical Widmark wants to handle the whole issue without Fonda's intervention, but will Fonda's ego, egged on by Quinn be able to withstand Widmark's request to stand down.

The highlight of the film is the psychologic interplay between the characters in the film.  Supported by the two female leads Dolores Michaels and the stunning Dorothy Malone playing lady of the night Lily Dollar the passion play among the warring factions inexorably moves forward.",1194652800,,1806,4.943708609271523

This Western not only has all of the elements of a great western but of a wonderful story.  Gun slinging shoot outs, back shooters, bad guy trying to go good and shade of gray good guys who are real bad customers make this a well spun story.  If you have never seen Henry Fonda play a tuff, no nonsense, tortured, dark character you must see this film.  Anthony Quinn is brilliant as ever and to combine him with Fonda was inspired casting.  Richard Widmark, and Dorothy Marlone turn in very tight performances, thou slightly stylized for the time.  And Deforest Kelley as a sort of gun slinging kick about is wonderful to see before the days of his type cast role as ""Bones"" in the first ""Startrek"" series.  I think that this film was never recognized because of the fate of it's producer and director Edward Dmytryk - one of the infamous ""Hollywood Ten.""  The HUAC actually threw Dmytryk in prison for refusing to cooperate, and after several months he decided to name names.  Thus marking him for the rest of his life and probably why this film is so unknown.  You can rent this film I'm sure, but why bother when you will want to buy it to add it to your library.

194438,4,1573624101,"The Colt revolver was a tool and the more you study the men who used it at a high professional level the more it becomes obvious that they were also tools, sometimes unwittingly, sometimes (according to Western films) quite the opposite... Necessary tools, necessary men in a very compressed package of American history... They have their brief moment on the stage and then it's time to take their leave, preferably with their boots on, knowing, or not knowing that they've done the job that history actually required, but that history, in fact, won't thank them for it...

Fonda--a quiet dominant personality in Westerns--puts this over perfectly in Edward Dmytryk's 'Warlock,' unpretentious Western... Here Fonda is a professional hired gun brought in specially, and most temporarily, one always feels, to calm down a town plagued by cowboys, some of them with outlaw affiliations...

Every word he says ('I'm a simple man, handy with Colts'), every calculated ploy, shows that he's marvelously clear-eyed about his situation--that today he's wanted, that tomorrow he won't be--because he's an old professional and it's all happened before...

Spruce as spry as ever, Fonda is Clay Blaidsdell, a legendary gunfighter, the ideal professional gunman with great expectations... He is hired, temporarily, by the citizens of Warlock to clean up their town from the outlaws... The movie focuses on his rise when he succeeds in removing the bad guys in a spectacular confrontation, and his fall when he is forced to face his best friend in a showdown...

Fonda brings with him his hero-worshiping right hand and conscience, the ex-killer Tom Morgan (Quinn), who challenges his one-man rule, one vindictive old girlfriend and one loving new flame... When the pair defeats the San Pedro gang, one of its members, Johnny Gannon (Widmark), stays behind and volunteers to become Blaisdell's deputy...

As an uneasy peace settles onto Warlock, the relationship between Blaisdell and Morgan deteriorates when the marshal finds romance with a local girl, Jessie Marlow (Dolores Michaels). Gannon, meanwhile, becomes involved with Lily Dollar (Dorothy Malone), who at one time had been Morgan's mistress and now hates both Blaisdell and him for killing a man she had hoped to marry...

Blond for the only time in his career, Quinn - curious and different as the complex, clubfooted gambler-gunman whose relationship with Clay, leans rather strongly toward homosexuality - made Dmytryk's multi-plotted film somewhat daring for its time... Its complicated story line, working at various levels, and its shadowy psychological innuendos, turned off critics and audiences alike, and from several corners came concern that Dmytryk had carried the 'new convention' Western too far too fast... Nevertheless ""Warlock"" remains a typical law and order Star Western, well written, pretty exciting, and entirely in the classic mold...",1162944000,3,2907,5.364035087719298
194439,5,1573624101,"Warlock is just a great all-around Western, boasting the talents of a great director (Edward Dmytryk), great cast (Henry Fonda, Richard Widmark, Anthony Quinn, Dorothy Malone), and great writing. It has a lot more emotional content than many Westerns, even though it has plenty of action and tension.

Warlock takes its name from the town where all the action takes place. It's a town where a gang of outlaws has taken over, riding in from a nearby town to run roughshod, if not kill the lawmen who are trying to keep the peace. Desperate to restore law and order, the town leaders bring in Fonda and Quinn, a famous pair of gunmen obviously modelled after Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday. Fonda is the cool, collected lead, and Quinn is the hard-drinking, hot-tempered, club-footed sidekick. Fonda and Quinn's characters make a living out of going into towns like Warlock and cleaning them up. This seems like just another stop in a long line of towns they come in and cleaned up.

But several complications arise. Fonda's character meets beautiful Delores Michaels, a town leader who begins by loathing Fonda, but then her loathing turns into admiration, then love, which Fonda reciprocates. An old flame of Quinn's shows up, one who has a grudge against both Fonda and Quinn because of the death of a boyfriend at Fonda's hands. And Widmark plays a member of the terrorizing gang who decides to reform and tries to convince his younger brother, played by Frank Gorshin, to do the same.

This movie always has a lot going on, but it's not hard to follow, and it is enjoyable to see how the plot develops. Everyone performs well, and the story has both satisfying and tragic turns. Warlock is well worth a Western-lover's time.",1160524800,2,1724,4.778523489932886

""Kiss of Death"" was a commercial and critical success, and started Widmark's seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox...he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Udo...idmark's character in this film was the inspiration for the song, ""The Ballad of Tommy Udo"" by the band Kaleidoscope...Widmark became so popular so fast that it was only two years later that he had his handprints cast in cement at Grauman's Chinese Theater...in the intervening two years, he had appeared in ""Slattery's Hurricane"" (1949), ""Down to the Sea in Ships"" (1949), ""Yellow Sky"" (1948), ""Road House"" (1949) and ""The Street with No Name"" (1948), ""The Last Wagon"" (1956), ""The Alamo"" (1960), ""Two Rode Together"" (1961), ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" (1961), ""How the West Was Won"" (1962), ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964), ""Alvarez Kelly"" (1967), ""The Way West"" (1967)...Widmark starred in his own TV series in ""Madigan"" (1972), based on his hit movie of 1968, but only six episodes were produced before the show was canceled...then in 1988 The American Movie Classics cable TV channel honored Widmark by airing ""The Richard Widmark Film Festival.""

And at last I have got me an excellent copy.  It was an adult Western and it still is.  If everyone thought that Brokeback Mountain was the first gay cowboy movie take a double look at Warlock.  The interaction between Henry Fonda and Anthony Quinn was rather electrifying for its day.  Having said that tho, I found Warlcok to be an excellent drama played out against a huge beautiful canvas that is the West.  With the added touch of violence and romance, Warlock has remained to this day, a well directed, acted and written film about the human conflict that is played out by the characters throuhgout the film.  Although the female leads were there just as an added attraction, Dolores Michaels and Dorothy Malone both handed in adequate roles which added to the tension of the story.

194458,5,1573624101,"Under the actual comments aroused by the recent film of Ang Lee, respect an ambivalent friendship of two cowboys, it would be convenient to make a glimpse around one of the most original and  ambitious Westerns ever made.

No other genre in the cinema has begot and even had such perdurable importance more rigorously codified than this. And  there not too many existential Westerns deepened so prolixity the wide gamut of characters with such ambitious intentions, which delineate with admirable precision some of the most psychological profiles of this narrative genre, that represents like no other else, the particular Mythology of USA.

Its winged originality resides in the detailed exploration of minuscule but remarkable narrative episodes. You should not forget Dmytryk has made a long journey from the Noir genre and bold previous works such as A gentleman 's agreement or Murder my sweet , just to name the most significant ones. Warlock frontier city governed by an inept sheriff and terrorized by Abe McQuown make its citizens decide to hire a shaman gunfighter (Blaisdell), whose bullet proof friendship with Morgan determines one of the dramatic components in the film. Ironically the emblematic of an antihero emerges of the bad guys band (Gannon) crosses the line when disappointed and even tired way of living, assumed the role of attached sheriff; he is considered a traitor by his old colleagues and a newly arrived for the people of the town who (once the irony appears) seems to be interested on Lilly Dollar ( a dissolute woman) who has walked a long affective road with Morgan and Blaisdell, whose happy existence as a happy married was interrupted when Johnson was killed by Blaisell.

There are evident of this weird affection, expressed as an excess of over shelter of Morgan respect Blaisedell since he shots the brother of Johnson who is seeking for revenge for his brother 's death; he is not only his personal and free bodyguard, he maintains the apparently solid personality who can appreciate in the first part of the picture. But when Blaisedell decides to establish a serious compromise and proposes Jessie to marry, Morgan 's attitude denotes a visible jealous behavior and among his terrible disillusion he challenges and loses the game.

There are many interesting secondary arguments beneath this script, that arguably seemed to demystify the pretended Western 's legend and to redefine the schemes under this unusual approach.

The somber and unexpected finale may be considered a true anticlimax and that would complete the whole cycle.",1138665600,2,2577,5.121428571428571

He directed good movies such as CROSSFIRE (1947) or even excellent films like BROKEN LANCE (1954) but doesn't enjoy the status of John Ford, Vincente Minnelli or Howard Hawks. Yet, I must admit that WARLOCK was a revelation to me that incites me now to rediscover his works.

WARLOCK seems to belong to the western genre but if you except the shootings and replace them -in your mind- by simple verbal quarrels, the movie becomes a fascinating psychological drama. And, at the end of the movie, you'll notice that Edward Dmytryk has carefully avoided all the usual Hollywood clichs of the genre and created a masterpiece worthy of staying in your DVD collection.

194486,5,1573624101,"One of the great, forgotten westerns, Edward Dmytryk's WARLOCK is the story of the little southwestern town of Warlock and its ongoing battle with a gang of law breaking desperados.  The gang is led by Abe McQuown (Tom Drake,) a bad hombre who we can safely assume has ruled Warlock for a long, long time.  The first scene in the film shows McQuown and gang `calling out' the town's deputy sheriff.  If the opening scene is a little reminiscent of the closing scenes of `High Noon', the deputy sheriff's inglorious exit is not.  He's humiliated out of town, and McQuown's control of the cowed town is once again secure and unquestioned.

  One emergency town council meeting later the town agrees to spend the exorbitant amount of $400 a month to buy the services of gunslinger Clay Blaisedell (Henry Fonda) and his tag-along friend, gambling operator and dime magazine hero Tom Morgan (Anthony Quinn), the `Black Rattlesnake of St. James.'  Since Warlock is not an incorporated town, Blaisedell becomes town marshal `by acceptance.'  In other words, he's not legally a law officer because the law doesn't recognize his authority.  The town accepts him to keep the peace, which more or less means bringing the McQuown gang to heel.  Blaisedell comes with a notorious reputation of his own, and the town is increasingly uncomfortable using anarchy and murder to destroy anarchy and murder.  Of course, nobody wants to take over as deputy sheriff, either - all that job offers is $40 a month and a spot in the short line for a pine box.  Fortunately, a former McQuown gang member, Johnny Gannon (Richard Widmark), agrees to take the job and help Warlock `grow up.'

  The premise - terrorized community enlists outside aid to restore peace - is a popular one, brilliantly realized earlier by Kurosawa in `The Seven Samurai', which was later remade by Hollywood as `The Magnificent Seven' and `The Magnificent Seven Ride Again,' along with a slew of others.  What sets WARLOCK apart is its focus on characters and shifting relationships.  The relationship between Clay Blaisedell and Tom Morgan has attracted a lot of attention and ink over the years as one that's perhaps more passionate and deeper than it appears on the surface.  Things happen and, as in real life, changing circumstances change people's relations to each other.  Widmark's Johnny Gannon starts out as a member of McQuown's gang and changes to a defender of the community his former gang threatens.  When Gannon becomes deputy sheriff Blaisedell's position as hired defender slowly changes, as does his relationship with his dear friend Tom Morgan.  And so on. Loyalties change, friendships swell and some burst apart while new ones are slowly forged.

 Although I'm a huge fan of his MURDER, MY SWEET, I think WARLOCK has to be considered Edward Dmytryk's masterpiece.  Everything works in this complex and layered story of frontier justice.  It works on the surface as a straight-ahead actioner, and it holds up to the scrutiny of those who like to look under the hood of things.  Highest recommendation for this terrific film.",1120953600,57,3096,4.961165048543689
194487,4,1573624101,"The title of this film, Warlock (1959), conjured (no pun intended) up some interesting visuals featuring Julian Sands working some bad mojo magic, but that's a completely different film...the title of this film relates in that it is also the name of the town where most of the story takes place, and what a doozy of a tale it is...directed by Edward Dmytryk (The Devil Commands, Back to Bataan), whose Hollywood career suffered after a run-in with the HUAC (House Un-American Activities Committee), stars Henry Fonda (My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache), Anthony Quinn (The Guns of Navarone, The Guns of Navarone), and Richard Widmark (Pickup on South Street, The Last Wagon).  Also appearing is Dorothy Malone (The Day Time Ended), Dolores Michaels (Five Gates to Hell), Wallace `Mr. Curmudgeonly' Ford (Harvey, The Man from Laramie), Tom Drake (The Cyclops), Frank `The Riddler' Gorshin, who recently passed away in May 2005, and DeForest `He's dead, Jim' Kelley, better known as Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy from the Star Trek television series and subsequent films...you know, it was an exceptional bit of luck for Kelley that Star Trek came along when it did as his film career seemed on a steady decline, his last role prior to becoming `Bones' McCoy was that in the 1972 giant, mutated, killer rabbit flick Night of the Lepus...

The film begins pretty standard enough for a westerner with a gang of armed men riding into town, hooping and a hollerin' with vengeful intent, and quite soon the town of Warlock is without a deputy, which seems to be not an uncommon thing (check out the names on the wall in the jail).  Fed up with living in terror, the townspeople decide on hiring a marshal/gunslinger named Clay Blaisedell (Fonda) to clean up the place (s'funny that the men in town outnumber the gang five to one, but still are unable to muster the courage to fight for themselves).  His services aren't cheap, and I don't just mean just in the monetary sense.  Along with his pay, he also gains exclusive rights to the gambling franchise within the town and his word is law, basically giving him the right to do pretty much whatever he wants, including killing, if it comes down to that...following Clay is his partner Tom Morgan (Quinn), who seems to handle the business of running the faro parlor while Clay is dealing with the `criminal' element.  Widmark plays Johnny Gannon, once a part of the rebellious cowboys terrorizing the town, but disillusionment settled in after a particularly nasty business we never see, but is related to us later as Johnny unburdens his conscience.  Anyway, after leaving the gang, Johnny becomes a social pariah, accepting the position of deputy (perhaps in a redemptive effort), creating a third faction within Warlock, that of the actual law (the other two being the cowboys outlaws and the hired gun of Clay).  Eventually all sides have their various confrontations and all subplots get resolved, but not in the way some might expect...

Reading about this film from the DVD case one would get the impression this is your standard `townspeople hire an outsider to clean up the town' western story, but it goes a lot further than that.  There's a good deal of time and discussion spent on `law and order', and how a frontier town might go about getting in on it being civilized despite itself (some of the debate focuses on the virtues of hiring of Clay, as the fear is violence begets violence, especially given his reputation).  Thing is, when they hired Clay to be their marshal, they were essentially going outside the law, and possibly setting themselves up in a position of giving a virtual unknown control of the town.  The characters of Clay and Tom know their role, and lay it out for the people of Warlock early, pretty much telling them while they're happy that Clay has arrived, once the trouble has been dealt with they will no longer want his presence, and then he will move on to the next town in need.  As far as the `homoerotic' subtext between the characters of Clay and Tom it was there, but I wouldn't categorize in any physical sense, more like a co-dependant relationship that gets a lot weird as it's brought out into the light (although Tom's platonic love gets a little blurry, especially when the jealousy creeps in).  I thought all the actors did well, and Fonda's always a treat to watch, but there was something lacking in the actually writing.  The script was certainly lively, avoiding the clich and staying within the realm of reality, elevating the film above the hundreds of run-of-the-mill westerns out at the time, but some of the characters seemed a little light, especially those of the women.  As far as Widmark, I really enjoyed him in Pickup on South Street (1953) but his character here did little for me, despite Widmark's efforts...it just felt watery and lacking substance.  And then there's Anthony Quinn's character of Tom.  I thought it a unique, albeit morally ambiguous, character, one slightly miscast with Quinn, but he manages to pull it off despite himself.  One of the more interesting characters to me wasn't even a primary but a supporting character named Curley Burne, played by DeForest `He's dead, Jim' Kelley, who actually had a fairly thriving film career going all the way back into the late 1940's.  His role is small, but he's got some of the better lines, and makes the most of them.  I wouldn't have thought he could pull off a menacing character, but he does, and pretty well.  Overall I thought director Dmytryk did well in this sort of epic that isn't an epic (it certainly had enough characters for the standard epic).  The going may seem slow after the initial sequences, but this is a professional effort as the foundation is laid before us, and the subsequent build-up is palatable.  The story may begin to feel convoluted as more characters are introduced and relationships initially unclear, but the murkiness fades for those with the patience to follow through.

The widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic picture in this DVD looks very decent, but there did seem a point near the beginning where the colors felt overly saturated (it doesn't last long).  The Dolby Digital stereo audio came through very clearly.  As far as special features goes, there's a original theatrical trailer for this film, along with ones for The Bravados (1958), Broken Arrow (1950), Broken Lance (1954), Forty Guns (1957), Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), and Drums Along the Mohawk (1939), and a short, curious Movietone News piece whose only relevance appears to be a two second shot of Fonda at some Hollywood function.

194488,5,1573624101,"Warlock is one of those movies that got lost in the shuffle in the years following its release. Subsequent classics like The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Magnificent Seven, The Man With No Name trilogy, The Wild Bunch, etc, all diverted attention away from this 1959 Western masterpiece. Expertly directed by Edward Dmytryk and starring Richard Widmark, Henry Fonda (in one of his best Western roles), Anthony Quinn (in arguably HIS best Western role), DeForest Kelley, and Dorothy Malone, this is a movie that - upon further review - truly does hold up very well against even the best Westerns of all time.

Fonda plays a Marshall (gun) for hire who is brought in to ""clean up"" the town of Warlock. He does so with the proviso that he can do it his way, with no interference from the town council. They agree, but he warns them that at first they will love him and what he does, but later on they will come to hate him and his methods. His prediction comes true, but the way the story plays out belies the usual Western cliche's. The script is expertly written with characters that ring true in a rather sophisticated storyline.

Warlock, in a way, combines the classic Western styles of the 40's & 50's, with what would be seen in the 60's, and even foreshadows some elements that would be seen later in modern (1980's to present) Westerns. It is a great character study, and has (rightly) been called the quintessential ""Psychological Western.""  While Warlock isn't a ""shoot 'em up"" Western, the action sequences are very good and the movie is riveting throughout.

The DVD transfer lives up to the high standards of the movie itself.  The picture is sharp and the print is clean (for a movie of this age), and the colors are vibrant. This is a movie that belongs in the collection of every Western fan.",1111190400,50,1811,4.629283489096573

194510,5,1573624101,"First, this is a really fun movie.  It's not too horribly gross, (except maybe for the scene with the tongue), and it's not very creepy, or too scary,  It's also not at all a comedy, though it is a bit tongue-in-cheek (in more ways than one).  It's just, well...  Fun!
If you've ever read any books about witchcraft, or seen old woodcuts of people's visions of witchcraft during the 16th century, you'll recognize the themes and images in this film.  You'll get the witch hunter holding onto the flying warlock with a rope, nails being driven into footprints, the whole bit...  And you really should look up the traditional main ingredient of the infamous flying ointment before watching.
This film works from the premise that everything in the old witchcraft books is literally true, and it plays out in a very entertaining, visually distinctive way.  It was well-researched enough to really make the premise work, without being so slavish as to detract from the plot.  The warlock is every bit as evil as the old books would have it, and is most definitely in league with The Devil Himself.
And I've got to say it:  Julian Sands is just plain COOL.",1076198400,36,1150,4.681592039800995
194511,4,1573624101,"The 1959 film ""Warlock"" is one of those great surprises for movie fans. It's a classic western, undiscovered, awaiting the lucky viewer who happens to stumble across it. After viewing this dark, almost gothic oater, most viewers will ask themselves, ""Why haven't I heard of this film?!""
I'm not sure as to why ""Warlock"" has been relatively ignored over the years, though I think the film is derivative of other films. I think the generic Hollywood backlots where ""Warlock"" was undoubtedly filmed certainly detract from its overall allure. But simply put, ""Warlock"" fell through the cracks, and it's a film deserving of reexamination.
Part ""High Noon,"" part ""Shane,"" part ""The Searchers,"" ""Warlock"" tells the tale of a town victimized by crime. They hire a gunfighter in the form of Henry Fonda, who arrives with a crippled sidekick (Anthony Quinn) in tow. Fonda's character becomes a semi-celebrity, granted carte blanche as he calmly strolls the streets adorned in shining pistols and dark suits. The cantankerous Quinn, lugging around a shotgun, watches Fonda's back while sipping champagne and taking care of the finances.
But the town (named Warlock) is anything but a simple job. A former love of Quinn's (Dorothy Malone) is a resident, and he wants her back. Richard Widmark also resides here, and he's none too happy about the hiring of the gunfighters, sensing the community should stand up for itself. A young woman (Dolores Michaels) also catches Fonda's eye, and for the first time he begins to wonder about settling down. All of these emotional dramas play out, having tragic circumstances.
Director Edward Dmytryk, one of the more underrated filmmakers from this period, has done an excellent job in weaving these multiple storylines together. He also displays an excellent visual flair, most notably during a gunfight between Fonda and Frank Gorshin about midway through the film. I could argue that the scene is one of the great cinematic gunfights in history. Superbly choregraphed, Fonda screams the name ""Billy, Billy......!"" before drawing his gun and reluctantly killing the man. It is a brilliant, unforgettable moment, precursing many of the operatic gunfights from Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns 10 years later.
Quinn also gives a memorable supporting performance as Fonda's sidekick. Tortured by his club foot handicap and angry at the world, Quinn is a live keg waiting to explode. He does the dirty work for Fonda, and exposes the hypocrisy of Fonda's dream to settle down and retire from a life of gunfighting. Quinn knows he and Fonda can never be a part of modern civilization. Essentially, they are walking death, perfectly symbolized by Fonda's dark suits - a black spot in the dusty streets, stark and apart.
As Fonda stands amid the ruins of a burned out saloon, he is alone, tall, lanky, a scythe-carrying spector. His past choices have fatefully isolated him from civilization. Like John Wayne's Ethan Edwards at the end of ""The Searchers,"" he can never comfortably walk through the door of domestic civilization. He is destined a life of solitude, forced by fate to step aside and allow the modern world to take root. His job, for all intents and purposes, is finally done.
""Warlock"" is a great, undiscovered western. It has brilliant performances, terrific dialogue and unforgettable imagery. It is an unheralded masterpiece.",1075334400,147,3365,5.142335766423358
194512,4,1573624101,"Warlock is a town in the West ,one that is experiencing an epidemic of lawlessness,deliberately fostered by a local rancher ,Alec McQuon (Tom Drake ).He allows his ranch hands free rein ,as a way of demonstrating his power and deterring challenges from others contemplating moving into the area.(The use of terror as a political tool helps give the movie a distinctly contemporary relevance ).One of his men Gannon (Richard Widmark )is conscience stricken and withdraws from the gang .
The town leaders -having seen the latest in a succession of Marshal's driven away -turn to a hired towm tamer ,the legendary Clay Blaisdell (Henry Fonda )to enforce the law and he is accompanied by Tom Morgan (Anthony Quinn ) a  club footed saloon keeper and noted gunman in his own right .The relationship evokes comparison with that of Earp and Hollday ,and it is worth noting that Fonda had played a similar role in ""My Darling Clementine"" of which this movie is darker more tragic version
The townspeople have taken the step reluctantly and in a key scene ,Blaisdell -who is aware that he is in some respects an anachronism ,sets out the situation bluntly and with eloquence
""I come here as your salvation ,at a very high wage. I establish law and order,ride roughshod over offenders. At first ,you're pleased because there's a good deal less trouble. Then a strange thing happens -you begin to feel I'm too powerful and you begin to fear me. Not me but what I am. When that happens we shall have had full satisfaction from each other.""
The prediction is spot on .The very success of Blaisdell in  sending McQuon packing the first time prompts the threat of  massive reprisals and the town backs away from supporting him.
Gannon meanwhile has become the new deputy Marshall and seeks to impose the ruile of law in defiance of both Blaisdell -whom he likes and respects -and McQuon.
Both Blaisdell and Gannon have significant relationships with women -Blaisdell with a leading figure in the town  Jessie Marlowe (Dolores Michaels)and Gannon with Lily Dollar (Dorothy Malone )who hates Blaisdell who she feel nedlessly killed her fiance at the instigation of Morgan.
The various conflicts all move towards a resolution by violence-that between the McQuon gang and the law ,the conflict within Gannon whose younger brother is part of the McQuon outfit ,and most compellingly that within Morgan whose friendship with Blaisdell ,it is hinted rather than stated, may contain a semi -erotic element.
There is more than a hint of Greek tragedy about the movie -the atmosphere is brooding and tragic and the movie is more town focused than is usual within the genre ,making sparse use only of its Utah locations .It is an internal Western rather than one of the wide open spaces.
The climax will evoke memories of High Noon -the discarding of legend and with it a sense of personal identity and the riding away into an uncertain future is moving and apt.
Brillaint performance all round especially by Quinn as the tragic Morgan -a man destroyed by the power of his friendship. Fonda back in the genre after a long absence is brilliant and minor roles are well cast .Action scemes are well staged and for their day quite violent.
The neglect this fine movie has fallen into is unmerited--please give it a go even if the genre is not your normal thing.",1063324800,20,3331,4.818181818181818

I myself own a copy of the Grand Grimoire (it isn't that hard to find it as in the movie!) and The Key of Solomon. Too bad they use the name Book of Shadows (which is widely used today as a general term for a witch's personal spellbook), but in general people don't know such things.

I have found two exceptions to this, one being Stigmata, and the other Steve Miner's Warlock.
Warlock is not terribly original, nor is it incredibly well written, but its sure a fun ride. My biggest problem with the film is Julian Sands playing the title character. We are supposed to believe this skinny, geeky-looking, long haired blond is scary. HA! That's funny. But if you can get passed that the story is pretty cool. Satan's son is sent into the future to gather pages from the satanic bible (which if put together can undo creaton). Along with him comes a 16th century demon-hunter, played excellently by Richard E. Grant. Sands takes residence with Lori Singer and her gay roommate, who is soon killed by the warlock in a most spectacular manner.

194516,5,1573624101,"This is a timeless and universal tale of the power of true friendship. Anthony Quinn was not just proctecting his livelihood when he became sniper to take out the stagecoach passenger and made it look like a robbery soon after they moved to Warlock. He knew that would have presented problems for Henry Fonda.(I have not seen the movie in more than 15 years to remember the details but that still impresses me)He was willing to take care of that without bothering ""Clay"".
Clay fell in love and was ready to give up the 'life'and settle down in Warlock. This jolted Quinn's psyche because he truely loved Clay who was the only one that showed him respect and accepted him as a person rather than as a ""cripple"" . Clay loved what he was..a gunfighter for hire and Quinn was even happier as his very capable supporter. Together they ruled their own lives going wherever they wanted wherever they pleased. Life was good for them regardless. Now Clay wanted to give all that up in the name of love. Unfortunately it came out into the street when Clay told him it was over and he should leave, he didn't need him in his life anymore. It humiliated him, but even so he was willing to let it go and let his friend be until he saw Dorothy Malone in the jeering crowd that was taunting him mercilessly. That was too much for him..the two great loves of his life turning on him like that. Like any red-blooded male in any universe, the testosterone jolt engulfed him "" I'm faster than you Clay""....he turned and faced his friend as the jeers turned to cold silence. The dearest of friends were suddenly  mortal enemies staring each other down.""I was always faster'n you Clay""... there was no turning back, challenge made and accepted...they had to duel.
Quinn was much faster but deliberately aimed wide of Clay whose killer instincts remained true to nature as he drilled Quinn's chest with deadly accuracy.
""I won Clay..I won""....Quinn was smiling as he felt the bullet tear through his heart, taking his last breath.
Clay stood in shock, paralysed by what he had just done. When he was able to move he ran to his friend's crumpled body and took his head in his chest as a mother would her child...the tears shot from his eyes. He commanded the crowd to sing hymns in tribute to his dead friend. His life changed forever.

7798494,5,1573624101,"One of my all time favorite westerns. I saw this movie for the first time when Warlock was in the second run theaters. I was eight or nine at the time, and perhaps my mother had a crush on Henry Fonda or Richard Widmark. I digress. In its own way, this movie is on a par with Shane, The Searchers, or One Eyed Jacks. Slow moving at times for all the right reasons, the classic Western with the Marshall petitioned to the town of Warlock to bring peace through either lethal or non leathal means, hopefully the latter, but more likely the former. Henry Fonda does a very believable job as the stoic Marshall who has moved from town to town, relying on his colts, and the backing of the physically lame Anthony Quinn.

Richard Widmark plays the roll of the marginally bad guy gone good, becomes the town deputy  who then attempts to stave off the inevitable showdown between Clay Blaisedell (Fonda) and the rancher and his men who run roughshod over the town of Warlock. Some twists and turns to the plot help create very good character development. The Anthony Quinn character, Tom Morgan, painfully loyal to Blaisedell ultimately out thinks himself, which leads to the climatic showdown. No spoiler alert, you have to watch it to see what happens.

As per the movies listed above, Warlock is, if not my favorite, close to my favorite Western of all time. A stellar cast and a  great plot with subtle twists, breaths life into the tale of the good guys vs the bad, and the thin line of a towns morality of bringing in evil to fight evil.",1523318400,,1536,4.494623655913978
