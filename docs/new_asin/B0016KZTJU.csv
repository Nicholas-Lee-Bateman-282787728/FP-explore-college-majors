8262998,5,B0016KZTJU,the best fishing videos I see and I recommend for all mi fishing team club,1442361600,,74,4.0
8262999,5,B0016KZTJU,"I have all the TBD films now and this one is by far my favorite. It is a great travel story, fish story, people story. Beautifully filmed, with an excellent soundtrack. I would give it twenty stars if I could.

Jeremy Wade, from ""River Monsters"" recently had an episode where he fished for Taimen and came up empty almost to the end. He should have booked a trip with these guys--he would have caught way more Taimen. And probably would have had more fun.

I hope they do more of these films because they are a lot of fun and take us to places that most of us will never be able to go.

Amazon is sold out at the moment--but buy it from another vendor here because you will totally love this!!",1337126400,,693,4.195488721804511

I was watching it on a transcontinental flight completely lost in the story when I realized that the two guys in the row behind me were watching along with me! I have fly fished all over Montana, Idaho, California and Alaska. Now, I am going to Mongolia!",1235606400,,295,4.584905660377358

It is amazing, I really want to go to Mongolia now!!",1222905600,,244,4.444444444444445
8263002,5,B0016KZTJU,"This is certanly the master piece of AEG Media (so far)...
It dosen't have the ""Video clip"" feel like the first one, but it has for sure the best story line, and the most amazing travel footage that I ever see in a Fly fishing movie !

Yes it stills quite a ""fish porn"" but a really cool one !

Enjoy it !",1211846400,,305,3.8253968253968256
