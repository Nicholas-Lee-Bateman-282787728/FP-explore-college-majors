920333,4,6304745346,"I saw this movie a while back...I really liked it. The fight scenes were awsome, When I first this guy 3 years ago. I was saying...It would be awsome if he stared in an American movie.",976752000,,184,4.138888888888889
920334,4,6304745346,"OK, up front you know from the other reviews that this is a Chinese version of ""Die Hard"" in parts.  As a matter of fact, a few of  the scenes are almost reproductions of the original (the chief bad guy's  strategy of telling the cops to release some serial killer he's never met  just to throw them off the scent; Jet kills the brother of the long-haired  bad dude, so the bad dude goes hunting for him...glass shot  everywhere...Jet goes out the window as a huge explosion is behind him -  sound familiar?).  But beyond that, it's a great movie nonetheless.  Jet  doesn't do as much fighting in this one as in others, but his moves are  impressive anyway.  Cheung's moves are great too - when he finally decides  to start using them.  Some of the stuff is way over the top, but all in all  it's a great movie and a couple of hours well-spent.",965347200,,844,4.32051282051282
920335,5,6304745346,"For those who are fans of Hong Kong cinema, they'll definitely know that despite the fact Jackie Chan films are reasonably more comical than Jet Li's works, Li's films have a tendency to be a bit more exaggerated in  terms of the action sequences.  With High Risk, you have those same fun  action sequences you get from Jet Li, along with a hilarious sidekick in  Jacky Cheung (who very much resembles Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan).  All this  results in an action/comedy that's incredibly entertaining.
The plot is a  parody of Die Hard, Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, and Hong Kong films in general.  After a fairly tense and serious beginning, the film changes it tone a bit  more lighthearted despite some bloody violence.  Jet Li plays Li Kit, a  bomb expert whose wife and child are killed by a terrorist known only as  Doctor.  Years later, a disheartened Kit has become a stunt double and  bodyguard for a famous action star named Frankie (Jackie Cheung).  The only  thing is, nobody knows Frankie uses a stunt double or the fact that he's an  absolute coward.  Sure, he knows martial arts but he's a complete  scaredy-cat.  Frankie attends a banquet with his father (played by another  actor who is also hilarious) that will display a valuable jewel.  Unfortunately, the place is taken under siege by the terrorist called  Doctor.  Kit learns of the Doctor's plans and attempts put a stop to it.  Add that along with a man known only as Bond, whose goal in life is to  fight the action star Frankie one-on-one and you've got an action film that  truly doesn't hold anything back.
While the action sequences in High Risk  are masterfully choreographed, creative, and well done, some might be a bit  disheartened that there are more shootouts than martial action (typical of  Jet Li films set in modern day), though there is still plenty of the latter  to satisfy.
But what's best about the movie has got to be the comedy.  This is flat-out a film full of laughs so big your ribs start to hurt.  Hong Kong has yet to make a movie this funny and that's saying a lot.
The  performances in this film are decent.  Jet Li plays the restrained and  heroic lead, and he plays his part well.  Jacky Cheung is the real scene  stealer, though.  Man, is the actor funny.  I'm starting to wonder why  these two haven't been teamed up again.  There are plenty of more fun  performances.  The actor who play's Cheung's father also shares the scene  stealing with Cheung and the Bond character is another humorous addition to  a cast full of funny men.
If you're just an overall fan of Hong Kong  films, then do yourself a favor and look for High Risk.  It's been a while  since I've seen a movie this fun and entertaining.  It ranks with Fist of  Legend and Bodyguard From Beijing as one of Li's best.",961632000,2,2784,4.556910569105691
920336,4,6304745346,"Yup, no doubt about it, Jackie Cheung is the real star here.  Of course, Jet Li is supposed to be super hero number 1, but then again, he doesn't have a dead guy tearing his pants off either.  There were only a couple of  problems with the DVD, white subtitles!  Come on guys!  Put some effort  into it.  When I buy a DVD, I want quality that's better than the grainy  Jet Li bootlegs I've been buying and I want to be able to read the  subtitles atleast.  And for crying out loud!

920338,3,6304745346,"High Risk is an action packed movie. Not like anything Hollywood has to offer. This is real HK action. Jet Li plays the role of a Stunt-double/ Bodyguard to Jacky Cheung. The first part of the movie really sets the pace  of the rest of the film with explosive action. There are some great fight  clips and lots of comedy. This is not a Hollywood movie so the effects are  not perfect. One of the coolest clips was of the car in the elevator.
The  DVD had no options other than the choice of Cantonese or Mandarin it did  not even have a menu. Further more the subtitles where small and hard to  read and where fixed English and Chinese, so you could not turn them off if  you wanted. Other than that the picture quality was Great.
(I took of 2  stars for the lack of options and the hard to read subtitles)",946166400,6,806,4.188311688311688
920339,5,6304745346,"I just finished watching this movie and I have to say it was money well spent.
The best description of High Risk would be a homage to Die Hard and a parody of Jackie Chan.  Jet Li plays a former bomb squad commander  who's last run in with the villain cost him his family.  He has since has  become the double and bodyguard of Frankie, a Kung Fu superstar.  Frankie  is a cowardly, boozing, womanizer who has forgotten how he achieved his  stardom.
Various elements play like Die Hard scenes including the  characters and dialog.  Mixed in with this are other subplots and some  original scenes (at least to me).  I won't spoil them by elaborating.  Suffice to say, High Risk is an excellent blend of comedy, action (both  martial arts and gunplay) and suspense with some  romance thrown in.  This  movie does not take itself too seriously.  Sometimes it  parodies the  martial arts genre with its voices, dialog and facial expressions!
On the  down side, the subtitles leave something to be desired, blending into the  background and being poorly translated on occasion.  The disc has no  features, just different subtitles.  The video quality is average, audio  Dolby Digital 2.0/Pro-Logic.
Any fan of Jet Li, Hong Kong films or action  in general will enjoy this a lot.  There is little if any wire Fu.",918864000,6,1305,4.709821428571429

920461,3,6304745346,"How great of a film is DIE HARD? DIE HARD left such an indelible mark in cinema that movie producers all over the world have been rehashing its film premise ever since. MELTDOWN (aka SHU DAN LONG WEI, aka HIGH RISK), released in 1995, is only one film of many which blatantly [...] Bruce Willis's action opus. On its own merit, MELTDOWN isn't bad but isn't near the top of Jet Li's best flicks in terms of acting, storyline, or kung fu throwdowns. What it's got going for it is its infusion of mayhem and graphic violence, so if you're into that (and what dude isn't?), then it's good times for the viewer.

The far-fetched plot: A deadly early encounter with a terrorist mastermind simply known as the Doctor leaves military Lieutenant Kit Li (Jet Li) a widowed man feeling guilt and in search of revenge. Two years later, Li is now toiling away as a bodyguard to crass, world-renowned kung fu movie star Frankie Lone (Jackie Cheung), who much like Jackie Chan, insists on performing his own stunts. But, unbeknownst to the public, Li actually also serves as Frankie's stunt double on occasions when Frankie has had his drink on. Frankie used to be a heralded martial artist but has ""forgotten"" the wushu way and is now basically a craven womanizer.

When the posh Grandeur Hotel hosts an invaluable set of Russian jewels, it becomes the point of convergence for Kit, Frankie, and the Doctor and his gang of terrorists. Kit, at last, has a chance to atone for his blunder two years ago. Can he find a way to overcome the mastermind's cunning and ruthlessness? And can Frankie find his long-missing kung fu? Will the plucky girl reporter find love with Kit? Will the dubious film director be defenestrated? Can Jackie Chan forgive MELTDOWN for making a caricature of his persona?

I don't recall the ratio but it seems to me that Jet Li wields a gun here more than he resorts to chop socky. The action sequences are still dang tootin' nifty, but I guess the producers really were going for that DIE HARD sensibility, ergo more firearms. Jet Li remains a very likable persona and his performance is pretty good here as he plays up the stoic, heroic role. As for Jackie Cheung - you either like his performance or you want to slap him silly. I got very annoyed with his incessant mugging and I personally didn't think he was funny, but I know friends who did. His character was meant to be a spoof of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee, but I didn't much care for it.

Too, the editing staff should've been canned for the inconsistencies left in. There's a scene in which Frankie uses a shoe as a decoy, but the very next moment reveals Frankie shod on both feet. How Kit and the cop got the car out of the elevator to pull out a surprise on the terrorists is a mystery to me. There are several ""people"" falling out of the skyscraper who are too obviously fake dummies. See what I mean?

Now, I saw MELTDOWN on dvd, dubbed in typically over-the-top English. I just wished I'd screened it in the original Chinese or Cantonese. As I've said elsewhere, more often than not, foreign movies lose something in translation. There's a chance Cheung wouldn't be as grating if he was presented in his native lingo. But, overall, despite its annoyances, MELTDOWN is worth watching for its crazy stunts and fierce violence. And for Jet Li, of course.",1170547200,7,3327,4.566164154103853
920462,4,6304745346,"This movie is all about entertaining. The combination between ""Die Hard"" and typical martial arts flick works in many levels, but the production values are Hong Kong`s, don`t miss that point. Fans of Jet Li are welcome, but action fans be careful. Here we can find scale helicopters burst in flames, exploding building models, chopped off dummies, you name it. The characters are extreme in their own context: Jet Li is a former military now becomed bodygard and stunt actor, loyal, gentleman, honorable, deadly, you know, a portrait of the typical good guy. The bad guys are also extremely violent and cool looking. He doesn't fight or kick much in this film, but he shoots a lot, dodging bullets from a dozen bad guys with machine guns with no scratch at all, his revolver shoots 30 bullets without reloading, he drives a car inside a hall and uses the elevator, that happens to be be the right size...

Well, you have to be in the right mood to watch this film without laughing at the many cartoonish production mistakes. But if you are into Hong Kong low production values action films, you will really enjoy one of the best ones of the 90`s.

By the way, this DVD edition sucks. English dubbed, subtitles, poor sound and no extras, not even a filmography.",1163980800,,1260,4.671171171171171
920463,3,6304745346,"Meltdown has a lot of great things going for it and a lot of stupid things.  This is an action packed movie that has some great fights and some other great action scenes.  There are a lot of cool characcters in the film, but unfortunately there are plenty of stupid ones as well.  The story is ok but the dubbing ruins everything, unless you get your hands on the original Chinese version.  The guy that dubs Jet Li's voice sounds...like...he...is.....acting like...William....Shatner acts on the.....original.......Star.....Trek series.

Kit (played by Jet Li) is Frankie Lone's bodyguard, a famous stuntman who has become a disspointment and a drunk coward to those closest to him.  He is a big fraud, and Kit has been accustomed to covering for his stunts while not taking the credit.  Frankie and Kit become part of a major hostage crisis in a fine HK hotel during a jewelry exhibit.  Kit encounters the same men again, two years after they killed his wife and a bus full of school kids.

There are two villains in the movie that are pretty awesome.  The first, whose name I can't remember, fights Jet Li about 3/4 through the movie.  It is my favorite fight scene of the movie and one of my favorite Jet Li fight scenes in any movie.  The fight is intense and quick, beginning with gun shots, then some good ol fancy martial arts, finally ending with an interesting swordsfight, where Kit improvises by using a lighting rod from the ceiling.  The other villain is Kong, played by Billy Chau (also appeared as Jet Li's nemesis in Fist of Legend).  Unfortunately, Kong only has a very quick fight against Kit early in the movie, but he provides the final fight of the movie against Frankie, lasting a good 5 minutes and again combining martial arts with weapons.  Its a good fight, but the previous fight mentioned was much better.

Aside from these great fights, there is a lot of action consisting of lots of gunfire, driving a minivan through the hotel, and even bringing a helicopter into one of the upper stories, creating quite a disaster.

Its the dubbing and the rest of the characters that becomes complete annoyance throughout the film.  There is also dumb humor that fails to be funny, and ends up being really cheesy and unsuccessful at creating comedy.

The Chinese language version should provide a better experience for this movie, unfortunately subtitles distract me too.  However, if action is all you are after grab Meltdown and it will give you want you want.",1163808000,2,2481,4.752336448598131
920464,4,6304745346,"Don't take this movie for more than what it is, a comedy. It was funny, Jet Li fans won't find what they're looking for, if they want typical Jet Li. It's some pretty good fighting scenes at the end, especially when Frankie, turns from a coward to a fighting machine.

920465,5,6304745346,"This is a new style of film for Jet Li. True there is some of the greatest action sceens ever shot in this film but mosst of the film is based on making fun of the Hong Kong film bissness. While Jet's charater Kit Li does have some great fights in the movie the best fight is the fight near the end of the movie involving Frankie Loan(I think that's how you spell it who's played be Jackie Cheung), who hires Kit as a bodyguard, and Kong (I don't know who plays him). Frankie is a parody of Bruce Lee(The greatest martial artist ever) and Jackie Chan (I don't really see the Jackie Chan parody but I can uderstand how some people will.) The final fight sceen also reminds me of a Bruce Lee style fight (Jackie even wears a yellow and black jumpsuit like the one Lee wears in his final movie ""The Game Of Death""). This is a masterwork of Hong Kong comedy and action. If you are not a fan of both of these I wold be wary of buying this moive.",1034553600,3,940,4.0864864864864865

The dubbed dialogue on the DVD is REALLY silly (as is the movie, which is OK). . .a few of the lines are funnier than the original, but so many hilarious lines are changed (to only marginally funny).

There are a few reasons for watching this movie: 1) Jet Li.  2) Chingmy Yau (the reporter).  3) Wu Ma (Frankie's dad)  4) a decent fight scene at the end.  Jacky Cheung is also not as aggravating as usual.  That's it.  Jet Li has appeared in three or four films directed by Wong Jing, and, just as Chow Yun Fat does in God of Gamblers and Jackie Chan does in City Hunter, he does what he can.  The direction of the film, however (as well as GOG and CH), stinks.  The plot copies Die Hard and Speed, with some broad satire aimed at Jackie Chan, but that is not the problem.  Put simply, Jackie Chan knows how to direct a film.  Wong Jing does not.  If you want to see Jet Li, go see Fist of Legend, Once Upon A Time in China, or just about anything else he has done.  If you want to see a good Hong Kong action movie, watch films directed by John Woo, Ringo Lam, Tsui Hark, Jackie Chan, and Sammo Hung.

920468,2,6304745346,"Even Jet Li fans (including me) are disappointed by ""High Risk"", which held so bad a plot no one even remembers it. Sure, acting by Jet Li was superb - as always, but Heavenly King Jacky Cheung of Hong Kong is known as God of Singers, and should stay that way, as he is one of THE worst actors an audience could ever lay eyes upon! He proves my point the most with his acting performance in ""High Risk"". And even if the acting credibility was boosted by replacing Jacky Cheung (right on cover) with a fabulous actor, this movie would only gain another half a star. Plot was incredibly weak and inconsistent and almost typical of early 1990's Hong Kong cinema. Character development? None whatsoever. Camera angles and photography? That's probably the thing that gained one star for this film (The other being Jet Li.) The cover of this film makes special effects seem superb, but don't ever judge a film by its cover. Special effects did not impress.
Out of all Jet Li's Hong Kong films, the kung-fu choreography and kung-fu scenes were the worst in this film, along with his 1993 film ""The Master."" Jet Li left his kung-fu and went to guns (contributing to typical early 1990's HK film).
If you would like to see an awesome kung-fu film of Jet's, this is NOT the one. If you are a true kung-fu fan, Jet Li's best fight sequences are choreographed by Corey Yuen in ""The New Legend of Shaolin"" with Jet's best fight scenes in his entire acting career. If you like guns, see Chow Yun-Fat's ""Hard-Boiled"" or ""A Better Tomorrow"" series.

I know, I know, you fans of spiritual kung-fu are mad at me now but be aware that this movie isn't set up that way.

Like some of his other movies, he does a lot of shooting but never actually goes hand to hand. This is left to Jacky Cheung, who is uninteresting to watch and spends all his fighting time (that is, when he's not being beaten up or running away) making fun of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee, something that is not only completely undeserved, but totally unforgivable since both of them are better actors and martial artists than he is. The whole ""skyscraper"" part of the plot completely rips off Die Hard, another movie that is High Risk/Meltdown's superior and also completely undeserving of ridicule.

Just because Frankie happens to be an egotistical dope with a love of bizarre facial expressions does not mean that he is an imitation of Jackie Chan.

920517,5,6304745346,"This movie is far funnier and less po-faced than the other reviewer gives credit. Who cares if Jet Li doesnt fight a lot, infact that isn't true either he does fight, as he is the stand-in for the actor lampooning Jackie Chan. Jackie Chan even went so far as to try to have the distribution of the movie curtailed because it suggested it was lampooning him. Nor can Jet Li be blamed for this, as the director was the one the accusation was pointed at. It is action packed, and Jet Li's character is very serious. He goes into the action stunt career because of the death of his wife and child in a terrorist attack, the same terrorist is centered around the main plot of the rest of the story, and this is how Jet Li enacts his revenge! There are some excellent action parts, look out for the helicopter! And look out for the obsessed leather clad martial artist who dispises frankie and wants to fight him! Its very funny and very enjoyable, infact its one of the best movies Jet Li has made, and it has the trademark Hong Kong humour. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.",991180800,2,1071,4.36
920518,2,6304745346,"Having seen many other Jet Li movies, I was hyped to see this one.  From what I heard about the movie it is a Hong Kong telling of Die Hard.  I would say it is a movie that makes you love Die Hard even more.  Also known as High Risk, Meltdown stars Jet Li as Kit Li, a bodyguard for the movie star Frankie Lane.  Lane decides to go to a gala featuring the Crown Jewels of Russia, but unfortunately ""the Doctor"" has also decided to go to steal the jewels.  ""The Doctor"" is a huge and ruthless terrorist that was responsible for killing Kit's wife two years earlier. Very few people that would watch this movie would care about the plot of the movie because what they probably want to see is Jet Li beating people up.  They will be very disappointed to learn that Jet Li fights very little in this movie.  He does not even have the typical one-on-one fight with the main villian at the end.  All Jet LI does in this movie is run around every once in awhile shooting someone.  The effects are horrible in this movie and many times you can tell that the ""victims"" are just mannequins.  I have seen enough warmed over versions of Die Hard to know that this one isn't even on the same level as Under Seige or Sudden Death.  There is very few things that make this movie watchable at all but the one thing I liked about this movie was it is the reason that Jackie Chan and Jet Li will never work togther.  Frankie Lane is based on Jackie Chan and they make him a buffoon in this movie.  Since there was no evidence of a script or point to the movie the only thing that was made clear was what Jet Li thinks of Jackie Chan.  Unless you are very bored some night do not rent or buy this movie.  It is stupid, boring, and poorly done.",989280000,2,1724,4.135135135135135
920519,3,6304745346,"For those of us used to Jet Li movies, We know that his family will die soon in the movie and he wil go on a revenge streak. Same in this movie. What is different is ""Frankie"", a mix of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. A character Jet Li is hired as a body guard. Jackie Chan fans will wonder why Jet Li made so much fun of Chan. It makes you wince every now and then. Jackie Chan is easy to make fun of. How do you parady Jet Li? Fight in slow motion and speed it up to look like keystone cops, (No he allready does that). Oh did I mention that the script is stolen from Die Hard? Worth watching if somebody else pays for it.",987379200,2,620,3.813953488372093

7876713,4,6304745346,"Frankie Lone (Jacky Cheung) is a former martial artist turned actor who drinks, carouses, completely overacts and aghast, has body doubles during difficult stunts, though he is advertised as doing all of his stunts often using his bodyguard Lee Git (Jet Li, a bit or irony here is that Li is doubled in this film.) Of course his yojimbo is much more a man then he is and is played a bit too robotically which is unfortunate because Li does have more depth as an actor though sometimes you would not know this from his roles in the 1990s. Lee Git (aka Corny Man) lost his wife and son to a bomb diffusion of a busload of hostages gone wrong two years before. All Lee has is the voice of the perpetrator. We know him as the Doctor (Kelvin Wong; hey, did I not just see him in Don't Give a Damn) a mysterious bad guy who was possibly involved in a previous war who has a Mandarin speaking Mainland crew.

 In the meantime two reporters led by Helen Lok (Chingmy Yau) are trying to uncover if Jackie I mean Frankie uses a stunt double. They follow him to an event at the Granedur Hotel (a take-off of the Grandeur Hotel just kidding it is a misspelling which later is spelled correctly) where there is a show for the rich and famous displaying 19th century Russian Tsar's Nicolas II crown jewels on the 75th floor penthouse. In that hotel is an undercover cop's girlfriend Jayce (Charlie Yeung) whom the Doctor has taken a liking to and who will get mixed up in what has to be one of the not-so-brilliant heists I have seen. By coincidence Lee Git overhears the Doctor while driving away and with Jayce's boyfriend they find a way back into the hotel. Will they succeed in thwarting the heist? Who will die? Will Frankie redeem himself?

 Frankie's manager (Charlie Cho) is a parody of Jackie Chan's manager Willie Chan and Frankie's dad (well played by Wu Ma) is of course a reference to Jackie Chan's dad. Really this whole movie is a combination of a parody of Die Hard (at the time one of Wong Jing's favorite Hollywood films; the Chinese release title of Die Hard was Tiger Courage, Dragon Might while this film's Chinese title translates to Mouse Courage, Dragon Might), a satire on Jackie Chan with random bits of references to Speed, Bruce Lee with Game of Death suit and Lee style vocal noises, of course Wong Jing's own bizarre humor involving urination and much more.

 Wong Jing in certainly an auteur in the way Roger Corman is and has a ""throw in everything including the kitchen sink type"" of attitude with many of his films. This has brought the disdain from many more serious Hong Kong directors like Ann Hui. Because Wong Jing is so prolific he can be quite sloppy in his films and makes me wonder how much he delegates to the second unit, action directors and whoever else is nearby. If you start to think while watching this you might wonder where and why did the bad guys bring lots of snakes and a reptile just to throw on a woman who they did not know would actually be in the bathroom beforehand? Even more ridiculous was the reptile venom antidote in a non-hospital building. Or how about how twice people seemed nonplussed to see a gang of armed assailants. Hey there is shady looking people with automatic weapons, I'll say hi. Or how about how the reporters got a picture of Jet Li coming straight down when they were filming at an angle. Also, how did Song Bong (Billy Chow with an insane mullet that would fit well on a mid-90s WWF wrestler) find Frankie? The use of dummies is quite obvious in the action scenes, almost as obvious as in Casa de mi Padre (2012) though while humorous does make it seem a bit cheap -- almost as cheap as the miniature sets they used.

 Now it is certainly entertaining in many aspects. While the biting satire of Jackie Chan does go overboard and Cheung's overmugging does sometimes get annoying, it is effective and eviscerating attack on Jackie. I was thinking that it should have been more subtle, but I am writing about Wong Jing here and I believe he was trying to be obviously mean. I can easily understand why Jackie Chan was angry about this.* Some of the jokes are funny such as the crotch-grabbing corpse scene which is almost Stephen Chow like. I overall enjoyed the fighting scenes by Corey Yuen. The fisticuffs and footacuffs (not a word, but it should be) with Jet Li and Ben Lam is exciting and well done with nice use of objects you do not normally expect to see. The same goes with the main fight between Jackie Cheung and Billy Chow which is somewhat reminiscent of the finale in The Young Master in which Frankie goes all out to the point of hurting himself. Though I do not think he is always effective with gun battles such as instances where rolling your body helps avoid machine gun fire and no matter how many shots are fired they cannot hit Jet Li (even with an M-60 at close range.). This reminded me of his less-than-stellar gun battles in his directed film Bodyguard from Beijing (1994). But these issues are less noticeable the first time you watch it since Wong Jing keeps a fast pace throughout.

 In 1992 and 1993 director/writer Wong Jing worked with Jackie Chan on City Hunter (1993). Reportedly it was not a pleasant experience for either. But Wong definitely dished a certain amount of cold cinematic revenge with this film, though at a particular cost. While I have not found a primary source on the matter, it has been stated that Li apologized to Jackie Chan for being in this film. It is somewhat telling that Jet Li did not work with Wong Jing as a director again and in most interviews with Jet Li I have read/heard states he has been on friendly terms with Chan. But Li is known for being cordial and usually has polite answers. Li would also later work with Jackie Chan in 2008's The Forbidden Kingdom. Now Frankie's character is redeemed by the end. An all-out assault on Jackie would have had a more biting ending.

 I have two R0/NTSC Universe copies with two different disc covers: a (oooh) shiny one with no decorations and one with Jet Li with a tie. This release has Chinese and English subtitles burnt-in and your choice of the Cantonese and Mandarin audios. On the Cantonese audio you can also hear the antagonists and several others speaking Mandarin and some English is used throughout as well. The print quality is OK, but it is soft and has artifacts (digital noise especially) throughout. I also have a R1/NTSC Columbia Tri-star DVD. On that: the US cut is slightly cut by 29 seconds, though it loses none of the violence. As usual the English dub is not always saying what is in the HK release. It does not have the artifacts that the Universe has, but unfortunately does not have the Cantonese or Mandarin soundtrack yet has a French one. There are optional English and Spanish subtitles. For extras there are Talent Files, Trailer (English), Trailer Gallery (Once Upon a Time in China I-III set, Red Dragon, Gorgeous, The Prisoner) and Photo Gallery with Jet Li Trivia.

 * I recently read Almost Interesting (2015) by David Spade and Spade writes about the infamous issue where he made fun of Eddie Murphy with one comment in a skit and Murphy was upset with him for years. But issues like this are nothing new in cinema. For example William S. Hart (a famous silent cowboy actor) made some disparaging remakes about Buster Keaton's friend Roscoe Arbuckle and Keaton retaliated by making a Hart spoof The Frozen North.",1452643200,,7438,4.545182972367439
7876714,2,6304745346,"Nevermind the edits that Tri-Star and Columbia/Sony went and did to the movie, it wasn't a very good movie to begin with. Titled High Risk and released in 1995, the Jet Li action vehicle from notorious Wong Jing, is a basic attack on Jackie Chan. Yes, the whole plot is a by the numbers Die Hard plot that was also basically the plot of City Hunter basically and that was a better movie.

Wong seems to be firmly in a hateful mood with this movie, his characters act hateful, especially the bad guys. Resulting in the movie being less charming than his other better movies like God of Gamblers and yes City Hunter. Part of the movie's problem is the basic need and want to attack Chan venomously, though it does ultimately give him redemption. It still can't shake the utter contempt that seethes through it with scene after scene of showing the fake Jackie Chan parody be a coward and not doing his own stunts, chase women, scare children in the bathroom.

Meanwhile we have the rather dark Die Hard Clone with Jet Li going on. With the beginning of this movie pretty much setting up that Jing is not in a rather particularly nice mood or maybe it was the writers mood. The whole blowing up a bus full of children including Li's wife and child is rather dark for the opening to this action/sort of comedy. But you learn that a lot of dark stuff gets thrown left and right in this movie, the mood whiplash is heavy with comedy scenes being led into dark action scenes and Billy Chow's character who is an insane in the membrane fan of Not Jackie, I mean Frankie Lone.

And since we couldn't have Chow repeat a fight with Li, since the legendary Fist of Legend bout they had, he gets stuck fighting it out with Not Jackie (Ok, the actor playing Not Jackie is rather a good actor, Jackie Cheung, famous for Tiger Cage and Bullet in the Head, As Tears Go By, Days of Being Wild and he gives a great performance,better than this material deserves) for the character to have some semblance of a character arc of redemption.

Jing obviously had a very nasty falling out with Chan during the making of City Hunter and it obviously shows in this movie that Jing is not letting some things go. And is poking fun at Chan nearly too much, to the point of ridiculousness. He even makes rather negative references to Chan's current projects of Rumble in the Bronx and First Strike even, though it was in the process of being filmed.  Meanwhile Jet Li is battling the evil terrorists of Criminal Mastermind  ""Doctor"" played with hammy relish by Kelvin Wong who played a another bad guy in that same years Sammo Hung misfire Don't Give A Damn as the Japanese crime lord Yamamoto. He spends way too much time playing the Asian version of Hans Gruber times 10, blowing a bus full of children up, killing innocent people during what was suppose to be a normal Jewel Heist that quickly spirals out of control into a hostage situation. I take it back, he's even more careless than Hans Gruber, he's really just a sociopath bumping people off left and right. He's also got his own little personal gang of psychopathic terrorist clowns that include Billy Chow as a weirdo insane fanboy. Plus in their off time the bad guys read porn magazines like Penthouse, Hustler, and you have to laugh.

Thankfully, Jet Li gives him a nasty comeuppance at the end. This is all fine, the action, the Jewel Heist story line with the Die Hard rip-off, all of it is ok, but the Jackie Chan pot shots are so annoying and clog the movie down and give the movie terminal whiplash. Plus, they get cruder and cruder, the bathroom scene being the worst.

It seems kind of fitting that Wong Jing ultimately kind of lost this bout, that same year Rumble in the Bronx did really well, as did First Strike the next and finally Mr. Nice Guy, Chan did Rush Hour and became even more of an international star, and Wong just kept to what he knew when it came to making movies that worked in HK moviehouses.  And also Jet Li would move beyond this movie as well, doing My Father is A Hero the same year, a way better movie and Black Mask the next. Li would also work his way into the outside world. Something that Jing obviously holds contempt for by evidence of this movie, and it's rather ironic. In some ways I think Jing envied Chan's fame outside of the HK market, but it's more than obvious that he and Jackie had some deep unseated issues after City Hunter.",1446854400,2,4411,4.442521631644005
