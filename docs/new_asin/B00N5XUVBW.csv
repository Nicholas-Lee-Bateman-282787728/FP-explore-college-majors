8676431,3,B00N5XUVBW,"Odd and surprisingly playful Hong Kong horror comedy about a tram bus that travels through a tunnel late at night filled with passengers--when it gets to the other side the city is the same but also completely different--there are no people or cars or anything moving on the street other than the bus--the city appears to be completely abandoned.

The Midnight After offers a multitude of possible reasons for what's going on--maybe the bus crashed in the tunnel and everyone on the bus is dead and the world is going on as normal without them.  Maybe it's a contagion--some people do die from what appears to be a very nasty disease although that doesn't explain where all the cars went.  Maybe it's an alien invasion.  Maybe it's a plot by the Japanese.  Maybe there is a religious explanation.  Maybe they drove through some sort of wormhole and jumped forward six years in time--although as one of the characters helpfully points out, Hong Kong doesn't do science fiction.

If you watch The Midnight After expecting some grand explanation for everything you will be disappointed--after a while it becomes clear the movie is chasing its own tail and that the various theories are never going to lead anywhere--kind of like Lost, but at least The Midnight After doesn't waste 6 seasons of your time to get there.  The Midnight After is best appreciated in individual scenes as the characters try to figure out why they survived, or if they survived, and what possibly being the last people on earth could mean, morally.  Is rape and murder OK now since there are no longer any societal consequences--no police, no jail, no law?

Fruit Chan's movie is quite a bit lighter than I'm making it sound.  He has fun playing with the tropes of post-apocalyptic films like 28 Days Later and I Am Legend and The Mist but humor comes at unexpected times--a scene where the characters decide that one person among them did something so heinous that he should be executed--by everyone, Murder on the Orient Express style, with each taking their turn at a stab with the knife is played for comedy.  There's also a surprising diversion into David Bowie's Space Oddity that feels like a possible homage to Flight of the Concords.  The David Bowie song turns up more than once in The Midnight After and it's always used to good effect.

I was ready to write off The Midnight After as a pointless and overlong (slightly over 2 hours) goof but Fruit Chan would come up with a funny idea or an unexpectedly well-executed special effect or another way to insert Space Oddity into the proceedings and he kept me watching, moderately amused and interested if not exactly engrossed--then Fruit Chan comes up with an unexpected grace note for his characters at the end and I found myself actually moved, which might was the film's biggest surprise.

The Midnight After will most definitely not appeal to people who demand clear storytelling and concrete explanations--it's one of those movies where you need to be able to go along for the ride and enjoy the individual scenes and out-of-left-field humor without worrying too much about if it's all actually leading somewhere because mostly it isn't.",1433808000,,3176,4.823204419889502
