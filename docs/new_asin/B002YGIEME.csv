8384217,1,B002YGIEME,"Watching this has been like an everlasting purgatory of continual suffering for crimes committed and endless overtures of regret.  Regret is most definitely the one staying emotion one feels when seeing this movie, so replete with crumbiness that it is soon forgotten.  My God, with a title as good as One Damned Day At Dawn, you would think the writing might come to the fore and redeem this damn picture, but alas it does not.  Nor does it have any redeeming value whatsoever.  You might as well be watching television, because this is definitely not cinema.  It is well packaged crap.

I'm just glad I'm didn't have to endure the shame of this production with a sober, judicious mind.  On the plus side, there are beautiful horses parading around like muscle cars in Dukes of Hazard; not bad at all - the one redeeming value of the movie.  With the ridiculous campiness of an 80s video, there is the showdown between the corrupt rancher/whatever of the town and the sheriff (a sensitive, brown-eyed Jeremy Irons type), now knocked out with a clich bottle of bourbon (in typical B-movie style) and locked in the the cell of his own jail by the far more interesting anti-hero/outlaw/bounty hunter who takes his place for the final confrontation, like unto Doc Holiday in Tombstone.

But there is swift justice in the execution of god forsaken bastard quickly dispatched to hell and exciting reports of guns and horsey neighing.  Like I said, the horses are beautiful, but what is this movie trying to be about anyways?  It's just like some painful therapy:  you want it to be over as soon as possible so you can get on with your life.  God, what a dog!  Ok, there's all this European existentialist whatever dialogue transported to a Western, but WTF?

`'You want that bounty, don't you Django?  You're nothin' but a bounty hunter!""

A B-movie fist fight ensues.

Last scene with saucy Latino jazz and a sexy-ass dark bittersweet morsel of a horse that looks delicous.  Spanish trumpet of matador persuasion as anti-hero rides out of town, the hard deed now done, all things now being mete and good.",1337040000,,2100,4.751381215469613
8384218,4,B002YGIEME,"Wild East Productions continues its Spaghetti Western double features giving front stage to specific Euro Actors this time highlighting Hunt Powers aka Jack Betts but it really should be the director Miles Deem aka Demofilo Fidani who this package belongs to.  Deem was an eccentric Euro director who loved his westerns and made films under different pseudonyms , he made at least sixteen Spaghetti Westerns of which these two are standouts.  Powers has an incredible presence but it seems that the co-stars steal the energy from him.  First up is 'ONE DAMNED DAY AT DAWN...DJANGO MEETS SARTANA' a title which was used to cash in on its characters box office successes.  Fabio Testi owns the film as the new sheriff of Black City who gets into the middle of a feud between two bandit gangs.  Enter Hunt Powers who is looking for the killers of his wife and by the end of its running time, both men join forces in the inevitable showdown. In between, Deem gives incredible flashbacks and keeps things moving at a great pace. The second entry 'DEAD MEN DON'T MAKE SHADOWS' aka another eccentric title 'THE STRANGER THAT KNEELS BESIDE THE SHADOW OF A CORPSE' is a confusing storyline which is tied up nicely at the climax. The standouts are the stunning Simone Blondell who is in both films, Gordon Mitchell as a gritty gunslinger and the crisp cinematography by future exploitation director Joe D'Amato billed here as Aristide Massaccesi.  This film has to be experienced, a summary would be futile.  Both films have a music score by Coriolano Gori which borrow from each other and they both are in 1.85 aspect ratios in sharp transfers off beautiful negatives for these rare outings.  So kick back your dusty boots, pour yourself a nice shot of Old Grandad and spend an afternoon with two oddball oaters.  They are extremely entertaining and a must for Spaghetti Western fans. Again, thank you Wild East.",1288656000,5,1903,4.8307692307692305
