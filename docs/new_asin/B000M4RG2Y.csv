8166231,4,B000M4RG2Y,"THis is a great video for fans and casual listener of EC. In consists of 5 interviews from 1986 to 1998 aprox. This is one of the dwonsides of the DVD, no dates on the interviews whatsoever, although fans will recognize the diferent eras.

You can listen to EC talk about music with a ver pretty interviewer in a pre 1986 show, where slowhand seem to be flirting with the reporter, and she with him.

In antoher candid interview Clapton shares the feelings and emotions regarding the loss of his son, and how he coped with it, very emotional, finally we get to see a very good humored EC joke around in the 1998 interview.

Production wise the DVD lacks in video quality and sound, and no as mentioned, no dates or sources of the interviews, which nonetheless give an insight into a very talented but media shy man.",1192665600,3,815,4.456375838926174
8166232,4,B000M4RG2Y,"This is a very good DVD - it contains interviews from about 1986 through 1998.  There is a portion which was done one year after his son's death - and the interview was handled very well - and Clapton's responses to the questions give a very good insight to the man himself.

The last interview leaves you rolling.  I am unsure of who the personalities are - but you laugh until you cry.  Eric can laugh at his own mistakes.

He is human - and a good person.  This is worth the watch.",1178496000,9,484,4.150537634408602
8166233,4,B000M4RG2Y,"If you have a few Clapton DVDs/Videos then you've seen small parts of some of these interviews. What is interesting here is you get the entire session on some of these. You see Eric interacting with the interviewers as if the camera is not on. Plus there's a few interviews, like some looney UK TV show, that people in the US wouldn't have seen.

The portrait displayed is of a genuine man. It's very cool, while I'm sure EC isn't entirely off his guard, he is very casual.

And while the only music is supplied by a 'TV show band' playing a bad rendition of Layla for 10 seconds, this is well worth it for the EC fan.

And yeah, it does say 'INTERVIEWS' on the box. Couldn't be clearer!",1176249600,14,687,4.269230769230769
8166234,4,B000M4RG2Y,"This is a rather interesting look into the character of music icon Eric Clapton. Through various interviews, the viewer learns more about the man AND the music. If you are a Clapton fan, this is nearly required.

The other reviewer is an IDIOT!!! It clearly says on the poster icon and the description that these are INTERVIEWS ONLY, NO PERFORMANCES BY THE ARTIST. Well, I guess it is too much to assume that someone would actually read the poster and the description of the product.",1175817600,6,483,4.682352941176471
