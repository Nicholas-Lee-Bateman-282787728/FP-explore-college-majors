2455174,5,B000CBG5OC,"this is a fantastic movie! only the costumes and make-up got a bit copycatting from the western movies, such as 'conan, the barbarian'...the settings, the directing, especially the fighting scenes are all fantastic. only the female castings are not too good. there should be a sequel to this.",1137628800,3,292,5.104166666666667
2455175,5,B000CBG5OC,"Seven Swords, brings to the screen the story of seven warriors as they try to save the people of a village from the new emperor's mercenary assassins/head-hunters. One thing is for sure; there is more to 17th Century China than meets the eye...

The film combines romance, drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind!

Moreover, the fascinating culture and traditions of China are presented very well in the film.

The plot is excellent and opens a window into the mysterious Orient.

Furthermore, shot on location it provides for some amazing scenery.

Needless to say, the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100%!  Their great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.

The setting, the dialogues, the music, the battle sequences, and the costumes are all wonderful!

Very well written and very well presented, it is a movie definitely worth owning, let alone watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History, and especially for Eastern/Oriental enthusiasts.

Strongly recommended along with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The House of Flying Daggers, and Hero, to those with a soft spot for all things Chinese.",1137456000,43,1333,5.12962962962963

2455192,1,B000CBG5OC,"I am stumbled as to where to start with this movie.  So many bad things to say, so little time.

What I liked:
Donnie Yen:  His talent and skill in martial arts really does make it an art.  But his role in this is marginal and his acting is sub-par.

What I didn't like:
Donnie Yen:  I didn't see him until well into the movie, although he is front & center in the cover.  His acting was not believable after he ""revives"" from near death to glorious hero.
THE STORY:  There were too many plots, people, sub plots and minutia to go though.  You need a shovel and you'd reach China before ever understanding what it is they are trying to say.  The movie went on for forever.  The end shows them setting up for a sequel.  No thanks!
UNNECESSARY & LENGTHY SCENES:  It seems that the Chinese actors here and the director have fallen victim to an identity crisis.  The movie tries to be traditional Chinese while incorporating Western values to appeal to a broader audience.  Unnecessary sex scenes, bipolar female actresses and too many plots made this movie tedious.
THE ACTORS:  Bad actors all around although few good ones you will recognize.  But in the end they didn't develop characters you really cared about.  When you figured out who the bad guy is you either don't care or you will say ""who was that again?""

SUMMARY:  We both found ourselves looking at the clock, wondering if the story was every going to ""get there"" and then hoping it was there even though nothing made any sense.  The story stunk.  The fight scenes were over-glorified gore, no finesse, not what we expect from Chinese martial arts movies.  More like a Hollywood B movie.  The innuendoes in the sex scene screamed that they wanted to be part of Hollywood.  The costumes were just ho-hum.  In the end there, you can just move on, nothing to here to see folks.",1436832000,,1834,4.498480243161095

Especially if your not looking for Academy Award winning material in every movie you watch.

2455224,4,B000CBG5OC,"Seven lead heroes with backstories and complications.  It can be hard to keep things straight.  In the original language one character spoke only Korean while the rest spoke Chinese.  But the sub-titles or English translation hides the facts the she cannot understand or be understood by anyone but the one hero who also comes from Korea.
It has the magic of a non-American film.  The images, the dialogue, the movements of the actors and even the pace of the scenes gives you the authentic feel of otherness that makes this type of movie, when well done like this, an interesting view.
Why only 4 stars, at times it got a little hokie, and leaves you wondering is that comic relief or just bad writing.",1379548800,,703,4.645161290322581
2455225,5,B000CBG5OC,"This is a terrific, Chinese epic film based on a wuxia novel. The story and characters were meant to be very complex. The movie however just touches a little on it. There were also supposed to be eventually a few sequels. The movie is not perfect with some issues that are easy to point out; however, I found it to be really engrossing with a witty filming style. It's a little more on the violent side, but the good certainly outweighs the bad.

The basic premises of the story is...  In the mid 1600's, the Ching dynasty takes over and many harsh laws are imposed. Martial arts are outlawed and anyone can be executed if they resist. A general named 'Fire-Wind' from the previous dynasty is corrupt and causes trouble in the western area of China; however, gallant sword-fighters come to the rescue and fend off the corrupt army. Each swordsman carries a uniquely casted weapon. The fantasy aspect is rather subtle, and war is more of the focal point.

The Dragon Dynasty 2-disc DVD has plenty of special features. Mandarin and English are the selectable language tracks.",1377302400,,1073,4.696808510638298

2455227,4,B000CBG5OC,"I purchased this movie on a recommendation by a friend. It's a decent foreign move but it's a l-o-n-g movie.  It takes full concentration to watch due to the sub titling and in some instances, you must be a speed reader because like many of these movies, they don't give the average reader much time to read the sub titles before moving on to the next scene.
It's not one of my favorites but it does have a lot of martial arts and sword play. If you like that kind of stuff then you might like this movie.",1373760000,,505,4.153061224489796

2455230,1,B000CBG5OC,"There were a lot of atmospherics, special effects, scenery and potentially interesting characters but terribly jumpy and incomprehensible story line and no character development. That really was a terrible waste of money and good title, characters from the novel and scenery, but with no character or plot developments that hold my interest. What a stupid movie.",1365465600,2,362,5.482142857142857
2455231,4,B000CBG5OC,"Seven Swords has some fantastic swordplay, magnificent scenery, interesting drama, and maybe about 25 minutes more on its runtime than it should.

Seven Swords is the saga of a village on the run from an army of bounty hunting mercenaries being protected by 7 master swordsmen( one of whom is indeed a woman). There is not much more to the story, but what it lacks in plot-points and character depth, it makes up for with excellent character drama and frenetic fight scenes.

Being shot on some beautiful locations, Seven Swords picturesque majesty is enough to forgive the fact that its downright slow in places. A little over an hour in, I realized not all that much had happened at all so far, and the way things were going, not much more was likely to happen. It's not bolstered with a lot of action scenes either, so it treads the line towards being plodding, but thankfully never fully takes the plunge. As I said, the characters don't get a whole ton of depth, but their interactions are always engaging and believable so that you remain hooked.

And it's made up for when we reach the finale, a climax that's so masterfully shot that I even forgot I ever thought the movie was anything but epic. Some people may be clamoring to this movie for some Donnie Yen action, and although he only serves a place in an ensemble rather than starring, that doesn't mean we are denied incredible action. It was thrilling, and redeemed a good deal of the slower parts of the movie.

Overall, I would about give it 3 stars because it feels like it needs some fat trimmed off its 2 and a half hour runtime, but since I can't pinpoint any scene I could say I could do without, it receives four stars.

Tsui Hark fans will be well pleased with the Blu-Ray as well. It's loaded with plenty of special making of features and interviews, including a full commentary with the director.",1365206400,,1871,4.556547619047619

2455233,3,B000CBG5OC,"I'm a big fan of Tsui Hark's movies but I found the story line a bit scattered and unnecessarily long on this one! Although the cinematography was excellent and the production value is very high, I found it hard to really connect with any of the characters and the scenes/storyline don't really flow that well for me. However, there are some really fantastic action and sword fighting sequences and the swordplay at the end of the movie is definitely worth the wait!

2455234,3,B000CBG5OC,"In this film,which tells a story taking place in the early 1600s,one sees a woman eating...corn(!!!) with great pleasure.
Corn is originary from the american continent and arrived for the first time to Europe via Spain in the late XVII.

2455237,4,B000CBG5OC,"In the early 1600s, an imperial edict is passed throughout China: that the practice of Martial Arts is forbidden and that the punishment for those who do not comply is death. Military leaders are sent out across the countryside in order to silence any dissenters, gaining a considerable bounty for their troubles. One such leader is the brutal Firewind who sets his sights on an idyllic but isolated village where a great number of Martial Artists still live. Learning of this plan, the elderly Fu Qingzhu (a retired executioner and torturer who worked for the last dynasty) rushes to warn the village in the hopes of atoning for his past crimes.

Once there he rescues young Yuanying from one of Firewind's men, and she decides to repay him by smuggling him out of the village after her people sentence him to death. Helped by her childhood friends Han and Fang, Yuanying follows Qingzhu's instructions in taking him to Mount Heaven to gain help from the master swordsmen who live there. The reclusive Shadow-Glow sends four of his best students to help the village, giving all of them specialized swords to fight with, and dubbing them the Seven Swords.

Once this set-up is complete, it's pretty much pure action (with only a few quiet scenes) until the credits roll. Firewind's slightly odd-looking Goth-punk soldiers are a blood-thirsty bunch, and there is plenty of blood and gore to behold: decapitated heads, splattered blood, impaled bodies, twitching fingers, and so on. In response, the Seven Swords use their tactical skills in order to out-fight and out-maneuver Firewind's forces, leading the refugees from the village to a cave network in the hopes of hiding them from their enemies. On the way it becomes apparent that there is a traitor in their midst, and the climactic battle is split between the Seven Swords confrontation with Firewind and the villagers' attempt to defeat the traitor in the caves.

""Seven Swords"" is very much a homage to Akira Kurosawa's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Samurai/dp/B003KGBISY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Samurai</a>, (as the title would suggest), and I was surprised to see so many lukewarm reviews considering it contained all the essential ingredients of a typical wuxia film: an extensive cast, beautiful cinematography, melodramatic love, elaborate fight scenes and an epic scale. There are a ton of characters to keep track of, not just the Seven Swords, but also a couple of love interests, a gang of villains, an array of villagers, and a bunch of children. For the most part it's fairly easy to delineate who's who given the archetypal nature of many characters, and there are a few standouts; particularly the Korean slave-girl Green Pearl who the Seven Swords rescue, who then becomes the first suspect of treachery given that she cannot speak the language in order to defend herself. Also nice was the use of the child characters throughout the film: they are not just cute, but helpful and brave as well.

There are a couple of silly bits: love scenes involve a lot of heavy breathing and love-biting, and Firewind has an ""evil laugh"" that sounds exactly like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Muttley-s-wheezy-giggle/dp/B0007QS31A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Muttley's wheezy giggle</a>. Structurally the film is easily divided into three: the first act in which the characters and circumstances are introduced, the second in which both sides of the conflict begin to move against one another (the best part of the movie), and the final act that has the good guys split up into two groups. At this point the film loses some of its momentum, and it's rather ironic that the Seven Swords spend the entirety of this segment attempting to save one of their comrades (who stupidly wandered into Firewind's lair) instead of protecting the villagers (who are left to the mercy of the traitor).

The actors fill their rather simplistic characterization with passion and energy, and are clearly pros when it comes to the elaborate fight-scenes. There is a wonderfully choreographed battle between Firewind and Cho in which both are hampered by the narrowness of the corridor they find themselves in, and thus are forced to brace themselves against the walls, allowing them to climb to a higher position and fight vertically rather than horizontally.

As it was originally planned as the first of a hexalogy ""Seven Swords"" ends up feeling like a small piece of something larger. This on two counts: not just that there's plenty of room for a number of sequels, but that the original cut of the movie was originally four hours long. Given the rather patchy plot, I would have been quite happy to watch an extended version of the film in order to get a better understanding of the characters and their backstories - as it is, many may feel they got the worst of both worlds: an incredibly long film that *still* doesn't deliver on plot or characterization. For instance, there is a sequence in which Han must free the horses in order to create a false trail for Firewind to follow, leading to a tearful goodbye to his favourite horse called Luck Joy, who cannot understand why he's being abandoned. It's a beautifully shot and performed scene, and yet it comes out of nowhere. Having been given no background to the bond between the man and horse, the scene feels a bit hollow. The same could be said for all the relationships that exist within the film.

Despite this, the DVD is packed full of special features. Not only a subtitled director's commentary, but also deleted scenes, interviews with the cast and crew, trailers, and photo galleries. For whatever it's worth, I enjoyed ""Seven Swords"", though it would have greatly benefited from a tighter storyline or perhaps a longer running time. Given the mixed reviews here on Amazon, perhaps it's safer to rent before buying, as I can see why this would be a divisive viewing experience.",1336780800,,5992,5.120654396728017

The movie started off ok and then it went downhill.  The story line didn't make much sense, and fighting was lame.  I don't know what it is with the movies that Yen is in, but they haven't been good.  Plus, they didn't show him much in the movie to begin with.

I've often though about taking the movie back to the store, not for a refund since it's too late for that, just to put it back on the shelf and pretend I never bought it.  I can't even sell this movie to anyone in good conscience.  Give it away you ask?  It would equal giving away a swift kick to the balls.

Donny Yen is awesome but even he wasn't able to save this movie.  I honestly can not understand how anyone can like this movie.  The plot was so convuluted, the movie didn't know if it wanted to be straight up fantasy or a realistic war movie.  It was WAY too long.

But the subtitles are pretty lame, the plot vaporizes after the first half hour, the lead characters are so unappealing as to invite apathy toward their plight, and after tolerating at least half of the movie's banal non-sequiturs, you may find your mind wandering to more pleasant thoughts... like having your gums scraped or painting your house with your toothbrush. One very small example - two refugees are hiding out in a blizzard with a man who appears to be some kind of Sherpa herdsman; the people do not understand one another so communication is nonexistent, suddenly giant meteors fall and a hidden valley with bright flowers appears for a moment, after which the snow is in place again and the Ancient Master of All Martial Wisdom sends forth the seven swordspersons to defend the poor villagers from the Emperor's servants, who behead everything in sight. I was rather hoping that Godzilla would appear in a moment and begin trampling everything to dust, but no such luck.

I'm not sure where to start with my critique of this film but you can believe me that it was awful.
I enjoy Chinese films because I like the action, hopefully appreciate the characters, and, if I'm lucky, find the plot entertaining. This movie was poorly written with a markedly unsuffisticated story line. The acting was so stoic that I couldn't even guess what the characters were thinking. The three major fight scenes were mediocre and predictable. A few colorful panoramic scenes didn't make this film any better.
I'm fairly easy to please but this movie was a total bust. If you want my copy I'll give it to you but don't waste your two hours and thirty three minutes. RHT",1277856000,5,706,4.656

2455254,2,B000CBG5OC,"For this review, I'll address on what most people will probably be asking about this Dragon Dynasty blu-ray release, ""how is the Picture and Sound quality?""

Picture quality:  Very good.  The details are exquisite, you can see what type of fabrics that were used for the clothes.  When the camera zoom-in, you can even see the fine details and design of each costume.  It is quite mesmerizing.  I'm very impressed with the image quality on this release, as the color is quite natural to give an extra boost.  Do be adviced though, while the image is clean, color is great, don't expect any 3D pop or insane sharpness like most recent blu-ray release.  From a scale of 1(trash)-10(best), the image quality easily fit in 8/10.  No edge-enhancement was found.

Audio quality:  This release ONLY came with Dolby Digital 5.1 Mandarin and English.  YES!  ONLY DD5.1!!!  This is where I'm most disappointed.  I mean, Blu-ray have been around quite long already, I just can't see why Dragon Dynasty only released this action pack movie in DD5.1, especially the Hong Kong Blu-ray Edition of this movie have DTS-HD Master 7.1 / PCM7.1, and that release was many years ago.  To add more disappointment to Dragon Dynasty release, the DD5.1 mixed is very uneven and scattered.  Many sound effect were lost as the result of compressed audio DD5.1.  It can really be irritating, especially, when the DD5.1 bass simply can't reach low enough to match the director's vision.  Also, the beautiful soundtrack is completely drowned by it ugly compression of DD5.1.  Which to me, is serious disappointment.  From the scale of 1(trash)-10(best), I'll give the audio of this release a (4/10).  Just because Mandarin track is included.  A very disappointment release.

After my experience with Dragon Dynasty of ""Seven Swords"", I will no longer pre-order anything from this company again.  ""Seven Swords"" from Dragon Dynasty is a disappointment.  You have been warned!

Note:  I wish Amazon.com would revise they spec listing for Blu-ray.  Hello? there is such thing called ""DTS-HD MASTER"" and ""Dolby TruHD"" on Format?  Plus, it is not ""DVD Release Date"", it is ""BLU-RAY"" release date.  Time to upgrade the list?",1276214400,25,2188,4.9944444444444445

But the cut provided was very entertaining, with some great fights, and some very unique bad guys, which is often a rarity in kung fu movies.  The only real complaint I had, beyond the aforementioned wholes in the story, would be the dubbing.  Most was very off, but donnie yens voice sounded more like he was michael clark duncan than donnie yen.

2455270,3,B000CBG5OC,"This was a movie I wanted to like more than I actually did. The production quality, and the cinematography grabs the hand of this movie and leads it down the road of masterpiece. But it's either the story or the editing that walks with the two left feet along the way. This movie probably needed another hour in order to pull off what it wanted to accomplish -- which is be an Action Story, and not just an Action Movie. The Director had the admirable goal of making us an emotional spectator, but because he's burdened with placing Seven Protagonists behind the Seven Swords, he has only a handful of minutues to offer any kind of substantial backstory to each character. There were times when the subtext of some character seemed to have just emerged out of nowhere. I'd give examples, but to be honest, I can't identify any of the multi-characters by name. so I'll just say, as an example, that ""some guy"" whose backstory was that of a farmer (I think) seemed to be pretty broken up when it was decided that he had to set his horses free. Especially, the Horse JoyLuck, whose name I can remember. By the way, I'm *not* being sarcastic here. That was really how I approached that scene, since prior to it, I can't recall any build up. Maybe I missed it.

Amazingly, despite the cloudiness of the JoyLuck scene, I was still somewhat moved by it, a sure credit to the cinematography and the heart breaking score by Kenji Kawai. Both do an amazing job of compensating for what I just couldn't gather from the story. I have to believe that juggling seven characters in the writers/directors world is as dangerous as juggling seven swords. And despite my clueless detachment from the motivation of the characters, I enjoyed watching them when they went into battle. My conclusion is that the Writers (Three of them) and the Director knew what they were doing, they just didn't have enough screen-time to pull it off.",1212105600,,1913,4.609970674486804

The seven swords from Mountain Tian had their own distinctive personalities and they only fitted to the beholders.  I believe that Tsui Hark is to a certain extent influenced by Lord of the Rings trilogy where the so called baddies had those gothic-emo look (talking about mixing the old with the new).  Considering that this is a triple joint venture with various film studios, more budget is expended in giving it a more authentic look by filming it at the picturesque XinJiang.  There's also a subplot of love triangle between the main character (Donnie Yen) and the Korean female love interest.  Truthfully, the movie feels a tad slow with nonstop action sequence.  Perhaps, I expect Seven Swords to have more depth.

For those who find Wuxia films like Hero, House Of Flying Daggers, and Curse Of The Golden Flower to be perfect you may lose interest in this quickly.  Gone is alot of the ""beautiful"" and artistic fights only to be replaced with more brutal swordplay action that leaves heads split and limbs detached... and thankfully next to zero flying!  Many reviewers have blasted the movie for cutting its original runtime of over four hours(!) to the aforementioned two and a half, and although I'm one of the fans who would love to see the full version too, I can't knock the reasoning for the edits(although a second disc with the full-length film would have been nice Dragon Dynasty!) and they seem to have been done as well as was posible.  It's true that you don't get to know all of the characters as good as you would like, but you get enough to keep you more than interested in them until the very end.  Another knock is the stylish garb of the villains, who look like they have been displaced from a Mad Max movie rather then ancient China.  But still, once you see just how vicious and ruthless they are, the costumes seem like a perfect choice.

2455281,3,B000CBG5OC,"Based in the In the mid 1600's Seven Swords revolves around death, greed, and of course seven heroes. The Manchurians have taken over China and built the Qing Dynasty. The new government is banning the practice of Martial Arts fearing that the villages that practice it could rebel. This ban is far worst than you can imagine, the services of the Fire-Wind army are acquired to help make this law certain. The only thing the army cares about is money and they make a profit off eliminating entire villages that practice martial arts to make sure a martial artists never walks the earth again. The next village is the final frontier, Martial Village and Fire-Wind has their eyes set on it. After learning this information from an old man named Fu Qingzhu (Liu Chia-Liang) escaping Fire-Wind to save the art. You may remember Liu from Drunken Master 2.

In seek of help Fu accompanied by two villagers go searching for the Heavenly Mountains. Heavenly Mountains give them help, 4 fighters and seven swords. Three swords go to Fu and the two villagers but the only one of them who is truly skilled is Fu. After receiving this help the seven swords hurry back to the village but do they get there in time. The three star rating was a hard one to decide on simply because this is a great movie but things are missing. The biggest being that the movie is edited to about 2 hours and 33 minutes but the original unedited film is said to be about 4 hours long. The editing is horrible; too much scene jumping and you feel like you missed things throughout the entire movie. You'll be sitting there asking questions like when did they get there or do that? Who is that? And when did he learn to do that?

Now of course since this is called ""Seven Swords"" the comparisons with ""Seven Samurai"" may come flying and yea it's like it and no it's not as good but this is still a descent film. If Dragon Dynasty were to put a second disc in the case with the unedited version like they did with ""The Protector"" this movie would get a way higher rating from me. I have so many things I loved about this movie though one being the amazing fight scenes and choreography. Donnie Yen was the best of them all and his character also got most of the spotlight. The things they thought up for this movie is sick, like sword fights in tight cramped spaces, which may sound impossible, but they definitely pulled it off.

The acting was really good, the camera angles were great, and though the picture was cool it could've been better lit. I understand that bad character development may kill the movie a bit for some which is another thing that can probably be chalked up to the bad editing. The cool thing is that this could definitely be mad into a sequel; I think there is a plan to make a couple more. The characters sure so good that they could have their own movie after these films especially Donnie Yen who deserves one. Seven Swords is a film that could be great if that other hour and 30 minutes can be put back in but for right now take it as it is cause it's worth seeing.",1177459200,2,3060,4.402826855123675
2455282,3,B000CBG5OC,"The Seven Swords is one of those movies that could have been so much more but fell a bit short.  The film has shot itself in the foot with too much plot, confusing sub character plots, plot holes and some very confusing sequences and over complex storytelling.  So many characters to get to know, the bad dudes and the origin of these 7 enchanted swords, a lot to digest in one movie when all you want to see is these different fighters and their swords in action.

Let's face it, movies like this are about the action, and when this movie does it right it's really right.  A lot of the fight scenes seem to fall short until the end of the film, and then they rock.  You get to see all the swords in action and each person use there own skill and techniques that make them unique.  The finial fight between the main bad dude and Donnie Yen is worth the price of the movie itself.  Some awesome swordplay and flawless wire work, it's just awesome.  I don't know if I could sit though this movie again but I pop it in and watch the fight scenes all the time.  I love Tsui Hark as a director but this one was filled with too much other stuff.  I do love the look of the film and I unfortunately have one of the foreign DVD's with no dubbing, so keeping up with the plot and watching everything happening is a bit difficult.  Since it just got an American DVD release I would recommend this to any fan of Donnie Yen or fans of martial arts films that are a bit out of the box.  This movie is unique in many ways so it's worth checking out",1175731200,,1534,4.127946127946128
2455283,5,B000CBG5OC,The movie Seven Swords is a really fantastic spectacular production with a really great story line and cast. This is a must for lovers of history and action.,1170892800,,157,4.642857142857143
2455284,1,B000CBG5OC,"Okay, first things first: ""The Magificent 7"" or ""Seven Samurai,"" this movie is most definitely NOT.

It is more like ""The Storm Riders"" meets ""Conan"" meets ""Mad Max.""

The action is grotesque, without any really great choreography. The plot is thin. Character development is poor. Overall, very poorly done...

Don't waste your time or money.",1170547200,6,342,5.181818181818182
2455285,4,B000CBG5OC,"Yes the other reviewers are correct. Its difficult to go into a lot of character development when you have 7 characters (not counting the bad guys) to fit into a two hour movie. It would have been nice to find out more about the bad guys also. And yes you have to ""fill in the blanks"" because it doesn't explain a lot but hey its not a four hour movie so they can only do so much.  But you can also simply relax and just enjoy an action flix. It reminded me of the Magnificent 7 and 7 Samurai in that there are 7 of them coming to the aid of a 'helpless' village against the bad guys. If you like action/martial arts movies at least rent this one.

While its not the best action flix its not the worst neither. I certainly enjoyed it more than Crank (which I had high expectations for, hoping it would be as good as Transporter.)

I'd give it 3 1/2+ stars but bumped it up to 4 rather than down to 3 due to the extra features along with an uncut version (haven't viewed that just yet but did go through most of the interviews.)

I'm considering getting the Seven Swordsmen DVD box set which according to reviewers of that TV Series is a more detailed story about the individual characters.",1169510400,23,1189,4.201754385964913
