8009259,5,B00019U9VK,This is a great video if you want to get fit. I couldn't even make it all the way through this video. Of course I haven't exercised for 20 years. Billy really knows his stuff. I now have his complete library and love each time I exercise. I would recommend this tape and all of Billy Balnks workouts.,1359763200,,300,4.189655172413793
8009260,2,B00019U9VK,"This is not like your regular TAE BO dvd's, I did not enjoy it, and didn't feel like I got a nice energetic workout.  I should note I did not buy the punching bag, my husband and I just shadow boxed, but I just feel like TAE BO is known for heart pumping cardio, and this should be more like a nap with a few punches.",1292803200,2,317,3.803030303030303
