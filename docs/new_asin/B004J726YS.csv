8431764,4,B004J726YS,Very nice opera with the proper setting and wonderful choice of singers. But I must say what really got my attention was the picture of another phenomenal opera singer of the 50''. Love the salute the Diva!,1482451200,,206,4.594594594594595

8431766,4,B004J726YS,"I am reviewing the ""La Sonnambula"" with Eglise Gutierrez.  I have also watched the Eva Mei performance, which is somewhat inferior to this one.  And a few years ago, I also watched the excellent production from the 1950's with a very young Anna Moffo, which was filmed in black and white.  This production, of course, is in beautiful, sharp color, with very lovely painted backdrops.  The female protagonist, Eglise Gutierrez, has a fair-sized, clear, gorgeous young voice with a perfectly timed vibrato and excellent coloratura work.  Towards the end of her final aria, ""Ah! non giunge"", she interpolates a spectacular High F.  Now that's something nobody else ever does, outside Mozart's Queen of the Night aria from the Magic Flute.  She need only lose about 30 lbs., and she would be a real diva!  If she can keep her voice so young and fresh sounding, there is no limit to what she could accomplish.
  Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is merely passable, including the tenor.  This is definitely a production with only one star, but until Miss Gutierrez films this at a major opera house like the Met, I think that this is probably the best production we will find.  And even if she sang it at the Met, they would probably ruin it like they ruin everything else by changing the time period, and giving it cheap, minimalist sets.",1430524800,2,1336,4.735930735930736
8431767,5,B004J726YS,"Amazon has done a great disservice to this magnificent recording featuring Gutierrez by placing ALL the rave reviews in the wrong place-under the very average Mei DVD of Somnambula. Placing reviews under the wrong DVD is becoming an increasing, careless trend at Amazon, but this is the worst I have seen- virtually all the 10 enthusiastic reviews in the wrong place and only one very lukewarm review under the correct DVD-",1426723200,4,423,4.971830985915493
