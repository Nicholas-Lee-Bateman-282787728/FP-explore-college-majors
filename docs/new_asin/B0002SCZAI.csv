2117563,4,B0002SCZAI,This is a fasinating  and unusual mystery from Britain.  I've seen a lot of mysteries and this strikes me as very original .  I definitely recommend it to fans of film noir.,1237420800,10,173,4.34375
2117564,5,B0002SCZAI,"I love this film! I write mysteries and in my mind this is one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen. I have been trying to find it for about a year after I finally remembered the name ""The Hidden Room"" but had no idea it was also called ""Obsession"". The cat and mouse game between the husband and  the Scotland Yard detective is priceless and the relationship that developes between the husband and his  wife's lover  is so well crafted it is seamless. I saw it years and years ago and it has always remained in the back of my mind. I highly recommend this film.",1198108800,23,578,4.284403669724771
2117565,5,B0002SCZAI,"Obsession is Hitchcockian in it's plot and characters.  It's a Film Noir,
but not really.  A thriller set into a classic love triangle.  You'll never
think of Robert Newton as Long John Silver again!!!",1193616000,,201,4.852941176470588

8031350,5,B0002SCZAI,"Not unlike ""Victim"" which I al have reviewed here,this is a sad black and white late 50s English movie about a cuckhold psychiatrist who's not going to take it anymore, and decides to kidnap his wife's most recent lover.  One of the side interest of this movie is that the psychiatrist takes advantage of parts of London that are still unprepared from the bombings of WWII.  It is not mentioned at all, but part of the story is about the scares of that city that reflect the scares in the main male character, or good doctor.  In this one the doggies doesn't steal the show.",1426809600,,574,4.447619047619048
8031351,4,B0002SCZAI,"Robert Newton, mischievous twinkle in his eye as always, comes home prematurely from a vacation to find his wife with another man (Bill Kronin, played by actor Phil Brown).  It's clear they have something romantic going on, although there is no overt kissing or groping between them.  But Newton overreacts, pulls a gun, and then marches Kronin off and imprisons him in a dank basement room beneath a garage where he parks his car, attaching one of his victim's ankles by a length of chain to the wall.  There he keeps him prisoner for months, bringing him martinis and sandwiches, with the ultimate intent of killing him.  The arch dialogue between Newton and the Kronin character seems to make light of the entire situation, and this weakens the film dramatically.  Kronin seems quite blithe about the whole thing.  Nor does he make any real effort to escape. The film is shot in black and white and ably directed by Edward Dmytryk.  But much of the motivation isn't believable -- it is simply not believable that Newton's wife wouldn't have notified Scotland Yard much earlier when it becomes apparent her paramour has disappeared.  She protests that the publicity and attendant scandal would ruin her, but within the context of what we are given, that hardly seems plausible.  And once Scotland Yard becomes suspicious of Newton, why would they simply not have him tailed, leading them to the imprisoned man?  A more clever twist would have been for Kronin to escape, alert Scotland Yard, and then return to his place of imprisonment, continuing to pretend escape is hopeless.  However, the acting is good, the script is fairly solid, and the closeups of Robert Newton with that mischievous glint in his eye are worth the price of admission.  The screenplay is by Alec Coppel.",1409961600,,1780,4.877076411960133
8031352,5,B0002SCZAI,"Although it is not stated in the film the substance (a liquid) by which Dr Clive Riordan (Robert Newton)intends to depose of a body must be assumed to be an acid. What IS stated in the film by Dr. Riordan is that he has researched a substance that could dissolve human flesh and other tissues that is not corrosive to plumbing (bath, plug, waste piping and so forth).

Amazon are correct in making sketchy reference to the notorious John George Haigh (24 July 1909 - 10 August 1949), whose nefarious acts came to light in the late 1940s: he was executed by hanging on 10 August 1949. The Amazon synopsis makes only passing reference to the acid bath murders, thus: `Riordan intends to kill his victim and dispose of the body in an acid bath (something like this actually did take place in London in the post-war years).' In fact it was acknowledged at the time that the film had its genesis from the Haigh murders.

The film starts off in Riordan's Club with a group of four men (including Riordan) seated around a table. Ronald Adam (playing a minor role for a change as one of the club members) is sounding off about the state of Britain immediate post-war: `We change from a primarily agricultural to an industrial one . . . and what do we do? We pour money down the drain buying foodstuffs from all over the world instead of developing the Empire, with the obvious result. When we have to pay for a war we can't pay for our food.' What a prophetic statement! Riordan is clearly paying little or no attention to these proceedings, his mind is on other matters. The master actor (Newton was most certainly that) portrays his state of mind through subtle facial expression (forget the exaggerated portrayal of Long John Silver for the moment). He is planning a murder!

Riordan's wife is played appropriately and skilfully by Sally Gray (she is wrongly titled Sally Brown on the Case!). There are in fact just four primary characters in this film lasting some 90 minutes, namely Newton, Gray, Phil Brown (Bill Kronin, the potential victim) and Naunton Wayne (Superintendent Finsbury).

Riordan has his surgery some little distance from his home - the geography is a little hazy on this point. (It cannot be too far since his car is kept in a garage nearby.) This is post-war London with bomb damage from the Luftwaffe still much in evidence. From the rear of the garage Riordan has access to a veritable ruined warren in which he has secreted a hideout at a little below ground level that includes a bathroom and a small annexe. Here he will entomb his victim until he has conveyed enough of the corrosive liquid to the bath for the dissolving of the body.

The liquid from his small laboratory is placed in specially prepared rubber hot water bottles carried in a brief case to the hide out on a regular basis lasting several months.

Phil Brown just happens to be Mrs Storm Riordan's latest plaything. The Dr has had enough and seeks to scare his wife into discontinuing her flirtatious practices through innuendo and threat. Naturally he will not admit to disposing of her latest boyfriend in detail but the fact that he had caught the two together at their home (Riordan was supposed to be away at the time) and that he brandishes a revolver which he actually fires off as warning, is enough to convince the lady that her enraged husband means business.

We are not actually shown how Riordan manages to get Bill Kronin into his hideout; this is insignificant compared to the subsequent wearing down of the victim with each of Riordan's visits as he slowly fills the bath in preparation for the ""big day"".

Naunton Wayne is a good choice to play the self-effacing but canny Superintendent Finsbury. Indeed, this is a film that might best be described as a battle of wits. But, we are not strictly accurate in limiting ourselves to just four primary participants; Storm's poodle, named Monty, is pivotal to the entire plot, and at the end it is a man and a dog that we find embracing, not a man and a woman. That makes a nice change, does is not?",1376438400,,4050,4.599722991689751
8031353,5,B0002SCZAI,"I can add very little to what others have written.
It is a very, very good film, with an extremely interesting plot, lots of suspense, nicely delineated characters and brilliant dialogues (characters are well educated, and that shows in their lines).
Some humour -specially on the oddities and mannerisms of the British high class- is also present.
It is to be recommended with no reservations.
***SPOILERS!!!! Stop reading if you have not watched this film. Do not ruin the pleasure for yourself, please.
Just to show how clever I am, a couple of pointers:
The plot concocted by the bad guy to eliminate his rival is too farfetched, too convoluted and too failure prone to be really credible. And the bad guy does not have enough reasons to act like that --he knows his wife's adultery is habitual, so killing one suitor shouldn't make any difference.
Second, the omniscient detective learns too much, too soon from too little evidence; he jumps a too big gun and reaches the right conclusion too easily. The laborious work of a Columbo is largely missing here.
In spite of these flaws, don't miss it.",1288915200,7,1102,4.8052631578947365
8031354,3,B0002SCZAI,"Quite accidently, I stumbled onto this film.  What a great story, and good cast.  A tidy little noir from our English cousins!

But the quality of this DVD is not that impressive. Sharpness and contrast are not the worse I've ever seen; but certainly doesn't look much better than an Alpha release at times.  (Who is WHAM USA, anyway???)

Despite the fact that it is single layered, the DVD offers no extras with the exception of a very lame slide show of images from the film that I suppose are to take the place of genuine stills. Truly a disappointment of a release and a shame as the film is prime noir. The only real incentives to purchase it is the outstanding quality of the film , story and cast, and the fact that it's relatively cheap at the moment.

BUT THIS FILM DESERVES A CLASS ""A"" RELEASE!!!",1258416000,12,806,4.412162162162162
8031355,3,B0002SCZAI,"I kept asking myself - why didn't Bill start a fire to create smoke and alert a rescue? He had everything he needed in his prison: matches, kindling, wood, a bathtub and access to water. Why, Bill? WHY ??",1253750400,,204,4.256410256410256
