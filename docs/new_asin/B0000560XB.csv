8278002,5,B0000560XB,"This step aerobics video (also on DVD) is in 3 parts, each about 20-25 minutes long excluding warmup and cooldown. You can do one, or all the sections. The first section is very fast-paced and aerobically challenging but with fairly simple choreography for an advanced exerciser. The second section is not quite so fast but the choreography definitely requires some practice. The third section is intervals with step and weight work. Christi Taylor is a fabulous instructer with exceptional cueing skills and she is FUN!! She definitely has the best music of any exercise videos I've ever done. She is genuinely enthusiastic and always seems to be having a really good time. I have all of her videos and do one or a combination of two just about every day.",1105315200,,756,4.823076923076923
