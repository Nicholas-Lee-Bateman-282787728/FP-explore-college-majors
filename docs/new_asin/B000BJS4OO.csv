2420685,5,B000BJS4OO,"When times get hard due to uncontrollable circumstances this family celebrates life! ""Mr. Christmas"" is a timeless motion picture for all ages. This story opens both the mind and heart.",1151020800,14,185,5.2
2420686,3,B000BJS4OO,This movie is really enjoyable. Children will definitely love this movie. It is fully entertaining and a family movie.,1150675200,5,118,5.2631578947368425
2420687,5,B000BJS4OO,"A wonderful and heartwarming story that pays great attention to the detail of the time period along with a real plot!! Great story for the whole family!! Entertaining and educational, it is one of the few I can watch with the kids over and over that is as fun for me as it is for them.",1150588800,14,285,4.107142857142857
2420688,5,B000BJS4OO,"This was a wonderful family movie that will touch your heart.  We have watched it over and over, as have several people I know.  The story is beautifully written, heartwarming and inspiring and the shots of Eureka Springs are lovely.  It is truly a movie for all ages.",1150416000,15,268,4.541666666666667
2420689,3,B000BJS4OO,"Although this was a sweet story and the children were wonderful, the adult actors were stilted and wooden in their acting.",1137283200,16,122,4.857142857142857
2420690,1,B000BJS4OO,"This movie is obviously done by a local town theater.  The voices fade in and out and the only ""decent"" actor in the whole bunch is the little girl.  It's not worth the money.",1136592000,9,175,4.117647058823529
2420715,2,B000BJS4OO,"Oh dear! What a dull film. The label says 'Winner, Best feature film for kids', and 'This heart-warming film will be a Holiday classic'; clearly both written by the production company in an attempt to promote this very poor film! Having endured it, it's almost a misrepresentation!  Not a 'good buy', just 'good-bye'!",1416700800,,317,4.981132075471698

2420717,5,B000BJS4OO,This was a beautiful heart-warming holiday movie. The quality of the disc was excellent. A++,1410998400,,92,5.2
2420718,2,B000BJS4OO,"IF YOU're an adult you will need plenty of Eggnog to get through this depressing, uninspired Christmas story.  I can't imagine that little kids will enjoy it either as most of the story focuses on the $23 needed to buy a small two wheeled little girl's bike.  Kids will probably not connect with that unless they're living in a homeless shelter.",1408665600,,345,4.639344262295082
2420719,3,B000BJS4OO,"Mr. Christmas is a sweet and tear jerking film about a young family celebrating Christmas in 1941.  Times are hard for the young Carter family and they only get harder as World War II has pulled into full swing.  They do all they can though, to share a wonderful Christmas with their children.

Carol Lee the eldest child (who maybe was 5 on my guess) and her sister Babby are excited about the arrival of ""Santa's Catalog"" (I remember similar feelings about the Sear's catalog when I was a child).  Mom and dad are stunned by the cost of everything in the catalog and try desperately to steer Carol Lee away from her number one Christmas wish, a bicycle.  Dad also desperately tries to figure out how he can grant that one wish while mom tries to make it clear to dad that sometimes, you get what you can and be happy with it.

Mr. Christmas is a sweet and brief Christmas story.  It made us laugh and made us a little teary eyed as well.
It is definitely family friendly.",1387929600,5,973,4.342541436464089
2420720,5,B000BJS4OO,Great shot movie. Touching. The actors were all very good. I like that it is old fashion. Family must see.,1375228800,,106,4.35
2420721,1,B000BJS4OO,"I primarily purchased this film because it was filmed on the same street that I have a house in Eureka Springs.  I think the premise of the story is good, it has a weak ending though.  The production is hampered by poor character development, and the child actors were annoying.",1354492800,2,278,4.54
2420722,4,B000BJS4OO,"This movie arrived quickly and in fine condition.  While the acting wasn't great, the story was simple and sweet; something the entire family could watch and learn a valuable lesson from.",1326153600,,187,5.032258064516129
2420723,5,B000BJS4OO,"I saw this movie on PBS and absolutely loved it! This movie will definitely become one on my ""Must See"" films for the Holidays!
My heart went out to the parents trying to give their children a wonderful Christmas on a very limited budget (something most of today's parents no nothing about.) And I fell in love with the oldest daughter. She was a joy throughout the movie.
While the movie was made on a small budget (nothing at all like ""White Christmas,"" which I also love...who doesn't love Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney? And the costumes are fabulous!) it has a charm of its own and the ending of Mr. Christmas was quite a surprise and perfect.
I recommended this to everyone of all ages.",1231027200,,694,4.515873015873016
2420724,5,B000BJS4OO,"I was lucky enough to catch this gem on my local PBS station shortly before Christmas. After watching it I got online and was happy to see that it is available on DVD. I ordered it and watched it a second time. This is a great Chritmas movie that the whole family can enjoy over and over again anytime. It's not a complicated story. The acting is well done, not over done. I really like the director's commentary and outtakes that were part of the Special Features section.

This is a great movie to have in your library.",1230508800,,521,4.316326530612245
2420735,5,B000BJS4OO,"I just saw this movie. It is so beatiful. I can watch it over and over again. The children and parents are such wonderful actors. I love the sincerity, simplicity, and love they express. I believe those we have written negative reviews have no clue what it means to expereince the financial hardship they were faced with, and efforts some parents make to give their children truly awesome gifts that are priceless. I will recommend this movie. It is excellent.",1198540800,,460,4.7625
2420736,4,B000BJS4OO,"I haven't seen this. I bought for my mom. She wanted it because it was made in Eureka Springs, AR. She said that it was short and sweet. Not awful, but not great!!",1169769600,,163,3.9696969696969697
2420737,2,B000BJS4OO,"This story, with its nostalgia-evoking setting and charming premise, could make a holiday staple, but the level of acting will not allow that.  To be sure, there is a valid point in the assertion of the ""A for Effort"" reviewer, but on the other hand, no amount of allowance for production constraints can gloss over the reality that the actors cannot convince the viewer of anything more than the fact that they are reciting their lines.

It's a nice story and the costumes and sets are commendable, but it can't sincerely deliver its message when the acting leaves the characters devoid of authenticity.",1169683200,,604,4.854368932038835
2420738,4,B000BJS4OO,"I was disappointed in the several reviewers here and at the IMDb site who criticized this cute little movie for being what it is. Talk about Grinches. The movie is only 56 minutes long, clearly a local production made in a small town in the Ozark foothills of Arkansas. To criticize it for lacking the production values of ""Miracle on 34th Street"" is like comparing your child's dance recital with the Kirov Ballet.

I loved the two little girls who reminded me of my own grand-daughters. They appear only about 4 and 5, an age where they have the attention span of butterflies. They are clearly more little girls than actresses. There is a wonderful blooper sequence that shows the director's difficulties in trying to keep them focused. Very funny.

The elder, Ireland Rose Maddox dearly wants a bike for Christmas. But it is Christmas 1941, just after the attack on Pearl Harbor. And dad's job at a local print shop is too low paying to allow buying a new bike costing over $24. This simple problem forms the plot.

My only real criticism is that the Production Notes on the DVD are unreadable. Too bad. I would have liked to know the background for the story and why and how it was made.

Nonetheless, this is a cute little movie, well worth the price.",1169251200,10,1256,4.568888888888889
2420739,5,B000BJS4OO,A great movie for those who would like to see items from the 40's to remind us of when we were growing up.  A wholesome movie for all to see.,1168300800,2,141,3.7
2420740,1,B000BJS4OO,"This movie was all costumes (which were marvelous), and no well-developed plot or convincing acting.  I love Christmas movies of all kinds, and was expecting to have my heart warmed at least somewhat, but everything except the costumes was terrible...bad acting, stilted dialogue, inadequate direction, and poor editing.  I watched it in slack-jawed dismay...it seems that something could have been made of it, but every line of dialogue, facial expression, ""plot twist"", and lingering shot was misdirected.  I was very ready to enjoy this, but was completely unable to.",1167436800,9,570,5.382022471910112
2420741,4,B000BJS4OO,"""Mr. Christmas"" deserves kudos.  A simple little story set in a not-so-simple time.  Christmas 1941 in Eureka Springs, Arkansas.  My mother-in-law was a child just 50 miles from Eureka Springs in the 1940's.  I guarantee that this film is a visual delight.  The costumes are incredibly authentic... The girls' coats and hats were perfect.  The set design and props were authentic, right down to the metal jug used to hold cleaning solution for the printing press.  The stores have that stripped down, functional no-fuss look true to the depression era.  My mother-in-law has told me many stories about living in poverty in Arkansas, always told with a smile on her face and a wistful look in her eye.  After seeing this production, I better understand why.  I'm going to surprise her with a copy.",1167264000,5,796,4.873134328358209
2420742,4,B000BJS4OO,If you have expectations of a major Christmas production you won't be pleased with this one but Mr. Christmas is worth seeing for what it is.  It's a small simple story set in a simpler time (during WWII) about a family with two children and the financial difficulties they face in providing their children a decent Christmas.  Uplifting ending.,1166918400,5,345,4.830508474576271
2420743,1,B000BJS4OO,"I love christmas movies of all kinds and will watch ANYTHING christmas, but I couldn't even finish this I was so bored.  I suppose one day I'll stick it in the dvd player again and finish it, but it looks like a home movie/high school play that someone taped at home.  Plot isn't much either, I understand they didn't have money, but I kept waiting for something to happen, instead of seeing that fact reiterated over and over again.  My favorite xmas movies are White Christmas and the old version of Miracle on 34th street, so I was really hoping this would be something similiar.  I was wrong.",1164672000,20,596,4.4907407407407405
2420744,1,B000BJS4OO,I really hated this movie regretted even buying it. I didn't feel that it was authentic to the period at all. I also thought it looked more like local play instead of a movie!!! Don't waste your time and money,1164153600,9,209,4.25
8087478,5,B000BJS4OO,I remember watching it at Christmas time an all the time I wanted to record this on VCR. Something would happen every time so when I found it on DVD had to order it.,1520467200,,165,3.8823529411764706
8087479,5,B000BJS4OO,"Wonderful family Christmas film which many can relate to. Showcases authentic buildings, automobiles, clothing, and so forth, from the 1940s era. Filmed in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. We loved it and hope you will too!",1514505600,,216,5.382352941176471
8087480,5,B000BJS4OO,Great Christmas film with a classic story and message.  Wonderful production value and I really enjoy watching every year around the holidays!,1513641600,,142,5.454545454545454
8087481,5,B000BJS4OO,"What a wonderful film!  I loved it, as did the many people I gave it to as a gift, when it was first released.  It's a family favorite, watched time and again as Christmas draws near.  Set in the 40's, the film maker recreated the authenticity of that era, in every scene.  The plot is easy to follow,  as the story unfolds, but if you think you've predicted the ending....think again!  You'll be surprised!!  Great job, Beth Brickell, on another AWARD winning movie!",1513468800,,467,4.554216867469879
8087482,5,B000BJS4OO,Really touching.  Beautifully filmed.  Makes you feel you're right back there in the past.  Recommend for families with small children!,1513382400,,135,5.65
8087483,5,B000BJS4OO,Found this movie last year while flipping channels and fell in love. Its a little film and a little story with actors I don't recognized. But it has heart and the Christmas spirit. And the little girls are adorable! What else do you need for a happy Christmas?,1449187200,,260,4.4375
8087484,5,B000BJS4OO,This is one of my very favorite movies! I just love the way they ade Christmas special even with just a little money and lots of love.,1445385600,,134,4.0
8087485,5,B000BJS4OO,"This is an excellent depression era movie, brings back many memories.  Even though it was the depression, the memories of that time are priceless and this movies brings them all back.",1424822400,,183,4.903225806451613
8087486,1,B000BJS4OO,"It looks like it was shot on a cell phone camera. There is no real conflict and feels like a ""gee weren't things so ideal in the past?"" movie. The acting, writing, and production were laughable and the ending made no sense. It's not quaint, it's just terrible.",1419379200,,260,4.4375
8087487,5,B000BJS4OO,Heart warming Christmas movie for the entire family. Loved it.,1417046400,,62,5.3
