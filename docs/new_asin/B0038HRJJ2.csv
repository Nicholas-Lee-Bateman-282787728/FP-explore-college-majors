8453769,5,B0038HRJJ2,"I watched this lady when I lived in San Francisco in the 80s and she was on tv every weekday morning at around 6:30am. When I started exercising with her I had a huge abdomen and after a while, I remember getting down on my hands and knees one morning while exercising with her and found that my stomach was no longer sagging to the floor. Joanie makes exercising fun. She engages your conscious mind talking about in and everything; while taking your physical being through excercises that target every area of the body. I'm hoping I can get more of her CDs. It's too bad her program is not on anymore. During the time her exercise program was on tv,I had co-workers who watched her program, not to do the excercises, but to hear her talk. Her wonderful personality makes you feel like you're exercising with a good friend and her exercises will firm and trim your body in just 30 minutes a day. I have tried other exercise regimens but no one gets me going like Joanie. I had stopped exercising, but lately decided I needed to get back in shape. So I tried other CDs and they were good but they didn't get me motivated and I thought about Joanie and found there are CDs of her Morning Stretch Program and she even has a website. I'm hoping that more of her Morning Stretch programs will be on CD.",1285372800,10,1298,4.367768595041323
