7554317,5,B018RSPWLI,"I saw this film at the Human Rights Watch festival in New York a few years ago. It is a beautiful and moving film about the lives of gay and lesbian people in Cameroon. It is heartbreaking to watch what they have to struggle against, yet inspiring to see the courage that they are showing. The main characters are fascinating to watch and each one so different from the others. They are full of life with hopes and dreams that they have no way of knowing whether they can realize or not. It gave me a whole new perspective on Africa and what the actual attitudes of people are there and also seeing how strong the human spirit is.
The cinematography, editing and story telling are all top notch. I hope many people get to see this film now that it is out on DVD. I'm looking forward to seeing it again.",1450310400,2,802,4.282894736842105

7554320,5,B018RSPWLI,"If you want to feel the lives of gay and lesbian people who must express love and oftentimes even laughter in secret, yet leave know that hope lives in our simplest interactions, watch this film. It is gentle, yet gripping. I have seen it several times and each time I am drawn in as if it were the first.

Dramatic, but without a hint of contrivance, Born this Way shows us that even in Cameroon, where love can frequently results in a five-year prison sentence, people care for each other, laugh, cry and carry on with dignity.

Buy it, because you'll watch it often. And each time, you'll leave thinking, hoping and caring more than you did before.",1450224000,2,651,4.508474576271187
7554321,5,B018RSPWLI,This was a really moving film which introduced me to a lot of issues in international LGBT community.  Watching it I felt really lucky that each of the people profiled allowed us to share in and learn from their story.  It was inspiring!,1450224000,2,237,4.488372093023256
7554322,5,B018RSPWLI,A beautiful film that seamlessly weaves two narratives together.  It avoids voiceovers in favor of simply experiencing their lives along with them as it unfolds.

7554324,5,B018RSPWLI,"This film is emotionally raw and beautiful. The subject matter is explored organically through personal stories and experience, and the narrative is both intense and lyrical. I recommend it to anyone interested in LGBT rights, Africa, documentary film, or anyone who wants to see an emotionally and visually compelling story.",1449792000,2,325,5.52

8742806,5,B018RSPWLI,"Haunting and lovely. The filmmakers were brave to take on this project (looks like it might have been dangerous to all involved), but the result is inspiring and educational. Makes me want to run out and vote for good people running for office in the USA (local, state, and federal elections).",1451952000,,293,4.764705882352941
8742807,5,B018RSPWLI,"Edgy, heart-warming and consistently feeling like I'm listening into someone's conversation.

8742808,5,B018RSPWLI,Born This Way is a wonderfully shot film with poignant subject matter that strikes at the heart of acceptance. The director has really captured the essence of what it is to be born the way you are and the challenge of living true to that in society that is built on conformity. This is a beautiful story and an enjoyable ride to watch. I highly recommend it.,1451347200,3,358,4.358208955223881
8742809,5,B018RSPWLI,"I honestly wasn't sure what to expect when I watched this. As a straight, white man in California, I probably couldn't be more different from the LGBT Cameroonians in the film. But I came away feeling like we're the same in so many ways - how we love and want to be safe and want to be ourselves and how we still laugh even when things are difficult.",1451088000,7,350,4.161764705882353
8742810,5,B018RSPWLI,"This movie sheds light on an important and raw humanitarian crisis occurring in Cameroon, but the greatest gift of the movie lies in the personal courage it depicts. The bravery witnessed in the movie is hard-earned and genuinely inspiring. The characters' fears are palpable, but so is their hope and vitality as they begin to navigate life as openly gay and lesbian men and women. The filmmaking is touched with moments of spontaneous beauty and wonder, and the story that unfolds is gripping from start to finish.",1450656000,3,516,4.942528735632184
8742811,5,B018RSPWLI,"Born This Way is one of those rare films where it feels as if we are eavesdropping on the private conversations of people we wouldn't otherwise have known.  Two young and brave directors shot this film guerrilla style to introduce us to Cedric and Gertrude and their fear, joy and hope.  You will love their courage and you will love them.",1450310400,3,339,4.540983606557377
8742812,5,B018RSPWLI,What an important and brave film!  The stories of gay people in Cameroon are so powerful and beautifully filmed.  I've watched it three times and each time discover another facet of the lives followed by the filmmakers.,1450310400,2,219,4.891891891891892
