6042844,5,B00G0PXTZC,"The only reason I considered passing up this purchase is that I had this feeling that I've seen all the knockouts. WRONG. This Has epic knockouts from the UFC, WEC, Pride, and Strikeforce. The very first knockout is intense and brutal and shocking and thats exactly what i wanted to see. From there on it just gets better and better. Its 2.5 hours of knockouts! Its pretty much the ultimate mixed martial arts highlight reel. You won't regret owning this.",1405209600,4,455,4.7
6042845,5,B00G0PXTZC,Best compilation of mma knockouts that I have ever seen.  The first 90 knockouts are fast and straight to the point for the most part with interviews with fighters every 8 fights or so.  The top ten really shows more of the fight before the knockout and briefly discusses them.  If you are a ufc fan this is a must,1403481600,,314,4.2
6042846,4,B00G0PXTZC,This DVD gives you the knockout without all the unnecessary stuff. it is concise and exciting. really enjoyed the knockouts.,1397779200,,124,5.25
6042847,5,B00G0PXTZC,"This is possibly the best ufc DVD ever, non stop action, even a non ufc/mma fan will like this. 5 stars.",1397606400,,104,4.0
6042848,5,B00G0PXTZC,"UFC finally does it right. Opens up their vaults and puts the best 100 KO's from UFC, Strikeforce, WEC, Affliction on one disc.  Covers up to Aug/2013. So yes you get the Weidman KO of Anderson Silva in HD.

Also, you get the Fedor KO from Afflicition2 in true 1080p.  Amazing picture. Affliction broadcast both of their PPV in 1080p whereas the UFC and Strikeforce would do 1080i.  Like others have said, I would like to see more UFC event Blu rays. Dont most people own blu ray players.",1393891200,4,488,4.449438202247191
6042849,5,B00G0PXTZC,I have given it 5 star's because it is a good compilation which I enjoyed  when I watched it on TV. What I can't understand is that 4 of the 5 pictures on the Blu-ray cover are of fights which aren't on the countdown. I just hope they are included as extras or this is false advertising.,1386288000,,287,4.035087719298246
6042850,5,B00G0PXTZC,"This was a 4-part special hosted by Jon Anik that aired on FOX Sports 1 in late 2013, which counted down the top 100 knockouts in the UFC's 20 year history.  This includes fights from not only the UFC, but also Pride, Strikeforce, WEC, and Affliction!  Unlike the previous knockouts compilation releases, these fights were not chosen at random and many even feature interviews from the fighters involved.  There are also several honorable mention K.O.s that didn't make the top 100 but are featured here as a bonus.  These are not the full fights but rather the final minutes of each fight leading to the knockout.  Yes, there will be repeats from the previous K.O. releases, but you're also getting a lot more that have not been released on video or seen in years.  Now granted, even with 100 knockouts, there will still be those who quibble over omissions.  But this is still the most comprehensive collection of its kind released to date.  For those who like watching knockouts, you can't go wrong with the 158 minutes of footage here, which is a vast improvement over the previous K.O. releases that are usually 1 hour each.  This compilation, along with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fighting-for-a-Generation-20-Years-of-the-UFC/dp/B00GOYC3GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fighting for a Generation: 20 Years of the UFC</a>&nbsp;documentary, and worthy additions to any fight fan's library.

6042851,3,B00G0PXTZC,"Theres been what 60-70 events since the last KO compilation more than enough for 2 new all ufc compilations but Leave it to the ufc to rip its patrons again by releasing another useless compilation with a few ko's 23 from other orgs rather than put out a proper ultimate ko's #10,11 and another ultimate submissions.
How about releasing some of the strikeforce and wec events in their entirety or at least some best of editions?

This is just greedy charging for a tv show.

Main gripe is that ufc still doesn't put out blu-ray editions unless its for some generally useless compilation, or tv special.

It doesn't flow as good as it could. There are too many TKO's it should be just pure out like a light toe curling ko's. And again you see the Dana White touch in adding both of Liddells tko's of Couture high on the list.

Big Daddies horrifically insane yet satisfying tacofying (sic) of Herrera's head with eight consecutive 2x4 breaking elbow strikes in 2 seconds is at #97? Wrong, that's top ten of all time right there!

Also, some of these fighters are suffering from shot brain syndrome right now, and since the ufc is profiting yet again from their trauma, it would be nice if ufc used SOME of the profits from top 100 KO's and just send the poor ko victims $5-10,000 each, except for Couture, Lindland, and Fedor.",1385856000,,1325,4.550420168067227
