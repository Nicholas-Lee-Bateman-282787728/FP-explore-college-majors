8157619,1,B000KJU12I,"I love ravens with white feathers on their backs. Poe must have turned in his grave after this trash was released. Dark and gloomy - true to Poe, but how many plots? Was this really more than one movie? The acting could have been a lot better. Do you want to see a movie focused more on constant stabbings? Watch equally bad, ""I Spit on your Grave."" This was difficult to follow due to the plot(s) and bad acting. I love E. A. Poe, but this was simply a horrible attempt to re-create his work. Absolutely no redeeming value.",1377561600,,524,4.303030303030303
8157620,2,B000KJU12I,"How fitting for a woman named Lenore to have vivid, recurring dreams of Edgar Allan Poe reciting lines from a certain famous poem about a certain black bird. But what's all this hooey of forewarning Lenore of an evil bald man she'll have to kill in the future? She has no time for all that, what with being the lead singer of an all girl band whose music can be best described as ""gothic pop"". Of course, the serial killer slicing and dicing his way around town may make our wanna-be rock star change her tune. Yes. The killer (aptly named Skinner) is bald. The movie itself, not surprisingly, is bird crap. It's visually impressive, but way too surreal and dreamlike for my taste. The constant imagery is not unlike, say, a flashback scene on a CSI episode. Only instead of 2 or 3 minutes with this type of presentation, it's 80 minutes. Ulli Lommel, what happened to you? You're a far cry from films like The Boogeyman (1980), heck, even The Devonsville Terror. As always, with the exception of the '35 and '63 ""adaptations"", read the poem instead. 3.5/10",1289952000,,1057,4.568421052631579
8157621,3,B000KJU12I,"Ulli Lommel's The Raven is about a girl who has psychic link to a serial killer.  She longs for the days when her grandfather (Ulli Lommel) used to read her ghost stories and her favorite was The Raven.  She looks at Ravens as an omen of pending doom and one of awe.  But this gory and tragic tale as all too much like an Edgar Allen Poe
story; dark, gloomy and tragic.  A low budget DTV film that's quite interesting, it's for Ulli Lommel fans and those who like to see something different.",1233187200,,491,4.247311827956989
8157622,1,B000KJU12I,"Thinking that this might be a modern retelling of Edgar Allen Poe's classic tale ""The Raven"", and seeing two very positive reviews, I almost bought this DVD (For 1.99 used at Hollywood Video - not 23.99 new at Amazon).

Fortunately, I decided to also check the title on the Internet Movie Database where it had ""User Rating: 1.4/10 (252 votes)."" When Amazon shows ""More Buying Choices 72 used & new from $0.63"" under the ""Add to Shopping Cart"" button, I knew this DVD must be a real turkey.

Also, the product description has ""DVD Release Date: February 6, 2007"" but the two positive reviews were written on April 8, 2006 and January 3, 2007 so these reviews could not have been for this DVD.",1211587200,2,692,4.57258064516129
8157623,1,B000KJU12I,"Being an Edgar Allen Poe fan I rented this trash because the title is Edgar Allen Poe's, The Raven.  The movie starts with a girl, named Lenoore, killing her rapist by throwing a blow dryer in the tub with him.  The rest of the movie is everyone who seems to be associated with the girl including her dentist being stalked and killed by this guy who has evidently resurrected for some unexplained reason.  Sound like Edgar Allen Poe to you?  Let's move on from the plot to everything else.  Terrible acting, lighting, and sound.  No entertainment value whatsoever.  Not even so bad it's good or funny.  Just bad.  I rented it but wanted to burn it just in case some other poor sucker made the same mistake.",1185840000,6,706,4.496062992125984
