I was purchasing music CDs from a favorite site of mine. I needed to fill in the order to reach the minimum for free shipping. I saw this 2-DVD set for a ridiculously low price and thought ""What the heck?..it's better than paying for shipping.""

While I had no high hopes for the show, I found myself pleasantly surprised. It was well conceived, edited and presented. This was not a cheap venue to make a mockery of gay marriage, but a real look into what the couples went through as they planned their (not-yet-legal) marriages; including all the ups and down not only with each other, but also with their families. Really, the hurdles are the same as any marriage that is considered not ""normal"", as in mixed race or mixed religion. There will always be family members that are upset, or confused, or - gladly - thrilled that their relative has found love in their life.

This was filmed in 2002, so as tame as the concept of gay marriage might seem now, in 2016, these folks were helping to lead the way. It took courage to let their experiences play out for the world to see. I think it is still valid viewing, especially for younger couples considering marriage.

If the subject of gay marriage interests you at all, this is a film worth watching.

OK - I will vent here a bit: The younger female couple hired a spiritual adviser/wedding planner. I kept wondering when the girls would see through her scam. They finally did...but dealt with it in good humor.",1483833600,,1492,4.511111111111111

8017293,5,B0001WTWMO,"Ten years ago my daughter and I watched ""Gay Weddings."" Every Monday night one of us would yell, ""Gay Weddings is on!!!!"" By the end of the series we had built a relationship with these couples and felt such sympathy for them. I hate the sin but love the sinner.....this series was a true reflection of what they had to go through to make their relationship real in other's eyes....I was so excited to get this 480 minutes of entertainment......worth 100 times more than the 1.76 plus shipping that I paid for it...what a bargain!!!",1294012800,,532,4.610526315789474

8017295,5,B0001WTWMO,"My girlfriend and I rented this while we were planning our own ceremony.  We were hoping to get a few tips.  Watching the show we got more entertainment value than practical tips but I would still recommend it.

For me, the most entertaining and touching ceremony was also the one with the smallest budget.  The couple seemed to have so much enthusiasm and tenderness for one another that they could have pledged their lives in an empty room and I'd have cried watching it.

If we got any tips from this movie they would be

- If you fight through out the planning stage, you'll fight afterward.

- Even if legal rights are not attached to the ceremony, it's worth it.

- Don't let some lunatic with a conch shell be your officiant.",1137369600,4,732,4.451127819548872
8017296,5,B0001WTWMO,"I rented this DVD thinking it was some sort of independent film offering from some obscure film festival.  I was, initially, disappointed to find out I had gotten hold of a ""reality show"" about gay weddings.  However, I gave it a try and after watching the first episode I found that this program was cleverly formulated to show four gay couples from different backgrounds and different social standings (you know what I mean).  It's a given that any wedding has a abnormal amount of stress associated with it and while there is enough of it on display here, this show does not play to those negitive aspects.  Instead, GAY WEDDINGS take the whole wedding experience to the next level by showing what gay couples have to contend with from the planning stages, family and friends and ultimately each other.  As it turns out, gay couples have just as much anxiety as straight couples when it comes to putting yourself and your loved one out on display (as what a ""wedding"" essentially does).  Of course, since gay marriages are illegal, GAY WEDDINGS finds it purpose in not campaigning for legalizing gay marriages, but centering your attention on the true meaning of ""the union"".  After I finished watching the entire eight episodes and all the extras, there is nothing but the ""piece of paper"" missing from these REAL marriages.  This film/DVD is so intimate that you can't help but get caught up in the ride and feel all the emotions that each couple has during their journey to the alter.  Fantastic and fun.  5*****",1093219200,,1518,4.759541984732825
