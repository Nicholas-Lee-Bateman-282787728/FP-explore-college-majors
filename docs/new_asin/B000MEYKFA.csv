8306619,5,B000MEYKFA,"This is independent film-making in it's purest form.  A guy has a vision and decides to write, direct, and pay for it (mostly) by himself.

These are funny, unique short films starring people you may actually know from TV, HBO, major movies and stand-up comedy!

And for you sci-fi fans, you get to see Forry Ackerman and the inside of his house!  Yay!

C'mon!  It's got scary donuts, hilarious peanut posters, a crazy clown car, red t-shirts, and leprechaun poo!  If all that doesn't say ""entertainment"", I don't know what does!
