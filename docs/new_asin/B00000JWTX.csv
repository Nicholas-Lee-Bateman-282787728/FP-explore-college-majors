7913560,5,B00000JWTX,"A very peaceful calm yoga, that gets the job done , with the atmosphere of Mt McKinley  and the majesty of Dania in Alaska.",1445212800,,123,4.125
7913561,5,B00000JWTX,"This DVD contains two sets of Kundalini Yoga (the late Yogi Bhajan's system), that are relatively easy-to-do and relaxing. The instructor, Nirvair Singh Khalsa, taught yoga at the University of Alaska for many years. He is an American Sikh convert, so he wears a turban and has a long beard. Although his appearance might be considered exotic, his manner of teaching is quite straightforward and down to earth. The set is a TV studio with a large painting of Denali in the background. Besides the instructor, there are three students in the class. One demonstrates modifications of the potentially more challenging exercises.

Both sets open and close in the same way. They open with three tune-in mantras and a set of warm up stretching exercises that go up the body from feet to head. They end with tense and release exercises and a body scan meditation done in savasana, and the projected healing mantra (or ""Sunshine Song""). This is typical of most Kundalini Yoga classes.

The first set is a spinal series that lasts for 26 minutes and includes spinal rolls, flexes and twists, shoulder ""teeter totters"", rolls and neck rolls. Brief rests are taken between some exercises. A meditation that synchronizes long, slow, deep breathing with an internal ""Sat Nam"" mantra is included.

The second set is a ""transformational series"" that takes 40 minutes. This includes extended leg stretch, cross crawl (alternate side leg and arm lifts), spine rolls and flexes, baby pose, half spinal twist, crunches, pelvic raises (bridge pose), and spinal twists. A meditation that synchronizes turning the head from side to side with the breath and the Wahe Guru mantra, and a breathing exercise that uses a four part inhale with long slow exhales are also included.

The DVD was originally a video tape from the 1990s. It does have a menu to allow one to skip to either of the two sets. Nothing fancy, just good yoga sets that are not too intense, and should be accessible to most people. I've enjoyed all of the several DVDs that I've seen from this teacher.",1407628800,,2046,4.870689655172414
7913562,5,B00000JWTX,"I appreciate this DVD, I had the VHS and loved it so much I wanted the DVD, It helps my back and is a fairly easy yoga practice.",1380672000,,128,3.607142857142857
7913563,5,B00000JWTX,"This video will definitely help you relax!  I alternate between this video, his Kundalini Yoga (K.Y.) for Relaxation II (which offers a more intense workout), Chakra Yoga by Gurutej Kaur (great video), and K. Y. by Gurmukh (great video but I threw out my back twice doing this one, so be careful-- I'm very fit and had also been doing back exercises for years before doing this tape).  Nirvair Singh Khalsa is an excellent instructor.  Another great thing about this tape is that there are 2 classes, one is approx. 26 minutes and the other is 42 minutes.  I'm going to purchase his whole 12-volume series on K. Y.",1052006400,3,614,4.605504587155964
7913564,5,B00000JWTX,"I am thrilled and delighted to see this video here.  I have bought several copies over the years (they have either been taped over or borrowed).. initially I got it because I did not want to go out in the cold and dark winter night to go to the high school night class.. Boy, was I glad I did.. I got into a routine at one point of doing a session either every morning.. or every evening before bed.  I stopped going to a chiropractor because I didn't need to after doing these routines for quite awhile.  Of course, all you people who are in pretty good shape and love challenges may find this to be a wimpy tape, but for those who feel challenged by backaches and stiffness of everyday life, may find this to be a great relief. I know I did...  I also just picked up Gurmukh's Kundalini Yoga video. She teaches in LA.  Oh my, what a contrast from the Alaska scenery..from cool to warm...her video was filmed in Maui..looks like you're in a lush jungle clearing.. She encourages you to have a go at this, no matter what your ability.  And it's true, even if you are barely moving when you start, you will make progress, little by little.  Go for it.. Get both videos! Truly money well spent *o*

Update(Feb'10)- The pix on here is the actually the cover off the VHS tape (which i still have somewhere, now i have the dvd too).
And yes, you can still get this on his website kundaliniyogadotnet for twenty bucks and five for shipping.
p.s. for the person who associated kundalini yoga with fire breathing, hey, the key in this set is relaxation.  When you're super hyper and need to wind down, you really don't need fire breath for that (though you can find it in other videos on amazon).  Kundalini yoga covers a huge array of exercises.. this one is aimed at relaxation.",1047081600,3,1772,4.375
7913565,4,B00000JWTX,"First of all, this is like no other yoga tape.  At first I thought - No!  But it did leave me feeling good.
OK, so the instructor is rather deadpan and monotone, I kept looking for a change of expression.  But when I did part 2, I managed to ignore that.  There's a bit of mantra chanting, which is new to me, but is apparently helpful in mellowing out the brainwaves or something - and it did seem to work.  The format is wierd to me though, I am used to flows, and this is NOT flow.  Both workouts start off with simple stretches of all parts of the body, held for about 5 seconds each. Then crossed leg sitting cat back, and rotations at the waist.  Then relaxation.  That's part 1.  Part 2 is the same but includes longer held floor poses which are more what I'm used to - such as bridge.  This bridge though goes up and down quite speedily for about a minute.  At the end of both relaxations, you sing a song dedicating the way you feel to someone you love.  And partway thru both sections, there's more mantra work.
So - this is definitely NOT for those who don't like woo-woo stuff.  I don't mind it, so long as the effect is right:)  Can't imagine doing this practice with anyone around though!
Oh - one more thing - I thought the whole thing about Kundalini was the breathing, Breathe of Fire, specifically.  There's no mention of it in this tape - there is one small section where you are instructed to sniff the breathe in 5 sniffs and and exhale forcibly, but that's it.
Hope my review helps.... BTW, part 1 - around 30 minutes, part 2, around 40.",1046390400,12,1559,4.237288135593221
7913566,5,B00000JWTX,"If you want a challenging workout, this yoga practice is probably not for you.  But if your joints are stiff, if you have a lot of stress, if you feel tired and depressed, this may be just the thing.  I did it only a few times and suddenly noticed that life was strangely more cheerful than it had been.  The breathing and the stretch, the back series and the transformation series, calm me down, make me alert and just a little more detached if I've been obsessing or distressing myself.  Nirvair Singh Khalsa's light humorous rap gives a bridge to the mind while the body is engaged.  The music is important, the mantras are important, the breathing is vital.  A practice you can live with.",1024704000,12,692,4.496
7913567,5,B00000JWTX,Nirvair Sing Khalsa is an outstanding kundalini Yoga teacher that takes the student of yoga in a very user friendly and kind journey. A simple tape that produces amazing energizing and relaxing effects on the user. Do not deprive yourself of this experience of deep relaxation health benefits and the feeling of well being that Kundalini yoga produces.,1000857600,2,352,5.086206896551724
7913568,1,B00000JWTX,"I thought this video was a total disappointment!  It mentioned a ""beautiful natural footage of Alaska's majestic Mt. McKinley"".  Although it did show brief segments of Mt. McKinley, the actual background had a black wall with a PICTURE of Mt. McKinley in the background!  I also thought the stretches shown were done too quickly and moved too fast.  I believe the description of the video was deceptive and I am truly disappointed with the entire video.",992390400,11,453,4.921052631578948
7913569,5,B00000JWTX,"The best video I've seen that provides concise information along with do-able exercises.  Contains 2 sets of classes -- one for the beginner (about 30 minutes long) and one for the slightly more advanced (about 40  minutes long).  Both classes have explanations, stretching, exercises, and  meditations.  There's also info on how to modify the exercises if you have  back problems (which I do).  After doing yoga with the gentle Nirvair Singh  Khalsa (who teaches yoga at University of Alaska), I feel relaxed, healthy  and in love with life!",961718400,34,542,5.068181818181818
