8417871,3,B00478IT7M,OK for what I paid for it.  There are better videos on China steam out there,1432252800,,76,3.75
8417872,2,B00478IT7M,"This is absolutely ruined by the constant narration and music. The narrator must have said 50 times, fifty different ways how steam is disappearing and this is your last chance to see it. He also seems to think his prose is high falutin. I wanted to hear the engines since that's what is disappearing, remember? The quality of the video is top notch altho there is some shaky stuff that's hard on the eyes. The scenes of everyday China in the 21st century are also very eye-opening. Drop the narration and music and it's 5 star.",1383782400,2,528,4.510416666666667
8417873,5,B00478IT7M,"For decades now the Chinese government has been telling anyone who asked that they were no longer using steam locomotives,...

and they were always lying, but if you go to China in the very near future, ask that same question, and get that same answer, they just might be telling you the truth because steam IS vanishing from China at an astonishing rate, and filmmaker John Agnew just happened to be in the right place at the right time to capture steam's last hurrah in its last refuge.  This show contains 60 minutes of gorgeously shot footage and informative narration (plus ten minutes of extra un-narrated unused footage) about what John and crew saw in China.  Except for the occasional secret policemen trying to figure out what these western ""spies"" were REALLY up to, the Chinese people were universally friendly if perplexed by John's intrepid band of nuts.  Children in particularly would ""go for them"" in order to practice their English, and a TV station in the capital city of Inner Mongolia actually sent out a crew to film John and company filming steam engines on the JiTong Railway!

Diesel electric locomotives are simply more economically efficient than steam locomotives, which is why they replaced steam in most Western countries more than half a century ago, but the calculation isn't all that lopsided.  The C&O railroad was experimenting with using steam locomotives to pull coal trains as late as the mid-nineteen-eighties, and the primary inefficiency: the need for much more frequent, much more labor intensive maintenance of steam engines, is less of an issue in a low labor cost country like China, which also possesses huge coal reserves.

The problem is that the Chinese government has gotten into its collective head the idea that using allegedly obsolete technology like steam power, even where it makes economic sense to do so, is an international embarrassment, a ""loss of face"" that needs to be hidden away until it can be completely eliminated, and as a totalitarian dictatorship, when they tell you you are getting rid of steam,...

you are getting rid of steam.  It doesn't help matters that nostalgia for obsolete technology like steam engines is primarily a western quirk that hasn't yet caught on in the East.  Thus, groups of (or individual) western railfans loaded down with still and video cameras and wandering around China asking directions to the nearest steam engines are viewed by authorities as everything except what they really are:...

a bunch of harmless nuts who want to take pictures of old stuff in action.

The steam engines in action on this DVD fall primarily into three categories: standard gauge industrial short lines, narrow gauge industrial short lines, and the magnificent (but recently de-steamed) Jining-Tongliao Railway.

Standard gauge steam industrial short lines are in constant danger of replacement by diesel engines whenever the government gets around to it, but since most Chinese steam locomotive operators can (of necessity) do complete maintenance and overhauls, steam could continue to be used almost indefinitely except where forced out.

Narrow gauge steam industrial short lines are in less danger of replacement because there isn't a comparable pool of recently retired first generation diesels in narrow gauge to replace them, but resource exhaustion threatens them more, especially logging operations because Chinese logging primarily involves clear cutting without replanting.  Once the trees are all gone, the logging railroads shut down.

Finally, the Jining-Tongliao Railway was a wonder, a nearly 600 mile long mainline railway built in 1995 in Inner Mongolia with an eye towards reducing startup costs by combining tracks built to a high engineering standard, featuring heavy rail, concrete crossties, and extensive use of tunnels, viaducts, and horseshoe curves to reduce grades, with lower-cost anachronistic technologies intentionally selected for cases where it was possible to upgrade incrementally: semaphore signaling, manned crossing gates, and steam engines.  In particular a lightly used steam engine, built in the 1980's, could be obtained for one twentieth the cost of a new diesel locomotive.  Alas, the magnificent 2-10-2 QJ's were finally shut down and replaced in 2005, so as not to ""embarrass"" China during the Beijing Olympics.  If you want to see them in action, you probably will have to go to Iowa, specifically to the Iowa Interstate Railroad, which purchased a couple for excursion use.",1373241600,,4503,5.2465181058495824
8417874,3,B00478IT7M,"I enjoyed watching it once, it is a very unique look at China, but it is one of those videos that I would not watch over and over again.",1358467200,,136,3.7241379310344827
8417875,5,B00478IT7M,"This is probably the last ever documentary of Chinese steam. The shots from Inner Mongolia were stunning, and it was a beautiful piece which I am very glad I purchased!",1301616000,,168,4.633333333333334
8417876,5,B00478IT7M,"I saw this film on PBS and it was amazing. There are huge numbers of steam locomotives in China, including a 1000 mile passenger line into Mongolia. The filmmakers got into a lot of back country villages and the winter landscapes with steam trains crossing vast empty terrain are beautiful. Interesting culture and people along all the tracks. Seems a lot like the American old west, but happening today. Lots of fun to watch.",1293062400,3,426,4.77027027027027
