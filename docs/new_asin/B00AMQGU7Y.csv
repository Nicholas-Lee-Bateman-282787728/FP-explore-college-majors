5451630,5,B00AMQGU7Y,My son loves all things animal. I remember watching Marty Stouffer as a kid. I am SOOOO glad these episodes are available online.,1388275200,,129,4.6521739130434785
5451631,5,B00AMQGU7Y,"Oh Marty Stouffer. I remember many years ago when I was in elementary school, during a science class, we did a worksheet while watching this video. I was awe-struck. Never before had a witnessed such well filmed displays of prey species using their instincts to foil predators and live to see another day. They didn't play the whole movie for us though and I was disappointed. For many years to follow, I pondered on how to get it. I couldn't remember the title so it was hard. Then I found it but my parents wouldn't get it. Now I have a debit card and I was able to finally purchase it and I must say: WOW.

For footage that was taken before HD was even fathomed, it runs fairly smooth. Might get blurry on strong machines, but you won't cry over it. This DVD is essentially a montage that pools together many of the pieces of footage that Marty has taken over the years, focusing specifically on the parts where prey species display the skills they use to evade predators or ward off rivals. And don't go thinking it's just full of simple chases. The variety of escape methods used here is as great as the variety of species he films in action: which is REALLY saying something. You'll see all sorts of close encounters and escape styles, from cougars giving to mule deer to squirrels outwitting a marten on a tree trunk, to quails using teamwork to spot predators before it's too late.

My only gripes with this is that

1. A few of the scenes cut off in places you'll hate.
2. From my knowledge, one of the scenes where a hare is being chased by a coyote was actually taken from the episode ""Controversial Coyote"" where the coyotes actually CAUGHT the hare. They don't catch it this DVD. It's misleading, but I think he just uses that scene for his montage on lapin chases to make a point.

For 9.99 this is a great value disc. I especially recommend it to people who are unfamiliar with the general Wild America series!",1378512000,2,1925,4.429378531073446

8554014,5,B00AMQGU7Y,"No one does it quite like Marty Stouffer.

He oozes style, he's a stylist second to none, his voice, his point of view, his personality cakes this wild life documentary with Marty Stouffer. What makes this nature documentary stand out from all the other nature programs, and believe me, on cable at night, the channels are cluttered with wild life creatures roaming here and there, is his style of presentation. Yes, he uses high quality cameras to film either eagles soaring, or grizzly bears wrestling, nevertheless, it's how he presents the video and love of nature that makes Wild America a program worth watching.

I've seen countless of nature wild life programs, yet I've never seen like the ones Marty Stouffer presents. His style speaks volumes. And he also has substance: nifty, clever, eye-catching wild life videos flimed at its most natural moment: strong eating weak,  This program, however, is so centered, based, and dug deep into a style mode of telling his spiel, in the end it's worth watching.

Substance only goes so far when it comes to telling the same story; after seconds it gets quite boring, birth, survival, procreation, death. Yeah, yeah, yeah, the story had been told before. Yet when Marty Stouffer tells it, the story takes the shape of the presenter, his style. And his style, I found, to be quite engrossing, quite interesting, quite an earful.",1455062400,,1378,4.926724137931035
