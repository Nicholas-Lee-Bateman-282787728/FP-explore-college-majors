7957115,3,B00005YUQ3,"On the far end of the movie-making spectrum, an infamous, prolific filmmaker is exposed in ""DIRECTED BY ALAN SMITHEE.""

According to official screen credits, Smithee has directed 47 films, written 5 screenplays, acted in three movies, produced one film, and was the production designer on yet another.

Alan Smithee films in all forms have grossed over $100 million. This up-close, short (only 50 minutes), look at the most mysterious pseudonym in Hollywood, reveals Alan Smithee as a director, producer, writer and star who doesn't give interviews, has never been seen at the Oscars and has never appeared on TV -- because he doesn't exist.

That's right. The omnipresent director is not real.  He's the official nom d' auteur for filmmakers who are ashamed of the final release print for one reason or another.

""Directed by Alan Smithee,"" which recently aired on cable TV's American Movie Classic tells the story of an industry's infighting, power-struggles, and betrayals that has led many directors to dis-own a film and use ""directed by Alan Smithee"" as his/her credit.

Interviews with Tony Kaye, John Singleton, Martha Coolidge, and Arthur Hiller are featured.

The real dirt and infights are barely hinted at.  Perhaps some enterprising filmmaker, or is that muckraker, will do justice to this entertaining subject.",1026950400,10,1324,5.241706161137441
