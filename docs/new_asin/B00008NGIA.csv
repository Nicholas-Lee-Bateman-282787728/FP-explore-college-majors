1855510,5,B00008NGIA,"I am 45 and have exercised most of my life and have always looked for a routine that is fun.  This video has changed my life!  It is a new, fun and exciting way to workout.  I have already lost 5 pounds and my husband loves it.  It tones your body as well as teaches you a fun dance routine using the pole.  I never thought I could do it but the Polateaz video teaches you different exercises and routines by showing you step by step. I am a visual learner and the video shows and instructs each exercise and dance movement over and over from all angles.  I love it and there is nothing funner than going for a spin!  I can't wait to buy the advanced version.",1232323200,,659,4.062015503875969
1855511,5,B00008NGIA,"I have a pole in my home and love the ""instructional"" DVD's that are out there.  I had yet to find a great workout DVD using my pole.  Not only do you get a FREE exercise band but it is an incredible workout!  After buying Volume One I purchased Volume Two and both have great workouts in the beginning of the DVD!  She also has a brilliant way of choreographing combination moves so that you can make up your own dance.  She includes transitional moves that start and end in the standing position so they are easy to mix and match.  This is definately one of the better DVD's out there!",1230595200,16,587,4.243243243243243
1855512,4,B00008NGIA,"I thought this workout was great. I have done a lot of different Pilates workouts, and I think Stott Pilates is one of the best I've tried.  Moira is so thorough in her explanations of the moves, without being overbearing. I find her gentle, calm instructions very soothing & effective.  She gives me the impression that I am being coached by a person who always has my best interest in mind, and she adds a giggle here & there, when showing what NOT to do, which helps me enjoy the workout more.  She always stresses breathing and proper allignment, and keeping your wrists angled correctly when holding onto the stretch band.  I feel challenged, but at the same time she reassures me that we should work at our own individual level. I feel very toned and invigorated with this workout. If I need more resistance, I simply shorten the flex band length. I am somewhere between beginner and intermediate in my pilates experience, and this workout suits me perfectly.",1206662400,2,965,4.6923076923076925
1855513,1,B00008NGIA,"The DVD quality is very poor and Moria is very boring. She's an old lady so not motivating for me. Although this is sort of instructional, you'd better check one from library or DVD Rentals. If you're interested in working out with resistance band, try these:
1)Brand New [...] Plus Pilates - Janis Saffell
2)Denise Austin: Power Zone - The Ultimate Metabolism Boosting Workout
3)Pilates Bodyband Challenge
All are available at Amazon.

This Moria's Stott Pilates uses 5' long resistance band but Janis uses 6'. I recommend to use 6' unless you're very short. Janis is my favorite and she makes me sore my [...]!",1167782400,,612,4.828571428571428
1855514,5,B00008NGIA,"If you like Moira Stott then you'll most likely enjoy this program.

 Like many other Stott programs, it's very detailed and a bit on the long side.
But if you have the time to devote to a longer program then this one will
yield many benefits.

 Moira thoroughly warms you up before moving into more challenging
exercises,and I would suggest that if an exercise seems too advanced or doesn't feel right
that one could simply skip it and go to the next exercise.

 The DVD is chaptered exercise by exercise so it's easy to just press the
forward button and move on to the next exercise without having to wait through
any exercise you decide to pass on.

 I did this program again yesterday and I felt like I got a very thorough,
moderately challenging workout.

 If you like a very calm and meditative approach to Pilates with great
detail then you'll love this, if you want something that moves super fast
with a perky instructor and loud music then this most definitely will not be
for you.",1159056000,3,991,4.51685393258427
1855515,3,B00008NGIA,"This is a good pilates workout using the flex band. The instructor is great and easy to follow. However, I prefer the stability ball, the magic circle and mat work to the flex band. The flex band is my least favorite because I find that it really hurts my hands. Also, I found my wrist bending in an awkward position as I try to hold on the flex band and do the exercises. I was careful to hold the band the way the instructor recommended to avoid hurting my wrist but unless you have really strong hands/wrists, there is no way, you can hold on to the bands and do the exercises. Also, I didn't think the exercises were as much fun as the ones in the Pilates for Dummies DVD, Mari Windsor, Classical Pilates, Pilates on the ball etc.",1090972800,5,734,4.25
1855536,3,B00008NGIA,"The workout was great and tough, which I liked!  As a beginner (and it states this DVD is for beginners and intermediate), it was near impossible to do a lot of the move combos.  As in other reviews, I agree that there was not nearly enough instruction of each move.  They show you it once (fast with no instruction) and then again with small details of instruction.  Also, it would also be easier to follow if they showed you the move from the back...if the instructor faced the way we face when watching the TV.  I've been to pole dance classes and this is the position they instruct from.  Then it looks the same as when you do it and it's much easier to imitate and follow.",1284940800,2,677,4.291338582677166
1855537,4,B00008NGIA,There are definitely some moves that are past beginner for instance the side spins are more intermediate and the elbow handstand is intermediate as well not for beginners.  The music I really like and the routine I really like as well.  Knowing what I know this video is worth the money.  I was hoping this video would help me to gain strength.  The workout is really tough but I am not sure that it helps you to gain strength to do the elbow handstand or the side spins.,1273017600,2,471,4.318181818181818
1855538,4,B00008NGIA,"I am not the most in-shape person, but this really left me sore the next day!  I love how she takes you through a thorough a solid warm-up, routine and cool down.  She offers several ""levels"" to each move based on your fitness so it's great that there's differentiation within the routine.  If you are someone like me, on the lowest level of fitness, this video will be challenging for awhile as I work through the different levels within each move.  A lot of the exercise are very Pilates based and since I'm familiar with Pilates they aren't new to me.

My only main complaint is that the workout itself does not use the pole that much.  The pole is mainly used to wrap the band around.  I also wasn't expecting a lot from the combination and teaching the pole tricks.  Therefore I was not disappointed.  There are some neat combination and tricks.  I like how they show you the combination and then one more time slower so that you can catch it.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone looking for a basic workout and perhaps learn a new transition or move.  However, this is not a DVD that uses the pole a lot and is not going to teach you any crazy pole tricks.  If you are looking for a DVD that does tricks, find another.",1269820800,8,1226,4.324561403508772
1855539,3,B00008NGIA,"The pole portion of this video is nothing special.  The beginning work out/warm up is actually better than the pole tricks in my opinion.  I am currently enrolled in two different programs that teach pole dancing and I've had other videos to compare this to.  The pole tricks are not really broken down or explained, and they are done quickly and sort of carelessly.  I wasn't blown away by Dr. Amy's pole dancing either, she kind of bored me.  When I see a pole dancer doing a routine I want it to look effortless otherwise why would I want to learn to do it?  Save your money for a better video, this one is definitely over rated.",1267574400,5,632,4.358974358974359
1855540,5,B00008NGIA,"I have so enjoyed this DVD, gaining strength and muscle toning have been my favorite results....the warm up is perfect for building up to the pole moves.  The video is easy to follow, the instruction is great.  Thank you Doc Amy for making this video, it's so fun and I'm loving the results.",1251936000,2,291,4.471698113207547
1855541,5,B00008NGIA,"I try to make working out a priority but it is often hard to find the motivation. This DVD is such a fun workout, plus it teaches some great moves that are not only entertaining but they make you feel sexy and good about yourself. I think this is a great addition to my weekly workouts and the routines are getting more and more fun every time I watch. Plus, Dr. Amy has such an easy way of teaching that she takes the intimidation away and gives me the confidence to keep trying. I highly recommend this DVD.",1251936000,2,509,4.204081632653061
1855542,4,B00008NGIA,This Pole Workout DVD is great!! With any workout it takes practice and I find Dr. Amy's DVD shows the proper technique to learn. My confidence and strength has improved so much by doing this DVD.  If you're not competent enough maybe you shouldn't be on a pole! DOUBLE DUH!!,1251936000,6,275,4.5
1855543,1,B00008NGIA,"This video is NOT for beginners!

The video begins with a warm-up routine that lasts forever. Let's get on the pole! That's what I bought the DVD for!

So, the next segment ""breaks down"" the combos. There isn't any way to quickly move from combo to combo and the steps are shown twice. That's it. Twice.

And lastly, at least three of the combos involve introversion. Upside down is not for beginners. I almost broke my neck.

Save money and stay out of the ER. Don't buy this video!",1251244800,11,483,4.393258426966292
1855544,4,B00008NGIA,includes a good workout. You will feel the burn. Teaches some good moves on the pole. Really fun way to workout. The quality of the video is not so great but it serves its purpoe. I recommend it.,1241654400,,195,4.157894736842105

7985929,5,B00008NGIA,This DVD is great for streching and strenthening exercises as well as learning basic and intermediate moves. Dr. Amy teaches it smoothly and efficiently . I reccomend this dvd and her advance dvd before purchasing any others.,1353110400,,225,5.108108108108108
7985930,4,B00008NGIA,This pole workout is easy to follow. I am using it as a tool to lose 100 lbs. I am only 2 weeks in and I am feeling the burn.,1351814400,,125,3.2
7985931,3,B00008NGIA,"The workout is a pretty good 30 minute workout and including the band was a nice feature (even though I'm sure it only cost a penny).  I'm surprised by some of the moves she teaches for beginner level.  I've been taking pole dancing lessions for several months so I felt comfortable doing the moves but for a true beginner I don't think they are going to know how to do safe inverted moves and a forearm handstand! Quality of the dvd was just ok, didn't like where you can tell when they stopped and restarted filming during the workout (probably to take breaks!). I like using this mainly for the workout.",1349481600,,606,4.45045045045045
7985932,3,B00008NGIA,This video has a good pilates style workout that incorporates the pole. Unfortunately the pole tricks are ran through really quickly with very little instruction.,1327536000,,162,5.52
7985933,3,B00008NGIA,I prefer a faster pace to keep me interested and the work outs and warms ups were boring to me. They are very similar to ones I did in dance classes and ones I have done on other exercise videos but the way they were done just bored me. The pole work was more interesting but I still found this hard to keep my attention. Nothing really made me feel excited to try what they were doing. So this is practical but not fun.,1306972800,,420,4.011904761904762

7985935,5,B00008NGIA,After recently adding a pole in my home I was trying to find an awesome workout to use with it. Not only did I love the dance move but the workout was very good. It was similar to pilates but allowed some more intense moves because of the pole. The body ache the next day put a smile on my face.,1287360000,,295,3.8524590163934427
