8293189,1,B001DG5C26,"This is absolute rubbish. Worst movie in this genre I've seen and I've seen almost all of them. I found it hard to make out a lot of the action,and the minimalist screen images are difficult to see. Blurred images are the norm. Terrible!",1370649600,,237,4.409090909090909
8293190,1,B001DG5C26,whoever gave this a 5 star review is obviously related to the production staff. This movie gets maybe 2 stars just because Alan Ford's colored comentary. Otherwise this is possibly the worse hooligan movie i've seen. all the CCTV  clips are terrible and everything is super hard to see. again Alan Ford makes this. If you don't like him then this possibly -2 stars. not worth $20 what i paid let alone 10 what it should be,1297296000,,422,4.48051948051948
8293191,5,B001DG5C26,Loved this DVD. It shows all the different problems faced on the streets of the UK and the vigilantes who are standing up for what is right. Lots of football (soccer) hooligans in the UK.,1283385600,,187,4.371428571428571
