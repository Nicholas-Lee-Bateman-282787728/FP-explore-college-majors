8659621,5,B00KL1IXC0,". I have to say that this is the best set of DVDs with a focus on the Takamatsu-Den arts that I've run across. I initially bought the first three DVDs in your series, but after viewing Volume I (Daken), I immediately ordered the 4th DVD in the series. I found it very refreshing that you are steadfast in your approach to teaching the arts with the standards which have fallen out of popularity elsewhere, and it shows in the quality of the material covered in each DVD. I've been a student of Takamatsu-Den arts since 1993, when I ran across my first teacher working out of a wrestling room at Cal State Fullerton, and I haven't seen the arts practiced as he did until I put in the first DVD, so I am very grateful for that, considering some of the very bad habits condoned (even promoted) in some of the places I've studied since. I sincerely wish that there was a Jinenkan dojo in my area, as I appreciate how the Takamatsu-Den arts have been preserved & perpetuated within Jinenkan in a way which has disappeared from Bujinkan in their pursuit of more money. What truly stands out are some of the details you include on particular techniques, which is another thing which makes your DVDs stand head & shoulders above the rest. I would certainly be interested in any future material produced by your dojo, and you may rest assured that I am recommending your DVDs to my friends, especially the ones I regularly train with. Is there a possibility that sometime in the future, you may produce DVDs focused on the curriculum of particular Ryu? Once again, thank you for producing such incredible DVDs.",1444780800,3,1601,4.5625
