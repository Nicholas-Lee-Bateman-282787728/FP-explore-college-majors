1648417,5,B00005QG4E,"It is the year 1975 when ABBA and the children TV show ""Fem myror r fler n fyra elefanter"" (translation: Five ants are more than four than five elephants) was immensely popular in Sweden.  Elisabeth has just been beaten up by her husband and she has decided to move to to her brother Gran's with her two children.  What makes the film more interesting is that Gran lives in a commune with a wide variety of characters that are rather radical on the left side of politics and openly display opinions and thoughts in regards to anything.  At first is Elisabeth is bothered by their openness towards one another, but she realizes that she has no where else to go as a jobless housewife.  As time passes Elisabeth becomes not only comfortable, but also begins to form her own notions, which strengthens her.
Together (Tillsammans) is a marvelous  and well directed story as it is a kaleidoscope of notions put into action in an environment where love and confrontations belong in the daily routine.  Despite the confrontational situations in the film, Moodysson creates a warm atmosphere where one concept overrides all other thoughts, which is that notions are pointless in the absence of company.  This results in a warm comedy with serious undertones that offer much food for thought as Moodysson leaves the audience with a brilliant cinematic experience.",1077494400,23,1354,4.88646288209607
1648418,4,B00005QG4E,"A very strange movie indeed, I had the good fortune to work on the subtitles for the forthcoming DVD, and I was surprised by how sincere and natural all of the performances were, even the children. The basic premise here is that a battered wife leaves her husband and takes her daughter and son to live with her brother, who lives in a small house with other assorted communal hippies. (This all takes place in Sweden during the 70s by the way)
The best parts of the movie involve the characters' reactions when the reality of life clashes with their communist ideals. Take Goran for instance, who is only happy to involve himself in an ""open"" relationship with his girlfriend, until the reality of it sets in. His growing inability to deal with this leads to a truly volcanic (and cathartic) eruption. Tom Wolfe's idea of radical chic is wonderfully played out when the mother falls under the influence of the resident lesbian--she lets her armpit hair grow out and goes on from there. The lesbian, in turn, is divorced from Lasse, who is being pursued by Klas, an effeminate fellow who is also on a conversion crusade. The movie is filled with great music and great performances, and though it has some shocking moments, it's worth the time.",1071014400,3,1243,4.680365296803653

Each character is distinct and consistent. EXCELLENT ACTING!

The subject matter is strong, relevant (in any era), powerful in so many directions and ways that all work well together (no pun intended)though this is a period piece. This film touches on every major issue that affects people in every facet of life today, except racism and abortion.

The editing/score/music fits perfectly.

The cinematography MAKES THIS FILM WORK. WOW, the zoom in's are magnificent. Wow.

The direction is WOW!

MASTERWORK!

1648423,4,B00005QG4E,"Here is a prime example of how rudimentary direction issues and cheaply administered editing can diminish a potentially phenomenal film.  `Tillsammans' is a film that has so much going for it.  The script itself is nearly flawless.  The story told here is one that I just fawned all over while I was watching it.  The character developments, the triangles that form within relationships and outside of them, the dialog and sequence of events are all strategically placed for optimum enjoyment.  The film is delightfully sincere and oddly honest in a way that makes you really connect to what is going on.  The moral code uncovered and elaborated on is pure and relatable and believable.

But the film just feels so cheaply made and the `made for television' feel that is attained by an overuse of fadeouts and some dire directorial mistakes make this film less than perfect.

The film tells the story of Elisabeth, a mother of two who tires of her abusive drunk of a husband and leaves him, for good.  She calls her brother Goran and has him pick her up.  Soon, Elisabeth and her kids are living with Goran and all his friends, part of a commune called `Together'.  Rebels to society, the commune has their own way of living that differs drastically from what Elisabeth is used to, but change is just what she needs at this point in her life.  Her husband, Rolf, is devastated by his loss and so he begins to work on himself, a task that is far harder than he expected.  The children, caught in the middle, try very hard to regain some sort of normalcy.  Their sudden presence also stirs things within the commune as core values are tested thanks to a progressive feel within their `ideals'.  Soon, everything is turned upside down, but there is always a pleasant tone that lets you know everything is all right.

What I love so much about `Tillsammans' is that is really understands how to balance out the happy and sad of life and present something that doesn't ever seem tarnished by Hollywood's fascination with the overdramatic.

The film feels honest.

The acting is a mixed bag though.  In parts it really shines.  Michael Nyqvist is remarkable as Rolf.  You can really feel his rage, his fear, his failure, his despair.  It just bleeds off of him.  Lisa Lindgren is also sensational as Elisabeth.  Gustaf Hammarsten has his moments, but for the most part he sinks into the background.  Rapace and Roney are terrible here and the pick and gnaw at the beautifully interesting characters they are given.

It upsets me, severely.

Alas, I still give this a solid B and highly recommend you give it a try.  The screenplay alone is well worth enduring some missteps for.  It is a beautifully told story that could have been remarkable had it been treated kinder by the director.",1296777600,3,2780,4.68595041322314

1648426,4,B00005QG4E,"This Swedish comedy is set in 1970 and takes a look at life in a commune in Stockholm. Elisabeth (Lisa Lindgren) runs away from her drunken husband, Rolf (Michael Nyqvist), after he hits her in the face, taking along her 13-year-old daughter and son who is eight or nine. They land up with Elizabeth's brother who lives in a hippie commune where the members are all committed to socialism, vegetarianism, feminism and open-marriage but cannot agree whose turn it is to do the washing up.

The poor kids feel humiliated and estranged among a bunch of immature adults -- and their father's efforts to win back their trust only make things worse. But slowly they begin forming relationships with other kids their own age. Meanwhile Elizabeth is introduced to feminist ideas expressed by the radical notion of allowing her underarm hair to grow. We soon learn that behind the empty slogans of the hippies lies deep hypocrisy -- and we eventually learn what it takes to form a real community bound by ties of love and affection. Along the way there are many funny moments.

What I liked about this movie, apart from the Abba soundtrack, is that the characters change and grow -- and that the ideological points it makes are delivered subtly instead of being hammered home.",1259539200,4,1267,4.780821917808219
1648427,3,B00005QG4E,"Of the three  Lukas Moodysson films I've seen, this one is my least favorite. That's not quite as bad as it sounds. I loved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lilya-4-Ever-Region-2/dp/B000A2W52E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lilya 4-Ever [Region 2</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Show-Me-Love/dp/B00004YKR3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Show Me Love</a>. Together had me running hot and cold. It was quite a while into the movie before I began to care about many of these characters. The real core of this movie is daughter Eva. I found her character, storyline and acting to be what ultimately kept me watching it all the way to the end. She is brilliantly awkward. Not even awkward. Normal but not one of the bonehead popular girls.

It is the people in the Together collective themselves who I largely disliked. Not that I have to love people, or that they have to be people with whom I'd want to fraternize for me to like a movie, far from it, but for much of the movie almost all of them annoyed me. I quite enjoyed Eva's father and his new friend, though.

And yet... the movie is somehow tragic and quite lovely. In American cinematic terms, think of a Pleasantville, albeit one that takes alot longer to get going. As a person who is as far from being a ""soccer fan"" as one can be, I found myself quite moved by it at times here.

My 2nd viewing is what drove home my ambivalence. The sections of the movie I didn't care for the first time around seemed to be even more tedious the 2nd time, but yes I still enjoyed what I'd previously enjoyed. Summation: I'd never buy this movie. Seeing it twice during the rental was enough for me. That's what separates this movie from the aforementioned Moodysson films. I greatly enjoyed and was consistently moved (or haunted) by those 2. Were I unwrapping a Christmas or birthday gift and found one or both of those inside I'd be completely pleased and would end up seeing both of them many times. Together didn't have that sort of staying-power. I think it could have, but it didn't quite.",1203292800,3,2125,5.097701149425287
1648428,5,B00005QG4E,"I have to admit that I loved this movie. It is not easy for me to find a film that compels me to care so much about the characters. Whether it was finding one repugnant or feeling incredibly sorry for another one, I was fully engaged with all of them and really wanted to see what happened. I found that just their daily interactions were complex and often hysterical. Even the kids (very rare that I really like kids in films) were fascinating. This movie is set in the 70's and I found only one ""mistake"" about the time period. Other than that, everything was appropriate to that decade - especially the mere notion of free sex/love and communal living. But the personalities of these characters make this movie worth watching. I watched it last night and I find myself still laughing about it today. If you like quirky, complicated people trying to survive living together interesting, you will like this one for sure.",1199923200,,921,4.621951219512195
1648429,3,B00005QG4E,"This was a fairly good movie, but it is not a 5 star DVD.  It is basically a story about aimless hippies in mid 1970s Sweden and their impractical solutions to their bizarre little problems.",1196467200,,190,4.428571428571429

1648433,5,B00005QG4E,"I grew up in Sweden in the 70's, and can attest to this film being *very* realistic.  Well, most of us grew up in regular family households rather than communes like this one - yet the tone, dialogue, props, setting, mood, and plot - all hit the mark exactly. Moodysson is a genius to be able to tell a whole generation's painful rite of passage with such a sense of hilarity and warmth.",1106438400,16,387,4.301369863013699

One reviewer complained about the number of characters - but that's not only the charm of the movie - but its very premise!  Certainly there is an amount of predictability but the cast is so into what they're doing that they are believable and work in true ensemble fashion.

The soundtrack is an awful lot of fun (and sometimes ""awful"") and the secondary story involving the children and how they adapt to the wacky communal ideals of the adults is thought provoking. The film packs its message with little to no subtlety and none is desired or required here.

As tasty as a Swedish Meatball!

1648435,5,B00005QG4E,"I had the good fortune to see this film in a theatre in Northern California, where the audience (including more than a few aging hippies) chortled and guffawed with good-natured self-recognition.  The opening scenes, -- particularly a drearily, draining, painfully drawn-out, ""issue-oriented"" house meeting at the politicized/feminist/alternative lifestyle commune where the action takes place -- were a veritable flashback, especially for my companion, who had gone to college in Santa Cruz and had had plenty of exposure to lesbian-feminist process... It was quite funny, but in a loving, self-deprecatory way.  Where many would wring laughter out of mockery and stereotyping, the director here was truthful and honest, and gave the characters the respect and depth they deserved.  The interplay and fluidity between ""straight"" and ""alternative"" culture is handled with exeptional skill, particularly as seen through the eyes of two children who are thrown in the midst of the well-intentioned but disorganized soul-searching of the older generation.  And for those of us who grew up in the 1970s and were exposed to similar cultural experimentation, the dual dangers and priceless opportunities of the ""hippie"" era are brought back in a heart-warming but not overly sentimental way.  This film rings true in every way; like Richard Linklatter's ""Dazed And Confused,"" it should be viewed by anyone who'd like to see what the 'Seventies were *really* like.",1104192000,13,1457,5.486607142857143

1648437,4,B00005QG4E,"(Not ot be confused with another great film of the same name, directed by Chinese master Chen Kaige.)
""Together"" is the second film by Lukas Moodysson, who gave us very charming film ""Show Me Love.""  (If you have not seen it, you are just missing a great thing.)  Here, Moodysson tackles different theme, a small commune in 1975 in Sweden, in which their ideals are tested by the new members of the place.
The film starts when a mother Elizabeth left her home with two children, Eva and Stefan, because of the perpetual violence of the drunkard husband.  Now, the plot sounds heavy, but this film never gets too serious, so we are quickly introduced to the commune named ""Together"" where many colorful people are living.  They are Erik, young radical student whose ideas go ridiculously too far; Anna, feminist turned lesbian who likes meditating; Goran, who is too kind-hearted (or timid) to tell what he realy thinks, Lena, whose idea of Free Love is a real suspect, and others, including a boy Tet (named after the event of the war in Vietnam) who plays with Stefan, doing ""mock-torturing.""
Now join the distraught wife Elizabeth and Eva and Stefan.  The film tells how the commune react to them (and them to the commune) in a light touch, with many episodes.  The general tone of the film is that of a well-made comedy, though for American audience some of the contents are very radical (nudity included).  It's a Swedish film, after all.
The most impressive part is, like the previous ""Show Me Love,"" the kids.  Eva and the boy living across the street establish a budding relation which might be called love, and their embarrassed feelings towards the unique adults are implied very delicately in the apparently small things -- like staying all the day in a small van (which looks like the one you see in ""Scooby-Doo"").
And what I liked most is the sly touch of the film, which suggests that the commune is not going to last forever.  I do not talk about the ending, but from the beginning you find that the community of the kind -- hippies denying any kind of  commercialism, like TV or soft drink -- belongs to the things of the past.  Like the music of ABBA, it's definitely 70s.  And that's why they look charming, looking back from now.
You may find some of the characters annoying, but the film is delightful enough to make them, if not likeable, certainly irresitible.  ""Together"" has that kind of power, which comples you to keep watching.",1078272000,19,2453,4.663573085846868

7950531,5,B00005QG4E,"This is a cracking film from Sweden. It takes us back to the idealistic days of the 1970's when we were struggling with a hangover from the `summer of love', the rise of glam rock and disco - yes we have Abba - and the need to wear man made fibres - like nylon. We find a group of left thinking friends who have decided to say no to bourgeois capitalism and live in a commune. This is `together' where hippy ideals are thriving and every individual has the right to express themselves - so long as it isn't looked down on by the others - like eating meat for instance.

Well we have Goran who is the nicest man on the planet. He has an open relationship with his `partner' - but her interpretation of that means that basically she can be `open' to other men - and he is `fine' with that - apparently. Then his sister calls and asks to stay for a while as her drunken husband has beaten her again. She arrives in the flower painted VW camper and her kids immediately hate it. She, on the other hand, is open to new ideas, and soon is having an impact of her own. What develops is how both sides of the argument (if you can cal it that) get to be aired ie: the right and the left and positions have to change.

This is funny, well written, brilliantly observed and absurdly excellent for what appear to be all the wrong reasons and I absolutely loved it. The spying neighbours are great too and whilst there is undoubtedly a message here - ie: everyone has something valid to say and bring to the table - it doesn't matter as it is done so nicely. The period detail is done really well and the characters are all really likeable - the sort to make you want to watch it as you care about them so completely. The commune kids have great names too, one is called `Moon' and another young boy is called `Tet' after the Tet Offensive in the Vietnam War - seriously Frank Zappa could have learnt from these guys - I can not recommend highly enough.",1391040000,2,1940,4.198391420911528
