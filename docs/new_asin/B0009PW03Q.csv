2311825,5,B0009PW03Q,"Michael Moore has be left unchecked for years. Kudos to Larry Elder for exposing his marxist liberal agenda. The majority of Americans don't believe in the Michael Moore school of thought. November 2, 2004 showded us that. So, Larry gets the big five stars from me and if I could give him 6 I would!!!!!!!!!!!",1121990400,42,309,4.636363636363637
2311826,4,B0009PW03Q,"Loved the video.  I'm a regular talk radio listener of Larry, so I knew what to expect.  The movie presents facts about guns and gun users that would probably surprise the passionate anti-gun liberal.  The difference is very clear cut between the two film makers...Michael Moore's so called documentary was scripted, edited to change facts and presented incorrect information.  I saw Moore interviewed where he laughed at his false information saying he was an entertainer, not a journalist.  Whether you agree with Mr. Elder or not, at least he presents the facts.  How rare these days!",1121731200,198,587,5.0625
2311827,5,B0009PW03Q,"I will definitely come back to add to my review once I get a chance to watch the film. But, as a long-time Elderado (regular listener of Larry's show), I feel qualified to recomend this to potential buyers that haven't ""heard the word"" on Larry's radio show (which is also highly recomended). Larry is by far the most consistently entertaining, informative and admirable talk show host I've heard. I expect this film will be great.

Brandon Harlow (negative review): Let's assume that the film doesn't address the issue and only attacks Moore's credibility, I wouldn't know yet. If Moore's work is regularly accepted as a credible ""documentary"", would it not be a service to viewers to expose that his main points are fabricated?

Maybe if you would have paid attention to Bowling, you would have noticed that the points about numbers of guns alluded to ""data"" and the points about fear from governments and corporations were expressed mostly through cartoons. Moore himself enjoys using fear to lobby his causes by superimposing horrific incidents like Columbine over the much broader issue of gun control. But, I suppose we are all entitled to decide what convincing evidence is.

Anyway, one doesn't have to do much research to discover what your motivations are. Just click on your ""See all my reviews"" and the pattern is obvious. Have a chip on your shoulder or what?",1121558400,29,1372,4.93073593073593
2311828,5,B0009PW03Q,"I saw a theatrical screening several months ago and was very impressed. This film dispels so many of the lies and distortions of the antigun crowd. If you would like to learn more about firearms and be entertained at the same time, this is an excellent place to start. And please check any preconceived notions at the door!",1121126400,47,323,4.586206896551724
2311829,1,B0009PW03Q,"Attack the messanger instead of addressing the issue. Neither original nor creative, what we have here is a rip-off of Moore to trash Moore.

If Elder had bothered to pay attention to Bowling, he would have understood that it is not the number of guns which is central to the issue, it is the constant feelings of fear and anxiety that is played up by government and greedy corporations.",1121126400,24,387,4.608695652173913
2311849,5,B0009PW03Q,"Larry Elder has successfully shown in this film that the ""ruling elite"" and their efforts to take away our Second Amendment rights to protect ourselves by gun ownership is simply a means to control & subvert law-abiding citizens. Guns do not kill, PEOPLE do!
 Every person has the responsibilty to protect their rights and most importantly to protect their own life! For some the best way to protect themselves is by owning a gun. Of course, we need to to be taught how to use a gun responsibly & to follow sensible regulations.
 This film has convinced me that it is time to stand up for my rights while I still have them! Thank you Mr. Elder!",1232755200,,644,4.495726495726496
2311850,5,B0009PW03Q,"Larry Elder did a fantastic job making the case for the 2nd Amendment. He also did it without making people who voiced dissenting opinions look ridiculous, or taking their comments out of context. I could have done without the animated scene of a cartoon Larry interviewing a stammering, answerless Michael Moore - though I understand the provocation! The brief but actual on-the-street confrontation between them showed well enough what a self-absorbed blowhard Michael Moore is. But despite that single stumble this documentary does a great job presenting its case, which is: gun control does not stop criminals from having guns and does nothing to mitigate violent crime, not even gun crime! (Witness Britan with much more stringent gun control than the US and escalating gun violence!) All it does is take the ability for self-defense away from law-abiding citizens, or turn law-abiding citizens into criminals when they refuse to give up their guns.",1230422400,,954,5.241830065359477

2311852,5,B0009PW03Q,"And give it to him some more! Michael & Me is not so much a critique of Moore's oeuvre as it is an analysis and repudiation of the prevarications he publicized in Bowling for Columbine. Further, it attacks the prohibition of firearms more than it does the director himself. Such an approach is badly needed and, despite's its low budget feel, these frames tell us far more about guns and the human psyche than anything Michael Moore has ever produced. Some of the interviews (of people on the street in particular) were absolutely hysterical. The girl who believed that she did not need a gun to defend herself against home intruders because she felt her confident demeanor would frighten them off was tragic but one you'll not soon forget. Volokh's mentioning of the way some people want to do policy by wishful thinking was right on the money. Overall, the experts here are outstanding. The Joyce Malcolm segment was brief but a highlight I'd say. She shared the story of Tony Martin who got life imprisonment in England for shooting two burglars who broke into his home. The words of the two retired Los Angeles police offices were impeccable as well. This is a must see.",1200096000,,1174,4.703883495145631
2311853,1,B0009PW03Q,"This film claims to be an unbiased look at gun control, but I would not be suprised if it has some sort of NRA funding backing it somewhere.  In the end, it is just as loaded and biased as the filmmaker alluded to in the title.  It is a response to ""Bowling for Columbine"" that feels more like damage control.  It is permeated by the stench of the same old argument, ""guns don't kill people, people do.""  Well, they sure do make it easier, don't they! The director of this documentary has a very obvious agenda.  After the shooting at Virginia Tech, and with all the violence in our society, it is really irresponsible not to at leat ponder the idea of some sort of restricitons on gun ownership.  There are people out there, however, that will not change their minds.  For those that are unwilling to consider any reasonable arguements, then I suppose this is the film for you!",1194566400,,878,4.45
2311854,5,B0009PW03Q,"The one criticism of this documentary I have is that I had no idea what it was going to be about with the exception that I figured Michael Moore was going to be in there somewhere.

What Larry Elder has done is create a comprehensive and compelling look at how our fantasies of how life should be collide head on with reality.  Sure, it would be great just to make gun violence illegal by passing laws, but reality just seem to work differently.  This documenary convincingly shows how.  It short, it illustrates how gun control laws can kill more people than guns do.

It get's a little bit dry about an hour into it with one interview after another, but the sheer credibility of the interview subjects kept my attention, and thankfully there's a funny if not too subtle cartoon parody of Michael Moore thrown in there too.

So, bravo for Larry Elder to make a documentary about reality.  We could use more like this.",1192665600,2,918,4.527272727272727
2311855,5,B0009PW03Q,"One of the most reasonable assemblies of pro-firearms opinions and anecdotes available. I would recommend this to anyone who wishes to make informed decisions with regard to gun control policy, as it contradicts much of what is hyped in the media regarding gun violence and cuts through much of the mythology surrounding guns and criminal behavior. Interviews with average, working people who have defended themselves against violence with a firearm, police officers expressing their desire that citizens become more proactive in fighting crime and self-defense, and with gang-bangers who describe how they choose their marks and what their decision-making process would have been had they known their intended target was armed are thought-provoking, even for the most rabid gun-control proponent.",1184198400,,797,5.65
2311856,5,B0009PW03Q,"In this short documentary, Larry Elder goes after the gun control issue in the style of Michael Moore and clearly comes out on top. He manages to expose some of the fraudulent claims of Moore and others in their crusade for gun control. That, simply put, is the synopsis of the program.

I did not expect the program to be very good in the production value arena but I was pleasantly surprised. It was well done.

The program is not overly long but it packs a punch in the time it has available.",1181606400,,495,4.311827956989247
2311857,5,B0009PW03Q,"A curveball indie for the ages.  Down-on-his-luck comedian Willard Morgan doggedly pursues Michael ""Roger and Me"" Moore with a hand-held camera that misses nothing.  That Morgan believes Moore of all people is his key to Hollywood stardom says much about this film's perversity.  Funny, idiosyncratic, and definitely verite.",1179878400,,324,5.708333333333333
2311858,2,B0009PW03Q,"I watched this movie in an attempt to keep a balanced perspective of both liberal and conservative views. I wasn't convinced. Though Mr. Elder manages to bring in valid arguments, they are not delivered with a powerful punch. Instead, the viewer is left listening to mostly ""opinions."" The arguments, in case you're interested, are that statistics do not indicate that lawful gun owners commit numerous crimes, gun control laws do not reduce crime, and people might just need guns someday to defend themselves against their own government. I would have loved to have seen this latter point explored in depth (i.e., as to why this should be a genuine concern of citizens). As mentioned, however, the arguments are overshadowed by the endless droning of beliefs, as opposed to facts.",1173571200,,781,5.062015503875969
2311888,5,B0009PW03Q,"There are a lot of strong stories that do not support the shunning of guns from society.  It shows more to the story than Michael Moore will tell, and unlike Moore's film, it portrays both pro and anti gun people as level-headed. In Bowling For Columbine, anyone who is pro-second amendment is a nut. He does not demonize his opposition because he has a strong enough arguement to play fair.",1168473600,4,391,4.585714285714285

2311890,5,B0009PW03Q,"I ordered this movie a few months ago and have watched it several times over. This movie presents the argument against gun-control better than any book or article I've read. I've seen Bowling for Columbine and remember leaving the theatre confused as to what exactly Michael Moore was trying to say. In this documentary Larry leaves the viewer having a very clear view on his stance and arguments, and feeling very well informed on the subject. If this is Larry Elder's first movie he sure did an excellent job as this film is both entertaining and informative. The only criticism I can give it is the title is a little misleading. The film really doesn't focus much on Michael Moore as it does on just presenting the arguments against gun-control in the US. All in all though this is definately the best documentary I've seen in a long while.",1145836800,18,843,4.6644295302013425
2311891,5,B0009PW03Q,"I think the title says it all.  Unlike Michael Moore, Larry Elder presents a cogent, nonfictional account of the issues surrounding firearms ownership.  He doesn't interview any famous people with a debilitating disease and edit the interview to make the poor individual look like a kook.  He doesn't make up any statistics.  And, he doesn't break the furniture of any of the people in his film.

If you have more than a few gray cells left and possess a modicum of ability at cogent thought, this documentary is worth viewing.",1143590400,21,527,4.811111111111111

2311893,2,B0009PW03Q,"Michael and me is an ok documentary with flawed logic by some of the interviewees. Take Jane Doe who seems to blame the government's 10 days waiting period for her rape. Instead she should blame the rapist or fate.

Also Elder looses respect when he attacks Moore. Instead he should've focuses on gun control instead of throwing mud.",1132272000,18,333,4.741379310344827
2311894,1,B0009PW03Q,"I'm sick and tired of misleading ""documentaries."" Larry Elder is a hack. He clearly has an agenda, just like Moore, to spew his loaded opinions to the masses. If you really want to know the facts about the second amendment, gun control, and the American media start reading. I'm not talking about Elder or Moore's books either. I'm talking about hard research. Study the constitution, our founding fathers, the history of our media, the history of gun laws, and our judicial system in general. Don't get your history from no-talent hacks.

Also, if you really think the media is liberal, then I would suggest studying the media and taking journalism classes. There is no such thing as ""The Liberal Media"" just like there is no such thing as ""The Conservative Media."" If we truly had a liberal media, then every news station and newspaper would be like ""The Nation"" or ""Mother Jones Diary."" Same goes for a conservative medai. Then everything would be like ""The Weekly Standard"" or ""American Spectator."" What we have is a corporate media. A media that only cares about ratings and telling us B.S. that we don't need to know. They also neglect to tell us a lot about certain issues and stories. I'd rather have a biased media then the one we have now. Conservative and Liberal medai outlets are always more accurate than the mainstream media. They're not run by some corporation that's just lookin' for a buck. They're real journalists that actually care about reporting and giving you the facts. The only thing Brit Hume, Wolf Blitzer, or any other moron on the cable news cares about is their pocket book.",1131235200,43,1605,4.773381294964029
2311895,5,B0009PW03Q,Larry Elder interviews people who have/know the facts on this issue. Larry gives Mr. Moore a chance to come on his show so they can debate the 2nd Amendment. But as you guessed he doesnt want to take Larry up on his offer. If you enjoy The Sage from South Central BUY this DVD.,1130889600,39,277,4.148148148148148
2311896,5,B0009PW03Q,"Larry Elder gathers input from an impressive collection of historians, lawyers, criminologists, and scholars on the role of guns in America, including comparisons of other nations' relationships with guns and gun control.  In addition to the erudite speakers interviewed by Elder, there were numerous man-on-the-street interviews which reflected the knowledge, ignorance, and opinions of Americans about gun rights.  Also fascinating were the insights of reformed gang leaders and their anecdotal experiences and views on guns and crime.

The American public ranges from ignorant to sharply astute in their understanding of our Constitution, our nation's gun laws, and gun statistics.  Elder dispels misunderstandings, clarifies realities, and reveals the plain-spoken truth of guns.  The result shows guns to be tools (dangerous in the hands of criminals and life-saving in the hands of those who would deter them); shows that these tools are used far more to protect than to harm; explains that even if you could undo the 2nd Amendment and remove guns from the law-abiding, you'd still have a thriving black-market abundantly providing them to the lawless; and unambiguously explains that, love them or hate them, it is our Constitutional right to own guns.

I confess a bias in reviewing this documentary:  I came into the 1990's a gun-hater, but found my opinions irrevocably altered over the course of that decade by exactly the kind of hard facts compiled and introduced here by Larry Elder.  So be warned, those of you who think you are faithfully married to the ideals of gun control:  this movie can alter your thinking, it can lead to the kind of knowledge and understanding that, once achieved, can never be undone.

My one beef with this documentary is the title, which I thought was slightly misleading.  I had hoped for a greater confrontation between Elder & Michael Moore, though in all fairness, it's been so long since I saw ""Roger & Me"" that I don't remember whether Moore succeeded in any better of a showdown between himself and Roger Smith in that movie.  Fortunately for America, Larry Elder never had to ambush Alzheimer's patients to score pathetic points against his opposition, as Michael Moore did in ""Bowling for Columbine"".  I guess you really don't need to rely on propaganda and ambushing the disabled when you have facts & history on your side.",1130544000,74,2377,5.126943005181347
2311906,5,B0009PW03Q,"This is a documentary based on facts and interviews with experts. He interviews people (on both sides of gun control) and shows how misinformed most people really are. There are some mispellings and technical bloopers in the CD, but hey, Larry Elder mortgaged his house to produce this film. All gun owners should buy it.

The reviewers who trashed this here on Amazon were predictable. I'll bet they didn't even watch it. These guys are panty-wearing liberals who drive Volvos with 'Kerry for President"" bumper stickers on them. I see them every day.",1130112000,22,551,4.924731182795699

As a lifetime IRA member I am proud of you for fighting the trend of blaming the hammer for the smashed thumb.  You clearly identify how this issue is tied to a group of socialists who have their own agenda.  The important statistics you provide make your position even more compelling.

Larry attempts to get down to the root causes of violence and talks about the vast number of lives that are saved every year thru the law-abiding ownership of guns, and how we never hear about it in the main stream press.

He interviews many different people: victims of violent crime, police officers, gun shop owners/instructors, anti-gun activists, lawyers, ex-gang bangers, historians, professors, and yes Michael Moore briefly.

Larry actually picked a bad name for this movie because it's misleading.  They actually spend very little time talking to Moore or attacking Bowling for Columbine. Maybe 10 minutes of the film is spent on directly attacking Moore. The rest of it has nothing to do with Michael Moore, which I thought was a very good thing.

Moore concluded that America has ""too many guns"", but put it into the correct context.  Do you really need to carry an automatic weapon with you whenever you leave your home?  Your answer would probably be a definite yes if you lived in New Orleans during the aftermath of Katrina under the threat of violence from gangs that raped, robbed, and burned, but what about the rest of America?

The network news only provides coverage of gun crime, you moron.  The left leaning, socialist, anti-Constitutional mainstream media does not report any self defense uses.

If guns are outlawed, then the bloody criminals are the ONLY ones with guns!!! Common sense?

If you really watch the film from start to finish, I believe you will find it a very worthwhile film filled with insightful and surprising ideas.",1123545600,60,403,4.373333333333333
2311934,4,B0009PW03Q,"How many years have we been told that guns are bad?  How many of us believe this without ever challenging ourselves as to why we believe it?  Most of us are lucky enough to have never been in a situation where a gun could have changed the outcome of a horrific event in our lives such as, ""if I had a gun I may have never been raped"", ""if I had a gun I wouldn't have seen my parents being killed in front of my own eyes"".  We typically aren't forced to really think about protecting ourselves so we live our lives happily in a daze.

Year after year we have allowed our elected officials, who work for us and suppossedly represent us, take away our constitutional right to protect ourselves.

I hoped that Larry would have proposed a scenario to the nay-sayers on the street..imagine you are shopping at a grocery store in an idyllic suburban community and a person takes out a Samurai sword and starts slicing people to death with it.  I'm in the store and I am in the same aisle as you.  The attacker starts running towards you, you're next to die.  What do you do?..run!! Of course.  Now imagine that just two minutes earlier I gave you this interview and in it I mentioned that I always carry a gun.  Now, the attacker is coming after you, you're next to die, I'm still in the aisle what do you do?  You scream, Larry shoot the guy!! Of course.

Seem crazy?  A few years ago at an Albertson's in Irvine, CA an employee came to the store and killed several people with a Samurai sword.  The would be victims were throwing cans of tuna fish at him.  Eventually it was a gun that took him down and stopped the carnage.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with being able to protect yourself. Larry, thank you for reminding me that it is OK.  It is ignorant to think that nothing bad will ever happen to you so you are allowed to be indifferent.

The only negative comment I have is that I wish that he would have spent more time on the English man who was sent to prison, with a charge of murder, for shooting two burglars in his house that had been broken into 7 times.  This story infuriated me and I wanted to know more.",1123286400,54,2123,4.249376558603491
2311935,5,B0009PW03Q,"Larry, I know you read the reviews on Amazon--you read some on your show the other day.  Just letting you know I pre-ordered the movie the first time I heard you say it was available.  I'm a 19-year-old student at UC Irvine and, Larry, you're the only teacher I listen to.  All these liberal loon professors spend their time in the classroom preaching Michael Moore's brand of illogical garbage.  My recourse comes at 3 PM every day--Sage time.  Keep making films and putting the liberals' feet to the fire.  You're the best, Larry.",1122163200,,532,4.666666666666667
8065279,5,B0009PW03Q,Phenomenal documentary that shows both sides and features both experts and common people examining a difficult issue.  Larry Elder is wise and fair.,1484092800,,148,5.434782608695652
8065280,5,B0009PW03Q,Very factual movie.,1423699200,,19,5.666666666666667
8065281,5,B0009PW03Q,This is a great documentary that should be viewed by more people. I happened to hear about it on the radio so I decided I wanted to watch it. I'm really glad I bought it! Michael Moore should be ashamed of himself for making movies that do not give full details! Larry Elder is a truthful Patriotic citizen! Kudos to him for trying to get the truth about mainstream media out!,1407888000,,376,4.309859154929577
8065282,5,B0009PW03Q,"Michael Moore is such a smug, self-righteous, Left-Wing phony and Larry Elder spend two hours telling us why. It should be noted that Larry Elder has invited Moore on to his radio program and Moore has NEVER had the guts to do it. Another case of the Truth to a Liberal being like Kryptonite to Superman.

The Left-wing media has 'lionized' this BIG FAT LIAR for years and tried to marginalize Mr. Elder, whom we really ought to be seeing more of, except that Elder goes against the Left-Wing media narrative because he's a Right-Wing black man and the only thing that scares the media even more than a Right-Wing black man is a Right-Wing black women! Let's hear it for Star Parker or Dineen Borelli. Buy this movie, especially if you're a liberal who believes all the baloney put out by the Left-Wing media and the phony anti-gun organizations.",1385510400,,846,4.64
8065283,5,B0009PW03Q,I love Larry Elder - good statistics on the second amendment and why gun ownership by responsible and law abiding citizens protects them and not criminals.,1385337600,,155,5.0
8065284,3,B0009PW03Q,I bought this to see what my talk radio station what talking about. I guess... :-)  It's a REDBOX VHS in my opinion. LOL,1365638400,,120,4.0
8065285,4,B0009PW03Q,"I think this movie does a good job exposing people Like Michael Moore and their failing attempt and logic to remove the second amendment.  In many cases, owning a gun has saved lives.",1340236800,,183,4.545454545454546
8065286,4,B0009PW03Q,Larry knows how to weave a story.  Very good movie.  I don't know why I didn't view it earlier.  A must see!,1327190400,,108,3.8181818181818183
8065287,5,B0009PW03Q,Get smacked in the face with some libertarian common sense.  An excellent defense of the second amendment and another counter to Michael Moore's sensationalist nonsense.,1326672000,,169,5.76
8065288,3,B0009PW03Q,"I had higher hopes for this DVD. I had followed Larry's progress and hype for this. I think he was on track, and I agree with his views (not Michael Moore's) but I think the end product could have been more polished. I wish Larry well.",1273104000,,235,4.130434782608695
