8427119,3,B004EL5N7G,An okay movie. A copy of another movie from the early 70's - the superhit Saccha Jhootha featuring Rajesh Khanna. That one was fun and decent. This one is violent and crass. I prefer to watch the movie that inspired Don.,1437782400,,220,4.390243902439025

8427121,5,B004EL5N7G,"Don is a great film its different to other most indian films. Right from the start the first thing that thrills you about this film is the dynamic title music. Its so inspiring and puts you in a good mood for rest of the film. Amitabh's acting is good as allways and his acting from serious to comedy to serious is super. Zeenat Aman is a tough cat in this. I reccomend young people to watch AB movies they are entertaining just as they were when they was first released. Good supporting cast from Pran. Strong role of Iftikar and that sexy Helen doing best for what she's good at. The fight scene at the end is well performed and executed.his is another classic movie by Bachchan. The range of acting that he shows in this movie is amazing. I have seen no other actor do that without changing the look extensively. Basically he portrays three different characters in the movie. One is stylish and loathsome Don, second is endearing beatle-chewing street singer, and third of the goofy impostor of Don. AB proves he is the best actor ever. The music rocks. And Zeenat looked the coolest ever. The whole plot is interesting and entertaining. Every character has an important part. Don is the cult movie today just because of Amitabh and its music. The opening scene with Amitabh wearing yellow shades is too cool and the casting music outstanding.his movie has to be one of the best thrillers of the 70's and it still packs a punch today. The reason is simple, you think you know the whole story then suddenly the plot twists leaving you all shaken up. The script by Salim Javed was absolutely superb. Amitabh excelled in a role he was born to play. Zeenat Aman provided good support as his love interest. Even Pran lent fantastic support. The action scenes were very well executed. The songs were simply mind blowing. My favourites were Khaike paan banaraswala and Mein hoon don. I saw the remake recently and to my surprise I was not disappointed. This movie ranks amongst the best thrillers Bollywood has ever made.",1302480000,3,2017,4.621169916434541
