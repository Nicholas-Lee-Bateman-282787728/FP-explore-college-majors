2876648,4,B000RXZL18,Unlike some of Denise's other dvd's this one has excellent instruction and encouragement.  Not like the old Denise workouts where she is practically shouting at you.  I use this dvd on easy days when I don't feel up to pushing myself and I still feel like I had an adequate workout depending on the weight I've used.,1202342400,48,316,4.526315789473684
2876649,5,B000RXZL18,"I was looking for something to give me a workout with weights. I happened apon this DVD at a store the other day.

I have to say love this video!  You'll get a pretty good workout doing this. (I had my Polar F6 heart rate monitor on and it said I had burned up 250 calories for the 30 minutes - upper body segments warm-up/cool down - I did today. Not bad!)

I LOVE LOVE LOVE how you can customize your workout by picking and choosing which 5 minute toners you would like to do for your workout session. That comes in handy if you don't have the time to do the whole video our would like to break up your workouts.

I recommend this DVD to any beginner/moderate exerciser like myself!",1201737600,28,684,4.159090909090909
2876650,4,B000RXZL18,"I bought this DVD on a whim (along with several others) one day after I had decided I was going to get in shape starting then and there. Understand that it's a toning video, and with any toning exercises, if you do not do cardio, you aren't going to see major results.  That aside, I think this is a good toning workout.  I am moderately active anyway, and there have been days I've done this DVD (alternating between 3 or 5 lb weights) and I've been too sore to move the next day.

I've been doing this workout for about 4 weeks (mixed in with cardio or pilates), and although you can't see physical results as of late, if I flex, you can see the muscles this DVD has produced.

I also like that you can customize your workouts based on time crunch, or what you would like to target, in a specific sequence.

As far as Denise goes, if you can concentrate on the workout rather than her, you won't be as annoyed by her and her off-kilter instructions.  Plus, after you've done it about 3 times, you'll be used to her jumping around and know what's coming next anyway.",1201651200,5,1067,4.2835820895522385
2876651,5,B000RXZL18,"I do aerobics every day and weights 3 times a week and this workout is great!  I have to modify some of the moves due to my fibromyalgia and bad back, but when I am done with the workout, I can tell it is working.  This is one strength training workout that keeps the heart rate up there and you really work up a sweat.  Sue D.",1198368000,19,327,3.8507462686567164
2876652,5,B000RXZL18,"Great workout, I like that you can pick which areas you want to work on each day.  The workouts are short, but she makes you work hard.  Great for all levels because you can change how heavy your weights are.",1195171200,9,208,4.175
2876653,5,B000RXZL18,"People make fun of Denise Austin, but, hey, this workout is one of the best for toning.  It seems deceptively easy; she doesn't spend that much time on any exercise, but she covers all the muscle groups.  It doesn't take long to see some really good results (like goodbye ""old lady arms."")",1193443200,85,289,4.538461538461538
2876654,4,B000RXZL18,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to find a weight training video.  It does a good job, especially the Abs portion.  Denise is a little keyed up for this video.  Lots of cheering you on.  That's okay, but sometimes it's like ""Shut Up and let me work out!""  Some of the legs portion is not as challenging as I would have liked it to be.  It is easy on the knees though.  Make sure you have a chair ready for the legs bit and 2-5 pound dumbells before starting.  I started with 2's and went to 5's after a couple of days.  Also nice that you don't need a lot of room for jumping around, this is not that kind of DVD.  More concentrated on movement and quality of form.  Great video to combine with cardio.",1191974400,66,704,4.065693430656935
2876655,5,B000RXZL18,"GOOD VIDEO, IF YOU WANT SOME QUICK TONING IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THIS IS THE VIDEO TO USE",1191456000,8,92,3.65
2876656,5,B000RXZL18,This is an all around great work out.  It works every major muscle group.  I like it because five minutes is a manageable amount of time to work one muscle group.  I would recommend this work out to a friend.,1190678400,29,208,4.15
2876657,3,B000RXZL18,"Being realistic, there isn't any chance of any big benefit of this dvd if you only do one five minute routine.  You have to put at least two - three workouts together to be of any use.  Having said that, this is OK to put at the end of another workout you do, or after going for a long walk or swim or something.  Each segment targets a particular trouble spot you might have like arms, chest, shoulders or back for example.  You can choose to do any portion in any order.  She uses regular kinds of moves to get the job done, and if you put them all together, then this isn't too bad of a workout.  The one other thing I can't get over is Denise being over over over enthusiastic all the time.  She's way over the top and can be very distracting.  I'm sure she'd motivate beginners but for more advanced exercisers, then this may not be the dvd you're looking for.
Easy to do and a workout you can fit in any time, give this a go if you're a beginner - I'm sure you'll find some benefit to it.  For more advanced exercisers, steer clear and try something more challenging.",1187827200,31,1073,4.169902912621359

2876659,4,B000RXZL18,Most of the exercises aren't too vigorous.  The ones requiring some stretching I skip.  I use the tense-and-release exercises.  It's fun and I am getting results.,1490313600,,162,5.153846153846154
2876660,5,B000RXZL18,Oh my goodness this workout is intense!  I have been working out everyday for almost two months solid and thought I was prepared for this now. I did the whole workout it was a challenge and l like that and I also liked the all the different methods but I have been sore to the point it's hard to walk for two days but I'm not complying it obviously works lol!,1487808000,,359,4.056338028169014

2876671,5,B000RXZL18,I bought this DVD in March and have been faithfully working out for the last 13 weeks.  I'm 61 and wanted to strengthen my back and get rid of some of my flabby underarms and stomach.  I've had used a Denise Austin video and the past and had success with it.  I usually abandon working out after 6 or 8 weeks but I am feeling much better and have more stamina than I did in the past.  My back doesn't hurt as soon as it used to when I am shopping.  I've had to adapt some of the exercises until I am stronger but am working on pushing to do them the way Denise does.  This video has made a huge difference.,1465776000,12,606,3.9262295081967213

It's a really good workout to do all at once, but if you're pressed for time you can tailor your workouts and still squeeze in 5 or 10 minutes, e.g. work your arms and legs in the morning (10 minutes) and then work another body that evening or the next day - I really like that feature.

I had been looking for a weight training DVD to use on alternate days when I'm not doing Cardio. I love this because 5 mins I can do and also I get to chose what workouts I do that day.

Also - if you have 'foot' issues - this workout isn't 'plank heavy' - which is nice.  There is a little bit of that - but not much.  I plan to buy the DVD because we had so many problems with the Instant Video version - you can't customize, rewind or fast-forward with Instant Video - and it kept buffering - then starting over - very frustrating.

2876688,3,B000RXZL18,"I think when it comes to reviewing and evaluating workout DVD's, the reviews are all relative to what we all like when we exercise and how often we exercise.  I am creeping up into my 70's and have been in to girl's/women's sports since high school in GAA (Girl's Athletic Association).  I enjoy exercise and have many DVD's I use.  Denise Austin was one of my first ""at home exercise DVD's"" and I enjoyed it.  Nice and energetic called Burn Fat Fast (Two 20 min workouts) with subscripting (Great feature for individuals who are deaf).

Having said all this, the Hit the Spot:  10 five-minute Target Tones might be good for individuals just getting into an exercise routine.  Not that the workouts are necessarily easy if you have not moved certain parts of the body, but a beginning.  I find I enjoy this type of exercise DVD for times when I am kinda thinking I am not in the mood to exercise but I know I need  to just ""move my body"".  At 69, this is something I have to do ALL the time as I am aging.  I had a few ""ughs & ouches"" from some of the moves on this DVD.  As for me, I am grateful to be a female living in America and I can freely exercise!

I do not think this DVD is for serious, must have and must do 12 reps, 5 times kind of exercisers.",1429747200,9,1256,4.140495867768595

I actually like Denise Austin  and own her other DVD's and have given great reviews. This one had me looking at the time and praying it would be over soon. For someone who hates working out already this is not a good sign. It was very boring and I am very much a beginner; it just did not make me want to work out.,1426291200,,434,3.9885057471264367

The other small complaint for me was she goes to the floor and back to standing over and over In most sets which I find a little annoying ( maybe because of my age).  She uses weights in all the sets which is fine but unexpected.  I will use it occasionally as an addition to the aerobic workouts from other videos.  I love Denise and have many of her workouts.

I actually lost weight, my appearance warranted weight loss compliments, and I felt stronger! Don't be fooled, she is not Jillian Michaels, but her less intense, equally effective workouts are just as great! I now do spin, zumba, and light weights, but am buying this Core Complete video, because it was such a great tool during winter when I don't want to drive to the gym. ALSO: Watch your favorite tv show with this video on low volume on a laptop or nearby computer. It's so easy and repetitive, you can mute it on a nearby screen and follow along easily while watching something you really want.

2876723,3,B000RXZL18,I like the being able to define what areas you are going to work on each session.  But the pass in which the trainer goes is to much for me.  I am unable to keep up.,1397001600,,165,3.5555555555555554
2876724,5,B000RXZL18,It is amazing how these 5 minute toners can make a difference. I like that it lets you customize what you want to do  in your routine. I like Denise Austin work outs.,1396396800,,166,4.03030303030303
2876725,5,B000RXZL18,For 10 mintues a day you can do something to help you look better. Denise Austin does not disappoint in this one. You will feel the burn!,1394409600,2,137,4.111111111111111
2876726,5,B000RXZL18,These target toners are great.  I feel they are all challenging and great for beginner and intermediate level excersizers. I would buy again.,1394064000,,141,5.130434782608695
2876727,5,B000RXZL18,I love this workout! Denise is easy to follow but you feel how what you are doing actually works and can see it too :),1393200000,,118,3.76
2876728,5,B000RXZL18,This is a great video.  I am busy with two kids and full time school and it is great because I can do a short 10-min workout.,1392681600,,125,3.6296296296296298
2876729,5,B000RXZL18,"I liked that you could choose to do all the upperbody workouts, or all the lower body - or all the abs- with 1 click.  The exercises were fun to do, Denise is constantly giving tips & motivation through the workouts, and they work.  I'be been working out since I was 32 years old, now I'm 56, and it's hard to find something new, challenging & differant, and these workouts were all that.  I would definately recommend these workouts to everyone.",1391385600,3,446,4.481481481481482
2876730,5,B000RXZL18,I tried Jillian and love her but her moves are too hard on my joints (I am 38). I knew I could count on going back to Denise. I always enjoy her workouts. She isn't trying to kill you. She is careful when standing up or moving down onto a mat. I and it works. I love a hard core work out but it doesn't always have to be that way to get results.,1390348800,7,345,3.675675675675676
2876731,5,B000RXZL18,Love to add in the abs after a cardio work out.  Great for hitting any muscles you missed during your core work out.  Also works well if you customize a work out for target areas.,1384646400,,179,4.085714285714285
2876732,4,B000RXZL18,"This video does have very short sessions that include effective moves. As my time is limited, spending twenty minutes a day doing these great exercises makes me feel better.",1383696000,,173,5.0
2876733,5,B000RXZL18,"Even when I'm feeling lazy, I can usually still talk myself in to at least five minutes... And then another five minutes... So on. I love all the lower body workouts!",1383091200,,166,4.387096774193548
2876734,1,B000RXZL18,very disappointed in purchase of three dvds by Denise Austin (ie belly fat blast and ten minutes points) cannot see anything on both dvds when it is place in my dvd player.  Very poor pictures,1383004800,,192,4.485714285714286
2876735,4,B000RXZL18,"If you are doing a program that's core intensive, and looking to work arms, chest, other areas on the off days while resting your abs, this is perfect. You can pick just the segments targeting the areas you'd like to work, and skip the ones you are trying to rest.

Have some hand weights handy. None, if you're recovering from any kind of upper body injury. 3 pounders if you're starting out, and 5 pounders if you're accustomed to weight while working out. If you can easily do 10-20 (real) push ups, you may even consider 7-10 pound hand weights.

Due to the shortened segments, you're not going really have a warm up period, or detailed instructions. You'll be up and down and shifting around on the floor (mat, carpet) pretty quickly, but again, you're trading these things for gaining the compressed, convenient workout time. I kept thinking while I completed each, that it goes by so quickly, it would be perfect to substitute one or two segments in the morning on your way out the door to help wake up. You can knock 'em out in just about the time it takes to prepare and drink a cup of coffee. Some don't feel too challenging at the time, but the muscles that were sore the next day let me know how effective they really had been.",1382572800,,1239,4.453744493392071
2876736,4,B000RXZL18,I like this video because you can mix and match and have different types of workouts for the duration of time you want.,1382227200,,119,4.217391304347826
2876737,5,B000RXZL18,"This is a nice workout because it is broken up into section, which keeps me from getting bored. It is not the most challenging workout for experienced people, but you can increase the challenge by using heavier weights and increasing the tempo of the exercises. Yes, Denise Austin is very perky, and this could get on some people's nerves, but for me, she makes me feel like I'm doing something great for my body, so I like it. This was fun!",1381104000,,441,4.45679012345679
2876738,4,B000RXZL18,"I like this DVD because it has options for shorter or longer workouts.  You pick the areas you want to work on and how many, each one is 5 minutes so if you have 15 you can do three areas, if you have more time you can do more.  There isn't much balancing required or need for workout equipment.  Perfect for working out at home in the living room.",1379635200,,348,4.0144927536231885
2876739,5,B000RXZL18,"I did customize my own workout when I got this video, as suggested on the cover. I started out with the lower body set, then built a workout using the warm up, chest firmer, and arm shaper. These exercises built upper body strength using weights. It was the first video I had shaping the upper body with weights and I got results. I noticed one day that my upper and lower arms were much more defined and I had little muscles!!! this was empowering for a senior citizen, believe me.
Denise Austin is my favorite person to work out with because she is so upbeat. She makes me feel that she woke up with a smile on her face, ready to face the world and work out while she is doing it. I love her encouragement and sunny personality.
These are good workouts because you can add to them or just do as many as you feel on any given day.",1378857600,3,831,4.167701863354037
2876740,5,B000RXZL18,Fairly easy workout. I usually alternate days of upper body and lower body toning. I like the easy warmup and cool down. She also has a few exercises at the end you can do at your desk.,1378512000,,185,4.027027027027027
2876741,1,B000RXZL18,I enjoy Denise Austin workouts but don't care for the new style of formatting. The timed segments are too short and interrupted.,1378425600,,128,4.863636363636363
2876742,5,B000RXZL18,I like this Denise Austin Hit The Spot workout because she focuses on different problem areas of the body that requires exercise.,1378166400,,129,4.909090909090909
2876743,5,B000RXZL18,"I did this DVD yesterday (the day it arrived in the mail) and now I'm feeling it. It's a really great DVD for toning and also has the added benefit of doing exercises that protect your muscles and joints. I got it to expand my options on the weight lifting routines I already do, but I was very happy when I got up this morning a bit sore. I can all ready tell this DVD is going to tighten up a lot of areas that were getting neglected. A lot of people dislike Austin's voice and find her either too cheerful or belittling. That is not the case. If you take the time to listen, she's actually very funny and is taking the stance of it being better to laugh in your workout than to get discouraged. She's clearly an expert in her field (I mean just look at her!)and that goes to show her disposition and approach to health work. Being positive and humorous go a long way in achieving sustainable results. I'm very glad I purchased this DVD. I can mix routines when I'm short on time, or I can do the whole thing. I like being able to tailor my exercise and at five minute intervals you do a lot of focused work but you don't feel overwhelmed by them--because you know the segment is only five minutes long and you can survive five minutes until the next segment working on a different set of muscles.",1377561600,4,1299,4.220883534136546
2876744,5,B000RXZL18,I love the 10 minute segments that allow me to have as short or long of a work-out as I want.  Usually do this before I get ready for work and the weight segments are great!,1377043200,,173,3.8055555555555554
2876745,5,B000RXZL18,These exercises are great any time. They don't take too much time but give you a thorough workout. I just do one of them a day and see results already.,1376006400,,151,4.066666666666666
2876746,4,B000RXZL18,"The total video is over an hour, and many of us don't have an hour to exercise. The upper body is worked in the first half of the segments and the lower body the last half.  I usually do upper body one day and lower body another.  I wish it were easier to break up in separate segments when time is short.",1375574400,,305,3.903225806451613
2876747,5,B000RXZL18,I love her she is a realistic woman that has a family as we all do. Her work outs are great!,1375574400,,92,3.4285714285714284
2876748,5,B000RXZL18,"The beginning series are about the upper body, arms, chest, back - this is great.  I am 49 and need to tone and build some muscle - these are hitting the spot - fast toning sessions that don't take up a lot of time.  I am already seeing the difference after 4 days.  Thank you Amazon Prime - Netflix does not have any work out tapes streaming.",1375401600,,343,4.08955223880597
2876749,5,B000RXZL18,"This is a great workout! I saw results in muscle tone after 2 workouts. It's not for beginners and may need some working up to. I feel a lot stronger after doing this 2-3 Times a week, alternating days with other workouts. I used to work out for only 30 minutes. This has built up my stamina so that I can handle an hour just as easily. I'm still drenched in sweat, but no longer feel like collapsing at the end.",1374624000,,412,4.098765432098766
2876750,4,B000RXZL18,i thought i was going to die the first time i did the a few workouts but after the first time you get better at it. Just take it easy and don't do them all at once. the stretching is pretty intense. I like the feature for customizing. You truely discover all the muscles you don't use. It's a good target toning work out.,1374105600,,321,4.03125
2876751,4,B000RXZL18,I like the fact that I can choose the workouts and the orders in which to complete them.  Definitely mixes things up!,1373328000,,117,4.318181818181818
2876752,5,B000RXZL18,What a great workout!  Each workout is intense and I can feel it working..  It is great to mix and match the workout I want for the body parts desired and do it in a short period of time.  There is no better way to work out than that - fast and efficient!!!,1372291200,,257,3.811320754716981
2876753,5,B000RXZL18,"I miss Denise Austin's daily workout on TV, so I was happy to get this DVD.  Perfect for my needs.  Quick and specific.",1371340800,,119,4.130434782608695
2876754,5,B000RXZL18,Great condition. Helps get in shape burn lots of calories. Target tone one specific area. My family uses it too.,1370304000,,112,4.65
2876755,4,B000RXZL18,"Although I find Denise a bit ""cheesy"" in this DVD, I still find myself using it every week. The 5 minute segments are quick and enjoyable; but not super-challenging. I started with a 5 lb. weight and found it to be perfect. 2-3 lb. weights wouldn't do the upper body segments any justice. I can feel it working from the slight soreness in my upper back & legs the next day. She does try to motivate through the DVD - but hearing her tell us how almost every single move is her ""favorite move"" & ""Thhhaaaaattt's great"" can wear on you a bit. I just focus on the exercises & add an extra move or two while she transitions. I'm not sure, maybe I find her just annoying enough to keep watching!",1369526400,6,690,4.234848484848484
2876756,5,B000RXZL18,"It is awesome, if you are looking to work on particular areas of your body. Also, the exercises are relatively easy to do.",1368144000,,122,4.3478260869565215
2876757,5,B000RXZL18,"I very much love how I can pick what sections of my body I want to work on during my workout. I was disappointed that the abs section was small but the other sections definitely made up for it! Upper body workout is my favorite and the exercises can be modified with heavier weights as you progress.
Denise Austin's motivation talks are also good because they keep me engaged during the exercises. Some people may not like it but I do.",1368057600,,435,4.382716049382716
2876758,5,B000RXZL18,I am absolutely in love with Denise Austin's style of workouts. She targets trouble area with fun and challenging exercises.,1367107200,,124,5.25
2876759,4,B000RXZL18,I'm 58 and have knee and rotator cuff issues. This tape works every muscle of my body without causing harm. I do this tape 3-4 times a week in addition to walking 5 miles and I feel stronger.,1366934400,2,191,4.052631578947368
2876760,5,B000RXZL18,Got a nice burn goin this morning without being too exhausted. She has a very relaxing voice and a good style,1366416000,,109,4.238095238095238
2876761,5,B000RXZL18,"This one is great if you are trying to get in everything and not sure what to pick.  A few exercises for each area.
No jumping around but really is a great workout.",1366329600,2,164,3.9696969696969697
2876762,4,B000RXZL18,I love that Evey exercise is simple yet effective...you wouldnt think using only 3-5lb weights would make a difference but it does,1366329600,,130,4.954545454545454
2876763,5,B000RXZL18,This is great if you are looking for very specific spots to tone.  I'm able to break it into 2 segments - upper and lower body for quick early morning workouts.,1366243200,,160,4.161290322580645
2876764,5,B000RXZL18,"If you're not that young and looking for a workout you can customize, which doesn't take too much time (five minutes is longer than you think when you're working out) and is just challenging enough, this DVD is absolutely IT.  Once you get more in shape and you want to workout longer, all you have to do is repeat the segment. I run this DVD and then I use my Chair Gym for resistance work. The slim-your-waist exercises are awesome and really get at those flabby love handles. I can't praise this DVD enough.",1365897600,,510,4.425531914893617
2876765,5,B000RXZL18,"Each one of these 10 workouts that are only 5 minutes long do work and hit that spot your working on.  My daughter and I are seeing the results because it works and you are worth it.  Make sure you have a pair of hand held weights either 5 pound, 7, or 10 and a mat and your ready to get started by shaping your muscles because if you do not you will loose muscle. Challenge yourself today!",1365120000,,390,3.9871794871794872
2876766,5,B000RXZL18,"I ordered this after reviewing a short clip of it on a popular online video site. I am always looking for ways or tools to keep myself motivated and espeically improve on my body tone and muscle. This workout cd alows you to select from a variety of workouts and mix them together to complete a full workout according to the time you desire. I love that. It also offers variety and weight training which I can assure you aids greatly in weight loss which is another reason I bought this. Denise offers a ""unique"" product and from her other workout cds that I bought before this one I can say she is ""very encouraging"" and makes it easy to understand and it does help me. The first time I did this mix I felt it! It really challenges you but its worth it! I cant wait to use it again today.",1363651200,,789,4.197368421052632
2876767,5,B000RXZL18,"Denise Austin has a great workout.  It works all the important muscles.  She has a rhythm that is not to fast or slow.  She is very motivational as well.

2876769,4,B000RXZL18,The five minute segments makes it feel like you are devoting less time. Focus is on technique and not quantity. I definitely felt the burn a couple days later.,1362268800,,159,4.517241379310345
2876770,4,B000RXZL18,This is a great DVD. The only thing is that she indicates you can set bookmarks for sections you like. I couldn't figure out how to do that on the Kindle????,1360454400,,157,4.096774193548387
2876771,4,B000RXZL18,This DVD is pretty easy to follow. Sometimes listening to it over and over again (using it 4-5 days a week) can get a bit monotonous but overall it's a good purchase and the price was right!,1359763200,,190,4.162162162162162

2876779,5,B000RXZL18,"The video in it's entirety is a very well pieced-together total-body workout. Each section is divided into targeting a certain part of the body and flows so well making the ten-minute section fly by quick and transition smoothly into the next target location. This makes it easy to continue on completing the entire video (50+ minutes for a total body workout.) Highly recommended as it combines functional training to target those muscles that are rarely used, with flexibility which will lengthen the muscles.",1356825600,,511,5.168674698795181

And the video cuts to standing and floor exercises so quickly that you have to have memorized the workout and know what position you need to be in before the next exercise starts or you will, literally, miss half of the repetitions. You could get about the same results by just standing up, sitting down, standing up, sitting down, standing. . .Horrible.",1329609600,8,484,4.511363636363637

I found this DVD, which is excellent and challenging. I began to see results within 3 days of doing the DVD. I still do the Power Zone, but I incorporate this one for the muscle toning :o). You will not regret getting this DVD. It is excellent!! 5 stars. Thank you Denise, once again!!",1321574400,,443,4.285714285714286
2876787,4,B000RXZL18,"This is my first Denise Austin DVD. She uses some unique exercises that I don't see often. The only down side is Denise moves fairly quickly, so increasing the weights might not be do-able. The customization feature gives you the option of doing the exercises YOU want to do. Personally, I like her style, and her sincerity. I smile when I'm doing this DVD. Her cueing is a little off at times; I can live with that. I need the encouragement she gives, too. That's a plus for me. I do wish she would use all ""shapes and sizes"". This is a DVD I look forward to using..no dread factor.

By the way, the sound was deficient because it was mute at the beginning of each item. I complained at Amazon and I received promptly a good one at no cost. Thanks a lot!",1299974400,,395,3.95

You have a menu pop up and you have the option of checking off as many 5 min workouts you want or you can do all of them.

While some of her other DVD's out there are rushed, hard to follow and those who are exercising with her look lost, this is not the case with this DVD.  As the title states there are 10 different workouts to mix and match with a warm up and a cool down.  I recommend it.  As you progress, you can always add heavier weights in all the workouts.  Welcome Denise into your home with this one, you won't be sorry you did.",1270771200,3,500,4.061224489795919

2876798,5,B000RXZL18,I have purchased about 6 Denise Austin DVDs prior to this one; this is by far the best. All of the exercises are easy enough for even a beginner. The ABS portion is great. I've been using this for one week and I feel great. Unlike other workout dvds; I look forward to doing the exercises again.,1265068800,,295,4.192982456140351
2876799,5,B000RXZL18,"First of all Denise's face looks gorgeous on the cover.  I think they must have taken a picture from high school or college because she doesn't look this young any more in the face, but she is still a pretty woman.  Her body looks great as always which is very motivating to me.  Looking at her makes me believe if you work hard enough you can transform your body into a better after baby body. However, I don't know anyone personally who can get rid of the C-section pouch.  On to the workout itself...If you are crunched for time this one will work for you because those 5 minute segments go so fast. Also, If you do cardio for the day but need to work a spot this is great for that as well.  I am a slim woman but I have thighs and I need to work them out alot and I can't always get that so it is no problem to just do a 5 minute segment on a day I am concentrating on cardio.  This is one of those videos that is a must have.  When I see it I feel like Denise has given us the secret moves that help Hollywood get those great bodies outside of the plastic surgeons and makeup artist as well as air brushing.",1262736000,4,1112,3.981981981981982
2876800,5,B000RXZL18,"My husband & I are in our 60s, and we both have had spinal surgery. We both have rotater cuff issues, but no surgery on that. We are each trying to lose about 15 pounds. We only started using Denise Austin's ""Hit the Spot"" a few weeks ago, and WOW!  My husband is truly amazed at the improvement in his golf game. Both of us have noticed the benefit to our shoulders (cuffs). I can already feel & see the difference, especially in my upper arms.

Perhaps very fit kids in their 20s & 30s want something more taxing than this, but we could barely do it badly the first few times. This is a thorough workout from head to toe. We are improving rapidly now. (And the school reunion is coming.)

We can both tell that our strength & flexibility, in fact our entire muscular structure, along with our tendons & joints have benefitted immensely from doing this workout 4 - 5 days a week. We do the whole thing at once, but that's just our choice. Try it! You'll be so proud of how you can improve your body with this cd.

We think 5 stars is not enough for this one, and we want oldsters to know that THEY can do it too! But prepare to SWEAT!

Thanks, Denise! You've made a huge difference in our lives.",1259452800,77,1196,4.182608695652174

I bought this DVD because I saw that there is only 5 minutes per toning workout. It seemed like a good way to start exercising. And I was right! I love this DVD because I can pick and choose which target areas I want to work on and it only takes 5 minutes for each one! I've been seeing results, especially in my arms. This video is perfect for people who don't have a lot of time to work out or who are just beginning like me. It is a good video to combine with some sort of cardio. I use this video every other day and do a cardio workout in between. I don't mind Denise Austin - sometimes it's nice to hear encouragement.",1242604800,3,750,4.040268456375839

Ladies this video really works. I have lost over 120 lbs so you can imagine how much loose skin I must have, right? Well after using this video for a month working out 3 days a week: Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays my skin has become tightened and toned! I can actually see my muscles! That is very exciting to me! If I keep this up I may not need to have that cosmetic surgery after all! How GREAT is that? I wish you all great results!",1242432000,33,638,4.237704918032787

The short duration of the sections was great for me because I get bored with exercises easily so this keeps my attention and Denise really encourages you throughout the workout.

Highly recommended!",1241913600,3,456,4.481927710843373

2876807,5,B000RXZL18,I love the fact that you can select as much or as little of a workout as you want each day! The five minutes for each workout go by so fast that I hardly notice and I don't get bored with my workout. It also has a very short intro and no preview information so you can get started with your workout right away.  This is very important to me.,1240531200,2,341,3.8714285714285714

2876809,5,B000RXZL18,"There are ten separate 5-minute workouts, plus a warm up and a cool down.  She also groups similar areas for a full workout: upper body, lower body and abs.  Her moves sometimes require a little more coordination, but after a few times doing the same ""5 minute target"" I can pick up the nuances.  There is not as much focus on utilizing weights as I was looking for but the plus side is that I can talk myself into a 20 minute focused workout much easier than a trip to the gym. For the price, well worth it!!",1238630400,,509,4.173469387755102
2876810,4,B000RXZL18,"This is the first Denise Austin DVD I've done and I'm very pleased with it.  The workouts are 5 minutes long, but they are targeted to 1 or 2 areas, so you actually feel like you've worked those muscle groups.  Something that I liked about this DVD is that she includes workouts for areas such as your chest and back, areas which I've found don't receive a lot of attention.  Also, I like the fact that the workouts are only 5 minutes long.  I feel that it motivates me to do more workouts and to work harder than if I did a continuous 15 minute segment.  I do have a few words of caution, though.  Since the workouts are short, she does not discuss proper technique.  If you are an exercise beginner, I don't feel like this is a good DVD to start with.  Learn proper technique first.  Also, the routines require you to change positions frequently.  For example, at times you are standing, next you're on your hands and knees, next you're laying on your back, etc.  If you have knee or back problems, I feel like this may not be the best video for you.  But overall, I think that this is a very good addition to many workout collections.",1237593600,12,1137,4.311320754716981

2876813,4,B000RXZL18,"Having previewed this DVD I am struck by several things: first, I do not think I've ever seen more innovative moves or variations than on this DVD. she had a new twist on just about every familiar move.

Second, this workout was different in that she rarely, if ever, requires 12 reps. She just keeps moving quickly through a variety of exercises for one body part.

Third, speaking of the upper body workout, she only uses one pair of weights for all of the exercises, except for doubling up on one. I am used to using different weights for various exercises. For example I would use 10 lbs for biceps and 5 lbs for shoulders, but it's all the same here. Maybe it's OK to use just one set of weights for exerything considering how fast she moves between exercises.",1232064000,3,765,4.457142857142857
2876814,5,B000RXZL18,"Denise Austin proved again her ability to shape, cheer, and give results in ""10 minute target toners"". Before I bought this DVD from Amazon.com I have been doing ""30 day shred"" for about 4 weeks, and lost some ""winter fat"". However, after 60 minutes of Denise Austin routine I could feel practically every muscle in my body, while doing ""shred"" for 20 minutes I could feel my heart jumping up and down and not that much of a muscle work. Sweat is great in both workouts, so I prefer just add jumping jacks here and there doing ""10 minute target toners"" to make it a ""killer"".

The 5 minute segments are great.  Just when you think you're getting tired of one segment, you're finished.  I like using hand weights because when one set of weights gets easier, I can move up to a heavier weight and I definitely have seen results.  If you don't care for Denise Austin's upbeat personality, do not buy this DVD because if you didn't like her before, you won't like her now.  I like that she is so encouraging.

2876823,3,B000RXZL18,I liked the idea of doing five minute intervals of different muscle groups but some of these moves are insane!  I'm not in bad shape but I'm just not able to do some of what she is asking.  I'd rather do a full workout that is going to work for me than to stumble through a few intense moves.  She makes you work for those five mintues which is why I still rated it a three.  I can see the benefit of what she is asking and it gives me a goal to work toward but this is not for beginners by any means.,1211155200,3,501,3.7884615384615383

I am also unable to do high impact stuff due to issues with my ankle and this DVD doesn't contain all the jumping around that other exercise DVDs include.  I follow this routine everyday and have been able to build up to heavier weights and move on to other DVD's that I wouldn't have been able to do before.

Before kids i went to the gym regularly. I tried the first workout and while I was impressed with the customizable workouts, I wasn't impressed with Denise. There are not enough repetitions to feel much of a ""burn."" I'd have to replay each segment 3 or more times to get a good workout. Five minutes is definitely not enough time to make much of a difference in my body. Anyway, I'm going to try doing the segments each 3-4 times and see if that gives me a better workout.
