976508,5,6305178453,"This tape was a great suprise and a refreshing change from the Stone Cold silliness of other WWF tapes. Foley esentially shoots for the entire tape, talking about his friendship with Terry Funk and giving a blow-by-blow  description of his now imfamous Hell in the Cell match with the Undertaker.  Every wrestling fan who has fantasized about stepping into the  squared-circle can identify with Foley. If you are going to buy one WWF  this year, this is the one.",912556800,,462,4.810126582278481
976748,4,6305178453,the three faces of mick foley was a ok movie.  It had some good things in the movie i.e. undertaker vs mankind hell in a cell and it had some bad parts in it like when they did a long interview with jim ross and mankind.  (jim ross ended up with  mankinds fingers shuved down his throat). I was  satisfied with it.  WCW sux,923616000,,323,3.984375

976972,5,6305178453,"Mick Foley is truly one of the best wrestlers to ever come along. He is a hrdcore wrestler and I like him that way. Now this video is so great I cannot belive it. I would have prefered it if they would have had  highlights from some of his matches in Japan, But oh well what can you do ?  This video also shows him as the man that he realy is. This is almost a  bible to everyone(if it were on video) who loves hardcore wrestling.",914716800,,430,3.9195402298850577
7884354,5,6305178453,Along With Stone Cold Uncensored. Three Faces Of Foley was The Best Superstar Profile Of 1998. I had both tapes back in 1999 when I first started watching pro wrestling.

7884356,5,6305178453,"this is a very nicely done video of Dude Love, Cactus Jack, and Mankind. the interview with JR is funny too when Mankind gives him the Mandible Claw and pretends it wasn't him. if you're bored and feeling pity of you unmeaningly exicstence then take a small bit of humpferd of believing that somewhere out there in this crazy mixed-up universe of ours there's still a little but cool video called Three Faces of Foley",993168000,,417,4.573333333333333

7884358,5,6305178453,"The three faces of foley is a great insight into the life of Mick Foley (aka cactus jack, dude love and Mankind). i gave this video 5 stars for one reason - IT  ROCKED. i love Foley and the video was brilliant . iy you haven't already got it run out and buy it .

7884359,4,6305178453,"This is most definately a must have for all Mick Foley fans. It shows Mick Foley out of character telling 'the Hardy Boys' of his many highs with the WWF.  He discusses all three of his alter egos (Cactus Jack, Dude Love  and Mankind) he also talks of his friendship with Terry Funk.  There are  highlights of, his first appearence as Cactus Jack in the WWF against  Triple H, his first appearence as Dude Love, his Falls count anywhere match  against Terry Funk and of course the infamous 'Hell in the cell' match  against The Undertaker.  The only reason why i didn't give The three faces  of Foley 5 stars is because there was no footage of his Death matches in  Japan. But don't let this put you off it is a superb video and well worth  the money.",951436800,4,751,4.330935251798561
