2296009,1,B0009K8L3Y,I was so-o-o-o-o disappointed and upset when I received this DVD.  It was taped from the television and it was done poorly.  Do not buy this dvd.  It is a waste of money.  The one star is for actually RECEIVING the dvd -- nothing else.  A shameful misrepresentation.,1318723200,,266,4.458333333333333
2296010,4,B0009K8L3Y,"I saw this movie many, many years ago and loved it and wanted to have it for my collection. The only one available was a ""used"" one from someone. It was rated in ""excellent condition"".  Unfortunately, it was not. The movie is great, but the condition was bad. The music garbled and some of the words were slurred. If I had known that, I would not have ordered it.  I will not order ""used"" again.",1287705600,,395,4.253333333333333
2296011,1,B0009K8L3Y,"I was so looking forward to receiving this DVD - it's a TV movie i can remember from the early days of Alec Baldwin's acting career and was a good thriller . The quality of the DVD was absolutely apalling - it looked and sounded like it was taken from a very poor quality VHS video .

It's time that manufacturers of DVD's were made to state on the cover that the quality is poor and has not been digitised .",1200182400,3,408,4.037037037037037
2296012,2,B0009K8L3Y,"I obtained this movie by accident as I was looking for a UK movie of the same name published some three years earlier.

Having got the movie I settled down to watch it but was immediately put off by the poor quality picture and sound.

The plot was quite interesting and could provide the basis for a compelling drama along with an examination of the code of honour of officers in the armed forces and the dark reality of the underlying forces of repression in a largely puritanical society.

Sadly, this movie was not to provide that drama and although it does have it's moments it is largely a dissapointment but which could do with a large budget remake with an independent producer.

Could do better.",1198713600,,704,4.563492063492063
2296013,2,B0009K8L3Y,"I first saw this movie on the shelf and looking at the cast, felt that it would be an engaging event. Sorry to say, the copy looked like it was copied on a $ cheap machine, so the sound is barely audible at times and it winds up and down like a Godzilla horror festival. Sad to say that I will take this movie back to the store for a refund and write the distributor to let them know.. Good idea, bad copy....",1133568000,,409,3.9397590361445785
2296014,3,B0009K8L3Y,"SWEET REVENGE is a talky yet involving made for tv movie from the mid-80s.  Kevin Dobson (Knots Landing) is cast against type as an opportunistic womanizing major who gets a young Helen Hunt pregnant and arranges for an abortion.  When Hunt dies as a result, he shifts the blame to an earnest young soldier (Merritt Butrick) who comes to a tragic end.  14 years later we meet Butrick's sister (a young and engaging Kelly McGillis) who falls for Alec Baldwin, who just happens to be in Dobson's command. McGillis plans revenge on Dobson but when plans go awry, she must confront him from a different angle.  Hindered by an amateurish transfer, the movie suffers from its datedness, but with its tight plot and some convincing acting, it manages to be mildly provocative entertainment.",1125792000,4,783,4.864661654135339
8062309,4,B0009K8L3Y,I really liked this and watchd it many times. The problem was the age of the movie made it difficult to get a clear picture..,1524009600,,125,4.04
8062310,1,B0009K8L3Y,A fair movie.  The quality of this DVD was the worst I have ever had.  The entire movie was so dark I could hardly make out what was going on most of the time.,1521763200,,159,3.6470588235294117
8062311,3,B0009K8L3Y,"Not bad for TV. We get to see several future stars when they were not yet well known. Kelly McGillis, Helen Hunt and Alec Baldwin.

Baldwin is much too young (24 at the time) to wear the rank of Major.",1510272000,,201,4.025
8062312,4,B0009K8L3Y,Came quickly. The movie looks like it was taped from an old video tape still it's nice to see a like when he was younger. Though it's really her movie.,1506729600,,151,4.066666666666666
8062313,1,B0009K8L3Y,It was a very boring movie I was disappointed,1503273600,,45,4.111111111111111
8062314,3,B0009K8L3Y,this one is ok for old tv movie lovers or old alec Baldwin lovers when he was young.  the visual is grainy and the sound bouncy.  you can write the script before it happens and probably a lot better.  just don't expect a lot and you'll be happy.,1501718400,,245,4.0625
8062315,2,B0009K8L3Y,"Wasn't aware that this was a rated ""R"" movie so I gave it away without watching it. My adult son said it was based on a adult-content that we couldn't watch unless the movie was edited. What a shame, I like the Baldwins.",1465344000,,220,4.1395348837209305
8062316,1,B0009K8L3Y,"poor quality of movie, could not hear any of the audio. waste of my money. one star was too much of a rating.",1442188800,,109,3.782608695652174
8062317,4,B0009K8L3Y,"I have seent he movie before and wanted to get it on DVD - my old copy was VHS. I have always liked the movie, the movie is good but I was disappointed with the quality fo the dvd. The visual quality is poor and dark, but you can still see what is happening, but coudl have used betetr picture quality.",1399507200,,302,3.9672131147540983
