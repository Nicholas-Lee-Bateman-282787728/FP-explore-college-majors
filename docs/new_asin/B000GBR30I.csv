8130568,4,B000GBR30I,"This is actually two disks, with the first disk covering racing coverage from the late '90s up through about 2003, the second bridges the gap to more recent times.  It was fun to see some of the older bikes that many of us still ride out there gettin' it done. Or in many cases not getting anything done. The disks are broken down by type of terrain such as hills, mud, starting lines, etc...  These are age appropriate for any age rider.  The price is a great deal also.  These are much more expensive to buy straight from the distributer.  The set came within a week. Bottom line, if you enjoy offroad motorcycle racing in the woods type environment, then this is for you.",1307664000,,674,4.403225806451613

1) When you want to go riding and can't. It's just like being there on the trail. You will think you've been there. You'll grab your leg when say owe when you see some of tehse wipeouts.

2) You want to introduce someone to the sport. The is the real deal and you will laugh and flinch while you watch the helmet cam video. I find myself picking my feet up when I see rocks coming. It's so real.

It's the answer to the question: What is off road racing ?",1187308800,,498,3.96
