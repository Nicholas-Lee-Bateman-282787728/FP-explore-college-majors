8170005,3,B000MM2QPI,"No masterpiece, but a pleasant little love story.  The old science fiction writer is a believable character and, contrary to what I expected, does not seem to be based on any actual writer.",1509667200,,189,4.7272727272727275
8170006,4,B000MM2QPI,"This is a quirky and beguiling little film about a young couple and her father. The young man is a budding science fiction writer who idolizes his girlfriend's father, who just happens to be a giant in the world of sci-fi literature. The characters are likeable and the scenery (of the English countryside) is magnificent. Most of all, it's enjoyable to watch as the woman wonders about the intentions of her boyfriend and whether he's more interested in getting closer to her or getting her father to read his manuscript. Of note, actor Tom Wilkinson has a small role in the film. One small word of caution: the (relatively, by current standards) poor quality of the audio track makes the dialog a bit challenging to follow, especially for American ears.

All of these films are worth seeking-out, but somewhat difficult to locate as the majority were only ever released on VHS tape in 1986.",1390608000,2,2125,8.976525821596244
