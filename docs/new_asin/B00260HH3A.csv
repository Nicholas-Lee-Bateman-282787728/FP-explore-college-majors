Former star college basketball player decides to try volleyball and makes the finals on the AVP tour after one month of training and a little beach romance. I liked it better than I thought I would after reading about it in DIG Magazine. It's a good looking movie but sports movies often fall flat on being believable including stiff cameos from star athletes. Unrealistic game play at times. A scene outside a store with a bunch of TVs in the window forecasting the doom of the AVP's hot rookie seemed like an event from another era. What store still has TVs in the front window? Also, if you've ever wondered what happened to Jaleel ""Steve Urkel"" White, he manages the team. Any homage to Sideout made this much less original.",1262476800,2,794,4.598591549295775
3850318,1,B00260HH3A,"It's okay to watch and appreciate this movie if you're a beach volleyball fan, otherwise, you'll have no clue as to what's going on.  Very interesting story about beach volleyball players though.",1252713600,,195,5.09375
3850319,1,B00260HH3A,"We didn't expect this to be a great movie, but we did expect it to be watchable. The volume was all over the place. Soft talking - turn the volume up. Next scene, way louder - turn the volume down. We finally turned it off about half way through. We love volley ball, but this film is just not worth the effort.",1249344000,,311,4.032258064516129
3850320,4,B00260HH3A,"The movie isn't going to win an Oscar, but it's got heart... and lots of Vollyball. That was enough for me.

Kristin Cavallari isn't hard to look at either.",1247616000,3,156,4.379310344827586

8351579,2,B00260HH3A,"I like volleyball so that made it watchable. A lot of it was filmed near where I live so that was cool seeing local spots, but the film is nothing special. If you like beach volleyball, it's maybe worth a watch, if not skip it.",1473120000,,227,4.066666666666666

8351582,3,B00260HH3A,"Mindless nonsense, but kind of entertaining if you live in Manhattan or Hermosa Beach. Pretty much a remake of ""Side Out"".",1396051200,,122,4.857142857142857

8351584,3,B00260HH3A,I sent this to someone who is away from the South Bay where is was filmed and they liked it.,1377734400,,92,3.65
8351585,5,B00260HH3A,"Hey no one's gonna win an Academy award, but it's a friggin' Beach Volleyball movie!  For those of us who live to play - what's not to like?  Similar to ""Sideout"" from the 80's.  Wish they would make these movies where the protagonist doesn't have to whine so much before he learns to shut up and play and be a man already...a la the young Darth Vader who whined through Star Wars II & III incessantly.",1367712000,,402,4.2631578947368425
8351586,2,B00260HH3A,"Watched it on TV because I hung out on that beach for years and still play volleyball. The volleyball scenes weren't too good, edited to hide actors playing deficiencies no doubt. After this movie  came out the AVP beach volleyball league went bankrupt. Was it the movie's fault?",1326585600,,279,4.8125
8351587,4,B00260HH3A,I enjoyed this movie.  It is not an award winner and is a bit predictable.  That said it is still fun - a lot lf beautiful California scenes.  Those who enjoyed David Charvet from Bay Watch will enjoy this movie.  Honest effort in the acting.,1306972800,,242,4.311111111111111
