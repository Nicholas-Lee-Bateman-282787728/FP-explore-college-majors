7383877,5,B0145UQRY8,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie, but I really enjoy Fran Kranz.
I am glad I gave this very out-of-the-ordinary movie a try. It's sort of dry + dark humor mixed with a little bit of bloody ""horror.""
It's not an ""every day fare"" kind of movie. I found it to be quite original in concept and story-telling.

I recommend giving this movie a try, though it will not suit all tastes. If you like ""original"" material, this might be up your alley.",1473552000,,452,4.255813953488372

7383879,5,B0145UQRY8,"Whoa!  This is how you blend comedy with horror!  Actually maybe not since there's clearly more emphasis on comedy.  Bloodsucking Bastards is about a group of office workers who are all basically really silly (Fran Kranz and Joey Kern's characters in particular).  They don't take their job seriously at all.  They throw spitballs at each other, talk about sports bets, mess around on the computer, etc.

The only time the discussion gets serious is when Emma Fitzpatrick's character brings up the date with Fran that occurred the night before.  When the moment between the two was getting romantic she said ""I love you"" and his response was a confusing and scared  ""No"".  LOL!  His response is a recurring theme throughout the movie and why Emma is in such a bad mood.  On the other hand we never see the cool Emma who likes to have fun, so it comes across like she's constantly angry and doesn't have a likeable side.

As for Fran, he literally could have said anything but no.  Even Franz' fellow co-workers give him a hard time about it.  Meanwhile a new boss comes in (played by Pedro Pascal) and none of the other guys like him very much based on their prior experience with the guy.  He changes the establishment in a big way (or at least tries to).  He uh... has a secret side to his character that uh... isn't like most of the workers.  Okay I admit he's a vampire.  Anyway expect a level of silliness that almost spills over the top and becomes *too* much!

While it's true this is a vampire movie, the way the vampires come into the story is that it's secrete knowledge among at least half of the workers that vampires are roaming/taking over the place (and they even hilariously mention how they can thrive in such an environment due to lack of sun reaching the office, LOL)  I think the first vampire we see is Yvette Yates.  She hits on one of the employees in the backroom rather aggressively, and the theme is most of the male workers are not only silly but timid and shy around women, so he just about loses his mind!  Hilarious how he thinks picking up a chair will stop Yvette's bloodsucking attempt, lol.

This movie improves in a major way as it rolls forward.  The final 20 minutes is absolutely hilarious!  This is when the vampires actually communicate with the regular office workers and it becomes known that Pedro and others are in fact vampires.  Even the first boss knew about the vampires the whole time... but too bad for him, the terms of his job position wasn't clear so it wasn't enough to save him.  Also Marshall Givens, the night security guard, is a pivotal good guy character as well.  I love how he comes off like an obedient tough guy... only to admire kitten videos on youtube!

What makes the final couple scenes so memorable are the vampire fights with the non-vampires, and Pedro and another vampire have discussions about the proper way to run a business while surrounded by all the fighting going on, lol.  This is probably the funniest moment of the movie unless my sense of humor is just so out there these days I've lost my ability to be reasonable!  Also when the vampires explode into a popping ball of blood after taking too much damage... instant wall decorations!  A LOT of hilarious jokes about it too (and a *very* gross final scene- yuck!)  And the vampire who discusses with Joey Kern how they can reach a mutual agreement to not kill each other leading a game of rock paper scissors and even performing some kind of juggling act... awesome stuff.

I don't know, I really enjoyed this movie.  It might be too juvenile for most people and I totally understand that, but sometimes absolute silliness can be pretty awesome!  I welcome it in this case!",1470873600,,3707,4.5636363636363635
7383880,5,B0145UQRY8,"Great schlocky movie, that has good acting, script and effects. This is a movie I can watch several times and still enjoy.",1470441600,,122,4.590909090909091
7383881,2,B0145UQRY8,"What a missed opportunity. The concept was decent (although generic), with quite a few actual actors in the cast. The amount of blood was more than you get in many vamp flicks; these suckers explode when they meet the True Death. What went wrong? The script certainly wasn't lending favors, but perhaps it was the director who took some notable actors and botched this up?

ACTORS
You've seen at least one of these folks before in something.
Fran Kranz: couldn't place his face and it was bugging me so much I had to go to IMDb... he played Topher Brink on Joss Whedon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dollhouse/dp/B002JVWR4U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dollhouse</a>&nbsp;for 27 episodes.
Pedro Pascal: Javier Pea on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Narcos/dp/B01H1VSVME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Narcos</a>, and Oberyn Martell from Game of Thrones(!)
Emma Fitzpatrick: I think she's what kept me watching. Both pretty and pretty convincing as Amanda.
Joel Murray: this is the actor who played the alcoholic Freddy Rumsen on Mad Men, the guy who pisses his pants while in a meeting with Pete, Peggy, and Salvatore. It must be rough to be remembered as the actor on Mad Men who pissed himself.
Yvette Yates: plays the socially awkward office worker who has a crush on the unknowing protagonist... she must be a good actor because I don't know how a woman who looks like that could: [1] be socially awkward, and [2] not even get a date with the likes of Fran Kranz's character.

HUMOR
90% of laugh lines fall flat (80% if you think repeated instances of ""Bam Snap"" is hilarious). This is a pitifully low % even for a vampire comedy. Truly, the best vampire comedies are often the ones not intended to be comedies. I would also argue that some of the most humorous vampire films are 4- or 5-star vamp flicks with very minor yet meaningful instances of humor, cleverly placed.
Bloodsucking Bastards does offer a few chances to crack up, e.g., Fran Kranz's line to Emma Fitzpatrick: ""Don't get all Princess Leia on me,"" but the payoff isn't worth the 86 minutes.

Final thoughts: Who's to blame? There were plenty of decent actors, so let's not trash them for the big fail. The script was generally bad but not godawful. The folks who did the blood effects got it right. That leaves me looking at the director, until somebody gives me a reason to think otherwise.
Recommendation: watch the way, much superior&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freaks-of-Nature/dp/B01722L9QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freaks of Nature</a>.",1470182400,5,2645,5.525925925925926
7383882,5,B0145UQRY8,"Makes sense that this was made by Dr. God, an LA improv troupe, because who better than a group of actors that constantly think on their feet to understand pacing, how to perfectly play characters off each other for chemistry, and the best way to balancing humor, satire, and horror? The script was great but you could tell actors brought their own contributions to the scenes, and it made the film flow really well, building suspense while you laughed. Loved the audio cues and little tease scares at the beginning along with the mix of the pitiful drudgery of modern office work. Every character was fun to watch and had great lines, and the movie kept getting better as the antagonist was introduced. Loved him as Prince of Dorne, and he was great in this role. Right amount of comedy, excellent use of gore and tension, really enjoyable film. It's rare to find a film that lives up to what you want it to be, Bloodsucking Bastards is that and more. Can't wait to see more from Director Brian James O'Connell and the Dr. God crew.",1466640000,,1033,4.559139784946237

It's witty, unpredictable and just truly funny. Even the background people are so real and on point with every facial expression - you feel like you've been in this kind of office. It isn't silly and doesn't use typical horror tropes and jokes. The characters feel like they are ripped out of real life and I think that's what makes it so funny. You end up actually feeling as if you can really relate to working like a zombie for an evil blood sucking overlord. And if that doesn't make you laugh, you probably have no soul.

The good news is that there is a solution.

This was one funny movie.  I didn't know what to expect from the cover photo and the description, but rest assured that it is a farce and played for laughs all the way.  The flick poked genial fun at nerd culture, vampire tropes, slackers, corporate culture and commitment issues. The movie is kind of a Dilbert meets Chuck meets Dracula minus the seriousness of Dracula.

I thought the actors magnificently delivered their cheesy slacker portrayals. Franz Kranz is an earnest nebbish, Joey Kerns is a great self-absorbed  slacker, and Emma Fitzpatrick made a terrific foil for Kranz. The back and forth between the rest of the characters, particularly the idiotic discussions, virtually mirror the kind of dumb conversation you might have with your IQ defective associates. Surprisingly, for me the deadpan security guard Frank, played by Marshall Givens, delivered the funniest performance of the flick.

7383942,5,B0145UQRY8,Reviewers who compare OFFICE SPACE and SHAUN OF THE DEAD are right on the money. If you are a fan of either of those films you'll love BLOOD SUCKING BASTARDS. Great cast--killer script--fun one liners and characters you can find in  most modern offices.  I'd watch this one again and heartily recommend it in the future. Well worth a watch.,1441584000,6,340,4.65
7383943,5,B0145UQRY8,Dont let the horror category stop you from seeing this very funny movie.  Even if your not a fan of the vampire genre this movie is just as much a comedy.  I want to watch again to nail down some of the great lines.  Great writing and acting.  Dont miss it.,1441584000,2,257,3.980392156862745
7383944,5,B0145UQRY8,"Didn't know what to expect as I typically shy away from any type of ""horror"" film-funny or not.  I am a huge fan of this film...A LOT of laugh out loud moments.  I have a crush on Joey Kern now as well.  Already preordered he blu-ray!  Definitely check it out!!!",1441584000,2,262,4.18
7383945,5,B0145UQRY8,"This is like watching The Office and having Steve Carell/Ricky Gervais reveal that he's a vampire - very funny, clever and silly at the same time. Emphasis is on giggles not gore. Lots of workplace tropes well observed and given a twist - like the spaced out scene in the elevator at the end. Loved it.",1441584000,3,302,4.410714285714286
7383946,4,B0145UQRY8,"A cult classic in the making, Office Space meets Shaun of the Dead to bring me the vampire-comedy-horror film (can this become an actual genre please) I never knew I wanted. Bloodsucking Bastards is a thrill to watch and you're sure to have a lot of fun with this film. While I did enjoy the gory blood this movie provided in its third act, what worked better for me was the deadpan humor that was perfectly placed throughout the entire film; theres a lot of genuine laugh out load moments. Emma Fitzpatrick (who I am a massive fan of) and Joey Kern are the standouts here. Both actors show off excellent comedic timing; Kern is outright hysterical from beginning to end and Fitzpatrick shows that she can kick some ass when it is needed. I really wasn't sure what to expect when I turned this movie on, but I was pleasantly surprised with how it turned out. Most Ive laughed during a film all year.",1441497600,13,899,4.454545454545454
7383947,5,B0145UQRY8,"I have seen it twice, loved it both times but the 2nd time around it is even better as you find more nuance. Joey Kern definitely stole the show but I just loved Marshall Givens as Frank. I have read people comparing it to Shaun of the Dead meets Office Space. A fair comparison to be sure, but I liked it better than Shaun of the Dead. I think it is destined to be a cult classic. Definitely recommend this and when it comes out on DVD I'm owning it... Bam Snap!!",1441497600,4,464,4.054347826086956
7383948,4,B0145UQRY8,"Saw it in the theater. AWESOME.  Starring Guy who Hides in the Woods during Cabin Fever and Stoner Guy from Cabin in the Woods ;)
More of a very bloody comedy than a horror movie (but sure to please horror fans).
Watch it.",1441497600,2,222,4.162790697674419

8729773,3,B0145UQRY8,"With such a great cast, this movie felt like a huge missed opportunity. This is a low-priority rental for an afternoon and nothing more. Watchable, but not recommended. Fun, but not that fun.

Amid a typical sales office, Evans (Fran Kranz; The Cabin in the Woods, The Village, Donnie Darko) world is falling apart. He lost his girlfriend, on old college rival (Pedro Pascal; Game of Thrones) snatched his promotion out from under him, and his coworkers are being brutally murdered and replaced by vampires.

Between the premise and the cast, I was really excited to see this and bought the DVD blindly. I don't exactly regret that, but this movie was not the exceptional delight for which I hoped.

Director Brian James O'Connell delivers a movie that is moderately fun and breezy. Its not great, but its a nice way to spend a lazy afternoon. I never really felt any sense of urgency (even during the vampire killing scenes), shock or scale (it all takes place in the office), nor were the jokes ever laugh out loud affairs. Just a lot of grins and a few giggles.

Pedro Pascal is entertaining, but still he feels like hes phoning it in. The real performance efforts come from Joey Kern (Cabin Fever), Emma Fitzpatrick (The Collection) and Fran Kranz. The gore, wounds and blood are not abundant except for a few scenes, but its nice when you see your heroes unexpectedly blood-doused a la What We Do in the Shadows (2014). But with that said, the gore is mostly blood and largely limited to the last 30 minutes.

For me, the greatest victory was adding to my lexiconical sense of office horror movies. And by that, I mean things like Mayhem (2017), The Belko Experiment (2016) or other fare discussed in our Office Horror podcast episode. Otherwise, this film is hard to recommend. You may have noticed this is a very short review for me I guess I just don't have much to say about it (good or bad).",1531008000,,1901,4.612426035502959
8729774,5,B0145UQRY8,"I can't believe I waited so long to watch this.  I concur with most of the reviews saying it has the same gross-out humor and office satire that The Office, Shawn of the Dead, Super Troopers, etc all had with even some of the same actors.

8729781,4,B0145UQRY8,"I totally knew that I would be having some fun with this movie and I really did. This is a very low budget movie and it all takes place in the office and I think instead of it feeling claustrophobic, that made it fun. WE have some familiar faces her and they are fun to watch (gag reel too) My favorite thing was that you could tell that everyone was having a great time. What we have is an underachieving group of workers that sell garbage stuff via phone sales and they are all slackers. So it is time for some new blood. As things start to happen to the employees and suspicions rise and possibilities arise we are in on the fun. The acting is also fun from start to finish. Lots of gore and tons of fun.",1499644800,2,707,4.093525179856115
8729782,5,B0145UQRY8,"One of the best horror/comedies ever made. I place it pretty much on part with Shaun of the Dead and Tucker and Dale vrs. Evil. There is noting to complain about here, it's one of those movies I wish I could unsee, just so I could watch it with a group of friends. Do yourself a favor and give this a chance.",1499299200,,308,3.9838709677419355
