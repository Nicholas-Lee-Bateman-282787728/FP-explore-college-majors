8744593,5,B019BK8YQG,Excellent video - well worth the price.  Dean and Dawn are world dance champions as well as very experienced teachers.  This is a small price to pay to learn from the masters!  This video will enable you to expand upon the basics that you learned from volume 1 and will have you dancing with more confidence.  Great tips...easily understood even by beginners.,1453593600,2,359,4.741935483870968
