1896830,5,B00009Y3VE,"I bought this because I wanted to get as many different videos in this series as possible. It is a great series! Each story on the DVD is about 8-10 minutes long and built around a nursery rhyme. Each story has two songs, the original nursery rhyme, and an original song that fits with the story. The stories are cute and creative and these are wonderful ""first"" videos for a child. Just be prepared for your child to insist on watching them - a lot. The only thing I don't like is the narration on these US versions - Jane Kaczmarek is not as good as Dawn French. Also, anyone that has the UK DVDs in this series should be aware that there are some duplications on this DVD (Jack & Jill, and Twinkle Twinkle). But even with the duplications, this is a nice addition to the series with three unique stories (Humpty Dumpty, Three Ships, and Hot Cross Buns).",1163116800,3,856,4.35625
1896831,5,B00009Y3VE,"I got this as a gift from a British friend of mine... when we first turned it on I thought my son would hate it.  Wow, was I wrong.  He has started singing some of the songs when they come on (he's only 14 months) and it is the FIRST DVD that he has requested by name (Beep Beep).  I've read the other reviews - yes, the animation is someone raw and you only hear the ""Wheels"" song in between, but there are lots of other songs and children could care less about bad animation.  Remember the bad stuff we watched as kids?  Horribly animated Christmas specials?  Bottom line is this - I came online today to purchase a SECOND Wheels DVD because my son is so fascinated with the Humpty Dumpty one.",1146355200,,695,4.18796992481203
1896832,5,B00009Y3VE,"This was a gift for my two year old.  When I first played it I was not sure my son would like it...the characters were talking musical instruments. Beep the Bus and Jasper the Clown looked like they would scare my child!  WRONG!  He LOVES this DVD....the characters, the songs, EVERYTHING!  It is a bright, funny, wonderfully computer amimated DVD that is fun to watch over and over again. My son has actually picked up new words just from watching and he loves ALL the songs!",1143417600,3,476,4.5
1896833,5,B00009Y3VE,"We stumbled on this video when my 29 month old picked it up at the video store because he was drawn to the ""Humpty Dumpty"" on the back. (He loves the nursery rhyme and repeats it over and over).  He really enjoys the video and got so upset when we had to return it.  Yes, the narration is in a slight British accent but not so much that it distracts.  Besides, I want my child to understand there is more in the world than his own home town.  The nursery rhymes are not verbatim to what you may have heard growing up, but again I think this is part of the charm.  My sons watches the Humpty Dumpty story over and over and marches around the living room when ""all the kings men"" start marching around trying to help Humpty.",1106438400,,722,4.128571428571429

7994230,3,B00009Y3VE,Doesn't hold grandson interest for more than a few minutes and he's really a nursery rhyme lover at this time. Was somewhat disappointed. Actually wanted more nursery rhymes included instead of drawing each one out.,1364947200,,215,5.171428571428572
7994231,3,B00009Y3VE,The dvd was entertaining for my 5 month old & the animation was colorful.  I was surprised that it appears to be a British English dvd.
