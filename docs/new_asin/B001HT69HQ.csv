8309571,1,B001HT69HQ,Really pissed it wasn't specified that this version is narrated by William burroughs. Once again deceived by some third party company on amazon. Makes a huge difference. Do yourself a favor and just buy the criterion version and don't make the same mistake I made.  Not worth your money unless you WANT the burroughs version (which idk why anyone would),1450742400,5,353,4.883333333333334
