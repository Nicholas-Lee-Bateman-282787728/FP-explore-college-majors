8145793,4,B000IHYW4K,"A very nice compilation of all the matches that Barcelona played enroute to winning the title in Paris.  Highly recommended.  Only that disc 1 was mostly in Spanish, with some translation in English.  A good collection.",1296518400,,219,5.027777777777778
8145794,3,B000IHYW4K,"Just watched this, the material and content is priceless for any soccer ( football ) fan, it follows the Barca through the Champions league competition, it includes all the goals of Barca's matches for and against them, and some highlights in the 2005/06 season of the European champions league.
Now what disappointed me in this dvd and made me give it only 3 stars was some technical stuff, for example, in disc one you have the option of chosing either an english commentary or a spanish one, However, when you chose the english commentary, you can hear the english Audio only during the intereviws with players or during an introduction to matches, but in the match clips itself, you only get a spanish commentator with english subtitles, which is annoying !
And the subtitles are useless, because during a match no one would want to read subtitles, you just want to watch the action, so i felt cheated there because the match clips had only spanish comentators,
I know that Soccer is an international game and you don't really need a comentator to tell you what is going on, but i still would have preferred an english commnetary on the match clips !! so minus a star here !
Another annoying thing was that they only show a single slow motion replay for most of the goals, i mean you would expect at least two replays for each goal and three for the really good ones, but instead we get only one for almost all goals as far as i can remember maybe two for some !

On disc 2, they do have an english commentator for the whole final match, which is good, However, the commentator was a bit calmer than usual, not psyched or extra excited, which is actually good for me because i hate over excited commentators who shout and scream like the spanish ones, but the real annoying thing was the delay in picture compared to sound, there was like a 1 second or slightly less delay in picture, so you can actually hear the commentator shouts Goal before tha ball goes in, or you can sometimes hear the Whistle before it actually goes or hear a Kick before you see it, it is a bit annoying but during the match you get carried away that sometimes you don't notice the delay, but still minus another star here !
Overall, an enjoyable DVD of Barca in action with very cool goals and impressive moves from such great players like Ronaldinho..i just think the DVD needed more work..especially in the Audio",1195689600,3,2395,4.518433179723503

8145796,4,B000IHYW4K,"First of all, this dvd set IS REGION 1. i bought it not knowing if i would be able to play it on my dvd player and the first thing i looked at when my dvd arrived was look at the back of the case and sure enough it clearly was labeled as a region 1 dvd. The reason why im emphasazing on this i because on amazon.com it does not tell you which is weird, you would think they would make sure you know what you're buying because otherwise not too many people will risk buying something like this. all the technical stuff aside the dvd plays great looks great and sounds great.. it gives you the option of spanish or english commentary. truly a must for any football (soccer) fans.",1169078400,7,677,4.136363636363637
