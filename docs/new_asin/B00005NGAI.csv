1633966,5,B00005NGAI,A slyly funny film starring many of the same actors from the beloved Balykissangel television series.  Some great camera work and all the makings of a cult film.  Some very good extras are included on the DVD disc also.  A little known gem.,1016150400,7,240,4.534883720930233
1633967,5,B00005NGAI,"This is a calmly hilarious Irish movie about a man, Hubert, who comes home from the pub one night and turns into a rat in front of his angry wife Conchita. The humour in this movie comes mainly from the cool manner in which people react to extraordinary events, and from the contorted, but strangely obvious logic they employ. For example, in one scene they get a doctor to check up on Hubert.  The doctor enters the room and remarks that there is a rat wearing a jacket in the bed.  He is told that the rat is Hubert, and upon hearing this he slowly nods his head and makes a quiet, understanding remark like ""Oh, I see."" In any case, Rat is incredibly funny, and the concept of the film is entirely original. In the end, we even get a sense of understanding of why Hubert turned into a rat in the first place, and it makes complete sense. There is absolutely no reason not to watch this movie.",1015632000,4,895,4.258823529411765
1633968,4,B00005NGAI,"I didn't know anything about this movie when I saw it in my local library (where I also work as the children's librarian). I've always liked Pete Postlethwaite (is that the way you spell it?)...he's got a craggy charisma I've enjoyed since Alien3 (yes I was one of the four people who loved that movie)
This movie has little other than Pete and puppets in common with Alien3. (The Hensons were part of the production team so you know the puppets in Rat are well done!)
This is a funny Irish fantasy that Roald Dahl might have written. Man turns into a rat & his family get together with a smarmy writer to turn their misfortune into a bestseller...laugh out loud rat chases ensue...there is also a lot of rat (fake rat of course) abuse and outrageousness.
The DVD extras are also quite fun. There's a making of featurette with the whole cast (rats included) laughing up to the camera...and a casting call for rats. WELL worth the price of the DVD. You'll be showing this one to friends who have also never heard of it when you have them over for an evening's movie!
Have fun",1012867200,9,1074,4.456852791878172
1633999,5,B00005NGAI,"So, I am writing this review because of my surprise at seeing it has not been reviewed more often. There are moments in this piece that will just come to me sometimes when my mind is blank and make me laugh out loud.

This genius doc is something I used to watch all the time (on VHS) yet I never thought to look for the DVD until now. Looks like only one is left in stock but I'd buy a dozen as Christmas gifts if there was better availability.

Yes-it is a rat documentary, and, yes-it imparts facts about the rodent, BUT: it is a riot. The way Errol Morris' work often is. If you are a fan of his, I really do recommend watching this--even with a large group with children--for entertainment. Whether or not you have rats as pets or pests: it's a good watch.

Incidentally, Mark Lewis has other documentary films on animals--one on chickens and one on cane toads. I wound up owning all of them after seeing this one first.",1386374400,,925,4.274285714285714

1634005,4,B00005NGAI,"Not a great hit of a movie, but it entertains. I have a rat rescue and do not recommend holding a rat by the tail, washing him in a washing machine, nor hanging him up to dry by the tail.

1634019,5,B00005NGAI,"It was my 3rd viewing. What made it so funny was how seriously it was treated by the actors who were excellent in their parts. So tongue in cheek in one way. Great Irish humour in a Dublin setting.

What I would have wanted to know before I saw the DVD is - who are the actors and what is the thene of the story?

To think that a live rat is the star is hillarious to start with.",1251676800,,379,3.7848101265822787
1634020,4,B00005NGAI,"Rat (Steve Barron, 2000)

Not at all what I was expecting, I must say. Rat is billed as a family comedy, but I'm not sure that either ""family"" or ""comedy"" is an accurate assessment here. It's got humor, certainly, but it's the blackest of humors. And I'd have thought this a decidedly adult comedy, not because there's all that much content that's inappropriate for the kiddies, but because the way it's approached is a bit on the subtle side; I'm not sure the kiddies would find it interesting enough. As an adult black comedy, however, it's worth your time.

Hubert (Pete Postlethwaite) is a typical guy; he's not terribly happy in his marriage, his job is less than fulfilling, and he likes the odd pint at the end of the day. He comes home from the pub one night, just as every other night, goes to bed, and when he wakes up in the morning, he's a rat. Needless to say, his wife Conchita (Imelda Staunton) is less than pleased. The news spreads, and eventually the entire town knows. A family discussion leads to a possible solution, but whose best interest is it in, ultimately?

Wesley Burrowes (Mystics) is known for his black comedies, and Rat is no exception to the rule. Barron (Electric Dreams) usually works in more mainstream comedies, but he was a fine choice to helm this; he gets good performances out of the entire cast, he adapts well to the darker tone of the material, and the finished product is well-paced and watchable. Send the kiddies to bed and watch this one by yourselves. *** ",1242950400,,1505,4.58364312267658
1634021,5,B00005NGAI,"This is a very entertaining movie provided you enjoy semi-absurd UK humor.  I'm fascinated by the Irish lingo and the beautiful brogues as well as the cultural peek (from my American point of view) into urban Ireland. If you like dry wit and can laugh at absurdity, you'll enjoy this under-the-radar gem.",1241568000,,304,4.846153846153846
1634022,4,B00005NGAI,Rat is a strange but extremely clever film. Both Imelda Staunton and Pete Postlethwaite give hilarious performances only to be outdone by a very talented rodent. Touching at times to even out the laughs.  I enjoyed Rat immensely.,1211673600,,229,5.026315789473684
1634023,5,B00005NGAI,"Plodding along in a rut? Having way too many serious thoughts and conversations?  Well, curl up and enjoy ""Rat""!  This is a delightful, silly story, with a super-good soundtrack and terrific actors!! It's one of those rare gems you can enjoy over and over again and smile every time!",1204156800,3,283,4.755102040816326
1634024,5,B00005NGAI,"Say what you will about the implausibility of the basic premise, this is a very intelligent movie about human nature. How do people act and react to someone whose appearance of humanness has been removed? No one in the film doubts that the rat is the same person/personality that once was a man, but without his former appearance, he no longer *is* a person to any of them.

It's a very funny film, because it is so intelligent in portraying basic human nature. It speaks volumes about human/human and human/animal relationships, and if you can wrap your head around the idea, could even be an allegory about abortion rights.

""Rat"" is one of the rare comedies that is successful as a comedy *and* leaves you with lots to think about after the film is over.",1183334400,2,757,4.6
1634025,4,B00005NGAI,"This video takes a humorous look at Rats as a ""natural"" and ""native"" creature in urban areas, particularly in NYC.  It's an excellent companion to Rat, by Robert Sullivan-- a book that looks at Rats in their ""natural habitat""-- the CITY!!!  The slightly subversive humor of Cane Toads is present here, but its not nearly as tight.  This is a good film, but not one I would go out of my way to see again.",1180656000,5,403,4.346666666666667
1634026,4,B00005NGAI,"If you like paradoies, British Isles humor, and a good story, this movie is for you.  It has a story and it is hilarious and it has a wonderful ending with engaging music all the way through.  It will stay in my library for anytime I need an uplift.  mikiel",1180656000,2,257,4.1
1634027,3,B00005NGAI,"This may be perhaps the silliest movie I've ever seen.  The idea of a husband/father turning into a rat is just a strange storyline.  I wouldn't say this movie is necessarily a childrens movie either.  It's more like, well, just a really silly movie that some families might enjoy.

I guess it was an okay film.  What I REALLY loved about it was all the really good songs that played throughout the film, which didn't resemble the storyline in any way.  Then again, I'm not Irish, so maybe they did.

I think what kind of rubbed me the wrong way about the film was how the other family members continued treating the rat like it was the man of the family, and none of this looked believable at all.  For instance, the wife was determined to get the rat to eat his supper during dinnertime.  I think if someone I knew had turned into a rat, the last thing I'd care about is why they're not eating.

I just couldn't get into the movie.",1174348800,,933,4.310344827586207
1634028,5,B00005NGAI,"I rented this movie like I've rented many movies - RANDOMLY. I had no idea what to expect. I only knew it had something to do with a Rat (obviously). RAT was a very pleasant surprise (love the accents. especially when the wife says ""book"" like ""buke"" haha, maybe I'm just crazy... but so is this movie!!). Hubert Flynn (the rat throughout most of the film) is transformed somehow and goes home to his family. What's weird is the fact that the people in the movie never question that the rat is Hubert. Infact, when we enter into their life, the audience assumes that Huburt the Rat has been there living as a rat for serveral days or even weeks or months! The wife fixes him dinner and talks to him like he's human. They put pillows on his chair at the dinner table so that the rat, um, I mean Hubert, can reach the food. My reasons for liking this movie are simple: It's unique. It's humorous. It's mysterious. You never know what's going to happen next, so it keeps viewers interested! I thought it was very well made and a creative idea for a movie. The ending has a good twist as well. They have an official web site for the movie: rat-themovie dot com. It's a refreshing change compared to all the other movies out today. If you want a few laughs, and want to be in on a ""secret"" movie that a lot of people probably haven't seen ... 'RAT' is certainly a movie you won't soon forget.",1046044800,12,1387,4.297709923664122
7947147,5,B00005NGAI,"My family loved this movie. I thought the premise was silly so I wasn't interested in it, but a friend told me to ignore that and watch it because it was much more clever than wed imagined it would be. My friend was right!",1526083200,,222,4.068181818181818
