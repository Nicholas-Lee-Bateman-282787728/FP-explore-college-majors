4509391,5,B004ZKKKWE,The WWE really stepped up their game in this one I mean WOW!!! it was really entertaining to watch. The MITB matches were great and Cena and Punk put on a great match themselves. I can't wait for the DVD to be available so I could watch it again.,1311033600,,246,4.040816326530612
4509392,5,B004ZKKKWE,"This was one of the best WWE Pay Per Views in the history of WWF/WWE pay per views. The matches were fantastic. The outcomes were unpredictable. The main event had 30+ minutes of WRESTLING! It was very entertaining. The WWE universe hasn't been this hostile for a pay per view event since the One Night Stand ppv main event of RVD vs John Cena. The crowd reaction was the best since then. I haven't witnessed anything like it live since the Rock vs Hollywood Hogan at Wrestlemania X-8. It feels as though this PPV could be the building blocks for a new era of wrestling being ushered in. We, as fans, will look back at this ppv, being the event that will have taken the WWE to new heights in 2020, as they have a new casual fan base, caring about their television shows again. It's amazing how an arena of 14,000+ of CM Punk fans, can put an arena of 55,000+ of St. Pierre fans, at an UFC ppv, to shame, but they did it. GET THIS DVD!",1311033600,8,934,4.223463687150838
4509393,4,B004ZKKKWE,"Smackdown Money in the Bank: SinCara gets destroyed by Sheamus early by being power bombed pretty much through a ladder! Justin Gabriel also did his 450 off a ladder on someone. But a lot more happened than that, it's just hard to remember it all since this was a long grueling Money in the Bank match that Daniel Bryan won.

  Big Show vs Mark Henry: I don't think this one was too long, it just seemed as if Henry destroyed Show to win the match after two World's Strongest Slams.

  A Kelly Kelly Title defense happened that I wasn't into and Kelly retained.

  Raw Money in the Bank: Alberto won after ripping Rey's mask off when Rey was about to win. Surprise surprise, a face wins the Smackdown Money in the Bank and a heel wins the Raw one. Think about it, Smackdown is the place that's more likely to give a new face that's not Cena the World title and Raw is always more likely to give a heel the belt just so Cena can win it from him.

  Christian vs Orton (World Champ): in one of there less impressive battles, Christian won by making Orton angry enough to kick him in the groin and get DQ'd. Christian won the belt by DQ.

  John Cena (WWE World Champ) vs CM Punk: If Punk wins he'll leave with the belt. When Cena beat Punk in like 2 minutes on Raw 2 years ago, I was pissed and a fan on youtube said, ""Punk sucks anyway and Cena is way better."" Well watch this match and tell me he sucks and that Cena is actually better. This is a long grueling match and it's Cena that had to slow things down a few times by pulling on the ropes, jogging in place or selling that he hurt his knee. Hell, he even looked out of breath at times, Punk never slowed down at all though.
  Punk put on his best match ever and didn't even do the same moves twice! Cena however went for the Attitude Adjustment like 6 times, the Knuckle Shuffle 2 times, STF 3 times and the Leg Drop off the top rope 2 times. Yeah Cena can go but if he's in a long match that doesn't have a No DQ rule where he can use weapons or fight outside the ring for a long time, you see that he really doesn't have many moves. So vote negative all you want, but this match was mostly just great because of Punk! There's really nothing incredibly special about Cena even if the WWE has done a great job convincing you that there is!
  Anyway Punk kicked out of like 3 Attitude Adjustments and won the match with the GTS after Cena turned his back on Punk, to confront Vince McMahon who wanted to ring the bell when Cena had the STF on Punk.",1310947200,,2504,4.125773195876289

Only one world to describe this incredible!, a Excellent 30 min+ Match the crowd were electric and made the match very special it had everything kudos to cena and punk for putting on one of the best matches in many years

No Doubt when this comes out its a must buy for any WWE Fans for the Punk/Cena match alone but the world title match and the ladder matches were good as well",1310947200,2,781,4.216216216216216
4509395,5,B004ZKKKWE,"If you read my review of Capitol Punishment, don't think I'm being way too positive by giving this 5 stars. But anyway, this was just a fantastic PPV with my favorite style ladder matches. The CM Punk vs. John Cena match was completely incredible lasting 33:44 and beating a record of the longest singles match in WWE PPV history. I enjoyed the World Heavyweight Championship Match between Randy Orton and Christian as well. And for the first time in WWE, somebody might retire with the WWE Championship belt. No spoilers

1. SmackDown! Money in the Bank Ladder Match:
Sin Cara vs. Wade Barrett vs. Sheamus vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Justin Gabriel vs. Heath Slater vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Kane (24:27)
I was mainly looking forward to this Money in the Bank Ladder Match and I knew it wouldn't disappoint. This had extreme-measured ladder moves like Gabriel doing his 450 splash off the top and Sheamus powerbombing Sin Cara off the top turnbuckle and through a ladder. This was probably the most realistic Money in the Bank because everybody got involved most of the time. The old members of the Corre did great fighting apart. A must-see match. 8.5/10

2. Divas Championship Match
Kelly Kelly(c) vs. Brie Bella (4:24)
I never really find these matches very interesting but this one wasn't terrible. Had a big amount of high-flying moves and little outside action.

3. Big Show vs. Mark Henry (6:00)
In the other reviews people seemed to really like this match. In my terms, it was O.K. Obviously it was a slow paced match but I was surprised to see the high-flying moves by Big Show. Mark Henry just stuck to the powerhouse slams. Just like the match before, I have nothing else to say. 7.5/10

4. RAW Money in the Bank Ladder Match:
Rey Mysterio vs Evan Bourne vs. Jack Swagger vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. R-Truth vs. Miz vs. Alex Riley vs. Kofi Kingston (15:40)
This a better Money in the Bank Ladder match but not by a lot. I was shocked by the Miz by returning after knee injury. Alex Riley showed some impressive ladder match material. Rey Mysterio entered his very first Money in the Bank Ladder Match which was exciting for the crowd and me. It was amazing when every superstar in the match were all on ladders. Overall, the match more brutal, more great-planned and somewhat more exciting than the SmackDown! one. Another definite must-see Money in the Bank. 9/10

5. World Heavyweight Championship:
Randy Orton(c) vs. Christian (If Orton got disqualified or the referee makes a ""bad call"" Christian become Champion)(12:20)
This was the 2nd best of their battles throughout this rivalry. Both men worked hard the match was expected to be kept short. I'm okay with the way the match ended. Great match. 8.5/10

6. WWE Championship:
John Cena(c) vs. CM Punk (If CM left Chicago with the championship, Cena would be fired)(33:44)
As Joey Styles would say, OH MY GOD!!!! This has to be the greatest match in the history of history. I don't know how WWE pulled off such a great rivalry followed by a record breaking match. These men worked harder than any men have worked in a different match. This was bloody and brutal with CM Punk's face bruised after hitting his head on the barricade. CM Punk made around eight GTS attempts while Cena doing the same with Attitude Adjustments. CM Punk got out of about 5 STFs. INCREDIBLE! MATCH OF THE YEAR!!!!!!! 10/10

I thought at first the PPV would be bad due to the only six matches and all of the other matched happening early. If it weren't for the Punk vs. Cena match, this PPV would be about a half-hour shorter. Last year, the Money in the Banks were slow paced, unlike these ones. The Championship matches were extremely exciting because of the risk-taking stipulations. I give this event 5 Stars. This just so might be the best PPV since WrestleMania XIX. Everyone should now be pumped for SummerSlam to see how that turns out. WWE is going to gain so much more popularity because of this one performance.",1310947200,,3947,4.678674351585014
4509396,5,B004ZKKKWE,"I haven't ordered a WWE ppv since the 2005 Royal Rumble.  I have been very bored with the product the company has been putting out.  Outside of Wrestlemania(s), WWE ppv's are pretty much rehashes of the one they proceed.  Tonight, July 17th 2011, this was the night that you couldn't, or shouldn't, have missed.  Tonight was history in the WWE.  The birth of ""Austin 3:16"", ""Montreal Screwjob"", Undertaker/HBK II and tonight.  This is something that has never been done before, an employee walking out of the WWE with their WWE championship.

From beginning to end, well outside the Diva's match, this PPV was top notch.  Everybody worked their tails off.  I was extremely impressed with Heath Slater and the Miz.  Slater held his own on the Smackdown side of their MITB match.  The Miz, coming back after apparently blowing his knee out, drew an amazing pop from the live crowd.  I was honestly jumping up and down in my apartment cheering the Miz on as he limped down the aisle.

CM Punk leaving through the crowd with the belt was gold, priceless, EPIC, classic, etc etc.  It's a moment I have relived over 20 times now, thank you DVR, and it will never get old.  Thank you WWE for finally putting out an event that is A+ and having the guts to go through with a huge storyline.  This will bring the WWE back and gain the ratings they've yearned for over a year now.  WWE, tonight, had a rebirth.

Great PPV",1310860800,,1417,4.529644268774703

This was probably the best overall PPV I've seen since I started watching WWE 4 years ago.  I've seen some fantastic Wrestlemania's and some really great Royal Rumbles, and Money in the Bank just might be better than them all.  Granted, not every match is 10/10 fantastic, but there are some real gems here.

Smackdown Money in the Bank Ladder Match:  8/10
  Some really good spots in this match that turned out surprisingly well considering who was in it.  Very entertaining.
Divas Title Match:  5/10
  This was pretty much what any Divas match has been since 2006 or so.  It was decent and short without being laughably short.
Mark Henry vs. Big Show:  8/10
  These guys are both pretty big, so this match felt a little slow at times, but both competitors are seasoned veterans and they put on a good showing with an explosive finish.
RAW Money in the Bank Ladder Match:  9/10
  This match was absolutely excellent.  This match also had some really good spots with the ladders and the roster was much more substantial than Smackdown's match.  There are moments that'll make your jaw drop and moments that'll make you cringe at the beatings these guys take.  My only disappointment was with the finish.  It felt very lackluster after such an exciting match.
Christian vs. Randy Orton World Heavyweight Title Match:  9/10
  This was one of the best matches I've ever seen Randy Orton in, and Christian complimented Orton's style well.  Very good pacing in this match and some real edge of your seat moments.  Some fans may be disappointed in how this match ends, but I personally didn't have a problem with it.
CM Punk vs. John Cena WWE Title Match:  10/10
  This has become my new favorite match of all time.  These two did a fantastic job of drawing you in and keeping you guessing about what would come next.  CM Punk displayed some of his best work in this match and worked really well with Cena.  This match was the best way they could have possibly ended the PPV.

Overall:  9/10",1310860800,,2014,4.625

I haven't bought a WWE PPV on DVD in many, many years.  I think the last one I bought was WM 26.  With that said I went out and bought this DVD the day it came out because I knew this would be one of the greatest WWE PPV's ever.  And it does not make you think twice about ever forgetting it.  This was truly one of the most important moments in the WWE.  It has started a gradual shift and change in the WWE.  Hopefully leading to bigger and better things.  This DVD ranks right up there with any and I mean any Wrestlemania, SummerSlam, Royal Rumble, or any other PPV.  Every match is top notch and worth watching over and over again.

4509416,5,B004ZKKKWE,"This is without a doudt the best PPV of 2011, and if 2 matches had of been better I would say it's one of the best WWE shows of all time.

  Smackdown Money in the Bank match 4 stars.
 Kane vs. Sin Cara vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Wade Barrett vs. Justin Gabriel vs. Sheamus vs. Cody Rhodes.
 Great match, and the better of the two Money in the Bank matches. There are some nice high spots from Sin Cara and Gabriel, some power displays by Kane, Barrett and Sheamus, but Bryan steals the show and gets the win. Highlights Sheamus power bombs Sin Cara though a ladder.

 WWE Divas champinship match Kelly Kelly Vs. Brie Bella 1 and 1/2 stars.
 I am just not a fan of the Divas. They all look good but only a few can wrestle (Beth Pheonex and Natalia come to mind). This match is proof positive for that. Kelly Kelly gets the win.

 Big Show vs. Mark Henry 2 stars
 This is your typical big man match, I was surprised that it was as good as it was. Henrey gets the win and after the match adds Big Show to the Hall of Pain.

 Raw Money in the Bank match Rey Mysterio vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Alex Riley vs. Even Brourne vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. R-truth  vs Jack Swagger.
 Good match but not as good as the Smackdown match, even though this one has more stars. the highlight of the match is when Miz take a nasty fall off the ladder goes to the back, then comes back and almost wins the thing. Del Rio gets the win, which everyone saw coming.

 WHC Title match Randy Orton (C) vs. Christian 2 and 1/2 stars
 I want it known that Christian is one of my favorites in the WWE right today. However this match could have been better. It does it's job of setting up another match at the next PPV, and whats here is good, but this match is not as good as some of their other matches of this year.

 WWE title match John Cena (C) vs. CM Punk 5 stars (more if I did not rate matches on a scale of 1-5).
 And this is the reason you should stop reading this and press the ""add to cart"" button right now. This is without a dought the best match of the year, and I think it's one of the best of all time (and I have been a WWE fan sence I was 4 years old). The crowd is very anti Cena sence we are in Punks home town.
 The story line in this match hits on a lot of peoples problems with the current WWE. CM Punk said some things that are true about WWE, and he says if he wins he is leaving with the WWE title.
 The match gose on for more the a half an hour, with a nice back and forth pace. The end where Punk hits Cena with the GTS is enough to get any Wrestling fan to cheer, then he walks out. INSTANT CLASSIC!",1325116800,,2587,3.9421965317919074
4509417,5,B004ZKKKWE,"This was, in my opinion, the PPV of the year.  Every match, every moment, made this card that much better.  I will say this was one of the most anticipated events of the year due to the main event and I got to tell you this card really delivered.  The opening match was the Smackdown Money in the Bank ladder match that featured Sheamus vs. Cody Rhodes vs. Sin Cara vs. Wade Barrett vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Justin Gabriel vs. Heath Slater vs. Kane.  This was a very good match to begin the event.  There were some very cool highspots and seeing Sheamus drive Sin Cara through a ladder was just fantastic.  The match did have a suprising victor in Daniel Bryan because most people did not believe that he was gonna win.  I think most thought it would be Sheamus winning this one.  I am glad that someone different like Bryan won the match but I really don't see him winning the world heavyweight title because I don't think the WWE wants to invest in him as champion even though the fans really want that to happen.  We'll have to see what happens but I wouldn't expect much from Bryan because the WWE for some reason has it in for him I think.  I mean here you have one of the greatest in the world (to me the top independent of all time) and the WWE is unwilling to go with him.  Way to go WWE, smart move.  As I write this it's been a few months removed from the PPV and here we have the WWE unwilling to go with Bryan as champion but they will put the strap on Mark Henry, the most boring superstar of all time!  WTF!!  The next match was Kelly Kelly vs Brie Bella for the Divas championship.  This was just a standard Divas match and nothing really special here.  Up next was Big Show vs. Mark Henry.  This match was ok but again nothing too special here (not like their matches toward the end of the year).  I didn't enjoy the match very much but some other people may.  Up next was the Raw MitB ladder match between Rey Mysterio vs. Alberto del Rio vs. R-Truth vs. Jack Swagger vs. Evan Bourne vs. Kofi Kingston vs. The Miz vs. Alex Riley.  Holy crap was this match good!  Right from the beginning when everyone started with a ladder to attack their opponents with up until the end when del Rio tore Rey's mask off to win, this match had me hooked.  I honestly feel that everyone added to this match in their own ways and of course Rey, Bourne and Kingston put on the best show with their high spots.  Also, you to give it up for Miz as he took a very sick bump in this match and hurt himself but still came back and continued this match until it was over.  I did know that del Rio was going to win and I think it was a pretty good choice for him to be the MitB winner even though I was cheering for Rey all the way.  Up next was the world heavyweight title match between Randy Orton vs. Christian.  These guys have been stealing the show at some of the other PPV's but I think this match fell flat.  I do feel part of the reason is because Christian won the title due to a DQ and didn't actually win the title via pinfall or submission.  I don't care whether you're a babyface or a heel, that is just one cowardly way to win a title.  I did like Randy snapping at the end of the match and driving Christian through a table but other then that, the match fell flat.  Lastly, we have the most anticipated main event in quite some time with John Cena defending the WWE championship against CM Punk.  This match was so anticipated because of the whole angle with Punk's WWE contract running out at midnight and with the possibility of Punk taking the title to another promotion.  The event was held in Chicago which is where Punk is from and talk about a one sided crowd, good God I haven't heard a WWE crowd being that one sided since Steve Austin was around.  This match is just a great contest that went over a half hour and actually reminded me of Punk's ROH days and IWA Mid South days.  It was back and forth and the crowd was taken on a great ride cheering Punk all the way.  When it was over Punk was champion and the WWE was left thinking what in the world is going to happen to our title.  I thought that Undertaker vs Triple H from Wrestlemania 27 was going to win Match of the Year for PWI but after seeing the main event match on this PPV I think it may just come out and steal the Match of the Year honors.  This was a great PPV and well worth seeing.  I'd give this PPV 5 stars!  Just awesome!",1322611200,,4408,4.141176470588236

MONEY IN THE BANK 2011

The John Cena look alike in the crowd tripped me out all night. Any way this was a great event with some great matches.

1.[SMACKDOWN MITB]SHEAMUS VS CODY RHODES VS WADE BARRETT VS SIN CARA VS JUSTIN GABRIEL VS HEATH SLATER VS DANIEL BRYAN VS KANE-we started the night out with an excellent match that would see some stars from Smackdown going all out. I loved this match and thought for sure my boy Barrett was going to win it. I would have to say that Sin Cara was the show stealer here, dishing out and taking punishment. Kinda like Shelton Benjamin was in the early matches. This was an excellent opening match that really put all involved over, they all looked good. Bryan eventually gets the win in a great opener.

2.[DIVA'S TITLE]KELLY KELLY VS BRIE BELLA-this was a decent Diva's match with some good moments. I honestly though don't really get into the Diva's matches unless Natie or Beth is involved. I usually go to TNA for my female wrestling. Still this was a good match with Kelly coming out on top.

3. MARK HENRY VS BIG SHOW-the story line that would lead to the story line that would finally see Mark Henry get the World Title [finally]. This was a good match of monsters, usually a big man match fails to deliver much. This time though these guys did a good job delivering the action. Although Show had moments this match was all about Mark injuring Show's leg and getting over. Henry gets the win and then still attacks the leg, good stuff.

4.[RAW MITB]ALBERTO DEL RIO VS REY MYSTERIO VS EVAN BOURNE VS R-TRUTH VS JACK SWAGGER VS KOFI KINGSTON VS THE MIZ VS ALEX RILEY-ah yes one of the matches I was most looking forward to at the time. This match is just full of awesome, and yes that includes The Miz. Miz by the way is who I wanted to win this but I was also looking at Truth or Del Rio is Miz failed. Like the last MITB match this was full of high spots and action. And for any Miz haters out there he is actually the most memorable person in this match in my opinion. No I am not saying he crushed everybody but what happened to him and what he did was truly awesome. After taking a bad fall he had to be helped to the back with a leg injury. He later would come back to the match and almost win it, he even gets a loud ovation from the fans for doing so. Any way not sure which MITB match I like more but this was also great. Del Rio takes the win as I ma sure you all know now.

5.[WORLD TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS CHRISTIAN-I absolutely loved how this match ended for sure, I wanted Christian to win the title so bad. The story here was if Randy got DQ'd he would lose the title. So the match starts and there is some great back and forth action. These two really work well together that is for sure, and Christian's whole one more match thing was starting to pick up. So at the end Christian spits in Randy's mouth so Orton kicks him in his, well he loses the title. Afterwards Randy beats Christian down but I loved that Christian was the champ.

6.[WWE TITLE]JOHN CENA VS CM PUNK-this match here is what every one who is into wrestling was talking about. Punk gave the industry a storyline that finally felt oh so real when played out. Was it you may ask, you should have been paying attention. In Punk's hometown of Chicago I knew Cena was going to get booed like crazy. This is very much a classic match, and yes you read that right. Cena vs. Punk is no doubt a classic. The action is back and forth and is an actual wrestling match with a story being told and great ring psychology. Both guys really bring it here and the match was pulled of nicely, even with the screw job [done many times now] thing at the end. Like how Cena stopped it but love how he went to sleep. Punk of course wins the title and leaves the WWE with the title and not signed, loved it.

This was a great event and I liked every match but loved some more than others. I highly recommend this event to even casual fans, buy it now. For the special feature you get the great Matt Striker interviewing Daniel Bryan.",1317340800,,4043,4.2347600518806745
4509419,5,B004ZKKKWE,"Overall this was a great show with a few momnets that slowed a little but picked right back up again especially the main event.

SmackDown MITB: Sin Cara vs Sheamus vs Cody Rhodes vs Daniel Bryan vs Kane vs Justin Gabriel vs Heath Slater vs Wade Barrett.
This was a high impact match the just kept going. A few great high spots and lots of hard hitting action, look for Sin Cara and Sheamus' spot with the ladder. Very Surprised by the winner, but very glad he did win. 9/10

Diva Championship: Kelly Kelly vs One of the Bella Twins(it really doesn't matter which one it was) Skipped the match

Big Show vs Mark Henry
It was about what I expected slow going and nothing to special, at least Mark is doing something now. 4/10

RAW MITB: Alberto Del Rio vs Evan Bourne vs Kofi Kingston vs The Miz vs Alex Riley vs R-Truth vs Jack Swagger vs Rey Mysterio.
Another great match it is really hard to decide who put on the better MITB match SmackDown or RAW, but both were fantastic. Again great spots all over the place especially Evan Bourne's Shooting Star Press off the ladder. Again another shocking winner, but glad to see that young talent is finally getting over. 9/10

World Heavyweight Championship: Randy Orton vs Christian
Not a bad match I definetly think the matches from SummerSlam and the steel cage match on SmackDown were better than this one especially considering the ending, but Orton does deliever a sick RKO to Christian on the announce table after the match. 7.5/10

WWE Championship: John Cena vs CM Punk
If for no other reason but this dvd for this one match alone it is that good and blows the other matches og the night out of the water. First off the crowd was amazing and had been ready for this all night long chanting ""CM Punk"" throughout other matches. Now let's get to the actual match these two put on a great match and beyond any doubt in my mind CM Punk gave Cena that match of his carrer. Better than his feuds with Edge, Orton, and Triple H combined this match out does them all by miles. This was not a typicla ""Super"" Cena match but rather a good bit of back and forth and Punk dominating at parts of the match with Cena making small comebacks. Again the crowd was just so into this match I cannot remember seeing a crowd so pumped for and into a match. Vinny Mac and Johnny Ace came out towards the end to try and screw Punk only to be stopped by Cena. The end came with Cena getting a GTS and pinned. Your new WWE Champion CM Punk. Like the title says I do not see any match toping this one, but you never know. Hoever as it stands this is my match of the year. 10/10",1316908800,,2603,4.302040816326531

4509431,5,B004ZKKKWE,"Smackdown Money in the Bank Ladder match featuring Sin Botcha...Cara, sorry, Wade Barrett, Sheamus, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, Daniel Bryan, Cody Rhodes, and Kane: Ever since the branding of Raw and Smackdown, the blue brand has always put on the best ""wrestling"" show. This match featured many future main eventers. Sadly, these guys work there tails off and get drafted to Raw and either survive or never heard from again and eventually released, Chris Masters recently and Chuck Palumbo are two prime examples. This match was good but suffers from what other MIB ladder matches suffer from. You see opponents on and off thru out the match and it's hard to focus on most of the action. Daniel Bryan wins in a shocker. Great opener.

Kelly Kelly VS Brie Belle: Skip

Mark Henry VS Big Show: I was surprised how well this match went. Big Show pulled off a few cool moves. Henry wins with world's strongest slam and two splashes. Henry breaks Show's ankle afterwards.

Raw Money in The Bank featuring Rey Mysterio, Alberto Del Rio, Evan Bourne, Kofi Kingston, The Miz, Alex Riley, R-Truth, Jack Swagger: Everyone grabs a ladder as the enter, bell rings, and they attack Del Rio with it. They then throw the ladders onto Del Rio on the outside. Probably the best five opening minutes to a MIB match but they kept on using a little ladder to reach the briefcase. Miz appears to hurt his knee after falling off the ladder. This match had alot of good spots, a must see.

World Champion Randy Orton VS Christian: If Orton gets disqualified, Christian will win the title. These two have always had good matches and this was a good way for Christian win the world title considering his persona. I'm just glad Christian's championship regin lasted longer then two days.

CM Punk VS John Cena: This was the first match I was looking foward too in the longest time. I didn't know what was going happen and it made for a great match. The Chicago crowd was lively and made for a fun experince. This was one helluva good match. Vince McMahon comes down with his new stooge, John Laurintis (who cares how you spell it) and tries to recreate the Montreal incident but Cena puts a stop to it. Punk wins cleanly with the GTS. Vince goes crazy, trying to have Del Rio come out, and cash it in but he fails. Punk slips thru the crowd with the belt after blowing Vince a kiss. I friggin love Punk, always have.

Overall, one of the best WWE PPV's in years that lived up to it's own hype. The two MIB matches were excellent, Henry-Show was actually good, Orton-Christian just progessed the feud, and Punk-Cena lived up to expectations. WWE is starting to look good after years of being boring and predictable. A must own PPV.",1314144000,,2707,4.605809128630705
4509432,5,B004ZKKKWE,"I'm not going to sugar-coat it: Money in the Bank 2011 is the best WWE show of the last decade.  Every match (excluding the Divas one) was stellar, and there hasn't been a more important and exciting main event in years.  So right off the bat, I find it impossible to give this DVD anything less than five-stars.  The content of the PPV was just too good.  That said, you should know that there are no real extras offered on this disc.  This DVD is as bare-bones as they come, which is a little disappointing.  But hey, you only had to wait a month to rewatch the show, I guess you should be thankful for that.

Let's get into why this show was so special:

- The gimmick of this show is, of course, the two Money in the Bank matches.  Each match consists of several mid-carders vying in a ladder match for a guaranteed Championship title shot.  These matches have historically been spot-fests, and that rings true once again in 2011.  The lengths to which each wrestler goes in these matches to entertain is truly amazing.  They put their bodies in harms way, and tell a fantastic story.

- The winners of the Money in the Bank matches were Daniel Bryan (Smackdown) and Alberto Del Rio (Raw).  Both very deserving guys.  Del Rio has deserved to be in the main event scene for about a year now, and Daniel Bryan was a huge surprise.  He's not the most popular wrestler on Smackdown, but he may be the most talented one.

- Christian vs. Orton was a good match with an excellent finish.  The spit/low-blow/disqualification was a smart way to win the Title for Christian.  It also allowed Orton to show a different side of his character when he went nuts afterwards.  The crowd went crazy when he let his anger show, and it was a lot of fun to watch.

- Of course, the real reason this show was so good was its main event: CM Punk vs. John Cena.  The hype surrounding the match was perfect - Punk's contract was up, and he wanted to leave the WWE with the Championship Title.  And what better place to do so than his hometown of Chicago?

Punk and Cena went for 35 minutes, which is almost unheard of in the WWE these days.  They told a fantastic, simple story.  Mat wrestling at its best.  The match was even better thanks to the Chicago crowd.  They were perhaps the best crowd in wrestling history, popping every time Punk got the upper-hand on Cena.  Punk went from heel to face in the course of the 35 minutes, all thanks to his hometown crowd.

The finish was excellent, with CM Punk defeating Cena relatively clean (say what you will about the distraction to Cena, Punk was distracted just before that, which allowed Cena to get the upper-hand) and leaving from the arena through the crazy crowd.  It was a great moment, and one that will be remembered for many years.

It was just an excellent show all around.  If you haven't seen it already, buy this.  And if you have, buy it anyway.  It's one of the few WWE shows that deserves to be watched multiple times.",1313798400,2,2967,4.391544117647059
4509433,5,B004ZKKKWE,"Both Raw's & Smackdown's MITB ladder matches were phenomenal and just as hardcore as the TLC matches from late 90's & early 2000's. The Divas title match was forgettable at best. The Mark Henry-Big Show match was pretty much a big man brawl but better then the Divas title match. The World title between Randy Otron-Christian was just as good as their bout from Over The Limit even with the DQ ending. The CM Punk-John Cena-WWE Title match was a jaw-dropping,back-and-forth,heart-pounding,smash-mouth match of the year candidate and just as good as the Ricky Steamboat-Ric Flair matches from the NWA in the late 1980s. I give this event a 9 out of 10.",1313712000,,651,4.821428571428571
4509434,5,B004ZKKKWE,This is a great wrestling dvd..probably the best in a long while. The two money in the bank ladder matches are great and so is Orton/Christian match. The CM Punk vs John Cena title match is one for the ages..an epic battle going back and forth with huge pops from the fans the entire time! The History books were rewritten and the wrestling world was changed on this night. This is a MUST OWN piece of history!,1313539200,,410,4.337662337662338
4509435,5,B004ZKKKWE,"Can't really say much more about the show than some of the reviewers have already said but I will say that the crowd during the main event was one of the craziest that I remember and I've been following wrestling since about 1997... I would compare the crowd reaction to the unforgiven 2006 pay per view when Edge returned to Canada to take on cena for the title...you felt like their was no way C.M Punk was going to lose....and I do like how they gave CM Punk an extended entrance, it really gave him a chance to get the crowd going.",1313539200,3,535,4.254901960784314

4509437,4,B004ZKKKWE,"This is the second MITB ppv. While I still think MITB should have remained a permanent fixture at WM with both RAW & SD stars
competing in one match, last year's ppv was good & so was this. The hype surrounding CM Punk's contract is what sold this ppv for me & for many.

SD's MITB Ladder Match: Sin Cara vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Kane vs. Justin Gabriel vs. Heath Slater vs. Wade Barrett vs. Sheamus vs. Cody Rhodes - Whenever you see a ladder match, a multi-man ladder match, or high fliers (Sin Cara), you're bound to see some crazy spots. This had some. I don't wanna give too much away because this match is WORTH WATCHING.

Divas Champion Kelly Kelly vs. Brie Bella - KK is getting better. Gotta give her major credit. Just wish this division had more time to shine though & wish Finlay was still their trainer.

Big Show vs. Mark Henry - What I liked about this is that it wasn't long. IMO, they could have kept this match on SD & give more time to the match above. Big Show sold well here so I give him props.

RAW Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Rey Mysterio vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Alex Riley vs. Evan Bourne vs. The Miz vs. Jack Swagger vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. R-Truth - During their entrances, each guy brought a ladder into the ring. Guess what that means? A GREAT match here. Don't know which match I liked better, this one or SD's and it was the same way at MITB 2010. That's good because it just means they had multiple great matches. The ending (minus the guy who won) kinda ruined it a bit for me. Aside from that, it was great

World Champion Randy Orton vs. Christian - There were stips going into this which stated that if the referee makes a bad call or Orton is DQed,  he'd lose the WHC. I kinda felt those stips were.....idk. I like Christian's current heel persona. TO me, he always shined more as a heel. I understand the match finish from a certain standpoint. But it was still stupid. The aftermath is even worse lol.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. C.M. Punk - Re-watch the buildup to this & then watch this match. I'm not a Cena fan. But when he's in the ring with certain opponents, he comes out looking better than he does on a daily bases. Colt Cabana, who was known in WWE as ""Scotty Goldman"" for a short time, was front row at ringside. All I can really say about this match without giving anything away is that it is, without any doubt, one of the greatest matches in their careers. And this was one of the BEST angles/storylines in WWE, possibly all of wrestling & that is all thanks to one man, CM Punk.

Conclusion: Get this for the Orton/Christian match (ending & aftermath aside, it was still a great match in their series), Cena/Punk, RAW & SD's MITB matches.",1312070400,,2690,4.281496062992126
4509438,5,B004ZKKKWE,"If alot of you know me I am a big time ROH fan. I ragged on WWE for the last few years for being soft lifeless. Well this ppv put some life back into the WWE. Let me just say from top to bottom this was one for the ages. I will buy this on bluray when it comes out. Both Money In The Bank matches were stellar. Orton/Christian stellar Show vs Henry was okay for what it was.

Kelly Kelly vs Brie Bella eh it was okay. HOWEVER the best match on the card was Cena vs Punk. I am from Chicago and I never seen the Chicago crowd so pumped up. You would have thought the Cubs won the World Series or something. I am so happy with the outcome I won't spoil it. I am a big CM Punk fan and this one just had the feel of a heavyweight fight. It had it all shoot promos drama excitement. It just had everything the crowd Cena being booed. I have to give Cena credit he brought his A game.

This was one hell of a ppv. Last week TNA put on a good ppv with Destination X.  Money in the Bank blew it out of the water. Buy this dvd I promise you will love it!

I watched CM Punk grow into the great wrestler that he is today. I almost had tears in my eyes. I always knew Punk had the goods dating back to 2002. Great stuff. PUNK POWER!!!",1311120000,2,1222,3.7992125984251968
4509439,4,B004ZKKKWE,"SmackDown Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Sin Cara vs. Daniel Bryan vs. Kane vs. Justin Gabriel vs. Heath Slater vs. Wade Barrett vs. Sheamus vs. Cody Rhodes - As expected in a multi-man ladder match, this was full of crazy moments & spots such as Daniel Bryan dropkicking Gabriel off the ladder, back to back to back to back top rope dives onto the outside, Sin Cara's unique version of a top rope superplex, Sheamus' powerbomb on Sin Cara through a ladder, the reunion of the Corre, Sheamus & Kane paying tribute to the Road Warriors, Slater being dead weight on top of a ladder before being swung off, Sheamus being chokeslammed on a wedged ladder...that didn't give, how Gabriel pulled off a 450 splash, Barrett delivering a Wasteland onto the floor, and Daniel Bryan showing he could put you in a submission from anywhere.  This was the quality you would expect from a this type of ladder match.

Divas Champion Kelly Kelly vs. Brie Bella - Brie came out with her twin sister Nikki while Kelly had Eve in her corner as this was just the typical divas match that was nothing special but I'll give credit to Kelly Kelly for improving better than she was around this time a year ago.

Big Show vs. Mark Henry - Michael Cole called this ""The Battle Of The Behemoths"" as The World's Largest Athlete went against The World's Strongest Man.  Show started out using his own power early with a shoulder tackle that knocked Mark Henry out of the ring followed by throwing him into the steps. Henry would recover by dropkicking the steps into Show's previously injured knee then continued to focus on it by clipping it from behind & even applying a half Boston Crab submission.  Show was able to somewhat recover & go for a top rope shoulderblock but hurt his own knee on the way down leaving him open for Henry to deliver various splashes & World's Strongest Slams with him ensuring after the match that Show wouldn't be walking out of the ring.  This was a good ""big man"" match as it didn't go long & told a good story working around Show's bad leg.

RAW Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Rey Mysterio vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Alex Riley vs. Evan Bourne vs. The Miz vs. Jack Swagger vs. Alberto Del Rio vs. R-Truth - You knew exactly where this match was going when all of the competitors decided to grab a ladder & bring it into the ring with them during their entrance.  Various highlights including everyone targeting Del Rio right from the start with their ladders to the point where he was buried underneath them & Mysterio being throwing on top of pile shortly afterwords, Kofi & Bourne fighting on top of a ladder that wasn't open before having a unique tug of war with it resulting in Rey using it as a springboard for a frakensteiner, R-Truth on the receiving end of a atomic drop that hurt every man watching, the highest ""Air Bourne"" you'll ever see, the dangerous way Miz fell off the ladder that I'm surprised didn't snap his knee in half, Mysterio & Bourne literally climbing over others to get to the case, Swagger taking a page out of Bryan's playbook earlier in the night by applying a submission from anywhere, the unique 619 Mysterio delivered using a ladder, everyone fighting for the case at once, and Swagger taking a nasty fall off the ladder.  Although this match was different than the one earlier, it was still quality.

World Champion Randy Orton vs. Christian - Christian had special stipulations invoked here stating that if the referee makes a bad call or Orton gets disqualified then he would lose the World Championship.  Knowing these stipulations, Christian tried Orton various times days earlier on SmackDown & continued it right away by grabbing a chair & daring him to use it before taking control early.  Orton attempted to work a different strategy than normal by trying to leave his feet with it being countered one time opening the door for Christian to take advantage with a top rope headbutt.  Both men knew each other so well that they were able to keep countering & avoiding each others signature moves like the RKO & Killswitch along with Orton leapfrogging over Christian when attempting the spear before delivering what was a delayed gutwrench neckbreaker.  However the stipulations for this match worked right into Christian's favor as he did a tactic that even ""heel"" Michael Cole thought was distasteful in order for Orton to finally snap & cost him the championship...but that didn't stop Orton as after the match as he gave 2 RKO's to the spanish announce table that didn't give at all.  This was a step below their great encounters on SmackDown & Over The Limit but was definitely better than their match the month before at Capitol Punishment as they worked the storyline of Orton trying to control his anger well here which hasn't always been the case in these type of matches with this stipulation (see WrestleMania 25).

WWE Champion John Cena vs. C.M. Punk - As everyone already knows, the big story here is that Punk made it clear that his contract expires that night & he planned on walking out of the company with the WWE Championship with Vince McMahon making it clear that he didn't want that to happen (think Survivor Series '97) & that John Cena would be fired if that took place.  This is the first time I can remember John Cena being in such a hostile territory with the audience since ECW One Night Stand around 5 years earlier as the crowd was completely pro-C.M. Punk to the point where they were cheering for him before he ever came out while Cena didn't do his usual ""play to the crowd/salute"" entrance as he was all business by walking straight to the ring & holding up the championship while it should be noted that ex-NWA Champion & Punk's good friend Colt Cabana (who was in WWE for a short time as Scotty Goldman & the man Punk's been mentioning on TV in the past few weeks) was in the front row.  Cena was greeted with ""You Can't Wrestle"" chants from the start & responded to it by actually doing wrestling such as reversing Punk's attempted at the Anaconda Vice into an armbar while coming to a stalemate with Punk at both escape attempts at an Attitude Adjustment & G.T.S.  The chants from the crowd started to split & duel against each other which caused Booker T to reference ""Rocky 4"" of all things with when even Colt at ringside getting some small chants.  Punk focused on Cena's neck reversing the A.A. into a DDT while later delivering a top rope kneedrop onto Cena's neck on the apron.  There was a point where Punk attempted a crossbody block but mistimed it as Cena ended up hurting his knee while Punk's midsection as effected which Cena tried to capitalize on with an abdominal stretch.  Both men went on to find unique counters to each others signature moves including a great series of counters that saw a flying crossbody, A.A., G.T.S., STF, and modified Anaconda Vice.  The big factor happened when Vince appeared & attempt to do what we've seen in the past to keep his title in his company only for that to be what ended up causing him & the WWE to have the result that he didn't want.  While this was definitely one of Punk's best matches in WWE, the shock here was the fact that he pulled something out of John Cena that I honestly can't remember seeing out of him in a very long time...if EVER as the match went close to half an hour & Cena didn't ""phone it in"" like he's done for the last few PPV's.  Definitely a highlight in WWE's history along with the careers of BOTH men involved here.

Bottom line is that this was one of the best PPV's of the year as there wasn't a bad unwatchable match on here (the divas was decent & watchable) so I would definitely recommend going out of the way to watch this.",1311120000,3,7698,4.548083875632683

3. R-Truth vs Rey Mysterio vs Evan Bourne vs Alberto Del Rio vs Jack Swagger vs Kofi Kingston vs Alex Riley vs Miz, RAW Money In The Bank Ladder Match: This was a very good match but really overshadowed because of the other MITB match earlier in the night, I still had a lot of fun watching it though, this one was a lot shorter but they crammed the spots into the 15 minutes that they got, there was one awesome spot in the match where Bourne hit a shooting star press off a ladder outside the ring, it looked so cool, I liked the way the WWE kept making us guess who was going to win, overall this match was very enjoyable

4. Randy Orton(c) vs Christian, World Heavyweight Title: The match was pretty good but the worst in there fued, the wrestling wasn't as sharp as there other matches, I was fine with the ending but it was a dissapointing was for Christian to win the title, and we know that there will be Orton vs Christian... AGAIN!!!

5. John Cena(c) vs CM Punk, WWE Title: Going into this match I thought it would be pretty good, I knew the crowd was going to be great but I didn't know whether the match would deliver or not, words cannot describe how amazing this match was, this was unbelievable, first of all the crowd were going crazy through the whole 35 minutes of the match, Cena was actually the most hated guy in Chicago at the time, the match started with some great technical wrestling, then they started to hit the spots and finishers, this was an amazing wrestled match by both men, but the drama of the match was best of all in my opinion, so many finishers countered, lots of near falls, I just didn't know who was going to win this thing, the end was PERFECT, the moment was beautiful and very emotional, the right man won without a doubt, the match was excellent, and is my favourite match in the WWE this year, theres nothing about the match that wasn't 5 stars

I have never been to USA, but thanks to that great storyline, I am still addicted to that match, and I still feel that I am sitting with the crowd watching that match, awaiting Vince McMahon make the wrong decision to make Cena the winner, and go on a riot against WWE.

When you mix Chicago with good/great matches, you get a hell of a pay-per-view.

SmackDown Money in the Bank Ladder Match
Daniel Bryan v. Sheamus v. Kane v. Wade Barrett v. Sin Cara v. Cody Rhodes v. Heath Slater v. Justin Gabriel  4.2/5
- WOW. What a way to start the show off. This is one of my favorite MITB matches. A lot of cool spots in this one and you couldn't look away from this one folks. Came down to Daniel Bryan and Wade Barrett (who I thought was gonna win), Bryan kicked him in the head and got the briefcase.

Diva's Championship
Kelly Kelly(c) (w/ Eve) v. Brie Bella (w/ Nikki)  2.4/5
- Kelly gets the win and retains the DIva's championship.

Big Show v. Mark Henry  3.4/5
- I very much enjoyed this match and thought it was a very good big man match. Mark Henry gets the win after two splashes, I believe, and takes out Big Show. Enters him into the Hall of Pain.

RAW Money in the Bank Ladder Match
Rey Mysterio v. The Miz v. Alex Riley v. Evan Bourne v. Kofi Kington v. Alberto Del Rio v. Jack Swagger v. R-Truth  3.7/5
- Not as good as the Smackdown brand's, but still an entertaining match up! Lots of ladders. Del Rio gets the win and becomes the Raw Money in the Bank winner, it was his destiny of course.

World Heavyweight Championship, If Orton got DQ'ed or if there was Poor Officating he would lose the Championship
Randy Orton(c) v. Christian  3.6/5
- These two guys have great chemistry, and I enjoy there matches. A lot. Christian spat in Orton's face, which caused him to kick him in his lower parts. Christian won the World title by DQ. Then after the match, Orton RKO'ed Christian twice on the announcer's table.

WWE Championship
John Cena(c) v. CM Punk  5/5
- WOW. CM Punk and John Cena, I don't care what y'all say but these guys are two of the best of this era. This match was just amazing and they did not disappoint. Punk and Cena have terrific chemistry in the ring. Always deliver in the ring. Back n' forth and Back n' forth and Back n' forth this match went. Punk wins the match and the WWE Championship, kicks Del Rio in the head, and leaves the WWE with its championship. If that isn't a great ending, I don't know what is.

8450005,5,B004ZKKKWE,"Now normally in this day and age, I don't keep up much with the current WWE product but I'd be lying to say that I wasn't looking forward to this one. The backstory here was that CM Punk's contract was going to expire on this night in his hometown in Chicago. Only problem is that his last match is against WWE Champion John Cena that lead to a series of worked shoot interviews in which Punk claimed that he was going to leave the company with the championship even to the point where WWE Chairman Vince McMahon vowed to fire Cena if that were to happen.

SmackDown Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Daniel Bryan vs Sin Cara vs Kane vs Justin Gabriel vs Sheamus vs Wade Barrett vs Heath Slater vs Cody Rhodes. First of all, I want to warn those viewers who don't like Michael Cole's commentary as he just goes overboard early with his comments. This got off to quite start as it was non-stop action with so many highlights such as a tribute to the LOD, Sin Cara showing his high-flying style including delivering a unique suplex from the ladder to Bryan, Bryan applying submissions from various places, Kane's dominance, Sheamus' powerbomb to Sin Cara through a ladder that you just knew had to hurt, Slater being swung off from the top of the ladder, Sheamus receiving a chokeslam onto a ladder without any give, the reunion & eventual downfall of the Corre but not before Warrett delivered Wasteland on the floor. This was a hell of an opening match that the crowd ate up from start to finish with the sentimental favorite in this match being the shocking result.

Divas Champion Kelly Kelly vs Brie Bella. Each diva brought a representative in their corner such as Kelly having Eve in her corner while Brie had her twin sister Nikki in hers. Normally divas matches don't tend to be much as they are more to calm the crowd down before the next match but this was a decent & well worked match between these two that probably had more effort than anyone was expecting.

Big Show vs Mark Henry. This was labeled as the ""World's Largest Athlete vs World's Strongest Man"" but the more interesting part was considering the amount of build-up that this match had based on WWE's tendency to just throw matches together for mid-cards. Anyways based on both men's styles, this was a power vs power match with Show getting the early momentum with a shoulder block. However Henry was able to recover with the use of the steel steps and began a method of working over Show's previous ankle injury with even applying a one-legged boston crab. Show was able to recover before it was one move that again affected Show's ankle allowing Henry to take advantage for the win but not before Henry left one final impression. This match didn't last long but it was a better match than expected as both men played to their strengths and provided story-telling around Show's ankle.

RAW Money In The Bank Ladder Match: Alberto Del Rio vs Rey Mysterio vs Kofi Kingston vs The Miz vs Evan Bourne vs R-Truth vs Jack Swagger vs Alex Riley. This was different than the previous ladder match as each competitor actually brought a ladder with them to the ring to single-out one superstar in particular who had alot to say about being in this match. However like the previous ladder match, this match had highlight as well such as R-Truth playing off his fear of heights by getting the smallest ladder, Del Rio being buried (literally) under a series of ladders before Mysterio would be thrown through the ropes onto Del Rio & the ladders, Kofi & Bourne fighting for a ladder that wasn't open before Mysterio took full advantage of the situation, various top rope dives to the outside including the highest shooting star press that I can recall seeing, Miz taking a very bad fall that looked like a serious knee injury, Mysterio & Bourne climbing over the other wrestlers, the fights on top of the ladder that even lead to Miz returning to a big pop before getting sunset-flipped powerbombed by Mysterio & Swagger taking a very painful fall off the ladder. However the real highlight was how near the end of the match, the crowd turned on Mysterio to the point where Rey's mask was a factor in the winner achieving a part of his ""destiny"" much to the delight of the crowd. This didn't top the earlier ladder match but it didn't need to as it stood out on it's own.

World Champion Randy Orton vs Christian. This was their fourth match in their series with the special stipulation being that if Orton gets disqualified or the referee makes an error in judgment (as referred to their previous encounter) then Christian would win the championship. Although Michael Cole tried to make it seem the crowd was ""pro-Orton"", the audience was more towards Christian while later on being split. Early in the match, Christian tried to use the rules to his advantage by picking up a chair & turning his back daring Orton to strike him with it. Considering their series at this time, both men knew each other well as they had a series of reversals & counters to their signature moves that hadn't been explored in other matches like the counters from the RKO to the Killswitch or even Orton avoiding the spear at times. However eventually Christian was able to use the rules of this match against Orton by doing something that not only caused Orton to get disqualifed but also send Orton over the edge (no pun intended) by delivering two RKOs onto the announce table as a final point. This wasn't their best match in this series but I felt was better than their last PPV match as the stipulation here didn't take away from the match at all & used it properly.

WWE Champion John Cena vs CM Punk. Punk entered to a ""Hero's Welcome"" in his hometown of Chicago while Cena entered to a large chorus of boos that perhaps hadn't been heard so loud since ECW One Night Stand in 2006. As everyone already knows, the hype here was CM Punk's contract expiring this night but also planned to leave with the championship while Vince McMahon promised to fire Cena if that were to take place. Both men started off with chain wrestling resulting in a series of stalemates between the two with one funny moment early being Punk's reaction to a ""You Can't Wrestle"" chant directed at Cena. Cena attempted to use his power to control Punk with actual wrestling holds such as a front facelock, headlock & armbar that Punk tried to counter into an Anaconda Vice. Punk was able to regain control by working over Cena's neck by countering Cena's A.A. into a DDT before applying a reverse triangle choke, & dropping a knee from the top rope while Cena was hanging off the apron that even hurt Punk's knee. There was a telling point in this match where Punk attempted a flying body press but actually landed on Cena's knee which not only hurt Cena's knee but also hurt Punk's midsection with Cena using an abdominal stretch for advantage. The Cena fans started to become more vocal as both men started to pull out all the stops with various counters & reversals including an awesome sequence from a body press into an A.A. countered into a GTS into an STF only to counter into an anaconda vice before applying an A.A. from that position. However the turning point of this match was the appearance of Vince McMahon & Johnny Ace (can't spell his last name even if I tried) who attempted to recreate an infamous moment held in another star's hometown with Cena not only putting a stop to that but also leaving an opportunity for a result that the crowd wanted but not what Vince wanted. This was a highlight match for both men's careers as Punk brought more out of Cena than previous opponents while Cena really stepped his game up to not only put on high quality performance but also one of the best matches in the companies' history with the crowd just adding more to the match. Without a doubt, worthy of it's ""Match Of The Year"" status.

One more thing, keep watching after the match as Vince tried to get the winner of an earlier Money In The Bank match to cash in his briefcase to no avail with Punk exiting through his crowd after blowing a kiss to Vince...with the WWE Championship in hand.

Overall, this was one of the best events that I have seen WWE put out in quite some time as this event had a big match build & feel to that doesn't happen alot during this day & age of professional wrestling with the wrestlers stepping up their game & taking advantage of the moment. Highly recommend.",1378425600,,8426,4.553430079155673
