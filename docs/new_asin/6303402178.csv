660042,4,6303402178,"I certainly agree that Rae Dawn Chong is outstanding and I also agree concerning Martin Sheen (Am I in the right film?) However, the person who totally stole the film (in my opinion) is Tarcisio Meira. (He of the gold teeth) The chilling, casual way he murders those in his way convinced me. His was truly a shocking performance. I've seen very little about him. Does anyone have any information about him?",1172102400,,406,4.652777777777778
660043,5,6303402178,Very stylish melodramatic movie. I wish they would put this movie on DVD already. Superb acting. There is a great love scene from the incredibly gorgeous Rae Dawn Chong. Other than Quest For Fire this is her best movie.,1069804800,7,219,4.641025641025641
660044,4,6303402178,"This is a different and interesting film that involves the viewers emotions. Chong's performance is outstanding. Her talents are often underated. Watching this film that mistake is almost impossible to make. The film has weak points,but is certainly worth watching. At times touching,brutal,erotic--it can take you for a ride.",1015545600,4,326,5.673469387755102

7848174,5,6303402178,"It's a movie about poverty, debt, a culture that utilizes whatever resources necessary to become meaningful within their society.  Money gives birth to guns, guns provide power, power equals success within this society.  I loved this movie because it borders on risqu foreign and is shockingly outside what is considered the norm.",1478736000,2,330,5.326923076923077
7848175,3,6303402178,Very sexual Rae Dawn Chong is gorgeous which is the reason I bought the movie. I only wish they had it in DVD.,1403308800,,110,3.8260869565217392
7848176,3,6303402178,The VHS version is so old and ran down. Part of the video is corrupted. It is a shame I could not see everything. It was a waist of money!,1372636800,,138,3.6333333333333333
7848177,5,6303402178,"The above quotes define the man known as Boca DeRosa, a fictional crime lord in 1990s Rio. Boca's savagery always comes with a purpose, however- a purpose that will benefit him in the end. Boca's cruelty seems to be exhibited for his own calculating purposes.

Rae Dawn Chong plays JJ, a headstong American reporter who does not know when to say no to a story. She is determined to get to the bottom of who is killing the children of Rio. The killers are rumored to be Justiceiros (Police). After seeing a man known as Boca save children from a death squad headed by the police, JJ becomes enamoured with this ""Robin Hood of Rio."" With the help of her ex beau, JJ goes into that seamy underworld of Rio, where the Favelas make the American ghettos look like Park Avenue. Indeed, the Favelas are so violent that they have more deaths in them in a year than are recorded in all the West Bank of Gaza!

The story is rich in detail and the characters flourish. Martin Sheen's cameo is an added bonus which gives the film an added layer of quality that will interest any and all who like films in this genre. I won't give away the middle and ending. I'll only say that the movie appealed to me and showed a true Rio of the middle 1990s in all of its many facets. Had the movie had a larger budget and been released more widely in United States, I'm certain Rae dawn Chong would have received a Golden Globe nomination.

The Favelas of 2012 are being cleared of their violent troublemakers in preparation for the World Cup of 2014 and the 2016 Summer Olympics; yet the underlying poverty and inequality (Although Lessening in Brazil) still remain. I recommend this movie to any who enjoy foreign films with an international cast and a flair of suspense and drama. Unfortunately this movie is unavailable on DVD. this is another travesty that needs to be dealt with. I must request that the distributors of this fine drama release it onto DVD so the masses may enjoy it. There are few people who own VHS units today, which means it is beyond reach of the average American consumer. This can be rectified by mass producing and warehousing the flick. If you are somehow able to gain a copy of this great work I can honestly say you won't be disappointed.

7848178,4,6303402178,"I lived in Venezuela for 4 years, went to high school there, so this movie had extra interest for me.  It's an accurate visual, good story, well acted and editing makes the movie something special, almost surreal. Four stars only because it's not as good as Dr Zhivago, etc., which I would rate 5 stars.

I won't go into the plot much, only that it's about street kids in Brazil, drugs, exploitation and murder.  I was in Caracas, Venezuela, 1965-1969, the streets were full of little kids in rags, some as young as 5yrs., selling El Mundo, the most popular newspaper.  They lived in the sewers, would swipe anything not nailed down, lived off the scraps left from outdoor restaurants, whatever they could get.

I revisited Venezuela in the 1990's, and the city (Caracas) was cleaned up, the street kids not visible.  There are more poor living in the hills surrounding Caracas, not less, than in the 60's; one idea about what happens to the  kids is addressed in Boca.

Well worth a view if you can find it, not available in DVD, only VHS, used.",1300320000,2,1046,4.586021505376344
7848179,5,6303402178,Deep dark semi film noir that really brings out the true acting ability of this somewhat overlooked actress.,1277424000,,108,5.055555555555555
7848180,5,6303402178,"I'm a fan of Rae Dawn Chong which is the reason I purchased this movie.  The movie isn't all that great in that the photography is rather disjointed, flashing in and out of scenes and sometimes a little hard to follow what is happening.  There are some rather, gritty scenes of poverty in Brazil. Rae Dawn Chong was great, so I was satisfied with the purchase.
The supplier was particularly co-operative in that they sent the movie weeks before Amazon gave as the shipping date, and they included a DVD copy of this 1994 VHS movie, at no extra charge.",1271376000,,551,4.5
7848181,3,6303402178,"The premise of the story is real. I ordered the film on the advice of a Brazilian co-worker from Rio; tired of all the ""Brazilian"" films that gloss over the reality of the streets of Rio. Although an older film, the story still rings true today. If you liked this film but found it a bit lacking; rent ""City of God"" AND the Brazilian television series ""City of Men"" (shown a couple of years ago on the Sundance Channel).",1242864000,,420,4.329113924050633
7848182,5,6303402178,"I agree with one reviewer here who says that the characters of Boca himself, the brutal gangster, and his feral Brazilian mistress - they are the jewels in this film.  One of the most memorably erotic movies I have ever seen.  I wish, like another reviewer, that it would come out as a DVD.  I'd snap it up in a second.",1211328000,,319,4.19672131147541
