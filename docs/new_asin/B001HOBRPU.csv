8309220,5,B001HOBRPU,"I visited Denmark and Sweden in 2014. On evening in Copenhagen I was talking with the clerk at my hotel and he asked me what made me want to visit Scandinavia. I replied that I was a fan of the new Nordic Noir shows like The Killing, (Original version), The Bridge, (Original Danish/Swedish version) and Borgen. He replied to me that I needed to see Matador, (it means Monopoly in English), because it was the most beloved series in the history of Denmark.
  A few days later, while traveling in  Malm, Sweden I had a conversation about TV with my cab driver. HE mentioned Matador and concurred with the clerk that I indeed needed to see it. Next day, a Sunday, I am walking down the pedestrian shopping street, (Strget), in Copenhagen when I am approached by a well dressed man who starts to address me in Danish. When I let him know I am an American and know very little Danish, he switches to English and informs me that it is European Election day, and he is running for EU Parliament. He asks me what I am doing and I tell him I am looking for a video store. He tells me where one is and asks me if there was something specific I was looking for or just going to browse. I name a few things I am looking for, then mention that I might get Matador because I ave had so many people recommend it. He tells me that I absolutely should see it because it is the best thing ever on Danish TV. Well, that was it. EVERYONE I met said it was the best thing ever in Denmark, so I bought it. It does not disappoint. It is a marvelous drama. Not noir or crime, but a great story about the people in a little town from the late 1920's to the late 1940's. I do not think it is better than the political Drama Borgen, my favorite Danish series, but Matador is a triumph and well worth seeing.",1450483200,5,1781,4.171511627906977
8309221,5,B001HOBRPU,"I grew up in Denmark and it was wonderful to be able to recognize so many small authentic items used in the series. The acting is outstanding, leaving me wanting more. I think I'm ready to watch the entire series again.
I was able to play it without any problem on my US DVD player.",1420070400,2,282,4.1454545454545455
8309222,5,B001HOBRPU,Really a must see if you are at all interested in Denmark. The series chronicles the changes wrought by the 20th Century to life in a small town from 1929 through 1947. Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany throughout WW2 and the invasion midway through the series is no less shocking for knowing it was coming. A must see.,1402358400,,322,4.47457627118644
8309223,5,B001HOBRPU,An extremely good way to get acquainted with life in Denmark before WW2 featureing some of the top most Danish contemporary artists.,1373846400,4,132,5.045454545454546
8309224,5,B001HOBRPU,"I watched this series with my Danish grandmother one summer. Now that she has passed away, I am buying this as a wonderful memory that we shared. She grew up in Denmark at the exact same time as Daniel Skerden child. It was so wonderful to see what the events looked like that my grandmother experienced. It is not just for Danes, this is a series that everyone can enjoy!",1356480000,2,372,4.328571428571428
