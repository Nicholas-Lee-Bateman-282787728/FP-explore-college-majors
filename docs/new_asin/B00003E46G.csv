7918327,5,B00003E46G,"Great movie! Mostly my childhood nostalgia speaking, but I just love the fact that it exists! I think it is still a good introduction for children to one of the greatest pieces of literature ever written.",1417996800,,204,4.694444444444445
7918328,4,B00003E46G,"Used for middle school classroom, worked well and was appropriate. Able to compare/contrast from stories from scholastic greek myths teacher guide book. It even sparked conversation about the evolution of graphics and cartoon technology.",1400803200,,237,6.0
7918329,5,B00003E46G,And they loved it.  And I loved it because it didn't have the profanity/violence associated with almost all modern movies connected to ancient Greek and Roman times.,1389398400,,165,5.111111111111111
7918330,4,B00003E46G,"We used this video for a unit I wrote using a children's version of The Odyssey by Gillian Cross (obtained on Amazon also.)  The aim was for the students to compare two versions of the same literature, discussing and writing about them.  For my purpose, this story was ideal.  It deviated from the original to make it briefer and more child friendly.  My class was horrified that Odysseus met Penelope on his trip, and I was very pleased! Great essays resulted. A sixth grade social studies class learning about ancient Greece borrowed it from me later, and those students loved it.  Their teacher was also quite happy with the video.",1371686400,,634,4.7272727272727275
7918331,4,B00003E46G,"With my 9th grade students I read portions of ""The Odyssey"".  I bought this because it was so cheap and I thought I'd give it a try.  While not as exciting as the full length film, it was surprisingly accurate and similar to the version of The ODyssey that appears in our text book.  Plus there are no scenes I need to edit.  I allowed my class to watch it as a review for a final exam.",1318291200,,386,3.9740259740259742
7918332,5,B00003E46G,"I too purchased this disc at the Dollar Tree but, 3 kids and 6 years later, it is by far the best dollar I have ever spent on entertainment! It has action, suspense, and danger that my entire family has grown to enjoy.",1252972800,,218,4.093023255813954
7918333,1,B00003E46G,"I had purchased this video with the high hopes of having a third source to compare/contrast with the Hallmark Odyssey and the excerpts in the Literature book I use with my 9th graders...HOWEVER, I think I lost more IQ points watching this video than I did in my ""Math for Dummies"" course in college!

Frankly, I remember watching a ""Ducktails"" version of ""The Odyssey"" that was truer to the text than this video.

I tried out the interactive quiz that is included on the DVD and couldn't pass it the first 5 times I took it (though, I did try to take it before watching the video... obviously that was my downfall). Anyone with ANY knowledge of the text would not be able to pass it. For example, there is a question that says ""Poseidon is the god of..."" the sea, something else, earthquakes, or both the sea & earthquakes. Most material I've read says ""both"" would be the correct answer; however, for the video it is only the sea.

Honestly, I'm glad I only paid $1 for it at ""The Dollar Tree."" Had I paid more, I'd be asking for a refund.",1188086400,3,1040,4.3782383419689115
7918334,2,B00003E46G,"The back of the packaging reads, "". . . [Odysseus'] faithful wife, Penelope, is wooed by many ambitious Princelings who hope to capture his throne. . . ."" Oddly, this version of the Odyssey has neither a ""Penelope"" waiting for him at home, nor ambitious suitors vying for his throne. Instead, the young princess, ""Nausicaa,"" whom Odysseus meets on the isle of ""Phaeacia"" (6.127-), in this version of the story, is named ""Penelope"" and, in as strange an addition as I've ever seen, Odysseus must rescue her from a human sacrifice to the Sea-God Poseidon, thus mixing the story up with the myth of ""Perseus and Andromeda."" If that, however, weren't enough, the sea-monster, to which ""Andromeda"" would otherwise be offered, is now replaced by a ""Poseidon"" dwarf, which like Homer's ""Old Man of the Sea,"" whom Menelaus wrestles, shifts into the shape of many beasts (4.455-59). At the story's end, Odysseus sails off into the sunset with ""Nausicaa""/""Penelope,"" in effect countering everything normally connoted by the name of the ""Penelope"" (i.e. Shroud Weaver) (see Book 19). Those of us familiar with the story also remember the Cyclops in the cave asking, ""What's your name?"", to which Odysseus responds, ""My name is Nobody"" (9.366). This makes for a humorous scene, when after being blinded by Odysseus, the Cyclops cries out to the other Cyclopes, ""Nobody is killing me"" (9.408), thus incurring their derision. One could certainly understand altering the scene to make it more suitable to children, since this is, after all, a cartoon; for example, Odysseus could slam a rock on the Cyclops' foot, instead of poking out his eye. But strangely, although the movie does show the Cyclops' eye being gouged out, it leaves out the ""my name is Nobody"" humor all together, which of all the original work's most humorous parts would, likely, be the best appreciated by young viewers. From a completely objective standpoint, the cartoon wasn't all that bad to watch, yet calling it the ""Odyssey,"" instead of (let's say) ""Mythology Sloppy Joe,"" is a great misrepresentation and a greater insult to lovers of Homer's epic.",980208000,17,2112,5.01994301994302
