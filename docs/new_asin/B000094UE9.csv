7989706,1,B000094UE9,Dance party is by far the worst wiggles vidoe that we bought.  I paid the same price for this video as I did for one that was made in the past 3 years.  It was old looking and the production is laughable.  They are drivng a cardboard car!  If your kids watch them on TV or have seen another video they will not like this video.  I had to try to explain to my 2 year old son why they were driving a card board big red car.  Come on!  Pull a bad video.  It is embarassing to the Wiggles Name Brand.  Shame on them for selling such a bad video.  Redo it or pull it!,1134259200,2,562,3.7672413793103448
7989707,5,B000094UE9,"These are both excellent. If you are new to the Wiggles and are not sure where to begin, this would be a great place to start. Dance Party is much more 'primitive' from a production stand point (we see too much of Anthony's chest hair) but the songs are great and the kids are having lots of fun. Yummy Yummy is much more polished (lighting, makeup) and the songs are also first rate. Our son (17 months) lives and breathes these videos, but even after many many showings his parents still like them too and that's the best part. Another comment I read talked about the sound and picture quality on the Dance Party VHS tape; all I can say is that it is fine on the DVD.",1082246400,4,669,4.234375
7989708,4,B000094UE9,"My son is a huge Wiggles fan - so I got the two of these as a combo purchase.  Dance Party was made a while ago so he wasn't too intrested in it.  If I would of known that I wouldnt of purchased it, but Yummy Yummy is great.  The songs and videos are more up to date (as what you would see on Disney) and he knows the songs and dances.  So - overall it was a purchase well worth the money. As long as my son is happy so am I.  I would just caution parents on buying the older versions because children don't seem to 'know' the Wiggles or seem to be intrested.",1056758400,5,559,3.7844827586206895
