8330930,5,B001OMZYGS,this is a wonderful anima with some predictable aspects  but still awsome... the only prob i had was with how it ended it left me wondering what happened with the main person...,1255392000,,177,4.53125
8330931,4,B001OMZYGS,"This series had caught my eye since I saw the trailer for it.
It surpass the trailer at every turn with an interesting mix
of horror, action, and fantasy.

For me, this plot was a bit on the predictable side, but it
still had a good many surprises. And the ending, as most
anime shows do to me, leave me wishing for something more
conclusive.

The characters are engaging and realistic; each with their own
personal beliefs, strengths, and weaknesses. So even if you're
good at predicting plots like myself, this anime still has lots
to offer.

And on a side note, the music is a wonderful mix between the
hard rock and softer chants.",1249948800,2,634,4.495652173913044
8330932,5,B001OMZYGS,"This anime really is a great sleeper hit that totally caught me by suprise. With an excellent mixture of horror and teenagers with similar mutant like powers dropping plenty of action that you can't pass up!
The catch of the plot is several students gain powers by being in the wrong place at the wrong time and amongst them the one they see as the weakest will soon become their greatest threat.",1241222400,2,396,4.513888888888889
8330933,5,B001OMZYGS,Tokyo Majin is an awesome anime!!  But because this is an anime heavy with Japanese names and words the American dub sometimes didn't pronounce them correctly.. This sometimes bothered me a little but the American voice cast still did a good job!,1239667200,,246,4.857142857142857
