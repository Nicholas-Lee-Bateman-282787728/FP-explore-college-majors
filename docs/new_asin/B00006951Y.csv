7965136,3,B00006951Y,"I can't claim to be dyed-in-the-wool Red Wings fan, but every so often they do the world a service by knocking the Colorado Avalanche out of the playoffs, and any hockey fan has to acknowledge the brilliance of Scotty Bowman, the team's overall depth and the pure eternal class that is Steve Yzerman.
Having said that, I won this DVD on a bet with my dad over the outcome of the 2002 Western Conference Finals.  I was in the process of moving the night of Game 7 and had no idea of the score until I was able to check the internet via my cellphone.  When I saw 6-0 I couldn't believe it...eventually they tacked on the extra point and won 7-0.  My dad thought I was bull$h! tting him when I called him with the score, and my 'Lanche-supporting friends could only take solace that as bad as that defeat was, Saudi Arabia's 8-0 loss to Germany in the World Cup the next day was far worse.
Having said all that, the 2002 Stanley Cup Finals were an anticlimax as has been the case over the last several years.  One all-powerful team makes it, and a quality opponenet from the othe other conference simply isn't to be found.  As this DVD is designed to chronicle the highlights of the season, it would have been better if more attention and screentime was given to the Conference Finals (the series which truly decided the Stanley Cup; no hockey fan could doubt that).  I wouldn't have minded an extra feature on the 2002 Olympic ice hockey tournament either, as the Wings had so many players involved.  I guess that would have been stepping on the IOC's turf, though.
Anyway, it's a decent enough tribute to a truly amazing star-studded team...the interviews with the players, the preseason moves to put together a living Hall Of Fame team on ice, all of this is well-documented.  A team this talented may never be assembled (or bought) in this fashion again.  But the highlights just aren't as awe-inspiring as the team's actual accomplishment.  The NHL owes a team this good something more, don't they?",1086998400,6,2000,4.56145251396648
7965137,5,B00006951Y,"Being a huge Detroit Red Wings fan (and for good reason-they're the best ever!) This was an awesome video!  If you love hockey (or even if you don't) by the time you are through watching, you'll be a lifelong devoted fan of Stevie Y and the fabulous Stanley Cup Champion Detroit Red Wings!  GO WINGS!",1033603200,,300,4.4363636363636365
7965138,5,B00006951Y,"As a professional videographer who has done highlight tapes myself, I say this video comes through with an A+.  Similar in format to the 1998 Red Wings video, it is even more solid and includes better interviews and background information to supplement the actual action, and the background music is right on.  All the different play-by-play announcers (ESPN, CBC, WKBD, WXYT) take their turns in cameos, and appropriate tributes are paid to Stevie's courage, Scotty's mastery and the Red Wings teamwork-in-general.  I really had the feeling that I was watching one of the great teams of all times.",1028160000,3,598,5.081632653061225
