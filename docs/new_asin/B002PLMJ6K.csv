3964645,5,B002PLMJ6K,"Let me start off this review by saying that ""Dancing with the Stars: Dance off the Pounds"" is my favorite DVD in the ""Dancing with the Stars"" (DWTS) series of workout DVDs.  The styles of dance were fun, actual routines were taught as opposed to just unconnected moves in previous DVDs, and I actually worked up a huge sweat!  The choreography was a bit complex, but I really enjoyed the challenge.  Beginners to fitness and dance may be a bit frustrated at first, though.  There is no warm-up, therefore the viewer has to either do his own or just let the beginning of one of the workouts act as the warm-up.  The DVD was divided into the following four parts of the workout:

Swing - Led by Kym Johnson, it is the most basic of all the routines.  It's almost an intro to the Jive, which is a style taught later on in the DVD.  I found the moves to be rather easy to follow; although there is really no breakdown of the steps.  It includes moves such as triple steps, rock steps, kick-ball-changes, sailor steps, Charlestons, and many more.  It has quite a bit of hopping of kicking (at a rather slow speed, though), and it will really get the heart rate up.  Kym is very motivating and sweet to the viewer; I like her as an instructor.  This was my least favorite of all of the segments, but I still enjoyed it immensely.

Jive - Lacey Schwimmer leads this fast-paced routine.  All of the moves are incredibly fast, and I could easily see a dance novile becoming completely confused and annoyed.  Lacey teaches the moves very quickly and prefers going from the top a lot more than making sure you have the moves.  She breaks down the really fast, complex moves which is something Kym never did..  Moves included are more triple steps, kicks, Charlestons, heel bops, jump steps, and more.  Lacey is very chirpy, so she may possible get on your nerves if you don't like that kind of instructor.  This was my second favorite routine on the DVD.

Quickstep - This was the most challenging of all the routines, which may have been partially due to poor teaching by the instructor Dmitry Chaplin.  Don't get me wrong, I really like Dmitry; but he just didn't teach the moves well.  He seems to be better at showing rather than telling.  The moves taught were really fast and sometimes hard, but Dmitry broke most of them down really slowly.  The many break-downs did make my heart rate go down a bit, but I just do the quickstep segment first and let the beginning low cardio segment count as my warm-up.  There is lot of movement in this routine and a lot of jumping steps, as well.  Some of the moves included are the box step, pendulums, knee bops, shuffle hops, and many more.  The quicktep had the most challenging footwork by far but arguably the most fun.

Cool-Down - All of the instructors take turns leading the cooldown, which is comprised of many stretches.  Unfortunately, they don't stretch the calves, neck, glutes, or arms that well.  But it does excellently bring your heart rate down.

Overall, I thought it was much better than the previous DVDs&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dancing-With-the-Stars-Cardio-Dance/dp/B000MMMTC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dancing With the Stars - Cardio Dance</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dancing-with-the-Stars-Latin-Cardio-Dance/dp/B001BNFR80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dancing with the Stars: Latin Cardio Dance</a>&nbsp;which were both a bit too boring and slow.

I reocommend getting this DVD it if you are a fan of the show, or if you want a fantastically fun, old-school, cardio workout.

I returned the items (see review of DWTS Latin Cario also).

Wife: Where are my DWTS DVDs?
Me: I returned them
Wife: Oh.  I wanted them.  Why did you return them?
Me: Are you serious?

3964648,4,B002PLMJ6K,"Kym's Swing workout is my favorite. It's a great warmup before moving into Lacey's portion, and her choreography is easy to follow. Lacey's Jive is faster-paced and sometimes the microphone doesn't pick up her instructions so I missed steps until I had memorized the routine. Dmitri's Quickstep starts out nice and easy, but he seems to lose the beat often (the background music isn't the best in the Quickstep). Also, some of his choreography was really hard on my ankles, no matter what kind of shoes I wore. I've started skipping the Quickstep workout and my ankles feel much better!",1446076800,,586,4.87

3964652,2,B002PLMJ6K,"I enjoyed learning the dances with the instructional lessons, however I was disappointed when I switched to the ""music only"" option of the dances and instead of having music and all work out for 20-30 minutes,  it was merely the instructional lessons muted. Definitely lost my interest. Once I learned the steps I wanted to just dance, not slowly go thru all the instructional steps all over again. Huge disappointment.

3964661,4,B002PLMJ6K,"I'm a beginner.  This is my second Dancing with the Stars DVD.  The first purchase was the Latin Cardio.  With the Latin Cardio, it was frustrating at first because I was a total beginner, and I got confused all the time.  But when I played in slow motion, and concentrated on a small section at a time, I started to make progress.  The dances are not vigorous, but it's fun and a good workout for me.

For this DVD (Dance off the Pounds), I used the same strategy and started with the Quickstep.  At the third time, I was able to follow at regular speed.  This DVD is more vigorous than Latin Cardio.  It's also fun to me.

So for beginners like me, don't give up :)  I used to not exercise much.  I now dance along with DVD, and enjoy it several times a week.",1420070400,,761,4.136986301369863

I cheered in high school, so I do understand most of the steps they teach for their ""Aerobic"" dancing, so I do okay, but I do kind of feel stupid doing it, until the sweat starts pouring off! These exercises are best intended for a very large room. You are moving around a lot and any average living room will not be good enough. Also, is you have young children, like yoounger than 6, do not get this! My kids think it funny to try to go under my legs when I am kicking and shuffling and you will kick them... a lot! Then they cry and you have to turn off the show, then you lose your burn or you miss the next set of new steps....blah blah blah. It is meant for a group of friends in a large studio or by yourself in your LARGE living room.

I figured I could at least get the steps down because of my athletic ability, but it went beyond that.  If you're patient enough to keep rewinding and practice, you'll eventually get it and you'll be so stoked about moving on to the next move.  Trust me, without any dance experience at all, no musicality whatsoever, I was still able to get some use and FUN from this DVD (in the privacy of my own home...lol).

The first instructor (swing) was actually GOOD! she broke down the moves within the sequence and they felt accessible and she was motivating. The other 2 instructors who taught jive and quick step were well intentioned and great dancers but clearly were not teachers. I tried each of these sections for about 5 minutes and decided they were a colossal waste of time so I had to jump ship.
I give this DVD 2 stars because of the first instructor. Give this one a miss",1364342400,,619,4.486725663716814
3964695,4,B002PLMJ6K,"Overall - Of the DVD's I have purchased, this is by far my favorite. You do actual steps that easily build a sweat, and vary just enough to be fun. Prior dance experience is a must if you don't want to spend most of your time figuring out what the instructors are doing. Some terms/steps you should be familiar with are triple steps, pas de bourres, and ball changes. This is a dance DVD that gives you a workout, NOT a workout DVD with some dance moves thrown in.

Pros :
-For someone who actually has dance training, this is pretty great for an at home ""class."" I like the DVD's because weekly classes add up fast (one drop in session is more expensive than just buying this DVD).
-You can follow along with instruction or just with the music.
-Great cardio workout; lots of sweat!

Cons:
-No warm up
-The male instructor isn't very good. Seems like a nice guy, but for various reasons (poor directions, ambiguous instruction, can't count down to an 8-count) I spend a lot of time waiting for him to ""get going"" and therefore my heart rate slows down. A real bummer, since this comes right after the jive routine that is really fast paced.

Bottom Line: I would still buy it after having completed the DVD",1364342400,2,1207,4.427927927927928
3964696,1,B002PLMJ6K,"I have purchased many Dance DVD's and the Dancing with the Stars ones are some of the worst.  A professional dancer is supposed to get each step 4 times so you would assume that a non-professional dancer should get more repeats.  Some of the steps are done exactly 4 times if that, and then the dancer moves on to the next steps.  There is no flow to the steps either.  No matter how many times I do this video I don't seem to ""have fun"" or get my heart rate up and anything near what might be called a workout.  The chap in it is stiff and you can hardly understand what he says.  It's just not a fun DVD.  I have some of the Juliane Hough dance DVD's and she is able to do all the same dances that are used in the Dancing With The Stars DVD's in a form that gives an amazing workout and I do have fun because she only uses a few steps per dance.  You do them each about 20 times so by the end of the workout you feel like you really danced... all sweaty and tired.  These Dancing with the stars DVD's should break the dances into 15 or 20 minute sections where they teach a certain dance sequence and you really learn it.  That's all you do.  Then when you master that... you move on to the next. They could have dance sequences that have the dances in full without the tuition.  I don't know what the answer is but the current format just doesn't work.  Dancing With The Stars takes celebrities that can't dance and teaches them how.  Where is that in these videos.  They need to be aware of who their market is.  The people that buy these DVD's are going to be the ones that want to learn...like the TV stars.  What professional or semi-professional dancer is going to need a dance workout DVD.

Something else they could do is rate these.  Say, 1-5.  None of the DVD's in this series are a 1 or a 2.

Basically, I think every last one of them was a waste of my money and I will be boycotting anything that has a Dancing With The Stars logo as a result.",1363392000,4,1957,4.083989501312336

On the other hand, I am still trying to figure out what to do with Dmitri's section. I understand that the quickstep is a ""hold"" dance and therefore may be difficult to translate into solo dancing, but the other dances are also intended for couples and somehow do a better job of making them accessible for workout purposes. Still, I think that the steps show promise; he just needs to work on instruction and a better routine to incorporate the steps into.

As I said earlier, Kym and Lacey's routines are pure fun. Lacey's segment is aerobically more challenging that Kym's and keeps your heart rate higher and longer. Overall fun while working out, always a good thing.",1357084800,,847,4.602649006622516

The swing and jive were fairly easy to pick up.  The first time I did these routines I did not get as good a workout since I was still learning it but by the second time I tried the vid, I had it down enough for a workout.  You actually do get a decent cardio workout.  You don't notice the time going by because it is fun but the heart rate does get up there and you start to sweat over the course of each approx 15 minute routine.  Instructors, backup dancers, music, and moves were all good.

The quickstep is another story.  Perhaps this is a more difficult dance but the choreography was much more difficult to pick up.  I was still struggling to pick up the steps by the second time I tried the vid but had enough of it down that, at the end, when you do the whole routine 2 or 3 times in a row, I could keep my feet moving along even if it was the wrong foot or late sometimes.  If you did the entire routine enough times it would probably be the most intensive workout of the 3, but since most of the first half is done very slowly to teach you the moves and broken out into short segements, you probably will never really get the benefit of a stretch of cardio like the other two routines.  The instructor is likeable but terrible at cuing.  He randomly calls out the 5678 but not before you start the move like you would expect.  Or he calls nothing at all.

I used this as a second, add on to my other workouts and is more of a fun me-time thing than another exercise session to endure for the sake of my waistline.",1304726400,,1746,4.142433234421365

I needed something that I could classify as ""fun"" that still gave me a workout and this was it. I think you could do a lot worse.

Seeing this video and knowing others had lost weight by dancing I gave it a shot. The dances are fun. But the instructions are sorely lacking. I teach Tai Chi, mainly to seniors and children where we break down the steps slowly. This tape is taught more with a mind set that people already know dance and have been dancing.

How would someone know that when after kicking the front foot out, it should then go behind the next leg. Teach people how to ""feel"" the triple step. Take it one step at a time for them and build speed. What foot do you hop on? How is the ankle turned and will you move on the floor with that heal/toe, turn the waist move? How about a window showing you doing the dance from behind for those that have trouble with left and right orientation when being faced from the front, because people learn differently.

Finally, most of the cool downs are completely inappropriate for people that have just begun again to exercise. Advanced Yoga is NOT safe for everyone. I'm not old, but not young anymore either. My muscles are strong due to the Tai Chi I've done over the years. So I'll use the DVD for the first two dance routines because I wanted an exercise that raised my heart rate, but I'll do my own cool downs, not theirs.

To the creators of this video I ask ""You want to help people lose weight, but who are you making it for? Those bare-wasted beauties in the back-ground?"" Yet again another health video meant for thin people who already have a wide range of motion. Do another DVD, and break down the steps, show how each step is taken, how the ankle turns, shifting of the weight so people can learn SAFELY; Then allowing them to rejoin the dance routine after they have a firm grasp of the movement. People with confidence will continue using your DVDs.

I have tried it several times and it is still very difficult for me to understand what he is saying.  I love dance exercise videos and watch them over and over until I get it.  In fact the reason I exercise to dance videos is to ward off bordem with exercise. So when I don't get a routine right away, I practice it every day until I do.  I said that to say that I don't mind challenges.  But Demetrys segment is just plain boring. Sorry, just telling the truth.
I do Lacys routine twice through as a warmup for exercise most days. Its fun, challenging, and gets the heart rate up pretty fast.

They offer doing the dance with or without the instructions.  It would be neat if the without instruction version was more challenging and less learning the dance because once you've done it a few times the ""teaching"" part gets boring and isn't very challenging.  The video isn't as professional as it could be either.

Pros:  The dances might be fun, if you can figure out how to do them.

Cons: There is little in the way of instruction, and the *instructors* seem to assume you can catch on after one quick demonstration - which is generally badly explained and poorly filmed. I am sorry, but saying, ""Okay? Got it? Let's do it to tempo..."" each time a step is shown does not count as *teaching* a step...

A dancer may know the moves merely by name, but I doubt a dancer has need of a video like this.

The instructors seem to have a limited repertoire of comments - I quickly tired of hearing, ""Excellent... Excellent.  That's great!  Excellent!""

There is NO warm-up - which could result in injury to someone who does not understand the importance of limbering up your muscles before launching into a workout routine.

The cool down is limited and rather boring.  It felt tacked on and rather useless.

All in all, I much prefer my other dance workout vids over this one.

3964724,1,B002PLMJ6K,"Having recently purchased this DVD I was excited to try it out.  I have a strong power-lifting routine in place but I wanted some cardio to tone my midsection a bit.  I have seen other ""dance fitness"" programs on my cable's On Demand exercise channel and they all walk you through moves slowly and methodically so you can stay with the on-screen action.  With this DVD, I was unimpressed, to say the least, with the lack of instruction.  One of the dancers would spend a couple of seconds showing a move and then it's on to the next routine.  It wouldn't be so bad if the camera work showed off the footwork, but it didn't.  The dance stars use lingo like ""rock step"", ""triple step"" and ""step, ball, change"" that probably means a lot to a trained dancer but not to a non-dancer that decided to try a DVD on whim.  Again, had they illustrated the moves more slowly and visually this would be o.k.- why not show the moves individually on the ""Extras"" portion of the DVD like other ""dancercise"" series are known to do?

I tried to persevere through the frustration- but, alas, it just didn't work out.  After about seven viewings I knew I was still faking it, and although sweating a bit, I felt there were other videos out there that would be more efficient.  I've gone back to the On Demand options through my cable for dance cardio and Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred for even more intense cardio(combined with strength/ab training).

I am sure the well-known Dancing With the Stars franchise label helps to sell this DVD- I'm probably one of the suckers myself!  That being said, I've moved on to better options and I'll be more careful with my purchases.  Again, if you are serious about losing weight, check out Jillian Michaels stuff.

In the end this DVD fails as both dance instruction and exercise- and maybe because it's a middle ground hybrid that never really dedicates itself to either one in full force.",1280448000,6,1914,4.574780058651027
3964725,3,B002PLMJ6K,"OMG! Dimitri is so boring. He looked so awkward in front of the camera, I really hope that's not how he teaches the celebrities on DWTS.  And he went way too fast trying to teach the complicated quickstep.

Kym was so dull.  As if someone gave her an assignment and she only did enough to pass; you know she could have put more into and probably get the highest grade. But of course the answer would be why should she, all she have to do is pass and she can do that with minimal effort. I believe lackluster describes Kym.

I was so surprised at Dimitri and Kym.  Lacey's part was my favorite.  She was vibrant, fun and made me want to dance. She looked like she was having so much fun.  Even though it was 15 minutes, she put her all into it and made me feel excited enough to want to do it again and again. I think Lacey needs to have her own dvd.  I bought this dvd because I thought it could help in my exercise regiment, but boring teachers only make you tired and lackluster.  Lacey is the only reason I'm keeping this dvd.",1279324800,3,1029,4.130653266331659
3964726,5,B002PLMJ6K,"I tried another of the Dancing with the Stars workouts (Latin Cardio) and though I liked it, I felt like it wasn't as challenging or as fast paced as I would like and that I would tire of the dvd too soon.  When I saw that this one was available I thought I'd give another try since it is geared more toward intermediate/advanced fitness.  I wasn't disappointed.  It is very fast paced, and I had my pedometer on when I was doing the routine.  We are talking 5,000+ cardio steps in approximately 45 minutes.  Now that's my kind of cardio.  A fun dance workout that doesn't feel like exercise, that makes me pour sweat.  Loved it!

I felt that the dances increased in difficulty and pace as you progressed, with Quickstep being the most difficult for me.  I haven't gotten all the steps perfected yet but I look forward to being able to really polish up my technique as I practice a bit more.

Word of caution: This is not a good dvd if you are a beginner to dance (too fast paced, maybe try another DWTS video, or some of Lisa Nunziella's dance videos, that have excellent sections that really slow the moves down). If you feel you aren't in good shape, this might be too challenging to begin with as it is quick paced and you will get a pretty intense cardio workout. (I work out 7 days a week and have danced since age 9 and I was pouring sweat doing this workout).  If you feel like you have two left feet, also not for you.  You will end up being frustrated, and that is no fun at all.  Start with a beginner workout and then progress up once you feel comfortable with increasing the pace and the choreography. Dance should be fun, so do this when you progress to a more challenging workout.

This workout is for you if you have a dance background, are used to fast choreography, are willing to practice a bit before you ""get it"" or for someone that wants to try something new and is in fairly good shape.

This dvd has no warm up, so I suggest you do your own.
The first dance, the swing, is taught by Kym. She's NOT very good at instructing in this dvd. She starts off with a triple step, which to me is soooo confusing, because what, you jump twice on one foot, once on the other, or is it three times or twice on both?? She doesn't explain, she just jumps right into it. Also, the dance itself was NOT very fun. It wasn't a lively dance and some of the moves were just weird to do.
The second dance by Lacey is the Jive. This dance was MUCH better. She explains a few steps very clearly and does them slowly a couple of times so you get the hang of it. It will really make you sweat, I mean like it will KILL your legs.
The third dance is the quickstep taught by Dmitry. Excellent instructor, he did everything SLOW so you could really understand it. He would stop, explain, show. Stop, explain, show. This may be a bit hard for those who wish to keep their heart rate going, but it does wonders to get the moves right. Here's the catch: Once he starts, he DOES NOT STOP. This quickstep at the beginning seems like it's the easiest but once he gets going, it becomes the hardest of the two. The good thing is that once you get the steps you can keep doing them while he stops, so you keep your heart rate up. Definitely the best teacher of the three and the hardest dance.
Then it has a nice cool-down section.

Overall, worth the money for the last two dances, but this is NOT for beginners. I suggest buying an easier dance dvd and starting off with that, and once you have a good idea, move on to this, because learning the steps is SUPER hard.",1272499200,4,1900,4.135135135135135

The instructors only show the steps once or twice before moving on to the next set of steps in the routine. The Swing and Quickstep routines are a bit easier to follow but, if you don't know what you're doing, the Jive routine is practically impossible.

Bad points: Unless you're someone who really knows how to dance or follow dance steps instantly, you will probably feel discouraged and frustrated like I did.  Their feet move really fast when demonstrating the dance moves for the first time, and only demonstrate it two or three times quickly before moving to the next move.  There are almost no slow demonstrations of the footwork, so for most of the dvd I was just flailing and kicking around the living room, attempting to copy them somehow.  This wasn't helped by them wearing black pants in some or most of the dances, making it hard to tell whether their leg is moving in front or behind their other leg.

Summary:  If you are really good at dancing, can learn complicated dance moves by watching 10 seconds of full-speed demonstrations, or enjoy flailing around trying to dance as your workout, you'll probably enjoy this DVD.",1262476800,27,1011,4.715909090909091
3964742,3,B002PLMJ6K,I just started doing this video.  I am trying to get in shape and have fun.  I love the show and I'd love to learn some of the dances.  This video is really tough for someone out of shape and in their 30's.  The instructors go a bit too fast on the workouts and it's really hard to catch on if you're out of shape like I am.  I would be more interested in seeing a cardio video more like how the professionals teach their out of shape stars the different dances.  This is probably a great video for people who are in shape or have dancing experience.  I found it really tough and I'm still trying to get through one dance.  But I am very out of shape.,1262044800,3,651,3.992248062015504
3964743,5,B002PLMJ6K,"This DVD is a VAST improvement over the previous DWTS DVDs. First off there are less sections, but the segements are longer, which I like more since I think choppy short segments don't give you an adequate workout.

Lots of cardio in this DVD, and while it is a whole lot of fun, it is very challenging. I was soaked after doing the workout. To give you an idea of my background, I am an intermediate level in fitness DVDs and I have been dancing since the age of 4.

I decided to do this DVD from start to finish so I could see the quality of the workouts and time it as well.

The first section is Swing with Kym. This is great, alot of what you may have seen in the Jive sections if you got the first DWTS DVD, but it is still a very good workout. Kym not only does swing, she also adds in some Charleston, which was a nice change since I've never done that. You may be a little lost if you don't have any background in dance, but Kym does do her best to explain moves like pas de bouree  the best she can in the few seconds she has before jumping in. Definitely gets your heart rate up with kicks. This was just the first section and I was tired after it--and I still had two more sections to go!

Next up was Lacey with Jive. Whoooo!! This moves fast and is similar to the swing section, but the moves are smaller and more precise, so it is more difficult since you have to keep your moves compact. This one was a real burner AND the steps while a lot of fun, again are hard to get down on the first try if you don't have a dance background. And it goes REALLY fast. I even had a hard time keeping up and just had to triple on the spot a few times. She also throws in some little X jumps and squats which were unexpected but complemented the moves quite well and were REALLY intense layered with all the moves in the routine. I thought this was the hardest section until I got to.....

Quitckstep with Dmitry. This dance I am totally unfamiliar with, as is most people, so it starts off a little slower in the breakdown of moves. But don't let this fool you, this section must be a HUGE calorie burner because there are a lot of jumps and hops, and the pace speeds up as you go along. Dmitry was great and is absolutely adorable! He is a good teacher for the amount of time you get, and does his best to break down these moves that go so fast and look so easy, but take so much effort. He also throws some jump squats in at the end of the routine, which I enjoyed and felt the next day!

Then there is a short cooldown with all 3 instructors, about 8-10 minutes if that. The cooldown is adequate and by that time I was so tired, I just didn't care and any stretches felt good.

This is an excellent video and is sure to burn major calories and fat. Here I am the next day and my butt and legs are sore--almost like when I go for a run! It is that good. And it has to be great cardio. I am so glad since I hate doing cardio, this is fun and something I will actually look forward to doing!

A couple of cautions: 1) There is no warm up here (which is odd since it is such an intense workout) so if you need a warmup do some light strecthing or aerobics.
2)These are fast dances, so you will lose time frequently in your first few workouts. I know I did. So that kind of messes up the routine as you go along. But please don't get discouraged. Just triple step or march in time until the routine starts and try again.

All in all,excellent cardio DVD if you are looking for something different and love to dance. I also purchased the DWTS Dance Body Tone and will try it later this week! I will post a review of that as well, but I think ""Dance Off the Pounds"" is top-notch!",1260748800,39,3677,4.038461538461538
3964744,5,B002PLMJ6K,"I love this video, it is so much better than previous DWTS workout videos. It is up tempo, and you definitely work up a sweat. Fantastic!",1260403200,5,137,4.3076923076923075
3964745,5,B002PLMJ6K,"I'm a DVD dance-workout junkie. I buy *everything* dance-dvd, almost. This is the best of the four Dancing with the Stars workouts. It's not modern dance - it's super-cute jive, swing and funky-quickstep. It's a great workout.

The first segment is adorable and sweet learning the American dance 'the swing' (triple-step, rock-step, the sailor, etc.). Great intro to what's to come on the dvd. It's not slow either.

The second instructor and routine really shines, is a crazy-fun good time; the pace increases as you are taught the taught the international version of 'swing' which is called 'jive' (faster triple-steps, kicks, heel-bops, Big-X step, swivels, the charleston, the Lindy,etc.) High-impact and difficult cardio which can be modified by not doing arms.

The last segment is a suave, dressed-in-black quick-step routine that is explained well and, tho different, has the same great dance-flow as the first two parts. Make sure you watch it to the end it just is a sophisticated blast! Great job of teaching old dances with a totally-modern feel! Gene Kelly would approve.

I go back to this DVD as a ""serious"" fat-burning workout because it's a smiling good time that really makes you sweat and laugh. It's pure dance-cardio with, again, great flow. You ARE dancing, not aerobics pretending to be dance. Beautiful choreography that works. It's fun, not lame, slow, or dull, if you know what I mean. Just good times, dancin' hard like it's 1920-1945. And, whoa, did they move it back then. The dvd includes the option doing the workouts with music and instruction or just music so you can cut out the chattering once you're proficent and just dance. Love it. Super-fun. Good for beginners and established dancers alike, this is a serious workout worth the $$.

(A similar buy is the spectacular ""Dance with Julianne: Cardio Ballroom""  (purchased after this dvd review) which is also fantastically-fun cha-cha, jive, etc,-- another dancer from the Dancing with the Stars franchise.)",1260057600,60,1993,5.098159509202454

8377077,2,B002PLMJ6K,This was a lot harder to do than I thought it would be. I don't have any hard floors that are big enough to do this video.....only carpet. They move through the steps quickly and if you don't pick up on them you will be lost the rest of the time. It's a building up of moves. I found some of them difficult to do in tennis shoes too. This is an ideal video only if you have a large space with hard floors....and maybe some dance shoes! It was not what i expected it would be.,1487376000,,475,3.9072164948453607
8377078,4,B002PLMJ6K,"A really good video. The dancers usually explain the moves well, and the routines are fun and challenging. I love to swing dance, so these dances really appeal to me. A few steps were difficult to follow at first (the susie-q for example. I had to watch a few videos on youtube before I understood what she was doing). I love how you can mute the voices and just have the music playing once you get the hang of the dance. I will definitely keep this video as one of my favorites and try more by the Dancing with the Stars crew.",1470009600,,527,4.176470588235294
8377079,3,B002PLMJ6K,Very weird DVD.  Had trouble getting it to bring up dance routines at first.  But I love the professional dancers and I can learn some new steps and lose weight at the same time.  And that's what it's all about for me.,1462579200,2,218,4.142857142857143

8377081,4,B002PLMJ6K,"I loved the idea of this workout DVD. I enjoy listening to music and dancing with my toddlers at work; therefore, I thought it would be a fun way to get into shape. I purchased this DVD in January of 2015, and I tried it immediately. I was very excited to start using this DVD, but I am a beginner with no rhythm; therefore, I struggled to keep up with the Quick-step routine. I think with more practice I eventually could have learned the techniques successfully, but I was overwhelmed and frustrated. I do still own the DVD, and I may try again this year. It looks like a lot of fun....once you learn the routine!",1452816000,,615,4.310344827586207
