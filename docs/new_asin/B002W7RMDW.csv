8382903,4,B002W7RMDW,"This DVD is the best form of exercise you can get if you are in a wheelchair and need to lose weight.  It was slow at first but I've lost 14lbs so far this year.  My only complaint is the quality of the DVD, not a very good copy and it keeps stopping while it is playing no matter how much I clean it.",1347408000,,301,3.6875
8382904,5,B002W7RMDW,"This dvd provides a serious workout for someone who can't do a lot of exercising on her feet.  It runs 50 minutes, including about 5 minutes of warm-up and a few for cooling down and relaxing.  It's watchable, too, as the instructor is in a lovely garden setting with a pond, and his three cats make brief appearances.  It's altogether an outstanding workout for someone with physical limitations.",1320624000,2,397,4.8088235294117645
