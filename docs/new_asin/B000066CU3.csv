7962370,1,B000066CU3,Was unable to play in DVD player! Apparently the software is not compatible with Canadian DVD players. Should not sell to Canadians if DVDs don't work in out machines.,1403654400,,167,4.793103448275862
7962371,5,B000066CU3,"I absolutely love this movie.  I bought the book recently and I can not wait to get started on it.  The movie is raw, not all those special affects that everyone falls for today.  It is an honest story being told.  I really like it, love it in fact.  If you had rough times as a teen, if you lost a friend or if love did not turn out the way your fantasy is in your head, then buy this.  It is NOT in region 1 though so make sure you have a region free DVD player.  I got the DVD player just so I could see this movie again and again.  I happened to catch it once on TV and I just could not wanting to own it.  I love the main character and the actress who played her.  She is so scared on the inside, but she is too proud and tough to ever show it on the outside.",1371600000,,764,3.68944099378882
7962372,4,B000066CU3,"They used to show this movie all the time on WE-Women's Entertainment network.  It's an amazing film:  the story is really powerful, and I wish I had thought to record it when it was on TV, because it never came out in the U.S., so no one ever made a DVD that will play on a region 1 player.  But if you see it on TV, watch it.  You can buy the book it's based on in paperpack or Kindle formats.",1261008000,,395,3.8395061728395063
7962373,5,B000066CU3,"Watched this tonight while ironing (what an exciting life, huh!). Although, by the virtue of the nature of the medium, the film does not reach as deeply as the book, it is an excellent film, portraying the original intention of the novel, as far as I understand it, very closely.
At times funny, at times touching and recognisable. The character of AustrItalian culture, with all its idiosyncrases, is explored with taste.
Fab film.",1222473600,,432,4.931506849315069
7962374,5,B000066CU3,"This movie, a blockbuster in Australia, is about an Italian girl who lives with her Mom in Australia.  Her father has been mostly absent from her life but she tracks him down to get to know him.  She deals with her daddy issues, adolescence, school exams, and the death of a close friend, as well as the challenges of being in two cultures at once, in a realistic way.  Any teenage girl will relate to Josephine's confusion and anger.  My daughter saw the movie and immediately read the book (about a dozen times); we'd recommend both to everyone, but especially adolescent girls (of any culture).",1213833600,4,597,4.6571428571428575
