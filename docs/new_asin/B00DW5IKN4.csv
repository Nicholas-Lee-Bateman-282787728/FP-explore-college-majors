5860155,4,B00DW5IKN4,"This was a great series... until it ended.  There is no resolution to the crime (the criminal is not caught.)  If I had known that going in, I would have waited until series 2 was out (May2014, I think,) because I am liable to have forgotten most of the plot by then.  Anyway, If you don't mind that, its a great show.  If you like Forbrydelsen, the dragon tattoo trilogy, Broadchurch and the like, you'll enjoy this.  As of this writing, the price is just under thirty dollars.  That's a bit much for only five episodes.  I watched on Netflix.",1377820800,8,544,4.38
5860156,5,B00DW5IKN4,"we all best know Anderson from her role as agent scully in the x-files. here she plays the antithesis of scully.  she is a senior inspector called into Ireland to solve a serial murder case. she is high handed, off putting, not interested in men except as one night stands--she could be a male senior policeman in short.  although there is no shortage of serial killer stories on tv, this one is quite compelling.  we follow the killer as minutely as we follow Anderson. this must be intended as a series as you are ready for follow up on the story in more episodes at its end.

if you are wondering about where her red hair went, Anderson dyed her hair red to play scully.  she was a blonde before taking the role.  at conclusion of the scully role, she went back to being a blonde.

this series is also currently available on netflix streaming.

5860157,5,B00DW5IKN4,"The rise of tension as the focus passes between the hunter, the detective, and the hunted, the serial killer, who is yet himself a hunter of victims of a certain type.  This drama is sophisticated, beautifully acted, with outstanding artistry by Gillian Anderson, who is superb, and tough-minded, succeeding in avoiding most sentimentality.  I am one who cannot wait to meet these characters again.  I do hope that the next installment will be more conclusive.",1376611200,3,460,5.1066666666666665

The acting is superb. I found myself hoping the killer would be caught and then hoping he would get away in the same episode. ive never written a review for a movie or series before but really wanted to encourage folks to watch this!",1376092800,5,409,4.466666666666667
5860159,5,B00DW5IKN4,"I stumbled across this on Netflix (are we allowed to say that here?) and knowing nothing about it,  casually downloaded the first episode.
Because I knew nothing,  I was surprise to me to see Gillian Anderson,  looking absolutely gorgeous.  I liked how it took it's time to tell the story,  how little details were preserved.  This could have been rushed into a 2 hour film,  but giving it 5 hours to tell the tale allowed for quiet moments,  for an expansion of detail.  I loved almost everything about it,  how complex Stella Gibson (Anderson) was,  how hard to read her character;  all the cops and their foibles; the density of the politics,  regular office politics but overshadowed by the Irishness of it all.  I loved the depiction of the serial killer,  how you sat through his work with him,  the domestic moments and then the obsessive killing moments.

Spoilers ahead -

I was not expecting the ending I got,  but I found it curiously satisfying nonetheless.  I'm thrilled that another season has been commissioned,  but I liked all the dangling threads.  Nothing is tidily packaged here, not the beginning, middle or the end,  and the show is richer for it.  Wish all television was this good.",1375401600,3,1205,4.737864077669903
5860160,5,B00DW5IKN4,"Crime is quite popular when it comes to television.  The crime procedural has been a television staple for many years; I mean, just look at any drama on CBS' primetime lineup.  The serial killer subgenre of crime television has become particularly popular in recent years.  Spurred by the success of shows like Dexter, many networks have attempted to create their own serial killer series with mixed results like FOX's The Following, A&E's Bates Motel, and NBC's Hannibal.  Enter BBC Two with The Fall, a five-part serial killer drama with a slow, methodical, and deliberate pace that is absolutely terrifying.

British television has seen a surge of popularity in recent years with hits like Doctor Who, Downton Abbey, and Sherlock crossing the Atlantic to find popularity here in the States.  Personally, I've now seen three British crime shows (Sherlock, Luther, and The Fall), and all three are quite good in their own way.  Starring Gillian Anderson (Agent Scully of The X-Files fame), The Fall revolves around a serial killer terrorizing Belfast by murdering young professional women in their homes.  Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson (Anderson) is brought in to investigate the murders.

The plot of The Fall is incredibly straightforward; the police are out to catch a serial killer.  On its own, that doesn't sound very interesting.  What makes The Fall interesting is the time it takes allowing the audience to get to know the serial killer.  We know that Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan) is the killer; there's no mystery for us.  But the series spend an equal amount of time going back and forth between Gibson's hunt to catch the killer and Paul's everyday life as a husband, father, and grief counselor.  It feels reminiscent of The Wire, where the audience spent equal time with the drug lords and street dealers and the police who were working to arrest them.

There are supporting characters who work to a varying extent; Bronagh Waugh fares best as Paul's wife Sally-Ann.  Her illusions about her husband are shattered as she begins to discover some of the truth about him.  But the series is truly anchored by Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan.  Anderson has proven herself to be a capable actress over the years, and she continues that here.  Her steely and icy demeanor occasionally betray a vulnerability, a serious desire not just to catch the killer but to provide justice for his victims.

Yet Dornan is the real find.  His performance is both chilling and unsettling.  His interactions with his family seem genuine and touching, but his precision and his manipulation are truly frightening.  Indeed, the fact that the series takes so much time to examine Paul and his life forces the audience to examine and grapple with the similarities that exist between him and Stella.  It forces us to look in the eye of a serial killer and see ourselves in the reflection.  It's a terrifying proposition, but Dornan is truly fantastic.  Of course, he's aided by Allan Cubitt's wonderful script.  The writing truly delves into the mind of Paul, and the results are simply extraordinary.

But the script excels with the plot as well as the characters.  Like I said, The Fall is pretty straightforward in its story.  But that means there are not plot holes, no convoluted side stories that don't make sense, no contrivances simply to move the story forward.  There are some side plots that don't feel quite as essential as the main plot, but they work well in providing context and depth to the characters.  The Fall moves forward with a singular mind and purpose, unfolding at its own pace and in its own time.  It's not a very fast-paced show, so don't expect a lot of action or excitement.

The show is deliberate, precise, and methodical, rather like Spector's method of killing.  Make no mistake; The Fall may not be action-packed, but it's incredibly tense, designed almost like a Hitchcockian-style thriller.  Jakob Verbruggen's direction is incredibly self-assured and it greatly heightens the intensity of the entire series.  Indeed, the opening five minutes is a silent sequence of Spector stalking his next victim.  Not a single thing is said and not a single music cue is used to heighten the tension, but trust me, there's no need to heighten the tension.

I will say up front that you should not expect a great deal of resolution from the ending of the first season of The Fall.  The series has already been renewed for another season which will air in 2014, and the ending of this season sets up a fascinating conflict and relationship for the next season.  So while there might not be a lot of resolution right now, that in no way inhibits the overall experience of this fantastic season of television.

Yes, there are a lot of serial killer dramas out there on television right now, and there are even more crime dramas on the airwaves.  But The Fall is not to be missed.  A fantastic import from the BBC, The Fall's precise, deliberate, and methodical pace and story is truly mesmerizing.  It's not necessarily a show that will be enjoyed by the masses, but for those looking for a serious entry into the crime, serial killer, or psychological thriller genres, you won't go wrong with The Fall.  Anchored by terrific performances from Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan, The Fall is one of the best shows out there right now.",1375228800,100,5354,4.872787610619469
5860191,5,B00DW5IKN4,"Excellent crime drama. Anderson is an incredible actor and displays her versality in this series taking on the hard nosed strong woman lead Stella, Stella is a flawed and very human women who wrestles her own demons while giving her all to bring justice to flawed evil people. Gillian's role is a departure from her Scully role on X-Files. We don't know if we she be repulsed, sorry or root for on Stella.

I was drawn into the series from the start. My only complaint is that I wish the story of the main villain had not taken 3 seasons to reach conclusion, I think maybe it would have been better had each season brought in a new main villain.

The writing was superb as were the production. One of the best series I've seen,",1517356800,,727,4.377777777777778

5860193,3,B00DW5IKN4,I don't know why they use Gillian Anderson.  Her face is frozen in the prune expression.  Its kind of interesting but the sex could definitelly be left out.

5860263,5,B00DW5IKN4,"This program defies easy categorization.  Yes, it is a police procedural.  But it is also a psychological thriller.  It shows us men through the eyes of women--and women through the eyes of men.  Perhaps the most thought-provoking aspect of ""The Fall"" is the phenomenon Gillian Anderson's character calls ""doubling"".  The killer, both insightful and compassionate in his professional role as therapist to the bereaved, somehow morphs periodically into a psychopathic killer, reminding us of the truth that not only patients, but their therapists, are ""self selecting.""  Perversely, I found myself rooting for the killer to evade detection, if only for the pleasure of watching him to continue to juggle the balls of his double lives.  Moreover, all the characters, including Anderson's Inspector Gibson, are flawed in ways that remain opaque and not easily explained, much less explained away, something I found both dramatically and morally intriguing.

I would recommend ""The Fall"" for the thoughtful connoisseur of crime drama, not binge worthy, but worthy of reflection.",1489363200,4,1074,5.466666666666667
5860264,2,B00DW5IKN4,"""The Fall"" is a British-Irish serial killer drama made for television in 2013, consisting of five 60-minute episodes. It's not a mystery; we know who the killer is. The show follows an investigation led by Det. Supt. Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson) into the meticulous murders of several professional women in their early 30s in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Gibson is summoned from The Met in London by her former colleague ACC Jim Burns (John Lynch) to assist with and review the investigation into the murder of Alice Monroe, an architect who was strangled and laid out suggestively in her home. In the course of her investigation, another similar murder of lawyer Sarah Kay (Laura Donnelly) occurs, and Gibson connects the earlier murder of Fiona Gallagher to the same killer. The audience watches as the killer, Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan), grief counselor and family man by day, plots his next crime and maneuvers to hide his activities from his wife Sally Ann (Bronagh Waugh).

The show's writer Allan Cubitt has stated that eliminating the mystery of who committed the crimes allows the series to focus on the motives and psychology of the killer, but we have no idea why Paul Spector is killing and displaying these women. Spector is not interesting, we don't understand him, but Jamie Dornan manages to do some interesting things in a few scenes. He's the only good thing in the series. Stella Gibson is a detached, well-dressed, egomaniac. She has in common with the killer a warped worldview and unshakable belief that her transgressive behavior is righteous, while society's norms are misguided. In the end, she is criminally irresponsible, but she's not interesting either. In order to stretch the story to 5 hours, there are a huge number of scenes that serve no narrative purpose, and there is a confusing subplot involving the husband of one of the victims, Aaron Monroe (Eugene O'Hare), and his father Morgan (Ian McElhinney) in police corruption.

""The Fall"" is heavy-handed with its politics, which are unfortunately misandristic. It expresses the view, both through its characters' words and in their behavior, that men are violent predators from whom no woman is safe. It implies that all men are such in their minds, even if not in their deeds. This is while Stella Gibson uses her sexuality with impunity to get what she wants, and the filmmakers entice viewers into a fascination with the details of the killer's exploits, his intimacy with his victims, the beautiful poses he leaves them in, how he strangles them. It's quite an exercise in hypocrisy. I don't think it's a coincidence that Jamie Dornan was cast as ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" billionaire BDSM heartthrob several months after ""The Fall"" aired. Ironically, his role as a sexual serial killer convinced someone that he had the screen presence and sex appeal to play the kinky, domineering fantasy that is Christian Grey. I wonder how that sits with Allan Cubitt & Co.

The DVD (Acorn Media 2013): There is a ""Behind the Scenes"" (11 min) featurette in which writer Allan Cubitt, director Jakob Verbruggen, and actors Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan talk about casting, characters, and production. English subtitles are available for the film.",1488412800,2,3226,5.037453183520599

5860280,4,B00DW5IKN4,"Having now watched all three available series, I think the show was one of the best crime dramas in a long time, maybe since The Wire. Good character development and acting, excellent plot. The pace was good in the first two series, but a little slow in the final series. I was only bothered by a couple of things. First, the cinematography was awfully dark. Most of the show takes place at night; does nobody own a light in Belfast? Can't imagine cops walking into dark buildings without good lights. At least TRY the switches to see if the power is on when you walk into a dark building or room. Just to see what was happening I had to sit in a completely dark room and turn the brightness full blast on my TV control. A bit like watching Batman in that regard. Second, I couldn't believe all the times the police and other authorities escorted the suspect here and there without cuffs or other restraints. This is a exceedingly strong and ruthless person and they just walk him around without restraints and sit in rooms with him. The magnitude of their folly becomes clear in the third series.
All in all, very well done and engaging.",1483401600,,1138,4.475961538461538

5860328,4,B00DW5IKN4,"Gillian Anderson was VANILLA... we thought there was a casting error here and/or the director was out to lunch; she had no scope and her voice really irked us. The other performances were excellent and the story, very interesting.  Jamie Dornan was brilliant!  Clearly, the drunken high level dude had been in the group home and was abused as well; they should have done more with that.  His character was interesting and should been have been more developed.  Also, Wallander, the psychiatrist was excellent and the psychology of abuse and treatment highly authentic.  The daughter of the killer gave an amazing performance, young as she is/was.  The Mother/wife of the killer also gave an outstanding performance.  All-in-all, we really liked it and I watched the 3rd episode twice.",1478908800,,784,5.078125

5860342,2,B00DW5IKN4,"Despite the fact that the show is well produced and acted, the underlying story seems contrived. It depends on an endless procedural narrative that will end (i.e., the culprit will be caught or killed) only once the series has been cancelled and must end. In the meantime, writers must come up with twists and turns to keep the whole enterprise afloat. I will admit, however, that it does test one's attention span and patience.",1478390400,,428,4.797297297297297

5860346,5,B00DW5IKN4,"Fans of Gillian Anderson will be rewarded with the first series of 'The Fall'. In the first series we are treated to the murders of women by a serial killer. The killings were brutal and terrifying, and we were privy to the murderer, Paul Spector. This is a who dunnit backwards. We know the murderer, we know how he acts, but we do not know too much about him.

Anderson plays DCI Stella Gibson, on loan to Belfast from London. She is an ice queen, beautiful and beds any man she wants. Much like the men she works with, she decides who her partner will be and when.  The murders continue, and Stella has a plan. Her team is smart, but she is the leader, and Stella goes inside the mind of the serial killer. Paul Spector is played by Jamie Dornan. He is a charmer, good looking, married with two children. The love of his life is his daughter, and she is a daddy's girl.

As the series proceeds we get to know Stella on a more emotional, personal level. We also get inside the mind of Paul, or he allows us in. This is a fascinating experience, this is a man whose intelligence is matched by his good looks and his killing ways. We also meet one other woman and her family. She survived Paul's attack, and after the trauma trying to remember the incident. This is a tension filled series that gets better each episode. DCI Stella Gibson is a woman not to be deterred by anything, sure of herself, but with issues as we all have. A strong woman in a man's world and she can beat them all.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 10-30-16",1477785600,,1527,4.310104529616725

5860367,5,B00DW5IKN4,"Brilliant.  Cerebral.  The best series of its kind since ""Prime Suspect.""  Gillian Anderson is a 21st Century Helen Mirren.  ""Stella Gibson"" is frank, bold, unafraid, passionate, pushes the envelope and the boundaries.  British women have and exhibit a bold sexuality that never translated across the Atlantic to the American ethic.",1473033600,,332,5.56

Of course, this is a problem with the script and writing. The killer just keeps on racking up victims, while the cops fumble away with multiple pieces of evidence that are never linked or pursued.

5860370,4,B00DW5IKN4,"This is a tense and disturbing series about a Detective Superintendent, Stella Gibson, who works for the Met and is called to Belfast, Ireland to investigate a murder of a young, professional woman. Early on Stella believes it may be the work of a serial murderer and is soon proven right.

Simultaneously, we meet the villain, who lives a double life and seems an unlikely candidate to perpetrate these murders. So, it's a bit cat and mouse as Stella begins to identify just what kind of individual is doing these crimes and why, drawing nearer to the killer.

The acting is subdued and deep. There's a menacing atmosphere pervading. For my own taste, I prefer less violent and graphic crimes. However, the series was so well-done and the acting riveting by Gillian Anderson as Stella that I couldn't not watch. The plot and denouement is original and I will sample the next installment in the series. 5 stars if you are okay with the violence and some nudity. I like cerebral mysteries with less violence, but with the same quality of acting and originality of plot. Enjoyed the Belfast backdrop.",1471824000,,1098,4.773684210526316

newly arrived from London, visits a crime scene,
where she notices handsome young Sergeant James Olson.
Without waiting for an introduction, she hands Sergeant Olson her hotel room key,
and orders him to report for duty that night.
Five Stars for enthusiastic scenes of
1) ""Rogering""
2) ""Shagging""
3) ""Boinking""
4) ""Hiding the Sausage""
5) ""Taking Old One-Eye to the Optometrist""
----- British euphemisms for Sexual Intercourse (from from the Online Slang Dictionary)

No consequences for Superintendent Gibson.
Grave consequences for Sergeant Olson.
I used to think I was fairly liberal about such things, but just realized that I am a prude.
Thanks a lot.
I used to think that the lower ranks of the British Police were off-limits to Inspectors, Chief Constables and Superintendents.
I guess I'm behind the times.

Actually, this is not new.
In my thirty years of experience with the British Police (a lot of TV watching),
this sort of thing never turns out well.
In Series Two, Episode One of ""Prime Suspect"" (1992)
Detective Chief Inspector Jane Tennison seduces Sergeant Bob Oswald.
By the end of the series,
DCI Tennison is fast-tracked for promotion to Superintendent.
Sergeant Oswald is out of a job (he's still better off than Sergeant Olson).

I found one example of a Male Police Inspector ""rogering"" a lower-ranking female colleague:
Season Three of ""DCI Banks"" ends in a hot embrace between Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks and Sergeant Annie Cabbot.
Looking forward to what happens in Season Four.

[Update: Nothing happened in Season Four. They broke up in the off-season, and Inspector Banks spends Season Four mooning over his lost love.]

Gillian was also very good in her detective work, as well.
I was also fascinated in the fact that this is shot on location in Ireland. Another guilty pleasure of mine.
I loved this series so much, that when season 2 became available, I bought that one, as well.

What an incredible actor. Whatever it is about Irish actors that make them so intense, incredible and irresistible, I want more. (think Colin Farrell) Not knowing exactly what was in store, I watched the complimentary S1, Episode 1 included as an Amazon Prime member. I was *INSTANTLY* hooked. There are so many reviews on here I see no need to expound in detail about the series. Just wanted to add my vote of approval and encouragement. If you are looking to fill a 'show hole,' by all means, $7.99 for the series is mere pence.  You can't even go see a movie at the theater for that. If you define Jaime Dornan as 'Christian Grey' you will be blown away by what you see here, which precipitated '50 Shades.' I can see now why he got the part of Christian Grey.  His talent is his ability to convey an easy, mysterious charm with darkness behind his eyes making you wonder what he is hiding. The show is perfectly balanced between the two characters of the lead detective, Stella Gibson, and the killer, Paul Spector.

*****POSSIBLE SPOILER********
I had only one issue with the script (episode 4) where he is forced to lie to his wife and say he has been having an affair with a 15-yr-old girl. To me, that is where the writer took a desperate dive off a literary cliff. He must have been pushing a deadline or something because it is so outlandishly out of character for the Spector we are learning about. And, imo, a MAJOR flaw. Major. Yes, we're talking about a creepy, misogynistic serial killer. But as the cliche goes, 'there is a code among thieves.' And so it is for this the socio-psychopath Spector.  The writer spends a lot of time defining Spector's character (pleasantly). He depicts his M.O., codes, patterns, and standards which the killer imposes on himself. A main one is that he is *very* protective of children (hinting at his own abusive childhood). He even writes a letter to the father of one of his victims saying 'he never would have killed her had he known she was pregnant.' So now he's going to go against his own 'code' and violate a child?  Eeeeeww... Not to mention the whole pedophile thing. It creates more problems than are able to be solved in the show. And frankly, any woman will tell you that, that would be the breaking point of no return. No normal, decent mother would continue on with a man who has sex with underage children, who you know has had a massively dysfunctional and damaged childhood, with a young daughter in the home. NO. NOPE. NO WAY.  It raises other questions (such as, 'is our daughter next?'). The show would be over. The End. That's how you know a man wrote this.

Other than that MAJOR flaw that is somehow glossed over in the series - and which while watching I also excused in order to be able to move on with the main story line - other than that, this is a grossly engaging, well-acted, bare bones, to-the-point, purist drama.  I'm extremely impressed with Dornan and wish him well for his future career.  I think we will be seeing a lot more of him.  A Lot! (50 shades darker).",1456790400,,3207,4.464957264957265

5860558,2,B00DW5IKN4,"For all the amazing new programming Netflix originals has brought us, it has also strung along a whole list of shows that weren't good enough to be picked up by cable, The Fall is one such show. It may sound ridiculous to say that a six episode season felt too long, but when it came to this show, that was certainly the case.

In Belfast, there has been a string of murders that the police are unequipped to handle, so they called in one of Scotland Yards top investigators to help solve the crime. The description of the show could lead one to assume that this would be a great murder mystery series, and it might have been, if not for the fact that the show parallels the investigation with the killers life. There is no mystery here, other than how something like this was turned into a series. The Fall has maybe enough content for a movie, and even then it wouldn't be a very good one.

X-Files star Gillian Anderson stars in a role that is completely unbelievable for her. First we are to believe, that because she has red hair and freckles, that she is from Ireland, when her ridiculous attempt at an accent says otherwise. Beyond that, she plays this icy cold, promiscuous woman, who makes a hell of a lot of mistakes for a woman whose supposed to be the best Scotland Yard has too offer.

As for the first season, it's only six episodes, but it felt more like six days, as it moves at a snails pace. British Dramas are almost always dry, but this series takes the cake, not only is it as slow as can be, but there is very little action and absolutely no attempts at humor to break up the monotony.

The Fall is painfully straight-forward, slow moving, and it leaves nothing to the imagination. Unfortunately, once you start the series, it's like a car crash, it's horrible, but hard to look away. I wanted to like this show, so I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing does, it just builds to a anti-climatic cliffhanger, that leads us into season two, which I wanted absolutely no part of.

The name Gillian Anderson may peak the interest of my fellow science fiction aficionados, and if you ask Netflix, they'll tell you it's the greatest mystery of all time, but the only mystery to me, is why I continued to watch this show after the first episode.",1451779200,2,2273,4.42822966507177

5860560,1,B00DW5IKN4,"I had high hopes that were dashed almost immediately!  First off lots and lots of slow walking, hallway people staring at doors, swimming yada yada yada to fill the time up for this endless tedious story.  The watcher has no idea why the characters act like they do and it seems almost no one has any redeeming qualities.  People don't behave or talk like the people in this contrived drama.  Story could have been easily told in 90 minutes instead of 5 hours --  probably a lot better too!",1451260800,3,490,4.46067415730337
5860561,5,B00DW5IKN4,"Good stuff!  Anderson is really engaging and comes across pretty well as a kind of ambivalent in the moral sense, Senior Detective.  Passable English accent.  Pretty gritty and not for younger kids but a really good story.  She will always be Dana Scully to me but she has gotten formidable as an actress over time.",1451260800,,315,4.672727272727273
5860562,5,B00DW5IKN4,"I think this is a great series and very 'BBC' in that it centers on the people and the psychology of interaction, and not on the blood-and-guts like American crime shows do.

Gillian Anderson plays her part extremely well as an emotionally unattached woman who is (still) largely playing in a man's world all the while dealing with her own demons. Jamie Dornan is absolutely spectacular as the complex villain and is chilling and yet mesmerizing to watch.

I highly recommend this if you like more thought than action in your crime dramas.",1449619200,,539,4.78494623655914

5860572,1,B00DW5IKN4,"I always loved Gillian Anderson in X-files. And John Lynch in ""In The Name of the Father."" The actors are all competent to excellent.

I sat through 4 episodes because I'd nixed 3 other series due to the violence & torture. My husband really wanted to watch this. We have a tiny house & so there is nowhere to go where I wouldn't hear the TV.
Anyway. If you enjoy laborious shots of women going through the most hellish torture imaginable & endless scenes of people walking down halls, watch this. If you want to see Gillian Anderson turned into a soulless mannequin, watch this. Her character has No emotion. I worked at a Detective Unit in a big city & there was not one person who worked there who was even remotely like her character. It's absurd.
John Lynch's character & the wife & children of the murderer are the only interesting people in this entire series.
I have no idea why it's OK to create something as disgusting as this show. I finally put my foot down in episode 4 & turned it off.

5860587,5,B00DW5IKN4,"This psychological thriller examines the lives of two hunters -- one is a serial killer who preys on victims in and around Belfast, Northern Ireland, and the other is a female detective drafted from the London Metropolitan Police to catch him.

Metropolitan Police Superintendent Stella Gibson, (played here with precision and grit by Gillian Anderson), is brought over to Belfast, Northern Ireland, to review a high-profile murder case that has remained active for longer than 28 days. A professional woman was found strangled in her home, her body artfully posed in her bed. Stella soon sees possible connections to a different unsolved case, though others are skeptical. Failure to see that crimes are linked  linkage blindness  is a thing that will allow the killer to strike again, she advises a colleague. Soon enough, he does.

DSI Gibson must work with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, (PSNI), to find and capture the killer who methodically plans his murders, carefully selecting professional women of the same look and age, breaking into their houses and moving around their underwear, only to return a few days later, slowly strangle them and take pictures which he will savor later.

As time passes Stella's team works tirelessly to build a case, but they are met with complications both inside and outside the PSNI.  What Stella, an out-of-place Englishwoman, discovers is that Belfast is far from peaceful, with the locals simmering rage constantly threatening to boil over into violence. The killer's identity is revealed from the beginning of the series. Indeed he plays a prominent role, as large and important as Stella's. Irish actor Jamie Dornan, (known for his role in ""50 Shades of Grey""), is the psychopathic murderer. He has got to be the hunkiest killer ever! And he's hiding in plain sight,

""The Fall, is a five-episode crime series from the BBC that debuted on Netflix In February 2012.  BBC Two picked up ""The Fall"" series, written by Allan Cubitt and produced for BBC Two by Artists Studio and BBC Northern Ireland. Other cast members Archie Panjab as Reed Smith, the pathologist assigned to the cases that Gibson investigates; Emmett Scanlan as DC Glenn Martin; and Karen Hassan playing Annie Brawley, a victim of the serial killer who survives, miraculously! The main cast for this first series consisted of 12 cast members.

I think this is is one of Gillian Anderson's best works. She seem to get more attractive and sexier with each year and her acting range is quite evident here.

This is an addictive and provocative serial-killer drama.

5860602,5,B00DW5IKN4,"I adore Gillian Anderson, and this is a perfect role for her.  The character of Stella is fascinatingly confident, aggressive in the best ways, and competent.  Jamie Dornan was new to me before this show, but I heartily enjoyed his portrayal of a misogynistic serial killer.  One of the best things The Fall does is use Dornan to show that a attractive, seemingly normal family man can be a rapist/murderer.  On the flip side, of course, people that ""look like"" serial killers are not necessarily so - you can't judge a book by its cover, etc.

None of that was a spoiler, by the way.  The viewer knows the killer from the very first episode onward.  We get to see Spector's home life and killing life while Gibson and the police force focus on finding him ASAP.  I love horrors and thrillers and anything about serial killers so this is right up my alley.  If you aren't into that - probably this show isn't for you.

I've seen a lot of serial killer movies & tv shows, as well as read a lot of novels about them, and this show is smart, fast-paced, engaging and (in spite of the subject matter) fun.  You get some police work, some CSI, some family drama, hyper-political junk, sex and death.  What more could you ask for?  I particularly enjoy the fact that Gillian Anderson's character is not very nice, career-driven, brilliant (she mentions in passing that she has ""hundreds"" of degrees, her first in anthropology) and focused to the point of excluding everything else.  Also love Archie Panjabi, who I first saw with Keira Knightley in Bend it Like Beckam and then on The Good Wife - she plays the forensic pathologist here.  There are a number of notable male characters (including Jamie Dornan, of course, who plays the killer) and all do a wonderful job.  I suppose most of all I liked that I got to know the first victim (in the show, not the killer's first victim) beforehand - that made it so much harder to watch her be killed; made it much more personal.

5860643,5,B00DW5IKN4,"Love this series! I'm already a die-hard Jamie Dornan fan... but he actually exceeded my expectations in this. His acting is incredible! Almost hard to see him play this character after seeing him play in 50shades, because he's so darn believable as a serial killer. (lol) Gillian Anderson is wonderful in this, as well. This show is soooo freakin ADDICTIVE and intense - watched it all in one day!",1439164800,,398,4.782608695652174

5860656,5,B00DW5IKN4,If only all TV Cop/Detective Shows could be as good as THE FALL. This was fantastic. Thrilled to see there is a Season 2. The writing and acting are superb. If you don't already know it. Gillian Anderson (X-Files) grew up speaking both British and American accents. Tonight I will be watching Season 2 on one of those web sites that has a server over seas. I'm sure if I listed it here it would be censored. HA!,1436572800,,411,4.282051282051282

5860662,2,B00DW5IKN4,The killer is known from the beginning so the only question for the writing staff is how slow can the possibly move along the series.  ZZZZZZZ.  Gillian Anderson's character is hilarious and not on purpose.  Everything she says and does comes off as if she barely has any energy at all.  Is this the first zombie detective show?  I guess. I am waiting for the SNL parody of her character but unfortunately the show is not popular enough.,1435795200,2,437,4.551282051282051

He was so pleasing to the eye, until you would never expect him to do the things he did and get away with it! He stayed in great shape and was a great family man and a great husband to his wife! Yes I said he is a family man. You really have to get this series 1 and watch it very carefully. It is a thriller to no end!

5860684,5,B00DW5IKN4,"Jamie Dornan for the Emmy! It pains me to agree with Anthony Lane's review of 50 Shades in the New Yorker, Jamie smolders here far more explosively than in 50 Shades. I think director Sam Taylor-Johnson could have gotten a lot more out of him, which you'd never know if you had not watched him in The Fall.",1433376000,,306,4.293103448275862

It's great to see her talent beyond the X Files.  Amazing.  Jamie Dornan does an excellent job of being dark & just plain old creepy/scary.  His performance, like Ms. Anderson, draws you.  You cannot help but sit and watch each episode one right after another.  ""Bingeing"" I think it's called.  It's going to be tough waiting for the next season.  One which I will also buy.  That says a lot right there.  I do not normally buy shows/movies.

I've loved Gillian Anderson since her X Files days & have recently enjoyed watching her small yet spectacular role in Hannibal. When I saw she stared in this series I just had to check it out. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a unique take on the standard police procedural show. This one plays out more like a book IMO where we also get to go inside the mind & every day life of the serial killer, equally frightening and fascinating.",1426032000,,529,4.408163265306122
5860793,5,B00DW5IKN4,"I found this gripping. I'm not convinced of Gillian's accent, but she did grow up there, so perhaps it's real or I'm just too familiar with her American accent. Anyway, if this was a book (or is it?) you would call it a page turner that you can't put down.

The plot is completely morose, disturbing for disturbing's sake, and uninteresting. Go watch ""Hannibal"" instead. It also has Gillian in it, and she is fantastic (along with the rest of the cast). Plus, you get a laugh every now and then to break up the horror. I promise you will not laugh once watching this show. Depressing, unfulfilling, and unsatisfying.",1425254400,4,483,4.831325301204819

Dornan's brooding/dark Specter displays the rationale for his casting as Christian Grey. I wanted to see if his selection was a fluke for the movie. Oh,no. The guy's got the talent and acting panache.

5860817,5,B00DW5IKN4,"I stumbled across this series on a video streaming service that I subscribe to.  I was sick with the flu and just trying to pass the time while I felt miserable.  After the first episode, I was completely hooked and ended up watching series 1 and series 2 over the next couple of days.  The whole show is just completely amazing.  Gillian Anderson especially gives a stand out performance as Stella Gibson, the lead detective on the case of a series of strangulation murders in Belfast.  There is an interweaving of plots featuring a number of the characters but it all eventually ties back in to the one being handled by DCIS Gibson.  To see the portrayal of a woman as strong, intelligent, independent and sexy all at the same time is quite rare but Ms. Anderson pulls it off easily.  At one point one of the other detectives asks her, ""Do you realize the effect that you have on men?""  She is unapologetically in charge of the investigation and has no problem with putting anyone, even her superiors, in their place when the need arises.  Jamie Dornan (of Fifty Shades of Grey) plays the serial killer and he is completely believable as the loving father/husband who secretly stalks and then murders women before returning home to bathe his kids and put them to bed.  He is both a man and a monster.  Every single character on the show is done with such authenticity and attention to detail that you get completely lost in the story.  Series 2 has a cliffhanger ending so I'm hoping that means a season 3 will be forthcoming.  Fingers crossed.  Honestly, though, if you enjoy shows like Criminal Minds, True Detective or Law and Order, this is a must see.  This is not a show for the kids, however, as it features sexual violence, nudity, and profanity.",1423699200,,1756,4.583333333333333
5860818,2,B00DW5IKN4,"So just finished season 2 of The Fall which just came out almost 2 years after season 1st. I have never experienced a show that has declined in logic and common sense from the previous incredible 1st season. I can't tell if it's bad writing or editing or probably both but by the end you just question how this got green lit with all the inconsistent continuity and just irrational scenes. We know this is a fictional show, but the subject matter is very much based in reality and yet, with every episode , we are asked to believe more and more in absurdity. One of the best is when the detectives finally get the name of the killer and they don't arrest him. They allow him to continue on with his life in hopes that he will lead him to a victim he has hidden. I'm sorry, but that is ridiculous. The guy has killed 4 woman they know of and to have him out on the streets to possible kill again?!? Another blunder scene is at the end when he leads them to the spot where he has his victim hidden. He takes them to this dense forrest and tells Andersons character to walk into the woods about 100 yards. She walks up into the woods on a very small path with trees and goes farther and farther into the woods. Finally coming to a ditch with a car parked there. So we are to believe that a guy drove a car deep into the woods with all those trees and no clearing to drive on?!?
There are many irrational scenes like these through out the 6 episodes. I also love how they portray this guy like a Ninja. This guy can get into anyone's house or apt with the stealth of a super villain. It wouldn't seem so far fetch if the places were unoccupied, but just about every break-in the victim is home and doesn't ever notice or hear anything until he is ready for them to. There is even a scene where he breaks into Andersons hotel room while she is out. She comes back, he hides, another cop visits her and he is still hiding and somehow sneaks out without being detected. Seriously? 1 bed 1bath hotel room. Just like a Holiday Inn would have. Could you walked into your hotel and spend a hour with someone else and not notice a 3rd party, lol. Its these lack of logical details in a show that wants you to take it seriously that makes it fail. It wants to be intelligent on the surface, but under that it's all just the work of a amateur writer who really based this in a comic book world.",1422748800,4,2380,4.176086956521739
5860819,5,B00DW5IKN4,"I really don't need to add much that hasn't  already been said about this series. With Thanks to KGHarris I will repost a quote from his review.

""The Fall"" is definitely positioned to be enjoyed by a thoughtful adult audience. Anderson is terrific, and Dornan pulls off being both relatable and creepy (not an easy trick, to be sure). But all of the supporting performances are solid. Other notable names include Archie Panjabi (The Good Wife) as a medical examiner and John Lynch as a Belfast officer with past links to Anderson. This is both smart and literate entertainment. It's tough minded and absolutely fascinating.""

I actually didn't  like Gillian Anderson all that much on the X Files.  I thought she was just ok as an actress but now I am a fan.  Here she is brilliant.  Her character is so different really from the X Files and I see now that she is really a wonderful actress.  The actor  playing the Serial Killer also does an excellent job.  It is highly interesting to see how he lives a double life.  It does remind me of Dexter in some ways due to the fact that you know who the serial killer is from the start and you get to see how he makes all of this happen while trying to maintain a regular family life.  I will admit I was pretty bored and unsure of this show on episode 1 but by episode 2 I was completely hooked and could not stop watching it until I was done.

5860824,4,B00DW5IKN4,"Honestly I only bought this series cause of Fifty Shades Jamie Dornan and I got to say it was good. I mean a show about a serial killer isn't new. Been there done that type thing and I heard they were making an American version. Ugh why? Leave it alone. But the show itself was entertaining, fresh, creepy [well not really not as creepy as Dexter or Hannibal <== oddly enough Gillian Anderson was on that show, weird right?] But Jamie was really good as Paul Spector who goes around killing women for really no reason except for his pleasure and really that's what most serial killers goal is when they off someone, is to get off on it. But anyways would I recommend this show to someone? Well it depends on their interest in the subject matter or if they like shows about serial killers which is not for everyone. If you like Jamie then yes watch it. Gillian does a great job on the show as the head police office on the trail for Paul [Jamie] will she catch him...I guess you'll have to find out. I actually liked the show so much I didn't watch for amazon to put the show on dvd I reopened my Netflix so I could watch the 2nd season. In all honestly I would probably never have even watched this show if Jamie wasn't on it and that's being totally truthful here so if you love Jamie Dornan will you enjoy this show",1421798400,5,1317,4.250996015936255

5860832,4,B00DW5IKN4,"`The Fall' is dark, gritty and gruesome look human nature. Many of the other reviews have focused on the `sexuality, disturbing violence, blah, blah, blah' but the real focus should be on the masterful way the show is crafted to explore the fragile, damage and often unrelenting evil that exist in everyone- though in varying forms.  I am sure if you have not watched the show, you are thinking `what the hell does that mean' and those who have watched are like `this chick is crazy' but allow me to attempt to explain.

Gibson (Anderson) has the coldness and hardness of the woman she is meant to be, the acting is well and not something that needs an explanation. Her character is meant to be some sort of moral compass for the show, to expose, hunt, chase and capture the man responsible for the brutal deaths of women in Belfast. However, I find that she is not some beautiful woman in her mid-life that contains a moral compass- au contraire; we learn that she is a narcissist, devious and arrogant woman. She has sex under her own terms, with who she wants, regardless of their marital status, keeps incompetence around her so she can manipulate, whether women or men,  bend when she needs to and has secrets that wake her in the night. There is a name for people who act like this...and while we are meant to root for her to catch her killer, I was left with, she is obsessive, manipulative, and cunning. Perhaps to catch a killer is ....to know your enemy you are best to be just like them.

Which leads me to Spector (Dornan) and he is so creepy, the indifference of his idealist life (the wife, the kids, the home the steady job) is something that eats at him every day and it is evident in the way he lives in the dark, when he is alone. His character is complex, there is no obvious `oh, you are a crazy murderer'. The audience, I believe, is meant to see him as a man who appears to have what everyone wants, yet finds that having everything is suffocating. I get that others will see him as some ruthless killer who deserves no sympathy, but they are missing the point. There is a reason for all actions and we are meant to find the why? And Dornan does an excellent job of showing brokenness, animosity, hatred, and even moments of compassion (but not where one would expect). There are no clear excuses for him, I mean he kills women for no point (so it seems) simply because he has lost control of his own life and craves it somewhere. His outlet is the hunt, the capture, the ability to suffocate someone else. His indifference is frightening and you can't look away-

 Past the violence and death emerges the fact that there is little difference between Spector (Dornan) and Gibson (Anderson) except her way of obsession is legal (and we have yet to see her physically take a life, but she does damage nonetheless).

The subplots are what slow the show down. I really do not care about the rich-coke-man-boy and his daddy issues, nor the life of dirty cops. If Series Two can tie all these together, that would be helpful and surprising.

Overall, this is a great export from across the pond and if you can get past the imagery of death and violence you are in for a deep investigation into evil, whether accidental or deliberate.",1419897600,2,3249,4.476351351351352

5860840,5,B00DW5IKN4,"Creating attractive and charming fictional monsters that prey on women is nothing new; Bram Stoker, for example, used it to great effect and spawned a whole industry. The Fall is no exception with young, attractive, athletic bereavement counsellor, Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan) providing solace to the grieving by day and feeding his twisted and murderous erotic fantasies by night: this when he's supposed to be looking after his toddler son and primary-aged daughter while wife, Sally Ann (Bronagh Waugh), is out on night shift as a neonatal nurse.

Spectors' targets conform to a stereotype: all young slim attractive professional women with dark brown hair. He either sources them from the internet or capitalizes on opportunistic encounters in bars etc. He appears to be very skilled at gaining information about them and is an accomplished housebreaker enabling him to gain entry to their homes once he's tracked them down. His other primary asset, of course, is that he is a practiced and convincing liar.

His various attractions lead him to become the focus of another's obsessive fantasies, the couple's baby sitter, 15 tear old Katie Benedetto (Aisling Franciosi) who attempts to use her emerging sexual allure to trap him into committing adultery.

Spector's first victim is Alice Monroe and high flying Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson), a homicide specialist from the Metropolitan Police, is seconded to take over the investigation. A second victim displaying the same MO convinces Gibson that they are dealing with a serial killer.

If Spector (is the name purely a coincidence?) is the vampire, stalking his victims under cover of darkness in order to sate his lust for what appear to be copies of his first `love', Gibson is a kind of power dressing vampire slayer.

But she is no Buffy and harbours dark desires of her own and what makes this particular killer/cop duel insidious is the comparative attractiveness of the killer and the unsettling and vaguely disturbing otherworldliness of the cop!",1418256000,,2039,5.223241590214068

PRO-Gillian Anderson commands the screen, you can barely look at anyone else when she is on. The setting in Belfast, Ireland really adds to the suspense. The serial killer really keeps your interest, he's a fascinating guy. And Ben Peel, who plays the hottie cop, was mighty fine. Both as an actor and to look at.
CON-I was glad I had the remote so I could speed along thru parts. This show sometime spends 2 minutes pointing out something that could have taken less than a minute. And SPOILER ALERT - the ending leaves things rather unresolved.

An examination of sexual predator, which is framed against the locale of, post-Troubles Belfast. This is Where a cop has to deal with sectarian riots outside a murder scene. In addition, where a serial killer's painstaking plans can be confounded by Loyalist thugs?

Dornan plays Paul Spector grief counsellor, former Samaritans voluntary helper and serial killer who is terrorising the city of Belfast. This series revolves around a PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) investigation in Belfast into a string of Murders. Detective Superintendent Gibson played by Gillian Anderson, who is on secondment from London's Metropolitan Police Service, heads the police investigation. This is a gripping cat-and-mouse series, where Dornan plays an intelligent, articulate - but deeply flawed character who gives into his deep dark desires, yet his misogyny seems rather selective or maybe he has a degree of self-control. Whatever, the case, vis--vis his predilections each episode of the five part episodes of this first season is a rather addictive to watch, as we see Detective Superintendent Gibson trying to find him and stop predatory killing spree. The provided Mise-en-scne of Belfast after the troubles, is none the less still a potential tinderbox, where sectarian gangs still hold sway. Some may be less satisfied by 'The Fall' finale - or feel that they were left hanging, whatever the case this series leaves enough mileage to run into season two.

This is one of the best series to come out the BBC lately. The second series of the Fall is expected to premiere on BBC this year.

The production values and cast are good across the board, the setting is interesting, and Gillian Anderson's character here is poles apart from Dana Scully in more than one way which I appreciate from an acting standpoint. The only misgiving that I have about this show is that the subject matter is hard to watch, specifically meaning the actions of the killer, who we get to follow with full knowledge and access from the start. Not gore or violence, but rather all of the ethical lines that he crosses. That does not negate the artistic value of the show, but it did make for some uncomfortable viewing on my part. Disturbing content, so be warned.

5860869,4,B00DW5IKN4,"Hmmm . . . this is a tough one to review accurately.  One's personal feelings get jumbled into the mix -- perhaps precisely because of the effectiveness of the acting.  It's quite different in many respects from the typical ""detective versus serial killer"" mystery.  I like that about it. It's ironic, surprising, and original.  Jamie Dornan, who plays the serial killer Peter Spector, does an outstanding job of acting.  The frequent emphasis on and insight into his home life and his career provide a startling contrast to his inner life, which filled with demons of an unknown origin.  The viewer may posit this darkness emerged from Spector's lonely childhood in a series of foster homes, but we don't really know what loss or torments pushed him to develop his alter ego.  In a hugely ironic way, most of Spector's character seems to be more settled, satisfied, and healthy than does the character of the lead detective.  Spector, a bereavement counsellor, is capable of great compassion, great love, and shows the possession of  (again, most ironically) a strong moral code. (Except, of course, when his demons strike.) But why do they strike?  And how are they to be stopped? These questions, along with a good many others, are only raised and never fully resolved.  Gillian Anderson, on the other hand, plays an emotionally repressed, alienated, obsessive personality who seems incapable of empathy or close, healthy personal relationships.  The standard genre tables are turned here.  Further, it's interesting that the action is set in Belfast where, if one ventures into the ""wrong"" street, ""good guys"" can become menacing ""enemies""-- depending, of course, on which ""side"" you ""belong.""  It's all tangled and the alliances and rivalries that make up Northern Irish society and politics, get quietly played out within the investigation and the story line, as well.  Mind you, there's never any obvious mention of Protestant Unionist versus Catholic Republicans -- that would be too obvious for this production -- but the tensions are still roiling underneath it all.  All told, I found this to be a dark, compelling, disturbing, fascinating, and refreshingly ""different"" treatment of the genre.  I'm less enthralled with Gillian Anderson in this role, but that may be more the result of the success of her acting (again, ironically) than her failure. Her character, Detective Superintendent  Stella Gibson, is a really detached, unpleasant, and highly controlled individual. Stella is no one you would like to spend time with. There was something too ""studied"" and contrived about her portrayal which distracted me from her character. I can't point to a specific instance, but it's almost as if there were some tic or aberration which, once noticed, became annoying to me.  What I can say is that the way her character spoke made it very difficult for me to understand her.  It wasn't the accent she used (a very toffee-nosed one, by the way) but the low, intense volume and rapidity of her speech.  She seemed even to be repressing her words -- quiet, intense, clipped.  Annoying. On reflection, the tables get surprisingly turned between the ""good guy"" and the ""bad guy"" -- in every sense of the word.  It's a thoughtful, troubling, dark, and intelligent production.  And there is a twist at the end that many viewers may not like.  I won't spoil it for anyone, but I will say, the ending fits with the whole tone of this series.  Everything is unexpected; unpredictable.",1410566400,4,3483,5.034904013961605

It could even be described as ""under the top? -- seemingly slow moving, letting the characters drive the plot rather than vice versa, literature on film rather than  a thriller put to pictures.

Detective Gibson is the first to finally connect the killings and consequently coordinates a task force determined to find him and take him down. There seems to be a bit of a department scandal in the works as well. Gibson is relentless in her search all while the killer is keeping her in his sights.

Love ""The Fall"" series. It's a great crime and thriller saga, and though it isn't particularly gruesome, there is heavy sexuality and romantic issues at play. Lots of cursing too. I figured there would be since this is not made for prime time television. Just a heads up you may or may not want to watch with kiddos present.

This plot is incredible. It drew me in. The story is delivered so that you view two different stories. The one of the detective and that of the killer. You know what's going. You can watch the near misses and close calls. See them circling each other.

5860890,5,B00DW5IKN4,"An interesting take on the serial killer genre which casts an attractive [ think Ted Bundy] family man as the killer. There is no who done it here. We know from the outset who the killer is. What is so wonderfully fascinating is the way the writers have handled the premise and turned it on its ear. The killer is no drooling madman sitting in his mother's basement but a handsome young grief counselor, who is an attentive husband and a caring father. What happened to him to make him the way he is? We have some tantalizing clues which promise to develop the next seasons. In any case, like Bundy, he has a preferred physical type which  he preys on--but perhaps his choices are also indicative of his own struggles and lack of achievement since he only strikes at successful professional women.

Or so theorizes  investigator Stella Gibson  [ Gillian Anderson ].  On his trail, she slowly unravels the clues behind his actions, and while he hunts for women in the Belfast night, she hunts him. As he takes his pleasure manifesting total control over his victims, she does the same during her sexual encounters --and shows little concern when her sexual playmate, a policemen, is gunned down. Is she able to get into the killer's mind so well because she has some of the same characteristics? Possibly. Certainly she seems to relate to people only in a professional capacity. Wonderfully well done--and is building slowly and carefully into a fascinating psychological study of both individuals.",1406246400,16,1497,4.809338521400778

5860894,3,B00DW5IKN4,"The Fall uses the same playbook as The Killing, but isn't quite as engaging as the latter.

Gillian Anderson plays a tough detective trying to catch a killer. The show does a great job of showing the parallels between her character and the killer, played by Jaimie Dornan. But really, that's about all. It does get a bit more intense toward the end - especially as the killings escalate. There are a few odd crimes that will tie to the serial killer, but it was hard to say just how and why.

Unfortunately, overall the show is slow. It saves those WOW moments for the very end - which makes it a long journey between episodes. The Killing kept viewers going through entire episodes. I think the show could have been done in about two hours rather than five episodes.

This season did not end. I was pretty aggravated at The Killing for not finding Rosie Larsen's killer at the end of the first season. I wasn't as aggravated here, because I wasn't nearly as engaged with The Fall.

The Fall isn't bad, but it isn't a must-watch for me. It might be interesting to see the detective catch the killer, but I'm not interested in watching several seasons for that to happen.

If you are looking for the next The Killing, this isn't exactly it, but if you like the serial format - where you get a cliffhanger ending until the next season - this show might be for you.",1404604800,3,1362,4.410358565737051

1) You already know everything about the crime to start off with.  No figuring anything out.
2) WAY too much focus on the sick disgusting behavior of the serial killer
3) Characters doing stupid things -- the serial killer's wife is leaving as the 15-year old babysitter arrives unexpectedly, starts to send her home, then relents because it is raining and lets her in knowing her husband is getting the 15-year-old a beer?  Why not just say ""Let me give you a ride home.""?  And the Gillian Anderson character has random sex with a police officer who technically is under her command so this is career-killing sexual harassment?

5860927,5,B00DW5IKN4,"Crime dramas are a dime a dozen, so what is it about The Fall that makes it stand out? Three points spring to mind.

First of all, Gillian Anderson as Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson is a joy to behold (but would you have expected anything else from her?) In what is very much an ensemble cast, she is the closest thing the show has to a protagonist, playing a woman brought in from England to Ireland to oversee the investigation into the murder of successful architect Alice Monroe. A cold and clinical woman, shes immensely good at what she does and is not about to tolerate anyone getting in her way. Oozing self-assurance and class, Stella effortlessly takes command and re-galvanizes the police department in their hunt for the killer.

Secondly (and surprisingly), the show makes no secret of who the killer is. Paul Spector is a family man and grief counsellor who is first seen breaking into the home of a female solicitor and arranging her underwear on her bed. His wife and children have no idea who he really is, and so the audience is invited to watch him juggle his work and family life with his nocturnal affairs, all the while trying to avoid undue attention from the police. Its a chilling performance by Jamie Dornan, whose normal exterior and fondness for his family doesnt erase his terrifying drive for violence and domination.

Lastly, the setting of Belfast makes for some rich interplay between characters and environment. As is pointed out to Stella early on, policing in this city is both deeply political. The PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) is portrayed as passionately devout yet often corrupt, involved in anything from extra-marital affairs to prostitution rings and drug-dealing. Emotions run high in the police headquarters, not helped by a memorial plaque on the wall dedicated to those murdered in the line of duty. Not killed, but murdered. This attitude spills out onto the streets, where not even a simple arrest can be made or a murder scene investigated without an angry mob showing up to hurl things at the police.

Written by Allan Cubitt and directed by Jakob Verbruggen, The Fall is an exquisitely shot and performed drama that delves into the psychology of not only a killer, but the people who hunt them down. With dozens of characters and a myriad of subplots, its a show that demands your full attention as threads weave in and out of each other, many seemingly irrelevant but eventually tied in with the larger whole. Co-workers, babysitters, family members, reporters, former lovers  all of them get some degree of screen-time across the first seasons five episodes, and all of them pack a punch.

But the real interest lies in the creepy parallels between Stella and Spector. Both are cold and detached people, but Spector has a much easier time of hiding it behind a veneer of warmth and geniality. It is that it is Stella (our hero) who is such an ice queen that its difficult to get a grasp of her personality, and for much of the drama she remains an enigma; more a force of nature than an actual person. There are even a few eerie parallels between normality and Spectors perversity, such as when his wife (a neonatal nurse) suggests to a grieving mother than they wash, dress and take some pictures of her deceased infant  the very same thing that her husband does to his murder victims.

It ends on something of a cliff-hanger (so abruptly that I was left searching for a sixth episode), but thankfully a second season has been commissioned. While it lasts its compelling and insightful drama, sometimes disturbing but never too gratuitous, with impeccable actors at the top of their game. Id definitely recommend for fans of crime drama who think theyve seen it all  or simply want to watch beautifully crafted television drama.",1398038400,2,3804,4.804281345565749

Cop shows used to be interesting to watch but now it's all about sensationalism for profit or it's a quick way to fill up the script so the writers don't have to do any real writing.

Not long ago, while taking the tube in London, I saw a poster for a play Ms Anderson was doing in the West End. Given her background in theatre, this was impressive. Recently I saw her outstanding performance in The Crimson Petal & The White, and was very impressed by her performance as the madame of a brothel. Made up like an old crone, she was the opposite of Hollywood glamour.

Shame on me for not knowing much about one of the great actresses of our time.

The only other actress imaginable as Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson, seconded from the Metropolitan Police to review a murder investigation in Belfast, Ireland, is Helen Mirren. That says a lot. Anderson is amazing in the role and the way she gradually reveals that her DS Gibson is almost as cold as the murderer she is trying to capture, is breathtaking.

Im not quite sure why the series is called THE FALL. I thought it might have something to do with the Fall from Grace, with all the inherent spirituality the subject suggests. After five episodes I still couldn't decide why, though it hardly matters. THE FALL is an amazing achievement.

The rest of the cast is perfect. Particularly ultra-handsome Jamie Dornan, who is magnificent as the serial killer, Paul Spector. In fact, there really isn't a false note among the huge cast list. One of the comments made in the behind the scenes featurette reinforces this, remarking that a lot of well-established Irish actors were champing at the bit to be involved in this A-level production.

Its apparent by the writing, direction, acting and the cumulative impact of the entire production why the show was such a hit. A six-part second series has been commissioned, to begin filming in January, 2014. Since all of the major cast has signed to appear, this suggests that the story in series 1 isn't over yet, a very tantalizing thought. Having said that, the recent announcement out of Hollywood that Jamie Dornan, the sex-obsessed killer in THE FALL, has been signed to star in the big screen adaptation of 50 SHADES OF GREY, may throw that idea into jeopardy. We shall have to wait and see. The hotly-anticipated 50 SHADES is a natural fit for Dornan, with its erotic blend of sex and obsession. If THE FALL was Dornans audition for the part of Christian Grey it couldn't have been more convincing!

Theres a lot of abuse of women on hand, but the battle of the sexes is given a fresh take the way the series develops. Andersons character is pretty ruthless herself and is not above taking advantage of her position in life to get what she wants. The difference between her and murderer Spector is that she lives her life within the law, though sometimes outside the circle of conventional morality. By the way, it is not a spoiler to say Dornan plays the killer as we learn that almost immediately. This is not a who done it? or even a How done it? It is more of a Why done it and is he going to get away with it? There are some genuine surprises and chills within that approach.

Theres a lot of bad language which, once again, arguably isn't necessary. This and some pretty rough sexual assault scenes are mentioned for those whose tastes may incline to a less graphic presentation.

THE FALL is wonderful television: fresh, intriguing and as good as anything out there. Approximately half of that success is directly attributable to the brilliant Gillian Anderson, with Jamie Dornan not far behind.",1397433600,2,3592,4.6635071090047395

(No spoilers here, you know who he is from the beginning.) Anderson's character is one of the strongest female characters I've seen in a long time, both from the writing and her performance.

She played a boring part with conviction, no humor, smile or connection to anyone except for the cop she told to come to her room.  There were 5 disc I think and after a very boring movie the killer wasn't captured.  perhaps the company didn't get the reviews they were hoping for so cancelled a second season.  Had they known that there wouldn't be a second season it would have been considerate for them to add another episode showing his capture. So I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to see the killer ride off into the sunset and wonder he will kill again.  Definitely wouldn't recommend it and felt it was a waste of our time.unless you want to bored by the Olympic games.

5860969,5,B00DW5IKN4,"I was engrossed by this story from the moment it started.  When the names of the actors and actresses appeared, the only one I recognised was Gillian Anderson.  The documentary tells us that the others are Irish actors and they are all excellent.  It took a little while to get to know some of the faces but it wasn`t a real problem.  Filmed in Belfast adds greatly to the atmosphere.

We know from the first few minutes, who is the killer, so we don`t have to work that out. The actor who plays him, Jamie Dornan, is terrifying.  So creepy that I even went and checked that all our doors were locked!  The scene of him playing with the hair that he has cut from one of his victims, is one of the most compelling I have ever seen.

Gillian Anderson is the detective brought in from the Metropolitan police, to try and find something that will set them on the killer`s trail.  He has left nothing to chance and is very clever.

The ending is unusual and not what I expected.  It leaves the opportunity to carry on the series and `The Fall, Series 2` is being filmed at the moment.  A lot of the actors from this film will be in the new film.  The whole series is a credit to everyone concerned.  I can`t praise it highly enough.",1390348800,9,1227,4.255411255411255
5860970,5,B00DW5IKN4,"Gillian Anderson is familiar in British costume pieces. And she seems to pull off the accent because she spent years there as a child, and she seemingly doesn't try too hard. She succeeds where most American actresses fail. In this Northern Irish production for the BBC she takes on a contemporary crime drama a genre in which the British excel. This is a subtle but taught narrative about a string of Belfast murders the police just can't solve They call Scotland Yard in for help which arrives in the form of a Chief Inspector ,played brilliantly by Anderson, who character is an expert in serial killings.
Then there is the criminal played convincingly by British actor Jami Dornan, who many will remember is playing the male lead in Fifty Shades of Grey. He is pernicious as a brutal rapist and killer who is also a baby faced, loving father and husband. You hate him and are seduced by his good looks at the same time.  Of course doesn't hurt that he is naked often (salacious but true). His wife is fooled and seduced by him well into and even after his bloody spree.

After finishing the first season/series (5 episodes), I can't wait to see what happens next. The dark beauty of this drama is that it gives equal footing to both Gillian Anderson's character & Jamie Dornan's. We are shown how Jamie hunts women and how he kills them while taking parts of them as memories. Gillian's character is introduced and she slowly spearheads the investigation as she is able to formulate the fact that the killings aren't a one-off and have a pattern,

 The writers have to be lauded for developing the characters and the varied character cast who stand forth uniquely. The only drawback to these episodes was the slow pace but if you are like me and don't mind terrific acting from both the leads and the character cast, then you shouldn't have an problems.

5860975,4,B00DW5IKN4,"What's the old clich about serial killers?  ""He was quiet and he kept to himself""?  Well, not so in the BBC's five-part series, The Fall.  Defying both convention and viewer expectations, Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan) is a husband and father.  This dichotomy of character is deeply, deeply disturbing.  As is much of what is depicted in The Fall.  This is dark stuff.  The police hunting this killer, led by Gillian Anderson as Stella Gibson, are some pretty dark characters themselves, leading to a rather moody and atmospheric production.

That said, this is smart television.  British series always seem to be more along the line of what viewers in the US might see on premium cable.  Things are a bit edgier and more graphic.  The writing and performances in The Fall are sharp.  And despite knowing from the start who-done-it, the tone of the series is unrelentingly suspenseful.

The Fall won't appeal to everyone.  This is a grim telling of a sad story.  Also, it should be noted, this first series does not come to a neat resolution.  Personally, I'm a fan of these more realistic endings, but the BBC has promised more of The Fall, so we shall all have to see what comes next.",1389830400,,1183,4.697560975609756
5860976,5,B00DW5IKN4,"I sat down to The Fall after a rather enjoyable stint with another ACORN/BBC series Jack Irish and was expecting more of the same. Gillian Anderson's The Fall is oh so much more.

Revolving around the dual stories of Anderson's Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson and serial murder Paul Spector, the first series spans five episodes of tense drama as Spector stalks and kills while Gibson rallys the Belfast police to track him down. As the show progresses and Spector takes more risks and makes more mistakes, Gibson has to contend with politics, conspiracies, and general misogyny while trying to deal with both the killer and the other crisis that develop (including the murder and suicide of two policemen).

I love Anderson's Gibson... she's brilliant, driven, and no nonsense. All qualities that benefit and occasionally hinder her in a boy's club still seemingly not ready for her. There's a point in the middle of the series where a fellow detective confronts her on a separate case she is only peripherally related to that has some tremendously prescient lines concerning feminism and the double standards of modern society. Great stuff!

Spector's storyline is almost as compelling, suffering from the fact of you're never on his side as he goes about stalking, brutalizing, and murdering these women. Still, despite his glaringly obvious flaws, it's nice to have a serial killer living a relatively normal life outside of his darkness. It's something that even Dexter was missing thanks to the inner monologue we get from Michael C. Hall in that show, always reminding us how damaged he is. With Spector (played by Jamie Dornan) we see a devoted father and a seemingly similar husband... who betrays and manipulates all masterfully in order to maintain both his freedom and his anonymity.

I think The Fall has to be my second favorite series to come out of Britain... the first being ITV's Endeavour series feature a younger Detective Morse. I eagerly look forward to The Fall's SECOND series which is going into production Jan '14.

Well done from all involved... particularly Anderson.",1389830400,,2102,5.063583815028902

To my surprise, the series does not hide the identity of the serial killer, a sociopath with a Jeckyl and Hide sociopathic personality who has a family. It's a bit of a slow mover, which is typical for British series, but it's still good.",1389830400,,522,4.5638297872340425
5860978,5,B00DW5IKN4,"""The Fall"" is a crime drama series created by Allan Cubitt and directed by Jakob Verbruggen. The series follows a PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland) investigation, led by Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson), a Brit transfered to Belfast for the case after it remains open for 28 days. Under her new leadership, she leads the local detectives in their efforts to track down and stop the serial killer, Paul Spector, who is attacking young, professional women in the city of Belfast.

""The Fall"" takes its time and allows its moody atmosphere to develop at an unrushed pace. it's not giving anything away to say that you know a lot about the person Stella Gibson is hunting early on. The show uses crime and violence as a framework to examine assumptions about class, sanity, and social hierarchies. It is mindful of how the media and often the public sort crime victims into two different categories; the true victims who deserve pity and the tramps who had it coming to them. Stella refuses to adhere to that mentality.

Gillian Anderson is back in her biggest, and best role since ""The X-Files"", as Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson in this new five-part thriller ""The Fall"", created for the BBC. She plays an unapologetic woman in her sexual prime; Stella is sexually confident and comfortable in her own skin. If she finds a man attractive, she doesn't hesitate to make the first move. She's much more feminine than agent Dana Scully ever was and she revels in it. She is also not above using it as an asset or a weapon (whichever way you chose to look at it), if she needs to do it.

""The Fall"" recalls classic female protagonists. Stella doesn't apologize or explain herself. She is remote and chilly much of the time to those around her, and she clearly doesn't care what they think of her professional choices. Stella uses everything society vilifies women for using, her beauty and her intelligence. She has the ability to get results and that irks both her superiors and peers.

""The Fall"" is ultimately the battle for supremacy between two hunters, a strong intelligent woman hunting a killer and misogynic killer hunting strong women who broke out of their defined role. I wait season two with anticipation. Stay tuned...",1389744000,,2266,4.862694300518135
5860979,5,B00DW5IKN4,"For me a 5 star item does not have to be perfect.  It just have to draw me in to the point that I THINK it's perfect.  Looking back at this series I do admit that Gillian Anderson's accent wavers a bit at times.  However I was so enthralled with her character that it didn't really bother me.  In fact I started watching this series late on a weeknight intending to just watch the first episode. Five episodes later I was wondering if it was worth even trying to get any sleep. I have watched it twice since then, each time enjoying the story and characterization equally.

This is a serial killer/police procedural set in Belfast, Northern Ireland. There is a serial killer operating in Belfast and when the Police Service of Northern Ireland is unable to close the case within 28 days Gillian Anderson's character, Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson is brought in to review the case.  Driven, intelligent and self contained, DS Gibson is not above making a mistake that will haunt her as she struggles to identify the killer.

I've been fascinated by the reaction to Anderson's character as well. Some people have said that the character of the serial killer is more attractive and easier to like than Anderson.  I would argue that this is clearly intentional.  The serial killer (whose identity is not a secret) is living a total lie.  He is shown as having great affection for his children but hides evidence of his crimes in his daughter's room.  When he is caught out about an intended victim he immediately turns the incident to his own advantage.  Why would anyone prefer the sociopath whose whole life is a construct to the rough edged detective?  I think it has a lot to do with gender expectations. Anderson's character acts against what one would expect of a woman in a protective role.  But this ignores the fact that Anderson is not in the protector, she is the hunter instead.

I thought the ending was satisfying but others have disagreed.  I'm rather hoping that things will be further considered in a future episode.

Recommended for those who appreciate a well written, well acted series.

By the way, I hope everyone noticed that the episode titles were from John Milton's Paradise Lost.",1389744000,,2211,4.72845953002611
5860980,5,B00DW5IKN4,"First off let me say that I am a big fan of Gillian Anderson works, especially her role in the X-Files. Besides she is easy on the eyes, truth be told, she is downright sexy. This may be part of why I liked this season premier of The Fall. Some of the things I did not like was how difficult it was for me at times to understand what they were saying, in English mind you. Another thing I did not care for was the darkness, black and grey blue visual tones that sets the tone for this  crime drama. I believe this was done to emphasize the darkness of the subject matter. Is there a color to represent creepy? If so maybe they saturated the  screen with it. This show had me feeling the heebie-jeebies  throughout  it's duration. The music fits the mood  the storyline perfectly, it is disturbingly right on point. The moments of silence before the serial murderer strikes, the pacing and panning of the camera all create an atmosphere that makes you want to hide under your blanket. The show quickly reveals who the killer is and it then becomes a study in human or in this case inhumane nature. The killer is a creepy guy because he could be your neighbor.......or guidance counselor. Imagine that , taking guidance from a serial killer. When he starts messing around with the baby sitter you want reach out for the TV and say that is enough and tell the girl to run as fast as she can from this guy.  The irony and profile of the madman, as it is revealed, is like the slow dance of death he methodically carries out on his unsuspecting victims. The show is as much about the killer as it is about dear Detective Superintendent Gillian. What is revealed is a contrast in character study where  what appears to be good is evil. When the new police  Detective Superintendent Gibson arrives in Belfast to take control she quickly learns that a killer is on the loose, not to mention the political situations surrounding Belfast, Ireland, a hotbed of radical politics where a murder is being investigated. The pace is slow and deliberate but extremely captivating. I was sucked in even though I didn't want to see this guy in action and was hoping against hope that the beautiful red head heroine would catch this guy and the show would come to a happy conclusion. Instead I followed the story to the end only to be disappointed with Sir Creeps-a lot riding off into the sunset much like that other serial murderer, Dexter. As much as I didn't like the ending it did not take away from the drama and the inevitable message that the killer is always amongst us. As they always say in the news, while interviewing neighbors after tragic events of a killer are revealed........he was a good man, a little quiet but nice nonetheless. If you can stand getting scared by this creep amongst us go for it; it's scary because it's so real.",1389744000,,2829,4.479611650485437
5860981,4,B00DW5IKN4,"I was intrigued that this had very few episodes for season 1, which let me know before I stated it would have an open ending to lead into another season.  With that in mind I really enjoyed The fall.

Learning all about the mind and workings of a serial killer is the hook to this series, with the always brilliant Gillian Anderson chasing along., I enjoyed how we seem to be a third party watching her figure it all out while a the same times seeing the killer work.

It makes for a great third person experience. I wish they had added a few things to the short series, but it moved along nicely. I was a bit concerned the first part of episode one but quickly got caught up after that and watched the whole thing in a binge sitting.",1389657600,,734,4.191489361702128
5860982,3,B00DW5IKN4,"Perhaps it was my mood, perhaps it was the time of day, or the many many hours I have worked over the last few weeks  but when I sat down to watch this series I just couldn't get into it.  Ive thought over that for over a week, trying to figure out why.  I enjoy a good brooding dark show, and the acting was by no means bad.  The script wasn't terrible, the videography was fine I just couldn't get into it.  It was almost  too brooding, as if the atmosphere was the point, and it suffocated the life out of the pace.  Perhaps thats what it was, the pacing was too slow for my liking at the point that I watched it.
I was also a bit annoyed at the sudden end of the DVDs in which we are left with only part of the story told, and no appropriate ending.  Generally with a show, the season ends in such a way that you feel as though there has been some sort of closure to at least some aspect of the plot.  This just ended.  And apparently if I want to watch the rest I have to purchase the next part of the series.
I didn't hate the show, by any stretch of the imagination, I just felt very blah about it.  I fully intend to watch it again at a time when my mood is more oriented toward that type of filmmaking.  At that time I will either confirm or rescind this review and update it with my new point of view.",1389657600,,1311,3.9242424242424243

5860984,5,B00DW5IKN4,"Ever since seeing Gillian Anderson's performances as FBI Special Agent Dana Scully in the ""The X-Files"" TV series that spanned nine seasons (1993 to 2002), like so many others I was hooked... and I'm not one to go out of my way to watch that many sci-fi or horror series.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fall-Series-1/dp/B00DW5IKN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fall, Series 1</a>, is a highly absorbing and gritty five-hour story that follows a serial killer acting in an uninhibited fashion in Belfast, Ireland. He's a man who stalks and murders attractive young women while maintaining the pretense of a stable family man, and one who hides behind the facade of working as a grief counselor. Gillian Anderson delivers a truly subtle performance as London-based Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson, the tenacious investigator who is brought in to track down the killer.

The Fall sets up an alarming, grimy and persuasively realistic scenario right from the unusual opening scenes of the first episode. After two young professional women are found assaulted and murdered in their apartments, with their bodies left in carefully posed, the Belfast police call upon Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson to offer her proficiency and find out if the murders are in some way connected. Her supervisor, Police Captain Jim Burns (John Lynch), thinks that the most recent killing may have been related to the victim's former fiance. After a brief examination of the facts, Stella Gibson feels that both murders were done by the same person, and that the entire department needs to act speedily to prevent yet another murderous catastrophe from occurring.

While all this is going on, we see the upstanding family man Paul Spector (well played by Jamie Dornan) going out on nightly runs during which he clandestinely observes a young woman named Sarah Kay (Laura Donnelly). Breaking into her apartment while she's out, Spector rearranges things, leaving her subtle notes that she's being shadowed. The understandably distraught Kay calls the police for their protection, but they're limited in what they can do. When the third obvious victim of this killing spree turns up, Detective Gibson increases the department's investigation, despite resistance from both her superiors and the police-adverse Irish people that she questions. In the meantime, Spector continues to hide his deviant practices from his nurse wife, Olivia (Sarah Beattie) and his two young children.

The Fall initially seems to be an intense if slow (and somewhat mechanical) thriller. It opens up in unpredictably fascinating ways, especially when it comes to Stella Gibson and how she relates with those around her. She is initially seen as a no-nonsense, somewhat emotionless type whose British reserve alienates the police personnel she has been assigned to deal with. In the second episode, though, she spontaneously propositions one of the detectives to meet with her in her hotel room, where they share a passionate moment of intimacy. It's revealed in time that there was a similar occurrence with another professional colleague in her past.

This sensual side of Stella Gibson also displays itself during interactions with other females, like Police Constable Danielle Ferrington (well played by Niamh McGrady), a tough officer who reveals another side to her life during a moment of downtime. To have a main character display her quirky amatory side may seem strange at first, but the tactic serves as a way for Gibson to understand the motivations of the killer and track his movements before they happen. The Gibson vs. Spector dynamic is the most fascinating aspect of The Fall, but the series does an excellent job of showing a realistic world with a number of scenes that don't directly relate to the primary characters, but nevertheless paint a gritty yet enjoyable image as a backdrop.

The video quality of this DVD is good. Filmed digitally with a purposely dark and grainy look, the 1.77:1 (more commonly known as 16:9), widescreen image ends up looking good on disc. The image is well-modulated, and the darks never seem too murky. The audio is a straightforward Dolby Digital stereo mix, leaving the viewer with comprehensible dialogue and sound effects.

As far as performances go, Gillian Anderson is even better than she was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files-Season-1/dp/B001BWQ0XM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files Season 1</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-X-Files-Season-2/dp/B001CROUCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The X-Files Season 2</a>, or any other season for that matter, and this series is a good showcase for the range of her talents. It's another facet to her amazing capabilities, and far better than her performance as a middle aged businesswoman in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Closure/dp/B000SSQ7K6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Closure</a>&nbsp;(2007).

Irish actor Jamie Dornan (Sheriff Graham Humbert in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-A-Time/dp/B009RX85N0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon A Time</a>) played Paul Spector quite convincingly, and it's no wonder that he will have the male lead in the upcoming film adaptation of ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" The Fall series was created by Allan Cubitt and expertly directed by Jakob Verbruggen; the casting and the settings are quite authentic.

Don't shoot the messenger, but for those who like their series to end a season summing everything up in a nice, tidy package, with all the questions answered, this one may not be for you.  Throughout the series we saw Detective Superintendent Gibson's tough determination to prove herself as the dominant female in a male-dominated world; be that through her icy behavior in the workplace or her approach to office romance. Hers is a character that needs to have control over men, so it's not even thinkable that she can let a serial killer like Spector, who preys on women's insecurities, continue on his twisted path. To come so close, only for the murderer to have evaded her capture only makes her tenacity stronger.

""It won't be over until I stop you.""

With inspiring psychological drama, it is quite suspenseful, tough, darkly realistic and thoughtfully produced. This series will continue into its next season, and it's only a matter of time until Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson finally gets her man. This one is highly recommended.

not sure what else i can say other then you will love it",1389312000,,98,3.95
5860987,4,B00DW5IKN4,"OK, just so I can get this out of the way at the top, I had no idea who Gillian Anderson was before this series (though she looks familiar, but what actress doesn't?) but this woman has the most intense beautiful blue eyes with very sharp black pupils. I found myself missing dialog because I was focusing on her eyes, lol. There, I got it out of the way.

I've been watching a lot of Brit & Irish-based mystery series lately and this is probably the best of the lot. Yes, the premise is a bit contrived--a superintendent is brought in to help solve a murder and she decides that it's the work of a serial killer, blah, blah, blah. It's kind of obvious to the viewer that this is the work of a serial killer since you actually witness a lot of the crimes happening. That's a kind of odd twist in itself that you might think would dilute the tensions, but actually it has the strange effect of increasing the drama because you can see the paths of characters interchanging and getting closer to one another, but the other characters don't know this is happening. You almost want to shout things to the screen once in a while because you already know what is going on. It's fun.

Also, there is the traditional and predictable tension between Anderson's character and both her superiors and subordinates, all of this is somewhat trite and trodden ground, yes. And also the first episode drags quite a bit, much more so than the remaining episodes, by the way. But if you suspend annoyance (at the contrived aspects) and if you put up with the slow start, the series is quite engrossing--and I really mean that. You do come to like (most of) Anderson's character, you (predictably) dislike her superiors (and feel pity for their ignorance) and you are wondering what the evil protagonist will do next (and if he isn't some type of red herring....ahhh, the mystery of that). There are some things I despise about some of the writing (Anderson's character has a bit of a mildly slutty side to her) and, being a writer myself, I wish I could have doctored the scripts a bit, but so be it. I was entertained, the mystery is maintained, the Belfast setting is great (but if it's Belfast, why didn't they get Van Morrison to write a soundtrack? A gross oversight, I think) and there are those laser blue eyes.

The crimes in this series are, by the way, vile and graphic, but that's fine with me, it's all pretend isn't it. There are also a lot of fine naked bodies--tragically, most of them are dead.

A good mystery series for a winter weekend (which is when I enjoyed it) but please, let's get the next season ready--there are some unresolved issues.

By the way, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, which is the purpose of having pubic reviews, but I'm kind of at a loss when I see the one-star reviews for this. Even it it's not my favorite mystery series, it's still very well done. You will watch it more than once if you watch it at all.",1388880000,,2944,4.4646840148698885

5860989,4,B00DW5IKN4,"This is a dialogue driven crime/serial killer drama that starts slow in the first episode but picks up speed in the next four episodes. The picture and sound quality of the dvd was fine. Like most television dramas the ending left plenty of questions in order for people to watch the next season's episodes which regrettably  may not be available for a while. I enjoyed the series and dvd.

Gillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan drive the series. They are outwardly, in many ways, the opposite of what you would expected them to be.

Anderson is a female detective who Is convinced that there is a serial killer on the lose. Her character is  cold, calculating, tough, and driven. She is not interested in having a relationship or family but picks a male detective to spend the night with based on his looks.

Dornan is a serial killer who is a grief counselor and a family man with a wife and two children. Outwardly, his character seems to care about his family and comes across as a warm, caring family man. His character shows characteristics, as the series progresses, that indicate who he really is as does Anderson's character.

This is very much dialogue driven. I loved the dialogue and the development of the two main characters.  While there is violence it is not as much as I would have expected in a series about a serial killer.

The series is only six episodes.  The ending leaves some big questions. The problem is, according to a number of sources on the web, the next season is not set to start production until January of February 2014. Since this appeared on the BBC I think it could be a while for the next season to become available to American viewers.

Lately it seems like a number of series will take six to 10 months, and on some occasions more than a year, between seasons. I don't appreciate that and it makes me think less of those who create the series.

The picture and sound quality of the dvd is very good. There is a short feature about the making of the series that is just okay.

I will be on the look out for the next season of this series and will watch it. Yet, if for some reason season two never makes it to American television I won't be overly upset. This is a good series that given time to develop could be great but I am not counting the months until season two begins.",1388793600,,2312,4.42688679245283

5860993,5,B00DW5IKN4,"This part one series of The Fall is mesmerizing and if anything, it leaves you wanting more and more. The point of view is mainly from the killer: a complex and chilling man with a wife and two adorable children. We have no clue as to how or why this man stalks & kills his victims. I doubt that, as in real life, either does he. His complexity is extraordinary, just as Gillean Anderson's character's is. He isn't a one-sided evil man that is wrapped up in a tidy package for us to immediately hate. His layers are complex and chilling. In a way, this makes him much more terrifying. Anderson's character, as the inspector, is also perplexing. I'm always delighted by the way English screenwriters are so superior in their dramatization of characters. They don't insult the audience's intellect with stock, insipid story lines and boring car chases that have been overly done in Hollywood. I was surprised when I found out that Dornan was the same actor that played Capola's Swedish lieutenant in the Marie Antoinette movie. Dornan is an
incredible actor if he can change so dramatically. In Marie Antoinette, he plays a handsome Swedish lieutenant that seduces Marie Antionette. He's all charm and boyishness. In The Fall, he's a disturbed serial killer with an intensity that shows in his eyes, in his furrowed brows and sick energy, in the way he walks and talks. It's really quite
impressive acting. For those who found this series boring, I suggest you stick to Hollywood car chases and Vegas hangovers. I can't wait for the second series. And I thank the BBC for respecting their audience's intellect.",1388534400,,1608,4.787769784172662

5860995,4,B00DW5IKN4,"This review is written from the desk of an X-Phile. I won't lie, initially the only thing which drew me into watching this DVD set was Gillian Anderson's face on the cover. As I watched ""The Fall"", however, I found myself fascinated by (and also deeply disturbed by) Jamie Dornon's character. Hopefully my review will explain how that happened.

THE SHOW:

In our game of cat and mouse, we have Stella Gibson (played by Gillian Anderson), a detective superintendent called in from London to review some killings in Belfast. Her opponent is Paul Spector (played by Jamie Dornon), a bereavement counselor by day and serial killer by night.

It did take me a while to get used to watching this show - I usually watch network TV shows which give me about 42-45 minutes per episode, and those have buildups to commercial breaks. However, each episode of The Fall clocks in at an average of 58 minutes, and I found myself glued to the screen to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Gillian Anderson did a great job in her portrayal of Stella Gibson. She lives alone and only seems interested in working the case from the get-go. She doesn't make many lasting connections with people, professionally or personally. She has a ""Sweet Night"" with another character, and it's devoid of any emotional connection. Gibson works the case as clinically and coldly as possible, in front of her computer with a glass of wine and lots of silence. To this effect, she doesn't show the same type of focus on the crimes or the killer as Will Graham did in the TV show Hannibal. It seems her life has no meaning without a monster to chase.

As the series went on, I found that Jamie Dornon absolutely stole the show as Paul Spector. From the first episode we see the depths of his depravity - he sneaks into a woman's house, smells her underwear, takes pictures, and even calmly eats an orange right before his intended victim returns home. As he returns to his house, we see the flip side of his personality as he comforts his young son and tucks him back into bed before returning to his own bedroom and the comfort of his wife. His ability to play the roles of counselor and killer so convincingly made his crimes all the more disturbing and unsettling to watch.

The music was minimal throughout each episode, usually coming in whenever Paul Spector was hunting his next victim or whenever Stella Gibson was working the case files. This seemed to reflect the emptiness in each of their lives, which couldn't be filled by their individual actions.

I found the most powerful moments in this crime drama were the subtle points which usually get overlooked in American-produced shows. For example, in one crime scene the medical examiners mentioned being surprised at the lack of bodily fluids around the corpse of a strangled woman, expecting more mess. They came to the realization that the killer bathed his victim and cleaned the bedding. These types of dialogue can end up on the cutting room floor in shows like CSI or Hannibal, but their inclusion gave strength to this show.

There were a few plotlines that felt too rushed or never got resolved, but since this is only season one, I can't determine if they're simply hanging threads to get resolved in the season(s) to come. I'll have to wait and see.

DVD EXTRAS:

""The Fall - Behind the Scenes"" is a 12 minute featurette on disc 2 with segments from Julian Stevens (Producer), Gillian Anderson, Jakob Verbruggen (Director), Jamie Dornan, Pamela Smith (Makeup & Hair Designer), and Tom McCullough (Production Designer). They talk about the show, the characters, the production crew, and shooting the show in Belfast which serves to break images of The Troubles from years past.

All episodes and the featurette are close-captioned.

FINAL THOUGHTS:

This season, though far too brief with only 5 episodes, was able to capture my interests. I found myself completely absorbed by Jamie Dornan's portrayal of Paul Spector. One minute I would be repulsed by his actions and his apparent disconnection from morals, and in the next segment he'd be watching his daughter performing a cute dance routine or kissing his son's teddy bear good night and I'd think ""Oh, that's so sweet...wait, what's the matter with me?!?""

For me, ""The Fall"" represented the journey from one end of my comfort zone to the other, and back again. I'm looking forward to season two.

5860996,5,B00DW5IKN4,"Gillian Anderson is fascinating as Stella Gibson, a detective inspector brought in to hunt down a serial killer, pitting her own investigative skills against a murderer with hunting and stalking skills of his own. Gibson is simply one of the best female characters seen on television, period. It's difficult to talk too much about this series without giving far too much away, but know that this is a tense psychological thriller, genuinely frightening at times, with a conclusion that may not satisfy those looking for a strong, solid ending. It's provocative and wonderful, a five-part series I would highly recommend to anyone interested in crime dramas and thrillers of a more mature nature.",1388534400,,695,5.15929203539823
5860997,4,B00DW5IKN4,"The Brits are so polite they insist on calling a serial killer a ""serial offender,"" as if the miscreant's most heinous crime is that he persistently takes lunch money. But don't let our brethren across the pond mislead you with their understated ways. Detective Superintendent Stella Gibson of the Metropolitan Police, for one, may be a cold fish but, damn, she's an enigmatic, fiercely independent, utterly capable investigative officer. Gillian Anderson's performance renders Gibson a fascinating, beguiling character.

But we'd caught a glimpse of Gillian Anderson's powerful talent before in prestigious British projects such as Great Expectations and Bleak House. She's established her creds. The Fall's secret weapon is Jamie Dornan, him what plays her opposing lead. The Fall makes no bones of presenting the identity of its big bad from jump. It's Paul Spector (Dornan), him what's a considerate husband and a doting father, a grievance counselor by day, a brutal ""serial offender"" by night. Spector is a freak and a fetishist, and a compelling one. High marks to Dornan (and, I guess, the writers) for attributing a dichotomous complexity to his character.

Det. Superintendent Gibson is dispatched to Belfast to review a stalled investigation of a murdered woman. Only, in surveying the case, Gibson comes to suspect a cunning and meticulous serial killer, excuse me, serial offender may be at work. It's not too long before another young professional woman surfaces, brutalized and strangled and artistically posed.

The Fall runs five episodes, is a slow burn police procedural, is a disturbing psychological thriller. You've got to have patience with the show. The pace is leisurely. Time is taken to develop the moody atmosphere and the character beats. We observe the maniac and the detective as they go about their respective hunts; the camera alternates between their two arcs. It examines the human appepites, the appetite for predation and ultimate control and sexual conquest (and are you even sure I'm talking about Spector?). I love that we're all invited to crawl into the minds of an unexpected sociopath and an unconventional woman grappling with her own inner demons and urges. Comparisons have been drawn between Gibson and Prime Suspect's icy, calculating Jane Tennison, and Anderson in an interview has admitted that the parallels were intentional. As with Tennison, Gibson is fiercely her own woman, a tough, ambitious professional who doesn't sacrifice a smidge of her femininity. Don't tell her to lay off her ""sweet nights.""

The Fall isn't a whodunit as much as it is a whatdunit or whydunit or whenwilltheycrosspathsdunit. Me, I couldn't wait for Gibson and Spector to interact. Know that the tease goes on until the final, fifth episode. That their showdown was going to be good was never in doubt. It in fact makes me wish they'd engaged so much sooner. Know, too, that the ending doesn't go down that beaten path. I thought it a nice swerve. You may not.

Belfast, with its local color and social demarcations and its hard men and pockets of sectarianism, helps to glue the narrative down. The city of Belfast is shot so vividly, it becomes a secondary character in its own right. Water cooler talk is that The Fall has been renewed for a second series, but I wonder if they'll pick up on those several dangling threads. I wonder if we'll see these same minor characters that flesh out the story so well. Particularly, I hope to see more of Archie Panjabi's magnetic pathologist, Niamh McGrady's sensible Ferrington, and John Lynch's conflicted Jim Burns. As well, I long for more of the marvelous Bronagh Waugh, but she plays the killer's wife, so I dunno...

Anyway, The Fall deserves a seat at the table with other superb, character-driven crime dramas like Prime Suspect and Luther. I'm very much looking forward to The Fall, Series 2. I hope Gillian Anderson can juggle this show and her supporting roles in Hannibal and the upcoming NBC hostage drama, Crisis. That's a lot of back and forthing across the pond.

I'm usually so-so on BBC dramas, but this one hooked me in.  Having a familiar face at the forefront didn't hurt, but the unraveling of this serial killer vs the investigator.  Not really a mystery of who, that's shown, but more of a split story to show both sides of a tense showdown.  I'd recommend this definitely to fans of BBC dramas, but also fans of any crime thrillers.  Gillian Anderson, she's just the right bonus to make it a 5 Star!",1388448000,,602,4.467889908256881

Granted, it was a bit slow in some places, but I think that can be expected in any type of episodic series.  But for the most part, the atmosphere of the show is dark and tense and while watching, I kept wondering what would happen next.  Usually I was surprised.

The only downside is that it is only the first season, and I have to wait to watch the next.  (Which is why I prefer to get all of a series show at one time.)

5861003,2,B00DW5IKN4,"In general, I enjoy British dramas, and the great critical reviews ""The Fall"" has received made me want to watch it. Now, I wish I'd used my time in a different way.

The good:
*The acting is top-notch. Gillian Anderson (a police detective) and Jamie Dornan (the serial killer) are both magnificent in their roles.
*The main plot--Anderson trying to unmask the serial killer and Dornan plotting his next move--is gripping. The plot moves along slowly (as is the case in many British dramas), but it does keep moving.

The bad:
*While I expected ""The Fall"" to be dark and disturbing, I did not anticipate just how dark and disturbing it would be. There is graphic, bloody violence as well as graphic sexuality--both of which caused me to turn my head or fast forward through scenes.
*""The Fall"" contains a subplot involving police officers, drugs, and the husband of one of Dornan's first victims that I never quite followed. I'm not sure how it was supposed to connect to the main plot, and I found it to be quite boring.

The ""ending"" is pretty open-ended, leaving the door open for more. But I am certain that I won't be one of the viewers tuning in for series two.",1388102400,9,1167,4.600961538461538
5861004,4,B00DW5IKN4,"This is a fascinating series which reminded me of Prime Suspect. I like Gillian Anderson but she's not Helen Mirren so I couldn't give it five stars. The entire ""season"" is one continuing story focused on one crime rather than a series of different crimes. This gives the writers and actors a chance to really develop the characters. It was quite interesting to see events through the eyes of the criminal at times - a little scary, too. He seemed so normal and even had a wife and children. This isn't a spoiler as it's not a who-done-it but a psychological drama pitting the serial killer against the police. Interestingly enough, the lead detective is the one who seems to have a life that's unbalanced rather than the criminal.
If you like BBC crime series, you'll like this one. It's not mild like Miss Marple or Poirot but more like Prime Suspect or Wire in the Blood (still a favorite of mine) with a little bit of Criminal Minds (US series) thrown in.",1388016000,,959,4.5491329479768785

Game on.

Aficionados of CBS TV may already think they've seen this a hundred times before. They have, but not like this. With clever direction and editing, a brilliant cast (in addition to the two stars I especially liked Ms. Archie Panjabi as the medical examiner and John Burns as the head honcho of the Belfast police), the show tries to paint a realistic portrayal of crime-solving, and it requires close attention on the part of the viewer lest clues be missed.

But Anderson's Gibson is the real revelation. Now 45 she plays a woman virtually without empathy, and she's probably as much of a sociopath as the killer she's seeking. She's cold, haughty, impatient, and somewhat of a feminist--but a feminist who knows that its best to worship ""the god of  things as they are."" Scully has grown up, and magnificently so.

5861006,5,B00DW5IKN4,"I am used to watching mindless entertainment which means that I can watch and do something else at the same time.  Absolutely not possible with this series, in fact I watched the first one twice.

Stella (Gillian Anderson) is called in to investigate a murder, but realizes that it is part of a serial murder.  Jamie Dornan as Paul Spector, is a grief counselor, but also the killer.  Throw in Archie Panjabi as the pathologist and the acting is well worth watching.  Stella brings her own serious emotional problems to the job, one of which is a previous affair with the Assistant Chief who called for her to come investigate.  He is also involved with investigating a dirty cop affair and the question is how much is he involved.
There are only five episodes on this DVD, but I did read that the series has been picked up and will return.  If you want the mystery neatly tied up with a big bow, then this is not for you.  I think this is much more realistic.  What happens is left to the imagination, you are participating in the series in a way.

I'm not writing any spoilers because this is the type of series that lets you know right away who the culprit is.  The suspense comes in the authorities trying to catch him.  Gillian Anderson of X-files fame plays the detective.  She's kind of aloof and to the consternation of some of the males she encounters, she has casual affairs and moves on without emotional attachments.  But she's good at her job.  Archie Panjabi portrays the coroner who helps Gillian Anderson's character come up with the profile of the serial killer.

Jaimie Dornan of Once Upon a Time plays the serial killer. He is a loving father and husband by day. A grief counselor by occupation and a sadistic icy killer by night. His performance is riveting.

Gillian Anderson was excellent in her role.  She is a beast of a detective and of a woman. She takes no prisoners and goes after what she wants personally. She seems to be just as dark a character in her own right as Jamie Dornan's character (a serial killer). The first episode starts somewhat slowly, but I suppose it's necessary to build the foundation. Then it moves along okay. There seems to be two separate stories going on here.

5861016,4,B00DW5IKN4,"A slow burning thriller, ""The Fall"" is primarily a character driven series focusing on the pursuit of a serial killer who stalks his victims by breaking in to their homes and leaving behind ""warning"" signs to increase the thrill and cool, detached detective Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson) assigned to the case. Gibson enjoys casual sex (often with married men) and often ""stalks"" those that she chooses as one night stand partners based on a whim acting very much as a mirror for the killer (Jamie Dornan) who works as a grief counselor feeding off the tragedies of others.

I should warn viewers that this ends on a cliffhanger which will resolved with the second series. Those into a more conventional narrative and conclusion may be disappointed.

While starting off as fairly conventional, the series begins to take some interesting and unexpected turns for those patient enough to stay with the series past the first episode. A well written and directed series, ""The Fall"" takes its cue from well structured novels gradually connecting these two telling the parallel stories that eventually intersect against the tragic and violent background of Northern Ireland.

Anderson gives a subtle, well controlled and nuanced performance and enjoys strong support from a mixture of British and Irish acting veterans including ""The Good Wife"" actress Archie Panjabi. Dornan provides a nice contrast as a killer who masquerades as someone who helps others through their grief while also maintaining the facade of a loving family man with two of his own children.

The gritty, dark presentation (the show was shot digitally) compliments the atmosphere of the series and the Dolby 5.1 mix is subtle through out (if you watch this streaming it is presented with a nice sounding stereo mix as well).

The special feature for the DVD from Acorn Entertainment is, as with most of their releases, limited to a single featurette. This one runs about 12 minutes. It would have been nice to have a commentary track from Anderson, Dornan or the series creator/writer/producer Allan Cubitt (who wrote the second s dries for ""Prime Suspect"").

Although it takes a little while for ""The Fall"" to find its footing, once the series does midway through the second episode, the series rarely stumbles and will provide those willing to stock with this 5 episode series with a fascinating experience.",1386460800,2,2377,5.082051282051282
5861018,2,B00DW5IKN4,"I don't know why this series gets touted unless a beautiful woman who knows a lot about serial killers and likes to have sex cold, without regard to the heart or how it affects her targets' lives is interesting. She, herself, is written as cold, and we don't see who or what she cares about except catching the killer. We know nothing about her life or how she got the way she is. She doesn't really turn out to be interesting.

The killer, whom we watch almost from the start, is noticed actually the brilliant 'entry into the mind of a serial killer' he is described as being. If he has 'multiple personality disorder' we don't see his switching from one alter ego to another. We don't see the cold hate it would take to murder woman after woman. The women bear resemblances to each other but some insight into who they represent to him would have been nice. This is no psychological thriller. We don't understand these people. I don't know how to describe my inability to describe the character of the killer and how, somehow, wrong he seems to be; how not up to serial killer-ness he is written or directed. In his work as a grief counselor he seems to do adequately well, although he draws breasts on a drawing of the woman instead of notes during one couples' session; which makes us worry for her life but which turns out to be a red herring. Again, when he takes care of his children and puts them to bed we are a bit chilled as we wonder how much danger they are in.
We don't see his needs, what triggers his need to kill again. Again, we don't see 'inside his mind'.
At the end it appears, suddenly, that the woman outside consultant and the killer have been in a conscious, personal contest with each other, evidenced by something she says on the phone to him just before the end. This is lifted from some other, much older thrillers and doesn't work, as she divulges too much, it seems almost unprofessionally out of character for her and it is thought of too late.
There is an intertwining crime subplot which I didn't understand, can't begin to explain and don't know why it was in there. I found it extraneous and completely unmemorable.",1386374400,5,2152,4.4481012658227845

There's little originality here -  the lady police officer tracking down a serial killer is a familiar situation to anyone who saw the Helen Mirren series ""Prime Suspect.""  Some character twists spice up the proceedings.  The lady police inspector (Gillian Anderson doing her withdrawn Ice Maiden act) enjoys steamy one-night stands with strangers, and the serial killer is the devastatingly attractive Jamie Dornan, a devoted husband and father who has some very disturbing scenes with his wife and small daughter on the home front.

Series 1 leaves you hanging in the middle of it, just like ""The Killing - who Killed Rosie Larson"", which by the way was far more suspenseful and interesting than ""The Fall"". (and much better acted). The program is just not good enough to follow.

As for Gillian Anderson, I found her acting flat, boring, and uninteresting, and I was unable to connect with the character.  Anyone who saw Helen Mirren in ""Prime Suspect"" knows what great acting is. Anyone who has seen ""Luther"" (the great Idris Elba) knows what great acting is too.

Stella has no home life, no sense of humor- not even a cat...She treats men like objects much like our serial killer dresses up his female victims.  At least the killer goes home at night and tucks his children into bed...Stella does nothing to show us that she is human.  Like other reviewers, I had trouble getting around Gillian Anderson's inconsistent English accent.  What this series needs is a complimentary character to Gibson to balance the darkness of her personality.  A 'Watson to her Holmes"" if you will.  We also need a reason to find Gibson as our hero and not just another sad stereotype that women in law enforcement have to be ""wooden"" emotionally to cope with the job.",1384041600,4,987,4.664739884393064

5861028,4,B00DW5IKN4,"Last things first: this nicely watchable five-episode show has at least three main plot threads, and more than ten minor ones, and not a single, solitary one of them is tied up. That's annoying. Some people say it's like real life, and therefore they don't mind. More power to them. I'm always glad when people are happy. But I myself think of a crime drama, especially a serial killer crime drama, as artificial, as artificial as a limerick, and to me this five-hour show was like a limerick without its last two lines.

Spoilers follow, fans, but since the show won't even begin to be over till the second season ends, sometime in May 2014 from what I hear, at worst I'm spoiling only the first half of the drama.

1. In the last episode, the serial killer phones the investigating cop and tells her he'll quit and she'll never catch him. We're not supposed to believe him, but that's more of an ending than the other plot threads get.

2. The heroine's boss is protecting a whole gang of lowlifes, because though he's a high-level police official he's under the thumb of some politician, whose son is in the gang. Not one character from this lowlife gang is caught, except for a police officer who got involved with it. Very few of them are even brought in and charged. Yet they occupied more than an hour of screen-time. How are they relevant to the serial-killer theme? That isn't discussed either.

3. The serial killer is an ordinary family man -- and a hard-driving versatile one at that. He does such good work at his job that his co-workers resent and undermine him, and the fact that he's a serial killer in no way impairs his ability to tell his bosses off when they pull petty regulation reprimands on him. But what will happen to his family if he's caught? How will his wife react? How will his daughter, already apparently emotionally damaged and unconsciously suspicious of her own father, get over seeing what he is? Answer: the family just barely begins to show some of the stress and wham! the season is over.

I couldn't begin to cover all the smaller problems that are left stranded. A policeman is shot seven times in the back and three times in the head. We never find out who killed him, let alone see that person brought to justice. The serial killer gets off on torturing thirty-something career women, but that doesn't stop him from getting highly involved with a sexually precocious fifteen-year-old babysitter. What happens to her from all this? Again, we don't find out.

You can't help envying that serial killer, though. His wife wants him; his babysitter wants him; he has such strong effect on a grieving couple he's counseling that the husband threatens to kill him and the wife obeys his every command. He's incredibly strong from constant exercising, including jogging and chin-ups. And his serial killing hobby shows he's not only a good researcher and stalker, but also gifted at sketching and novel-writing (he produces accounts of his crimes illustrated by photographs and drawings). He's billed as ""an ordinary guy,"" but he's obviously the Leonardo da Vinci of serial killers. Did I mention that he quotes Nietzsche? But maybe you already guessed that.

Meanwhile top cop Gillian Anderson comes up with clich after clich about serial killers, things like, ""It's the power that he likes!"" She utters these clichs as if she is slowly, laboriously working them out right there in front of us, though she could hardly have reached her present high rank in the police if she hadn't known them for years. She's even more impressive than the serial killer. She can pick up any man she wants in a second, but it turns out that after a man has had one sweet night with her, he's obsessed with her forever. She doesn't know that (she just knows it's easy for her to pick up men), so she's utterly ruthless. One of her ex-lovers says to her, ""I would have left my wife for you. My children."" She stares at him blankly.

Oh, and why then didn't the guy leave his wife and children for her? Not explained. Perhaps she was so uninterested in him even a ruined sex-slave could see it. Perhaps he would have had to give up his golf games too, and that was too much for him. Just one more dropped plot thread.

The show is a lot of fun to watch, though deliberately slow-paced. It helps to think of it as the first five hours of a ten-hour drama but who knows? Maybe the sequel won't end anything either. Maybe it's always going to be just like life, and you can stop watching it and look out the window instead.",1383868800,8,4537,4.591358024691358

I also had the hardest time getting past Anderson's half-baked accent. It was unrecognizable when it was detected. I began to focus entirely on listening to see when she'd use it and when not. For me, it was too distracting.

Seriously. Come on. She's a some special investigator from somewhere else whose brought in specifically to review a murder case and it. Her first day there, at a crime scene, she comes up to one of the men and says ""I'm at Hotel so-and-so and I'm in Room 123"". So, he shows up later and they have sex.  Such believability. Not.

5861030,4,B00DW5IKN4,"Save for Jack the Ripper, the serial killer phenomenon is comparatively new to us and it continues to fascinate us. It's a central theme to any number of movies and TV series'. There are a wide variety of approaches to it and this is one of the better and more unique entries into the genre.

Here's the scoop. Stella Gibson (Gillian Anderson) is brought in to help solve a murder case in Belfast. She sees a link to an earlier murder which no one else wants to make. When a third murder occurs she's convinced they're dealing with a serial killer. She forms a task force and uses her smarts to try and find the killer.

This is a very smart and subtle approach to the genre. It's not overwrought or another exercise in histrionics. It's clever and quiet (maybe too quiet for American sensibilities). You get an in depth look into the killer's world, and they don't dump his entire back story on you at one time. You get little bits and pieces of it throughout all five episodes. It shows up in almost unnoticeable ways. Look at the women he kills and then look at his wife. Likewise with Anderson's Gibson. She is the other side of the same coin. She's well educated, as is he, and needs to exert control over those around her, as does he. She's a female professional in a man's world. She's pretty and dresses in subtly, sexy clothing. It keeps the men around her off balance. There is good use of leitmotif. You really need to keep your eyeballs pealed to catch some of the nuance. There are some side plots that have there own story but dovetail, softly, into the main plot.

These are the first five episodes. Some complain that it doesn't really end. If they decide to continue the series there are plenty of  places for the story/stories to go. If they don't continue the series that's okay too because life doesn't always tell a story that gets wrapped up in a neat little package.

5861031,5,B00DW5IKN4,"I watched this a couple of months ago on Netflix and enjoyed it so much, I wanted to own it. Jamie Dornan, the series' other ""lead"" after Gillian Anderson, is getting a lot of press now as the replacement for Charlie Hunnam in the adaptation of that Shades of Grey movie (and good luck to Jamie if it helps his career continue to grow, although I honestly suspect that he's a whole lot more talented than that movie will deserve). This may have been conceived as a star vehicle for Gillian Anderson and it certainly is that - the character she plays is wonderfully layered and hard to get a handle on. She's neither entirely likable or unlikable, just enjoyably complicated without ever being written or played in a way that made me feel like they were trying too hard to make her interesting, off-putting, or anti-heroic. You could believe her character is a real person working in Belfast somewhere on horrible murders. But Jamie Dornan just hits it out of the park with his performance, playing one of the most interesting serial killers I've ever seen written for the screen. Dornan's performance is absolutely CHILLING. Several of my friends and family found the show to be a lot more disturbing than what they were prepared for, not because it's particularly graphic or gory - it isn't - but because the character that Dornan plays makes you wonder if you really know anyone that you know. Some fictional serial killers are written to be charming or marvelously good at deception (the obvious examples that come to mind are Hannibal Lecter, especially as played by Mads Mikkelsen in the new series, which incidentally cast Anderson in a terrific recurring role; or Dexter Morgan) but I'm not sure I've ever seen a serial killer written to be a regular, average guy in every way... except for the part where he feels a compulsion to stalk and kill women. Yikes. I understand the series has been picked for a second series order. I hope Anderson's role in a new U.S. series for NBC doesn't prevent her filming that second series because her character could take a place right next to Helen Mirren's Jane Tennyson at this rate. And if you don't already believe that Anderson could read you the phonebook and make it fascinating and compelling based on her work over the past 20 years in The X-Files and movies like House of Mirth, you will after seeing her in this show.",1383264000,2,2373,4.665871121718377

5861034,5,B00DW5IKN4,"The Fall is without doubt the most compelling and realistic depiction of a serial killer I've seen. Kudos to the whole ensemble, no less to Gillian Anderson as the obsessed cop, Jamie Dornan, whose serial killer as new age man is hauntingly plausible. One standout scene, and there are many, is the one in which the husband of one of Dornan's clients (a man who may well also have killed - in the cause of tribal rivalry) confronts Dornan in an elevator, the man may be a murderer, but is far more guileless than the man he faces.
Belfast's sectarian tensions and political power struggles add to the general feeling of malaise. Television drama doesn't get darker, or better than this.",1380585600,2,686,4.677685950413223
5861035,4,B00DW5IKN4,"Creepy builds into ghastly and psycho-gothic.
4  stars.
THE FALL is called a mystery, but comes across dark and a thriller. It's a unique method of presenting a crime investigation. Music and cop's expressions while murders are contemplated are as eerie as the stalking sequences. So darkly drama there is no characters to empathize with--not even the cops. Not rated but consider it PG-18 to R and expect your own nightmares.

SUBTITLES available for all 5 full-hour episodes.
1--Murder of a Belfast female architect is unsolved, thus getting DS Stella Gi9bson (Gillian Anderson) on the case. Counselor Paul Spector (Jamie Dornan) plans his next attack. Yes, viewers know who-dun-it from the get-go. This series is about the journey and characters involved in the crime and investigation--and how they collide.

2--Victims increase and DS Gibson gets assigned to investigate the similar murder. Serial seems certain. Another gal gets the focused attention of Spector.

3--Gibson's sexual preference for a cop implodes after an assassination. Finally the murders are recognized as serial and Belfast's routine killer plans his next event.

4--One murder victim case begins unraveling names, making some unhappy about discovery and publicity. More tragedy before a killer mistake that offers ""Operation Music Man"" a break. Will it be enough?

5--Grisly murder alters the MO of the resent serial killings. Gibson's steps of inquiry creep nearer to solving and capturing the grim reaper.

Multi-plot series not as yet interrelated. Will the 2nd season do that?
For the dark thriller type of production obviously intended--they sure did excel in repulsive. A stomach churner for sure, but too many loose ends for 5 stars.
Dorman acted so convincingly as a repugnant psychotic that he may be stuck in the role type for life; unless he shaves and bleaches his hair. He did the difficult job of flip-flopping bad man/good man.
Anderson performs her own version of her character's efficient-emotionless-eerie.",1379030400,3,2001,5.333333333333333
5861036,4,B00DW5IKN4,"This is a tense and disturbing series about a Detective Superintendent, Stella Gibson, who works for the Met and is called to Belfast, Ireland to investigate a murder of a young, professional woman.  Early on Stella believes it may be the work of a serial murderer and is soon proven right.

Simultaneously, we meet the villain, who lives a double life and seems an unlikely candidate to perpetrate these murders.  So, it's a bit cat and mouse as Stella begins to identify just what kind of individual is doing these crimes and why, drawing nearer to the killer.

The acting is subdued and deep.  There's a menacing atmosphere pervading.  For my own taste, I prefer less violent and graphic crimes.  However, the series was so well-done and the acting riveting by Gillian Anderson as Stella that I couldn't not watch.  The plot and denouement is original and I will sample the next installment in the series.  5 stars if you are okay with the violence and some nudity.  I like cerebral mysteries with less violence, but with the same quality of acting and originality of plot.  Enjoyed the Belfast backdrop.",1378252800,59,1107,4.773684210526316
5861037,5,B00DW5IKN4,"This series (miniseries?) is very dark, very intense, and amazingly well-done.  Gillian Anderson, as the take-no-crap English police investigator tracking a sadistic killer, is showcased in some of the best work of her career.  The sub-plots and supporting characters are all very good, and add to the tense atmosphere and political intrigue of an English officer working in Ireland.  The series is realistically written and filmed, causing a kind of dilemma: the story is riveting and horrifying at the same time.  Viewers watch both the killer and police at work, wondering who will triumph.",1378080000,6,593,5.276595744680851

After five minutes, it was enough: the opening scene was of a female supervisor having sex with a detective she had literally just met--and today, if this super were male, he would have been rightly accused of sexual harassment in the workplace.
