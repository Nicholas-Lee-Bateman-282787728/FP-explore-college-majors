8500978,5,B006MK17EU,Also very interesting. Hope it will help to enlarge my guitar playing styles.,1517788800,,77,5.0
8500979,5,B006MK17EU,"I had no idea what I was missing. Clawhammer guitar sounds great. Authentic sound from the hills-and rather straight forward to learn for finger pickers. Mr. Baughman does a great job presenting the technique, playing examples both fast and slow.",1510876800,,246,5.175
8500980,5,B006MK17EU,"Really a good intro-intermediate DVD discussing this idea.  An original tune is taught as part of the material.  This song is simple enough to get started, but does develop into a more skilled piece. It's a really good learning device.  The video is good and the audio is clear.",1501372800,,278,4.63265306122449
8500981,5,B006MK17EU,"I've been playing guitar over forty years.  I went to Berklee School of Music (before it was ""College"").  I am a busy lawyer, and I play rock, jazz, blues, and as of the past several years a great deal of 'roots americana', ie bluegrass and old time and the folk songs I grew up with.

I have been playing in a few open tunings all my guitar life, and have recently been exploring these in much greater depth.

So here's the short and sweet:
you will learn several open tunings,

you will learn not only claw hammer, but variations such as drop thumb and tapping. Chances are, you may not know these techniques, and they add a great deal to breadth of ones' playing style. One of my all time favorite guitarists, Bert Jansch, used this style on occasion in his recordings.
you will learn some rather straight forward arrangements of familiar tunes, and, all taught in a superb manner.

Steve builds slowly, starting with the most basic technique and practice to show you how to master each step.  His teaching style is upbeat, easy to understand and follow and the videography is great.  Its easy to see what is being done, and, he tells you how to do it.  He has a very pleasant and engaging personality, is humble, articulate and masterful.

Lessons are short, digestible and cumulative. And, they are easily accessed from the menu/index.

IMHO This is the best type of instructional video lesson, because one can sit down with it, take 20 minutes to watch, imitate, watch again, and wait a day or so to take up the next section.

For those that don't know exactly what claw hammer is, it is in essence, a percussive rhythmic style of 'strumming' the guitar or banjo (its most common application would be 'old time' or Appalachian style banjo), using a specific technique of thumb and relaxed , semi-closed hand.  It produces a distinct and interesting sound. This is especially so on guitar, imho, as the overall sound is more 'sophisticated' or refined compared to the banjo.

I highly recommend this video.  It is great to learn a unique style, and be able to do so through this superb communicator and player.  Well worth its price and your time.",1430179200,3,2152,4.623684210526315
8500982,5,B006MK17EU,Arrived timely. Different style of playing that takes getting used to. Instructions are done well.,1408579200,,98,5.6
8500983,5,B006MK17EU,Excellent!,1404777600,,10,10.0
8500984,5,B006MK17EU,"Steve's a great instructor and I enjoy the honesty and grit of this banjo technique applied to guitar.  I'm only a hack, but find myself being able to approximate this technique with only a little diligence.  Once small nit:  I wish the tab on the inside the jacket also contained the supplementary licks Steve demonstrates -- like Shady Grove Grove B part.  But that's not too hard to figure out from watching the video.",1393632000,,421,4.648648648648648
8500985,5,B006MK17EU,"Hello, my name is James and I'm a Travis picking addict. Luckily, I've admitted that I have a problem, and part of my rehab includes Steve Baughman's ""The Power of Claw."" This is an excellent instructional DVD that has presented me with rhythmic possibilities I would not have imagined had I stayed in alternating bass purgatory. It will also force you to improve your left hand technique, particularly hammer-ons and pull-offs. I've wanted to develop a style that combines Celtic and twang, but something was missing, and I think it was clawhammer. I'm also a player who's never felt comfortable with a pick, so I'm always on the lookout for alternatives to using a pick that would create a similar driving type of sound. Clawhammer gives you that. Steve's instruction is detailed and well thought out, and his screen presence is very watchable. Plus, I could listen to him play all day.",1377475200,7,888,4.848684210526316
8500986,5,B006MK17EU,"Steve is a great teacher of this Clawhammer method and its variations. In each ""Lay Of The Land"" part he says ""..now watch what my left hand is doing...."" with abbreviated chords D or D7 and the camera angle makes it's a little difficult to see his hammer ons and pull offs. Steve is excellent in explaining all of this I will be reviewing these sections a lot. A GREAT instructional DVD! If you are interested in this technique get this video, it's concise and fun to learn. Thank You Steve.",1351296000,4,492,4.417582417582418
8500987,4,B006MK17EU,"Love clawhammer as it is such a powerful technique. You get so much sound out of so little work.

Steve covers the technique very nicely in this DVD but it is certainly not for the novice guitarist. You need to be prepared to play around with the technique and try stuff out yourself to fully understand clawhammer. The only thing I would have liked is slightly more in depth Tabs. Steve plays some variations of the main tunes (eg. Wasilla Weed) that aren't totally covered in the Tabs.",1338595200,4,487,4.534090909090909
