8140434,1,B000HLS1KS,Terrible dvd! Did not keep either of my children interested! These reviews are all written around the same time and all similar in context. Looks like fake reviews to me.,1487894400,,170,4.7
8140435,5,B000HLS1KS,"The DVD is a useful learning tool for kids learning to play on same team in life. Kids can relate to the topics in this series by attaching to themselves, the acceptable social behaviors displayed by each of the four friends. A must view for the classroom, and family gatherings.",1182384000,,279,4.6
8140436,5,B000HLS1KS,"We received this dvd and activity book just in time for babysitting my niece and nephew who are 3 and 6 years old.  They brought some of their own videos with them, but they were excited to see new ones at their Aunties house.  They are really great kids and well behaved, but it is always good to keep reinforcing good behavior in different ways.  It was fun watching them interact with the TV and shouting out times where they didn't pay attention and so on.  They wanted to take the dvd home with them.  I am now going to take it with me to babysit my twin nieces in Arizona who will be 5 yrs. soon.  I know they will love it too.  My son is only 8 mths and it is over his head now, but when he is old enough to understand it, I plan to use this DVD and if there is more in the series to help raise my son to be a polite child.",1158796800,3,830,3.847058823529412
8140437,5,B000HLS1KS,"I received this DVD as a gift from a friend and was thrilled to find that it not only captured all three of my kids imaginations, it actually taught them some important lessons that we try to teach at home.  The four kid characters were diverse, fun and well-developed.  My kids are 8, 10 and 14 months which is a pretty wide spread, but they all watched the whole program with great interest.  The ""playing it forward"" segment initiated a great discussion with our older kids about being kind to others and the chain reaction that can ensue.  All and all, our whole family loved the DVD as entertainment with great values.  Although I think it's suitable for all ages, I would recommend it most highly for kids from about 3-9 yrs.",1157068800,3,731,4.507575757575758
8140438,5,B000HLS1KS,"I bought the dvd/book set as a birthday gift for my girlfriend's son and can't get enough praise from both parents. He loved it and they were very impressed with the content. I scored huge points with this colorful and smart dvd/book set. Its like getting two presents in one. A great gift, that I recommend strongly, as I am now sending it to all of my younger relatives. Enjoy!",1156118400,2,379,4.428571428571429
8140439,5,B000HLS1KS,"I bought this as a gift for my grandchildren!  I began by enjoying this DVD for it's humor, but ended up cherishing it for its wisdom.  It is definitely one to watch and re-watch and lend to family & friends--to everyone who has a child or for that matter has even been a child!",1156118400,2,278,4.12962962962963
8140440,5,B000HLS1KS,"My son is about the age when he just doesn't want to hear what right or wrong from mom and dad anymore. However, if a friend were to tell him it's bad to be rude or that he needs to be polite and wait his turn-- he would listen. That is exactly what the Playdate Kids do. They are a helping hand for parents and they teach your kids what's wrong or right through fun cartoons and stories. I can't wait to buy the next movie in this series. I think it would make a great cartoon series on TV too.",1155772800,2,495,3.910891089108911
8140441,5,B000HLS1KS,"This series gives structure to the play time you already enjoy with your child and teaches them (And You) how to be a reasonable complete person that plays well with others. It gives them an appreciation of and teaches them the virtues that go into making a person of good character. Although the age group will find enough going on here to keep them engrossed, even without parental involvement, I was amused by the fact that I was encouraging qualities sadly absent from my world and that my child would rarely observe in my own life: tolerance, generosity and most of all patience. It scared me when I thought what my example had been teaching. Maybe we could all do with a refresher course.",1155772800,3,694,4.604838709677419
8140442,5,B000HLS1KS,The DVDs are great.  The realism of the interactions between the kids and their peers is perfect.  The whole family can actually enjoy them.,1155686400,2,140,4.791666666666667
