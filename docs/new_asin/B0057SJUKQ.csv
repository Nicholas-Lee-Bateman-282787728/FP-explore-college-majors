4597725,1,B0057SJUKQ,"Sometimes when a very bad movie gets a great review, it's because a friend or relative of someone involved in making the movie wrote it. Sometimes that's obvious just from reading the review, but not always. Having now seen this movie myself, I cannot trust any positive review it gets.

This movie is just terrible. Everything about it is bad: the strident, preposterous screenplay; the harsh, always-on, NEVER-believable acting (if it's fair to real actors to call it that - Michael Joyce and Mandeesh Gill in particular are embarrassingly bad, although Joyce has a bigger role so he sticks out more); the noisy, too-loud and never appropriate music; the interminable fake sex scenes that are always shot from the same weird angle, with the same frenzied, mechanical, totally fake grunts, groans, grimaces and spastic moves - scenes that last ten times as long as they should even if they were good; and the idiotic photography.

The normal way to film a conversation is to film each actor separately and then edit the shots together into a conversation. THIS director or cinematographer sometimes chose instead to swing the camera back and forth between actors: one reads his line, then the camera swings quickly 90 to the other actor, who says his line, then back to the first actor, etc. In at least one scene he does it between THREE actors. It's dizzying, and not in a good way. I've never seen anything like it. Whether it was done to save production time and costs or with some crazed idea that it's a cool way to make a movie, it's a big, BIG mistake.

Every character in this movie would be unbearably obnoxious if they were at all believable; as it was, I just kept hoping against hope that the counter was wrong and there weren't REALLY 53 minutes left, then 52 minutes, and so on. I forced myself to stay with it all the way to the end, but I wouldn't wish such torture even on Dick Cheney. This is the worst movie I've seen in years.",1328054400,16,1948,4.624277456647399
4597726,5,B0057SJUKQ,"All I know is no real answers to Love here, but thought provoking all the same. Really enjoyed the movie as per my five star rating. Not really sure when I read lower starred reviews if it was the plot they objected to, or perhaps the candid look at sex as not having much relationship with LOVE.",1326844800,3,296,4.2105263157894735
4597727,3,B0057SJUKQ,"This is an indie gay themed film from writer and director Carl Medland. It tells the story of Dale, a 28 year old `hustler' and his friends. Dale (Christopher Kelham) has some strange clients who have a number of strange proclivities, which does go some way to breathing humour into the plot. He likes to indulge their fantasies, whether it be nappy wearing or aggressive domestic cleaning. He then does a fair bit of cruising in the evenings. I would be worn out personally speaking.

He has a closeted Asian friend Raj (Valmier Rampersad - who is really good), who announces he is getting married - predictably to a woman. Dale is rather in love with him and takes it none too well. He uses his other friend the drag queen with the alcoholic mum, Sean (played by the late Michael Joyce) as a sounding board of his emotions and does not always like what he hears. As Sean says `if you want to be heard - speak the truth'. Dale also uses his mate Ricardo for extra frison with some of his punters and they seem to have some genuine on screen chemistry, both in and out of bed. There isn't that much in the way of `action' here either, but if you want that, then you should really go for the top shelf stuff and not this more `eye level' fare.

There are more than a few stereotypes here, but I am fine with that, we also have a drag race, which is always fun and masses of eye make up too. There are some production issues, like poor dubbing at the beginning and editing that could have been harsher. But this is an indie effort and it is well shot and the acting is above average, but not award winning by any standard. There are also some plot twists that are a bit hard to swallow - no pun intended, but that is artistic choice.

I liked the music too which is provided by `Cherrystone'. Medland has made a good if not excellent film, and we do need more gay themed films, but this says as much about what is lacking as it does about being a talent showcase. Despite its shortcomings I still found it to be a rather enjoyable watch, I am awarding three stars but it's closer to three and a half; more than worth it for a rental.",1326412800,4,2131,4.25679012345679
4597728,3,B0057SJUKQ,"Fulfilling fantasies ... for a price ... is the profession of Dale, a 28 year old London escort, whose own passions run toward anonymous sex in dangerous situations.  His best friend is Sean, a timid young man who makes his living doing drag, does drugs to face the day, and trades verbal barbs with his alcoholic mother.  Dale also has a secret crush on his ""straight"" friend Raj, who just announced he is getting married (to a woman), which presents Dale with mixed emotions.  The brutal murder of another escort gives everyone a reason to be concerned about Dale, and his friends and family tiptoe around trying to convince him to change his ways.

This is essentially a story about modern-day relationships, with their unique baggage and difficulty to express how you really feel.  The film looks into the relationships and hopes of all three main characters, with occasionally wit but - unfortunately - often unrealistic  melodrama. The characters are the draw here, rather than their stories, and that makes the film seem uneven at times.  I also thought Christopher Kelham was a bit flat in his portrayal of Dale.  Overall, I give it three stars out of five.  DVD has deleted scenes and photo gallery.  Not rated, but would be a heavy R for simulated sexual contact.",1325203200,,1273,4.798165137614679
4597729,5,B0057SJUKQ,"Having seen many gay films over the years I must say The Cost of Love was a pleasant surprise! I foung the story believable between the characters and really enjoyed the way the dinamics of their relationships altered throughout the film keeping up the suspense and drama throughout! I thought the guys were hot and particularly liked the relationship between Sean and his mother Christine which I feel they excecuted really well and provoked emotions of happiness, comedy as well as tragedy. The film has a really dark edge to it and set in London it looks visially great with a good music score! The director Carl Medland is certainly one to watch and I cant wait to see his next film!! Well done guys 10 out of 10!!",1320537600,5,718,4.573643410852713

4597742,5,B0057SJUKQ,"Contrary to some of the reviewers who seem to have more of a problem with the subject matter than they will admit, this movie is well written, well acted and quite captivating. Human characters with personal demons.  Handling life's complexities with humor and false self confidence.  The plot takes some twists and turns and down paths you won't expect.  And as messed up as some of these characters seem, they also inspire with their abilities to survive.  You will enjoy this movie.",1456358400,,485,4.878048780487805

4597766,3,B0057SJUKQ,"The Cost of Love never really explained what the cost of love was supposed to be - SPOILER ALERT - it must be gruesome murder.  What I had read about this indie effort was obviously intriguing enough that I decided to see it, and while I don't feel like I totally wasted 90 precious minutes of life, I do feel a bit short changed.  Whether by design (writing) or presentation (acting), the main character, Dale, never becomes likable and therefore, you never care about him.  Nor do you ever really believe that he cares about anyone other than himself despite the title and one of the main plot drivers which is his apparent hidden love for his friend Raj.  The story relies heavily on worn out melodramatic tropes and hollow sentimentality, but never delivers a substantial return on any investment.  I gave this film 3 stars primarily because I enjoyed Michael Joyce's snippy and yet solid  performance of Sean and I believe Kylie Cobley and Caroline Burns Cooke also did solid turns as Veena and Christine.  Going back to my original sentence and spoiler alert - the final murder and in fact the whole psycho killer subplot seemed to come out of nowhere and was more just tacked on as an after thought to usher forth the denouement, rather than being an actual plot driver of the film.  That, or I guess it was just one last melodramatic screw to try to force us to care about the otherwise unlikeable Dale. I'd say this film is worth seeing for Joyce's over the top drag queen and makeup, but not for much else.  If you want to see a serious drama with redeeming characters, keep looking.",1429142400,3,1593,4.56140350877193

8461142,4,B0057SJUKQ,"Well worth watching.  The story is engaging, thoughtful, fun, amusing, gut-wrenching, timely.  Transparent acting made every character believable.  I would not criticize any actor's performance. Setting, scenes, photography music were very well done.  The music, in particular, was very good at setting the tone throughout the film; but I heard none of it, exactly as a good soundtrack should be.  Some of the plot diversions were carried a bit far, I thought.  The backstory about Sean, for instance, seemed to distract rather than to support the main story.  Although the impending marriage of Raj and Veena was an essential plot element, Veena's problem felt like deus ex machina to me.  The surprising seeming twist near the end had, in retrospect, a good setup:  we had been introduced periodically to several flights of fancy in Dale's imagination.  Overall the movie was enjoyable and worth my time.",1514592000,,906,5.186206896551724
