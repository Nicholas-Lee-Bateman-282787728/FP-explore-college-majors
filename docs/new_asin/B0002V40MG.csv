It covers the fundamentals of shooting home movies and there are chapters on equipment, technique, storage, and different situations you might be in when shooting.  It really helped with our paddling videos in particular since there is a special segment on shooting sports footage.  What I liked best about it is that it doesn't get too technical and keeps the information at a level that I could understand.  I highly recommend this DVD for the new camcorder owner, or for someone who wants to improve their technique when shooting video of their kids or while on vacation.",1094688000,6,733,4.785714285714286
