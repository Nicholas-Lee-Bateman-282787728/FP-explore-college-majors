1778092,2,B00006IUJM,"After watching this for about 15 minutes, I am thinking what is this?  Is it some kind of joke...well, the story is, kind of stupid...you know big robot got stolen by a dude...and robot is destroying the city..then

Gen Y cops come in and try to stop this robot...sometimes, Gen Y cops act funny (because they are stressed out?) and sometimes, they get serious... but don't they know how serious this is??  They probably forget...but can you imagine that a robot is at large and I bet that it takes only few minutes to destroy the entire city...I am not sure whether Gen Y cops can handle it...

Still, the story is a joke...however, the only thing I like about this one is Maggie Q...but I think she is just a supporting cast..kind of disappointed!!..but how come the DVD shows Maggie Q pointing a gun at somebody..??

Who is she pointing at anyway?  Director??  Crews??

Well, if you want to watch it..go ahead and have a good time..I don't think it is that BAD..but it is BAD...by the way, the sound quality is bad..where is the stereo..you know, DVD? 5.1??",1110844800,2,1060,4.542105263157895
1778093,1,B00006IUJM,"There's a lot you can do in an hour and a half - walk your dog, eat a good meal, play a board game - but watching ""Gen Y Cops"" is most definitely NOT a way to pass your time.  Success (of the first ""Gen X Cops"") more often than not spawns bad sequels and this one hits the bottom with a thud.  Fans of the first installment should consider that ""Gen X"" is to its sequel what the original ""Godfather"" is to ""Godfather III,"" times ten.  This time around, things go wrong for our cool cops when a super-robot is stolen and reprogrammed for evil purposes by a maniacal Rufio wannabe (Richard Sun).  Things go haywire as American and Hong Kong forces team up to reclaim and destroy this robot thing before it can take over the world, and before hero Edison can be brainwashed by the bad guys into joining the Dark Side.  Enter a lot of guns, a lot dark sets that are supposed to look sleek, and a LOT of bad acting.
Blame goes to all involved in this project but falls heaviest on the writers who missed the memo on what made ""Gen X"" such a popular success.  The first film remained lighthearted yet styled with occasionally innovative and mostly well-executed action sequences.  It wasn't overly ambitious but just edgy enough to get the adrenaline flowing. ""Gen Y,"" however, loses the humor and the naivite of rookie officers pushing their way through bureaucratic misdeeds in the pursuit of justice. Clearly, everyone figured good looks and frigid model stares would propel ""Gen Y"" through its script and directing pitfalls.  Sorry, folks.  The result is a pedestrian plot and dialogue that don't deserve the barreling, and plain bad, effort the cast puts forth.  Match (Stephen Fung) and Alien (Sam Lee) are the only characters worth half of our emotional investment and even they are reduced to tools for their English-speaking cohorts.  If this is intended as some statement about Western domination, it fails.  Perhaps the most nagging question for fans of the original - what happened to Nic Tse and Grace Yip's characters, both of who disappear completely from the script?
So never mind the story is cartoonish and the effects Power Ranger-esque.  Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk couldn't save this dud, but that?s no excuse to invite some of the worst young actors to have a go.  Maggie Q, best known as a model and Daniel Wu's (of ""Gen X"" fame) ex, seems to think she's still on the catwalk; my dead dog is more expressive than her.  Richard Sun and prettyboy sensation Edison Chen apparently dropped out of ghetto fab school, exhibiting some of the worst street English ever.  One prays that fans in Asia have not opted for this film to review their English lessons.  And Paul Rudd, poor, poor Paul Rudd.  I like this guy enough that I wish I could have told him to stay in America.  Any fans he had will be lost after they catch a glimpse of this mess.  As for the rest of the cast, a host of Hong Kong stars make an appearance that is summarily wasted, kind of like this entire movie.",1063152000,5,3007,4.553903345724907
1778094,4,B00006IUJM,"As the one before Gen-Y cops (Gen-X cops) it was energetic and filled with action.  I just didn't like that robot so its a 4/5.  And what happened to Nicholas Tse and Grace?!?
  I have to say the movie stayed funny (especially Alien).  And the charactor...Edison played by Edison Chen looks between Mos and Aaron Kwok.  Still....the question keeps popping into my mind....What happened to some of the old charactors?",1034985600,2,416,4.871428571428571
7969637,3,B00006IUJM,"If you have to watch this crazy sequel to Gen-X Cops, do yourself a favor and hunt down the rare HK DVD of it from MegaStar as it's only version that isn't painfully full screened to death with an annoying English dub over it.  It really hurts that Universal of all people couldn't even bother to release a widescreen version to this movie as it was shot in scope 2.35:1. Yeah the movie is pretty weird and it's another HK attempt at trying to be ""international"" in the same vein of China Strike Force from the same year, except this time Paul Rudd and Maggie Q are in this one.  Also Jackie Chan had nothing to do with this production so his ""Presents"" title part doesn't make any sense.  The thing did get a theatrical release in Hong Kong and elsewhere but dumped directly to the Sci-Fi Channel back before their name change. That version was also heavily edited apparently but not dubbed over and was titled ""Jackie Chan Presents Metal Mayhem"" for some odd reason. I know the movie isn't very good compared to the original Gen-X Cops but it deserves to at least be seen in scope instead of this stupid pan-n-scan print that Universal makes us suffer through.",1522713600,,1162,4.497630331753554

7969639,5,B00006IUJM,I bought gen-x cops and thought it was pretty good so I took a chance on this one. I thought it was pretty good.,1374364800,,112,3.7083333333333335
7969640,1,B00006IUJM,"I loved Gen X Cops so I was really excited to see this one but it was horrible. The characters were really out there. The English dubbed is terrible. I don't know why they didn't have a chinese version with subtitles. I love Stephen Fung but his character in this movie was just plain goofy,even Alien was way over the top. I bet Nicholas TSE was glad that he wasn't involved with this mess.",1329091200,,391,4.297297297297297
7969641,1,B00006IUJM,"Ok, we've got some good actors here.  And that's about the only good thing I can say.  There is no Chinese on the disk I received.  It's horrible in English.  I'm thinking it might rate 2 stars if I could see the subtitles.  The English Dub is like fingers on a blackboard to me.  The plot is terrible.  The characters are so over the top, I can't suspend my disbelief enough.  I didn't actually mind the FBI being pains in the butt.  It sounds just like American arrogance.  Beyond that, I'm lost.

Someone mentioned camp.  It's not even that good.  This sequel is not work the disk it's printed on.",1249516800,,600,4.345454545454546
7969642,2,B00006IUJM,"I bought Gen-X cops back some years ago when I was walking around some video store here in small town america cities called Hastings and came across this movie called Gen-X cops... it had Jackie Chan in it, but it mislead me to believe it HAD Jackie Chan starring in it solely as the main character... I was wrong and instead there were these 4 other hip-hop kungfu kids running around... and the movie actually wasn't that bad. I enjoyed it, had some awesome fight scenes, a good enough story and it seemed to just... charm me somehow. I found out a sequel to Gen-X cops was out and I figured I'd dig into it.

Big mistake. Gen-Y cops is everything Gen-X cops SHOULDN'T BE and I have no idea why it was made in the first place... I'm not sure if it's a sequel to begin with but the movie is terrible. There's no subtitled version to be found and the voice acting in this is HORRENDOUS! I couldn't finish past the first 15 minutes of it, turned off my DVD and wanted to cry for having bought a martial arts movie that is so bad I actually let it sit in my library of movies... it's a pure black sheep.

I give it 2 stars only for the sake that this is an exploit of Jackie Chan's... since supposedly he's in here too... I think... I  really don't know since I couldn't watch past the first 15 minutes of it (the voice acting... GOD THE VOICE ACTING!). Take my word for it, rent this movie but NEVER buy it. If you do rent it, you'd seriously have nothing else better to do or must have a real ironskin for this kind of thing because the movie is really not that good at all.",1171238400,,1574,4.154098360655738
7969643,1,B00006IUJM,Even the martial arts sequences can't save 'Gen-Y Cops.' Here we have a perfect example of Asian slapstick run amok. I don't know what else to say except the movie is just plain goofy and a total waste of time. For you Maggie Q fans out there who are thinking about buying or renting this film to see her forget it. Her part is sooo.. minisule you might just miss her altogether.,1150848000,2,379,4.277777777777778
7969644,1,B00006IUJM,"As far as Hong Kong cinema goes, I'm a huge fan.  I can usually pick out something positive about any movie. However, Gen-Y-Cops is the one exception...so far. This movie is rediculous. The characters are unrealistic and the storyline is outrageous. The worst thing about this film is the character ""Kurt,"" played by Richard Sun. As a villain, he's just plain irritating to watch. He over-acts every single line. And you just want to yank that rat tail right off of his head. Secondly, we have the big ol' disappointing performances of Edison Chen and Sam Lee. Generally, I'm a fan of both actors. However, these two don't even come close to reaching the potential for which they are known.

One more irritating fact about this film is that you can clearly see that it was acted out in English and Cantonese. You've got Paul Rudd (who should have never set foot in Hong Kong in the first place), Maggie Q, and the other FBI agents speaking in English all of the time. And then you've got the native Hong Kongers responding in Cantonese. But, we're not supposed to be able to tell, because of the fabulous (jk) dubbing job the editors did on this film. It is seriously annoying. I'm not sure I can express how truly horrific this film is, but here goes...I wouldn't watch this film again if you paid me. I'd rather eat dirt rolled-up in newspaper.",1149033600,4,1346,4.580912863070539
7969645,2,B00006IUJM,"When I had to go to the bathroom & push pause, my wife told me upon my return that we would not continue with this rubbish.  After we watched the DVD she selected, I encouraged her to go check her email because I wanted to see what happened.  As maybe my home experience may indicate, this is not a qualitatively good film.  However, you can have fun with it.  It's the kind of movie teenagers would love to rent to make fun of at the party.  Almost orphaned, a blond Paul Rudd plays Ian Curtis, an F.B.I. agent in search of a sense of humor.  We'd just seen him in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and laughed with him in ""Anchorman.""  Seeing him here was unexpected.  Fortunately, most American viewers will probably miss this epic.  When something aims to be silly, you have to ask if you enjoyed it.  I'm not sure of the young actor's name with the funny-shaped head (Stephen Fung?), but he mugs mercilessly for the camera and is humorous kind of like Chris Rock.  Richard Sun plays the villain Kurt who apparently is bright enough to invent the super robot.  However, none of that intelligence is seen on screen.  He mugs fiendishly.  Edison Chen as Edison is the red-haired Japanese cop who was friends with Kurt.  After playing paint ball with colorful blue explosions, Kurt injects Edison who then becomes hypnotized and can run a supercomputer to reprogram the robot.  We wonder what kind of drug can convey such amazing formulas, but it's a wild action packed shoot 'em up.  The film climaxes better than it begins with a great shooting match in the mall.  If you want a movie that makes sense or takes itself seriously, you have to go elsewhere.  But if you want to see something utterly silly that has plenty of explosions, you may be able to watch to the very end of ""Gen-Y Cops."" If you wonder who would make this movie, why ask why.",1124668800,3,1839,4.452095808383233
7969646,4,B00006IUJM,"If you are a fan of Japanese films I think you will enjoy this movie. Nice fights, big robots, overacting and humor outline this whole film. The acting is ok, but the whole movie has a fun atmosphere and makes up for a weak story with nice action and visuals. The introduction of the FBI characters is also pretty cool and adds a nice vibe to the movie. Of course all that said this movie is not for everyone, if I had to label it, think...camp. Enjoy!!",1122422400,4,453,4.218390804597701
