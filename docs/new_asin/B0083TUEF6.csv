8524731,5,B0083TUEF6,"The point of this movie is not that the girl was talking to Jesus but the natural conversation of how to talk to god
and listen to him and have a personal relationship with him .. I really enjoyed this movie for the content ,actors
 were very good .",1523577600,,249,4.081632653061225

8524734,5,B0083TUEF6,"I have watched the three movies in the Perfect Stranger series. I just finished watching ""Another Perfect Stranger"" and I loved it. The conversation that the main Sarah has with the gentleman on the plane with her seemed a bit long and drawn out, but their dialogue is incredible.

The conclusion of the film has a powerful impact on me. It wouldn't have had the same impact if the conversation between Sarah and the other passenger had been shorter.

I hope to watch this again.",1509926400,,479,4.623529411764705
8524735,5,B0083TUEF6,"This is the most amazing movie and clearly displays the beautiful relationship with God. It was so close to my own relationship and how religion had me confused too. Jesus is a wonderful councilor and meets us wherever we are in our lives. As a man with a very close relationship with God and the Holy Spirit, this movie brought me to tears. The fruits of the Spirit were abundant, love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness, kindness. I recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't understand Christ Jesus. Definately a must see and take notes.",1506729600,,539,4.74468085106383
8524736,1,B0083TUEF6,"This is NOT a Christian movie it LIES from the very beginning.  Jesus said He will NOT step foot on earth again until after the world has been cleansed again. so for a phony 'christian' movie to alter the truth, to make up and lie about the truth of God is blasphemous because it is teaching a false gospel and leading people astray.  Wolves in sheep clothing.  LIARS.",1506729600,,368,4.382352941176471

Typical Jebus junk.
Don't waste your time.",1506384000,2,59,4.9
8524738,4,B0083TUEF6,Starts off a little hokey but once it gets down to business I really enjoyed this movie.  The discussion the two have on the plane gives an interesting perspective on how to share one's faith in such a way that it makes sense to people.  Not up to the quality of The Shack but every bit as informative.,1506211200,3,302,4.189655172413793
8524739,5,B0083TUEF6,Love these movies! still have to watch the perfect gift! I love how it really helps with knowing how to share my faith!,1505952000,3,119,4.217391304347826
8524740,5,B0083TUEF6,Very worthwhile.  Watch Perfect Stranger first for a longer story.  This is fine alone too.,1502496000,3,91,5.0
