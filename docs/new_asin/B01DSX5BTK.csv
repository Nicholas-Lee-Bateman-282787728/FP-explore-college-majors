7723871,5,B01DSX5BTK,"Actually Mr Smith this is a real show and family , I'm not really sure where you get your info from but you stand incorrect. If you are going to write a review about something or someone at least have the common courtesy to have all your facts lined up sounds like your jealous to me . Don't spoil the show for the rest of us if you don't like the show watch the other reality crap on tv",1463788800,4,387,3.911392405063291
7723872,5,B01DSX5BTK,"I love this show but... this set includes all 14 (???) episodes from seasons 1 + 2. Hh?
The first season has 5 episodes, the second season 18 (!).
That's 23 in total as far as i can tell...
The australian release has all 16 episodes of season 2 on a 4-disc set (Region 4)
Pretty weird...",1461715200,3,287,4.052631578947368
7723873,1,B01DSX5BTK,"This show is a cheap family drama/comedy about living off the grid in Alaska. While the cast is really a family, this isn't a documentary or even a reality show.

What is different about this show versus other Alaska realty shows is that there is absolutely nothing real about it. The Brown family never lived off the grid as far as anyone knows. They have not really lived in Alaska since maybe 2008. They don't own the land shown on TV. They didn't build the cabin shown. While the show is shooting, they live in a lodge in town. When the show isn't shooting, they leave Alaska to live elsewhere. The first season was actually filmed on a five acre lot in a subdivision outside town right along the highway. There were houses just outside camera range in that first season. The locals do their hunting for them (they don't know how). The Browns are really just actors.

Its just another TV show even though the cast (the Browns) pretend that its all real when the cameras are rolling.

Enjoy it for what it is. Just another TV show.",1461456000,3,1034,4.4603174603174605
7723874,5,B01DSX5BTK,I love the show. Glad to be able to re watch it over again. Just wish the other full seasons were lower in price. Not intrested in streaming one episode at a time. Prayers to the family. I read that Ami isn't well.,1501718400,,214,4.0

I grew up with in the same area of CT & he knew him right away dad lived in the same town & got in trouble w the law so decided to go somewhere else with the kids but this show is so Fake it's nuts & I don't believe it at all,dads so sick but ahh don't bring him for help among other things it's just Hokey but if U like hokey shows this may be for yah but I don't think there's much truth to the whole thing...H",1495843200,,541,3.6324786324786325

7723884,1,B01DSX5BTK,I am extremely disappointed that this product does not contain the full season 2. Half of the episodes are missing. This product should not be advertised as having the full season 1&2 if it does not. I love this show but I wish I had not waisted my money buying half of a product.,1485907200,5,280,4.203703703703703

7723886,1,B01DSX5BTK,about as far from reality as reality can get.  This show is why 'reality' television shows need to LEAVE.  Nothing genuine about this show or the family.  I'll be so glad when folks realize they're watching nothing more than a soap opera on cable tv,1483660800,3,249,4.488888888888889

7723892,2,B01DSX5BTK,"Interesting. Not a show I would go back and watch again. The people of Alaska get a monetary stipend for living there, so though this family seems to rough it, they do have money.",1476144000,,179,4.294117647058823
7723893,2,B01DSX5BTK,This was not like the tv version at all. It was a poor film making idea that ripped everyone off Including me.,1474934400,,110,4.045454545454546

8756839,2,B01DSX5BTK,"I used to really like this show - Billy and Ami talked about having grandchildren live there long after they were gone, and POOF, Ami gets lung cancer. Instead of keeping their ""home"" - they ALL bail to the lower 48 and totally leave the place. I understand going to get treatment, but leaving your ""home"" for good, when you have 5 grown sons to care for it until you could come back - well, I now question everything they said they said they stood for being ""BUSH"" people. Now they're in Colorado?  - not exactly bush. They didn't leave their home when they thought Billy might die from the seizures he had - They even talked about his ""last day"" - he wanted to be in the bush. I have a close relative with lung cancer also, Didn't run away from home.. If this show ever comes back, I sure won't be watching it. I regret buying any of the seasons. Waste of money.",1525737600,,864,4.236363636363636

8756844,4,B01DSX5BTK,"Even though I know it's all fake My wife & I still love watching them. W3 like Bam & Gave most. The series sucks from the standpoint that they are ripping us off for our time. Out of 20 minuets of air time, after showing 3 & 4 recaps. there is only 78-10 minuets of new content. They play the same clips 3 & 4 times o=in a loop then might rearrange it another couple of go arounds... Its disgusting but thankfully, we watch it prerecorded and can FF through all the repeats and move on to other shows after these WOODSMEN, lol finish what ever they are doing. Cracks me up, they are an hour boar ride from town and Noah always has the best hardware Monet can buy when he makes these useless contraptions. Yes, they work but are useless 80% of the time.  The show we testy like if ""Live Free or Die"" with the homesteaders, still some of that is also fake but not near as bad as Browntown on Drugs. Mr. Brown would be S.O>L> if the KIDS actually decided to live their own lives. Cracks me up how the old man always try acting like he has see it all, down it all and then did it again running backwards to see where he has been and where he came from.....  Sorry, I think the Old Man lives off his kids to a large degree. Maybe he was a heck of a guy when the kids we're younger and is winding down as he getting older now? Who knows, he should stop Preaching that same tired old sermon about Hwe WE STICK TOGETHER over & over angfao,,,THE FAMILY, THE FAMILY, when he does it it looks wrong after the 2nd dozen times....",1505606400,,1517,4.087248322147651
