8466856,4,B005DIA0OK,"It's by Carol Reed, so it's very good.  Trevor is a bit old for the role of Willems, and his character in the movie is a bit ridiculous, unlike in the book.  Read the book, the plot of which continues well past the ending of the movie...the ending might surprise you...there is more than one villain  Much of the dialog is taken from the book.  Ralph Richardson is perfect.",1474070400,,373,4.36231884057971
8466857,3,B005DIA0OK,"Had a hard time liking this movie as the picture quality was very poor.  The cast and story were good.  All things considered, I would recommend it.",1382400000,2,148,4.444444444444445
8466858,5,B005DIA0OK,"Joseph Conrad is one of my favorite authors, and I return to his books and stories again and again. I really had no idea that this film existed until I stumbled across it on Amazon Prime. A movie like this simply couldn't be made today. The moral ambiguity in the story, the fact the native peoples are not all victims, and the weak will and sometimes reprehensible nature of Willums, the main character makes the story too ""adult"" for a modern audience. The acting from all involved was fantastic, even from the little girl (Morley's daughter!) that played Nina Almayer. I can't recommend this film enough.",1377993600,,607,4.735849056603773
8466859,2,B005DIA0OK,"As Carol Reed movies go, this one is no dog, and it does feature some of the finest British actors of its day.  However,  it doesn't come close to Reed's masterpieces The Third Man and The Fallen Idol.  The big problem here is the DVD quality.  This is NOT a Criterion Collection restoration, and it badly needs such a treatment.  While the visual aspects are fairly acceptable,  the sound track is a mess, with many distortions and sudden shifts from loud to soft, making it  impossible to enjoy.  For that reason, I greatly regret buying it.  But I took my chances and assume these would not be accepted as reasons for a return and refund.  Be forewarned.",1374537600,7,657,4.538461538461538
8466860,4,B005DIA0OK,"An under appreciated gem of a film, a marvelous adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novel. Superb direction and first rate performances by the entire cast make this neglected film something to remember.",1368835200,,196,5.354838709677419
8466861,5,B005DIA0OK,"an underrated film from the great carol Reed. Filled with atmosphere, great performances and classic Conrad themes. His follow up to the Third Man has some of the same concerns in another mysterious setting.",1364688000,,207,5.117647058823529
8466862,5,B005DIA0OK,"Next to Andrzej Wajda's version of ""The Shadow Line,"" this is the best film adaptation of any of Joseph Conrad's works that I have ever seen.  It definitely needs to be issued in a remastered version by Criterion or another high-class DVD manufacturer.",1362182400,7,252,4.8604651162790695
8466863,5,B005DIA0OK,"Set on an unnamed island in the northern Indian ocean, when a scandal causes a man (Trevor Howard) filled with moral rot to be shunned, he's taken by a benefactor (Ralph Richardson) to a hidden village on another island. But his lust for a native beauty (Kerima) not only destroys whatever decency was left in him but his treachery reaches beyond his own ken. Based on the novel by Joseph Conrad, this is a superior piece of film making. Watching it you feel the exhilaration that you get when you know you're watching a great film. From 1947 to 1951, director Carol Reed had an incredible run of first rate films: ODD MAN OUT, THE THIRD MAN, FALLEN IDOL and this jewel. The film subtly examines the colonial mindset of the white man and his questionable sense of superiority (a native asks, ""Does the white man think he knows what's best for us"") but like Conrad's LORD JIM, Howard's Peter Willems is a man who must redeem himself but unlike that Conrad novel, the results are different. Is there anyone who still doubts that Trevor Howard is one of the great English actors? He may not have the Shakespearean pedigree of an Olivier, Gielgud or Richardson but anyone who can give a performance like this one or in SONS AND LOVERS, HEART OF THE MATTER or ROOTS OF HEAVEN is an actor to be reckoned with. The impeccable supporting cast includes Wendy Hiller (who displays a lifetime of invisibility in minimal screen time), Robert Morley, Wilfrid Hyde White and George Coulouris.

The Studio Canal region 2 DVD from England is a nice B&W transfer in the appropriate 1.33 aspect ratio.",1352678400,4,1583,4.6535714285714285
8466864,5,B005DIA0OK,"This superb adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novel by English director Carol Reed is faithful in spirit (and often but not always in content) to the original even though it lops of the last section of the book and has the anti-hero Willems (played by Trevor Howard) marrying (and being made miserable by) Aissa (played by Kerima), a native woman he has fallen hopelessly in love with; in the book, Aissa shoots and kills Willems. The movie is swiftly paced and the theme of Willems moral degradation as he pursues Aissa (he becomes the ""outcast"" of his race in the jungles of Malaysia) is well handled. The principal actors, which also include Robert Morley, Wendy Heller, and Ralph Richardson are all excellent, and the technical features of the film, especially the cinematography by Ted Scaife and John Wilcox, are exemplary. Many consider this the best movie version of any of Conrad's novels.",1157328000,20,894,4.927152317880795
