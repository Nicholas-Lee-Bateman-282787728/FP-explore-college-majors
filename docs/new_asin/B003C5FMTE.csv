4107677,5,B003C5FMTE,"My daughter absolutely loves WordWorld. Its is a clean, educational program that teaches putting letters together to make words. There are great sing along songs that aren't annoying. My husband and I actually enjoy watching it with our daughter. The only complaint I have is the amount of episodes on a disc. Was upset that there were only a few, but definitely still worth the money.",1359072000,,385,4.848484848484849
4107678,5,B003C5FMTE,My girls (3y & 5y) started watching WordWorld on PBS and loved it. I was sooo happy when I found this movie set so that they could watch it when ever they wanted too. With all the not so good children cartoons out there now a days its nice to find a good one. This show is awesome and it's great to see my girls saying the letters and the letter sounds along with the characters.,1358121600,,379,4.0

4107683,5,B003C5FMTE,I purchased this for as a gift for my niece for Christmas. She loves Word World and my sister loves that it is educational too. Very happy with this purchase!,1325808000,,158,4.3
4107684,5,B003C5FMTE,"This collection of wordworld is perfect and best of all are pull apart animals soft and cuddly made of leters.
It is just amazing how quickly my baby learned letter recognition and puting words together in order thanks to these animals.
The whole family was amazed how those little hands could put togehter the dog, cat, zebra, cow, etc.. all animals in the set
together in a snap.

We started with the dog as it is her faforite animal, obviously - like most kids :) and then we gradually were adding on
animals untill we ended up with the whole set before we knew it. It is so rewording to see your tinny treasure to
be able to do words!!! that it is jsut breath taking.

We did not need any foring techinques, flash cards or anything, she was just grasping the concept from my taking apart
the animal, sounding the letters and puting them together back for her few times and then she got it like
in the same day and from that day on she knew.

I think this should be every paretnt's every baby first educational toy. It is so baby friendly, perfect for the sens of touch,
soft and cozy - what actually is said to develop brain faster.
It is sucha pleasing design and there are places to chew on if you need ha ha ha..
We take the animals everyhwere we go and she does not only have fun she is reinforcing her reading skills and preparing
for future writing without knowing it!

We were lucky to get the animals that were issued in those white boxed packaging with DVD inside. Not the other version in
the orangy cheaper packaging and without DVD. Difference is really apparent. I got the animals as a gift to my niece
but I could not find anywhere the first edition in white packaging with bluish background and DVd included in the box
so Igot the other set on e by and apparently they are not the same. Similar and all but the quality is not the same.
The original edition animals are more plumpy, solid, and have better and more baby friendly feel and touch to them
whereas the other - not the white box- edition has cheaper feel to it.

Overall we are very very pleased with the set. I have heard that this design got so many rewards and it is so popular among parents
and I totally agree with the notion. It is great for the baby and it teaches something useful for life unlike so many toys
that do nothing. It is good to see your baby having so much fun and stay engaged for good while with them.
It is amazing how long attention span the baby has while playing with the animals.

As she grows I marvel how she can put together the simple words from different animals for fun.. as in she would take
different letters from different animals and still spell the word dog or cat or cow correctly and giggles
that each letters is from different animal.. like for instance she will take L from the lion with the head,
then put i from the fish and then o from the dog and n from the lion again and she is so proud to do that.
It shows me that she is not only putting animal together, she is actually aware of the letters..
and to prove it she can take just the letters without heads and not color coded and at random
pull the letters and put together a word that is independent of characters..

soooooo cooooooooool

I am shopping for the original set now to get it for Christmas for two beloved babies in the family
and they are so hard to find, yet I won't stop till I find them. This is THE gift of learning and
I wont' settle for less :)",1324080000,2,3442,4.228310502283105

4107688,5,B003C5FMTE,"I purchased this 3 pack of Word World DVDs back in 2011 when my daughter was three.  She absolutely loved the series; so much so that I ended up buying her several other Word World DVDs.  Her five year old brother has now inherited, not only her DVDs, but also her love of the show.  The DVDs included in this box set are; Boppin' with the Bug Band, Bear's Masterpiece, and Flying Ant.  Each DVD consists of four episodes.  The episodes included on each DVD are as follows:

FLYING ANT:  Flying Ant, Catch that C!, Shuffleboard, and Play Ball!

BEAR'S MASTERPIECE:  Back on Track, Ride 'em CowBEAR, M is for Map, and Nightlight

BOPPIN' WITH THE BUG BAND:  Boppin' with the Bug Band, Pl-Pl-Plane, Get Your Coat, and Waterlogged

If you've never watched any of the Word World programs, you're really missing out.  :-)  I've watched several over the years; with both my daughter and my son.  The program is very educational and helps children with identifying letters, letter sounds, and spelling.  Each episode is unique, fun, and entertaining.  As I said earlier, both my children love these shows; yes, even my daughter who has technically outgrown the program still enjoys watching them with her brother.  As a parent, I can't say enough good things about Word World!",1432771200,,1269,4.743119266055046
