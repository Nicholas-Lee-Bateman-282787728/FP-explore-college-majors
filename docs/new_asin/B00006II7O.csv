8228169,5,B00006II7O,"The DVD was shipped quickly and in very good condition! I am very happy with this purchase. The movie was filmed in Pittsbiurg, PA. That is why I purchased it. My family and I had gone to the premiere.",1328400000,,201,4.17948717948718
8228170,5,B00006II7O,"A beautifully shot, intriguing story about two brothers living with a false pretense of how their father died. They have the truth slowly revealed to them with a complete but not necessarily predictable ending. It would be much better if people would deal with the less painful truth than devestating lies. Director Karl Kozak uses a nice blend of veteran actors with some promising newcomers. Jason Widener plays one of the brothers. Story has it that he was plucked from a ""cattle call,"" line and eventually got the part. He is a definite ""diamond in the rough."" So is this film.",1084147200,2,581,4.762376237623762

8228173,5,B00006II7O,"Wow - what a surprise! I rented this thinking it would be a fun little thriller & enjoyed it way more than I thought I would! OUT OF THE BLACK is a tightly written, well-acted thriller with real suspense & some breakneck action. A nice line of humor runs through it as well. Very cool flick!",1064793600,2,291,4.214285714285714
8228174,5,B00006II7O,"Nice cast with a few old familiar faces and some good-looking newcomers. Story was a bit complex in the middle but resolved very nicely. I like the ""indie"" feel and quality of this film. I think the writer and director showed a nice touch, not too heavy-handed. All in all, a good couple of hours of enjoyment.",1064448000,,310,4.456140350877193
8228175,4,B00006II7O,"I saw this film at a special premier in Pittsburg, near where the film was shot in a little coal-mining town. I liked it a lot then, and I'm glad to see it is coming out on video.... The story has a suspenseful plot--a little confusing in the middle, but it wraps up nicely at the end. What really impressed me was the acting by some newcomers like Tyler Christopher, Jason Widener, and Jacqueline Aries (hot!) as well as by some old pros like Sally Kirkland and Jack Connelly.
I would recommend this film as a purchase or a rental when you're in the mood for a good, old-fashioned storyline with good acting behind it.",1035072000,3,619,4.391304347826087
8228176,5,B00006II7O,"They say everyone has their secrets, every small town its skeletons. But what recent big-budget Hollywood bonanza has taken this idea to its full potential? None to my knowledge, but heck if I didn't just see a film that NEEDS to be seen by ANYONE looking for a couple of hours of quality, substantial entertainment. ""Out of the Black"" is a stirring, incredibly acted film about a small town and its secrets, as seen through the lives of two brothers whose dad has lost his life in a mysterious accident. What distinguishes this film from others on video is that it's a crime it wasn't shown on the big screen. It's that good. When the film ended, I actually shed a tear or two. For quality entertainment, you can do no better than this small miracle. Sally Kirkland deserves another Oscar nod.",1035072000,8,794,4.598591549295775
