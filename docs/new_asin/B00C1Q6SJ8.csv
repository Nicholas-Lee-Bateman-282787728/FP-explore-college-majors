8576318,3,B00C1Q6SJ8,"For $27 I expected much more. As a Nutritionist I've collected loads  of instructional DVDs over the years, from general health specialists like Gary Null and Mark Hyman, to cancer specialists like Nicolas Gonzalez and Charlotte Gerson, and every specialty in between. But this DVD is in its own class. It's a 31 minute infomercial. Seriously, 31 minutes, that's it.  I was so shocked at its brevity that I checked the case for a possible 2nd disc - hoping I'd find the REAL dvd - but alas, this was it.

Much of the meaningful information presented  is incomplete, offered as teasers that are followed with ""... I discus this with much more detail in my book.""

Most of the 31 minutes is spent on why we need to supplement with iodine/iodide, the history of our deficiency, and the data on some interesting studies. Great. Loved it - as an excellent introduction.

It's low enough budget that it's the kind of video you'd expect to find for free on YouTube.  It's just plain insulting to pay almost $30 to be told you need the book if you want any details.

For this cost you should generally expect 1.5 to 4  hours of substantial information that can stand on its own without the need to buy any  book that the video might based on.

Unfortunately I didn't watch it until after the return window closed or this would have gone right back to Amazon.

As much as I don't like supporting someone this disingenuous, I'll probably take the bait and buy the book. :-(

Update 03-2017: After a little more research I found a FB group called the Iodine Research Group. They recommend starting with the book  The Iodine Crisis: What You Don't Know About Iodine Can Wreck Your Life by Lynne Farrow, followed by Dr. Brownstein's book by the same title as this video.  Both books are said to give a solid background on the science behind the need for iodine but reviews are mixed regarding  information on the full protocol (although Farrow's book probably comes closest). There is a good reason for this -- iodine reacts differently to each person. But hopefully through the books and the help offered on the FB group you will be able to navigate your way through this very complex subject.

Bottom line on this video is it would best be offered free on youtube as an infomercial to help sell the book; and no more than $8-10 (including shipping) on Amazon. I upgraded my review to three stars only because this is such a vital topic.",1487548800,5,2425,4.576388888888889

Personally I have followed the advice and currently taking Iodoral (12.5 mg), APT Co Factor, and Solgar Selenium. I only get up ONCE per night to go, notice when I do NOT take this combination I'm up all night with weak flow.

Highly recommend it to the guys OVER 50 out there for your prostrate.",1442534400,2,346,4.3076923076923075
