8597726,5,B00DTX9R5O,"The shamanic techniques in this DVD have a very ancient feeling to them. While doing these exercises, I felt as though I had done this before in a previous lifetime. I especially enjoyed the comparison of the different world tree mythologies. It was cool to see that at one time, everyone practiced shamanism based on the nine worlds of the World tree. I won't give away too much except to say that if you are interested in Magick, Shamanism, Qigong, Yoga or meditation or if you want to tap into your own inherent shamanic knowledge and abilities, you should check out this DVD. The best part of it for me was how Mr. Denney helped me to understand the world tree and working with the eight directions in a way that worked best for me. I highly recommend this DVD...",1373241600,4,767,4.485714285714286
