8611310,5,B00F1BFKM6,"I am so glad to finally own this collection. I have long been a fan of black and white movies and photographs. Bruce Weber proves he is a master of both, as well as being a fine story teller. This movies are like valentines to us. For those who are not familiar with Chet Baker  you are in for a treat, he was a beautiful and talented man, a man who could not shake his demons and long time addictions. He was an amazing musician! The tribute to him is perfection. Thank you Mr. Weber for including Frances Faye, she was a true pioneer but someone very few people know. She was a singer who was about as out and gay as you could be in the 50's and 60's. She was never the headliner but always a lounger singer who the stars came to see. Everyone from Frank Sinatra to Judy Garland were big fans. Any gay or lesbian should make it a point to check out Frances. The segment on Peter Johnson was interesting, the photography is superb.  This celebrated fashion and figure photographer, whose studies of young men romping naked in the wilderness with big, happy dogs established a new category of all-American homoeroticism, has here created an eccentric, highly personal guided tour of some of his favorite people, places and things. Thank you for including us!",1437609600,,1258,4.465217391304348

8611314,5,B00F1BFKM6,"This master was able to connect with another great, by chance.

Bruce Weber reserected Chet Baker's career by the images captured on film for stills and motion pictures in this classic masterpiece.",1395619200,,197,5.15625
8611315,5,B00F1BFKM6,"During the 1980s, Bruce Weber changed the way the world looked at photography when his images became the basis for ad campaigns used by Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Versace, and Abercrombie & Fitch. He revitalized the brilliance of black-and-white, and found a way to eroticize the human figure in revolutionary ways. Men particularly became subjects of his beauty shoots. Suddenly the world was seeing the rise of the male figure as sex symbol clad only in tight white underwear and some well-placed dirt. He pioneered an all-American homoeroticism at a time when male sexuality was taboo and dangerous, thanks to the specter of HIV and fear of gay culture.

Weber mainly is known as a photographer, but he did dabble in film with music videos and a quartet of documentaries he made on his own. Bruce Weber: The Film Collection collects the fashion photographer's feature documentary work on four discs, which provide a nice career retrospective of his notable titles.

 First up comes Broken Noses, released in 1987. Weber fixes his camera on Andy Minsker, once a Golden Gloves champion, now a coach for a teenage boxing team in Portland, Oregon. It's the perfect subject for a fashion photographer who idolizes the dichotomy of being tough and soft all at once. Andy's story is about heartbreak, abuse, not making the Olympic team, and then finally inspiring young boys to learn the sport he loves. The feature alternates between black-and-white and color, and features Weber's trademark shots of men in boxing shorts looking tough and playful for his camera.

 Next is the incredible visual essay on Chet Baker called Let's Get Lost from 1988. It shows the jazz pioneer in his last days, looking haggard and worn, and juxtaposes this with the shots of him from his career height decades earlier, looking like a beautiful male model that Weber would photograph. Chet Baker emerged during the '50s, and he had chiseled good looks and an Oklahoma farm-boy charm that worked on fans and critics alike. Chet fell victim to a severe drug addiction, and what is left of him is showcased here by Weber only weeks before he passed away. Baker fell from a window in Amsterdam on Friday the 13th in 1988. This film serves as an elegant eulogy for a jazz legend who was as fragile as his own phrasing suggested.

 Chop Suey is basically a vanity project produced in 2000 which dwelled on a myriad of Weber's obsessions. Topics include Midwestern wrestler-model Peter Johnson and legendary lounge singer Frances Faye, among others. Weber provides free association memories on his subjects, and there are also some audio interviews with the people being documented. Oh, and there are also copious shots of a poodle and an elephant. It's sexy and full of a lot of great music. You come out of the 98-minute film feeling as if you have been at a funky dinner party with Weber, who showed you some of his favorite things and private collection artworks.

 The final piece in this four-part collection is A Letter to True, which is a scrapbook focusing on Bruce Weber's pets. The photographer owned five golden retrievers, and this film explores their world and holds them up as symbols of purity in a corrupted world. It is moving and elegant, but also as slick as any ad campaign Bruce Weber ever conceived.

Bruce Weber: The Film Collection presents these films in their original aspect ratios, and the quality varies according to the film stock used by the photographer. He liked to mix his medias between film, video, and grainy shots with the color drained right out. Soundtracks are presented in the original two-channel stereo, and they all are rendered well. There are no extras save for an elaborate booklet, which includes still photography plates and a description of each film.

8611316,5,B00F1BFKM6,"It is great to see this documentary that captures two time periods, the 1990s, as well as the earlier times, when TV entertainment was new.
These types of movies show how things were in reality.
Plus, it was interesting to watch Peter Johnson grow up during the filming.",1388448000,2,270,4.645833333333333
8611317,5,B00F1BFKM6,"At last this collection of Bruce Weber films is being released in the NTSC format for all to see in the US, Canada and other Region 1 countries.  My favorite film in the collection is LET'S GET LOST.  This moody, almost sullen look at the life and music of Chet Baker is one of the most striking documentaries I've ever seen - certainly the best jazz film ever done! It has such a wonderfully enthralling aesthetic.  Director Bruce Weber's background in still photography translates well to its cool, impressionistic, yet very lucid black and white look into a complicated soul. I really had little interest in Chet Baker before seeing LET'S GET LOST, but became a huge fan after seeing it. I went out to one of my favorite music stores and purchased literally every title of his work I could find. Baker had a very smooth (yet unsentimental), uniquely luminous west coast sound that no one has since duplicated. This film puts his music and his somewhat tragic life in a historical and artistic context that's both fascinating and heartbreaking. I saw it only once in 1988, when it was released on a very limited basis in art houses around the country and never forgot it.  To my great joy it is finally available on DVD to see again and again!!",1386115200,16,1246,4.599099099099099
