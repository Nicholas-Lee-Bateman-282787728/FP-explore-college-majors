8301902,4,B00076Q5LK,"This movie was the reason that I became a nurse.

Its really unfortunate that the movie didn't

stay on the air for long. I grauated from high school

in 1981 and never missed a show.  I was licensed as a

RN in 1985. This movie showed me that one should always have

something to fall back on.  Not to mention I love what I do.

And I give all the credit to Micheal Learnerd(Mary Benjamin).

  Thanks
