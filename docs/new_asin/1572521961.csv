7797518,3,1572521961,"I have been on a quest to see all of Paul Rhys's films ever since I saw him as Dracula. What a strange and interesting career he has lead! Though very young and handsome, he always had such a nervous energy in his early work. However, I did enjoy his ongoing flirtation with the troubled ingenue as the character Chapot , and his drunken fountain scene.
As for the rest of the film... Virginia Madsen was fabulous as the actress/harlot mistress! Mathilda May was a bit too naive at times, and bore very little chemistry with her husband who was supposed to be so very alluring. But I liked that it was based on a true story, and that Colette finds her own voice in a time when women rarely had a chance. Not entirely a ""chick flick"" either! There are several nude ladies and some lesbian love scenes.",1453680000,,800,4.375838926174497

7797521,2,1572521961,"This story could have and should have been so much better. A hot leading lady is put to waste, in this dry drama. Too Bad.",1377820800,,122,3.92
7797522,4,1572521961,"I see a glaring error in the last review & have checked the facts at IMDB!

KLAUS MARIA BRANDAUER (a male actor) was the Older Man (Henri Gauthier-Villars), NOT the Young Girl (Sidonie Gabrielle Colette), who was played by Mathilda May, the real star of this film! Virginia Madsen's character (Polaire) seems accurately described.",1142035200,2,330,5.111111111111111
7797523,5,1572521961,"EXCELLENT FILM. VIRGINIA MADSEN AS AN ACTRESS BACK IN THE DAYS OF THE NOTORIOUS ""MOULIN ROUGE"" IS EXCELLENT AND SHE DOES A MARLENE DIETRICH TYPE OF SONG AS SHE'S SITTING ON A MOON. KLAUS MARIA BRANDAUER IS HOWEVER THR MAIN ACTRESS. SHE PLAYS A NAIVE YOUNG GIRL WHO MARRIED AN OLDER MAN WHO WAS NOT WHO HE PRETENDED TO BE. HE EVEN PUBLISHES A BOOK SHE WROTE UNDER HIS NAME. ANYHOW VIRGINIA MADSEN  (WHO WAS HIS MISTRESS) BECOMES HER FRIEND AND LOVER (GREAT LESBIAN SCENES) AND WISES HER TO HIS DOINGS.  A FINE FILM YOU MUST SEE!!THERE'S AN EXCELLENT SONG WHICH IS SUNG BY JACKIE DE SHANNON AT THE END OF THE FILM. IT SHOULD'VE BEEN A BIG HIT!",1031011200,20,641,4.378151260504202
7797524,4,1572521961,"This movie depicts an era gone by.  Colette is actually the name of a character she writes about, a girl who has adventures and is mischevious,  her alter ego.  Her family marries her to a man who appears on the surface  to have a fine place in society, but in fact is an unsuccessful publisher  and who is constantly in debt and in need of rescuing by his family.  He  sees an opportunity to exploit his naive bride by publishing her works, but  only under his name.  He convinces her this is necessary, as society would  not accept a woman writing the racy tales she provides.  He leads her to  experience a menage a trois with his mistress, and the mistress entices her  to use drugs, all of which only opens Colette's eyes to the reality of her  own world, and the realization that her place in that world is  unsatisfactory.  Her eventual confession to the world that she is the  author is her cry of freedom and liberation from the structured world that  society dictates is where women must dwell.  The real Colette wrote the  story for ""Gigi"", which became an Oscar-winning movie, but  unfortunately Colette passed away before she learned how beloved her story  had become.
The photography and music in this movie are wonderful, and  you gain a sense of being in a dream.  Colette would have loved that  sensation attributed to her stories, and perhaps she would love it for her  own story.",965520000,25,1398,4.558704453441296
