5312505,4,B009B82F5U,"Great family movie!!! We loved Elf-Man!!! He inspired all of us... The movie was refreshing, hopeful and filled with integrity and love.. The perfect Christmas movie to watch year after year. I highly recommend everyone buying it for there home collection.",1355616000,4,256,5.2682926829268295
5312506,1,B009B82F5U,"The 5 star reviews have been written by people who have a link to the production of this movie, trust me. Read them, they are not the average movie goers comments, they are clichd rubbish, just like the movie is. Don't waste your time like we did.",1355616000,,247,4.276595744680851
5312507,5,B009B82F5U,"The little person from Jackass is actually really good in Elf-Man--funny and smart-assed without being annoying. The movie is really funny and with some genuinely sweet moments, along with some good ol-fashioned bumbly Home Alone-esque schtick. The kids are really appealing as well (I say this because in some Christmas movies, the children annoy me). Definitely worth checking out!",1354579200,5,383,5.508474576271187
5312508,1,B009B82F5U,"The first couple reviews must have been written by the same person because the movie is HORRIBLE!!! The acting sucks and its just an overall b-rated movie. Don't let the ""star"" of the movie fool you......Save your money and rent it if you really wish so see it. There's a reason why it didn't make it to theaters!!!!",1354060800,,316,4.4655172413793105
5312509,2,B009B82F5U,"Just got through watching Elf-man and was very disappointed! After reading the reviews (all 4 stars), I was anticipating a really good Christmas movie to watch with my son. Unfortunately, the movie started off slow and never really got any better! Mediocre at best! Save your money!",1352937600,,282,5.0212765957446805
5312510,5,B009B82F5U,"A heartwarming and funny Christmas movie for everyone.  Two new, up and coming child actors who are sure to make you smile.  A great holiday movie for all.",1352764800,3,155,4.5
5312511,5,B009B82F5U,"A Christmas treasure filled with  plenty of laughter and heartwarming moments.  A fun movie for ALL ages, something to add to the Christmas wish list!",1352764800,3,150,4.96
5312512,5,B009B82F5U,"I got a chance to watch Elf-Man and have to tell you how wonderful this movie is!!! Its visually amazing and the Acting was so enjoyable with a cast of characters that light up the screen! You will laugh out loud with the incredible story and hilarious hijinks that ensue. And within all the mayhem, I especially enjoyed Mirelly Taylor's roll as Amy. She brings such a charmingly-funny and romantic-beauty to the role, that sucks you in and grounds the movie to pull everything together.

It is everything you'd want in a Christmas movie, with all the bells and whistles, laughs and jingles, that only the holiday season can bring. I recommend this movie to everyone for any occasion. Its a movie that just, down right makes you want to smile!!!",1350432000,6,745,4.687022900763359
5312513,5,B009B82F5U,"This was really an all-around pleasant surprise.  The Elf-Man himself is of course the eye candy we came to see and deserves every accolade we can offer him -- he's wry, spry, and wise.  The rest of the cast is also terrific, the kids are particular stand-outs, but everyone is solid.  And so is the overall production itself right down to the clever special effects.  This really is the perfect Christmas sock stuffer.  A real treat:)",1350259200,4,435,4.671052631578948

In an unprecedented mashup of Christmas magic and superhero action, Elf-Man provides an cinematic experience like no other. This film is sure to join our family's list of traditional Christmas films, and to be enjoyed every year with a stiff glass of eggnog and countless bouts of laughter.

A little girl made a wish and the elf came to life to make that wish come true. If you like made for tv movies. If you like Hallmark or Lifetime movies,this is for you.

5312877,3,B009B82F5U,This will appeal to the younger kids.  Give them silly fun and a elf super hero and it will make their day.  It's just a entertaining little B flick for the wee ones so don't go expecting too much out of it and the kids will love it.  Not having seen Wee Man before I thought he did a good job as Elf Man and you have to chuckle at Jeffrey Combs as the leader of the villains especially when he sends his henchman out for a can of Troll Off.  Combs loves to play offbeat roles whether its the hero or a villain and gives a fun performance.  Incidentally I loved the scene of Elf Man and Combs facing down each other like a scene from a Eastwood spaghetti western and instead of a tumble weed blowing across between them a Christmas wreath comes rolling by in the wind.  They tossed in a few subtle tongue in cheek jokes that adults might pick up on.,1416787200,,849,4.0843373493975905

I really, truly like Wee Man and it was due to this that I got this movie.  Mistake!  He really was pretty horrible.  It is obvious that stunts are his forte and acting falls way down the line.  Combine his acting with a poorly written script and you get something that isn't even worthy of a ""what-shall-we-watch-now-that-Rudolf-The-Rednose-Reindeer-is-over?"" category.  Although the kids in the movie were cute as was Mackenzie Astin, their acting also could have shown a lot of improvement.  They always say that directing is 95% casting...maybe it's purely the casting director's fault that this isn't even worth a late-late-late-late-late-night-nothing-else-is-on-TV movie.  I give this, at the most, one-star and strongly recommend you skip it altogether.",1371513600,,942,5.360544217687075
5312882,1,B009B82F5U,"You know it's bad when an 11 year old says, ""This movie is horrible. The acting stinks."" He was absolutely right. Wee Man simply cannot act. The others maybe are ok, but the script is so poor that they don't have a chance. If it helps to put this in perspective, my son loved ""The Three Stooges"" and ""Mr. Bean"".

When I relized that Jason Acuna (Wee man from the ""Jack Ass"" movies)was the lead actor I thought that maybe this wasn't a kids movie. Boy was I wrong. Ok maybe not totally wrong. The truth is, it is a family movie. There is something for everybody in this film. Its action,romance,and comedy all rolled into one. Jason, who plays the elfman, is so warm and genuine in this role. He is very Good. The cast is very talented and I enjoyed watching this film with my family. This DVD is the new ""Watch it over and over again"" film for my kids.",1357171200,,689,4.18796992481203

5312891,4,B009B82F5U,"As a native of Frederick, Maryland, where this movie was filmed, I'm pretty much doomed to be biased in its favor. That being said, I tried my best to be objective when I first saw it, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Make no mistake, it's definitely a direct-to-video Christmas movie, so you won't find word-class production values here; the CGI is fairly dodgy, and Elf-Man's costume (the one he wears on the front cover of the DVD) doesn't look ""heroic"" so much as ""assembled on someone's dining room table.""

But that's all beside the point, really. You'd be hard-pressed to find a Christmas movie with more genuine heart; the story is delightful without ever taking itself too seriously, and the cast and crew's enthusiasm for the project really comes through. Although it gets a bit sappy near the end, overall the story is satisfyingly tight and well thought out, and funny to boot.
