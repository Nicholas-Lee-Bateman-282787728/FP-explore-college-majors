A pity, but there you go.",1202774400,,165,3.9696969696969697
7895079,4,6305789088,"Touma has been at cram school for almost a year now, but he seems to be making little progress academically. He can't possibly blame it on himself though, can he? He's still doing double duty at the university in a bid to make Mieko think that he's a brillant college student, but how much longer is that going to last, especially when the school ""prince"" is out to get Mieko for himself, and has begun investigating Touma's true status. Urara, on the other hand, is constantly on hand to do anything Touma's dirty but normal little mind wants her to do, whether it's emotional or physical comfort that he needs. In these last six episodes, Mieko will find out the truth about Touma, but more importantly, Touma will have to figure out what his feelings are for Urara. Is she just a convenient consolation prize or does he actually love her?  And how is he going to get out of cram school with all these love affairs occupying his attention?

Sakura Diaries is an unrealistic mix of comedy and sexual tittilation that somehow works in a short 12 episode format. You can't help at times to be embarrassed by the inexperience of these characters, especially Urara, because she mistakes physical intimacy for love. I don't think she truly loves Touma. What she has is a very large and unhealthy schoolgirl crush, and being that Touma is her first cousin, I wouldn't be surprised if their kid was three times as dumb as Touma!  But even though the main characters are immature and naive, you can't help but admire their searching and longing to find someone they can truly share their affections with. At least these characters try and refuse to give up. I did feel that this series ended too abruptly and could have used one more episode to wrap things up adequately.

I would also reccomend the anime ""His and Her Circumstances"" and ""Golden Boy"".",1151884800,,1844,4.647239263803681
7895080,3,6305789088,"I was really glad that they did do something on sexual ssault, but Touma is a jerk! And I don't think it was given enough gravity. ut at least they did discuss it. As for the rest of the ep, not bad at all.",995500800,,206,3.7045454545454546
7895081,4,6305789088,"This show pretty much the animated version of Undressed.  The main diffrence between the shows is that this show makes the characters  interesting.  I really love Urara and Comey.  They are so interesting and  have the best voice acting in the series.  I think that this tape is  showing what way the series is going.  This video is not funny like the  first, but still it has all the right peices put together just right.  There is sex, but there isn't so much that it's hentai.  There is comedy  but it is still dramatic at parts.
This video really is hard to watch at  times, but they really help the story.  I was shocked with what happened,  but then they show how much it hurt the characters.  It helped that they  don't take the subject of sex or rape lightly.  The characters are always  wondering if they should or shouldn't.  In the end you know that they are  really struggling.  It is very realistic in that aspect.  I also liked that  Comey isn't just a dits in this tape.  She actually tries to help Urara,  and even though it originally gets her in alot of trouble, in the end Comey  helps out.  I really can't wait till video 3 comes out.  This series has me  hooked (even if it is from U-jin).",967161600,5,1210,4.31981981981982
7895082,3,6305789088,"Having enjoyed the first Sakura Diaries immensely, I eagerly awaited this  volume.  For the first half of volume 2 I was quite pleased, as there were  several scenes that were laugh-out-loud funny.  Midway through, however,  the story took a decidedly not-funny turn.  I don't want to spoil it, but I  must say I was rather disturbed by this.  I did think it was well handled,  but be prepared for it.  You'll know it when it happens, and it is NOT a  fantasy sequence.
I can't wait for the next one to come out, though.",965347200,3,520,4.425531914893617
7895083,4,6305789088,"Where Chapter 1 of Sakura Diaries tickles the funny bone, Chapter 2 tugs more at the heart strings.  The first episode on the video picks up with a sitcom feel: Touma meets a rival for Mieko's affections in Mashu, the Keio  stud previously known only as ""Vest Guy.""  And Mashu isn't buying  Touma's tale of being an economics major.  But the last two episodes focus  squarely on Touma and Urara.  New light is shed on Urara and Touma's prep  school classmate, Akimoto.  The intense climax of episode 2, as well as a  good dose of character introspection, leave you reaching for the Kleenex.  But never fear, fans of the ""comedy"" in romantic comedy.  Akimoto  and the ever delightful, scene-stealing gal-pal Komi provide the laughs  through misty eyes.  Even Mashu helps out a bit (if he and Komi don't meet  up again, there's no justice in this world).  Over all, Chapter 2 keeps you  as glued to your TV as the first installment did, and leaves you dying for  Chapter 3.",961372800,6,971,4.605882352941176
