Also stars a young Mauricio Garces the victim that Gaston helps clear of murder. Fast paced Mexican western. Back when Mexico made good movies.",1440633600,,279,4.833333333333333
8306287,4,B001GNHT8G,"Late 50's Spanish-language, Mexican-made (no subtitles) western.  A young cowboy comes to a village to find out who killed his best friend.  He comes across a town held in the grip of fear by a group of gangster-type cowpokes who force protection money from their victims and still brutalize them.  Our good guy set about to right wrongs and fight the evildoers.  The quality of the DVD is good, probably the best available.  Recommended for fans of the genre.",1419638400,,460,4.772151898734177
