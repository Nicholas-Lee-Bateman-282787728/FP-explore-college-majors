8623746,4,B00GJ7CU1A,"""Transformers Prime: Ultimate Bumblebee"" collects four episodes of the hit television show on one DVD. Everyone's favorite Autobot steps into the spotlight in ""Masters and Students,"" ""Operation Bumblebee"" Parts I and II, and ""Deadlock."" Veteran voice actor Frank Welker continues to bring the dedicated metallic hero to life and steals the show from the big man himself, Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen). A great celebration of this beloved character!",1394150400,2,457,5.542857142857143
8623747,5,B00GJ7CU1A,"This action packed 88 minute DVD features four episodes from various seasons of Transformers Prime and Transformers Prime Beast Hunters.  Each episode features Bumblebee kicking some metallic butt even when he loses his guns and ability to transform in the two part episode Operation Bumblebee.  Fans will learn why and how BumbleBee lost his ability to talk like the other robots do. The ambitious Starscream is the main villain in Masters and Students as he tries to become the new ruler of the Decepticons.  He awakens Skyquake who still follows Megatron's orders and not Starscream's.  Megatron is back in the fourth episode Deadlock which is the third seasons finale of Transformers Prime Beast Hunters.  In that episode the fate of earth is decided as the Autobots and Decepticons fight an epic battle.  Bumblebee really shines here and isn't disobeying orders like he has in the previous shows on this DVD.  This collection is great for any Bumblebee fan out there.  For the reasonable price of $9.99, I highly recommend it!",1392854400,2,1031,5.023529411764706
