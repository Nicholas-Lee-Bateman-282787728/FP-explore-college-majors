I stuck with six step, 4-step, Ci Ci's, a few other in your face styles, and other things just to get me to my freezes and powermoves.  This had just made my style even more dynamic! Highly Recommended for all Bboys and Bgirls of all levels!!",1367107200,,326,4.241935483870968
8321657,5,B001MSJICA,"I have been breakdancing for a couple of years.  I can do a few uprocks, 6-5-4-3 steps, freezes and such.  But it is all relatively mechanical.  I have bought every single breakdancing DVD howto that is available, like 15 in all.  This DVD is one of my 3 favorites.  It is the best instruction you can get on the uprock and downrock BY FAR. It will make people googly eyed to see you dance before you even get around to a powermove.  All other DVDs will show you kick step, indy step, 6-5-4-3 steps and that is it.  He shows numerous additional uprocks and downrocks, complete with transitions and drills, none of which is covered anywhere else.  You can see these moves in competition elsewhere, but you cant do slow motion from youtube,etc. and there is no other source of instruction for his additional uprocks and downrocks.  Storm is a real expert (see his youtube performances if you don't believe) and is one of the worlds premier breakers.  I am sure the information on this DVD could take me a year or more to become satisfactorily proficient.

What is doesnt have:  no powermoves.  However, there are numerous DVDs (in fact all of the instructional breakdancing DVD's except this one and Ephrat's) that go over the power moves.  This DVD is available in PAL and NTSC so make sure you get the right format for your region of the world (US in NTSC).  No flashy production, just down to earth instruction.

In my opinion, anyone learning breakdancing from DVD needs this DVD or ""Breakdance with Ephrat"" to learn the uprock and downrock.  Then for the powermoves I would recommend ""Breakdance Completely Street"" or ""How to Breakdance 101"".  Then for moonwalking, glides, hiphop moves, as well as breakdancing basics and powermoves I would get the silly ""Top 20 Breakdance Moves"" (which has the best windmill instruction of any dvd available and is perhaps the best overall of all breakdance dvds).

Enjoy!",1264377600,3,1911,4.753799392097265
8321658,5,B001MSJICA,"This is actually the first dvd that I've ever purchased that advertised the entire truth in the title.  The dvd has a collection of many footwork moves so be prepared to rewind a lot.  Some moves are relatively easy and others will take more practice.  Storm also shows how to move into and out of the footwork.  There are drills to practice as well.  Storm is a doll and I really enjoy watching him.  Great explanations from a great teacher.  I hope he makes another video.  Since there are none in stock, you can purchase this dvd at [...].",1246492800,2,542,4.404040404040404
