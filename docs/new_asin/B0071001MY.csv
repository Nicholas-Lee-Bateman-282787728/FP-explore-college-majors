8507965,4,B0071001MY,"This documentary is shaped by the historians whose research and testimony backs up its claims: Goetz Aly and Wolfgang Dressen. Both are German historians from the 1968 generation who are specialists on the Aryanization of Jewish businesses under Nazism. They can be counted among the ""functionalist"" school of historians who argue that competition among bureaucrats was a major driving force behind the organized mass extermination of Jews across Europe. They emphasize the local, personal responsibility of ""ordinary"" Germans for the Holocaust.

The expropriation of assets from Jewish Germans under Hitler benefited essentially every non-Jewish German citizen. Not only the Gestapo invaded Jewish homes to confiscate personal possessions and bank balances, so did German tax officials. These bureaucrats competed to find the most efficient way to organize the robbery of Jewish Germans before they fled or were deported to be murdered. Larger assets were kept by local tax offices, while smaller possessions were auctioned off locally as ""Non-Aryan"" property.",1339977600,2,1061,5.715189873417722
