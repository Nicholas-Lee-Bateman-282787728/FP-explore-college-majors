8324341,5,B000035X8P,"This video was released in '95 and even 12 years later it's worth getting out your old VCR for a watch. I caught ""Tank Girl"" on TV yesterday and heard the same song thats played in Jeremy Mcgrath's incredible opening segment, so I came home and spent an hour digging for my old VHS tapes and hooking up the VCR just for those first few minutes of motocross bliss. While I don't enjoy the rest of the video as much, its still worth owning and watching even if just for the nostalgia of the good old days when Mcgrath was king riding atop the Honda CR Steed.",1180742400,,556,4.205607476635514
8324342,5,B000035X8P,"This movie is still my all-time favorite.  I race dirtbikes, and I started a little bit before this movie came out, so it's got a little bit of sentimental value too.  But all in all, awesome footage, great music, Jeremy McGrath (what more do I need to say about him other than he's the best of all time!!)  I highly recommend this movie for anyone's collection.",1097625600,,362,4.454545454545454
