8247358,1,B0012R1R34,"Note the misspelling of Emmanuelle... All three of these movies are unauthorized spin-offs of the original 1974 groundbreaking, first ever X-Rated ""feature film""; Emmanuelle, staring Sylvia Kristel.

Divine Emanuelle, Love Cult (1981), staring Laura Gemser.

Lady Emanuelle (1989), staring Mal.

Yellow Emanuelle (1977, staring Chai Lee.

All three of the movies suffer from poor acting, poor directing, and weak (if not broken) story lines. I strongly suggest that you rent these movies before you buy them. I also suggest that you may be interested in two of the legitimate Emmanuelle sequels with Sylvia Kristel as Emmanuelle; Emmanuelle II (1975) and Goodbye Emmanuelle (1977) a.k.a. Emmanuelle III.",1416700800,3,703,5.60377358490566

8247363,3,B0012R1R34,Of course it is a nice collection of the Emanuelle movies but I am disappointed a bit because of noticing unnecessary censoring. Still finding no answer why there at all is any need to apply cutting of scenes here and there,1328400000,6,223,4.463414634146342
8247364,1,B0012R1R34,it was what i expected. but i did not catch the story line and i simply got lost in the story because i didn't know what direction the story line is headed. i guess i little more story than sex.,1289692800,,194,3.875
8247365,3,B0012R1R34,"This is not really a review of the movies themselves but the DVDs. Yellow Emanuelle and Lady Emanuelle are presented in anamorphic 1.85:1 but Divine Emanuelle, or Love Camp, is presented in full screen even if it says widescreen on the DVD case or here at Amazon. This is a warning for those who are buying this pack for the only film starring Laura Gemser. The pack is cheap for three films but it's not really worth it if your buying it for Love Camp. But if you're buying it for Yellow Emanuelle, easily the best film in the pack, then go ahead.",1211500800,30,548,4.330097087378641
