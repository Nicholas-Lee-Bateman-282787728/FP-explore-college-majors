6198811,5,B00HR0V7YO,"Rabid Love did a really good job bringing me back to the good ole' 80s... from the costumes, sets, cars and funny lines!  The actors and story were a lot of fun... I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but the killer/bad guy has an awesome ranting speach in there that I loved!  Usually lower budget movies have bad acting, and yes there are some campy lines in this movie, but they are funny and it works for the story.  The actors do a great job playing their respective characters and getting you into the feel of the era.  There is a lack of gore in this movie, and while it doesn't bother me, but may offend my fellow horror junkies.  If you like 80s movies, give this one a try!",1393977600,,683,4.143939393939394
6198812,1,B00HR0V7YO,Low budget movies need to have good actors and this one made the mistake of a shoddy script AND bad acting in my opinion.  Some people may like it but I don't know how,1432080000,2,167,3.911764705882353
6198813,1,B00HR0V7YO,"I'm almost willing to give this one another star, just because it's so close to being a so-good-it's-bad movie, but in the end it just drags too much. That being said, there is some stuff that is just hilariously funny bad, mostly to do with bad lighting and bad acting.",1430956800,2,270,4.42
6198814,5,B00HR0V7YO,This is one of the absolute best indie horror films that I've seen in a very long time and it has an absolutely fantastic soundtrack.  I have watched it twice already since purchasing it.,1428278400,,187,4.5

6198819,4,B00HR0V7YO,"I normally do not post reviews for movies on here, but this one got such poor reviews. The cinema photography wasn't great, but it was a nice 80's throw back. In terms of scares, there were some good random jump out of your seat moments and plot wise it was not terrible. Then they throw in a few romantic interludes and post-teenage angst and I feel like you have a decent movie. really a 3.75 to 4.2 if you like horror thrillers. Would I buy this, no. Maybe rent it if someone chipped in, but for a free Prime movie, you have a winner winner chicken diner!",1405555200,,558,4.224299065420561
6198820,3,B00HR0V7YO,"First off, this certainly is not the worst offering for Amazon Prime online streaming.  A few of the actors and actresses are good, the others are forgivable.  The camera work, editing, and overall production is decent, and the dialogue is actually above par for a straight to video low budget horror flick. I love that it's set in the 80's, but that this fact isn't thrown into our faces. Instead, small clues throughout the film reveal this, such as outdated electronics, hair styles, and a rather good glam rock soundtrack.

At first, I thought that this was going to be a predictable, campy, slasher, and for the most part, I was right. There is a twist that actually almost ruins the charm of it all.  It's feels like the movie started off very strong and with a lot of ambition, then peters out during the second half.  In the end, this is a good time killer for horror fans, especially if it's not your only focus while watching it. Instead, watch it while cooking or working on something... or view it with some friends, a lot of beer, and a good sense of humor, and have your best MST3K style bashing.",1405555200,,1110,4.502487562189055
6198821,1,B00HR0V7YO,"Terrible movie.  You and I could easily do better, if given a camera and $200. Really.
How do movies this bad get greenlighted anyway??",1405036800,,135,4.625
6198822,2,B00HR0V7YO,I did not like this movie. The story was never explained. It was definitly low budget.,1404086400,,86,4.4375
6198823,1,B00HR0V7YO,"I get what they were trying to do here... mimic a time when films weren't taken as seriously and had a bit of fun.  I love these old 80s slasher films, that's why I watched this one.  But it is SO SLOW and has NO TENSION.  Not to mention the kills consist of panning away from the person dying (who by the way, is NEVER NAKED) and splashing a handful of blood on the grass.  40 minutes in.  That's not a kill.  That's some trivial high school bull.  This movie does indeed mimic old 80s slasher movies, but not the good parts, only the bad, sad boring parts.  Stay away, unless you're having trouble sleeping, this'll help you right along.",1403827200,,639,4.266666666666667
6198824,2,B00HR0V7YO,boring. gross. Cute actresses an not really the WORST film. If you like horror you may actually like this fine.,1403827200,,111,4.6
6198825,5,B00HR0V7YO,"EXCELLENT Acting, story twists.  Well done!  I enjoyed the picture immensely.  The cinematography was great!!  Like I said, Well Done!",1402099200,2,134,5.55
6198826,1,B00HR0V7YO,"I guess I don't have a lot more to add!

6198827,1,B00HR0V7YO,"For a movie that was released in 2013, they did a really great job in making this movie truly feel like a very horribly done 80's movie. Anyway you want to slice it though, horrible is still horrible. Paul J. Porter not only directed this movie but he also stars in it, wrote it and produced it. I can only conclude from after watching the movie that all of this is an outlet for his narcissistic view of himself. Either that or Hayley Derryberry completely used him to generate some sort of name for herself, who is also clearly narcissistic as well. One saving grace for Paul J. Porter is that he seems to have included several of his family members in the production of his film, I personally thought that was nice but then again it could have simply been out of necessity. So if you are into poorly made and really cheesy 80's movies and watching narcissistic people on film, you will probably absolutely love this movie. The best actor in the movie was Hannah Landberg who played Summer Watson but unfortunately she had a fairly insignificant and pathetic role in the movie and was the first person to die in the movie. The absolute only things that didn't make this a complete waste of ninety minutes of my life was watching Hannah Landberg act and discovering a really amazing song that they included into the climax of the movie. In an otherwise almost completely horrible soundtrack selection for this movie, the song Exit the Building by Racecat Deathmatch is the only thing that made this whole horrible experience worth while. To each their own though, you may love this movie, I will certainly never watch it again or ever recommend it to anyone. Definitely check out the song  Exit the Building by Racecat Deathmatch though!",1401148800,,1738,4.642857142857143
6198828,5,B00HR0V7YO,"The actors were excellent for young and new talent, especially Paul Porter and Hayley Derryberry.  Wishing them much movie success--look forward to seeing them again on screen!",1399420800,2,176,5.518518518518518
6198829,3,B00HR0V7YO,"I support independent film. Not every filmmaker has a pocket full of money to fund his/her movie. The concept for Rabid Love is unique all the way through. Because of the budget, when we're in the woods, we're in the woods. I like that. It's realistic. (Even the random gnats.) Plus, there's a plot that stays on point. Thrills, mystery and creepy moments are the fixin's on this tasty indie plate. The main course is awesome and there's no confusion as to what the film's about. Don't give up on it. Not for the kids.",1399075200,,518,4.463157894736842
6198830,1,B00HR0V7YO,"Whoever give this movie more than one star, they should not watch any movie at all because they don' t actually know the definition of MOVIE . THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME, MONEY, AND PATIENCE.",1398643200,2,188,4.25

6198833,1,B00HR0V7YO,"While I like to watch movies, Supernatural, mild violence, this was a bit too intense.
This is all I can share.",1397606400,,111,4.333333333333333
6198834,5,B00HR0V7YO,"Rabid Love is obviously an attempt to bring back the look and feel of movies from the 80's and get away from the modern horror requirements of excessive blood, gore, sex, found footage, and filmmakers taking themselves way too seriously.  It's a no budget indie movie, which for me only adds to the charm and it succeeds with integrating a slower paced story, character development, moments of lightheartedness and fun, along with a truly amazing soundtrack that really does make the viewer feel like they're watching a film that could have been made in the 80's- which isn't for everyone, but if you like movies like that, then this one is definitely for you.",1397347200,,660,4.7894736842105265
6198835,4,B00HR0V7YO,Lots of suspense and unexpected twist.  An all  around great movie.  I did enjoy this movie and will watch it again.,1397347200,2,116,4.428571428571429
6198836,2,B00HR0V7YO,"I had high hopes for this movie due to the number of 5 star ratings.  I should have paid attention to the one star rating that was available.

Don't get me wrong...I like b-movies in general and horror specifically, but this movie is just bad.  While apparently set in the 80's (for no apparent reason), there is little of a true 80's horror film.  The eye candy is attractive, true, but the characters are one dimensional, the acting uneven and stilted, and the plot very much needing...what's the word...oh yeah, a plot.  The few interesting elements are clearly stolen from much better movies and books.  As I almost smirked on occasion, I gave this movie two stars.

So be warned -- this is a marginal movie at best, with none of the humor or even unintentional laughs that make for a
""good"" bad move...",1397174400,5,807,4.5625
6198837,4,B00HR0V7YO,"This is a decent throwback 80s horror film. As with a lot of 80s horror films, it starts with a bunch of college kids doing one last hooray before heading into the world or back into school for a continuing education going into the forest for a weekend getaway. Of course mayhem ensues and the body count rises. This film is not suppose to be a high speed, new aged, flashy horror film like all the new stuff out there today. So to that poster who think that the other reviews are people involved with the film, that may be true, however, this film goes along the lines of great classics, like Friday the 13th, The howling, American Werewolf in London Hellraisers, etc. They are slow paced films, the 80s was big on slow paced horror films because the stories were and are better than the crap out there today where the focus is on either blood or scares and not story. This story is different, a unique take on the genre and I think it does it well. It is not without problems, most importantly, no nudity, save for one long, blurred shot. 80s films had the boobies a flying. The second issue I had, the kill scenes, though inventive, not bloody enough for me. So for me, this film is good, worth watching and its better than a 3 star, but not quite a 4. However, there are no halves here. So, in closing, this is a good throwback film, it is suppose to be slower paced, the production value is awesome, the cast was delightful, the direction was good. The negatives, no nudity and for me, not enough blood and the visual effects you could tell were low budget. Remember, it is a low budget indy film. So. watch with that in mind. You might be surprised.",1396224000,9,1655,4.341935483870968
6198838,5,B00HR0V7YO,"Loved this movie and the cast did amazing! I am not a huge horror movie person, but I really enjoyed this movie",1396224000,3,111,4.090909090909091
6198839,5,B00HR0V7YO,"Really enjoyed this film.. everything about it was top notch!  The storyline was kind of a cross between Friday the 13th and a Rabid. I really liked the filming.. was excellent with alot of fantastic scenery.  The soundtrack was really very nice and really added to the movie. The acting by these fine actors and actresses was awesome, and i thought they did a masterful job of playing their parts. Really liked the characters: Haley Derryberry Jessica Sonneborne and Hannah Landberg. All of them were quite good with their parts, and they truly added a little sexiness and sensuality to the film. There were several scenes of the attractive girls dressed very provocatively.. that was pure ""eye candy"" The Love scenes were quite nice and the wedding nightmare was at first dreamlike and then totally horrific. The film was somewhat a little slow at times, but made up for it closer to the ending. This movie I am sure would be much liked by guys and gals, had just the right amount of suspense, and scariness. Hope that Paul J. Porter decides to make more movies along these lines.. maybe he will consider making a Rabid Love Part II. AWESOME FILM!",1396051200,2,1149,4.711442786069652
6198840,1,B00HR0V7YO,"Extremely dull horror film about a bunch of college graduates vacationing in a cabin in the woods.  One of them is infected with a rabies derived virus by a mad scientist masquerading as a wild-life photographer.  The cast is likable and attractive, especially the actresses, and the frequently too on-the-nose rock songs that make up much of the soundtrack are amusing, but Rabid Love is paced like a six hour art film--it moves at a crawl and never picks up, even when the body count rises in the second half.  It's a safe guess that the two five star reviews for this film on Amazon are both fake and came from people involved with the movie--it's simply not possible to sit through Rabid Love without being thoroughly bored.",1395792000,3,728,4.671875
6198841,5,B00HR0V7YO,"If you liked the slasher movies of the 1980's, then buy a copy of ""Rabid Love"" and watch this fun movie!  You'll swear it was filmed in the mid 80's instead of 2012.  Filmed on location in Western Kansas (yes, Hodgeman County is a real place), many of the props used in the movie were borrowed from the Haun Museum in Jetmore, Kansas.  This is director Paul J. Porter's first feature film, but many of his previous short films have done very well at numerous independent film festivals.  I think ""Rabid Love"" has what it takes to become a cult classic & I love the science fiction twist added to the 80's horror formula.  Speaking of science fiction, you hard core Trekkies may recognize actor Brandon Stacey from his turn as Mr. Spock in 8 episodes of ""Star Trek, Phase II"" (formerly titled ""Star Trek, New Voyages), a fan created series.  The actors do a great job of creating their respective characters, this movie is full of new comers with star potential!!!",1395100800,3,963,4.569767441860465
8634472,1,B00HR0V7YO,"Terrible. The film starts slow and stays slow throughout even when the ""twist"" is revealed. There are a couple of moments that were well done but overall, Rabid Love is dreck. The acting sucks, and the overall story isn't good enough to actually care because some idiot thinks he's so far in front when he's actually behind. The only character I felt bad for was Hannah Landberg (Summer) and that was because her boyfriend (Josh) is a loser and no matter how hard she tried to make the relationship work, it was futile due to his suckage. But that story arc had almost nothing to do with the point of the film. Summer and Josh didn't even need to be in the story other than to increase a body count to feed a fake mystery. Maybe Rabid Love would have worked better as a survival horror film with just John, Heather and David. By the time the end credits were rolling it was so predictable what happened after the final scene because many of us have seen it too many times before. 28 Days Later, Walking Dead, Night of the Living Dead...etc. 80's nostalgia can't save this film. Great 80's films were The Lost Boys, Blade Runner and Aliens. Rabid Love is like bad 80's film, like R.O.T.O.R, The Stuff and Space Rage.  Pass on this on.",1520121600,,1233,4.431718061674009

8634481,4,B00HR0V7YO,"The story in Rabid Love hits on familiar themes, but the combined elements with the major plot creates a truly original nightmare. The beginning of the film was a little bit of a sleeper. It did feel as if the first 40 minutes lasted forever before something major happening in the storyline. It didn't seem really boring but I found myself becoming more aware that no real scares or bloody scenes had taken place yet. The first of half of the story really allows for a more emotional connection and character build for the horror to come. What makes it worth the wait it the stellar attention to retro aesthetics and one kick ass soundtrack. It plays out like a classic rock opera. Now the second and third acts in Rabid Love really amp up the action and intensity, creating a creepy almost grindhouse melancholy that is both compelling and chilling. All this rises to a fevered pitch of terrifying circumstances as the story arcs finally where the film becomes one really intense fight for survival that hits on vintage thrills of both grindhouse and psychological horror films of the late 70s and early 80s.

 Rabid Love is really a well planned and executed tribute to the heydays of classic b-movie and survival horrors. The characters are convincing, and drawn out enough to connect with without being over exaggerated. The soundtrack is truly a epic play and sets the nostalgic and entertaining tone to the film. The actually horror and bloody elements are restrained and a bit under-glorified but the effects are well done. Paul J. Porter really does show a true talent and deep love with classic horror, and the almost romantic embrace that 80s directors held for the genre. That aspect often gets left out of modern horror which tends to go for the guts and gory. I really enjoyed this film once it kicked in, and with the attention to period aesthetic- a solid story Rabid Love is well worth any horror fans attention.",1432598400,2,1929,4.721068249258161
