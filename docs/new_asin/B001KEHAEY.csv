3665595,2,B001KEHAEY,"I assumed this DVD contained episodes from The Berenstain Bears that is currently shown on PBS.  Well, it turns out it's episodes from the 80's, so the quality is fairly poor.  The stories were fine, my daughter watched all the episodes, but I'm somewhat disappointed.",1245801600,3,268,4.933333333333334
3665596,5,B001KEHAEY,"This dvd has older episodes on it, from the 80's. They are:

Messy Room
Trouble with Friends
Too Much Birthday
Go Fly a Kite
Comic Valentine (the 1982 tv special)

I love the newer episodes that are now on PBS, but really enjoyed these since I grew up watching them. Great dvd!",1232409600,32,277,4.3076923076923075

3665600,1,B001KEHAEY,"This is just awful. It looks like they tried to make a Broadway show out of the Berenstain Bears and it doesn't work. There is a lot of singing and rhyming, but not much of a story line to keep the kids interested. I'm really sorry I wasted my money on this.",1442707200,,258,3.980769230769231

3665605,5,B001KEHAEY,"I bought this for my four year old daughter who had seen a Berenstain Bear movie while in the hospital.  She loves the books and loved the movie so I found her this video.  At first she complained that it didn't look the same as the one at the hospital (apparently they had the more current series on video there).  But when she began to recognize some of the stories from the books she's read she changed her mind.  Now she loves it.  The songs are cute and I personally like the old school animation since that's what I grew up with. I also appreciate there is nothing scary about these stories since there are Disney movies she hasn't been able to sit through because they scare her too much. As soon as breakfast was over today she announced, ""I want to watch a movie, guess which one!!!"" and ran to put this in.  It is definitely worth the five dollars I paid for it and is a nice addition to her DVD collection.",1424649600,,917,4.241379310344827

3665607,5,B001KEHAEY,"This is a nice collection of episodes from the original 1980s cartoon series of The Berenstain Bears. From what I've gathered, authors Stan and Jan Berenstain were more involved in the writing of this series than the later PBS one that has become so popular. Although I've enjoyed some of the episodes of the later series, I have to say that the original series has a lot more humor and spontaneity in it. The PBS version tends to be a bit too goody-goody at times, with entertainment taking a backseat to the lesson being presented. The original series has a better balance of values, fun, and reality. A perfect example would be the ""Messy Room"" episode contained on this DVD. We see a very angry Mama Bear (dramatized by pounding up the stairs and the hallway shaking) when she gets fixated on how messy the cubs' bedroom is. Nonetheless, they work along with Papa Bear to find a practical solution to organizing after an initial false start. Likewise, the ""Too Much Birthday"" episode brings home the value of keeping celebrations simple and free of excess without being at all preachy -- through a variety of funny scenarios, Sister Bear ends up upset at how her party is turning out, before realizing she already has a lot to be thankful for.

I hope that more collections of the '80s Berenstain Bears series will surface in the future, as the episodes present a clever and humorous view of the Bear Family that is just as positive as the PBS seriesbut with considerably more wit.",1414108800,9,1485,4.6679389312977095

3665609,3,B001KEHAEY,"My toddler loves the Berenstain bears and we bought this one to play in the car on a long trip. My toddler didn't like this one as much as the other dvd's we have of the bears. I think it just wasn't the right age material for her level of comprehension. Considering I paid less than $5 I am pleased with it. It's an older dvd which I knew prior to purchasing. I think she will come to like it better as she gets older, but maybe not the best selection for a 2yr old. Older children might enjoy it a little more than my daughter.",1398729600,,529,4.0

3665612,5,B001KEHAEY,I like the lessons taught in this video. My grandchildren love the bears and their family. TThey watch this video over and over again,1381968000,,133,4.583333333333333
3665613,5,B001KEHAEY,I've been trying to find dvd's for our grandchildren who are ages 1-9 (13 of them and one more on the way).  Even the kid dvd's that are supposed to be for their age group are not what I'd like to show them.  These have great morals and our grandkids love the books so they already know what to expect.  I'm trilled to find a good quality dvd with good morals.,1378080000,,360,4.042253521126761
3665614,5,B001KEHAEY,Parents please make sure your preschoolers are watching the Bernstein bears--these sweet cartoons always teach a strong moral lesson in a way that my kids find engaging and funny:).  They also instill a strong sense of love and family not commonly found in other cartoons. Much better than sponge bob for impressionable young minds:),1364515200,2,333,5.166666666666667

3665616,1,B001KEHAEY,"Based on the cover of the DVD I assumed this was the same rendition as the current show.  NOT the case.  This was made I can't ascertain how long ago, but the quality is horrific, the characters are poorly drawn with different voices.  My 2 year old refuses to watch it so waste of money.

Do not recommend; Caveat emptor with this misleading product.",1334880000,,351,4.4375
3665617,3,B001KEHAEY,"This video is cute and my kids love it.  It seems a little outdated since it is from the 80's, but the lessons are still true today and my son has really taken an interest in hockey since watching this one!  Although, Mama Bear seems to need a little more patience with her kids sometimes!  Definitely from a few decades ago :)",1312848000,,327,4.241935483870968
3665618,3,B001KEHAEY,"This is a good collection, but the box is misleading.  The episodes featured are from 1977ish through the early 1980s.  Even though they looked ""strange"", according to my daughters, the girls still sat through the entire DVD a few times already.  I like the fact that they get to understand that the Berenstain Bears have been around for a very long time, and they get to experience both what their parents used to watch and then the more modern episodes that they watch.  It's a little of the old and a little of the new.

The episodes seem a little longer than current episodes that air.",1301529600,2,589,4.518867924528302
3665619,2,B001KEHAEY,"The ""episodes"" on this video are not like the others we have. They have very old looking animation and the voices aren't the same  as the newer ones. In my opinion, they really aren't done very well. There are some good lessons in them, as like in the other videos we have, but there are also some quite mean characters that say things I wouldn't want my children to say. I really like a lot of the other Berenstain Bear videos, and have a number of them, but this is one I wouldn't recommend. I think it's more about being rude and than about kindness and caring.",1294790400,3,564,4.271028037383178
3665620,5,B001KEHAEY,We have now almost ALL the Berenstain Bears DVDs.  I see a lot of people are disappointed in the old ones...but my kids love them anyway.  And so do I.  I remember the old ones when I was a kid (or at least the theme song).  They may be a bit different...but they're still really good!!  May have different voices...but my kids don't care.  They enjoy the old songs just as much.  So...give these older ones a chance.  We did and we're glad of it.  :),1273017600,9,451,4.151162790697675
3665621,5,B001KEHAEY,I ordered this for my mother to have at her house for grandchildren. She says they came in good shape and is glad they were available to order online as she couldn't find them anywhere.  Thank you,1270598400,3,196,4.297297297297297
3665622,2,B001KEHAEY,"If you're looking for the Berestain Bears your little one watches on sprout/pbs, this is not it. We were so excited to find this and sat down to watch only to be disappointed. The characters are more extreme than the tv ones, the verbal interaction is less thought out, and they don't necessarily represent the good relationships and interpersonal interactions that the tv show does. We didn't even finish the dvd,bottom line, my son didn't like it.",1266278400,4,449,4.8441558441558445

8314855,4,B001KEHAEY,"These are the older episodes with different voices and slightly different character drawings than the newer episodes. Still great values just not what the kiddos are used to seeing on tv right now.

Now she will have her own friend to play with. Sister goes to play with the new girl but problems arise when they are both too bossy and can't agree on anything.

Too much birthday-Sister is having a birthday party. Before long the party turns into a huge affair with lots of kids, a pony and more. Sister gets upset when she can't have the prize for winning the game since it is her party. She starts to think the party is a big mess and then learns to appreciate all she does have instead of what she thinks she is missing.

go fly a kite - the cubs want to enter a kite contest so they go get material to make a kite. Papa comes along and decides they need to make their kite bigger and better. Papa makes the kite so big it won't fly in the contest.",1459814400,3,1600,4.195439739413681
