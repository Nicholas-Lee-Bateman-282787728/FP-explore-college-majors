5004935,5,B006MHZH5I,"I have seen Sebastian Maniscalco ""What's Wrong With People"" at least a dozen times and every time I laugh with no hesitation. You cannot grow old on this DVD. You cannot imange how well the material is and Sebastian performance. He captures the true images of what we all see on go through as we encounter and live through life. The ""sandwich line"", ""friends coming over to vist"" and the ""dancing and nightclub"" comedy presentations were truly priceless. The best money you will ever spend on a DVD. I am so happy that we have Sebastian who delivers a clean and hilarious comedy. His ""presenation"" and ""movements""  not just dialogue deliver a GREAT show. I have purchased 8 of these and have given them out as presents. All and I mean all have given 5 stars. I look forward to seeing him soon at our local comedy club and we have a group of 25 people ready to go. I hope he does many of the comedy routines from this DVD.
Enjoy you will not be disappointed
This DVD is hard to top",1335312000,4,980,4.355191256830601
5004936,5,B006MHZH5I,"The 411 by Maria:
I do love laughing. It is one of my favorite things to do. Laugh lines mean nothing to me as long as I am having a good time. Personally, I watch a lot of stand up. My husband is not into it so usually it is when I can't sleep and he is already sleeping. The comedy station is even saved on my Sirius Radio so I can laugh while driving. Sebastian is all about expressions. I love his face while he is telling jokes. He doesn't rely on vulgar language to be funny (not that I am opposed but I know a lot of people are). Sebastian is very animated and likeable. He plays to the audience without using them. His standup is based on his observations and if only we could all be this funny in our daily life, people wouldn't need meds to get through their day. Laugh a little people! Some of the show about company: So funny and so true!",1335225600,,850,4.035502958579881
5004937,5,B006MHZH5I,"I actually have seen Sebastian's live performances several times and they have always been cutting edge and full of laughs.  That being said, I believe a true testimony to a  how funny a comedian is, that after seeing a performance live, you're still compelled to shell out a few bucks so you can replay it at will.  That's why I've given out 5 stars and I'd bet you will too.",1332892800,,376,4.3428571428571425
5004938,5,B006MHZH5I,"The funniest stand up ive seen since robin williams on broadway. Saw him in Austin tx, used different material and was just great. Favorite comedian hands down.",1332806400,,160,4.962962962962963
5004939,5,B006MHZH5I,"""What's Wrong With People?"" is a hilarious set that nearly everyone can relate to. It's one of the funniest specials I've seen (in addition to his last one). Sebastian seems so effortlessly funny, not just with what he says, but also with his expressions and timing. ""What's Wrong With People?"" is consistently funny from beginning to end. Everyone I've showed it to loves it. If you get a chance, check out Sebastian live and he'll have you dying of laughter.",1332633600,,460,4.7625
5004940,5,B006MHZH5I,"Sebastian Maniscalco has the gift! Echoing some of the other reviews here, he truly makes you laugh! You can relate to his stories and how funny we must have been to others back in the day! Bravo Mr Maniscalco, Bravo!",1332633600,,217,4.45
5004941,5,B006MHZH5I,I saw Sebastian for the first time on his Showtime comedy special and I was laughing from his first sentence.  His take on everyday occurrences and his observations are dead on and so darn hilarious. His voice changes and body language are just part of the whole treat. I would love to see him in person.  Funniest comedian and clean (meaning no foul language) in a long time.,1332547200,,376,4.514705882352941
5004942,5,B006MHZH5I,"We DVR'd this back in January when it originally aired, and everytime someone comes over to our house, we make them watch it, and everyone cracks up the whole time! No joke, we've probably watched it 10 times, and laugh just as hard as we did the first time.  It doesn't get old! We find ourselves saying, ""Oh my God, that's so true!!"" throughout the whole thing!  Sebastian's facial expressions are priceless, and the things he says are spot on.  I even find us, along with our friends, quoting this on a daily basis :-). We saw him live a few years back, and it's that side-splitting, painful, no-noise-coming-out-because-you're-laughing-so-hard laugh, LoL
Sebastian, you are hilarious!",1330905600,2,688,4.965217391304348

5005112,5,B006MHZH5I,"It was through his half hour special on Comedy Central that I first discovered Sebastian Maniscalco. It's tricky for me to describe his humor (beyond the words ""witty and sarcastic""), but between his Italian/Brooklyn accent and the way he tells a story always leaves me crying with laughter. He's not overly raunchy like Dane Cook, nor is he super mellow like Demetri Martin. He's not a total dork like Brian Regan, nor is he a country bumpkin like the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. This is a guy who seems to have been born and raised on the city streets--just trying to play it cool and keep up with the times, while also lamenting over the fact that the world has changed drastically since he was a kid--for better or worse.

In this special, Sebastian talks about a wide range of topics, from growing up in an Italian household, to impressing dates at dance clubs, to the dualistic dance of deciding who's going to pick up the bill at a restaurant. His stories are completely relatable, while also pointing out the weirdness and stupidity of both modern technology and people in general. Some of my favorite bits include his struggle to teach his elderly dad how to send an email; him pondering the thought process of how Michael Jackson designed his weird stage outfits, and how the movie ""Purple Rain"" changed his life.

To say any more would be to spoil the whole show. You'll just have to give him a watch and see for yourself...then lose your breath from laughing. It's a shame, as well as a mystery, as to why his name isn't as well known as the above mentioned comedians, because he's arguably just as funny; maybe even funnier. It's time he got the recognition he deserves. Give his specials (including this one) a listen; you won't be disappointed.",1463184000,8,1756,4.643086816720257

5005135,5,B006MHZH5I,"Sebastian Maniscalco - A Genius Conductor of orchestrating LOL!

In 2016, the World of Comedy is filled with Ethnic humor, Improv, Open mike, Lewd, Roasts, Stand-up, LGBT, Urban, Racial Insult, and other genres.

Whereas, Sebastian has created his own genre with a perfect G-Rated formula that Stands Up on its own and does not rely on artificial sweeteners.

A huge fan of Sebastian since 2009, it became obvious that this is a well-orchestrated comedy event from someone who is a master and surgical observer of the Human Condition, as it relates to our interesting home and public behavior patterns.
While at the same time reminding us of his immigrant family, which most Americans hail from but have lost sight of their own immigrant family at the entry port of call NYC location, named Ellis island.

Maniscalco is a master Story Teller, who has a brilliant ability to turn on and off his facial, eye animations and body movements in a subtle manner that not only amplifies his character, but, elevates his comedy to a Shakespearean level.

Yes, he is a pure Genius, because this ACT demands real Brain Power!
Sebastian creates, writes and produces his own comedy material.
His keen observations of every-day typical human behavior and interactions, are so superbly-crafted that it leaves you hungry for more.
His Real Comedy material is so profound that you find yourself identifying and drawn into his genius Story lines, and watching it again.
Ive watched all three videos over and over again ... Yes they are all that 5-Star good, and cant wait for the next one.

In one of my favorite movies, Gladiator, played by Spaniard (Russell Crowe), would stand in the center of the Colosseum, before the cheers and accolades from the Public and shout back ... Am I Not Entertaining? ... it is what Sebastian does but within a more refined, subtle delivery of impeccable note. Ciao!

Just from his comment that putting in 'self service checkouts' at the grocery store says that they say 'hey, now YOU can do it' because they have ""given up"" is hilarious. His bit on this is awesome, like many of the rest of his comic bits on this.  The other stuff on how Italians are not the best sports players as well as his bits on 'the kids' are gems, and will keep you laughing for most of the night, and will 'remind' you of funny stuff in your own life.

He seems like (at least in his act) that is a decent guy with a good upbringing and that comes out in how he looks at the world around him.  Just a normal guy, not shocking, not rude. There are plenty of comedians out there that can curse non stop if you want that.

Love the Italian in him.  That is his schtick: Italian guy from and nice family and this is how he sees the world.  This video (or really any of his videos) are not for kids because it is adult situation comedy.  There is only light cursing, if that, but nothing you couldn't show grandma.

I especially connected with the road rage bit, the company coming over to visit bit, and the way kids are not brought up like we were bit.

The only thing I didn't like was that the DVD forces you to watch ads for other comedians and you can't skip over it.  I don't like to pay for commercials.",1390953600,,445,4.1395348837209305

Absolutley HILARIOUS. I couldn't stop laughing. I even started laughing before he said his punch line because I knew what was coming! If this comedian EVER comes to Kansas City, I don't care how much the tickets are . . . . . I will be sitting in a seat in one of the 1st two rows. His voice, facial expressions, timing, material, antics, body movements are the best. I've seen many comedy acts. This is by far the BEST BEST BEST.

Of course it's been done before, but it's done better here. Another appeal to many people is that Maniscalco doesn't really rely on crude or vulgar material to get a laugh, he doesn't need it because he's genuinely funny. I streamed this and then I bought the DVD, and then purchased it on digital download - it's that funny.",1371945600,,463,4.590361445783133
5005329,5,B006MHZH5I,"Maniscalco is one of two of my favorite comedians not many know about, alongside Russell Peters. This guy facial expressions, presentation, and body movements give and extra heavy punch to his dialogue. Myself, being a person who doesn't use profanity often in their vocabulary and can tell what's funny and laugh and what's not, this guy made me smile, giggle, laugh, and cry of laughter. He only used the F word once through the whole presentation, so I can see this with anyone of any age. He's able to take everyday scenarios in the public world and add great humor to how bothered he gets with people. Great performance.
