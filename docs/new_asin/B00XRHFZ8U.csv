8716524,1,B00XRHFZ8U,"I know that Lord Grade (as producer) has been jokingly referred to as ""Low"" Grade and I knew that Barbara Cartland is supposed to be absolute dreck, but, even given that, this 'film' is so much worse than I expected considering some of the talent involved. Diana Rigg does seem to consciously add a bit of camp to the proceedings and has some very amusing (intentionally? maybe not) lines, but it's a shame that former Avengers writer/producer Albert Fennell couldn't come up with something more worthy of her considering the great genuine wit of that series. We even have music by Avengers composer Laurie Johnson. And one of the New Avengers has a nice little cameo. The dialogue, which I am assuming, comes full-blown from the pen of Cartland (all I can think about is that great Little Britain sketch with Matt Lucas in drag churning out yet another bad formulaic assembly-line bodice-ripper) is some of the most atrocious, clich, and insipid I have heard in years. I thought they, thankfully, stopped making movies this bad some time in the 1930s. Some of the apparently clueless women who love this sort of coded 'romance' novel and who claim to swoon over the spoiled brat control freaks (not far removed from Cristian Gray) that supposedly pass for men in this odious world of 'romance' are just mind-boggling at not recognizing abusive behavior for what it is. It's anything but romantic.",1444953600,,1397,4.849372384937238
