I found this video very helpful in illustrating how to choose, shape, grow, display, prune, wire, and fertilize your own bonsai. The video also  discusses how to mix your own bonsai soil, how to treat diseased bonsai, what tools you need to buy to begin caring for your bonsai, and how to choose the right pot to display your bonsai. I think this video, along with a good comprehensive bonsai book are a necessity for the beginner. More advanced bonsai growers might find the information on pruning the roots and creating bends in your bonsai's trunk helpful as well.  This video does not provide an extensive overview on various bonsai plants and it does not make you an expert overnight; only experience teaches you how to become proficient in the techniques of bonsai (one is never truly an expert :-).

Note: I would also recommend that the beginner attend a bonsai class (if you can find one in your area), because it is always nice to ask a live person any questions that you might have. I have attended classes, bought books, watched videos, visited bonsai websites, and sought information from my local nursery; these resources have all been helpful in my study of the art, techniques, and care of bonsai. Good Luck!!",1276992000,,1313,4.724890829694323

Dan Barton, Harry Tomlinson, and Colin Lewis do a tremendous job of explaining duties that need to be done, daily, weekly and seasonally. I can only hope this vid will be rereleased in DVD format soon!",1219622400,,271,4.787234042553192
