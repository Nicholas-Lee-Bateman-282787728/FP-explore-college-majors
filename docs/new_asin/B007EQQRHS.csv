5079692,1,B007EQQRHS,Not worth your time.  Stopped it midway and gave up after I realized they were repeatedly saying the same thing.  Little weird.,1375660800,,127,4.7272727272727275
5079693,2,B007EQQRHS,"amature ,should have known when i saw unauthorized...ripoff..just people talking redundantly about the Bruno we have already seen,nothing other side about it...",1373760000,,160,6.318181818181818
5079694,2,B007EQQRHS,Bio was lame...I could have done a better job. Not what I was expecting need more down to earth aspects of Bruno's life.,1373760000,,120,4.260869565217392
5079695,1,B007EQQRHS,This poorly constructed film contains material that is a contradiction to information that is available in other (free) videos where the artist himself speaks. The production quality is poor and the people who are interviewed are not identified as to what role they play (if any) in the artist's career/life. Not worth the time or money.,1365465600,3,337,5.035714285714286
5079696,4,B007EQQRHS,"Yes i would recommend this cd, sounds so good. i bought 2 of his cd's and they both sound pretty good. thank u",1364774400,2,110,3.8260869565217392
5079697,3,B007EQQRHS,I was disappointed because I ordered it expecting to see him perform. I guess I misread it. Does he have any dvd of him performing?,1364601600,4,131,4.28
5079698,2,B007EQQRHS,Not a well done documentary.  Unprofessional constantly repeated itself wrapped time fanes in an awkward manner.  Not a serious work.,1363046400,,133,5.6
5079699,1,B007EQQRHS,"This video was repetitive and gave no real insight to his past, present, or future.  Save your money. I'm sending it back.",1362700800,13,122,4.545454545454546
5079700,5,B007EQQRHS,The man is just an amazing talent. It doesn't hurt he's good looking. He plays multiple instruments writes songs for himself and others.  He is multi talented and has a big career ahead of him.,1361923200,,193,4.514285714285714
5079701,1,B007EQQRHS,"I love Bruno Mars so was looking for an interesting Documentary.  This is not it.  It is a slide show of photos with some women telling his story.  You learn nothing more than the decription says. There is 'no' other side of Bruno Mars on this video.  It is everything that any Bruno fan already knows.  He was born/raised in Hawaii went to LA to follow his dream of becoming famous.  Signed with Motown, meet Lawrence, wrote and sold songs and likes to keep his private life private.  So no interview on here,nothing really interesting at all. Very misleading and disappointing.  Save your money and purchase Bruno's music!",1344988800,42,624,4.712962962962963

5079703,5,B007EQQRHS,"Enjoyed learning about his life, assume they couldn't include music performances due to the unauthorized nature of the film.",1461715200,,124,5.578947368421052

5079706,1,B007EQQRHS,Did he even get consulted on this? Just completely relooped to the same conversation,1457654400,,84,5.071428571428571

Bruno Mars is very talented and deserves all his success quite an inspiration to the upcoming music want to bees.

5079712,1,B007EQQRHS,No actual Bruno singing.,1453507200,,24,5.25
5079713,1,B007EQQRHS,Thought it would be more music do not care about his life.  Love his music.,1443484800,,75,4.0
5079714,1,B007EQQRHS,"Disappointing. Why the writer or director had people recap what was discusses was questionable. Also, who are they?",1443225600,,115,5.444444444444445
5079715,1,B007EQQRHS,"No music just an often repeated narration. No one of importance was interviewed, including the subject himself.",1441238400,,111,5.588235294117647
5079716,5,B007EQQRHS,Great,1440374400,,5,5.0
5079717,1,B007EQQRHS,It was an unofficial doc which did not have any comments from the singer himself or authorized music.  Not impressed.,1440115200,,117,4.85
5079718,1,B007EQQRHS,This is a terrible documentary.  Do not watch it.,1439251200,,49,4.444444444444445
5079719,1,B007EQQRHS,The interviewee's spoke as if they have no connection to Bruno Mars and were just hired to read a script. VERY boring!!!!,1439251200,,121,4.545454545454546
5079720,3,B007EQQRHS,I was expecting a show where there would be some Bruno Mars music or him singing some of his songs.  It was all about information about Bruno Mars and no songs.  There was music in the background but not his music.  The information about him was sort of interesting but had I known there was not going to be his music I would not have watched.,1437696000,,343,4.166666666666667
5079721,1,B007EQQRHS,"Not what I was expecting.  The interviews were horrible,  narrator would say his view,  then interviewees will just repeat what narrator had just said... Very poorly done.",1436832000,,171,5.2592592592592595
5079722,3,B007EQQRHS,"Okay... Good 1st-hand information about the artist, although video seems somewhat amateur. Interesting nevertheless...",1433376000,,118,7.5
5079723,1,B007EQQRHS,"Very poorly done just like the other Bruno Mars DVD sold on amazon.  Poor picture, poor sound.",1432598400,,94,4.529411764705882

5079725,1,B007EQQRHS,Pretty terrible documentary that repeats the same information over and over,1429574400,,75,5.909090909090909
5079726,3,B007EQQRHS,Was very interesting. I know it was unauthorized but I would have loved to hear him sing.,1429142400,,89,4.294117647058823

5079742,1,B007EQQRHS,Too boring an not enough presentation of his music.,1411344000,,51,4.777777777777778
5079743,1,B007EQQRHS,It sounds like it's someone reading his Wikipedia page over video clips or something.  Very strange find on Amazon.  The quality was that of a high school film project.,1410652800,,168,4.758620689655173
5079744,5,B007EQQRHS,Good,1410652800,,4,4.0
5079745,2,B007EQQRHS,Boring.,1409961600,,7,7.0

5079747,1,B007EQQRHS,"Jus not a good documentary at all, poorly made not worth any money for sure, so glad I didn't pay anything",1403395200,,106,4.095238095238095
5079748,1,B007EQQRHS,Was not at all what I was thinking. Unauthorized for sure. I had to stop it after 5 minutes. Not worth my time.,1402876800,,111,3.869565217391304
5079749,5,B007EQQRHS,An excellent inside story of Bruno's rise to success. Definitely worth the time to watch. Love all his music and look forward to watching his career grow to the likes of Prince.,1401667200,,177,4.5625
5079750,3,B007EQQRHS,I like Bruno and this was an okay production about his life and growth in his career. Would have been disappointed if I had to pay for it. It was amateurish but interesting to learn about his music career.,1398211200,,205,4.282051282051282
5079751,1,B007EQQRHS,"This was a biography that anyone could have done by themselves with a little research.  It was redundant, information was given by one person and then repeated by another.  I would have loved to hear some of his music. The pictures were repeated over and over again.  Who were these people who were talking about him?  What makes them experts?  It was a very amateur production, done in a hurry.  No wonder it was unauthorized!",1393545600,,427,4.626666666666667
5079752,2,B007EQQRHS,U didn't learn anything new disappointing :( I think what I ststed was enough. Don't. Need to write a book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1393027200,,126,5.35
5079753,2,B007EQQRHS,I have to say that this was very disappointing. Parts were rushed and I felt as though many essential things that I would liek to know about Bruno Mars were omitted. Not worth the effort.,1391904000,,187,4.371428571428571
5079754,3,B007EQQRHS,"it a great movie, the creation of the movie was great, the setting was perfect. the actors were on point.",1382313600,,105,4.3
5079755,1,B007EQQRHS,"It's a shame,Bruno Mars is so talented but this documentary is terribly bad. The only 3 people that was interviewed was saying the same m e thing over and over plus the narrator. You would think they will interview more considering his entourage.",1381536000,,246,4.744186046511628
5079756,1,B007EQQRHS,It's not even clear who is being interviewed about Bruno Mars in this video.  Who says they're qualified to give accurate information.  And video clips play in the background that are often unrelated to anything the narrator is saying.  I'm very sorry I wasted 2.99 on the rental.  My time would have been better spent surfing the internet for information about Bruno Mars.,1379462400,3,373,4.873015873015873
5079757,1,B007EQQRHS,Do not waste your time on this stupid movie with the irrelevant people repetitive facts and old out of date information,1378512000,,119,4.714285714285714
5079758,3,B007EQQRHS,"It was ok, but expected more ""Bruno"" & less people I've never heard of. Thought there would at least be some performance video clips.",1377388800,,133,4.583333333333333
5079759,1,B007EQQRHS,The entire film is a series of interviews edited and repeated constantly by unknown friends etc. of Bruno Mars.  There is some footage of his early days peformaning but none of his current performances.  I gave my copy to the Salvation Army after viewing it.  To say I was dissappointed is an understatement!,1377043200,3,308,4.773584905660377
5079760,2,B007EQQRHS,"I order this bio because I love Bruno music. I am No Fanatic like most. I have seen him live. His live shows are of the best I have seen. Unfortunately, this dvd is in a third party interpretation. There are like 2 people who they interview that say they know Bruno life story is. Suppose they have encounter him at one time or another-I guess. The voice over is lame. They take most over Bruno's music vids; other interview; and performance footage during the voice over often in a continual loop. They do show some shots of his family, who he got his nickname from, family store, & when he was little. However was not a good documentary. There is little known about the guy maybe because he values his privacy, Or maybe, he's waiting to tell his story when he's ready. I hope it's soon there's got to be something better to pay tribute to him than this. It came in a timely mater. I doubt it was worth price I paid. Came in good condition. Skip it.",1376352000,,950,4.283333333333333
8515419,4,B007EQQRHS,This was interesting but I didn't feel like they showed enough of Bruno Mars singing,1486598400,,84,4.666666666666667
8515420,3,B007EQQRHS,Not what I expected to see,1486166400,,26,3.5
8515421,5,B007EQQRHS,Wow!,1483315200,,4,4.0
8515422,4,B007EQQRHS,Entertaining,1482192000,,12,12.0
8515423,5,B007EQQRHS,A must see!,1481155200,,11,3.0
8515424,1,B007EQQRHS,THERE IS NO SONGS ON THIS WHOLE PRODUCTION. NO MUSIC AT ALL.,1479340800,,60,4.083333333333333
8515425,2,B007EQQRHS,Sort of accurate?,1475539200,,17,5.0
8515426,5,B007EQQRHS,Loved it,1469577600,,8,3.5
8515427,1,B007EQQRHS,This was not great and I didn't think any of the info was true. Maybe it was but it seemed like all second and third hand information. Not worth your money. You can learn more about Bruno on You Tube from his own mouth.,1466380800,,219,4.0
8515428,1,B007EQQRHS,No performance footage.  Terrible sound mix.  Ad hoc script.  Unknown talent.,1465948800,,77,5.818181818181818
