1239859,5,B00000K13T,"Great film, one of those rare finds...It is a love story but not a ""chick flick"" at all...a fair view from both male and female eyes regarding love and infidelity....thought provoking but not re: morality...just life and human mistakes and redemption...perfectly done

Should not be missed!",1157241600,,290,5.304347826086956
1239860,4,B00000K13T,"True, the plot of TWICE UPON A YESTERDAY, a british movie directed by Mar&iacute;a Ripoll in 1998, will ring a bell in you. If reviewers have already pointed out that the screenplay of SLIDING DOORS ( also a 1998 movie ) is very similar to Rafa Russo's TUY screenplay, I've personnally thought about GROUNDHOG DAY while watching the movie. But who cares after all, only counts the result.
I didn't like so much the first third of the movie, fearing the worst after two or three so so scenes of comedy implying Douglas Henshall who plays the main character. But as soon as Victor Bukowski, rejected into the past, is trying to fight against destiny in order to keep Lena Headey at his side, the movie gains a new dimension.
Mar&iacute;a Ripoll could have chosen to stay in the comedy field but has preferred the tragi-comedy domain, a domain very difficult to master. So TWICE UPON A YESTERDAY becomes then a little pearl of melancholy and nostalghia about love and missed opportunities. Of course, the (late) apparition of Pen&eacute;lope Cruz cannot but elevate the level of the film (word of a fan!).
As bonus features, only a trailer and different subtitles. Sound and images OK.
A DVD zone Pen&eacute;lope reserved shelf.",1020297600,3,1225,4.81042654028436
1239861,2,B00000K13T,"Another completely contrived and silly British film along the lines of Sliding Doors. What if you had done something differently? In this case, a man in a long-term relationship is having an affair with a co-worker in the theatre where he is an actor. He decides he is going to leave his girlfriend for the actress, so when the girlfriend confronts him about his affair, he says, yes he did have the affair. She is devastated and leaves him. He ends up alone, and his now ex-girlfriend meets a new man at her gym, and they are about to get married. He tries to stop her, but fails. He meets some strange men who put him back to the day when he decided to tell the girlfriend about the affair to see if he could change things if he did everything differently. He decides not to tell her about the affair and puts an end to the affair and starts to change his life. As it turns out, she still meets the man at the gym and she has an affair with him before finally leaving the boyfriend for the guy at the gym. So the actor is left alone again, but he meets a girl (Penelope Cruz) and suddenly realises that he has really found the right woman for him. And his life changes dramatically. He gets a part on a television show, wins rave reviews, and has an outstanding love life. But Cruz is not satisfied because it still seems to her that he is holding back, still hung up on the ex girlfriend. Eventually the ex girlfriend calls him and wants to try to get back together again, but by this time he realises that Cruz is the one for him. Really just a contrived story. Nothing worth seeing because chances are you have seen it all before, done better.",1004832000,6,1648,4.268370607028754
1239862,4,B00000K13T,"This was a movie, had it been listed in a tv-guide sort of thing, I wouldn't have watched. Flipping through all the HBO channels one dreary afternoon, and happened across ""Twice Upon A Yesterday."" For the most part, foreign films have never really interested me. But I thought I'd give this one a chance, as I had nothing else to do that day. Much to my delight, this unhearalded film was really quite good. I'd barely heard of Penelope Cruz, and wasn't at all familiar with the rest of the cast and crew. But I found the movie struck some cords, some sweet, some bittersweet, but overall an excellent balance of both. I found I could relate to the characters as they were portrayed, and it required little suspension of belief on my part. I was entranced with/by this movie. It's one of the better movies I've seen in a long time (this coming from a well-jaded amateur movie critic). It managed to be an entertaining comment on life without being too preachy. For this genre of movie, I would recommend without reservation!",982886400,21,1024,4.601092896174864
1239863,5,B00000K13T,"This whole movie is good.  It's not often you can sit through a movie and not get a least a little bored, but this one keeps you interested.  The main character, Vincent, gets a chance to go back in time and fix a relationship he messed up with the woman he thought was his soulmate.  Things change for him, but sometimes we find that GETTING the desires of our heart are worse than NOT getting them.  Penelope Cruz is great in this film, and she's so sweet that you can understand how easy it would be to fall for her.  Definitely a good date movie.",979862400,19,550,4.2

1239865,4,B00000K13T,"I am a secret admirer of British Romantic Comedy because it is so much less sappy than the american hollywood dish and the stories seem to be much wittier.  Case in point would be a lovely movie like Twice Upon a Yesterday  where the character roles are very strong and the story is an intriguing  twist upon a tried and true love plot.  I enjoy the fact that this is not a  love story about enemies and resulting vengeance, neglect, sadness, or hate  -- but really about love, friendship, caring, and understanding.  And good  people shine: Penelope Cruz is all sweetness.",952473600,15,573,4.603960396039604

Speaking as one who has had many meaningful relationships that eventually played out only to be questioned as to why at a later time, this movie is spot on!

I have a penchant to remember the good times and pretend the less than good times never happened. But, fortunately when I stop and think why a particular ""perfect"" relationship didn't pan out, I am able to remember why [without mystical assistance].

1239940,5,B00000K13T,"This movie was a totally brand new story that should have been told a million times.

This movie was so sweet and full of emotion.  The main emotions were regret and longing for what could have been and what should have been.  And the hurt of losing someone, and the pain of knowing that it is all your fault that you lost it all, because you did something that you can't take back.  The message at the end is about appreciating what you have while you have it, instead of appreciating it after it is gone and it is too late.

And this movie has time travel, which I love, but it is very subtle.
There is Fate, which is always there in time travel movies, with the reality that some things are meant to be, and no matter what you do to try to change it, whatever is supposed to happen must happen.

There is a twist at the middle that was so surprising and so different, and then there is another twist at the end that is bittersweet.

There is also the theory of ""what goes around comes around"" when the characters realize that what they did to someone later gets done to them.

The ending was sad and happy at the same time, and it made me feel good.

SPOILER ALERT..

Victor was in love with Sylvia. But he began having an affair with Carol, a woman he worked with.  He suddenly thinks that he is in love with Carol, so he confesses to Sylvia that he has been cheating. Sylvia breaks up with Victor.

Victor is free to be with Carol, but then their relationship fizzles out. Victor realizes that he has loved only Sylvia all along, and he decides to get her back. But, Victor finds out that Sylvia has moved on and is about to marry Dave, a guy that she met at the gym.  Victor asks Sylvia for a second chance, but Sylvia is determined to marry Dave.

Victor spends the night out alone in the rain with a broken umbrella that is given to him, kicking himself for messing up what he had, which he didn't appreciate until he lost it.  Victor meets two men who somehow push him back in time, back to the moment just before he destroyed his relationship with Sylvia.

Victor has a second chance with Sylvia, and he tries to get everything right this time. But Fate is always there in time travel stories.  Sylvia meets Dave at the gym.  Victor is afraid that Sylvia will want to be with Dave and tries to keep them apart.

The first twist happens when Sylvia is now the one to cheat on Victor. Sylvia has an affair with Dave and confesses to Victor that she has been cheating and she leaves him.

Victor is broken hearted once again, but this time, he meets Louise, and they fall in love.

Victor and Louise are about to get married.

The second twist happens when Sylvia realizes that she wants Victor back. Sylvia goes to Victor to ask if they can try again, but Victor tells Sylvia that he loves Louise and is going to marry her.

Someone gives Sylvia the same broken umbrella that Victor had, and Sylvia goes out alone in the rain, full of the regret that she wants back what she threw away, what she didn't appreciate until she lost it.  Sylvia meets the same two men that Victor met.  At the very end, Sylvia smiles hopefully, and we realize that Sylvia is about to go back in time to the moment just before she destroyed her relationship with Victor, and the story is about to twist again, and then the credits roll.",1441756800,4,3322,4.2768

You decide. The very last scene did leave me in a position of uncertainty about what the main female character was so happy to hear. Perhaps, that is the intent. To leave us wondering what is next.

1240005,4,B00000K13T,"Enjoyable 'time travel' tale of mistakes trying to be rectified.  As usual Lena Headey gives a fine performance, would recommend it for some 'light' entertainment.",1353888000,,163,5.52
1240006,5,B00000K13T,"It would be nigh on impossible to mistake Notting Hill for La Mancha, unless perhaps you paused to notice a despondent lover raging against the rain with a ratty old umbrella for a shield.  First things first, for you fans of Penlope Cruz: patience will be rewarded.  (I'm glad I had not read any reviews, because her relatively late arrival created a suspense worth enduring and which I won't spoil.)  The story pays overt homage to Cervantes with a hero no less foolish but better favored by Fate than the delusional Don.  When struggling actor Victor is given a second chance at love, he naturally assumes that the point is to make right the selfish errors of his romantic past.  Wrong.  Gradually, with large helpings of irony and comedy, Victor begins to see that destiny has very different plans for him and his presumed Dulcinea.  This is where Cruz, at last, comes into the picture.  Victor finally *gets* it, finds his true muse and thrives.  The movie wraps with Victor collaborating with Fate to give his his ex the same kind of much-needed second chance he had to understand what's important.  Everyone ends up, exactly where they need to be to see what they need to learn.  This is a good story well played.",1297555200,6,1220,4.654205607476635
1240007,2,B00000K13T,This movie was very slow paced. It could of easily been a 30 minute show. I was very disappointed in it! Do not waste your time and money on it!!,1283990400,,145,3.8666666666666667
1240008,5,B00000K13T,This is a fun movie- and makes a lot more dramtic sense than you might think. It has unexpected twists. Yes there is the fantasy of going back to fix what went wrong in a relationship- but even though the fix happens the result is different from what is expected.  But it is only on the second viewing that I caght the idea that the reason for the 'time travel' was to enable our main character to escape from 'enchantment'- and that the analogy was a literary one drawn from Don Quixote. In a way the real theme is about what happens when one is willing to chnage and to learn.  Does our hero get what he desires in the end? NO- and yes.,1234224000,2,638,4.137096774193548
1240009,4,B00000K13T,"If you love Lena Heady, Penelope Cruz~and British humor, you will enjoy this film. It is a comical yet salty depiction of love, when love is squandered by ""greener grasses"". Taken to the edge of what lovers tolerate as acceptable and unacceptable nuances, fate cleverly steps in as an unstoppable force for Lena, Penelope, and their mutual lover. Lena and Penelope play intelligent, assertive and aspiring professionals, attempting to keep their emotional vulnerability at bay. They hold their own as their mutual lover comically unravels his affectations and steps up to the plate of true love.",1227052800,,595,5.208333333333333
1240010,5,B00000K13T,"This is a very enjoyable romantic movie. It's about a guy named Victor who gets a second chance to make his relationship work though a magic spell, only to have it all fall apart anyway. Along the way, he meets someone new (the Penelope Cruz character). The ending is especially interesting. On the one hand, the lead up makes it seem like he might end up with his original girlfriend, only to have him reject her and stay with the new girl. However, the same people who helped Victor magically have a second chance find his rejected girlfriend, thus hinting that it might not be the end of the story.",1215475200,4,601,4.472727272727273

Boy loses girl, boy reboots and loses her again to the same competitor, girl gets bored with the competitor and finds boy newly involved, then meets Donkey Hottie for her own implied reboot.  Point remains that it is monogamy itself which is inherently contradictory for human relations, regardless of magical reboots (as further demonstrated by the felony thefts in the 57% of all ""marriages"" divorce racketeering industry in violation of Article XIII of the US Constitution Amendments which prohibits ownership of any American citizen by any other and can't be waived as a fundamental human right NOT to be owned).
