8216198,4,B000V0WZ4I,"First broadcast in Australia in 2001-2002 Cybergirl tels the story of an artificial teen girl slated for distruction because she was too ""human"" and her escape to Earth where she moves in with a teen boy and his father, posing as the boy's cousin.

There are 26 episodes of ""Ashley's"" adventures with the Campbell's and their efforts to evade her alien pursuers and their evil human ally. Each of the episodes has a great look to it with production values beyond most American television even today- it's well worth watching for a teen, the worst thing to a parent will be the casting of some adults as being less bright than the teen friends. 4 discs in the set- each with a featurette related to the series in some way and themselves worth watching.

Buy your teen a copy here or on eBay, it's worth watching by all.",1194048000,5,818,4.52027027027027
