7884846,3,6305199523,Low budget cheapie starring Nancy Allen. At 46 Allen still looks good but there's a bit too much collagen in those lips - check it out! PS - forget that ugly DVD cover.  Allen gives an OK performance.  Best line Indian to Allen:This land filled with evil spirit.  Allen to indian:No argument there!  Good DVD print and GREAT sound. Opening scene with Allen on the run is the best.  A must for all Allen fans,977011200,3,407,4.373333333333333
