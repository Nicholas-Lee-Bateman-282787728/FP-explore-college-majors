Pero el DVD me gust mucho, la historia est bien contada y no tiene fallas de edicin, creo que lo ms importante de la novela se mostr, adems incluyeron otras historias a parte de la de los personajes principales y se entienden muy bien.",1325548800,,353,4.603174603174603
3899821,5,B002BWSYJ4,"One of the best recent novelas.  Showcases Jaime Camil's genius for comedy and gives the Bracamonte room to strut.  Editing down to ""only"" a couple of weeks of solid viewing always provokes complaints.  The editors got this one right.  It moves rapidly and most of the necessary connections are present.  Who cares about the ballet slippers anyway?  Highly recommended--especially if you liked La Fea mas.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Las-Tontas-No-Van-Al-Cielo/dp/B002IW8V22/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Las Tontas No Van Al Cielo</a>",1265241600,7,573,6.780821917808219
3899822,3,B002BWSYJ4,The soap was poorly edited I saw the full version and lots of things were missing.  I understand that is the shortest version but it could include more details on things that were important for the viewer to understand somethings that happened through out the soap.,1262044800,9,265,4.760869565217392
3899823,5,B002BWSYJ4,"I had enjoyed this telenovela at first to help me with my Spanish but the storylines with subplots such as plastic surgery, feminisim, HIV in teenagers, drug abuse, sexual abuse, homosexuality, abortion, safe sex procedures, obesity, anorexia, bulimia, sterilization, leukemia, alcoholisim and mental illnesses. Having enjoyed the work of Mr. Camil from past work, it seems that the romantic comedy is something that he does very well no matter who he is matched up with.  Ms. Bracamontes shows her talent and charisma in this and hopefully she and Mr. Camil return to this type of format in the future. Everyone should have a guilty pleasure and this should be it.",1261785600,10,665,5.045454545454546

3899855,4,B002BWSYJ4,"Las tontas no van al Cielo (920 minutes) is a telenovela (English captions) I liked so much I bought a copy from Amazon.com. Billed as a comedy, it still has the requisite melodrama, wildly passionate characters, evil plotters and misguided relatives, murder attempts and custody battles we expect from a telenovela.

Of course we see babies born out of wedlock, a runaway bride, a plastic surgeon, a teenager with HIV, a construction company that launders money for the Mafia, lots of DNA tests, seductions and philandering.

One of my favorite characters is one who becomes the rock the rest of the family orbits around: a gay man who had been banished from the ""familia"" for being gay. This ended up being unpredictable and the alternate ending they tacked on in the Extras is hilarious! I REALLY like Valentine Lans!",1326499200,6,820,4.892086330935252

jacqueline bracamontes discovers that her envious sister has slept with her groom the night before the wedding. she discovers this fact at the wedding reception and makes a huge scene by stripping off the wedding dress the new husband bought her and walking away in her underwear.

she flees to her uncle who lives in another city and owns a small restaurant. he has been completely rejected by her parents because he is gay. she discovers that she is pregnant but wants nothing to do with the father or her family who just wanted her to marry him for his family's money and position. she convinces her uncle to lie and make them all believe that she has died and tell them nothing of the baby. that frees her to live a new life.

8362401,1,B002BWSYJ4,This DVD left much to be desired. I saw the whole novels on TV and this DVD was missing so many portions of the novels it didn't make sense. You were sometimes left guessing on what happened when the next plot started. Do not buy it. It's a shame it wasn't edited correctly. Waste of my money!!!,1438905600,,295,4.192982456140351
