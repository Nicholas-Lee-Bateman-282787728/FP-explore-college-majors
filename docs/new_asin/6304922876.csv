The story is of a hand full of people who wake up to find the city is empty of humankind that is live human kind, they must piece together the missing parts to the puzzle they must learn to cooperate with each other and huddle together.

Soon they will realize that they are at ground zero on ""Target Earth.""

The film has all the feel and dialog of an old twilight zone episode, However the actors of frontline majors. Virginia Grey was in over 140 movies and programs including ""Bachelor in Paradise"" (1961).  Richard Denning was in ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954).

The whole movie was made on a shoestring budget so they only had one robot (Steve Calvert the head bartender at Cerro's nightclub) that they tinkered together in a garage. The car (Oldsmobile convertible) with the dead uh...err... battery belonged to the producer (Herman Cohen.) And they used a buddy in the police forces to stop the traffic for the empty street shots. All shot in seven days, mostly in the deserted L.A. streets on a Sunday morning.

One of the most horrifying parts of this movie was that they were forced to drink warm beer.",1360368000,,1306,4.607758620689655

7880621,4,6304922876,"LET'S GET OUR FACTS STRAIGHT...Rick Overton has nothing to do with the production of the movie the DVD case suggests. Overton, I believe, was part of another movie with a similar title ""Target: Earth?"" as the voice of Ino, the computer. This movie featured the corpulent Victor Buono and does not compare with Sherman Rose's ""Target Earth"" starring Richard Denning and Kathleen Crowley. Don't waste your money on the Overton/Buono version.

******************************
THE REAL ""TARGET EARTH""

On the surface this 1954 movie appears to pretty bare-bones in comparison to other 1950s sci-fi epics. Richard Denning (Frank) and Kathleen Crowley (Nora), along with two others, are holed-up in a deserted hotel in a large  American city (probably Chicago). The city's inhabitants have been  evacuated, but these four have been overlooked.  The menacing Venusian  robot force (actually one robot), while a bit clunky and one dimensional,  presents a threatening, underlying presence throughout the movie. When will  it strike with its death-ray? Can anyone survive its monomaniac pursuit?

The movie's director, Herman Cohen, deftly explores the theme of lonliness  and isolation among the crew's cast. Nora's failed suicide attempt and  Jim's stoic acceptance of his being ""rolled outside a bar after  flashing a big roll"" the night before seem to create a credible  chemistry that bonds the characters' fates together.

If misery loves  company, Jim and Nora want no part of the company that waits outside the  flimsy boundries of their hotel room.  Black and white movies occasionally  intensify austerity in a way that color films do not. The seeming hopelessness  of Jim and Nora's situation, the desertion of the city, and unblinking,  unnerving robot presence raise the emotional level of ""Target  Earth"" up a couple of notches.

Viewers will like movie's ending  too. The ""science"" portion of ""Target Earth"" gets the  viewer to a stong visual climax as military scientists race against time to  develop an ultrasonic sound wave generator that will defeat the invading  menace. Will they get to Jim and Nora in time? Or will the lurking robot(s)  find them first?

Kudos must also go to supporting actors Virginia Grey  (Vicky) and Richard Reeves (Jim) as a pair of champagne guzzling reprobates  who vow to drink their way from one end of the city to the other. As  down-and-outers in their own isoated existence, their being trapped with  Frank and Nora aptly points out that they have something more to live for  than imbibing and gambling on the ""daily double.""

The acting is  first rate and the story's plot comes from an exciting short story called ""Deadly City"" by Paul W. Fairman.",917136000,24,2693,5.155092592592593
