828328,3,6304281641,"Good action, not like his PoP's Chuck. put them both together and that's when you can say a movie is Action Pack. I would like to see a part 2 in the future.",1406505600,,157,3.787878787878788
828329,5,6304281641,wow it is a trip how much Aaron Norris looks like his brother only younger and dark hair but just as bad ass if not more if you like marshal arts then you will love this.,1373414400,,170,3.75
828330,5,6304281641,"With years of experience we have learned that anytime the name ""Norris"" is slapped on the front cover of a film, then you can expect a mind-numbing journey into the world of B action. Truth be told we thought that Chuck was the Norris of choice in Overkill. However within the first five minutes we realized that brother Aaron would be headlining this event...and we were just fine with that. Aaron may not be Chuck but he isn't far off. This man has got just about everything Chuck has minus the notoriety. From the glorious shimmering mullet, to the skull stomping roundhouse kicks, Aaron is a one man wrecking crew. Aaron's like the cinnamon babka to Chuck's chocolate. A lesser babka? We think not! Aside from the Aaron factor was a concept completely inspired by the historic Death Ring. Aaron must have been very inspired by his nephew Mike and felt the need to also embark on a journey into the world of human safaris. It's a concept that just can't miss.

The film opens up with a police sting headlined by officer Jack Hazard (Aaron Norris). Naturally he lives up to his uber tough last name by storm trooping the house leading to him throwing the departments informant out the 3rd story window to his death (he didn't know he was an informant). During this scene an astounding mullet count of 7 was tallied up. 7 mullets in five minutes! That's a new record. Obviously the captain has had enough of Hazard's vigilante ways and tosses him off the force. Being newly unemployed he decides it's time to take a vacation in South America. After his initial relaxing 1st day of shirtless, jean wearing beach relaxation he finds himself in a heap of trouble. He unwittingly finds himself helping a stranger who is subject to be part of a human safari death match. All of a sudden he gets lumped into the Death Hunt in very similar fashion to his Nephew. And also like Mike, the tables are quickly turned as Hazard becomes their worst nightmare. Apparently Hazard is well versed in the art of human safari and is able to demolish anyone in his tracks. In the end you obviously know Hazard saves the day without a single mullet hair on his head harmed.

There was actually far to much greatness to incorporate into one simple review, so we MUST advise anyone within an earshot to get Overkill. Do it now!!!! It's worth the price of admission just to hear Aaron say ""NO DEAL"" (just like Arnold) during the killers negotiation. We know and respect the fact that Chuck leads the pack of Norrises, but Aaron is not far behind. In fact if Aaron was to get his start first then he may be the one doing Total Gym infomertials with a laundry list of hilarious facts. There wasn't the slightest dull moment in Overkill, not even for a second. Aaron hands out roundhouse kicks like an average man hands out handshakes. In addition to amazing fighting, you will unveil a ton of neck snappings that may be the most we've ever come across. How we never came across Overkill earlier is beyond us. All we know is the remainder of 2012 will be dedicated to Aaron Norris in addition to Lorenzo Lamas and Chief Diamond Philips. That may be a tall order to fill, but if anyone can do it the brothers Sid can.",1341100800,3,3190,4.52686308492201
828331,5,6304281641,"Many years back i use to have a VHS copy (not an original)
of this movie. then over 12 years ago i sold almost every
VHS movie i had and this movie was one of them. For years
i kicked myself for ever getting rid of it, and ever since
i've been keeping an eye out for it.

Finally i find a VHS original on Amazon.

Aaron Norris (Brother of Chuck Norris) has had small parts
in some of his brothers movies, and then went on to direct
many of his others. But before becomming a director he
starred in his one and only film....""OVERKILL""

THE STORY:
Norris plays a cop in need of a vacation and goes to
South America. When he tries to help someone in trouble,
he ends up being hunted in the jungle.

IN THIS MOVIE AARON PROVES 3 THINGS:
1- He's every bit the martial artist his brother is.
  (After all that's who trained him.)
2- He's a fairly talented actor and with time would
  have gotten better.
3- If he had not gone into directing, he could have
  become an action star.

Plenty of action. Enjoy.",1335571200,3,1000,4.15625

828458,2,6304281641,"OK, the only thing to know before you watch this low-budget, over-long, formulaic action movie is that it stars AARON Norris, the younger brother of CHUCK Norris. So if you watch it you won't be able to say, 'Yeah, it was pretty bad but at least it was a Chuck Norris movie!' You'll be stuck with the knowledge that you actually sat through a bad movie that starred Chuck's younger brother. And that's a heavy burden to bear, let me tell you...",1476921600,,444,4.426829268292683

828523,3,6304281641,"Just like his real life brother Chuck Norris, Aaron Norris smashes, dashes, and clashes with the baddies in this film. Of course the good guy wins in the end. This is another film that you just want to see the bad guys get their butts kicked, and Jack Hazard (played by Aaron) is a L.A. cop who's wish is just to relax and stay out of trouble. Jack can't seem to relax after the department forces him to take some time off after a raid goes bad. In the end though, he's going to need another vacation. A decent flick.",1470441600,,517,4.18

Regardless there is act in this movie with a cheesy story line. The movie ends lamely however, if you cannot find anything else to watch, this one is not too bad.",1436486400,,316,4.19672131147541

828608,1,6304281641,"Wow. What a movie. This isn't some B movie that you can munch popcorn to and remain mindless throughout. No, this one makes you think. Things like, ""I wonder if I really can save 15% in 15 minutes with GEICO."" or ""Should I be cremated when I die?"" Serious questions!

Lousy acting, lousy script, Totally out-of-place, noisy, unseen animal that reminded me of Lost. The sad thing is this review could fit the majority of films on Amazon Prime.",1412208000,,442,4.594936708860759

7866761,5,6304281641,"The five star rating has nothing to do with the fact that it wasn't 1.78; it was 1.33. And it wasn't surround sound; it was stereo. But it decoded nicely to utilize the rear speakers for special enjoyment.
It was five because I really liked the action and violence. There was shooting, punching, kicking and stabbing.
This would work perfectly on an old television. That was two 4:3 in a row from the mid-nineties.
The description stated that it was an adventure but didn't mention the violence so watching was an adventure that took me right where I wanted.",1498176000,,558,4.646464646464646

Most of Chuck's movies I can watch several times. This one was okay and had enough action in it to be something to watch if you are an action freak!. I give it 3 stars.",1485129600,,340,4.014705882352941
