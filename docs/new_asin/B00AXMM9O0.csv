I really like the Standing Series and have to push myself through the Sweat Fest segment as well. The Floor Workout I skip the portions that are in plank position because of my back troubles.

I love how Lisa keeps you moving during these workouts and how clear and encouraging her reviews are. I also enjoy that the workouts give me something to look forward to and strive towards since I am having to do ALL my workouts at home and do not get to schedule time at a gym or with a trainer. Lisa's cues are clear and timely, her attitude is motivating and I love that she comes across as REAL - not something that is unattainable but something that I can try to be.",1361491200,,1025,5.288343558282208
