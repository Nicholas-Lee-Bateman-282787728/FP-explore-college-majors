8551318,5,B00AG8XIH8,"Greetings;

Saw 'A fine and Pleasant Misery' many years ago back in my hometown in Alaska. Had the pleasure of meeting both Tim Behrens and Pat McManus in person, saw the props used and indeed reused throughout the various plays up close and indeed even was able to buy a recording of the show on VHS as well as a VHS copy of 'McManus in Love' when it was not yet touring-though I could swear that Tim did actually give us a sneak preview by acting out a bit of it that night. Either way. Enough bragging, for now.

Was fun to note that each of the 5 DVD cover arts had been autographed by both Pat and Tim. A nice touch ^_^

The first two plays, Miser and in Love have no menu pages-just load into the recording, just like when they were on VHS. The last 3 however I suppose were all newer and all have some manner of menu options-usually to skip to act 1 or 2 again, with the exception of 'Poor again Dagnabbit' which has a bonus segment of Tim recounting one of his favorite McManus stories >Spoiler<

Its about the deer on the bike, if you are familiar with that one.

Bare in mind, these plays were performed over a period of years. People would either see one and then nothing, as had been my case or, perhaps people would see them all over a period of what-nearly 15 years? Some material is reused though often times framed differently to make a whole play. They were not particularly meant to be seen back to back. My only real nitpick is more of one of consistency. Sometimes when a story is retold, it has a different ending or leaves out certain elements-such as McManus's date with Melba Peachbottom. One telling has them leaving the theater together while another has her taking off on his bike alone. I imagine that while there may be nuggets of reality in each story told to some degree, I do wonder though with what liberties? Was his real life wife the inspiration for Melba? He does eventually take out Olga Bonemarrow perhaps a time or two-while people have been known to date more than one person in a lifetime, I just wonder if perhaps they might all be more names given to personalities for people at stages in their own lives perhaps? Like I said, a nitpick and not a complaint though for years I never did question the identity of Bun-at least not so much until the different ending.

Green Hash by the by, I know that at some point in my youth, I had read something about Green hash in his stories-Either in perhaps whatchagot stew or perhaps having something to do with a spoiled breakfast item perhaps. When I met McManus years ago at his book signing preceding the play,  I had asked him about it and he didn't know-said it didn't sound good though whatever it was. I had wondered if it was something that he had written about and had been drawing an unpleasant parallel to 'Green Eggs and Ham' or if it were instead meant to simply be a more literal examination of something gone bad. Either way, doubtless that even should Pat McManus see this he would recall the question. But that is a memory I share all the same.

Thank you and take care...",1501027200,,3074,4.361888111888112

8551324,5,B00AG8XIH8,"Tim Behren's ingenious one-man two-act plays, created from humorist Patrick F. McManus' collections, beginning with A Fine and Pleasant Misery, clearly display the autobiographical nature of the comedic works.  Close McManus family friend, actor Behrens has single-handedly brought to life some 40 zany characters taken from the magazine articles and has been delighting audiences for 20 years in 11 states and in several Canadian provinces with fast paced skits in five one-man plays known collectively as The McManus Comedies. For the majority, unable to see a show in person, these videos bring the experience home. In the first video, Tim portrays the adult McManus looking back at his childhood escapades and narrow escapes as he sifts through memories while ostensibly cleaning out his garage. Of course, the obvious conclusion is everything is too precious to discard. Behrens captured the essence of these well beloved books and likewise made this reader laugh until she cried.  The videos bring to vivid life some of the most unforgettable personalities first introduced in print: Rancid Crabtree, the ragged and rugged outdoorsman who never met a bar of soap he unwrapped and used or worked a day in his life; Crazy Eddie Muldoon who stands in for Vern Schulz, McManus lifelong best friend.  Also present are Eddie's twitchy, harried parents; Pat's six year older sister and minder, Patricia also known as the Troll ( ""I'm going to tell on you""); the curmudgeonly Retch Sweeney; old Mrs. Swisher who never ventured out after dark; the peacekeeping sheriff; and Pat himself as narrator of these tales of Blight County. The boys roamed freely, camped ""a half days journey from home"" as they were mortally afraid of the dark, climbed mountains, forded streams and fished ""cricks'. The stories are funny, wondrous tales of adventure that conceal the true hardship of being raised during the height of the depression in a rough and remote northern Idaho logging camp by a struggling teacher. Tim Behrens and Patrick F. McManus are a not to be missed combination.",1370476800,,2067,5.145833333333333
