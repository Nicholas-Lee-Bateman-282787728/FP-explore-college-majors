8156434,3,B000KGGP12,"I was surprised when I put the video in my computer and encountered problems with the regional setting.  I was able to change the setting on my computer but started encountering problems so immediately removed it.  I tried the video on my dvd players (all set to region 1 -USA) and none of them would play. My dvd players did not have the regional change options.

I contacted the company and was told that this particular video is not for region 2.  In conversation, they offered me compensation. I decided I wanted a return. The company was nice and I had no problems resolving the issue with them.  I give the company strong marks for customer service.

In addition to contacting the company I purchased the item from on Amazon, I also  contacted the hoopgirl camp to find out more about the regions settings of 1 and 2 and to explain the problem I encountered.  While waiting to hear back, I ordered the video for region 1 from Hoopgirl.  Crazy on my part because it was LOTS more than the one sold by the Amazon vendor.  I asked the hoopgirl camp about the significant difference in price and still in communication with them. What I've learned so far is that the item on this site is sold by the producer that is why it is cheaper here.  Not sure if this information is correct. I am building a hooping library and wanted it but cannot recommend anyone purchasing the region 1 at the price on the web when I know there are better items out there..

Anyway, if you are a brand new hooper, and do not live in region one, this video would be ok, but you would do better purchasing  her "" Hooping, a revolutionary fitness program "" It is a hooping book with a dvd at an extremely reasonable price.  Great choice for new hoopers.  Also highly recommend Hoopalicious DVD ""Hoop Revolution's CORE Foundations""  This would be great for beginners and intermediate hoopers.",1410652800,,1868,4.5148809523809526
