8689175,4,B00PTUB3GQ,"Amidst a boatload of slice of life stories, Gingitsune stands out for being a religious one, with a goodly number of religious adherents and usually invisible religious heralds.

Prior to the age of 4, upon the death of her mother, Makoto Saeki inherited the Sight, the ability to see and communicate with religious heralds, such as the huge, grumpy, laid back, but truly caring about her fox spirit, Gintarou, the unusually single herald (there usually are two) of her Saeki Shrine.  As a result, both of them choose to act as helper outers for the heralds and humans that come to their shrine.

This religious filter makes for an interesting twist; they get people AND heralds who need some kind of guidance or help from them and that is before the arrival of Satoru Kamio, an orphan boy who also has the Sight and is accompanied by a relatively young fox herald, Haru.  Thus in addition to the humans who need their help like tsundere Yumi Ikegami who loves animals and a boy from another temple and stuck up Hiwako Funabashi a wealthy politician's daughter, they also find religious heralds in various kinds of trouble.  It all makes for a relatively pleasant, if somewhat downturned look at how modern Japanese religion works.

Note: This show is only subtitled in English. There is no English voice dubbing.",1470009600,,1313,4.787610619469026

8689180,5,B00PTUB3GQ,This story could be complete as is and I like it a lot. Very good character development and story. I'd like to see more but it's good as is.,1438387200,,140,3.8620689655172415
8689181,5,B00PTUB3GQ,"The series is a short, cute Slice of Life with a supernatural twist. There's no specific plot line followed other than following the day to day life of a highschool girl named Makato, the true heir to the Inari shrine, attending school and sharing her daily life with the shrine's guardian, Gingtarou, who only true shrine guardians can see.

If you like fun, quirky supernatural animes that takes a more comedic approach to darker subjects such as Hell, I suggest you give it a watch. Just be careful if you're watching it with the English subtitles and you have to pause. Try to pause when the subtitles are on the screen. If you pause in the wrong place you temporarily lose your subtitles until the scene changes and will have to rewind it just right.",1438387200,2,755,4.592592592592593
