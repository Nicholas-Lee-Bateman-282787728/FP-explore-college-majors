2158883,1,B00062IDZQ,"Jessica Simpson is hands down the dumbest individual alive!! Why this show is even on television is beyond me. It is not entertaining and the neither of the stars have any talent for acting or singing.

Jessica (with a head full of rocks), is the reason that dumb blonde jokes exist. She gives me a headache. It's all of you people that watch this garbage on TV that makes it stay on the air. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND DVDS!!

This type of thing is what made me lose respect and interest in MTV.",1101168000,18,494,4.189473684210526

2158885,5,B00062IDZQ,"I was a big fan of Jessica Simpson even before this series started, so I am very happy that this show has given her the attention she deserves. As anyone can tell, this girl can sing! I really appreciate how normal this first season is. Her and Nick together are just like any other couple. I really hope they put a lot of extra footage on and especially the duet of ""Take My Breath Away"" that was shown on Newlyweds but never released on an album. This will definately make it to my Christmas wish list!",1097366400,12,504,4.260416666666667

2158916,2,B00062IDZQ,"If think good entertainment is sitting around and watching Jessica Simpson whine about everything this is the DVD for you. You get a glimpse of her beauty pageant mother. Basically it is just two spoiled young Americans who are too young to be married.

Also, I hate the cheesy music that they play over the top of Nick and Jessica's music videos and songs. I mean it is Newlyweds with Nick and Jessica. Like they cannot get the rights to their own songs/videos???? ANd the DVD appears to be produced by MTV (hello . . . Music Television who played nothing but Nick, Jessica, and others of course). At first I didn't know what was going on. I kept thinking . . . that sounds so stupid. I don't remember those songs or their voices sounding like that. Just goofy.",1416268800,,762,4.442857142857143

2158932,5,B00062IDZQ,"Newlyweds was my favorite show on MTV (until they got divorced and Jersey Shore premiered) :)

I have the complete series and I still watch them to this day! They were so funny and so real. Jessica always made me laugh and Nick is just sexy! Must have!",1361404800,,252,4.25
2158933,5,B00062IDZQ,I enjoyed this! It's funny to watch them get used to being married. This is by far the best season they did in my opinion. Maybe it's because they were still very in love at the time.,1324598400,,183,3.972972972972973
2158934,4,B00062IDZQ,"I own all four seasons of the Newlyweds, but am a little partial to season one. There are more 'jessica' moments in this season vice any other and it's fun to watch both of these newlyweds get used to being filmed constantly. definitely has a good re-play value; i could never get tired of watching this set.",1296432000,,308,4.421052631578948
2158935,1,B00062IDZQ,"I ordered this for a present over xmas - it ended up arriving earlier than expected and hence this was great news.  Just a little unsure of the quality of the DVD as it does not seem to be of original/copyrighted quality - i.e there is no main menu and the audio seems to be a little out of sinc.
I would apprecaite some follow up regarding this as to where to go with the issue.
On a positive note it appears that all of the other DVDs are of high quality and do not share the same issue.

2158939,3,B00062IDZQ,"This was the first MTV reality series that I watched and I'd forgotten what a cute couple they were.  Hindsight being 20/20 vision, the idea was a good way to reintroduce the couple to the public and remind viewers that both were pretty good pop singers who were still struggling to reestablish themselves in the music world but the added scrutiny by basically the world that they allowed into their private lives served to destroy their marriage.  So I wonder if they'd agree to do this again knowing what they know now.

It's such a shame that the marriage didn't last but these 10 episodes are as entertaining to watch now as they were just a few short years ago.  I loved how down to earth Nick was - hanging out with his brother, stubbornly moving his furniture into the house, fighting the bees and fretting about his music video and solo album.  Jessica seemed sweet & her hilarious observations were the perfect foil to Nick's ""straight man"" reactions.

I remember that as the seasons went on they weren't as charming as this one because the tension between Nick & the entire Simpson family was so obvious that it became painful to watch.  My only complaint is in the editing of the discs it's odd that neither Nick or Jessica's actual songs were used during the episodes about the filming of their videos but overall I enjoyed reliving this first season and would recommend it to those who may have missed the series when it aired.",1217376000,,1440,4.6015625

2158961,5,B00062IDZQ,"I watched all of the seasons when Newlyweds first came on MTV and I had forgotten how funny they were.  I loved all the extras on the DVD, but the dvd version of the show was not as polished as the versions aired on MTV.  The sound is not consistent in some parts, but other than that, I recommend the dvd.",1185926400,,306,4.0
2158962,1,B00062IDZQ,"I just can't believe this! The series released on DVD and so many 5-star ratings? Some folk even state it as being their favourite show? What is wrong with people these days? Some wouldn't know a good show if it jumped up and down on their nose wearing tap shoes and a suit of armour, singing ""Tra-La-La-Boom-De-Ay"". I would rather sit through 10 hours of the test card, than an hour of this.

At least it showed how shallow and meaningless celebrity marriages are. I have socks that lasted longer and never stunk as much.

I know everyone has their own opinions and tastes, but for someone to actually ""LIKE"" this, let alone ""LOVE"" it just blows my mind!

But then again...if you have the I.Q. of a slug, then I am sure you will love this. Enjoy!!",1168128000,3,748,4.405797101449275
2158963,5,B00062IDZQ,"I bought the dvd to see exactly what the ""chicken / tuna"" thing was about. I thought the dvd was quite entertaining. I did find myself touched in the scene where Nick is tearing up whilst watching his bride come towards him, but aside from that they seemed to bicker and complain an awful lot. Infact in one argument it was almost embarassing to watch (she comes home and he re-decorated the house) he seems a smidge cruel to her. She poor thing seems so stupid she does not know how to defend herself. I really like how Nick seemed down to earth. I found him really enchanting when he himself looked back at his wife when she made the tuna remark as if to say ""Are you for real?!"" I also like how he was so down to Earth and did a lot of do it yourself stuff just to save some money. Ie. Moving furniture, staying at a friends house instead of a hotel, killing the bees, etc... I wish him much happiness in his future because he showed his humble side. Instead Jessica always was primping and prepping herself. So much so she did not even make dinner ""that"" night she promised to. All in all I came away liking them both somewhat...Nick quite a bit more. It was a good entertaining purchase.",1154736000,4,1192,4.278761061946903
2158964,5,B00062IDZQ,"Newlyweds (Nick and Jessica) were amazing in this show. This show really proved that is a reality show, and that was that Nick and Jessica always faught in this show. This show wasn't filmed to show that this couple is perfect, but it was like in real life!!

 Thats what matters and not just seeing a show that hides the real life!",1144540800,4,332,4.338709677419355
2158965,5,B00062IDZQ,"Newlyweds with Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey is just a wonderful treat for our eyes.....

I'm not a huge fan of Jessica or Nick,but i do have to admit that i loved this show its a guilty pleasure for me to watch......",1140566400,,314,4.080645161290323
2158966,3,B00062IDZQ,"I saw some of that first season of Nick and Jessica.  Many times it was funny.  Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson obviously saw their average music careers boost with this MTV reality show.  Although this is a modern show, it reminds me so much of the old I Love Lucy shows of the '50s with Lucy Ricardo's squabbles with her husband Ricky Ricardo.  This time, it's Nick telling Jessica to do the laundry, what with clothes all over the floor. And rather than have someone else do it, Nick goes to Home Depot and does some home improvements in the home.  He's probably one of the few celebrities to attempt this when most of them have to have bodyguards around them. He even watches his favorite Cincinnati sports teams on TV, even screamed at the TV when the college basketball team missed shots. Jessica can say the silliest things when she approaches Nick and others. But sometimes the show can be invasive. TOO invasive! I hope that this doesn't become a pattern for TV to show the private lives of celebrities too much by filming their activities in their homes. They did it too with Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown and Travis Barker and his wife. It's hard to believe that this show was on MTV from 2003 to 2005. I know that some celebrities are our favorite stars, but we don't need to see everything. Some shows I tended to back off; just focused on the funnier moments. Lachey and Simpson tend to argue too much in some places that it seems uncomfortable to watch it. Some cameras should have stayed away. Otherwise, an entertaining reality show.",1137888000,3,1552,4.568345323741007
2158967,5,B00062IDZQ,"I bought these DVD and watched the whole series for the first time.  It is interesting to see how they deal with their marriage and makes you realize that Nick and Jessica are both real people, with issues that, if we can't relate to, then at least they are funny. I know people who would do they same thing if they were in that position.",1128643200,,338,4.2
2158968,3,B00062IDZQ,"Man, Jessica Simpson has GOT to be the dumbest bubble head on the planet. Jessica is nothing but a rich brat who has no real talents other then looking good and making medicore bubblegum pop music.

Jessica is the ultimate spoiled bimbo who should were a dunce cap. The episodes she thinks Chicken of the Sea tuna is made of chicken or where she thinks buffalo wings are made of buffalo. You get the idea.",1127952000,3,405,4.4
2158969,5,B00062IDZQ,"Well, in the 50's there was a show about a dity wife named Lucy and her husband and bandleeder, Ricky.  And people laughed at her because she was funny and said and did stupid things, but was in real life, smart.  Well, they should call this show jesica and people would KNOW that she only PRETENDS, Peo-PLE to be stupid!  She is actually smart if you read interviews with her!  And you should buy this and laugh at Jessica, a trulie talented Comedianne!!!",1125878400,3,456,4.457831325301205
2158970,5,B00062IDZQ,"Season one of Nelwlyweds is hilarious....you will enjoy watching Nick & Jessica and all the funny moments that took place the first year of their marriage! The extra footage on the dvd's gives you even more insight from the ""lovebirds"" themselves! I recommond ""Newlyweds"" to all the Nick & Jessica fans out there.",1125619200,3,313,4.9245283018867925
2158971,2,B00062IDZQ,"With that one line, Jessica Simpson went from being a D/C grade level celebrity to being one of the most beloved, well known airheads.  The show itself was kind of lame, neither she nor Nick is the sharpest tool in the shead, but they at least have a few entertaining moments here and there.  I don't care for reality TV shows at all, but I gave this one a shot.  I gave it 2 stars for the chicken or fish comment, and that one scene where she spent $2000+ on underwear and pissed him off.  Otherwise it was just another show that you watch because it's on.",1125532800,5,557,4.177570093457944
2158972,5,B00062IDZQ,"In the cutthroat world of reality tv, NEWLYWEDS stands apart as testament to the powers of love and devotion. While we take great glee in watching The Donald harpoon the hopes and dreams of ordinary shmoes with a quick and unfeeling ""YOU'RE FIRED!,"" and desperately keep our fingers crossed that a FEAR FACTOR contestant will be squeezed, crushed, and devoured by a 50-ft. Anaconda, we tune-in to NEWLYWEDS week after week with the genuine hope that Nick and Jessica are going to make it. In their own small way, the happy couple are doing their best to prevent Mankind from feeding on itself, positioning themselves as a sort of John and Yoko for the 21st Century. Recommend this phenomenal set to those you love, and perhaps more importantly, to those who really can't stand you; today's future is yesterday's bridesmaid, so let's follow Nick and Jessica's example and wed tomorrow's possibilities with the love that's in our hearts this day.",1122595200,,944,4.90625
2158973,5,B00062IDZQ,"Jessica Simpson knew her 15 minutes of fame were fading fast in 2003. Though powerful vocally, her lackluster, less than stellar album material forced her in the backseat to the likes of reigning teen queen Britney Spears and archrival Christina Aguilera. Then she and new hubby Nick Lachey decided to sign a contract and let MTV follow them around for a season to record their lives. Coinciding with the release of her so-so third CD In This Skin, ""Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica"" soon proved to be one of the most popular reality shows in TV history, mainly backed by Jessica's now infamous ""blonde"" comments (her most famous being her first: ""Is this chicken or fish?""). The instant success of the show granted Jessica another chance in the spotlight and since has gained the girl the status of a true It-lister. MTV's DVD collection of ""The Complete First Season of Newlyweds"" is definitely entertaining and proves why America loves this uber-likable couple so much.",1121817600,2,965,4.92638036809816
2158974,1,B00062IDZQ,"I watched this show once and i believe my iq dropped a little.

I didn't even know who jessica simpson was before this show.  I knew a little about the guy from that group 'cause thats what everyone called him' well  besides 12 year old girls. It must be pretty sad to be calling yourself an artist and your only fans are have your age.  Jessica simpson is a great example of how just being pretty can get you a long way.. She might be the dumbest person that i have ever seen.  I seriously hope and pray that the jessica simpson she portrays on her show is just a character.  B/c if she isn't than nick is pretty off as well being that he is married to a woman with a 5th grade education.",1121644800,5,689,4.066666666666666

2159000,4,B00062IDZQ,"Imagine having the entire first season without commercials. This is the DVD set that makes it possible. Everything from the show is here and more. It is a great thing to own if you watch the show. One thing to note, and it is the down fall of this collection, none of their actual music is played during the shows on the DVD. It is as though the label said ""no"" to allowing their music to be played on the DVD set: weird. That sucks, other than that, it is a must buy for anyone who liked the show.",1109030400,3,498,4.040404040404041
2159001,4,B00062IDZQ,"I love the Newlyweds, but I have to share my disappointment with the DVD.  As someone who's seen the episodes many, many times on MTV, I have grown accustomed to the songs they had put behind the scenes.  The DVD has removed most of the music and put that 60s soundtrack through it all.  I'm not sure if it's because they couldn't get the rights or what, but it really ruins it for me.  This may not be a big deal to many, but for me it's distracting.  Otherwise, it's great to have this show on DVD.",1108166400,3,500,4.11340206185567
2159002,4,B00062IDZQ,"Many of these reviews are based on personal feelings or dislikes for Nick and Jessica, which is just stupid.  No one wants to know why a particular person doesn't like Jessica Simpson, they just want to know if her show entertaining or not.  And the show is definitely entertaining.  People also really exaggerate Jessica's ""not too bright"" moments.  That's all people talk about.  Truth is, we all have our moments.

2159005,1,B00062IDZQ,"Why would you buy Newlyweds on dvd? If you're so obsessed with Jessica Simpson or Nick as to get a dvd of them ""doing stuff"", you should go see a shrink. Get a life people.",1105574400,9,172,3.942857142857143
2159006,5,B00062IDZQ,"...than this!  When I heard that Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson agreed to allow the first year of their married life to be filmed for a reality TV show on MTV, I thought what a brilliant career move on both their parts, though I couldn't imagine why anyone famous would want their already media-focused lives to be further open for public consumption.  Its a move that paid off...as there aren't many options available for a former member of a boy band once he's married off and the band is disbanded.  As far as boy bands go, I thought 98 Degrees was the best of the bunch, but with Justin Timberlake of NSYNC stealing most of the limelight, there just isn't a whole lot of use for boy band alumni.

You had to know a show like this was waiting to happen.  Nick and Jessica are the human equivalent of Ken and Barbie, and even their mansion resembles everything perfect and plastic about that perfect model of couplehood that Mattel peddles to the masses since the 1950s.  Nick and Jessica are a likeable young couple and one can't help but watch at episodes in their lives that make interesting viewing.  I didn't expect it to be so funny, with most of the humor coming from Jessica's bimbo moments, saying things you just can't believe a person that successful wouldn't know about (such as the much talked about ""chicken or tuna"", ""I don't eat buffalo"", and her not knowing about bears prowling for food at night or what rigor mortis is).  It must be frustrating for Nick to deal with some of her ""dumb blonde moments"", but as she said in a game they played during a campfire: who needs intelligence when they have a body like hers?

Because this show is much funnier than I expected and I happen to like Nick and Jessica as a couple and enjoy seeing them live as normal a life as they can (despite the limos, mansion, luxury cars, exotic vacations, and invitations to exclusive parties), I find this show to be one of the better reality television shows out there.  The camping episode was the best one, as you don't expect a glamourous and famous couple like theirs to ""rough it"" in the wilderness or go shopping on a whim at Home Depot.

I also enjoyed the episode with the bees and Jessica's birthday party.  By the end of ten episodes, I found myself charmed by Jessica Simpson, for despite her ditziness, she is simply sweet, charming and seductive.  I fully understand why Nick is so taken with her, and that moment for me came when she chides her husband for eating a piece of the honeycomb and laughs at him when he starts spitting.  The special features were really nice, with intercut interviews of them both about the key moments in their relationship.  They each also contributed a video for this dvd set, and Jessica's (""Sweetest Sin"")is far superior to her husband's (""Shut Up"").  She sings it in a very sultry, seductive style that's hard to beat, and the video almost borders on racy sensuality between the two of them that should be kept private.

In the end, you have to know that while they might not be as superstar a couple like Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears were at one point, they do have a little bit more realism in their lives and a great sense of career moves to allow such an intrusive look into the most difficult year of anyone's marriage.  It might be an indication of narcissism on their part, but I don't think so.  At any rate, I do hope theirs is a marriage that will last the test of time, but that remains to be seen.  Until then, we all get to be voyeurs in their marital squabbles, for whatever that's worth.",1105401600,50,3559,4.488372093023256
2159007,4,B00062IDZQ,"I love this show.  I am very glad it is on DVD, but once again the music coverups are so distracting.  As I am currently in the middle of watching the episode with the various video shoots, I actually stopped the DVD and came online to try and figure out if anyone else was bothered by it.  They chose absolutely terrible songs to play as well.  Ugh.  That is disappointing, but the rest of the DVD is nice, including the extra features.",1104019200,6,437,4.280487804878049
2159008,5,B00062IDZQ,"Nick and Jessica's life show us something real...the life of a real couple, the life of a real girl, the life of a real guy, and the life of real celebrities.  I think its great that they were so open to sharing the difficulties and the joys of a first year of marriage.  And, Peter, I can think of several incorrect things in your post.  First of all, Jessica is a natural blonde.  Her hair is lighter now than it was when she was younger, but it is naturally blonde.  And second, in your watching of ONE episode, I find it hard to believe that you became such an expert on the show, especially to say that ""Nick just looks fed up with her most of the time.""  I didn't realize that assumption could be rightly made after just one episode.  I love this show because it shows everything, good and bad, about a real couple, and I give it 5 stars for the authenticity of it alone.",1104019200,8,877,4.184523809523809
2159009,1,B00062IDZQ,"The fact that this show is even watched by the public is evidence for what many are calling ""the dumbing down of America"". Are we so devoid of entertainment on television that we'll waste 30 minutes watching two married pop singers go about their day-to-day goings on? First of all let's analyze things here a bit, shall we? Are Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey so egotistical and self-absorbed that they think everyone would be interested in their rich and spoiled lives? This is a very frustrating and infuriating show to watch. Jessica Simpson is the epitome of the dumb blonde (she's naturally a brunette, by the way). She cannot function normally like the rest of us folks who don't make millions of dollars per year. She is a rich and whiny spoiled brat who is nauseating to watch. It's like watching a ten-year-old child in an adult's body. All she seems to be good at is spending money on stupid things and saying unintelligent things and speaking in a whiny, annoying voice. One episode of this crap was more than enough. Nick just looks fed up with her most of the time. I cannot wait until this couple is separated and divorced. Then will we get to watch Nick And Jessica's divorce court trial on dvd?? The only reasons this show came about were because MTV deemed it necessary, and because the recording careers of both Nick and Jessica needed a boost. I really feel sorry for those who rated this as five stars.  I'll be glad when the whole reality show fad is dead and gone.",1103932800,26,1487,4.569288389513108
2159020,3,B00062IDZQ,"no english subtitle!  GESH!  I love this show and have been waiting for this for a year and finally bought this recently.  One huge disappointment is that there's no subtitle included.  MTV makes a lot of money and they can't even include english subtitle for deaf and hoh?  Should've read technical info before purchasing this otherwise I wouldn't have waste it $ on dvds with no english subtitle.

I love love love this show a LOT but I'm giving this a 3 stars because of subtitle wasn't included for deaf and hoh or for foreign people.",1103414400,6,538,4.552083333333333
2159021,3,B00062IDZQ,"Honestly, this DVD could be great it they had not done (as one reviewer so perfectly described it) the ""Cheesy-ass tunes"". I think the same thing....It's Nick and Jessica's show - they are making money off of these DVD sales...so why in the episodes where they have their music, do they put generic stuff over it? In addition, if they can get rights to use the music on TV, the rights should be there for the DVD, as well. For Jessica's birthday party at Concorde, when they are dancing to 50 cent's ""It's your Birthday"", they play some random music, but yet their lips are going to 50 cent's song - so it all looks unnatural. It's probably not bad if you never watched the show on TV, but I was pretty disappointed. Buy a burned copy of all 3 seasons off of ebay from someone who got it all off of the TV....thats your best bet!",1103155200,,829,4.286624203821656
2159022,1,B00062IDZQ,I do not understand the reasoning for putting this series on DVD.  For one thing...the season isn't all that long and MTV would show each episode about 27 times throughout the week before the new episode would air the following week.  DOn't waste your money...just wait for MTV to show the whole season on a Sunday afternoon.,1103068800,25,325,4.684210526315789
2159023,5,B00062IDZQ,"If I could, I would give this DVD a ton of stars. It was everything I expected and more. It took quite a bit of time to watch the whole thing. I had missed a lot more of the beginning of their season than I even realized. But I liked it. This show just goes to show everyone out there that celebrities tackle the same things in everyday life that we all do. They put on their pants one leg at a time just like you and I and if they get a cut, they bleed too. Nothing fake or rehearsed about this show.

I won't give it away, but the 2nd disk has some goodies on it for all their fans that you probably never saw on t.v. before. I think it would be safe to say that it was added to this DVD specifically for you to see when you bought the DVD. It is worth it too. I got mine at Walmart and I hope they release the second season as well....soon! So get yours and reap the rewards!",1102982400,18,878,3.8241758241758244
2159024,4,B00062IDZQ,"I was very excited about this DVD. I am a fan of Nick, Jessica and the show, so it was a must-have for me. It's perfect for those times when nothing is on TV or when you're bored... Plus it's kind of fascinating to see how celebs live and see where they travel (LA, Bahamas, NYC, Orlando, etc.). To make a long story short, this is an extremely good DVD. There are plenty of extras, including interviews, bonus footage, music videos, and much more. I did not give this product five stars for one reason: The people who made this DVD used cheap-ass, cheesy, generic tunes in place of the real songs... Most notably in the episode where Nick and Jessica shoot their vidoes, ""Shut Up"" and ""Sweetest Sin,"" respectfully. Instead of hearing the playback to their own tracks, we get to hear some crappy music playing in the background. It feels awkward... It's Nick and Jessica's songs-- Why can't we hear them? It seems to me that Paramount didn't want to hand over the dough for licensing permission for the songs. It's annoying and obvious throughout the episode(s).

To sum it up: Other than the music deal, this is excellent!",1102982400,13,1123,4.587064676616915
2159025,1,B00062IDZQ,"U must be a fool if u have bought this, save your money on this mtv produced junk (Jessica was clearly dropped on her head as a baby *'i don't eat buffalo'* + although I must say her 2nd album 'irresistable' is tight). Why anyone would spend their money on watching Nick + Jessica sitting around watching T.V, eating, cleaning + doing laundry is beyond me.

I think this is all acting, however. I am disappointed in the special features. This DVD could have used ""With You"" but no, it includes the video ""Sweetest Sin"" since both of them are in it. ""With You"" would've been a much better choice.",1101859200,,410,4.012195121951219
