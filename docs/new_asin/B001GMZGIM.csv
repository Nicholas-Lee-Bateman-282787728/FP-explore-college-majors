3616898,5,B001GMZGIM,This video may be more effective with older kids but surprisingly enough my 4 year old loves it. It covers lots of info that I had actually forgotten. My daughter especially loves the little girls hair and asked me to do her hair the same way.  I'm planning to purchase all of the videos for my children to learn about other cultures as well.,1413244800,,342,4.34375
3616899,5,B001GMZGIM,It's rare to find a well-done children's DVD that focuses solely on African American culture.  Love the music and animation!,1391299200,,124,5.2
3616900,5,B001GMZGIM,"My four year old daughter loves this series. Like most four year old girls, she can be very picky (about everything!) and this is her hands down favorite things to watch. While being very entertaining (some of the Baby and Little Einstein people are the creative forces behind this), this is also a great educational experience. Our daughter has asked us to learn more about some of the themes touched on in this series. Overall, this is very highly recommended.",1224460800,3,462,4.7875
3616901,5,B001GMZGIM,"Global Wonders African-American is now a staple in our children's DVD library collection. Our daughter asks to watch it again and again (upstairs, downstairs and in the car), and each time we learn something new together. It is one DVD you don't have to feel guilty about having your child watch since it's educational and entertaining at the same time.",1224460800,4,353,4.9

8306195,4,B001GMZGIM,"My kids loved it and I only had 2 issues with this. First off ghandi is well known for his views on blacks in south African and black Indians. Second the song ""amazing grace"" is not a song any person of color should be singing....why do you ask? do your research and find out like I did.  Other than that it was a welcome addition to educating the kids.",1424822400,11,353,4.115942028985507
