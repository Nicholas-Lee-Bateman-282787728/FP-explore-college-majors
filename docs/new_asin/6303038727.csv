544996,5,6303038727,"""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"" is a film noir tale that will leave you on the edge of your seat throughout viewing. It is a real potboiler of a story, that involves greed, jealousy, hatred and obsession. All four leads in this sordid tale are excellent. Barbra Stanwyck is wonderful, as the town's richest, women who is torn by keeping a terrible secret and the man she really loves, but cannot have. Kirk Douglas is in his first role as Stanwyck's jealous, but weak husband. Van Heflin is great in the center stage role of an innocent guy who gets caught between the two schemers. And last but not least, lizbeth Scott turns in a very sexy performance, as the grade B bad girl, who always winds up in trouble. For fans of the film noir movie genre, this one is right up there with ""Double Indemnity"". A must Have!",993600000,5,818,4.423841059602649

544998,5,6303038727,"It's a fine little race to watch, with everyone trying to stay one step  ahead of each other in this malevolently decadent thriller about love,  marriage,... and murder. Barbara Stanwyck is cunningly vicious in her role  as a woman whose mysterious and intriguing past forced her to give up her  childhood sweetheart, (Van Heflin, in a well-executed performance) bound  her to marry a man she hated (Kirk Douglas, in an auspicious film debut)...  and made hers one of the richest and most modern industries in America. But  now her tightly knit secret is beginning to unravel... her husband is  beginning to drink, her ex-flame is back... and he's trying to solve a  famous crime committed in the town years and years ago. A remarkable film,  with the suspense of a Hitchcock thriller, atmosphere of a Wilder noir, and  the acting of a Wyler drama, come together to make this noir a chilling and  memorable experience, ranking with ""Double Indemnity"" and  ""North By Northwest"".  A must-see for fans of film noir.",965865600,25,1012,4.876470588235295
544999,3,6303038727,"Barbara Stanwyck wasn't everyone's idea of a raving beauty but her roles had leading men all over Hollywood wrapped around her finger.  This worthy potboiler features a very skillful debut performance by Kirk Douglas as her  emotionally tortured, semi-sympathetic husband.  Douglas nicely handled  what had to be one of the most difficult, unheroic roles of his long  career.  The real male lead of 'The Strange Love of Martha Ivey' is a young  Van Heflin as a sharp-talking, world-weary loner who drifts back to his  hometown to learn what happened to his childhood sweetheart--and a lot has!

Stanwyck is hard as nails in her interpretation of Martha who, as a kid helped her aunt (who was threatening to kill Martha's pet cat with her cane) to her death.  Martha had a witness to the incident, however and years later the it comes back to haunt her in the form of an old friend.........Kirk Douglas remarked later in his career that Stanwyck was rather icey to him and not helpful at all during the filming (this was his debut). Perhaps she was just staying in character before it became fashionable! Lizabeth Scott is peculiarly artificial and shallow as always, but in this it works somehow. I don't think any actress of her day including Crawford could play a tough quite as convincingly as Stanwyck!...she could be CHILLING in her amazing realistic naturalness; maybe she just thought about her bitter years as an orphan living in poverty in some Brooklyn tenement. Whatever the case, she's terrific and my vote for the most underrated actress of Hollywood's Golden Years.",944006400,,1114,4.802083333333333

Scott was superb as the beautiful ""good"" girl this time...as she too would eventually play femme-fatales. The plot had superb twists that had you glued to the screen to find out what really happened the night Martha and the two boys were involved in the aunt's death, as well as how the truth would affect them as adults.

The story line is pure film noir so one knows that in the end each characters are faced with secrets from the past that will change each life for ever. I enjoyed watching Lizabeth Scott in any film and though her part is not one of her best roles it is always a treat to watch her in noir roles. Judith Anderson does so very much with her short but most important part in the tragic outcome of this film. Actresses have won academy awards with less then what miss Anderson put into her role.

If you like film noir/melodramas and either Barbara Stanwyck  / Van Heflin  or Lizabeth Scott or all of the above you'll probably like this movie.  Its even got Kirk Douglass in it, although he's not the lead.  I thought the writing / story line were both very good.  Its not Gone with the wind or anything but it definetly holds your attention all the way through.--- I really liked how both Van Heflin and LIzabeth Scott played their characters.  And of course there's the beautiful Barbara Stanwyck.  That lady could act.  I don't like to hear every detail or even close about  a movie  I'm considering seeing.  So I won't tell you all about it.  There are other reviewers here who can do that for you. I will say that it starts out with the aforementioned actors as tweenagers and leads up to their reunion as adults. This is my favorite Lizabeth scott film who is a 4th wheel in the group of adult characters.---This flick has a lot going for it. Unfortunately it has fallen into the public domain which means anybody can go in their garage and make copies from a worn out vhs and sell them. ------- H.D. Cinema does a somewhat decent light weight restoration so the picture quality is better than a lot of other companys (but not as good as the original out of production paramount version) Don't expect anything close to criterion standards.  That said, there is no criterion version available.  Also you do get 2 discs with this combo pack.

SYNOPSIS--
As a pre-teen, Martha (Stanwyck) murders her old maid aunt (Anderson) by pushing the wealthy witch down a staircase. Her young friend Walter O'Neal (Douglas) witnesses the crime and later coerces a now super-rich Martha into marrying him. She helps Walter become Iverstown's D.A. Together they frame an innocent man for the long-ago killing and see him hanged.

All this happens before Martha's childhood love, Sam Masterson (Heflin) returns to town accompanied by Toni Marachek (Scott), a gal he befriended at a bus station. Martha tries to pick up where she and Sam left off, before he disappeared that fateful night.

The alcoholic Walter abuses his power of office in an effort to force Sam to go away, but this renewed rival for Martha's affections is determined to discover the O'Neals' secret. What he learns leads to tragedy. Highest recommendation!

545233,3,6303038727,"This film has not aged well but it is interesting to see what people found entertaining. This one must have been in public domain for a long time because it's been easily available for years. It's shot like a standard film noir, well acted but a bit corny. I remember seeing it when I was a lot younger and not thinking any of this. I give it 3 stars not because of the film or acting but for the half baked transfer. It looks like a bad 35 mm transfer or possibly a 16 mm transfer. Disappointing but for a few bucks, I guess I should not complain. A cleaned up print would have made it better. It has a classic ending. Barbara Stanwyck must have been a really interesting person, there were better Classic Hollywood Actresses but not many with her range and variety. She could make you laugh, play a tough dame murderess and pull it all off with class.

(I'm not giving anything away, except to remark that Lizbeth Scott made a nice little niche for herself in the 40s, playing a blonde version of Lauren Bacall; I'm sure the latter worked exclusively with Bogie.)
There are reviews that say Image Entertainment makes the only good prints of Stanwyck, and that everything else is cheap retreads of public domain copies.

545311,4,6303038727,"Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin and Kirk Douglas play cat-and-mouse in THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS (1946), a peculiar noir/melodrama hybrid which has a fascinating story premise with enough twists and turns to keep its audience guessing right up until its unexpected conclusion.

The industrial city of Iverstown is run with an iron fist by Martha Ivers (Barbara Stanwyck), who inherited the whole shebang after a traumatic childhood incident which resulted in the death of her aunt.  Married to meek, alcoholic Walter O'Neil (Douglas) who is running for District Attorney, Martha and Walter's lives are turned upside-down when childhood friend Sam Masterson (Heflin) returns out of the blue for a reunion - or has he returned for a far more sinister purpose?  Sam was also in attendance on the night Martha's aunt was killed - the night when Martha and Walter became forever bound together by guilt and blackmail.  Now they fear that Sam has his own hefty asking-price for his continued silence...

A delicious tale of doomed love and sickening paranoia, THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS combines the best aspects of noir, but coats it all in a sleek melodramatic sheen which makes it thoroughly irresistible.  Barbara Stanwyck delivers handsomely as Martha, but she has some tough competition in her female co-star Lizabeth Scott (in only her second film), who threatens to walk away with the entire picture on more than one occasion.  Scott plays Toni Marachek, an ex-con (and one of the film's genuinely-likeable characters) who gets caught up in the drama when she befriends Heflin's Sam.

THE STRANGE LOVE OF MARTHA IVERS is notable in that it marked the official film debut of Kirk Douglas.  The film also features Judith Anderson, Roman Bohnen and Ann Doran.  Janis Wilson, who plays the young Martha in the prologue sequence, also co-starred with Stanwyck in ""My Reputation"" that same year.",1371513600,,1901,5.083601286173633

The story is compelling and a very interesting study under the microscope of human fears and other emotions, consequent behaviors and how they lead to decisions---ultimately to end in a life lived.  If i could change one thing it would be the casting of the non-dominant female, just out of prison and full of shame.  Having said that, the significance of that role imo is to ultimately put a smiley face on an otherwise really intense, and driving story.  love, maureen",1366243200,,622,4.9423076923076925

545317,4,6303038727,"Martha is strange alright, but love? It appears she never had much opportunity in the circle of her formative year to become acquainted with the genuine article. Her dye is permanently cast by the time the old boyhood friend shows up again. You only get to actual love with Sam, who managed to develop into a sensitive and caring man. Even as a youth, he seemed to be the only experience of that Martha had in her life. It seems probable that his influence would have helped soften her warp, had he been able to stay around.

I had trouble focusing on the unfolding at the beginning due to recognition of the aunt, Judith Anderson. Why, that's Mrs. Danvers from ""Rebecca."" Same creepy type of woman.

**Possible spoiler paragraph** It is interesting to watch this again with what you learn from the first viewing, about Sam, being about what he doesn't know. You watch it the first time with Martha and Walter thinking that Sam is back to cash in on what he knows about the aunt's demise. You know better than that, that the return is accidental. But you have no reason not to think he saw what happened on the stairs. When he seems pretty indifferent to the event as he reacquaints, you think, well, he doesn't care or has decided to ignore it. But then we learn that he left the house before it happened. Interesting to watch it again with that in mind.

Everyone notices Kirk Douglas in this, his first picture. He's so attractive you wish for him to be a stronger character. Didn't have to wait very long for that to come about. There were a couple more weak guy roles, and then he took off with mastery. And, a case could be made for it requiring ability to play a weak type as well as a stronger one.

Van Heflin - Something very attractive about him. He was almost always a guy with inner stability, aiding the balance of those around him, usually women. To me, that inner quality WAS his attractiveness. He's the one that could always walk into a mess and immediately start sorting it out.

Lizabeth Scott had a certain strong allure that seemed to go better with a stronger character. But here she is once more a pathetic dame, the recipient of Sam's good nature. Those weepy, tragic types showed up a lot in the streetwise pictures of the era. Usually, they have some guy like Sam trying to bolster them up because some bully type is grinding them down, seemingly having no strength of their own.

There's a classic, perhaps unintentionally funny segment that takes place on Toni's rooming house steps. She asks Sam for the time, a cigarette and a light in rapid sequence. His reactive look is great. That segment gets used from time to time in a collage of old movie clips.

Barbara Stanwyck is at the height of her beauty here or maybe one of her more glamorous roles. She seemed slated to be an evil woman or remembered most for those roles. In contrast, I recall her in a very early picture called ""The Mad Miss Manton,"" in which she is an airhead going somewhere to leak. Of course, she was very young and new and it was something that she would naturally move away from to go on to other things. But she was really fun to watch in that.

If you don't mind walking on the dark side a bit (mild comparatively), this is an interesting one to watch.",1351296000,,3261,4.441471571906354

545372,4,6303038727,"[The VHS version film stopped in the middle, with color bars.  After I fast-forwarded, the film returned.  Very odd!]

The Strange Love of Martha Ivers was quite a film with Kirk Douglas' first appearance in film and a very young Barbara Stanwick, whose fear and greed really drive the film.

Themes:

A young girl and a young boy both have a history of running away and again they get caught.  The boy, Sam, escapes but the girl gets to confront her aunt and gets a slap across the face for her trouble by her scheming aunt.

The themes of fear of being caught, having to lie, cheat and steal to get ahead, permeate the script.

After a murder of her aunt, Martha grows up to inherit all property and money and ends up marrying Walter, a ""scared little boy"" who is now district attorney of Iverstown.  Trouble is, Sam has returned, a victim of an auto accident.  And boy, he really gets it!

Action:

As in any film noir, we have tough talk, threats and fists flying.  This film was no different.  Sam meets a blonde drifter fresh out of jail.  Again the theme of betrayal as she makes up a story to get him ""worked over"" by the DA boys to scare him out of town.  Sam doesn't scare easy.

Great lines:

""The only trouble with you kid is that you need a break!""

Martha Ivers: You've *killed* before, it's in your record.
Sam Masterson: *I* never *murdered*.

Bottom Line:  Mistaken purposes, a blonde jail bird and some pretty tricky love triangles pepper a decent film noir.  Moves slow at times and the surprise ending is a bit contrived, but the strong acting and a few fist fights save it!  Recommended.

Cast

Barbara Stanwyck  -  Martha Ivers
Van Heflin  -  Sam Masterson

545373,5,6303038727,"The story opens in 1928, as rebellious teen Martha Ivers is trying to run away from her mean and powerful aunt. Helping Martha is her pal from across the tracks, Sam. They never do escape that night, but something far more dramatic happens involving Martha, her aunt, and a kitten named Bundles.

I really enjoyed this movie, which is an unusual mix of film noir, melodrama, romance, and mystery. Barbara Stanwyck plays grown-up Martha and is perfectly cast as a tough-as-nails and utterly ruthless woman. Her husband is well-played by Kirk Douglas, in his film debut. He's very young but very confident and convincing as an alcoholic loser. The real star of the show is Van Heflin who plays grown-up Sam, a street-wise charmer who can handle himself in a fight. Heflin is handsome, charismatic, and very sympathetic and reminded me of a young William Holden. He is paired with sultry Lizabeth Scott, who was made for film noir tough gal parts.

The script is clever and fast-paced and I was on the edge of my seat right up to the very satisfying ending. If you like gritty, character-driven dramas with plenty of twists and turns, you'll like this movie.",1339718400,,1155,4.77
545374,4,6303038727,"Ya, a woman can get under your skin, no question, no question at all, in 1940 or 2010 makes no difference. Now two guys tugging away is an even tougher story, especially  when the dame is a heartless femme fatale like Barbara Stanwyck who plays the woman under their skins in the title of this crime noir, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers. Now Barbara Stanwyck was never my beaux ideal of a femme fatale, I run more to the Rita Hayworth hot-blooded Gilda-types (with that strand of hair over the eyes) but I could see where guys, normally sensible guys, would be running through hoops in order to win her favors. And she would give them the ""kiss of death,"" that hard-hearted kiss of death mentioned above. Take no prisoners, none.

A little plot line of the story goes a long way to figuring out those charms, those decidely not girlish, not 1940s girlish anyway, charms. Rebellious Martha, an orphan being brought up to be a lady by an old-school rich aunt wants none of it and keeps running away, aided and abetted by ragamuffin, wrong side of the tracks Sam, played by Van Heflin. As the film opens she is being brought back after one such caper, scolded by her aunt assisted by Kirk Douglas's father, Martha's tutor (Douglas plays Walter, the other love interest in this dance of death combination). When dear cruel auntie (played by Judith Andersen, who knew how to play that kind of role to a tee) tries to confront Martha just as she is getting ready to fly the coop again with Sam, with Walter swore to secrecy, she just happens to fall down the long flight of stairs. After less than one shedded tear the trio (Martha, Walter, and his dear old money-grubbing dad) work up a story and stick to it, stick to it to well because to make it stick ultimately  they have some unnamed vagabond lug eventually go the the chair for their misdeed. Meanwhile Sam, figuring that Martha has gotten cold feet, blows town on the next train out, a circus train.

Fast forward eighteen years. Sam, passing through town, decides to see what has happened since he blew town. Well Martha and Walter have gotten loveless married (loveless on her part, naturally) to seal their part of the pact with death, Walter for crazed-out love, Martha to keep him on a leash. Martha who turns out to be a pretty good businesswoman basically runs the town now. But here is the kicker, guilt-ridden about how they obtained their ill-gotten gains our blessed married couple think Sam is here for a shake-down thinking he saw what happened that long ago night when auntie went crashing down the stairs. Of course Sam had no idea of the sort until things start to unravel around his new-found girlfriend, sweet, husky voiced Lizabeth Scott who has her own troubles with the law. The long and short of it is that Martha is still carrying the torch for Samn, Walter is getting more drunken crazy for Martha and sweet hard-luck Liz looks to be holding an empty bag when Martha puts her whammy on Sam.

There can be no happy ending here, right? Well, right but only part right. This murder most foul has put a death grip on Martha and Walter, a death grip that is triggered by Sam's reappearance but also that nasty little deal of creating a fall guy for their misdeeds. So you know, know just as well as I do that the fates are against them. As for Sam and Liz, well they get out with the skin of their teeth but they get out. Once again, you know the routine, crime doesn't pay, one way of the other it eats away at you. Got it.",1323734400,,3498,4.467918622848201
545375,5,6303038727,"Rain is falling hard as this dark noir melodrama opens, and after the night is over, it will always be raining for Martha Ivers. Lewis Milestone directed this tale of a life-long guilt that festers until misplaced suspicion destroys one person and puts another out of her misery. There are good performances from a great cast, none better than Lizabeth Scott's as a girl down on her luck and hoping against the odds for something good to happen. She is the outside element to three lives bound together since childhood by a crime that has haunted two of them into adulthood.

This is a strange noir in many respects, mostly due to Milestone allowing the moviegoer to see the story in chronological order, rather than using flashbacks. It creates sympathy for the twisted Martha Ivers, because the audience understands how one selfish moment in her youth set her on a coarse she can never change. It has been raining inside her ever since, and will always keeps coming. At the same time, however, we are rooting for the vulnerable Scott, hoping she'll be the victor in a battle she's not sure she can win.

Judith Anderson is Mrs. Ivers, little Martha's (Janis Wilson) aunt. She's none too nice and on a rainy night Martha causes her death in the heat of the moment, only her pal Walter (Mickey Kuhn) a witness. They both believe their friend Sam (Darryl Hickman) witnessed the deed, and that knowledge will haunt them and rule their lives for years to come.

Nearly two decades later Sam Masterson (Van Heflin) has an accident just outside of Iverstown. It brings back memories of when he was a brash kid, and the girl who now controls both Walter (Kirk Douglas) and the town. He meets the lovely Toni Marachek (Lizabeth Scott) on his first night there and lends her a hand. Fresh from jail and hoping to start over, Toni falls for Sam, but fate may slam the door in her face when his ties to Iverstown come to light.

Barbara Stanwyck is the adult Martha, married to the weaker of the boys from her youth, Walter. She always wished it had been Sam who'd stayed that night so long ago, and even when she thinks he's there to blackmail them, she can't help but throw herself at him. She flaunts her feelings for Sam in front of Walter, thinking she has it over on him because he loves her. He may have more courage than she does, however, as their twisted relationship becomes strained further by Sam's return.

Heflin is solid as always and this is one of the great neglected noirs of the 1940's. Douglas is very good in his first screen role and Stanwyck's portrayal of the sad and sick Martha Ivers can stand proudly with any she played in the 1940's. Though her screen time is less by comparison, it is Scott who steals this film, however, as Toni is easily the most memorable character. Even when she isn't around, we are thinking about her plight, wondering what will become of her.

If you want a really fine print, the Paramount one is the one to go with, but many watchable ones are out there. This is one only for those with PAL compatible equipment, which is mostly outside the US. One of the truly great noirs.",1320364800,,3121,4.534635879218473

SYNOPSIS--
As a pre-teen, Martha (Stanwyck) murders her old maid aunt (Anderson) by pushing the wealthy witch down a staircase. Her young friend Walter O'Neal (Douglas) witnesses the crime and later coerces a now super-rich Martha into marrying him. She helps Walter become Iverstown's D.A. Together they frame an innocent man for the long-ago killing and see him hanged.

All this happens before Martha's childhood love, Sam Masterson (Heflin) returns to town accompanied by Toni Marachek (Scott), a gal he befriended at a bus station. Martha tries to pick up where she and Sam left off, before he disappeared that fateful night.

The alcoholic Walter abuses his power of office in an effort to force Sam to go away, but this renewed rival for Martha's affections is determined to discover the O'Neals' secret. What he learns leads to tragedy. Highest recommendation!

Martha has dissassociated from all her guilt and lives in power and contempt of her husband. She controls her world and feeds on it. Sam comes back and finds out that he wants to live a life with cleanness and love rather than money and deceit. Martha is a lost soul and it is sad to see her recognize this and come out of her denial. She sees her life as either a barter with denial or death. This is sad. She and her husband are bound by secrets and pain. This ultimately does them in. Sam witnesses and flees with the painful knowledge and finds the freedom of life and love. The things I liked, I would like to know more about film noir, I liked that he actually joined a circus and bought the circus animals. I feel sad for Martha and think that she suffered. The ending was when you heard the pain of what she lived with while her aunt was alive. The beautiful apparel of Martha was stunning, she didn't change clothes to much but she wore elegance. The bible was a metaphor in the film and seemed to impact Sam throughout his adulthood.

This is a pretty good little film noir. Kirk Douglas made his film debut in it. Stanwyck plays the title role. The film opens with Stanwyck and Heflin as kids who are close friends. Stanwyck is the heiress to a manufacturing fortune and is under the guardianship of her stern aunt, played by Anderson. Heflin is from the ""wrong side of the tracks"", and Anderson disapproves of Stanwyck's friendship with him. Douglas plays the young son of Anderson's business manager. Stanwyck hates her aunt vehemently and is openly defiant towards her. During a quarrel between Stanwyck and Anderson, Anderson falls down a staircase. Angry, and filled with hatred, Stanwyck picks up Anderson's cane and beats her to death. Douglas and his father witness the event but the ambitious father agrees to report it as an accident in order to ensure his son's future. Both Stanwyck and Douglas believe that Heflin had also witnessed the killing and then fled from the house. The truth was that Heflin had run out of the house as soon as the aunt fell, and did not witness the murder; he had also hopped a freight train and left the town(appropriately named, Iverstown). Flash-forward some 18 years and Heflin happens to be passing back through Iverstown when he wrecks his car and has to layover in town while the car is repaired. Heflin meets Scott, who has just been evicted from her apartment. The two strike up a conversation and Heflin offers to secure Scott a room at the same hotel he's staying in(separate, but adjoining, rooms). Heflin decides to pay Stanwyck a visit, for auld lang syne, and discovers that she has come into her inheritance and pretty much runs the town. She has also entered into a loveless(on her end) ""marriage of convenience"" with Douglas, who is now the District Attorney. Believing that Heflin had witnessed the murder of Anderson, Douglas immediately jumps to the conclusion that Heflin wants to blackmail Stanwyck and him. As the film progresses, Heflin and Scott begin to fall in love and Stanwyck reveals to Heflin that she is in love with him---but, he's not interested. The film takes the usual twists and turns characteristic of noir and eventually ends with Stanwyck and Douglas dead as a result of a murder/suicide and Heflin and Scott heading into the sunset with Iverstown in the rear-view mirror.

I enjoyed this film and I would recommend it to fans of noir or the cast---everyone turns in a good performance, including Douglas, who makes an impressive film debut.",1265414400,2,2634,4.959276018099548

545430,5,6303038727,"Anyone who appreciates the films of Douglas Sirk will appreciate this superb melodrama, seething with fear, guilt, sex, and retribution.  Stanwyck and Douglas are perfect as a venomous married couple bound together by a guilty secret.  Heflin and Scott are good as well.  Rossen's script and Milestone's direction are brilliant and precisely calibrated to be just over-the-top enough to suit the feverish story.  The plot is totally unpredictable with scene after scene chock-full of surprising twists and tough, memorable dialogue.

My only criticisms would be the awful title (don't know who came up with that clunker) and the violent scenes, which are a bit hokey, thanks to the censorship of the period.  The killing of the aunt should shock us, not look a bit silly -- but realistic violence was not permitted in movies at this time.  (Which was not such a bad thing, considering the tedious bloodbaths we've been subjected to since the fall of censorship.)

The complexity of these characters, and the emotional intensity of their interactions, are unforgettable.  When Stanwyck's icy composure breaks down, over the campfire, her desperation is so naked and real, you almost gasp.

If you're the type of viewer who doesn't care for stories that focus on women, or films that ratchet up the emotional intensity to extreme levels, stay away.

It's a little too talky for my tastes yet I still enjoyed it because the acting is top-shelf, the dialog is fun and you get involved with the characters. The film could have used more action. With the 'soap' angle, it reminded me a bit of another melodramatic noir, Mildred Pierce, except the latter is a better film.

545482,4,6303038727,"Not only does Kirk Douglas convince in his film debut as smarmy, alcoholic, and weak-willed, but the great Barbara Stanwyck also does her thing as a domineering, dominating one-woman empire, driven by power and, as we see somewhat later in the film, lust.

But guilt is part of the picture too. Stanwyck, in the title role, was responsible when much younger for the demise of her equally domineering aunt, played with gusto by Dame Judith Anderson (before she became a dame--meaning, of course, given that title by British royalty). Douglas, as Walter O'Neil, the bespectacled (when younger) son of a greedy hanger-on to the Ivers fortune, was witness to what Martha did and never revealed the truth after she, Walter, and Walter's greedy, weak-willed father (like father, like son) lie to the authorities about how Martha's aunt died.

Sam, a much stronger guy--physically, but more so emotionally--than Walter, was Martha's friend, also when younger, and he grows up to be Van Heflin who, for some reason I can't quite fathom, every woman swoons over. Probably because of his physique, I guess. Well, anyway, he comes back to Iverstown--yep, even the town is named after Martha's family--after a stretch in the armed forces and bumps into the ever-gravelly-voiced Lizabeth Scott as Toni Marachek, a cute kid who's just gotten out of the slammer. They hit it off, but Sam is there to do more than meet a babe by accident.

Sparks fly when he and Martha meet for the first time in 18 years, but these are weird sparks indeed, and before you can say ""Guilty, guilty, guilty"" a few times, Martha, Sam, and Walter all have this dark stuff going on--a combination of lust and guilt--that is the real crux of this movie.

The ending is maybe too melodramatic, and the score by Miklos Rosza is absolutely too melodramatic as well. In spite of this, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers is a strong entry in the film noir canon and well worth watching, if not owning.",1191024000,,1956,4.795252225519288

Van Heflin's performance is flat and Lizabeth Scott's performance is as wooden as a pine plank. Stanwyck's role and performance is more credible, but not as absorbing in later films such as Sorry Wrong Number and Double Indemnity. Kirk Douglas is very good in his first major Hollywood role as an alcoholic district attorney who fears that the appearance of a childhood friend (Heflin) will destroy the upper class lifestyle he enjoys with his wife (Stanwyck). The reunion between the Heflin character and Stanwyck's character is awkardly filmed and dramatized.  Meanwhile we are left to believe that the nomadic Lizabeth Scott character still can't find the nerve to leave town.  For some reason, for me anyway, the town looked liked it was situated somewhere near Pittsburg,  Pa. I thought the ending of the film was a bit histrionic, but still an interesting ending.

545522,5,6303038727,"This review is for the 2005 Paramount DVD release.

The story starts out in 1928 in a small industrial town known as Iverstown.  A young teenage girl named Martha Ivers and a teenage boy named Sam Masterson try to hop a train and escape.  Martha is caught and is returned to her wealthy aunt's mansion.  The animosity between Martha and her aunt is a volatile as fire and gasoline.  That same evening a boy named Walter O'Neil and his father visit the Ivers' mansion to take credit for helping the police find Martha with the unspoken expectation of receiving a major reward, but only receive a poultry payment of ice cream and cake for Walter.  Later that evening there is a power outage and Sam sneaks into the Ivers Mansion in hopes of taking Martha away on the next train out of town.  Martha's aunt goes upstairs to see what is going on, while Sam narrowly escapes as a fight ensues between Martha and her aunt.  With Walter watching, Martha strikes her aunt with her aunt's walking cane and she topples down a long staircase and immediately dies.  With Walter O'Neil's interests in mind, Walter's father ignores any hint of foulplay by Martha and wishfully believes Martha's story that her aunt was murdered by an unknown intruder and reports this crime to the police.  Meanwhile Sam hops a circus train and leaves Iverstown.

Fast forward to 1946 and we find an alchoholic Walter (played by Kirk Douglas) and Martha (Barbara Stanwyck) are now married to each other.  Walter is the local District Attorney and Martha is the sole heiress to the Ivers' industrial empire.  Sam Masterson (Van Heflin) passes through Iverstown for the first time since 1928, but has a minor car accident and decides to stay in town overnight to get his car fixed.  While waiting, he meets an attractive woman named Toni Marachek (Lizabeth Scott) who seems desperate for companionship.  They stay in the same hotel, in adjoining rooms, and Sam finds out that Toni was just released from jail.  Sam is sympathetic and reassures Toni that her past has no bearing on their future relationship.  The next morning Sam finds out that Toni was arrested for a parole violation.  Sam discovers that same morning that Walter is the DA and visits him to see if he can help get Toni back on the street.  During the visit, Martha drops in and she is elated to see Sam and it becomes obvious that Walter is jealous of Martha's attention to Sam.  When Sam leaves, Walter and Martha convince themselves that Sam's visit was solely for the purpose of blackmailing them for Martha's crime that Sam witnessed.  This sets up the remainder of the movie for plenty of drama and suspense as the four main characters involve themselves in passion, deceit and greed.

The movie is riveting from beginning to end.  The story is absolutely brilliant in depicting how trust and deceit work against each other no matter how rewarding the stakes may be and also exposes that when lives are built on a foundation of vile acts, the foundation will eventually crumble.  I also enjoyed that in spite of the four main characters revealing their despicable human flaws, the movie ends with a redeeming message.  Lizabeth Scott does a superb job in her supporting role.

The DVD quality is very good overall.  The contrast was at times washed out and the there were also traces of minor film deterioration appearing intermittantly throughout the film.  But overall, the presentation was still very enjoyable.  There were no bonuses on this DVD.

545523,5,6303038727,"It's pouring rain as this dark noir melodrama opens, and after the night is over, it will always be raining for Martha Ivers. Lewis Milestone directed this tale of a life-long guilt that has festered until misplaced suspicion destroys one person and puts another out of her misery. There are good performances from a great cast, none better than Lizabeth Scott's as a girl down on her luck and hoping against the odds for something good to happen. She is the outside element to three lives bound together since childhood by a crime that has haunted two of them into adulthood.

This is a strange noir in many respects, mostly due to Milestone allowing the moviegoer to see the story in chronological order, rather than using flashbacks. It creates sympathy for the twisted Martha Ivers, because we know how one selfish moment of hatred in her youth set her on a coarse she can not change. It has been raining inside her ever since, until the water is sick and stagnant, but it always keeps coming. At the same time, however, we are rooting for the vulnerable Scott, hoping she'll be the victor in a battle she's not sure she can win.

Judith Anderson is Mrs. Ivers, little Martha's (Janis Wilson) aunt. She's none too nice and on a rainy night Martha causes her death in the heat of the moment, only her pal Walter (Mickey Kuhn) a witness. But they both think their friend Sam (Darryl Hickman) saw the crime also, and ran away. He did run away, but before the event that would change their lives forever.

It is nearly two decades later, and the adult Sam Masterson (Van Heflin) has an accident just outside of Iverstown. It brings back memories of when he was a brash kid, and the girl who now controls both Walter (Kirk Douglass) and the town. He meets the lovely Toni Marachek (Lizabeth Scott) on his first night there and helps her out a bit. She is fresh from jail and though Sam is a WWII veteran, his past is nothing to sneeze at either. There is something beginning between them but fate may decide Toni's future as a past Sam was no part of intrudes on the present.

Barbara Stanwyck is the adult Martha, married to the weaker of the boys from her youth, Walter. But you can tell she always wished it had been Sam who'd stayed that night so long ago. Even though they think he's there to blackmail them, she can't help but throw herself at him, even though she is too far gone on the inside for anything like real love. She does this right in front of her weak husband Walter, who may be more courageous in the end than Martha. Martha has it over on Walter because he loves her, but he is a constant reminder of the past for her. What they have together is a sick and twisted version of the real thing.

The relationship of Sam and Walter sort of mirrors their childhood but Heflin starts to feel sick about it and begins to like Walter, especially when he finally understands why they are so scared he'll tell something he didn't even know about. It's one thing to kill someone, but quite another to let someone else hang for it. All the while Toni has little moments with Sam, hoping it's enough to make him care, and blow Iverstown forever.

Even at the bitter end, there is that moment when you see in Matha's eyes, ever so briefly, that little girl again, and feel sympathy. Douglass is very good in his first screen role and Stanwyck's portrayel of the sad and sick Martha Ivers can stand proudly with any she played in the 1940's. Though her screen time is less by comparison, it is Scott who steals this film, however, as Toni is easily the most memorable character. Even when she isn't around, we are thinking about her plight, wondering where she's at and what will happen to her.

Heflin is solid as always and this is one of the great neglected noirs of the 1940's. There is a great ending where both couples get what they really want, and neither will look back on Iverstown anymore.",1126396800,11,3905,4.46078431372549

I purchased the Image Entertainment DVD of Strange Love (ASIN: 6305944369) and can tell you it's probably the best print of the film you're going to find. Picture sharpness is good, sound is acceptable, and there are no missing frames to cause a ""jumpy"" picture. The brightness & contrast are normal for most of the film, except for a few early scenes where the picture looks washed out and grey. According to the research I've read, after this film dropped into the public domain, no one took the responsibility for preserving it, and as a result the best surviving print has suffered a lot of deterioration. However, I can easily recommend the Image Entertainment version of Strange Love Of Martha Ivers. Please note, that is NOT a blanket endorsement of all Image Entertainment DVD's -- for example, they did a TERRIBLE job on another Lizabeth Scott movie, Too Late For Tears -- it looks as bad as anything from Alpha or Gotham, yet Image charges a premium price for it.

545571,5,6303038727,"Sam Masterson left Iverstown with a traveling circus as a boy in 1928. 18 years later, having been everywhere and done his share of everything, including being a decorated war veteran, Sam (Van Heflin) finds himself back in Iverstown when he has car trouble as he is heading out West. He intends only to stay a day, and has the fortune to meet a young woman named Toni (Lizabeth Scott) whom he likes very much en route to his hotel. But when the town's first lady, Martha Ivers (Barbara Stanwyck) and her District Attorney husband, Walter (Kirk Douglas), who were childhood friends of Sam's, find out he is in town, they are immediately suspicious. Jealous over Martha's past affection for Sam and paranoid about his own political career, Walter assumes that Sam has come to stir up trouble concerning the untimely death of Martha's Aunt 18 years before. And Walter starts plotting against him.

The film's title very nearly says it all. ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"" is about just that: the nature of the affection that Martha has had for Sam since she was a girl and how it  influences her actions when she sees him again. The film was directed by Lewis Milestone on what looks like a substantial budget. ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"" is a slicker production than is often associated with film noir. It was written by Robert Rossen, who adapted the screenplay from John Patrick's short story ""Love Lies Bleeding"", as yet unpublished at the time the film was made. The incomparable Barbara Stanwyck once again proves herself to be the queen of noir. Martha Ivers is a complex, inscrutable, and ruthless character, whom Stanwyck plays to perfection. This is Kirk Douglas' first film role and one of his most memorable. Walter is alcoholic, racked with guilt, manipulative, ruthless, but very much in love with his domineering wife. Douglas' performance reveals Walter in all of his pathetic intricacy. Van Heflin is wonderful as the film's ""everyman"" fighting to survive in circumstances beyond his control. Sam reminds me of the protagonist in another wonderful classic film noir, ""D.O.A."". Both characters are victims of circumstance. But in this case, the situation is beyond Sam's control because he isn't aware that there is a situation. It 's the things you don't know that hurt you. I found ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"" complex, sinister characters fascinating. It has just the right amount of gleeful cynicism. And I thoroughly enjoyed the film's unpredictability. It has become one of my favorite classic noirs, due in large part to its well-drawn villainous duo. I encourage fans of the genre to give it a try.

545572,4,6303038727,"The real leading lady of this film is Lizbeth Scott. She's just gotten out of jail and there is not a hair mussed. Also, check out the scene where Scott's character is in the hotel room wearing play clothes and looking stunning with Stanwyck staring at her. I can't believe that Scott was portrayed as the jealous one in that scene.
Many reviewers forget that this film has two separate plots that eventually merge. The fate of Kirk Douglas' character in the end was for moral purposes that would not be necessary today. Overall, a very entertaining show.",1073606400,,555,4.673469387755102
545573,4,6303038727,"Van Heflin is a gambler who returns to his hometown and gets tangled up with some childhood friends.  He left town the night Martha killed her cold-hearted aunt, a murder that was successfully covered up.  Now the grown-up Martha, played by Barbara Stanwyck, and especially her weak husband, played by Kirk Douglas, fear he might reveal what happened that night.  Heflin gets involved with Lizabeth Scott, a convict, who fears his past relationship with Stanwyck will take Heflin from her.  In this film noir, none of the characters is particularly likeable, each trying to protect themselves.  There is some biting dialogue and effective use of music, although sometimes it becomes a little overpowering.  Stanwyck is terrific as usual, really delivering in the latter scenes.  Douglas is too strong of a presence to play the weak, manipulated husband, and would have been better off trading with Heflin.  Scott has a strange screen presence, and although it fits the character somewhat, she never seems quite comfortable.  But the characters are fascinating (typical for film noir) and the story is really interesting, despite the poor choice of a title.  Since so much of this film centres on guilt and how difficult it can be to escape one's past, I think a better title for the film would have been The Guilt of Martha Ivers.",1031443200,2,1330,4.97737556561086

7835924,2,6303038727,"The acting talent seemed wasted in this rather dull film about a murder that took place 18 years ago. I toyed around with the idea of each of the actors switching roles. What, for example, would the film have been if Barbara Stanwyck had taken Toni's role and Kirk Douglas had played Sam? I thought Van Heflin seemed more suited to the meek, devoted Walter O'Connor role. Another idea I had was to begin the film with the ending and show the rest of the film as a flashback. Not sure if those ideas would've helped, though.",1512086400,,523,4.402061855670103

7835926,4,6303038727,"This is a tragic tale that depicts how a love can continue for close to two decades where the couple do not see each other and each goes their own way, and it shows how a mistake can effect one's life and make one miserable. The 1946 black and white film stars Barbara Stanwyck when she was at her prime, Van Heflin acting as a man who was once poor is now a gambler, and Kirk Douglas in his first film role, acting very well as a drunk suffering from the mistake.
The story begins in 1928 and shows the above-mentioned three as youngsters. We see that Barbara has a close relationship and dependence on Van, who does not reciprocate, and Kirk is a wimp. Barbara hates her very rich aunt who is beating Barbara's cat. Trying to stop her aunt, Barbara accidentally kills her. Later, she identifies an innocent man as the killer and Kirk as a prosecutor argues his guilt. The man is executed. Barbara and Kirk wonder if Van saw the murder and would reveal what happened.
Then, in 1946, Van happens to come to the town. He had no intention of staying, but his car was involved in a crash outside of town and he wants to stay in a hotel overnight until it is fixed. Barbara uses the time to try to persuade Van to kill Kirk who she does not love and who drinks because of his involvement in the death of the aunt and because his wife does not love him. We are led to wonder if Barbara loves Van or is just using him. Kirk is certain that Van came to blackmail him and his wife.",1504828800,,1473,4.190140845070423
