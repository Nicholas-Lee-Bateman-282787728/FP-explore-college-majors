8107315,3,B000E8N9GA,"This film seems to be a suspenseful thriller, and it is, but it has a strange ending that some like, and I'm not sure that I like at all.  The Bridges character returns to England after being in America and gone for some six years in the hope to rekindle the love affair he had with an English lady. When he gets off the plane, he requests a light from a man also departing, and that man is shot from a distance. All passengers on the flight are interrogated by Scotland Yard, and he discovers that the dead man was a criminal. He expected to be met by the woman he wants to reengage with (It is not explained why he left her for six years), but she is not at the airport to meet him despite he receiving a letter indicating she would be at the airport to meet him. He then finds out that during the past six years she was sexually involved with this criminal, the one who was murdered, and Scotland Yard want to know what is going on, just as he does.",1512604800,2,952,4.090909090909091

8107317,3,B000E8N9GA,"Fun and entertaining mystery starring a young Lloyd Bridges and Moira Lister in an atypical non-bitch role.

Lloyd plays Frank Prior, veteran of the allied invasion, returning to England six years after the end of the war to rekindle his love affair with stage actress Pauline French, Lister's character. However, things take a turn toward the bizarre as a fellow passenger on his flight is gunned down by an assassin's bullet. And things only get worse as Frank sadly realizes that his love is somehow connected to increasingly strange happenings and bizarre incidents.

Was caught off guard with the ending. While my fellow reviewers see it as a ""cheat"", I'm not sure what they weren't given or what wasn't delivered - a twist is a twist. Filmmaker's choice as far as I can tell. Felt it was a surprising, if unexplained, event some 40 years before '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crying-Game/dp/B0006FO9BK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crying Game</a>' reintroduced the 'wow-did-not-see-that-coming' effect.

I hear modernism in that complaint. One shouldn't view a film from the present, and therefore, jaded perspective. I really believe you have to learn to appreciate a movie as it was intended and presented during time of its release - in this case - 1953. There weren't too many of these kinds of films and this type of 'gotcha' finale was quite fresh back then.

My biggest issue focuses on the incredibly poor choice of crows-feet laden Helene Cordet as the stage singer/blackmailer. Three reasons:

- One, she's truly unappealing. I had a very difficult time whenever the scene called for her to vamp it up. Yikes. Three bags of ugly served on a silver platter - is still three bags of ugly.

- Two, the unnecessary and completely wasted time the film spent with her ""singing"" - a screeching and cawed mockery of vocalization that prompted using the mute button as an absolute necessity.

- Three, I get the sense that co-directors Cy Endfield and Charles De la Tour traded favors for screen time. Just an opinion. <hands raised in defense>

Adding to my general sense of 'WhaThe?' was even more time spent wasted on the various Vaudevillian acts - what exactly was the point to all that? Certainly didn't lend itself to any character quality or reveal any substantive plot devices. Bizarre.

Finally: I've had very bad experiences with Alpha Video products, but decided on commenting directly via the film's individual listing, as opposed to the version I screened via Platinum Disc Corporation's '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystery-Classics/dp/B000CC1TNI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystery Classics</a>' bundled dvd. Their version of this public-domain flick was decent and the audio solid - likely a better choice if you decide to purchase a copy. My only complaint in that regard was the use of the Platinum logo briefly added to the film, presumably to identify ""their print"" in case of product theft. Technically, the bundle is listed under the Echo Bridge label, but that's not what appears on screen.",1330992000,,3108,5.352459016393443
8107318,4,B000E8N9GA,"Though the credits show ""directed by Charles De la Tour"", that's just a pseudondym for the blacklisted Cy Endfield, who after a fascinating if somewhat inconsistent early career was pushed into exile in Europe, from which he never returned. This is his first British film, and it carries over his fascination with magic, his pessimistic noir sensibility, and his ability to find odd bits of business with minor characters that really stand out.

Lloyd Bridges plays Frank Prior, an American returning to London after the war and several years to reconnect with an old flame, actress Pauline French (Moira Lister). While on the airport tarmac he witnesses the man standing right next to him get shot and killed by a sniper from long distance. The man carries no identification and is presumed to be ""Kendal Brown"" by Scotland Yard, which quickly takes over the case; the sniper is unknown. Prior is questioned a bit and let go, but quickly turns out to be the center of a mystery involving his ex-girlfriend, the widow of ""Brown"" (Hlne Cordet), blackmail and smuggling.

This is a very well-put-together and exciting Brit-noir, really excellent up until the last couple of reels which fall into place a little too easily - and in particular the last couple of minutes which turn everything around in the manner of a few other ""lighter"" noirs - but not nearly as successfully as, say, WOMAN IN THE WINDOW manages. Along the way there are lots of inventive touches though which keep the bad taste of the resolution from stinging too much: the sardonic, bitchy, yet entirely silent landlady's daughter (19-year-old Jean Marsh in her first role) who looks on the young Scotland Yard detective with amusement as he can't keep his eyes off her; the kids watching a forbidden TV murder mystery in secret while their parents watch it in another room - and while a couple fleeing the cops pass by; the magic trick performance punctuated by a cabaret song.

An odd mixed bag of a film, more fascinating than really good, but like most of Endfield's work (he's only really well known for the 1964 ZULU) certainly deserving of a little more respect.  There are currently only mediocre public domain copies in circulation; this Alpha Video copy isn't any worse than most, but the best way to obtain this is probably to get the VCI edition&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Scar-The-Limping-Man/dp/B0000C2IVH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Scar/The Limping Man</a>&nbsp;- for about the same price you get this film, the truly great THE SCAR, and a terrific 1950s noirish TV program.",1265673600,2,2612,5.124413145539906
