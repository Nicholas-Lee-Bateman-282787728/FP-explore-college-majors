8138644,5,B000HCWJXC,"Billy truly delivered a good fun workout with his favorite moves. I like the serious side to Taebo, but I also like the fun side as well and you will find fun in this workout. Exercise should always be fun. This isn't the first Taebo workout that I have done, where Billy included fun in the workout.

I believe that a person should always have fun exercising.

I recommend this 43 minute cardio workout to Taebo fans, even if you are a veteran in Taebo. I'm a veteran. I have been doing Taebo off and on since 1999 and trust me, this workout will make you sweat.",1290729600,2,563,4.252336448598131
8138645,5,B000HCWJXC,"I love this workout! Though I can say this about most of Billy's workout's, this one offers a well-rounded workout. Billy combines some of his, and mine, moves in a well-paced solid workout. The floor exercises give you a nice burn while firming up my trouble zones. Everyone should have this!",1228262400,2,293,4.764705882352941
