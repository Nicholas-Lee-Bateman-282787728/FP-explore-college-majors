3773576,5,B001R60ER0,Great documentary.  I watched it on the History channel and just had to own this DVD.  Very informative and really holds your interest.,1254096000,2,135,4.826086956521739
3773577,5,B001R60ER0,"An excellent series. As a Michigan resident I was mildly confused at firsts by references to a salt mine under Lake Huron, until I realized the research center for the project is at McGill U in Montreal.",1254096000,,203,4.513513513513513
3773578,3,B001R60ER0,"I can confirm that the aspect ratio on this set is 4:3 and the picture is letterboxed (and there are 4 disks, not 7). What a shame that this superb series would be released with such rotten visual quality when the original was broadcast in full high definition. Why on Earth would they do this? If you have an old 4:3 TV you will be happy with these, but the visual presentation on a high def TV will be a severe disappointment. The quality of information in this series is absolutely superb (unequivocal five stars) but the quality of the DVD presentation is terrible (one star) so an average of 3 stars from me. To repeat, the series itself is superb, the very best set of programs about geology I have ever seen. The information presentation is excellent and the visual presentation of the original broadcast was equally excellent and would be here also if they had just used a 16:9 aspect ratio. It is beyond understanding why they would treat this fine series in such a fashion when there was just no reason to do so.",1253491200,135,1022,4.470588235294118
3773579,3,B001R60ER0,"Has anyone seen it on these DVDs who can say whether it's widescreen or surrounded with black bars?
 I have the original single episode from 2007 on one DVD in 1:33:1 from ""Best of the History Channel, Vol. III 2007 Premier Collection (10 DVD Set)"".
 I watched the ""How the Earth Was Made"" series this year (2009) on the History Channel in HD widescreen. This listing now says it is 1:33:1 (I preordered it and it was sent before I knew what its aspect ratio was -amazon is often wrong in that respect, for instance:  this listing says 7 discs but there are 4. No biggee.).
It's a good series, but loses its appeal in such a small picture on a large screen and zooming it causes pixelation and stretched picture (the earth, sun, etc. are oblong, people's faces are distended). The box does not say its aspect ratio at all. I returned it based on the listing here. I didn't want to open the box because of Amazon's return policy -my period of return was due and there were no reviews here.

Update April, 2011
I bought the Blu-ray -SPECTACULAR! Vivid color, audio, aspect 16:9. Worth the wait.

3773592,5,B001R60ER0,"this series is awesome. incredibly informative and easy to digest. sometimes the narration is kind of over the top (focusing on the destructive power of xy or z) but not that big of a deal. I also love the scientists in the show -- again sometimes the narration wants to make things black or white -- but the scientists are super smart but also seem to love not knowing stuff; they clearly like to figure things out, to get an answer, but seem even more excited at the new questions that arise.

  For budding geologist's it is a good entry point. It gets your interest and if you want to explore further i am sure there are books or scientifically deeper video's to watch.

This series is fascinating and it's made even more spectacular by the HD video that can be fully appreciated on these Blu-Ray discs.

3773642,3,B001R60ER0,"It was good, but not good enough. Disappointing compared to the original feature documentary.

Not that this was terrible; it wasn't. It just didn't measure up to the high bar its predecessor set. Lots of repeated (and repeated, and repeated, and...) short video clips. Lot of repeated CGI, lots of flash and noise, overly dramatic music clips and narration. Lots of whiz-bang, but short on substance. Rather reminded me of a late-night used-car commercial.

They mentioned the Loch Ness Monster more times than I can count. Really?? Who gives a ... ??? Yes, they finally admitted that no, there are no leftover dinosaurs in Loch Ness (for one reason, the loch is only 10,000 years old), but COME ON! That ""monster"" never deserved a mention in the first place. All part of the attention-grabbing nonsense that this series has so much of.

It was still informative, but overall just too TV-like.",1409702400,,894,4.9072847682119205

3773646,5,B001R60ER0,"If you enjoy natural history and nature you will enjoy this first season of 'How the Earth was Made' from the History Channel. I was reluctant at first to purchase the set of 4 discs, thinking that the presentation would be truncated and chopped up for me to enjoy but I was pleasantly surprised. There are 4 discs with 3 or 4 programs to each disc. The programs are: (1) Iceland; Hawaii; The Alps (2) San Andreas Fault; The Deepest Place on Earth; Krakatoa; Loch Ness (3) New York; The Dirtiest Place on Earth; Great Lakes
(4) Yellowstone; Tsunami; Asteroids. Each disc is about 1 1/2 hours. All the programs basically start with general questions: How did this formation start? Why did this geological event occur? and then goes from there. Most of the discussions/presentations are done by researchers involved with or working for the United States Geographical Service (USGS).
My favorites are the ones that deal with the origins of formations such as Hawaii, the Alps, and the Marianas Trench. (the focus of the segment on 'The Deepest Place on Earth'). The presentation on Yellowstone and its formation is also really wonderful. I 'd say the best are the episodes that deal with the formation of Hawaii and Iceland. The set is not expensive, and comes with the added bonus of not having to watch the commercials.  The photography and the overall quality of the filming is excellent. You'll watch them many times. If you are a geography/natural history fan, there are some great sites for geography with some excellent interactive graphics on the Web to supplement your viewing.  One last comment- some have been disappointed with the History Channel in the past for the way in which the have covered topics, or maybe not covered, is a better way to put it. You will not have this problem with this set. It is geared for an introductory audience but is very well-produced, and covers most of the topic
reasonably well for the time frame given. As in most history presentations, there is always more, but these are great starts.",1401840000,6,2032,4.786324786324786

3773684,4,B001R60ER0,"The plus of this series of 13 programs on 4 DVDs is that it allows scientitis to illustrate geological analyses, principles and theories in classical geological settings or in their laboratory, and integrates various appoaches in trying to resolve questions.  The down side for me is that it is often too repetitive in reviewing what as presented, although this may help some remember. Also, it's sometimes too elementary and simplistic, occasioanlly  presents controversial theories as generally accepted facts, and occasionally presents wrong or outdated facts or theories. Let's take a look at the specific topics, with my comments, as a nonprofessional geology enthusiast.
DVD#1
  Begins with a discussion of the nature of the volcanic region of Yellowstone Park. I felt the introduction was too long and touristy;homever, eventually the nitty gritty was presented. Rock layers in the surrounding region representing ancient lava flows are shown, and evidence of volcanic ash originating from this region from CA to far to the east is discussed. Evidence of a former supervolcano that blew itsef up is presented, as well as a huge magma chamber relatively near the surface. The westward movement of the NA plate is thought to have caused the apparent eastward movement of a stationary mantle hotspot over southern Idaho to its present location, producing a series of volcanoes. The timing of several volcanic eruptions suggests we are due for another anytime within the next 100,000 years, with some ominous recent signs. Evidence is also presented of gigantic geyser explosions within the last few thousand years that dwarf present geysers... Next is an excellent presentation to tsunamis, concentrating on historical records of frequent occurences in Japan, coral historical evidence of past tsunamis in SE Asia, the Chilean earthquake of 1960, geological evidence of past tsunamis in coastal WA state, and the rather recent SE Asian tsunami of @004.  A common cause of earthquake-induced tsunamis is explained. The potential disaster of landslides into bays and oceans, inducing megatsunamis is discussed, with a documented Alaskan example and a likely future one in the Canary Islands greatly impacting the NA east coast.(also, see program on Hawaii for additional past and future examples). Strange that the 1960s Alaskan earthquake and tsunami wasn't mentioned. Also, I don't believe it was mentioned that underwater landslides, such as the huge pre-historic Storegga continental shelf collapse off Norway, can also induce tsunamis, as can huge oceanic volcanic eruptions(see progran on Krakatoa.)... Finally, a program  on the nature and significance of asteroids, and their strikes on earth. First, evidence linking Meteor Crater AZ to a meteorite strike is detailed. I believe too much time was spent on this at the expense of a much better presentation of the types of meteorites and their relation to asteroids. Evidence linking the metal-rich deposits near Sudbury, CAN and South Africa to ancient gigantic meteor strikes is detailed, as is more controversial evidence of a huge meteor strike over glacial Canada at the end of the last Ice Age. The basic types of meteorites are briefly illustrated, but important details are deleted and they are not related to different parts of asteroids. Thus, stone meteorites may or may not contain chondrites (little granules), which may(rarely) or may not contain much carbon and other organic molecules. Stone meteorites are thought to represent the outer crust of destroyed asteroids or planets, and those lacking chondrites are thought to represent crust altered by volcanic activity.  Iron-nickel meteorites are thought to be pieces of the outer core of former asteroids, while the rare stony-iron meteorites are though to represent the core-mantle transition of asteroids. All this should have been clearly explained.
DVD#2
  Starts with the question of why the large volcanic island of Iceland fromed were and when it did. Presents evidence that the mid-Atlantic ridge runs though the center of iceland, often seen as a large fissure. In addition, a giant hotspot in the mantle may sit below this volcanic ridge. Thus, these two forces have  combined to create the exceptional volcanic activity here. Continental and valley glaciers have sculpted this volcanic landscape and partially suppressed volcanic activity. But, volcanic heat sometimes melts the ice and causes catastrophic floods. Past volcanic eruptions have sometimes had worldwide weather effects. Please be aware that a tectonic subducting crust alternative theory to the hotspot theory has been proposed... Next, the geological origin, contemporary geology and proposed fate of the Hawaiian Islands is presented.  This is the classic hotspot-generated island chain story in the middle of a tectonic plate that so baffled geologists for some decades. The type of lava produced here(basalt) is relatively non-explosive in contrast to most continental volcanoes and some Icelandic volcanoes. The significance of this basalt lava in shaping the volcanoes and accelerating their erosion is emphazized, as is the importance of lava tubes as conduits of hot lava to the sea. Clear evidence of a past-megalandslide into the ocean from one island and a potential huge slide from another island warn of mega-tsunami potential...  Finally, the origin and fate of the Alps is considered. Clear evidence of overthrusts, in which often a much older rock formation was thrust up over a younger formation, is illustrated.  The layers of rock that form the Matterhorn are illustrated, with African-derived rock on top, then sea-bed sedimentary rock, and finally native European rock near the base. Rapid erosion by water, ice and glaciers is illustrated. Glaciers can slow, as well as accelerate, erosion, depending on the particulars.  Erosion products have accumulated in neighboring basins, induced by the weight of the mountains downwarping adjacent crust.  One very interesting question was not addressed. Why did the the African plate mostly slide over the Eurasian plate in the central Mediterranean, but mostly slide under it in most other parts of the Mediterranean??
DVD#3
  Begins with a description of the discovery of lateral slippage along the long strike-slip San Andreas fault as the cause of many CA earthquakes. This fault marks a boundary of the Pacific and NA plates, where the Pacific plate is sliding northward relative to the NA plate. Interestingly, limited areas near this fault haven't experienced large earthquakes, but small creeping movements and quakes. Think this is because the rocks here contain serpentinite, a soft slippery rock, rather than the usual hard brittle rocks, such as granite. Note that a similar situation was found in the deep Marianas trench(see next program). Much of the program deals with earthquake damage and future damage control and risks... Next, the nature of the  deepest oceanic trench: the Marianas. Why is this trench so deep and why so few large earthquakes? An important program. Serpentinite is found in large amounts as pulverized rock which apparently acts as a  lubricant as the Pacific plate descends into the trench. Because this descending plate is so old and thus dense, and because it is descending unusually fast under much younger Philippine plate, it descends at an unusually steep angle, thus forming a deep trench. Not mentioned is the fact that this trench is far from large terrestrial sediment sources which fill up many other subduction trenches....Next, the large volcanic explosion of the tiny indonesian volcanic island of Krakatoa in 1883 is discussed. This series of explosions was so violent, that all 3 cones were obliterated, a huge pyroclastic flow raced across the ocean surface to Java and a deadly tsunami was created.  A new volcano is currently being built at the same site... Last is a program titled Lock Ness. This is actually more a simplified story of the geological history of northern Scotland. The contrasting theories of Darwin and Agassiz as to how this region got its shapes is presented, with Agassiz's continental glacier theory eventually winning out. Lock Ness is a young glacial lake filling part of the ancient inactive Great Glen Fault, which several times in history acted as a strike slip fault similar to the  San Andreas fault. Incidentally, the Old Red Sandstone that makes up one side of Loch Ness is no longer beleived to be part of a very similar formation that underlies much of the NY Catskills, as presented, although they formed under very similar conditions.
DVD#4
  Starts with a consideration of the geological history of NYC and surrounding regions. The highest Manhattan skyscrapers are built on the hardest bedrock regions of Manhattan, not on soft sediments. Evidence is presented that this schist was once 20 miles below the surface, presumably the result of the Taconic terrane collision event, 450MYA(not the later mountains formed by the collision of the African plate, as later implied). Unfortunately, this program fails to mention the several other important bedrock types that dominate portions of Manhattan and surrounding areas. It does, however, illustrate erratic boulders, carried there from afar by glaciers. A good discusion of evidence how the terminal moraine that blocked the Hudson for a time was likely swept away...Next is a rather thorough treatment of the history of the Atacama desert of coastal Chile:the driest region on earth. Clever methods of dating the origin of this desert and of the origin of its present exceptionally dry phase are presented. The probable interaction of the cold Humboldt Current, rise of the Andes, and location in the subtropical high pressure latitude in explaining this unique region is emphasized..Finally, the formation and probable fate of the Great Lakes is investigated. Evidence is presented that these lakes, along with Niagara Falls, are of very recent glacial origin, and that their volume will be much reduced when the Falls backcut to Lake Erie. The importance of a hard impermiable Dolomite layer under 3 of the lakes is emphasized, and the importance of former ancient rift valleys in explaining the location of two lakes is mentioned. Evidence is presented that crustal rebound  from former continental glaciers is still causing the lake surfaces to fall.",1337385600,18,10368,5.33108935128519
3773685,5,B001R60ER0,"You should refrain from posting reviews about things based on inaccurate descriptions. The History website (and indeed other retailers such as Amazon) have the aspect ratio listed incorrectly. This is actually 16:9 widescreen and a native high definition release.

It's stupid that the technical specs are still listed wrong on this website after all this time and it's even stupider that Amazon and History allow reviews to be posted from people who haven't even bought the item.

No wonder History's Blu-rays don't seem to be selling that great with this kind of pervasive incompetence.

Just keep in mind that this and the rest of the History Blu-rays incorrectly listed as being 1.33:1 are actually proper 16:9 and any reviewers complaining about the aspect ratio have not bought the item and are raging because they read the incorrect technical specs on the retailer's website stating that the Blu-ray is 1.33:1.

The DVDs might be cropped to 4:3, however. But if you're that concerned about aspect ratios in this day and age you should not be buying DVDs. Watching a DVD on a 16:9 HDTV is absolutely ridiculous.",1323734400,16,1117,4.989247311827957

3773690,4,B001R60ER0,"How the Earth Was Made is a review of geology for a general audience, with sufficient new and expert input to also be of interest to geologists.  The graphics are very well done, and add to both the enjoyment of the presentations and their educational value.  I found the music overly loud and dramatic, but had to keep the volume up to hear the commentary.  The ""talking heads"" are knowledgeable geologists, and they bring the latest scientific findings to the discussion.  In an effort to keep things lively, facts that have been known for over a hundred years are sometimes presented as hot-off-the-press revelations.  By choosing particularly dramatic events, the series creates an appealing story line while managing to slip in quite a bit of solid scientific information.",1295481600,4,777,5.0390625

3773693,1,B001R60ER0,"This series of videos suffers from an all-too-common problem, these days, which is an inane application of video tools. You've got competing audio tracks where the background sounds and music comes close to drowning out the voice of the narrator (at times words are lost to due to the problem). You have the absurd over-use of video tools to make snazzy, snappy video segments which are totally useless and distracting. I am reminded of a bunch of juveniles with new toys when I watch this series; before they grow up and learn to use good judgment. And the endless summarising and repetition of what they just showed you 10 mins. before.

The geology given in this series is on a Jr. High School level, plus a few factoids you may have missed if you've been asleep for the last 5 decades.

Overall, The History Channel is guilty of selling 90% sizzle and 10% steak, so to speak. I'd like to throw this video out the window so hard that it lands back at The History Channel's headquarters--perhaps impacting the sleeping executives most responsible for selling this inane drivel.

3773696,5,B001R60ER0,"With a number of dangers threatening our planet, more people are keen to know about it and its origins. Understanding its origins may help us to protect it for future generations. The Earth is a constantly changing, evolving planetary body.
How the Earth Was Made steps in to fill this knowledge vacuum and does its job admirably. The visuals - both actual and graphics - look nothing short of stunning and several scientists do provide valuable insights on each site featured in the programs. My only complaint is that there is some repetition involved, but this must have been dictated by the commercial breaks on television. Still, it can be annoying when you view it through a commercially purchased DVD. I am sure that this series will be even more stunning on blu-ray.
The History Channel must be congratulated on a marathon effort that takes viewers right around the world, although there is some bias towards North America. Nevertheless, those sites (such as Great Lakes, New York) are very interesting in their own right. The programs manage to hold your attention for the full 50 minutes or so and the narration is never boring. I have not seen this series on History in this part of the world and I eagerly look forward to the second series as well. This is recommended for all those who like nature/science documentaries and for those who would like to educate their children on geology.  The pricing is also just right, for nearly 12 hours of material. Granted, it is no Planet Earth, but the emphasis here is on the Earth itself, not necessarily life on it. The series wins hands down on this score. It is a documentary that demands your full attention and rightly so.

This is a great and worthy follow-up to Earth Story, but potential viewers s/b aware that it is made in the modern idiom of contemporary documentary making ie, with quick-fire editing, theatrical sound track and dramatic dialogue.

Some or more of the episodes suffer from a paucity of hard footage, so there is a fair amount of re-looping and repetition. Some of this 'stretching' could have been cured with a more measured voice-over and less fast-cutting ie dwelling longer on much of the superb footage.

The periodic 're-capping of pertinent facts' is a good feature to help refresh the time-line and processes of some of the extended and complex geological events.

Don't let this put you off. Overall, it is amazingly informative and worthy of many replays.

One hopes that more follow-up series are being considered (with a bigger budget?) and if not in this exact format, but perhaps how geological events and climatic changes have shaped the course of human history?",1503014400,,1033,4.982558139534884
