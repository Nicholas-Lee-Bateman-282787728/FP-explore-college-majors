8440391,2,B004T1RAUY,"I checked this movie out with anticipation, but was very disappointed. It could have been much better. For some reason, the movie did not include interviews with his TV and movie co-stars like Jon Cryer, Heather Locklear, et al . Instead, a psychiatrist and two obscure actors were interviewed at length. Charlie Sheen's story is fascinating (at least to me); hopefully someone will make a much better documentary on his life in the future.",1312156800,,440,4.95945945945946
