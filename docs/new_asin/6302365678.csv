456266,4,6302365678,"If you like Chuck Norris films, especially of the 70's and 80's you'll probably like this one. The DVD was unrated but I'd say it's about a PG-13. The DVD allows chapter access, English, French and Spanish subtitles and some bio info on the cast. No theatrical trailer was present. The film is generally well-preserved (no widescreen) but the colors fade in and out a little bit (probably the cinematography was a bit inconsistent).
The film is definitely *very* 1970's. That means lotsa keyboard instrumental jazz music scored with the action, 3-piece suits, undercranked camera shots to make cars look like they're speeding (giving unnatural jerky motion), and half-witted dialogue. And Anne Archer, while lovely in the film, wears some awful-looking sunglasses (egads!).
While there are several martial arts fight scenes (what else?) they are not nearly as sophisticated as those in 1973's Bruce Lee classic ""Enter the Dragon"" (this is a 1978 film).
Major John Booker (Chuck!) leads a top secret team into Vietnam in 1973 to rescue some American POW's (boy, you never see THAT in a Chuck Norris movie, eh?) ... ahem ... Well, they were set up and several men died. Booker takes the loss philosophically and takes up test-driving Porsches and teaching Political Science at the local college (whatta guy!). Ah, but then a lovely young lady lawyer shows up and starts reciting all the top secret details of the 1973 mission to Booker. Booker must figure out what she's all about. At the same time all of Booker's buddies who survived the disastrous operation start dropping like flies.
James Franciscus is the up-and-coming Secretary of State and boy does he cuss a lot (probably after seeing the script!), hence my PG-13 rating. And he's a very baaaaad man. Jim Backus (Gilligan's Island!) shows up as a protective doorman. And the ubiquitious Soon-Tek Oh is here. Not a bad film, on a par with other Chuck flicks such as ""Hero and the Terror"", ""Invasion U.S.A."" and ""Code of Silence"".
Will Major Booker discover the truth and stop the bad guys? ... hmmm ... well, I'll let you buy the movie and find out ... (as if you couldn't guess) ... While you're waiting to find out, you can count all the green automobiles in the film ...
There must have been a lot of automobiles painted green in 1978 because there's a green car in nearly every street scene (all shades!). Even the toy car at one of the politician's home is green. Generally OK, and we can overlook some of Norris' acting since it's one of his first films. It is hard to forgive the paisley robes, Harvest Gold appliances, and the wide collars on the shirts, but hey, that was the 1970's.",1032825600,6,2649,4.773420479302832
456267,4,6302365678,"A simple film about the aftermath of the Vietnam War. A diplomat negociates the destruction of a special unit of the CIA, the Black Tigers, at the end of the war. So they are tricked on a fake mission. Yet five manage to escape and survive. But the diplomat is going to become the Secretary of State and the five survivors are the argument of some, in the wings, to blackmail the diplomat. So they have to disappear. But one of them and a CIA executive say no and put a stop to the killings and to the career of the diplomat. A perfect film about what politics are really about for some politicians : careerism and nothing else.

In the scene wear the plane blows up, one can see that right before the explosion, the plane is not even there.  Just a small example of poor editing.
I do, however, love this movie.  The few fights scenes in this pitcure are fun (airport and parking lot) and it is one of Norris' better acting performance.  The ""jumping into the car scene"" is actually Chuck's brother Arren.  The other acting performances are also very good (Ann Archer, Lloyd Hayes, and Dana Andrews to name a few).

456503,2,6302365678,"Good Guys Wear Black (Ted Post, 1978)

Secret Movie Confessions time: I have been a fan of bad Chuck Norris movies most of my life. I have lost count of the number of times I've seen the Missing in Action flicks over the years; I had both on a scratchy VHS I taped from HBO back in my high school days along with The Octagon, and I watched that tape incessantly. But somehow I'd never got round to seeing Good Guys Wear Black until now. I wish I hadn't.

I'd like to give you a plot synopsis. I really would. It has something to do with an elite squad of assassins during the Vietnam War who, years later, are being bumped off one by one thanks to some guy's political aspirations. (This is not a spoiler; the opening scene sets it up in such a way that there's only one real explanation.) But the plot gets bogged down a number of times and disappears entirely in others thanks to a script (by one guy who never worked in Hollywood again, as far as I can tell, and one who was working on his first screenplay; this was Mark Medoff, who obviously went to screenwriting school after this, since he was justly nominated for an Oscar less than a decade later for Children of a Lesser God) that makes as little sense as it possibly can and still remain marginally coherent. It's like a falling-down drunk quantum physicist trying to explain quarks to you when you never got beyond third-grade math, except in this scenario you're the genius. It's entirely the movie's fault that it makes no sense.

Still, the movie's worth watching entirely for one cameo. Jim Backus (yes, Thurston Howell III!) plays a doorman towards the end of the movie, and he's by far the best actor to be found here. Anne Archer pops up as Chuck Norris' love interest. Dana Andrews, at the twilight of his career (he would make just three more feature films) shows up as an old, nasty drunk politician; think of him as Charles Laughton in Advise and Consent, except that Laughton brought his A game to that film, while Andrews brings his D game here (though his final soliloquy is one of the movie's few high points). If you're not a big Chuck Norris fan, though, you can probably skip it and not be missing much. Actually, you can also do so if you are a big Chuck Norris fan. **",1293062400,,2250,4.37799043062201
456504,2,6302365678,"A Special Forces unit gets sent into North Vietnam to rescue some POW's.  The unit is setup but a few manage to escape the ambush and survive.  Five years later the remaining survivors are targeted for termination one by one.  Fortunately Chuck Norris (Major Booker) is warned by a pretty special investigator (Anne Archer) and the hunt is on for the mastermind behind everything.  The plot is okay but if you're expecting a lot of martial arts you may be disappointed.  Likewise, Chuck Norris provides his usual cardboard acting skills with some typical action scenes you would expect for this kind of film.",1241222400,,608,4.864077669902913
456505,3,6302365678,"My local Moviestop had this movie used for $3.99. The best part of the movie is the big Chuck Norris leaping kick through the car windshield. Without even having to sit through all 96-minutes, you can see the same kick reflected in Mr. Norris' sunglasses on the above picture. All events before and after led to that one kick. The actors were all hammy. The sex scenes were boring. The villian wasn't evil enough. Chuck does have a big political speech and the villian offers a counter argument but it all adds up to movie filler. And it isn't even entertaining filler at that.
The soundtrack seems to be heavily influenced by every 50's-60's low B-rate Sci Fi film. It so odd to see Chuck Norris looking for something to drink in his 70's apartment and hear flying saucers sound effects suddenly audible from out of nowhere.
To this film's credit, the movie starts off with a bang as Norris leds the Black Tigers, some secert military unit, to retrive POW's in Vietnam, but the rest of the story is without action or thrills. The movie comes to a halt after random scenes of destorying straw huts and Black Tiger members trying to save each other in the jungle.
The least believable part, is that its 5-years later, and now Chuck is teaching History and policital science at some university. Norris must be smart to get a PHD so quickly in that same 5-year time period.
It is fun to watch and make fun of. Everytime you see an Asian character, sinster music starts playing, and Chuck is called kick some butt. If you can turn off all logical thought, this can be fun at times.",1231632000,,1577,4.5174825174825175
456566,3,6302365678,"In this 1977 film, Chuck Norris is John T. Booker.  When this name is presented you almost think that Norris' character is going to have special powers.  Well I guess he does, right?  Pardon my deviation, in this movie Chuck Norris plays a C.I.A/military mercenary now political science professor/amateur race car driver.  However when a reporter, played by a young Anne Archer, comes to bring some skeletons out of John T. Booker's closet, the madness begins.

John T. Booker was part of a special unit called The Black Tigers.  Their last mission was to save some M.I.A. soldiers in Vietnam.  Consequently the mission didn't go as planned and many of The Black Tigers were killed.  Now Anne Archer's character is asking John T. Booker if he feels he and his team were set up when this mission transpired five years prior.

I am not going to rehash the entire plot; if you are a fan of Norris you have already seen this movie, planning on seeing this movie or will just see it because Chuck is in it.  I have seen many of Chuck Norris' films and this one isn't his best.  In contrast it isn't awful either.  As a matter of fact, this movie almost has a James Bond/24 feel to it (feel doesn't mean like or better).  This is manly due to all the political intrigue and mystery woven into the storyline. As for the action it is there, yet it isn't saturated throughout the movie.  This might created the perception of a boring or slow paced flick.  I felt it was a good balance.  I love the jump kick + moving car = this is why I have the DVD.

This move does have some bad special effects, poor acting and dubious events in plot. I found these deficits to prove charm (others might not).  The one thing this movie has got going for itself is the time capsule it has put on the 1970s, the fashion, gender roles, soundtrack, special effects and house wares.  Look at the tile and shower curtain in John T. Booker's bathroom and you'll know what I am talking about.

Overall a cult classic served with a bit of cheese. Again this isn't a great film, but does have some merit in the John T. Booker...I mean Chuck Norris catalog.  The DVD provides a nice picture, chapter selection and actor biographies.  As for the title of the movie, Chuck Norris/John T. Booker only wears black for ten minutes in this entire film, go figure.",1222041600,2,2323,4.454976303317536
456567,2,6302365678,"I was completely deceived with this movie. I thought it was going to be another Norris-cop film, being that Chuck's wearing official cop shades on the cover. Then I thought I was watching Missing In Action, because the plot seemed to be similar...at least in the beginning. It turned out to be just another Norris film with no real highlights in it.

My complaints are as follows:
- the opening credits were horrid!! It was some new technology that Hollywood was playing around with using psychedelic colors and blurred-digital graphics. The song was ear-bleeding and nauseating. I just skipped it.
- The acting was as expected for such a film. The fight scenes were just lame and could have been done better with Tiger Showman-style karate, not the great martial arts we expect from Norris.
- The scene where Norris goes head-on with a speeding car was just ridiculous, especially after it was over and Chuck's just hanging out of the windshield looking like, ""okay, now what?""
- There's no way they'd let anyone (even in the 70's) just bring a suitcase with a bomb on a plane. That part just ruined the movie for me and almost caused me to rip the disc from my player.

I do have to admit that the girl in the movie (Anne Archer) was smoking hot and there's no way she'd be in bed with Chia-Pet Chuck. I was hoping for a flash of flesh but was disappointed. The plot wasn't horrible, but could have been a bit better. Also the ending was great as I was wondering how Norris was going to clean up the mess that had been created.

Really not a bad movie, but I was expecting something more from Mr. Norris.

But Good Guys Wear Black is his first major effort, and while it's not the worst he's made, it's not the best. This tale of an ex- Special Ops commander whose Vietnam unit members are being killed off is okay in places, and laughably bad in others. The dialogue in some spots is bad enough to make you pause and rewind just to make sure you heard it correctly. The highlight of the movie is the great stunt where Norris jumps through a windshield to get at a would-be assassin, but that alone is not worth the effort to see this film.",1164067200,,769,4.340277777777778
456572,4,6302365678,"Sure, this is a Grade-B movie in almost every sense of the term, but it gives the ardent fan a good glimpse into the beginnings of Chuck Norris' eventually fruitful film and television career.

Admittedly, the plot is weak, the pace slow, the scripting thin and the action--at a dearth--borders on the comic, yet I find myself watching Good Guys Wear Black again. Why? Is it the one, monumental flying kick that Norris' character, John T. Booker, administers through the windshield of an oncoming car to his would-be assassin (a Vietnamese operative disguised with a blond wig and a Van Dyke!)? is it Norris' patently poor acting in the closing scenes, during which he tries to convey masculine anger through that slightly effeminate, nasality and sizzle in his voice? is it simply to see Lloyd Hanes smoking a cigar? or Jim Backus playing a doorman? or James Franciscus portraying a villainous candidate for U.S. Secretary of State? or the film's tired, 70's ideology? Who knows? This film's merit may very well stem from its lack thereof, which moves it into the more exclusive realm of ""classic"" Grade-B.

In time, Chuck Norris has carved out a well-earned and well-deserved niche for himself in martial arts entertainment. Movies like Good Guys Wear Black serve as a gauge to measure just how far he's come--which is a long way. So, if you truly want to trace this development in Norris' acting career, this film is a must-see along the way.",1115856000,12,1445,4.846153846153846

The moral of the tale is difficult to figure out at best, but you can feel the message even if you can't describe it. In my opinion, this film is (along with its runner-up, ""Night of The Juggler"") the Holy Grail of action B-movies.",1105747200,3,553,4.431372549019608

456575,3,6302365678,"This low-budget 'gem' from 1977 (I even remember there being a novelization, got to look for it) was a modest hit and pretty much made Chuck Norris a star.  Playing John T. Booker (the way the credit is listed mades me wonder if there would be more John T. Booker movies, alas not to be), Norris is a former CIA commando whose dark past comes back to haunt him when the politician that set him up in a raid turned death trap needs to erase that unpleasent part of history.  This is an old school action movie, back when they bothered to have plot and mystery prior to the fist fights and car chases, and it will probably bore many expecting wall to wall kung-fu action.  Nothing happens until nearly an hour into the movie, then the pay off begins.  Good Guys Wear Black was sold on the strength of one big stunt, Norris (or a double) leaping onto a car and kicking through the windshield to get at the assassin driving.  It was impressive then, today it is routine.  As I said, it is a low budget movie, one with Southern California locations filling in for Vietnam (sandy trails and eucalyptus trees in Vietnam???) as well as East Coast locations.  Pretty giggle inducing.  But the movie still works when watched in the context of its era (70s exploitation) and director Ted Post (Hang 'Em High, Magnum Force, Beneath the Planet of the Apes, etc.) keeps the movie professional looking, at least.  One shocking bit of trivia, one of the movie's screenwriters is Children of A Lesser God author Mark Medoff.  Wow.
