Searching to see if she has anymore videos out there. Great workout and I get the chance to shake,shake shake with dance on the side. Whew!",1444262400,,289,4.160714285714286
7833521,5,6302987954,"I have never been consistent with any exercise routines, but with this video working out had been so much fun! I used to do it on a regular day-to-day basis when it came out. Easy to follow the instructions and to memorialize the routine even for none-English speakers such as I was at that time. It is dynamic, but feels light and even those with a few extra pounds would not be left breathless. Great that the technologies of today have the capabilities to convert the old vhs to dvds so it can be played on a huge flat screen tv.",1299542400,2,532,4.2772277227722775
7833522,5,6302987954,I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed this video.  It has great music for a step routine.  It was peppy and fun to do.  I have a lot of step up videos and I enjoy doing this video the most.  Latoya is very good at this!,1168300800,2,219,3.6956521739130435
