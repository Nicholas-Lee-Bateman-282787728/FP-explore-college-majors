6605212,3,B00N1G1AMM,"Snakehead Swamp is exactly what you think its going to be! A fun,cheesy SyFy creature feature. With not so great creature effects but then again they're fun to watch.

There are some fun characters ,good acting especially Dave Davis and its always fun to see Antonio Fargas aka Huggie Bear! Of course there are the plethora of bad ideas like chilling on inner tubes in swamp water and other idiocies.

It's not a masterpiece by any means but bottom line its fun and if you're into cheese,get out the crackers and enjoy.  3 and a half stars.",1413244800,7,540,4.546391752577319
6605213,2,B00N1G1AMM,"This is another SyFy original with all the expected bad props and sad script. Of course some people like that.

The film opens with three subplots that quickly come together. There is William Boudreaux (Antonio Fargas) who believes everything relates to the curse on the swamp placed there by his gr-gr-grandmother who died in 1861. We also see some young adults head out for some swimming and drinking out at ill defined ""the point."" Ian (Ross Britz) provides us with an additional antagonist while Kerri (Sloane Coe) wears a bikini as an attempt at eye candy. Then there is the delivery van carrying genetically modified Snakehead fish from Asia which are larger, more aggressive than normal. And they can breathe and walk on land for a few days at a time.

The film incorporates generic internal relationships, ie cheating boyfriends, couples breaking up, couples getting together. These proved uninteresting as the characters were unable to entertain us with mediocre dialogue.

The film gives us a creature eye view through a modified fish-eye lens. The film has blood sprays and CG fish that is comically bad and I found myself laughing at one of the over spray killings.

Made for TV. No bad language, sex, or nudity. Minor sex talk like, ""I used her all up.""",1412812800,,1266,4.874418604651162

8675565,4,B00N1G1AMM,"RELEASED TO TV in 2014 and directed by Don E. FauntLeRoy, SnakeHead Swamp chronicles events at Blackbriar Park in the Louisiana bayous when a truck carrying modified snakeheads crashes, unleashing the killer fish, which is linked to a voodoo curse on the swamp. Dave Davis plays the male protagonist while Terri Garber & Anthony Marble play his soon-to-be divorced parents. Alpha male Ross Britz emerges as a semi-antagonist while Antonio Fargas plays the great great grandson of the voodoo woman who cursed the bayou almost 200 years earlier.

The plots hackneyed and the CGI snakeheads are more laughable than scary, but the movie otherwise works for what it is. Winsome & curvy Ayla Kell materializes as the heroine and shines in the role. Melissa Cordero & Sloane Coe are also effective as nubile maidens. You cant beat the authentic Louisiana bayou locations and I valued the warmth of the main protagonists as the story develops. The voodoo angle is also interesting. This is noticeably superior to similar Grade B flicks like Frankenfish (2004).

The film runs 86 minutes and was shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. WRITER: Greg Mitchell.

8675569,4,B00N1G1AMM,"This was a pretty good addition to the ever growing syfy movie library. The creatures were almost as big as alligators and looked great on screen. The story and pace of the movie were good as well. What really stood out to me were the great looking young actresses that played the roles in the movie. There was no nudity, but a whole lot of good eye candy. This movie is worthy of my collection for sure.",1453420800,3,404,4.259740259740259

8675571,2,B00N1G1AMM,"Mutant snakehead fish run amok in a small Louisiana town. Not a bad template from which to craft a fun b-movie, but SNAKEHEAD SWAMP is anything but fun. The potentially entertaining plot is spoiled by sorry effects that never make the monstrous fish remotely believable, much less frightening. The director might have tried showing less of the snakeheads to build up suspense instead of throwing the silly looking monsters at us full on, but one gets the impression there was little intention to make a truly thrilling movie on any level. The script makes fun of itself at every opportunity, so much so that it goes way beyond camp and seems to actually wallow in self loathing, as though everyone involved realizes they are in a terrible movie and want you to know that yes, they know it too. The monster action is lackluster and even the explanation for what caused the outbreak of killer fish remains muddled: was it because a truck crashed into the river with unnatural cargo inside, or due to a voodoo curse, or both? The question is never really answered, and I guess the viewer isn't supposed to think about it too much. The main characters, which range from a crazy old voodoo guy who lives in the swamp to a gang of young people on a boating trip and a female park ranger, are uniformly bad and underdeveloped even by the standards of b-films. In defense of the cast, however, I think the utter hopelessness of the characters has more to do with how they are written (or not) rather than due to the talent of the actors involved, most of whom do a pretty good job with the material as it is. The same cast might have done quite well with a better script to work from, and/or a director with a better handle on things. Sometimes for all their flaws b-movies are tremendously entertaining, but SNAKEHEAD SWAMP never manages to be anything but a very slow, painful experience in dramatic futility.",1438128000,,1903,4.616519174041298
8675572,2,B00N1G1AMM,have to be honest this was kind of a dud. but could be good for background noise if you are doing stuff around the house.,1430352000,,121,3.88
