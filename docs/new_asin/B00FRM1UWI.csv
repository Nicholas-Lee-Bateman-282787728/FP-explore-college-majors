8618332,4,B00FRM1UWI,"Released in 1962, Kid Galahad stars Elvis as an ex-GI who returns to his rustic home town in upstate New York looking for employment as a mechanic. He's roped into becoming a boxer by a dubious manager-turned-innkeeper (Gig Young) while catching the eye of his kid sister (Joan Blackman). With the mentorship of his trainer (Charles Bronson), he quickly becomes the top-drawing champion ""Kid Galahad."" Then the mob tries to muscle in on the action. Lola Albright plays the innkeepers significant other and assistant.

I prefer the more serious Elvis flicks (1964s Roustabout) to the silly farces (1966s Spinout) and Kid Galahad falls into the former bracket. While boxing is a big part of the plot, don't expect the urban-situated Rocky films or Southpaw (2015). What sets Kid Galahad apart is the setting  the awesome lodge in the mountains. In the story its supposed to be either the Catskills or Adirondack Mountains, but its obvious that it was shot out west. Regardless, the locations are exemplary. Beyond that, the story is dramatic and compelling.

The movie runs 95 minutes and was shot in Idyllwild, California, with studio work done in Culver City.
