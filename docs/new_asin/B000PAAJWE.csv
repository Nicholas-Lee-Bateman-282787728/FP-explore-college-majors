8190064,2,B000PAAJWE,"I bought this because I saw several previews on other dvds. However, it is not rated because it is a tv show and in my opinion it should be rated r. At times during the preformances it seems as though every other word only has 4 letters. If you like standup comedy, this is an ok purchase but, if you prefer clean family oriented fun this is definately not for you!",1391385600,,365,4.154929577464789
