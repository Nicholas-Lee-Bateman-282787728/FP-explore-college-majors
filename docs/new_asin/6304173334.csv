801877,5,6304173334,"GREAT PHOTOGRAPHY!!! GREAT MUSIC!!! GREAT ACTING!!! GREAT SHOW!!!  THE INVADERS starring Roy Thinnes is the best science fiction show I've ever seen!  The photography and music was better than on STAR TREK, and the writing was better than on VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.  The only weakness of the series was a lack of purpose, as Roy Thinnes as architect David Vincent spends virtually every episode fighting what seems to be a losing and hopeless battle against the Invaders from another world.  THE INVADERS probably would have been better if the series had been planned like its forerunner--also produced by Quinn Martin--THE FUGITIVE, with a beginning and an end.
  But this first episode is dynamite!  How can you top a show where an architect sees a flying saucer and meets the occupants--who look just like humans!--in the first five minutes, and spends the rest of the hour trying to convince everyone--incluidng his best friend and business partner--that he's telling the truth?  The producers used special techniques for the color, incredible music written by Dominic Frontiere--who also wrote the music for THE OUTER LIMITS--and solid actors you've seen for years in Hollywood, to make the best science fiction show I've ever seen.
  THE INVADERS!!! WOW!!! ""THEY'RE HERE!!!""

801878,1,6304173334,"The nightmare begins when you get the boxed set of this classic series and see how poor the quality is. This is the worst video quality I have ever seen! To make it worse, the distributor has put their logo at the bottom of  the screen for the entire length of every episode. We buy the videos to get  away from that logo garbage only to have it appear on the video itself. This  series deserves an official high quality release.  This ain't it folks!  Do yourselves a favor and don't waste your money.",948240000,13,502,4.297872340425532
801879,3,6304173334,Why has amazon.com not posted my review of this product in which I pointed out that the video quality of this set is extremely poor?  Is that not something that potential buyers should be aware of?,947721600,4,197,4.472222222222222
801880,3,6304173334,"The Invaders was one of my favorite shows in the Sixties, and I jumped to buy these tapes since, unlike a lot of other Sixties shows, The Invaders has never been rebroadcast or available on tape until now. I'm glad to have  the tapes, and to see these shows again after thirty years. Despite - or  maybe because of - production values that seem primitive today, The  Invaders at its best generates a sense of dread and paranoia that The  X-Files can only aspire to.
I would have given these tapes five stars  based on the program itself, but unfortunately I was disappointed that the  video quality of these tapes is EXTREMELY poor. They look like third or  fourth generation dubs made on a home VCR. The picture is blurry, the  colors are saturated and run together, and the sound is so muddy that it is  difficult to understand some of the dialog even with the volume turned up.  I don't know if the source material was of poor quality, and this is the  best that could be done with it, or if the producer of these tapes  (MM&V) cut corners on producing the home video version. (This is in  dramatic contrast, by the way, to the recently released 1965-1967 episodes  of The Avengers from A&E, also available from amazon.com, which have  been digitally remastered from the original film, and are absolutely  beautiful quality.) MM&V has also pasted their logo into the lower  right corner of the screen, throughout the entirety of every tape, which is  I find to be obtrusive and obnoxious.
So, if you have always remembered  The Invaders from your childhood as being really creepy and scary and  wanted to see it again after thirty years, do buy these tapes. The Invaders  IS every bit as creepy and scary as you remember. But be advised that the  video quality of this release unfortunately is very bad.",944784000,15,1806,4.5956112852664575

You can re-live the pilot episode here.",1417651200,,119,3.9583333333333335
7863891,5,6304173334,"I was 10 years old when the series started on TV and it was a long time before I would get out of bed with the lights out. This series was scary, scary, scary to me and my sister. I wish they would bring back the whole series on dvd.",1188691200,,233,3.68
7863892,5,6304173334,"I fondly remember our pre-X-Files alien paranoia TV series. David Vincent, an architect who stumbles upon a hidden alien invasion agenda, faces more disbelief than Fox Mulder when he desperately tries to expose the alien presence on Earth. A probable inspiration for Chris Carter... I, for one, would gladly watch the entire 43 episodes all over again. Certainly a nice DVD set like that would fit very nicely between 'The Outer Limits' and the 'X-Files' series...",1119744000,13,464,5.118421052631579
7863893,5,6304173334,"I was only 9 years old when ""The Invaders"" first aired in 1967.

I had already seen the Outer Limits, and Twilight Zone with the relish only a boy of that day could have.

But it was the day of syndicated Westerns such as Bonanza, and being time slotted across from such hits as that, The Invaders was doomed from the git-go.

After extensive searching, I finally found a copy of the original pilot Episode of the Invaders known as ""The Beach-Head"".

I ordered it through Amazon Marketplace vendor ""Popcorn Videos"".

While there is no DVD version available of this classic; The VHS copy I recieved did not disappoint. As promised; I recieved a NEW copy, factory wrapped with original sleeve and artwork. It was shipped in a timely fashion via USPS. And played wonderfully.

I and my friends time-warped for 49 minutes as we viewed it together...an experience well worth the cost of the video.

Kudos to Popcorn Videos, and Amazon for this rare treat!",1100390400,7,950,4.686746987951807

The whole series is available on vhs in sp under another label and I'm working on finding them and bringing them to Amazon.

 Thanks folks, enjoy.

7863895,1,6304173334,"""The Invaders"" was one of my all time favorite TV shows while growing up in the 60's.  Unfortunately this set of tapes is dreadful.  Don't waste your money on muddy video and distorted audio.  Paramount Pictures owns the rights to this series so wait until they release it on DVD themselves.  Better yet, email them and request that it be released on DVD - the squeaky wheel gets the grease.",1076803200,6,391,4.542857142857143
7863896,4,6304173334,Well.. funny .. but I have read the reviews below and I always thought this set was a great improvement over the original tape releases.. and my eyes are not the greatest either.  I do agree it is a shame you can't get this show in better quality.. but .. since two different and only releases of the first 7 episodes are both not great.. I have to assume they are working from poor original material.. we also have to take into consideration that we are rather spoiled since the release of DVDs.. this show is over 30 years old!  Since this series has not been re-release or seen anywhere else in better format.. is is entirely possible that you can't get it in a better clearer format!.. As an avid fan.. these tapes are a great buy.. and something is better than nothing.. I just wish I could get more episodes!,1074816000,4,814,4.348684210526316
7863897,5,6304173334,The quality was great. The shipping service could have been better. Originally tape was never shipped. The entry on the market place indicated that it was a pilot not on the 7 tape box set. Unfortuately it was.,1022371200,2,210,4.552631578947368
