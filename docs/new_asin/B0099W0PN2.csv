8538188,5,B0099W0PN2,"I took a couple of photography courses in college, but it has been a while.  This dvd is an excellent refresher course and I have quickly made better use of my D3200.  It is nice to know what all the buttons do and how to make adjustments!  I would also recommend it to novice photographers!  It is also nice to know more about digital photography (without too much techno babble)!  Thanks Michael, I liked this one so much, I have just purchased the Photoshop DVD and look forward to learning more about that software!",1469404800,,519,4.4787234042553195
8538189,5,B0099W0PN2,"This will help me teach my daughter to use the manual setting on her camera. Michael does a great job of demonstrating and explaining how to take great photos and opening the door for creative photography. My daughter has a great eye for composition, now this will teach her to be able to photograph what she sees in through her eyes and in her mind!",1450051200,,350,4.4

Michael is a wonderful teacher!!!! He explains everything so thoroughly. I watched the DVD on a portable DVD player. I would watch, pause and take notes. I have over 35 pages of notes. Purchase this DVD!!!!! If you purchased a DSLR camera and you only want to stay with the automatic modes this video is NOT FOR YOU. If you truly want to learn about digital photography beyound the automatic modes -- BUY THE DVD. I am very happy with this purchase because my photography has already gotten better.",1419292800,,893,4.622641509433962
8538193,5,B0099W0PN2,"After some research I decided to purchase the Nikon D3200. It's small size and loads of features seemed like a nice transition from my point and shoot. I wanted to get those pro looking shots of family events and my niece's cheerleading. My point and shoot just wasn't fast enough and I was missing all the good shots. I also have been interested in photography for years and really wanted to see what kind of images I could get from a better camera. However, when I got the camera I realized how overwhelming it was. I felt like spending so much money on a camera without learning what it could do, and leaving it in fully automatic mode (which is what I have been doing), would just be kind of pointless.

If you're interested in photography, you're probably visual like me, and fumbling around with a manual wasn't getting me very far at all. After a recommendation from a friend, I ordered this DVD along with his Photoshop training DVD. The DVD's were delivered yesterday. I spent all day watching these videos. After just one viewing I honestly feel like I know how to use my camera. The layout of the menus are super easy to navigate and it's been really easy to go back to certain things when I want to. This DVD not only includes an EXTREMELY comprehensive overview of the camera itself (all of the buttons what they do), it also includes what he calls ""Michael's Photography School"" where you learn all the basics of photography like exposure, Depth of Field, aperture, etc. I had limited to no understanding of these things before. It also has an entire chapter dedicated to composition. For a beginner like me, this was just so very helpful. I went from feeling very overwhelmed to feeling like I understand not only my camera, but I have ideas on how to be creative with my pictures.

Another reason I picked this camera is it's video capabilities. I don't plan on using this feature as often, but it's nice to have. This DVD has an entire chapter dedicated to learning that as well. Tonight is my nephew's birthday and I feel confident that not only will I get some great pictures, I will also be able to get great videos too. He goes over cool little ideas on exercises for getting better. There's no information on editing, but I really wasn't expecting that anyway.

Overall I would recommend this to anyone who purchased the D3200 and wants to REALLY know how to use it -- and fast. The instructor Michael speaks clearly and in a way that's easy to understand. You really get the idea that he knows everything about cameras and gear. He makes great recommendations for products to make the most of your images and videos. For under $40 I feel like this was one of the best purchases I've ever made.",1378425600,8,2716,4.538775510204082
