8262627,4,B0016IKF6Y,"I recommend this DVD for knowing more about the Sephardic Jewish history which for me is coming from my ancestral background was amazing.

This spectacular journey through Spain is guided by Yitzhak Navon, fifth president of the State of Israel, and former Minister of Education. Navon takes you deepinto the heart of Spain - to places such as Toledo, and Cordova - to visit historical sites and recent discoveries that tell the story of the Jews in Spain, Portugal and Majorca.",1396828800,3,478,4.901234567901234
8262628,5,B0016IKF6Y,"Former Israeli president Yitzhak Navon travels through Spain with the filmmaker, and together they present the history of the expulsion Jews of Spain in 1492 in a unique and surprising format that includes historical details as well as touristic strolls through former Jewish quarters and interviews with current residents.

Some of the most startling details include the story of ""The Holy Child of La Guardia"", a famous mediaval blood-libel that was invented by Torquemada as an excuse to kill and expel the Jews of Toledo and La Guardia. Navon and his crew walk around and interview people on the street, who all still believe that the story is true, even though there has not been a Jew living in their town for more than 500 years.

Highly recommended.",1345852800,7,757,4.90625
