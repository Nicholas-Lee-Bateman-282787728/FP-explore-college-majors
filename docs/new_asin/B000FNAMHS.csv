8124811,5,B000FNAMHS,Christian values at their best. These programs were a part of my childhood and I am happy they are still available to share with my children.,1410307200,,141,4.461538461538462
8124812,5,B000FNAMHS,"This is safe viewing for even the youngest toddlers and preschoolers, and is an exceptionally well-written children's collection, packed with timeless moral themes. There are many wonderful ""takeaways"" to be gleaned from the adventures of Davey and his big, goofy dog, Goliath -- humor, love, learning, music, friendship, simple examples of God's hand in our everyday life, honor, philanthropy, integrity, stewardship, servitude, and even some real-life lessons in the School of Hard Knocks.

I am no expert, but I believe this is what was commonly referred to as Claymation. Despite having originated in the 1960s, these renderings are of decent quality and have been very well received by my children. We have the set of four DVDs and enjoy watching them over and over again. In total among the four DVDs, there are (22) 15-minute episodes, and (4) 30-minute specials.

Highly recommended; watch them together and be blessed!",1295308800,2,927,5.256756756756757
8124813,5,B000FNAMHS,"How refreshing it is to find some good Christian themed cartoons available. I remember enjoying these when I was a child, and now it is a pleasure to watch my daughters enjoy these same episodes. If you're unfamiliar with this series, they are done in claymation (animation with clay) like Gumby. I like them better than Jay Jay the Jetplane and Veggie Tales (although Veggie Tales has an awesome Christmas CD).",1180051200,4,411,4.802816901408451
8124814,5,B000FNAMHS,"I'm sorry- I'm not a techie like the first reviewer... and while I remember these shows as a child, I did not buy them simply to walk down memory lane.  I bought them for my own children, whom I hope will appreciate the slower pace and family-friendly themes, as well as the emphasis on God and Christian morals.  Has anyone noticed that what's offered as steady children's fare on Cartoon Network, The Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, the WB, Fox Kids, and the like is absolute crap?  Parents are either nonexistent, complete idiots, or live to make sure the world revolves around their precious progeny.  The music is loud and the action is violent (who can forget the Power Puff Girls?), obnoxious, and in your face.  No wonder kids turn out like they do.  What's a parent to do?  Well, for one, don't subscribe to cable TV.  Then, only let your kids watch PBS Kids (Arthur, Clifford the Big Red Dog, Curious George- need I say more?).  THEN- think back to your own childhood and say ""I wonder if such and such is on DVD yet??""  That's how I came across Davey, and I am THRILLED with it!  What a find!  My 4 and 7 year old kids are addicted to it!  I recommend this without reservation to ALL parents of young children.  They may think it's boring at first, but they will come around.  The stop-motion animation is charming and makes you want to watch for the sheer novelty of it.  FIVE STARS!  And to those giving it one star, I think they may be missing the point.",1168041600,13,1465,4.426966292134831
