8476036,2,B005JU62DU,"Not at all what I expected.  I wish I could get my 30 dollars back.  Absolute rip off.  They are cashing out with the isde name.  They camera guy just stands at the beginning of the race and covers a small flatground section where the riders have to navigate a course taped out for them.  No obstacles, just flat turns.  Terrible footage.  You don't get to see any of the race, just the starting section.  Oh yea they cranked up the playback so everything looks like it is in fast-forward.  There are some interviews.  Explanation of race rules are ok.  I feel cheated.  I expected to see some race coverage. I have to give them two starts because of what they did record, they did a good job with.  But I am still infuriated I payed 30 dollars to watch the same 50 foot section of the race the entire time.",1322524800,,807,4.264900662251655
