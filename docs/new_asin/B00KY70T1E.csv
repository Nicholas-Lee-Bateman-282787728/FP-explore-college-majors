8662566,5,B00KY70T1E,"This is a fascinating documentary on the rebuilding of the WTC site. The buildings, the museums and,  most uniquely, the symbolism and reasoning behind how they rebuilt that area. I was one of the frustrated many who could not understand why it was taking so long to rebuild,  but this explains how much thought and design went into it.  If you ever plan to visit the 9/11 memorial in NYC, you must watch this documentary. It will help you understand and appreciate what was done.",1506384000,,480,4.623529411764705
