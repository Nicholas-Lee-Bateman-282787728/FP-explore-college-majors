7925956,5,B00004XMV2,"Good Civil War dramas are rarer and rarer these days, and this movie is very welcome. Miles O'Keeffe has one of his best roles since TARZAN and it's great to see Michelle Bauer in a classier role than usual.",1215129600,,207,4.333333333333333
7925957,5,B00004XMV2,"Ok .. It is not ""Gone With The Wind"" or ""Gods and Generals"" What it is a ""5 Star Amateur Effort"" on a Civil War Story with no 6 or 7 figure actors. It utilizes Civil War reenactment footage and some good photography..",1108598400,,217,4.069767441860465
7925958,1,B00004XMV2,"BLOOD AND HONOR is one bad movie.

1.  The same battle scenes are shown twice, with the same results.  The blood looks like ketchup more than any film I've ever seen.

2.  Miles O'Keefe receives star billing and is hardly in the movie at all.

3.  The acting by all (except a mildly effective Andy Hamrick in the role of Craig) is atrocious.  The girl who plays Caroline is so bad, she's hilarious.

4.  The direction is inane and amateurish; the narration is ridiculous.

5.  This plays like a bad, real bad Barbara Caitland novel.

6.  The movie ends out of nowhere and we never know what happens to Miles O'Keefe's character.

7. During the out credits, they show actors in scenes that weren't even in the movie.  Like who is the black couple and where did they even come from?

8.  A film produced by David Heavener, one of b movie's most inauspicious actors/directors/singers.

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME UNLESS YOU REALLY LIKE BAD BAD MOVIES.",1097020800,6,943,4.572289156626506
7925959,1,B00004XMV2,"This is so low budget that it is embarrassing.  The acting is poor,about the level of a bad High School play.  The Civil War
battle reenacting scenes are poorly done. Finally, The storyline is bad. Most of the movie story makes no sense.  I paid [$] for this DVD and it wasn't worth that.",1037577600,8,288,4.296296296296297
7925960,5,B00004XMV2,"Fans of Civil War-era dramas will definitely want to put ""BLOOD AND  HONOR"" at the top of their rental lists! This one has it all - action,  romance, and real thrills as beautiful Southern belles are terrorized by a  psychotic Yankee soldier! The main story follows the classic romance  between a beautiful Boston girl who settles in Georgia before the war and a  wealthy Southern plantation owner. But in the classic romantic tradition of  films like ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" fate conspired to keep this  couple apart until the final moments. Until then they both suffer through  the horror of war and the loss of those most dear to them. Women will  appreciate the romance in this film, but guys will love the epic battle  scenes with hundreds of soliders, cannons, horses, and authentic period  weapons! Miles O'Keefe provides a powerful presence as a fair-minded  Northern Colonel and actress Maria Ortiz nearly steals the movie as a  scheming Cajun maid who nearly destroys the lives of everyone she meets.  ""Blood and Honor"" may be the best Civil War era film since  ""Mandingo,"" so rent it and see if you don't agree!",965260800,,1122,4.831578947368421
