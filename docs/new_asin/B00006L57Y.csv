Michael Manring was a true revelation and what can one say about Victor Wooten? Humble virtuosi, great combination! Love the way in which Victor shows us mere mortals how to practise to achieve his technique! Really Victor? Thanks anyway man:-)) Strongly recommended, if you like the bass you will LOVE this!",1454630400,,468,4.8625

7971335,5,B00006L57Y,"First of all, let me just say that I am not primarily a bass player.  My musical focus is the guitar, but I have recently been attracted to the bass and its musical possibilities.  I purchased this DVD for one reason: to have a video recording of Victor Wooten playing live.  Having seen him play live on several occasions, I knew that his set would be mind-blowing.  Thankfully, I was not disappointed with this DVD.  Victor's performance is top-notch as he works through some of his more famous tunes and renditions: ""You Can't Hold No Groove,"" and his extremely impressive version of ""Norwegian Wood.""  On top of these great performances, Victor provides an in-depth look at his ""double thumping"" technique, though the lesson is delivered at such a speed it will simply just boggle your mind (thank goodness for rewind).

But what really impressed me about BASS DAY '98 was how much I enjoyed the other performances.  Michael Manring kicks off the DVD with a very interesting solo set, proving that the bass can stand on its own as a solo instrument.  Andy Gonzalez leads a very fine group of Latin musicians through an Afro-Cuban set. Francis Rocco Prestia, the bloodline of groove for Tower of Power, delivers an awesome ""funkified"" performance with other TOP members, including ""Oakland Stroke,"" ""Squib Cakes,"" and ""What is Hip?"".  After Victor rocks the stage, all of these impressive bassists take the stage (along with John Patitucci) and jam for a full thirteen minutes.  It's something that has to be seen to be believed.

In conclusion, I think that this DVD offers something for everyone, even if you do not play bass.  If you appreciate great music or love any one of these particular musicians, you will love this DVD.  Many of these performances push the envelope and are guaranteed to entertain.",1113782400,11,1812,4.859934853420196
7971336,5,B00006L57Y,"Michael Manring, Victor Wooten, John Patitucci, Rocco Prestia and others...together...WOW!!!

This DVD is well worth the $ for the performances.  The interviews are interesting and Victor even gives a quick ""Double Thumping"" lesson.

If you play bass and like the above players...buy this DVD.",1099353600,7,293,5.613636363636363
7971337,5,B00006L57Y,"This is really an amazing live performance. One of the best I've ever seen on DVD. Approx. 100 minutes from the finest stuff.
MICHAEL MANRING plays a set of solo pieces on four different basses!
ANDY GONZALEZ leads an all-star latin band in a scorching set of Afro-Cuban music, joined by latin bass legend BOBBY RODRIGEZ.
FRANCIS ROCCO PRESTIA, with members of Tower Of Power, performs a set of funk classics and talks about creating a groove.
VICTOR WOOTEN performs a trio set and offers a lesson on bass technique.
In addition, JOHN PATITUCCI is the host of the show and fortunately he's not only speaking.
That's more than enough! These guys can guarantee the value of this dvd!",1074902400,12,681,4.73109243697479
