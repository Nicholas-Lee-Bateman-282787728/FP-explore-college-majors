When I think of China, I normally think of a militaristic, oppressive atmosphere that does not foster artistic creativity since artists tend to be resistant to authority and restrictive influence.  (My spouse is an artist so I have experienced this firsthand. . .)

It was archeologically fascinating to see the conversion of the old, drab abandoned industrial plant into a fresh haven for artists.  And the interviews with the individual artists and sculptors were quite entertaining.  There were some politely pointed questions posed - especially about the artists' perception of how free they were to express ideas that might be unpopular with those in authority. You can judge for yourself from their responses.

What a creative opportunity to recycle the morbid, wasted facility into an attractive arena for new ideas.  Maybe other communities can emulate that spirit.

I also appreciated the author/creator including some candid footage of himself interacting with the (non-artist) people and other details of today's China like the sad urban-renewal destruction of the old housing units.

Entertaining and informative - five stars!",1254009600,,1254,5.489583333333333
