4853116,5,B005OK722K,"I have never seen Yo Gabba Gabba live in concert before, so when I received this DVD I knew I was in for a treat. I had seen their television show before and my kids have enjoyed them since they were young. They blend of music and excitement is contagious and the kids thrive on it. This DVD is great and incorporates wonderful music and engages kids in the concert itself. So even if you are not able to attend a live concert you can have a live concert right in your own family room. One word of caution though, the songs are very contagious and by watching us don't be surprised if your kids start singing the songs day in and day out, and before you know it, you will be too. This is a great DVD for the entire family.",1335225600,,722,4.091549295774648
4853117,5,B005OK722K,My 2 year old daughter absolutely loves this dvd. She wants to watch it everyday. The songs are very catchy and make her sing and dance the whole time. Great buy!,1334361600,,162,4.258064516129032
4853118,5,B005OK722K,"Like the other reviewer has said the camera work and editing is mediocre.  But I bought it for the kids, they loved it and said to give it 5 stars.",1332201600,,147,3.9
4853119,2,B005OK722K,"I should probably preface this review by saying that I took my daughter to see this show when they came to Detroit. Since she seemed to really love the show (not that I'm complaining about it), I thought this would be cool for her to have.

The show itself is great, and it was mildly interesting to see how the show had evolved by the time it made its way here (near the end of the tour). For example, there was far less ""Hey Detroit!"" in the show we saw live, while this video has loads of ""Hey Los Angeles!"".

Loads of Los Angeles.

Guess where everyone is? In Los Angeles, is where.

I think it's a touch confusing for kids who aren't in Los Angeles, but you think that's my Midwestern inferiority complex shining though. Okay, fair enough. Here's my real contention: at least a third of the show is cutaways to the audience. And the cutaways aren't the slightest bit graceful or additive to what's happening in the show.

For instance, as DJ Lance introduces the other characters, rather than cutting to the characters he's calling out, we get clips of a three year old dancing, or the backs of the characters. It's like someone learning Final Cut has been asked to give three different reels of the same show equal time. It's a mess that makes the live show difficult to follow, which is rather unfortunate considering the live show is mostly rehashed from the Nick Jr. series.

""DJ Lance said Biz Markie, but that woman in the audience looks kinda like Gwen Stefani. Is it? Wait never mind, there's Biz...""

The three ""behind the scenes"" extras are more cohesive, but even those go from ""engaging to my 4 year-old"" to ""entertaining to me"" and back again in a 10 minute segment.

If I had it to do over again, I'd probably have crossed my fingers and hoped for Nick Jr. to run it, or for the disc to be in the Redbox as a one-time rental.",1331683200,4,1844,4.402941176470589

4853121,5,B005OK722K,This is the only thing our baby has enjoyed watching. He doesn't show any interest in television but when he'd be screaming in the car we'd find that putting this live version of Yo Gabba Gabba on could usually buy us a half hour! My 3.5 year old still enjoys watching it as well. It's engaging and has many songs and times to interact. Yo Gabba Gabba is my favorite show for little ones and live is even more enjoyable!,1485820800,,420,4.2625

4853127,1,B005OK722K,"Yo Gabba Gabba is one of my least favorite shows! I would give this zero stars if I could. I used to enjoy watching shows on Nick Jr when I was younger, but now that I am older (I am currently 17 years old), I do not enjoy it. Yo Gabba Gabba I would say is one of the worst of the ones I know of. It is very silly, and the man on Yo Gabba Gabba dresses pretty silly. I do not understand why so many people like such a crazy show. Overall, I will not be watching Yo Gabba Gabba again.

My favorite tv show is Little House on the Prairie, especially some romantic episodes from Season 6 (Back to School, Sweet Sixteen, He Loves Me He Loves Me Not) and The Reincarnation of Nellie (from Season 8). Those are shows I would recommend and say are worth watching! I could watch them all day.",1479859200,,784,3.9936305732484074

4853147,4,B005OK722K,"We have been to the YGG Holiday Live Production. We have the toys and we have seen all of the episodes of the show. This DVD is a staple for our household. Yo Gabba Gabba Live for $1.99? No reason not to stock up for the holidays/birthdays. Appearances by The Aquabats, Jack Black, Dave Grohl, Gwen Stefani, Taboo from Black Eyed Peas and of course a beat box sesh with Biz Markie. Ok, so maybe that's misleading. Some of them are only on the specials features part of the DVD and then others are just visible in the audience, but even that lends some credibility. Children, parents, celebs and non-celebs alike choose Yo Gabba Gabba Live. The one disappointment is that the CD is not of the DVD at all. So if you're expecting to blast ""Pool Party"", save yourself the despair. Instead, just appreciate the show and buy this DVD/CD combo for $1.99 while you can. Even at $9.99 it'd  be a fair price.",1468713600,6,898,4.442424242424242

4853187,5,B005OK722K,"Our son LOVES YGG- he's (literally) watched the same YGG Clubhouse DVD every night before bed for the past two and a half years. We recently bought a Fire TV stick and he found YGG in the kids section. Only one of the seasons is included with Prime membership, and our son wanted us to buy him the other seasons. I didn't want to do that right away- he's got plenty of other options with the Fire TV, NetFlix, etc so when I ran across this during my search, I thought it was a good ""compromise"". Even at six, our son spent like the first fifteen minutes in front of the TV, bouncing up and down on our ottoman and he only got up to get a blanket to cuddle with- he watched the WHOLE thing (which is an hour long) and that's pretty rare for him. Usually, he'll watch parts while playing with toys or grazing on a snack or coloring but ""full attention"" is a rarity for any TV show, but I think this one will be one of his favorites.
The Aqua Bats perform, Biz also makes an appearance, DO IT and (the lady with big hair and glasses- can't remember her name) do the Dancey-Dance segment (the Peanut Butter Stomp, if you're curious!). I also liked that it covered being scared of the dark (because I think most children go through that phase) and being sad about saying goodbye (TooDee doesn't want to say goodbye) so it's very ""well balanced"" just like their TV shows; and even though it's a taped version of a live show, you don't get that weird ""third person"" feeling watching it and I think that has a lot to do with the fact that the ""main audience"" for this show is 3-5 years old, so it's more engaging to begin with. The rental is only a few dollars cheaper than just buying it and I would recommend buying it.",1422230400,4,1713,4.225609756097561

Also, because you get to see how the audience is, I feel more at ease if I were to bring her to a live show next time they tour without worrying what I'm to expect.

Such a great DVD if your kid is a fan. And the songs are so tolerable for me, I never get sick of hearing them all. I like that the creators kept parents in mind when putting this show together.

(once you put the dvd into your dvd player of course :) ) There was lots of music and dancing and interaction. plus there is an intermission, if you want to stop the movie and do something else and come back to it.

The addition of all the music on a cd with it was a great plus, we listen to it in the car all the time. Overall I am very impressed with this product and reccommend it to any parent of a child(ren) who love to sing and dance and learn!",1376870400,,617,4.057377049180328

He has a couple of DVD's and he loves every one of them.
Last year the Live Show came to our town and we were lucky enough to grab tickets before they sold out. The show was great, he had a blast and he still talks about it. So when I found the DVD, I was eager to check it out. It did not disappoint.

The DVD is the same show we saw live and is able to translate the same energry. There are all the best songs from the show, so it's fun and familiar. My son has watched it dozens of times, and sings and dances EVERY time. The best part is we've taken it with us while traveling, so he has this fun DVD anywhere we go.

If your kiddo loves Yo Gabba Gabba, they will love this DVD (and the CD is AWESOME too!).",1361232000,,812,3.798816568047337

4853267,2,B005OK722K,This video does not seem very professionaly done. Looks as if someone was sitting in the audience with a camera.  Grainey on HD TV.  Audience shots do not fit in very well. Did not hold the interest of a 2 yr old Gabba fan.,1347840000,,223,4.045454545454546
4853268,4,B005OK722K,"This show is interesting and colorful. The music is exciting.
What I don't like is it has no subtitles or words displayed on screen. So, it's hard for the kids, their parents and teachers to sing along. In some cases, the adults want to sing along to encourage their kids to sing and dance.

In this regard, I think one of the better DVDs is VeggieTales Sing Yourself Silly.",1347321600,5,374,4.420289855072464
