563106,1,6303106854,"Return to Havana?  This video barely even talks about Havana.  It's more about Cuban music and ""how it is responsible for ALL Latin music around the world.""  Not to mention full of SUBJECT statements blaming ALL of Cuba's ills on the USA including changes to Cuban music?... leaving no blame for Bautista.  More misleading statements of Cubas history to boot!  Uses video footage from the other videos in the set... and fabricated black and white (sepia) footage.",1037491200,,463,4.961038961038961

7838071,5,6303106854,"Mesmerizing supernatural thriller with a gorgeous soundtrack by academy award winner Dario Marianelli. This is a ghost story, not overt horror, more of a mystery to be solved and with a nice romantic subplot and romantic backstory that I love. Gellar looks great as a brunette. The child actor who plays Gellar's character as a child does a great job. I don't think this film will appeal to everybody, not if you want scary gore, again, this is mystery and love story (the ghost's backstory) with supernatural ghost appearances.",1409961600,4,528,4.943820224719101

7838076,5,6303106854,"This documentary is beautifully filmed.  The scenery alone is worth the video/DVD.  The filming of the wolves is close up and personal, you feel like you are there.

The documentary draws you into the story of the lives of these wolves.

I use this when teaching about the environment in my Life Science classes.  It keeps the attention of all the students.

Buy it.",1179360000,,366,4.640625
