8585017,4,B00CQCZBH2,"My 1st grader, 4th grader and 6th grader all enjoy this program.  (First grader, who is still mastering reading and writing, doesn't do the workbook yet - just watches the dvd.)  Each dvd lesson shows Carolyn in front of a classroom of similarly-aged children, middle schoolers and maybe high schoolers(?).  She presents the vocabulary and motions then brings it together in a skit.  The TPR (hand motions) method is very effective and makes the ""vocabulario"" stick.  It's fun to hear my kids mumbling to themselves in Spanish outside of school hours - imitating what they've seen, heard and acted out during the lesson.  It is essential to buy the dvd's, a workbook for each child (white), lesson book (blue) and answer book (red).  I have only 2 years of high school Spanish under my belt and find it helpful, but not necessary to teach this way to my children.

I would have given 5 stars, except as a busy homeschool mom, I would like to see a better outline for daily lesson plans.  Otherwise, very happy with the program.",1381276800,5,1027,4.692737430167598
8585018,4,B00CQCZBH2,"I enjoyed these videos, but maybe I was expecting too much based on the reviews for the workbooks for Excelerate Spanish which are all just glowing. But I realize two things probably contributed to my feeling just a bit less enthused than the other reviewers.  One, I had only gotten the videos -- I would recommend getting the workbook too and secondly, I think while a single person all by themselves can participate, it's just not as much fun.  For example the part where the two people are racing to the taxi -- much more fun to be doing that with a friend where you might make a face at them, then to just be doing it facing your computer screen.  I'm not that good at playing with my imaginary friends, ha ha..

But if this was being used by homeschoolers, then a single parent and child would mean more than one person was involved in the learning process and I think it would be more fun.  Parents and children could be at the same or different levels of Spanish knowledge.",1379548800,,981,4.397790055248619
