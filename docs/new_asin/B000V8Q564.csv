(No spoilers ahead.)

This extraordinarily low budget horror film features a truly unexpected ending. However, once the film is done, you realize that the ending actually contradicts the entire film's story. The result for the viewer is a very frustrating experience. I equate an ending like this to a slap in the face for the audience.

I discovered this movie via positive feedback from comments on the IMDB site. People were calling the movie truly frightening and well done. One person said that the film had many things going on, and that it requires multiple viewings. I couldn't disagree more. And I've given it multiple chances.

The bewildering ending aside, The Collingswood Story does not rely much at all on blood, gore, or guts for its macabre vibe. Nor does it feature big cheap jolts (well, maybe one 'jump' moment). Instead it focuses on slowly establishing mood and atmosphere. (Someone on IMDB compared the film to ""Halloween"" and ""The Blair WItch Project"" because of the bare budget and reliance on the audience's imagination.) Basically the entire film is just that, a very slow build to a spooky conclusion. I am a fan of atmospheric frights: Alien, The Haunting, The Others, The Shining, The Changeling... these are films that take their sweet time and wrap their icy fingers around your neck softly. This film seems to try to emulate that kind of horror to a degree.

Here's a brief rundown on the plot, sans ending:

The premise is simple. College student Rebecca moves to Collingswood, New Jersey while her ex, John, remains in Virginia. They keep in touch via webcams (a lot). John thinks it would be fun to visit an online psychic, Vera, whom his buddy has recommended. Vera reveals information about a secret underground cult in Collingswood and a member of this society who killed nine girls and put them in a well on his property. He also killed his daughters in the tub, apparently.

(It is not clear as to whether this psycho lived in the house where Rebecca is staying; at times in the movie it is stated that he lived there, and at other times it's mentioned that he lived in another house on another street. Things aren't especially clear in this plot. Information is doled out in an odd way throughout the film.)

 John becomes concerned, and he and Rebecca do some research which offers macabre possibilities. The psychic alludes to rituals practiced in the attic; she describes the way the girls were murdered. Eventually curiosity gets the best of Rebecca and she takes her laptop into the dreaded attic in the house where she's staying... as John watches helplessly on his computer.

[ End of synopsis ]

Suffice to say that the final scene is unexpected. Unfortunately, what happens simply ruins the entire story; like the ridiculous twist in the gory ""Haute Tension"", everything you had been watching for about ninety minutes no longer makes sense. It feels like you've been betrayed. I'm sure the filmmakers thought that the twist was very clever. Actually, it could have worked to the film's advantage, had the filmmakers made a few small changes in the story. But that's neither here nor there.

I was actually going to title this review ""Is that an ice cream truck I hear?"" because when we are introduced to the online psychic, there is a melody in the background which is probably supposed to sound like a music box, but it's much more evocative of Mister Softee. I giggled. You don't want giggling in your horror film if the moment is meant to be mysterious.

At times I felt so ripped off by this movie. If you're going to build up this tale of a psycho and the scary well on his property, why not actually show this well at some point? There's more betrayal, but I promised no spoilers. Obviously this movie made me angry.

As for the film's ambience and ""feel"", there is a soft, ominous background noise of eerie wind that runs throughout most of the movie. It was apparently added in postproduction and was meant to elicit a creepy feeling.
There are way too many 'fade to black' moments.

The attic sequence is very ""Blair Witch Project"" with its cinema verite technique. I had heard comparisons to that film but the influence is staggering.
A few other things in the movie made me think of other horror films: allusions to a deep scary well (The Ring), a child's toy and a bathtub (The Changeling).

The film feels slightly weighed down by its webcam gimmick, like we are tethered to the actors. Only when we are in Beck's car looking at the beautiful autumn foliage does the film feel unfettered and relaxed. But I suppose the webcam technique certainly helped to keep the budget minimal (hardly any location shooting or intricate camera work was required this way).

Maybe the movie would have been improved if there had been a good musical background score during the creepy sequences. There is a 'music composed by' credit, but it's not a melodic score, it's more atmospheric sound and noises.
 John Carpenter saved his 1978 movie ""Halloween"" by adding his electronic music (after its first screening with an audience that wasn't thrilled with it).

I honestly do think that many people will probably like this movie because it's not your typical, cookie-cutter scary film. It isn't bad for a creepy flick around the end of October, but for me it has too many flaws and plot holes.",1206576000,3,5353,4.75512405609493
