7907873,1,B00000F6GK,"This is the worst ballet video I've seen in my life and trust me I have more than 1,000 titles do this lady was so bad with the classics that is afraid that people can see them? I purchase It because of the cover thought  that will include some classic work from here that I have seen fragment and they are incredible. my mistake, but I will hate somebody else will be the same one.

7907874,5,B00000F6GK,"This is a treat for people who love Sylvie Guillem, a very idiosyncratic dancer to some. As a portrait, it will seem incomplete to people who are interested in the person, because she is not an extrovert, and whatever she says about herself is reticent and rather vague, but her stubborn, defiant side - so typical for many great artists - is evident. I hope whoever reads this will understand that I am very partial - I consider her  the most elegant dancer I have seen, but I am just a dance lover, by no means professionally knowledgeable. The 2 DVDs will give a taste of all her abilities, both as a classical ballerina, and as a modern dancer in totally different modes and idioms. I am very glad I got them.",1413072000,2,713,4.401515151515151

7907877,5,B00000F6GK,"Sylve Guillem: At Work & Portrait, is a collection of two TV documentaries on the dancer, both from when she was relatively young.
In the first, 'Sylvie Guillem: At Work', her years at the Paris Opera Ballet are highlighted, before her controversial departure from the company (I'd recommend watching this one first). It provides an insightful look at the young dancer, of only 22 years old, throughout rehearsals, sculpting-appointments, performances, and the day-to-day stress of a dancer's life. The ballet, 'In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated', is highlighted here, as this work was made on the Paris Opera Ballet in 1987, with her as a lead soloist - shown both in rehearsal and on stage. In this film, there are videos of Guillem dancing Raymonda, Cinderella, Four Last Songs (Rudi van Dantzig), La Luna (Maurice Bjart), and In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.
The second film, 'Sylvie Guillem: Portrait', is more of an extended interview with Guillem, intertwined with her dances. She discusses her taste in dance, her favorite choreographers, and her early years in school. This film was made in 1993, where she is only slightly older, 28, after leaving the Paris Opera and joining the Royal Ballet. Much more of her dancing is shown here, including a video of her at 15, Episodes (Maurice Bjart), Swan Lake (guesting with the Kirov Ballet), Sissi (Maurice Bjart), Manon, Wet Woman (Mats Ek), and In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated, among other videos.
Of course, it goes without saying that Guillem is stunning, and these documentaries are a great depiction of her earlier life. The filming is in good quality, and both booklets provide a large amount of useful information on her life. It's great to see that these TV documentaries about such a stunning ballerina have been released on DVD, allowing her legacy to live on for future generations. I'd recommend this to a fan of dance and the performing arts; it's also an absolute necessity for a lover of ballet.",1333670400,34,1966,4.996951219512195
7907878,2,B00000F6GK,"Sylvie Guillem was a breathtaking dancer at the time this film was made.  Footage of her is in consequence very valuable.  Unfortunately, however, the conception of this documentary was distressingly poor.  For example: the film constrains the viewer to share the persona of an obsessive male voyeur (complete with inane and/or inappropriate observations in a male voiceover), virtually stalking Mlle. Guillem throughout the film.  This is highly bizarre and disturbing--not to mention distracting--addition to the traditional documentary style.  In addition, this approach keeps Guillem herself very much at a distance.  Partly for this reason, the film is also very boring; its makers could not even manage a meaningful interview with Guillem.  In spite of such inadequacies, however, the film does (occasionally) allow one some small insight into the daily life of this amazing ballerina.  For this reason, special fans of Guillem may still want to see it (her ""Breakfast with the Arts"" television appearance was 10,000 times better!).  General viewers and ballet fans will probably want to avoid; this is one of the worst ballet documentaries ever.",1199836800,4,1152,5.463276836158192
7907879,5,B00000F6GK,I have an old recording of this documentary from when it aired on A&E network in 1989. I would love to be able to loan it to my ballet students but will not risk my copy. This is the best dance documentary I've seen and it truly needs to be released on DVD for everyone to enjoy!,1158364800,8,279,3.912280701754386
7907880,5,B00000F6GK,"This appears to be the first significant piece of documentary/performance footage of the Divine Sylvie ever released commercially.  It dates from 1987, when Sylvie was 22 years old and still the star of the POB under Nureyev. It is mostly rehearsal and behind-the-scenes footage, with some performance in both traditional and modern roles. Obviously, it's value lies in the footage of Sylvie in motion; the filmaker's techniques and narration are distractions to be ignored (""... like trying to catch a moment of eternity in a butterfly net""). I have seen new copies of this video sell for $250 on the internet. Good luck finding one, but there is an alternative.

A recent search indicates that 35 libraries in the US have this video in their circulating collections. I obtained one through inter-library loan fairly quickly. See your local reference librarian or library system website about this.

Sylvie has said that she doesn't really believe in recorded ballet. The amount of footage of her available is limited; every minute is priceless. This video is a must for the true Sylvie fanatic.

P.S: This video is copy protected using Macrovision, so you can't copy it unless you buy one of those converter boxes to defeat the copy protection. But this would be a copyright violation, and is therefore out of the question. I know you wouldn't stoop to this, but each of us is responsible for his own actions.",1149465600,10,1411,4.940928270042194
