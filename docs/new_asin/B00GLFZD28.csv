8624260,5,B00GLFZD28,I saw this in the theater in the late 1960s when I was 8 years old.  It was shocking then with a great message.  It's message is still current for today.  It features a very young Eric Estrada as Nicky Cruz.  Pat Boone makes a convincing David Wilkerson.  A classic Christian movie.,1454716800,3,282,4.346153846153846
