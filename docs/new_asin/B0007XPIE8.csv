8053659,5,B0007XPIE8,"Love the low budget stinkers that somehow transcend their limitations?  This one's a classic example of the form.  What holds it together?  1) The actors--not only Basil Rathbone, John Saxon, and Dennis Hopper, but the lesser known performers as well, in particular Florence Marly as the enigmatic green alien girl.  2) Some truly stylish (for the time) special effects, stolen from one, some say two, Russian films.  3) But most importantly, there's the end of the film--cheesy, it's true, but also effective.  To say more would be telling.  (And for the Famous Monsters buffs, there's the cameo by Forrest J. Ackerman--the guy with the tray.)

Can't find it?  Check out Sinister Cinema.  Their print's a bit grainy and scratched, but you've got to wonder if anybody's bothering to do a better version.",1167004800,3,803,5.015151515151516
