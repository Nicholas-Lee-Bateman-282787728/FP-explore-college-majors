8206145,2,B000SOGX9K,There were many things which keep this from reaching a two or three star production - never above - It draaaaags sentencing the viewer to many minutes uneventful ! - The drama is low key for what a prison can really entail.  The acting is good and could have been put to a higher level of challenge. - The baloon was the best thing of all - and returning the escapee to time was just another downer for the viewer !,1456617600,,415,4.1234567901234565

The United States Of America's current largest employer is civilian keepers of the law.

It cost more for us to keep one person in prison or jail than it does to raise most children dependent on society for the first 11 years of their life.",1419465600,2,350,4.3538461538461535

8206150,5,B000SOGX9K,IT ARRIVED ON TIME IT BROUGHT BACK SOME MEMORIES AS I USE TO WORK AT SCI ROCK VIEW IT HAS REALLY CHANGED SINCE 1978 AS FAR AS THE SELLERS EXPLANATION OF THE MOVIE IT WAS SPOT ON NO DISAPPOINTMENTS AT ALL,1389052800,,203,3.975609756097561
8206151,4,B000SOGX9K,"Movie took place in a real prison, using real inmates and prison staff as actors. My review may be somewhat biased though, because I worked as a Corrections Officer at Rockview when this was filmed.  That in and of itself was interesting.  The story line was believable up until the balloon scene.  It did portray prison life pretty much as it was, at lease for the time period of the movie.  Enjoyed the movie when it premiered in State College, PA,  and enjoyed it now, 35 years later.",1379635200,3,487,4.488636363636363
