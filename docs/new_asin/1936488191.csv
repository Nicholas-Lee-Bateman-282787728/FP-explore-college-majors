203767,5,1936488191,"I had already read the companion book, ""The Harbinger, which I highly recommend, since it has additional details, but the video was a good complement to the book.  The book presents the historical facts in a story format, which makes it an good read. My only complaint about the video is that the author repeats himself too much on the same talking points.  I guess that he was anxious to get his point across to the viewer.",1334707200,34,424,4.4935064935064934
203768,4,1936488191,"A very compelling and important message.  I prefer the book called ""The Harbinger"", but this is a good medium to share with friends.  Also available is ""The Harbinger"" as an audiobook.  I recommend these all.  Message is too complex, too accurate to be coincidences.  A real wake-up to what is happening, and where we, as a nation, seem to be heading.  Recommend you buy two, possibly in different mediums, so you can loan one out.",1334707200,17,431,4.68

203770,5,1936488191,"I just finished reading the Harbinger, and the one word that best describes the experience is ... amazing!  The author shows too many ""coincidences"" since 911 for everything to be just coincidence!  I will be encouraging others to read this book.",1333756800,3,246,4.975609756097561
203771,5,1936488191,"If this doesn't cause your hair to stand-up on the back of your neck, then I don't know what will!  It is simply amazing how a little verse tucked away in Isaiah can have such a prophetic meaning to us here in the United States.  Like many other parts of the Bible, the statistical probability that these events happened by random chance is simply absurd.",1333065600,18,355,4.446153846153846
203772,4,1936488191,"I liked it. It was chilling. Makes one think. However, and this is a personal thing, even though the content of this book is factual, I do not like the novel style and mixing fact with fiction. The book should have been presented in a straightforward style. The Scriptural exegisis is a tad shaky. You cannot build a whole scenario around one or two verses of Scripture, which has to be read and interpreted in its context.",1332460800,4,423,4.5064935064935066

203777,5,1936488191,The comments on if people believe it are not are sad. This isn't a Disney movie but played  out before our very eyes facts of what's happening and what has happened in the past. It's on point and a wake up call! It's not for entertainment but for revelation to a nation to return to God before it's to late! He has been given amazing God given insight and its facts.

203930,5,1936488191,"The key thing in this video by Messianic Rabbi Cahn, and his books, The Harbinger, and now The Mystery of the Shemitah, reveals that God's laws are still in effect for all believer's. The Mystery of the Shemitah shows in excruciating detail that , even before the Great Depression, God has been enforcing His law of Sabbath Rest every 7 years -- for a long time past to the present. This irrefutable proof in the book destroys the very foundations of Dispensational theology as created by the false self-proclaimed prophet, John Nelson Darby. Darby is the man who in 1833 started preaching the New Doctrine of the secret Rapture, and many other apostate doctrines that were completely unknown or heard of within the orthodox Christian church for the 1833 years BEFORE John Darby. Who is Darby? He came from the British Christian cult known as the Plymouth Brethren. He broke away from that small denomination after much controversy arose. However, his New doctrine and teachings which essentially gave a totally new interpretation of the Old and New Testaments, based on his own claimed visions and enlightenment from God. He is the creator of what is known as Dispensationalism, which holds that God did different things in different ""dispensations"" (or time periods) of mankind's history. Darby was rejected by the major British theologians of his day, most notably Spurgeon and others. Darby refused to answer their pointed questions as the origin and validity of his new interpretations of the Christian scriptures. The most startling being the Rapture of the church before the Great Tribulation period began. Prior to Darby, this Rapture theory or doctrine was completely unknown in the history of the Christian church, as were his many other NEW allegedly prophetic revelations from God. Darby in fact made many prophetic announcements and most of them NEVER came true. That alone distinguishes Darby as a False Prophet according to the commandments relating to prophets in God's Word or the Bible.

Dispensationalism as Darby created it was brought by him to the United States in the 1840s. He presented it to Cyrus Scofield and Dwight Moody and they accepted it without question. In fact, in most Baptist churches since then, the Scofield Bible was, and still is, the only accepted Bible for preaching and teaching. I know since I grew up at Emmanuel Baptist Church in Toledo, Ohio. Everyone had to have the Scofield Bible since all of its eschatological footnotes as written by Scofield is the sole manner in which Baptists interpret the Bible. Sadly, many of Scofield's prophetic footnotes came straight out of Darby's theological invention named ""Dispensationalism."" Anyone who cares to research and investigate the claims and biblical interpretations made by Darby and his successors will quickly find out that Dispensationalism is an apostate doctrine and a theological FICTION of the highest order.

If you asked me how many Baptist and other evangelical preachers don't even know who John Nelson Darby was, I would have to tell you that dozens of them whom I have asked knew nothing about who Darby was or where the Rapture Doctrine first came from. Most are never told by their seminary, Bible college or theology school professors. They have no idea where this apostate doctrine came from. They believe Darby's ideas and reinterpretations of orthodox Christian doctrines prior to 1833 where always there. Not so at all. Darby's Rapture theory in fact came from an ecstatic vision that an Irish women named Mary MacDonald had where she claimed to have had the revelation that God was going to ""rapture"" the church away BEFORE the Great Tribulation began. The reasoning was under Darby that God would not appoint His Children to suffer the wrath poured out on the evil, wicked people among mankind who refuse to repent before God -- even in spite of God's increasing wrath that seeks to compel them to Repent. Darby's doctrine suggests that all Christians will be raptured away secretly by the Lord Jesus Christ, taken to Heaven for the marriage feast of the Lamb, and then return with Jesus at a later date at the end of the 7 years of the Great Tribulation. This ignores the longstanding orthodox church teachings that the Two Witnesses (or Prophets of God) mentioned in Revelation will have the power to combat the Beast and False Prophet and defend Christians during the Tribulation by 1)  Turning bodies of water into blood, 2)  calling down plagues and diseases on whomever they so will, and 3)  stopping all rainfall on where they please. Anyone who has that kind of power can wreak havoc on any efforts by the Evil Beast and False Prophet -- as well as have serious impact on weather, personal health and destroying available drinking water supplies. Darby's false doctrine simply presumes that God will not protect His Children during the Great Tribulation, and will be helpless to segregate them into safe areas while He pours out His Wrath on the evil doers in this world. That reduces God to being limited in His power and ability -- when one takes the time to think through Darby's false doctrines, especially in light of the orthodox Christian teachings PRIOR to Darby which taught all along that Christians would be on earth during the Tribulation and be God's witnesses for all eternity to His Judgment and Wrath poured out on those who reject the blood atonement of Jesus Christ and refuse to repent. Investigate John Nelson Darby yourself and you'll see that what I am stating here is completely True.",1421366400,,5534,4.965480043149946

203962,5,1936488191,"Please be forwarned. This so-called ""RABBI BRUCE LEROY"" is an allias who runs under different names in order to post the Anti-Semitic diatribe you now read here. ""Rabbi Bruce Leroy"" has gone under the names of RAFAEL, REMUEL, GABRIEL, ANGEL, LEGNA, and other aliases in order to post all of these off-topic postings. The evidence is self-evident. All one has to do is go to the comments section of THE HARBINGER, THE TRUTH ABOUT THE HARBINGER, THE HARBINGER DECODED, THE MYSTERY OF THE SHEMITAH, THE ISAIAH 9:10 JUDGMENT, and all other HARBINGER-RELATED BOOKS AND MATERIALS ON AMAZON.COM. You will note that the same postings are posted by individuals going by any one of these aliases. This is not coincidental, but in doing this, this individual has given himself away, and has exposed his deceit to the public. He serves one of the greatest critics of The Harbinger, though I am not certain if he put him up to this or not. The fact remains this deceitful person is in his camp and regardless of whether or not he was put up to this, it is self-efident deceit and cunning. The articles cited by this person who goes by these various aliases have one thing in common; they are Anti-Semitic in nature, they disparage and criticize Pastor and Messianic Rabbi Jonathan Cahn, and they attack me and my own book on THE HARBINGER - THE TRUTH ABOUT THE HARBINGER, because it is the only literary work currently in print that corroborates what THE HARBINGER says and biblically addresses almost all of the criticisms leveled at the author's New York Times bestseller. Those who seek to know the whole truth about THE HARBINGER and why the critics are so wrong about it, should obtain a copy of THE TRUTH ABOUT THE HARBINGER, and be forewarned about this reviewer who uses various aliases to copy, paste, and post the same Anti-Semitic screed you read here. You have been forewarned. I plan to contact Amazon.com about this, because it is an abuse of its policies, and it is off-topic.
I warned the chief critic that in time, it would become evident where the tares lie, and it has become increasingly evident. This latest deceit by the critics of Rabbi Cahn has been made possible so that the deceit of Rabbi Cahn's enemies may come to the surface, as more things will be coming to the surface in time, and are coming to the surface even as I write this. The poeple who have taken to the public their criticisms of Rabbi Cahn have fallen for a Hyper-Dispensationalist/Cessationist/Deist cleverly crafted lie about what Rabbi Cahn teaches and about the man whom none of these people know or have ever met.
I know the man, and have knoiwn him for over ten years. I am an active minister in his ministry and teach at the Beth Israel Arise & Shine Academy as a Biblical Instructor by God's grace and calling in Christ. I know what the man teaches, what he believes in and what he does not believe in. I bear witness before God in Christ right here and right now that what these men have both written and said about Jonthan Cahn is entirely false and without merit.
I also bear witness that what you will read in my book, THE TRUTH ABOUT THE HARBINGER, and other articles I've written and posted on my website, THE PEPSTER'S POST: A VOICE IN CYBERSPACE, expose the nefarious deeds of many individuals who have publicly slandered without cause a brother of our faith and borne false witness agianst him in violation of God's clear commandment.
I also bear witness here and now, that the connections these critics have tried to make about Rabbi Cahn to the Kabbalah, Jewish Mysticism, and the Occult are entirely and wholly false and wrong.
I know this man, they do not.
They speak of the ignorance that is in them, I speak from knowledge; both of the Scriptures - which is essential to debate this, and from knowing the man himself who wrote this book.
You want to know about the man, what he believes, what he teaches, what his book is all about; read it from someone who knows him.
You want to read lies, then go to his critics, who have never met him, do not know him personally, do not know what he believes and teaches, and rather than ask him or accept what someone like those who know him know about this teachings; they've instead have been quick to judge, and have misread him, misjudged him, been quick to go public with their innacuracies and mischaracterizations about him, and have spread the innacurate unbiblical teachings of Cessionist-based Hyper-Dispensationalism coupled with the argumentations of Post Modernist Deism, to capture and take away God's flock from this end time warning and call to repentance to God's people.
The latest deciet by this phony here, makes it self-evident just what lengths some of these people will go to as they slander all Jews for the crimes of some unbelievers who work with other unbelievers from among the nations for evil.
It is time this deceit end. So for this purpose I have written and now post this warning so that the reading public may be aware of this and not be fooled by clever malice couched in biblical jargon.

I never heard the shout ""Allahu Akbar"" before this run-in, with them, on my United Flight from Phoenix, Arizona. I was puzzled what it all meant and what was going on until after ""911"" and I saw his picture in the paper. The impact grew larger as I tried to figure out why I had seen a ""dry run"" and couldn't do anything about it. The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment"" as well as the book, ""The Harbinger"" that I ordered thru Amazon as well, brought into focus that America was being given a call to ""repent"", and had missed it! The impact of ""The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment and ""The Harbinger"" has awaken me from a deep sleep and has made me aware of the seriousness of the God's judgment on America, my life and that of my families lives.

The only hope for America right now is the promise found in 2 Chronicles 7:14, ""if my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from  their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.""

I understand that Rabbi Cahn is making a direct connection to the events of 9/11 and Isaiah, but the proposition is somewhat labored. In the second disk, there is a salvation message which is connected to the premise of the first disk. This was well done and I think would be important for non believers or new Christians.

204107,1,1936488191,"In my opinion, the entire ""Harbinger"" series of materials and thinking omits and does not bring forth the real facts of the true story about the collapse of the New York City Towers and all that followed.  The ""Harbinger"" is a fairy tale spun by people who refuse to address the real facts of what happened to the NYC Towers....

1)  9-11 was without doubt an inside job
2)  BIG PEOPLE made millions of dollars from the 9-11 chirade
3)  Nuclear nano thermite was used to bring the towers of NYC down, and the firemen in attendance described the EXPLOSIONS of bombs going off with the ""boom, boom, boom"" sounds of precision.
4)  First responders DIED of radiation illnesses, which the government tried to deny, because it put a huge DENT in their story
5)  Larry Silverstein ""spilled the beans"" when he made the statement that they decided to ""PULL BLDG 7"".....a ""demolition term"" used in the DEMOLITION industry.  He made millions from the insurance of the buildings!
6)  NO PLANE FLEW INTO THE PENTAGON....that was either 1) a missil or 2) an inside explosion, set to detonate when the rest of the ""play"" unfolded.  It is interesting to note that on 9-10-01, statements were made by Donald Rumsfeld that TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS were missing and unaccounted for.  Just so happened that the situation was remedied on 9-11 by bombing the accounting department of the PENTAGON, and killing the accountants....how fortunate for the BLACK BUDGET!
7)  NO PLANE CRASHED IN PA....Has ANYBODY every heard of a plane crash in which NOTHING is left to identify plane parts, black boxes, bodies, skeletons, luggage, or ANYTHING?  NOT EVER!  Something happened there, but it was NOT a plane crash!

Knowing these things plus more would bring down the ""fairy tales"" found in ""The Harbinger Materials""....Save your money on the ""Harbinger"" story and it's follow up materials.  Those things DO NOT correlate with the TRUTH of what really happened on 9-11 in NYC!  There is enough false speculation on this entire story, but the FACTS do not support the government lies, nor ""The Harbinger"" fabled story, unless you are into ""fairy tales and lies""....",1389052800,5,2131,4.875

After reading Isaiah 9:10, which should be done in the greater context of Isaiah, it became clear that the author has no real understanding of the text.

If one were to simply read, it would become clear that the verse has nothing to do with gentile nations, not to mention the specific nation, America. Isaiah 9:10 is about Israel. To say otherwise would make the Lord a terrible communicator. Not only that, but if Isaiah 9:10 could be applied to America, Im sure it would be easy enough to apply it to any other nation... the verse is vague enough.

I have read the Harbinger and watched the DVD many times and the message is clear : God wants back in America's public life and so far I see no signs of that happening; quite the opposite, in fact. God is losing ground rapidly, and each day brings another affront to Him in the name of diversity or as a sop to atheists. Jonathan Cahn points out the consequences America faces if we fail to heed the warning signs of judgment. But he brings hope as well. America is on trial. We are at a critical juncture in history. We must heed the warming signs - his facts are easily confirmed via internet. If you have struggled with the question of how 9/11 could have occurred in this great country, how we have been deceived by the socialists and One Worlders masquerading as Democrats to bring this country to self-destruct- well, here's your answer. how can we get this book out there cheaper- it's so desperately needed in massive circulation!",1377129600,,1109,4.6923076923076925

Does a relatively obscure verse of scripture hold the secret to the pain and suffering America has been experiencing in increasing does since 9/11? Are America's key leaders unknowingly fulfilling a prophetic destiny of national judgment by uttering words from the Bible they don't comprehend? Is the United States following in the footsteps of ancient Israel with a spirit of defiance against God leading to increasingly severe judgments? Is America in danger of impending judgment? And is this judgment revealed in an ancient mystery that foretells current events down to the exact dates?

Those who read the account after 9/11 thinking that it was a good thing, were really speaking judgment over the US. Do not discount the Bible and the prophesies therein.

Perhaps it is because I read the book first and it was so very good, that I had great expectations for the film.  The film should have been created in a movie form, somewhat like the book was written, first person, with other people in the book, making the story line very interesting.

204271,5,1936488191,"After reading, ""The Harbinger"", I found myself engaged in a search to authenticate the claims made by Jonathan Cahn. It took me to this DVD. What I found has transformed how I view the world and the urgency of the times that we find ourselves. I was so amazed by the claims that I dove into a personal investigation and have now made three presentations to church groups based on this film and where it leads.

The film (and the book) could have done a better job of explaining the details to the facts rather than simply sensationalizing them. This is where I hope that my post will help explain and uncover the claims more clearly.

This is a two DVD set with the first delving into the relationship between the judgment brought upon Israel (described in Isaiah 9) and their final destruction - and the destruction of the twin towers on 9/11/01. The second DVD exposes the TIMING of the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent housing/economic crash experienced seven years later. That is, how our financial institutions were brought to ruin in a very strange manner that has the fingerprint of God all over it.

For those of you who have not yet seen it, I can assure you that you will find your jaw dropping more than once as the facts are presented. For those of you who have seen it, I hope to clarify (as I've stated before) some of the more obscure points and to present a fascinating extrapolation that goes far beyond this DVD.

Here is an overview of the correlation of the harbingers between ancient Israel and the 9/11 attacks:
1) The Breach - God removes His hedge of protection
2) The Terrorist - Assyrians were the terrorists of their day and 9/11 terrorists were of similar origin
3) The Bricks have Fallen
4) WE WILL REBUILD! - The cry of defiance against God
5) The Gazit Stone
6) The Sycamore Tree
7) The Erez Tree to replace the Sycamore
8) The Utterance (The Vow) - Leaders must speak it for the entire nation
9) The Prophecy - The actual quote is spoken in advance from the leaders

Some common questions and observations I have come across (most are in the DVD):

1) Question: Why would we be unique to this correlation? Why not Angola or Peru or China?
The reason is that when this country was founded, it was consecrated to God during George Washington's inaugural address. You will find that he not only consecrated this nation to God, but gave warning if we were to turn from Him. (See [...]). Solomon, in the same fashion dedicated the temple to God (2nd Chronicles 7:19-20). The United States is unique in doing this. It can bring blessings or it can bring judgment.

2) Observation: The rendering of Isaiah 9:10 in the Septuagint states, ""The bricks are fallen down, but comes let us hew stones, and cut down sycamores and cedars, and let us build for ourselves a tower."" - A TOWER!?

3) Observation: The 9/11 attacks led to the crash of the stock market which occurred on September 17, 2001 - the largest DOW point loss in history to that point. It occurred on the Hebrew calendar date of Elul 29 (the last day on the Hebrew calendar). What is significant is that this fell on a Sabbatical year (only 1 in 7) which made it a Shemitah. On this day (as the DVD explains) it is Jewish tradition that all debts are wiped away - that there is a leveling of finances between parties.
If this weren't strange enough odds of happening on this date (1 in 2,555), the next collapse of the DOW (the largest point loss to that time) happened EXACTLY 7 Hebrew years later on September 29, 2008. This is again Elul 29 - and again, it falls on a Sabbatical year, making it the next, contiguous Shemitah. Extremely, extremely improbable.
But it gets better. On this second crash, the DOW point loss was exactly 7%, the actual point loss was exactly 777.7 points, and it occurred because congress failed to pass a $700B bailout for the banks!

4) Observation: In 1789, the U.S. capital was NYC (not WDC). The twin towers fell on the exact block that George Washington consecrated this nation to God back in 1789. In fact, you can search and find the statements that the church where this he spoke these words actually did suffer a major crack in its foundation after the towers collapsed.

5) Question: So if major financial collapses happened in September, 2001 and then again EXACTLY 7 Hebrew years later in 2008, what might be in store for September, 2015? Well, this brings us to a topic that I will not go into here, but I HIGHLY encourage you investigate for yourselves. In a search engine, type in phrases such as, ""Blood Moon Lunar Tetrads 2015"" or, ""Lunar Tetrads Israel 2015"". First however, clearly read Genesis 1:14-15 and understand that much prophecy is revealed by God in the sun, moon, and stars. (Think Star of Bethlehem or phrases about the moon turning to blood, the sun turning to darkness, the stars falling from the sky, etc. Your research will lead to fascinating events.

I hope this helps. God Bless. Shalom.",1368230400,6,4940,4.551801801801802

Content-wise, you need to remember that this is a documentary with an expository style in delivery.  Dr. Cahn presents his research in a compelling, insightful, and systematic manner.  The material is of a prophetic/interpretive genre which lends itself somewhat to the predisposition of the viewer's beliefs.  The parallel of events and Scripture in the histories of Israel and the U.S. offer intriguing and uncanny considerations.
Quality-wise, It is not meant to be a top-of-the-industry, motion picture style production.  However, with that being said, the final  result is good and enhances and does not detract from the message.
I highly recommend this for those who are concerned about the present state of America.  If the message is true, then there is reason for Dr. Cahn's warning.",1365811200,,864,5.2700729927007295

204322,5,1936488191,"Understanding that you can take a lot of scripture and make it apply to a lot of things, well, is a good thing but some will also use that for evil. Mr. Cahn starts with a very simple premise which I and most Evangelical Christians believe. Just as Israel was and is, the United States has been chosen by God to be His people and God has blessed this nation abundantly over our history. Even the Revolutionary War reminds me of battles Israel was involved and the odds against her were so great that only God's divine intervention and plan were the reason for success.

Mr. Cahn makes the case that the scripture Isaiah 9:10 is being played out again but this time in the USA. He makes the case step by step and makes a convincing argument that we are rebelling against God and because of that rebellion, God ALLOWED 9/11 to occur. Did not say God made it happen but He allowed it to happen. A huge difference. Our nation humbled itself before God during its founding and presented itself for the purpose of being missionaries to the world. Fast forward to the 1960's and we have done but tell God we know best.

Mr. Cahn knows the Bible and while many might think he is misinterpuritng, I would ask, how do you know that and show me some proof. In the end only God knows the answer but I do believe the author has it nailed pretty good.",1363737600,8,1337,4.322709163346613

If you won't/can't read the book, you must watch this DVD. It will be life-changing. If enough will do this and understand why we must repent, we may have a chance of escaping the full judgment of God that He is warning of us.

204330,5,1936488191,"Wake up America!!!  Wake up world!!!  Open your eyes and see what is happening for YHWH, Adonai Elohim, will not excuse you for ""lack of knowledge"" when judgment comes.  The ""I had no idea, Lord""  excuse won't work.  Elohim is all around us and has made His presence know to all from the beginning of time.

I am extremely cautious about the things I read outside the Bible.  Our Messiah, Yeshua, warns us, even commands us: ""Do not be deceived!""  I have searched high and low for ""true"" men and women of God with a theory of approach that all ""mankind"" fall short in some way or another.

I have watched many DVD's and read many books on prophecy and general Bible topics.  This man, this Rabbi Jonathan Cahn, is the real deal.  Don't take my word for it.  Don't take Rabbi Cahn's word for it.  Test ALL ""men"", ""religion"" and theological doctrine and interpretation first by reading the Word for yourself (cover to cover) and second by ""testing the tree by its fruit.""
If you know and love our one true Messiah, son of YHWH and He is leading your path - it's easy to see the sheep from the wolves.

I have tested the ""fruit"" of Rabbi Cahn's ministry and through my own study believe him to be a man who knows and loves his Elohim, who is faithful and careful in his message and full of love for all people - Jews and Gentiles alike - without condemnation or reckless damnation.

Beyond this DVD, I have carefully ""ventured"" to his ministry website and find myself listening more and more to this man, always testing what is said through my own work, reading the Word of YHWH.

Thank Elohim for Rabbi Cahn and Shalom Aleichem to all who read this review.

204345,3,1936488191,"If you are looking for biblical exegesis (taking apart a passage, interpreting it), you will not find it here. If you are curious if a new, vital fulfillment of a prophetic passage has been ""discovered"", this is not it. If you're looking for a strong link between ancient Israel and modern America with justification for that interpretation, this product will not meet your expectation. What you will find is a series of nine ""harbingers""--Cahn's interesting take on prophetic parallels between God's judgment on ancient Israel and an impending, similar judgment on America. A person with the mindset that America has walked away from God will likely be very sympathetic with Cahn's viewpoint. They may not be disturbed by the lack of scriptural exegesis, or other foundational work from the Bible, to arrive at that viewpoint. Watching a well-produced, media-rich video may be enough... but declaring a series of ""harbingers"" through presumptive interpretation seems too much like circular thinking to me.

I credit Cahn for a warning to America and a call to repentance. I agree with many of his premises, especially that Isaiah records Israel purposing to rebuild itself despite God and defiantly stronger after his judgment, impervious to future judgment. I thought that the DVDs were very well made and moved from image to image, pictures and videos, in an engaging way. I credit him for stringing then-senator Edwards' quote of Is. 9 with a reference to a sycamore and a later conifer. I appreciate him noting rabbinic ""commentaries"" as well--but even these lack references and stand as the authoritative statements of the one quoting them. I am glad that he looks to a message of hope and salvation before closing his message (and was surprised to find direction to Christ as God as I watched the video without any previous information-prejudice and did not know who he was).

Despite many good attributes, the lack of an interpretative foundation is where the product fails for me. It is largely an extended opinion and series of parallels with no technical attempt to build a biblical basis for the interpretation of events (such as the nearly miraculous, cornerstone representation of the ""Sycamore of Ground Zero"" at around 28 minutes into DVD 1 as a fulfillment of Is. 9). A sycamore being replaced by a certain family of conifers, related to a cedar under Hebrew etymology, becomes the lynchpin of his modern application-interpretation of Is. 9. But it is all built on parallels--coincidences, not biblical interpretation. Moving from Israel to America, interpretatively, is tenuous and strained. But the applications will ring true to many Christians--and these may be enough for some. Some sympathetic viewers may not have any questions about relating an ancient text to modern America with a few, narrowly selected, parallels. They may agree that politicians who improperly use Scripture portend the ""ominous"" (Rabbi Cahn at about 40 minutes) and not simply another occasion of the frequent misuse of Scripture by those who are not looking at its background and context (such as using Mizpah as a blessed relationship vow). They may find it unusual that ""stones"" (monuments) would be raised at Ground Zero or that economic and political repercussions of 9-11 would undulate between cries for God's help and proclamations of secular, humanistic self-sufficiency. I sympathize with the tone and intent of the product and appreciate that the full title leaves the thesis in a QUESTION FORM: ""Is There an Ancient Mystery that Foretells America's Future?"" Perhaps not... But perhaps it's enough to recognize the parallels, take the warning seriously, and realize the importance of Cahn's call for us to have real hope and salvation as judgment inevitably approaches--regardless of whether Is. 9 portends this for America specifically. My sense of hermeneutics would have me rate this with one star. The genius of the parallels and production values in this DVD would earn it at least four stars.",1362009600,5,4006,5.1710323574730355

204361,2,1936488191,"If you've ever found yourself agreeing with the conclusions of someone,  but for very different reasons, this film may well put you in such a position. Many people in general, and Bible believing Christians/Jews in particular, feel alarmed at the rapid cultural decay that has taken place in America over the last several decades. Ineffective attempts to rectify the situation have left many to see the slide as God's judgement upon the nation. Fair enough. But how that judgement can be described is where the parting of the ways appears.
This film states that the attack on the WTC on 9/11 is the manifestation of God's judgement upon America for it's willful turning away from him. A similar scenario happened to ancient Israel and the author uses Isaiah 9:10 to parallel the demise of ancient Israel to that of America. This verse is explained in most commentaries as the defiance of Israel to repent after being attacked by Assyria and its national vow to rebuild itself without God's help. The film submits that this is what is taking place in America in the wake of 9/11. The parallels are laid out in 9 harbingers, or warnings that herald the coming of further judgements. Destruction is not inevitable if the nation repents.
This is a short film that repeats itself. Dramatic music and visual doom for full affect. Underlying premise is that Israel and America were both established by God for the same purpose and thereby share many parallels. Weak in some important ways. Arbitrarily selects 9/11 as a starting point of judgements, ignoring prior events. Uses solar calendar to mark Biblical time. Treats scripture like riddles to be solved by applying one's imagination. Sincere, but be on guard.
Post script: It may be too generous to call sincere. The money to be made preying on the faithful is timeless. This sensationalist production is targeted toward separating you from your money.",1361404800,9,1901,4.940625

As has been said before you can't legislate morality any more than you can prevent fire from being hot or water from being wet. This DVD brings to light the reason America is experiencing the judgement of God. The seeds of sins that America has planted are producing evil fruit and this evil fruit is not the cause of America's problems but it is the effect or the result of a nation turned against God. You must see this DVD and be awakened to pray for the people of America to repent and come back to God who is their only Hope.

Israel failed to listen to God and America seems to be headed down the same destructive path. The simple truth is we NEED God. The entire world does and if we continue to lose perspective on that we will lose his Blessing. The video points out the incredible and incompetent if not intentional choices of our leaders. It's as if they looked up what NOT to do and then did them. Are you kidding me? Watch the video, and when you do you will buy it for everyone you know. This is not filled with opinions and "" well as I see it "" hogwash, but rather the actual horrific choices made and spoken, and it's all on video as fact. Unbelievable.

The video actually has more information than the book, which is surprising but probably due to the manner in which the book is written.

Like Israel at that time, America has rejected God and now worships idols such as money and power.  As a result, God has warned us that we must examine our ways and repent, asking for His forgiveness and for Him to renew the blessings that were ours in the past.  Based on the excellent book, ""The Harbinger"" by Jonathan Cahn, this DVD set shows convincingly that the tragedy of 9/11 was a warning of future judgement and not a random occurrence.

Don't get cut short, watch this and dwell upon the possible outcomes, then decide what you need to do to be ready for what might be just around the corner.

I've always loved it when a plan comes together, and this plan being perpetrated on the citizens of this country by our leaders is priceless; nobody has a clue really.  If this DVD set is your only exposure to this interesting material so be it; Isaiah 9:10 Judgement is well worth watching many times, and do not forget to invite some friends over to share this message.

That being said the video is NOT poor quality at all as other people stated. I enjoyed the video & thought it was worth what I paid for it especially since I can share it with my neighbors, family & friends.

Had they bothered to read the context of their quotes, they would have discovered that Israel actually used those very words in defiance against God & effectively called down a curse upon themselves. Rabbi Cahn continues showing us the shocking parallels between Israel's words in Isaiah 9:10 and the happenings on 9/11/01. The exactness with which these words were fulfilled is amazing. I have bought several copies of both ""The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment"" and ""The Harbinger"" to give to friends and family as well as enthusiastically recommended both to many people.

204478,1,1936488191,"Isaiah 9:10

I did not read the Harbinger but did watch the video at a church. I find Jonathan Cahn's presentation lacking in sound analysis of scripture. He ignores Israel as the obvious context of the chapter and replaces it with the destruction of several buildings in a Gentile nation.

Fulfillment was not in Isaiah's day but is now being fulfilled in the last days that began with the advent of Christ. God's message of judgment was sent to all of Israel which includes Jerusalem and Judah. The judgment occurs at the same time for all of Israel; it's not two separate judgments, one for the northern tribes by Assyria in 722 BC and another judgment for Judah by the Babylonians in 586 BC. The judgment pronounced for all of Israel is ""the wrath of the LORD Almighty"" (9:19) in the day of the Lord.

The ""bricks have fallen down"" and the ""fig trees have been felled"" is synonymous with Jerusalem's destruction by the Roman army in 70 A.D. The Jewish historian Josephus states that many of the trees were felled to build forts and cast up mounts against Jerusalem.

Rebuilding with dressed stone and planting cedars commenced after 1948 and continues today in Israel that has recovered from war to become the strongest and wealthiest nation in the Middle East. Their pride and arrogance of heart prevents them from returning to Him or seeking the Lord Almighty (v. 13).",1353801600,16,1374,4.7125

My only criticism of it is he uses Bible commentary references most often rather than Biblical references.  You can find commentaries to say anything.  Also, it would be better if he would not infer that the U.S. has a covenant relationship with God, because it does not.  Israel had a covenant with God, but God did not make one with us.

204506,5,1936488191,"I don't jump on theories that there's a secret code within Biblical prophecy of when and how the world will end.  This documentary, based on Jonathan Cahn's book The Harbinger, does NOT peddle such a theory.  Rather, it shows the astounding parallels, down to the exact detail, between Isaiah 9:10 and the United States, which made Is 9:10 its official policy after 9/11.  Is 9:10 reads in the New International Version, ""The bricks have fallen down, but we will rebuild with dressed stone; the fig trees have been felled, but we will replace them with cedars.""  World Net Daily produced the video.  The articles by WND entitled ""The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment"", ""Bad Things Happen on This Date Every 7 Years"", and ""'Get Radical for God,' Says Bestselling Author"" cover the main subject matter of the documentary.

The significance of Isaiah 9:10 is that Israel was boasting that God's chastisement through the Assyrians would not destroy them, that the sycamores (AKA fig trees) would be replaced by stronger coniferous trees, translated ""cedars"".  September 11's World Trade Center destruction felled a famous sycamore at Wall Street, at which the New York Stock Exchange was created in the Buttonwood Agreement--which I'd never heard of before watching this.  This documentary proposes that the sycamore on Wall Street embodies the US financial system.  After it was felled on 9/11, a coniferous tree was planted in its place, as a symbolic gesture of defiance against terrorists, but Cahn believes that response reflects the same attitude as Is 9:10, of self-reliance rather than reliance on God.  The coniferous tree replacing the sycamore on Wall Street is in poor shape today, unhealthy compared to all the trees around it, which Cahn also finds significant.  Additionally, when the sycamore was felled on 9/11, it shielded St. Paul's Chapel, where Washington dedicated the nation to God.  Federal Hall, where Washington's inauguration took place just before going to the chapel, was cracked at the foundation by 9/11, which Cahn believes symbolizes America's civil institutions in jeopardy.

Tom Daschle, John Edwards, and Barack Obama have all uttered the message of Is 9:10, and the first two actually quoted directly from it as the basis of their speeches.  Seven years to the day, in our calendar, after Tom Daschle made Is 9:10 the US's official response to 9/11 on Sep 12, 2001, the Federal Reserve let Lehman Brothers fall, precipitating the economic crisis we're currently in.  The Hebrew calendar's Shmitah day, the day on which debts are supposed to be cleared, occurs every 7 years, intended to serve as a rededication of Israel's financial affairs to God.  The Shmitah takes place on 29 Elul in the Hebrew calendar.  Sep 17, 2001, which was 29 Elul, was the greatest stock market crash up to that time.  Sep 29, 2008, the next 29 Elul of a Shmitah year, broke the record of Sep 17, 2001, ruining 7% of Wall Street, a drop of 777 points.  Shmitah means ""release"" or ""letting collapse"".  Cahn proposes that if Americans don't give up their materialism voluntarily and turn to God (release it), He will let the economy collapse further on the next Shmitah.

Rather than a code for how the world will end, Cahn is pointing to the circumstantial parallels between Is 9:10 and the United States, made all the more significant by the fact that the United States has thrice (from Daschle, Edwards, and Obama) made Is 9:10 our official national policy, which expresses self-confidence without relying on God.  His approach comes from his qualifications as a Messianic Jew, a Jewish Christian who knows the Old Testament very well.  It is well worth your while to investigate The Isaiah 9:10 Judgment.  I find Cahn's discovery as amazing as when the author of Hebrews in the New Testament saw Psalm 110's Melchizedek passage as significant.",1350172800,5,3844,5.0078616352201255

But this small but powerful parallel between Israel's judgement and captivity by the Assyrians and America's pending judgement starting with 9/11, and after, is so startling and eerie it will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand tall! If our leaders who are depicted in the video had read more of Isiah 9 than just verse 10 things may have been far different than what they are today. If we've would have gotten God back into our life (we had a chance just after 9/11) instead of continuing to deny God and extricate Him from our public places, schools and even our private lives, our flailing economy and hard times may have been avoided. I believe that our current situation is due in great part by worshiping the ""blessing"" instead of the Creator. Exactly 7 years after 9/11 we had the stock market crash of 2008 and the burst of the housing bubble. Now in 2012 we have a $16 trillion debt and a president who has no idea what he is doing.

I shrink back from saying this movie gives us all more than a stern warning about what has occurred and what is happening...and what, (dare I say it), could happen in the future.

204545,4,1936488191,"This is an interesting study on some very pertinent events in the recent history of the United States. Rabbi Cahn uses the verse in Isaiah 9:10 as a focus for his analysis of events in this country starting on September 11, 2001 with the destruction of the two World Trade Center towers representing the first shaking.

The documentary is in two parts, ""The First Shaking"" and ""The Second Shaking"" on two DVD's. In the first Rabbi Cahn seeks to show how events after 9/11 followed a similar pattern to Israel's experience before their destruction at the hands of the Assyrians. The parallels are too close to appear coincidental and Rabbi Cahn presents strong arguments that these events are warnings from God.

The information provided is interesting to anyone who is concerned about the future of this country and brings together in one place a cross section of information that applies to the events which occurred. The conclusion is we are following a similar path nationally and are being given a warning that the path we are following is the wrong one.

If a national repentance does not come wherein we return to our dependency on the grace of God, judgment will surely follow and increase in intensity.

The second DVD, ""The Second Shaking"" discusses the second warning from God as being the financial problems that have emerged and focuses on the events of September, 2008 including the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the stock market crash of 2008.

The second DVD attempts to introduce a note of hope when Rabbi Cahn urges Christians to remember God's promise in 2 Chronicles 7:14. There may be a problem there because many believe that promise was only to Israel, not to the church. God gave Israel a land but He didn't give the church a land, He gave the church a heavenly city, The New Jerusalem.

There is no real doubt that the United States is on an unsustainable path; if we continue on this path we are heading down a path toward our destruction as a nation. As students of prophecy have observed, the United States is conspicuously absent from Bible prophecy concerning the end times.

It may well be we are observing the reasons for this as they play out in real life before us. It appears doubtful to me that the USA will be restored in the time left as signs all over the world point to the soon return of the Lord Jesus Christ.",1341705600,94,2354,4.6578313253012045

Many of them did out of fear for their livelihoods. Some of us did not ... When this video was brought to our attention we KNEW it was from God. It is a warning - a stern warning - to America. Yes, we need to pray for our country and for our leaders, but it's all to no avail unless we begin REPENTING as a nation! I read some of the 1-star reports here and just have to shake my head at how blind some of us are as Believers. Too many feel we are not called  - ever - to suffer for the Gospel's sake.
