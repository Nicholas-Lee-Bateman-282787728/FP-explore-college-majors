459085,5,6302413419,"Wow, what an interesting movie!

This is the story of a patriotic, and newly married man (Welles) who goes to war for his country. He becomes badly injured in the war, but his wife (Colbert) is told via telegram that he is dead. Meanwhile, back in the states, his wife discovers that she is pregnant. She mourns the death of her husband, then approximately 1 year later she marries someone else. Eventually 20 years pass, and the original husband comes back to the states and winds up working for Colberts new husband. What a quandary...

This is quite a story and makes one wonder what one would do in the same situation...

The acting was excellent in this movie. Welles was wonderful. Claudette Colbert was equally wonderful in her role as the wife. I was pleasantly surprised at a very young Natalie Wood, who had blond hair in this film. What a cute little girl she was!

I love movies like this and I really liked this movie. I hope you will as well.",1121817600,7,956,4.477011494252873
459086,5,6302413419,"My favorite Claudette Colbert film (and I have liked most of her work)was So Proudly We Hail, but after seeing this wonderful film I think Tomorrow is Forever has bumped it off the top position as my favorite of her films.  She is superb here, as is Orson Welles, who ironically Colbert had to fight for to get to work along side her in this film, I for one am glad she did.  Most of his facial acting said more then a whole page of dialogue could of, especially is his climatic scene in the movie where he doesn't utter a single word but literally moved me to tears.  But as good as Colbert and Welles are in this film I feel the need to point out yet another incredible performance by a very young Natalie Wood who is heart breaking as the young refugee child that Welles became a guardian to.  Add these powerhouse performances to a moving well done script and you have a movie that can trully stand the test of time, I would recommend it to anyone.",1113436800,7,952,4.2430939226519335
459087,4,6302413419,"Living in those times of WWII, I remember how we all wanted to say goodbye to our loved ones and believe they would come back again, without a scratch on them.  This is a true love story of how he loved his wife so much he did  not want her to have to live with the ""man"" that returned.  He  did not realize that her love for him was so strong and alive, she could  and would have loved him forever no matter what.  Natalie Wood was  wonderful as the little girl.  Great supporting work from Greorge Brent.  I'll always love Claudette's smile and manner.  Her best role was in  ""Since You Went Away.""",932601600,17,600,4.175438596491228

For the last 1/3 to 1/2 of the movie, the picture froze or jumped ahead, boxes or squiggles appeared on the screen, little of the dialogue was audible, and it wasn't possible to follow the movie.

Some might think it manipulative, but it is manipulation I can fall for, because every story is manipulative to some degree. And if Claudette Colbert were alive today, or I was then, I would be madly in love, what a classy woman. If you have never seen it, watch it. I defy anyone, man or woman, to have a dry eye at the end...a compelling tear jerker that actually has a lot to say...",1469145600,2,547,4.121495327102804

459302,5,6302413419,"It's difficult to find a movie in which all of the main characters are truly noble and that you sympathize with each one:  the grieving wife, who naturally finds it hard to allow her son to go to war; the second husband, who stepped in at a crucial time in her life to provide stability and love; the son, who sees the evil that the Nazis could bring to his own country and so wants to defend it by going away to fight overseas; and the first husband, who stands by his original decision to become another person, no matter what the personal cost.  It really would have been wrong on several levels to try to regain the past by sacrificing the present and, thereby, the future.  All of these characters really rise to the occasion, and each is able to come to terms with the present so that misunderstandings can be overcome.  Wow!",1464825600,6,831,4.376623376623376

I always loved Orson Welles in Jane Eyre, and at first was shocked by his appearance as a lame, heavyset, lame older man.  How could he possibly play a romantic part and be attractive to Claudette Colbert?  But he was superb and it was no stretch to imagine Colbert falling in love with him all over again.  Heartache, incurable longing, exquisite memories....such is love that endures down through the ages.  I have added this movie to my DVD collection.  Bravo!",1459641600,2,530,4.585106382978723

We had to keep watching to see how the issues were resolved. I enjoyed watching Orson Welles in a film that he didn't direct. Sometimes, his directorial interest in unusual camera angles and shots can overwhelm the story (e.g., Confidential Report).

459436,5,6302413419,"I first saw this movie when I was twelve years old; I am sixty-six now, and its message, and depth, resonate more than ever as I age. The underlying lesson is that one cannot -- and should not -- reach back to the past, struggling to retrieve happiness which was, long ago, lost. As Welles so eloquently cautions, ""you will not regain what you've lost -- you will only lose what you have."" The acting, from each and every character, is stellar. Fans of ""old movies"" will recognize sooo many of their favorites within; not a one disappoints. As the mother of three adult children, I've always held back from inviting them to watch it with me (none of them have ever seen it) because I think that their generation might have some trouble with the lack of ""special effects."" By this I mean, in particular, the ""sticking point"" that Welles' face (not, for a moment, his acting, mind you, just his basic facial identity!) barely changes -- over what is supposedly a period of twenty years or so. I adore his acting, (not to mention his personal courage in his day) -- I really blame no one for this flaw, but I have always felt that it would diminish a younger viewer's response. At times, I imagine a wonderful remake (which, above all, would remediate this criticism) BUT I come to my senses quickly! I cannot imagine a finer cast; however, I do still hope that -- someday, perhaps -- such a remake will be done and that it will prove me wrong. What a day that would be!

It also does a pretty good job at compassionaltely handling a couple of very sensitive social issues for its time.

This film is a reminder of a third, and less appreciated  aspect of his genius -- what a great actor he was. His performance is breathtaking, moving, and deeply satisfying, in the service of the plot, which is good, but more importantly, in the service of the tragedy of lost youth, lost time, and past mistakes, which at moments, borders on the profound.

Although some comment that the premise of her not recognizing her husband after twenty years and several physical changes is implausible, I know from experience that it could happen.

459698,5,6302413419,"This gem was completely unknown to me until a couple of hours ago. And, yes, as other reviewers have noted, the plot is absurd, Orson Wells delivering a restrained, modulated performance is improbable. Yet there are so many thematic threads running through this otherwise contrived and emotionally manipulative tear jerker I couldn't help feeling constantly on edge and involved.

When you strip away the maudlin bits and dated attitudes toward war and military service, there is something timeless and profound at the core of this film. It's a hidden masterpiece.",1441238400,3,564,5.266666666666667

People of noble-character demonstrating: civility even in rebellion, dignity vs uncouth, selfless love despite loss, and generosity over personal gain to help foreigners attain better lives.  These types of movies promote the best in humans .... something to aspire to.  It left you pondering the good in people.  I liked it",1440979200,2,455,5.550724637681159
459701,5,6302413419,What a marvelous story and such an ending!,1440633600,,42,4.375
459702,5,6302413419,"This film, based on the novel by Gwen Bristow (one of my all-time favorite authors), isn't shown much on television. And thats a real shame, because its so very good and a real tearjerker.

The story revolves around Elizabeth MacDonald Hamilton, a young widow who is forced to move on with her life after the death of her husband in WWI. Fast forward 20 years: Shes now happily remarried and raising two sons with her second husband (who happens to be both kind and uber wealthynaturally!). The older boy, who is eager to go off and fight in WWII, is her son by her first husband, although he is unaware of his mothers first marriage or that the man raising him is not his biological father. Then one day, a scientist from Vienna comes into their lives. Elizabeth appears to have put the past behind her, but this man begins to stir up long-repressed feelings about her first husband and the sweet love they once shared. Could this mysterious stranger be someone other than he claims to be?

Im only giving this 4 stars because, in my opinion, Orson Welles is terribly miscast in this film. Even for a melodrama like this, hes much too theatrical. He also sports a really bad makeup job throughout much of the story that is supposed to make him look frail and sickly; instead, its just distracting. Claudette Colbert, on the other hand, despite having to recite some bad dialogue, is absolutely sublime in the role of Elizabeth. She gives the role a depth and substance and elegance that I cant imagine any other actress could equal. It's a performance you won't easily forget. Also quite good are a young Richard Long, as the older son; George Brent as husband #2 (a somewhat thankless role); and a very young Natalie Wood (pre-""A Miracle on 34th Street""), who almost steals the show.

This is very soapy and melodramatic, but nonetheless a really great movie. The film's messageappreciate the life you have right now because yesterday is gone, never to be recapturedis powerful and surprisingly unsentimental.",1440460800,,2011,4.74

A very odd thing, though. I read a review that stated that the Orson Welles character had amnesia -- despite a critical conversation in which he tells his German surgeon that he'd prefer his wife think him dead than give her back a broken, ill man. The film is, rather, about a man who believes his wife will be better off without him, and that we can never recapture the past but must live for tomorrow because ""tomorrow is forever.""

459890,5,6302413419,"Tomorrow Is Forever is one of the finest movies Ive ever seen. The actors give excellent, convincing performances. In addition, the choreography and cinematography reflect good forethought and the use of lighting greatly helps to enhance the mood of each and every scene as well as emotions on the characters faces. The sets are detailed and the musical score enhances the film, too. I should add that this is quite an emotional moviekeep a box of tissues handy in case you're the type who sheds a tear or two while watching a most poignant and meaningful film that is somewhat melancholy! And how this film deals with self-sacrifice on the part of a war veteran so the people he loves can live the best lives he thinks they possibly can!

When the action starts, we meet young John Andrew MacDonald (Orson Welles) and his new wife Elizabeth (Claudette Colbert) in Baltimore; they are newlyweds but much to the chagrin of Elizabeth they must say good-bye, John wants to fight in World War One. Unfortunately, John is badly wounded in combat. When John is found and taken to a hospital where the kindly Dr. Ludwig (John Wengraf) takes care of him, John has no papers on him and he refuses to tell Dr. Ludwig his real identity; John loves Elizabeth so much that he cannot bear to make her go through life with him being so badly maimed from his wounds. John even begs Dr. Ludwig to let him die but Dr. Ludwig refuses! Thus Elizabeth gets a telegram on Armistice Day that John was killed a few days before the war ended and the stress is too much for her to bear; she faints and is taken to the home of her boss, Lawrence Hamilton (George Brent) where she can recover. Eventually Elizabeth, who is pregnant with Johns baby and who thinks shes a war widow, marries Lawrence who loves her even though both Lawrence and Elizabeth know that Elizabeth will never love another man the way she loved John. Elizabeth and Lawrence raise John Andrew MacDonald, Jr. as their own son and they never tell John Jr. (who goes by Drew as he gets older) that Lawrence really isn't his father. Lawrence and Elizabeth eventually have a son of their own, too.

Quite a few years passand as Germany is getting ready to invade Poland and start World War Two, John Andrew, now going by the name of Erik Kessler and trained in Europe as a scientist, arrives in New York along with Margaret (a very young Natalie Wood), the orphaned daughter of Dr. Ludwig and his wife (Ludwig and his wife were killed by Germans who didn't like Ludwigs politics). Together Erik and Margaret make their way to Baltimore where Erik gets a job by chance working for Lawrence Hamilton! It isn't long before Erik and Elizabeth meet; Erik recognizes Elizabeth immediately and he has quite an emotional reactionthe look of shock and the many other emotions all at once on his face is worth the price of admission alone! Elizabeth begins to suspect something isn't quite right about Eriks background; could he actually be her first husband John Andrew MacDonald? Erik denies this but Elizabeth isn't so sure. More trouble ensues when twenty year old Drew wants to go to Canada to join the RAFElizabeth is petrified to let him go because she thinks she lost John during World War One.

Of course theres more to the plot than just this and Ill stop here to avoid giving out spoilers! Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how everything plays out.

Richard Long is terrific as Drew Hamilton. Lucile Watson plays Aunt Jessica; Sonny Howe plays Drews younger brother Brian and Ian Wolfe plays Norton. Joyce Mackenzie is also well cast as Cherry Davis.

Tomorrow is Forever is one of the best films to ever come out of Hollywood. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who appreciate five star quality dramas and even film-noir will not be disappointed.",1395964800,2,3839,4.6149341142020495

459965,5,6302413419,"A brief review of the movie: Tomorrow Is Forever.

 I had lost track of this movie, even lost the title, until a recent showing on TV brought it to life.  When I searched for it, I inevitably ran into the movie Since You Went Away. Both of these movies are outstanding.

Tomorrow Is Forever tells the story of a married soldier, John  (Orson Welles), in WWI, returning after years away due to battle injuries and extensive facial surgery. Before he leaves Germany he adopts the eight year old daughter (Natalie Wood) of the surgeon who saved his life, but was soon killed by the emerging Nazis. His wife, Elizabeth (Claudette Colbert), had been told he was dead, and at some point down the road she has married someone else. When Orson Welles contacted Elizabeth, and her new family, he kept his past to himself. This was an incredibly difficult task, but he pulled it off.

This movie starts with WWI and ends at the start of WWII. Elizabeths son, and many of his school friends, are sold on the idea to travel to Canada and enroll in the Royal Air Force (RAF). As one who is writing a book on these two wars this coverage is of particular interest. One of my uncles enrolled in the RAF as Canada did not have an air corp in 1939 -1940 period. This movie ends with Welles deciding not to reveal his true identity. This was also an incredibly difficult task, but he pulled it off. Many believe that Welles, in particular in this star studded movie, should have received an Oscar for his efforts.",1387152000,,1495,4.477941176470588

And the scene where Orson talks to the young and handsome Richard Long and figures that Richard is really Orson's son is very effective. It makes me cry right now! And when Orson goes after Richard in the rain to the train station to bring Richard back to his mother, and Richard snaps, ""You can't tell me what to do; you're NOT MY FATHER!""
 TOMORROW IS FOREVER is in black and white,and takes me right back to my early '40's childhood. That unbelievable time of late '30's, early '40's, the horrible War years.

More than any other effort, Tomorrow Is Forever has Welles as a gentle soul tormented by war and what might have been.
Claudette Colbert is the one who tries to repair his damaged past.

459990,5,6302413419,"I first saw this film when it was released in 1946 and have never forgotten it.  Perhaps it made such a lasting impression on my youthful mind simply because of the war, but I'm sure much of it was due to the film's intriguing plot and the fascinating interplay between the film's two main characters: played by Orson Wells and Claudette Colbert.

The film is set in the mid to late 1930s, sometime before the United States was drawn into World War II and plays on the fact that a generation had passed between the end of World War One and the beginning of the Second World War; enough time for a young man born at the end of the first war to `almost' be of an age to fight in the next one.  And that is the nub of this story.  For, as those old enough to remember will surely recall: Although America wasn't in the war at that time, many young men in their late teens opted to leave college and join either England's Royal Air Force (RAF) or the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in order to fight the Nazis.

In this film, Claudette Colbert's son is just such a fellow, and since she believes her husband to have been killed in the first Great War she was terrified at the thought of also losing her son to the next one.  Then, unbeknownst to her; her crippled husband with a heavy foreign accent suddenly returns from Germany along with his supposed daughter: played by Natalie Woods in her first important role.  The scene is thus set for a dramatic, intriguing and, in my case, an unforgettable film.

Orson Wells described it as a ""trivial little thing,"" but I beg to differ, and I think you will too; especially if you love movies with well-thought-out plots, fascinating characters, and intriguing dialog.  If you do, you'll certainly enjoy this one.  As for me, I'm still trying to figure out if Claudette Colbert's character ever fully realized that Wells' character was in fact her long-lost husband.

I had a problem with Orson Welles as the romantic lead - the young husband off to war,etc.  I just didn't think he fit the part but maybe I've seen him in too many other roles very different from this.  Also, I thought there just wasn't enough difference in his appearance when he returned for her not to know him especially after being around him for a while and listening to him talk. Voices always give it away even with some sort of accent added. His voice was very much the same. I expected her to suspect that it was him from the very first time she saw him. But maybe 20 years does dim the memory a lot.  All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone who loves old B&W dramatic movies.

She was also one of my Aunt's favorites as well.

460036,5,6302413419,"""Tomorrow is Forever"" is a post war melodrama about the impact of war on people's lives. It was based on a 1944 novel by Gwen Bristow. This type of film was popular in the 40s, the most famous of which include ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946) and ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), although this film is much more than a simple anti-war film about the disruptive effects of war.

In this 1946 black and white film, Orson Welles plays a married man who is killed during World War 1 and his widow Claudette Colbert remarries (George Brent), but Welles was merely wounded and when he finally recovers, years later, he returns to find out his former wife had his child, now being raised as Brent's own son (Richard Long in his film debut). To make matters worse, Long wants to enlist in the RAF much to the opposition of Colbert who believes she lost her husband in the first war.

FWIW - Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem ""Enoch Arden"" (1864) is the exemplar from which these kinds of films evolved, although one can find the roots ultimately in the tale of Odysseus. Other films to use this theme include the screwball comedy ""My Favorite Wife"" (1941) as well as ""Remember the Day"" (1941) and ""The Man From Yesterday"" (1932) both of which starred Colbert. More recently Tom Hanks' ""Cast Away"" (2000) is another variation on the theme.

Orson Welles (1915-85) created some of the very best theatre, radio, and films in history, and is credited by almost everyone for making the #1 film of all time - ""Citizen Kane"" (1941). But someone along the line, early on, he started having problems with producers and studios, left projects unfinished, went over budget, and a whole host of problems that ultimately resulted in fewer and fewer films of lesser and lesser quality. By 1946, when this film was made, Welles was already in trouble and exhibiting many of the problems that would unhinge his career. But in this film he gives one of his finest performances and it's really good to watch.

BTW - Welles was one of the finest actors to ever appear, so watching one of his finest performances is watching the best of the very best.

Claudette Colbert (1903-96) won the Oscar in 1934 for ""It Happened One Night"" and was nominated in 1936 (Private Worlds"") and 1945 (""Since You Went Away""). In 1987 she won the Golden Globe for a TV show ""The Two Mrs. Grenvilles"", her last film. In her 50 years of performing, she made more than 50 films, though 35 of them were in the 30s and included such memorable films as ""Cleopatra"" (1934), ""Under Two Flags"" (1936), and ""Drums Along the Mohawk"" (1939). She is the real star of this film and her performance is excellent.

George Brent (1899-1979) is best known as the frequent co-star with Bette Davis in 13 films although he was also very close with Garbo. His memorable films include ""Jezebel"" (1938), ""Dark Victory"" (1939), and ""The Spiral Staircase"" (1945).

This was the third film for child star Natalie Wood (1938-81) who would achieve her breakout in ""Miracle on 47th Street"" (1947) and go on to be nominated for an Oscar 3 times (""Rebel without a Cause"", ""Splendor in the Grass"", ""Love with the Proper Stranger""). Wood plays a little girl adopted by Welles during his stint in Europe.

FWIW - Welles and Wood had a real bond, which you can plainly see on film. Welles said she was ""so good she was terrifying"" and Wood said ""I found him most kind.""

Irving Pichel (1891-1954) directs. He was an actor (70+ films) and director (30+ films) who is best known for this film and for ""The Pied Piper"" (1942) and ""A Medal for Benny"" (1945). He cast Wood in her first film, ""Happy Land"" (1943) and he came up with her theatre name, giving her the name ""Wood"" as a token to his good friend Sam Wood.

Austrian composer Max Steiner (1888-1971) does a great job in this tear jerker. Between 1935 and 1956 he was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Now Voyager"" (1942), and ""The Informer"" (1935). He was so well known that he appeared on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.

In 1946 the biggest hits were ""Song of the South"", ""Duel in the Sun"", ""The Best Years of our Lives"", ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", and ""Blue Skies"". The big Oscar winner was ""The Best Years of our Lives"" (Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor). Other notable films were Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"", Bogart and Bacall in ""The Big Sleep"", Burt Lancaster in ""The Killers"", and ""The Yearling"". Very few war films came out in 1946.

The NY Times' caustic Bosley Crowther called it ""a straight piece of Hollywood taffy, slightly saline and gooey clear through."" In lesser hands, this film might have been a melodrama, but with the great performances of Welles, Colbert, Brent, and even Wood, it achieves a much higher level.

By today's tastes the film may seem overly romantic and sometimes even preachy, but by the standards of the mid 40s it isn't. In addition, contemporary viewers may find the plot a little far-fetched - how would a woman not recognize her husband, even after war and even after 20 years? The fact is, in the past, wars dramatically changed people's appearance, not only due to the injuries but also the poor medical care, poor aftercare, presence of all sorts of post traumatic diseases, and even more telling, the impact of malnutrition.

So, put aside the 40s melodramatic feel of the film and put aside your skepticism about the ravages of war, and just sit back and watch a truly inspiring films with great performances.",1311120000,2,5532,4.637385086823289
460037,5,6302413419,"Orson Wells and Claudette Colbert were at the top of their game in this unbearably touching film.  Irving Pichel's direction is spot on.  And the story is as pleasingly melodramatic as is possible.  I cannot recommend this film more highly.

HOWEVER...

The studio releasing this DVD has got a lot of chutzpah gouging the public by charging such an outlandish price for a 70-year-oild film that has fallen through the cracks of time.

As such, there isn't a snowball's chance in Key West that I will purchase this DVD, unless the studio drops it to a price appropriate to the product.

Story-wise,  I doubt many people could have done what Orson Welles' character did in this film. Welles, by the way, is outstanding in here. He, Claudette Colbert, George Brent and Richard Long provide some wonderful acting.

Long, playing the elder son, presents a tremendous contrast of how a young man acted back in the 1940s compared to nowadays in terms of of respect and manners. The little girl in here is played by Natalie Wood. She has blonde hair and is about five or six years old, and does an impressive job speaking German.

This is a real heart-rendering story. The only drawback is the credibility of Colbert's character, ""Elizabeth Hamilton,"" the wife of Welles. (I can't say why without spoiling the story.)

460040,3,6302413419,"In its review of TOMORROW IS FOREVER (1946), Videohound's Golden Movie Retriever states ""This slow-moving melodrama wastes a good cast.""
I thought it was better than that, but not by much.

I should state that I like to watch anything that has Orson Welles in it.  For example, even though THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI (1947) is hampered by his attempt at a brogue, it too is also rewatchable.

Here Welles plays a husband who returns from WWI, supposedly disfigured beyond recognition; and really all that has changed is he limps, has an injured hand, and has grown a beard.  His wife, played by Claudette Colbert, is completely fooled; but the viewer may find this stretches their suspension of disbelief to its limits.

And that would be all right in itself, but the plot centers on Welles' ability to make Colbert believe he is not her husband; and he tries to convince her that her instinct is wrong; and that her suspicion is nothing more than wishful thinking about the past.

Regarding the film's construction, I thought it well put together, with a highlight being Max Steiner's music.  If it had any weakness, Colbert's insistence on having herself shot on the same side of her face, (and at the same angle) becomes a little repetitive; because there are many close-ups in this picture.  This lack of cinematographic variety may make all but the most ardent Colbert fan wonder.

Still, if you appreciate Orson Welles, Claudette Colbert, or 1940s melodrama, it is not to be missed.  If you have a taste for them all, this may likely become a favorite film.",1233619200,6,1559,4.762081784386617

460073,4,6302413419,"Despite the movie's Harlequin-level romance novel title, the unlikely pairing of classic Hollywood leading lady Claudette Colbert and resident bad-boy Orson Welles actually works in this intriguing albeit far-fetched 1946 melodrama directed by the relatively undistinguished Irving Pichel. Written by Lenore J. Coffee, the plot concentrates initially on newly married John and Elizabeth McDonald, who are suddenly separated when he enlists for combat duty during WWI. Just as she discovers she is pregnant, Elizabeth receives word that John is dead, but the truth is that he is so badly injured that he doesn't want to return to her as a cripple. Once recovered, he takes on the guise of an Austrian scientist named Erik Kessler. Twenty years elapse, and Elizabeth has remarried to businessman Larry Hamilton, who has coincidentally recruited Kessler to test the company's new product formula. Elizabeth meets Kessler but does not recognize him to be her long lost John due to plastic surgery. However, John knows her, and they become intertwined again when their son Drew decides to enlist in the RAF years before the U.S. enters WWII.

The story sounds preposterous on paper, but it is quite compelling to see the movie evolve toward its inevitable resolution. Colbert is her naturally effervescent self, though she is well into her forties here and a mite too mature for the early scenes when she is playing a blushing newlywed to the twelve-years younger Welles. Nonetheless, she provides surprising bite to the scenes where Elizabeth confronts her own prejudices about war. In the juiciest role, Welles has a field day as the crippled, defeated Kessler as he keeps his naturally grandiose manner in check. Perennial also-ran George Brent is wooden as expected as Hamilton, but a couple of familiar faces shine as the children - Richard Long as the grown Drew and an eight-year old Natalie Wood, blonde and sporting a convincing Austrian accent, as Kessler's adopted daughter Margaret. There are some lapses in credibility beginning with Elizabeth's inability to recognize John and ending with her rather sudden resignation that John is right in his perspective on the past. Regardless, it's a surprisingly involving movie with a mature perspective on love and war, a curio sadly forgotten today and well worth a look now.",1161043200,22,2326,5.2026666666666666

Claudette Colbert shows why she was one of the top female actresses of her era and beyond. Dialogue a bit overdone in one or two places, but the rest of the film and Welles are so excellent this minor flaw is easy to forgive.

460075,5,6302413419,"One of the most emotion-wrenching movies I've seen in years is ""Tomorrow is Forever"".  The only thing I can compare it to is ""Random Harvest"" which was another highly emotional movie about love detoured by a WWI battle injury.  Frankly, I'm not sure I could handle much more emotional tension that what these movies bring to the screen.  In the case of ""Tomorrow is Forever"" we see the story of a happily married man who goes off to war promising his beloved wife that he will return.  We next see him in a German military hospital, face covered with bandages, wanting to die due to the extremity of his wounds.  The wife back home gets a killed in action letter and eventually remarries and begins a new life.  Obviously, the story reunites wife 1 with husband 1 and that is the core of the movie.  This whole scenario is brilliantly set up.  Sure, it's next to impossible.  However, it's so skillfully done that we don't care to disparage the results.  This aspect of the film is what sets it (and ""Random Harvest"" as well) apart from all the other Bette-Davis-soap-opera style, tear-jerkers of the past and present.

As the movie reaches its' climax, we have created our own preferred outcomes.  In the end, we are left with (we reluctantly admit) the correct resolution to the dilemna.  We are convinced by the writer, the director, and the awesome acting by Orson Welles and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Claudette Colbert.  The scenes involving these two are taut with emotion and the dialogue is worthy of Welles's talent.  The film's title carries a meaning that is only truly understood after watching the movie.

The central theme of this beautiful story is that to live in the present and for the future we often must let go of our past.  Here a woman, having lost her husband in one war, let her fear and dispair live for 19 years resulting in her reluctance to support her son in his honorable committment to help suppress the Nazi takeover of Europe and eventually the world.  But, the story is not about war, rather it concerns the emotional battles between love, remorse, and bitterness that go on inside the human mind. One thing not mentioned in other reviews is the musical score which blends more perfectly with the story than any of other films of this genre and it carries the emotional feeling of the story so well that it is almost invisible as music.

I  borrowed it from her VHS  collection. Later I decided to get my own on dvd. Even my husband who sometimes frowns on black and white movies Luvs it.",1520035200,,293,4.509433962264151

7825294,5,6302413419,"One of the best Claudette Colbert movies ever.  Orson Wells is subtly effective in his roll.  George Brent was the best in his support roll.  The story line is great and a real tear-jerker at the end.  Not your usual war-time movie.  It left me feeling like the story was complete without need for a sequel. Why this movie was never advertised more, is a mystery.",1517702400,,363,4.4393939393939394
