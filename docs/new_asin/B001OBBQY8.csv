8330149,5,B001OBBQY8,"This DVD is a collection of classic animated shorts that were made in Japan in the 1930's and one more that was made in the 1940's.  This DVD short collection also comes with a very informative booklet that gives historical information on each of the shorts.  The shorts on this collection are a mix of shorts about Japanese myths and fairy tails, about the changing of the season, a music video for a 1930's Japanese child singer, and a World war 2 propaganda short.  The prints used for the DVD are very good.  My one criticism would be that they should of used a color different than White for the subtitles.  The White Subtitles become invisible when they are against a White background.  Anime like these typically don't get released in the west so this collection is a real treat for fans of anime and history.",1333756800,4,816,4.554794520547945
