8119886,5,B000FBC6OW,"This version is a SHAW BROTHERS.  I would give it a 4 to 5 star.  I saw it on the EL RAY SHAW BROTHERS library showing late at night.  The fighting in it is intense.  Some Shaw brothers are slower moving than others.  This one moves along quickly with a lot of moves that you want to get up off the couch and hit the pause button and try or really look at.  It was funny and one of the few that showed nudity.  It was good and I actually began to smile near the end as the student who learned under 2 masters improves (yes you get to learn from 2 masters here) so studying is good on this and some little tid-bits of practical insight.  The student must fight the 3 evils.  The fighting also here with the 3 evils gets intense, mixed in with some silly humor from the lesser students who bully the student who takes 2 masters.  But it is beautiful to watch with others like Shaolin Abbot I really liked and had to look up special on information to learn that many movie titles have CHANGED NAMES.  I really liked this movie and went to bed having dreams about martial arts.  That is a bonus when you go to bed dreaming about Kung Fu and the moves.  This Shaw Brothers movie deserves viewing and worth a shot for a great time. I bought this movie for under $8.00 too! A GREAT TIME!",1420848000,,1280,4.112903225806452

I'm expecting The Master that is shown above and actually received The Master starring Jet Li, a whole different cover face...
I was very disappointed. I did not return the movie due to how inconvenient the procedure was...
I may now look into purchasing movies at video stores...that way i know I'm at least purchasing the right one.",1232668800,,404,4.785714285714286
