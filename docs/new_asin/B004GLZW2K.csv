8428843,5,B004GLZW2K,My girls 21 & 15  were very impressed on Nick's out look on life! My only regret is that I never came across NIck's message when they were going through being bullied while in middle school & that one of their peers could have not committed suicide. As an educator I wish that I could no for surethat  my students are getting the best start in their preschool experience that will carry over into their whole educational journey. I know I love what I do & I know that I love learning. I am a life long learner but Do I Give That Joy To ALL MY STUDENTS?? I hope so!,1437955200,,564,4.072072072072072

8428845,5,B004GLZW2K,The story of Nick Vujicic is one that every young person should see (and probably most old people as well).,1380844800,2,107,4.4
8428846,5,B004GLZW2K,"Nick makes you fell that you are capable of anything  you want to do.  When he says you certainly can believe it.
I feel like I would like to watch this over and over.  What an inspiration!  I believe his message is so valuable and should be heard by people of all ages.",1370736000,5,270,4.037735849056604
8428847,3,B004GLZW2K,I purchased this to show our youth group. I had hopes that it would be impacting. I was disappointed. It was more a documentary of him and his life rather than time spent on the message that he carries to the youth. What I really wanted was to see the powerful message he brings to youth....it left me wanting.,1368144000,5,310,4.271186440677966
8428848,3,B004GLZW2K,"I orderd the dvd, because I like Nick's story.  It is a real-life inspiration which I knew already from the book and online video clips. Nervertheless the package and design of the DVD looks like a cheap copy without description and  for the price a little disappointing.",1364860800,2,271,4.74468085106383
8428849,4,B004GLZW2K,"Nick continues to be an inspiration for many.  His message of joy, gratitude and faith in adversity is one that has benefited me.  If you aren't familar with his work check out his web-site and his video segments on you.tube. This video has an almost self-produced quality to it - however the message come accross loud and clear.  I would recommend it for anyone.",1317340800,14,363,4.640625
8428850,5,B004GLZW2K,This man is a great inspiration to us all.  He is just amazing and there would be less suicides among young people if they could only follow his example. It made me realise that I have nothing to complain about and my aches and pains are trivial.  Nick's beautiful smile says it all!,1310601600,16,283,4.320754716981132
