940303,5,6304908083,"I loved this movie, not least because my dad used to read the comic strip to my brother and me when we were very young. It's a captivating fantasy, and the movie is light-hearted and beautifully done. Still, I'd suggest waiting for the DVD, mostly because $80 for VHS these days is absurd.",986601600,9,289,4.471698113207547
940304,5,6304908083,I liked it because it had humore in it and romance and lots and lots of adventure!  now those are almost hard to find I thought it wouldn't be too good BUT I WAS WRONG and I think a lot of other people would like this  movie too. So order it right now and I think you'll like it.,952560000,2,279,3.711864406779661
940305,5,6304908083,"While the movie may not be the most accurate movie (i.e. armored alligators), this movie is definitely one of the best I've seen in a while. It is an excellent blend of action and fantasy, and both Moyer and Heigl  give excellent performances. I can't say that I followed the strip before  now, but after seeing the movie I try to pick up the comics and search it  out.",949536000,,369,4.318840579710145
940306,4,6304908083,"I liked this video very much. Stephen Moyer plays Val perfectly. I've read the books (I loved them) and he was just like I imagined Valiant. The part of the princess was also very well done by Katherine Heigl. My only  dissapointment was that in the comic strip Val's great love was Aleta, the  beautiful heroine who with her charm and witt conquered all hearts,  including Val's. I wish the lead female role would have been hers. Of  course the first movie had to explain how  Val came to be a knight. I hope  the film company will make another one. Pitty that Katherine can't play  Aleta because she would have been a great Aleta. Thank you so much for  making a life long dream of seeing these caracters on screen a reality.  GREAT MOVIE.",944524800,4,741,4.42962962962963
940307,4,6304908083,"...and this film does.  when one takes into account the fact that it is based upon a comic strip concerning a character living in Arthurian England the movie becomes more enjoyable - it isn't supposed to be realistic, it's  supposed to be fantasy.  some of the previous review writers seem like  people who would say ""yeah, right!"" while watching the bicylcle  fly in front of the moon in ""E.T.""  they need to concentrate on  watching documentaries instead of fantasy/adventure films.  the fact is:  the sword fights were exciting, the women were beautiful, the heroes were  noble...it was fun to watch.",939513600,,603,4.94

7879534,3,6304908083,"Villainy, jousting, swordplay, a princess in peril, an unknowing prince on a quest, and all in the shadow of Excalibur: what more could the average ten year old would-be Knight ask for?

Set in the days of Round Table chivalry, this is the comic book tale of the orphan and page Valiant (stephen Moyer) who, due to a case of mistaken identity, is escorting a princess (Katherine Heigl) to her fiance when Excalibur is stolen from King Arthur (Edward Fox) by his evil stepsister Morgan Le Fey (Joanne Lumley) and two warring brothers (Udo Kier, Thomas Kretchsmann) from an enemy Kingdom. Valiant and the princess become part of the struggle of ""he who holds the sword rules the world"" which leads them both to love and Valiant to his princely destiny.

This is an okay rainy afternoon movie that is definitely geared toward a young audience. The acting is decent enough, the jousting is done well, and the swordplay isn't bad. Occasionally a scene will fade into a cartoon comic book sequence with voice over. Stunt work is kind of lame and there is this dumb armored alligator effect. Over all, kids will get a kick out of it (and adults will groan-laugh).

Ron Perlman has the supporting role of Boltar, who at first appears to be a lecherous ogre but turns out to be the key to Valiant's past and future, and he does his usual fine job.

Worth a rent/buy used for the kids.",1106006400,4,1375,4.5772357723577235
7879535,4,6304908083,"It often seems that the genre of the B movie is a lost art in this age of CGI and massively budgeted films. Yet out of the digital free for all comes Prince Valiant, a movie which harkens back to movies like Excalibur in its style and never takes itself seriously in its substance.

Valiant is a young knight who is in charge of protecting a lovely princess. To complicate matters, Excalibur has been stolen by vikings and Morgan Le Fey needs someone of royal birth to dislodge it from the stone it has become trapped in, making Valiant the best candidate, unbeknownst to him. Add to this a dwarf, a viking harem, and some really cheesy effects and you have Prince Valiant.

Perhaps what keeps this movie from being a waste of celluloid is the fact that it's fun to watch. Some of the plot devices are laughable, such as a dwarf being catapulted over a tower, a feministic princess, and Chinese fireworks in the viking palace for some reason. Yet in spite of everything, the movie is able to be cheesy and entertaining at the same time. Stephen Moyer actually isn't a bad prince, though his accent comes and goes while Katherine Heigel doesn't even bother with the accent at all.

While it's laughable, it's still entertaining, which is something that makes Prince Valiant memorable in the normally bland mix of sword and armor movies.",1097020800,12,1335,4.624472573839663
7879536,3,6304908083,"My wife and I were in the mood for a good adventure film so we watched Prince Valiant.  This movie is a sort of prequel to the popular comic strip that has been running since my father was young.
The movie begins with Valiant being the squire of Sir Gawain during a tournament at Camelot.  When Gawain is unseated and knocked out Valiant disguises himself in Gawain's armor and all but wins the tournament.  he would have won except that Vikings had entered Camelot and stolen Excalibur.  The Vikings have left evidence to make it look like the Scotts have committed the crime.  Thus most of Britain's armies proceed North while Valiant, still disguised as Gawain, escorts a princess back to Wales.
Morgan Le Fey, who is behind the Viking raid on Camelot, uses her magic to discover who can pull Excalibur from a stone in which it has found itself.  She sees a vision of Valiant in Gawain's armor and a raid is planned to capture Gawain.  When Gawain fails at pulling the sword he is killed.  It is now up to Valiant to regain Excalibur.  It turns out that Valiant is heir to the Viking throne as he is the last surviving member of the Red Stallion Clan.  Valiant gets Excalibur, rescues the princess (who dies and is brought back to life by Excalibur), returns Excalibur to Arthur and asks for the princess's hand in marriage.  Valiant then joins Arthur as a knight of the Round Table.  This then sets the stage for the comic strip.
What is strange is that Prince Valiant never knew he was a prince.  When he learns of his heritage, he is actually a king.  It all means that he never actually gets to be known as ""Prince"" Valiant (although he is called ""Prince"" by the other knights even though he is a king).  Also, when the princess is dying, Valiant challenges God to save her or make a new enemy.  It is Excalibur, powered by the gods of Avalon, that responds.  Prince Valiant is a fun adventure movie but one that really makes no sense whatsoever.  However, if you are looking for adventure, this movie will fit the bill.",1087344000,7,2027,4.476839237057221
