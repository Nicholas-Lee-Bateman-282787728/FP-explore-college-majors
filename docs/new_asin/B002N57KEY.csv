3955295,3,B002N57KEY,"When Tiger Stadium was closing I went on a baseball stadium kick. This is one of the videos I purchased. It was decent. It gave you the nuts and bolts of each stadium presented. It didn't tell me anything I didn't know about Tiger Stadium. If you get it, you'll probably watch it once, maybe a second time 10 years later after you forgot you had it, but I doubt you'll watch it more than that. Entertaining enough to see it once, probably not much more value beyond that. I would've given it 2 1/2 stars if that was possible.",1325894400,,525,4.26
3955296,3,B002N57KEY,good information about each ballpark but dated in the presentation even though it was just released in 2009 - it had to be filmed in the late 80s when Comiskey and Tiger Stadium were still open. Each segment is about 20 minutes and provides a decent summary and inoformation about each of the 4 parks.,1275782400,3,301,4.490909090909091

3955300,4,B002N57KEY,"Take me out to the ballgame..........this roughly 60 minute program goes by way too fast if you are a die hard baseball fan.  While most of us tend to romanticize baseball's ""good ole days"" focusing on the players, one comes away with a new understanding of how a ball park, can shape a team's personality and that as one person mentions.....""today's ballparks are pretty much the same"".

He may very well be right as several nuances are pointed out like Boston's ""Green Monster"", but also all of the sharp angles that allowed the ball to ""bounce"" around in the outfield in order to allow players to get an extra base.

Or how at the old Detroit Tiger's stadium (changed names many times), how the infield was designed in such a way as to allow Ty Cobb every advantage when ever he tried to lay down a bunt.

For some, this DVD may seem dated (and it is) but it's a forgivable shortcoming as most of the ball parks in this program have been torn down with the exception of Boston's Fenway Park and Chicago's Wrigley Field.  It's nice to see these two ballparks the way they ""used to be"".

An added bonus are interviews with some of the ""greats"" of yesteryear.  My personal favorite:  ""Mr. Cub""...Ernie Banks.",1399852800,,1208,4.534562211981567
3955301,5,B002N57KEY,The dvd arrived on time and in the condition promised.  It traced the history of four or five old major league ballparks.  I was very satisfied.,1391385600,,144,4.5
3955302,5,B002N57KEY,This view of the venerable old ball parks of my youth was very informative and a nostalgic trip for me. The use of old film and some of the players of the day (Ted Williams) was super.,1387411200,,184,4.0
3955303,4,B002N57KEY,"Older images of the  parks bring back a lot a  of memories; especially old Comiskey in Chicago.
A great show!",1373760000,,109,4.4
3955304,5,B002N57KEY,This was a gift for my brother for a birthday......our family has always been fans of the boys of summer!  And this was a great gift and something we have all be able to watch and enjoy.,1366761600,,186,4.027027027027027
3955305,4,B002N57KEY,"Jeff Daniels did a fine job narrating the histories of Fenway Park in Boston, Briggs Stadium (Tiger Stadium) in Detroit, Wrigley
Field and Comiskey Park in Chicago.  I enjoyed it very much.  It reminded me of an earlier presentation of ""Once There Was
A Ballpark"" narrated by Martin Sheen which covered a history of many ballparks.  I have it on VHS.  I don't think that it was
ever released on DVD.  I recommend America's Classic Ballparks for anyone with an interest in these fabled ballparks.",1365465600,4,495,4.776470588235294
3955306,4,B002N57KEY,"I like Jeff Daniels so his narration here was an added plus.  I primarily bought this to see the segment on Tiger Stadium, the former Briggs Stadium that I grew up attending as a boy in Detroit.  Memories and all that.",1363564800,,218,4.2926829268292686

8374567,5,B002N57KEY,"Bought this as a Christmas gift, and the recipient loved it.  Product came as advertised and in mint condition.  Overall, very satisfied and would purchase again from this seller.",1519430400,,179,5.137931034482759
8374568,5,B002N57KEY,I gave this to an uncle as a gift and he very much enjoyed it.,1514937600,,62,3.2
8374569,5,B002N57KEY,It was great to see these four ballparks especially Wrigley and Comiskey since I live just outside Chicago and enjoy watching both teams.,1494806400,,137,5.0
8374570,5,B002N57KEY,Excellent baseball classic.,1485475200,,27,8.333333333333334
8374571,5,B002N57KEY,"Absolutely love this DVD.  I had the VHS tape from around 1988/1989 and love the updated version.  This was filled around 1989 after it was decided to tear down Comiskey Park.  Later Tiger Stadium was torn down which only leaves 2 of the classics.  I watch this every February right before Spring Training starts to get the juices flowing for another season.  As a die hard Cubs fan and love of stadiums from all sports (seen 41 different baseball stadiums), this DVD is a must.  The interviews at the end are spot on.  I think it was Tom Boswell who said ""if the stadium needs skyboxes, then build the damn skyboxes"".  Do what it takes to keep the stadium instead of building another one.  Fortunately both Boston and Chicago (cubs) listened.  Really wish I had seen a game at Comiskey.",1480982400,,787,4.557142857142857
8374572,3,B002N57KEY,"The video was good, but there should have been more indepth information provided about each ball park.",1476403200,,102,5.0588235294117645
