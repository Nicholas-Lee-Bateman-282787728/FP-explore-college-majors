I hope more people will see this movie the characters are intriging and very beleavable, if you had friends like these, the world would be a better place.",984873600,4,269,4.1923076923076925
1387065,5,B000051S5P,"If you were a fan of Jon Cryer's when he made all those teen movies, you'll be thrilled to know he is still alive and well - and acting - and doing quite a fine job of it. I think he shines in this film, where he gets to be more than cute and adorable in that quirky way he had - not quite teen movie handsome, just strange. Now he's older and better, in my opinion. I like small, independent movies, not those aimed at mainstream audiences and this story of 3 guys who were childhood friends and one of them who got lost is appealing, if a bit slow at times. It grew on me. By the way, this one IS available in VHS as well, although you'll have to search for it.",983923200,5,663,3.9185185185185185
1387066,3,B000051S5P,"This film starts out pretty strong. The characters are interesting and the plot moves along nicely between flashbacks and the present. The shots of Coney Island during the middle of winter are nice as well. Somewhere after the first hour, however, the film turns from a mostly original comedy to a not-at-all original drama. It seems like the studio got involved, turning it from an independent to a mainstream flick. Nevertheless, I do recommend seeing this movie, if only to keep ""Ducky's"" film career going into the next millennium.",978912000,,535,5.022471910112359
7929369,3,B000051S5P,"Went to Coney Island on a Mission From God Be Back by Five is a 1998 independent film about three best friends growing up in New York City. Beginning with a voiceover from a mature Danny (Jon Cryer, Two and a Half Men), were told how he met his two best childhood friends, Stan (Rick Stear, Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Richie (Rafael Baez, Shanghai Noon).

Most of the film focuses on the friends post-high school graduation life as young adults. Their lives haven't gone the way they had hoped when they were kids. Stan is living with his childhood sweetheart, Gabby (Ione Skye).Born with a disfigured foot, hes unhappy in his current job as pizza parlor employee and has a drinking problem. Timid Danny works as an appraiser for a jewelry store. Hes also unhappy with his job, but is grateful to have it. Richie has had a mental breakdown and disappeared somewhere in Coney Island. His friends believe hes become homeless.

As Stan and Danny search for Richie in a nearly deserted Coney Island in the dead of winter, flashbacks illustrate disappointments in their lives that led to their current dissatisfaction and unhappiness. We also see why the three boys bonded and why the search is like a spiritual odyssey to come to terms with how they can extricate themselves from feeling miserable about life.

Their search turns up a number of unusual characters; most seem more contrived than realistic. Their presence, taken together, is supposed to provide enlightenment about life, the meaning of happiness, and insight into their inner malaise.

Based on a true story, Went to Coney Island is more a series of episodes than a traditional narrative, which is ultimately disappointing, since director Richard Schenkman never blends them into a cohesive whole. Performances are very good, and there are some genuinely funny moments.

Bonus materials on the newly restored Blu-ray release include a new introduction from director Richard Schenkman and actor Jon Cryer; audio commentary from Schenkman and Cryer; behind-the-scenes featurette; The Producer, a comedy short film directed by Richard Schenkman; photo gallery, and original theatrical trailer.",1525910400,,2155,5.110795454545454
7929370,5,B000051S5P,"Well written, well acted, funny and sad at the same time. I enjoy the shots of Coney Island as it appears to be drawing its' final breaths.",1467936000,,139,4.185185185185185
7929371,5,B000051S5P,"If you want a movie of Robot's gone wild this is not your movie. This film is a character study; no I am not in film school. I know... I'm a rare breed in this case, but I feel this film is great. I had it on VHS years ago, now I have it on DVD and has some based on a true story aspects to it. I'd lump this with films like Paulette or Garbo Talks. I almost wish the flashbacks didn't exist; but, it did help build who the characters seen in the film. The film feels as if it is about real people with real challenges, acceptances and I am playing witness to it all. The waitress, skee-ball weasel, photographer, the homeless woman none of them main characters all could have great back stories to themselves. I wish there was a short film for each of them in the extra's. I know first hand how Coney Island is bleak and reflective in winter and like our lives changing faster then we can keep up with. Perfect setting, real characters, add to that a first time moving performance by Rick Stear (Stan). It's not a drama, it's not a comedy. In some ways I feel this is an affirmation of life and how it just moves on.

(spolier) Biggest disappointment - they never really fully turned on the Wonder Wheel lights - maybe that in itself is a message that everything never works out as we expect but there's always a little hope.",1449619200,,1326,4.2
7929372,5,B000051S5P,This is an excellent documentary of best friends and giving a helping hand when one is in trouble.  Well done.,1376524800,,110,4.5
7929373,1,B000051S5P,"it sucks, but you can't watch the regular movie, at least if you get the directors cut version like i did or whatever-not reccomendable..i wanted to see the movie-not them talking over the movies creation..urgh",1316649600,,210,5.0285714285714285
7929374,3,B000051S5P,"This film is perfect for New Yorkers and fans of Coney Island. Although the movie is filmed during Coney's off-season, so there's little activity there, the scenery will still make you nostalgic. Without knowing the plot of the movie, I bought it strictly for its locale, and wasn't disappointed. And this movie will be further appreciated as Coney Island is soon completely re-vamped. As for the story, its a pathetically sad one but very realistic and the acting leaves nothing to be desired.",1313712000,,494,4.963855421686747
7929375,4,B000051S5P,"Jon Cryer is just excellent in this movie and the rest the cast including Rafael Baez, Eugene Byrd, Dominic Chianese, Ione Skye are quite good. The camera work and sets make you feel you are reliving a past trip to this wonderful place. The story centers on two young men hearing that a friend is slumming at the park so they set out to see if it is true and assist them in any way they can. What transpires is sometimes hysterical and sometimes heartwarming. Fans of Cryer shouldn't miss it, and if you like movies that snapshot a bygone era, or movies with a good message, catch it.",1197504000,9,584,4.36697247706422
7929376,4,B000051S5P,"I didn't think it was the strongest movie, but I lived in Coney for 33 years and it hit home. It did remind me of the people and problems of broooklynites. And, though shot in Winter - the most depressing time in Coney, the scenery reminded me of home. I actually used to work in the freak show they went to - too bad they didn't actually use the real performers. Jon Cryer could've been better, but, all-in-all, I enjoyed.",1032739200,,423,4.3
7929377,5,B000051S5P,"Great character studies and atmosphere. Looks like the 80's generation has touched down to the harsh realities of life and living as two friends take a day off their normal existences to hunt down an old buddy who is suppossedly living homeless in Coney Island. The strange,yet so human people they meet while searching and the way they come to terms with themselves is riviting and this is absolutely one of the finest movies I've seen in a really long time. Sorry Fwongo!!",1001289600,6,474,4.72289156626506
7929378,1,B000051S5P,"So there are some brief funny parts near the beginning. Basically the movie started mediocre and rapidly went downhill from there. About two-thirds of the way into the film it hit bottom and apparently started digging. This movie is so horrendously bad that you can't even laugh at it as much as stare in horror. There's almost no plot, just constant droning misery and depression. The movie devoted about a half hour to an extremely boring and drawn-out scene in which the main characters look for their mentally diseased, homeless former friend.
The movie gave me a headache and the soundtrack a stomachache. This is the first film I've seen with disease-like symptoms. I write this about 10 minutes after I watch it, and my head is still pounding. For the sake of your mental health, do not watch this movie. It would be best used as a torture device for government interrogators, though perhaps is too potently bad even for that.",993168000,5,933,4.765432098765432
