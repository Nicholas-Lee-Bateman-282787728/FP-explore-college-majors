8026720,1,B0002DGTGO,"I bought this movie based on reviews I read that gloated about this collection. I think those reviewers don't know what is good or funny. Unfortunately I was disapointed with this collection, and paid $18.00 for it. I didn't even laugh once, and I'm not kidding. And I like to laugh and it doesn't take me much to get there.",1132876800,5,324,4.416666666666667

8026722,5,B0002DGTGO,"I got this DVD 3 years ago, when it first came out.  He sold his DVDs on a street corner in lower Manhattan then - don't know if he still does - but if you get a chance to meet him in person, shake his hand.  He is going to be big.

I still pop the DVD in whenever I have company I want to impress, or when I need a refresher - it is some of the most original, zany, on-point comedy that is out there anywhere, I'm convinced.  Donnelly has that element that is central to so many key artists - Chris Rock is the closest comic I can think of - a way of seeing things that pierces through the gauze fabric of the games we play in day-to-day life.  The work he does leaves me increasingly amazed - its like on the one hand you can't believe anything can be so funny and unexpected, but soon the realization sets in that its so much truer to life than you're even aware of at first.

Get this collection while its ""cold""... so you can say 'I knew him when....'",1116288000,7,956,3.953125
