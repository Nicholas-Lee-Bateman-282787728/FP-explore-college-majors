637004,5,6303394035,This is one of the all-time great movies.  I've watched it a thousand times and it still makes me laugh.  It has both the subtle comedy that draws you in and the out-loud laughs that keep you there.  Whoopi at her  best!,961804800,3,220,4.166666666666667
637005,4,6303394035,"This movie is Whoopi Goldberg at her finest! The movie has hysterical one liners, and it completely captures Whoopi's sense of humor and her comedic style. While some of the plot might seem outdated, the movie as a hole  stands on its own well...Basically, this movie will always be a gas gas  gas!",959040000,,298,4.60377358490566
637006,5,6303394035,"This movie is a masterpiece Cold War comedy. Whoopi Goldberg is wonderful as the computer programmer, who is unsuspectingly brought into the struggle of a British spy. The plot twists wonderfully, and has real quality. Jonathan Pryce's cameo as Jack Flash is great also, as well as his voice.  If you want to see a great, and funny film, as well Penny Marshall's  directorial debut watch this wonderful film",956361600,11,407,4.884057971014493
637007,5,6303394035,"Although this movie is a bit outdated vis-a-vis the Cold War and computer technology, it is still a classic Whoopi movie - filled with lots of laughs and good music - the plot isn't too bad either.",950054400,,197,4.351351351351352
637008,5,6303394035,"I love this movie too like you guys, but I'm REALLY surprised and amazed, to learn that whenever I enjoy a US movie released in France where it is classified for all public, this movie has been restricted for a whole group  of viewers in the US. The point is: what ON EARTH is so shocking in this  funny and delightful movie that may affect a teenager !  Ban GUNS  first before prohibiting comedies !",947462400,3,400,4.293333333333333

637121,3,6303394035,"Lady works at a bank in the 80s on computers transferring funds to international banks. She is interested in computers on the side so she is more than a typist. Her terminal keeps getting interference with Russian TV. And then one day she is chatting with a British intelligence officier who is caught overseas and cannot get back to the US. He has her go the British consulate to get help. They don't help. He has her go to his apt to get other spy's names. The bad guys follow her as they know she was contacted by him and they want to kill him. People get murdered. You watch her navigate all of this spy/intrigue stuff as an ordinary citizen in her efforts to help him.

The problem I had with this movie was it was obviously a vehicle for Whoopi. At this time she was very big and pushed on everyone everywhere from TV to movies to the Oscars. She came across as this adorable lovable funny black lady only to become this raging liberal hate monger after she ""made it"". So I guess part of my reaction here is hindsight is 20-20. Also they were trying to make her white . . . a black lady acting white to me. The ending where the guy runs his finger down her cheek adoring, affectionately . . . just weird. And she doesn't come across very feminine/sexy in this movie (or any I've seen her in actually) so it was almost a force fit. I think the movie would have come across better if there was a different actress. Also why the British intelligence? That is just odd too. And speaking of the actors . . . most were the SNL crowd who were liberal. (You can see a young slim John Lovitz here.) But even back then they couldn't help themselves with their so-called ""funny"" opening news report slamming President Reagan. And then there were two soon to be James Bond actors in this movie as well.",1501459200,,1796,4.297935103244837
637122,5,6303394035,"I consider this my favorite movie of all time.  It has everything, and while not considered a serious movie, Whoopie Goldberg gives her best performance, defining friendship, love, loyalty and decency.",1501200000,,201,5.483870967741935
637123,5,6303394035,"I admit it.  I really, really like this movie.  I watch it every couple of years, and in fact was listening to the radio earlier today and the Stones came on with Jumping Jack Flash. I immediately thought ""I have to watch that movie again"".  For me, it's just pure fun, silliness, decent music and Whoopi Goldberg as she was becoming more visible in films.  She is on point with every line handed to her, and her energy, wit and brashness shine through.  Her supporting actors are excellent in their particular spots.  Sure, it's over-the-top, bad jokes, old repeated situations, a couple of ver\ slightly risque scenes, etc.  It's not Oscar material. But it's fun, it will make you laugh out loud, and come out at the end of the film with a smile on your face.",1500768000,,761,4.510948905109489

I happen to think that suspense/comedy/action is the hardest genre film to carry off . Foul Play and Jumpin Jack Flash are the only films that really make it work.  Whoopi is easy to love as Terry Doolittle (as Goldie Hawn was in Foul Play)  and we are rooting for Terry the whole way thru.

No.  Was it depending on Whoopi to talk her thoughts aloud?  Yes--not the most creative way to push your plot forward. But mostly the movie was lacking diversity.  It was weird, as if the ""token black"" was given the starring role.  Maybe that was the whole idea.  I'm just not sure, but I did love the end.",1412035200,,453,4.385542168674699

638226,4,6303394035,"'Jumpin Jack Flash' is about an unconventional woman named Terry Dolittle (Whoopi Goldberg) who loves movies and music but most importantly, helping people. Terry works at a bank transferring funds and while she enjoys her job her boss is very ""by the book"", he prefers Terry's responses to international clients be brief whereas Terry goes above and beyond to help. Terry is tested and gives into temptation when she's contacted by ""Jack"" who turns Terry's seemingly boring life into a crazy cat and mouse game of espionage.

I just recently saw this movie for the very first time and I have to say that it was the perfect vehicle for Whoopi to showcase her many talents on screen. She's funny, she's relatable and you root for her. There's a lot of physical comedy mixed with dead-pan humor. I didn't know what to expect when I watched this but I'm glad I took the plunge. The movie is also part romantic comedy so there's a little something for everyone. I also feel that this movie is ahead of its time with the early internet use and communication.

This is where I might come into some trouble. I hope nobody takes it the wrong way but I can't help but wonder if Nora Ephron took inspiration from this movie when she made 'Sleepless In Seattle' and 'You've Got Mail' (which is just a remake of 'Sleepless' if you ask me). Both movies are about two people who've never met but interact with each other and wind up together in the end. I don't understand the bad reviews and ratings I've seen for this film and such high ratings for those two made by Ephron. I also know that I can't be the only person to have made the connection. I'm not trying to knock Nora Ephron, especially since she just passed away and she's not here to defend herself but I can't help but wonder. I'm not saying she isn't talented but I find the women in her films to be more whiney and annoying than smart and intelligent. They seem to be recycled characters that take themselves too seriously. Penny Marshall directed 'Jumpin Jack Flash' and I find the women in her movies to be much stronger and likeable. This is just my opinion though so I'll leave it at that. I sincerely hope I didn't offend anyone.

I can't believe the DVD cover art for this film. They should've used the original poster. It looks like they took a recent photo of Whoopi and edited out the small amount of gray in her dreads and they also used a current photo of Lower Manhattan and the problem is, if you went a little further to the left it would've been a photo of Lower Manhattan without the twin towers. That makes no sense since the towers are clearly visible in the film and existed in 1986. It looks like they tried to have it both ways and just started the skyline to the right of where the towers would've been. Any New Yorker would know this and recognize the obvious. Perhaps I'm making too big of a deal?

Some extras would have been nice but I'm just happy it's available to purchase on DVD.",1341100800,3,2961,4.4375
638227,5,6303394035,My granddaughter has discovered Whoopi and wanted to see some of her movies. This one is one of my favorites. I had forgotten how funny it was and still is. A great way to spend a movie night.,1339804800,,192,4.078947368421052
638228,5,6303394035,"If you don't laugh yourself sick over the primitive computer terminals (not even desk tops, folks; they were all terminals on a big computer in an air-conditioned room) of 1986, you will enjoy this slapstick version of a spy adventure that has Whoopi Goldberg as the girl who got involved just for wanting to be helpful.

Jumpin' Jack Flash is the pseudonym of some guy somewhere who hacks into the computer on which Terry (Goldberg) is running routine data transfers for a bank, to transfer money to and from foreign banks. She's eccentric, to say the least (we ARE talking Whoopi Goldberg, after all), but the boss keeps her because she's also very efficient.

One day, ""Jack"" hacks into her computer and convinces her he needs her help. She's supposed to take a message to the British Consulate. OK, she does that, but they think she's just a kook and don't pay any attention to her. Or do they? Then why are people following her, and why does it seem they want to kill her?

I will not ruin all the fun by telling you too much. Let's just say that Whoopi gets to display a grand variety of her talents, not to mention some pretty good legs. Wait until you see her get a sequined gown caught in a paper shredder!!!

Of course the good guys win in the end, but it make take you (as it did Terry) some time to figure out who are the good guys and who the bad guys -- not to mention the ladies.

Good for at least 1,000 laughs.",1336867200,,1427,4.329588014981273

Part of the problem was should it be a comedy or drama? Comedy is okay. John Huston changed Beat the Devil from suspense to comedy but it was a well written film. Jack Flash also possesses a good storyline but it became The Whoopi Goldberg Show and drifted into slapstick on occasion to kill time. She needed help on this film from the supporting characters. So the film bcame the show. It was also a lost opportunity but it was made at an awkward time. Only white folks could be American heroes. They could barely be leading characters. She took a few steps towards trashing that idea with Jack Flash. She could have taken a few more but the hesitation may have been due to concern over her acting capabilities if the film drifted toward drama and suspense. So why bother. Take what you have and forget the rest. At the time it was a wise decision. Still I hope that somebody will redo the film. There may be no KGB but the world is still quite dangerous. Hacking has grown quite common and somebody, establishing a back line of communications in this situation, doesn't sound unfeasible. I would like to see somebody try it again but it needs strong writing.",1279238400,,1323,4.426229508196721

638393,5,6303394035,This is my all time favorite movie.  I can watch this movie over and over again and still find it funny.  I wish there were more movies out there of this quality.,1162684800,,162,4.03125
638394,5,6303394035,"This is a very special film. It stars Whoopi Goldberg, an interesting character, a real liberal in real life, but in reel life you just don't know what kind of movie she'll make. Some of her movies are very moral and decent. The best of them (in my opinion) is Jumpin' Jack Flash.

The film begins with ""Terry"" (played adroitly by Whoopi) a lonely, single, working girl. The movie was made in 1986 before the internet came on the scene. Terry works at a major U.S. bank doing international SWIFT transactions. Through a (then) special hi-tech communications technology, she organizes an IM-archetype chat room with other bank employees around the world.

Then one day she gets a message on her computer from Jumpin' Jack Flash. (The voice of Jonathan Price). He's a British Intelligence agent on a secret mission. He's trapped inside the ex-Soviet Union. He needs help. The KGB is hunting him. Suddenly Terry's life is turned completely upside down.

The KGB, CIA and British Intelligence are all after her in one way or another. At Jack's request she goes to a ball at the British Embassy in New York City to try and find a man that may be able to help him. There she only finds betrayal. She find's further intrigue at Jack's apartment and through his old flame, a hot blonde otherwise known as ""The Lady Sara.""

But no one will help Jack. ""He knows the risks and he's on his own,"" they all tell her.

Terry pleads with Sara. ""You had a thing once."" You loved him. He loved you. He still has you picture in his apartment. He still loves you! Why won't you help him? Why do you turn on your back on him when he needs you most? After all he's done for you?

Sara simply says, ""I'm sorry.""

Terry gets so angry. She replies, ""You're not sorry. You're sad!"" And you're no lady!

Other agents, Jacks's fellow MI-6 friends, are being murdered. A little girl of a dead MI-6 agent writes ""KGB"" in her birthday cake in a most non-plussed manner.

Terry puts her job and her very life at risk for a person she doesn't even know.

When Jack finds out she's a woman he threatens to break off all contact with her. He is chivalrous of course. He doesn't want Terry get hurt or killed. But Terry becomes very mad. She tells him, ""I've got better things to do than save your butt, bud!""

Terry's made a promise never to abandon Jack, no matter that everyone else he trusted has abandoned him. She had honor and moral integrity with her word. Her word is her bond. Her word is her life. Her word embodies her honor, no matter what the cost may be. As such, you simply can't help but stand up and cheer for her. In a world of women who abandon their children and spouses and others who love them, she's special. Again, what Terry says, she means.

And in a world of lies and betrayal, the cost of truth is great. Terry is told by Archer Lincoln, a mysterious intelligence agent who appears out of nowhere, to ""Get off the stage before you get carried off.""

The plot thickens further when Terry is abducted and chemically interrogated by the KGB, but no one can break her. Because she's kind and good and breaks the rules only to help others, the angels have given Terry the key to saving Jack's life. She knows the key when no one, not the KGB, CIA or MI-6, has a clue.

""The key is the key.""

Jim Belushi, who plays the chemical interrogator, exclaims with exasperation, ""The key is the key! What the hell does that mean?""

But in fact the key IS the key. That's the thing. Terry's smart. She's figured out the key. It's the key to the song ""Jumpin' Jack Flash."" (B-flat). This song was made famous by The Rolling Stones and their lead singer Mick Jagger.

But there's one missing piece to the puzzle. Terry still needs The Lady Sara's help.

Will Terry's heart, which always hopes for the best and always hopes for love, finally be enough to move Sara to action? Will Sara finally become a true lady? And will Terry and Sara save Jack before the KGB kills him?

Remember in life, just as in Jumpin' Jack Flash, the key (goodness, kindness, love, keeping one's promises, forgiveness, endurance, service, selflessness, courage, risk, devotion, morality, values and honor) is the key.",1154822400,4,4169,4.4907407407407405

638396,4,6303394035,Whoppi Goldberg is a delight as the computer clerk working for a bank who receives a cryptic message from a US agent who needs assistance escaping from a foreign country. Our family thought this movie was a great comedy/drama when we first saw it in the 80's and it still wears well if you can deal with computer technology that has long since become obsolete. It is great fun.,1151971200,,377,4.478260869565218
638407,4,6303394035,"Whoopi Goldberg, like Robin Williams, got her start as a standup comedian, and like Williams, basically plays herself repeatedly in her films. That self is very funny and very attractive, but again as with Williams, she tends to ride roughshod over the other actors in the film. That is a tribute to what a great star she is, still it would be interesting to see her in company with better supporting actors.

That said, Jumpin' Jack Flash is really a hoot, perfect after a long day at the office or other unpleasant experience. Buy it, sit back, and enjoy! You will not be disappointed.

Note: If you can find it, there's a wonderful MTV video floating around the Web of Whoopi banging a cab driver (played by Jim Belushi) over the head with a frying pan, running away with him in pursuit, and ducking into a building, slamming the door behind her. When she turns around, she's in a recording studio, where Keith Richards asks her if she's a backup singer. Of course she immediately becomes a backup singer, backing up Aretha Franklin who is recording ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" with Richards. Neither Franklin nor the Stones appear in the final version, but Franklin's version of ""Jumpin' Jack Flash,"" which is as good as the Stones', provides the backup to the credits at the end.",1143244800,7,1277,4.696428571428571

This was the first time I recall seeing a comedy spy movie other than ""Casino Royale"" at the time. Goldberg and the rest the cast do a great job. Good music and sets make it stand out among a good number of those produced today. I highly recommend you buy this one since it is definitely one of Whoopi's best.",1115337600,9,684,4.428571428571429

I presumed the delay was because Fox were preparing a bunch of extras to add to the DVD, but not so. JJF has finally arrived on DVD, and despite there not being a single special feature (not even the trailer), it is still worth owning!  Would have been nice for Whoopi to do an audio-commentary. A nice 5.1 surround sound has been given to the soundtrack, and the widescreen anamorphic is nice to have after years of watching the video cropped version.  I will say that the DVD transfer is not sharp, but acceptable considering the film's age. JJF is Whoopi at her finest.
