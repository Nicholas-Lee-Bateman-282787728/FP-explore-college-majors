5732435,3,B00CPKZLDY,"As a parent, I regret buying this. My kids like it, but the animation is awful, the plotlines aren't that great, and there are definitely better things to watch out there. We bought it for a rainy day, and I watched the first episode with them, but I just couldn't stomach it any further than that. So, I don't recommend it as a family movie night kind of thing, but I pop it in for them when I need to get some cleaning or laundry done.",1379635200,4,437,4.093023255813954
5732436,5,B00CPKZLDY,"Awesome you get to see one of the most beloved video game characters come to life in this dvd that has four episodes from the tv show. I thought that it was pretty good I would like to see more. maybe they will release the entire first season on dvd soon, I hope. if you have not seen this dvd then I recommend you do",1379462400,,317,3.8923076923076922
5732437,2,B00CPKZLDY,"I loved the original DK cartoon where Soupy Sales did the voice which were aired as ""Saturday Morning Supercade"" in the early 80s. Sadly this is not that DK.

After RARE & Nintendo gave DK the SMW treatment with DKC they made this rather cheap CGI cartoon based on the newer games. It's not awful but just not up to the quality of other Nintendo shows.",1378252800,,352,4.333333333333333
5732438,4,B00CPKZLDY,"This DVD features four episodes in its 90 minutes of running time, and honestly I can probably recite the DVD at this point.  My 5 year old even said he had a dream about the Crystal Coconut from one of the episodes, so maybe we need a Donkey Kong break?

Episodes include:

Bad Hair Day
Ape Foo Young
Booty and the Beast
Barrel, Barrel, Who's Got the Barrel

Now the animation is CGI animation, which is hard to describe other than to say don't expect Disney or Pixar quality.  The animation is simple and it works, especially for the low price of this DVD.  The episodes are basic with Donkey Kong being the good guy and crocodiles being the bad guys.  While the animation is so-so, it is Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong so I didn't mind watching it.  My boys enjoyed it and like I said we have watched it over and over.  The episodes crack us up and are simple enough to follow.

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1377388800,,950,4.286516853932584
5732439,4,B00CPKZLDY,"I bought this DVD and got it for a good price but I guess it's also called you get what you paid for.

Here are the features:
-4 Classic episodes on one disc
-a reversible cover one side in English and one side in Spanish

The bad:
-The DVD says there are Subtitles in English and Spanish but no subs are present.
-The Disc Menu gives you only 8 seconds to make a selection.
-The quality makes the background look like a bad jpeg picture.

I still give this DVD release a 4/5 just cause its a great series.",1377216000,,506,4.090909090909091
5732440,5,B00CPKZLDY,"This DVD, which comes with newly made cover art, is absolutely fantastic! The cover art is a bit misleading as the show does not look as good as this, however the DVD is great! It comes with 4 episodes from the 1998 Donkey Kong Country cartoon. No new episodes, just a simple new release! It's great to have more episodes released in English here in the US, and each episode is very entertaining, especially the musical numbers. If you're a fan of Donkey Kong at all, I recommend this DVD.",1376956800,,489,4.444444444444445
5732441,3,B00CPKZLDY,"This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product before its release date, a practice I find deplorable in most cases. (Oh! I hope this item's as good as it sounds! 5 stars!) But I have actually seen the Legend of the Crystal Coconut VHS, a collection of four or so episodes condensed into one feature long presentation, and so count myself as qualified to comment on the quality, or lack there of, of the cartoons found within this disk.
In case you don't already know, this show was a musical. Yes, you read that right. A Donkey Kong musical. Each episode features two brand new songs per 23ish minute showing. The problem here, besides the fact that singing apes and lizards make not a lick of sense even in a cartoon, is that with the exception of (most)Disney feature films songs in cartoons tend to be ear-bleedingly bad. The musical selections here are, sadly, no exception to the rule. Just try watching a memory disadvantaged DK sing about how the mirror never lies and that he must be a kremling pirate and you'll see what I mean. And with two fast-forwardable ditties (not to be confused with Diddy) every episode that makes for a lot of ear covering, maybe if I turn down the volume the neighbors won't hear this kind of viewing.
It's not all bad. The charactor designs are taken directly from the games, making for a visual treat for any DK fan. Except for Candy Kong, who's been so badly reimagined here I have to assume she's a brand new ape who shares Candys good name. The CGI, while outdated still looks OK, in fact the graphics of the show are superior to those found in DK 64. If you or your kids simply love the Donkey Kong, go ahead and secure a copy. There's certainly worse out there. Just don't expect to be popping it in often.",1376524800,2,1757,4.425925925925926
5732442,4,B00CPKZLDY,"All of these episodes are made with the uppermost high quality rendering software, The dialogue and original soundtrack are both really great too! I'd recommend purchasing this DVD on the Nintendo Wii U eshop as you can get an exclusive tie for Donkey Kong in the next Smash Brothers game.",1372291200,3,289,4.8

5732444,5,B00CPKZLDY,"This is the greatest thing I have ever watched. Kong glory will shine at it's highest at the top of the heavens and descend downwards with edible Kong candies. Kong is the utmost highest achievement one could ever make in the world and society will start advancing if we watch more Donkey Kong Country. It's based off of the greatest video game ever created, Super Mario 64, and will not stop being an inspiration to us all.

Someday, we'll all be able to sing like Donkey Kong, who is voiced by none other than Prince. Prince offered his voice for these performances but changed his voice to a different one to hide his identity. Regardless, his talent still shines and his quality absorbs anything it touches and turns into a Kongified glory emporium. You WILL grow wings. You WILL learn to fly. The Lord has put these hands on you, and He will make it known that you can FLY into the air with the greatest of ease, flipping and ooking on the Kongo Trapeze!

These episodes are not only spiritual incantations of pure joy and majestic beauty but they are also the funniest shows ever recorded. When Prince gets into the Donkey Kong suit, he learns to /live/ the part, just as Michael J. Fox does his best inside the animatronically-functioning Diddy Kong body cast costume. The humor is splendid, featuring references to the top 40 charts of contemporary adult pop featured throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, making it where the jokes can be fully enjoyed by children and knowing adults alike. Kongo Bongo!

Overall, it's easily the greatest feat we've ever had. Watch out, animation connoseurs, because Donkey Kong Country is sure to whet your appetite for insanely high quality fun! It truly is deserving of the Pulitzer Prize and worthy of everyone's seven dollar payment from Amazon.com.

5732445,5,B00CPKZLDY,This is a pretty good collection of episodes. I just wish that they would put all the episodes in one season than releasing these little movies that have only four episodes. just release season 1 and so on if there is only one season than just do the complete series thing. but all in all this was good.,1400630400,2,303,4.241379310344827
5732446,5,B00CPKZLDY,"As a young child I watched this and loved it. I was seriously mad when the channel it was on randomly canceled it with some stupid show that I refused to watch called Zack Attack.
I'm glad to see that its on DVD now, but I wish that they would release a full DVD set!!!

People like to comment and complain that this is ""Cheesy"" it is NOT cheesy, if by cheesy they mean wholesome and entertaining show with a splash of education without shoving it down your throat and no violence or swearing in it.

Then yes, call it ""Cheesey"" then.

I like wholesome entertainment without violence, swearing and inappropriate humor.
I think the worst phrase they used in this show would be ""Homespun idiot"" and even that is pretty funny of an insult.
They don't use fart jokes or other rude noises like so many cartoons are
They use decent vocabulary and subtle jokes.

I could put this on for little children visitors and parents will not call up later with rage over their kid learning a bad thing.
I would not have to screen it before giving this to a child and I wish more cartoons would be like that.

I would say this is Grade A quality humor and a treat the whole family can enjoy.

Donkey Kong and his friends are pretty honest and decent characters. Sometimes Donkey Kong can be a tad bit lazy, however, even in his most laziness he still isn't a bad influence and it certainly doesn't highlight the laziness to be a good thing!",1397174400,6,1423,4.371212121212121
5732447,5,B00CPKZLDY,"I'm a fan of this series and I have been waiting for it to come out! I wish they could just release a box set already of it.
My favorite is Kong Fu out of the whole series.
I love how there was a song included with most of the episodes.

The TV series was released in 1998 so people must not compare it with TV animation of today, as animation of today is a lot different. For its time it was very fresh and ne

5732452,4,B00CPKZLDY,"When you've lived as long as I have (and that's quite a while, mind you), you'd be pretty amazed that some your favorite video game characters have their own TV series.  Think about it: Super Mario, Sonic the Hedgehog, Pokemon, Kirby, even Pac-Man who has a brand-new series now playing on Disney XD.  And yes, even your favorite barrel-throwing gorilla Donkey Kong.

Based on the hit platforming SNES game series, ""Donkey Kong Country"" chronicles the adventures of D.K. and all his pals like Diddy, Cranky, Dixie, Funky, Candy, and more as he protects the most valuable treasure on the island of Kongo Bongo, The Crystal Coconut, from the scaly clutches of King K. Rool and his army of Kremlings.  Not only this CG series is fun and action-packed, it's musical, too.  That's right, you get treated to a pair of original songs in every episode of this cool series.

So this first volume has four episodes for your enjoyment and they are:

""Bad Hair Day"" - In order to get the Crystal Coconut, K. Rool creates a robot version of Candy Kong to seduce D.K. into cutting his hair to make him weak and powerless.  Now Cranky must conjure up an antidote to get D.K.'s strength and the Coconut back.

""Ape Foo Young"" - Cranky creates a potion to make himself younger so he can get back at K. Rool and his army.  Unfortunately, Donkey Kong drinks that same potion turning him into a Baby Kong !

""Booty and the Beast"" - A pirate captain sets sail to Kongo Bongo in order to get the Crystal Coconut back into his possession.  After the captain successfully stole the Coconut, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong hop aboard the pirate ship to steal it back, but they get caught in the process.  Now their only help is a hungry little Kritter who strikes a deal with the Kongs.

""Barrel, Barrel, Who's Got the Barrel"" - Barrel tycoon Bluster attempts to win the attention of Candy by snatching the Crystal Coconut.  However, the artifact gets trapped in a barrel and winds up in the snowy mountains where a race against D.K. and K. Rool is about to occur.

So if you love the hit video game series ""Donkey Kong Country"" you might as well get this DVD of the awesome TV series.  Look for a new volume coming soon to DVD.",1380499200,,2199,4.498740554156171

8584507,5,B00CPKZLDY,"We stumbled across this at Blockbuster back early 2000s when my then 6 and 8 year old just happened to be into playing DK 64 so the timing was perfect. They knew the characters and all about crystal coconuts. They did wish that the other DK64 characters would show up in the movie though. We all watched it a lot and really enjoyed it.

My now 16 yr old Son and I recently downloaded DK 64 on virtual console and it made me want to search for this movie. Was so happy to see you could get it on DVD. He and my Daughter still appreciated it for nostalgic value but being teenagers they now thought it was 'too cheesy' now and 'how could they ever had watched this over and over' etc etc.etc.. None the less, we enjoy it and glad it's part of our collection.

As a computer geek, people have to remember that at the time this was pretty sophisticated computer animation and that's part of what I love about it. I enjoy it more than the Kids now :-P

As far as full series, you can watch them via YouTube but nice to have a high quality version of this on DVD.",1437868800,2,1057,4.121359223300971
