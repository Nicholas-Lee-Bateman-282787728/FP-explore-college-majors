It's really entertaining, even for those who are at more of a beginner level.  And it definitely makes you want to work that much harder knowing what is possible.",1323216000,,309,4.581818181818182

8497588,4,B006GHFH36,"Pretty good advanced moves in this volume--good follow-up to the first volume.  The instruction is pretty good; however, in addition to the advanced moves, I would've like to see additional mid-level moves to supplement the first volume.",1359158400,,237,5.405405405405405
8497589,5,B006GHFH36,"WOW!!!  I don't know what else to say!  I have learned a few dips from various classes I've taken throughout the years, but this is by far the coolest thing I've ever seen!  They teach you all kinds of dips, and flips, and tricks to use on the dance floor.  I do more West Coast Swing and can incorporate these easily into whatever style we're dancing for the night and look awesome.  Okay.. not all of the moves cuz I'm too tall and hubby would probably break his back trying to do the barrel drop while I crash through the floor, but you get the idea!!  They show you where a spotter should be to help you learn the moves and walk you through every hand hold, leg positioning, body positioning, EVERYTHING!  HIGHLY recommend!",1344556800,,727,4.380597014925373
8497590,5,B006GHFH36,"So, my girlfriend is all about dancing, and I've always been reticent to get into it.  For starters, I didn't really want to take a public lessons (in a class setting or whatever) because my two left feet are enough to embarras me on my own.  Long and short of it, these two videos (1 & 2) not only gave me the ""up"" I needed to get into it, but also gave me the nuts and bolts that my brain could wrap around.  I'm a hands on kind of learner, so it was great the way they broke it down, step by step.  Very through, very sequential.  By the time I was done with the videos (I practiced every day for two weeks) I was able to feel comfortable dancing with my girlfriend, because as all us guys know, it's all about how the guy ""leads.""  If the dancing duo has got a strong lead, they're set.  I just needed an entry point.  A place to start the journey of 1000 miles.  I'd recommend this for whomever has the same trepidation I had (like, omg there's no way).  I'm a couple months in now and I'm able to go out dancing, learning new steps, confidence in place.  Highly recommend it.",1333411200,2,1081,4.1
8497591,5,B006GHFH36,I bought both vol 1 and vol 2.  I wish they came in a bundle cause they are both really good.  These are the same dancers that are on youtube doing crazy flips and dance competitions.  We've been trying to copy their moves but could never quite figure them all out.  This DVD has my most favorite move of all time.  They call it the barrel roll press.  This move alone is worth the price of the DVD!,1325635200,,399,4.051282051282051
8497592,5,B006GHFH36,"Great video!  Not only was it instructional but really entertaining.  David and Meghan did a terrific job.  They explained so easily some very difficult moves.  I loved it!
Thanks!",1325289600,,180,5.103448275862069
8497593,5,B006GHFH36,"My girlfriend gave me this video along with Volume 2 for Christmas. Her and I have always been into swing dancing and this gift was perfect for us! I absolutely love this video! It helps me with the technical side to swing dancing. I am not a very skilled dancer and haven't been blessed with the ability to keep a great rhythm but this video helped me a lot! Great instructions and easy to learn and follow! 5 Stars! I loved how advanced all the moves were. The instructions were great; involving how to enter a move and get out of a move with both male and female perspectives before, during, and after the move. I wish I could get personal lessons!",1325116800,,651,4.344262295081967
8497594,5,B006GHFH36,"After falling in love with the first Volume in the series I was anxious to watch the next. I can honestly say that this one is even more amazing! Such great moves are introduced and are made easy to follow along with. I've gained even more confidence thanks to this DVD. Again, the video quality is superb and the instructors are top notch :-)",1323907200,,343,4.375
8497595,5,B006GHFH36,"This video will take your moves to the next level!  I've learned so much from this DVD, and in addition to the first one, it's a fantastic way to really impress a partner or a group of friends when you go out dancing.  The aerials are incredible to watch and even more fun to participate in.  It takes a little while for any beginner to even think about doing those sorts of acrobatics.  But with the ease of this coaching, I seriosuly think just about anyone can get to that point rather quickly!  The instructors are really easy on the eyes and seem real friendly which makes watching them all the more of a joy (my girlfriend agrees).  I'm telling y'all, if you are serious about dancing and having a good time while doing it.  This DVD will really put your talents on to the next stage.",1323820800,,790,4.333333333333333
8497596,5,B006GHFH36,"I wrote a review for the first video in this set. I loved it, mostly because I was a beginner and they made it so easy to learn. My girl and I have been dancing together now for a while and we saw the second video and decided to try it. (on a side note, I would recommend the first video first. These moves are a little more intense and you need to be loose and comfortable first) I loved seeing these flashy, cool new moves! It's so much fun to use them when we go out, and now we're talking about entering some competitions! Basically, I feel like the man now.

Definitely get into these videos if you're into country or dancing, or both!",1323302400,2,640,4.12
