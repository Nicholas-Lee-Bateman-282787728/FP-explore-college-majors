759345,5,630396155X,"Stanley Kramer was a daring filmmaker who never shunned controversy.  ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" represented his finest work, a daring masterpiece with some of the greatest film stars who ever lived performing at pinnacle levels.
Spencer Tracy is a former U.S. Federal District Court judge who was removed from office by the voters in his home state of Maine at the last election.  He tells Edward Binns, playing a U.S. Senator, that he is ""an old hick from the backwoods of Maine"" and was ""not even the tenth choice for this job.""  He ultimately proves to all concerned just how wrong his initial self-evaluation happens to be.
Richard Widmark and Maximilian Schell square off in a courtroom ""High Noon"" (another great Kramer drama) debating the issue of personal responsibility on the part of judges interpreting laws on behalf of a thoroughly unjust Nazi regime seeking implementation of decrees such as ""sterilization"" of those deemed unfit to live.  Widmark argues persuasively that as administrators of justice the judges on trial had a responsibility to exercise proper jurisprudence in the face of an administration dedicated to tyranny.  Schell is also persuasive as he argues that, were it not for the necessity of playing along with the regime at certain times, the situation would have been worse overall within Germany.
Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland are moving as victims of Nazi injustices that went unredressed in the court system, while Burt Lancaster is towering as a noted German judge and legal scholar who parts company with his fellow defendants in admitting that in not standing up to the tyranny emanating on high, he is guilty for the crime for which he is being charged.  The highest dramatic point of the film is when Lancaster, a towering giant even in silence, stands up and shouts ""Enough!"" as Schell brutally badgers Garland in cross-examination.  He demands to make a statement, which Tracy allows, in which he concedes his guilt.
A moving friendship develops between Tracy and Marlene Dietrich, whose husband was a Nazi military officer convicted and executed at an earlier Nuremberg trial proceeding.  She insists that her husband was no more than a military officer concerned about battlefield activity and openly admires Lancaster.  She is  crestfallen when Tracy concurs with Widmark that the judges being tried by the tribunal had a responsibility to uphold the law even in the face of a crazed floodtide of persecution and injustice emanating from the Nazi high command in Berlin.
Abby Mann's brilliant script won an Oscar, as did the riveting performance of Schell in the Best Supporting Actor category.",1019692800,6,2643,5.111368909512761
759346,5,630396155X,"I have only seen this movie once, and I only wish to see it once.  It is a terrific, terrific movie--one of the most unflinching and riviting movies I have ever seen.  But it is a very difficult movie to watch.  Once is enough; I feel as though I have been run through a ringer.
Three small things bother me: First, Stanley Kramer's directing is often times stunning, startlingly so.  But in a few very prominent cases it is distracting, especially during the 360 degree courtroom shots.  Second, the script has an annoying habit of tying scenes together with visual puns.  For instance, there is a scene in which Marlene Dietrich begins to pour a cup of coffee which quickly cuts to another scene where a fellow finishes pouring his cup of coffee.  I find this habit odd and unnecessary.  This is a serious work of art--and a highly successful work of art.  It does not benefit much at all from such pointless cleverness: the subject matter does not call for bludgening the viewer with visual puns.  Third, I cannot stand William Shatner's performance.  It is hollow and unconvincing.  This is a small matter, however, in light of the rest of the movie.
Aside from these really quite small objections--annoyances, really--I found the movie to be practically irreproachable.  It is a film everyone ought to see: an amazing achievement as an artwork and also as a document.  It handles the complexities of these trials, and the confused emotional atmosphere that went with them, to incredible vicarious affect.  I recommend this movie without significant reservation to absolutely anyone--we all must consider the questions that this movie raises if we are ever really to move beyond the twentieth century.",1007510400,7,1705,4.89198606271777
759347,5,630396155X,"It's been years since I saw this film, but much of it is still vivid in my mind.
The theme of the film is the impact of grand political ideas on ordinary people. We see the initial, instinctive isolationism of the American trial judge; the impact of war on an old, aristocratic military family in Germany; the patriotism of the Nazi-abhorring German defence counsel, who sees a 'not guilty' verdict as a victory for Germany's struggle to regain its self-respect; and the character of Ernst Janning, the incorruptible judge who saw the world around him go mad.
So how do you navigate your way through a moral maze when the old ideas of right and wrong have been turned on their head? This is not just a question for post-war Germany and Japan, or for post-communist eastern Europe, or for Muslims who try to reconcile their religion with the essentially anti-religious philosophy of Europe and North America: it is a question for all of us.
There is no easy answer. If we ignore our consciences and go along with the crowd, we can end up committing monstrous crimes; if we ignore the crowd and keep ourselves pure, we contribute to the atomisation of society and the breakdown of any form of common culture.
The only real way out is to involve ourselves in the way our societies are run, and argue our case in the marketplace of ideas.
Heavy stuff. It is a tribute to Kramer and his actors that they could inspire such thinking in a mainstream, Hollywood film.
This is a film you'll remember for the rest of your life.",1005696000,4,1517,4.580882352941177
759348,5,630396155X,"This movie asks the question how can good people be swayed so much by society that they refuse to see the cruelty and injustice of their actions.  I can not help but remember Aristotle's saying, ""We are by nature social beings.""  This movie brings home that even the most extraordinary human beings can rarely be independent of the societies in which they live.",1000857600,2,361,4.714285714285714
759349,5,630396155X,"Judgement at Nuremberg is not only a brilliantly scripted and directed film, but also a masterclass in acting. Maximillian that does not appear dated in terms of its morality or ethics, despite the 40 years that have eclipsed since its production. Schell gives an Oscar winning performances as Herr Rolf, who struggles in vain to defend Nazism. While Spencer Tracy is equally convincing as the Judge. Yet it is perhaps Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster that give the most touching performances, as both are playing atypical characters; Clift indeed giving the performance of his career. Judgement at Nuremberg is a film that grafts itself (and rightly so) on to the viewers imagination, with the real holocaust films as graphic and disturbing now as they were in 1961.",998956800,4,770,5.070866141732283
759350,5,630396155X,"With an all star cast, Judgment at Nuremberg certainly delivers with powerful acting and great directing by Stanley Kramer.

Burt Lancaster portrays one of four-nazi judges convicted of war crimes at the Nuremberg trials. The year is 1948, two years since the main Nuremberg trials concluded and 3 years since World War 2 ended. Throughout the film, mention is made of the cold war. The invasion of Czechoslovakia and the Berlin Airlift are mentioned. Also, Emil Hahn (Played by Werner Klemperer, the future Colonel Klink) states, after he is sentenced, ""...Tomorrow the Bolsheviks sentence you!"" Speaking of perfromances, fine performances are also given by just about the entire cast, from Spencer Tracy as Judge Dan Heywood, to Montgomery Clift playing Rudolph Peterson, a victim of nazi atrocities. Judy Garland and Marlene Dietrich also give great performances. But it is Lancaster, Richard Widmark and Maxmilian Schell (Who won an Oscar for Best Actor) who steal the show.

In addition to everything listed above, the film's music fits it like a glove. The cinematography is also good. In addition, this version also includes the original theatrical trailer.

This is definately one of my ten favorites and deserves a spot in the collection of any film buff (It has a spot in mine).",986428800,46,1288,5.123809523809523
759351,5,630396155X,"This is truly an astonishing movie. After seeing it one wonders that Spencer Tracy did not win the Academy Award for his performance here. Of course, another actor in the cast, Maxmillian Schell, playing the German  defense attorney, did! In many ways the movie is the senior brother to  ""Schindler's List"", acting to probe thoughtfully through the mist of  euphemisms, excuses and exaggerations of the era. And sifting out some  remarkable, memorable, and noble notions about what human beings should be  held responsible for in terms of their social attitudes, civic behavior and  public actions.

Ostensibly, the action takes place after the more  sensational trials of the Nazi hierarchy, when the public appetite for  blood, revenge, and harsh justice had been somewhat abated. Tracy plays a  relatively obscure retired rural American judge called upon to act as one  of the three presiding judges in overseeing the trials of prominent German  jurists who had co-operated, collaborated, and then presided over the  gradual civil drift from a nation whose conduct and laws were based on a  corpus of jurisprudence to one characterized by crackpot eugenic policies,  blatant racism, & officially-sanctioned violence and mayhem.

Burt  Lancaster plays a pre-eminent German judge, one famed for his legal  treatises and international reputation as a jurist. Through the prism of  the testimony of both the judges on trial and their cross examination by a  zealous American military prosecutor played masterfully by a young Richard  Widmark, the viewer begins to understand much more about the slippery slope  most of the jurists had unwittingly embarked upon.  Add into this equation  the introduction of a sensational set of key witnesses played by Judy  Garland and Montgomery Clift, and the full emotional impact and profound  significance of what these judges had allowed to happen truly gels.

This  is an unforgettable and remarkably unique movie, truly a classic and  cautionary tale based on the historical record of what the Germans did to  each other, based on fact. And by the way, be sure to listen carefully to  the final several scenes in which Tracy takes full advantage of several  opportunities to cut through all the equivocations, half-truths, and  ""honest mistake"" nonsense, literally electrifying the screen with the power  of his monologue and his superb acting.  He was truly one of a kind, too.  Wow!  Don't miss this",963014400,198,2442,5.233160621761658
759352,5,630396155X,"As compelling and important as this movie is as a piece of filmmaking and of history, for me, the rare treat here are a handful of unusual performances by stars we have seen before. Maximillian Schell is simply  dazzling as the prosecutor, and deserved the Oscar; Judy Garland will blow  you away with a performance, complete with accent, that is unlike anything  you have ever seen from her before, and Marlene Dietrich is exceptional in  her key moments on screen. While the parade of faces continues throughout  this lengthy and absorbing movie, it is these three that pushed it from  four stars to five for me.",946944000,8,614,4.745283018867925

- neither has commentary, both have Mann/Schell, Kramer, and 'Value' featurettes.

Though it's a long one--and hard to watch, at that--it's definitely an excellent chunk of brain-food from the upper echelons of cinematic history.  Somehow, it leaves you with more faith in humanity than disdain, which is incredible, considering there's a very graphic portion of holocaust footage in the middle that really sears in the back of your head.

WWII is over, but Allied Justice over the Nazi atrocities must still move forward. It's 1948 Nuremberg and all the Nazi big-shots responsible for the war are dead, but now the courts must deal with German judges who went along with Nazi law that sent millions to the death camps. In this trial there are 4 previous German judges, one is played by Werner Klemperer of Hogan's Heroes fame, and they are brilliantly defended by Schell's character (one of the best court performances I've seen). He really earned his Oscar and recognition. Spencer Tracy is the presiding judge who is very diplomatic.

Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift have small, important roles and are superb as witnesses. Their performances add to the importance of how these trials needed to move forward, despite many who believed we should drop them in light of the Soviet Union's threat and how we needed the support of the German people, who some believed would not give us that support if we continued prosecuting their leaders.

This trial has shown that under a national crisis ordinary, even able and extraordinary men can delude themselves into the commission of crimes so vast and heinous that they beggar the imagination.  No one who has sat through this trial can forget them

Let it now be noted that here in our decision, this is what we stand for: justice, truth, and the value of a single human being.

The above comes from this riveting courtroom drama written by Abbey Mann and starring Spencer Tracy (1900 to 1967), Burt Lancaster (1913 to 1994), Richard Widmark (1914 to 2008), Marlene Dietrich (1901 to 1992), Judy Garland (1922 to 1969), Maximilian Schell (1930 to 2014), and Montgomery Clift (1920 to 1966).

William Shatner (born: 1931) of Star Trek fame and Werner Klemperer (1920 to 2000) of Hogan Heroes fame also appear in this movie.

This film centers on a fictional 1948 military tribunal convened in Nuremberg, Bavaria, Germany in which four German judges, the defendants (two of them being played by B. Lancaster and W. Klemperer) stand accused of crimes against humanity for their involvement in atrocities committed under Adolf H.s regime in World War Two (1939 to 1945).

American Judge Dan Haywood (S. Tracy) is the Chief Trial Judge of a three-judge panel that will hear and decide the case against the defendants.  The German defense attorney is played by M. Schell (who won an Academy Award for his performance) while the prosecuting lawyer is played by R. Widmark.

Whats especially interesting about this film is that it shows actual footage filmed by American and British soldiers after the liberation of Germanys concentration camps. This footage only lasts for about five minutes but I found it to be very powerful visually.

To bridge the gap between English-speaking and German-speaking persons within the courtroom, the entire film is presented in English but translation is implied by having characters wear headphones.

I found that there were many themes explored in this movie.  It is especially good at exploring individual conscience, collective guilt, and behaviour during a time of societal immorality.

The acting by the main leads is quite good.  If I was to choose one performance that stood out, it would have to be that of Montgomery Clift.  His performance is relatively short but quite effective.

It is not surprising to me that this film was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2015) has no artifacts or blemishes.  The picture may actually be better than on the day it was first released!  There are four extras.

In conclusion, this is a powerful film that effectively gets its message across with respect to the dark days of the Second World War!!!

I think all movie DVDs - whether classics or new releases - sold by Amazon should clearly state for potential buyers if it does or does not have captioning; and if it indeed does, in which languages (I only read English myself). For hearing impaired home movie fans like me, this is no small matter. Regretably, this is not the first time this has happened to me. But now that it has happened enough (maybe 5 or 6 times over the last couple of years), I want to specificity point out this troublesome issue to Amazon and alert other DVD buyers out there who also want captioning with their DVD purchases to start complaining themselves when they too are sadly surprised at not receiving this significant option with their premium Amazon Prime DVD purchase.",1474675200,22,889,4.6687898089171975

759755,5,630396155X,"The story is a fictionalized version of one of the real post WWII Nuremberg trials. The moral issues raised by Abby Mann's Academy Award winning screenplay are serious and fascinating. There is a little bit about the Nazi death camps, but the film mostly concentrates on German judges accused of systematically perverting the German justice system after the Nazis came to power.
The acting is superb across the board. Maximillian Schell deserved his best actor award as the German defense attorney given an impossible task. Spencer Tracy as one of the US tribunal's judges and particularly Burt Lancaster as a once highly respected German judge who is on trial, both did outstanding jobs. This is probably one of Richard Widmark's best dramatic performances as the lead prosecutor. Marlene Dietrich, playing the widow of an executed German general, is also effective as Spencer Tracy's ""love interest."" Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland in small parts as victims called as witnesses are each emotionally shattering and almost steal the movie.
The movie is very long at 3 hours, but does not drag despite the absence of any ""action"" scenes. It is more enlightening than ""entertaining"" but is well worth seeing because of the importance of the subject matter and the outstanding performances.",1469664000,5,1290,5.177033492822966

759808,5,630396155X,"Powerful! The enormity, brutality and sadism are exposed in all the various shocking forms they took in Nazi Germany.
Among an all-star cast Burt Lancaster personifies the ""good"" German judge, who initially thought that some of the illegalities the government imposed were worth certain advantages that he thought Hitler brought to the German people. However, how he sees it, things got eventually completely out of hand, where even he could no longer justify the things judges were ordered to do, yet felt trapped in the system. Spencer Tracy as the chief among three American judges appears weak throughout the movie. However, in the end the 'good German judge' played by Burt Lancaster asks ""how things could get so completely out of hand"" The head judge, played by Spencer Tracy rises to the dignity of his position. He sums up the essence of why there had to be trials and why the horrendous transgressions of the Third Reich against humanity had to be exposed so that no one could pretend any longer that 'they did not know' of the crimes perpetrated in the concentration camps, by answering that things broke down when he, 'the good judge' convicted the first innocent man.' In other words, 'things did not get out of hand' gradually. When one person, the first innocent person was found guilty and convicted, things broke down.
Among an all-star cast is Maximilian Schell, the defender of the five judges on trial, who would in his summation accuse the entire world as enabling and contributing to the atrocities committed by the Hitler regime brings out interesting facts, which in the end however, cannot stand up as a valid defense. Ultimately every person has to take responsibility for his/her own actions.",1468627200,,1719,4.951557093425605

All the actors from the great Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Maximilian Schell, Richard Widmark Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, and Montgomery Clift are spectacular in this engrossing legal drama.  Centered on Nuremberg-style legal proceedings against  German judges who remained in their posts after the Nazi assumption of power, the film offers a fine and incisive psychological portrait of human responses to moral dilemmas set before them.  The viewers are treated to the metaphorical self-flagellation of Ernst Janning (Lancaster) who refuses to participate in his own defense; to Maximilian Schell's wily, but always logical defense of Janning; to Dietrich's attempt to salvage respect for the German Junkers, aristocrats, who were not Nazis; and, in a scene stealing performance, Clift is magnificent  as a developmentally challenged man, sterilized by the regime, who is called to testify.

As I've unfortunately given away some important plot details, I'll end this critique by saying only that Judy Garland and Richard Widmark shine in their respective roles.",1438128000,,1092,5.709876543209877

760100,5,630396155X,"I have the original DVD of this movie; when this version was available I secured it to have continual access.  Spencer Tracy was superb in his performance as Federal Judge Dan Haywood, for the State of Maine, who resided over this session of the International War Crimes Trials at Nuremberg.  William Shatner of Star Trek fame, starred as Capt. Harrison Byers as Judge Haywood's Aide.  Richard Widmark was magnificent in his role as Colonel Tad Lawson, U.S. Army prosecutor, balanced by the outstanding performance of Maximilian Schell as attorney for the defense.  During 1935, the Nuremberg Laws were established in Nazi Germany to commence the ""final solution"" against the Jews and other atrocities.  Four German Judges were Nazi Jurists who ""legalized"" Nazi atrocities against the Jews, ethnic groups and political dissidents.  In Post World War II Germany during this segment of the Nuremberg Trials the Berlin Airlift was implemented among other actions that commenced the Cold War.  In his closing statement, Colonel Lawson said due to the threat of war, mankind had not crossed over into Jordan: As a former Major in the USAF, I would add neither have we in the 21st Century! The apex of this true life historic movie was the decision Judge Dan Haywood handed down that civilization was at the bar in judgment against the 4 Nazi Jurists and the value of every single human being.  As a former USAF Officer during my attendance at USAF military schools and colleges in pursuit of a MA in Political Science, my main subject was the Nuremberg Code of 1947.  The whole civilized world should have stood up and applauded Judge Haywood's ruling that in any system of law in any nation, anyone who aides or abetted the commission of any crime - especially eugenics with a doctrine of attrition - is just as guilty as the parties who executed the crimes.  No one can avoid responsibility to adhere to the natural law of universal right and wrong with the excuse of just following orders.

760149,5,630396155X,"This superb courtroom drama still packs a wallop and remains relevant more than fifty years after its initial release in 1961.
Examining Nazi war crimes and German guilt was not a popular subject when Stanley Kramer filmed Abby Mann's celebrated drama which was originally presented ""live"" on television's ""Playhouse 90"" in 1959.  Mann expanded his teleplay into an Academy Award winning screenplay and under Kramer's brilliant direction, it turned into a three hour plus gripping drama, never losing focus on the delicate and important subject matter the film covers.
A powerful cast highlighted by Maximilian Schell's electric and Oscar winning performance as the German defence attorney, Spencer Tracy as the learned and humane judge, Burt Lancaster, Marlene Dietrich, Richard Widmark and the heart breaking renditions of two victims of Nazi atrocities played by Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift.  There has been criticism of Lancaster in the role of one of the judges on trial, a part originally meant for Laurence Olivier, but I think he has been a bit unfairly treated as he is more than acceptable in this difficult part.
A long film dealing with a harrowing subject but still potent for today's audience.  All technical credits are top notch, especially Ernest Laszlo' stark photography and Ernest Gold's brief but telling music score.
Never understood why Stanley Kramer and his films have been denigrated by so many ""notable"" film critics. During the period 1958-1961, Kramer produced and directed  ""The Defiant Ones"", ""On the Beach"", ""Inherit the Wind"" and his crowning achievement, ""Judgment"", all excellent, thought provoking and engrossing dramas.

760225,5,630396155X,"""I was only following orders."" This was usually the response given by former members of the Nazi party when asked why they did the things they did during the twelve years(1933-1945) that Hitler was in power. After the war, those members that hadn't already taken their own lives(Himmler, Hitler, etc.) were captured by the Allies and put on trial for war crimes that were held in the city of Nuremberg between 1945-1949. There were twelve trials all together with each given a separate name according to the group(Doctors, Judges, etc.) that were suspected of crimes against humanity. When Abby Mann wrote ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" he chose to center his story around the proceedings that occurred  in the ""Judges Trials"" and the results were sobering to say the least. When Stanley Kramer  brought it to the screen in 1961 he made a powerful statement on individual responsibility that is even more important today than it was over fifty years ago(Coincidentally, the film was released during the war crimes trial of Adolf Eichmann in Israel). Twilight Time has now brought ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" to Blu-ray and the results are just astounding. Originally released by United Artists, MGM(who owns the UA catalog) has provided an excellent print to Twilight for the film's Blu-ray debut and the image is nearly pristine. Since the film is nearly three hour long, Twilight could only give it a modest bitrate of 16.97 but the results are still impressive. There are no vertical lines, torn frames, dirt, and only a few white specks. The only film damage present is during the Prosecution's presentation of an edited version of archive footage made of the liberation of the concentration camps in the middle of the film(actually filmed by director George Stevens on site). Kramer uses a lot of close-ups during the film and this is where the new Blu-ray really stands out. This is really apparent in the tortured faces of Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland each of whom give exceptional Oscar nominated performances. Clift's performance is especially painful to watch as his once handsome features appear ravaged whenever he is in close-up. Kramer used the great cinematographer Ernest Laszlo to bring out the smallest details of those performances with the entire cast giving some of the best performances of their careers.  Additionally, both interiors and exteriors throughout the film are very sharp and clear. Overall, this is another excellent Blu-ray presentation by Twilight Time.  ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is 179 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.66:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH.  The Audio is English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and English 1.0 DTS-HD MA. Special features include a filmed conversation with Abby Mann and Maximilian Schell, a tribute to Stanley Kramer and an isolated Music track from Ernest Gold. There is also an informative booklet by film historian Julie Kirgo. With ""Judgment at Nuremberg"", Abby Mann was sending a powerful message: The Value of a Single Human Being. It's a message that is still as powerful today as it was in 1961.",1416614400,9,3064,5.107784431137724

This film is an excellent and well cast. Surprisingly there is William Shatner as Captain Harrison Byers from WestPoint before he beamed the flamboyant Captain Kirk we know of today. Burt Lancaster as Dr. Ernst Janning Made the best speech. I kept waiting for him to show his teeth. Spencer Tracy as Chief Judge Dan Haywood was excellent in showing the conundrum off the time.  Way too many actors to cover them all; so surprise yourself and watch the film before looking at the cast list.

The Nuremburg trials held in the American zone ended July 14 1949. There were ninety-nine defendants sentenced to prison terms. Not one is still serving his sentence.

The DVD I watched had many extras:

760286,5,630396155X,"...Judgment at Nuremberg is the greatest narrative war-era film in all of American cinematic history.

""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is an epic film that completely engulfs the viewer because of the nature and the severity of the subject matter. It is absolutely impossible to say who gave a better performance because the entire cast was perfect. Never has there been another motion picture with so many first-rate stars who all gave the performances of their collective careers.

The film is directed by Stanley Kramer, based on the screenplay by Abby Mann. And the main cast includes:
Spencer Tracy / Judge Dan Haywood
Burt Lancaster / Dr. Ernst Janning (defendant/judge)
Richard Widmark / Col. Lawson (prosecuting attorney)
Marlene Dietrich / Mrs. Bertholt
Maximilian Schell / Hans Rolfe (defense attorney)
Judy Garland / Mrs. Hoffman Wallner
Montgomery Clift / Rudolph Petersen (prosecution witness)
William Shatner / Capt. Harrison Byers (Judge Haywood's aide)

The performance of Spencer Tracy does stand out though. After all it's really his film. He was the type of man who didn't need to say very much for anyone to get what he was communicating. His facial and body expressions were just as detailed and expressive as the words that he said. My favorite line was towards the very end when Judge Haywood told the defense attorney that: just because it's logical doesn't mean that it's right. As far as I'm concerned those are words to live by. And he said them perfectly, it wasn't like some big speech. It was just said very nonchalantly which made it that much more important.

Marlene Dietrich as Mrs. Bertholt was another member of the cast who didn't need to say much because her entire aura said it all. She was probably the premiere entertainer of the golden era and although she has a rather small role in this film it is still one of her very best. Mr. Burt Lancaster was another extraordinary, larger-than-life actor, playing the role of Ernest Janning (one of the defendants). Dr. Janning said very little until he could take no more and when he finally spoke it was as if the floodgates swung open with all rapidity. Mr. Burt Lancaster is probably the only thespian who is talented enough to give this character such a heart and body and mind and make him appear almost victimized.

The film is over 3 hours long (190 minutes to be exact). Generally when I watch a movie that's more than 2 hours I tend to get restless and start thinking that the editor didn't do his job very well. ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" though is the perfect length because it tells the entire story, from beginning, to end. Perhaps it's no coincidence that there was a television series that was based on the original screenplay which predates the film.

Miss Judy Garland gives what is unequivocally her most decisive dramatic role ever. She enters the picture 90 minutes into the film and is only in 3 scenes, however she still captures just as much attention as the other stars. Besides her beautiful eyes that she could never hide under any circumstance, you'll almost be unable to recognize her because she looked and sounded so un-Judy Garland. There wasn't a touch of glamour in Irene Hoffman Wallner. Instead she was this scared and almost timid lady who had been beaten down by the ravages of the extreme brutality that was all around her. The second time she took the witness stand was perhaps my favorite part of the entire movie because all of a sudden Mrs. Hoffman Wallner became so transfixed and animated because of that vicious lie that the defense attorney tried to shove down everyone's throats.

""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is a larger-than-life, behemoth story that needs to be told because it articulates the effects of what happens when evil is afforded totalitarianism. They say sloth is one of the seven deadly sins and after viewing this film I can certainly understand why. It's also an important movie because there is no winner and it doesn't end with a happy ending, (at least as far as I'm concerned I didn't see anything happy in this picture). Instead, it's one of those rare movies which conveys that there's a thin line between man's benevolence and man's utter bankrupt corruption.",1224460800,3,4199,4.847977684797769
760287,4,630396155X,"Jeeze, I guess they'll let just about anything go out of circulation these days.
  Back in the pre-Schindler era, this film possessed considerable mana as one of the most effective of the early films dealing with Nazi war crimes--rather surprising, considering it was produced and directed by the mediocre Stanley Kramer, auteur of any number of simplistic '50s ""social problem"" pictures.
  Part of the film's power comes from its narrow focus: it deals with the little-known 1948 ""judge's trial"" rather than the earlier trials of the regime's big figures, allowing the film to concentrate on matters of justice rather than more sensational aspects.
  But most of the credit goes to the actors, who do an outstanding job virtually without exception, easily overcoming the film's slow pace and Kramer's obvious directorial failings. Of the principals, Tracy and Dietrich turn in effective variations of their customary roles of the period, the low-key man of decency and the aging but still potent high-class femme. Widmark is very fine here; this is one of his few ""good-guy"" roles that allowed him  to utilize the obsessive qualities apparent in his sociopath portrayals. Too bad he didn't do more like this.
  But the two outstanding performances are Clift and Lancaster. Clift plays a man driven mad by his suffering under the Nazis, in a portrayal that is excruciating to watch (with our knowledge that it reflects Clift's own personal agonies) and utterly unforgettable, for all that it lasts a total of fifteen minutes or so. Lancaster, as Dr. Emil Jannings, is another matter. He says almost nothing for the first hour-and-a-half of the film, but his presence dominates proceedings all the same. And when he at last  speaks, his portrayal of a man clinging to the last shreds of dignity, knowing he has not earned them and does not deserve them, is nearly as harrowing as Clift's. Beginning with ""All My Sons"" in the 40s, Lancaster did a number of pictures on this level when he wasn't playing acrobats or cowboys. It would be nice for some Amazonite to put together a List.
  (It should be noted that this is probably your sole opportunity to see William Shatner in a role in which he does not overact. In a just world the secret behind this, which Kramer kept to himself, would have been turned over to the UN for distribution to the international film community.)
  In the end, ""Nuremberg"" does not match its subject. No film could, but Kramer's implication that his particular brand of earnest liberalism is the antidote to government terror comes across as especially inane. It didn't help in Germany, and it wouldn't help anywhere else. But revealing what doesn't work paves the way toward discovering what does. On that level, at least, ""Nuremberg"" is a worthwhile effort.",1081728000,10,2786,4.963440860215054
760288,3,630396155X,"It appears there is an almost universal five-star rating for this film among Amazon reviewers. It is of course an important film. But it is also a self-important film. Its interminable running time of 186 minutes can be excruciating. Its release in 1961 came a year before Nazi henchman Adolf Eichmann was executed and the year after Preminger's ""Exodus"", so the film perhaps provided essential insight into wartime criminal responsibility, an issue obviously still with us. But to say that it today delivers its intended wallop is just not so -- it is too flawed artistically. First, Kramer's direction is obvious and plodding. The cinematography & editing provide long pans and zooms in courtrooms, long looks of knowing reactions, long silences, good Germans singing long lieder (""Germans love to sing"" says Dietrich) and long-winded observations by folks about everything from autobahns to death camps. In short, everything's too long!  Second, the writing makes you squirm -- I challenge anyone to name a major feature with as many repeated lines. Writer Mann apparently imagined that for this film repititions of superficial thoughts added up to deep ones.
Third, the acting is surprisingly wooden, given the talent. Lancaster as a Nazi Justice Minister alternately blusters and conducts soul searches; Garland as a 'collateral damage' racial victim gives an unusually unconvincing performance, for her; Dietrich's appearance as a Nazi widow is stiff and also odd, given her real-life staunch opposition to Nazism; Widmark as the prosecutor is just tiresome. Oscar-winner Schell as the defense attorney, allowed by Kramer to continuously yell in the court scenes, is full of sound and fury signifying practically nothing.  Tracey as the head judge is a brighter light, but still mostly sleep-walks except for two sterling scenes --first, as he announces the court's decision eloquently from the bench and second at the end of the film (which I won't give away for anyone who hasn't seen it).
The first major saving grace is the deeply moving performance of Montgomery Clift on the stand - the best piece in the entire 3 hours.  His singular portrayal speaks more of horror and responsibility than everything else in the entire movie. The other saving grace is the historical events it, unfortunately, rather ineptly presents.  (For my background see: ahlynde under People).",1041120000,16,2379,5.252631578947368
760289,5,630396155X,"Spencer Tracy stars as an American judge who travels to Germany in 1948 to take part in the Nuremberg trials.  For eight months he chairs the panel trying four German judges, one of whom is respected scholar Burt Lancaster.  Defense Attorney Maxmillian Schell makes the case that the men were simply following the law as written in Nazi Germany and cannot be held accountable for the brutality inflicted on those found guilty.  Prosecutor Richard Widmark argues that the men knew what they were doing and understood the fate of those found guilty and that they acted inhumanely.  Both men argue their cases well in a trial marked by emotion and great drama.  Judgment at Nuremberg is a powerful movie, since it deals with atrocities and wounds that may never be completely healed.  It also deals with a fundamental question that surrounds war:  Are people who are simply following orders (or the law as it exists in their country) to be held responsible for their actions and the fate of those they affect.  The film's screenplay is sharp, honest, and makes points on both sides, although emotion certainly affects how one answers the questions it raises.  More than anything, however, this movie is about acting.  Tracy is the rock that centres the film, the weight of his characters decisions ever present on his face and in his motions.  Schell and Widmark have plenty of chances to set off fireworks as the lawyers, and they take full advantage of the opportunity.  Lancaster is quietly strong and imposing, never getting much dialogue, but establishing a presence throughout the whole film.  Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift have brief scenes as victims of Nazi laws who testify against the defendants.  Both actors give outstanding performances, almost uncomfortable to watch they are so real.  Marlene Dietrich as the widow of an executed Nazi general is also very strong in one of her last performances.  Her scenes with Tracy are a joy to watch - two old pros who have seen a lot in their lives.  Judgment at Nuremberg is a long film, but it never lags.  Whether you simply watch it as a fine courtroom drama or take its messages about responsibility deeper, it is well worth watching. It deals with a part of our history we would probably like to forget, but never should.",1038960000,41,2283,4.825192802056555
760290,4,630396155X,"As a whole this film is impressive and important, but I think over all owing his tremendous dramatic power of the trial of the Nazi judges and the superb actors and interpretations, and also for the times in what the action happens -the beginning of Cold War- that procures a difficult and rarified ambiance and the insuperable wish of forget all, bury the crimes and not remember nothing by the German people.
However I find the making of this film have some rough, bad resolute details, as the representation of the speech English- German, the use of the microphones which are some confuse, awkward and other details not very well solved. A better filmmaker would have done a more polished and still better movie.",1035244800,,715,4.774193548387097
760291,5,630396155X,"There's a serious and timeless theme to this award winning 1961 courtroom drama of four former Nazi judges on trial for war crimes in occupied Germany in 1948.  It's not the story of the military leaders who had already been tried and convicted.  Rather, these were the men who survived the war by following the laws that ruled the nation.  There are deep moral questions here, such as what a judge's responsibility is.  After all, judges do not make the laws; they just carry them out.
Stanley Kramer, the director, had great material to work with.  The screenplay by Abby Mann was powerful.  And the cast included some of the finest actors of the time.  Spencer Tracy plays the judge, a widower from Maine with simple tastes.  He's a bit embarrassed to be given a large house, formerly occupied by a high ranking Nazi officer whose surviving wife is played by Marlene Dietrich.  The judge has a difficult job and he ponders it as he walks through the ruins of the city with wide-eyed wonder.  How could all of the horror have happened?  And who is responsible?
Responsibility, however, which is the theme of the film, is not so clear cut.  And as the trial progresses, all the shades of gray involved in this concept are brought to light.  Burt Lancaster is cast as one of the judges on trial, a dignified and respected man of the law.  Richard Widmark is cast as the prosecuting attorney, a colonel who had personally been present  at the liberation of the concentration camps.  And Maximilian Schell, in an Academy Award winning performance, plays the part of the defending attorney whose outstanding legal expertise keeps shedding new light on the evidence. Judy Garland is one of the witnesses, and so is Montgomery Cliff.  The entire cast is excellent. I found myself holding my breath as the twists and turns of the legal implications were examined with fine-honed brilliance.

The film takes up two videotapes and runs for three hours and six minutes and there is not one slow moment.  I watched it with a sense of total involvement.  I couldn't help but transpose all the legal and moral arguments to what is happening in our world today.  And my own mind went though its own little debate as to the subtleties of right and wrong and the hard choices that must be made. This is drama at its finest.  And a truly magnificent film.  I give it my highest recommendation.",1024704000,93,2377,4.6610576923076925
