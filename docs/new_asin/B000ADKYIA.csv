2385585,5,B000ADKYIA,"We first saw this on Dish Network, and decided that we would like to own it so that we could easily share it with out grandchildren.  It is beautifully organized; from the opening artwork that abstractly conveys the processes of life as it forms and grows to the final scene of the narrator leaving the forest, it is a superb treatment of fundamental characteristics of living things in accessible images and language.  It has the feeling of poetry, while remaining true to the technical foundations of its subject matter.

My only problem with it is that I wish that I spoke enough French to be able to hear it in the narrator's language, rather than being aware of the lip-sync problems of dubbing into English.  Fortunately, the material is such that its effect is not seriously impacted by the problem.",1187827200,4,806,4.735714285714286

2385587,5,B000ADKYIA,"We go out and buy the latest, coolest video monitors, plasma TV's, HD and widescreens, then what do we watch? Terrible sitcom TV programming, sports (ok, how many grassy helmets can we see in vivid XCU HDTV?), cartoons, and movies with enough car chases and explosions to bore Tarentino. NO LONGER!

Genesis is just amazing, as a date movie, for the kids (careful of the sex scenes though mom), and ESPECIALLY to take that new HD or widescreen technology for an awesome spin. The cinematography is just stunning, from close ups of the anglerfish eating a shrimp, to sky high views of Africa. Sure, it's been on cable on and off, but the DVD, although not the equivalent of movie quality due to compression, is still one of the most striking you'll ever add to your library. I've read that death counsellors are even showing this to terminal patients because it is such an ""upper"" about life in general, with hints at the continuity of consciousness.

The little bits of philosophy (""my atoms were a cloud in me and will become the wing of a butterfly"" etc.) are non-denominational and not controversial. We've had friends over ranging in age from 14 to 60 and each one has raved about the ""experience.""

Grab this one for a real treat, or give it as a gift that will be appreciated for years. Why do we buy a dvd anyway? After a few viewings we can recite the script by heart. Just to give us another jewel case to dust? Not so here, the images keep adding new dimensions after multiple viewings. This is the kind of DVD that the media and monitors were made for!",1158364800,24,1563,4.5159010600706715
2385588,4,B000ADKYIA,"This is a beautiful, bedazzling panorama of the evolution of life on this earth. We see what might have been the primordial chaos and fish rising from its vast waters and struggling onto land. We get a sense of the all the variety that has come from those first fateful flappings.

Most of the pictures are dedicated to the interactions of the ""lower"" animals - such as the amphibians, reptiles, and insects. Well, it would have been impossible to follow through and devote much time to all the mammals. So this movie is indeed more about beginnings.

I learned a new word from the DVD cover - the word ""griot."" I found that is an African storyteller, a person who perpetuates oral tradition. Such a griot is the narrator of this movie. And while I didn't really learn anything new about the development of life here, I felt privileged to be accompanying this movie's griot on his journey through time. He makes a much saner companion than Carlos Castaneda's famous ""brujo"" guide into and through the natural world.",1157500800,13,1015,4.696629213483146

2385591,3,B000ADKYIA,"This film is a wonderful experience through natures immagination.

Amazing visuals and great composition, BUT...

There is a lot of compression on the DVD.  The picture could be better.

The worst part about it all is that they dubbed the french african narrator!!  When I saw it at the theater they subtitled it, and it was a lot better.  I don't understand the reasoning for this, but thats what you get.

I seriously suggest watching this film though - just too bad the DVD isn't as good.",1140739200,10,491,4.574712643678161
2385592,5,B000ADKYIA,"I was apprehensive about showing this DVD to a sophomore biology class...how would they respond to dubbed English, and the device of an African storyteller linking wordless, though beautiful images, illustrating the diversity of life on earth?

The answer is that they were enthralled. After introducing it as a folkloric description of the origins of life, and emphasizing its represantation of the diversity of life, the students really enjoyed it. It provided a great visual lead in to a discussion on the characteristics and classification of life.

A wonderful supplement to - rather than replacement for - the essential PBS series on Evolution. (although you do need to pre-screen the Why Sex? DVD in that series for older students only - the bonobos, and the scientists who study them,  are just a wee bit too enthusiastic about their going at it for sophomores in general intro bio!

Too bad amazon doesn't have a photo of this great DVD to accompany the listing for identification. Highly recommended!",1139702400,14,1010,5.066265060240964

2385595,5,B000ADKYIA,"Many reviewers of this film rave about ""Genesis"". Rightly so. This film is a celebration of life, from it's beginning, to it's ""end"". Aside from the Biblical inference of it's title, it is not a ""religious"" film. On the contrary, this film will appeal to folk of ANY denomination, ANY religion.

The images are taken straight out of Nature, to lend clarity to the narrative, which is neither heavy-handed, nor frivolous. You get to see all the beauty of Nature, and how it all fits together, the intricacies that balance the whole. All the riotous, cacophonous, stately, and serene, rolled into one.

While there are parts that may require an explanation to younger viewers, this is a must-see film that will satisfy!",1208563200,2,717,4.868852459016393
2385596,5,B000ADKYIA,This video is a keeper and a must-buy for your DVD collection. It spans the entire panorama of life from the inception. The vivid color and narration is mesmerizing.,1206403200,2,165,4.724137931034483
2385597,3,B000ADKYIA,"In Claude Nuridsany and Marie Perennou's Genesis we are introduced to an African griot (Sotigui Kouyate) who tells in simple mythical language of the creation of the earth and the life upon it. This is a simple not scientific vision that will be quite appealing to younger audiences. The most impressive thing about this film is not the story, but rather the incredible images of nature. The film took six  years to make. In the film we witness the birth of the cosmos, the planet fire, the planet ocean, the first living things that pulled themselves out of the water to walk upon the land, and finally the eventual coming of chaos or decay in which life loses its battle with time.

This is an amazing film to watch. The lower rating is not based on what is presented in the film but rather upon the fact that I had witnessed the BBC series Planet Earth before I saw this one. Planet Earth presents the ecosystems of the planet using much the same imagery. Genesis presents us with the birth of animal life instead. If there is a real problem with the film its that it is presented in a dubbed English version with no option for the subtitled French language track.

The film presented in the standard DVD format loos amazing eventhough it is letterboxed to fit my screen. The Dolby Stereo 2.0 adequately captures Bruno Coulais score. The edition features a trailer gallery and an image gallery.

While this may no longer be the greatest nature documentary made; that distinction now goes to Planet Earth it is well worth watching. Its imagery and story will appeal to a large audience and its simple message is both heartfelt and eloquent.

As extraordinary as all of this imagery is, it is the film's sound design that takes it to another level. A quirky, electric mix of ambient sound, effects and music by composer Bruno Coulais and sound designer Laurent Quaglio gives the film its heart and its sense of humor. The scratching of a crab's claws against rock is amplified to amusing effect. Surprising blurps and bleats turn into symphonic compositions only to revert back to dissonance as the action reaches a crescendo.

""Genesis"" is a creationist's nightmare -- a feature-length endorsement of evolution. But it does so in an inherently spiritual manner. At times, the life through a microscope plainly blurs the line between man and animal.",1190419200,5,1292,6.920245398773006

8077943,5,B000ADKYIA,"Created in 2004, this documentary was written to show a wholesome history of the earth, its inhabitants, and their contrasting ways of life. One of the most interesting pieces of information I found was that in the film credits, the animals and natural events of the earth were part of the cast list. I love this because it encompasses the crucial message of the film. Aside from this, the style is which this film was presented was briefly talked about in class; the sheer detail it presented, contrasted with the vastness of life it talked about, gave the film a hold on the audience from the start.

The narrators ability to relate such things as conception to the whole of the universe kept my full attention. The narrator incorporated bits and pieces of his own story, which added humor and a clear example of the things he spoke of. With this voice in the background, we followed brief life segments of many animals, such as walking fish, parrots, jellyfish, and alligators. I loved that the only characters on screen were animals; each point the narrator made could be supported by the habits of these creatures. The process of emerging from the waters and building a life on land was entirely depicted within the lives of different, non-human species. The film gives a feeling of ownership, but for once, not in humanitys favor. The creatures that are featured, including birds, frogs, and alligators, are deemed the true descendants of the earth. The narrators ability to weave our human history into the plot is amazing and is done in a way that made me feel thankful.

I think often, we assume that humanity is the only species that can demonstrate the ability to adapt when in reality, animals have and continue to display the amazing effects of evolution and the complexity of life. When looking at the incredible traits of each featured species, we were given a more thorough look at the importance of balance in the environment. Growing up, we are taught that natural life can be categorized into tiers on a food chain and that there is no information beyond their dedicated place on the pyramid.

Another problem that this documentary unintentionally points out is the sheer lack of focus of Americans. It was mentioned in class that the film is made for a more focused audience, one that can sit still and watch a single segment for more than 10 seconds before becoming fidgety. Id never realized just how big of a problem this is! Now that I think about it, all of our movies are fast paced and to the point. Music, even, is tailored to keep peoples constant attention. One of the descriptions I found of the film said the following, Genesis allows filmgoers to view animal behaviors which are too small, too slow, or too difficult to normally be seen with the naked eye The fact that this film is distinguished by these things shows that we are too impatient for our own good. The progression to this point is in itself against nature; if we cant learn to sit still and be content, how do we expect to understand the intricacy of a universe that is on its own time schedule? We trick ourselves into thinking we can control it. We think that if we assign time to the universe, that it will obey. We assume that our progress in medicine will allow us to fast forward. Unfortunately, the universe doesn't listen to us. No matter how much control we think we have, how quickly we think we can solve something, we will never be content. Advances in medicine are soon to take the place of evolution; why wait hundreds of thousands of years for the human race to weed out its problems when we can simply target the genome of a human and alter it as we please? Dont get me wrong, I certainly think that our technology and intelligence is astounding and can be useful. However, the only way it will be truly useful to us as a species is if we understand that we are not in control. The more we propel ourselves into the future, the wider the gap we put between us and our animal counterparts. Thats the beauty of environmentalism. It isn't a religion, its not something that we can acknowledge but disregard. It is a reality, and one that does not (and should not) cater to our wishes as a dominant species.

This video definitely boosted my passion for such understanding. I want to think and speak like the narrator. I want to be thankful for my place in the web of time. I want to allow my story to blend with that of the earth, rather than focus on separating myself from it. In everything we promote as a society, we are distancing ourselves from our undeniable origins. Like it was said in class, every aspect of our lives is morphed and changed to build a wall between us and our environment. In the educational system, we learn black and white concepts within a building that is meant to protect us and make us feel detached from the outside world. We have a protocol about removing unwanted animal life from our campus. Each of these norms in our society are terrifying to realize!

8077947,3,B000ADKYIA,"This can be a fun watch. They call this Genesis, but it is not at all biblical. They have an African narrator, but it is not an African story. Sotigui Kouyat has a cool voice. He was Jacob in ""La gense"". He was Bhisma in ""The Mahabharata"". ""Genesis"" uses his face which is how I recognize him but the voice is either not him or the personality has been sterilized with sound equipment.",1258848000,,385,4.287671232876712
8077948,3,B000ADKYIA,"I loved the photography in this DVD, the pictures of the critters were awesome.  I didn't care so much for the endless shots of waves and mud.  I also found the narration irritating and probably would have enjoyed it muted more.  I'm not sure if it was the voice itself or the content.  The sound effects were not good either.  Though the giant Galapagos Turtles are huge, I'm quite sure they don't sound like a tyrannosaurus rex pounding through the grass, and I know that teeny crabs don't sound like a herd of locusts chewing their way through the savannah.  I would have been much happier with the natural sounds of the forests or jungles to back up the beautiful pics.

My recommendation would be to give this film a miss and instead go with one by the same director that is infinitely better - Microcosmos. THAT one I highly recommend.",1243209600,,841,4.529801324503311
