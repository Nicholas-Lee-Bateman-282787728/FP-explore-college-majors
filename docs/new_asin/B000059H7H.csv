7933403,1,B000059H7H,This movie has nothing to do with the original Fist of Legend. Then to add salt to the wound it has nothing to do with JET LI. Instead it stars JET LE (like who is that?). Geez the nerve of people trying to make money under Jet Li's name. Don't waste time or money if you are trying to add to you Jet Li's collection.,1022284800,3,317,3.8923076923076922
7933404,5,B000059H7H,"This flick is weird,but has some great [stuff] in it. The dude who is the lead is actually Jet Li's double,and the Russian dude is actually Van Damme's double,so it's the closest we'll get to seeing the two superstars doing it. It's directed by my main man,Robert Tai,who did all the 5 Venom flicks,so you know his action is tight! The Phantasm ninja are off the hook! And the Venom Centipede is in the flick! Jet Le is actually better than Jet Li in my opinion. He's got more moves than Li. The other parts of the flick are old school type fighting with the hi point being Bolo using RED nunchuks! That's new to me!!Count on the Wu Tang to give us some strange but tasty jewels! I would suggest getting they Hidden Chambers series with the suped up extra features though. Flix like Revenge of the Patriots,Fury in Shaolin Temple, Shaolin Kingboxer,etc. They are hands down the best kung fu DVD jointz out there!!Check my other reviews. Peace!",997315200,,943,4.552941176470588
7933405,2,B000059H7H,"Same thing happened when I bought Iron Monkey 2.. OK, here we go. Film opens, the character Chen Zhen is fighting a Japanese Officer. Good choreography, crisp film, etc. I'm excited now because Fist of Legend is my favorite movie. Narration starts about the history of the Jingwu school, and Chen Zhen's current occupation: traveling China, teaching Gongfu, helping the nationalists repel the Japanese, etc. Then, the film starts... Cut to some grainy old choppy-socky from back in the day (let me put it this way, Bolo Yeung looks younger than he did in Enter the Dragon). This nameless phantom movie obviously has nothing to do with Fist of Legend, but the dubbing tries to make it work. Then it occasionally CUTS to the NEW footage! The new footage is OK (except for the scene where Chen Zhen fights 3 fat ninja). There is one good fight where he takes on a Russian martial arts challenger (Ala ""Chinese Connection""). That's the only reason I gave it 2 stars. Bottom line, watch it for laughs if a friend has it, but don't purchase unless your a Fist of Legend junkie like me. The DVD does, however, make a great coaster for your Mountain Dew while you watch the original.",986342400,8,1175,4.653846153846154
