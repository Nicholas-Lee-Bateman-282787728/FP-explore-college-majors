4674950,4,B005FITIBO,"Was not sure how to rate this funny movie, but it made me laugh. Price was a little high, but anyway, this movie made me laugh. Thanks Amazon",1359936000,,141,4.071428571428571
4674951,2,B005FITIBO,"I tried to think of many ways to approach this film and describe it.  It was just so bizarre that it left me wondering whether the makers of this film were being serious or wether the whole thing was just supposed to be comically bizarre yet entertaining.  It seemed like some mexican soap opera makers decided to make a bad pseudo comedy movie version of Saving Private Ryan, HOWEVER, the film kept me strangely entertained.  I won't rush out and tell people to flock to see this film but some people might love the comedic approach.  Not the worst, but it won't make anybody's top list.",1353024000,,588,4.518867924528302
4674952,4,B005FITIBO,"This combo-genre film (action/satire/war/drug dealers/buddies) is an antidote to all the action films that are so routinely put out by Hollywood.  A Mexican drug dealer has to rescue his brother from Iraqi terrorists to win back his mother's approval.  He assembles a gang of bad guys a la dirty dozen and they cross the globe in search of the brother.  Good timing, and good fun, this film gives us the pleasure of enjoying our cliches even as we laugh at them.",1343433600,3,462,4.679012345679013
4674953,5,B005FITIBO,A Mexican gangster rounds up a sort of dirty dozen of Mexican archtype characters to go to Iraq to save his US soldier brother. Its kind of comedy action movie with decent production values. Or maybe national self-parody rather than comedy. Its a good imaginative premise and it almost never takes itself seriously.,1342569600,2,315,4.962264150943396
4674954,5,B005FITIBO,I just LOVE this movie.  You won't be disappointed.  Its both funny and well written- I liked it so much I bought a copy for my 70 year old Dad to watch.,1339200000,4,153,3.75
4674955,5,B005FITIBO,"This is a fun movie and our teenagers loved it.  The more familiar you are with stereotypes and telenovelas, the funnier this is.  Our 12 year old sometimes got tired of reading the sub-titles but she understands enough spanish to keep interested.",1332720000,5,247,4.857142857142857
4674956,1,B005FITIBO,"I really wanted to like this movie but it's just not a good movie. The story is great but the screenplay is too B-movie for my liking. The dialogue is full of telenovela cliches and the pacing is terrible. I was expecting a Mexican satire of action films, instead it feels like a bad rip off. The only thing that I can say was quality was the  sets. They do a better job of portraying the character of the story better than the director. A lot of the actors seem talented but you'd never know it by this film.",1327968000,,509,4.141414141414141

4674958,5,B005FITIBO,"I really can't say enough about this title. You really need to be familiar with stereotypes to get the fullest entertainment from this wonderful film. The story is entertaining, the cinematography outpaces most south of the border films. It is a wonderful film. Get this one; it is a pearl.",1326931200,,290,4.82
4675029,5,B005FITIBO,"A movie that will have you laughing from beginning to end!  Do not expect Hollywood computer graphics, just a great comedy that can be enjoyed by the whole family (PG-13)",1445212800,,170,4.666666666666667

4675032,5,B005FITIBO,"The DVD case was broken, but the DVD was fine.  Great movie. Good story line, good actors, good jokes. I don't speak spanish, but have some familiarity with Mexican culture, so the references were quite amusing. I appreciate this particular style of satire.  There are a few political references so how you can handle that will effect your entertainment, but not too much.",1440633600,,372,4.888888888888889

4675071,5,B005FITIBO,"This movie is constant laughs from start to finish (if you're moderately familiar with Mexican culture) with an engaging plot line, as long as you don't mind subtitles. Also, it arrived on time and in good condition from this seller.",1396483200,2,233,4.85
4675072,1,B005FITIBO,"Absolutely the dumbest freaking film ever made. It is just plain stoopid. Don't see it, it really, really, really sucks on all fronts. It is freaking dumb, pointless, silly, and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.",1390435200,,216,5.2

4675074,4,B005FITIBO,"I showed this movie to my Spanish class and they really liked it. I would have preferred to just show in Spanish w Spanish subtitles, but they wouldn't have understood. After a little bit, they didn't even realize they were reading the movie.",1373241600,2,242,4.651162790697675
4675075,5,B005FITIBO,"what a great movie!  not having seen saving private ryan, i don't know how, or even if, they came close to the action, but i agree with .fgd who said s/he smiled through the whole movie.  Fruitsalad also hit the nail on the head saying a great blend of comedy and drama.

here you have this hard-ass drug lord whose mother shames him into saving his soldier brother.  he has his, well, i can only describe him as a mayordomo, his mayordomo seek out a team to help in this undertaking.  the majordomo finds the most hard-ass criminals he can and convinces them to help julian find juan.

the chemistry between the six guys is immediate.  they have one heart between them.  they're each one of them whacked in their own way, but they work as a perfect unit to achieve their goal.

and there is enough seriousness to make the comedy even funnier.  one example i just busted out laughing is julian carrying juan and he hits juan's head on an overhanging pipe as they're running from the US soldiers who are shooting at them.

i'm familiar with miguel rodarte, jaime camil, marius biegai, jess ochoa and joaqun cosio, and it was a treat to see them playing something a bit different, especially miguel and marius.  a truly cute and funny movie with a touch of serious, a bit of sweet and a little sad.  and a really cute dog!",1372636800,3,1320,4.427385892116183
4675076,5,B005FITIBO,It may be a spoof of Saving Private Ryan but it's funny and it's interesting and it shows that even the worst Narco's need the approval of their mother.,1367452800,2,152,4.275862068965517
4675077,4,B005FITIBO,"The Mexican film industry is annually overshadowed by its behemoth up north.  Because of this, the Mexican film industry does not attract the funding needed to make international blockbusters, and has to rely on making thoroughly good films based on sound writing, casting, and acting.  This is one of those films.  Taking place in the modern world, the movie is about two brothers, Juan and Julian Perez.  The former is his mother's child, and follows the strict moral code of their mother.  The latter rises through the ranks of the Mexican drug industry to become the head of his own cartel.  Juan and mother immigrate to the US where the son joins the US Army and goes MIA in Iraq during the 2003 invasion.  Julian is sent to rescue him, and puts together a crack team of hit men and trusted servants to do so.  The meat of the movie is about this rescue mission, and the hilarity that follows.  Using cutting dialogue, some good action scenes, and adequate special effects; this movie is part A-Team, and part Saving Private Ryan.  Everything is in Spanish with English subtitles, so the viewer must pay attention to hone in on the drama between the key characters.  Overall, a very good and entertaining film.",1364169600,10,1215,4.710900473933649
