7004607,5,B00TEBVLM2,"Loved this show when it first came out, and now I get to enjoy it again.  The videos are pretty good in their quality.  One must remember that television shows from this area were placed onto film that wasn't designed to hold up forever.  I just wish ALL the episodes were available.  I've looked around and consistently find the same episodes  are missing.  I'm wondering if this is because they were lost through the ages.",1429488000,4,424,4.586666666666667
7004608,5,B00TEBVLM2,"As a big fan of this cult classic, and precursor to the Twilight Zone, I was excited to see Film Chest release a comprehensive collection of episodes spanning 6 discs. The stories reel you in with plot twists and turns, lending an almost Hitchcock-esque vibe to the collection. Wonderfully crafted, chilling stories that definitely give you that uneasy feeling. Each episode is introduced with a kitschy narration by John Newland, which sets the scene for the upcoming story. Although the quality varies from episode to episode (some look great, and some not so great), this is a fun collection to add to my library!",1429142400,8,616,4.9326923076923075

7004610,4,B00TEBVLM2,"You get 70 episodes on six DVDs, so around eleven/twelve episodes per disc. So I'm guessing there is some compression going on, but the videos are still watchable (so long as you're not expecting HD). I've sampled episodes from all six discs and given what the source material might have been - the quality of the video & sound is satisfactory.

As for the shows themselves - I found the ones I've watched to be pretty low-key (compared to the later Twilight Zone). It's almost you're watching more of a play that a television show.

For the price and what you get, I'm very happy with my purchase of this DVD set.",1428883200,11,614,4.473214285714286
7004611,5,B00TEBVLM2,"As opposed to some of these reviews, I actually have this set in hand and can attest to it's quality.  When upscaled,  some of  these episodes border on HD quality.  You can see every crease, pock mark and wrinkle....lol.  Some episodes are a little rougher than others; but never to the extent that they are unwatchable. The episodes in and of themselves are complete without missing segments or content. Only a few episodes are missing due to public domain and/ or poor quality issues.  The audio is great and clear with little or no muffled sound.  A couple episodes might have a low hum in them.  Bottom line: such a deal for a little over $11 bucks.  For fans of the series don't hesitate.....buy these now.",1428624000,46,712,4.587301587301587

The transfer is beautiful, crisp and clean, couldn't ask for better. Love the shows. It's not Thriller or Twlight zone, and it doesn't have to be.  It's One Step Beyond, an outstanding series on its own.

7004614,5,B00TEBVLM2,"Well, I received my order, then inserted the first disk into a BLU-RAY PLAYER, then adjusted my 65"" Samsung HDTV to ""automatically"" filter all potential video noise . . . and WOW.  I am truly amazed that the Seller did such a great job in locating a better film master from the 1950's.  This set is a LOT better visually than any previous set I have owned.  PLUS, it looks like playing older DVDs on Blu-Ray players gives an added boost electronically for a better viewing experience.

For the small amount of pocket change for this set, I highly recommend it!

PS:  I also pre-ordered the newly released box set of THE FUGITIVE too.  I expect this to be another great viewing experience.

My previous review before I received my order:
""Not sure if these disks are from 16mm film copies?  I have the One Step Beyond 12-Disk box set (Search Amazon for:  B0001EFUNC).  When I had a 32"" TV, the video was very poor, probably transferred from 16mm film.  Now that I have a 65"" HDTV, I expect the new video set will be more disappointing.  The set I have may have been originally filmed with TV film from the early days (like some Honeymooner episodes were ""filmed"", and was before the wide use of TV production videotape).  I do not imagine anyone remastering the $20 set, and it may be just a licensed copy of a copy of a copy.  I would like to hear from those ""verified purchasers"" that have actually received this newer release what they look like on a large size TV.""",1427241600,4,1468,4.4456928838951315
7004615,5,B00TEBVLM2,"First I'll talk about the actual content of this 6 disc set. One Step Beyond came out before The Twilight Zone. I use Twilight Zone as a reference because One Step Beyond is very similar in style except the stories in One Step Beyond are supposedly based on actual paranormal events. This adds an extra creepy factor by knowing that they could be true events. That is if you believe in the paranormal. You do...don't you? (Add sinister laugh here)

This collection, released by Film Chest Media Group, has seventy of the 96 shows. This is the most complete release to date. The episodes are hosted by John Newland. This guy has such a cool demeanor. He's a real pleasure to watch introduce each story with his calm and thought provoking delivery. I like the way he is actually on the set of each episode as it begins. He does his intro, then as action begins, he slowly walks out of frame. Each episode ends the same way with Newland walking back on the set to wrap up the story. I am a fan of John Newland now.

The acting is above average for what you would expect for a television show and the sets are highly detailed. Many actors in this series went on to be huge. It amazes me at how much work obviously went into each production. I am not sure why One Step Beyond is not better known. The writing is tighter than most any show of the era and the stories are genuinely captivating. My only negative comment is the fact that some of the episodes have hiss in them and the sound is a little muddy here and there but that aside this show is one of the best. I'd rather see the episode with a bit of hiss than not see it at all.

Lets discuss how Film Chest Media has packaged this set. All six discs are fit into a DVD case no bigger than a standard case. I love that. No odd shaped box or overly thick case. Just efficient use of space by using a DVD case designed to hold 6 DVDs. I also appreciate that they didn't cheap out by using those crummy 2 sided discs. These are screen printed very clearly on one side with each disc being a different color. Whoever did this simple act of kindness for us users deserves a medal....or at least a free lunch. Also included is an episode synopsis sheet.

I can't recommend this set enough and to top it off it is very affordable. Under 20 bucks brand new. Fans of Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Outer Limits will certainly enjoy the 30 hours of programing included on this set of discs.

I remember watching some of these as a child, and as with many childhood memories, there seemed to be a positive recollection. The good to the OK:  Black and white is still fine; cheap production values are understandable for the times;  still early television and views like a play. The not so good: the paranormal stories, at least per our evolution in viewing would be helped by upgrading; the stage/screen acting does not hold up well over time; louder is not better-too much screaming.

There was another SciFi/paranormal series produced about the same time that in my humble opinion, though more expensive, is the better deal.",1521849600,,708,4.8347107438016526

7004627,4,B00TEBVLM2,"I never saw this series ""in the day"" but it is a good look at what was being aired in the early days of TV. Folks steeped in the current ultra-modern, Hi-Def products available might be turned off by the simplistic presentation in these shows and some of the naive story-lines. For me it is an occasional fun return to a simpler and perhaps more naive time. Note that I do not consider these anything close to the standard of the first Twilight Zone shows, but in a way they have their own attractiveness. Listen carefully to the wording of John Newland's introduction. . .and include in your book report on these shows.

I recieved promptly, packaged correctly, and so far -play well! -For the price this is a fantastic bargain!! As far as I see, (on a tube small screen) -picture is very clear!! Stories are based on true stories, definitely hold my interest, and many of the actors seen from: Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and The Twilight Zone. I must have lived in this time frame, as I enjoy seeing these actors, and the host of the show. I've been a believer of ""The unknown"", and these shows are quite insightful! Its too bad television today declines to acknowledge, these kinds of themes or historical events (with the exception of A&E-interviewing film makers).--I enjoy clean, direct, language, intense story-telling, instrumental music alongside, shorter cuts, and genuine performances by the actors. --This set episodes on 6 disks, and a nice print out of each episode is included. --Intense subject matter, I'd say ok for mature children,-(12 an older)-as I used to watch Night Gallery, and Twilght Zone, around that age. At least it's something you can sink your teeth into, an somethings you can discuss with older  children, that their ARE events that CAN and have occurred that don't have a concrete explanation for. An as smart as the kids are today, they'd eat this up! It's too bad they don't offer a

It was lucky the producers had access to the MGM lot to make this show look higher budget than than it was.  It's neat to see a parade of established and upcoming performers in these shows, and most do a great job.  Mr. Newland adds an air of class and mystery to the proceedings.  Wish the series were restored and released in a complete collection....I hear archival copies exist.  I'll take what I can get in the meantime.  My rating is based on the quality of the series.

As a previous poster wrote, this is an excellent bargain; the best part is that each episode has been remastered. Each episode is seamlessly brought into view when the previous episode concluded.

In all the years before the advent of the DVD, I could always remember the haunting music score that was woven through each episode. The man responsible for that score was Harry Lubin

For those who know this series better than I, I have one request of you, please!

In one of the episodes, John Newland speaks about a ""seed experiment"" that was printed in the April 15, 1959 issue of Time Magazine.

If anyone comes across this mysterious ""seed experiment"" episode, would you please post the info here and which episode you saw it in?

Excellent narration by John Newland. Some histrionics and overacting.

7004729,4,B00TEBVLM2,"Great set at a great price! If you're a fan of the Twilight Zone, then you'll love this one. UPDATE: I've finished watching all 70 episodes and wanted to let everyone how the set was. Everything was good quality. As good as any of the old black and white television shows. This is one of those early childhood shows that I used to watch with the family. Its brought back lots of good memories. Like I said above, its very similar to the Twilight Zone so, if you're a fan of that one, you should enjoy this one. I've done a little reading about the series as I watched the various episodes and these were produced between 1959 and 1961 and they were all said to be based on real life events and situations. I have absolutely no complaints about even a single episode from the set but I do have one complaint about what ISN'T there. For some reason, the makers of this set decided to leave out 26 episodes. While I was reading up on it to see if these were really based on true events (they were, from what I've read), I found out that there were 96 original episodes. They gave us 70 in this set. I'm really clueless as to why a company would go to the time and expense to produce a set like this and not make it a complete set. Just doesn't make any sense. The other episodes are out there. I've seen listings for the entire series. BUT, reviews I've seen of those sets seem to say that they weren't produced with the care that this one was and they're inferior quality. That being said, I'll settle for this incomplete set until something better comes to market. With that in mind, I still highly recommend this set!",1463875200,4,1617,4.287581699346405
7004730,5,B00TEBVLM2,I grew up in early 1960's but I guess the 3 channels we received didn't broadcast this series. What a wonderful group of stories. Like most TV shows from that time period these are very grainy at times but I expected that for the technology at that time. The series does not have the soon to be well known actors like The Twilight Zone either. But it is well worth the purchase for the genre.,1463184000,,392,4.24

7004734,2,B00TEBVLM2,"This DVD is a good-quality remastering of the original TV series, but THERE IS ONE EPISODE MISSING! I want my money back. It is the very last episode, and it was done differently from any of the others, in that it was a documentary about the real-life exploits of John Newland himself and some of his intrepid colleagues searching the jungles of Central America for the fabled 'sacred mushroom'. They heard it enhanced ESP abilities, and they're really going to find out! I viewed this astounding politically-incorrect episode when it first aired in 1961. There is one glaringly obvious reason why this episode was expurgated; actually, CENSORED; and if you do find it on a website where it is freely available, you will see why.

7004751,5,B00TEBVLM2,"This is a wonderful collection of episodes for a great price. The picture in most episodes is very clear and just as I remember them from my youth.  I'm VERY happy I bought this set.  It makes me want to buy them all.  I ordered another set of 40, ""The Best of ..."" but every one of the episodes in that set is included in THIS one.  So, this was a really great deal.  I love it!

As kids, we ALL loved this show, and Im a senior now, watching episode after episode on a stormy winter's day.  I lost electric, my internet, WiFi, telephone, et al.  But I have a generator!  So I went to my DVD/Blu-ray shelves for something to watch.  And I chose these.  I'm having a terrific time!  And, I just bought two more sets to give as gifts.

For those who never saw this series, it is an anthology of stories about the abnormal.  I learned all the words relating to ESP watching this show.  The stories are taken from ""true"" events.  The creators took the time to search out reports of these events, and put them into a great series of shows.  No gore, no monsters, no sex, just pure entertainment.  And John Newland is a terrific ""host"" as he challenges you to ""believe it or not.""

The entire series had 96 episodes, according to IMDB.  And, Id love to get my hands on the missing 26,  but I cant find them anywhere.  My guess is that those episodes have been lost to time and decay.  Too bad because every episode of this show had us mesmerized as kids, and they still do.",1455408000,3,1468,4.182795698924731

Some of the stories are quite interesting and some of them tug on your heart strings. There are a lot of episodes to watch so anybody can find something of fascination.

Granted a lot of the stories seem made up but even so they can get kind of creepy with their beyond the grave theme.  If you are a fan of EC comics from the 1950's these are kind-of a milder journey but still good.  The stories remind me of some of the ghost story comic books printed by Dell and DC in the 1960's.  Certainly comparable to, if not up to the same quality as ""The Twilight Zone"".  I really enjoy seeing all of the famous stars in their early roles.  Cloris Leachman and Louise Fletcher (Nurse Ratched) used to have quite the curvy figure!  Who knew?  And it's great to see Suzanne Pleshette in one of her early roles.

7004786,4,B00TEBVLM2,"Much better then you might expect.  Predates The Twilight Zone, which is my all time favorite anthology show.  Each story is based on supposedly true events so that gives them an added interest.  John Newland hosts and directs most if not all of them.  An interesting Ivy league-like presence with a nice, commanding voice.  Like many Serling intros, Newland enters into the scenes with the actors, which I've always liked as it brings an added dimension to bridging the worlds.  Always interesting.  Sometimes touching, which I wasn't expecting.  Fun to spot up and coming actors and of course all of the great character actors from that time.  The quality of the prints are not the best, and end lines seemed to be clipped off, sometimes mid-sentence.  Is this the best versions they could find of these shows?  But it is a great price for 70 episodes if you are just interested in the stories.  Descent and clever effects for the time and small budgets I'm sure they had.  The destruction during the San Francisco Earthquake episode is a mixture of practical sets and stock footage spliced together in an interesting way.

Remember, however, that the ""facts"" of these stories came out of the mouth of Hollywood and do not, at least in some cases, bare any semblance to the truth, despite what John Newland claimed in his intro. Remember the ""Quiz show"" scandals back in the day? Anyone? Indeed, I know of one story here (the episode concerning  U-147) that is pure, unmitigated Hollywood BS from start to finish.

An added bonus footnote comment:

For a show of the '50s... before TWILIGHT ZONE and THE  ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW, etcetera, the calibre of this show was
waaaaaaaaay ahead of its time. I can remember that during that time period there just WASN'T a lot of black people on
TV. Mayberry, North Carolina; The Cleavers in Mayfield; Ozzie & Harriet... you name it NO black folks; not even neighbors.
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Step-Beyond/dp/B000RPCT5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Step Beyond</a>&nbsp;not only had black people in several episodes, they played parts more important than porters and side-
kick-comedy-relief characters.
Heroic parts; intelligent, meaty, parts. Just one more thing I like about this all-but-forgotten classic from the---excuse me---
black'n'white days of television.

OK, it's not blu ray quality, but it's light years better than a VHS ever looked, or typical dollar store crap or the original TV viewing quality.  Complain if you want, but at this price, it's an amazing value IMO. Not a 100% complete set, but at this price only fools complain. And they will and do. I'll enjoy  all 70 episodes.

If you've already purchased public domain prints of these episodes, keep your money! This release is put out by a company called the Film Chest Media Group who touts that they do film restoration. When you see their name...RUN. I've never seen anything they've released that didn't look terrible. Just look up ""The Black Book"" dvd  on Amaon. The comments on their ""High Definition"" print tells the story, while the Sony release from 3 years ago is excellent for only a few dollars more.

The last episode on the disc is shown on the inlay card as season 3 episode 33 and is titled ""Midnight"" when, in fact, the correct offering should have been ""The Tiger"". I don't know what television series this episode comes from but it doesn't play at all like a ""One Step Beyond"" episode, although fans of old black and white episodic t.v. may enjoy it. Anyway its nice to see several episodes of OSB that I haven't seen before or at least not since I was a kid.

7004824,5,B00TEBVLM2,"This series came to my attention through a friend.  He passed me some grainy digital copies but I found the stories gripping.  Then I found out there was this collection for very inexpensive.  I have a large new high quality Vizio TV and the picture quality is very good.  It may not be digital remaster quality, but it is very good.  I have heard no problems with sound so far.  Some people are bashing this set, and maybe the first season remaster one is better, but this is 70 of the 96 episodes of this show and well worth the purchase & watch.  We are Twilight Zone fans and we are thrilled with this set.  I don't, though, think there is closed captioning, but you can play episode by episode or play all which is great for those times my husband wants to crash out to a DVD.

7004825,5,B00TEBVLM2,"I won't bother reviewing the actual program assuming that most people who are considering purchasing this item are familiar with the program itself.

Prior to purchasing this 6 DVD, 70 episode set I was interested in knowing whether or not the episodes were complete or edited syndicated prints as well as a few other technical and quality concerns.

I hope that this review may answer some of those questions for potential buyers.

Knowing that most Public Domain inexpensive dvd sets such as this will vary in quality this set is no different.

Although I have not watched every episode I have scanned through most of them.

Overall quality throughout is Very Good with many episodes being very clean with some others being not quite as good.

However ALL are very watchable.

Audio seems to be reasonably clear and sound level is adequate and not too low if watching on a television without an outside amplified source.

The majority of the episodes (I would say somewhere between 40-50) seem to be complete and uncut with a running time between 25:00 and 25:30 minutes each.

Another 10-20 episodes are slightly shorter at app. 24:30 to 25:00 minutes in length.

The remaining episodes are edited syndicated prints running just under 22:00 to 24:00 minutes each.

At least one episode which I watched in its entirety had the original ""Alcoa Presents"" opening as opposed to the more familiar and common ""One Step Beyond"" opening. This was a pleasant surprise.

I have several other public domain releases of this program and this is the best of them so far.

As to the remaining 27 episodes they can be found on the bootleg dvd sets being offered.

The bootleg sets can be found relatively cheaply on select sites catering to collectors.

Those sets also vary in quality with a mixture of syndicated and complete episodes.

If you are a completist you may want to pick that set up as well since it appears some of those episodes (mostly from season 3) may not be in the public domain and are not likely to be officially released.

I hope someone found this review helpful.

As an afterthought I just wanted to add one more thing if you're still skeptical about buying this set.

I compared all of the season 1 episodes on this set to that of the ""Official First Season"" Paramount set. The quality on that set is better...lets say a 10 rating. These Season 1 episodes are I would say a strong 7 to an 8. The ""Paramount"" episodes run a few seconds longer which is easily explained by a Paramount/ CBS logo which appears at the conclusion of each episode.

Actually I wouldn't be surprised if the same original source material was used without the cleanup process.

So here it is...You can get 22 first season episodes at about half the cost of the ""Official"" set plus an additional 48 episodes for about half the price.",1429488000,276,2820,4.691056910569106

8701294,4,B00TEBVLM2,"A great series, overshadowed by Twilight Zone and Outer Limits, but often creepier than either of those shows.
Thanks to the reviewer here who listed the episodes on the disks... it sounds like this series is still not completely available.  That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

One of my favorite episodes is here, The Sacred Mushroom.  This breaks the format of the series a bit, where host John Newland takes a visit to see where these mysterious vision-inducing fungi are found, and then ingests some himself, and is tested to see if his extra-sensory abilities are enhanced.  (They seem to be, a bit at least.)  What we're watching is the usually dapper, urbane John Newland eating psilocybin mushroom right on camera for a network TV series, and being filmed while he's tripping-- and he still projects his usual sense of cool.  (This was in 1961, psilocybin was legal, almost unknown in western culture, and the whole concept of ""psychedelic"" or ""tripping"" was a few years still in the future.).  This episode is rarely seen on reruns now due to the subsequent controversial nature of the subject.

Mostly you'll get plenty of the odd, uncanny, quietly creepy episodes that made the show great.  I hope someday the entire set of episodes will be properly released.",1527379200,,1278,4.825688073394495

8701296,5,B00TEBVLM2,"How odd I never knew about this series while growing up in the era of  B&W TV and having only 3 or 4 channels plus PBS available to view in one's living room.  You know when going to the movies was a big big deal - do I need to explain why?  Anyhow  One Step Beyond is something I wish I had known about decades before now! The first TV series presenting a one half hour episode dramatically recreating a bizarre mysterious or unusual occurrence or event that  HAS BEEN verified and is known to have really happened.  Of the 90 episodes in this series I have seen maybe 60 or 70 - some episodes are apparently lost to us because of careless archiving practices I assume - and of those episodes I watched only around 15 of those stories / events were known to me - the rest of them were completely new and very, very fascinating.  So glad I now have my own DVDs to watch as some of these I will want to see again - maybe even 3 or 4 times.  Highly recommended to anyone who likes the odd the unusual or the mysterious and unexplained real life events that happen in this world.",1525564800,,1076,4.139423076923077
