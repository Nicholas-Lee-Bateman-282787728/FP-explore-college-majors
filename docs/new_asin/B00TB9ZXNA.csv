7004300,5,B00TB9ZXNA,great movie !!!,1430092800,,15,4.333333333333333
7004301,4,B00TB9ZXNA,"Pretty decent movie. Writing could have been a little better concerning transitions, and the Dr. could use a few more acting classes.  He underacted in a few places and overacted in others.  Maybe, that is also the director's fault; however, it was still pretty good.",1516060800,,267,4.911111111111111
7004302,2,B00TB9ZXNA,"Spoiler alert............

I have watched Kenny and Karen characters since they were on the In Between Friends webisode and this is the only reason I watched the movie. I was ok with the ""stale"" acting because of being used to their prior work. The overall message of having better communication and not putting work before loved ones was clear...however what was unclear was the underwhelming job the writer did with trying to make this into a psychological thriller. I'm left with a few questions:
1. What was the purpose of having the break-ins? They did not drive the plot.
2. I may be mistaken but why was Kenny's cousin, the gambler, one of the responders to the break in at David's? Was he a detective? If so his life portrayal as a ""scrub"" does not line up and does nothing for the story.( Maybe I missed it but did his cousin have something to do with Kenny going to prison?) It was as if the writers tried to figure out how they could get David and Kenny's cousin in the same room some how just so that David could recognize him later.
3. Who broke into Kenny's home was it his cousin?
4. When Karen showed up with David to see Kenny's art show Karen didn't even flench. That is an unnatural reaction to being found out.
5. Why did David feel like it was so important for Kenny to tell Karen,  which of whom he'd just met, that he was seeing a therapist? There are other preliminary ways to gain trust.
6. I judge the overall quality of a movie by its ending; which is why I gave it 2 stars. The ending was unclear, I reckon David ended up in jail for murder or attempted murder. Apparently he thought he murdered Kenny and Karen because when they showed up for visitation he looked confused toward Karen and Karen said, basically: That wasn't me but my sister you killed or tried to kill. Soooo did Karen have a twin sister? I was most perplexed by this because it couldn't have been her sister because Kenny was there pursuing her and there was the same exact dynamic between Kenny and Karen. If it had been Kenny and Karen's sister, right before David caught them there would have been a different dynamic.
7. Also at the end when Karen scooted out of the way so that the audience could see the surprise that Kenny was still alive, David did not flench at all. This all should have been a surprise to him and the audience.
8. Kenny stated that he thought about getting revenge on David for messing with his girl but decided against it....but the whole story focused on his revenge...
9. I kept asking why David felt so overwhelmed. It seemed all he had to do besides his regular work was win an award for which he had to write an essay or something. I can understand being daunted with the task but it didn't seem that THAT should've been the thing that made him so overwhelmed.
10. Lastly, why exactly was this movie titled Intuition? None of the characters had any real intuition. If anything David should have had a gut feeling that Kenny was messing with his fiance throughout the movie but he didn't find out or seem to have suspicion of the two until he saw with his own eyes...that's not intuition.  Kenny didn't have intuition either because everything he ""assumed"" and discussed to David about Karen were things he knew just by being with her. You can't say Karen had intuition because her accusations toward David were based on their past, her insecurity and lack of trust with his present actions.
A better ending of the movie would have been with David thinking he'd killed Karen and Kenny. Karen walks in and says the speech that Kenny stated and then Kenny comes to the door to retrieve Karen, leaving David in perfect disbelief . Then there should've been a flash back of what actually happened that fateful night. While the scene kept cutting from David's bewilderment to the night everything went down hill. It should've ended with David thinking back on some of the things Kenny stated that alluded to him being with Karen and maybe David banging on the glass yelling and realizing he just lost everything because of his pride and poor communication.

7004359,5,B00TB9ZXNA,"So first this movie being an independent film was AWESOME!!! I hope some film company comes across and pays to redo this!! Film quality is low and the make up effect needs to be improved. The writer could use more pointers on how to farther confuse the audience. Watching this film reminded me of the secret window with Johnny Depp. I believe more films like these should come to light because they cause the viewer to recall clues that help solve the problem. Like blues clues for adults!!!

Plot spoiler: A troubled man coming from prison is in need of counseling. The counselor he chose is arrogant and forgetful with problem at home. Karen has been reaching out to her husband in hopes he finally hears her. When these characters comes together they create a whirlpool of passion and intensity. Family should always be there for each other seen or not.

I see that many people who watched the film were left confused thinking they knew what they watched. Yet again the writer and film effects help create the picture of reality and what people think they know. I say that if make up had a better quality then you would have been able to see yes Karen and Sweetie look alike but they are not the same person!! (twins)  maybe you could say the actress skill could have been improved. However these types of films are always difficult on the cast. I commend her for her efforts. I really hope someone re do this and make it to the big screen!!!! this would have people scratching their heads!!!!",1475280000,3,1496,4.553903345724907

7004433,2,B00TB9ZXNA,"Kenny Franklin (Julian Hanlan) is an artist and poet who has been in and out of the prison system. He is currently out of prison and has been assigned a therapist David Francis ( Ladele Tojoula) who has memory issues and is not taking care of business at home with his wife Karen (Ashley Jean-Pierre). David has been out late treating Kenny, while Karen believes he is having an affair. She ventures out on her own and coincidentally hooks up with Kenny the patient.

The film is long and slow. The dialogue comes out slow with long pauses. The acting was boring. The sound was hollow. Kenny was an annoying character. Who robs a place of CDs and remote control units?

Over all tho it's okay if your watching it on Amazon Prime, but if I went to  even the Dollar Theater I would been mad.

I'm a thinker and it took me a second before the revealing scene to actually catch on that the wife had a twin, I was truly impressed by how even the mannerisms of the cast didn't give it away. But Kenny was cold blooded bruh, he knew the twin could get killed and he still pressed it. The woman playing the bartender is the move tho",1531612800,,425,4.071428571428571
