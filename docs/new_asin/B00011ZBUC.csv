8005287,5,B00011ZBUC,This DVD rocks. it's kind of better than the other DVDs because it shows the final battle between Ran and Mami. Also it shows when Aya was almost heartbroken when Rei rejected Aya. I thought that Rei and Aya would make a good couple but Rei was right that first love is too heavy but I don't think he should have rejected Aya. Back to the Ran and Mami story. I don't think that they should have made Mami that confident in the beginning when she was beaten by Ran many times and now she thinks she can beat her. In the second episode I like the way they showed more information of when Miyu was in the gang and how she met Yomato. In the first episode I like the way they did the snowball so realistic. I also thought that Yuuya was a good effect in the DVD. It shows how jealous Yuuya was when Ran accepted Tatsuki as her boyfriend.,1078012800,2,833,4.116564417177914
8005288,4,B00011ZBUC,"This series still hasn't let me down with another batch of good episodes that left me wanting to see the next volume as soon as possible.
The first episode starts out with both Ran and Mami winning snowboards so you know what's bound to happen when they both go to an indoor snowboarding course.  Yuya is also determined to tell Ran how he feels and try to win her away from Tatsuki.  Aya also wants to tell Rei how she feels about him but is too nervous to do so.  It's a great beginning to the DVD.
The second episode deals with the second anniversary of Miyu and Yamato's meeting.  The story is told in flashback, showing a younger version of Ran and Miyu, how they ended up becoming friends, and how Yamato helped get Miyu out of the gang.  This is a great and funny episode, especially to see a younger Ran and how she decided she was going to rule Shibuya.
The third and fourth episodes are part of a two part arc where the whole gang goes to an amusement park.  Ran and Mami have yet another battle here and might actually become if not friends, at least they'll maybe stop being enemies.  Aya also works up the courage to try to tell Rei how she feels about him.  I won't tell you how it all works out because I don't want to ruin if for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.  Besides, the story is still a work in progress.
So, I highly recommend this series to anyone who has been hesitating about whether or not they should see it.  I can't wait for volume 5 to come out now.",1077321600,,1479,4.176056338028169
