8654479,5,B00JXG2MYY,"I dug Lewis since his early days on Letterman. This collection has all the classic DVD's that  were shamefully never distributed that spans over 40 years from his SNL classic in 1979 to his Bottom Line killer HBO standup speciall and the cult film Drunks with Lewis as a junkie surrounded by an astonishing all-star cast to a surprise documentary of his former Hollywood home/museum homage to the arts, this is a must for all RL fans. .No wonder his pal Rolling Stone Ron Wood did the cover art!",1403654400,3,495,4.561797752808989
