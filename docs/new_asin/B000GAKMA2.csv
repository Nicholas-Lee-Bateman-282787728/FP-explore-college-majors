8129805,5,B000GAKMA2,"Ancient Mysteries:  Sacred Places is one of many quality videos from the Ancient Mysteries series produced by the A and E Network.  This episode (capably narrated by Leonard Nimoy) introduces the viewer to six sacred places in the world:  Tibet in China, Easter Island in the South Pacific, Stonehenge in England, Chaco Canyon in New Mexico, Machu Picchu in Peru, and Jerusalem in Israel.  With each place we see numerous images and learn about its spiritual or religious significance.  For example, Jerusalem is the home to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam; Machu Picchu was likely used as a place to worship the gods of the mountains and the sun.  While we know much about these sacred places, locations such as Easter Island and Stonehenge still have unanswered questions and possess a mysterious aspect to them.  In sum, Sacred Places is a good introduction to these fascinating locales.",1470009600,,891,5.061643835616438

8129807,1,B000GAKMA2,"""A&E Sacred Places,"" A.K.A. ""Ancient Mysteries; Sacred Places,"" is a DVD documentary presentation of a few mysterious, sacred, or protected sights of discovery around the globe; Jerusalem, Machu Picchu, Easter Island and others.  The only redeeming quality of this DVD is that the narrator is Leonard Nimoy.  Otherwise I'd chuck the disc and use the case for one of my movies I watch often and broke the case of the GOOD one.  This DVD needs to be about half as long, and would have been if they hadn't shown the same footage of artwork, architecture, or shortened the interviews with scholars and alleged experts - some of it, three or four times the same exact thing - so they could stretch out the time for the DVD to 50 minutes.  With my failing health and lack of financial resource, I was hoping this would at least TRY to substitute for a trip actually visiting the places in this documentary.  There's another hope smashed to smithereens.  I have an opinion that nearly all of the Arts & Entertainment documentary DVD's are for the uninformed, younger group of viewers who really aren't all that interested, just killing an hour while they wait for a ride to somewhere besides boring old mom and dad's house.  I enjoyed ""Napoleon Dynamite"" a thousand times more than this DVD documentary. Capieche?",1318723200,4,1306,4.777777777777778

A fascinating dvd, would like it to have been longer and even more embrassive.",1212537600,3,148,4.321428571428571
