8217971,4,B0002VJ314,"I really enjoyed the series. I prefer this set over the remastered. Video and sound is great. Since I got my copy used, I am missing the chapter insert card that fits inside the jewel. If anyone is willing to scan theirs in (front & back) and email it to me... I would really appreciate it.

Thanks.",1205971200,,299,4.245614035087719
