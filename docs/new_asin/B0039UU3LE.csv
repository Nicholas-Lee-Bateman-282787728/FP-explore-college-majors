4098005,5,B0039UU3LE,This is one of my favorite movies and it was hard to find. I was very excited to find this movie and was even more excited that it arrived in such a timely manner. I was pleased that the quality of the picture was just as good as I remembered it to be the first time I saw it on TV years ago. I plan to visit this seller again for more movies that I would like to add to my library.,1330214400,8,382,3.6707317073170733
4098006,5,B0039UU3LE,I love this movie.  Andy Griffith is one of my all time favorite actors.  He is fantastic.  I highly recommend this movie.,1313107200,7,122,4.454545454545454
4098007,4,B0039UU3LE,"I too have seen this movie from Andy Griffith years ago on tv. I enjoyed it very much. The only thing about the
Archive movies are they sometimes have issues with them in my dvd player. I had to send one back to Warner and the one I got in return
I could play after trying for about half an hour finally got it to play. I just want everyone to be aware they do sometimes have probems. This can be order through TCM as well.",1276646400,16,423,3.9302325581395348
4098008,4,B0039UU3LE,I enjoyed the mystery series years ago. I really liked this one. When it came out I had to have it!!! The whole family watches it weekly.,1276646400,11,137,4.111111111111111
4098009,5,B0039UU3LE,I enjoyed this movie a lot. I saw it a while ago on T.V. and that is why I purchased the DVD.,1273104000,12,93,3.272727272727273
4098010,5,B0039UU3LE,"This was the first of two Andy Griffith, TV movies, playing a small village Police Chief in Jasper Lake. I wished they had made more in this series. He plays this part with a more serious tone and I believe he should have played more serious rolls then what he did. His acting ability was never fully appreciated. It appeared everyone just wanted him to be the comic. If you loved Tom Selleck as a small resort town Police Chief, 'Jesse Stone' in a series of movies, then you will enjoy these. The second one is titled ""Deadly Game"". Both of these films can be purchased at Warner Brother's web site under their ""Archive Collection's"" for $19.95 each.",1263254400,32,651,4.52542372881356

4098058,5,B0039UU3LE,"I have always loved Andy Griffith from Sheriff Taylor to Matlock so I was delighted when I came across a series of movies he had made in the seventies in which he plays a sheriff in a ski resort.  He never disappoints and this particular movie The Winter Kill will keep you guessing.  Add to the suspenseful story, good acting and beautiful snow setting, and you will enjoy this movie to the full.  Highly recommended.",1445731200,2,418,4.546666666666667

4098071,5,B0039UU3LE,"Andy Griffith stars as the sheriff when he discovers that something strange is going on in his town.  This series of three movies will leave you begging for more, but these were the only three he made.  If you like the JESSIE STONE series, these are along the same line and will keep you focused from the beginning to the end of the story.  They are not shown on television anymore, but the one time they did show them I watched all three.  It took me awhile to find them on line, but thankfully I did.",1437523200,2,502,4.197916666666667

4098077,4,B0039UU3LE,"I just loved the old Andy Griffith telemovies.  Great locales, likeable guest stars and engaging storylines.  Winter Kill exudes an easy going charm and is still a joy to watch decades after its original screening.",1431216000,,214,5.085714285714285
4098078,4,B0039UU3LE,Andy Griffith gives a true acting in this movie. Although he spent most of his time in weekly tv shows he was a superb actor in movies.,1431043200,,135,4.037037037037037

4098123,5,B0039UU3LE,"This is a B grade movie but I love it! It was filmed in the spring so the snow is lousy. At one point Ruth McDevitt is warming her hands over an empty fireplace but it has a great cast of characters, a fairly good plot and if you married a ski bum and love the mountains, winter, and snow, it'll do!",1408838400,,299,3.838709677419355

4098145,5,B0039UU3LE,"The Winter Kills is the first of three failed attempts to launch a crime series for Andy in the 70's.
A masked killer reading a journal is killing citizens of a small ski town that Andy is the sheriff of. As the bodies pile up and the town panics, Andy closes in on the killer.
 Well made and creepy,  this movie is a fine piece of the 70's crime shows.",1399248000,2,353,4.0285714285714285
4098146,4,B0039UU3LE,Andy Taylor solves a murder in a small town ski resort. This is great stuff! Watch alone on a rainy night for full impact.,1398297600,,122,4.125

4098148,5,B0039UU3LE,"I was surprised at how much I liked this movie. I've seen a few of Andy's movies made after he left The Andy Griffith Show and most were awful. Winter Kill is a VERY good movie, I enjoyed it very much. Look for some characters that also appeared on the Andy Griffith Show.",1391904000,,272,4.150943396226415
4098149,3,B0039UU3LE,"This is an odd movie. I've got mixed feelings about it. The plot is somewhat suspenseful and there's a fairly interesting mystery, and I think Griffith does an admirable job of playing (big surprise) a small town lawman. But I found the flashback scenes and the ridiculous sound effects of the shotgun to be cumbersome and goofy. Some of the other characters were rather wooden, too. Kind of plays like a made-for-TV movie that someone tried to roughen up for a harder rating. Recommended for Griffith fans, but otherwise would probably suggest something else.",1391126400,,560,4.968085106382978
4098150,4,B0039UU3LE,I've seen this movie before (many years ago on TV).  I liked it enough that when I saw that it was available on DVD I bought it.  It has a good plot and decent acting.  A nice whodunnit movie.,1387929600,,192,3.871794871794872
4098151,4,B0039UU3LE,Made for TV movie.  Good suspenseful plot with Andy Griffith as a small town sheriff.  I love his whit in all of his roles.,1386547200,,123,4.083333333333333
4098152,5,B0039UU3LE,"I have always enjoyed Andy Griffith, and this movie is one of a series of three that I remember, and it is a good movie.  I truly enjoyed this movie and waiting for the other one called ""The empty grave""  .",1384128000,,206,4.0
4098153,5,B0039UU3LE,This is perhaps one of my favorite Andy Griffith movies!  It is really something to see him in blue jeans & turtle neck sweaters & actually see his body!  WOW!  I've watched this movie 4 times since receiving it!  Andy Griffith...WOW!,1376179200,8,234,4.634146341463414
4098168,4,B0039UU3LE,"I have seen this on cable channels and remembered it as a really good mystery with an unusual plot.  The snowy scenery of a mountain community is beautiful, and it adds to the interesting plot and good acting of the characters, many of  whom will be remembered. I believe it may have been Nick Nolte's first film...or among the first.

I don't need to give away the plot; it isn't necessary. The movie is watchable more than once, and it doesn't lose interest even if you remember who the villain is. It's Andy at his best as the sheriff of an isolated mountain town with a killer with a reason for his acts that isn't a common one.

With good characters, a good plot, and an interesting twist to murders, it's a good movie for an evening's entertainment.",1376006400,3,755,4.449275362318841
4098169,3,B0039UU3LE,"Good mystery movie. Suspenseful. Good personal flashbacks. Good twists. Good scenery. Andy Griffith is good. Nick Nolte, before he became famous, is in it.",1371513600,,155,5.5
4098170,5,B0039UU3LE,"This is pretty good and serious Andy Griffith fair.  The mood and tone is that of the recent Tom Selleck ""Jesse Stone"" movies.  I like that Andy could be serious and it worked.  There were two more movies that he made like this but they had a little more comedy to them and they were good, too, but I think they could have stayed on this path and been just a little better.

There are some driving scenes that I think they used to maybe pad the film or to just show the great mountain view... I thought they worked.  Soundtrack was actually feature film quality.  All in all worth a $4 dollar rental and better than a Matlock or Murder She Wrote rerun.",1369785600,3,652,4.217741935483871
4098171,5,B0039UU3LE,This was a very good movie! We're huge Andy Griffith fans and love all of his work. If you like Andy Griffith you'll like this.,1366329600,,127,4.12
4098172,3,B0039UU3LE,"I have enjoyed Andy Griffith for years from Mayberry RFD to Matlock. This movie is an entirely different venue for Griffith, so I am not sure about it.",1365292800,,151,4.428571428571429
4098173,5,B0039UU3LE,"Andy Griffith was a great actor in mysteries.  There are other tv movies he made and I hope you put them out on DVD.  The suspense of this film goes on until the surprise ending.  Also one of Nick Nolte's first roles.  Another one you should put out on dvd is Jack Klugman in ""One of My Wives is Missing""  I know many people who would love to see these tv movies.",1359244800,2,363,3.986111111111111
4098174,5,B0039UU3LE,"Andy Griffith in just about anything is a favorite of mine, ever since his days in Mayberry. This movie is a huge change of pace for ""Sheriff Andy Taylor"", and it's one any fan should see. A tremendous movie, somewhat reminiscent of British TV murder mysteries. Well worth anyone's time and money. And a Must Have for Andy Griffith fans.",1357171200,,337,4.633333333333334

8392316,5,B0039UU3LE,"After watching so many TV episodes (over 250) of The Andy Griffith Show and Matlock and other family shows, I was happy to see the cinematic side of Andy Griffith, not just playing a Sheriff in this movie The Winter Kill, but a bad guy as well in Murder in Coweta County with Johhny Cash! A must see movie, even if it is 35 years old. Andy Griffith was riveting, probably his best performance ever.",1524960000,,398,4.32

It's nice to finally see one of them on video for screaming. Hopefully some of the others like Deadly Game and The Girl in the Empty Grave will be put on video for streaming too.
