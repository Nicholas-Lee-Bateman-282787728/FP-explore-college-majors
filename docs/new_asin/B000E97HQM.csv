8107583,5,B000E97HQM,"This film is long but worth every minute of viewing. Minnette Walters created this vision of strangeness and you wonder, even to the end, if she did or didn't do it. Great mystery and CREEEEEEEEPY. Well cast, well acted. SUCH a great adaptation of the book (Minnette Walters)",1469491200,,275,4.75
8107584,4,B000E97HQM,"Not for everyone. Olive is definitely creepy and so is her story! I love Pauline Quirke's work, and she is the star here. Does a beautiful job with Olive...by the end, you STILL aren't sure if Olive is guilty or not! You DO know something is NOT quite right about her. Caroline Goodall is wonderful as the writer here also.",1406592000,,323,4.4
8107585,3,B000E97HQM,"I remember watching this on tv years ago and liking it. Particularly Pauline Quirke who is usually associated with lighter ( no pun intended ) roles. I read the book last year and have now watched the adaptation again. The book is far more believable, whereas the film does the usual thing of showing procedures in law for example, that just do not and could not happen. Just watch any tv soap covering anything legal and it is the same. If you are showing something to do with law, why not make it true to life. Then again, you could argue that what really goes on is even more unbelievable than the tv version. You don't need to know  much about the law, but the evidence of someone as portrayed in this story would be unacceptable ( I hope! ) in a court of law and appeals just don't work like that. Caroline Goodall's character has much more depth in the book and the death of her daughter and relationship with her ex-husband is much better explained. As is Olive's family set up and her various relationships, possible motive or innocence. The  uncertainty over the latter is also more subtle in the book than on screen, where she gives some rather overdone ( again, soapland )ambiguous looks to certain characters who doubt her. I would say just read the book as it is very good and genuinely suspenseful. Pauline's performance aside, the best thing about the adaptation is the scenery, lovely shots of the Sussex coast.",1381622400,2,1427,4.5703125
8107586,4,B000E97HQM,"I bought this DVD of a novel because I was under the impression, for some unknown reason, that this was based upon a real case. I never did find out whether it was or wasn't, they weren't clear.  Not that it wasn't a good production, it was, and the acting was all good although the scenes at times were a little grotesque.  But the ending was improbable to my mind because of the way it left you guessing ""who really done it,"" and the person in the end who was accused was a stretch they didn't conslusively prove. The movie did not sit well with me, I didn't consider it good entertainment, so I ended up tossing it out. I would not want to watch it again, too spooky.",1233273600,2,670,4.186046511627907
