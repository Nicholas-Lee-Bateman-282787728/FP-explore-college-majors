5740667,1,B00CU00J4A,"Thank you, 'michael b.' for confirming my worst fear. Tragically, the audio for this film has ALWAYS been a disaster, ear-witnessed by this reviewer from his first encounter with the film in Cambridge, MA in 1969. At that time I attributed the problem to the space in which it was being exhibited, a sports arena. But my experience many years later, with the LaserDisc and then the initial DVD version, proved that the original audio recording job must have been horribly botched. You can ""remaster"" a horribly botched recording until the cows come home, it's still gonna be a botched piece of audio!! If you're into Cream, you should own the film of this concert; just be aware of the audio issue. Personally, I didn't bother with the reunion concert from some years back: I couldn't stomach ""The White Room"" with no wah-wah from Clapton!! But maybe that's just quirky me. You, I believe, are free to pursue it for audio superior to the farewell concert.  -- JAZZ OFFICER SPAAK",1377043200,10,978,4.752941176470588
5740668,1,B00CU00J4A,"I was fooled by the description of ""digitally remastered  and new 5.1 surround sound for the first time""  I have the earlier extended concert on dvd with dts surround that sounds so much better.  The picture quality is no different either.  The ""new"" 5.1 surround is like listening to a concert from outside a stadium that you arrived late to.  The vocals, bass, and guitar sound like they are in an echo chamber, and Ginger Baker's cymbals are all mushed up together so you can't tell they are cymbals.  Keep your money.  Stick with the old version!  I gave it a star only because it is Cream live.  Anyone else and it would have received nothing at all.",1375833600,40,655,4.483050847457627
8586279,4,B00CU00J4A,"Every bad thing written about this DVD is true. The sound is often sludge. The video editing choices are just, well, weird. The overly serious narrator is unintentionally amusing. I have docked it one star for these offenses.

But look at the big picture, folks. This is CREAM in concert in 1968. Be thankful that this 47-year old document exists at all. The film is successful at making you feel like you are there; it captures the intensity and virtuosity of one of the greatest rock bands in history at their live peak.",1444694400,4,522,4.612903225806452

8586283,4,B00CU00J4A,"I'm a big fan of Cream, so my appreciation will be biased in favor of this film - if you like hearing Cream's live playing, you should probably like this - a bit dated as far as amateur attempt at early psychedelics in filming, plus they need to stop jumping around with the camera shots of the member's of the band & just show them playing!",1413158400,2,341,4.181818181818182
8586284,4,B00CU00J4A,"What can you say??????  It is the CREAM at their best.  This was Clapton's best.  Though he has achieved great success over the years, he has never been as good as he was when he was teamed up with Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce.  The CREAM were the best of their ERA from England.  The Stones took a back seat to them.  They burned hot and strong for a short time.  They were fabulous to watch.  I saw them perform 3 times.  A great DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

8586285,2,B00CU00J4A,"What a maddening video this is. If you want to get a good look at Jack Bruce's tonsils, then this is the movie for you. If you want to watch the band play and interplay, you'd best look elsewhere. I think it should be an international requirement that no music video should ever be shot or edited without musicians involved. This video is a prime example of why: all tight shots of faces, all with fast cuts, and cute psychedelic camera treatment. The sound is cavernous and indistinct, but full. The interviews may be the best reason to get this. They provide an interesting insight into the band (especially if you supplement this with Beware of Mr. Baker). Ultimately I gave this two stars because any video of Cream is valuable. It's just maddening that it isn't better.",1401580800,3,774,4.615942028985507

This is a review of the Special Extended Edition.
I grew up on the Cream and never realized how short lived they were or the dynamics of the people that make up the Cream. This DVD allows one to revisit the time and place with a new vision. Hindsight can be as entertaining as the original vision.

The cream went with me into the Vietnam War so they are hard to forget. Even today I find myself singing ""in the Sunshine of your love"" and someone in the next cube would finish. One day that will be my ring tone. I'm always telling my wife to get into my big black car. Speaking of cars they make great driving music. Now I actually have a visual to match with this film. You definitely need this for your collection.

How about reissuing the video footage from Cream's early '67l Scandinavian Konserthuset performance. I've seen some of the footage and the video and audio, albeit B&W, are first rate.",1378339200,5,307,5.26530612244898
