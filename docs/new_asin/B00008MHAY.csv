7985418,2,B00008MHAY,"This DVD contains a promotional film titled ""The First 25 Years at McDonnell"" produced by the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation for its 25th anniversary in 1964.  It has nothing about the Douglas Aircraft Company with which it merged in 1967.  The only McDonnell Douglas product shown is the F/A-18 Hornet in a supplemental 1:07 music video.  The case liner says you will see footage of the DC-5, Dauntless dive bomber, DC-8, and Delta rockets... you won't.  Even the two still photos from the film on the back of the liner are incorrectly captioned.  The liner also claims the film runs approximately 60 minutes; the main feature actually only runs a little over 22.  So the liner designers either never communicated with the DVD producers or someone was being deliberately deceptive.

You will see some footage of the XP-67 Moonbat, FH-1 Phantom (I), F2H Banshee, XF-85 Goblin, XF-88/F-101 Voodoo, F3H Demon, and F4H Phantom II.  There is also footage of the Mercury spacecraft, Gemini in its development stages, and some missile technology that McDonnell was involved in.  Mixed in is footage of the employees both at work and at play at company social events.

If you are an aviation enthusiast interested in the history of McDonnell before the merger, then this video is worth having, though don't pay a premium price for it.  Those interested only in the history of Douglas Aircraft should avoid this DVD altogether.  You don't get what the liner claims you will.",1334361600,,1466,4.963114754098361
