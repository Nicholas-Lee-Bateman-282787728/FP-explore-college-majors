8594246,5,B00DL4KSGI,"I have only started this series and I can already recognize the wrong things I was doing when it came to handgun accuracy. The only issue I have with the DVD is the sound quality. For a DVD, it should have better, clearer and crisper vocals during the speaking parts. I find this a little frustrating. The 7 principles he covers are simple to grasp and learn. It may be a little fast paced for beginners but you can always go back over what ever material you may have missed. The main teaching is based on dry firing and how your brain recognizes loud muzzle and recoil. The teaching also covers how to hold your gun properly through muscle memory even under stressful conditions. So, you will be practicing to train how you fight. You can over come your fears with shooting a hand gun, do it properly and safely. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to become more efficient with their handgun.",1405123200,,899,4.487804878048781
8594247,5,B00DL4KSGI,"I am 74 years old, have arthritis and reduced vision. I was skeptical when I bought the program. I have now been following the dry fire instruction for about three weeks. My accurancy with both a 357 magnum revoilver and a 9 mm semi-automatic has improved dramatically. The bonus content exercises for carpel tunnel has been beneficial with the arthritis in my right hand.",1400630400,,372,4.828125
8594248,3,B00DL4KSGI,"The first video on the 7 fundamentals was fairly good, although I found the recommended position uncomfortable it is a viable approach, and seems to work fairly well.

However, the second video wasn't very useful.  The narrative was fine and he makes some good points but the video instruction portion (the images) were of no value at all. Basically it's a profile of him dry practicing without any real demonstrations of the techniques being discussed.  Also there isn't a good way to move through the exercises in the second video other than to ""fast forward"" from one section to another, which is rather tedious when doing different sections at different times.

All in all it's not bad but I would not recommend this video.",1395446400,3,727,4.838709677419355
8594249,5,B00DL4KSGI,"I purchased this program several weeks ago and rigidly followed the training program. My accuracy definitely improved. The program not only improves accuracy and reinforces safety but saves money. For example, training at home eliminates the need to pay for individual training - $50 per hour - and boxes of ammo - at least $20 depending on caliber. I went to the range every week after 5 days of the program. My accuracy improved every time out. I identified a problem in anticipating the next shot/recoil which was causing me to pull to the left and low rather than squeezing the trigger slowly. Dry fire practice helped me eliminate this issue. I plan to continue using the program weekly prior to taking additional defensive training courses. I strongly recommend this program to any new pistol owner and those with previous experience whose skills may have diminished.",1391731200,2,873,4.986301369863014
8594250,5,B00DL4KSGI,"This product helped me improve my technique dramatically.  I had purchased a compact 9mm and after about 100 rounds, I was sure that the sights were off.  I took it to a gunsmith along with a target I had shot and he immediately told me that he had seen those results hundreds of times and that it was not the sights...it was my technique.  So, I looked for something I could do for myself, other than pay for an instructor, and found this product.  After sticking with the exercises for 30 days my accuracy dramatically improved. I recommend it, but the 15 minute per day dry fire exercises do take some discipline to complete regularly.  The results were worth it for me.",1375401600,8,673,4.483606557377049
