8345772,5,B001V8VF5Y,This is the original version as seen on TV which we like much better the current overly digital enhanced version. The old version looks more natural and realistic.,1484611200,,163,4.857142857142857

8345777,4,B001V8VF5Y,"I first saw this in 2002 when in Montreal HD was only available in a single demonstration channel. This Vision of Italy was shown for days, in that year.
Last year PBS had it back and I recorded it (in HD). And by accident last month I erased it and that's the reason I ordered the DVD. And I have all the beautiful scenes and there are some differences for the music part.
But I must say that in HD it does make a difference. I wonder why this is not available in Blu-Ray... I would buy it in a heartbeat.",1411257600,,506,4.01980198019802

8345779,3,B001V8VF5Y,"Flying over the Italian cities is only marginally interesting. The photography is excellent but there are no verbal details. There are written titles of each area on the screen. If you've been to this area (as I have), it's a memory jogger, but it would have been better to have given some history of each of the highlighted areas.",1382659200,,331,4.627118644067797
8345780,3,B001V8VF5Y,Great work. This is something that is very nice to see on a lazy day. Makes you want to head to the airport and see for yourself. Most relaxing after a stressful day. The lady will put you to sleep.,1369008000,,198,3.975
