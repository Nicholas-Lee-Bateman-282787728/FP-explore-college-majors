8632509,5,B0009HKUEU,"Wheel Time Express is my 2 year old son's favorite DVD, and I don't mind him watching it again and again!  It has heightened his awareness of wheels and other movement in the world around him.  While out in the car loves to point out trains, school buses and tractors and gets very excited to spot water wheels and other wheels anytime we are out and about.  Wheel Time Express is very well put together with wonderful visuals and soothing music.  When my little guy is tired it is a perfect way to lull him to sleep!  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone with young children.",1117670400,3,577,4.355140186915888
