4086074,5,B0038M2AWI,"I watched the entire series on the History Channel . It is very factual and the makers went to great lengths to research the subject. This is by far the most compelling information on the subject and will have even skeptics raising eyebrows. I was shocked by some of the factual content that I had never heard before. Throw away anything else you have seen on the subject. This takes the subject to a new level . I tend to be very skeptical of the majority of what you see on UFOs , aliens , etc. This series is fantastic. You are presented with indisputable fact after fact. A must see.",1279238400,23,587,4.297297297297297

4086076,5,B0038M2AWI,"Could it be possible that intelligent life forms visited Earth thousands of years ago, bringing with them knowledge and technology that greatly altered the course of history and human development on Earth? The Ancient Astronauts mini-series on DVD explores this possibility in depth.

Consider the following:

** How is it that the ancient Mayan calendar is more accurate than our own if the ancients were so primitive?
** What are the pyramids really for? They're located across the globe, not just in Egypt.
** Could primitive people really move solid blocks the size of train cars with only ropes and ramps to build the pyramids? Did they really bring the quartz and granite, which is only found many miles away in most cases, to the construction site, again, by pulling train car sized chunks with ropes?
** Why are there ancient artifacts and glyphs which look identical to jet airplanes that we use today?
** Did ancient Egyptians use electricity to light the internal chambers of their monuments and pyramids?
** Were the Nasca lines actually landing strips for ancient flying craft?
** How was the top of an entire mountain range artificially removed in ancient times to create the plateau where many of the ""landing strip"" type Nasca lines are located?

There are so many mysteries about the ancients....

**  How they built such monumental megalithic structures that we would be hard pressed to attempt to build even today **  Why they had astronomical maps and maps of the Earth that match ours today, yet our maps only became as accurate as the ancient ones in the last 50 years.
**  Why does every ancient religion indicate their ""Gods"" descended from the sky, heavens, or space bringing knowledge to their peoples?
**  Why are there pyramids across the Earth, yet all similarly built during ancient times when people supposedly had no means of communicating across large distances, so there could not have been sharing of ideas?
**  Why have there been stories, from ancient times until today, of flying craft in the sky, or visitations from ""angels,gods,aliens,fairies"" and other different beings? Could they all be the same beings who visit here, just described in different ways?
**  Should we really dismiss as pure myth the stories in ancient Indian texts that describe ""flying machines of the gods""?
**  Are there really accounts of space craft and alien visitations in the texts of all the older, established religions and cultures? (The Bible, Bhagavad Gita, Sumerian texts, Egyptian texts, Mayan/Incan/Olmec texts, petroglyphs of ancient America, and more...)

All of these topics and many more have been addressed in this great mini-series originally presented on the History channel in 2010. Many experts in conventional archeology and religion are interviewed in addition to the current experts in ancient astronaut theory and authors on the subject such as Erich Von Daniken (the author who originally brought this subject to light under much controversy in the 1960's with his book Chariots of the Gods&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chariots-of-the-Gods/dp/0425166805/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chariots of the Gods</a>)

This is a fascinating subject that is presented in an excellent manner. The subject is treated quite seriously with enough information provided to allow viewers to make up their own minds and spark further curiosity on the subjects presented. This series was produced with the cooperation of Von Daniken (the author who broght the subject to light in the 1960's and who continues his research into the subject to this day).

From the DVD description:

Ancient Aliens launches all-new expeditions to seek out and evaluate this evidence, with a concentration on the latest discoveries of the last 30 years, including unusual DNA findings on man's evolution and newly decoded artifacts from Egypt to Syria to South America. It is a balanced investigation into a theory some believe cannot be true, but many agree cannot be ignored.

For those new to this concept - What is Ancient Astronaut theory?

The general idea of ancient astronaut theory is that thousands of years ago there were visitors to Earth which to the primitive humans, seemed as Gods. They had advanced technology which was used around the ancient humans, and to the ancient humans this technology was so amazing that these beings could be nothing less than Gods (look up cargo cults to see how our technology had a similar effect on primitive tribal peoples during WWII). These ancient astronauts, aka alien visitors, were responsible for the instantaneous leap in development that occurred and which has remained an unexplained mystery among conventional archeologists and anthropologists. They are also responsible for guiding the building of all the megalithic structures, the advanced calendars, inexplicably accurate astronomical and world maps, etc. (Some even speculate they conducted genetic manipulation on our species and are responsible for particular unusual aspects to our DNA and development.)

Ancient Astronauts does a great job supporting the ancient astronaut theory by obtaining the expert opinion of master builders and masons regarding the aspects involved in building megalithic structures, plus theologians and other scientists who can lend insight into the various mysteries discussed. The information presented is current and very up-to-date.

I highly recommend Ancient Astronauts to anyone curious and who can bring an open mind to the subject., Additionally, there is new information presented for those who already have an established interest or knowledge on the subject. A great series - well worth owning!",1277596800,196,5697,5.338169642857143

I would give it one star, but the production values are actually pretty good.  It's too bad that they don't invite some actual scientists and critical thinkers in to be interviewed to at least show some alternate theories.

Mom, Dad, Selma and I used to love watching ""In Search Of"" when it was syndicated back in the 1970s; and I suspect we all would have been at the very least entertained by ""Ancient Aliens - Season One.""
""Ancient Aliens - Season One"" doesn't break any new ground when it comes to the Ancient Astronaut theory of visitation by advance alien cultures, but it's entertaining - especially one overly spray-on-tan guy with the wild and funky hair who is interviewed as an ""expert"" in all the episodes.
All ""Ancient Aliens"" is is really just a repackaging of old ideas that have been largely discredited by - GASP - actual science and actual fact.  Still, there are worse things to watch.

Even hearing about Tesla's wireless electricity for the planet, is enough to make one think why is this not being utilized now?

4086764,5,B0038M2AWI,"I had an uncle-in-law, professor at U. Penn Wharton, who told me that it doesn't matter all that much whether a theory is right or wrong. What matters is that it is new and non-trivial. In other words, what matters is what gets your juices going.

This series has me hooked. I don't buy everything everybody says, and they kind of tacitly make it clear that even the proponents of this theory don't agree with each other about most things. In particular, the guy with the floppy hair (I love the guy with the floppy hair) knows for an absolute fact that there are no angels (duh) and knows equally for certain that Nefertiti was an extraterrestrial, or at least a hybrid... I'm a little less convinced on both those points, but I envy him his wellspring of un-apologetic exuberance.

But it's way cool. Really cool. I've learned so much about all these curious places and phenomena and ancient texts in the world. And I think I'm even finding myself agreeing with the main premise. All in all, they make a really solid case...

I think whether you agree or not in the end depends on whether you believe that Roswell was a real alien spaceship or not. If you read Corso, and think, ""You know what? He's not lying,"" then the main premise here is kind of a logical consequence. I put it off, because I was afraid of being overrun by dry facts, but this is juicy, juicy, juicy.",1418688000,,1373,4.46215139442231

4086771,1,B0038M2AWI,"A mixture of lies, misrepresentations and hocus pocus. The ancient aliens theorists have long hoped for a more public and legitimate forum to air their idiotic, groundless ideas. And now the History Channel has given it to them, along with its full support. The theorists, given the systematic inaccuracies and outright fabrications in their statements, obviously know nothing about the dozens of cultures, sites and issues about which they are touted as ""experts.""

Simple internet research, for example, quickly gives the lie to their claims. A few examples: the Brookings report did not recommend hiding knowledge of alien life if found; Annunaki does not mean ""those who from the heavens came""; far from there being ""no tools"" found at Golbeki Tepe, a great treasure of them was found; we do not ""know nothing"" about how the Egyptian pyramids and Machu Picchu (among other sites) were built, we know a great deal and more is being learned every day; and on and on.

Evidence contrary to their claims is not mentioned. And contrary opinions are carefully edited to make them sound supportive. More fundamentally, the entire edifice is founded on nothing more than the ""beliefs"" of individual people. The premise of every episode and nearly every ""account"" is that ""some people believe"" X or Y. No evidence. No argument. No actual reason for believing so. Just simple belief. That makes it so.

The segments are highly formulaic.  First they describe a place or event that is famous.  Then they posit a false premise or dilemma, such as ""humans could not have done this at the time"" or ""there has never been an explanation of this"" or ""we know nothing about how it is done.""  Next, they ask ""is it possible that aliens did it?""  And every time, they say yes.  Then, they launch into a variety of bald statements of purported fact, with no evidence to back them up.  Most of the facts are either verifiably false or horribly distorted.  These alleged ""facts"" are supposed to support the aliens theory.

Keep in mind also how tantalizingly just out of reach the ""proof"" always is.  No evidence, just lights and alleged sightings. And when we ask for a space ship or wreckage or fossils or *any* kind of concrete evidence, there isn't any.  Either the lack of evidence isn't mentioned, or it's explained away with stories that it mysteriously disappeared or was stolen or is part of a government conspiracy.

The true believers are--and this is not meant as an insult but a description of fact--self-deluding morons.

What is truly tragic is that the History channel is using its air time to dumb people down rather than to educate.

4086797,3,B0038M2AWI,"It's entertaining enough, but I'm missing the counterarguments--how do the skeptics evaluate the 'evidence?' Without that, the show is easily summed up by this little speech Joe Pesci delivers in 'My Cousin Vinnie':

""The DA's gotta build a case. Building a case is like building a house. Each piece of evidence is a building block. He wants to make a brick bunker of a building. He wants to use serious, solid-looking bricks, like these, right? Let me show you something. He's gonna show you the bricks. He'll show you they got straight sides. He'll show you how they got the right shape. He'll show them to you in a very special way... so that they appear to have everything a brick should have. But there's one thing he's not gonna show you. When you look at the bricks at the right angle, they're as thin as this playing card. His whole case is an illusion, a magic trick.""",1418083200,,877,4.550632911392405

4086803,1,B0038M2AWI,"It's hard to find any redeeming features for this series. It draws its inspiration from Erich Von Daniken's work, which in turn was 'influenced by' Robert Charroux, who was in his turn influenced by the Cthulhu Mythos FICTIONAL stories of H. P. Lovecraft- yes, that's right, the ghost and horror story writer- and August Derleth. A large helping of mythology and outright fiction is sprinkled with a few facts and turned into a mish-mash from which the viewers are invited to believe some extremely wild speculation- that history was a parade of activities by extraterrestrials.

The justification for this is so slender that I have on a number of occasions found myself wondering whether I was really hearing such nonsense put forward as a serious proposition. One of the repeated themes, for example, is that the aliens gave the world advanced technology. Strange, then, that when the steam engine was invented at the beginning of the 19th century, it remained the dominant form of power for the next hundred years and only became completely obsolescent in the middle of the 20th century. Those steam-powered spacecraft must have been something to see.

The series might be saved if it were suitably tongue in cheek, like for example 'Destination Truth', but no, there's no hint of humor here from the earnest 'ancient astronaut theorists' and the narrator uses the hushed reverent tones of someone in awe of the subject matter.

The fact there there are so many reviews here from people who obviously think this is a science-based program is simply incredible. History, nature and the real universe are so amazing; this series is, I'm sorry to say, pure drivel.",1417737600,,1664,4.9784172661870505

4086915,4,B0038M2AWI,"Intriguing, fascinating and I really like this series. I found it originally on the History channel on my Roku but only a few episodes were unlocked for non History channel subscribers. So much of the theories explained and laid out I think are very plausible. You mix and match this with Zeitgeist (The Movie), the ancient history of the Mediterranean and Persia that is taught in our schools and you can really get a feel for the possibilities.
When you consider the age of the Universe, the likelihood of other inhabited planets along with our own quest to go to the Moon, Mars and beyond, it may possible (or even probable) that we long ago were visited by advanced beings that could have been seen as Gods as we would be if we went to a less advanced planet.
The one thing I didn't like is that I found it somewhat repetitive in some regards, otherwise it is 5 stars.",1415318400,,872,4.45625

4086986,4,B0038M2AWI,"It's a thought provoking show and it points out a lot of unanswered, or insufficiently answered, questions about our ancient history. However, many of the theories posed in this series have more plausible and more conventional explanations.

4087082,5,B0038M2AWI,"Excellent gateway to explain what the reasonable natural and social sciences cannot explain: Have ancient aliens visited our ancient Earth and jump-started civilization by introducing the missing link, which gave us intelligence? Are we so concerned with the heavens, universe, and galaxies throughout human history, as evidenced in the stone mega-monuments'writings in six continents, perhaps looking our roots? Are the beings that the ancient Egyptians and Greeks named gods, the Middle Age scholars called angels and demons, the Native Americans called Star people/brothers, and we call Aliens the same and one? Are modern technologies attributed to the knowledge given by linking to the ethereal communication with alien intelligence? His humanity older than the 6,000 that reasonable scientist make us believe? Do government and eminent religious leaders know and have evidence that there other civilizations in other galaxies and they conspire to keep that information from the constituents? Is it a coincidence that all religions in the World have known of a being that came from the heavens, returned, and promised to come back? Was Enoch as depicted on the Bible taken on a Chariot of Fire in reality taken in a UFO? Why the Earth has spots with high energy levels which defy other electromagnetic forces? Why Einstein's brain had the composition of a 20 years old when he died in his seventies?  How could he write 4 mega scientific papers in one single year? How did he came to know that Hitler had the capability to destroy humanity? Did Alien intelligence gave him the knowledge in one of his famous trance state? How our ancient ancestors lift those mega tons boulders without the modern technology? Did they receive help from alien's technology? In the same manner that we can visit the Moon and Mar, could other civilizations visit us? What was the real function of the Pyramids? How come there are pyramids in Africa, Europe, Asia, South America, and Central America? Does that mean that the same designers with the same intelligence taught the ancient ancestors in those different geographical areas? Does the ruins in Bolivia that are older than 10,000 years, with mega stones above the tree level, with perfect cuts at 45 degrees, and drilled holes made by gods on a single night as the local legends states? What the structure base camp of aliens? Are we the aliens on Earth? These and many more quests are address on this and subsequent enlightening series.",1412208000,,2479,5.090909090909091

4087122,4,B0038M2AWI,"Of course it includes speculation.  All discoveries begin with some speculation.  A thought.  A ""hey, maybe...""  That's were revelations begin.  And to overlook the obvious like the nazca lines, or the tiny aircraft jewelry, or the batteries or the huge cut stones... well, that would just be silly.  Anyone thinking person would look at those objects and ask themselves how they came to be, several thousand years before we developed our current brand of technology.  I mean, the questions are there.  Is this ""the"" answer?  Who knows.  But it's damn fun to think about, and it sure is as good as any other explanation I've heard.  And I'm an engineer with plenty of science background.  Some of these wonders just defy explanation.  So I'm going to recommend this first year of the series to anyone who wants a little speculation with their science, and enjoys the ancient alien story.  I think it's a great way to chill and spend a few hours!",1411689600,,945,4.753086419753086
4087123,5,B0038M2AWI,"One of me all-time favorite documentaries. While it introduces some head-scratching, loopy concepts, there's enough cogent rationality to most of the material to really make the hypothesis of ancient visitations plausible. While the series devolved into something almost comical in recent seasons (Aliens and Insects? Really?), Ancient Aliens Season 1 remains captivating, thought-provoking television.",1411689600,,402,6.462962962962963

4087324,5,B0038M2AWI,"Very Interesting! It made me wonder this:

I think that humans throughout history have always had one thing in common, and that is the fact that certain technologies seem like magic to us.

I think that technologies like airplanes, spaceships, large buildings and machines, etc., has always seemed like ""magic"", or seems, ""unbelieveable"" to humans, because it (technology) is extra terrestrial.

I think this is why people of the past have made drawings and made conclusions about technology, like it is from ""The Gods"", because it was just 'unnatural' to them - and today, even though a large majority of people have a basic understanding of technology, that it still seems, ""magical"", or ""unnatural"". Maybe this is why peoples like the ancient Egyptians thought that only ""The Gods"" were capable of certain things like flying. Maybe only the highest people like Kings were privy to the understanding of it.

Also, I think that there was technology thousands of years ago that rivals todays, but it was not correctly documented because most of the population just did not understand it, and did not have the same knowledge about it as the Kings did.

In other words, I think that humans throughout history have always had one thing in common, and that is the fact that certain technologies seem like magic to us. There are many people today, that live in isolated places, who would view certain technologies as ""magic"". So, the one thing humans have always had in common, throughout the ages, is that certain technologies seem 'magical' because technology is not of this world.",1408752000,,1578,4.962121212121212

The show is by no way balanced in terms of fact vs. speculation. I would love it if they balanced it out a bit, for every extraordinary claim made by one of these ancient astronaut theorists, I would love to have somebody who is a bit more grounded in the scientific community respond to such ideas.

4087675,5,B0038M2AWI,"I've always been fascinated with the possibilities of what is not obvious. Many programs dealing with paranormal events simply amount to a bunch of people running around with flashlights screaming in the dark with nothing to show for it except 'tune in again next week when . . .'

The people presenting information for 'Ancient Aliens' are completely serious scientists who deeply believe in what they are searching for and have devoted there life's work to the endeavor. The studies they have done are rooted in sound scientific processes and leave you with really interesting concepts to ponder. In addition they are not afraid to admit that their hypotheses may not be 'proven' but the presentation is given in a fashion that says, 'here's what I have seen, let's consider this together' instead so 'here it is, believe it or go away.' Even my husband, a certified skeptic of the paranormal, has been impressed by the evidence gathered from examinations of the engineering demonstrated in ancient ruins.

All in all 'Ancient Aliens' has impressed me as a series that is very informative and thought provoking. It is a worthwhile viewing. Enjoy!",1401494400,,1148,5.005235602094241

4087679,1,B0038M2AWI,"You might not associate the word hilarious with this type of genre, however hilarious is exactly what this series is. I would also add ridiculous. It is hilarious because their premise on every issue they present is simply laughable - aliens have visited our planet. It is ridiculous because the information they present is very far-fetched, and worse it is faulty. There are numerous instances where the historical information is very inaccurate. They are bending the facts to suit their theories.

4087702,4,B0038M2AWI,"The genre really tells it all, starting out as ""Science Fiction"" and ""Fantasy"" before mentioning ""Documentary"". I'm not even sure if this is supposed to be a real documentary of some kind, or if it's literally a science-fiction show (is this supposed to be a mockumentary?). Anyway, if we assume that the ""experts"" interviewed believe it's a real documentary and aren't simply paid actors, then this is one of the most fascinating explorations of human psyche I've ever seen. It's simply fascinating how little understanding of the scientific-method is displayed, and how utterly willing these people are to take any bit of information and then fold, spindle, and mutilate it so that it magically conforms to whatever belief system they already have in place. This is not a well-thought-out exploration of the subject by any stretch of the imagination. The episode about the ""hollow earth"" had me literally in stitches though, so there is certainly a lot to laugh at if you're on the more ""rational"" end of the human spectrum. For some reasons I've also found this show really easy to fall asleep to, possibly because it's so farcical that it can't really grab your interest. You're going ""oooooh, so the Earth is really hollow with giant holes in both poles and we've never noticed, WOW what happens next... ZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzz"".

4087746,3,B0038M2AWI,"This show presents historical facts and  archaeological evidence, but seems to make large leaps in explanations for them. It's true I'm only on the second episode, so maybe it changes, but from what I've seen,  there's not much evidence towards their explanations.
For instance, in the pilot, the interviewees provide several pieces of archaeological evidence that convinces me that the Ancient Egyptians was much more technologically advanced than we know. However, they make the assumption that the Egyptians couldn't have come up with these developments themselves. Why not? We did!
In the second episode, they use the bizarre appearances of ancient gods to lend credence to the idea that they were actually gods and the reason certain tribes alter their skulls and bodily appearances. But who says we needed outside influences? People have random words tatooed on their bodies, parts of their bodies pierced, make it impossible for them to have children, and why? Because they want to. If today's people can alter their bodies because they want to, why couldn't ancient people do the same?
They use the depictions of Egyptian royalty and claims that gods spoke to rulers to back up their claims, but the Pharoh's and royalty often intermarried, which could lead to genetic deformations and people have historically used the excuse, ""God put me in power"" to obtain obedience from their peers. It's not always true.
Their theories are interesting and certainly warrant consideration, but, at the time, we have only eye-witness accounts of aliens, and eye-witnesses can be unreliable. Earth is the only planet that we know of that hosts life and, the more we learn about it, the more unique it actually is. Until we find life on other planets, we should work with the information we do have, which leads us to conclude that these advances in technology and different practices originated on Earth.",1399593600,,1898,5.09967845659164

Seven thousand miles away a team of university researchers find a bird-like pendant with aerodynamic features, a vertical and horizontal tail structure. But it's got a decidedly non-aerodynamic sawtooth leading edge along the wings.  Conclusion:  Aliens must have landed and given ancient cultures the knowledge to build today's modern jets.  And this all proves aliens definitely landed here thousands of years ago to goose mankind into the modern age.  Oh really?  Then why don't they stop by now to give us the blueprints for a transporter or starship?  This program's logic is as fuzzy as those bogus black-and-white UFO photographs from the 1950's.

If the aliens have propulsion systems capable of bring them to Earth through the vastness of space-time, why would they resort to something as primitive as jet or rocket powered vehicles once they arrive here?

Watch this series, read the book of revelations in the Bible then read the Apocryphal Book of Enoch, make up your own mind.

 These huge containment building could not be built in the time span using the know tools of that time..

While I don't follow the field super-closely, I've read a lot of related books and paid attention to quirky reports that might indicate alien influence. It's not that I'm committed to this kind of research or take it all seriously, but... well, it's interesting. It's odd. I like how it explains and connects otherwise anomalous events and archaeological finds.

I especially like this series because the producers include a variety of opinions about what's reported. Even better, I enjoy their reconstructions of ""what if...?"" theories. They take the evidence at face value, and see what happens if they take the design, theory, or whatever in a literal and logical direction.

I've been utterly astonished when many of those things move from folklore to fact. In the first episode, the things that could take flight... that's fascinating. I know how tricky aerodynamics can be, so I didn't expect the objects to have the necessary lift without significant redesigns.

All in all, this season covered a lot of information with just the right balance between skeptical inquiry and outright speculation. Even if you think you're already familiar with most major evidence related to alien visitors, you'll probably find something surprising and fascinating in each Season 1 episode.",1398124800,,1337,5.238317757009346

The Ancient Aliens series does provide a lot of accurate information and then they add their spin. If you watch, take note that a specific location is given one spin in episode 1 and a different spin in episode 2.

To think that we are smarter then our ancestors is foolish. We have different technology, and most of the public learned to read, but other then that, we are still the same if not worse(Just think of all the stupid things we watch others do). The ability to build buildings that can outlast time is not something we are able to do anymore, we squander our resources on cheap buildings that will eventually crumble under their own weight, we seek money over love to fill our greed, and we hate more easily to anything that doesn't agree with the herd.

Where I get irked are when people who get aggressive to anyone that poses an alternate theory that contradicts their rigid beliefs that are created from our world's institutions over history. Our history has been rewritten numerous times throughout civilizations. I just can't see why ordinary people who have no direct experience with this subject matter can't have an open mind. The human species must evolve more than just our bodies. We must evolve our consciousnesses. Science depends on creativity just as much as artists do. Religious and scientific tyrants are the closed minds that hold us back with their outdated dogma and theories.  This Universe is infinite filled with infinite possibilities and discoveries.

If you're on the fence or open-minded about alien visitation and mysticism in general, you'll have a good time with this show. Much of what is presented was new to me, and even the tried-and-true are examined through the eyes of somebody looking for otherworldly contact; such a bias leads to very interesting alternate idea about existing mysteries and mythos.

Neither do we!  Call them what you like, we still don't know what they are!

They seem to take on the physical body and appearance that best suits their purposes, or allows them to function in our space and time.  Which still  leaves the question: what are they?

The more advanced ones may actually be beings of light, intermediaries between us and Source or Spirit.  In which case it would be truer to call them ""angels"".

4088006,1,B0038M2AWI,"The fact that this is a popular show, yet the same audience doesn't know squat about our own country's history, much less the history of ancient civilizations, is a testament to the dumbing down of our country. There is no science in this series, although it used the illusion of science and anthropology to invent these mentally-defective theories.

Do you know what got Europe out of the dark ages and started the Renaissance? (Hint: it wasn't aliens.) It was the fact that arts and education (books and actual knowledge) became the most valuable commodity in the West. Not today though. All we care about is entertainment and money, so when the History Channel allowed this bulls#!t on their network, I knew it was the end of the History Channel (which used to be my favorite).

I have no respect for anyone who would give this 5 stars, or any more than 2. You're all idiots and sheep, and deserve less respect than biblical literalists (which some of you saps probably are).",1394582400,,978,4.713450292397661

4088127,5,B0038M2AWI,"I love the concept of this show. I've always been intrigued by the idea that extraterrestrials may have not only visited earth in the past, but that many of our myths and religious stories are simply misinterpretations of flesh and blood beings quite similar to ourselves, but light years ahead of us technologically. I also like in the idea that we might actually be their descendants in one way or another, whether directly (the shipwrecked pilgrims idea, like settlers in the ""new"" world), through some sort of genetic manipulation (the creation/ god complex), or even crossbreeding with the existing native population.

I do admit that some of the evidence talked about on the show is pretty far fetched and sometimes outright laughable, and that a few of the speakers don't help much in proving credibility with their slightly wacky/ hippy dippy appearance. However I wouldn't let those few bad apples completely discredit the idea. In a mainstream society that mocks and ridicules anyone who even suggests that aliens might be anything other than fiction, it takes a very special kind of person--especially one working in a scientific field-- with a considerable amount of guts and self-possession to come out and speak these ideas. Is it any wonder that many of these persons and free thinkers seem a bit quirky and tend to stand out?

Different doesn't not automatically mean crazy and disreputable, despite what the majority of straight lased conservatives might have you think. For if it did, most of the worlds greatest scientific discoveries and inventions would have been ignored, and we'd probably still be living in caves wondering how the heck to stay warm without fire and trying our best not to get eaten. New ideas and fresh perspectives are essential. And although many of them might seem crazy/ scary at first, or contradict something we THINK we already know, that doesn't mean they don't have merit. After all it only takes one location, a single confirmation of fact to prove someone/ something not of this earth was here at some point, even if all the rest is just smoke and speculation. An open mind to every possibility is the only way we'll ever learn anything for certain.",1392854400,,2201,4.945945945945946

That's the case with this show.  Instead of looking at evidence and creating a hypothesis, they start with the hypothesis and try to force the evidence to agree with it.  It's a subtle but very significant difference.  The result is a show of little entertainment value and no real clear thinking.  Added to that, the video presentation is just so-so.

4088286,1,B0038M2AWI,"Look at the ancient ""bird"" and ""airplane"" models: Just how difficult might it be to make a paper airplane if you have paper, or even a very large leaf to fold together? A child can create a toy model. Does that make the child an super-intelligent ancient alien? If some creative person a long time ago tried to make a flying model, does that make them more informed than we are? That's about what this series promotes.

Yes, our ancestors were creative and curious. That doesn't necessarily mean they were aerodynamics specialists or rocket scientists. It means they suspected there were principals to the nature of flying that could be learned. But that's as far as we can speculate, because we have no other proof. Testing aerodynamic models based on ancient art and inferring from that a whole race of flying super-smart aliens is not history, nor is it science. It's entertainment.

It's a little like believing the 4th century Saint Nicholas scuttled down the chimneys of the suburban children living in Lycea over a thousand years ago -- and has been doing so ever since. We know this is not the case, no matter what we tell our children. And if someone did attempt to scuttle down our chimneys today, they would most certainly be arrested for trespass.

The History Channel is passing off junk science and junk history as the real thing without warning unsuspecting viewers that what they are watching is purely for entertainment value and nothing else.

I hope the people who posed as experts in this series got well paid by the people at the History channel because it seems fairly unlikely they'll ever teach at a major university in any country with a credible history or science faculty.",1390089600,2,1699,4.7687074829931975

They ask leading questions about ancient times, and follow that up with lots of speculation about unusual places, native legends, prehistoric stone carvings, and artwork, etc., that really makes you think. There's a little travelogue within each show, so you can see for yourself what they are discussing.  Fun!  Ancient Aliens finds things that are a bit out of the ordinary, and they put their own spin on what they find.  Who are we to say that they are wrong?

The idea of aliens landing in the past to help humanity is an interesting idea but this series fail to provide factual evidence and the ""evidence"" they do provide can be explained by a simple web search. I can't believe this show is on the ""History"" Channel. Right next to programs about wars and historical figures, we have a show about how our ancestors were so stupid and inferior that aliens had to come down and make us smart. Bull.

To the people who believes this crap, consider this:

*What makes you think that our ancestors were not intelligent enough to make anything themselves?
*If aliens did in fact help us build things, why didn't they teach us how to build things with lighter and easier to cut materials?
*Why the heck didn't they give us the invention of the wheel earlier?
*If aliens were all over the earth, why aren't there ANY physical evidence?
*Why do you choose to not believe in archaeologists, anthropologist, and historians who are highly educated on the subject over people whose only credentials are that they are authors of a book about ancient astronauts.
*And finally, why would you believe a guy with a horrible tan and crazy hair?

But this is the first season and it has all that really needed to be said to be interesting and thought-provoking.

This video presents some interesting arguments for alien intervention-the most promising of which are the stone moving of the ancients. Some of these stones are larger than we can move today, which begs the question, 'Why use such big stones?'

4088394,5,B0038M2AWI,"Intending no offense to anyone, we watch this purely for the entertainment value -- the unintended humor provided by strange people with even stranger ideas just talking about them as if they make any sense at all.  Excepting the odd university professor who appears to have inadvertently wandered into the episodes, the cast of commentators is marked by an apparent absence of credentials of any kind.  Identified simply as ""author"" or ""UFO Investigator"" or the ubiquitous title ""publisher,"" they offer theories and ""facts"" in a variety of scientific and academic fields as though they have any training or familiarity whatsoever with the disciplines at hand.  Unburdened by the need for expertise, the preposterous quickly becomes the normal, facts not in evidence become dogma, and the unprovable becomes the incontestible.  Hilarity ensues as they ""riff"" off of one another, citing the ridiculous theory of one commentator to support the risible ideas of another.

It does get tiresome, as the episodes are rather long and some of the commentators' verbal tics can grate.  Nonetheless, the series delivers potent doses of two old American traditions.  From the ones who appear to actually believe what they are saying, there is the anti-intellectualism posing as scholarship that has fueled conspiracy theories since well before the nation's founding.  From the ones who seem not to believe a word of it, there is the hucksterism that brings to mind Twain's river royals a few steps ahead of the sheriff and scuffling like mad.",1388361600,,1531,5.195121951219512

However, they often introduce a concept using the phrasing of what if instead of what the author said, ""Y"", he meant  ""Z"".  And then a few minutes later they use the phase since we all know ""Z"" is true it could only be done with alien help.  There are also a lot of misquotes and half-quotes of the original texts.  Most of the ""experts"" have titles such as ""Film Maker""  or ""Author"" rather than actual creditable/knowledgeable experts.  Over-all it is very skewed and not viewing the topic from a scientific viewpoint or presenting both sides of the story.  I was surprised that it was published by the history channel. I am interested in seeing how they deal with the Mayan ""end of the world""  prophecy in later episodes after, in this season, they were so confident that the world would end in 2012.  Maybe they will say, without any evidence, that the Aliens protected us for the end of the world....But the views of ancient cities are interesting.

Just don't take anything here to seriously. It can even be fun/comical looking for the spin.  It is always there and usually easy to fine.",1386979200,,1159,4.6

I watched this on a drunken lark with some friends after laughing our butts off at the 'Finding Bigfoot' people and I hate to say it but, they really did a good job making their point.
We're a bunch of research scientists and MD's and, the best thing about this show is that, even if you don't buy into the underlying alien visitation premise, there is still a lot of really interesting mental floss to talk about - preferably with lots of wine, rum, or spiked eggnog (it is Christmas after all).
Although we've only watched the first episode, we're thinking of making it a regular thing.  That is to say we'll be watching more.  Go ahead and take a chance and give the series an hour - you probably won't finish the show wishing you could have it back.",1386979200,,876,4.49685534591195

At any rate, God or aliens...hm. moving on. The bit about the wood carving bird? Seriously ""These are not the wing span of any known bird..."" it's a carving of wood over two thousand years old people! Secondly when they say it would fly and land like a modern glider if you attach a back piece to it. Well, aren't you then just making the carving into something completely different than what you found?

How can we say things like that when we are missing true history of our past times? There is still no evidence explaining what happened to Mohenjadaro and Harappa civilizations?

Utter and total quackery, apparently taken seriously by the great booboisie.  ""Ancient Aliens"" should be the giveaway.  Did they start with the alliteration?  ""Wow, great title, let's build a series around it!""

This show appeals to the same public that considers creationism to be science.  It's really comical-pitiful to hear people *seriously* discuss this show.  I have utmost respect for the Bible, but its stories and characters have little independent foundation in fact. (The Bible is about truth, not fact.)  Then, to use Biblical stories as *historical* bases for pure speculation about aliens makes me long for the days of Weekly World News and its ""Elvis on the Moon"" sightings.

Ancient Aliens is unadulterated rubbish, clothed in pseudo-scientific trappings, using second-rate ""scholars"" to lend it credence.  Some poor soul here actually says ""I am so ashamed to be a part of a society that prizes shows like Jersey shore and Honey Boo whatever. Really people? Have some self respect.""  Have some self-respect and swallow this guff???  If you take ANY of Ancient Aliens seriously, then you are part of the proof of the decline of Western civilization, of which Ancient Aliens' 4.5 star rating is a dismal indicator.

Does make me wonder....but overall it is a good thought provoking series that asks questions that need answers.  It heightens public awareness that academicians are glued to mainstream theory not by data but by wearing blinders that omit uncomfortable facts.  It is time that academia takes these anomalies seriously and stops explaining anomalies as myth, and religious rituals and beliefs.  Many of these assertions were established in the 1800s and earlier before man developed technologies that would have a different interpretation if discovered today: for instance the ability to fly.  Today, how can  we  properly interpret archaeological findings whose use we cannot imagine?

They ask us to question what we've been taught, ponder the facts and evidence they present and then think for ourselves of the possibilities.

Is it possible that extra-terrestrials came to Earth and created the human race? Could those men who penned our Holy Scriptures have been describing their interactions with ETs? Are those ETs actually God our Creator, but we've misunderstood the writers of the Bible? The information presented will make your head swim.

4088560,3,B0038M2AWI,"My son saw this on Amazon Prime and wanted to watch it.

It's fun to watch and say ""what if"", but the show relies heavily on ""theories"" (and I use that word loosely here) from ""ancient alien theorists"".  I could count probably a hundred times that I heard ""ancient alien theorists believe..."" without mentioning who these theorists are by name.  It's akin to how folks will comment ""they say..."" and it's like ""who's 'they'""??

During the show, there will be some little thing they reveal that was uncovered.... some very little thing like an image of what looks to me like a bird... and one of their scientists will come on and say ""that's proof of aliens!""... and the viewer is like um how did they get from point A to point B here.

But it's entertaining to watch, almost comical, I guess.  I get the most enjoyment from watching the wild leaps in imagination from their scientists on the show.  I actually love these guys... they are bought in to the whole thing hook, line, and sinker and they have so much brilliant imagination that they should be making movies.

It's also been a learning lesson for my son who, when they show first began, would ask me to ""be quiet"" when I laughed at one of these guys... but now he's even starting to go ""um, that's silly"".  He's starting to learn that hard facts are just as important as beliefs.",1382140800,,1339,4.477366255144033

However, it is a fascinating theory that can't be overlooked.  After all, the show does ask some pretty open ended questions.  There are things that have been lost to time and history, there are a lot of cultures that mainstream science, geology and archaeologists claim have no knowledge of each other, yet they  have very similar ideas in regards to religion, architecture, and legends.  There are even some mainstream archaeologists out there who admit that extra terrestrials are probably a better explanation than any, but they'll never publicly admit to it.  This is a  show that will be enjoyed by people who loved Erich Von Daniken's ""Chariots of the Gods"" book series (he makes cameo appearances in most of the episodes from time to time), and older shows like ""In Search Of"" and ""Ripley's Believe It Or Not"" (The Jack Palance version), and anyone who has an open mind.  And not only that, but it has Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, that guy with the famously fluffy coif...that Einsteinesque hair of his will grab your attention and then you realize you have learned something.

All they talk about is technological advances and where they might have originated. They are mainly giving all of the credit for human technology and advancement to extra terrestrials. These people are obviously confused and deluded. They will not acknowledge that there is one God and that his son is Jesus Christ. They do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ came to save us from the sinful ways of our current state of existence. Jesus said that he came to save man and not to destroy him.

An excellent series if You don't believe everything you read or are taught.
Love this series as it challenges many aspects of life and of course where and how humans suddenly developed
rapidly over a few short years.
it contradicts much and many of History's facts...
A Great buy and I for one hang out for each new series.
Provocative series that Challenges so much...!

Did the Great Flood really happen Like it is written in all Religions.

With the American populace apparently finding it more and more difficult to sort fact from fiction, a show like this, despite the unintentional humor of it, is actually more of a public disservice and a disgrace than anything else.

4088787,3,B0038M2AWI,"As the title says...

The reason I gave it only three stars is that a lot of the suggestions, and perhaps the speakers themselves seem perhaps a bit detached from reality. Also, there wasn't an option for 3 and 1/2 stars...

The show gives off a great sense of mystery and intrigue, and will leave me nodding to myself, squinting deep in thought of what could have happened long ago. Most of the time it draws conclusions for you that make a lot of sense, but not all the time. They make a lot of good points and connections, but somewhere it crosses the line of common sense/believability for me. It doesn't happen all the time, but just often enough to where I'm aware that I'm  humoring the possibilities for the sake of entertainment. Perhaps I have a low threshold for suspension of disbelief, and I'm not at all saying that it's not believable for others, just not entirely for me.
In terms of entertainment, I like it a lot. I do love watching the show, and it's really fun to toy with the ideas and possibilities it presents.
Also, on a side note, sometimes in the late night/early morning throes of insomnia, the lull of the show is able to ease me into sleep quite effectively. Perhaps it has something to do with the tone of the narrator, eerily relaxing.

So, overall I do really love this show, but as much as I enjoy it I still feel that maybe it asks a bit too much from it's viewers. I'll definitely watch it all the way through and enjoy every bit of it!
I would recommend this show to anyone who is interested in the mysteries of the earth's past and the possibilities of unexplored space. I'd also recommend it to anyone who's into the sci-fi genre. Thanks for reading!

Also the time periods of various cultures they present as being contemporaneous are in fact separated by many hundreds if not thousands of years.

4088964,2,B0038M2AWI,"Do aliens really exist? While I accept the possibility that some life form (alien to ours) could exists somewhere in the vast reaches of the universe, there is nothing in any of the episodes of this program which indicates any form of positive proof.  Apart from some of the more recent ""whack jobs"" (I was abducted by aliens and they performed experiments on me) everything in this series relates to ""ancient"" times.  Why? Because that allows conjecture, theory, opinion without the need for physical evidence.

Take for example the theory regarding the elongated heads of the early Egyptian Pharos. If examples of the ancient arts are to be believed (and some commentators played on this fact) then the elongation of the skulls of these particular people would be seen as ""massive"". And yet, when the remains of the Pharo were finally discovered, we are shown a skull with nothing more than a slight enlargement or elongation.

It should be noted that the majority of contributors to this series have no scientific qualifications and those who do simply use the tried and tested old cover up by stating, ""in my opinion"". By simply stating an opinion, they are not required to provide any physical evidence and by voicing an opinion they have not said anything which may bring their scientific qualifications into question. And if they are not voicing an opinion, they are asking a question, but giving no answers.

It is also unfortunate that having seen one episode of the series, you have seen them all. In each new episode we are taken back to the same old information we got in the first episode, sometimes with a slightly differing view of what it all means, but in reality, it's the same tired old information, over and over again.

So for all those who had input into this series, for all those who did nothing more than voice an opinion or ask a question, I have only one thing to say: ""show me the proof"". Until you can do that, I must accept your opinions as simply that, ""opinions"". Nothing more, nothing less.

Overall, a series that was dragged on for far too long and in the end became nothing more than endless repetition which makes for boring viewing.

While giving quotes from the ancient texts, showing art work and oral traditions to also support the suppositions that star men came from the heavens and helped our civilization advance, the viewer is allowed to make his/her own conclusions or thoughts about the veracity of the script being presented by numerous scientists as they outline and explain the phenomena shown.
 For the most part it is interesting and entertaining and thought provoking.
I personally learned that many indigenous people's religions are based on gods from the skies coming down in ships and providing the people with knowledge, and also with the visitors' wars between/among themselves.
If you are deeply religious Christian and do not want to hear that Christ may have been implanted in Mary's womb by an extraterrestial scientist, than do prepare to feel uncomfortable.

If people on this planet feel that WE ARE IT, stop reading this review right now.  Out of all that out there, there MUST be something more powerful than us.  This show touches basis on things from religion, to making of the pyramids and mayan temples, to stargates and  the list goes on.  It's a simple watch with a simple suggestions.

4089065,3,B0038M2AWI,"I think that this is something that is purely for entertainment. It's not something that gives concrete evidence of ancient aliens. I think that it just shows a different interpretation of the worlds religions and mythologies. If one doesn't choose to believe in them. If one chooses to believe the ancient astronaut theory then they will find it more interesting than a skeptic.

I am a skeptic when it comes to this. Some of the so called 'evidence' is a little bit comical. Suggesting that just because a cave painting or a little statue has what could be interpreted as wearing a 'helmet' or 'suit' is a little bit laughable to me. To me it's an ancient artist's interpretation. Not concrete evidence. The tool marks that 'can't' be made by ancient tools. Well, we weren't there, we don't use those tools. So I can't say those tool marks weren't made by the tool. The showing of so called 'giant' skulls and comparing them with dental impressions and claiming the impressions are so much smaller. Note that the dental impressions are not compared right at the jaw and it looks to me in that scene, the dental impressions are not that much smaller. Most of the 'proof' is conjecture at best. It's just an interpretation.

The discussion of the pyramids and stonehenge, I have to say might be the only 'proof' if you want to call it that. But, where there's a will, there's a way and someone standing behind someone with a whip saying move that stone or else, then they're gonna move that stone.

One thing, if you're offended by someone attacking religion relentlessly, then don't watch it. If you're a Christian and don't want to see your beliefs attacked over and over again, don't watch this. Because all the major religions are attacked in some form or fashion which I don't really like. And personally, I think it's just someone who believes in science trying to 'justify' wanting to believe in religion.

Every time the announcer says ""Ancient astronaut theorists"" you can substitute the phrase ""Tin foil hat wearers"" and as soon as Giorgio Tsoukalos (aka: the Greek guy with the wild hair) shows up, it is the signal to change the channel.

4089378,1,B0038M2AWI,"""Ancient Aliens"" is a series devoted to promote the ridiculous (and ridiculously popular) speculations of Erich von Dniken. Geezus. I assumed Dniken was dead!

The first few minutes of Episode One did give me some entertaining moments of ""dj vu"", since I also believed in Dniken and similar writers...at the age of 12, or thereabouts. Then I read a book debunking Dniken & Friends, and realized that *real* archaeology is even more fascinating than the rather dull explanation that ""aliens"" from Sirius were behind it all.

The rest of the almost 90 minute ""documentary"" was less entertaining. I mean, these guys haven't changed a lot in 40 years, have they? The Nazca lines, the Mayan ""astronaut"" at Palenque, the Hindu vimanas, the Piri Reis map, ""who built the Egyptian pyramids"", Ezekiel's wheels within wheels...

I won't attempt a detailed debunking here (you can probably find it in cheap paperbacks published 40 years ago), but I have to complain about the Euro-centric chronological snobbery which assumes that ancient peoples were primitive blockheads and simply cannot have built large stone structures or ""discovered electricity"" all by themselves. Why not draw the opposite conclusion instead: the Black African Pharaohs of the Old Kingdom really were pretty smart guys. So were, I suppose, their architects.

Another thing that makes my head hurt when watching this are the philistine over-simplifications. The Nazca lines or the Mayan ruler at Palenque fit a certain cultural context, carefully described by competent scholars. So yes, we *do* know that the Mayan ruler is ""descending into the underworld"", rather than manning a space rocket. Yet, Dniken and his followers still babble on about the ""remarkable similarities"" between ancient pieces of art and modern astronauts with helmets?!

Further, ""Ancient Aliens"" lack a proper spiritual understanding. The idea that religious scriptures are really about flesh-and-blood alien astronauts (or is it silicon and green goo?) is another piece of warped chronological snobbery, as if the ancients didn't have a proper spiritual life featuring shamans, prophets and other visionaries of supernatural realities, not ""aliens"" in Flash Gordon outfits. (The only exception would be Michael Cremo, who is a devotee of the Hare Krishna movement. Presumably, he therefore believes that the ""aliens"" really were gods! So what's he doing on this show?)

But the worst thing is surely the illogic of it all. If the aliens came here in hovering UFO-type craft, why did the Nazca people build long ""airstrips"" to make them come back? If the aliens landed in Egypt, why did they teach the Pharaohs stone masonry, rather than setting up a futuristic city in the Nile delta? Why did some alien craft look like the Apollo moon rocket, surely a piece of space junk from the perspective of a civilization that can use anti-gravity to hover in a luminous craft  la wheels-within-wheels? Etc.

I admit that I stopped watching this travesty after about 45 minutes, and haven't bothered watching the other 4 episodes. This really is opium for the masses. And, of course, chronological snobbery! Not even the token sceptics can save this production, which I therefore only award one star.",1362700800,3,3229,5.208092485549133

I tend to agree with the first five books of the Bible as it records a time when 200 of the fallen angels took human wives and birthed a generation of hybrids.  I believe the Ancient Alien series is reviewing the impact these hybrids had on humanity.  Hybrids were enormous in size, called themselves gods, were very hard to keep fed...so, you have massive stones that got moved,  you have human sacrifice worldwide, and an angelic non-human condemned soul combined with a human body that dies.  So what was moving that object when no one else did?  Ancient Aliens takes a look at the possibility of extraterrestrials impacting the world and the human race.  Instead of creating a problem for those of Judeo/Christianity...this only confirms what many already know.  Enjoy the series.",1361491200,,859,4.958041958041958

4089468,1,B0038M2AWI,"How the History Channel has fallen.

In the quest to garner as much cash as possible, the History Channel has resorted to creating programming of imaginary ancient history. It must be very profitable because the series 'Ancient Aliens' is now in its fourth season. Filled with false inferences made from actual research and discoveries, distortions of that same research, and outright lies, the first season of 'Ancient Aliens' is so bad that it will make knowledgable persons want to vomit.  Perhaps that is exactly what the more principled producers of this show do before they make their weekly trip to the bank to deposit the salary they earn from this awful series.

'Ancient Aliens' proves one sure thing. It is this: skillful editing can make anything seem logical and believable. We are all gullible when it comes to viewing skillfully edited and entertaining speculation. We all desire to learn the 'mysteries' of the universe. So we watch garbage like this show that provides easy answers to complex history from the mouths of the on-screen speakers while we fail to notice that they also have their hands in our pockets searching for our wallets.  Like the best  of the political ads we see on TV, the on-screen 'experts' appear very sincere and convincing. The 'experts' seem so sure of themselves that you would never believe that they are either deluded, uneducated, or simply con artists out to make a buck.

The average viewer is not expert enough on the history of the ancient world and cultures. It is not a subject that schools spend much time on and many people get most of their knowledge of pre-history from highly inaccurate films that repeat falsities and encourage myths that perpetuate throughout time. Hey, when I was a kid I thought that all cowboys really were like Hopalong Cassidy.

I am not critical of those who watch this fictionalized history. We are all gullible enough to believe one thing or another. We all like to speculate about the mysteries of life, and if we grew up on science fiction, we all fantasied about aliens on other worlds. However we are being taken advantage of, especially those of us who lack knowledge of the ancient world, by the fakers who made this series. They not only want our money, but also distort our understanding of the real history that is far more interesting than the fantasies that are presented to us in this series.

Before you pluck down some hard earning cash for this historical video con game, do yourself a favor and do a google search for the FREE 3 hour film 'Ancient Aliens Debunked'. Watch it instead. You can find it on YouTube, the 'debunked' website and other places. I'd give you the URL but Amazon edits URL's out of comments.

It teaches us that natural disasters were caused by aliens. They said that if humans built too close to volcanoes, it in turn made the aliens living inside the volcanoes angry. The aliens then erupted the volcano to teach those pesky humans a lesson. You see, Volcano gods were really aliens.

It teaches us that art from the ancient world that can't be interpeted clearly has to be alien influenced. Forget abstract art, they don't believe in it. If it looks like a plane, it's a plane. If it looks like a rocket, it's a rocket. It's it looks like a space guy, there's your evidence right there, it's a space guy. They even try to paint a guy's hat/head in a carving as being an elongated aliens head.

It teaches us that humans are the product of aliens. We are their creations, as one of the alien experts on the show put it. No evidence presented, no facts, nothing of substance. The guy said it, so it must be true, right?

I could go on about how ridiculous this show is. Present me with facts, present me with something of substance. Instead, they try to turn anything involving religion into ""the aliens really did it"". They look for things that are not there in architecture, they paint ancient humans as unintelligent beings, which I find a bit insulting myself. Ancient humans were too stupid to build this on their own, they were too stupid to figure this out on their own with their ""limited"" technology, as they in the show want you to believe. They have a revolving door of ""theories"" that they repeat over and over again. You'll hear this stuff I mentioned in one show, only to hear it in another show, only about a different religion or culture.

The people on this show are not real scientists, they are not trying to present facts or theories of substance, these are people that actually believe in aliens. They don't try to hide that fact either, they mention it several times. One guy says that he doesn't believe in angels, but aliens, oh, yes, it was the aliens that really did it.",1349395200,,2676,4.505154639175258

I can get that anywhere. Some ideas are a little strange, but it's still a great series and I just ordered season 2. I loved hearing Erich Von Daniken, along with many other scientists talk about their theories.

People, Places,& Theories you've probably have NEVER heard of .... SO COOL!!!

Questions are the beginning of wisdom and its' NEVER wrong to Question the status quo.
If your afraid of a question then you should reassess your position and honestly see if it holds true.
Thirty plus years ago I attended seminary for four years and one of the classes that ""Ancient Aliens"" reminds me of is ""Apologetics"" where we had some of the same theories and ideas batted about...

Of the non-fiction ones, most have focused on 20th century photographic and video evidence to propel their arguments.  This series is one of the first to carefully examine the history of alien presence on Earth from multiple sources, including but not limited to religious texts, ancient sculptures, architectural feats, and scientific knowledge that groups of people possessed even though they did not possess the technological skills one would associate with the acquisition of such knowledge.  Split over several episodes, each episode examines one possible aspect of alien presence on Earth; from ancient architectural marvels to scriptural mentions of supernatural figures such as angels and demons.  The series also features interviews and narration from dozens of scientists and engineers who present their interpretations of certain phenomena.

It also dares to address the possibility of genetic tampering and prepares the viewer for seasons 2 and 3, which dig even deeper into the questions concerning our origins.

(I have only seen seasons 1 and 2, so far)  Still they do it in a highly entertaining way, and for some reason, I just can't get enough of this show.  It definitely makes you think.  My main problem with the series is they introduce a piece of evidence, they introduce the traditionally accepted view and then they introduce the alien theory, when there may be some or many other possible solutions that fit.  Still it is a show about Ancient Aliens, and they do put there ideas out there as theories or hypotheses.

4089495,4,B0038M2AWI,"Ok,

  First off, I'm a skeptic at heart and always will be. I never have been,"" Take everything at face value"" kind of person. I started watching this series about a year ago and always had been un-bias when doing so. The series makes you think of the alternative to our common beliefs. How the earth was made, where did human kind come from or how was it created, who or what made Jesus, things like that and more. This series tries to peel away all the mystically, biblical, and or ritual practice's of human society, in which, applying modern thought and technology.

Point's: Good and Bad

  Ok, we all know of the bible story about Jesus, Mary was in Nazareth with her family or tribe, whatever structure you prefer to use. She was not being courted, nor had a suitor, old fashioned huh! nor did she have a family of her own at the time. God comes and gives her a child, Jesus. Now I always thought about why this happened and how. First, I thought of certain medical procedures we have been doing and one came to me, artificial insegimenation, any women can go to a sperm bank and choose what she prefers. Now could they have done this thousand, two thousand years ago, hell no, but since he was a gift to humanity, makes a very good cover story for an alien visit. I'm not bashing anyone for believing in the bible, but modern science can uncover some real truth, again im not right or wrong, just an opinion that makes sense to me. Also, many civilization's document several god's or god coming from the heavens, in which, to mate, have sex with mortal women, WHY, do they need to do this, there GODS, DUH. Sounds like they needed some lovin'.

  Second, the ""Nazca Lines"", very interesting if your in a plane looking down. Anyone that has a logical mind would determine that the shapes are only visible from the air, if on the ground, just be rows of rock and dust. So, why would people, in a desert, way above sea level, which it would be harder and harder to breathas they go higher, I was in the desert for a year, I know this for a fact, with limited resources, why would they do all of this? What were they seeing? Oh, and the mountain's surrounding the valley, where did the top's go, did they somehow crush the rock and use that for the shape's in the valley, Hmm?? These are just some point's tnat were valid to me in the series.

  One last thing, how did they build some of these ancient structures? by slave labor, tens of thousands of wooden rollers, and thousand oxen, bull's, please, the logistical, medical, and resource problem you would have had back then would have been impossible, not even modern day engineer's have a good idea on how to build something like that, even with our modern industrial mite.

I just put some things on here that made me think, now, my brain hurt's, lol!!! I do agree with some reviewer's on here, jumping to conclusions to soon. They do leave out the scientific community a little too much on some episodes. So, have fun, enjoy, and make your own opinion.",1337731200,,3014,4.426763110307414
4089496,5,B0038M2AWI,"I've always wondered to myself when I was younger who these Gods were and who build the pyramids; to my surprise The History Channel and it's 100% credibility finally answered my questions. Aliens did everything. I never knew how useless and stupid us humans were. We could of never thought to of built such structures ourselves and the Holy books from around the world are 100% true thanks to Aliens. Flying Gods in UFO's, Apollo being an Alien, Aliens everywhere doing everything. After watching this season and the others as well, I figured I'd do a little research myself. I wanted to see what else Aliens had done to benefit mankind. Oh boy, was I surprised at what I had found too! For instance, Aliens created the Model T Ford, yes they sure did. They had given Ford the technology and information on how to build such a revolutionary wonderment. Aliens also told him about assembly lines and tail lights.

The Civil War? Completely wrong from what I was taught in school. To my surprise the Civil War was actually a failed Alien invasion. The Aliens had cleverly disguised themselves as humans to battle the north. Why else would they be for slavery so much, my leads and research had concluded that they needed slaves to help them build their Alien Empire, also known as the Confederacy. Them losing though is accurate in our history books. How did they lose? Well, another race of aliens who opposed the Alien Empire had strongly helped us out to defeat them, that's the only logical answer possible.

My point is, according to History Channel, aliens have done everything and we humans lack intelligence and every other skill needed to evolve in society and as countries. I sure hope the History Channel picks up my findings and airs them on this show. I hope to be a guest as well. For I have 16 bottles of hair gel and a Greek alias that no one can pronounce to use just in case I'm on this show.",1337299200,,1909,4.578947368421052

From magic carpets, to magic sheets that helped push the egyptian stones around, even remotely, is unbelievable that people believe this stuff. The mana machine; are you serious?

4089499,1,B0038M2AWI,"I have absolutely NO problem whatsoever with the basic thesis of this series. I is intriguing and it is a subject which has fascinated me for years. My problem is that these guys not only treat speculation as fact, but also show that they often have no idea what they are talking about, especially when it comes to ancient literature. For instance, I have taught almost every one of the epics they have discussed in their programs and there are things that they state about the poems that are downright fabrication. I have thought on numerous occasions ""what version of ""Gilgamesh,"" ""The Ramayana,"" ""The Iliad,"" ""The Odyssey,"" ""The Mahabarata,"" or ""Beowulf"" did they read? They mention things about the stories which simply are not in them! I've taught ""Gilgamesh"" for thirty years and there is no part of that poem where he goes flying around the earth. No, it IS NOT THERE! That is just ONE example of many. Also, they attribute things to ""The Rg Veda"" which are FALSE. It's too bad because wackos like the screwy dude with the funky hair and the Greek name give the whole idea of ancient alien visitation a bad name. He has a degree alright...in SPORTS INFORMATION! That qualifies him to interpret ancient texts? Then there is the whole thing they go into about Ahkenaton's family having weird and elongated heads. What they don't say is that mishapen heads like that have been done as a ""beautifying"" affect in many cultures since ancient times. This was the case in Egypt during the Amarna era...many of the nobility did the same with their children to emulate pharaoh and his family. This does not mean they were ALIENS! Look, I want the ""Theory"" to be true as much as the next person, but stand on true fact...or speculate and hypothesize, but do so in a responsible and scholarly way.

For those of you who've read the works of von Daniken, Sitchin, Hancock, Buval, Childress, ect this probably won't be very powerful, but is a nice visual compliment.  If you're completely new to this I highly suggest the first three authors.  Giorgio Tsoukalos is a co-producer of this series, he's one of von daniken's proteges, he interviewed more than anyone else, and he probably gives the most compelling argument in favor of ancient aliens. The series explores a variety of different theories form a wide range of authors, has a little something for everyone, and provides alot of interesting evidence.  Not all of the presenters actually believe the subject matter, so there is also some balance to the program.  The series spends most of its time theorizing on ancient monuments and how they simply could not have been built using the methods historians ascribe to the time period.  So who built them? Ancient man with the help of ancient aliens.  That's the ebb-and-flow of the series, take a mysterious monument or event and explain it with ancient alien theory.  There's no smoking gun proof of ancient aliens provided here, rather the series insists that ancient man simply could not have constructed monuments of the past (like the Great Pyramid) provided the tools and technology of the time.  Indeed, these great works cannot be reproduced using every available technology today, leading some to conclude that what modern scholars consider history is infact pseudoscience.",1331251200,,1607,5.126436781609195

They never point out that actual archaeologists have thoroughly debunked many of the specific points that they site. For instance, the famous image of the ""Mayan Astronaut"" is completely understood by actual archaeologists who are familiar with Mayan iconography as King Pacal falling through the Mayan underworld to be reborn. These icons have been understood by people who have devoted their lives to studying them, not just glanced at by a hotel manager (Erich von Daniken) who then happens to notice it fits his idea of an ancient astronaut. The whole theory is ludicrous. Other people who have been interviewed who do not totally agree with the hypothesis of ancient aliens have their interviews heavily edited so that it appears that they are in agreement. I have read the accounts of a few who have noted that their disagreements never made the final cut. Simple-minded people are easily led, and people like to have their ears tickled with an intriguing story.

4089515,5,B0038M2AWI,"I rate this FIVE STARS not because I believe any of what these guys are saying, but because I believe this plays more as a parody of alien conspiracy theories. Yeah, I know the ""experts"" probably believe 100% of what they say in their on screen interviews. Especially alien expert, and internet meme, Giorgio Tsoukalos. The man's ability to say the craziest things and keep a straight face is worthy of an appearance on Inside the Actor's Studio! And I truly love that there is no theory too crazy for them to explore: hollow earth, animal chimeras, aliens at Thanksgiving (oh wait, that one was from the South Park parody-- which unfortunately didn't feature Giorgio Tsoukalos). I also give this five stars because no one-- not the director, not the make-up or hair guy/gal, and not even Giorgio himself when he looked in the mirror in the morning-- said, ""Giorgio, maybe you should do something about your hair?!"" Bravo sir! Bravo!

In all seriousness, of course this is all a bunch of unsubstantiated bunk- but it is fun to watch.  Perhaps it is just my job as a history professor that leads me to enjoy watching people speculate wildly with little care for evidence--after all it is the exact antithesis of what I teach my students to do.  It is fun to see them take everything from the U.S. Constitution to pyramids to ancient Babylonian myths and time-after-time say ""We can't say it wasn't aliens.""  We also can't say it wasn't ghosts, or time travelers, or a race of super intelligent cyborg giraffes, that doesn't mean we should claim they were responsible either.

4089518,3,B0038M2AWI,"I was into this subject from the get go, back in the day when Erich von Daniken was doing his thing. A lot has happened since then. von Daniken put forth the basic theory but could only offer a loose amalgam of odd stuff. Well.....now a bunch of folk with letters after their names have jumped aboard and propelled the study to a much higher level.

This is a very decent documentary with a very simple outline. After putting forth the theory, they pose questions and attempt to answer them. In most cases they give very compelling evidence. There is, for my dollar, an inherent sense to all this. There's a lot of weird stuff on earth that starts to form a coherent whole when you bring in the 'Ancient Alien' theory. But I do think they needed to step it up a notch. There are many detractors with credible reasons why they don't buy in. They aren't given any time here and they should have been. After all, the 'Ancient Alien' theory is as profound, if not more so, than possibly any other theories on anything, and they're asking us to swallow this whole without rebuttal. It doesn't work that way. They need to go toe to toe with their detractors. They also do say some pretty stupid things that don't bolster their case. The producers and writers let some things go in the script that would not hold up in the scientific arena.

That aside, this is still pretty cool. They show some great footage of the various places and things they deal with. They have some good talking heads to add flavor and it all progresses in a very logical and orderly fashion. They make a decent case. Something peculiar does happen at episode seven however. The segments go from one hour fifteen minutes to forty five minutes. The narrator changes and they start to repeat things from earlier episodes. I wasn't checking producer and writer credits so I'm not certain what happened here but it was a bit annoying.

4089521,5,B0038M2AWI,"Excellent!! I was and am a strong believer in the ancient astronaut theory. To me, all the material presented here made complete sense. This program shows well-researched contents. The program is presented in an exciting and captivating way. If you even vaguely believe in intelligent life outside earth and a possibility of alien contact, each and every point presented here will reinforce your thoughts.

We humans could not have evolved on Earth. It is simply not possible. Rather than ask the question ""How did man evolve here?"" lets ask the question ""Why would man evolve here?"". Evolution is real. DNA is changing. DNA changes to adapt to nature. Earth has produced countless million species. Each of them was never an accident. Evolution is a slow and continual change to DNA so as to play a specific role in nature. You take even a single species off and nature loses its health. Man is not and has never been a part of this nature. In fact, taking man off from nature will restore its health and vitality back. Man is simply a consumer of resources. At most, man can live more or less in harmony with nature. Man has nothing to contribute. Man has no specific role to play. How could evolution make such a big mistake after two million+ years of perfection? Why would evolution ever produce Man?

We came here. ""God created man in his own image"". Every mythology tells us this absolute true fact. Our DNA was fabricated. Indian mythology mentions that ""Brahma"", the great scientist, created ""Manu"", the first man. Christian mythology mentions God creating Adam. We simply refuse to believe it. We say ""show me the proof that all this is true...that there is intelligent life outside"". Well, there is proof. Our ancestors took the trouble to document all that they saw and knew. These are the mythologies spread across the different cultures and continents. They took the trouble to create monumental structures, holy places of worship, sculptures and paintings to depict this knowledge. Our ancestors ensured the survival of all this knowledge by terming them ""sacred"". Till today, the proofs have survived. It's all in front of us. Yet we refuse to give our ancestors any credit and the respect they deserve. We refuse to believe that our ancestors were intelligent. We refuse to believe what they tell us. We consider the mythologies as mere ""stories"" written for our ""entertainment"". They are not.

I am a bit familiar with Indian mythology. So let me give some examples. A ""story"" mentions a king who decides to visit ""Brahma"", the great scientist. The king goes to the planet (Indian mythology specifically mentions that it's a planet) of ""Brahmaloka"". There, the king has to wait a single day since Brahma was busy. The king then meets with Brahma and returns to Earth. To his dismay, he finds that thousands of generations have passed on Earth. He also sees that he has become a giant. This was written thousands of years ago. We had to wait till Albert Einstein explained these phenomena to us. In ""Mahabharata"", the god of wisdom ""Yama"" poses a question to Yudhistara (a very wise king). ""Tell me, what is faster than light"". Yudhistara mentions that ""nothing in this cosmos goes faster than light, only our mind can go faster than light"". Again, Albert Einstein helped us understand this fact. ""Mahabharata"" was an epic written thousands of years ago. How could someone living in that time even come to this conclusion that light has a finite speed to pose this question ""What is faster than light?"".

""Mahabharat"" goes to elaborate detail in mentioning weapons technology. It talks about ""Brahma-astra"" or ""Brahma-weapon"". This weapon was pictured as an atomic device of incredible destructive power. The name itself is interesting. ""Brahma"", the great scientist, designed the weapon. Scientists designed our atomic weapons as well. In another epic ""Ramayan"", king Rama sends out a missile. After sending it out, he is told that the missile should not hit the target since he was mistakenly told that evil people inhabited the place. King Rama mentions that he cannot take back this missile once launched. So he re-directs it to an uninhabited place. Today, we can perfectly understand this situation. If this epic were a work of imagination, the arrow could have easily come back to its quiver.

The proof is in plain sight. It's symbolic in nature. It's designed in a symbolic way intentionally. Only then can it survive. Symbolism is all around us. Lets look at places of worship across different religions. These are holy places where we go to worship ""god"" so we can ascend to ""heaven"". It's interesting to note that these places of worship resemble space ships and rockets.

Will we ever see them? Will they come here and visit us? They have been coming in the past. They will come again. ""Bhagavad Gita"", an ancient sacred work in India contains a very sacred verse. This verse is quoted everywhere and most Indians know it by heart or have heard of it. The verse goes something like this ""Yada yada hi dharmasya gla nirbhavati Bharata..."". When translated to plain English, we can see why the verse is so sacred. It says, ""Fear not O descendents of Bharata. If there is trouble, we will come"".",1325030400,,5221,4.8672665916760405

4089526,4,B0038M2AWI,"This review is for the whole Ancient Aliens series.
I cannot agree with the present belief system that the universe and our planet just happened to be lucky enough to bare life and ""here we are"". The conventional hypothesis, that earliest living cells emerged as a result of chemical evolution on our planet billions of years ago in a process called abiogenesis. The alternative possibility--that living cells or their precursors arrived from space--strikes many people as science fiction (as most seem to view this series) yet to me that seems more realistic.
That life could exist before mankind and that this life may have explored the stars and happen to find the earth also hits mankinds ego and therefore cannot be true to the minds of most people. To not keep an open mind until all the theories can be proven fake and what remains is proven truth; that is prejudice, plane and simple.
All that being said, this series needs a better structure, and not so much jumping around. I would prefer a more scholarly approach to each subject, yet maintaining an easy to understand format so the idea can take root in the minds of those who think they know it all or are otherwise satisfied with the common beliefs.
I cannot agree with all the findings or assumptions they attempt to make you believe (hence four stars not five). Every one is entitled to their own theories, but in a series or book, facts should be presented while letting the viewer/readership decide for themselves.
One such idea presented is aliens from another world came to earth long, long ago. Okay, I can go along with that. But such a trip would have taken a major undertaking and would not have happened over and over again. So they came, perhaps more than once. I can agree to that. They set themselves up as gods. I can agree to that (look at mankinds own history to lesser developed peoples/cultures). But that they continued to visit us? That most of the UFO's in the last one hundred years are them? I cannot agree to that.
I have read to much from ancient history to just sit back and not believe that life only sprang forth from earth. That only on earth are wars and fights among the intelligent and wise. And really, no matter how huge and powerful the whips were on the backs of slaves, could you really believe ancient mankind could build many (not all of them) of the wonders that remain today?
If your are not a thinking person, open minded and willing to sit back and listen. Then afterward, pickup and pursue the subject that gets your interest most. Then this is not the series for you. However, if you are not satisfied with the conventional beliefs, review this series but consider the subject presented with attentiveness.  Otherwise you may just get caught-up in none-sense.",1320364800,,2769,4.662576687116564
4089527,5,B0038M2AWI,"Years ago I remember first seeing a 2 hour special about ancient astronauts. I was fascinated. When Ancient Aliens launched as a recurring series I was excited. The way ancient stories, legends, and myths are brought together with modern understanding and bringing a modern look to ancient artifacts is eye opening. I have read many of the books this show references.
Whether you believe that the events and theories put forth are true or not doesn't matter. I'm not sure that I think they are right. That doesn't change the fact that good points are made and holes in the accepted version of human history exist. This is an attempt to fill in the gaps and possibly increase our understanding of history and the world. Overall this series is very informative, thought provoking, and ultimately entertaining.

4089543,2,B0038M2AWI,"I'm torn: I love the intrigue of asking 'what if' questions--'what if aliens exist?' and etc.

So I enjoy the inquisitive nature of this series. I also find much of the archaeological and historical data to be quite provocative; many of these seem to require broadening our prior understandings and conceptualizations of ancient cultures to fit finds like aerodynamic carved sculptures that are essentially gliders capable of actual flight and exceedingly similar stories and depictions of 'god-like' or powerful beings from the sky, from cultures on opposite sides of the globe, and etc. This series is not short on data that is mysterious and hard to write off as coincidental.

But, just as often as the series brings up 'conventional' explanations that seem unsatisfactory for the data, the Ancient Alien Theorists make blindingly erroneous, or at least baseless, leaps of logic, connect way too many ideas with very separate historical/mythological contexts and artifacts/phenomena. At the very best, the AA-Theorists are way to generous in equating their 'what-if' speculations with logical conclusions from the data; at worst they are simply cramming their favored explanations into the data provided at the expense of much simpler explanations (Occam's Razor).

For example, at one point (I believe in Episode 4) a tenuous connection is made between present-day atomic weapons and the biblical story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, based on the merit of both being fiery explosions and because Lot's wife was told not to look back at the explosion, which is also similar advice given to people observing the first atomic tests.

Another example would be declaring that certain mysterious figures in several medieval and religious paintings, objects such as small spheres, or points of light, hovering above the other human and religious figures portrayed, are actually artist's depictions of ET spacecraft that they have observed. Admittedly, some of the paintings they show have objects that are legitimately, eerily, inexplicable for the context and date of the painting (my favorite is one showing Jesus and God with a large bluish, metallic-colored sphere sitting between them, and each of them is holding what seem to be antenna--the sphere has a striking resemblance to Sputnik or some sort of satellite (or if one suggests it is the earth, consider that at the time of the painting, the earth was accepted to be flat!).

Still, they proceed to examine another painting depicting Mary and the Immaculate Conception, where Mary is being hit with a beam of light that is coming from a circular object or opening in the sky--from this they assert, confidently, that the Immaculate conception might actually have been an ET artificial insemination of Mary, based on the fact that the originating point of the beam of light is a circle in the sky. I'll explain why this is a leap of logic here: 1) the suggestion of the circle in the sky as anything more than an opening in the sky rejects the very common context of divine power as emanating from openings in the sky and replaces it with the very uncommon and un-contextual determination that the circle is a spaceship (a common argument here is that ancient man did not have the capacity to adequately describe the events or objects perceived and so they used creative, figurative and metaphorical language, the problem is that drawing a machine in the sky is very different from drawing an opening in the sky, it is less likely that the artist had a flying machine in mind when conceiving of the Divine Birth of Jesus when we have ample data and writing that explicitly refers to God or gods opening or coming from the sky. It is a mistake to assume that any ancient reference to gods in the sky means aliens and not simply...that they believed God or gods to actually live in the heavens above earth. This is an assumptive leap).
2)Even if the artist had intended the circle in his painting's sky to be some sort of flying craft, what possible bearing does that have on the true facts or nature of the actual event that we call the Immaculate Conception? What would an artist separated by hundreds of years and folklore be able to say, accurately and more reliably than the earlier, firsthand accounts that historians actually accept, ie from the bible? The point is not that the bible is correct (though I believe it to be) but that the assumption that critical data and insight into the true ET nature of the Immaculate Conception could be found hundreds of years later in a painting created by a totally irrelevant, unrelated, person (not any sort of reliable witness with first, second or even 5th hand knowledge of the event) to the characters of Mary and Jesus.

I could go on and on but I will finish by highlighting a few of the logical errors presented in the arguments in this series:

1) This series consistently commits a fallacy of appealing to 'authorities' on archaeology and historical data who are in fact not even close to being authoritative, ie having earned a degree or done any significant, firsthand research. While there are a few actual scholars and researchers with valid credentials, the majority of the 'authorities' they give time and voice to are simply people (authors, radio talk show hosts, fanboys, amateur historians and archaeologists and gathers of random data) who are already sold on the idea of aliens, who may have some valid points, but should, all the same, not be presented as authorities. It's hard for me to accept their conclusions as entirely objective, considering that they seem to start with their belief in ancient aliens and then read their questions and postulations into the data, rather than examine all possible explanations and going with the simplest, most likely (this, by the way, does not preclude the possibility of aliens from the data, it is, however, proper scientific method, and I reject many of their arguments as speculation because they ignore much more plausible, less sensational explanations in favor of their personal viewpoint).

2) Further, they have a consistent habit of assuming the truth of their speculations based on little or no justification at all. For example, they speculate that certain Egyptian hieroglyphs, which portray a certain pharaoh differently from other pharaohs, with an elongated head, are actually depicting a pharaoh whose head was elongated because he was a hybrid of alien and human. Their justification is that this pharaoh looks similar to our current depiction of grey aliens.

3) Of course, the series is rife with Post hoc, ergo propter hoc, ie, assuming a causal relationship between an event A and an event B, based only on bare similarity and very little hard evidence. Example, two people on opposite sides of the planet see an abnormally bright light in the sky: this fallacy would be to suggest that a) they saw the same light or that b) the lights they saw where different occurrences of the same object or event. Similarity or correlation does not prove or justify anything.

The Good:
All in all, this series has several gems of provocative data of historical and archaeological findings that I have not heard of before, which is enough to make me glad I purchased it.

The Bad:
But I had hoped that this series would provide more solid evidence, logical argumentation and reputable sources and commentary. Instead it is a patchwork of amateur commentary, speculation and very erroneous logical progression.

I am not writing off aliens, but I take everything in this series with a hefty dose of salt, as it seems a very shallowly researched, tenuously connected bunch of mysterious historical anomalies.",1315094400,67,7696,4.980544747081712

4089547,4,B0038M2AWI,"Keeping an open mind, this 3 disk set is very interesting - for anyone questioning or wondering about whether or not we are alone in the Universe.  As a caveat, some of it is ""far out""; a lot of conjecture is made during disk 2 for certain; and some of the narrators are intense in their beliefs, which should come as no surprise when viewing something like this. But there are also a lot of definite areas based on actual facts, places, archeological sites that provide food for departure of thought in different directions.  Since no one seems to know for sure, it is always good to question, reason, try to find out why.  This accounting, set up as a documentary, is at least delving into the mysterious topic rather than ""covering up"" to avoid exploring all the avenues that can't help but be out there.

Take Peru, for example.  Personally, I have always been intrigued by the mystery of the Nazca lines, which are filmed from the skies for this accounting.  They seemed to be far too intricate, far too exact in relative, geometric measurements for something so large to be done by hand with primitive tools, no matter how many people may have been involved; and seemingly made to be observed from the air.  Signals to cosmic visitors by their own kind after having been here, or an early quest to ""invite"" cosmic visitors by the ancients? Or beckoning from below to what ancients revered as Gods just in case they were up there? Whether they were out there or not, it was an amazing feat of engineering design no matter which way your own thought process takes you.

 Whether you believe in aliens or not, or have your own specific ideas of what is what regarding the space around us, this disk set brings a lot of unanswered questions to the fore to be mulled over in your own way.  The sites visited are sites we all are familiar with, and some I had never seen.

4089579,5,B0038M2AWI,I am fascinated by the content presented in these videos.  It is throughly researched and provides you with alternatives on how we came to be.  Does it negate God?  No.  But this does give you a different perspective on how you view God and holy scriptures?  Probably. The reality is that biblical and other writers from other religions wrote down what they saw but given their limited knowledge they could only interpret based on what they knew not on what really was.  Does this mean that early writers really saw angels or was it an interpretation of what they saw based on their current knowledge at the time?  How would we be viewed if we went to another planet that was relatively primitive?  Wouldn't the inhabitants view us the same way man's early historians did?  Would we be viewed as gods or angels?  This set is definitely worth viewing and gives you food for thought.  I am looking forward to purchasing other sets on blue ray.,1301961600,3,941,4.608433734939759

4089600,2,B0038M2AWI,"Let me first say that I have a deep appreciation for the enjoyment many people find in this series.  Ancient mysteries are presented, and that is where the true value of this series lies.  Unfortunately, the conclusions drawn ignore scholarship and archaeology and are often full of outright lies.

In the interest of brevity, I will mention only one such misrepresentation here as an example of why this series should be taken with a grain (or entire shaker) of salt.  In one episode, it is stated that the intricately cut stones of Pumapunku could only have been cut using diamonds or, perhaps, an 'alien technology' due to the stones being so hard.  Unfortunately, a simple knowledge of geology is enough to completely debunk this statement.  The stone used at Pumapunku is diorite, with a small amount of variation around 6.5 on the Moh's scale of hardness.  Other types of stone in the immediate area are in the 8-8.5 range and would have been extremely capable of fine stonework on the diorite.

The ""experts"" presented in the series are often nothing more than authors of non-peer reviewed, unscientific hokum.  The show is essentially founded on the thoroughly debunked assertions of Sitchin and Daniken and presented in such a way that an interested viewer can be easily captivated.  They do a great job of making assertions that *sound* like science but, quite simply, are not.  The series also presupposes the ignorance and stupidity of our ancestors, who had more than enough intellectual and physical capability to create every structure and ""mystery"" presented in the series without the intervention of alien overlords.  Megaliths? -- one man in Michigan creates megalithic structures *by himself* using nothing more than stones and ropes.  The human mind that builds computers and skyscrapers today is equal to the minds that built the pyramids -- no more, no less.

That being said, I enjoy the show in a different way.  It's incredibly amusing at times, and it's always educating to search for peer-reviewed articles on the items the show presents as ""Alien.""  I encourage you to watch the show and then research the sites and items shown in it -- I guarantee you'll come away amazed at how advanced our ancestors truly were and how unnecessary ""aliens"" are to the power of explanation.

Here's where they lose me: Aliens helping Nazis.  The most light-hearted rebuttal first.  Germany lost so the aliens really gave them some crappy help.  I can just hear Albert Speer remarking of the aliens, ""With friends like them we don't need enemies.""  The serious rebuttal.  I've been playing wargames for about 30 years.  I would not consider myself a grognard but I've played some classics.  I've played SPI's War in Europe.  A paper map and chits game.  This game was so huge it had to set up in a pole barn.  I am currently playing Hearts of Iron.  The reason I bring these games up is that WWII and especially the German side is extremely popular in wargames.  Since Germany in WWII is so popular there is not an aspect of German production that has not been examined, researched, studied, and examined again, researched again and studied again.  There are people who know serial numbers on individual tank motors.  There are people who know how many spot welds were used in the manufacture of a FW 190.  There are people who know how many tons of metal Germany imported form Sweden each day.  There are people who know how may liters of syntheticfuel Germany produced each hour.

There is not an iota of German production that is not known.  This is not speculation this is a fact.  There was not any secrete production of alien given technology.  If you really want to understand how Germany produced V-rockets and jet planes play Hearts of Iron.  The short answer is that the devoted R+D to rocketry.",1298246400,3,1765,4.6558441558441555

More on the content:

I have always found Erich von Daniken's (I read CHARIOTS of the GODS when it first came out, at seven years old,) theories refreshing, and even the DaVINCI Code/BibleCode/Bloodline of the Holy Grail onslaught have not shaken my faith...in fact they have added a plausibility to stories I found once far-fetched.

Is is possible that these images/stories are true? Yes. Does that mean a revolution in thinking? Prossibly. Will it negate EVERYTHING we thought up to now? Probably not.

In contemporary history the Native Americans referred to a Rail Road Locomotive as an Iron Horse...the best way they could describe what they saw...with their limited vocabulary. Yet, we KNOW that a Locomotive is not a literal HORSE.

Copernicus dared to presume WE GO AROUND the SUN!
Other NUT-CASES? Gallileo, Newton, Einstein, ...and von Daniken.

Such thought makes plus marks for the arguments presented here. Yet, with One backfiring result. Interpretation, if you allow one side to 'adjust' the words by inserting modern clarifications. Another side can adjust the timeline, as in those religionists which claim Dinosaurs roamed the Earth contemporary to pre-flood humans. (There by admitting they existed, but, not agreeing WHEN they are claimed to have existed.)

Now, that said. The images, and information, interpretations, although slanted in FAVOR of the theories. Is fresh and exciting. (some say Sensationalist, well yeah, Chariots of the Gods DID cause a big sensation in the 1960's, flawed tho' it was.)

The Blu-Ray, being Hi-Def is probably a better image, than many American's got to see through their cable/Satellite provider. It avails itself to viewing-and-cueing for comparisons to original source materials. or, stopping to talk with those in the room, which may bring up a counter-point.(IT HAPPENS A LOT!)",1296950400,13,2557,5.242647058823529

4089619,4,B0038M2AWI,"Those of you who have given this DVD a bad review have to lighten up a little bit. This DVD/TV series is a theory on how ancient civilizations created some of the most amazing and magnificent objects and structures ever created. It simply says ""maybe"" and explains why the ""maybe"" can be explained. I don't see how this is any different than the belief of a God in general. People are so quick to believe a book word for word based on faith, but will consider the idea of aliens absolutely ludicrous. I am not an atheist nor to intend to come across as one. I just am trying to make a point that we simply don't know or have any proof for either - hence faith. Is it logical that aliens came down from the skies and taught humans how to build etc., most likely no, but it is fun to think about and consider. And that is all this series is about, fun. It allows you to open up your mind and consider the improbable. To question the world around you consider different theories. To actually think about something rather than sit in front of the idiot box and watch people go to the bar and get drunk while fighting (Jersey Shore). Is it possible that aliens came down and taught people...yes. That is the fact that makes it fun! It is ""possible"" not probable, but possible. Anything is possible, which is what makes this program so interesting to watch. I love the unknown and always have. Just put it this way. There are billions and billions of stars in our galaxy alone. There are also tens of thousands if not millions of galaxies out there consisting of billions of stars each. Each star is a potential Sun harboring it's own solar system. It is scientifically and mathematically improbable to say that there isn't another planet out there somewhere, which harbors intelligent life such as our own. That to me is the coolest thing in the world (universe if you want to be technical).

I did not quote it, because I cannot remember the exact words. But, I am certain those are close to what he has said. The people who speak here are doctors in their field of study. Therefore make informed commentary's throughout the show. If you are open to the possibilities, this is a great source of information. If you are not, well, I would not watch this show as it will only aggravate and confuse you.

4089639,5,B0038M2AWI,"Ancient aliens. Why does it make sense?...because if you follow evolution then we would not be as intelligent as we are today. Why? What other animal builds sky scrapers? The Earth has been evolving and growing life for up to 4 billion years and humans are the ones to break the sentient marker only 14,000 years ago? buuuuuull crap. Utter bullcrap. Scientists and archeologists agree that our concept of civilization says that literally over night man became sentient and went from eating berries to building structures. How do we know what happened? Let's ask people who were actually there, that let their eyewitness accounts of what happened.

Obviously not every god can be correct. If Zeus is real then why do people have reports of Allah? If Jesus was real then what is the deal with Wandjina? If you read the ancient texts these were actual people. These beings walked among humans and most times mated with them. They were flesh and blood. Many religions state that their gods died (most notably the Egyptian religions), and a lot of gods even had birth days in which they were born, most notably gods from the Maya which have their birthdays coincide with time periods of the Maya calender.

These were flesh and blood beings. How did they get here? On the flying vehicles their religions tell us about. In the Bible, in the Maya code, in Egyptian hieroglyphs...everywhere in ancient texts we are finding stories or flying vehicles. The most famous would be the vimana from the Mahabharata.

We have eyewitness accounts, we have descriptions of space in many old religions and the description of flying vehicles in space. We have everything that we would need other than scientist's OK. To heck with scientists. There are written accounts, visual accounts, mathematics, logic, analogies of modern cargo cults, that all go into the soup to create the truth.

Answer me this question. If ancient aliens did create us from long time ago, wouldn't it be logic that we see, and do see, UFO's flying around today? How else would they know we were here if they hadn't created us?

Were we created by extraterrestrials? Yes. This is a great show with a great message. I love these DVDs.

4089640,1,B0038M2AWI,"The way the subject of ancient aliens is approached by this program, it's sometimes fascinating, and almost a breakthrough, until you actually bother to look at actual facts, and approach things critically and logically.

I love the idea of ancient astronauts.  It thrills me.  I'm in love with exploring the idea, though not to the degree taken in the program of ""aliens built everything and did everything"".

But the program shoots itself in the face by relying on the following piss-poor methods of interpretation and presentation:

- Jumping to conclusions with little to no foundation
- Ignoring critical facts
- Accepting debunked works/theories as fact
- Assuming that ancient peoples were helplessly incompetent
- Wild guesses

I am admitting myself to be biased, but the fact is that the above methods completely destroys this program's ""evidence"" and presentation.  Voting my review down is not simply denying a blind skeptic the chance to bash the program; I have watched virtually all the episodes, even the ""proto"" episode 2 hour documentary from the year before that covered the subject as well.  I've seen incredible examples of potential alien involvement in Earth's history in the form of references in scripture of the Old Testament, the Enuma Elish, and noncanon biblical works, such as one which refers to Noah (the Ark builder) as the ""First of God's new generation""---Battlestar Galactica ahoy!

Erich von Daniken even presents the best evidence, and does NOT leap to wild-[...] accusations like much of the others do.

The nutbag I had noted in an earlier review is Giorgio A. Tsoukalos.  This guy has his hair wildly pushed up and out, an orange-toned tan, and spews some of the wildest, nonsensical, ridiculous statements of the program.  He's vivacious and smiles a lot and loves the subject, but he comes across as utterly crazed (not as in mentally ill or insane) to a degree practically of fanaticism.

As for the program contents itself, going by the points one by one:

- Jumping to conclusions with little to no foundation

The episode ""Gods and Aliens"" begins by telling us that the story of the Iliad was long believed to be fictional, until Henrich Schliemann went to Asia Minor, dug a big hole, and found Troy.  The people in the program then say, this means that the story of the Iliad was true; thus, it's possible that OTHER stories in Greek myth are true, and that Gods and monsters and such might have been ancient aliens.

First of all, the discovery of Troy DOES NOT prove that the Iliad is true.  According to the Iliad, two armies fought outside the gates of the city for ten years, and the Gods DIRECTLY intervened on a regular basis.  According to the Iliad, the Greek army could not make any advances against the Trojans unless ONE man out of thousands, Achilleus, re-joined the army to lead his small group of soldiers.

Schliemann discovered ruins of a big city near the site where Troy is said to have existed.  That is all.  They did not find evidence of men named Achilles, Agammemnon, Paris Alexandros, Hektor, Odysseus, or Apollo's arrows having punctured many men and poisoned them.  All they found was ruins; and not even a singular set of ruins, but MULTIPLE sets of ruins, indicating that the site of Troy had been destroyed many times, by earthquakes or neglect due to mass migrations, or war.

- Ignoring critical facts

If you go by what the ancient alien theorists say, you'd assume the Mayan people suddenly disappeared one day.  And damn those fakers in Central America who call themselves Mayans today!  One of the most audacious theories they suppose is that the idea of ""rapture"" in Christian theology was something that involved alien intervention, and that the Mayans suddenly ""vanished"" from history, so this is somehow evidence that perhaps they were taken away by aliens.

First off, using the fallacy of ""Evidence of absence"", I could theorize that the Mayans evolved into flying squid, and flew off into space, and you can't prove me wrong because there's not evidence that that DIDN'T happen.

But more importantly, the MAYANS NEVER DISAPPEARED!  Their civilization collapsed, due to the usual factors of natural disaster, overpopulation, overhunting and overfarming, trade collapse, revolutions, and outside invasion.  They didn't just collapse and disappear either; Mayans continued to flourish to a small degree, and still exist even to this day.

Another example involves Greek myth with demigods and the Gods interacting with humans, and sexually producing offspring.  Most of the examples given are rather solid, but the idea supposed is that the Spartans were somehow descended from these people, given that they were almost invincible in battle, and their women renowned for their beauty.

First off, Spartans were not invincible in battle.  They lost many battles.  They were not superhuman; in fact, the very reason for their legendary greatness (the killing of babies with imperfections) was the primary reason for their downfall; not enough ""pure"" babies born, they run out of Spartiates, they cannot compete.  Considering that even Spartan girls were given some training in the Agoge, and allowed to participate in athletic competitions, Spartan women were in good physical shape, as opposed to the majority of women in Greece, who were not allowed to do much of anything apart from being housewives.

Another frustrating point; the theories put forth that are so wild and ridiculous, I can't even guess as to what section to put them under: Aliens interacting with Nazis.

Germany was an industrial powerhouse long before the war began.  In fact, Hitler did not magically create heavy industry when he took power; the infrastructure was already there.  He gave people the will to start working and developing heavy armor and weapons, and he collected an incredible cadre of scientists and intellectuals with funding and support for weapons research.

According to ancient alien theorists, weapons projects such as the V2 rocket are somehow TOO advanced for 1930s humanity, and they are the result of alien technology given to Hitler.  Considering this is the same program that has aliens using laser weapons, nuclear weapons, aircraft that can lift off vertically and with very little sound, cause the world to flood (as in the Great Flood), clone, and genetically engineer people, it's a hell of a mystery as to why the aliens didn't give this sort of technology to the Nazis, instead of giving them some rockets and a gun.  Also keep in mind that the Nazis LOST the war, and they probably would have lost it even if the US and Britain hadn't massed and launched the invasion of France in 1944---they'd been fought to a standstill in Greece, and after losing an ENTIRE ARMY in Russia, the Soviets were steamrolling over them on their way west.  They were horribly overextended, losing supplies, losing men, losing everything horribly.

At the very least, the program supposes another idea, that an alien craft crashed in Germany, and the Nazis found it, and attempted to reverse engineer its weapons and engines and the like to best fit them.  You might as well guess that Hitler was the reincarnation of Raptor Jesus, and Nazi soldiers were actually all genetically engineered supermen developed decades earlier by freemasons or Illuminati, because that's about how much evidence that idea has.

- Wild Guesses

People are inherently intelligent, creative, and thoughtful, particularly if they are educated and have time to themselves to think.  The idea presented by these ancient alien theorists would have you believe that ancient people were highly literal and completely incapable of imagination.  They make assumptions that Odin, according to myth, wielded a spear that never missed its target, and thus this must have been a laser weapon or some sort of projectile gun with terrible accuracy.  They assume that because Zeus throws lightning to the Earth, this must mean the Zeus alien had laser beams that struck Earth.

A spear that never misses hardly takes much imagination, particularly if you heighten the military prowess of someone like Odin, never missing with their spear is testament to their skill with the weapon.  Assuming that a spear that never misses must have been an ancient interpretation of an alien projectile weapon is like drawing a complicated constellation design out of three stars aligned together (as in, not something like a belt, but something like a submarine or a lightsaber)

Another such wild guess involves the interpretation that monsters and creatures of myth, such as Centaurs and Cylopses and Giants and the like are evidence that they may have been aliens that interacted with humans.  This is not only a wild-[...] guess, but it's an uphill battle against a far more concrete theory that involves archaeology:

The skulls of Mammoths, Mastodons, and Elephants look vaguely humanoid, and have huge holes in the center of them.  Fossils of such skulls were found by ancient Greek and Roman people---we have written evidence of Romans and Greeks finding such bones in areas where modern archaeologists have found animal fossils.  It takes a whole lot more imagination to assume Cyclops and Giants were ancient aliens than it does to assume that a person finding a Mammoth skull would think it the skull of a one-eyed giant, or finding huge vertebrae or leg bones to be those of giant humanoids.

- Accepting debunked works/theories as fact

I saw it coming, I begged and pleaded not to, I genuinely hoped that they didn't, but inevitably, they did;  Zecharia Sitchin.

For those who don't know, Zecharia Sitchin was a man (who passed away in October 2010) who claimed to have translated ancient Sumerian glyphs, and uncovered evidence that the Annunaki of Sumerian myth were actually alien beings, and developed this hugely, wildly elaborate story of the Annunaki coming to Earth and creating us, Homo Sapien, through genetic engineering with native humanoid creautres on Earth, using us as slaves to mine gold, which they needed for their planet's atmosphere or something because their planet was dying.  He also developed the theory of Nibiru, a wandering planet, which has taken on a life of its own among conspiracy theorists who claimed Nibiru would collide with Earth in May 2003, and now in 2012, because that's the hot pop date to assume armageddon (Hint: The Mayans NEVER implied that the world would end in 2012)

Zecharia Sitchin's theories on this ancient alien theory hold less water than even conspiracy theories on the JFK assassination or the Apollo 11 moon landing.  His theory is completely at odds with physics and astronomy, his translations are horribly flawed, or in some cases totally wrong, and he takes Sumerian myth literally, while ignoring the mythology of other civilizations around the world.

Another point; the Crystal Skulls.  A great deal of information is poured into the theory of crystal skulls being some sort of computer or machine made by ancient aliens.  The worst part is, they even tell the true story about the skulls---that they were carved in the late 19th century Germany---but continue with their ridiculous theory.

- Assuming that ancient peoples were helplessly incompetent

This is a popular one, assuming that early humans were incapable of building big buildings, or harvesting crops on their own, or looking at the stars and recognizing that stuff happened in the sky, and that the moon could have eclipses that could be predicted quite easily, or were incapable of carving figures out of stone, and moving these stone figures across land.

I'm not well informed enough on this point to argue, but I've included several links in the comments section to address this.

I don't really know what to say regarding this.  It's marvelous and astonishing that they come up with these ideas, but it's ridiculous, frustrating, and even offensive the way they use fallacious arguments and non-evidence to support their increasingly more buffoonish and garish theories and ideas.",1293840000,120,12060,5.050984351337708
4089651,5,B0038M2AWI,I also saw this on the history channel. I had to buy it. It was an eye openner. U need to buy and see this. Cant wait for season 2!!,1293667200,,132,3.433333333333333
4089652,1,B0038M2AWI,"To be honest, this is perhaps THE worst show on History channel.  Almost everyone interviewed on the show has this serious confusion between day-dreaming, interesting ideas, well-thought-out hypothesis and theories.  The most used phrase in the show is ""is it possible...?""  Yes, everything is possible, but you need evidence to suggest that it is actually possible.  Sadly, none is given...

Most of these ancient/modern alien ""theorists"" (I have to use quotation marks here because these people can hardly be considered as any ""..ist"") depend on subjective thinking.  Acient drawings that look like aliens, ancient texts describing gods coming from heavens, etc.  Do we know who made these drawings and why?  How skilled were these so-called ancient artists at describing what they saw?  Also, do we know what kind of style these ancient artists used?  Were they trying to faithfully describe what they saw, like Da Vinci, or did they try to express their feelings like Picasso?  Assuming our civilization ends one day and a future civilization digs up a painting of Picasso, should they believe that the previous intelligent creatures meaning us, all have this weird and distorted shape?  According to the way these ancient alien theorists, they should because it is a painting left by the lost civilization.  What if they also dig up a copy of Harry Potter?  Should they believe that we all have magic power?  According to the way these ancient alien theorists, they should because it is a writing left by the lost civilization.

A method they employ often is ""the process of elimination"", which is a powerful method in deducting answers among available options.  In order for the process of elimination to work, one has to assume he/she has ALL the possible options available.  Can we make that kind of assumption when trying to explain an unknown phenomenon?  If we believe we can, that means we assume we know everything about this planet and this universe.  Can we be so arrogant that we believe we know everything there is to know about the universe?  One good example: lunar eclipse.  Before ancient people began to understand the true cause of the eclipse, many ""hypothese"" were proposed, including a dog in heaven swallows the moon.  So, would we ever be able to get the correct answer using the process of elimination BEFORE the correct hypothesis, such as ""Earth is round"" and ""Earth orbits the Sun"" was proposed?  The answer is obviously NO because these correst hypothese were never included in the list for the process of elimination.  The process of elimination is NEVER a good method in explaining an unknown and new phenomenon.

Another ""evidence"" they use is that our ancient ancestors have built things that look too advanced for them.  The idea of some of the ancient technologies were too advanced stems from some of our early theories about ancient civilizations.  When old theories cannot explain facts, the first thing we should do is to modify the old theories, not go to some crazy ideas like ancient aliens.  For instance, we used to believ that most of the ancient civilizations were isolated.  Thus, we cannot explain why many civilizations shared similar stories.  This fueled the belief by many ancient alien theorists that ancient aliens spread the ideas.  So the foundation for this thought is that ancient civilizations were isolated.  however, new evidence show that many ancient civilizations were communicating effetively.  For example, ancient graves about 6000-8000 yeard old found in Western China showed bodies of eastern Asian origin wearing German clothing and Indian head pieces.  This clearly indicates communication among ancient civilizations.  So if ancient civilizations were communicating, then aliens would not be needed to spread the ideas...  This is yet another example of why we should focus on basic science when attempting to explain unknown phenomenon, instead of going to some crazy ideas like aliens...

If these ancient alien theorists want to gain any respect, they should use real science.  Find solid evidence, such as artifacts made by material not found on Earth.  This should not include something that ""looks sooo advanced that it cannot be made by human"".  Because many records have been destroyed throughout history, We don't have a good idea of what ancient people were capable of.  Because of how well nations protect their advanced technology, we have no clue what we are capable of nowadays.  So a solid evidence for alien technology should be something like a material made of an isotope not found on Earth, even better, an element not found on Earth.  That would be THE evidence...

So this show is all BS...",1293408000,27,4687,5.069281045751634

However, this can be portrayed in different documents, epics and texts in the form of moral stories and religion knowledge base. That would have occured.

After going thru this episode, I felt there is no evidence for Aliens visitation. Only technological advancement raise these questions(linking aliens) which would have happned without aliens too. The real question is how this technological advancements happened wihtout scentific/engineering theories. If some reserach happens in this direction, it will be very useful to make more advances which was mentioned in epics.

Again this entire episode is very intersting and bring few facts on the table. However, simply this episode linked to Alien to commercialize things and attempted to convince alines visited earlier.

You'll find the usual experts expressing their theories. These include George Noory (of Coast to Coast fame), Linda Moulton Howe, Erich von Daniken and Bill Birnes (plus others).

My 13 year old daughter and I like to watch this show. I find this show a good contrast to shows like MythBusters which are clearly fact based. This show starts with facts such as an interesting historical site or ""anomalous"" artifact and then layers supposition upon supposition usually to the point of making things laughable. Every episode gives me a good chuckle or two on that count. Even as ridiculous as that is, I find it interesting to see the interesting archeology sites and ""anomalous"" artifacts.

4089659,2,B0038M2AWI,"5 Episodes on 3 Blu-rays, being released on November 23, 2010

""Ancient Aliens"" is a series on the History channel where theories are explored of whether aliens came down to visit our ancient civilizations to help out with their building and feeding them, should they become stuck in a desert for 40 years, etc. There are beautiful shots of the architecture, historians chip in with their two cents, and a narrator ties all the possibilities together with illustrated images depicting what it could have been like, for example if a nice food-making machine fell out of the sky and into the desert for the Israelites. Sound ridiculous? Kinda is. There are five episodes on 3 Blu-ray discs with a running time of nearing 8 hours so they are uber-long episodes: The Evidence, The Visitors, The Mission, Closer Encounters, The Return.

Granted, there are many not fully explained feats from ancient times, one of the most obvious being all the architecture in ancient Egypt with the giant pyramids. Basically with all the giant stones shaped so perfectly and weighing so much without the use of the wheel, it seems impossible to craft. Some ancient stories are passed down that sound similar to a spaceship or rocket landing and/or taking off so putting two and two together equals...aliens gave them the technology and tools and then took it back with them?? They cited fact after fact that made it physically impossible for the Egyptians to craft this wonder of the world with the pyramids, but the historians seem to be operating on the assumption that once you rule out all possible options, the impossible must be it! They brought some giant construction vehicles and then loaded them back on their flying saucers and beamed away into space.

Historians not only cite events that have obvious evidence left behind like the pyramids themselves, but also stories like from the Bible. They try to figure out if a story from the Bible could have been explained better using Aliens. Instead of God coming down with a chariot, it was Aliens and they asked so-and-so to measure a building for them.

I thought this was going to be kind of cool and the historians would have more realistic reasons evidence of aliens being involved but all they are really doing is giving a blanket explanation for lots of wondrous occurrences, documented and not, throughout ancient civilization history. I do not really recommend this one. It's not even as much fun as a conspiracy theory like the X-files. I much more enjoyed ""I Know What I Saw"" about military officials telling the stories of their unidentified flying object sightings, click on the link above to check out my review for that.

Bonus Features

There is a bonus History channel special called ""Ancient Aliens: Chariots, Gods and Beyond."" Some ancient figures were shaped like astronauts so there must be aliens is the short version of this long special which is actually episode 6 and must have been cut from the series that aired.

Don't recommend it. Even if you're a nerd. Or into history. I'm sure it could be a fun or dangerous drinking game that I don't recommend if you took a drink everytime someone said the world ""alien"" or ""UFO.""",1291852800,18,3186,4.834862385321101

If you can get past the occasional speaker talking about their highly speculative thoughts on what the discoveries/texts mean then you will get at the true value of the series.  What I really enjoy about the series is it looks at recent and past discoveries that prove that intelligent life forms existed on Earth thousands of years before we had previously thought. Discoveries such as the ancient megalithic structures found in Gobekli Tepe believed to be 12 thousand years old to the ancient megalithic structures found underwater about half a mile of the coast of the southernmost Japanese island Yonaguni. Many of these structures as in the Pyramids of Giza would be hard or impossible to complete with even our modern machinery. Many of these discoveries shatter our current understanding of the past.

4089662,5,B0038M2AWI,"Ancient Aliens  is a fantastic show that pretty much asks the question, Was human achievement and culture advanced or done by Extra-Terrestrial aid/assistance?

There are coincidences that occur which don't seem natural at all, but at the same time seem near impossible given that cultures in the past supposedly had no contact with one another.

Season 1  contains 5  double length episodes(about 1hr 20min each) attempting to answers these questions by providing you facts and various expert opinions both FOR and AGAINST  the idea of Ancient Alien Astronauts.  The BONUS episode is a great  double length episode which focuses on the controversial book, Chariots of the Gods.

What makes this show so wonderful is the fact it tries very hard to present pure fact.  The information gathered and presented can not be disputed by archeologists because they were the ones who actually discovered it; it all is in how you put the pieces together.

This series examines many alternative theories to explain many of the world's mysteries- Indeed, the entire history of the world.  It does so in an intelligent manner and offers some very compelling evidence to support certain theories (such as that of ""ancient aliens"").

That said, let's not go overboard here.  There is plenty of conjecture and open-ended theorizing going on here as well.  There isn't anything wrong with that at all.  However, I noticed a couple reviewers jumping on here indicating that everything in this series is fact.

IMO, the primary fact here is that there is ample indication that something else happened in human history that mainstream history does not account for.

Not only do extraterrestrial life exist, but interdimensional entities exist as well. We live in a holographic universe, with layers and layers of dimensions, and each dimension is abundant with life. Quantum physics, Einstein theory of relativity, have all proven the holographic theory, that indeed the universe is not solid, but rather holographic.

I feel like we are now finally starting to realize that we are not, have not been, nor will ever be the only ""intelligent"" life that exist. Ancient cultures were a lot more wiser than modern day western society, and they were aware of the subtle bodies that each human being carries, they knew so much about the stars and the planets that even to this day amazes scientist.
