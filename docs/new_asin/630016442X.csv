7803507,4,630016442X,"I watched this movie years ago & I happened to like the movie alot! I don't agree w/ the other reviews @ all! But, to each ur own! I'd say watch the movie. Most of the time I don't agree w/ other ppl anyways. So, make up ur own mind!",1227052800,4,233,3.68
7803508,2,630016442X,"Killer baboons are the hook on which the plot of this one gets hung .The setting is Kenya where the pesky primates have developed a taste for human flesh during a prolonged drought  and go on the rampage devouring anyone unfortunate enough to be in the vicinity.

It is supposedly based on a true incident but very little of the movie rings true in any way .There are only a handful of baboons on display and budgetary restrictions are all too apparent .

The end credits aay that no animals were harmed in the making of the movie .This may wellbe true -and I devoutly hope it is -but the reputation of its human actors ,who include Timothy Bottoms and John Rhys Davies would not have fared so well

Only if you are really into the genre and are prepared to put ypur brain in cold storage for the duration of the picture .",1105660800,3,822,4.318181818181818
7803509,3,630016442X,"I remember quite a few years ago I saw this in a video store and rented it, because it looked cool. I was somewhat let down. Even though the director uses the same filming style that is very like ""Jaws"". In The Shadow of Kilimanjaro is really quite forgetable and redundent. The flim's first muder seen in which a guy in a jeep has a blow out and is then killed by monkeys is a flim highlight, because of how truly scary it is. It ears the film a third star alone.
One other thing I don't like about this film is the ceezey screenply that it has. I think that happens too much in horror films, but then agian most fans of cheep horror films are just in it for the thrill.",1021075200,5,671,4.052631578947368
