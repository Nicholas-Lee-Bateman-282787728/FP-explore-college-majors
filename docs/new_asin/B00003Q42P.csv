1332299,5,B00003Q42P,"This movie is quite odd in that what at first seems to be a modest piece of independent film-making blooms into cinematic cathartic genius. I am not sure any other film has tackled real-life dilemnas of maturation and loss  with such unerring insight while simultaneously making the viewer laugh  through the awkwardness and humiliation(maybe 'The Graduate'). The film's  real triumph lies in the fact the characters all grow up in subtle yet  profound ways right before one's eyes. These characters are likable though  far from perfect. As a result, when the characters make personal  discoveries about life and what it means to grow into an individual who can  find some happiness in this rocky world, we all learn a little something  and share a little of the heartening joy. Humility,passion,the ability to  lose with grace and yet continue to strive for glory,the value of adventure  and experimentation, and ,perhaps most important of all, the ability to  forgive--these are all central themes in this wonderful film. Perfect in  its dorky exuberance, this film will not fade over time.",949708800,,1092,5.107344632768362
1332300,5,B00003Q42P,"First of all, Rushmore as a movie is spectacular.  This is one that no one should miss.  It's filled with drama, laughs, friendship, confrontation and much, much more.  Ever since I saw the trailer for Rushmore back when it  was first released, I wanted to see it.  When I did, I was thrilled.  It's  just such a wonderful film.
Ok, now onto the DVD.  I would like to say  that I own 71 DVD's (including the Criterion Rushmore).  I have no  reservations in saying that this is the finest DVD in my collection.  If  every DVD is done this well, the world would be a much better place.  This  DVD has more 'special features' than 10 other DVDs put together.  Also, the  picture is beautiful (16x9 enhanced) and the sound is spectacular.  You  just can't possibly pack more goodies onto a DVD.  It can't be possible.  I  have never seen such a wonderful job on a title before.
I take my hat  off to Criterion for this disc.  They have outdone themselves this time.  Plus, there couldn't be a better movie to accompany such a fine job.
If  you are a fan of the film, do yourself a favor and GET THIS DVD.  Don't  settle for the regular version; you'll be kicking yourself for a long time.",949017600,10,1184,4.331797235023042
1332301,5,B00003Q42P,"It goes without saying that this film is a classic. But I was pleasantly surprised with how enjoyable, and complete this Criterion Collection is. The audio commentary was great, Anderson & Wilson provide moving and  personal comments about the inspiration behind the story, and they share  all of the film/books they ""borrowed from"" to bring us the  storybook quality of the film. Schwartzman also chimes in with witty insite  on how nervous he was, and how painful waxing ones chest is. Other great  additions are the ""never used"" ""Max Fisher Players""  shorts for MTV, early casting films, photos, a quaintly humourous  documentary on the ""making of"". Down to the charming  ""childlike"" coverart, and ""schoolhouse"" menu screens,  this package encapulates the feeling of Max's world, which is where I'd  like be most of the time...This is the reason I got a dvd player.",948240000,,868,5.049295774647887
1332302,5,B00003Q42P,"One of the most enjoyable movies I have ever seen, and one of the ten best movies of the 1990's.  This movie was, sadly, overlooked at the box office.  This is most likely due to the fact that the main character is an antihero  and is not a completely likable character.  In fact, there is no  traditional protagonist in this movie as all characters are damaged or  flawed.  Yet, the happy niche in life that they find and the way they come  upon and accept their niche is lovely, charming, and touching.  One of the  few movies I have ever bought to own at home.",948153600,8,563,4.276190476190476

1332322,5,B00003Q42P,"The first time I watched this movie, on New Year's eve 1999-2000, I was flabbergasted.  I didn't understand it and I'd even go so far as to say I didn't like it.  But, for some reason, like all Wes Anderson movies, the second time I watched it I enjoyed it and I enjoyed it more and more every time I went back to the well.  Today this is one of my favorite movies.  Wistful, sad, imaginative, it depicts an unusual friendship between a precociously advanced teenager and a terribly childish adult.  I understand that Wes Anderson's style turns some people off, but if you can get into it, I think this is his best work, after he learned how to make a movie, but before he became too full of himself.",1391558400,3,700,4.312977099236641
1332323,5,B00003Q42P,"Rushmore has now become one of my top five movies of all time.  Funny, clever and sentimental, Max Fisher's story takes you back to your own struggles growing up, and finding and eventually, embracing one's own identity.  Tough to watch Max's heart break after his first real love (aside from his mother) returns unrequited, but I enjoyed watching the character take his rejections in stride and allowed it to mold his inner character in a positive way.

Rushmore is a sophisticated comedy, but easily accessible to the masses.  A great movie for fathers and sons to view together as well.  I should add that I can see teenage boys especially relate to the classmate banter in the movie (as well as the borderline ubiquitous references to ""hand jobs"", sigh.  Cringe-worthy as a parent, but funny as hell when you can set that aside while understanding that teenage boys really do talk to each other in this way).

This is by far, one of the funniest movies I've seen, and very much worthy of being part of one's permanent collection.  Show it whenever there's a group gathering, or cheer yourself up when you're having a bad day.  :)

Highly recommended!  Many happy (funny) returns!",1390176000,,1183,4.778325123152709
1332324,4,B00003Q42P,"""Rushmore"" is an off-kilter comedy from an off-kilter director, Wes Anderson. Anderson also directed ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" and ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" to name a few of his films.

Rushmore stars Jason Schwartzman as Max Fisher, a hard-working but underperforming student at the Rushmore Academy. Fisher falls in love with a teacher at the school, and his quest to win her results in some funny situation comedy with a crew of strange characters, including Bill Murray in one of his absolute best performances.

If you're a fan of Wes Anderson, or if you are new to Wes Anderson, see Rushmore. It's a really funny movie that makes a strong statement about coming to terms and accepting yourself, despite of your flaws.",1385510400,,739,5.0

A nastily funny, yet touching take on the ""coming-of-age"" tale.  One of the best comedies of the 90s.  Wish Anderson would collaborate with Owen Wilson (the co-writer on this) again.  Here, there is no ""twee.""  The interplay between Schwartzman and Murray is comic genius.  Arguably Bill Murray's best work.  The ""Lost In Translation"" ennui has its seeds in this performance.

1332338,5,B00003Q42P,"Comedy is so subjective. Some people want American Pie, The Hangover, or the latest Eddie Murphy movie, while others prefer gentle indie comedies such as Little Miss Sunshine.

What makes you laugh?

I often think about my own sense of humor and it's difficult to pin down at times. I tend to avoid cheap laughs or things done for shock value, and I admire intelligent dialogue and quirky or original takes on everyday situations. One director who never fails to make me smile is Wes Anderson. He definitely falls into the quirky category, but there is so much more to his movies than that.

Rushmore is Anderson's second movie, coming two years after his debut, Bottle Rocket. Both movies were written with Owen Wilson, and they have a similar feel. Anderson is one of those directors who appears to make movies about nothing and it's easy to sit there wondering what you just watched. But, unlike many comedies, there are deeper themes present. I usually find myself thinking about Anderson's work several days after I see the movie. That's the case this time, and it's the main reason I am writing this review.

Rushmore stars Jason Schwartzman in his first role. He plays Max Fischer, who is a 15-year-old student at Rushmore, a private school. He's there because he wrote a play in second grade and won a scholarship. Most of the students have rich parents, but Max's father is a barber and Max has to lie and claim that he's the son of a brain surgeon in order to gain acceptance.

Max is struggling at school and is informed that he'll be expelled if he flunks another class. His main problem is not one of intelligence, it's his lack of focus. He takes on so many extracurricular activities that he doesn't have time to work on his grades. We see snippets of Max indulging in each of these activities, such as beekeeping and fencing, and these snapshots give the movie a lot of charm. It reminds me of Amelie and some of Jeunet's other work in that regard.

As usual, something feels odd in Anderson's world. This effect is heightened by the dialogue. For example, Max sounds as if he is much older. He talks so seriously and it's funny that someone of that age thinks the way he does. Watch him direct Serpico for the school play and you'll see just what I mean.

The heart of the story involves an unusual love triangle. Max befriends Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who is a wealthy tycoon and former student of Rushmore. They both develop feelings for Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), who teaches at the school.

I won't reveal any more of the plot, because it doesn't really matter. All you need to know is that Rushmore is a typical Wes Anderson film. He'll surprise you at times, make you laugh, and leave you wondering how he came up with such original ideas.

I should also mention Mark Mothersbaugh, who began his association with Anderson on this film by contributing to the soundtrack. Other music used in the film includes songs by The Kinks, The Who, The Faces, and John Lennon. They all add to the nostalgic tone and fit perfectly.

Owen Wilson doesn't appear in this one, but Luke and Andrew Wilson are both involved. If you appreciate quirky comedy, Rushmore won't disappoint.

The Criterion Blu-ray offers a superb presentation. Colors are natural throughout and you'll feel as if you are standing next to the characters. The special features are also noteworthy and the highlight is a 55-minute feature showing interviews with Murray and Anderson on the Charlie Rose Show. Fans of commentaries will be happy that Anderson, Owen Wilson and Schwartzman appear on the commentary track.

If you are curious about the appeal of Wes Anderson, Rushmore isn't a bad starting point. It won't work for everyone though.

Overall score 4.5/5",1348185600,3,3749,4.722817764165391
1332339,5,B00003Q42P,"I'm a late comer to Wes Anderson Films. My first was his latest, ""Moonrise Kingdom."" I was so impressed that I have begun to watch his other movies.  As a lover of good books, films and art, Rushmore completely blew me away: I believe one of the best movies in the past 30 years.

Within the classic plot of a teenage boy coming to grips with adulthood through his academic and social experiences, we see Max mature from a lying and unrealistic dreamer to a grounded young man who knows himself and his calling in life. To illustrate with just one example: at the start Max tells people that his father is a ""neurosurgeon.""  By the end of the movie he's proud to be honest about his father, a barber. The last scene of the movie is the perfect ending where Max changes the dance music to a soulful and joyful song: resonating God's grace and reflecting the joy of the friendships and family relationships that have endured and been created. This in spite of and because of the failings, dishonesty, meanness, desires, hopes, abilities, beauty and love portrayed. Wow!

Finally, I must comment that I was amazed to see the negative reviews. That's why I took the time to write this quick review. It frightens me that people can be blind to the virtues so deeply and masterfully woven into this movie.",1344124800,,1299,4.562231759656652
1332340,5,B00003Q42P,"The Movie:

Easily Wes Anderson's best movie, this is Wes Anderson ""for the rest of us."" It is nowhere near as arch or twee as his later movies. It still has his quirky style and music usage, but the characters are actually relatable and the plot is relatively straightforward. It has a number of noteworthy performances, especially the central three, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia Willliams. I've seen it a good ten times in the last 13 years, and it is a rewarding view each time.

The Blu-Ray:

This is an EXTREMELY impressive transfer. Criterion did a fresh 2k scan under the supervision of director Wes Anderson, along with a thorough clean-up of dirt and print damage. Detail is superb both in close-ups and wide-angled shots. Facial detail is outstanding, among the best on the format. So is cloth texture - some of the tweedy and hounds-tooth jackets are amazing. Colors are lush and vibrant but free of any bleeding or over-saturation. Black levels are stout and never waver, but still retain perfect detail near black. Grain is stable, light, and omnipresent. There is no edge enhancement, noise reduction, or anything untoward or artificial. This looks as much like the film as a Blu-Ray can, and I say this having seen it three times in the theater.

I did some comparisons between the Criterion DVD and the Blu-Ray, and the difference is literally like having Lasik surgery or something - practically every shot is crystal clear, and is competitive with the best high definition video out there today.  This is not one of those discs where you won't be able to tell the difference between BD and DVD. It is an absolute slam dunk upgrade.

Better still, all of the comprehensive extras and commentary are carried over from the previous disc. So sell it, use it as a coaster, target practice, whatever. There is no need to hang onto it. It has been totally and utterly destroyed in quality by the new Blu-Ray.",1334275200,23,1932,4.769461077844311
1332341,5,B00003Q42P,"My favourite film.  Maybe.  My favourite Wes Anderson film.  Definitely.  Before his obsession with whimsy eat up everything in his creative wake, Anderson's film about one teenager's crush (brilliantly played by Jason Schwarzman -  he too has never been better) on his high school teacher (Olivia Williams) is a joy to behold, and that's even before taking into account the hangdog perfection of Bill Murray's millionaire love rival.  A superbly chosen soundtrack accompanies set piece after set piece, which together with excellent dead pan dialogue makes this film a delight.  Whimsical?  Yes, but whimsical with a heart and thank god not whimsical for whimsical's sake (see the rest of Anderson's oeuvre in ascending date order).

I've quoted it probably weekly ever since I first saw it. Sadly, for a good 8 years, I've had to put up with the Touchstone DVD of this movie. The Touchstone DVD is, frankly, one of the worst transfers you'll ever see. It's non-anamorphic, every shot is really pixelated, and the colors are dull and drab. Just terrible. Fortunately, Criterion has given us this bluray which is a revelation. Watching this on bluray was like watching the movie for the first time. Vibrant colors, very fine film grain, the true aspect ratio the film was originally shot in, etc. The bluray transfer is gorgeous. I've never seen the Criterion DVD transfer which I'm sure is loads better than the Touchstone DVD, but I doubt it's this good. This is the only way to watch Rushmore. Unless if it ever goes back into theaters, which isn't likely.

I don't even like ""artsy movies"" but the writing is incredible with unforgettable characters. It's not for everyone, but this replaced Terminator 2 on the top of my movie list. I never thought that would happen.

Anyway, the Blu-ray copy is perfect. Aspect ratio is in it's original form. The audio is in original 5.1, however, remastered to remove ""noise"" from the tracks. Video quality is really good however, there's some scenes that have a blurry image. One scene [SPOILER], where Dirk first finds out that Herman and Rosemary are seeing each other[/SPOILER], is the only scene that stood out with the blur. Outside of that (which is how it was originally filmed), it looks perfect.

If you're just wondering if it's a good upgrade from the DVD copy, it certainly is and well worth it for fans of the movie or fans of good dry comedies.",1322179200,6,953,4.666666666666667
1332349,4,B00003Q42P,"Rushmore is a fantastic film for many reasons. As someone who lives in Houston, it's still amazing to think that a big portion of Rushmore was shot here. This little independent gem was more than likely your introduction to both director and Houston native Wes Anderson and actor Jason Schwartzman and what an introduction it would turn out to be. Anderson would go on to continue giving us quirky yet extremely heartwarming films while Schwartzman evolved into a very talented actor and worked with Anderson on several other occasions. Once you hear Bill Murray say, ""Yeah, I was in the @#$%,"" you know you're in for something special. Rushmore is just what every comedy, independent or otherwise, should be.

The love triangle between Max Fischer (Schwartzman), Herman Blume (Murray), and Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams) is one of the things that makes Rushmore so good. Each character brings out the best in the others while their flaws only seem to strengthen the performances of those around them. Max is devoted to so many activities and clubs around Rushmore Academy that he finds himself on the verge of expulsion from failing grades, Ms. Cross is still grieving her husband who only passed a year ago, and Mr. Blume is one of the richest guys around, finds himself in a failing marriage, doesn't know how to act around people, and has a drinking problem. The rivalry that develops between Max and Herman is just extraordinary. Nearly any scene featuring Bill Murray is incredible anyway, especially the hospital scene where he shows up with flowers and rides with Max in the elevator. The restaurant scene where Max is drinking and confesses his love to Ms. Cross is really exceptional, as well. Mostly because all three of the of the main cast have the chance to shine.

There's this sense of quirkiness to a Wes Anderson film that you can't find anywhere else and that's its charm. Anderson also has a knack for picking some pretty memorable soundtracks and knows how to make a scene look better than it should, but his writing is what stands out the most. Flawed people and unusual dialogue and situations; that's a Wes Anderson film at its core. Maybe that's why his movies are so easy to relate to since nobody is perfect and everyone finds themselves slipping up from time to time.

There's just something about Rushmore that speaks to you whether you relate to one of the characters, love Bill Murray, or have a thing for independent film. It's awkward and touching when things get heavy and hilarious and lighthearted when things are more laid back. It's well-written, you actually care about these eccentric characters, and the performances are top notch all around. Rushmore is one of those films you just have to see; you HAVE to. It's the type of film that latches onto you and never lets go while you're more than willing to let it stay as long as it's willing to stick around.

Rushmore isn't loaded with special features, but there is some really great stuff in what is included. The Making of featurette and MTV Movie Awards Shorts are the must see features. The Making of ""Rushmore"" is the lengthiest (around seventeen minutes) and is mostly just a brief behind the scenes documentary shot by Eric Chase Anderson, Wes Anderson's brother that includes interviews and a rundown of the cast. The EPK (Electronic Press Kit) was shot for something like five months, when most films shoot them in a matter of days. When you consider that bit of information, it's kind of surprising that the footage they shot wasn't used to make a full-length documentary. The MTV Movie Awards Shorts are brief (three segments, each about a minute long, and a thirty second introduction), but are just fantastic. The shorts are theatrical adaptations of films from 1999 including The Truman Show, Armageddon, and Out of Sight. If you liked Max's plays in the film, you'll enjoy these.

Other special features include cast auditions, a film to storyboard comparison, storyboards, an episode of The Charlie Rose Show Featuring Wes Anderson and Bill Murray, the theatrical trailer, an image gallery, and audio commentary by Anderson, co-writer Owen Wilson, and actor Jason Schwartzman (which was recorded in 1999). There's this pretty incredible collectible poster included inside the case and an essay by film critic Dave Kehr included in the liner notes, as well.

Criterion Collection, as you've come to expect by now, has made Rushmore look and sound better than it ever has before. The Blu-ray is a digital transfer of the director's cut, which was supervised by director Wes Anderson with a DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. The film is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio in 5.1 surround sound and is approximately 93 minutes long. The Rushmore Criterion Collection Blu-ray will be released in stores and in most online retail outlets on Tuesday, November 22nd.",1321833600,5,4866,4.920828258221681
1332350,5,B00003Q42P,"The film that established Wes Anderson as a major American independent
filmmaking voice, after his very promising  debut with 'Bottle Rocket'.

Quite simply one of the most original films about adolescence ever
made. An unlikely love triangle between a unique oddly brilliant 'cool geek'
teenager, his teacher and a local business tycoon that's
simultaneously funny, absurd and heartbreaking.

Jason Schwartzman is great, and Bill Murray may do his best work ever -
side-splittingly funny, but with a damaged, sad, sometimes dangerous
edge just under the surface.

As in all of Anderson's films, terrific use of songs as score,
wonderfully inventive transitions and visual framing. And a lot of fun.

The Criterion version has notably better
picture quality, and some terrific extras (the regular release is
pretty bare bones). It's more expensive, but worth it for a film

1332352,3,B00003Q42P,"When I began to watch ""Rushmore,"" I had no idea where it was headed. There seemed to be no direction of the story and I was ready to be bored for an hour or two. I was close to even turning it off. In the end, I realized that would have been a huge mistake, because I would have missed out on a great, little film.

Max Fischer (Jason Schwarzman) is in love with the school at which he attends: Rushmore Academy. He's the president of chess club, German club, and French club, as well as the founder of the dodgeball society, the Max Fischer players, and tons more. He's also the worst student at the school. As it begins to look gloomy for Max, things begin to brighten up when he falls for a first-grade teacher, Miss Cross (Olivia Williams). Unfortunately, Max isn't the only one who has his eye on the teacher. Mr. Blume (Bill Murray) falls for her as well. The two duke it out for Miss Cross' feelings as Max juggles with love, friendships, school, and a play about the Vietnam War.

I always thought of director Wes Anderson as a filmmaker you either love or hate. Not to say that I despise him or his films, but I just never really ""got"" them. I fell asleep during ""The Life Aquatic"" and although I liked ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", I wasn't thrilled or engaged by it. ""Rushmore"" works the best for me, mainly because of how focused it is. It's the observation of one character unlike say ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" Since this is the case, I have a better time trying to understand what the certain character is doing and why, instead of having to switch back and forth between many characters.

Jason Schwartzman is Max Fischer. Determined, caring, awkward, obsessed, and upset, Schwartzman does it all. Bill Murray is great as Max's enemy. The dialogue between the two is well done and never feels forced. Their dream girl is played beautifully by Olivia Williams, who does a remarkable job. The rest of the cast do fine as well.

Wes Anderson moves the story along at a fairly slow pace, which actually benefits the story. I particulary enjoyed the off-kilter editing that he employs throughout the film. I found it to be a nice parallel with Max's mindset in every situation that he is in.

Overall, ""Rushmore"" is a good film. As I said before, Wes Anderson is a director that you can either take or leave. If you enjoy his films, you'll certainly enjoy this. Even if you're not though, it's still worth checking out. It may move at a slow, deliberate pace, but it's got a great story to tell, filled to the brim with great characters and some solid direction.",1204934400,,2564,4.493562231759657

1332355,5,B00003Q42P,"This is going to be a little hyperbolic, so stand back.

I think that at the heart of it, the thing that I love about this movie is that it does what real comedy is supposed to do: It allows us to be witnesses at the creation of a new society. Ultimately...this is an eschatological point. That's why the banner at the dance at the end: ""The Heaven and Hell Cotillion"" was such an uncommonly brilliant touch.

The unique genius of the character of Max Fischer is that, without being a solemn watery-eyed plonk about it, he brings people together. He is a failure in academics, but the form that his manic inclusiveness takes is to create weirdly elaborate stage productions at his school and to found school clubs around the full variety of things that could possibly interest anyone...including beekeeping. At first, his inclusiveness is imperfectly benevolent because it involves pretense (He's ashamed of his father, and he spurns the attentions of a girl his age in favor of the mild and beautiful teacher Olivia Williams) but later, as the result of among other things his crushed romantic ambitions, he reforms himself and even befriends the most malevolent character on campus by giving him a great role in one of his bizarre and spectacular theatrical productions.

No review of this movie would be complete without mention of Bill Murray's performance. He was perfectly employed as the cynical industrialist that also falls for Olivia Williams and comes under the spell of Max Fischer. If you thought Murray was good in ""Lost in Translation""...this role is in some ways the same, except much funnier, much sadder, much richer, much more humane.

At the end of Max's last school play (about Vietnam and complete with real dynamite explosions and safety glasses for the first few rows in the theatre), an Indian janitor is shown laughing uproariously. This scene was pure heaven to me. That is the laugh I expect to hear at the end of the world when it's found that there is a place at the table for everyone.",1189209600,,2016,4.7844827586206895

1332357,5,B00003Q42P,"Since making his directing debut with the 1996 cult caper film ""Bottle Rocket,"" Wes Anderson has established himself as one of film's most exciting young directors. His second film, ""Rushmore,"" is a witty, heartfelt and often amusing film that features a hilarious performance by Bill Murray.

Anderson wrote the quirky script with his right-hand man, actor Owen Wilson, with whom he also collaborated on ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" The story follows the trials and travails of high school student Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a sharp kid who focuses his attention on a plethora of offbeat extracurricular pursuits (fencing club, Latin, playwriting) rather than his studies.

In between attending to his various activities at Rushmore (the name of the private school he attends), Max develops a crush on Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), an elementary school teacher at his school. He also befriends Herman Blume (Bill Murray), an eccentric millionaire whose two sons attend school with Max.

Things soon fall apart for Max: The school expels him, Miss Cross denies his flirtations, and Blume begins courting Miss Cross himself. That sets up an extremely funny tete-a-tete between Max and Blume, highlighted by the scene in which Blume runs over Max's bike with his car.

As the intriguing love triangle of Max, Blume and Miss Cross plays out, Max finds solace in his caring father and a female student at his new school. The ending, which features all the characters coming together to watch Max's newest play, is entirely satisfying without being hokey or cynical.

Schwartzman, the nephew of director Francis Ford Coppola (""The Godfather""), exhibits a great knack for comedy throughout ""Rushmore."" But Murray steals the show with a masterfully funny turn that scored him a Golden Globe Nomination and Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor. In one unforgettable scene, Herman suggests that his sons invite Max to their birthday party. ""There's gonna be girls there,"" replies one. ""Yeah,"" adds the other, ""Get your head out of your a--."" Murray's initial deadpan reaction will have you howling; his subsequent reach into the back seat to pummel his son will have you rolling on the floor.

Anderson, who captured the Independent Spirit Award for Best Director, exhibits a sense of craft that's rare for comedic directors. Rather than depend solely on physical gags or even amusing one-liners, Anderson uses set direction, art direction and music to enhance his vision. Even if your sense of humor doesn't jive with Anderson's, you'll walk away from ""Rushmore"" with an appreciation for his careful attention to detail.",1179792000,,2647,5.245862884160757

1332371,5,B00003Q42P,"This is what a movie should be.

First, it is clearly a work of art. The premise of what is was about sounds boring but a movie is a product of its creator not the subject matter. The director brought this to life.

Secondly, the actors were great. Bill Murray created a character that was complex, pathetic yet also at times likeable. He is a steel magnate that is impressed with Max and then competes with him over a girl. The concept of a man ignoring  his big business and pre-occupied with the little things in life is charming.

The Max Fisher character is a brilliant original. A fifteen year old that is charming, devious, manipulative of the world and at times downright scary and evil. The supporting characters are also great and all are very quirky.

Lastly, the Brittish wave soundtrack enhances the story.

This is a very hip, smart and innovative film. This movie has been imitated in style but , at the time, the deadpan sense of humor and we, the makers of the movie are smarter and cooler than you attitude, was very fresh.

I really feel like this quirky comedy-drama is curiosity.  I was tempted to give it 1 star to counter all the rave (and undeserved) 5-star reviews, but my honest opinion is that it's average.  While it is very interesting in some ways, being odd and different does not (as many lemmings apparently think) make this a masterpiece.  And just because you don't fall all over yourself about it doesn't mean you don't appreciate the director's talents.

The characters and situations are a little out there, and a couple of times I found myself waiting for Max's dream sequences to end -- only to discover that the film continued on, and they weren't dream sequences at all.  This is not a movie that reflects real life, but in some ways it acts like it is trying to.  If you can get over that, you'll end up enjoying it, I think.

1332373,4,B00003Q42P,"Rushmore is a quirky and delightful motion picture directed by Wes Anderson (Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou) and starring Jason Schwartzman (Simone) and Bill Murray (Groundhog Day).

The movie is similar to classic films like Harold And Maude and The Graduate in that it's a story of a young man who becomes infatuated with a teacher at his school, an older and much wiser woman.

The movie pursues Max, played by Schwartzman, a loser, who somehow fits into many clubs at Rushmore private school including theatre, cheerleading, and the debate team. He meets Herman Blume, played by Murray, a well off businessman and father of some of the boys at the school, who thinks Max is a genius. Max also meets Miss Cross, a British elementary teacher, whom he becomes attracted to. Max introduces Miss Cross to Herman and the two become more than friends in no time. Max is left feeling betrayed by Herman and fooled in thinking that he can actually get Miss Cross to be all his. Max's hilarious escapades as he attempts to take revenge on Herman and Herman's retaliations are some of the funniest scenes I have ever seen.

The movie features music from 70's artists such as Cat Stevens, who also provided music for Harold And Maude adding another close similarity to the 70's classic, John Lennon and The Faces.

1332376,5,B00003Q42P,"i think ""rushmore"" has alot in common with it's protagonist. it's smart, it knows that it's special, it wants to be a crowd-pleaser, but it's completely out of tune with how 1998 thought they were supposed to be presented. but that's what's so special about ""rushmore""; it's defined by it's subtleties, but it's so bold that you can't overlook it. it's a very quiet story with a loud representation. we're seeing everything through max's eyes, where his world is dramatic and almost animated, but always with max or the people he almost cares about centered in the frame. this is really a drama disguised as a comedy, but that's okay. the humor is nice and welcoming at the beginning, but then the plot kind of takes over and at that point we're too involved with it to notice. it draws us in because it's funny and stylish, but we stay because of what's at the core of it. and what's at the core of it is a genuinely moving, and actually a somewhat realistic story. then we get into the technical aspect of it. this achieves alot cinematically with it's wit and visual appeal. the pacing and dialogue is pretty similar to The Graduate, but it makes you wonder why it took 30 years before a similar movie of the genre could walk in it's footprints without shame. There's not much popular culture references as there are what might be called unpopular culture references to charlie brown and mod britain (look at max's clothing), and i think it kind of adds a more timeless quality to it. this does take place in 1998, but it could have been anytime really. the humor isn't ""intellectual"", it's just humor with max trying too hard to sound like an intellectual (which is a joke). it's not the funniest movie you'll ever see, but it definately has it's moments (favourites include any of the plays and the dinner scene) and i like it because the jokes are hit-or-miss, but at least it's amitious and when it hits, it hits hard. i HIGHLY recommend that you invest in the criterion version. i'm not going to bs you, it's expensive, but ""rushmore"" was made to be loved and if you're one who gets into it, the origional release probably won't be enough. i payed half the price, but i wasn't satisfied and ended up shelling out the extra cash, and that's alot more money than it needed to be. the extras are pretty great and the picture quality is tweeked to perfection; they just added the extra polish, but it shines even brighter than i remembered it. this is a visual film, so those things do make a difference. as far as criticisms go, i'm probably not the best person to defend this because i'm so in love with it. however, i will say that i don;t think the style really takes away from or makes up for the movie, because i kind of think that it's sharp and distinctive just like the characters and the dialogue, so i think that if it is remembered for it's ""style"" than the whole thing is remembered just as well. if there's anything that ""rushmore"" can be disliked for, it's not flaws. you can criticise what you don't like, but wes anderson got exactly what he wanted out of this movie and it's obvious that he didn't just let errors slide. this is his vision, definately a ""love it or hate it"" one, and this is what it was supposed to be. when 1998 is being recalled, ""rushmore"" isn't the box-office hit, but it's one that will be remembered and acclaimed for years to come.",1118880000,2,3377,4.483766233766234
1332377,5,B00003Q42P,"Though nominally a comedy, ""Rushmore"" manages a tonal breadth equal to that of any film one might care to mention- from the giddiness of first love to the blankness of the umpteenth heartbreak, and everything in between, without grinding a single gear, probably because sadness is latent in even its funniest moments, and humor lights the edges of even its most depressive ones.

Having seen all of Wes Anderson's movies up through ""Life Aquatic"", I would add that as sure as his directorial hand is, the single most powerful element in any of his films is Jason Schwartzman's prodigious ""Max Fischer"", a character that has already achieved classic status in the annals of American film. The smartest thing Wes Anderson has ever done is waiting until the right Max came along (Schwartzman was located after a four year search). This is one of those performances that makes it impossible to see anyone else in the role.

Movie starts out with some clever Schtick and some mild laughter over protagonist, Max Fleishman's chutzpah.  But how many times do his antics save the day, NOT MANY. As additional characters Bill Murray, and easy on the eyes school marm, enter the scene, the plot thickens into a love triangle, then thins back into celibacy. Max's glibness and my belief that there must be some BIG moment to justify all the critical acclaim did keep this writer watching until the end. None of the others in my viewing made it that far before nodding off.

Some high points include those involving Max's barber, come neursurgeon father.  We do learn another whole side of Max when his downfall results in his following in his father's hair cutting footsteps.

1332380,5,B00003Q42P,"I find the reviews of this movie to be just a little polemical, and , frankly, ridiculous.  First of all, you cannot criticize other people's taste because you did or did not think this movie was funny.  If you did not think it was funny, okay, but don't call everybody else snobs because they think it is.  Nobody called you dumb, yet you are so quick to call other people stuck up.  Sounds like insecurity to me, like maybe the movie just confused you and you feel bad, so you take it out on others.  Also, people aren't stupid if they don't laugh at the film.  They just have a different sense of humor.  But, if you only laughed one time in the whole movie and then say, like one reviewer did, that you ""knew everywhere this film was going"", well, I would like to see you prove that.  It sound like a cop out for not getting the film.  You don't have to laugh, but again, don't criticize others who did laugh.

Secondly, just to clarify, THE HUMOR IN THIS FILM IS NOT SUBTLE.  That is such a typical statement about the film, and it drives me crazy.  The humor is RIGHT THERE, on the surface, and you don't have to be some brain to get it.  It is simply different than the mainstream.  Don't sit there and say it's subtle so you can feel better about yourself for liking it.  The film's humor is very noticeable, not rocket science.

The parts of the film that are subtle are the social observations about class and what have you.  In fact, the humor and unique logic of the film kind of block it from view. If you view the film as a kind of fairy tale allegory, it makes more sense.

Well, I think the film is a masterpiece, far superior to Anderson's other films, which are good, but not up to the level of this movie.  It is much more than just a coming of age story, which is all anyone ever seems to say about it here.

1332382,4,B00003Q42P,"After hearing so much from both sides of the fence about idiosyncratic director Wes Anderson, I feared that I would perhaps develop an active dislike for RUSHMORE, his second feature (and the first of his films that I have seen). I'm all for style, but not when it takes over story and characters, as some have suggested Anderson's style does. As it turns out, though...I kinda like RUSHMORE. In its own offbeat, unsentimental way---and perhaps in spite of its main character, the sometimes monstrously callow 15-year-old Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman)---it has a charm to it that I found engaging, even as I was wincing at some of the things these characters were doing.

RUSHMORE is basically a coming-of-age tale, in which Max learns to overcome his narcissism and grow up a little. But it is done in a way that never makes it as cloying and sentimental as other movies of its type. By the end, instead of feeling manipulated, you feel some genuine warmth in your heart at how it all turns out (even if it's not necessarily a clean resolution).

Of course, RUSHMORE is a comedy, not a pure drama, and, while I found some of its humor funny (its funniest moments come in the first half of the movie, while Max is still getting an education), overall I didn't find it very memorable as a comedy. In fact, sometimes its supposed wit seems to be a bit like Max---rather in love with itself. And Anderson has a very strange film style: RUSHMORE is perhaps one of the only widescreen (2.35:1) movies I've seen that STILL feel cramped, since a lot of his close-ups are framed with the figure squarely in the middle. That, and those close-ups seem almost oppressively close-up, often with a figure staring straight at the camera (only the old Japanese filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu has done something similar with the framing in his movies, and he often used the classic 1.33:1 frame instead of Anderson's wider canvas). When you see the movie, perhaps you'll see what I mean. It's...interesting, to say the least.

Still, for all its self-consciousness and its weirdness, RUSHMORE is an enjoyable and refreshing little coming-of-age tale, one that has heart but always remains charmingly offbeat. If nothing else, the performances---particularly Schwartzman's, maybe a little too good at bringing this occasionally bothersome character to life---make the movie work.

But, I was hopelessly drawn to them in minutes, and interested in what they were going to do or say.
Bill Murray excels in this movie. Forget ""Lost in Translation"", THIS film contains his best work. He truly shows an emotional scale that ranges from A to Z.
The supporting oddball characters are mercilessly intriguing. Just when you think they're coming out of left field (or from another planet), they show their humanity. End result: you end up liking them...a lot.
The music is right on target, especially Cat Stevens. The instrumental portions are appropriately playful and memorable.
I loved this movie. It's a masterpiece.
The packaging is superb, and the DVD contains enough bonus material to make this one fine purchase. Yep, it costs a lot, but the old adage is true: You get what you pay for.",1078185600,16,1031,4.639344262295082

But this is one of the very few instances where the potential of DVD technology has been fully and briliantly exploited. You can read the list of special features for yourself in the product description. Let me assure you that the technical enhancements make this transfer look glorious even on a regular television, and the content of the commentary track and other extras truly add to the Rushmore Experience.
If you love this movie, the Criterion Collection version is worth the investment. And my local video guru tells me that it's now out of print, so if you've had it on the back burner, don't put it off much longer.
On a personal note, if Bill Murray doesn't finally win the Oscar this year for Bob Harris that he earned for Herman Blume in 1998, Hollywood should fall into the ocean.",1074211200,8,1127,4.668341708542713

1332389,5,B00003Q42P,"Wes Anderson followed up the wonderful ""Bottle Rocket"" with ""Rushmore,"" a coming-of-age romantic-comedy-drama that actually seems halfway plausible. Wittily-written, well-acted, and solidly-directed with plenty of amusing quirks.
Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) attends the elite Rushmore Academy, and is perhaps the most unusual student there -- he's part of every club and team in Rushmore, but failing all his classes. He encounters an odd friend of sorts in the unhappy magnate Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who is impressed by Max. At the same time, he befriends the smart, pleasant teacher Miss Cross (Olivia Williams).
But Max's world is turned upside-down. When he tries to build a magnificent aquarium in honor of Miss Cross, he's expelled from Rushmore. Worse yet, he learns that she's having an affair with Blume, who's every bit as attracted to her as Max is. Will Max, having lost what defined his life (namely, Rushmore), be able to bounce back?
""Rushmore"" is one of those movies that Wes Anderson does really well -- it doesn't fit neatly into any one category, it's smart, it's funny, and the characters are endearing in a weird, quirky sort of way (especially when engaging in a sort of revenge one-upping, for the love of the teacher). It somehow manages to be sweet and pleasant without being schmaltzy or boring.
The writing is humorous, but not the sort of snort-hee-hee comedy that most movies have. (The limpest humor in here is the ""O.R. scrubs"" joke, and then it's clearly meant to be lame). Max's particular brand of dynamic brilliance is outlined best in the Vietnam-based school play, a mediocre idea raised to amazing levels. And unlike most movies of any kind, it leaves you thinking. Are the places we WANT to be the best places for us to be? Or would we really be happier elsewhere? Are the people we adore the people we should be with?
Max is an unusual character -- smart and mature, but somehow not quite as mature as he thinks he is. He always aspires to climb higher and higher, and clearly sees no end to how far he can go, and Schwartzman does an excellent job without being obvious about it. Bill Murray does a fantastic job as the depressed magnate who doesn't like his life as it is. Williams does a less amazing job, but is good as the center that the other two revolve frantically around.
""Rushmore"" is a different but fully worthy follow-up to ""Bottle Rocket,"" and it definitely won't disappoint Wes Anderson fans. A wonderful movie by a fantastic director.",1069372800,3,2500,4.857142857142857

Rushmore, starring Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, is about a 15-year-old student, Max Fischer, who attends an exclusive prep school who puts all of his time into extra-curricular activities, and meanwhile fails in the academic department. Murray is a depressed tycoon, Blume, who meets Max, and the two form a friendship. However, things turn for the worst when Max falls in love with a teacher and Blume does, too. Their friendship ends...but let's just hope it has a happy ending.
Note: if you like good music, the soundtrack and the original score is excellent--British Invasion. My favorite part of the

1332393,5,B00003Q42P,"""Rushmore"" is the second film by director Wes Anderson, who has found himself a quaint, innovative style of writing and directing that works on many levels. This film is the story of Max Fisher(Jason Schwartzman), a teenage pupil at Rushmore Academy. Max is unique in that he isn't as rich as his other schoolmates; he's there on a scholarship that was given to him after impressing the head of the Academy with a play he wrote when he was 7(it was ""a little one-act about Watergate). Max is also possibly Rushmore's worst student, but is its most extracurricular, frequently founding groups and putting on plays. Blume(Bill Murray) befriends Max, they seem to have some kind of unspoken connection that Blume can't find with his wife and kids. But they both fall for the same woman, a teacher at Rushmore, and both are determined to get her.
  This is just the basic outline of the movie, there is so much more to it. There's a subtle glance here and there, there's a sadness in almost every one of the characters, and it all results in a very poignantly sad, funny, and sincere movie. The music is dead on perfect, ranging from The Who to Cat Stevens, and it all works magnificently.
  The DVD has some wonderful cover art (it's nice to see more than the lead actor's giant heads on the cover) that fits perfectly with the quirky tone of the movie. There are some wonderful new special features, such as commentary from Anderson, co-writer Owen Wilson, and Schwartzman. The commentary from Anderson and Wilson is somewhat entertaining, whereas Schwartzman is only occasionally so. The main documentary about the movie seems somewhat rambling and without focus, but still works. There are some really interesting auditions from Schwartzman and others.

His performance makes the viewer question if they are watching a 15 year old boy or a 30 year old man.  The scenes are setup perfectly and you can see them flow from storyboard to movie screen with the intricate sets and backgrounds.

NOT the expected prosaic tiresome coming-of-age story with sight gags and crude jokes, rather this is a witty offbeat approach (by Wes Anderson - ""The Royal Tenenbaums"") to that time in life that empowers, disappoints and inspires us.

1332401,5,B00003Q42P,"Max Fischer tells us that the secret of life is to find something you enjoy and do it for the rest of your life. For Max, it was going to Rushmore. For Herman Blume, it was a never ending quest to find ""his Rushmore"". And that is the basis for the sophomore effort from director Wes Anderson and his screenwriting partner Owen Wilson. A good part coming of age story of both young and old and part dry comedy, Rushmore excels on every level with an outstanding ensemble cast, a obscenely witty and smart screenplay, intricate set design, and the perfect 60s Mod soundtrack of coming of age music.
Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is a middle class teenager who gained a scholarship to the prestigious Rushmore private school (he wrote a one act Watergate play in the first grade) and he's a star in dozens of extra curricular activities which have a negative effect on his class work. Max's chapel partner Dirk Calloway seems to be Max's only real friend and acts as Max's assistant (because you need one when you have ambitions like Max does). Max is able to have a incredible clout at Rushmore and he's skirted around the grades issue before by sweet-talking his way with the administration.
Enter Henry Blume (Bill Murray) a wealthy industrialist whose sons are idiots, marriage is falling apart, and he's enamored with Max Fisher because he seems have the self contentment Blume can only dream of. They enter an unlikely friendship where Max is the son Blume never had and Blume is the man with the pocketbook who can help Max's over ambitious projects come to fruition. One catch, they're both in love with the same woman, Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams), a widowed elementary teacher at Rushmore. We're never sure why anyone here would really be attracted to each other but that adds to the fun.
The film is quite endearing, which is carried by the amazing performance of Schwartzman whose Max will one minute have you pity him and the next mad as hell. Max's ambitions early in the picture are all of triumph, but soon they get out of control and he's lost. Our 3 central characters are all alone but seem to continuously destroy their relationships with each other because they seem to be afraid to be happy. The sad soul lying underneath the film makes the character's final triumph all that much more sweet. Before the end Max has to allow himself to find his ""Rushmore"" outside of his former school, Blume needs to come to terms with his middle age monotonous life, and Miss Cross needs to move past her deceased husband. Only one man can make this happen and that's Max Fischer who ultimately does this through the help of Dirk and the new girl in his life Margaret Yang at his new school, Grover Cleveland, who like Dirk has appreciation of Max's mass aspirations.
At any point Anderson and Wilson could have let their story tread into standard coming of age ground but throughout it stays fresh and vibrant. We have to tip our cap to Max's glorious ambitions because we'd never have the audacity to even think about such things while Max acts on them. Bill Murray brings in the performance of his career as he manages the bulk of the deadpan humanity of the picture that is slapped on every frame. Like Max, we don't know why we should even care for this man but we do, and the same can be said about the picture in general. We're not sure why we like it, but we do.",1044057600,4,3380,4.579207920792079
1332402,5,B00003Q42P,"Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"" is one of my favorite comedies. At times outlandish and at other points heartfelt, it's one of the best trips I ever took to the cinema. This Criterion DVD is so good, though, because the special features, including other plays from the Max Fischer Players, added to my enjoyment of the film.
Max Fischer, played by Jason Schwartzman, is the worst student at Rushmore Academy, though not because he doesn't apply himself. He is in every available club at the school, commandeers many of the extra-curricular activities, petitions to save the Latin program at the school and knows all of his teachers. But he's also failing his actual classes, has no ambitions beyond being the lord and master of Rushmore and has so much passion, in fact, that it clouds his reason.
Max's passion becomes particularly troublesome when his focus turns to Miss Cross, the widowed first-grade teacher who's just joined the Rushmore staff. Her love for Latin and poetry, in addition to her incredibly refined beauty, drive Max to outrageous lengths in the name of love. He recruits a rich yet soul-defeated man, played by an Oscar-worthy Bill Murray, to fund his ultimate monument to Miss Cross, an aquarium in her late husband's honor. Only Max doesn't get anyone's approval to build the aquarium first, which leads to major disaster for him and all else involved.
Max uses his heart, then his head. That's his greatest aspect and his ultimate failing. That's what makes him a compelling, funny character, one with which members of the audience can quickly identify.
The screenplay, by Anderson and actor Owen Wilson, is smart and funny. Visually, the film is quirky and beautiful, in its way. The acting is stellar, even from Schwartzman in his first film.
Check out the DVD's use of drawings, as well as its audition tape reel. Good stuff.",1041811200,8,1847,4.923076923076923
1332403,5,B00003Q42P,"[The following is a review of the Criterion Collection DVD for ""Rushmore"", and not the movie proper.]
Wes Anderson, a self-described film buff and devotee of the Criterion Collection, must have jumped out of his boots when he found out the company planned a deluxe DVD edition of his second feature film, ""Rushmore"".  But he probably didn't jump as high as I did the first time I found this DVD in my hot little hands.  The features included here follow standard DVD format -- audio commentary, photo galleries, video featurettes, behind the scenes footage, etc. -- but done at an excessively high level.  They do the film, one of my all-time favourites, deserved justice.
From the main menu, which features the innocent sketches of Eric Chase Anderson, Wes' brother, and snippets from Mark Mothersbaugh's renaissance-style soundtrack, you can select from amongst the Rushmore AV Club, the Audio Commentary, the Max Fischer Players Presents, and Archiva Graphica.
The Rushmore AV Club features various behind the scenes and promotional video clips.  The first, ""The Making of Rushmore"", is ostensibly an Electronic Press Kit, filmed by Eric, intended to be longer (it runs nearly 17 minutes) and more in-depth than most EPK's.  Eric shows that he's come by his Anderson genes naturally, as he proves himself to be an observant, low key, and amusing documentarian.  The film is basically an annotated introduction to the crew and cast, with an oddball explanation of each person's job.  Favourite moment: on his last day, Bill Murray does his interview while getting his head shaved.  He convinces Eric to do the same.
The Storyboard sections, which include an option to watch the film's opening scene while Anderson's storyboards play below, are instructive and illuminating.  Anderson's simple pencil sketches look like they were drawn by a 6-year old, but planned out by Alfred Hitchcock.  They are at once juvenile and precise.
Next we get a complete episode of ""The Charlie Rose Show"".  I'm a big fan of Rose, whose interview style, while often times erratic, never fails to get something interesting from his subject.  And when your subjects are Bill Murray (who takes the first half hour) and Wes Anderson (who does a neat 20 minute segment to close the show), how can you go wrong?  Murray is charming and thoughtful and insightful (and, duh, funny).  Anderson, visible tickled that he's talking to Charlie Rose, is matter of fact about his talents and his film, while engaging Rose in a wonderful little conversation.
Finally, this section includes the film's theatrical trailer.
Next from the main menu is the option to turn on the film's audio commentary track.  Shared, although unfortunately not recorded at the same time, by Wes Anderson, co-writer Owen Wilson, and star Jason Schwartzman, the track is a treat.  Especially for fans of the three men.
You can tell they are all film fans.  They deliver the track as if in conversation, sitting next to the listener in a darkened theatre while the film plays in front of them.  They talk in stage whispers, so as not to disturb the viewing enjoyment of those around them.  It's quite sophisticated that way.
Anderson knows what he wants, and knows how to get it.  And he'll tell you how, if you're willing to listen.  ""Rushmore"" seems like a serendipitous experience for him.  He's grateful for all the luck he had, from the casting of Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, to figuring out that the locations, to having a vast repository of influences to draw upon at just the right moment.  This is even carried through to a story about the genesis of his relationship with Owen Wilson.  But Anderson is not just lucky; he's smart, and he works hard to make his own luck.
Wilson comes across as more of a spiritual guide to Anderson than anything.  That's not to say that he had any less to do with the screenplay, for it's obvious that he more than pulled his weight.  I mean that it's Owen's charismatic personality, his charm, and his wit that the less captivating Anderson can latch on to.  And, though he tells some truly interesting anecdotes about how ""Rushmore"" came about, he really needn't say anything of substance.  That slow, Texas drawl just gets me every time!
Schwartzman's contribution surprised me.  In interviews he comes across as an unbound-Id, always ready to leap feet first into any situation and make the most of it.  But here he candidly admits that, and this shouldn't have been a surprise seeing as he was a first time actor, he was scared witless about being in the film.  But as he relaxed into the role, he brought a lot to it (putting the gum on the wall was his idea).  And even though it was intimidating at first, he seems to have developed an honest and sincere relationship with Bill Murray, one that he treasures to this day.
The Max Fischer Players Presents section features four delightful video segments.  First you get the on-camera auditions of the principle young actors: Schwartzman, Ronnie & Keith McCawley, Stephen McCole, Mason Gamble, and Sara Tanaka.  McCole, especially, has a grand old time, sporting a smile on his face as he spits out his lines in a luscious Scottish brogue.  The next two features show some of the artwork Max put together for his two plays-within-the-film: ""Serpico"" and ""Heaven and Hell"".  Finally, The Max Fisher Players, a repertory company made up of high school students, re-enact for the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards ""The Truman Show"", ""Armageddon"", and ""Out of Sight"".  They are at once satiric and respectful and innocent.  A real joy.
Finally, in Archiva Graphics, you get a motherload of ephemera, including posters, promotional pics, and close-ups of all the in-film art.  The detail that Anderson is so noted for is exhibited for close examination.
Even if the film weren't currently in rotation as one of my must-watch-over-and-over movies, the Criterion Collection DVD offers so much ""Rushmore""-related material that it would probably still never leave my DVD player.",1029628800,14,6012,4.926587301587301
1332404,5,B00003Q42P,"This movie is perfect in every way, though I will admit that it is not for everyone. My (ex)girlfriend and I had a long distance relationship, and I urged her to see this movie. She did, and she hated it. I have said in other forums that this is a ""litmus test"" movie, I didn't realize how accurate that was. The casting is brilliant, the story is brilliant, and the movie is extremely funny. But through it all, there is this melancholy undertone that I really connected with. I wish I could say I was like Max when I was in high school- but I wasn't. I was a smart aleck, though, and I thought I knew everything about everything. I guess that is what strikes a chord with me- the Max character does everything that I WISH I could have done back then, but still... there is this innocence about him that is really touching. I really wish that I could have watched this movie with my girlfriend, I think she would have gotten a lot more out of it. Oh well, as Max would say, C'est la vie.
The Criterion collection edition is absolutely brilliant. The most important feature is the full length audio commentary, featuring Mr. Wilson, Mr. Anderson, and Mr. Schwartzman.

1332405,5,B00003Q42P,"This movie is sheer brilliance. It's hard to tell whether this movie is a romantic comedy, or a coming-of-age drama. The plot circles around Max Fischer, who is an over-ambitious, extra-curricular high school student, whom befriends a Mr. Herman Blume. Both Max and Blume fall in love with the attractive and interesting first grade teacher, Miss Cross. The love triangle affects Blume's and Max's relationship in both a humorous and somewhat saddening way. All three characters are well-defined and the directing and photography are simply beautiful, with the use of the fall season to set the background. Every single line of the film is said with such a brilliant charm, it has to be seen to be believed. Many will not find a whole lot of comedy in this film without repeated viewing, but it is well worth it. The fact that Max is virtually blind to the age difference between him and Miss Cross brings a smile to my face with every viewing. Also, Mr. Blume sees himself within Max's personality, and is probably some of the reason that they form a friendship in which they both respect each other and resent each other. In the end, they find their relationship to be a great treasure, and is one of the reasons this film is so beautiful. I don't know whether this is a comedy or drama, but I love it, and those who don't might want to give it another or even a few more chances.

1332407,1,B00003Q42P,"I was surprised to find out that this movie was considered a comedy. I didn't laugh once, nor did I even know when I was supposed to. I thought this movie was a badly done drama. Very rarely do I ever rate a movie as ""bad"". Most movies in general are at least ""decent"" to ""tolerable"" and rarely bad. This movie exceeds bad and goes on to horrible.
The surreal, bizarre behavior of some of the characters in this movie are not only outside the realm of being remotely believable, but they make the people in American Beauty seem mild-mannered. So much of the stuff the characters do that you see happen has no relevance whatsoever to the plot, that its all bizarre filler. The movie drones on for what seems like forever, and much of that time is spent trying to figure out what's going on, and when you finally do, you do not really care. Once you do figure out the basic plot, you come to realize how asinine it really is. I really should have walked out on this movie when I went to see it in the cheap theatres. It only cost me a dollar. My father who saw it with me agrees with me, as well as everyone else in the theatre was visibly unimpressed by this worthless film.",1026777600,15,1173,4.241071428571429

1332412,5,B00003Q42P,"I have decided that we need more films like this one. I propose to start a club dedicated to making good, quality films. Even if it's without the approval of the Dean.
Or we could just talk about how great this film is.
""Rushmore"" stars the son of Talia Shire(""Rocky""), Jason Schwartzman(of the highly-awful SLACKERS) in his debut performance as an overachieving student of Rushmore Academy named Max Fischer. Max does everything one could possibly do at a school except for keeping his grades high which suffer due to all the activites he works on. He runs clubs dedicated to stamp-collecting, astronomy, fencing, and debating, just to name a few and when he's not doing all this, he's directing ""hit-plays"" like SERPICO, based off the film of the same name.
His friends consist of Dirk(Mason Gamble), his chapel-partner; Mr. Bloom(Bill Murray in a quiet, understated breakthrough performance), the owner of a metal/construction-plant; Bert Fischer(Seymour Cassel), his father; and his love, ""Miss Cross""(the beautiful Olivia Williams)...
It ain't that easy, unfortunately. For someone who has done it all, Max doesn't have it all. He's only Dirk's friend because he likes his mother, he likes Mr. Bloom because he mistakenly thinks Bloom thinks the same way he does, him and his father are close but are more like friends and Mrs. Cross doesn't want to be romanitcally involved with Max because Max is a minor, for the love of God. On top of all of this, his fellow peers can't stand him as he ruthlessly and sadistically uses them to achieve his fame and steer his ship, the school he calls Rushmore Academy.
RUSHMORE is beautifully written by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson, well-acted, expertly directed and at times, slightly touching.
Bill Murray turns in an expert-performance and Jason Schwartzman is equally good. The fantasically set-up cinematography is a thing of beauty, a work of art, almost as if it came out of a master-director's playbook. The art-direction is like something out of a science-book from the sixties complete with the generic-yearbook font. And it all comes together to form a mosaic, ironically like one of Max's stage-plays.
The funny thing about it is, this seems to be a surreal tale of kids and adults battling in a scholastic enviornment, but it's really about a group of mature adults, getting through their respective lives, discovering who they are, growing up to be the adults they've longed to be. It could be taking place in the real world in a business office, a tale set in an ancient society, or a small town in America, but it doesn't. The performers aren't supposed to play the characters they're assigned, yet like a Max Fischer Production, here they are. The setting is at a school, and the storyline remains the same, yet the characters are changed slightly...you can interpret this film many ways.
The Criterion Collection DVD is one of the best I have ever seen. Great sound and picture and the extras! My, oh my! You get a featurette on the making of the film, Charlie Rose interviews Wes Anderson and Bill Murray, a great audio-commentary track by the filmmakers and actor, Schwartzman, an amusing set of stage-plays based on OUT OF SIGHT, ARMAGEDDON, and THE TRUMAN SHOW that will crack you up if you've seen all three films, cast auditions, storyboards, posters...this is a great DVD, just like the film.
Go to Rushmore. You won't be disappointed. One of the best films of 1999.",1023148800,,3435,4.913941480206541
1332413,4,B00003Q42P,"In the recent avalanche of movies about teen angst in high school, Rushmore is easily the best. It doesn't cover any new ground, but it presents us with some funny and eccentric characters who carry on in a story line that becomes increasingly more hilarious and improbable.
Max Fischer [Jason Schwartzman] is the nerd equivalent of a high school jock. Rather than earn letters in sports, Max gets involved in - and usually is president of - every club on the campus of the private school, Rushmore Academy. He's in everything from the bee keeper's club to the drama club, for which he also writes all the plays. Though obviously smarter than the average jock, Max shares with sports figures a tendency to let his extracurricular activities ruin his grades.
Max befriends Herman Blume [Bill Murray], a wealthy benefactor of the school who believes that the rich students should be ""mowed down,"" probably because his own sons are idiots. Since Max's father is a barber, he thinks Herman is right on.
Later, Max falls for a young teacher named Rosemary [Olivia Williams]. Though Rosemary sensibly points out that it would be ridiculous to have an affair with a fifteen-year old boy, Max is persistent. He enlists the aid of Herman, who winds up having an affair with Rosemary himself. This leads to an all-out war between the two. Eventually Max gets expelled, but finds new strength in a public school.
The fun element in Rushmore is the tendency of the characters, who reside in a normal setting, to react in abnormal or unexpected ways. Everyone is just a little batty, much as they were in the great comedies of the 1930s and 1940s. Yet they remain lovable. They possess traits we can often relate to. Herman may be a tycoon, but he can revert to adolescent behavior when pushed too far. Max is often defeated, but he is such a natural leader that he just moves on.
Rushmore is fairly unique in that it does not follow the popular gross-out formula. This absence of bathroom humor is a nice change.
If it has a theme, I think it must be that people who appear to be outsiders often find their way by interacting with others who are the same, even though there is a danger that they may kill each other in the process.",1016755200,,2219,4.634517766497462
1332414,5,B00003Q42P,"Rushmore follows its central character, Max, through the quirky perils of his high-school experience.  Creatively brilliant (yet tragically over-involved), Max is unrelenting in his pursuit of recognition and the love of an elementary school teacher at the private institution he attends.
The performances by Jason Schwarzman and Bill Murray are utterly outstanding.  Director Wes Anderson infuses the film with a quiet giddiness and natural grace that's rarely found in contemporary cinema.  From the off-kilter dialogue all the way down to the mesmerizing Brit-pop soundtrack, Rushmore is nothing less than a delight.",1016755200,,619,5.78021978021978
1332415,5,B00003Q42P,"Rushmore is an exquisite piece of film, full or rich and subtle detail, humor, and insights into the human heart. Anderson has a keen eye, and the tableaux he provides for the viewer are inspired. From the quirky Victoriana of Rushmore Academy, to the working-class grit of the Fischer household, Anderson's camerawork delights the eye.
Jason Schwartzman, who plays the protaganist Max Fischer, turns in an excellent performance. Bill Murray and Olivia Williams are also great to watch, and the trio has an irresistable chemistry. The kid who plays Dirk Calloway, Max's sharp but morose chapel partner, is absolutely hysterical.
Rushmore is a very clever coming-of-age story, and the beautiful blending of story, character developement, images, actors' performances, and music make it one of those movies that remind you why you fell in love with cinema. Anderson and Owen are true masters of their medium, and their other works Bottle Rocket and The Royal Tenembaums are also must-sees.

1332418,5,B00003Q42P,"Simply one of the best movies in recent memory, Wes Anderson's Rushmore is the sweet, sad story of Max Fischer, prep-school enthusiast and terrible student.  Equal parts character study, deadpan humor, and coming-of-age drama, Rushmore is that strangest of creatures - a sad comedy.  All the performances in the film are brilliant, but Bill Murray's melancholy millionaire is the highlight of the bunch.  The cinematography here is brilliant and steals effectively from films as diverse as Barry Lyndon and The Graduate; Anderson knows how to show off his actors rather than gloss over them, and the film is that much better because of his camerawork.  This is probably the best DVD on the market in terms of extra features.  It's a mystery how they managed to fit it all on one disc, but this set includes a documentary, taped auditions, storyboards, and a hilarious send-up of several of that year's films.  Also included is an introduction to the film, and a great map of Rushmore.  The transfer is also excellent (and apparently supervised by Anderson himself), and the sound is very good.
One mild warning: some people hate this movie.  I mean HATE.  If you don't buy the Max Fischer character, you will probably be one of those people.  I think it's brilliant, I think it's one of the best movies I've ever seen, but in order to make this an even-handed review, I will simply say that several nice, interesting, intelligent people can't stand to sit through this movie.

It's basically a movie about two teenagers (Murray, Schwartzman) who fall in love with the same woman (Williams) and the chaos that results as they compete.
But there's so much more.  Schwartzman loses the other love of his life, Rushmore, and sinks into a deep funk.  At the deepest point in his depression, something happens (I don't want to give away plot) to snap him out of it and put him on the road to even greater achievement.

1332421,5,B00003Q42P,"In his films, Wes Anderson has created a world populated with his unique kind of people. And believe me it is a amazingly beautiful world. ""Rushmore"" is one of the most famous works of his, and it has became a cult flick world wide.
It is a story of a `nerd' called Max (Jason Schartzman), whose life is devoted to his well concepted school, Rushmore. Everything is his life has to do somehow with his school. Accidentally he comes across both Mr Blume and Miss Cross -- two people who will change his life forever. They introduce Max to love, friendship and some other things of the real world -- a place to which Max is not very used.
""Rushmore"" --the movie -- is melancholic, funny and deeply lyrical. It seems to me that the film is a metaphor of the Rites of Passage -- the ritual that transforms the teenager into an adult. Rushmore -- the school -- is a metaphor of the world, where in this little place, Max can experience all those things that he will face through his life, such as love, friendship, betrayal, rejection and some others that we all have to face sooner or later.
The two who change Max's life are played by Olivia Willians and Bill Murray. She is a widowed teacher for whom he falls, despite she being a bit older than him, and this platonic love affair is the first contact that Max has with the mysterious world of women. This relationship must have to do with the Oedipus Complex somehow, once Max's mother died when he was only 7. I think that Mr Blume represents what Max wants to be when is older -- i.e. wealthy and important. But these two poles will give Max their back, and this is when he seems his dreams falling into pieces.
But it is not a sad film, although it is very melancholic. The soundtrack has an important role in this story. It is perfect and every song played there does extremely fine with the character's mood and with the sequences.  Anderson's direction and script -- written along with his pal Owen Wilson -- is so good that makes easy to understand why so many people love this flick.
If you have seen ""Rushmore"", you understand what I mean. If you haven't, go and see it. Give this gift to yourself. You won't regret!!!",1012521600,,2176,4.412935323383085

Thats jsut me however, for most i think this movie would rank at about a 3 1/2 star rating. It is slightly quirky, but most anyone will enjoy it, so give it a rent first. THe picture quality is superb, very clean ,very vivid, no artifacting. But what else would you expect form a criterion. THe audio is hte same. mothersbaugh's origional scores in addition to the oldies all sound great. (btw the soundtrack is fantastic). In the extras department, teh actors screen test are mildly interesting. The commentary provides no mind blowing insight but is interesting and keeps you involved. By far the mtv shorts are the best addition to this disc, they were very cool ,i wuldn't call them hialrious, but they were righteous regardless. If you are casual enjoyer of this movie, then just buy the regular version, there is even a two pack out there with the standard rushmore and mumford..i think its mumford. But if you have more than a passing interest in this film the criterion is well worht the extra 13 bux. Plus it comes with this way cool map of the places where rushmore takes place. It's done in the same artwork as the cover of the dvd. The movie has a lot of heart, the script is very well written and wverything flows at a great and constant pace. Ther eare no slow parts of the film, but not everyone iwll like it. Definately not a laff ou loud comedy, this is a movie you probobly aren't gonna wanna watch wit ha bunch of buddies unless they are film nerds. Film Dorks, ie me, will love this movie, becasue of the vibrant backrounds and greatcinematography.

in the performances of the actors,
in the story (writers), and the production
(where Wes Anderson and his cinematographer
share credit is open for debate.) but the
one thing that I have not seen in the many
reviews I've read (granted-  I didn't go

the soundtrack.
This is easily one of the finest compilations
of music that I've ever heard in my life!

gravitate to music that in their minds is
more modern, I challenge anyone to put
together a soundtrack to life, whether it's
your own, or a ficticious character that you
dream up with great adventures, that will
ever come close to the sounds that were
given to Max by the creators of this
wonderful movie in their choice of songs!

This multi-leveled comedy is simultaneously hilarious and heartbreaking.  Anderson is a true cinephile, referencing movies like the Graduate and Apocalypse Now.  His obsession with film and film style is apparent, mixing stylistic approaches from the 70s and the French New Wave, creating the most beautiful film.  It also has just about the best use of soundtrack I have ever seen, with perfectly selected songs (and quirky score), not only in their lyrical content, but their historical significance.

1332427,4,B00003Q42P,"First of all, the movie is great.  Despite the often absurd aspects in its plot, it is a much more realistic portrayl of high school life than the dimly plotted Hollywood movies that are endemic to multiplexes these days.  Intelligently written, well photographed and exceptionally well acted by leads Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman (in his first movie role, though he is the son of actress Talia Shire and nephew of Director Francis Ford Coppola).  Every joke is delivered with just the right intonation of voice to carry a laugh and the all of the actors seem to possess a gift for nonverbal communication.  Rushmore is not one of those joke every minute parody films such as Scary Movie, (which may be why some reviewers don't understand it), instead it is content to building up humor, sometimes with entire scenes leading to one deadpan joke at the end.  Almost as if director Wes Anderson foresaw its probable rise into the realm of ""Classic"", Rushmore is refreshingly free of popculture references which date so many recent movies.  Rushmore takes place in an indeterminate time and place intentionally, making it all the easier for us to relate protagonist Max Fischer's high school career to our own time spent there.
The fact that a great movie is burned upon it is enough alone to earn this DVD 3 stars (at least by my system), but the DVD itself is another matter.  The picture and sound transfer is perfect, as it always is with the Criterion Collection's DVDs, and the movie looks better than it did in the theater.  It really showcases the techincal mastery of the crew on Rushmore to see this DVD.  Considering that it was shot almost entirely on location, with many of the scenes taking place outdoors, its a techinical feat that the movie turned out so perfectly.  However, I deduct a star for the DVD's steep price tag ... .  If the extra features had amounted to much, maybe it would justify the price tag, but the extra features are basically a dull and uninsightful commentary by star Jason Schwartzman and writers Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson, and a making of documentary shot by Wes Anderson's much less talented brother.  Other features are included, but they don't add up to much either.

It actualy does have many funny parts such as when Max and Mr. Blume seek revenge on eachother and Maxs play about war that has to be seen to beleive!
Wes Anderson does a great job of directing. He has some wicked camera angles and does many things in one shot. Not may directors do things in one shot anymore. When I first saw the movie I didn't like how the editing was so choppy. But then when you watch it again you realize how great the choppiness is... I can't explain it.
Aside from the great directing and the magnificent acting, the script is great as well. It was written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson. Theese guys know how to write good dialogue.

One reviewer wrote that they didn't think it was supposed to be a comedy. Of course it was meant to be a comedy and for many people as well as too many clueless critics it was successful. I may give this film one more chance on a stormy day when I have absolutely nothing better to do and somebody ties me up and holds a gun to my head. I have one request of Jason Schwartzmann before I end my diatribe: Please Please stop acting!!!! You have no talent so what's the point. Also, people, as far as I know, Mr. Schwartzmann hasn't been in a film since. That should say something(and no, I don't think it's that he's just very selective).

If you really liked the film in the theater, as I did, but didn't think you needed to see it again, I suggest you give this a try. I find that this film is so masterfully done that my appreciation for it grows each time I watch it. The dialog is snappier than a rubberband sandwich, so many of the shots capture all of the subtle nuances of great American social comedies of the mid-to-late '60s (particularly one scene where Max spys on his love interest by cracking open a door), it benefits from uniformly great music selections (especially the Mothersbaugh cues), and it's so detailed with tiny sight gags! After being sprung from juvenile hall, you briefly see Max walk up the stairs without shoelaces--isn't that something they do if you're on suicide watch? And what's with the few short uses of slow motion? My theory: sic transit gloria.",1001721600,3,1016,4.467741935483871

""the hardest geometry problem in the world,"" to the last bittersweet shot of him and Miss Cross moving onto the dance floor, Rushmore has a sweetly sad and humorous tone that is unique.  Is it a comedy? Drama?  Coming of age story?  Whatever you may classify it, you, too, will become a member of the Max Fischer Fan Club.  The soundtrack, I might add, is also mighty fine.",1001462400,,504,4.4945054945054945
1332438,5,B00003Q42P,"This film is absolutely amazing.  Why?  Well, let's see.  First off the director, Wes Anderson, did an amazing job at developing the characters and their respective personalities.  Then of course there is the excellent choice of the actors and actresses chosen for the film.  A mixture of well-known stars and relative new comers make it a fantastic combination of young and developed talent.  And of course, the story.  The story is an excellent portrayal of a 15 year old boy who is obsessed with his school, a first grade teacher, and writing/directing plays.  This movie has everything you need to feel drama and comedy that the actors make known, so you really get into the film.  The comedy itself is almost hidden and very dry, but it is so effective for a film of this nature.  Some might say this is a ""feel-good"" movie, but I feel that would be cleche.  I chose to say that this film is an excellent representation of young teenage rebellion, looking for a direction to travel.  Rushmore, by far, is the greatest film of the 90's.",1000425600,,1040,4.653846153846154

He's genuinely funny, as is Bill Murray, and they both have that underlying sadness (and I don't mean to imply a drug problem) that renders their dilemmas poignant. There's lots to like about 'Rushmore', quirky script, making fun of wrestling and Scotsmen, lots of wit in the editing, but one minor warning - like so many Hollywood movies, it trades on some irritating premises. Firstly, growing up is much more interesting if you attend an expensive New England private school - in fact, it becomes so interesting it might be worth filming; second, the only way to know if an adult is intelligent is to find out if they graduated from Harvard; third, women should be extremely beautiful and between the ages of 18 and 32, perhaps 34, otherwise they are not worthy of a man's love (if they do harbour a libido beyond this age, then they should be considered 'deviant' in some sense (i.e. the Connie Nielssen character); fourthly, rich older men ALWAYS have a chance with women half their age. In addition, the film has some pretensions about dealing with issues of grief and loss - um, well, I'd skip over these bits (they are tactless and embarassing) but, if it's any consolation to the film makers, Ingmar Bergman wasn't the best humorist, so perhaps things even out in the end.",998697600,,1498,4.699619771863118

Max Fisher's undying enthusiasm to succeed and quirky outlook will resonate with anyone. The fact that he gets a 41 in geometry shows how sometimes grades aren't the true story. The plays that Fisher puts on are hysterical. Apocalypse Now with live explosions. Jason Schwartzmann nails the Fisher part. Bill Murray should have won an oscar for his portrayal of Mr. Blume, a depressed tycoon who sees that old spark of life he used to have in Max. Criterion does a superb job with the DVD as always. The transfer is impeccable. The special features are awesome. There is enlightening commentary by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson. There are also two interviews conducted by Charlie Rose with Bill Murray and Wes Anderson. You also see the TV spots for the 1999 MTV Movie Awards where the Rushmore players do staged adaptations of Out of Sight, Armageddon, and The Truman Show. The Out of Sight play is hysterical.

The blending of music with images is more successful than in most music videos.  I love to put in this DVD and just watch the music sequences.  The cinematography in this movie is simply beautiful.  Every shot is framed perfectly (assuming you are watching the widescreen DVD version and not the VHS version), and the editing could not be tighter.  Every scene works, and I feel the movie would suffer from the loss of just one of them.  Then all of this is topped off with absoulutely brilliant dialog, wonderful characters, and a truly touching and involving story.

This is on of Bill Murray's funniest roles, and he does it with such grace and ease.  The music in this film fits the mood of the film better than any other film I've ever seen.

It quickly became my favorite movie of all time, and this Criterion issue is a must-have for anyone who loved the film.  RUSHMORE was the title that prompted me to buy my DVD player in the first place, and with its light comedic touch and well-drawn, unique characters, it should be a film that gets recognition for years to come.
The best features on the Criterion DVD are the MTV Movie Awards shorts (3 popular films as portrayed by the Max Fischer players) and several nice audition tapes and screen tests, most notably those for Jason Schwartzman.  RUSHMORE is a terrific piece of cinema, with subtle shadings that come across differently and more clear with each viewing.

If you want to see comedy filmaking taking a stretch try Rushmore.  The film is slow paced, a bit pretensious and unrealistic.  But its good. What's so funny?  A fifteen yr old boy and a millionaire competing for the same woman.  Murray is hilarious from the start of the film when he advises the not so wealthy students at Rushmore to ""take dead aim"" at the rich kids and ""take them down"" because the one thing money can't buy them is a backbone!  The soundtrack is excellent. The writing and the music are consistantly good throughout the film.

Considering that I bought the Criterion Edition, I feel that a review of that edition is in order.
This is why DVDs were invented.  It includes the movie, of course, but a great commentary from director Wes Anderson, coscreenwriter Owen Wilson and actor Schwartzman.  It also has a great behind the scenes documentary, by Anderson's brother.  The 1999 MTV movie awards clips, where the Max Fischer plays reproduce scenes from Truman Show, Armageddon and Out of Sight is brillaintly, and a great addition to this DVD.  There are even interviews with Murray and Wes Anderson from the Charlie Rose show!  Even after watching the movie this DVD kept me completely engrossed for hours.  It even includes a section called color bars...those lovely ""this is only a test of the emergency broadcasting system"" bars that we all grew up to love.

The cast, the direction, the dialogue, the body language, the acting, the scenery, the way the shots are set up, the soundtrack, the homage to other great FILMS throughout the movie. I watch it again and again and I am amazed each time. It's clever. It's uncomfortable. It's funny. It's heartbreaking.

I won't go too much into the plot, you can read about it in other reviews, but I would like to tell you why it is so wonderful. Director Wes Anderson knows how to frame a shot. He knows how to cut the film. And he knows how to complement it with great music. I liked his first film BOTTLE ROCKET ... I love this one. Max Fisher is a cross between Holden Caulfield and ... I don't know. He is like no other character I've ever seen or heard about. He is an elitist yet not of the elite, and an over UNDER-achiever (he has so many extra-curricular activities on his plate he can't succeed at anything). For some reason the movie reminded me of the Graduate ... it had that atmosphere about it. Bill Murray's Mr. Blume is hysterical (without blatantly being so). Their friendship is both sadistic and touching. They are one and the same and that may be why they the have this love/hate relationship with each other as well as with themselves.
If you didn't like this film or haven't seen it, take a look (again if you hated it). I am a firm believer in the seeing-it-more-than-once principal. A lot of people think that is stupid ... I believe if it's a good film then it is not stupid. I liked it the first time. By my third viewing of RUSHMORE I was enamored. It is odd, funny, touching and simply brilliant.

This film is so rewarding due to the fact that it does not try to be anything that it is not. All it tries to do is tell the story of a 15 year old who is in a rivalry with a 40 something year old over the affections of a teacher. ""Big Bad"" Bill Murray plays the part of Herman Blume, the rich man that is trying to steal the teacher away from Max Fisher. The film goes deeper than any other film would try to do, primarily because this film is not like any others.

1332458,3,B00003Q42P,"*Rushmore*  is the story about a misfit who starts out at a tony private school called Rushmore, where he's a key member in every ridiculous club that the school has, but ends up, due to academic absent-mindedness, at a very typical public high school.  The point is, of course, how can such an oddball fit in?  should he bother?  Wes Anderson, the director, answers with a resounding  ""NO!""
Max Fischer  (brilliantly played by Jason Schwartzman)  is merely the LEAD oddball in this movie.  There are many others, not the least being a scabrous Bill Murray in a supporting role as Herman, a Rushmore alumnus.  Both Max and Herman make the mistake of falling for Olivia Williams, who is pretty much right in the middle of them, age-wise.  Astonishingly, Anderson doesn't make these separate crushes seem ridiculous.  Max's lovelorn state, indeed, might bring back to some viewers some of the inadvised crushes they went through in their own youth.
There's a lot of goofiness in this movie, arguably too much goofiness.  Max's student play, a Vietnam phantasy, replete with ear-plugs that come with the program  (due to actual shooting of blanks on stage), might be just a bit overdetermined -- does he really have to be THAT crazy?  Well, no and yes:  creating memorable characters such as these carries the risk of overdoing it.  *Rushmore*  is the kind of movie where the director presents many items for your perusal; you can laugh at whatever you wish.

1332460,5,B00003Q42P,"The Criterion Edition of Rushmore is a jewel.  This movie is so untouched with the Hollywood Brass Committee storytelling that it seems like a miracle that the film was even made.  The film focuses on a strange teenage boy named Max Fischer who attends a posh private school called Rushmore Academy and his misadventures there.  The film is a coming of age odyssey, a romantic comedy, and a quirky drama all at once.  The film has been compared to coming of age classics like ""The Graduate"" and ""Harold and Maude"".  It is a fair comparason for ""Rushmore"" will be remembered for years to come.
There is such honesty in the storytelling and the performances in Rushmore, that I don't even fell like I'm watching a movie but a documentary.  Much of that is due to Bill Murray's perfomance as Max Fischer's older millionare friend.  Murray has usually been the focus of his films giving appropriately off beat and showy performances, but in ""Rushmore"" he's much more restrained.  Murray gives a true performance showing that not only can he be a great star but a great character actor as well.  There are many quirky and off beat characters in ""Rushmore"", some are even very touching.
The Criterion Edition of ""Rushmore"" has an insightful commentary by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson.  While listening you get the impression that both Wilson and Anderson have great affection for their effort here.  There are other goodies on the disk, some that I don't want to spoil.

The script is phenomenonal; Anderson and Wilson write incredibly funny lines without really writing punch lines. The acting is exceptional-- I can't imagine Max Fischer played by anyone but Jason Schwartzman, and Bill Murray delivers perhaps the most heartfelt performance of his career. And the music is beautiful-- the music supervisor deserves all the accolades he got for putting the soundtrack together.
I expect I'm probably preaching to the converted, though, so let me add that the Criterion DVD is excellent. Including the Max Fischer Players' performances of The Truman Show, Out of Sight, and Armageddon is a great bonus. The commentary from Anderson, Wilson, and Schwartzman is another bonus, and, obviously, the music sounds much better on DVD than video.

Ever since its lackluster blockbuster performance, to it's VHS and DVD releases; this picture was and is ill appreciated.  It tells a tale of Max Fisher, a young boy inclined to spend more time starting clubs than doing schoolwork at Rushmore Academy.  Bill Murray gives a masterful performance playing Mr. Bloom, one of the best in his career I may add.  He plays a father of two of the boys who attend Rushmore Academy with Max (Jason Schwartzman's) character; who doesn't respect the ""Head Start"" the offspring's of rich families are given in life or anything else for that matter, and voices that actively.  Without giving away the movie's plot line, I will end with the fact that the movie will blow fans of ""Bottle Rocket"" and such fans of melodramatic comedies right out of their seats.  If I could rate the movie alone, it would get 5 stars...but this is a DVD review isn't it?
The DVD features and extras itself are ALMOST as wonderful as the movie.  It features a few cast members' Auditions (Including Jason Schwartzman and the boy whom plays Dirk), interviews with Bill Murray, Storyboard comparison with the movie simultaneously, the making of Rushmore, and the shorts the ""Max Fisher Players"" preformed for the 1999 MTV Music awards among other things. All of this pieced together with a clever interactive front-end menu make this DVD a great pick-up.

Often, the commentators bounce off each other and share reminiscences (as in, say, the CHARADE or FIGHT CLUB commentaries), and it would have been nice to have that here as well.
But that's a minor quibble.  Otherwise, this is a great movie, and a superb DVD.",969840000,,705,4.9576271186440675
1332469,5,B00003Q42P,"The Criterion edition of ""Rushmore"" is a phenomenal package that  fans of the movie should not be without. But first, the movie itself is a  real treat. Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), 10th grade student of Rushmore  academy, is involved in playwriting and numerous extra-cirricular  activities. The only problem is he faces expulsion due to his lack luster  grades. Towards the beginning of the film he comes to admire Mr. Blume, a  self made millionaire in a bad marriage played wonderfully by Bill Murray.  The two of them become good friends, each displaying a mutual respect for  one another, until they both fall for the same woman, a widowed first grade  teacher played by Olivia Williams. If anything, this movie shows the  hardships of growing up as a teenager and coming to terms with feelings so  overwhelming (in this case unrequited love) that you can't deal with them.  Funny, poignant, and intelligent, it's an excellent coming of age story  highlighted by the incredible performances of all the players. The  Criterion DVD is packed with a trailer, a Charlie Rose show segment with  both Bill Murray and director/co-writer Wes Anderson, an audio commentary  with Wes Anderson, co-writer Owen Wilson, and Jason Schwartzman,  ""Making of..."" documentary, audition footage, and more. Excellent  movie, excellent special features. Need I say more?",968889600,29,1359,5.212962962962963
1332470,5,B00003Q42P,"""Rushmore"" is made by a filmmaker who knows and utilizes all the things that are right with movie-making.  Aside from the terrific story,  acting, and production, there's marvelous detail and certain nuances that  we can see from the DVD's special features, are the result of a different  style of filmmaking - a ""school-play"" atmosphere much like the  tone Max Fischer sets with his own productions.  This DVD treats the movie  with the respect it deserves, and emphasizes the film's accomplishment  without creating a ""smugness"" about it.  If you liked this movie,  you'll really enjoy this DVD edition.",967680000,,605,5.144329896907217
1332471,5,B00003Q42P,"First off, RUSHMORE the movie is probably my favorite film of 1998.  It's just one of the most truly honest films of the 90s.  It's a simple tale,  excellently told.  Boy falls in love with teacher who falls in love with  friend of boy...one of the oldest stories in the book, right?  But Wes  Anderson and Owen Wilson have created something more.  And in Max Fischer,  they have created a character that will be held along the lines of classic  characters like Benjamin Braddock (THE GRADUATE), or even Wes Anderson and  Owen Wilson's Dignan (played by Owen Wilson in BOTTLE ROCKET).
What  really needs to be said, though, is that the Criterion DVD of this film  simply is one of the best DVDs ever made.  It's got a terrific commentary,  documentaries, interviews, even the MTV Movie Awards reenactments by the  Max Fischer Players.  Other than FIGHT CLUB and Criterion's BRAZIL, I can't  think of a single DVD that holds a candle to it.  It's well worth the extra  price.
RUSHMORE is destined to be a classic..one of those movies that  still will be appreciated 20 years later.  And Criterion DVDs are notorious  for going out of print...so, RUSHMORE is destined to be a collector's item.  Now if only Criterion would give the same treatment to BOTTLE ROCKET....",967420800,5,1265,4.723502304147465
1332472,5,B00003Q42P,"I initially purchased the VHS version of this movie. I watched it and simply fell in love with the characters, the dialogue, the art direction, the acting, the cinematography and the music in RUSHMORE. This is a truly a small gem of a movie.
I have now gone out and purchased the Criterion Collection DVD, and it is by far my favorite movie within my collection (and I have a lot of truly great movies). But this one just stands out perhaps because of its sheer simplicity, quirkiness, subtleness, and panache: besides just having a nearly perfect anamorphic transfer, amazing 5.1 surround soundtrack, and too many extras to mention.
If you do buy this movie, buy the Criterion DVD release. You will kick yourself later if you don't...
Having said all of the above, I will also say that this movie isn't for everybody. If you don't like movies that are a bit out of the norm you may not like this one. For the rest of you, go out and see this one and I am sure you will truly enjoy it!",967161600,,985,4.387978142076503
1332473,5,B00003Q42P,"Rushmore became a cult classic the day it was released, and the Criterion Collection release is an absolute dream come true for fans of this film.  Since enough praise has already been posted about the film, I'll focus on  the extra DVD features. The best  of course is the commentary by Anderson,  Wilson, and Schwartzman. Not the best I've ever heard (that award goes to  Paul Thomas Anderson on Boogie Nights), but Wilson adds wonderful comments  about how so many of the best lines in the film come from his childhood.  That aside, there are wonderful cast interviews, audition tapes (!), still  photos, storyboard comparisons to the film, and storyboard layouts for a  few key scenes. Basically everything you could want and more. The most  charming is the Max Fischer Players performances from the 1999 MTV Movie  Awards. Wonderful!  Also included is a small map by Eric Chase Anderson of  the highlights of the movie. The only complaint I have is that the trailer  seems a bit grainy and muffled. The standand release on dvd seems to have a  better quality trailer. Otherwise, this is proof of how wonderful a dvd can  be, and what makes the future of dvd bright. A great movie packaged with  care. This is a must for any serious collection.",966988800,7,1248,4.730232558139535

Bill Murray is at his best in this role, and I  think all of his other movies were leading up to this.

We are exposed to BH 90210, She's all that, etc., where everyone is rich and hip and beautiful...  even the  oucastes are beautiful and wear rich clothes.  But this shows us another  side.  This shows us kids interacting like I saw a lot of kids interacting  in high school.  Don't get me wrong, no high school in the country would  allow Max Fisher's Vietnam play to go on stage, but the play was pure  brilliance.  The screenplay is incredible, and only gets better with the  addition of powerhouse comedian Bill Murray.  The stars of this film work  with precision timing.  It has so many classic moments that it is hard to  keep track of them, the pure vicious nature of the two lead characters as  they pursue Ms. Cross, who is at once sweet, beautiful, and real...  turning to Max to say that 'sex' is not a degrading word if you've ever  ...... before...

The Criterion DVD only adds to what is a  fantastic film, and with films like this and American Beauty coming out of  the studio system, we can only pray that others take heed, otherwise Wes  Anderson might as well direct everything that churns out of a machine  determined to rake in pennies and not praise.",963792000,,776,4.572463768115942

Bad for people who do not like unpredictable movies with some real sentiment behind it, as well something more heady than an average action  movie.  Those of you who like it say it is subtle humor to this movie, with  very little laughing out loud.  I don't understand this, as I often laughed  out loud through this movie.  Especially the Bill Murray moments, and very  loudly and raucously during the plays that Max put on.  Maybe it is my  sense of humor, though.  I saw this as a sneak preview because I got a  free ticket where I work.  I edge toward being a fan of Bill Murray, and  that he was in it was the only thing I knew going into the movie.  I loved  it, though I did feel it was something of a ""weird"" movie.  If  you are not a fan of ""weird"" movies, do not watch this, but if  you enjoy movies such as ""Being John Malkovich"" (which has little  in common with this movie) or similar movies, this is a must see.",959299200,5,1005,4.108808290155441
1332483,5,B00003Q42P,"I saw ""Rushmore"" when it was in theaters, and bought the DVD as soon as it was released. The Criterion version was recently released so I bought it and gave my other DVD to a friend. I love the Criterion films.  Although I am not in the movie making business, I am interested in the  composition of a good film, and have become a fan of Criterion.  I own a  number of laser disk and DVD Criterion films.
Rushmore is a wonderful  film. The leading young man is Jason Schwartzman (Talia Shire of Rocky fame  is his mother, Francis Ford Coppola is his grandfather, and Nicholas Cage  is his cousin). Bill Murray is almost always in weird comedies and this is  a weird comedy. Bill has never been so droll, however. Olivia Williams  played Jane Fairfax in ""Emma"" and was Bruce Willis' wife in  ""The Sixth Sense."" I am mentioning all these connections because  the film is sometimes thought of as an ""Indy"" and although it may  be (I think if might have won something at Sundance), very talented people  were involved in the production--at least of Jason.
The setting is  Rushmore, a private school where young Max Fischer is a failing and  troubled student. Ms. Williams is a beautiful young teacher who trys to  counsel Max, and with whom he is smitten.  In spite of her efforts, Max is  eventually expelled from Rushmore.  He continues to pursue Ms. Williams  romantically, however she tries to discourage him.  Eventually, he  crosses  paths with Bill Murray, an excentric millionaire who also is smitten with  and courting Ms. Williams.  Both ""men"" cannot have the lady, so a  conflict brews that eventually erupts into a war. I found the retaliation  involving Max's bicycle and Murray's car hilarious. All's well that ends  well, however, and the reconciliation at the end is sweet.
You'll enjoy  the film twice as much if you get the Criterion version. Also, I believe  this film was produced by the team that brought you ""Bottle  Rocket"" another zany film involving a crazy young man on a  two-wheeler.",958867200,,2006,4.708092485549133
1332484,5,B00003Q42P,"Rushmore is one of those movies that I had been meaning to see for awhile.  I had read great things about it when it was in the theater and never got around to seeing it.  Then I planned on renting it on DVD and checking it  out.  Finally, a couple nights ago, I did.  And I found that this is one of  the best, consistent movies I had seen in a long time.
Jason Schwartzman  absolutely nails the part of Max Fisher.  Bill Murray is funny and breathes  life into his dying--yet living--character.  Olivia Williams gives Ms.  Cross the perfect pitch.  The rest of the cast is damn near perfect.  This  is truly the perfect cast for the movie.
And as for the actual movie, it  is quite funny.  It carries a very sardonic, deadpan tone that works  perfectly with these characters.  Every moment seems true for this world  and never does the writing fall weak or ring falsely.  This is one of the  most solid, consistent movies I have seen in a long time.
This is also a  beautifully shot movie.  It benefits from great framing and some very  effective use of the 2.35:1 ratio.  This is a movie that truly must be seen  in its widescreen format (though, of course, I believe ALL movies should be  seen in their original ratio.)
Bottom line, this is a hugely entertaining  film that will undoubtedly be seen as a classic.  As soon as I can afford  it, I'm going to pick up the Criterion DVD.  I recommend you do the same,  because this is a movie you will be wanting to appreciate again and again.",956966400,,1492,4.3321167883211675

As much as I would like to talk about it, you must see it to experience its wonder.  But to help you make the decision to buy, I offer a few words.
This is a coming-of-age story  about Max Fisher played by a very talented teen actor; it also stars a  lovely actress playing Max's first crush/teacher/supervisor in a work-study  program at his prep school.  You will see Bill Murray at his BEST here as  Max's buddy, confidant, and chief competitor.  Along the way watch  beekeeping, fencing, backstabbing, a high school play about Vietnam, and  along this track comes the most compassionate portrayal of an intelligent  high school male in film I have seen.
All the while you will laugh until  you cry.
It is not a ""girl movie"" or a ""guy movie.""  It is simply a very good movie which has made its way into my Top Ten of  all time.  Pretty stellar company.",956880000,,895,4.378048780487805

This is simply a movie that you either love or hate. Also, I'm a teenager and the stuff that  we're fed (movie-wise) is, for the most part, junk. I resent that Tommy  Hilfiger ads disguised as teen-slasher flicks are directed towards my  generation by the truckload.

The Charlie Rose  show with an interview by Murray, and director Wes Anderson (done separatly  is also great). The making of documentary is done exceptionally well and  the spoofs of armageddon, the truman show, and out of sight from the mtv  movie awards are hilarious.

1332489,5,B00003Q42P,"Rushmore is one of the best movies in years.  It goes well beyond being merely ""quirky"" or ""offbeat"" and manages to be wholly original and even groundbreaking.  Wes Anderson established himself as one  of the best new directors with Rushmore, fufilling the promise of his  underrated Bottle Rocket.  I think it is definitely accurate to place him  on par with P.T. Anderson and Quentin Tarantino.  Rushmore requires many  viewings to be fully appreciated (I have seen it at least 10 times and  still find new things to admire).  Its influences are both literary (J.D.  Salinger and F. Scott Fitzgerald)and cinematic (French New Wave, Stanley  Kubrick, and Michael Mann), blended into something unique and memorable.  The dialogue is the greatest, nearly every single line is hilarious. It is  unfortunate that so many people don't get this movie, it is a true classic  that I am thankful to have seen.  The extras on the Criterion Collection  DVD are very insightful and entertaining and are well worth the money.",952387200,3,1013,5.006024096385542
1332490,4,B00003Q42P,"The majority of RUSHMORE's detractors unanimously complained about the film's lack of a properly structured 'narrative' and the distinct absence of sufficient characterisation.  After watching this special Criterion  edition, I've arrived at the conclusion that director Wes Anderson  relegated the narrative aspect and placed emphasis on SUBTLE character  development.  The actual story itself is extremely simplistic and basically  revolves around the overly-ambitious exploits of a delusional teenager, Max  Fischer, and the dramatic influence he exerts on the lives of those he  associates with, particularly the teacher Miss Cross and self-loathing  capitalist Herbert Bloom.  Their affiliation and mutual revere for Rushmore  academy was the determining factor that established their relationships.  Max is hopelessly infactuated with Miss Cross and becomes increasingly  frustrated by the lack of reciprocation on her behalf.  Mr Bloom is the  epitome of self-made prosperity yet his life is emotionally vapid.  He is  completely detached from his surroundings and abhors the complacency  exhibited by his children.  Max represents to Bloom everything that he  wished his kids would be: ambitious, bold,  enthusiastic and intelligent.  However, the special relationships that Max has developed with these  individuals are threatened when Bloom and Cross start dating.  As a direct  result, Max is consumed by jealousy and the relationships begin to  disintergrate.  I'd love to continue but unfortunetly I wouldn't be able to  without revealing any key plot developments.  However, it must be  acknowledged that the performances by the three main actors are completely  brilliant.  Bill Murray's hilariously deadpan potrayal of a lonely man is  easily one of his best.  Jason Schwartzman, in his acting debut, is utterly  convincing as the geeky overachiever Max Fisher.  Olivia Williams provides  the viewer with an emotional potrayal of a complex woman unable to release  herself from the past.  Let's not forget the director!  Wes Anderson  manages to strike a near-perfect balance of idiosyncratic comedy, poignant  drama and theatrical gestures.  The colour schemes utilized throughout the  duration of the film are particularly noteworthy.  They consist mainly of  bold primary colours and have an almost Baroque quality that perfectly  compliments the eccentric tone of the film.  In light of the above, I'm  perplexed as to why many have dismissed RUSHMORE as a 'lame attempt at  comedy'.  The combination of dramatic pauses, pre-planned shot compositions  and humour is enough to convince me that Wes Anderson had MUCH HIGHER  aspirations.  Highly recommended.",951609600,,2676,5.708439897698209
