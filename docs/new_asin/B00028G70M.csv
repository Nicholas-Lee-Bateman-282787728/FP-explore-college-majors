2067426,4,B00028G70M,"This is Disc #1 also included in their two-disc set. Here is my review from that set.....

First I'll say that I have the ""Lunchbox"" version of this Echo Bridge release, but the discs are the same.
I was impressed when I first played the discs. The transfer quality is crisp & clear, from 35mm masters. I suspect the classic LASERDISC set from Republic Home Video may have been the source material.

On the down side, only 6 of the cartoons are from the ""Pre-code"" era. The other 36 cartoons are from the toned-down Hayes Office era. Fans watching these for the first time will wonder what was so risque about Betty, seen wearing a stylish house-dress in the majority of these. Some of these later cartoons are still enjoyable & creative. Betty's friend Grampy is always clever with his inventions & musically happy about them. They are the highlight of Hayes Office era.

Then there are the ""Pudgy"" Betty Boop cartoons. Pudgy was Betty's equivilant to Pluto. With a lesson to learn, thay are sappy cute & rarely funny. There are just too many of these produced by the Fleischers, and most are here.

The cartoons are not in chronological order, so you will have to play both discs to see all 6 classic pre-code cartoons.

Until CBS/Paramount home video releases a true complete Betty Boop set from Republic's 35mm masters, this may be the best quality DVD you will get of Betty Boop.

Keep those Lasterdisc (or lesser quality VHS tape) sets released by Republic Home Video.

General rule: GRAMPY = fun, PUDGY = hit the 'next' button on your remote. Hayes office starts in 1934.

2067427,4,B00028G70M,For the money a really good buy - the cartoons are in very good shape and the sound was fine. Excellent service and delivery time as well.,1244592000,,138,4.148148148148148
2067428,4,B00028G70M,"Like anyone else who is perusing this product, I am most anxious for someone to lovingly place the Betty Boop collection out on DVD.  It is gratifying to find a disc that contains most of the notable collaborations between Fleischer and contemporary pop stars, including Cab Calloway and Louis Armstrong. These are fine cartoons, just not the best.  Anyone who was fortunate enough to come upon the vhs box from more than a decade ago is aware of some of the truly wild and mind melting efforts representing the earliest efforts featuring Betty.  But until ""Bimbo's Initiation"" and ""Jippo"", etc. find their way into re-distribution, this collection will do.",1172880000,3,657,5.009174311926605
2067429,5,B00028G70M,"while i never cared that much for betty,my wife likes her and this disc of betty boop(most if not all were made be for the motion picture code was put into place in the 30's) is one she really likes to watch,and so we will cuddle up and enjoy these old but kind of racy cartoons from the past,and as such i don't think these are really ready for your kids yet! this is also something that real movie fans may want to add to their collections also!!",1151280000,,448,4.1022727272727275
2067430,5,B00028G70M,"It'a hard to complain much about this DVD, especially at the price of $4.98.

I wouldnt pay more than $12 for this, but it is a good succinct collection

of many musical BBs, and a little bit of racy, anti-establishment, and sexist

material, but done with such aplomb that only a freak would mind it.

The animation is truly amazing. I knew Snow White was good, but the others

are just as incredible. My only complaint would be that the first cartoon is

a compilation episode about Betty's rise, something that should be at the end

of the disc. When it comes on first, its a foggy print with mixed animation and

live action AND its a 'clip' episode. It totally gives the wrong impression of the

whole DVD, which immediately kicks in to crisp, beautifully contrasted and

sharp B&W on the second cartoon, ""I'll be glad when you're dead..""

The appearances by Cab Calloway AND Louis Armstrong are impossible to beat

if you have any taste for jazz at all. Recent music videos employt animation,

but its rare to have such a great soundtrack of real historic talent in a cartoon.

When the cartoon isn't sheerly artistic, its very loose and just chill. Its not

grating like so many cartoons can become for adults. The supporting characters

are amazing, and the Tin Soldiers episode in which Betty is a toy is astounding.

The looking glass episode as well is absolutely surreal. You just cant believe the

labor that they put into the detailing of these cartoons and the kind of smoothly

warping motion effects that would probably take digital animators longer with

worse results. This disc will educate and entertain you for 85 minutes.

This is only a sloice, but its of the best ones. Five stars at this price.",1134432000,12,1720,4.647840531561462
2067431,5,B00028G70M,"Amazingly, this disc has some of the musical Betties made before the Hays Office made them put a dress on her.  This is the only in-print collection with any of this material...it's made from old TV prints but the quality is pretty good. Well worth the price.",1107216000,11,259,4.51063829787234
2067432,5,B00028G70M,"A collection of nicely preserved cartoons, most from the early '30s.  Music by Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway and the Royal Samoans!

8023668,1,B00028G70M,"I thought something was up when the play list on the disk didn't match what I had read in some of the reviews. Previous reviews of this disk mentioned ""Snow White"" and ""Cab Calloway"". Some referred to pre-censorship material (the crack down happened in 1934). Then I looked at the disk itself. There is a copyright date of 2007, well after some of these reviews were written. Bottom line: the disk contains NONE of the pre-Hayes censorship titles. No Cab, no Louis Armstrong, no Snow White, no Old Man of the Mountain. So if those are the titles you're after, this isn't the disk for you.",1352937600,12,588,4.556603773584905
