8460567,5,B0057FGD0E,"I chose this movie because it starrerd Alex Kingston. She was a doctor in many years of the TV hit series, ER.  I wanted to see what else she had done.  Alex is from England, and has that delightful English accent.  I surely did love seeing her again, after watching the ER series.  I would recommend it to anyone who loved to see  her in the  ER  DVD movies.",1392163200,6,359,4.115942028985507
