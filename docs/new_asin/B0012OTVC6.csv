8247107,1,B0012OTVC6,"MAYHEM MOTEL is NOT a horror movie. It's a low-budget series of disjointed events occuring in various motel rooms. Each scenario is more perverse (not that that's necessarily a bad thing), ridiculous, and non-sensical than the last. I think some of it was meant to be humorous (all of it?), but it comes off as just plain idiotic. I kept waiting for it to gel or make some sort of sense. Any comparisons to a David Lynch film are ludicrous! Lynch can be bizarre, even outrageously ambiguous, but he's never boring or imbecilic! Yeccch! Luckily, this bomb is also available on DECREPIT CRYPT OF NIGHTMARES...",1258848000,,607,4.79047619047619

  SO MANY PLOT HOLES SO LITTLE TIME! THE MOVIE NEVER DEVELOPS A REAL PLOT. IT IS JUST UNEXPLAINED EVENTS THAT I AM GUESSING TAKES PLACE IN THE MOTEL? WAY TOO MANY CHARACTERS. NO TIME FOR ANY CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. YOU SEE SOME GUYS WAITING IN A HOTEL FOR THEIR FRIEND BILL (IM ASSUMING ITS A BACHELORS PARTY) THERE IS BILLS FIANCE WHICH WAS NEVER DEVELOPED, SHE TELLS HER MOTHER SHE CANT MARRY HIM, AFTER SHE KILLS HIM? BUT WHY DID SHE (KILL BILL) LOL. YOU SEE A GUY GO AND TAKE A BATH WITH EASTER EGGS, THEN PROCEEDS TO VOMIT IN HIS OWN BATHEING WATER, AND TAKES A BATH (WTF). THEN YOU SEE A CAR SALESMAN IN ONE ROOM WITH A BLOW UP DOLL THAT POPS, EVEN I GOT A CHUCKLE OUT OF THAT.
  THEN YOU GET SOME WEIRD LOOKING PIMP? THAT SOUNDS LIKE A FKN DOLPHIN WHEN HE SPEAKS INTO A SPEAKER PHONE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ON THE PHONE. I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS THE ONLY MOVIE I HAD EVER SEEN MIMES HAVING SEX IN(LOL) THEN ONE OF THE MIMES MAKES A NOISE AND IT PISSES THE GIRL MIME OFF AND THEN ALL SEXUALLY ACTIVITY IS AT A HAULT. WHAT WAS THE PAINTER DOING WITH HIS EYELIDS, AND HE LET THE HOOKER KILL HIM? WTF. I ALSO GOT A CHUCKLE OUT OF THE ORIENTAL LADY WIPING BOOGERS ON THE WEIRD LOOKING PIMPS FEET.
  THERE AT THE END COMES A MIDGETT, WHICH IM NOT SHALLOW BUT GEEZ THEY MAKE ME LAUGH. THE MIDGETT CONFRONTS THE PIMP AND DROWNS HIM, COMING OFF SAYING THAT ABBY (THE HOOKER) IS MY GIRL NOW (LMAO) THERES NO WAY IN HELL I WOULD LET A MIDGETT DROWN ME. THE ONLY THING I CAN SAY THAT SAVED THIS MOVIE FOR ME WAS ABBY THE HOOKER. SHE WAS GORGEOUS. I WOULD TAKE A STAB THAT ANYDAY.
  IF THIS REVEIEW HAS CONFUSED YOU, WELL IT SHOULD BECAUSE THE MOVIE DOES A DAMN WELL GOOD JOB AT IT. IVE SEEN A COUPLE OF THE BRAIN DAMAGE FILMS AND AT LEAST THEY LIVE UP TO THEIR NAME. I THANK YOU BRAIN DAMAGE FOR MAKING ME A MENTALLY HANDICAPP PERSON.
  I PAID A COUPLE OF BUCKS FOR THIS MOVIE, SO IM NOT TOO DISSAPOINTED BUT, I WOULD AVSISE PEOPLE NOT TO BUY AND RENT IF YOU DARE. I HAVE TO GO TO WAL-MART NOW TO GET ME A HELMET FOR MY (BRAIN DAMAGED HEAD NOW).",1234137600,,2292,4.062084257206209
