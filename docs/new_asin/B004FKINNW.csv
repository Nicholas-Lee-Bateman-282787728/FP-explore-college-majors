8427864,3,B004FKINNW,"No, this is not another ""Step Up"" film. ""StreetDance"" is a UK movie about a group of street dancers who have to work together with ballet dancers to win the upcoming Street Dance Championship. The contrived story offers nothing new, but the amazing street dance scenes are enjoyable. The thumping soundtrack music is also nice.

Nichola Burley plays Carly, whose new task is to lead a new dance crew after Jay (Ukweli Roach), her boyfriend, suddenly left the group. Carly first has to secure the place where the dance crew can practice. Luckily, a ballet coach Helena (Charlotte Rampling), who thinks her students need something stimulating, offers a deal: Carly can use the school's room ... if she agrees to incorporate some of the ballet dancers into her team.

Of course the story is implausible. But there is one good thing about it and that is most characters are likable. No one gets involved in crimes. No brawls, no street fights. No one is drunk. All they want to do is dance.

What makes ""StreetDance"" special is beautifully-choreographed energetic dancing scenes that are fun to watch. The film also features the ""Britain's Got Talent"" winners Diversity (beating Susan Boyle at the final) and George Sampson, as well as the finalist Flawless. Their dance scenes alone are worth your time.",1327795200,2,1300,4.926940639269406
