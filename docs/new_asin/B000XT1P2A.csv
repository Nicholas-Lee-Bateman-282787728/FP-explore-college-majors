8229652,5,B000XT1P2A,These are some of Hugh Grant's funniest movies. Both had great scripts and loads of sarcasm. Both also fit Hugh Grant's personality really well. Definitely check them both out if you haven't seem that already.,1269820800,,209,5.0
8229653,3,B000XT1P2A,"I love Hugh Grant, which was the inspiration behind it, but it wasn't the best movie i've seen.  About a boy is a pretty good movie not four stars but good, American Dreamz was just sad!",1252713600,,186,4.166666666666667
