Most of the highlights are taken from ground level, and in most cases they don't use the shots from those who televised games.  The Pitt game and Sugar Bowl are a little better than some of the others.  If you really want a keepsake of the season, this is pretty good--esp. if you like to see some behind the scenes stuff.  But if not, pass on it.",1157500800,4,495,4.336956521739131
