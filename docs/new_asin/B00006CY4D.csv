This is where things come down to the wire, where skills are more important than luck, and love finally wins out in the end.  The ending, by the way, may not be what you think but the final few episodes still made me cry.  And I really don't like sports.
As always, the voice actors and actresses are wonderful, I love them all, and the Japanese development of the characters really helped make the story realistic and a delight to watch.  Leaning more about Yuki and watching the girls work together while at the same time developing themselves as living individuals was great.
I still wish there was more extras then just previews and cover art, but we can't have it all?",1322784000,,739,4.533834586466165
7967393,5,B00006CY4D,"This anime has really been slept on, but it is one of the best. In Grand Slam, everything comes to an end. However, some questions are left unanswered. Regardless, the conclusion of the series is not to be missed! If you were like me and only had the first 5 discs, buy this; you won't be sorry.",1300752000,,295,4.192982456140351
7967394,1,B00006CY4D,"I wish someone had warned me ahead of time about the ending of Princess 9 because then I would not have bothered to watch the series period. I'm sorry but this was one of the worst endings to a sports anime that I have ever seen. I think the best thing to do is stop at volume 5 and just make up your own ending because I'm sure it would be better than the piece of crap presented in this volume.

I fully understand that in real life sometimes your favorite team does not always win in the end despite how hard they've worked.  It's a sad fact but okay fine, no problem . . . And I could have respected the ending to this anime had the reason for the girls losing been a simple matter that the boy's team just played a better game.  But that wasn't the reason.

Despite the fact that the series was overall moving in a positive direction by making the female characters a little more tougher than the pieces of fluff in other shows, the end of this series had the main character dissolve into a typical clich roll for females in anime - an emotional wreck who just can't get it together.  And this is what ultimately lost them the game.

Ryo single handedly lost the game for the entire team because she was too upset over Hiroku possibly having feelings for Izumi to focus on actually winning the game.

So despite the fact of how hard everyone worked to get to the finals, we basically have Ryo blowing EVERYTHING over a boy.  And that pitiful attempt at the end of the game to pick up the pieces was just futile.

My Gosh! If the creators wanted our lovable heroines to go down at the end, at least let it be for a good reason and in a battle to be remembered.  This whole set up was just pathetic.

The final episode basically made the rest of the series a waste of time.",1217462400,,1850,4.252148997134671
7967395,5,B00006CY4D,I'm so happy I was able to see this anime! The story is one of the best I've seen in a long time. And you really feel the emotions of each characther. Through good times and bad times. Wonderful voice acting by the dub team. Glad to call myself a fan! =),1174780800,,254,3.9038461538461537
7967396,5,B00006CY4D,"The Princess Nine series is a great one for girls, but boys may also enjoy it. Its nice that each member of the team has their own personality and look. Ryo Hayakawa is the starting pitcher and gets accepted to the prestigious Kisaragi girls school and has to deal with a rival named Izumi who is the chairwoman's daughter and has to deal with Izumi's childhood friend Hiroki Tagusaki who falls in love with her from the moment he meets her. Its a wonderful journey from the beginning to the end. The ending is not at all predictable and the series is a real treat to see. A wonderful addtition for any fans of anime.",1045008000,2,617,4.373913043478261
7967397,5,B00006CY4D,"I agree with the first reviewer. This series still has a lot of hooks without fish, and I say we go fishing. You'll hear more music, upcatching and rather deep music. They did a great job with the music and development to the characters, as well as a very original story. This places 2nd in my collection, right next to Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040, and I plan for it to keep its spot. This series deserves more, comic, more seasons, regular tv show, or something. It's a little over rated, maybe it should be for nine and up. However, they only have so many choices (All, 12+ 13+, 15+, 16+, 17+, and 18+.) I hope later on people decide to do a second season at least. As I said kinda, the characters are well developed, but still need small holes to be filled. Like what about Hikaru's family? What happened to Koharu's mom? Will Seira smack one on Coach Kido? (It's obvious she likes him). So this very much relates to the Australian review, well done. This DVD only was the best out of the seires. It's like one of those series that it's better as it goes.  Over all, the whole series was fantastic. Wonderful voice overs! Speaking of which, since Kelli Cousins (Seira) is Kurumi in Steel Angel Kurumi (cutesy character) it takes a while getting used to, but I'll talk about that in a review for Steel Angel.
