8280434,4,B001AZ5IRO,"If you are looking for an animated aquarium to use as a screensaver on your TV this might amuse you. It is not real fish but the cartoon fish move realistically and there is an adorable seahorse that floats around. There is a crab and every color of fish you can imagine.

This DVD provides three scenes that are each about three minutes long. You can watch all of them and it will loop them or you can choose just one scene and it will loop that. The light that dances on the coral is really pretty.

Now as far as the music goes there is an option to turn it off and you can watch this with no music or sounds at all. That is really the best option if you have your own ambient music. Because all that plays is a track of organ like music that repeats over and over again.

So you can choose:

Music only
Sound effects only (much louder so you'll have to turn the volume down)
Music and Sound effects
None

So when you play all the scenes one after the other they stop and start every 3 minutes. So you just see a blank screen in between. This is not distracting if you are just playing this in the background as a screensaver. I don't think it was really intended for you to just sit and watch the animation. So it has its purposes.

What I liked most about this was how colorful it was and how it brightened up the living room. My cats however were not fooled and knew these were not real sea creatures. :)

8280438,1,B001AZ5IRO,"Whoever compiled this DVD completely missed the mark with regard to what constitutes an interesting or realistic aquarium scape.  In my travels I have seen some really impressive digital aquariums, but never managed to discover who they were produced by.  This offering is NOT one of those, it is bad and simply put, you could go to your local pet store and 'Roll Camera' on a couple of large aquariums and you'd have considerably more success!",1383868800,,444,4.828947368421052
