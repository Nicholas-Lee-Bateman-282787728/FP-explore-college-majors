2247591,4,B0007WFXH6,"This movie unsettles and pleases.  The first and last shorts, *Christmas Story* and *A Little Drama*, are wonderful acts-without-words that explore longing not yet to be fulfilled.  The inner stories are of varying merit--*Sunday* is trite, though short--but they add up to a very satisfying collection of shorts.  Was he molested?  Or wasn't he?",1129420800,12,346,5.351851851851852
2247592,1,B0007WFXH6,"Dont buy this DVD unless you are a hard core fan of gay themed movies and short stories. I was hopeful when I bought this DVD but was disappointed when I watched it. The acting is bad and I know that the budget was only $10,000, but the camera work could use some work. I think that maybe if these stories were retold but with a better budget and better actors then maybe it would make more of an impact. If I could I would give this a 1/2 star. I have watched other movies that were low budget but were still very powerful. I think maybe the director should have waited until he could scrounge up some more money. Next time hopefully he will learn from his mistakes.",1122681600,15,667,4.178294573643411
2247593,2,B0007WFXH6,"A very disappointing collection of short films.  The director says that these are ""important"" stories, but I just found most of them to be depressing and way too caught up in how clever they were trying to be.",1121212800,10,209,4.5
2247594,4,B0007WFXH6,"I must admit that when this DVD arrived in the mail I took one look at the cover art and thought ""what the hell have I wasted my money on?""  But, to my surprise, this wonderful compilation of short films (that felt incredibly true to life) turned out to be a great purchase!  All the stories are gay themed, and all deal with topics that will resonate with damn near anyone, gay or straigt.  They run the gamut from the emergernce of gay identity through youthful innocence to the horror of child molestation (my personal favorite story).  The writing is impeccable and very, very credible.  Michael J. Saul, the film's impassioned and smart director, has a magnificent way with actors that shows throughout this impressive production.  What's most amazing, though, is he made this film for $10,000 using two digital cameras, final cut pro, and a lot of love and dedication from an all volunteer cast and crew.  This is a success story of talent, sweat equity and very sound decisionmaking paying off. I applaud Mr. Saul for a job well done and urge anyone reading this review to purchase his DVD, make some popcorn, invite a few friends over and enjoy a remarkably touching show.",1115424000,64,1180,4.699029126213592

So good. So artistically, beautifully good.

The only example of 'true love' is the short, Sunday which is actually out of place in this collection which is supposedly about growing up and coming out. (It features an older couple.)

I found History a little offense and irresponsible storytelling suggesting a negative stereotype of the young gay experience, or is it? The saving grace of this collection is A Little Drama. Simple, sweet and memorable.

Overall, the acting is pretty poor. Or, the actors were directed poorly. In either case, the acting leaves a lot to be desired.

The seven vignettes cover a wide range of gay men and boys finding, keeping, and examining the nature of  love.  They build in interest and intensity to the quietly spectacular concluding film, A Little Drama, set the music of Wagner's Tristan and Isolde -- a great big drama, indeed, and one of opera's greatest love stories.

Without dialogue, A Little Drama circumscribes a poignant moment in the life of a vulnerable high school boy, perfectly played by sweetly sexy Brett A. Newton.  Working the light board of a production of Romeo and Juliet, he falls for the boy playing Romeo (virile, handsome Ryan Thomas).  Mesmerized by Ryan's beauty and strength, light boy nearly misses his cues.  Whenever Romeo glances his way he melts, panics, yearns, suffers.  A world of emotion passes across Brett's beatific face as the two exquisite boys wordlessly play out their gut- and heart-wrenching counterpoint to the stunning music.

8053056,3,B0007WFXH6,Just a so-so movie about two gay men struggling to keep their relationship as a couple alive. Nothing especially exciting about the film. Nothing especially bad about it either. Just kinda blah.,1486339200,,194,5.09375
8053057,3,B0007WFXH6,"It had its moments, but for the most part I found this to be the same old, tired, gay drama-queen histrionics with a to of blah blah dialogue especially in the last selection of the film which offers several shorter stories.  The story of confrontation of an uncle for sexual abuse was interesting with a twist. The production values were better than many. I can't move higher than 3 stars, sorry. With all the gay talent it is disappointing that we get so much of this genre repeated.",1486339200,,485,4.511363636363637
