8614303,5,B00FC5DHGC,"I'm in the USA and loving these DVDs!! Thanks to another reviewer (Darlene Deters) who mentioned VLC media player (free to download) I'm able to watch this! I was able to change my region on my MacBook Pro to region 2 (it might work without that download but I didn't try until afterwards). I'm very happy. I love this show!! I wish there were lots more seasons. Chris O'Dowd is amazing and so is the whole cast. One day I will visit Ireland, until then...I'll have to watch Moone Boy..a lot.",1488153600,,492,4.417582417582418
8614304,5,B00FC5DHGC,"I so want to buy this on dvd region 1!  I want to give it to some friends as a gift, but I know they don't have region 2 dvd players.  It is the funniest series to come along in years.  The characters are all loveable and hilarious!",1430870400,3,232,3.7916666666666665

8614306,5,B00FC5DHGC,Fabulously entertaining program; unfortunately unable to purchase and re-watch due to REGION 2 programming.  Hope to see it again on PBS sometime and more hopeful that it will be produced in Region Free format.,1416873600,4,210,5.176470588235294
