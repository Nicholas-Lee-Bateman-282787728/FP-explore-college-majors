While browsing through the movie titles at Amazon.com, I searched for this rare title and was delighted to find it.  ""Years of Lightning, Day of Drums,"" produced by the United States Information Agency and made available through the Historical Archives, is a deeply moving tribute to John F. Kennedy.  This beautifully produced film touches on Kennedy's accomplishments during his thousand days in office as our thirty-fifth president, and captures the depth of the grief the world experienced when he left us.  Bruce Herschensohn's musical score and Gregory Peck's narration added the perfect touches to this finely-crafted documentary.  I would highly recommend this film to everyone who appreciates the contribution JFK made to our nation's history.

8261058,5,B00166DGUS,I cry a lot everytime I see this DVD. Since the first time I watched it on TV I've been trying to be strong whenever the program aired during the week of the Anniversary of  President John F Kennedys Assassination.,1451088000,,214,4.35
8261059,5,B00166DGUS,"This one was a series of JFK movies made during his 1960 campaign during his presidency, and his terrible sad death by assassination. A great addition to any DVD library!",1417132800,,170,4.7
8261060,5,B00166DGUS,"I worked on Wisconsin Avenue in Bethesda, MD. outside DC at this time.  I was in many of the places shown.  I stood with the people.  I viewed the casket in the Rotunda.

The DVD catalogs JFKs life and accomplishments.  It puts historical events in chronological order.  I lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis, but did not know what else was happening elsewhere in the world at the same time.

Watching the funeral brought back memories that I had forgotten.  Watching it put me there again.",1353715200,2,493,4.651162790697675

8261062,3,B00166DGUS,"This documentary use to air each year on broadcast TV around the time of JFK's death.  It's an emotional record of JFK's years in office with rare archival footage including his most famous speeches.

The only downside is that the transfer quality is poor from the original to this copy.  It almost looks like it was transferred from a videotape.

Either way, it is worth buying since the price is reasonable and it is unavailable in any other format.",1306108800,,451,4.670886075949367
8261063,3,B00166DGUS,"I was very glad to find the program ""John F. Kennedy-Years of Lightning, Day of Drums"" on DVD.  My original VHS copy was in danger of breaking and I wanted the DVD to become a lasting medium to use well into the future.  Unfortunately, the video quality of the DVD is not good.  The color is faded and the brightness is very poor...in fact, the DVD seems more like a black and white program than a full-color one.  The details are often lost in the darkness of the DVD.  The audio is fine, and the program will serve its purpose...but I was very disappointed in the poor video quality.",1301011200,5,585,4.330275229357798
8261064,5,B00166DGUS,"""JOHN F. KENNEDY: YEARS OF LIGHTNING, DAY OF DRUMS"", narrated with great style and class by actor Gregory Peck, is a wonderful documentary film that tells the story of the all-too-short Presidency of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, who was inaugurated as the 35th President of the United States on January 20, 1961, and died at the hands of an assassin just 1,037 days later.

Featuring a remarkable musical score that words alone cannot possibly do complete justice to, ""Years Of Lightning, Day Of Drums"" is, in this reviewer's opinion, one of the very best films or documentaries ever created about President Kennedy.

The 85-minute film was made in 1964, very shortly after JFK's November 1963 assassination. It was produced by the United States Information Agency for release in foreign countries. But the film was so popular, it was finally released in U.S. theaters (through an act of Congress, no less) on April 10, 1966.

Also included in the movie is an abundance of rarely-seen color film footage of President Kennedy's funeral processions through the streets of Washington, D.C., on November 24 and 25, 1963.

""Years Of Lightning"" was written and directed by Bruce Herschensohn, who also composed the film's stellar and poignant original musical score as well. It was practically a one-man Herschensohn show. And a well-crafted show it is, too.
