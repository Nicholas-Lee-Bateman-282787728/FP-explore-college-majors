2963432,4,B000W90ITM,"A minor but effective film noir. Angela Lansbury is beautiful and plays the role with the swagger of the period. Keith Andes has a superb voice.
More than one resolution was possible and any would have been appropriate; but the one chosen is satisfactory.",1407369600,2,255,4.818181818181818
2963433,2,B000W90ITM,"I want to like this movie.

The sound of the film is terrible - very fuzzy and makes the dialog very hard to hear. I had to turn the volume up so far that the noise was uncomfortable and the dialog still hard to hear clearly.
Angela Lansbury was 29 and played a femme fatale. Keith Andes was goooood loooookin' as always!
I'm trying to watch it again to see if I can tell what it's actually about - appears to be a life insurance scam?

Who knows, I don't because I can't understand what's being said.  :/",1400976000,,505,4.13265306122449
2963434,3,B000W90ITM,"It was interesting to see Angela Landsbury in a  young sensual, bad girl role. When the supposedly innocent ""good girl"" sister stares at a large bill at the end one wonders if the ""hero"" will be duped again. It was short, but not sweet but I wanted to see how it ended.  As always, the black and white background  is perfect for this type of film and the quality of the film itself was much better.  The older husband may be upstaged but he plays his part well.

2963444,5,B000W90ITM,"An architect named Edward Shaw (Keith Andes) has fallen on hard times, barely able to keep his head above water. Providentially, he encounters a woman named Doris Hillman (Angela Lansbury) who offers him a big designing project that could easily solve his money problems. Doris is in real estate, and also happens to be filthy rich! Though Edward starts to get suspicious of her intentions, he winds up doing business w/ Doris and her husband, Gus (Douglass Dumbrille). Shaw even lets Doris talk him into a big fat life insurance policy! Then, one day, while having lunch w/ Doris' younger sister, Madge (Claudia Barrett), she tells him of Doris' first husband, his big life insurance policy, and his terrible ""accident"". Soon after, Shaw almost has a tragic ""accident"" of his own! Of course, the police can't help him because he has no actual proof that anything criminal has happened. Uh oh! Shaw has another near-fatal ""accident"" after visiting the Hillman's mountain cabin! Is this couple really trying to kill him, or is Edward simply being paranoid? A LIFE AT STAKE is a very good crime thriller, as well as a nice vehicle for Ms. Lansbury to show off her wicked side! Plus, there's a wonderful finale!...",1418601600,4,1211,4.883495145631068

8221686,1,B000W90ITM,This movie is definitely substandard. The quality is bad. The audio as well as the visual is almost impossible to watch. I was very disappointed with this purchase.,1525392000,,164,4.892857142857143
8221687,3,B000W90ITM,"This was a good movie!  Not great, but good. Here's why:
-The plotline was very safely played, no twists, no surprises.
-Acting was good, but there really wasn't much excitement, in terms of ""drama"". No intensity.
-For some reason, Doris (female lead) had sound issues, her voice always sounded pretty muffled! Not sure why, everything else was fine!
-Cliche details that you know are going to come back around at the end of the movie. (Door opening to a cliff??? ""We were supposed to have a porch there..."" she says. pfffffft. *eyeroll*)
-Predictability throughout.

I did like this movie, I just had to see it for what it was. A good romantic ""mystery"" from such a classic era. I recommend at least watching it and finding out for yourself, but don't expect to be delighted by the plot itself.",1521763200,,795,4.712230215827338

8221689,3,B000W90ITM,"Not a bad noir-ish movie by any means, but it is held back by some stilted acting and dialogue (which strangely adds to its mystique at the same time, at least that was my experience).  Some of the story was a bit silly, such as (warning: spoiler alert) a window that opens directly over the edge of a cliff.  A convenient detail that is sure to be used before the movie ends.  But really, who designs a house like that, where a window opens to a sheer drop at the edge of a cliff?  Entertaining movie?  Yes.  A classic movie that deserves to sit at the top of the heap?  No.  But again, it did hold my interest.",1510099200,,612,4.127118644067797
8221690,3,B000W90ITM,"I like the actors but not the movie.  By the way, Amazon should hire a proofreader.  Summary states an ""elicit"" affair- that  should read ""illicit"" not ""elicit"". Tsk! Tsk!",1502582400,,171,4.827586206896552

8221693,2,B000W90ITM,"Such an obvious knockoff of Double Indemnity (1944), some of the initial exchange between Lansbury and the protagonist (an unknown) at the pool reads like the studio screenwriter just substituted the classic Wilder dialogue for moldy scraps. The plot makes no sense; the drama becomes farce by the end. Two stars for Lansbury, looking good and doing what she can to rescue the hopeless plot and dialogue.",1472688000,,404,5.044776119402985
8221694,3,B000W90ITM,"Far from great, a ""too light"" noir in which the principals are mainly bathed in strong California sunshine, this is one of so many variants on the ""Double Indemnity"" formula.  But it makes me think of how brilliant and adaptable a performer Angela Lansbury has always been, from musicals to intense evil in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" to anything thrown at her to portray.  A rather short film without much time for character development or audience involvement -- with Lansbury on her own equaling and surpassing the value of the entire remaining cast.  Any film of hers, whether widely known or unknown as this one was to me, is worth the time.  (I should note that Jane Darwell's brief turn as the landlady is also quite a treat.)",1471564800,2,732,4.74015748031496
