5339849,4,B009INABXG,"Celebrating a centennial event last year inspired this telefilm starring the always adorable Bailee Madison ('Once Upon a Time') and telling a surprisingly cute, if not common story centered on the Girl Scouts. It's a script that left me thrilled to pieces by its endearing prowess at its conclusion.

Moving from no-where-ville Alaska to a smaller community that actually has a population seemed like a good idea at the time. With a move comes the opportunity for young Daisy (Madison) to make new friends - which is just what her father wanted for her, but she soon realizes that she is quite unprepared to hold together the barely there girl scout troop 114 when the gang of misfits have no leader. Yet, the job falls to her. Enter Julie Sterling (Jessalyn Gilsig), a determined real estate agent who's made her living lying to clients just to get prestigious titles and enviable promotions. Much to Julie's dismay, her boss (Patricia Richardson) - who just happens to be a former troop herself, volunteers Julie to lead the Fireflies as a part of a community outreach. Now instead of neat showings and a perfectionist lifestyle, Julie is car-pooling and trying to lead a group of girls who are each struggling with feelings of being invisible or challenges at home.

Julie Sterling, saleswoman extraordinaire may have met her match.

Writers - whether they are of the publishing or screen sector, seem to lack brilliant or even mediocre approaches when it comes time to wrap a story; writing really good endings to otherwise sweet stories seems a failing these recent years. Coming from a girl who actually likes fuzzy romantic comedies (even those awkward television films - clearly this movie is proof!), there seems to be an even worse decline when it comes to ending movies. Specifically speaking of this film, I thought it hit all the right strides - there was cuteness overload, lessons learned, a group of kids learning self-worth, and then just when you are nestled in that cocoon of sweetness and goofy grins, comforted that there actually are movies you could show to a ten-year-old,  the movie loses it. Like, why-is-are-the-girls-crying, running-after-a-bus losing it. The whole ordeal seemed overly dramatic and more of an awkward scene meant to inspire emotion - what writers tried to do and what they didn't do are two very different things.

Distracting from the usual flaws is a fun cast! Though unfamiliar with Gilsig's credits, I liked her in the lead role as well as seeing Patricia Richardson in something again - and of course, the always brimming with personality Bailee Madison was adorable in the role of daughter and girl trying to keep together a failing troop. Also in the cast list is Ty Olsson and Michelle Creber. Several instances of the script were fantastic - like the girl's barbs toward Julie (particularly one of them ""assessing"" whether or not there is chemistry between Julie and a romantic interest) or the mishaps in the house showings, and then there are the commonalities that an audience pegs long before even the story is ready to reveal them. Once all is said and done, this is a darling charm of a movie. It's got some pizzazz and there are no ""baddies"" to wish ill-will on. (For a crime-loving fandom girl like myself, that can sometimes be a welcoming breath of fresh air!) It's sassy and sweet  - kinda' like a thin mint cookie.

5339853,4,B009INABXG,"Julie Sterling (Jessalyn Gilsig) is one of them high maintenance birds, the sort that makes a guy cringe when he ends up on a blind date with her. Julie is a snobbish, workaholic realtor. She bribes children to hang out in a house she's showcasing so that it feels more homey to potential buyers. She answers her cell like this: ""Julie Sterling. Everything I touch turns to sold."" She's got her face plastered on bus benches and billboard signs all over the city. Julie Sterling is a bright cog in the real estate world. Man, she can practically smell being made partner. Only, that has to be later. Today the firm is engaged in a crucial merger deal with a high-powered agency that advocates strong community relations. To make Julie's firm look good, she's volunteered by her boss as troop leader to a quintet of hapless girl scouts. Julie harbors a distaste for children, but her whining - ""They're messy and they're distracting!"" - falls on deaf ears. Off she goes to play reluctant den mother to Troop 114, the sad-sack Fireflies.

Hallmark Channel movies aren't so original. There's a formula the network clings to with limpet-like steadfastness. SMART COOKIES manipulates you and it's not even subtle about it. There's the underdog element and the protagonist in need of an attitude adjustment. I think whether you enjoy this movie or not hinges on how you take Jessalyn Gilsig. She plays what I call the ""Tom Cruise part."" Julie Sterling is a hot mess, initially condescending and dismissive and just plain unlikable. Does she grow on you enough as the story progresses and her time as troop leader begins to soften her?

Okay, maybe a spoiler alert or two from now on.

If SMART COOKIES has a secret weapon, it's the (then) 12-year-old Bailee Madison, who is a tiny powerhouse. As Daisy, she's the ringleader of the Fireflies, recalling to mind every uber-organized little girl you'd ever met. But Madison is so appealling it collapses any attempt by the script to make her character annoying. I'd call her precious, except I don't want to be that pretentious jackwagon. This is Hallmark, home to sappy, nexus to coincidence, so keep that dubious eyebrow even-keeled when Daisy's dad turns out to be that same opinionated handyman with whom Julie had been having a running spat. At one point he caustically informs her, ""I sat on a bus bench with a picture of you on it. And, by the way, I got a splinter."" Hallmark is so sentimental and so obvious, it should write greeting cards.

Julie's ninety days of service are fraught with misadventure as she demonstrates how unqualified (and disinterested) she is as troop leader. She brings the girls to her real estate appointments and then hides them in the pantry. And who shows up at a river clean-up project dressed in a business suit? (hint: her name rhymes with ""Julie Sterling."") She traumatizes the girls when the DVD about rivers that she gives them turns out to be Anaconda. There is, of course, a cookie drive, and that's when Julie's competitive juices begin to flow, seeing as how the Fireflies' arrogant rivals, the Monarchs, have won this sales event eight times running. There's a fun scene in which the Fireflies and the Monarchs find themselves on opposite sides of the street and trolling for the same customers and they both start undercutting their cookie prices. It's around this juncture that Julie really starts connecting with her girls. Not coincidentally, this is when you start liking Julie. Well, I don't know about you. This is when I started liking her. Jessalyn Gilsig is perhaps too good at playing these unsympathetic women. I'd mention that she wasn't likable, either, as Terri Schuester in GLEE except I'd then be admitting to having watched GLEE.

I, a manly man, don't mind being manipulated by Hallmark. I occasionally don't mind getting lumps in my throat that aren't burnt bacon bits. SMART COOKIES unfolds predictably. You see everything coming... you're not even gobsmacked when the shy girl scout (Michelle Creber) busts out in song. But then, very deep in the film, you're ambushed by a series of emotional beats, unexpected in their strength and ability to move you, thanks mostly to Gilsig and Madison.

SMART COOKIES aired in 2012 to commemorate the 100 year anniversary of the Girl Scouts of America. It's harmless fun for the whole family; the kids will love it. Bailee Madison is delightful. I'd just like to remind folks that girl scouts are prohibited from discounting the price of their cookies. It's probably mentioned in the girl scout pledge.",1369440000,14,4553,4.860824742268041

5339887,4,B009INABXG,"This is a typical Hallmark movie. A singleminded businesswoman is ordered to volunteer as a Girl Scout troop leader to a quintet of misfits. All (but one) of the girls learns to shine and the businesswoman finds her humanity... and a budding relationship with one of the girl's single father. There's a big battle with a rival troop to sell the most Girl Scout cookies, complete with musical interlude and heartwarming moment of compassion.

Yes, this movie is rife with stereotypes (single woman is a shrew until she finds a child to mother and a man to love), but it's fun to watch with the family. The competitiveness between troops is shown to come from adults, rather than the Girl Scouts themselves. I would certainly recommend having a discussion with your children or Girl Scout troop about what the movie does well and what it does poorly. For example, it shows the strength of girls working together and supporting each other, the toxicity of excessive competition, and the ability of Girl Scouts to help individual girls find their strengths. It also shows a character whose only role seems to be ""the fat girl"", and this child doesn't develop at all over the course of the film and is the one girl from the troop left off the DVD cover. Shame on you, Hallmark Channel. It's not like other characters aren't shown chowing down on cookies.

Some things about the Girl Scouts are spot on, others less so. (I speak from the experience of having been a Girl Scout in the 80s, and of currently being a troop leader after being just a mom/assistant leader for 2 years before that.) The uniforms, Girl Scout store and its commercialism, the Girl Scout handbook, and the service projects are all exactly like my experience. The few quibbles I have are minor: a campfire being lit without an adult around who knows what she's doing, being able to give away Girl Scout cookie profits (our council only leaves our troop 10% of cookie sales income, so not turning in money is out of the question), getting to set cookie price discounts at the troop level, real time cookie sale counts and inter-troop competition aren't part of our GSUSA experience. The Girl Scouts has a rule that two non-related adults must be present at events, so a solo leader running a meeting and not meeting the girls' parents stretches the imagination (although I'm sure there are plenty of people who ignore that rule from time to time).

If you're thinking about watching this movie with your Girl Scout troop:
* You don't want them thinking that the experience represented on the screen will be theirs. Either:
 ** Watch it after some of the girls have already had one season of cookie selling experience so that they recognize the fictionalized aspects of the storyline.
 ** Discuss with your troop what you notice as being made up for storytelling purposes.
* Ask your girls to discuss the following topics after they watch the movie:
 ** What characters were fleshed out and grew over the course of the movie? Which ones didn't?
 ** What stereotypes were represented?
 ** What aspects of Girl Scouts were accurately represented? Which were not? Why did the filmmakers take license with the latter?
 ** How do some of the lessons from this film apply to real life?",1461801600,2,3244,4.73758865248227

5339958,4,B009INABXG,"Top realtor Julia Sterling was ""volunteered"" by her boss to be a troop leader to a misfit group of girl scouts, called the Fireflies.  After many trial and errors with the girls, Julia began to realize that working together and having friends can be more rewarding than being Realtor of the Year.

In celebration of the Girl Scout's 100 year anniversary, Hallmark honored the group with ""Smart Cookies"" - a fun, but exaggerated, movie about the clash between two troops selling Girl Scout cookies.  Okay, at the start of the movie, there were a few scenes that I found a little incredulous.  Really?  What kind of professional would take the girls to a house she was showing?  However, after 35 minutes of this, Daisy (played Bailee Madison) finally had enough of our heroine's selfish ways and this was the welcome turning point.  Julia began to behave in a more adult manner and you can finally get her.  We get down to the nitty, gritty of selling and the girls' background stories.  The girls were a good variety of personalities that I think any person can form an affinity with at least with one of the characters.  And okay, the outcome was a wee bit predictable.  But you know what?  This movie was fun, with lot of great variety of characters.  So, don't go in expecting the expected.  There was a depth to this movie that really showcased what it really means to be a girl scout or just being a caring person.  And the end of the movie did make me a little misty-eyed.  How can you not get invested in these young ladies?  An added bonus for me was that there was a romance.  The acting was as well done.  Everyone's acting was a little over the top at the start but calmed down by the end.

This is a clean wholesome movie that the whole family can enjoy.  There is light humor, a small romance and a good moral lesson to learn.  This is not for everyone.  If you are looking for major drama or something unique, pass this one by.  Everyone else?  Try it out when you have time.  This is an easy movie to watch in one sitting.

5339961,3,B009INABXG,"We all know people like these and even find ourselves falling into some of the competitive traps, on occasions.  This had a delightful cast and a clever plot, but I wish the competition had been toned down and the entire theme had not been quite so extreme.  It seemed to go much too far and make fun of any and all the features of Scouting, environmental care, and all the other kinds of things that were part of the story.",1376956800,10,424,4.2875

8541870,5,B009INABXG,"Great Story! Love Bailey Madison in almost everything. I was never a girl scout but my niece was. After reading the critical reviews I still loved the movies but they made sense. 5th girl should have been on the cover. I really think her scene where she answered the phone then called out 3+2, with a view, was to show she may be a future realtor. I am not familiar with the semantics of the Girl Scouts but I can perceive the pride they have and I agree that the way the other scout leader conducted herself probably is not truly reflective of the GSOA. However movies are made with an objective in mind and this one was obviously made to honor the GSOA but also to show how to rise above one's limitations and be all you can be. Either love it, or don't. Enjoy!!!!",1520380800,,766,4.2534246575342465
8541871,3,B009INABXG,"I would give this 3.5 stars. I watched it with a Girl Scout troop of mostly 6th graders. They thought it was ok, but best for 5th grade and younger. I think it's heart-warming - although predictable - and I like how the romance develops gradually. It's cool for the girls to see real Girl Scout uniforms, books and badges featured and the passion people have for Girl Scouts, although the rules of Girl Scouts are completely ignored in the movie. As some other reviewers have noticed, I strongly dislike that the ""fat girl"" is not featured on the movie jacket, is always eating candy and sweets, and does not seem to be given as much attention as the other characters. At one point, all the girls ask their leader what special thing they can contribute and she has an upbeat answer for all of them - except the fat girl, who gets a very flip reply of ""Uh, I'll get back to you."" This is a real disappointment in a film and organization that is about supporting girls. But this makes for a worthwhile conversation to have with your troop about what is good and bad, accurate and unrealistic in the movie.",1503705600,,1103,4.438423645320197

8541873,3,B009INABXG,"This movie is just ok.  It's a watered down Mighty Ducks kind of story.  I'm a big fan of cheesy Hallmark movies, but this one was a let down.
I would give it a 2 but my Brownies and Juniors said they liked it, and they did sit through the entire movie, so I gave it a 3.
If you have Scouts that want to see it, it's worth the $5 to rent, but not $15 to own.  I think I paid $10 for my copy a year ago and now that I've watched it once I'll probably pass it along to another leader.

 We thought it was going to be much funnier.  My girls were bummed there was no kiss at the end (from the grown ups).  And as others have noted, nothing that happens in this movie could actually happen in real life.  I don't expect Hallmark to sit down with a copy of Volunteer Essentials and follow all the rules, but the cookie booth thing, the money at the end, the prize getting taken away - none of that makes any sense.  The rival leader is mean, she needed to be more ridiculous to be funny.",1501718400,,982,3.8944723618090453
