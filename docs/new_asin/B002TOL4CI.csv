8380404,5,B002TOL4CI,"I've given this a 5 only because the only other review needs an anitidote.

There is the sanitized vision of the 1950s, one of all-American goodness and fairplay, and the revisionist image of the 50s, an uptight, racially, politically and religiously intolerant society seething with prejudice and hatred.  (It will be interesting to see how the early 21st century will be perceived by our grandchildren.)

This film attempted to acknowledge that amidst all that seething prejudice, the ideals of brotherhood and fairplay were alive and well, and to remind its audience that those were the ideals to be embraced.  Since films can only be made in the here and now, the makers of this seem to us a little self-consciously tolerant and celebritory of differences in the American melting pot.  Maybe we're a little more cynical or hyper-critical of intentions now, but we're not nearly as smart as we think we are.  I so hope our grand children will tell us so loudly and clearly one day (as theirs will them LOL).

Anyway, the film's heart is in the right place even if, to us, it's message of tolerance is a little heavy handed.  Maybe that's not such a bad idea sometimes, particularly when thinking of the social history of the time. And any film whose message is 'we're all in this together, trying to make the country and the world a better place' is OK by me.

Enjoy it as a time capsule of its time and place, because you admire some of its stars, as proof that people living at the time were well aware that everything in their world was not perfect even as they celebrated the belief that it could be.

And cut the past some slack.  You're going to need the same compassion for your own times and beliefs one day.",1324684800,17,1719,4.584967320261438
8380405,1,B002TOL4CI,"This is a film from the golden age of message pictures. Its a multi-part anthology which wants to tell the story of america but ends up doing social lessons.

The all-purpose wrapper at the beginning with William Powell and James Whitmore tell us that there are many different Americas.

1) ""Minister in Washington""

The best (worst) of the lot. The message is that FDR was himself a sort of god, that religion has no place in public life and that anyone religious who speaks out on any public issues in public is doing bad. Even Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone) of the Andy Hardy movies says so.

Directed by William Wellman of all people.

2) ""Texas""

A guy from Montana (Gary Cooper) does a hammy bit talking about Texas. The only good thing is that everyone involved seems to know that they are doing nonsense. Silly as it is, its probably the only piece in the film with any value at all.

3) ""Four Eyes""

A bunch of goof Italian stereotypes learn the power of the american public schools to make them better.

4) ""Rosika, the Rose""

A guy picks up a girl off the road he does not know, offers her a job as an apprentice stenographer in his ice cream shop and then proposes to her. She accepts. The problem isn't the incredibly stupid nature of their relationship, the problem isn't asking why ice cream shops hire stenographers, its that she is Hungarian and he is greek. And then suddenly the entire Greek Atheltic club shows up in gym gear presumably to beat up an old man and his daughters.

5) ""Letter from Korea""

An old woman finds out that one of her dead sons war friends in Korea was jewish. She is initially confused because her son never mentioned Maxi his letters to her. But Maxi explains that he is ""Jo Jo"" in the letters. The end.

6) ""The Negro Story""

Not what the title would suggest. They basically roll off a long list of names of the famous circa 1950 backed by stock footage and then call it a day.

7) ""The Lady and the Census Taker""

An stereotypical old irish woman (just what the film needed to round out its stereotypes) is angry that she was missed by the census. So she goes to the newspaper (the solution to every problem in the era) to get her counted and we get another predictable outcome. Wave the flag. Roll the drums.

The film is amusing in a train wreck sort of way. Its also an example of how message pictures even with big budgets and all star casts usually result in badly done material.

There are people now, as then, who will leap to the defense of a really bad film based on the idea that good intentions mean more than bad results. But a bad script is a bad script and stereotypes based on extreme prejudice are so much the worse when they held up to defend noble ideals.

Even within the flaws of that era, this film could have been done much better. The sillyness of the Italian stereotypes could have been avoided. The actress playing the mother in ""letter from Korea"" puts her heart into performing the junk script she was stuck with. They might have found one real live African American to act in or at least speak over ""the negro story"". Someone could have edited the ""Rosika"" script so that at least it made a LITTLE bit of sense. I mean its not like love with parental disapproval was a new story at the time of the film and its not like it would have taken much to fix such a simple story script. ""Minister in Washington"" is probably the only piece that could not be salvaged because its message is that religion should have no role in public life at all.

The film was made with a-list talent on a good budget and it was made in a year that saw films like ""the African queen"" and ""streetcar named desire"". They could have done far better than what the film turned out to be.",1323993600,4,3729,4.353535353535354
