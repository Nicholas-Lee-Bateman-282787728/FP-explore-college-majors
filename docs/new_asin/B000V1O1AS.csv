8216180,5,B000V1O1AS,"I watched Rabbit in the Moon for my course in Remembering ""Internment"" and I have to say that it was definitely an eye-opening documentary that provided new insight into an otherwise not often talking about period of our history.
February 12, 2017 marked the 75th anniversary of Executive Order 9066, an order that forever changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and left an entire community deeply fragmented. There has been a distinct lack of conversation surrounding the mass incarceration of the Japanese during World War II. The American government, for years failed to take responsibility for the actions it took under the guise of military necessity and even now, the American education system has failed to educate students about this portion of our history. For many, pushing the memories of this painful past deep down felt as the better alternative than confronting the suffering they went through. Emiko Omori, a Nisei who was interned at a young age, rekindles a conversation, trudging up the memories of the camp and the experience the Japanese community went through in her stirring documentary, Rabbit in the Moon. The documentary follows the telling of not only the experiences her family went through the loss of her mother, the rifts that divided them, but also shares the experiences of other Japanese American internees that were subjected to persecution during this era. The documentary provides a closer look at the Japanese community and how it changed from how it was before the war to the fragmented community it became post-war. As Omori recalls, she states how the Japanese community knew what they were subjected to were concentration camps President Roosevelt himself termed them as such, but, at the time, the definition of concentration camps had evolved to be the tales of horror from within the German borders and many chose not to talk about their experiences not because it was too horrible, but because it wasn't bad enough.
Throughout the documentary, Omori shows scenes from what the media portrayed of the camp experience during the war versus the reality of their living conditions. They were described as not jails, assembly centers, not concentration camps, relocation centers, and the Japanese weren't prisoners but evacuees. The general public was led to believe the Japanese were kept safe within the confines of these camps with the necessary amenities and living with bright prospects. Schools and businesses would be built and that the Japanese were more than happy with their new living conditions. However, reality was far harsher. The camps were located in barren deserts and internees with housed without proper insulation, proper utilities, adequate privacy, or even basic medical facilities. The schools that were set up had no chairs, tables, books, or most other basic amenities. Soon after, the school was shut down so the children would help with the potato harvest. The documentary effectively aims to point out the misinformation the American government provided to cover up the inhumane treatment of the Japanese community and educate those who did not know the reality of these camps.
To a large extent, Omori stays true to the history of the incarceration of the Japanese community through the use of first-hand accounts from internees. The documentary is, at its core, a story-telling of different experiences those incarcerated went through and the impact it had on their lives as it did on so many other internees. It addresses the differing outlooks within the community and the clashes between the Issei and the Nisei in the camps. Omori doesnt present one set account of history, but rather multiple different outlooks and beliefs people had during the time. It is however, somewhat biased in nature. A view held by many within the Japanese American community, the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) was harshly critiqued in the documentary. However, the documentary fails to provide a balanced view of the JACL. Through only providing a pointed view of the JACL, the documentary shifts to be biased towards them, thus, to an extent, lowering its level of accuracy. On the other hand, it reflects the divide within the Japanese American community and the conversation of who were the real heroes of the war era? Were they those who complied with the draft and served in the military as a show of their loyalty? Or those who resisted and rebelled against the draft and the No-No boys who answered no to controversial questions 28 and 29 on the loyalty questionnaire? In this way, the documentary provides another much needed conversation starter about the differences within the community and how they affected the community as a whole.
This portrayal of there being more than one account of history rings true with Alice Yang-Murray in her writing, Historical Memories of the Japanese American Struggle for Redress. As Murray so plainly stated, not all members of one group always promoted the same history (Murray 3), as can be observed in the documentary. The concept of historical memory, as is presented, is that different accounts will support different versions of history. Members of the JACL and its supporters supported the outlook that the real heroes of the Japanese community were those that responded to the draft with compliance, while others felt that draft resisters and those who held firm in their beliefs for justice were the heroes. For the American government, the guise of military necessity, for which they hid behind for many years, was their version of historical telling one that undermined their responsibility in the injustices that occurred during the war. As the Japanese American community moved towards redress and presenting their experiences and version of history, observing the split between them, the concept of historical memory becomes clear.
Overall, the documentary does a remarkable job or providing personal experiences and placing them in a larger historical context. The issues that the Japanese American community faced and the rifts that divided them are clearly revealed and the reasons behind them are well explained. To a large extent, the documentary provides the opening of a conversation about the mass incarcerations in a way that allows those who went through the experience first hand can contribute to while including outsiders that need to be educated about this portion of American history. Despite being a heavily informational and emotionally compelling work, it is, as stated before, a conversation starter at its core. With the events occurring in society and government regarding the racism and xenophobia present today, it is crucial that people are educated about the injustices that occurred towards the Japanese American community so that. This pertains especially so to the point that Eric Yamamoto makes in Beyond Redress this conversation goes beyond the redress for the Japanese American community. The mentality cannot be simply it cannot happen again to Japanese Americans. Through understanding and delving into the history of incarceration, an important step can be taken towards ensuring that the injustices that occurred against the Japanese community cannot happen again to anyone ever (Yamamoto).",1489104000,,7265,5.23156089193825
8216181,5,B000V1O1AS,A fascinating first hand account on just what it must have been like to be in an internment camp. I had no idea of the scope of this and how many were interred. Needless to say it wasn't talked about much in school in the 60's. What an embarrassing mark on our history.,1361750400,,269,4.09433962264151
8216182,5,B000V1O1AS,"This is a beautifully crafted film that brings a personal touch to a very sad and shameful episode in American history.  I knew of the internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry during WWII, but did not realize the impact this had on individuals, families and the community.  I did not know of the loyalty questionaire or how it tore into families and community.  I was not aware that American citizens were stripped of citizenship or that the draft was implemented in the camps.  I think I was aware of those who volunteered for the armed services to prove their loyalty, but still have a hard time understanding how they could support a government which imprisoned them and their families.  This film put names and faces to historical facts learned in the classroom.

What really caught my attention was the author's words in the introduction:  Why I didn't have children...Being an American caught in a foreigner's body.  I am first generation American born of Chinese ancestry and grew up in suburban New York.  My parents were young adults during WWII and felt the racial prejudices around them.  I could never understand how the government could draft people who, by law, were not permitted to immigrate or to apply for citizenship.  My father simply says:  We were allies.  After WWII and after being allowed to become American citizens, I remember my parents and their friends still fearing deportation during the McCarthy era--the loyalty question (the choice was not America vs China, but rather which China).  Outwardly, we were Americans, with the house, barbecue, trips to Yellowstone Park, but trapped inside was a Chinese family, always seen as foreign.  And my parents teaching the next generation that we too are foreigners.  A self love/hate situation.

One of the bonus interviews mentions today's Patriot Act and how it feels like legalized racial profiling all over again.  And the continuing arguements against immigration, jobs, health and social services to ""those people.""  It's sad that we haven't progressed further beyond profiling and stereotyping.",1351382400,,2079,5.115727002967359
8216183,5,B000V1O1AS,"The DVD arrived in my mailbox in pristine condition and, what was inside was even better.  I was pleasantly - surprised to see Chizuko Omori's name in the return address.  As for the documentary, the narration by Emiko Omori (producer) makes the journey back in time to the internment camps of World War II, very moving and, at times, disturbing.  This film ought to be in every classroom, both high school and college.  It takes you from the pre - war prejudice that the Japanese Americans faced, just because they were from a culture unfamiliar to their non - Japanese, white fellow - citizens.  The documentary shows the ignorance and hysteria so prevalent back then and, sadly, in many segments of the U.S. today.  Have we as a nation really learned from the mistakes of the past?

8216184,5,B000V1O1AS,"My parents and grandmother were American born U.S. citizens who were unjustly interned in concentration camps during WWII, so I was interested in watching this DVD. Most Americans are unaware of this unbelievable mistake ordered by our government and President Roosevelt. I am still learning about this tragic episode in history since most Japanese American families dealt with it by simply trying to diminish both their ancestry and the internment. It is a sad and moving account using interviews from Americans who suffered great prejudice and abuse and but also provides interesting and accurate historical information, photos and films. A great country like ours is not only proud of its accomplishments but also has the courage to recognize and the wisdom to learn from its mistakes. Excellent video for all Americans to watch!",1241568000,9,832,5.2631578947368425
