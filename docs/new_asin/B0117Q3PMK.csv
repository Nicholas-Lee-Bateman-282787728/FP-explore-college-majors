7328885,5,B0117Q3PMK,"What a fantastic satire on the old B-level Sci-Fi movies of the 1950's.  I was surprised by the reviewer who totally disliked this!  He or she must be significantly younger than me (age 66).  I saw the original theatrical release in the theater, and for many years after there were Rocky Horror showings on Friday nights where attendees were encouraged to dress as their favorite character and ""participate"" in the show.  What a spectacle that was with the entire audience doing the Time Warp!

The acting, especially Tim Curry, was fantastic.  After 40 years I still watch Rocky Horror anytime it is on TV, and when nothing is on worth watching my wife and I will watch the disc.  Maybe you just had to ""be there"" to have an appreciation for Rocky Horror, and thankfully I am glad to have been there.  what a GREAT movie!",1456531200,7,822,4.582191780821918

Michael Rennie was ill, the day the Earth stood still, but he told us, where we stand,
And Flash Gordon was there, in silver underwear,
Claude Rains was the Invisible Man,
Then something went wrong, for Fay Wray and King Kong, they got caught in a celluloid jam,
Then at a deadly pace, it came from outer space,
And this is how the message ran:
Science fiction, double feature.

The above comes from the opening (sung by disembodied oversized female lips with a male voice) of this completely different musical comedy horror film thats a satirical tribute to science fiction and horror B movies of the 1930s through to the early 1970s.

It is based on the 1973 musical stage production, The Rocky Horror Show by Richard OBrien (who acts in this movie as the character Riff Raff).

The story centers on a young engaged couple Janet & Brad (Susan Sarandon & Barry Bostwick) whose car breaks down near a castle called the Frankenstein Place where they seek a telephone (no cell phones at this time) to call for help.  The castle is occupied by Strangers (notice the capital S) in elaborate costumes celebrating the Annual Transylvanian Convention.

They discover that the head of the castle is a Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), an apparent mad scientist who is a transvestite.  (Yes, thats right, a transvestite mad scientist.)  Dr. Furter hails from (you guessed it) Transsexual, Transylvania.  (Well, maybe you never guessed it.)

The singer Meatloaf has a small part in this movie as Eddie.

A criminologist (Charles Gray) narrates the story.

The twenty songs found in this movie are quite good and catchy.  And Susan Sarandon sings!

When this film was first released, it was largely critically panned.  But thanks to midnight movies, this movie now has a large international cult following.  (Critics might like to know that this movie has earned almost one hundred times its original budget!!)

Not surprisingly, this movie was selected for preservation on the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress on 2005.

Finally, the DVD itself (the fortieth anniversary edition released in 2015) has six extras.  One of the extras gives you a choice between the U.S. or U.K. version of this movie.  The movie on this disc has been digitally remastered meaning that there are no blemishs or artifacts.

In conclusion, if you're looking to view something completely different, this is the movie to get!!  And whats the lesson learned from this movie?  One possible lesson is:

Its not easy having a good time.

I recently attended a live performance of The Rocky Horror Show and was so impressed I had to see the film based on the musical. The stage show was high-energy camp with amazing choreography! The horror musical comedy film mirrors the stage musical but lacks its explosive, imaginative choreography and the audience participation. It makes a difference. The Rocky Horror Picture Show drags at times, but overall maintains its energy with a powerful rock score. I recommend seeing the film because it is a unique viewing experience, but if you can find a professional stage presentation of the musical, thats a must-see experience.",1532217600,,972,4.969325153374233

Wither it is the story or the characters or the absurd enlivenment with so many unforgettable songs, this film was for years only available as a mid-night movie.
Generations grew up on this film and it may still have a future with generations to come.

Susan Sarandon from Janet Weiss to Jackie Harrison in ""Stepmom"" (1998).
She took her screen daughter to see The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

Tim Curry (who likes to play doctor) from Doctor Frank-N-Furter to Dr. Thornton Poole in ""Oscar"" (1991).

Barry Bostwick from Brad Majors to Det. Tucker Pendleton to himself in ""Hollywood Squares"" (1998) [TV-Series]

Meatloaf from Eddie to himself in ""Meat Loaf - Bat Out of Hell"" (1999)

Richard Milhouse Nixon from Himself (archive audio: resignation speech) to ""Speeches of Richard Nixon, The (1995) (V)"" (archive footage) he will always be with us.

8723724,4,B0117Q3PMK,"I've been a fan of this film ever since I experienced this film as an RHPS 'virgin' 35 years ago, and have owned or projected many variations (including 16mm) of this film. It is a rite of passage, and gosh darnit, a lot of fun. I have watched this film evolve in the home video market hoping to see it represent the experience as i first viewed. To date, they have almost made it, but are still missing the mark on a couple points. It is unlikely that I will see (or hear) this film any closer than it is now - my experience will always be relegated to the ""bonus features"" column, where we got to hear an encore of the Time Warp edited from the ballroom scene. The UK must have had the SFDF reprise, because that's what gets represented on home video from day one. (I'm not sure how the Super 8 highlight reel looks, though...it's probably faded red like all Eastman prints anyway).

Let's start at the beginning...shot open matte and released theatrically in the UK for 1.66:1 and the US for 1.85:1 and plain old optical mono, the musical numbers have a very dry sound due to the limits of optical soundtrack fidelity in 1975. Once again, theatrical prints (in North America anyway) had the ballroom Time Warp ending. I assume by the home video releases over the years, the UK got the SFDF reprise with the sax instrumental of the Time Warp (as heard when Brad and Janet first enter the castle with Riff Raff and Magenta).

in 1983, Ode/CNS released a 2-LP recording of fan interaction (the 'Audience Partici-pation Album'), recorded at the 8th Street Playhouse in New York with opening and closing remarks by fan club president, Sal Piro. The album was basically anin-house recording of patrons and fans doing callbacks to the film in its lo-fidelity mono glory. It was a landmark for two reasons - the first release of the full length feature (but without the closing credit sequence), at the dawn of the home video age, and the first consumer release of songs not on the stereo soundtrack album (""The Sword of Damocles"" and ""Planet, Schmanet!"")

In 1992, TCFHV released their darling of the midnight movie circuit to home video at a whopping $90 for VHS, and $30 for laserdisc, in full frame 1.33:1, before the age of boat anchor widescreen televisions was taking off, and with a new stereo soundtrack, which basically took the stereo album soundtrack and replaced subbed it for the songs in mono, leading to some out of sync moments (especially in The Time Warp, Sweet Transvestite and Rose Tint My World). The biggest change - the end credits sequence using the UK soundtrack, with the SFDF reprise and the instrumental sax version of The Time Warp first heard when Brad and Janet are inside the castle initially with Riff Raff and Magenta. This wasn't how I remember the film in theaters...Dammit, Janet!

in 1995, for the film's 20th Anniversary, Fox issued widescreen versions of the film in the matted UK 1.66:1 aspect ratio, for laserdisc fanatics and some VHS fans who wanted the experience but not the expense. The soundtrack remained unchanged. Hardcore LD fans could spring for a deluxe box set with bonus materials and a book and gold CD. They also got something new - a newly recorded audience participation track recorded in isolation on a Hollywood soundstage. The analog soundtrack featured the film on one side, and the callback on the other. However, something went wrong in the packaging of this release. - the audience was obviously watching a theatrical print of the film with the ballroom Time Warp ending, judging by some members singing ""Dentist!' from Little Shop Of Horrors during Columbia's tap routine. The film soundtrack was a fold-down of the stereo mix, so the reprise and sax soundtrack don't sync up to the callbacks. How that met Lou Adler's (or even Sal Piro's) approval is beyond me.

1995 also gave us a new audio experience - Ode and Rhino issued a CD of ""just the music"", the ""Sing It!"" soundtrack album. All the songs were there, including uncut versions of the music tracks for ""Over At The Frankenstein Place"", ""The Sword OF Damocles"", and the first release of the studio version of ""Planet, Schmanet!"". and the deleted ""Once In A While"", Brad's big musical number.

For its 25th anniversary, the film gets an upgrade for DVD, and it's huge - the soundtrack is remixed for 5.1 sound, plus the original UK mono soundtrack (with the SFDF/sax ending), and commentary with two of your favorite Transsexuals, Richard O'Brien and Patricia Quinn, and a new 1.78:1 widescreen transfer. We even get the UK version with 'Superheroes', the stuff of legend to North American audiences, who only got to see it in a rare 'misprint' (myself included), which made its way onto the bonus features, ported over from the 1995 laserdisc. The 5.1 mix does a nice job blending original mono vocal elements back in with the higher quality soundtrack recording, but (again) Dammit, Janet! The stereo ending now uses the SFDF reprise and and a newly edited 'ballroom Tme Warp based on the US ending, but instrumental only, from the ""Sing It!"" CD. The LD callback is included, but in a matrixed stereo mix, so the audience responses come from the rear speakers, but are out of phase on normal stereo devices, and again is out of sync to the remixed audio end titles.

Which brings us to this 35th anniversary disc. We get the film presented both ways again (US/UK), and with an upgrade in picture quality and sound, with a great HD audio mix. BUT...the callback is now in subtitle form on the ""experience"" extras

In the end, I would really have like Fox to include the US mono mix with the Ballroom 'Time Warp' ending, and fix the callback track. Then I would be happy with a definitive edition, with a faithfully executed multichannel mix, a comprehendable audience track, and ""a step to the right"".",1493510400,2,5824,4.714145383104126
