8601572,3,B002G9U98Q,"I had never heard of the Scared Crew before, and purchased 4 out of 5 of their dvds on a whim. This dvd is a little disappointing as I was expecting a group that would present their evidence after the investigation.
What I got, and this is true of the other three titles as well, is a long dissertation at the beginning of each one, chockful of history of the location. I was not terribly thrilled with some of the parts of the ""investigation"" which I discovered is not 100% ghost hunting. I found in their earlier dvds that the Scared Crew was more urban explorer with the ghost hunting more evident on the later dvds. Still, on nearly all of them, little evidence was to be found of ghosts.
I am not sure if I would buy any more of these. The locations are awesome, but there is not enough ghost investigation for my taste, and also, in the later dvd from the Philadelphia mental Hospital, too many outside people are milling around for the investigation to be any good.",1258848000,2,972,4.375690607734807
