7453645,5,B015XC8B5A,This movie is hilarious. Great cast.,1454025600,3,36,5.166666666666667
7453646,4,B015XC8B5A,"Curt (Rob Riggle) breaks a Satanic blood oath over a breath mint and gets sucked into a vortex that doesn't take him to Barnes and Noble. Remy (Nick Swardson) and Augie (T.J. Miller) follow in an effort to rescue him. They encounter a number of characters and a Devil who runs hell like a corporation.

First off, this is NOT for kids unless bad language and crude sexual references are okay with you. At times the humor was masterful and at other times it was just lame and crude.

To give you an idea of the humor: ""Hell- you're here for a reason or else you're Jewish.""

""Please clean up after yourself your mother doesn't work here unless she was a wh@r#.""

The Devil is dysfunctional similar to the South park devil. The film looks like 3D claymation. Mila Kunis had a hot demon character.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Ugly demon nudity. Plenty of crude sex talk. A good film for those that like the crude humor of teen sex comedies but none of the nudity. 3 1/2 stars",1452384000,,968,4.385474860335195
7453647,5,B015XC8B5A,Don't watch it with your young kids!  I only heard of it because my cousin is in the crew but the movie was quite funny. I laughed a few times and have always liked Danny McBride's tactless delivery.  Lots of celeb voices in this production.,1452297600,,241,4.333333333333333
7453648,4,B015XC8B5A,"Hell and Back (2015, Stop Motion) It seems most of the reviews on this movie are based on it's content more then the overall movie itself.  A word on that... Do not watch Hell and Back with your Mom (unless she is really cool), or choose it as a cozy second date DVD.  If you are easily offended this is not the movie for you.  Even if you consider yourself to have an ""adult"" sense of humor this may not be for you.  But if you enjoy being made to laugh and cringe in the same moment you have found your match.  A good portion of the humor is inappropriate and juvenile at best...the worst well :/.  But in-between there is also some sophisticated on point wit, so don't get too distracted by the butt jokes or you will miss some gems.  The real reason to watch this movie is because you love stop motion.  Let's face it despite a recent return to mainstream there is just not enough being made.  So if stop motion is your thing eventually you will see this,  instead of bootlegging a crappy copy off the internet spend the 12 bucks and support the medium.  There may be a lot lacking in plot and the voice talent, although impressive were not used to their full potential.  However Hell and Back makes up for almost all of its sins by looking pretty amazing. The character design is clean and consistent throughout the film.  (What is also consistent is some serious voiceover match up issues that are really below the talent involved in this project).  The set design is intricate and well executed.  There is a great depth of plane accented with dynamic lighting (including a skilled use of shadow not seen in a lot of contemporary Claymation).  Several scenes could stand alone strictly on technical merit.  All said if you are a stop motion fan you will find a lot to love here. Some pre screening advice I will pass on: ""frontload drinking and smoking and you should enjoy yourself just fine"" :p",1452297600,8,1902,4.435158501440922

7453650,4,B015XC8B5A,"Look, with the people behind robot chicken, it's juvenile for a reason. Don't give me wrong, the whole bit about buying a pizza at the combination pizza hut/taco bell was really funny. But about 75% of the jokes are aimed at pre-teens and stoners. And for such a diverse cast, from c-list like TJ Miller, to some a-listers like Mila Kunis, it seems they only did this for a paycheck, as if they gave any effort into their roles, it's definitely not there. But if you're still wondering why I rated this movie 4 stars, the reason is the animation. The animation in this movie, although off with their lip sync, is gorgeous, especially for claymation. The thing to know is these people worked hard animating this. It's not like regular cgi animation you'll see in a Disney or dreamworks movie nowadays. Claymation can sometimes take twice as long. In fact because it was a claymation was the only reason I saw this in theaters. There are a lot of nicely animated scenes. I only wish the people animating this had better things to work with. So watch it for the animation and not the comedy. Enough said.",1448409600,11,1101,4.565656565656566

8735009,4,B015XC8B5A,"Very well done animation. However, the jokes/ hummer do not go higher then poop, vomit, getting drunk, and over the top sex jokes that often are too much at once. This is a fun movie to watch if you have some adult friends that like this kind of humor, especially around Halloween. However, it can be a bit much at times. It is not South Park insulting humor that is clever with revealing a deeper story, its just poop and sex joke humor. Don't get me wrong, I can find these kind of jokes funny, but there is a limit. Also, just like ""Sausage Party"" I felt that the writers could have dialed back somewhat on the cursing/ F-bombs. However, the story was very interesting. The whole concept of two guys going to Hell in order to find their friend, the devil being in love with an angel, and a demon looking for her human/ womanizing father made for some good story telling.",1522972800,,873,4.361963190184049
