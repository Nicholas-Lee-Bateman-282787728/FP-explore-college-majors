8349311,2,B0021MB7K2,"I ordered this set for my son's family for Christmas. They watched what they could and loaned it back to us. I enjoyed most of the ""I Married Joan"" episodes. I tried ""Love that Bob"" and was very disappointed. Each and every episode that I tried to watch was full of point-y shaped women being pursued by Bob with only one thing on his mind...yucky. ""The Life of Riley"" was so dumb that it was hard to even follow the story line. And I mistakenly thought that raunchy t.v. series was something new in the last 30 years, boy was I wrong!",1428364800,2,535,4.254901960784314
