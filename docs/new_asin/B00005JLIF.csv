1477879,2,B00005JLIF,"Mystery films come and go; a precious few stand the test of time. ""Charade,"" for my money the greatest whodunit ever made, is a masterpiece of tone, miraculously blending the disparate elements of suspense, humor and romance more successfully than any film I've ever seen. Enhanced by the dashing beauty and charisma of its two stars, Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, the sophisticated wit of its ingenious script, the shimmering beauty of its on-location photography, and, of course, the classic strains of its Henry Mancini score, ""Charade"" is a movie that one can enjoy no matter how many times one has seen it.
I wonder how many people will be saying the same thing about ""The Truth About Charlie"" - Jonathan Demme's utterly pointless remake of this great film - four decades from now (the original title, ""Charade,"" is actually more appropriate because the story deals with lies, deception and falsehoods in general and not just in relation to that particular character).  I have absolutely no idea how anyone unfamiliar with the original work will respond to this film.  I can just say that, for diehard devotees of the 1963 Stanley Donen classic, ""The Truth About Charlie"" is a travesty on every level imaginable.  (And, alas, that great Henry Mancini score is nowhere to be found on this version's soundtrack, the first of many strikes against this modern rehash).
Although this new version shares the basic plot premise of the original, it has completely eliminated most of the elements that made ""Charade"" such a world-class, timeless charmer.  First of all, in what universe could Mark Wahlberg and Thandia Newton possibly be considered replacements for Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, two of the greatest screen legends of all time?  Yes, Ms. Newton has a certain attractiveness and appeal at times, but her one-note expression of pouting bemusement does grow tiresome after awhile.  The real trouble, however, comes with Wahlberg, a fine actor who has turned in some impressive film performances in the past, but who is just plain disastrous in this part.  His character is supposed to be a suave, debonair gentleman who attempts to win Reggie's confidence after her husband has been murdered for stealing $6 million and she becomes the hapless target of a band of hooligans who want their share and who believe she knows where it is.  Wahlberg has never looked more uncomfortable or out of place than he does here, trying to appear ""sincere"" and ""concerned, "" but coming across as merely epicene and amateurish.  This is, in fact, the worst case of miscasting I have seen in a film in a long, long time.  How can one have a remake of ""Charade"" - of all films! - with two stars who lack charisma and generate zero romantic chemistry when they're together on screen?
Even more detrimental, perhaps, is the fact that virtually all the wonderful humor from the original script has been excised, a strange turn of events indeed considering the fact that the original writer, Peter Stone, also had a hand in this venture (here he has assumed the pseudonym of ""Peter Joshua,"" one of the names ascribed to the Grant character in the earlier film, although the name, for no apparent reason, has been inverted for Wahlberg).  The very few comic lines that have been retained are delivered so poorly by the actors that we wince every time we hear them.
So now we have a remake of ""Charade"" utterly devoid of humor and romance.  What else could go wrong?  Well, in the original, the secondary characters all stood out as finely drawn figures in their own right.  The three men chasing Reggie for the money - James Coburn, Ned Glass and Arthur Kennedy - had each a retinue of fascinating personality quirks that helped distinguish one character from the other.  In ""Charlie,"" the three ""villains"" not only comprise a blandly homogenous group, but they do not even remain consistent as characters.  The most egregious example is Lola (Lisa Gay Hamilton) who spends the entire film bullying and threatening Regina, then inexplicably and in a matter of minutes, becomes some sort of heroine whom Regina comes to love and admire.  It makes no sense at all.  The concluding scene, in which the characters all meet up together to reveal their true identities and unravel the mystery, is so ham-handed in its execution that one wonders if the filmmakers ever even saw the flawlessly executed Donen original.  It is the low point in a film made up of little else but low points.  Demme has also injected an idiotic plot strand involving Reggie's husband's insane mother, but the less said about that the better.  In fact, one suspects that the sole reason for this storyline is to allow the director to feature famed French director Agnes Varda in a cameo role.  Indeed, ""Charlie"" is filled with all sorts of pointless homages to French culture in general and the French New Wave in particular, including a clip from Truffaut's ""Shoot the Piano Player"" and a truly bizarre cabaret scene with famed Jean Luc Godard actress Anna Karina belting out a song while the characters perform a surreal tango that throws us out of the film's world completely.  In fact, Demme has tried to recreate much of the style of 60's cinema by employing a camera that rarely ever sits still and a razzle-dazzle editing technique that attempts to substitute style for substance.  The effort is too self-consciously cutesy to be even slightly effective.
This does, however, bring us to the one undeniable element of value in ""The Truth About Charlie"":  Tak Fujimoto's eye-popping cinematography, which does a superlative job bringing out the colorful richness of the Paris setting.
A word of praise to anything or anyone else involved in this production would, however, be excessive.  Demme has taken a film that just about defines the word ""style"" and turned it into a hollow, soulless exercise utterly devoid of wit, suspense, romance and star charisma - all the elements in fact that made ""Charade"" such a golden, timeless treasure.  Avoid the theaters and head to the nearest video store to pick up a copy of ""Charade"" - and see what a great film is really all about.",1036195200,4,6138,4.871277617675312
1477880,3,B00005JLIF,"""The Truth About Charlie"" stars Thandie Newton and Mark Wahlberg as Regina Lambert and Joshua Peters, respectively. Regina is getting ready to divorce her husband, Charles, but returns from a trip abroad to find their high-class Paris apartment completely empty (and ransacked?). Confused, the young woman is then taken to the morgue, where she identifies her husband's murdered body. A suspicious Commandant Dominique questions Regina briefly, then let's her go, but not before exposing the deceased Charles to be a man with many passports, names, and appearances. Regina is soon approached by a government official named Bartholomew (Tim Robbins) who reveals even more about her mysterious husband, namely that he stole money from three operatives that now want the money back. Poor Regina is thus sent down an unwanted path of having to uncover the truth about Charlie, if only to save her own skin.
Joshua Peters (Wahlberg) always seems to appear whenever he is needed, usually to save the damsel-in-distress Regina, and there is obviously more to him than meets the eye. The three shady operatives, hot on the trail of the money they believe to be theirs, quickly show up, and the threats against Regina soon follow.
All of the aforementioned plot points make ""The Truth About Charlie"" sound as though it is quite a good film, filled with action, intrigue, mystery, and adventure. Well..... sort of, but not quite. Thandie Newton, as Regina, holds the film together. She is young, exotic looking, vulnerable yet strong, and is a rather competent actress. Aside from Newton, only Lisa Gay Hamilton and Joong-Hoon Park (as two of the shady operatives chasing after the money) are really engaging. Mark Wahlberg, alas, hits some rather flat notes as Joshua Peters, the character who screams through his actions ""I am not who I appear to be."" This is too bad, as it really made me miss the performance of Cary Grant, who played the Wahlberg role in the 1963 movie ""Charade"", which this movie is based on.
The direction of Jonathan Demme is a tad on the odd side. I have read in other reviews that it is influenced by the French New Wave. Being unfamiliar with that particular style, I can make no real comment, only that some of the camera shots and stylistic inserts were a little jarring. For example, whenever the body of Charlie is pulled out for viewing in the morgue, and people look at him, we are given a camera angle which looks at the people through Charlie's eyes. This is distracting, as we know the character to be dead, so it nearly screams ""This is a purposefully odd camera angle"", an effect which halts a movie for me. During a romantic scene in which Mark Wahlberg plays a CD by famous French singer Charles Aznavour, Aznavour himself suddenly appears in the room, singing from the corner. Yes, you read that right. During some of the more action-oriented scenes, loud Euro-techno music is played. In another scene, Joshua Peters and Regina suddenly become chummy with the three shady operatives, and go to a French disco together. See where I'm going here? Camera angles from the perspective of a dead man, singers suddenly appearing in hotel rooms, loud techno music, and socializing with the enemy tends to quash any hint of danger or intrigue that could be built-up during the course of the film.
There are things to enjoy about ""The Trouble With Charlie"". The fact that it was shot in Paris is evident (Demme includes enough shots of the Eiffel Tower that you get the idea). It was also nice to have mostly European actors and actresses involved (outside of the main roles). Sometimes subtitles were even used. This lent a great deal of authenticity to the feel of the film. And, truth be told, I rather liked *some* of the odd directorial decisions --- they made the movie just quirky enough. Thandie Newton is an actress to keep an eye on in the future, and her casting was an inspired choice.
1963's ""Charade"" was, for the most part, a foppish sort of film, relying heavily on the charm and wit of Cary Grant, and the beauty and style of Audrey Hepburn. Mark Wahlberg possesses no charm or wit, only muscularly handsome good looks. Thandie Newton, though good in her role, is not enough to carry off a believable romance between the two characters. ""The Truth About Charlie"" is fun, loud, directed in an unusual way, and sometimes engaging, but it is not as good as it could have been. And that is too bad.",1035936000,2,4433,4.78096479791395
1477881,4,B00005JLIF,"Thandie Newton has the awkward task of emulating one of the great masters of insouciance--Audrey Hepburn.  She succeeds admirably, and not because she copies Hepburn's glamorous wide-eyed performance of Regina, a wife whose husband, Charlie, has mysteriously died and left her with an unscrupulous band of treasure hunters chasing her all around Paris to obtain the whereabouts of his otherwise unknown cache of diamonds. Thandie simply plays Thandie, a curious personality mix of gamine, femme fatale and tomboy as interesting as her outward appearance.  Not spectacularly gorgeous, she nevertheless steals the entire show.

Jonathan Demme uses the same close-up camera angles that he used in 'Silence of the Lambs' to make the encounter with each of the characters seem so chillingly personal.  Here, the same technique works to elicit empathy with Regina's confusion---after all she is more or less set adrift after her husband's murder and the disclosure of his multiple identities by the police----large talking heads ram information into her brain until it careens with uncertainty and she (and the audience)floats about in a cloud of disjointed impressions which only make sense much later on.

Likewise, the camera jolts the audience through the streets of Paris where we get a colorful taste of the City of Lights' splendid diversity.  Sometimes this is nice and sometimes it isn't --- I admit to actually feeling dizzy as the camera catapulted me through the flea market in one scene--may have been I was just tired--the showing I saw started after 11pm. The soundtrack amply enhances the exotic feeling of floating on a cloud of confusion as encounter after encounter leaves Regina more and more perplexed and suspicious as to whom to trust.
The secondary cast successfully adds to the confusion---Regina is constantly forced to face one of their strange talking heads and glean the information that they ambiguously offer.  My one complaint was the casting of Mark Wahlberg as the deviously suspect Mr. Dyle.  If, as other reviewers suggest, this is just a remake of Charade and Wahlberg was supposed to take on Cary Grant's role---forget it---he isn't smooth enough to even get in the same ballpark.  With Hepburn and Grant, the audience got a filmload of chemistry-I didn't feel any of that electricity between Newton and Wahlberg.  Wahlberg is just too stiff, uninvolved and perhaps too preppie-ish to even attempt a suave con-man characterization.  (My apologies to Wahlberg fans--he just isn't the perfect fit here---I got the impression that the intensity so discernable to the audience was his attempt at getting away from his own personality rather than the portrayal of an astute liar. As competent as Dyle was in his clandestine occupation, Wahlberg should felt secure enough to be able to just let loose and simply enjoy a chance encounter with a lovely young woman during one of Dyle's typical assignments.)
Bottom Line:  As this is supposed to be a suspense film, this movie fails--it just isn't particularly suspenseful--there are no adrenaline pumping moments--it does not keep you on the edge of your seat biting your nails; there really is no villan despite all the fingerpointing--I actually liked all the characterizations, villans included--except Wahlberg's---as I believe I was meant to---except for the marvelous setting, this film feels more like a play with a troop of fun actors who obviously loved camping it up in Paris doing an updated version of the classic 'Charade'.",1035936000,2,3510,5.214920071047957
1477882,1,B00005JLIF,"Okay, a lot of reviewers are praising ""The Truth About Charlie"" for NOT imitating the original movie it's based on, ""Charade"". As much as I enjoyed the earlier film, I was okay with the fact that there were going to be some extreme differences between the two versions.  This was my state of mind as I walked into the theater.
But by any measure, ""The Truth About Charlie"" is that it is simply an AWFUL travesty.  One cannot help but recall Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant while watching the dull, amateurish Thandie Newton and Mark Wahlbeg walk through playing the same roles.  There's no intention behind their delivery, neither one of them are even able to at least project their own personalities, and Wahlberg is so particularly inadequate as an actor, he makes Keannu Reaves look like Sir Lawrence Olivier.
What could have caused director Jonathan Demme to slide so far down from the skills he showed in ""The Silence of the Lambs""?  He hasn't made a coherent film since then.  I was at least hoping to enjoy the Paris scenery in ""Charlie"", but with the claustrophobic, hand-held camera work, they might just as well have been on location in someone's backyard. The audience was sparse at the fiasco showing I attended, and it grew even more paltry as people discovered they had something better to do and walked out.  I, however, stayed til the bitter, pathetic end.",1035590400,5,1370,4.735294117647059
1477883,1,B00005JLIF,"What was the director Jonathan Demme thinking?  The original ""Charade"" (with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn) was ten-times more entertaining than this boring thriller wanna-be.
""Charade"" itself was far from being a flawless movie, but at least it got several things right.  The dialogue was funny with a good dose of wit, and, more importantly, it didn't give away plot twists before they occurred.  The dialogue in ""The Truth About Charlie"" (""Truth"" hereafter, for the brevity's sake) wasn't nearly as half as funny -- which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, if what the director wanted was something of a darker thriller.  Unfortunately, ""Truth"" hardly has any surprising plot twists to qualify as a thriller either.  Well, there ARE plot twists, but most are presented in such a predictable manner that no one is really caught off-guard.  (My cousin, who had not watched ""Charade"" before, thought ""Truth"" was very predictable)  It's a big shame that ""Truth"" horribly fails where ""Charade"" splendidly succeeded.  Even the wonderful comedic twist at the end of ""Charade"" has completely disappeared in ""Truth.""
My guess is that the director Jonathan Demme wanted to transform the comedic ""Charade"" into a darker thriller where the line between good and evil is not as clear-cut.  Noble intention, I'd say.  Unfortunately, I think Demme was working with a wrong material for what he wanted.  At times, it even appeared that Demme himself was confused about whether he wanted a straight-forward light comedy or a more convoluted dark humor for the laughs.  And the end result is a movie that doesn't really succeed at anything it sets out to do.
My recommendation?  Watch ""Charade"" to know all the fun and the plot twists.  Then watch ""Truth"" to see how NOT to make a remake.
(A note to Korean fans: Park Joong-Hoon gets a good deal of screen time, which is good.  However, he is at his best with a more sly comedic stuff, and I feel that Demme's direction didn't really allow Park to shine in his mainstream American debut.  If the movie was lighter in tone, like ""Charade,"" I bet Park would have been captivating.  What a shame.)",1035590400,4,2131,4.907821229050279
1477884,1,B00005JLIF,"The Truth About Charlie is a remake of 1963's Charade, starring Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant.  Charade isn't a masterpiece, but it's a fun lark of a movie, with the captivating chemistry of its two stars and a witty script by Peter Stone its main assets.
Unfortunately, even if The Truth About Charlie weren't a remake of a well-remembered classic, it would still be a truly awful film.  Apparently, the cinematographer forgot his tripod, cuz the camera shakes and quivers in his arms as he swirls around the two leads--Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton, who have zero chemistry and not a single witty line to deliver--making this flick the first movie in a long time that made me bolt the theater in revulsion.

1478261,1,B00005JLIF,"One of those films that left me scratching my head, `The Truth About Charlie' isn't so much confusing as it is bewilderingly dull.  The film fails to do much of anything.  It isn't fun, it isn't sexy, it isn't witty, it isn't charming...it just isn't.  The action is problematic in that it doesn't do anything we haven't already seen countless times before, and the chemistry between the two stars is borderline non-existent.  I haven't seen the original yet (although I will one day, considering my Hepburn adoration) and so I cannot compare, but I hope it has more substance and style than this one.  The plot just hangs there here, and the way it is strung along doesn't draw the audience in.  I expected more from Demme, who has proven himself a capable director...and then again, he has also proven himself inconsistent.  This is probably the worst thing he's ever done, and when you consider that it's one of the worst films of the past decade then it really says a lot for Demme's taste level.  Clich ridden and uninspired throughout, the truth about this movie is that it's bad.",1318291200,6,1086,4.678947368421053
1478262,2,B00005JLIF,"Jonathan Demme was apparently hit by two ambitions at the same time; to remake a classic comic-mystery thriller, ""Charade"" (1963) and to add to it his mini-homage to auteur-artsy filmmaking. In both endeavors he fall flat.

The original, while not exactly brilliant, is a classic and and perennial favorite among film lovers. ""Charade"" moved along effortlessly because of the undeniably perfect ingredients: BIG TIME beloved stars (Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn) with chemistry? check. Decent story with an effective screenplay (Peter Stone)? check. Capable direction (Stanley Donen) making full use of its location filming? check. It's basically pulp entertainment, but it's stylish, engaging fun.

Actually, Demme does at least make some good use of the location filming- it would take active, conscious effort to blow this aspect if you're filming in Paris. And he has the advantage of having a leading lady who could withstand comparisons to Hepburn. Thandie Newton is ultimately the best thing about this film, demure, polished, elegant and effective. Unfortunately, a star can only carry a lousy film so far. And this, alas, is a lousy film.

While a considerable amount of the original plot was retained, regrettably most of the screenplay was not. Much of the dialogue has this inherent fraudulence about it. The actors never seem authentic in their roles. Whalberg is the biggest offender here. He's putting forth tremendous effort, but while it's unfair to compare him to Cary Grant, he seems so hopelessly out of place it's extremely hard to watch him at times. The role was originally written as an older man; they would've needed the charm and gravitas of a George Clooney (virtually the only actor out there who can get compared to Grant and emerge relatively unscathed) to make this whole thing palatable. Tim Robbins in the Walter Matthau role is another one that's hard to take, for different reasons; he's hamming it up. No one could mistaken Matthau's approach for subtlety, but Robbins is no Walter Matthau. As a result, the principals are working with these celluloid ghosts hanging over them and, with the flaws of the screenplay, suffering by comparison. Again, Newton is the least offender, because she's not showing the sweat Whalberg shows, or the tough-to-swallow obviousness of Robbins. She glides through capably. Such a shame that everything around her is sinking so fast.

Characters who do nothing to improve things are added to the original story. The heavies here are no match for the likes of James Coburn and George Kennedy, who were both legitimately creepy in the original. And Demme unfortunately saw this as a perfect opportunity to pay tribute to New Wave classics like Truffauts' ""Shoot the Piano Player"". It tugs the film in a different direction and makes it harder for the audience to engage in the proceedings (something the cast and screenplay are already making a chore).

""The Truth About Charlie"" may play somewhat better to a viewer who has never seen the original, but Universal shot themselves in the foot by including ""Charade"" as a bonus feature on the disc.

Many DVD editions of ""Charade"" have been released, and to judge by the numerous reviews on this site, most of these previous releases have very poor video transfers to DVD.

The version of ""Charade"" presented on the flip side of ""The Truth about Charlie"" is, however, quite good--surprisingly good!  ""Charade"", starring Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, is presented here in a clean, anamorphic widescreen format, enhanced for 16x9 aspect-ratio, large-screen TVs. The colors are excellent, great skin tones, and the mono sound is fine, considering the age of the film.  There is little (if any) graininess, even in the night scences (the blacks are very deep).

The Criterion Collection sells a very expensive, remastered version of ""Charade"" (I have not seen it)--but, in my opinion, there is very little room for additional enhancement of the version included here--especially considering the big price difference. ""Charade"" looks simply terrific on my large screen,  high-defintion TV, played on my Toshiba HD DVD player (the ""upconversion"" helps).

1478447,3,B00005JLIF,"Why? Why remake a glorious old movie like ""Charade,"" which was perfect anyway?

Well, whatever Jonathan Demme's motive is, he didn't do a very good job. ""The Truth about Charlie"" is a disaster as a remake, and it's not much better even when taken on its own terms -- it lumbers clumsily through a humorless, standard plot, with a love story is so passionate you could chill drinks on it. The only reason to buy this: the original movie.

Regina (Thandie Newton) is planning to divorce husband Charlie, and makes up her mind on vacation. No sooner has she returned than she finds that she doesn't need to bother -- Charlie's been murdered, and their money has mysteriously vanished. As if that weren't bad enough, some creepy people are following her around, apparently looking for the money.

The problem is, Reggie isn't sure who she can trust -- including a strange man (Mark Wahlberg) who may or may not be an enemy. But she may have to trust him, to solve the question of who Charlie really was, and the question of where the money has gone. If she doesn't find it, she may be next to die...

This edition of Demme's remake is bundled (as bad movies often are) with a better one. On the flip side of the disc is the original ""Charade."" It has about the same plot as the remake, but with Audrey Hepburn as Regina and Cary Grant as her mystery man. There are a lot of rotten copies floating around, but the color and sound have been beautifully restored in this version.

But how does Demme's remake stand up on its own? Not very well. Paris looks creepy, seedy and dark. The script is a paint-by-numbers thriller, without a scrap of wit or intelligence anywhere. Demme is obviously unsure how to bring this to life, so he ends up with an unsubtle, unsexy, unappealing mess.

It's even worse when you compare it to the original flick. Stanlet Donen directed a tight, sharp little movie that could be terrifying (Hepburn encounters a clawed killer who tries to slash her face off), and suddenly switch to goofy screwball humour, like the hysterical scene where Grant takes a shower in all his clothes, much to Hepburn's delight.

Even worse, Newton and Wahlberg have zero chemistry. Newton smirks, pouts and tries to look sophisticated, while Wahlberg tries to be cool and sexy, and only comes across as smarmy. Hepburn and Grant have everything the other two don't: chemistry, sexiness, and a scene where they chase a kiss around an orange.

The only reason to buy ""The Truth about Charlie"" is to get the flipside, which is the only affordable, restored version of ""Charade."" The remake itself is a self-important disaster.",1145145600,5,2625,4.666666666666667

I think many people who reviewed this film are used to the formulaic Hollywood movies that repeat similar patterns of familiarity.  What made this film work was its diversity of characters and music, as well as its unique direction.

Overall, it seems that people are intent to compare this movie to Charade, which it is loosely based on.  It seems that the director wanted to take this in a very different direction, which is fun and admirable.  It definitely doesn't try to take itself as seriously as others may have tried to interpret it.  I always had the feeling they wanted it to be light and funny with a romantic twist.

Inspired by the Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn CHARADE, CHARLIE never really kicks into gear and the performances are all pretty mundane and uninspired.  Thandie Newton rolls her eyes and smirks a lot; Mark Wahlberg seems completely out of place and disinterested; and Tim Robbins might as well wear a flag saying DON'T TRUST ME.  Add the cameos by Charles Aznavour which come out of the blue completely, a dizzying music video direction style by Demme and a slow, tedious plot and you end up with CHARLIE.

1478451,3,B00005JLIF,"Recently married Regina Lambert (Thandie Newton) returns to her home in Paris to find that her husband Charlie has been murdered and their apartment emptied of its contents in ""The Truth About Charlie"", a loose remake of the 1963 film ""Charade"". Regina soon learns that her husband was not who she thought and that he was in possession of a great deal of money that a lot of people would like to claim...and they all believe that she must have it. Three thuggish former comrades of Charlie's harass her. A man claiming to work for the super-secret Office of Defense Cooperation (Tim Robbins) says that the money belongs to the US government. Commandant Dominique (Christine Boisson), the police detective assigned to Charlie's murder investigation, believes the money will lead to the killer. And a kind and mysterious stranger named Joshua Peters (Mark Wahlberg) seems to always turn up when Regina is in need. Regina is thrust into a maelstrom of secrets and deception from her husband's past. She must navigate this colorful and dangerous cast of characters while she tries to find that money and get everyone off of her back.

""The Truth About Charlie"" is a bumpy mixture of good, bad, and mediocre filmmaking. It showcases Thandie Newton's charisma well. The performances of Christine Boisson and Lisa Gay Hamilton, as one of Charlie's former comrades, are also worth a look. The rest of the cast is simply adequate. ""The Truth About Charlie"" takes on a distinctly New Wave style in some scenes -but not throughout. A very contrived and funny tango sequence would never appear in an American film, but is quintessentially French, as is the movie's ending. French singer Charles Aznavour is dropped, singing, into a few scenes too, in very Southern European fashion. It looks like there was a conscious attempt on the part of director Jonathan Demme to make a sort of hybrid French-American style. This injects some stylistic vitality at times, but lends a patent inconsistency to the film more than anything. Nevertheless, ""The Truth About Charlie"" is a generally entertaining thriller with some captivating ingredients and a few fine performances, and it is enjoyable on that basis.",1123459200,,2188,5.027548209366391
1478452,2,B00005JLIF,"I saw the original Charade when I was in high school and was mesmerized by the relationship between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant. At that time, in 1963, New Wave cinema was in vogue and while I tried with movies like ""Jules and Jim"" and ""It's my life"", I do like the more classical style like Charade. It had an all star cast, with the Walter Matthau, James Coburns and the best goon, George Kennedy, who played the man with a hook for a hand. It was a lightweight farce that did not take itself too seriously, except maybe for the last 5 mintues of the movie and reflected the carefree attitude of a brit living in Paris.

When Universal pictures heard of a this remake of Charade, they must have been drooling. It was going to be directed by Jonathan Demme, the gifted director of both Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia. Universal would also be happy with getting Mark Wahlberg and Tim Robbins for the role, but Demme probably had to convince the talking heads of using Thandie Newton, who Demme had directed in Beloved. However, Thandie looks and does justice to the role of Regina Lampert.

Regina Lampert is married to Charles, a roguish fellow who is killed on a train. Regina finds out that Charles was involved in the theft of $6 million dollars worth of gems and his former partners are out for their share, which never came about. She has no idea that she has the gems or the money, but she does have it on her and the charming Joshua Peters comes into her life, at first to protect her, but soon it seems that he may be apart of the problem.

Like I said before, Thandie does justice to the role, playing Regina as a very vulnerable but feisty British woman. She is always in the state of confusion as different sides play her to get to the money, but she is always sympathetic to the audience. However, her love interest Wahlberg falls flat on his face.

Let me ask you this, can you see Wahlberg doing a Cary Grant impersonation? I can't and he does not nothing to convince me that he can play a charming, yet controlling character. He has limited emotional appeal and he does not have the dry, slight self-deprecating humour that Cary Grant brought to the role. If I were Regina, I would constantly be scared of Wahlberg consistently showing up to places that he should not be at. He acts like the stalker in his 1994 movie Fear.

The 3 muskateers that are out to get their money back do little better. Ted Levine, who played the uber creep ""Buffalo Bill"" in Silence of the Lambs plays his usual southern gothic weirdo. Lisa Gay Hamilton is a little better as the militant Lola and Joon Hoon Park, famous in his native Korea as a comedic actor, uncomfortably struggles with the concept of speaking English as Lee.

Demme does a little better. He seems wanting to merge the New Wave filmmaking with his classic story, so we get faded images, grimy hotel locations and no steadicam. I expected more from master cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (who is a legend with movies like Signs, The Sixth sense, Silence of the Lambs and Gladiator under his belt) but instead we get a shaky lens and camera tricks that undermines the whole movie.

I think that more thought was needed for this movie and Universal only saw a quick buck. With a better cast and a different approach to directing, this could have been a fun romp with a mix of suspense...but in it's current form, it is a jumbled mess....Rating: C-",1120694400,2,3414,4.48792270531401

They have also lost a lot of charm, wit, and intelligence.  The plot of Charade was hard to follow, but I still have no idea what happened in The Truth about Charlie - and I'd seen the original.  The craft of screenwriting was declined notably over the years: dialogue has gotten bad and plots have become incomprehensible.  I will not pick on Mark Wahlberg for not being Cary Grant - that's too cheap.  The cast in this film is YOUNGER - apparently because one must be young to be a film star in this day and age.

He gets top billing and is probably the only reason this Jonathan Demme project got the green light, but no doubt about it Thandie Newton and the incomparable soundtrack are the real stars here. Newton, last seen as Tom Cruise's main squeeze in ""Mission Impossible 2"" is everthing someone in the Audrey Hepburn role should be: frail, beautiful, flawless complexion, a damsel in distress in need of saving. Enter Markie Mark and a bunch of other unsavory characters who want to know where here dead husband Charlie's stolen 6 million in diamonds are. Demme is a talented filmmaker, and he tries some new things here, stepping outside the box, going beyond the third wall of filmmaking, but this movie is nothing more than a little chocolate truffle, made to melt in your mouth immediately with no lingering thoughts. Tim Robbins is a waste in a menacing supporting role. But as I said, the other star is the brilliant soundtrack. Demme uses the music of Paris wonderfully, casting the mood of the City of Lights with every measure.

The truth about ""The Truth About Charlie"" is that it is a terrible movie.  The original ""Charade"" was delightful because it successfully combined mystery and suspense with humor, was tight and well-paced, and featured a charismatic and talented cast, including Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant, and Walter Matthau. ""The Truth About Charlie"" has a rambling script in the French New Wave tradition, a pointless overabundance of hand-held camera shots that could give anyone a royal headache, and overall less-than- inspiring performances, although I don't blame the actors one bit.  The blame rests completely on the head of director Jonathan Demme, who seems to have lost both his mind and his taste. Tim Robbins probably gives the worst, most wooden performance of an otherwise illustrious career by doing a bizarre ""Joe Friday"" imitation of an alleged U.S. government official. The chemistry between stars Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton is non-existent.  Ms. Newton has been quite good in other movies I've seen her in, particularly in Demme's own movie, ""Beloved,"" as well as in ""Jefferson in Paris."" In ""Charlie"" she's not particularly interesting, possibly because the character she plays is rather tediously written.  Wahlberg has proven that he can be a fine actor in the right vehicle, but he is bland and unconvincing in this part. The movie's humor is practically non-existent. Ditto the suspense.  But then, when one cares so little about the major characters, one spends more time checking one's watch than trembling with anticipation. However, it was nice to see Charles Aznavour perform (although I would rather have seen him perform in someone else's film, for he had no logical reason for showing up in this one). Also nice is that the DVD's flipside offers an excellent copy of ""Charade"" and except for the expensive Criterion DVD, every other copy ranges from passable to mediocre.

Are the major studios so bereft of talent they can't come up with something original without desecrating a classic like Charade? For every Cape Fear, which actually improved upon the original film, there are loads of Psychos, Planet of the Apes (stop making remakes Mark Wahlberg!), Last Man Standings (a remake of TWO superior films, Yojimbo and A Fistful of Dollars) and Sabrinas (Julia Ormond, one of the least charismatic actresses of all time trying to fill Audrey Hepburn's shoes). The mere presence of Cary Grant AND Audrey Hepburn in the original alone should have prevented this junk from being made.
Jonathan Demme, the director of the great Silence of the Lambs, attempts to put a modern edge on the original story by Peter Stone. Much of the action is filmed by a hand held camera with jerky non-precision that gave me a headache watching it. I understand that a director of a remake has to put his own spin on the original story. However, Demme has leeched all of the beauty out of Paris (The City of Lights looks more like a Eastern European city during the Soviet era rather than the Paris depicted in Charade). He has sapped the charm out of the story, trying to make it more serious in tone, but just succeeds in making it boring. And, worst of all, he has replaced Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn with actors who have no business assuming these roles.
To be fair, absolutely no one can fill Grant and Hepburn's shoes. But Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton bomb miserably in the roles. The chemistry in Charade between the two leads crackled. The chemistry between Wahlberg and Netwon is non-existent. The two leads have none of the charm and spark of their predecessors in the roles and are horrible casting choices for these roles.
Jonathan Demme recently completely a remake of the Frank Sinatra classic The Manchurian Candidate. I certainly hope, for his sake, that he did a much better job with that film. If he keeps making duds like this one, anyone who sees Silence of the Lambs will view Demme as a potentially great director who frittered his career away making stupid and pointless remakes.
(I would have given this DVD one star, but the presence of the complete film of Charade as one the extras warrants another star for the release)

1478677,4,B00005JLIF,"Can't we give this movie a little credit?  It has merit of it's own without being compared to Charade.  Truthfully I'd give The Truth About Charlie 3 1/2 stars.  It is a good movie with a good plot (taken from Charade), interesting characters, suspense, and romance.  The filming was original with unique camera angles and some choppy editing but if you like Mulon Rouge's editing you won't mind this.  The romance is more believable than the one weakly developed in Charade and the plot is more understandable than it was in the original.  This movie will appeal to people the original will never reach because some people simply aren't into old movies.  The main characters had great chemistry- Walburg is handsome (not gorgeous) and the woman is ravishingly beautiful and I enjoyed seeing her give a serious twist to an sillier Hepburn character.  She has that grace that Audrey had as well.  Charade I have to give at least 4 stars to because it's two of the greatest actors of all time (who as a bonus are both gorgeous) and is much funnier than the remake (though the remake did some things better).",1077926400,5,1105,4.683937823834197
1478678,2,B00005JLIF,"Now let's forget it.  I mean not this film, but the fact that ""The Truth about Charlie"" is a remake of Stanley Donen classic ""Charade.""  We know there is no way of replacing the two elegant leads of the original, and Jonathan Demme also knows that.  The truth about ""The Truth about Charlie"" is that the ""remake"" looks more like a homage to French cinema, as I explain later.
The story is fundamentally the same.  Thandie Newton's Regina, whose newly-wed ""Charlie"" is killed on the train, finds that her late husband didn't reveal the real identity of him.  Many suspicious people show up around her, apparently looking for something she does not know.  And one of them is Joshua Peters, played by Mark Wahlberg, who keeps on appearing exactly at the right moment she needs him.  But can she really trust him?  And there is another man Tim Robbins who gives some tips, but can she trust them?
But you will never find what you want if you wish to see suspence, wit, or whatever you found attractive in the original film.  Jonathan Demme is more interested in making the whole film look as if a product of the 1960s French New Wave Cinema, using shaky hand-held camera, shooting from a peculiar angle, or showing the techniques such as jump-cut.  The film also is filled with some oddball humor (see the ending in which he parodies one of his own films in the past).
The dead giveaway is the inclusion of Anna Karina (ex-wife of Jean Luc Godard), one of the muses of the New Wave movement.  And when you hear her song ""Sous le soleil Exactment"" in a Paris taxi, Demme's intention becomes too clear to be ignored.  The film looks as if Jonathan Demme respects not so much Stanley Donen as Godard or other French cinema directors.  That's why you see the cameo of Agnes Varda, too.
But the point is ... can you do that with ""Charade""?  With a big Universal logo?  It is not what we (I mean, we in general) expect to see.  If the audicences hate this remake, and blame the director for making such liberty of messing around, that is only natural.
What I find more irritating is not Demme's idea; it's actors.  Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton has no presence, and the couple show nothing remarkable -- no charisma, no chemistry, no humor, nothing, especially Ms. Newton's acting is so awful (""overacting"" is a kind word here) that I started to think that was all intentional.  And you see one of Tim Robbins' worst turns.  Actually he only stands and delivers creaky dialogues as if he is a cyborg.  You see no Tim Robbins of ""Mystic River.""  I Hope this Tim is his understudy or stand-in.
""The Truth about Charlie"" is just another instance of how not to remake a film, especially when the original is a beloved one, whatever laudable intention you got.  You just can't do that.",1076716800,6,2773,4.537223340040241
1478679,1,B00005JLIF,Ouch!  I watched this without knowing it was a remake.  After about 20 minutes I could see a thin plot of Charade popping out.  This film was a bore and really annoyed me.  I kept wanting Cary Grant or someone nearly as good looking to come on the screen.  Mark Wahlberg was a bore and lacked the romance/grace of Cary Grant.  Some movies should never be remade.  I love Charade.  It would have been good to know it was a remake.  I only watched it to the end to see how badly  they could butcher Charade.,1076371200,2,505,4.166666666666667
1478680,1,B00005JLIF,"Wow. What an awful film. I saw this for sale in the bargain bin (along with Bend it like Beckham, which is a great movie, so didn't want to condemn Truth About Charlie based on its price alone). I didn't have to. There are plenty of other reasons to hate it.
I personally never saw the original movie CHARADE (which 'Charlie' is remaking), so I had about as open a mind as possible when viewing this. Also, because I live in Europe, the DVD copy I bought did not include CHARADE like its American Region 1 counterpart, so I can't compare the two films like other reviewers. I can only warn you how bad 'Charlie' is.
As a rule, I don't usually write the plot summaries to movies when I review them. In the case of 'Charlie' however, I couldn't even if I wanted to. The plot just made no sense.
The ACTORS: I like Thandie Newton, but she mimics the audience's own confused reaction so often and accurately, that when she starts to act like she knows what's going on, we feel betrayed, because we know she couldn't possibly have made sense of this mess of a film before us. Mark Wahlberg is really not that bad an actor, but he's so fake in this role, and Tim Robbins is even more hammy. Add in Lisa Gay Hamilton (formerly of TV's The Practice), some french actors, hey, even Ted Levine (who plays Buffalo Bill in Demme's Silence Of The Lambs) appears for a few scenes. Steven Dillane - who was excellent in SPY GAME - is Charlie, even though we only get to hear his good French accent for all of 30 seconds in the beginning of the film, and subsequently only see him in corny flashbacks as the film progresses. What a waste of acting talent.
The MUSIC: Sound and music affect moods in movies a lot more than people realise. This film is a prime example where the music undermines the potential for suspense. It sounds like composer Rachel Portman basically just collected a bunch of songs from some sad sampler CD and inserted them randomly. Music starts and stops at really odd times, like some cheasy no-name tune will be playing in the background and then suddenly stop when a character hangs up the phone, other times elevator muzak accompanies Newton when she is running frantically through the streets of Paris. If the music IS ever any good, it's so deliberate, that it become's too much of a character in its own right, which isn't what movie scores normally are supposed to do - unless of course, it's for a Quentin Tarantino film.
The FILM: The editing is weird. The camera jiggles constantly. There are way too many close-ups of the actor's faces. The flashbacks have this totally low-budget handycam look to them. Everyone chases Newton in the film, and it's only after an hour of DVD running time has passed that she decides to take a closer look at the contents of the bag that all the bad guys are desperate to peek into. Everyone is a potential traitor (a very cheap and tired method for a script to allow for plot twists). There is no comedy. No believable romance. No sex. No action. No drama. And most of all - thanks to the shaky camera and crappy elevator music - there's no suspense whatsoever either. Man, just check out that final showdown scene in the rain with all the pathetic close-ups, does any one give a hairy rat's butt what happens?",1076112000,4,3263,4.467336683417085

Accept this as a wonderfully dynamic, visually stimulating film that stands on it's own.  I was thoroughly enthralled, straining to catch every twist, and nuance.

1478685,1,B00005JLIF,"This movie was an utter travesty. It took the original Charade, which was a very good movie starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, and turned into something awful.
First off, Mark Wahlburg. I have seen much better acting in community theater. Seriously, I've had things emerge from my nose with more talent than this unbelievably bad excuse for an actor. He's about as deadpan as a human can get without actually going comatose. He has all the charisma of a fencepost, and as a result, his relationship with Thandie Newton is really unbelievable. Of course, that's just one of many reasons.
The screenwriter of this movie took the original Charade and removed anything original and exciting from it. The characters are remarkably inconsistant and unbelievable. They bounce around from liking each other to not liking each other, trusting each other to not trusting each other and vice versa, and we have absolutely no idea why. I'm pretty sure the writer didn't either. The plot is vaguely interesting, something that actually carried over from the original. The movie also includes some topless scenes, but they serve no purpose. I guess they were tossed in to keep people from getting bored, but it didn't work. This movie is a testament to the fact that there are very few good screenwriters left in Hollywood.
The director was in idiot. He spices up Paris with lots of colored lighting, but it really does nothing for the viewer. He also uses lots of panning and close-ups, and it comes off as confusing and claustrophobic. It's jerky as well, like an old camcorder held by an 8 year old with ADD. It does nothing for the story and winds up making the viewer sick.
This movie is a lot like NASCAR. There's very little excitement. It just goes around and around but never gets anywhere. When the end finally comes, it's anticlimactic as can be and you're glad that it's over. We don't care what happens to the characters, and the pathetic twists are lame and easy to spot. The pacing stinks like a skunk smashed on the highway. It will go unbearably slow for a while, then zip through a scene or two. How did the director ever land this job? The guy probably has trouble getting food to his mouth, much less directing a movie.
Don't rent this movie. Don't watch it if a friend rents it. There are much better things you can do with your time, like staring at the wall or, yes, even watching NASCAR.",1059436800,7,2402,4.6674528301886795

1478755,1,B00005JLIF,"I really wanted to like this movie. Johnathan Demme is one of my favorite film makers and I thought if anyone could remake one of my favorite movies of all time, Demme could. Demme couldn't.
Newton and Robbins are ok, Wahlberg doesn't work at all, and the other ""evil"" characters who were so memorable in Charade come across as interchangeable cyphers.
I usually like Demme's music selection, but here there didn't seem to be any sort of unifying theme behind his music. And, it certainly wasn't Mancini's wonderful score.
But the biggest Truth about Charlie is that Demme's rewrite is simply awful.
In the original, Charlie is a nobody and so he doesn't get in the way of all the other characters. Here he has a face and is, apparently, the big villain, so we have to be treated to a slew of foggy flashbacks that halt the flow of the story.
Newton and Wahlberg lip-lock so early, there's absolutely none of the playful sexual tension of the original. And, instead of Grant's cocky, end-of-the-film surprise, we get a bathetic Wahlberg begging Newton to forgive him. Bleacch.
The reworking of the story that sets everything in motion is so muddled I'm still not sure just exactly what was happening and why.
And the final big thing missing is the element of wonderful surprise Donen crafted so well. In the original Grant's multiple characters are peeled back with delicious surprise at each new revelation ending with the final, perfect surprise at the end of the film. And the moment when the original film reveals the big secret is still thrilling, even after watching it a dozen times. In Charlie, the big secret becomes a tiny flicker of something in Newton's eyes and when it is finally revealed, it's a moment that the word ""anticlimax"" was designed for.
It's such a shame that Demme made such a muddle of something that originally was so clean and clearly presented. As so many others have done, I strongly recommend you skip this one and just go back to the original.",1053561600,2,1977,4.716763005780347

 I was hesitant to see this film because I thought a remake would be blasphemous. Then I head that Peter Stone, who wrote the original, had a hand in writing the remake so I decided to give it a shot. What a mess! I think Audrey Hepburn, Cary Grant and Walter Matthau had turned over in their graves; if they were still alive, this movie would have killed them.
 Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton have no chemistry. I won't compare them to Hepburn and Grant simply because no one will ever replace either one of them. The plot twists make no sense and what was the deal with her being friendly with the people wanting the money?! Exactly how am I supposed to believe that she is in danger if they are all hanging out and going dancing together.
 There were characters added that weren't necessary and Jonathan Demme used the camera like a kid who'd just gotten his first one for Christmas. It was annoying. Am I the only one who got dizzy?

1478761,2,B00005JLIF,"In the grand tradition of remakes, The Truth about Charlie is a butchered, poor imitation of the original.  However, I have to give credit to director Jonathan Demme for butchering Charade with such gusto...I just wish he had gone even further.  Let me explain.
I applaud Demme for attempting to modernize both the movie and its location, Paris.  He obviously made a concerted effort to show diversity by featuring an international cast and using less elite locations, thereby showing Parisians from different walks of life.  I wholeheartedly commend his motivation to show a more realistic view of the world rather than the whitewashed version prevalent in most mainstream movies.  However, I think Demme erred in that he couldn't decide whether he wanted to update Charade completely, in terms of story and style, or keep it faithful to the original.  The result is a jumbled mish-mash of Charade minus the lightness and humor, plus frenetic camera work.  The Truth about Charlie takes itself too seriously as a thriller, which, as anyone who's seen Charade knows, was hardly the intention of the original.  The plot - dead husband, missing money, mysterious acquaintances - isn't thick enough to be a straight serious thriller and by doing so, Demme seriously weakens The Truth about Charlie.  The audience also misses out on the playful cat-and-mouse that was evident between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant; Thandie Newton and Mark Wahlberg don't really get a chance to showcase whatever chemistry they may have brought to the roles.
However, since Charade is one of my favorite movies and I was incredibly biased going into Charlie, I made my roommate who had never seen Charade watch Charlie.  (She had also never seen a Cary Grant movie - I know, what rock has she been hiding under - so there was no basis for comparison with Wahlberg.)  She liked the movie but was confused at parts.  Demme at times uses scenes from Charade but fails to set up the scene properly, which pokes holes in the plot.  She rates the movie a 3-4 - for those viewers who want an unbiased view and happen to like Wahlberg.  One thing we did agree on was that Marky Mark should not wear a beret or formal hat...ever. :)
To sum up, Charade fans should probably stay away from Charlie as comparison and disappoint are inevitable.  For those who haven't seen the original, Charlie will likely provide mild entertainment...until you turn the disc over and watch the original and realize why they had to entice people with 2 movies for the price of one.

I should like to point out that Walberg has done some good work outside of this film but he shouldn't have been cast as the suave man-about-town.  That, he knows absolutely nothing about!
Thandie Newton is equally an ill fit to Regina, so luminously filled out by Audrey Hepburn. Her take on the lead is childish, not child-like, and insulant instead of independent. Tim Robbins takes over the role of the CIA man from Walter Matthau in the original but doesn't bring anything fresh to his characterization.
Seeing this movie will make you pine for ""Charade"" and here, I would like to add something about Jonathan Demme's work - it's full of edgy cutting and awkward disolves that work against the material - in short, trying to create a ""Silence of the Lambs"" feel for a movie that should be more about romance and mystery than death and oddities. The Paris of Demme's creation is not a city I'd like to visit.  ""Charade""'s is!
NOW: ABOUT THE TRANSFER: ""Charlie"" is presented in its original 2:35:1 aspect ratio, enhanced for 16X9 televisions.  Colors are well balanced though desaturated - as the film maker intended.  Demme's use of color filters in certain sequences is unimpressive but well represented on this disc.  However, there is some aliasing and shimmering of fine details and a considerable amount of edge enhancement present throughout.  The 5.1 sound mix is well presented and for the most part, well balanced.
CHARADE: Presented in its original 1:85:1 aspect ratio and enhanced for 16X9 televisions (a first! - not even the Criterion edition did this).  Here I shall draw back a moment to mention Criterion's previously issued DVD of ""Charade"".  In that version, colors were rich, bold and vibrant.  On this new incarnation color remains balanced though somewhat desaturated.  Where the previous disc presented a razor sharp image throughout, this version is considerably softer, though still well within a presentable clarity level. But this version of ""Charade"" surpasses its predicessor in one major aspect of its visual presentation - in its virtually edge enhancement and shimmering/aliasing problems-FREE, smooth visual presentation.  The Criterion version was notoriously marred by these digital anomolies that caused background detail to be very unstable in certain scenes such as during Regina's initial visit to her ransacked apartment and the funeral scene, where candle sticks shook as though they had been made of water instead of wax.  Though, as I have said before, colors in this version of ""Charade"" are somewhat desaturated (comparing them directly with Criterion's edition)the resulting absence of such annoying digital glitches make this the preferred version of this classic film.
BOTTOM LINE: My recommendation is that you buy this disc for ""Charade"" and forget about the other movie included herein, because the real ""Truth About Charlie"" is that it should have never been made!",1049328000,3,4349,5.1114245416078985
1478842,2,B00005JLIF,"And that is where the Stars end!! This movie was beyond AWFUL. Can anyone please tell me why Marky Mark continues to get movie roles???? I happen to be a HUGE Cary Grant fan and so it is possible that I was never going to like it in the first place. Thandie Newton tried her best to pull this movie through at least she was one of the performers I was convinced with. Mark Wahlberg, Tim Robbins and the Rasta character (just to name a few) were so vacant in this movie. I wish that they would not have even mentioned the movie name {Charade} it is a insulting comparison.
The premise of this movie folllows the review below accept for you will find yourself asking a number of questions that weren't explained or never made sense in the first place. Do yourself a favor and rent Charade 1st so that you can understand what the plot was supposed to LOOK and FEEL like. Oh and another thing that kept me irrated Mark Wahlberg facial expressions and delivery of lines :^O they were painful to watch and I found myself laughing out loud at his efforts. I would not recommend purchasing this DVD I would recommend renting it first ...",1049241600,,1129,4.380952380952381
1478843,2,B00005JLIF,"This DVD which features Jonathan Demme's ""The Truth About Charlie"" and its inspiration, Stanley Donen's 1963 film ""Charade"", will give you ample opportunity to compare and contrast the two films. Comparisons are inevitable, as is the case with remakes. As a fan of Donen's film, I was unable to seperate ""The Truth About Charlie"" in my mind from the original film. I kept thinking ""Mark Wahlberg is no Cary Grant"". That's probably a reaction that many will have. Fortunately, however, Thandie Newton is closer to Audrey Hepburn than Wahlberg is to Grant. Still quite a distance, though.
Jonathan Demme, Oscar-winning director of The Silence of the Lambs, took Peter Stone's story and removed every bit of the humor and wit that make ""Charade"" such a charming film. What's left is a straight-forward thriller that rarely thrills. The movie focuses entirely on the plot, the identity of Charlie's killer and the location of the MacGuffin (the money). ""Charade"" was a special movie because it dabbled in Hitchcock's territory, but glided effortlessly between comedy and suspense. There was real chemistry between Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, but here Wahlberg and Newton just seem to be going through the motions. Walter Matthau's Bartholomew was one of the most humorous characters in ""Charade"", but here Tim Robbins (in the Matthau role) plays it straight and rather dull.
Someone who has never seen the original might find enjoyment in ""The Truth About Charlie"", if they can buy into the Wahlberg-Newton romance (which I did not) and look past the sometimes stale acting and gimmicky camera work. However, I think most people will find the original movie to be a far more enjoyable and rewarding experience. This DVD contains a director commentary by Jonathan Demme, so perhaps he explains his motivation to remake the film. Knowing that Demme has done such great things in the past, ""The Truth About Charlie"" is a bit bewildering. Those who buy this DVD will probably find the ""Charade"" side being viewed a lot more than the ""Charlie"" side.",1048982400,14,2043,5.047337278106509
1478844,2,B00005JLIF,"a very disappointing movie.  We all know Demme can better than this. Tim Robbins: becomes ridiculous, Thandie Newton: still trying, Lisa Gay Hamilton: doesn't make sense, Mark Wahlberg: miscasting, Joong-Hoon Park: OK but suddenly becomes Jason, Christine Boisson: ???.  Sometimes remakes of classic movies become disaster and this is the case.",1036886400,,344,5.7254901960784315
1478845,4,B00005JLIF,"""The Truth About Charlie"" is a remake of the classic ""Charade."" Judging by the other reviews here, fortunately I have not seen the original, and thus I went in unbiased. The whole film was very entertaining, and my friend and I walked out with grins on our faces.
Thandie Newton brings substantial talent and charm to bear in her role as Regina, and I feel she has a lot to offer as an actress. Mark Wahlberg did a passable job as the mysterious ""Mr. Peters,"" although he has yet to fully come into his talents. The members of the supporting cast did a very good job as well; Lisa Gay Hamilton was particularly enjoyable in her role as Lola.
The plot: Regina returns home from a Caribbean vacation to find her apartment empty and vandalized, her husband murdered, and herself embroiled in quite a mystery. The resulting turmoil approaches the chaotic, as several new people enter Regina's life, each with a conflicting story about the missing six million dollars Regina's husband seems to have hidden. Naturally, everyone wants the money, and is willing to go to extreme lengths to get it.
Regina, even in the midst of an ordeal which could quite possibly endanger her life, is remarkably practical in her dealings with these strange people making her life exceedingly difficult. She doesn't tolerate any BS from anyone, and this seems to disarm them to the point of not knowing what to do - and they all come to like her. In fact, through various experiences, they all seem to reach a point of uneasy friendship, despite being in competition with each other, and occasionally having ""conflicts"" with each other.
The story and the characters are great; the direction, on the other hand, suffers, I'm sad to say. Most of the scenes are hand-held and too claustrophobic. The wobbly shots pan and spin, resulting in a somewhat nauseating experience, unfortunately. But apart from the uneasy ride, Demme does a great job of showing us the rich colors and street life of Paris, and comes up with some unusual angles and beautiful views. The majority of the film, though, is spent very up-close-and-personal with the actors' faces, with much moving about that detracts from the charm of the plot.
This is a very amusing film, though, with wonderful moments of humor (both subtle and almost slap-stick,) and some truly creative scenes - watch for the tango scene, and enjoy. If it weren't for the handheld camerawork, I might even give it 5 stars.",1036627200,6,2440,4.7843601895734595
1478846,4,B00005JLIF,"Thandie Newton, Mark Wahlberg, and Tim Robbins impress in the fast-paced caper from director Jonathan Demme. Based on the 1963 film starring Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, Thandie Newton from ""Mission: Impossible 2"" and Mark Wahlberg really have chemistry in the original film. The film follows the path of a woman who finds that her murdered husband has stolen and hidden 6 million dollars, and there are people after her who want that money. The only problem is, she doesn't know where to look or who to trust. The film is very different from most fast-paced intelligent mysteries, but it falls along that path, being smart, sometimes funny, and very entertaining. Newton gives a great performance that is both charming and attractive. As far as Charlie goes, the truth is, it's an entertaining movie, and that's the truth.",1036540800,,825,4.9855072463768115
1478847,3,B00005JLIF,"Ahh....a nice mystery. Finally a mystery with so many twists and turns that it's extremly possible to get confused. That was the big problem with The Truth About Charlie. It had to many twists in it. Even though the movie has great actors, actresses, and a great plot it's just a little too confusing. Not the overrall plot but what happens because of it.
The movie stars Thandie Newton is a new actress to me. She plays Regina Lambert who is filing a divorce to her husband Charles after only four months. She's on vaction when she meets Joshua Peters who she also met at the airport in her home in France. When she returns to her home she learns Charles sold all their belongings and was murdered. Regina is interveiwed by the FBI and learns Charles had many alias and passports. She and Joshua become friends and he puts her up at a hotel untill her life becomes a least a little normal. She then meets Mr. Bartholomew brillently played by Tim Robbins. He says she has 6 million dollars in her house. She replies ""I don't have it"" and she gets the response of ""Oh yes you do. You just don't know you do."" He gives her a list of people to stay away from. Il-Sang-Lee, Emil Zadapec(also played great by Ted Levine) and Lola Jansco. Everything is fine untill she gets a phone call from a man who tells her to stay away from Joshua. The man says that he wants her money. Now Regina doesn't know who she could trust as she also tries to find and give the FBI Charlie's dough.
The Truth About Charlie is a fun movie but the only reason I gave it those three stars is because it was a little too confusing. Good thing in the end it all comes together.

1478848,1,B00005JLIF,"That the Chucky movies were better than this. At least they were creepy. Jonathan Demme is better than this. I would be embarrassed. This thing is a mess and it's not worth trying to describe the story.
The acting throughout is merely passable. It seemed like Thandie Newton was the only one trying, and she's only okay because of what was given her. I kind of felt sorry for her. Marky--oops--Mark Wahlberg is dry. Tim Robbins is ridiculous. Were they actually paid for this? The rest are like cartoon characters. Even the scenes of Paris were not pleasing. What a waste.
There was a scene early on that indicated what kind of movie this would be to me. Mark and Thandie arrive outside the airport at the same time. He goes up to her and re-introduces himself. The camera, for no reason whatsoever, starts spinning around their heads at head level a few feet away while they're talking. No affective reason. Just annoying. It was irritating.
This is a film that, if done properly, could have been great. But it's a cheesy romantic mystery that's not so romantic and not very mysterious. It doesn't take itself seriously so neither should you. I wouldn't even recommend it for video. It's kind of sad that it has gotten above 2 star reviews by some on here.

7939718,2,B00005JLIF,"As a fan of the original movie, Charade, and a fan of both of the reboot actors, I was really excited to see The Truth About Charlie. I shouldn't have bothered. As good as Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are nothing could save this snooze inducing remake; not even Tim Robbins. The scenery was beautiful and the script was at least similar to the original but nothing could stop me from fast-forwarding to the end once I hit the middle of the movie. Mark Wahlberg's character portrayal was forced and unconvincing (more of a plot device than a character) and Thandie Newton's character wasn't naive and charming (like Audrey Hepburn), she was simply dumbed down to accommodate the plot. The only thing that saved this movie for me is the fact that I paid a rental price and not a full theater ticket admission.

It is very difficult to understand what the actors are saying because they speak in a heavy French accent. For the life of me I can not figure out why they would do a remake of the movie Charade.
After struggling to get through half of The Truth About Charlie I watched Charade. Charade is a fascinating movie with so many twists it captures your attention and you can not stop watching. Charade is 100x better than this movie. Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn even manage to get some comic relief into their dire predicament. Walter Matthau manages to totally convince you that he is harmless and very trustworthy but wow what a turn of events at the end.
