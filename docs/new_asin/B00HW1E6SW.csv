8636628,5,B00HW1E6SW,"The yoga practice in this DVD is perfect for the beginner level, but still delivers a great flow for those who have more experience.  There's a good balance between exertion and repose, and the entire CD flows seamlessly.  You are guided throughout the poses with clear instructions.  Cathy is lovely to listen to and to watch.  I often use this CD when i'm unable to get to a class.  The duration is perfect as well.  I have not tired of it and have owned it for a while.",1390953600,,472,4.306818181818182
