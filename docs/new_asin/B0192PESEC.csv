8743617,4,B0192PESEC,I have all the seasons of digimon and I love all the seasons of digimon and I am glad but I wish the set had a season 2 booklet but it was worth the wait,1458000000,4,153,3.4
8743618,4,B0192PESEC,"i have all the digimon sesons up to this latest one and fusion being the only one i have yet to watch because i want the full fusion before i start so i think there is still 1 more season left? anyway i got this in the mail today and the box looks nothing like the rest its just an average dvd box no slip cover no booklet just a simple box with the 5 dvds

over all this looks like the dumped on step brother of the rest of the boxed season sets im sure the show will still be awesome but the packaging leaves alot to be desired",1457136000,,529,3.809090909090909
8743619,5,B0192PESEC,"On the day after Leap Day 2016, Digimon's 7th season (season 2 of Fusion) will finally be on DVD & Digital Download, as a whole season set! At 24 unedited American-print shows/episodes in their original HD-Widescreen format, season 7 is the shortest of them all, but it's still an awesome story like all the other seasons have always been! You won't believe what in all Mikey and Shoutmon get into when they go back to the Digi-World by themselves (Momentai, to quote Henry Wong's Terriermon, Jeremy and Angie get to help them out a lot by the very end of this season!); AxeKnightmon working side-by-side with his big bad bro Bagramon (try saying that 3 times fast), and appointing 7 Dark Generals to rule 7 lands, with their own Darkness Loaders for Digi-fuses with their goons, or themselves with their goons, like with Dorbickmon and his top goon Huanglongmon (the latter said to be a DNA-digivolution of all 4 of the Digimon Sovereign from season 3, only this one's a WHOLE LOT smaller)! And believe me, it's sure not easy trying to destroy them, let alone AxeKnightmon and Bagramon. Christopher and Nene's teams join up with Mikey and Shoutmon, reorganizing the Fusion Fighters, and even come face-to-face with Ewan, Nene's little brother, who's been flat-out lied to about the Digi-World being just a game to him, by AxeKnightmon. And you won't believe what AxeKnightmon's been up to when the Fusion Fighters finally face the Bagra brothers together, even before Bagramon was trying to rule the whole Digi-World (I better not spoil it, if you don't have Nicktoons OR pay attention to Wikipedia on the subject; all I can say is you'll be shocked over AxeKnightmon's master plan, different from Bagra's own plan)! Also in this season, we get to meet the rebellious Mervamon (who was played Tara Platt, whose only other time on Digimon was D'Arcmon in the TV movie Island of Lost Digimon a decade earlier) and her own little brother Ignitemon (played by Digi-Veteran Brianne Siddall/Brozey), discover secrets behind Nene and Ewan's day they came to the Digi-World, Christopher's own first day, an unheard-of digivolution to a digi-fuse (that being Christopher's MetalGreymon as ZekeGreymon), Ballistamon's secret past as DarkVolumon, the real good nature of 2 of the Dark Generals; Olegmon and Apollomon, what D5 really means, and lots more! This season also contains, and bypasses, the 300th episode of the entire Digimon series, with Mikey and Ewan in a sword fight, the only time we hear Axemon speak, and Tuwarmon (Damemon's digivolution) take on a huge Digi-fuse that ended up sealing his fate, and showing Ewan the naked truth in the process. But that's nowhere near as huge as the one Shoutmon has facing Bagramon once and for all; I'm sure you wanted to hear that happen! This is a 5-disc DVD set with up to 5 shows each, all as single-layered DVDs to prove it, just like the 1st Fusion season, only it had 30 shows and 6 discs; but this one sadly doesn't contain a booklet and photo gallery on this season's characters, like all the past 6 season sets! If Saban's reading this, please bring on season 8, the 3rd and last Fusion saga, in English soon, along with the new movie series in the realm of seasons 1 and 2! And thank you, Cinedigm, for telling us this awesome news about season 7 on DVD, just before Christmas, even though it won't be out till the day after Leap Day! Merry Christmas and happy holidays, everybody, and let's keep hoping and praying for season 8 to come here in English! Remember, don't doubt the shout, to quote the new Digimon King himself, Shoutmon! Sadly, there's STILL no news of a Movie Collection set on DVD OR Digital Download, nor when season 8 (Fusion's 3rd) will debut in English in the USA, as of Christmas 2015. It'll take nothing short of a miracle, even bigger than seasons 1 to 7 on DVD & Digital Download combined, for those things to ever happen in the USA; but remember the old saying, nothing's impossible at Christmas; it's a season for miracles, especially for unexpected ones, to happen!",1449705600,4,4047,4.782857142857143
