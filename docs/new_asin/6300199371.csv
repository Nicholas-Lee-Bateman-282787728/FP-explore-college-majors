7804620,5,6300199371,"Even though the Christmas episode isn't much on plot, this is one of just a very few places where you can see the characters of Jackie Gleason besides the ever so famous Ralph Kramden.  alph leaves the apartment to run to the store for Alice, and when he's gone, Gleason appears as Reggie Van Gleason, The Poor Soul, Joe the Bartended, Rudy the Repairman.  I rate this 5 stars more for the historical value of the show than for anything else.  This isn't recommended for the common fan of the show, but I would recommend this to anyone who wants to check out the characters of Jackie Gleason beyond those of the Kramdens and Nortons.
I do feel that, as a reply to the previous reviewer, time has shown that these shows have held up well.  Maybe time hasn't been as kind to some episodes as others, but it is a testiment and a tribute to this series and that of Jackie Gleason for producing such a fine product that, almost 50 years later, videos, DVDs, and reruns of this show are still on the air.  I think it's great for me, who's 22 years old, to see this show on the air now, and be able to share these shows with someone as special to me as my father, who taught me to laugh and love these classic gems.  And it makes me happy to be alive now, while the show is probably more popular now than it was when it originally aired.",991267200,13,1330,4.216535433070866
