4272249,2,B0046ZYET8,"I recently watched this dvd with a few of my friends and before it was over we all agreed that we didn't like it and it was the biggest disappointment EVER!!! We did watch the video completely in hopes that it would get better, but it never did.

I'm an avid movie-watcher and I try to support African American films as much as I can but this film, this film simply SUCKED!

I think that Fantasia and Faith Evans were both doing someone a favor by lending her names & faces to this project however; they should definitely be more selective in the future because a film like this can ruin their chances for being considered for real films in the future.

I guess by now you know that I am not a fan of this film.  Poorly written script, weak plot (if you want to say there was a plot), weak acting, and ""Yes"", weak directing.

In a nutshell - ""Don't waste your time or money.""",1302652800,2,875,4.2155688622754495
4272250,3,B0046ZYET8,"I purchased solely based on the cover's picture seemingly featuring Fantasia & Faith as headliners who were in the play only a hot minute at the very beginning.  The rest of the cast seems to be doing a ""dressed rehearsal"" or ""try-outs"" with no acting skills.  Take my word for it and pass.",1302480000,2,290,4.452830188679245
4272251,1,B0046ZYET8,This play has poor acting.  It features Fantasia Barrino (American Idol winner) and Faith Evans (R&B Singer).  The two top stars only have cameo appearances and sing one song each.  The remainder of the movie centers around the Gay club owner whose acting skills are not that great.  The whole play was overdone as far as the acting was concerned and could have been done in alot better taste.  Basically the whole play just drags on until you finally get to end which is horrible also.,1299456000,4,486,4.604651162790698
4272252,1,B0046ZYET8,"This DVD was a HUGE disappointment. They only used Faith Evans and Fantasia's names so people would buy it. Fantasia was only seen twice while Faith was seen about 3 times. They sang at the VERY beginning and at the VERY end. The acting was below average for the whole cast, the only memorable actress was the girl who played in Players Club. She wasn't good in Players club or in here. The person who wrote/directed/produced it is Nicki Gilbert from the 90's group Browstone. She has an excellent singing voice....but you won't hear it here. She should just stick to singing and leave Musicals and play writing to the true writers out there.",1296604800,,642,4.640350877192983
4272253,3,B0046ZYET8,"The way it's billed, you think Fantasia and Faith Evans have the starring roles.  In actuality, they have a few lines and one song each.  They just have the most recognizable names.  Otherwise, it is a mediocre, but entertaining production.  The acting is average to substandard, but good for a group of mostly singers.  I'm glad I purchased it as support to the cast.",1296518400,,368,4.6875
4272254,1,B0046ZYET8,"When I bought this I thought that it was STARRING Fantasia and Faith Evans.  I was sooo wrong.  Faith only shows up a few times, and Fantasia only twice.  At the beginning and at the end.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed.  The storyline was too confusing because there was just too much going on.  Was this about good vs. evil, a good girl gone bad, a gangsta trying to influence the girls at the caberet club, a gay owner???  Everything was too hodge podged together with no clear meaning.  On top of that, the girls who were supposed to be the caberet employees never did anything but catfight and sing half of a little tune.  The backdrop could have been a beauty shop or just someone's backyard because there was no point of why they were at a caberet anyways.  Just plain crazy and poorly put together.",1295913600,18,816,4.416107382550336
4272255,5,B0046ZYET8,"Just wondering who the young lady who played Brandy is?  She was not even on the DVD box, but she was the star of the show.",1294963200,,123,3.730769230769231
4272256,1,B0046ZYET8,"While this is an ambitious musical stage play some luster is lost in the dvd format mainly because of the tacky stage settings.  A bit long with only one memorable song- the ""Cabaret"" title song sung at the end credits!",1294012800,,219,4.475
4272317,5,B0046ZYET8,"I watched this movie maybe twice, it was ok. It was very interesting and it was related to real life situtations",1365465600,,112,4.380952380952381
4272318,1,B0046ZYET8,"I have seen a few bad plays, but this by far is the worst play I have ever watched. My husband bought it thinking that Fantasia and Faith Evans would be starring in it and like all the other people who posted, we were both disappointed. The acting was terrible (all of the actors), the songs were too long, there were too many lags where nothing was going on. There was no real storyline at all and although my husband gave up on the play 20 minutes before it ended, I unfortunately toughed it out till the end. I should have gone to bed too. Do not waste your money on this one!",1324425600,,579,4.132743362831858
4272319,4,B0046ZYET8,i think it was good. each of the characters reminded me of a person i actually know. LOL.... I like muscle mans songs hope you do a mp3 release available to purchase on amazon or itunes.,1320105600,,186,4.194444444444445
4272320,2,B0046ZYET8,it was boring somebody else told me about its not one i would keep or watch again. i will probably give it to one of my family members,1316736000,,134,3.8214285714285716
4272321,1,B0046ZYET8,Waste of money!! Fantasia and Faith had a very small part and I could not even make it through the whole movie,1312243200,,110,4.045454545454546
4272322,1,B0046ZYET8,"Honestly the worst thing I have ever seen. Laughable. A horrid waste of time. I couldn't stop laughing. The acting is terrible. The plot is atrocious. Everything about this is terrible, terrible, terrible. I tried to rate it 0 stars but can't do that. I guess I'll give it 1 star since I at least had a good time laughing at this train wreck.",1312156800,2,342,4.359375
4272323,1,B0046ZYET8,"This was a Hot Mess, I don't know where they were trying to go with this play, but they never got there. It was just so much going on and weird storylines and thee script wasn't the best. Leave the playwriting to the professionals. David Talbert, Tyler Perry etc.",1311724800,,263,4.387755102040816
4272324,1,B0046ZYET8,"Such an intriging title, but yet such an awful play. Being a playwright myself, this brings urban theater to shame. I bet after they were done with this they had to hide their faces because I'm sure friends and family bashed on them. The writer should take some more writing classes or just stick with Brownstone because as a playwright, they are considered a complete novice. Tata was a mess and whoever played Brandy never needs to act again. I asked my husband to turn it off of this mess because it was cruel and unusual punishment for theater lovers like myself.",1311552000,,567,4.568627450980392
4272325,1,B0046ZYET8,"This was truly a waste of film and time. You would think because there are at four excellent R&B singers (Fantasia, Faith Evans, Terrell Carter, Nicci Gilbert) are in the cast, it should have been at least entertained. This was a waste. There was no concept, plot, moral of the story, nothing. It was just a bunch of watered down drama that did not connect to anything. All the way to the end of the film, I was still trying to see the point! Whom ever has watched this film already feels like they got played, by being attracted to the cover thinking we was in for a treat, Instead u got a cheesy stage with some bad acting, pointless songs, and a miscellaneous plot. This was one film that should have been shelved. Do NOT play this movie to entertain any guests. They won't be your guests anymore.",1309046400,,800,4.375838926174497
4272326,3,B0046ZYET8,"I don't recommend this play. I couldn't get past the first half hour of it. Too much was going on, too many storylines, too much yelling. It was confusing. Fantasia and Faith Evans gave pretty good performances, though their appearances were brief. There was hardly any singing in this play, but like I said, I only watched the first half hour.",1308873600,,344,4.655737704918033
8417599,1,B0046ZYET8,It was great,1509753600,,12,3.3333333333333335
8417600,3,B0046ZYET8,I thought this play was pretty cool. I like that it speaks of things that some people go through in their life. I also like that Fantasia was on the play.,1502150400,,154,4.0
8417601,5,B0046ZYET8,I just love stage plays,1483920000,,23,3.8
8417602,3,B0046ZYET8,Writing was not good,1469836800,,20,4.25
8417603,1,B0046ZYET8,it was a play that was filmed. Not what I thought. Dragged on too.,1431648000,,66,3.7857142857142856
8417604,2,B0046ZYET8,"I didn't particularly care for the movie, I only purchased it because I was told I favored one of the actresses.",1415664000,,112,4.380952380952381
8417605,1,B0046ZYET8,"It was a waste. I haven't even watched it all the way through because it was boring. Don't waste your money. If you want a copy of it, I'll burn it for you. That's how bad this is.",1408492800,,180,3.763157894736842
8417606,3,B0046ZYET8,This was something to add to a play collection if you have one.. Pretty good people in it.. I wouldn't recommend it unless its in the $5 been,1391990400,,141,4.071428571428571
8417607,5,B0046ZYET8,What a great movie and full of entertainment. Fantasia is absolutely a star and so is Faith Evans. I have to recommend the movie.,1382400000,,129,4.416666666666667
8417608,1,B0046ZYET8,TOO horrible for words! Nicci Gilbert needs to get Brownstone back together and just keep singing (something she's great at) if this is the best she can do.  The cover is misleading because your lead to believe Fantasia and Faith Evans are the main characters but they featured no more than 6-7 minutes apiece.,1366416000,,310,4.7407407407407405
