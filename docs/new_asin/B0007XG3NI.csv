Oliver Reed, as Jim Wilson the police lieutenant, is excellent as the cool, careful, and cynical policeman. Raymond Burr, always authoritative and stern, as the corrupt head of police, is effective and strong in a too small role. I would have liked to have seen more of Raymond Burr in this movie.",1517011200,,380,4.686567164179104
8053503,4,B0007XG3NI,"This is a nasty little exploitation film with a misogynist streak, but I'm very, very fond of it: despite all the over-the-top performances, cliched dialogue, endless scenes of a snivelling Susan George, and the preachy anti-violence message (which is blatantly contradicted by the level of brutality onscreen), there is something truly great arrived at here, at least in terms of violent exploitation films. Maybe it's just Stephen McHattie's performance? He plays an innocent schlub who returns from an out-of-town job to discover the girl he'd gone away to earn money to be with (Susan George) has pimped herself out to a local bigwig; along the way, he sustains a head injury that makes it impossible for him to control his temper. McHattie brings a remarkable level of pathos to the character - you understand that he's not in his right mind, so the more horribly he acts, the more you sympathize with him, as someone who has clearly lost control, but is otherwise a decent human being. He ends up holding his former girlfriend hostage and abusing her while demanding to meet her sugardaddy; this turns into a police circus, with bystanders watching as Oliver Reed - a retiring cop who decries violence - attempts to defuse the situation, while his colleague's fingers itch on their triggers. Great setup, great cast, and in some ways a great little movie, if extremely crude and definitely on the hammy side. Two issues: the DVD is a full-frame version of the film, and contains one very oddly censored scene, where a character's profanity is edited out and replaced with non-profane language that calls a LOT of attention to itself as not being what was originally said (I forget the quote, but it's truly bizarre and noticeable: ""Hey, you gal-darn goofball, get your flopping hands off me!"" or the like). This same bit of censorship was on the VHS version of the film, as I recall; it seems unlikely that the film will ever be restored, though, so this may be the best you get. Presumably the title inspired the Flesheaters' song of the same name!",1354838400,,2055,4.840909090909091
