5101677,5,B007OWV0CO,"First of all, this is a home video style movie. It follows a couple on their journey. With that being said, I really enjoyed it and it helped me make the decision about having my baby at a birthing center. They talked about the entire process and when to go to a hospital if you need to. They interviewed a midwife that talked about the at home or birthing center process. That really answered a lot f our questions.

I think the two one star reviews are a little harsh. They are not ""weird"" people. They are just a normal couple that wanted the share the birth of their child with others.

I don't think the other one star reviewer had any intention of having a home birth, they are just here to write a negative review (Natural Birth Propaganda). The movie didn't bash hospital births and your baby isn't going to be brain damaged if you have a home birth or use a birthing center. This person is clearly bitter.

All and all, if you are considering a home birth or birthing center, I would recommend watching this film.",1360886400,3,1022,4.368421052631579
5101678,1,B007OWV0CO,terrible. creepy people. not what we expected at all. my husband and i turned it off after 30 minutes of torture.,1358985600,3,113,4.428571428571429
5101679,4,B007OWV0CO,I thought this video was amazing for women who are interested in a home birth. If shows you a bit of what you can expect and explains the role of a birth doula and midwife wonderfully. I am a birth doula and will be sharing this with my future client if they are considering a home birth or haven't made a decision about where they would like to birth.,1354147200,,352,4.115942028985507
5101680,1,B007OWV0CO,"A bathtub is not natural.

If you want to have a natural birth, go out to the nearest hiking trail with your husband. Take only a wooden cup you widdled from a sharp rock just in case it rains and you can catch some drinking water. Find a nice cozy cave somewhere - where no one can hear you because they might have technology, which hurts you and baby according to the midwife on the video. Proceed to give birth of your baby (if you survive) and wrap the baby in some nice skin from a bear you killed with a bow and arrow earlier in the week.

After the baby comes out, proceed to eat the placenta because those are nutrients that shouldn't let to waste now that you are in the wilderness.

THAT is a natural birth.

Technology saves lives. Don't listen to the quack on this video.",1349395200,5,783,4.2
5101681,5,B007OWV0CO,"I really wanted a natural birth with my second child, so I read lots of books, talked to moms who had successful natural births and also watched some films on the subject. I found this documentary to be particularly helpful in making me believe I could handle a natural birth. A few weeks after watching it, my son was born...and I succeeded in having a completely natural childbirth experience.",1344297600,14,395,4.739130434782608
5101682,5,B007OWV0CO,"Relatable, informative and empowering. I hope all expectant parents get a chance to view this film. A great modern way to understand birthing choices as well as a comprehensive explanation of the support thats available.",1334966400,7,220,5.314285714285714
8519907,4,B007OWV0CO,Very educational film,1456444800,,21,6.333333333333333
8519908,1,B007OWV0CO,"I bought this video and didn't watch it until after the return period ended. The DVD is completely blank - there was no content on the DVD (did not play on any of my devices and does not have the familiar grooves normally found on DVDs or CDs). So, this purchase was a waste of $20.",1428969600,,282,4.053571428571429
8519909,3,B007OWV0CO,It was an okay film to watch just to get you in the mood for birth.  It wasn't all that informative or earth shattering.  It was just a documentary on a family with snipets from other people.  I think it should have been a free movie...,1425427200,,236,4.086956521739131
8519910,5,B007OWV0CO,Great intro to first time birthing mothers and information. I liked it well enough to recommend to friends. I watched this video and probably every birth video professional and amateur out there including youtube.,1391212800,,213,5.294117647058823
8519911,1,B007OWV0CO,"I couldn't make it through 10 minutes of this. I am a natural birth and informed birth advocate and was excited when I read the description of this film. It was horrible, slow and boring. What a waste of money.",1382832000,4,210,4.275
8519912,1,B007OWV0CO,"The info is either wrong (early on, the husband and wife are debating a ""fact"" that actually they both have wrong"", the people long-winded or everyone is just annoying. It needs a very sharp editing to make it watchable.",1374451200,,220,4.666666666666667
8519913,3,B007OWV0CO,"Birth In Action -  Because birth is always miraculous, watching this birth is a blessing.  However, I hoped to see more of the birth than the few snippets and less talk about midwifery and doulas.  It is an educational film about midwifery and doulas and it is well done for that purpose.",1374364800,4,288,4.5
8519914,5,B007OWV0CO,"Although the quality of the video and audio leaves much to be desired, I really enjoyed the content in this video. It's very personal and explains through voice over and interviews about the natural birthing process. It does it's job, and gets it's point across well. Watch it with your birthing partner!",1373414400,,304,4.865384615384615
8519915,1,B007OWV0CO,"while i appreciate that this was someone's natural birth journey, it feels more like a home video than a documentary.",1370736000,2,117,4.9
8519916,1,B007OWV0CO,"Wish I could have my money back.  Very little revolved around the birth.  Bunch of ""experts"" talked most of the time.  So dry and boring.",1363910400,5,137,4.4
