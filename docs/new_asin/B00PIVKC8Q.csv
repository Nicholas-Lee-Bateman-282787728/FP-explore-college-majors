6808982,5,B00PIVKC8Q,"I am choosing of the four movies on this DVD, JOSEPH IN EGYPT to review, which is a favorite story of mine.

Joseph has been given a place of honor by his father and his older brothers are jealous. Joseph is sold as a slave, imprisoned wrongly, and then finally gains favor with the King.

The characters do a very good job showing the jealously, despair, and perseverance in various situations. Joseph illustrates in many challenging circumstances his love for God and his devotion to live a pure life.

Joseph's intelligence saves Egypt from starvation. Through his honesty and  integrity he saves many other people who did not heed his advice of the coming starvation.

And of course Joseph shows his forgiveness at the end . His brothers were forgiven.

The movie brings to life the real people in the Bible story. If you enjoy the stories of the Bible , I believe you will find this DVD worth watching.

6808983,5,B00PIVKC8Q,"Finally a hard to find video from the filmography of Richard Basehart is released on DVD. When I saw this for pre-order I didn't hesitate. This is a pretty good story about the Tower of Babel. This was from a TV series that aired back in the 70's with different celebrities appearing in each story...Greatest Heroes of the Bible. The Tower of Babel centers on King Amathar played by Vince Edwards and one of the towns elder's and father of the man who designs and is in charge of the building project, Joktar played by Richard Basehart. The King becomes tyrannical as he orders the towns people to spend more and more time building his tower under threat of severe punishment if they don't comply and soon are being treated almost like slaves. Joktar from the start is against the building of the tower and says it will bring about the wrath of god especially when King Amathar decides he wants his likeness to appear on the tower. Erin Moran of ""Happy Days"" portrays a young woman who is to marry Joktar's son but their wedding is put on hold for the building of the Tower has priority. God's wrath is soon unleashed as he destroys the tower and gives people different languages and spreads them out over the land so that King Amathar can no longer effectively command them. The DVD contains four stories in all. I think viewers will find these Greatest Heroes of the Bible entertaining and the cost of the DVD is reasonable. I wound up saving $3.00 with Amazon's low price guarantee on pre-order DVD's.",1423872000,13,1504,4.574074074074074
6808984,3,B00PIVKC8Q,I have always enjoyed biblical movies from the bible and the stories. This DVD movie has a lot of hollywood actors. During the the 70's biblical movies were made for entertainment rather biblical and ethnic accuracy and give it 3 stars for mainly entertainment. Biblical movies made today and even a few years back tend to be more accurately made and with more of the middle eastern ethnicity. I do however recommend it to other customers and the seller was very good on the shipping.,1494806400,4,484,4.705882352941177
