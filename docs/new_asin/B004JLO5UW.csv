8541600,5,B004JLO5UW,"This Volume solves the mystery of the crime Cordelia, Victorique's mom, was framed for. It doesn't have subtitles but I love the show so much, I know the story by heart. The special edition comes with an art book I'm rather fond of. It has some stuff not included in the Guide Book for the show. And yes, Japanese Blu Rays can play in American Blu Ray players. I was able to play this on my PS3 fine. DVDs are a different story though, but then again the art for this show is so beautiful, it MUST be seen in HD.
I highly recommend this series and highly recommend buying it on Amazon. I look through ebay and their prices for just this DVD is outrageous! I got it here for the price of a regular DVD. Not bad. So yes, all you anime fans, you should check out this little known gem from Bones. This show is seriously underrated, which is surprising since Bones is known for their quality. They animated Fullmetal Alchemist and Eureka 7 for pete's sake! Needless to say, the animation for this show is simply gorgeous. I love the characters, especially Victorique. In my opinion, it's the characters that drive this show. Victorique is pretty complex and Kujo is so noble. I love this show and it seriously needs more attention.",1412380800,,1227,4.433628318584071
