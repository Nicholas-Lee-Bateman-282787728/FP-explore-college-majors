4489954,4,B004X0MJH0,"I have three confessions. #1: I was at the live taping of ""Thou Shalt Laugh 5."" #2: Watching it on DVD, I still wipe tears from my eyes at the same point in which the cameras caught me doing so during the taping. #3: I don't know if this is the best, since I've only seen the first two in the series. (I know, shame on me, right?)

In a time of economic and political upheaval, it's nice to be reminded that Christians can--gasp!--actually laugh and have a good time. I do believe God gave us laughter as a medicine, and Chonda Pierce has been divvying out such prescriptions for years. She hosts the show this time around, backed by six funny men, six and a half if we count the ventriloquist dummy, Romeo. From the jittery clown stories of Joey I.L.O to the large-handed visuals of Leland Klassen, the DVD gets us warmed up for Bone Hampton, Daren Streblow, Gilbert Esquivel, and Taylor Mason (Mason being the only comic featured on all five DVDs in the series). Some of the jokes were visually better during the live show, and some of Chonda's best humor got cut in the edits, but there are other jokes here that I missed while laughing in the live setting. Overall, it was a great night of humor and fun.

There aren't a lot of take-home lessons for those hoping for a sermonette, though Bone Hampton gives us some food for thought. Instead, these DVDs set aside the sermonizing and focus on just having fun. I think it's a good prescription. Despite some sound level variations that had us adjusting the remote more than should've been necessary, this is a great addition to the growing Christian comic repertoire, and it's not only ""Christian friendly."" This is over 90 minutes of true-to-life, funny stuff all around, or in the words of Bone Hampton, ""It is what it is."" And yes, I still wipe those tears as Daren Streblow describes his children, telemarketers, and childbirth classes.",1308960000,10,1892,4.578171091445427

4489978,3,B004X0MJH0,"Chonda was the host/hostess of this series and she was wonderful. We didn't find all the comedians to be all that funny. A few chuckles, yes. Taylor Mason was probably the best and we DID laugh; and they saved him for last. Good comedy for Christian families and those who don't care for racist/foul-language comedians but love to laugh.",1355184000,,337,4.728813559322034
4489979,5,B004X0MJH0,"It's been so refreshing to find some great comedy that we could enjoy as a family.  The variety of comedians offered something for everyone, in case a particular entertainer wasn't your favorite.  But with Thou Shalt Laugh 5, we really enjoyed them all.  We wish Taylor Mason's ventriloquist act were longer in this one, though.  He's amazing.  His acts in the previous DVD's were even funnier.",1327276800,,394,4.909090909090909

4489981,5,B004X0MJH0,"We got the very first in the line of ""Thou Shalt Laugh"" videos and I've watched it so many times. It's so hard to find comedy that can be painfully hilarious without making you feel dirty or cheap after you watch it. It's also unique to me that they have several GREAT comedians on the same tape. It's never boring and it lifts the soul!
If you haven't watched a good dose of clean, but sidesplitting humor lately, get one!

4489982,5,B004X0MJH0,"A wise man once said that the mark of a truly talented comedian was the ability to be funny without working blue or dirty.  Very few comedians over the years have been able to pull this off but a few like Bill Cosby and Jeff Foxworthy have been able to examplify this skill.  Well on Thou Shalt Laugh 5, you'll see another handful of comedians that will have you laughing and wiping away the tears without worrying about if it's appropriate for the whole family or not.  No matter how young or old, every member of your household will find a great many things to laugh at on this one.  This is also a DVD you can watch over and over again whenever you need a laugh.  If you're a fan of comedy and would like a DVD that the whole family can watch and one that'll actually make you all laugh, Thou Shalt Laugh 5 is it!",1311724800,4,816,4.139240506329114
4489983,5,B004X0MJH0,"We are so thankful for all the Thou Shalt Laugh series because it is not very often that we can sit down together as a family and
watch comedy together. We all prefer clean but funny, professional humor. Not cheesy stuff where they are really stretching it to get a laugh.
If you like funny, but not the trash, I highly recommend any of the TSL series!
They make great SAFE gifts too. You won't offend anyone and laughter is the greatest gift you can give I think. Blessings! Kim",1311724800,2,479,4.333333333333333
4489984,5,B004X0MJH0,"Okay so we all know christians have no since of humor....WRONG! This is actually REALLY funny.
I found that these particular set of funny people that performed this set, seemed to really have a good grasp of life and the everyday ins and outs that make life laughable but at the same time family friendly, rather than the contrived and badly crafted jokes that we have come to expect from ""Clean Joke-tellers"".
So Get this DVD it's fun and everyone in the family will love the experience and share in the laughs. It's Great.",1311638400,,524,4.585106382978723
