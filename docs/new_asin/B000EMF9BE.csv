2523052,1,B000EMF9BE,"I agree with D. Thayn's comment that those positive reviews are probably planted by the Welcomed Consensus. It's over rated.

For one, the quality of the DVDs are very poor. Bad sound quality. Video isn't any better. They probably copied from the last copy of VHS.

Lesson learnt - get the new production stuff, not the recycled archive.",1171929600,57,337,4.793103448275862
2523053,5,B000EMF9BE,"I will agree with those who complained about the production values of this product; these DVDs clearly done with a low budget.  These films are also clearly not intended to be pornography.  If your are expecting glossy porn, you will be disappointed.  However, if you can put your expectations aside and really look at what is being presented her, you might be astounded.  Most people use a male model to orgasm--increasing tension and arousal until there is a sudden release.  There is nothing, in itself, wrong with that.  However, the female body is clearly able to experience something far more profound.  The techniques taught in these DVDs show how to achieve what they call a dome shaped orgasm.  What most people practice are techniques that cause the body becoming increasingly tense in an aroused state until there is a sudden and dramatic orgasm.  The Welcomed Consensus shows how to build arousal in a way that doesn't easily dissipate.  These techniques bring about a long, deep orgasm.  It doesn't have the drama of the screaming convulsive state we expect to see. It is, however, mind-altering.  The body relaxes and the mind becomes blank as the woman experiences waves of ecstasy.

The very first time we tried these techniques, my wife experienced a thirty-minute orgasm.  She described it both as a continuous orgasm and as one-hundred orgasms.  I also found it intensely pleasurable.  There was a sense of merging with her experience and taking part in perfection.",1171152000,78,1484,4.995918367346939
2523054,1,B000EMF9BE,"I am so mad I wasted my money on these videos they are way too overpriced and just like the only other negative review not very well made.  I read all of the reviews before I bought this and now I think those reviews are planted by the Welcomed Consensus, the producers of these DVD's.  Most or all the reviewers reviewed a lot of their DVD's even the men on female masturbation!

The man in these videos called the women that orgasmed ""trained women"".  I agree like Pavlov's dogs they start to orgasm right when they hop up on the bed before he even starts to really stimulate them.  Now I don't know many women out there who can go from no stimulation to orgasm in 0 seconds. He never explains how he trained them either.  Probably because they want you to buy more videos.  If you really don't believe me then only buy one of the videos not the duet you don't learn anything new and you'll save some money and won't be as mad when you are disappoined.  Both DVD's show the same thing just different women.  And what is the Welcomed Consensus anyway it looks like a cult of women with short hair and skirts who love this guy who trained them to orgasm.",1170979200,59,1154,4.28110599078341

2523068,5,B000EMF9BE,"Highly recommend the Duet video set, for enhancing - or in our case reviving - your sexual desire!

This is an educational DVD, with an emphasis on what the producers refer to as the Deliberate Orgasm technique - they call it D.O.ing.  My partner and I got a lot out of watching these DVDs, as we had gotten to a place in our relationship we were no longer much interested in sex.

This video set discusses the sexual cycle of what they call tumescence, which brought a whole other element of excitement to both of us in the bedroom.  The method of the man DOing the woman is clearly shown, with consistent lecture throughout the demonstration.  There is an ease now for my partner to navigate his way around my clitoris.  He has found my ""spot"" and is learning to ""peak"" me to give me longer orgasms.  He takes the lead now in bed, and enjoys everything he is doing to my body.  Our sex life is so much more fun, and has gone beyond the point either of us thought possible before.",1187136000,13,981,4.3224043715847

2523070,5,B000EMF9BE,"I own both of these and it is smart to purchase them from amazon as a Duet, it is a better price. It is for those who are searching and wanting more pleasure in the bedroom.

I own quite a series of educational sex DVD and this one was a great addition in showing a technique unseen before giving the opportunity for extended orgasm through the easy ""Deliberate orgasm technique"".",1182729600,8,380,4.428571428571429
2523071,5,B000EMF9BE,"I like both DVDs in this set, and was particularly effected by the information on the techniques of peaking and extending orgasm.

In the beginning of this video, when the instructors are discussing the orgasm demonstration that is about to happen, they describe the male model of orgasm upon which most orgasm in our society is fashioned then they describe the female model of orgasm which this group researches, talking about a ""Dome-shaped orgasm.""

This was rather enlightening, showing how to increase the amount of sensation using these concepts.

It is a fairly clinical demonstration, but it is clearly meant to give information not to arouse, there is a live sensual anatomy lesson.  Very helpful as the close-ups show a  lot of details.

Most intriguing was the dual stroke in which the instructor showed how to alternately bring her up with the index finger and peak her with a thumb stroke.  You can actually feel this dual sensation as he uses it to bring her higher.  They talk about the advantages to doing.

I can see practicing the techniques shown in this video will make anyone a better lover.  It certainly improved my sex life",1177891200,30,1147,4.835897435897436
2523072,5,B000EMF9BE,"One never knows too much and can always learn from something new, so I purchased this DVD to see what it was all about.

If you're looking for porn, you are definitely in the wrong place.  While this is low budget, what education film is not for the most part. Yet you can bring pleasure to a woman like few women have ever experienced before.

The DOing technique is all about the pleasure of the woman...If that is not your thing, then stop reading this review as I intend to try to explain the DOing technique further so those that are going to buy it for its education value as adult subject material to be used to pleasure the woman, will better understand the DVD instruction of the DOing technique, as after I watched it, I learned I been doing it for 12 years now.

Pay no attention to how the woman looks who is receiving the DOing technique, if she does my met with your desires, no worries as this is an Educational How Too instructional DVD, it not made to get you off. Instead listen to what he is saying. She appears to be his Lover and she is experience in having this done to her before. I can tell you from experience, a woman who has experienced an organism lasting an hour or more from the DOing technique, will start to feel intense pleasure before you even touch her, as it's called anticipation.

This technique, is to apply pressure at one of the woman's most sensitive spots. For the Lover applying the DOing technique to the female, it is all trial and error for you, as the woman's Lover, to learn what the woman's maximum pleasure level is, i.e. what is her plateau level. The plateau being that point, which when reached, is when a woman who truly has an orgasm from intercourse will experience, lasting a few seconds to a minute before it drops away, and the woman is done.

But with the DOing technique, the woman's lover, and I use the word lover, instead of man as this DOing technique can be applied by a woman pleasuring her lover too, it is not restricted to just a man pleasuring his woman.

The woman's lover through the use of the DOing technique will bring a woman's pleasure almost up to that plateau and then slowly bring the woman's pleasure level downwards, about halfway down, then bring her pleasure level back up to the plateau, stopping just short of going over. You are to vary the level of pleasure you are giving her. Never going over the top of the plateau, and never totally stopping and letting pleasure level drop down to nothing either. Back and forth, between those two points you are to pleasure your woman. When you are experienced, you will be able to bring your woman up to that plateau, and hold her at that level for long minutes at a time. If she starts to beg you to take her over the top, that is normal, just DO NOT take her over the top, bring her pleasure level back down a bit. Do not bring her to close to that plateau and hold her there forever, as her pleasure could become painful as just too much pleasure. Another way to look at DOing technique, is you are teasing her with different levels of pleasure, as both her and you learn her limits of just how much pleasure she can take, or how long can she experience an organism When you are ready to end your DOing technique with your woman, the DVD has you putting firm pressure over her groin to help cause the swollen area to decrease in swollenness with the blood that has caused them to expand/swell up. I prefer to take the woman over the top, by appling rapid intense pleasure to that one spot mentioned in the film causing the woman organism to sort of explode with pleasure for the woman.

IMPORTANT: The next day after a DOing technique, I would recommend you sit down with your woman and the two of you discuss what she liked and did not like during the DOing technique.  If you brought her up to that plateau and held her there for a few minutes to the point she was begging to be taken over the top of the plateau and you did not take her over the top.  Ask her about that, find out what she like or disliked. Ask her if she is willing to do it again, maybe sometime she will want it to just last  no longer than 30 minutes while maybe other times she is willing to see what her limit is an how long, you as her Lover can make her organism last?

Once you are experience with the basic aspect of the DOing technique to your lover, you can experiment with this technique, using toys, your fingers and orally administration of the DOing technique.  However you apply the DOing technique to your lover, just remember the basic concepts of the DOing technique.  That is you are to bring your lover almost to the her plateau then back down about half way and backed  up and then back down about three quarters of the way and go back and forth as you experiment through trial and error her limitations and desires

The DOing technique is all about ""her pleasure only"", a woman making love to a woman experiences pleasure just from giving pleasure.  If a man can learn this concept, he will reap the rewards greatly in the end.

IMPORTANT:

An inexperienced women that is just learning about her sexuality and may have never had an orgasm before and you talk to her about giving her an organism that will last hours, may have some choice comments for your idea. After she talks with her other female friends, as few know what the DOing technique is, or for that matter what it all about, (The woman's pleasure). Most inexperience woman believe what men have taught woman through the ages, and what other woman believe from this incorrect understanding of how it is between a woman and a man, i.e. that a woman must give her man pleasure and fake it.

This DVD with communication can bring two Lovers very close together as the woman receiving the extended organism will experience pleasure few woman ever feel. She may get spoiled from it. Where all she want is to be given pleasure. lol",1176854400,36,5914,4.388482632541133
2523073,5,B000EMF9BE,"Although  not exactly what I had in mind,  I must admit that I actually learned something.  Sometimes, the description says ""educational"" but in the end it all looks to same to me. Hard and fast climax and then it's over.  But these DVD's are packed full of pertinent information regarding producing what they refer to as a dome-shaped orgasm.

There was quite an interesting conversation in the first one of the set about how people view sex in our culture, and just one of many gems for me was about how focusing on getting to know a woman's orgasm is actually mutually beneficial, and can make for the best sexual experiences.

In addition, I could hear the sound of the woman's voice as she was having the orgasm and see how still and relaxed she remained, and it was the most genuine I have seen (or heard) captured on film.

I thought that the techniques that were presented were thoroughly described and so far, have proven to be very effective for me and my partner.",1175644800,28,974,4.531428571428571
2523074,5,B000EMF9BE,"It seems that while so many people have been busy theorizing WHY women have a clitoris and the function of female orgasm, these people seem to have dedicated themselves to WHAT to do with one and the fun you can have with a woman's natural energy or tumescence as they call it.  These are the only educational dvds my partner and I have ever viewed that are dedicated to the direct stimulation of the clitoris in a manner that is precise and easily visible. Their 92+ collective years of experience on the subject could potentially make anyone a leading authority, but I believe in quality over quantity, and have found both facets in these DVDs.

The first of the set, Deliberate Orgasm- Expanding Female Orgasm, is a re-mastering of their first release originally filmed in 1996.  The making of the DVD was inspired by one of their most popular courses called ""Observation of Intense Coming"", a demonstration of a woman in orgasm for one hour.  The fairly extensive front graphics suitably set the stage for the demonstration.  That the clitoris has the highest concentration of nerve endings is not particularly new information, and is an excellent explanation of why to put such focused and precise attention on this delightful little organ.

Once the actual demonstration begun I was a bit uncomfortable staring at a complete stranger's private anatomy, about as up-close and personal as a camera can get.  The details revealed visually were unmistakable; the involuntary release and contractions, color changes and drastic engorgement inside and outside of her entire genital area.  As her orgasm was underway, her moans were in perfect harmony with the contractions and the sensation was palpable even through the audio/video medium.  Often times, the strokes were lighter than I had ever thought about stroking my own partner, and it seemed that very subtle changes in them would alter what she was feeling.  We noticed this after several viewings, there is so much to see and feel.

Many of the questions  posed by the student audience were similar to our own, like: what each of them was feeling, why is manual stimulation the most effective way to produce an orgasm in a woman's body, what does the man get out of it, how long can a woman orgasm, etc.  I was quite impressed with how both the man and the woman could answer questions even while in the state of extended and intense orgasm.  For us, the remaining unanswered question was, how does he continue to take her on the ride of an extended orgasm while seemingly having the sensation increase over time?  This was the specific question that the entire Deliberate Orgasm - The Technique of Peaking and Extended Orgasm was designed to answer.

The Technique of Peaking video features a different woman. It also has been re-mastered and since it was made four years later the quality of production has been vastly improved.  As in Volume I, this DVD is chocked full of valuable information regarding producing what they refer to as a dome-shaped orgasm, an orgasm with peaks and valleys, leaving the woman higher than she was when they started. A very informative teacher panel discussion precedes the actual demonstration.  Many valuable points are touched on but the most notable is the differentiation between the various signs of orgasm and the actual amount of sensation or pleasure she is feeling. The anatomy lesson is reviewed, which some might consider repetitive,  but we found it interesting to see another woman's anatomy described in detail and think this can not possibly be done too often.

The demonstration is similar to the first DVD, lasting about 25 minutes. The different strokes he used to peak her are shown and discussed throughout, providing a fine repertoire from which to choose, and some basic expectations of what each stroke will produce in her body.  The gold mine is in the description of precisely when to change the stroke. We found this approach very refreshing and effective.

In our experience, these DVDs far surpass their promise to provide the viewer with the basic fundamentals of better orgasm. They have provided my partner and I with a whole other slice of life.",1174867200,19,4172,4.913105413105413

8111231,5,B000EMF9BE,"Welcomed Consensus is so much way ahead of time by publishing the series of DVD:s that finally recognise the right of half the world population, that is, all women, to have pleasure in sex. NOTE: This is not pornography!! Instead it is a loving, tender art, and it should give all men something to think about. Making love must not always have to be making children. Family planning paves the way for pleasure and for those who want to set children to the world, maybe two planned children will suffice? Yet sexual relaxed sex is every woman's right to my simple mind.  A planned child will never ever become a terrorist!  And a lone woman should have the right to enjoy sex without any shame whatsoever. I think humankind has so far only developed very very little in terms of equal opportunity for pleasure of sex..Women ARE suppressed in most parts of the world!

 Expanding Female Orgasm
What a way to expand my sex life!  Taking a few minutes everyday to be intimate with my partner is the best thing I can do for our relationship.  This is an informative video on DOing in a somewhat clinical setting with pretty and knowledgeable instructors. This Vol. I and Vol. II is a good place to start to learn ways to make what I love doing, better.
In Vol. II, The Technique of Peaking and Extended Orgasm, I felt her highs from watching and can understand why peaking is a good tool for added pleasure in the sensual experience.  Going higher and higher then stopping the stoke and going even higher on the next stroke is a pleasure to experience even on video.  All men who want to be better lovers and produce better orgasms in women, should see these videos.
The duo of videos was a perfect pairing.  Volume I gave me the basic information on deliberate orgasm. Volume II went into detail on the technique of peaking while DOing.  The clinical setting makes the information clearer to hear and get while the friendship between the DOer and DOee made it human and fun to watch.",1417651200,,1139,4.5

These DVDs show a live vulva where the clitoris is being stroked for around 20 or so minutes, including an anatomy description.  Both DVDs are the same.

Since viewing the dvds, one of the things I love to do is to peak her, and I've gotten pretty good at sensing when she is at the top and desperate to go over. She seems to love everything I do during this time, and one of my favorite things is to keep her at that moment of intense desire for as long as possible, and as close to going over as possible, before letting her down, or go over.

These techniques have answered questions I had for a long time about how to please her - only to bring about MORE questions that I didn't even consider before. We have become VERY interested in exactly what it is she wants, every time we have sex together. My most recent question is this - do women prefer to rise slowly, and then drop down a little several times, or would they prefer to remain at the brink for extended periods of time? From my perspective, the higher she gets and the longer she stays there, the more gratifying it is for me. When I ask her what she likes, it appears to be whatever I did at the time. I've heard keeping her at the brink called ""sweet torture,"" and I'd love to have a woman's perspective.

Like I said, we are really in to her sexual pleasure, and I attribute this rekindled interest in part to the techniques given in the videos. Highly recommend, but ONLY if what you want is a super-charged sex life!!!",1264291200,7,1457,4.233812949640288
