8537581,5,B0098GD6F8,"Australian filmmaker Ralph Smart is a scenarist on this wonderful comedy gem from Gainsborough Studios. The Crazy Gang, 1930s precursors to the Goons and Monty Python, unleash a genie (Alistair Sim) from a button made from metal off Aladdin's original lamp and the fun and games begin.  Sim and the Gang are hilarious. An absolute hoot. Smart's co-writers Marriott Edgar and Val Guest often worked together on Gainsborough comedies with the Crazy Gang, Arthur Askey and Will Hay.",1366502400,2,479,5.141025641025641
