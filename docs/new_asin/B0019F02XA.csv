3435184,5,B0019F02XA,"I enjoy the most well-written television series since NYPD Blue and Brooklyn South.  This set of DVDs provides me with the ability to view the episodes at my own time and place.  Additionally, it allows me to stop, rewind, and repeat the dialogue to pick up all of the character interaction as well as the evolving story line.  This set will make the drudgery of Winter more tolerable.",1224806400,2,385,4.632352941176471
3435185,5,B0019F02XA,"Haven't had a chance to view all 5 seasons, but I know they are wonderful, since I watch NCIS on a regular basis.  In fact, NCIS is the only prime time show I make a point to watch; most others, I miss because I forget.  But NCIS?  Never.  If I miss one, it's because I was not aware it was on, such as a different night or special show.

NCIS is a wonderful show, with a wonderful cast.",1223683200,3,387,3.91025641025641
3435186,5,B0019F02XA,"I have never in my entire life managed to watch a single episode of CSI or other series like that. I tried, but always lost interest way before the end of the episode. I very much prefer comedies or SF.

NCIS, on the other hand, I watched every week and I bought all the DVDs and watched them several times. Lots of action, very funny, great characters. Try it.",1219104000,18,361,4.231884057971015
3435187,5,B0019F02XA,"i am a diehard ncis fan and cant wait to get my box set! hopefully it gets here soon! i finally got it, even earlier than planned!",1219017600,,130,3.8518518518518516
3435228,5,B0019F02XA,I love this show. In my opinion it's better than most forensic crime dramas out there. You can really connect with the characters.,1268438400,,130,4.695652173913044
3435229,4,B0019F02XA,"NCIS is an unusual show. Most shows start with an impact get a core of keen viewers and then go into a decline. NCIS after some years is actually becoming more popular. The positive of the show is the ensemble cast which does a type of routine in each episode whose's charm doesn't seem to wear thin.

On first seeing it, the hook of the show seemed to be knee jerk patriotism. (Love of country and love of the military) . After now watching it for five years  I think that was totally of the money.

The key to understanding the shows dynamics is to realise that it is all about old blokes. The hero of the show is Gibbs. He is the only person who is not flawed. Gibbs is old playing someone is his 50's although the actor in the role is probably older. Gibbs does not understand computers and can't work a mobile phone. His hobby is wood work. He builds boats in his basement but he does not use power tools. Instead he creates his boats with hand tools. Whilst most old blokes get ridiculed because they are so uncool Gibbs is celebrated. He is not only the smartest investigator the best interrogator but he is the moral centre of the show.

So not only is an old bloke the hero but the supporting cast are all flawed to make him appear that much smarter. Tony the next in seniority to Gibbs lacks the gravitas to be a hero. Timothy is just a computer nerd the sort of kid who was no good at sport at school and still defers to those who are the jocks. Duckie the medical examiner is there for comic relief and the women all defer to the elderly hero.

One can imagine that the majority of fans are people who can't work all their functions on a mobile phone and who need someone else to set up their computer. Who feel a bit lost in a changing world.

Yet despite all this the show works. If it didn't work it would not have gone on for season after season. Even now it does not seem to be tiring although some of the plot devices have become somewhat fantastic.",1258848000,,1967,4.204244031830239

3435232,3,B0019F02XA,"All of the DVDs so far are in fine shape and play well.  However, so far I have opened seasons 1-4 and ALL of the cases are broken up inside.  VERY POOR PACKAGING.

The packaging was a piece of cardboard with a plastic sheet on it.  The dvds were put inbetween the sheet and cardboard which kept it from moving, but not protecting it against shipping.  It needed to have peanuts of bubble-wrap.

I am enjoying the DVDs.  I am deployeed and it is nice to have something to watch.",1254873600,,478,4.2444444444444445

3435236,5,B0019F02XA,"I loved this product. The packaging was perfect. The extras on the later seasons were wonderful. The only only negative part was that not all of the seasons had the play-all episodes capability. Other than that, it was perfect.",1251936000,,227,4.846153846153846

I have been trying to ration myself to just one episode a night - and am not doing a v. good job of it.  The series is serious, funny and addictive.  I find myself wanting to give M.

So when I chose to get the DVD's, I was very happy to discover on Amazon the season 1-5 collection - and at a very reasonable price too!  I highly recommend getting this collection to anyone - you will discover a very witty yet intelligent show.  The cast is great also!  In fact, I do believe that is a major source of the success of this show - you have a cast and a set of characters that just work well together.",1246665600,,504,4.21875

The tracking number was not real and we were emailed by the seller that the order had not shipped after all and was now ""out of stock"".  We then received an Email from the seller telling us that the DVD Set was available directly from his site, and for a lower price.
This seems very suspicious to me that the item is not available on Amazon's secure site, but yet is available for a cheaper price on the seller's unsecure site.  You can make your own decision on whether to buy from this seller or not, But I will not.",1244332800,3,669,4.2109375
3435308,5,B0019F02XA,"I am ""addicted"" to this show. The DVDs make it possible to watch anytime. I enjoyed the extra features, such as Ducky's tour of autopsy and the dinner time question and answer session with the main characters. The only objection I had to anything about this product was that on season 5's DVDs, they all were Closed Captioned and we could never get this turned off. And the spelling in some of the caption's was like a foreign language, rather than English. That was very strange. Otherwise, A+ !!! A Must Have for any serious NCIS fan.",1243555200,,536,4.536082474226804

I stumbled across re-runs of this show on USA and got hooked.  All the dvds arrived in pristine order and are original dvds produced by Paramount.  If you're not buying from AMAZON, then maybe you might get a bootleg.  I would definitely recommend this tv series for hours of serious entertainment.",1239408000,7,427,4.578947368421052

Belasarius created wonderful characters and the actors play them perfectly.  Tony is a real pig, Ducky is priceless, ""Probie"" is brilliant and gullible, Abby is goofy and loveable, the two female agents are very believable, and Gibbs is the perfect boss that we all have loved and despised. I have watched the first 40 episodes so far and the audio and video in everyone has been excellent.

Miau Lu stated the problem would be resolved and a few days later I received Season 1. I am still waiting on Season 3. I had the option of getting a partial refund or continue searching for Season 1.

We didn't notice the duplication for quite some time.  We reported it immediately to Amazon and they promptly sent a replacement set and  return label for shipping the ""mistake"" back to them.
