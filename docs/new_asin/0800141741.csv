167769,5,0800141741,"This movie is one of the most well made movies of the past ten years; perhaps ever.  Each and every scene is well crafted and real; alternatively subtle then poweful (and sometimes both).  Unlike most modern movies, you  never find yourself saying ""no one would say that"" or ""no  one would do that"" in any scene, with each sequence carefully crafted  and real (although like life, not always happy or exciting) and placed in  exactly the right order. And there are no logical gaps because the director  was willing to make a romatic comedy that was deeper than a Three's Company  episode. Yet despite the ovewhelming reality that permeates the movie,  Cameron Crowe still permits us to use the movie to escape to a different  world (the reason we go to movies in the first place) in much the way that  Hepburn and Tracy enabled us to escape for two hours in years gone by. It  is hard to do both of these at the same time in 1999 and the sports  sub-plot helps that a lot here. The movie ambitiously emphasizes script and  characther development at the risk of losing watchers through transitional,  character-building scenes with no obvious (at the point you are watching  them) pay-off.  So few movies or shows are willing to invest screen time in  character or plot development in this video-game inspired world (the  Sopranos being a recent TV example of such ambitious writing).  But Cameron  Crowe knows that the pay-off at the end is so much better for the viewer if  we know these characters and care what happens to them.  And he is right.  Much like Its a Wonderful Life, the ending is then powerful and real  because of what we have experienced with these characters and not contrived  and unbelievable as is usually the case.  It is surprising that a studio  allowed the movie to be made in this fashion (you expect 1 hr and 30 min.  sit com with more sex and a few explosions), and even more surprising that  such an ambitious movie is as popular as it is with the movie going public.  This movie is a rare find and has the mark of a true classic, it gets  better with each watching.  Bravo.",932688000,,2104,4.525333333333333

167771,5,0800141741,"I'm not really too hot about Tom Cruise, but this film changed all my opinions about him. I think this and Rainman are his best works by far. Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a top sports agent but when he does a memo  stating his firm should be more human, he gets the sack. He leaves taking  the goldfish, his one client Rod Tidwell (An excellent Cuba Gooding Jr) and  one of the accountants Dorothy a single mum (Renee Zellweger) This film is  suberb and really deals with people's emotions. Tom Cruise is exceelent as  the confused Jerry Maguire. Cuba Gooding Jr is both funny and sweet as Rod  Tidwell and got a well deserved best supporting actor oscar (Show me the  money!) Renee Zellweger is very god as Dorothy who is hoplessly devoted to  Jerry. All in all this a good, fun film to watch and I must admit I had a  tear in my eye at the end, and the 2 little boys in it are really cute.",912211200,,888,4.207100591715976

167818,5,0800141741,"What a great cast of awesome actors and it is really exciting to watch these brilliant & powerful duets performing together! Tom Cruise & Rene'e Zellweger are so great together in their roles and they have such great chemistry. Regina King & Cuba Gooding, Jr. portray such a beautiful, powerful, devoted, loyal & loving couple. Rene'e Zellweger & Jonathan Lipnicki who plays her son Ray are fantastic to watch together as mother & son, and what an awesome child actor, he really did a great job! Lastly, it was really touching to watch the solid friendship form between Tom & Cuba as Jerry MaGuire & Rod Tidwell. There are so many great scenes that I really love, 1) characters Jerry & Rod having a heated discussion in the locker room, 2) Jerry & Ray having a conversation on the sofa while Jerry is drunk, 3) Jerry & Ray in the kitchen hugging before Jerry & Dorothy head out to dinner, 4) romantic sex scene with Jerry & Dorothy while jazz tape is playing that the babysitter gave Jerry then Jerry who is not impressed, pauses to ask Dorothy, ""what is this music?"" LOL. 5) Dorothy's sister looking out of the window, talking to herself and repeating ""get in the van"" as she's watching Dorothy with Jerry & hoping Dorothy doesn't change her mind about getting in the moving van to leave. 6) Romantic scene at restaurant between Rod & wife Marcy where the two of them are saying sweet things to each other & feeding each other and Dorothy & Jerry are realizing they don't have that type of loving relationship. 7) Rod singing ""What's Going On"" at Jerry & Dorothy's wedding and wife Marcy being embarrassed, 8) Regina physically attacking Rod's brother TP for not being supportive when Rod appeared unconscious after being hit during football game, 9) Rod & Jerry hugging and crying after game when surrounded by reporters then Jerry realized he missed Dorothy, which then leads to the great romantic scene when Jerry runs off to go to Dorothy then interrupts the Divorced Women's Meeting to tell Dorothy ""You Complete Me."" There are many other great scenes and I could not list them all but the viewers will see for themselves that this movie is great from beginning to end.",1480896000,,2175,4.666666666666667

167898,5,0800141741,"At the 1997 Academy Awards, host Billy Crystal referred to the characters played by the five Best Actor nominees (of which Tom Cruise was one) as being ""a burned guy, a mentally-challenged guy, a mentally-abused guy, a paralyzed guy, and an agent. And four out of the five are treatable."" Of course Crystal was jokingly referring to the Agent as being beyond help. Among the figures of sports and entertainment, agents are often regarded as the necessary evil of the industry often with reputations as being the sleaziest of VIP's, just-above used car salesmen. Their antics which require a high-level of tough negotiations are sometimes seen as money-gouging and materialistic. In the film ""Jerry Maguire"", Tom Cruise decides to wear the shoes of a sports agent and walk around in them for just over two hours.

""Who am I, and what am I doing?"" Jerry Maguire asks when he realizes his sports agency, SMI, tries to cover up the darker aspects of professional sports. His answer is inspiring, transcendent, and detrimental. He mistakenly writes down his inspired thoughts and submits them to his colleagues for suggesting the agency concentrate better on fewer clients. For his inspiration, he loses his place at his agency and many of his highest-paying clients to his rival Bob Sugar. Subsequently, he also loses his attractive but shallow fianc. Maguire is forced to try and live his dream of being more caring and receptive towards the needs of his clients rather than just being there to get a slice of his athlete/clients' multi-million-dollar paychecks. In a particularly poignant sequence, he retains his client Frank ""Cush"" Cushman who is a leading contender in the NFL draft through a handshake with his father, played by Beau Bridges. However, on draft day, he learns through an unexpected phone call that his rival Bob Sugar, through deception, convinced Cushman to sign with him instead. Now, Maguire has retained only Tidwell, and he must create his new agency from the ground up with only a single client as his starting point.

So the question asked of the movie is: Can a sports agent find a more meaningful, possibly spiritual, life and still acquire the high-paying clientle? And maybe even more to the point, can an agent make a difference beyond just being a high-powered money negotiator? ""Jerry Maguire"" is a thoroughly entertaining riches-to-rags-to-transcendence story of a fantasy sports agent trying to find a deeper purpose to an otherwise materialistic existence.

The film works at almost all levels, particularly because of the dynamism of Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. in an Academy Award-winning performance, playing the only client willing to stay with Maguire. Part of the story is Maguire's journey from the purely material to a deeper and more-satisfying existence. Rod Tidwell (Gooding), wide receiver for the Cardinals, is a strange opposite to Cruise but has a similar problem. Tidwell is a devoted father and husband, emotionally involved with his family but does not quite give that same heart on the football field. The story becomes about both characters finding something deeper in their place in the world, Gooding giving what he gives to his family to his team, and Cruise giving to his clients and co-worker/lover Dorothy Boyd his love and attention. Renee Zellweger plays Dorothy Boyd in a passionate and sensitive performance that will definitely bring tears. Zellweger's son becomes an important character and also an inspiration to Cruise to find the deeper and more sensitive part of himself.

In the materialistic world of late 20th-century America, ""Jerry Maguire"" is a breath of fresh air. A rare story produced by the money-obsessed film studios about the dangers of losing oneself for the sake of self-promotion and monetary gain. An interesting statistic has emerged of late regarding a high number of American businessmen on their deathbeds who begin regretting the direction and purpose of their lives. ""Jerry Maguire"" offers an alternative, although probably few in his position would find the wisdom to change course. But since you can't take it with you, life is about what you leave behind.",1432684800,,4156,5.116347569955817

167948,5,0800141741,"This is one of my old time favorites, which I've watched countless times, and each time I watch it, this movie is as satisfying as the first viewing. Jerry Maguire is Tom Cruise, a popular sports agent, who gets fired from a huge company, after writing and publishing his story on how to change for the better by having less clients and giving undivided attention. Naturally, the firm was totally against having less clients, which meant lower paychecks for the Sports Agents, and their protest was to fire Jerry Maguire. At a horrifying time in his life, he gets no sympathy from the woman he's engaged to, and no support from his past fans.

He breaks up with his girlfriend, after meeting another woman, who began working with him in his own office, which was Renee Zellweger. She supports him when he was down-and-out, and Cuba Gooding Jr winds up being Jerry Maguire's only client, but his most loyal client. Jerry falls in love with Renee, and her adorable little son. Cuba Gooding Jr., a football star, takes Jerry's advice on important bonding with his fans and earns deep respect from them, when he strikes gold during a game and wins big-time.

Jerry and his football star become very good friends, Jerry falls in love, and his career once again is going good. There are laugh out loud moments, intriguing moments, sad moments, but overall a great ending with a happy feeling. Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, and Cuba Gooding Jr. give Superb acting performances and the rest of the cast was also good. A very enjoyable, entertaining movie from start to finish.

It just didn't seem like the type of movie that was going to resonate with me at all, and the backlash regarding its solitary Oscar win was already loud and clear.  I kind of thought I was going to hate this.  What I found though, was a delightfully fleshed out romantic comedy that kind of lived up to the initial hype and praise and made for a refreshing take on a genre that is so awfully oversaturated with clich&eacute;s.

In Jerry Maguire we meet a morally conflicted sports agent who winds up fired and facing a new chapter in his life with a single mother secretary and a passionate football player his only supporters.  With his new moral outlook, Maguire sets off to do things on his own and finds out that things are far harder and more desperate and yet, in the end, much more rewarding when you know that what you are doing is the right thing.  This simple story is handled with such lightness and love by Cameron Crowe, who really made a name for himself with this film.  The entire cast is up to par here, with Cruise delivering his finest performance to date, and Zellweger bursting onto the scene with such promise.  But yes, it is Cuba Gooding Jr. who steals this movie.  For good or bad is up to you as the viewer.  While I don't think he deserved that Oscar (especially in a field containing Edward Nortons stunning performance and William H. Macys brilliance), but he was extremely entertaining here and really delivered a complete knockout of a comedic performance.  For what he was asked to do, he nailed it.

This is just a great little movie that can be unfairly maligned these days.  It still lives up to the bar it set for itself and continues to be one of the best romantic dramedies out there.",1398729600,,1808,4.442424242424242

168001,5,0800141741,"I'm usually not the sort who gets emotional while watching a movie, yet with every viewing of Cameron Crowe's JERRY MAGUIRE I always start crying during the scene where Marcee Tidwell (Regina King) thinks husband Rod (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is seriously injured after a game-winning TD catch. These tears continue when Jerry (Tom Cruise) confronts wife Dorothy (Rene Zellweger) at her sister-in-law's (Bonnie Hunt) house, during a divorced women's support group meeting. In front of all these ladies, recently-separated Jerry opens his heart to Dorothy. It's the tenderest of moments and the big pay-off to a great motion picture.
.

Jerry Maguire is a likeable man in an industry of superficial phonies. As agent to a stable of elite athletes, he plays the insincerity game better than anyone, that is until a deeply suppressed conscience can no longer be ignored. A touchy-feely 25-page mission statement is the result, and this radical piece of honesty seems his undoing. In quick succession Jerry loses his job, all of his clients (save one) and his high-maintenance fiance.

The story's most admirable character is Rod Tidwell, wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals. Flawed as we all are, in this case burdened with an inflated ego regarding his on-field talents, Rod is a rare human being: unswervingly true to his wife and the people he calls ""friend."" It's the brotherly love of Rod that helps Jerry grow as a man, and the devoted husband that he obviously is that shows Jerry a truth he hasn't yet realized: that he is capable of loving another person more than himself.

Two quotes from Jerry's sports agent mentor, Dicky Fox best sum up this story:

""If this [points to heart] is empty, this [points to head] doesn't matter.""

and, in the film's final lines:

""Hey, I don't have all the answers. In life, to be honest, I failed as much as I have succeeded. But I love my wife. I love my life. And I wish you MY kind of success.""

I am a romance and Tom Cruise fan and his performance in this movie was stellar along with Renee Zellwegger and Cuba Gooding Junior.  I am not a sports fan but the writers and producers of this movie have done an excellent job of melding the challenges of sports, romance and the role of a sports agent very realistically.

Instead they waste their pathetic careers reporting about his personal life & seem to forget just what a fine performer he is. Enough about these idiots lets get back to this classy film,Mr. Cruise is awesome as is Cuba Gooding Jnr. & Renee Zellweger is stunning,beautiful & emotional,all 3 actors are fantastic. Cameron Crowes direction is faultless & heartfelt,he has a great synergy with his all actors.

168007,4,0800141741,"I read so many reviews of this movie that were merciless in their hatred and in their contempt for those who liked the movie. The argument often employed in reviews is that one is an idiot for either liking or disliking something. Skipping the greater debate about what this says about our country; let me focus on the movie.

Cameron Crowe has made some very nice movies and he's made some lousy ones. This is one of the really good ones, if not his best (haven't seen We Bought a Zoo yet, though...). It is tender, funny, and insightful. Additionally, it has his trademark great soundtrack choices (right up there with Scorcese) to provide further emotional attachment. The scene with an exuberant Cruise driving in the car while trying to find a song to celebrate with is smart and genuine.

I won't argue that this movie is cheesy romantic or that it's driven by the narrow acting dimensions of Tom Cruise and Renee Zellweger - neither of whom I'm hugely enamored of. On the other hand however, the script is strong enough that even they can't ruin it and Regina King and Cuba Gooding, Jr. give career performances.

Yet, what I like most about it is the wisdom Crowe dispenses about love (""shouldn't be that hard""), relationships (""why do you love me?"" or ""we could lose ten years being nice"") and devotion to the truly important things in life (""if this is empty (heart), this doesn't matter (head)""). It's a movie about loyalty, integrity, the maturation of a selfish man (not unlike Cruise's later role in The Last Samurai) and the importance of listening to the urgency of your heart and soul. It's a movie about doing the right thing.

Jerry Maguire is a keeper.",1327104000,,1672,4.657627118644068
168008,5,0800141741,"My opinion of professional sports is of greed and overpaid personnel at all levels. Therefore this movie was great and the action was great from cold selfish sports agents to pro football players of which cuba gooding did a great portrayal. He was the deserving player which was a nice touch.

I really like very few movies and watch very very few more than once. Jerry Maguire is one that I watch about every two years. I think it is that good.

I watched this movie when it first came out due to the suggestion of my 16 year old son at that time. I thought the movie was wonderful. I have the dvd now and have watched the movie 3 times now and just love it. I do not understand the pompous critical reviews. I liked the theme and the reality of the ""get my cut"" attitude of sports agents and pro athletes.",1326153600,,807,4.233766233766234
168009,5,0800141741,"""Jerry Maguire"" is a standout romantic comedy-drama film from 1996. Tom Cruise is lively as Sports Player Management Agent Jerry Maguire.

It is the reassessment of his business philosophy that causes Maguire to put forward drastic changes to his client management services. At first this results in a business and personal collapse, yet it is the depth of the people who stick by him that help cultivate what he desired from the outset, which is to provide a more personal level of service to his clients. Maguire also discovers love that is lasting, and his initial setbacks make way for a better life for him.

This movie presents warmth that is too often lost in a world driven by selfish profiteering mentalities, and the viewer is given tremendous hope by a narrative that is rich with inspiring determination and plenty of good humor.

In fact, it was one of the worst movies I ever saw.  Maybe it's because I don't care that much for football, (though that was a small part of it). I think it was because the story line made absolutely no sense. And Tom's grinning off and on all the time for no reason didn't either. It appeared he seemed drunk all through the film.  It made Renee, the gal who falls for Tom, (why?) appear off her rocker. Tom C. and Renee Z. should stick to better scripts, which Renee certainly has since she made this film, only Cuba G. kept it going.",1318982400,2,700,4.320610687022901

She's one crazy lady if she falls in love with him.  Let's review: she works in his office.  She watches his bachelor party video.  She reads his memo/mission statement.  She inexplicably is on his same flight and able to listen to every word he says (completely unrealistic in my experience)  She loses her child.  He finds her child and tells her some random facts about her cubicle. (How romantic.) She walks out on her job for him.  He drunkenly gropes her and swears in front of her kid.  He rips her beautiful dress as an excuse to have sex with her.  She loves him.  He proposes.  Did I miss something?  What does she see in him?  He is typical Tom Cruise, an action star lost in this romantic dramedy.  He punches and kicks things, fences with a fire-poker, gets punched in the face, wears cool shades, and has sex with multiple women.  He doesn't make me care for his character.  Ever.  So I don't know why she likes him so much.  (Oh right, he had her at hello.  She didn't get a chance to see what an arrogant idiot he is.)End of rant.  Hopefully.
  As to the rest of the film, Cuba was good, the kid Ray was hilarious- is he who they modeled Chicken Little after?  And Renee was ok.  The script, the plot, and Tom sank this movie.  Two stars.  One for Gooding Jr. and Chicken Little, one for Laurel's conversation with Dorothy when she needs to change her clothes.  She should have worn the turtleneck.

168023,5,0800141741,"Tom Cruise was on a winning streak when he did ""Jerry Maguire"" as he continued to have a succession of successful feature films, among them ""The Firm"", ""A Few Good Men"", and ""Interview With The Vampire"". In ""Maguire"" Tom plays an unsuccessful sports agent who is fired from his job. He then decides to start his own business as a private agent to atheletes with only one football player in his stable, a big-mouthed, arrogant guy played to perfection by Cuba Gooding Jr. who would win an Oscar for his role. Jerry Maguire's love life is also on the rocks, but he finds love in the arms of a beautiful widow who has an adorable six year old son.

 The movie is more than a sports film, although football is a huge part of the theme of the movie. The film really deals with interpersonal relationships and is one of the most thought-provoking films Cruise has ever done.

 The performances are amazing. Tom received a Best Actor nomination for his role (the second in his career), Renne Zellweger gives a fine performance as the girl Maguire falls in love with, and Gooding is knock-out hilarious. One of the most touching portrayals in the picture is by child actor Jonathan Lipnicki who plays Ray. In my opinion his performance is the best of any child actor in a motion picture: he's cute, funny, heart-breaking, and simply adorable and adds to the performances by the leads.

 ""Jerry Maguire"" is most famous for some of the most popular lines in pop culture from the 1990's including ""Show me the money!"" and ""You had me at hello"".

 The film was also a huge financial success earning $273,000,000 at the box office.

At the same time I can see why it was a success - it appeals to the average Joe moviegoer who likes to believe that good always triumphs over evil, love will conquer all and outcast mavericks will come out winners in the end.

It punches out all the notes that a Hollywood marketing exec would love - we have the cocky sports agent and iconoclast that all the males in the audience would love to be; the sappy love story with the divorced mom that women supposedly would relate to; the sickeningly cute kid to make the older adults go ""awwww""; the black sports hero that would supposedly drawn in African-American viewers; lots of product placement and obtrusive (and unnecessary) pop songs that are supposed to make you rush out and buy the soundtrack; the terse ""show me the money"" and ""you had me at hello"" catchphrases tailor made for commercial jingles.

The first time I saw this movie I didn't think it was very good. But then, strangely, the second time I saw it I was blown away. I'm not sure exactly why this happened but I suspect it might be because this movie is an acquired taste. I think some movies might be like that; the first time you see it you don't like it very much but then later your opinion changes drastically. I kind of suspect movies like The Deer Hunter and Midnight Cowboy fit this description. I saw both of these movies and didn't like them very much(well actually I thought The Deer Hunter was okay). But they're supposed to be classics so maybe I'll like these films later in life. Or maybe my opinion just changed because I was more alert.

I won't give you a long summary of the story as I think you all know it by now. Instead I will tell you what's great about this film. First off, the acting is fantastic all around. Tom Cruise gives his best performance as does Renee Zelweger, and Cuba Gooding Jr. is spectacular. This is a very intelligent movie. It's also a one of a kind movie. This is one of the most original movies I've ever seen if not the most.

 This movie actually has 3-dimenenial characters unlike a lot of films. A great scene in this movie is when Jerry and Rod are in the locker room and Jerry is trying to get his only client a new contract. Jerry tells him to please get rid of his attitude problem which would help him meet this goal and Rod just responds by saying ""do your job."" Then Jerry say's ""fine"" and then Rod says ""quit telling me to dance"" and Jerry responds ""fine"" again. And then Rod says something along those same lines again and Jerry yells ""fine! fine! fine!"" and starts kicking the wall repeatedly. At the beginning of this film we see Jerry as a smooth, handsome guy who has it all and then later we see his vulnerable side. We see different sides of Dorthy Boyd(Renee) and Rod Tidwell as well. For most of the movie we only see Rod as a cocky loud mouth but at the end we see a whole new side to him when he's in tears in front of a national T.V audience.

Some people didn't like this movie. To those people I advise you to watch it again sometime. Some people on here did like it but didn't tell what actually made this film great.",1260489600,,2392,4.182212581344903
168028,5,0800141741,"Jerry Maguire is a classic movie not only because of classic lines like ""show me the money"" or ""you had me at hello.""  It is a classic because it has an inspiring message for everyone competing in the rat race.  While Cruise was nominated for best actor and the film was nominated for best picture, Cuba Gooding Jr. fittingly won the Oscar for best supporting actor.  He played pro football player Rod Tidwell, who like Jerry Maguire, his agent, is a cocky competitor.  This attitude gets in the way of him playing with his heart and being the authentic person he was meant to be in his vocation.  In Tidwell's case, it's football.  For Maguire, it's being a sports agent.  In your vocation, are you being authentically yourself, competing with a set of principles that guard your heart?  Or, is it all ""show me the money""?  Has your lack of principles and drive to win caused you cut corners such that your conscience has been seared?  In other words, has the rat race made you a rat?  Jerry made the soul searching leap of faith that turned his life around and upside down.  As a result, he was rejected, embarrassed, and defeated by his ""closest"" friends.  But in the process, he discovered two new real friends (Dorothy Boyd, his assistant, played by Renee Zelwigger, and Tidwell).  Together they made it to freedom.

Not very many modern comedy/drama/romances actually have one, but that is what this movie is all about: relationships. Although there are some cliched moments where it seems like the typical comedy/romance, the romance part actually explores issues about true love, intimacy, marriage, and commitment that most movies are afraid to, even though these are very timely issues. The questions of why we marry, why we are we afraid of commitment and intimacy, and what true love is are all explored by the film, as well as deeper questions about what is important in our lives, through the lives of Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise), Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and his family, and various other characters throughout the film. In addition to the excellent script however, the acting is also great. Cruise, Gooding, and Zellweger are all wonderful, and Bonnie Hunt shines as Laurel, Dorothy's protective older sister.  It's not the best movie of all time, but is in my top 10, and I laugh and cry every time I see it. I recommend it highly.",1221609600,,1159,4.883248730964467
168042,4,0800141741,"1996's acclaimed Jerry Maguire is the tale of a sports agent who stumbles upon his morals; therefore he finds himself jobless and fighting for his clients.

Jerry(Tom Cruise) finds himself with only one partner Dorothy Boyd(Renee Zellweger) in his attempts to build back his business; and only one client football player, Rod Tidwell(Cuba Gooding Jr.: in his oscar winning performance)

Jerry and Dorothy start to fall for each other, but how can they not let it get in the way of working together? Meanwhile Rod's still waiting on Jerry for any kind of endorsement or contract and Jerry hasn't quite been pulling through for him.

The rest of the story is not so imperative, it's cliche, mostly predictable, but not terrible. Cuba is fantastic, Zellweger is adorable, and the child talents of Jonathan Lipnicki and Jeremy Suarez are amazing, and honestly they were my favorite part of the entire film. And Cruise, well... it was only a little painful, although I can't blame him entirely, part of it's the character, I know.

Personally I'd give the film 3 stars, but those kids crack me up and therefore deserve their own star.

It's a fine film, I just don't see what all the fuss is about. I prefer Sleepless in Seattle.

168044,1,0800141741,"Just my personal opinion, but that's what we're supposed to offer here. What can I say? I was bored! Especially annoying was the character played by Renee Zellweiger, whose whiny demands on Jerry were awfully tiresome.....but she wins, of course, because it IS a chick flick! One scene was very amusing, though, if only because it was ridiculous: Jerry & his whiny girlfriend are in a restaurant with Ron & Marcee, (played by Cuba Gooding and Regina King). Marcee is hugely pregnant. Anyway, Ron & Marcee are making out with each other between mouthfuls of food, and cooing ""Oh-baby-oh-baby"" while Jerry & girlfriend look on, getting very uncomfortable. Girlfriend is obviously sulking, too, because SHE'D like to get the kind of attention from Jerry that Marcee's getting. Suddenly, Marcee is yelling, ""OH-BABY-OH-BABY"" because she has gone into labor! Hysteria erupts. That was the stupidest part of the film. Well, I won't go on, because it's not worth it. Scenes like those are why I can't stomach chick flicks. Too MUCH! I'll take an action/adventure film or a war film any old day! And yes, I'm a woman! Just don't like sloppy sentimental films, though, and this over-rated one IS, all right.",1217980800,5,1198,4.965174129353234
168045,1,0800141741,"This movie about a sports agent who loses his job and tries to restart his career is cartoonish and predictable. Jerry Maquire (who Tom Cruise portrays in his characteristic intense style, as if intensity were the hallmark of great acting--the same way Billy Joel will hammer a keyboard in search of applause) bets his career on another down-and-outer. Along the way, he finds support in a secretary with a moffit-looking son. He marries her, falls out of love with her, then proclaims his love for her with some phrase about ""you complete me."" It is as if this movie became a cliche of cornyism as soon as it was released.",1211673600,11,623,4.672727272727273

Zellweger's funny and touching performance as lonely single mom, Dorothy is the main reason to watch this film, I remember watching her performance and thinking - she is going to be a huge star back in 1996, she is such a natural.

168056,5,0800141741,"It's not a masterpiece but it is a very good film not so much for the meaning it may contain but for the images it sends in the audience. First it gives a positive image of sports by showing how one man, one agent can be different from all others in this ""industry"", and that the main difference is to believe in what he is doing, to believe in what his heart is telling him, to work with his heart and to love the players, the athletes he is working for, he is working with. That emotional, personal and very close relationship is what everyone needs all the time to feel needed, supported. The film shows that this is also the winning method because athletes want that contact and they can recognize that human attitude and they will work for this warmth of the heart, from the heart and in the heart. And what's more this relationship will enable the athletes as well as the agents to face the difficulties life is made of and life brings up all the time. This will mean success to the athletes as athletes and success for both the agents and the athletes financially. What's more the film conveys another tremendously positive image because the agent is white and the athlete is black and their relationship is one of trust, total friendship and confidence, one of love nothing but love and care and that is the right model to send in the public: what is important is not the differences among people but the possibility to establish trusting and loving relationships beyond these differences and accepting them totally.

168058,5,0800141741,"Hey, we all know JERRY MAGUIRE was a box office hit that put sultry Renee Zellweger on the superstar map and birthed one of the most famous lines in all of cinema.  I've seen this little gem upteen times, enjoyed it even more with each viewing, and scratch my itchy head in amazement that I have yet to review it.  Suffice it to say the review begins now. . .

Let's bypass the plot and the Big Three (Renee, Tom, Cuba); for me this movie ultimately succeeds by the fantastic performances of several of its second tier players.  Jay Mohr is the guy you love to hate as Jerry's backstabbing former boss, Bob Sugar; Bonnie Hunt is the manhater with a heart of pure gold as Renee's sis Laurel.  But Regina King tops them all as Marcee, loving and devoted wife of unappreciated and underpaid Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell.  King is a vivacious, voluptuous goddess who absolutely steals every scene she's in, and while she steals it she exudes steamy sensuality.  Rod Tidwell is one lucky dude.

So with the strength of its cast and its delightful plot, JERRY MAGUIRE has something for everyone.  The Tom and Renee romance pleases the chicks, while the guys get off on the sports drama.  Furthermore, sports enthusiasts will thoroughly enjoy all the cameos made by sports celebrities and broadcasters.  Bottom line:  If you haven't seen JERRY MAGUIRE, by all means see JERRY MAGUIRE.  Show me the DVD player.

168075,5,0800141741,"In the last year I have grown less and less fond of Tom Cruise and all the shinanigans sorrounding his (not-so) personal life. So as much as I try not to let my like or dislike for an actor influence my prejudice on a film, before watching this for the first time, I certainly had my doubts. However my somewhat low expectations of this movie, or rather Tom Cruise in this movie, were wiped away almost immediately. The wit, the humour, and the underlining core of this film are so universal and strong, and even I have to admit that I was blown away.

Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a hot-shot employee for one of the biggest sports agencies in the world. But despite his professional success, emotionally he is an empty and confused man questioning his place and worth in ""a cynical world."" When he publicly expresses his war with life in a memo, he is rudely fired by the company. The difficult position he is left in leads Jerry to become an independant agent to his sole loyal client, footballer Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.). His personal life blossoms as well, with the inclusion of Dorothy (Renee Zellweger), a single mother, who helps him overcome his intamacy issues and becomes his platform of inspiration.

The film's screenplay is outstanding. Filled with bright, quirky lines, including the memorable ""show me the money,"" and ""you had me at hello."" A film is made or broken on the quality of the dialogue, and ""Jerry Maguire,"" is filled with a zest and passion that is not found in many films. The script carried out by the characters really draws you in and makes you laugh out loud at one time and makes feel like crying at another time.

And ofcourse, a script can never work without the talent of the actors who bring it to life. As I mentioned earlier, I am certainly not Tom Cruise's biggest fan, but even I have to admit that he was perfect for this movie. Despite what you might think of him, he is a talented actor who carried the role of Jerry beautifully, and I DO believe he deserved his Oscar nomination. Renee Zellweger, a relative unknown at the time of this film's release, is charming as Dorothy. She's got a particular innocence and purity about her that was a great relief, seeing as the film is based around the idea that money is the only thing that brings happiness. And speaking of money, the performance given by Cuba Gooding Jr. as the ""show-me-the-money"" football player is simply flawless. He is absolutely HALARIOUS, and the secret ingredient that makes this film work so well. Every scene with him in it is so much fun to watch, and I am so glad he was awarded with the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.

""Jerry Maguire"" is ironic, in that is promotes the idea of ""love conquers all,"" with the backdrop of the multi-billion world of American football. It's a beautiful contrast, that at the end of the movie really accentuates that without love at the core of something, there is nothing. I really loved this film, and I came away feeling truly happy. It's a feel-good romantic comedy, with a hint of drama that's full of wit and charm. DON'T let your frazzled opinion of Tom Cruise deflect you from this film; ""Jerry Maguire,"" will strike a chord in every way.",1150502400,3,3195,4.580419580419581
168076,5,0800141741,"Cameron Crow's career in writing screenplays has always been hit or miss.  I still believe that Jerry Maguire is his best work.  Elizabethtown had moments of greatness (with plenty of flaws), but Jerry Maguire is a great film. I read that Tom Hanks said the film was ""perfect."" I think that pretty much sums it up.  It is a feel good movie with something for everyone - Perfect.

Jerry Maguire is a successful sports agent who seems to have it all - a great job, hot girlfriend, and tons of friends. Then he has an epiphany that makes him want to be a better person, or find meaning in his life.  This epiphany sparks a hilarious chain of events that result in him losing everything - his job, his girl, and his so called friends. And he nearly loses his mind.  Anyone who has ever had to start life from scratch should see this film. I still like to watch it every year of so and I enjoy it every time.

Through the course of getting back on his feet he meets single mother Dorothy Boyd and a romance ensues. The only client to stick with him is Rod Tidwell, an egomaniacal, over aged, undersized football player.  A friendship emerges between Rod and Gerry through which each learns a valuable lesson from the other. This is not your typical romantic comedy.

Tom Cruise gives an excellent performance. At times I felt like I was watching the grown up ""Joel"" from Risky Business. Rene Zellweger is funny and adorable. Guys, you will fall in love with this character - Dorothy Boyd. Cuba Gooding Jr.is hilarious; not since Sean Penn's Jeff Spicoli has Crowe created such an over the top funny character as Rod Tidwell.

That said, what she heard was very right.  This movie is more than a romantic comedy but really a movie about life and the importance we place on the small things that tend to take away from the MORE important things like love and loss.  Jerry Maguire follows the story of Jerry Maguire (Cruise), a sports agent, as a flight of conscience costs him his job, but gains him the respect of a fellow employee (Zellweger) who begins to fall madly in love with the man Jerry 'could' be.  The thing is that Jerry hasn't fully embraced the prospect of what he 'could' be quite yet and has actually begun to regret his conscience all together.  Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Rod, a football player, and Jerry's only loyal client, who wants Jerry to 'Show me the money'.

Maybe it's his religious zeal? I don't know. You have most of Hollywood wanting to crucify Bush and Cheney, and you have a substantial portion of Hollywood telling us it is perfectly normal to have two men make love to eachother. Now put down your stones. Don't throw rocks at me. I'm not saying it's wrong. It's just that here's a guy who doesn't back away from his feelings off the stage, tells you how he feels about redemption and life ever after, and he's the guy we raise our eybrows at? Go figure.

And the couch incident on Oprah. Hey. Wait a sec. That's the same couch that Jim Frey told us he had been addicted to hard drugs, spent months in prison with bad guys, was befriended by a mobster, and he cried, Oprah cried and we cried. Then he came back when he was caught lying, and said he was only kidding. And he cried, Oprah cried and we cried. Maybe it's the couch.

The point is, Cruise is a good actor. He has an early history with Hollywood. Hmmmmm. Let's see. Who else. Well Harrison, little Bobby D, Harvey, Martin Scorsese, Meryl Streep. Sounds like pretty good company. And the early stuff wasn't that bad. Risky Biz and before that Taps.

And come on. Don't tell me that Dustin Hoffman did a better job of acting then Cruise did in Rain Man. Cruise had it all over him. But Hoffman was the sentimental favorite. That's all. See the movie again and tell me I'm not right.

So I think Jerry Maguire is laugh-your-behind-off funny. Zellweger is hilarious, trusting, compassionate, focused on what she wants, and Gooding is a thousand percent better than in other movies like Pearl Harbor. And Cruise does a better than commendable job representing all of us when we do the right thing and the guy upstairs doesn't give us immediate gratification and acknowledgement.

168082,5,0800141741,"Sports agent Jerry Maguire has it all in life - except he really doesn't.  He has an attractive fiancee, a friendly group of friends, and that first class plane ticket with the extra glass of orange juice.

  He also has a problem with emotional intimacy that all of his ex-girlfriends will attest to.  He and his fiancee have naked conversations and purport to share everything with the idea that knowing a person's life story forges a connection.  He is a sports agent because he cares about sports, yet he neglects the values that would make him respect and love his job because those values are not commonplace in that business.  This is Jerry's problem.  He is almost, but not quite, what he wants to be.

An attack of conscience and a slice of bad pizza late at night have him writing down all of the things he has repressed, and jumping in.  Predictably, he loses everything, fiancee, friends, and job.  His shallow life is gone, and this has Jerry noticably whacked.  Tom Cruise does a great job of playing the i've-fallen-off-the-edge, passionate, hug-craving Jerry.

The transformation from cold shallow sports agent to emotional, cracked, truly affectionate-to-the-point-of-sappiness, golly gee apple pie live with your heart and inspire people is quite believable, because one gets the sense that this is the person Jerry has had inside of himself all along, but somehow along the way it was twisted.

""We live in a cynical, cynical world,"" says Jerry.  People always talk about the ""Show me the money,"" scene, but that quote is really the heart of the film.  Having the courage to care less about the money, to be yourself, to care about people, want quality over quantity in what you do, love and live well.  THAT is what Jerry Maguire is really about.  The sports agent thing is just a very appropriate plot.  And ironically, Rod, Jerry's one and only client, is shown the money when he does just that, and becomes a fan favorite in a moment of spontaneous joy.

I reiterate - love and courage verses cynicism.  It's why Jerry has a tender reunitement scene with his wife in the midst of a divorced women's group, who for just a moment forget their cynicism.",1138924800,3,2173,4.75668449197861

Rated R for language and sexuality.

Director Cameron Crowe uses ""Jerry Maguire to ask the simple question:  is life all about money, fame, and glory, or is it really about something else?  Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a high-powered sports agent for a huge agency, handling a portfolio filled with high profile sports figures.  The name of Jerry's game is money; he gets the big bucks for those he represents, he keeps them in the limelight and in the end pulls down some mighty big bucks for himself and the firm.  One night, he wakes up and happens to look at himself in the mirror, and for whatever reason, it suddenly dawns on him what a selfish, soulless, empty life he is leading. So in the wake of this epiphany, he seizes the moment, sits down at his keyboard and hammers out a `mission/morality statement,' in which he reorganizes his entire approach to his career, including reestablishing parameters and setting new priorities making conscience, ethics and integrity his paramount concerns. And while still riding the high of his nocturnal enlightenment, he goes to his office, makes copies of his statement and distributes it to the mailboxes of everyone from his boss on down.  In the cold light of morning; however, he realizes what he's done and races to his office to avert disaster.  He enters the room to a hail of praise and appreciation from his peers, but his boss is less enthusiastic. It's no surprise to Jerry, then, when the big `M' his superiors are interested in turns out to be `Money' and not `Morality,' the equation equals `Money talks, Jerry walks.' But before he leaves, he vows to make it on his own. He's up, he's positive, he has his statement and he doesn't have a clue what to do next. What he does know is that the adventure of a lifetime is awaiting and the world is about to meet the ""real"" Jerry Maguire.

Cameron Crowe made his debut as a writer/director with ""Say Anything"" in 1989, in which he first exhibited that keen insight into the human condition that has been one of the trademarks of his success as a filmmaker. In ""Jerry Maguire"" he demonstrates again that acute sense of knowing what makes people tick, and leaves no doubt that he knows how to convey it to his audience. Crowe's story, as well as the presentation, is original and imaginative, and he fills it with real characters involved in very real situations and it's these characters that really sell it, because these are three-dimensional people, not just cardboard cut-outs, and moreover, Cameron knows how to get the best out of his actors to really bring them to life. Tom Cruise was the perfect choice to play Jerry; he has the look, the energy and the talent to get inside this guy's skin and make him tick, and he successfully channels his natural exuberance into his character, tempering his performance just enough to make it really work.  Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance is deserving of the acclaim he received for it.  As Rod Tidwell, the pro football player/client who sticks by Jerry and insists that he ""Show me the money!"", Gooding equals, if not surpasses Cruise's level of enthusiasm with a vibrant and rich portrayal that makes Rod one of his most memorable characters. Like Cruise, Gooding is perfectly cast and points up, again, what an acute sense Cameron has for who and what will work to bring his story so convincingly to the screen.

Not to be outdone by her co-stars, Renee Zellweger gives an endearing performance as the vulnerable but steadfast, single mom, Dorothy Boyd. She's such a ""giving"" actor, and she endows Dorothy with a gentle, caring manner that expresses her deepest thoughts and feelings so well.  Her work here is every bit as Oscar worthy as Cruise and Gooding's, and it's hard to understand why she was overlooked, as she is such a vital presence in this film.  ""Jerry Maguire"" is well beyond the normal sports drama, and in fact, the film has virtually nothing to do with sports.  Intertwining the themes of machoism, greed, and reputation, Crowe sends the audience on a journey that discusses integrity, love, and the ultimate enjoyment of life.  A touching, oftentimes hilarious, and supremely well-executed masterpiece of filmmaking.",1135900800,,4391,4.843582887700535
168095,5,0800141741,"In 1996, ""Jerry McGuire"" proved itself as a breakthrough film for many of its cast and crew.  It earned many awards, including five Oscar nominations (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor [Tom Cruise],...), winning two (Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor [Cuba Gooding Jr.]).  Therefore, this film proved the true potential in several of its cast members, namely Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., and producer, director, and writer Cameron Crowe (2000's ""Almost Famous"", 2005's ""Elizabethtown"").  Though some had previously stretched themselves as artists occassionally, this film earned them newfound respect like never before.

""Jerry McGuire"" follows a greedy workaholic sports agent who suddenly loses his job.  This begins his path of soul searching, which teaches him many life lessons, namely his true love.  When Dorothy enters his life, he realized the true worth of money is much less than the finer things in life which are free.  Meanwhile, he begins his own agency.  Only few of his clients follow him.  All except one, Ray, maintain this relationship with Jerry.  This becomes closer than ever as Jerry struggles to help him find his place in football and later, of purpose.  These series of storylines create an eyeopening masterpiece that leads to a powerful and unforgettable conclusion.

Cameron Crowe begins his series of masterpieces with this film.  He proves in this film that he is one of the finest filmmakers of today.  He takes a creative, unique story and adds great substance in its events.  These written words often find some humorous scenes that maintains its dramatic theme unbelievably.  This shows that films don't need a large budget to attract audiences or to be amazing.  As with his following films, he never rushes any of his projects.  He assures himself that they are full quality, and that every storyline fit one another.  In particular, ""Jerry McGuire"" adds some clever quotes that make this film for added viewing pleasure including ""you had me at hello"", ""you complete me"", ""did you know that a human head weighs eight pounds"", and the most prominent ""show me the money"".  This undistinguishable writing style proves that sometimes, the most unexpected becomes the highlight.

This roller coaster film could not be as enjoyable if it wasn't for the brilliant performances, namely but not limiting Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, and Cuba Gooding Jr.  They give their characters the unforgettable presence that may be close to impossible to most other actors.  Cruise offers his signature acting style to new extremes to the main character Jerry McGuire.  Zellweger's more emotional performances gives greater strength to the film's dramatic and romantic value.  Gooding offers the more eccentric theme that often gives the famous film quotes new meaning.

Such film quality proves that ""Jerry McGuire"" has and always will stand the test of time.  This will surely please a variety of audiences, the more dramatic and the more comedic.  It has proved its capabilities as a future film classic.",1129075200,2,3067,5.216768916155419

168097,5,0800141741,"Well, I'm incredibly late to the Jerry Maguire party, but I'm glad I finally made it.  I thought this was just a comedy, but I should have known better because laughs alone usually don't generate the kind of success this movie enjoyed.  This is a wonderful, feel-good movie with a surprisingly effective emotional payoff.  Tom Cruise is great, Cuba Gooding, Jr., steals every scene he's in, and that Renee Zellweger is nothing short of perfect.  They even threw in a clip of McGarrett on Hawaii Five-O and sent me away with Bob Dylan singing over the credits - in my book, that's going above and beyond the call of duty.  And I never tire of seeing someone break away from the cynicism of big business and actually put some heart back into an increasingly heartless way of life.

Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is, of course, a bigshot sports agent who has it all - then loses it all.  For some inexplicable reason, he develops a conscience late one night, puts together this huge ""mission statement"" all about reducing the number of clients and giving those remaining the genuine personal touch, and sends it to everyone in the company.  With a schlep of a boss like Bob Sugar (the always annoying Jay Mohr), his days with the company are, not surprisingly, numbered.  He vows to start his own company, desperately trying to hold on to the clients he has been representing - but all he ends up taking with him are outrageous Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), an accountant who was truly inspired by what he had written.  It doesn't seem like much, but he really has all he will ever need - he just doesn't realize it until the end of the movie.

Life on his own is quite a struggle, especially after he breaks up with his vicious fiance (Kelly Preston), and I know it must be truly demoralizing to be defeated time and time again by Jay Mohr.  Rod Tidwell, a great player who doesn't get the notice (or money) he thinks he deserves, stays loyal to him, though, for rather inexplicable reasons - even after Maguire fails to get him the kind of big money he is looking for in a new contract.  Dorothy also stays with him, and Maguire grows increasingly close to her and her little boy Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki).  There's love in the air, and Maguire's famous problem with emotional intimacy makes what should be the simplest thing in the world immensely complicated.  We see a lot of Maguire at his worst - double-crossed, drunk, beaten up, wallowing in self-pity.  He never gives up, though, and that's what's important.  I find it a little problematic that he did not apply the principles of his ""mission statement"" to the way he lived his life, but - in his defense - guys tend to be pretty dense about this kind of thing (and would that we all had a Dorothy to help us see the light).

There's a wonderful cast on display here, with uncommonly meaningful secondary characters: there's little Ray, of course, but Dorothy's bitter yet loving sister Laurel (Bonnie Hunt) and Rod Tidwell's wife Marcee (Regina King) really do lay claim to a commanding presence in the story.  You can also make a little game of spotting all of the sports personalities that make cameos (usually silent ones, thankfully) in the film.

This isn't a comedy; it's a serious story that just happens to feature a lot of laughs.  It's a commentary on the depersonalization of business, a complicated yet wonderfully sweet love story, and a movie with a surprisingly big heart.  And I love Renee Zellweger.  As far as I'm concerned, she - not Tom Cruise - was the star of this film.",1122854400,60,3608,4.620689655172414
168098,2,0800141741,"I waited nine years or so to watch ""Jerry Maguire"" in order to allow ""Show Me the Money"" mania to subside. I think we're almost there. Although, ""Jerry Maguire"" references are not completely gone (the ""you had me at fresh dough"" parody, for example.) Here's to hoping that the ad is just a local thing but I'm not sure.

I still can't hear the ""Secret Garden"" song without my skin crawling due to its astounding overplay in this movie's heyday.

To make matters worse, this movie is absolutely unworthy of its place in pop culture. I remember how endearing Jonathan Lipnicki was in the 30-second previews, but watching him at feature-length is excruciating--like slicing yourself with a dull and rusty razorblade.

I don't know how to feel about what the film's success did for its cast and crew. On the one hand, it did solidify Cameron Crowe's reputation and cleared the way for him to make ""Almost Famous."" On the other hand, it made Cuba Gooding Jr. a star, which was a crime against humanity. This role made and ruined his career at the same time. It is one of his most annoying performances, and that's saying something. Worse, because it was a hit it is what most of his subsequent performances were modeled after.

""Jerry Maguire"" was definitely not worth the wait. Rent ""Almost Famous"" instead... By the way, it took every ounce of restraint I possess not to title this review ""show me the movie."" You're welcome. Besides, it would have been counter-productive. It wasn't a total loss; there were some laugh-outloud moments hence the second star. Still, my expectations were inflated, and that is not my fault. Blame it on ""show me the money"" (thank God they didn't use that title for a sequel, I'm surprised they resisted the urge.)",1116115200,,1742,4.739273927392739
168099,4,0800141741,"I am not a Tom Cruise fan, but even with that hurdle, this is still a smart and sassy comedy from 1996 well worth savoring thanks to director-writer Cameron Crowe. Regardless of my reservations about Cruise, he is ideally cast in the title role, an egocentric and mega-successful sports agent, who gets to hang out with celebrity athletes within a lifestyle that seems to epitomize the Peter Pan syndrome. That is, until Jerry reaches an epiphany about the excesses of his business and after crafting a poorly received ""mission statement"", is given the boot. Followed only by the nave accountant Dorothy Boyd, he starts a new management company, and due to the machinations of a slimy fellow agent at his now-former company, Jerry is left with just one athlete to represent, the self-absorbed, second-tier football player Rod Tidwell.

From this premise comes a lightweight though insightful character study of people who are not able to be themselves among others and cannot seem to find what they want without the help of someone else telling them what they want. It appears Jerry's initial epiphany is more hard-earned than he expected, and the movie spends most of its running time exploring how he comes to realize its meaning in his life. What is great about the movie is the incisive, thoughtful dialogue peppered with nineties catchphrases that seem to live on eternally...""Show me the money!""...""You had me at hello""...""I love the man he wants to be""...""Help me help you""...and one of the best compliments I've heard though odd coming out of Cruise's mouth: ""That's not a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie."" There is a human scale to all the dilemmas in the movie which I find enveloping in unexpected ways, and characters you think you will loathe (including Cruise's) surprise you. Everything revolves tightly around the small triumphs and failures, and within the intimacy defined by Crowe, the humor and pain of the characters' lives seems authentic and often funny. And the humor is constant and more of the relatable recognition variety than laugh-out-loud silliness.

Of course, it helps to have a great cast, and the movie benefits from one beginning with what I still feel is Cruise's career-best performance. Not a hugely versatile actor though dedicated, he portrays a character that fits the odd contours of his movie personality...brash, ambitious, emotionally frustrated, frat-house mindset evolving toward begrudging maturity. Beating out the likes of Parker Posey and Mira Sorvino for the role of Dorothy, relative newcomer Ren&eacute;e Zellweger portrays this epiphany-seeking single mother with her unique sensibilities and squeaky-voiced defiance. They have a genuine chemistry that I hope they repeat sometime soon. Playing Tidwell looks to be Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s career high-water mark, as he has not done anything remotely as interesting since then. He is flashy, funny, even cockier than Maguire and a believably devoted husband and father. Regina King expertly plays his sassy, negotiation-driving wife Marcee. My favorite scenes may be between Dorothy and her sister Laurel, played in typically witty fashion by Bonnie Hunt. Even the requisite ""cute kid"", Jonathan Lipnicki, is funny without being overly precious. Truth be told, a couple of the ancillary characters don't work as well - Todd Luiso as Chad the Nanny, a slacker, and Kelly Preston as Jerry's high maintenance &uuml;ber-bitch fianc&eacute;e. But these are minor flaws. Everything gets wrapped up perfectly, as you would suspect, but the journey there is unpredictable and wonderfully poignant.

168100,4,0800141741,"Winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), and nominated for five additional Oscars including Best Picture, Jerry Maguire burst onto the cinema landscape in late 1996, and it's famous tagline ""Show me the money!"" took the pop culture by storm (you still hear it used today). Tom Cruise provides one of the best performances of his career, and Renee Zellweger became a household name after her supporting role as Dorothy Boyd. Overall, Jerry Maguire is a fun, romantic comedy about an idealistic career man who finds a way to live his life differently...

Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent extraordinaire with one of the largest sports agent conglomerates in the world. But when one of his clients becomes injured, Jerry is forced to rethink the purpose of his career and his life. The result is a new and idealistic corporate mission statement flatly rejected by his colleagues. With the people around him unwilling to change, Jerry Maguire quits and strikes out on his own. He attempts to energize more people to follow him to the new company he's going to create, but only one employee bites - office secretary Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger) who is secretly in love with Jerry. (This is a very humorous scene where Jerry Maguire goes off the deep end).

When he quits, Jerry hopes to retain a number of his high profile clients, but they all bail on him - all except one, Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). Tidwell is an egomaniacal, sub-par receiver in the final year of his current contract. Desperate, Maguire pleads over the phone with Tidwell, hoping the man with retain his services. This scene spawns the famous line ""Show me the money!"" which Tidwell forces Maguire to say over and over...

As Maguire and Dorothy Boyd struggle to hold the new business together, their relationship grows into a romantic one, which in the end results in another famous line from the film. Will their relationship hold up under the pressures of the new enterprise? Will Tidwell's career pay off for his family and the new Jerry Maguire agency? It's a lot of fun finding out...

One of the surprise films of 1996, Jerry Maguire is that rare film that appeals to both women for its romance, men for its sports themed plot, and the Academy Awards for its memorable performances and ingenious portrayal of strong interpersonal conflicts. A great number of mid-1990's sports figures make cameos throughout the film, lending credibility to the setting and believability to Tidwell's character. There's a reason this film won so many awards and raked in widespread critical acclaim. It simply appeals to large audience on many different levels. That's why Jerry Maguire is a definite must-see film. If you haven't seen it yet, this is a great one to rent one night and relax to...

You sit there and gain an intuiutive belief that Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruuise) is an ass just because of his initial presentation in the movie.  Then comes a truly entertaining whirlwind swing of events in the film when the concrete basis that defines Jerry as a person in the movie, his career as a sports agent, his taken away when he is fired. The rest of the film is spent with Cruise's character struggling to succeed in the face of all adversity with the assistance of Rene Zellweger who plays a single mom, who despite other beliefs follows him into this void that he created.  The romantic collusion between these two characters because there seems to be almost something wrong throughout until  Jerry changes himself in, what makes many great movies, a charcter revelation that redefines his existence.  Throughout the film underrated football player Rod Tillman (Cube Gooding Jr.) is not only a comedic support and dramatic inspiration, but part of the reason you just have to love this film.  To me this was maybe the most profound work Cuba has ever done because he seemed to me to verge beyond his classic acting form and ascended to a higher level.

168124,4,0800141741,"""Jerry Maguire"" is a movie that combines drama, romance, comedy and sports, and it does it in a very good way. This film was Renee Zelweger's commercial breakthrough, and one of Tom Cruise's most acknowledged performances, he got an Academy nomination, and he won a Golden Globe Award, thanks to his charismatic portrayal of a passionate, intense sports agent.

""Jerry Maguire"" is entertaining at all time, the characters make an emotional connection with the audience thanks to good performances and a solid script, written by the director Cameron Crowe. The movie takes a look to the world of the sports agents, a world where the money means everything.

But ""Jerry Maguire"" wouldn't have been so appealing without good performances, and this movie has a solid cast. Of course Cruise plays the main character in the film, but Renee delivered a charming, lovable performance as Jerry's love interest. Her character, Dorothy, gives patient and strength to Jerry.

Jonathan Lipnicki played the role of Ray Boyd (Dorothy's child), and he did a good job, usually child actors are annoying and bad actors, but Jonathan did a great job. Cuba Gooding Jr, played the best role of his career in this movie, he is a charismatic and emotional football player, he has the talent, but he lacks the intelligence to be a great player.

168126,5,0800141741,"Jerry Maguire should have won the Best Film Academy Award for 1996. Rock?n?roller Cameron Crowe, who wrote Fast Times At Ridgemont High for Rolling Stone, infuses Maguire with some terrific musical selections, including The Who?s raucous version of ""Magic Bus"" from the ""Live at Leeds"" album. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is over-the-top, although an Oscar performance I do not believe he delivers. That being said, the film breaks some major rules of the American screenwriting paradigm.

 First of all, Maguire's character arc is all in the beginning. Jerry (Tom Cruise, loosely playing superagent Leigh Steinberg) ""grows a conscience"" in the film's opening sequence, proposing that his company take on fewer clients. Most films are about the main character arriving at this kind of revelation over a two-hour period.

 The second fault that Jerry Maguire must overcome is the goal of its main characters, which is to make money. We are asked to feel sorry for Jerry because he is fired, but here is a guy who has made a ton of dough and possesses a law degree. His only client is Arizona Cardinals ""shrimp"" wide receiver Rod Strickland (Gooding). The leap of faith includes the audience?s requirement of empathizing with Strickland, who is on the cusp of stardom playing in a small media market, carries a big attitude, and bitches about money from beginning to end. He is offered a four-year, $1.7 million deal by the club, and acts as if it is chicken feed. This begs the questions: How much money would he earn if he was not a pro football player, why are the Cardinals responsible for his never having to work after retirement, and couldn't you make do with 1.7 mil? When Strickland leads the Cardinals into the Play-Offs with a big catch to beat Dallas, he is rewarded with a four-year, $11.7 million deal. Conversely, in today?s financial sports climate, that is not all that much.

 Another hurdle the film is forced to climb is the passive aspect of its star (Cruise) when the going gets tough. Strickland appears to be paralyzed after his spectacular touchdown grab, but Jerry is a helpless by-stander who can only serve platitudes in his cell phone conversation with Rod's bitchy wife, Marcy. The star is supposed to be the guy who does something to save the day.

 The real story of Jerry Maguire is the love interest, Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellwegger) and her adorable son, Ray. She shows loyalty to Jerry, is rewarded with marriage to Tom Cruise, who finally does something when he decides, months after the ceremony, to fall in love with his wife.

 The scene-stealer in Maguire, aside from Ray, is Jay Mohr as Bob Sugar, Jerry's smarmy agent/protege/nemesis. This was the first time I ever saw Mohr and I felt stardom was his, but it never quite came to him. He reminds me of Dennis Leary. If Jay is in it, I'll watch it, but his movies are not blockbusters and his TV shows get canceled. Mohr is a comic genius who, when he guest-hosts the Jim Rome Show, is rail-splitting funny. He did a sequence on Rome as ""Slam Man"" where he was talking about ""if the Yankees play the Mets in the Series it's gonna be?"" and he started to riff off movie lines: ""Waddaya all know about death"" (Berenger in ""Platoon""), ""going up the river in Apocalypse Now?"" that was insane.

 Maguire hit home with me particularly because I was Jerry Maguire, absent the happy ending. I was once a sports agent with one client (a Pittsburgh Pirate outfielder), who in the end lost the client (and big commissions) as a result of my business partner's obfuscations. A few years ago the player was in the news for bygamy when he put a gun in the mouth of his second ""wife"" and told her ""I'll O.J. you."" None of this surprised me. When I ""handled"" this character, we had to fly his women from one National League city to another under the radar of his real wife. We provided him our calling card so his calls to his women were not traced to his room or cell phones. Pirate wives were getting suspicious, calling various National League hotels to get their husband's phone records for ""tax purposes."" The player thought we were golden for keeping his activities underground. All in all, I am not proud of my participation in these sordid activities, but this is what agents do. Pro sports is a morally grimy business.

 In my case, I did not get the girl or the coin, but I got the kwon. My failure as an agent led to the priceless realization that a writing career is what really makes me happy! Despite its flaws, Jerry Maguire is a highly entertaining, realistic story, and one of the top sports films ever made.

168130,3,0800141741,"Like ""Vanilla Sky,"" Cameron Crowe's ""Jerry Maguire"" also tries to dispense some existential, quasi-Eastern wisdom...but with much more mixed results.  Much of the movie truly stretches the viewer's credulity; we are often left wondering, ""Is he serious?  Now WHY in the world would he/she do THAT?""  In other words, the characters are not well-developed enough to make their actions and decisions readily believable.  These 2-dimensional cardboard characters also have an unfortunate habit of delivering painfully florid and verbose pseudo-philosophical mini-soliloquys out of nowhere.
Cruise is not really as well-chosen for this character as he was in ""Vanilla Sky"" either---here, he just tries WAY too hard, ridiculously overacting almost in every scene.  His permanent, bread-and-butter Alpha-Male swagger never leaves him, even when he's supposed to be at rock-bottom, like at a scene when he shows up at Zelleger's house drunk after losing both his job and his fiance in the same day.
Then there is the romance between Cruise and Zelleger's characters, which is the main box-office draw of this film, and its most cringe-triggering device.  This part of the script, even more so than the rest of the film, must've been directly written by a bunch of focus groups...it includes just about every abominably cheesy, tear-jerking, schmaltzy cliche in the book.  Ruthlessly and shamelessly manipulative, it almost destroys the rest of the film, which is actually not so bad.
The Designated Irresistible Kid who plays Zelleger's son IS truly adorable and would've put Maculay Culkin out of a work had he been born about a decade earlier.

This is one of the three movies (along with ""A League of Their Own"" and ""A Few Good Men"") that is on cable TV every four and a half minutes, so there's no need to actually purchase it.  But I promise you that if you watch it two or three times, IT WILL MESS WITH YOUR MIND (in a good way).
Without a doubt, this is one of the top ten movies of the '90's, and one of those brilliant flicks you probably won't ""get"" until several years after you view it.",1075334400,,905,4.213872832369942
168153,5,0800141741,"This is a rather profound movie in two respects.  First off, it's (basically) a sports movie, but can be described as a chick flick as well.  Take a good look around the DVD stores:  won't find too many hybrids like that!
Secondly, the protaganist is a sports agent, and yet he is actually redeemable.  This is extraordinarily remarkable as it's nearly as difficult as making a movie where a loan shark is a hero.  Come to think of it, I should say that making a movie where a loan shark is a likeable character is nearly as difficult as making one where a sports agent is a good guy!
Nevertheless, they pull it off.  Tom Cruise plays an agent whose conscience actually(!) gets the better of him (gasp, sigh!).  He begins to think in terms of what's best for his clients instead of merely how he can use them to maximize the size of his wallet.
The ultra-adorable Renee Zelwegger plays the one person in the office who stands by him against all the other pernicious sports agents.  Cuba Gooding Jr. rounds out the cast as the one athelete who retains the agent after the rest of his life has fallen apart.
If you're looking for a feel-good movie, this one is a light-hearted one with a lot of class.  If you like both sports movies and romantic comedies, I can't see how you would not enjoy this feature!",1073001600,3,1304,4.422594142259414

In that respect, most people would rather have the obvious served up to them.  Two good examples come to mind: ""There's Something about Mary"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"".  To it's credit, ""Jerry McGuire"" doesn't get into that sort of slapstick humor.
Like any good story, there's some meaning behind ""Jerry McGuire"".  It was refreshing to see a romantic comedy like this without having to put up with a lot of cross-generational garbage that inevitably gets injected into most films of this type so that the studios and their stockholders can make a quick buck.",1069804800,4,777,4.819548872180451

168158,5,0800141741,"A moving triumphant movie about personal growth and awakening, JERRY MAGUIRE has got several scenes guaranteed to get you misty eyed...not out of sorrow but out of joy. Jerry (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent who suddenly has a realizaion: he's become another shark in a suit. He writes a mission statement (not a memo) on how to improve the business of being a sports agent: ""Fewer clients, less money."" This way they can give each athlete better personal attention. Seems simple enough (to me it makes perfect sense), but in this day of ME ME ME and MO' MONEY Jerry's humanitarian idea just doesn't fly, and he gets fired. He strikes out to form his own company, maintaining one client (Cuba Gooding Jr. in a funny, moving, charming performance) and one coworker (Rene Zellweger). The movie has several laugh-out-loud moments which draw you in to like the characters, then hits you with the drama. It's an effective one-two punch. Also charming is Rene's son, played by Jonathan Lipnicki. There are lots of movies that use cute kids to carry the movie; thankfully, this isn't one of them. Most notable here is Cruise, who has transformed from a pretty face box office smash guarantee into an actor of astonishing, moving depth. The scene at the end where he comes home to his wife has got to be one of the most touching and sweet in cinematic history. Some people may find it corny, but what can I say...those people aren't human beings. They are the same ones who rather watch movies like Collateral Damage or any other mindless action film with some testosterone-driven ""good guy"" blowing away countless ""bad guys."" In this day and age, I think it's time we gave peace a chance. I mean, I've watched my share of violent movies too, but come on people...show some sanity. Instead of watching Jason or Freddy carve their way through countless teenagers, do yourself a favor: watch JERRY MAGUIRE and realize what a great part of the human experience you've been missing.",1016236800,,1968,4.757309941520468

Cruise has perhaps his best role ever her, and he is certainly less smug and condescending than in many other roles.  Renee Zellweger broke through as an actress here and is really pretty enchanting.
The movie adeptly combines elements of drama and comedy and adresses the problems of being an alpha male in a world that increasingly values sensitivity.  The movie is the perfect example of a romantic movie that also is tremendously appealing to males.  Only drawback - there are no extras or director commentary!!  Given the talent of Cameron Crowe, this is a major debit as I would have greatly valued his commentary.",1012521600,,847,4.727891156462585
168171,5,0800141741,"By definition, and depending upon who you're talking to, ""Success"" can be measured in a number of different ways.  It's winning the competition, celebrating a Golden Wedding Anniversary or, to many, just making the most money.  The first two are absolutes; you win and you make it to number 50.  No gray areas.  If you're not dead, you're alive; you're either pregnant or you're not.  But in regards to that third item on the list, what are the parameters by which you measure that particular success?  Are there lines across which you will not step to make that extra buck?  Or do you do whatever it takes-- including selling your soul and sacrificing your very identity-- to make as much of the green as you can.  Is that success?  Or is that selling out.  Can there, in fact, be true success when ethics and integrity are absent?  It's the territory writer/director Cameron Crowe explores in ""Jerry Maguire,"" the hit 1996 film that landed him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, a Best Actor nomination for star Tom Cruise, and captured the award for Best Supporting Actor for Cuba Gooding Jr.
 Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a high-powered sports agent for a huge agency, handling a portfolio filled with high profile sports figures.  And the name of Jerry's game is money; he gets the big bucks for those he represents, he keeps them in the limelight and in the end pulls down some mighty big bucks for himself and the firm.  But at what price?  Who is Jerry Maguire, really?  Has he played the chameleon for so long as a means to an end that even he doesn't know who he is anymore?  Does he even consider it?  If he stopped to think about it, the answer would be a resounding ""No.""  But then something happens.  One night, he wakes up and happens to look at himself in the mirror, and for whatever reason, it suddenly dawns on him what a selfish, soulless, empty life he is leading.  So in the wake of this epiphany, he seizes the moment, sits down at his keyboard and hammers out a ""mission/morality statement,"" in which he reorganizes his entire approach to his career, including reestablishing parameters and setting new priorities making conscience, ethics and integrity his paramount concerns.  And while still riding the high of his nocturnal enlightenment, he goes to his office, makes copies of his statement and distributes it to the mailboxes of everyone from his boss on down.  Then he goes home and goes to bed.
 In the cold light of morning, however, he realizes what he's done and races to his office to avert disaster.  Too late.  He enters the room to a hail of praise and appreciation from his peers, but his boss is less enthusiastic.  It's no surprise to Jerry, then, when the big ""M"" his superiors are interested in turns out to be ""Money"" and not ""Morality,"" as in ""Money talks, Jerry walks.""  And just like that he's out the door.  But before he leaves, he vows to make it on his own.  He's up, he's positive, he has his statement-- and he doesn't have a clue what to do next.  What he does know is that the adventure of a lifetime is awaiting.  And the world is about to meet the ""real"" Jerry Maguire.
 Cameron Crowe made his debut as a writer/director with ""Say Anything"" in 1989, in which he first exhibited that keen insight into the human condition that has been one of the trademarks of his success as a filmmaker.  In ""Jerry Maguire"" he demonstrates again that acute sense of knowing what makes people tick, and leaves no doubt that he knows how to convey it to his audience.  Crowe's story, as well as the presentation, is original and imaginative, and he fills it with real characters involved in very real situations.  And it's the characters that really sell it, because these are three-dimensional people, not just cardboard cut-outs, and moreover, Cameron knows how to get the best out of his actors to really bring them to life.
 Tom Cruise was the perfect choice to play Jerry; he has the look, the energy and the talent to get inside this guy's skin and make him tick, and he successfully channels his natural exuberance into his character, tempering his performance just enough to make it really work.  An Oscar nomination does not come cheaply, and Cruise certainly deserved the one he received for his work here.
 Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance is deserving of the acclaim he received for it, as well.  As Rod Tidwell, the pro football player/client who sticks by Jerry and insists that he ""Show me the money!"" Gooding equals, if not surpasses Cruise's level of enthusiasm with a vibrant and rich portrayal that makes Rod one of his most memorable characters.  Like Cruise, Gooding is perfectly cast and points up, again, what an acute sense Cameron has for who and what will work to bring his story so convincingly to the screen.
 Not to be outdone by her co-stars, Renee Zellweger gives an endearing performance as the vulnerable but steadfast, single mom, Dorothy Boyd.  She's such a ""giving"" actor, and she endows Dorothy with a gentle, caring manner that expresses her deepest thoughts and feelings so well.  Her reaction, in the scene in which Jerry tells Dorothy-- with his back turned to her-- that he has broken up with his fiancee, Avery (Kelly Preston), is priceless, and alone makes this film worth watching (repeatedly).  Her work here is every bit as Oscar worthy as Cruise and Gooding's, and it's hard to understand why she was overlooked, as she is such a vital presence in this film.
 The supporting cast includes Jerry O'Connell (Frank), Jay Mohr (Bob Sugar), Bonnie Hunt (terrific in her role of Laurel Boyd, Dorothy's sister), Regina King (Marcee) and Jonathan Lipnicki, unforgettable as Dorothy's precocious son, Ray.  A triumph for Cameron Crowe, this movie is, indeed, magic.",1010966400,6,5754,4.719438877755511

168176,5,0800141741,"After 1992's relatively disappointing Singles, Cameron Crowe comes back strong with Jerry Maguire.  The film is a romantic comedy with the underpinning of how ethics and values are treated in today's society.  Tom Cruise stars as the title character who is a highly successful sports agent.  After a night of heavy drinking, he types up a mission statement that is a little too much for his firm.  He becomes a pariah in the company and eventually his one time protegee (Jay Mohr) tells him he's been fired.

Ms. Zellewiger has wholesome, girl next door looks and is sweet in her role.  Mr. Gooding is a whirling dervish in his role.  He is a ball of energy and the scene where he gets Jerry to shout ""show me the money"" became a major catch-phrase and part of the lexicon.

168177,5,0800141741,"If you aren't careful, you might enter ""predictability"" mode and let this entire movie slip right by you.  Don't.
Jerry Maguire begins where most movies end.  Often Hollywood shows our hero making his way through the world, compromising what his heart tells him to do for worldly success, until these two forces dramatically conflict and our hero says to himself ""Oh yeah, follow my heart"" and then lives happily ever after.  Jerry Maguire is ""Part 2"" for all these movies - it shows us just how difficult it actually is to follow our heart, especially in a world where no one else seems to.  The title character (played by Tom Cruise) is a highly successive sports agent - a field portrayed as more inhuman and slimy than selling cars or practicing law.  After Jerry announces his change of heart, his career slides slowly downward as his coworkers oust him, his clients desert him, and his fiancee leaves him.  Jerry is left with one fading, unpopular client, (Cuba Gooding Jr in an Oscar-winning, mesmerizing performance) and a rebound relationship his sole employee.  Jerry is fighting for his life.
This aspect of the movie is intense and engrossing.  These characters are the most fleshed out I've ever seen, with excellent acting and outstanding dialog.  However, this film also contains a romantic ""sub"" plot, which is powerful but ultimately unforfilling, perhaps by choice.  Renee Zellweger plays Maguire's instant wife, and is SO supporting, SO charming, SO beautiful, that I wished for a stronger resolution to their relationship than the movie gave me.  As the plot brings the wonderful main theme to a powerful close, it also tries to also wrap up the romance in an equally intelligent way, and I think the actors and even the writer/director (Cameron Crowe) tripped themselves up ever so slightly.  Maybe Crowe, Cruise, and Zellweger realized than even lovers don't live ""happily ever after"", and hesitate just enough to remind us of this.  The film is still a timeless classic, but doesn't end as saticfying as something like Casablanca.",972086400,,2053,4.9853372434017595

The story follows Jerry Maguire, played by Tom Cruise, falling from  grace working for a sports star agency when he has a flash of inspiration  and takes the moral high ground on the way people should be treat within  the company. His eventual rise to becoming a better person is aided from  the love of woman and her son and the realization that everyone who he  represents should be treated with the same respect.
The person that stole  the show for me was Cuba Gooding Jr. Every scene he was in made me laugh.  This was the first movie I had seen him in and thought he was a terrific  actor, deserved of the Oscar he won for Best Supporting Actor. The ""Show Me  The Money"" scene will have you in stitches.

168203,5,0800141741,"This film spoke to me in so many ways. It was almost as if ""Jerry Maguire"" had been written with me in mind.  From Jerry's epiphany at the start of the story through his struggle and eventual triumph over his  fear of intimacy, it all seemed to be drawn from my experiences. These are  the things that concern me every day.

Tom Cruise was beautiful. He  showed perfect acting the whole time. It is perhaps, the finest work so far  in his career. You could see every flicker of doubt and insincerity cross  his face. I was laughing out loud, then crying and then so tightly happy  that I forgot to breath. All of the other cast members seemed perfect as  well. I particularly liked the doubting, divorced but totally caring sister  Laurel. And let's not forget Dorothy's son Ray, what a little charmer.

The basic story is a simple one and yet it is fresh all the same.  One of the slogans that the promoters used was, ""A legend that became  a man"". For me, that is not a bad summary of the plot. Jerry is a  highly successful sports agent who has an attack of conscience which gets  him fired. He manages this rather early on in the film by writing a new  mission statement entitled, ""The things we think and do not say"",  which harks back in time to simpler days where a man's word was his bond.  As one of his work mates says, ""I give him a week"". Sure enough,  Jerry was doing a Lone Ranger in seven days. And as happens to so many of  us, this disaster turns out to be the best thing that could have happened  to him.

In the hectic moments as he tries tries to keep all his  clients he is tied up by one rather loud and demanding footballer. In the  end it is this one man who fills Jerry's client roster. Not to be daunted,  Jerry strides out into the land of cubicles and coffee machines and firmly  asks who would like to join him in exile.

Of course he is less  than overwhelmed by the response. Just as it looks like his only colleague  will be a gold fish, a young accounting clerk named Dorothy, who was  inspired by Jerry's mission statement, pipes up and falteringly joins the  crusade. Unfortunately she has a very young son named Ray and no other  means of support. This puts Jerry under a little more pressure than he  needed which is well illustrated when, before they even get out of the  building's elevator, Dorothy starts enquiring about her health plan.

But in the end Jerry finds a strength he didn't know he had, an  empathy he has never needed before, an integrity that used to be a handicap  and finally he finds the love of his life. If you dream about finding any  of these things in your own life I suggest you could do a lot worse than  following Jerry's example.",957657600,9,2697,4.296812749003984

Cameron Crowe has done really a wonderful piece of modern cinema. The characters are so real, and u can almost smell and touch the films atmosphere when watching it. Tom Cruise is acting with such a wild passion, that you just have to love him for that. He is acting a sport agent full of heart and soul. And Renee Zellweger, could there be any other so sweet, so tender and beautiful person like you in the world? Her role as Dorothy Boyd made me forget that she is even acting, and the part was truly made just for her.(The date scene makes me cry everytime, so pure happiness and feelings) Cuba Gooding jr. earned his first oscar. His character changes the life of Jerry Maguire in the film and does it with such of enthustiasm that you can just admire Rod Tidwells life, where every piece is in the right order. The little boy (Jonathan Lipnicki) is also awesome. All the actors/actresses are doing a good job. The biggest credit goes to the script by Crowe. It is very original and fresh indeed. Crowe has decided to concentrate mostly on characters and that is why I like this movie so much. This is the fist sports movie I have ever loved. Jerry Maguire is about people, who are just like we all. It is about the truth, love, respect and relationships...okay and about sports. Jerry Maguire works really well. The beautiful cinematography, editing and music makes the strong story and characters to look good. Yes I agree that it's very emotional, touchy and sweet, but why should we deny that we need that sometimes. I can honestly say that this world seems to be so much better place to live in after seeing Jerry Maguire. The mix of tiers and smile on your face tells the rest.

But I have to say, Cuba's got the hottest body ever featured on  film!...Lord have mercy!",948931200,2,396,4.628571428571429
