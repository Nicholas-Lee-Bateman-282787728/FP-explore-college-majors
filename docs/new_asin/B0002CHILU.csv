8025959,1,B0002CHILU,I figured the transfer would be bad....but it was SO bad you could not even play the three movies thru because of a defective DVD or bad transfer. Movies kept freezing and locking up.  I cleaned the disc and tried to play it on other players.  Wanted Deadly Impact so got the Amazon video version.  Save yourself trouble.  The other two movies..what I was able to see of them were bad.  Just get Deadly Impact on video on demand.,1513900800,,429,4.379746835443038
8025960,2,B0002CHILU,"THIS IS YET ANOTHER DISMAL COLLECTION FROM VINTAGE MOVIE CLASSICS. THIS TIME, WE GET A DVD OF 3 MOVIES THAT STAR FRED WILLIAMSON. OUT OF THESE 3 FILMS, ONLY 1 OF THEM WAS ANY GOOD. HERE'S MY OPINIONS OF ALL THE MOVIES ON HERE:

''DEADLY IMPACT''-3 STARS-THE ONLY DECENT MOVIE ON THIS DVD. A COP [BO SVENSON, LOOKING LIKE A DIRTY HARRY WANNABE] CHASES TWO CRIMINALS WHO'VE STOLEN CASINO MONEY FROM A HACKER. EVEN THOUGH THE ACTING IS BAD, THE ACTION MAKES UP FOR IT. I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS IS ON THIS DVD, BEING THAT THIS IS NOT FRED WILLIAMSON'S MOVIE [HE PLAYS A SUPPORTING ROLE AND IS NOT VERY ACTIVE IN THIS FILM]. BUT, IT'S STILL A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN THEM OTHER 2 FILMS.

''DEATH JOURNEY''-1 STAR-THIS EXTREMELY LOW BUDGET ACTIONER HAS FRED WILLIAMSON [PLAYING SHAFT WANNABE JESSE CROWDER] BEING PAID TO TRANSPORT A MAN ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO TESTIFY AGAINST A CRIME BOSS. ONLY PROBLEM IS IS THAT JESSE MUST PREVENT THE MAN FROM BEING KILLED ALONG THE WAY. VERY PREDICTABLE PLOT, POOR ACTING, POORLY FILMED ACTION SCENES, POOR PRODUCTION VALUES, JUST ALL AROUND POOR FILM.

''MEAN JOHNNY BARROWS''-1 STAR-A SOLDIER [FRED WILLIAMSON] IS DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED FOR STRIKING AN OFFICER. WHEN HE RETURNS HOME, HE FINDS IT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO GET A JOB AND BECOMES CAUGHT UP IN A MOB WAR. IT'S BORING AS HELL, IT'S TOO SLOW MOVING, THE ACTING IS HORRIBLE, AND THE WHOLE THING'S SO BAD, IT'S ALMOST FUNNY.

VINTAGE MOVIE CLASSICS NEEDS TO START PUTTING BETTER MOVIES ON THEIR DVDS. ALMOST ALL THE DVDS I BOUGHT FROM THEM ARE BAD.",1109030400,,1530,4.676579925650557
