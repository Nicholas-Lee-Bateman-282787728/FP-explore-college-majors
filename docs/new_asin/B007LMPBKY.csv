8519404,5,B007LMPBKY,"I've been a fan of Autopsy since right around the release of ""Severed Survival"". This is back when I used to discover bands by reading the thanks list from a tape or CD. If I remember correctly I found the name in the thanks list from my Pestilence ""Consuming Impulse"" tape and discovered that this was the Chris Reifert from Death's ""Scream Bloody Gore"", another one of my favorites. I was blown away by what I was hearing, especially with the slow and mid-tempo stuff. So catchy and so heavy it made me want to wreck shit. I loved ""Retribution for the Dead"" and ""Mental Funeral"" was a pure masterpiece. Out of all of the shows I've been to over the years I only got to see Autopsy once on the tour for ""Acts of the Unspeakable"", which I think was at the Roxy in Long Island.

I'm certainly glad to have Autopsy back and I was really looking forward to this DVD. I was afraid that this release was never going to see the light of day after my pre-orders had been canceled a couple of times. I'm impatient and the delay just made me want it more.

The DVD is contains an extensive interview with individual band members and other people from the scene. Although there is a lot of history shared here I would have liked to know more about the songs (where the ideas came from), where the concepts for the artwork came from etc. Overall, the interviews are informative and entertaining.

The concerts are also much better than what was available on the Dark Crusade DVD from 2006. The setlist from the Maryland Deathfest was awesome but note that the sound briefly cut out twice. The first time was before the show started and the next was during ""Pagan Savior"" I believe. Also, Eric Cutler's guitar was a little hard to hear, especially his solos, which is a shame because I enjoy is style.

The Extras menu contains a handful of music videos that I haven't had a chance to watch yet.

Overall this DVD is a must-have for fans of Autopsy and those of death metal in general. If you haven't discovered ""Severed Survival"" or ""Mental Funeral"" yet you are in for a treat. A lot of bands out there owe their musical careers to these guys and I owe them for providing me with years of listening pleasure.",1348704000,7,2197,4.4148148148148145
