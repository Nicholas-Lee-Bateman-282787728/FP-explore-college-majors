8232406,5,B00005TPLY,this is the best wrestling action i have ever seen every match from the beginning to end deserves 5* well except for the first one where mike awesome gets his leg stuck in the ropes. Definatly worth the money everymatch is 5* quality,1029196800,,233,4.441860465116279
8232407,5,B00005TPLY,"THE BEST FMW DVD EVER MADE! The matches were full length, they included some of FMW's best wrestlers, and they were full of action.
Mike ""Gladiator"" Awesome VS Kintaro (Yukihiro) Kanemura: 3 1/2 *
  This match was the worst on the disc, which makes it not bad. It was slow near the beginning when Awesome goes for  a tope suicida (he gets caught in the ropes). Awesome wins w/ an Awesome Bomb to Kanemura for the 1,2,3.
Mike ""Gladiator"" Awesome VS Masato Tanaka: 4 3/4 *
  2nd best on the disc. Sweet action (Awesome actually hits the tope suicida this time). Tanaka wins w/ a Roaring Elbow.
Masato Tanaka VS Mr. Gannosuke (Masashi Honda): 4 1/2 *
  Good match. Lots of blood. Sweet power moves (mostly powerbombs). Gannosuke wins w/ a Gannosuke Clutch (an armbar w/ waistlock into front rolling cradle w/ leg hook). Sweet pin.
Mr. Gannosuke VS Hayabusa (Eiji Ezaki): 5 *
  The best match I ever saw. Well fought and well thought out. Hayabusa wins w/ a Phoenix Splash (Twisting Senton into 450 splash).
Hayabusa VS Kodo (Hiromuchi) Fuyuki: 3 3/4 *
  Fuyuki wins w/ a stiff Lariat. Not the best match in the world.
  The extras are pretty good too. I didn't really watch Masato Tanaka VS Kanemura 'cuz it didn't sound very good. The Hayabusa VS Hisakatsu Oya match was OK.
  Overall, this DVD was great. A must buy.",1026000000,,1315,4.55982905982906
8232408,4,B00005TPLY,"The word about the horrible announcing on other FMW tapes , they are actually good this time and Lovranski doesn't look like such a hippie any more and there is not that many stupid replays as other tapes , anyways down to the matches:
1. Wing Kanemura vs. Mike Awesome (Title for title match)- This is a title unification match of Brass Knux title and Independent title. The beginning was pretty slow where mike gets his foot stuck in ropes and win beats on him and leg rest holds but later is where the real action starts, bloody,brutal,tables,chairs what a war. Great match
2. Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka-Amazing! if youve seen their matches in ECW like Heatwave 98 or N2R 99' in my opinion this one blows it away! Even crazier spots with tables in this one.
3. Masato Tanaka vs. Mr. Ganosuke- WOW, a bloody sickening war where Ganosuke at one point takes the jagged part of a broom stick starts stabbing Tanaka in the arm to make him bleed. Exciting match in all .
4. Mr. Ganosuke vs. Hayabusa- I thought it would be better by the buildup of old best college friends , anyways pretty nice moves here.
5. Hayabusa vs. Kodo Fuyuki- Worst match on the tape , too many rest holds, Hayabusa pulls off some nice aerial moves to give the match some stars and Kodo almost kills Hayabusa with huge impact moves but what a horrible ending. anyways
Overall a great compilation but they should have put a bonus match anyways great FMW action. Highly recommended to anyone!",1024444800,,1467,4.539622641509434
8232409,5,B00005TPLY,"You'll want to enter the asylum all over again after watching ""FMW: Rule the Asylum""! This blood-curdling collection of 5 complete matches follows the brutal history of the FMW Double Championship, which includes the Independent World Title and the Brass Knux Title. While the announcing team is very uninspiring, the action in the matches will keep you on your feet.
1. Wing Kanemura vs. Mike Awesome (Title for title match)- This match started out slowly, because Awesome got stuck in the ropes for what felt like an hour. Afterwards, though, the match explodes with flying bits of tables, collapsing chairs and spine-cracking power bombs echoing across the arena. Awesome's not that awesome here, since he does little of his famous aerial maneuvers. Still, we're off to a good start. ****1/2
2. Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka- Oh, oh. If you've bought the FMW compilation ""The Enforcer"", then you already have seen this match before. For those of you who haven't, this is easily the most memorable display of chair/table bumps in FMW's history by far. Awesome once again lays a hellacious beating on Tanaka that has chair seats flying off of Tanaka's head and a power bomb that sends Tanaka through two tables. Tanaka, though, shows off his godlike endurance by coming back, smashing Awesome through a table outside the ring, and sending the man out to dry with potent clotheslines! *****+ for newbies, ""Enforcers"" fans, press fast forward.
3. Masato Tanaka vs. Mr. Ganosuke- WHOA! I am amazed all the way by this match. As Dan Lovranski properly puts it, these two men are gladiators! Ganosuke does some excruciatingly mean stuff on Tanaka, busting the champ's head wide open, throwing him through a table from a second story, even stabbing his arm with a pointed broom stick! Tanaka still doesn't disappoint with his endurance and skillful mat wrestling, but it IS Ganosuke who is the real star of this match. That perfectionist of sadism will be a cult legend in the world of FMW! This match is my personal favorite in the tape. *****+
4. Mr. Ganosuke vs. Hayabusa- One of the favorite matches among FMW fans, this puts the sadistic champ against his old friend, the beautifully skilled aerial artist known best as Hayabusa, ""The Falcon"". While Ganosuke does practice his infamous wear-downs and pile-drivers, Hayabusa fights back with moonsaults, Firebird splashes and the legendary Phoenix Splashes (a hybrid of Tumbleweed Moonsault and 455-Splash). Hayabusa practices so many air moves here, you'd think he can fly. Well, maybe he doesn't, but this match is still wrestling heaven. *****
5. Hayabusa vs. Kodo Fuyuki- The weakest and last match on the tape chronicles the end of the Double Championship in FMW. The aerial Hayabusa takes to the air against a hulking juggernaut named Fuyuki. While Hayabusa once again leaps off the Falcon's Nest to plant punishment on Fuyuki, the burly challenger is to too strong, if not too clever, to fall for those tricks again. The match's primary weak point is its uneven pace, but it has more decent wrestling than any other match on the tape. This is still a recommended match. ****
Want proof of how great FMW is? Then get this tape and see how tough it is to ""Rule the Asylum"", and be glad you're only watching it at that!",1020211200,,3273,4.899099099099099
8232410,4,B00005TPLY,"one thing annoyed me and that was the commentary, it was [bad]. The guys just don't have a clue what they're on about and also this is dubbed over the crowd and weapon shots which really take away the atmosphere. They sell every move like it was foley going off the cell at KOTR 98. Luckily the main 5 matches are in their entirity. There are 2 bonus matches in highlight form without the commentary and a neat photo gallery which leads to biographies on the wrestlers
Match 1: Mike Awesome Vs WING Kanamure ***
Decent enough but is a slow started because of awesome getting his knee caught in the ropes. Some decent table and chair spots.
Match 2: Mike Awesome Vs Masato Tanaka ****
Great match with all the usual table smashing and chair bits.
Match 3: Masato Tanaka Vs Mr Ganosuke ***
Decent match with alot of stabbing using a broom handle.
Match 4: Mr Ganosuke Vs Hayabusa **1/2
Nice aerial spots but not much violence.
Match 5: Hayabusa Vs Kodo Fuyuki *
I didn't enjoy this match at all. Too many submission holds. When Hayabusa was in control it picked up a bit but nothing to get excitied about.
bonus matches
Hayabusa vs. Hisakatsu Ooya
Masato Tanaka vs. Kintaro Kanemura
 still worth getting for the decent matches",1019174400,,1224,4.538461538461538
