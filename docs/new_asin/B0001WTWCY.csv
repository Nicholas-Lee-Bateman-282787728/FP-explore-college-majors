2034777,1,B0001WTWCY,"Someone owes me three bucks for renting this movie, excuse me, waste of time and money. I'll give it to you, the trailer made me think I was going to be actually watching a comedy. And Anthony Anderson is usually a bright spot in any film. Poor Anthony couldn't save this dog. I was dismayed when my husband and I rented this movie and discovered that the best and only jokes of the film were shown on the trailers. They were also shown fairly early in the film too. So we basically sat watching the movie in dead silence. I began daydreaming to entertain myself until my husband begged me to turn it off. Yep, it was that bad. We can only stand about 45-50 minutes of crap at at a time. Please save your money and buy food or gas or a better movie. If I've saved just one person money from staying away from this movie, than I feel I've done my good deed for the day.",1092009600,5,868,4.1420118343195265
2034778,2,B0001WTWCY,"I had nothing to do and it was raining.  I knew Anthony Anderson and Eddie Griffin are pretty funny, so why not.  The movie was cute and it did have it's funny moments.  Don't buy it, but it will make you chuckle.",1089763200,2,213,4.023809523809524
2034779,5,B0001WTWCY,"i rented this on a boring friday night because Anthony Anderson , and Eddie Griffen were in it. I was pleasently surprised to find a comic gem that is so funny and has a cute message.",1088899200,,183,4.111111111111111
2034780,1,B0001WTWCY,"There's a long-standing rule of thumb in the motion picture business that the more writers who have a hand in making a movie the worse that movie will turn out to be.  In the case of ""My Baby's Daddy,"" it took four scenarists (who shall remain nameless) to come up with this excruciatingly bad multi-ethnic rip off of ""Three Men and a Baby.""  The plotting comes direct from the TV sitcom factory: three bachelors, who have never grown up into responsible adulthood, simultaneously find themselves the fathers of three adorable infants.  Naturally, after much initial bumbling and stumbling in the ways of parenthood, the three men learn what the true definition of manhood is.
Though the movie has some fun lampooning racial and ethnic stereotypes, the humor is generally so bland, broad and formulaic that any promise the movie offers that it might somehow qualify as satire quickly evaporates.  Instead, the movie goes all soft and gooey, trying to get the audience to coo over the cute toddlers and sigh at the sight of three grown men who are themselves cooing over their toddlers.
Considering the material that's been handed them, one hesitates to be too harsh on the actors who find themselves trapped in this mess.  However, because of guilt by association, the only people who escape entirely unscathed are the toddlers themselves, since they are clearly the only ones here still under the age of consent.",1088380800,6,1413,4.920168067226891
2034781,5,B0001WTWCY,"I keep reading reviews saying this movie sux, but in reality it doesn't. Ok, so we've all heard some of the humor, but for the most part this is just a solid comedy. Its funny seein Eddie Griffin play the most grown up out of the three guys, and when isn't Anthony Andersen funny? The white dude ain't too bad either. Anyways, I don't see why this is getting such bad reviews, Barbersop did all right and i like this movie better.
I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have some laughs, or is just having a bad day, and needs it brightened up.",1087948800,4,551,4.2075471698113205
2034782,1,B0001WTWCY,"I Like the Cats in the Film&the Ladies in the Film was solid for my eyes but as far as watching this Film that couldn't make up it's mind if it wanted to be""How to be a Player"" or ""Daddy Day care""? Forgetaboutit.save your money.it has a few aight scenes here&there but on a whole it's a lemon.the best part for me was the kid playing little 2Pac in the mini Low-rider.",1086998400,,368,4.125
2034783,2,B0001WTWCY,"If you were expecting a Daddy Day Care sort of movie well you'll be disappointed.  Just the title alone I wasn't really expecting this movie to be on a Friday or Barbershop 1 type level but I was expecting it to be a little more funny than it was.  It had some cute moments and if not for Method Man playing the crazy cousin ""No Good"", John Amos (Good Times) playing his typical hilarious father figure role, and Paula Jai Parker (The original Friday) playing her usual ghetto fabulous roles, it probably would have easily have gotten 0 stars.  However, the fact that the movie was actually clean, and the comedy very tame to the point where I could let my 9 year old watch it, I won't complain too bad.  The fact that the message of the movie was to show grown men to take better care of their responsibility as parents was not lost on me as well which saved me from completely trashing the movie.",1086652800,,898,4.3273809523809526

I thought from the cast this movie would be hilarious, but it's not. It has a soft pretty much clean cut plot. There wasn't much to the movie, but it was still a decent movie overall. I would definitely suggest it as a rental. If your looking for the familiar antics of Eddie, Method, and Anthony, you might be disappointed.",1086220800,,434,4.304878048780488
2034785,1,B0001WTWCY,"This movie is never funny. It is never intelligent. It is not worth the time it takes to watch. It is an insult to intelligence. It is a waste of film. It is a ridiculous waste altogether. I don't have much respect for Eddie Griffin, after ""DysFunKtional Family,"" but Anthony Anderson and Michael Imperioli are better than this.

2034830,2,B0001WTWCY,"Urban comedy and I, we just don't get along for the most part.  We had our rare share of enjoyments, hanging at the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbershop/dp/B00006RVJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbershop</a>&nbsp;together and having fun dissing people at the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/CB4/dp/B0000714BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">CB4</a>, but we otherwise&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/roll-bounce/dp/B000BTITFI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">roll bounce</a>&nbsp;to our separate ways.  ""My Baby's Daddy"" isn't gonna bring us back in pairs, and in fact shows why I don't feel attached to urban comedy.  It's often being obnoxious, ignores fleshing its own stories, and doesn't bother abolishing expectations to makes its jokes original and truly hilarious; it's very two-dimensional, no way around it.

""My Baby's Daddy"" is urban comedy at a mildew state.  The film has farts jokes for no reason besides having them, it incorporates the played-out-to-death white characters pretending to be black (and leads to a lousy punchline that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seth-Green-did-better/dp/B001CY5MZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seth Green did better</a>), blatant stereotypes (herro Asian shopkeepers), and a nerd being taught to look fly and be the embarrassment to the whole neighborhood and my eyes.  Poorly delivered, unnecessary, offbeat, and dated, the movie's humor is like used diaper: it stinks. Speaking of diapers, the babies doesn't seem nothing more than plot devices just to distinguish a premise for guys like Anderson, Griffith, and Imperioli.  They're only apparent in two misguided scenes, one of which has the babies escape from the house like they're spies; I know the scene is meant to have the fathers become better parents, but the way it was set-up was ridiculous.  However, that isn't half as ludicrous as the scene in with Eddie Griffin's character Lonnie had a dinner for two and saw two babies talk to him; there is no point in having such a bizarre scene, he wasn't drunk, it was out-of-place and the effects to make the babies talk look ugly.

I don't expect much from the cast, especially Eddie Griffith who's typically as funny as warm milk, but I do wonder why Michael Imperioli is involved in such a film.  Part of me feels bad for him, it seems as though outside ""The Sopranos, he's been getting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-string/dp/B00002RAO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a string</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/of-bad/dp/B001XRLWLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">of bad</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/luck/dp/B001QOGYAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">luck</a>. His performance in this film wasn't really up to snuff, but then again, the characters they're portraying are basically obnoxious, and the women they've been knocking up range from being unlikable, offensive, and unrealistic.

To be fair, ""My Baby's Daddy"" is not nearly as bad as ""Norbit"".  It had a couple of hateful side characters like Rolanda, the mother of Lonnie's baby, but she not as frequent as Rasputia was in that Eddie Murphy disaster so I'm not bothered throughout the viewing.  At least this movie tried to have a sympathetic touch with the lead characters' growth and the story mostly stayed grounded...until it got to the absurd epilogues that had me rolling my eyes (how is 'Mofo Dojo' different from Tae Kwon Do?).  Nevertheless, the movie tried too hard to be silly, and it ended up doing a poor job as an immature comedy and a coming-of-age parenthood tale.  Comedy may be subjective, but it should never be boring.",1275264000,,3854,6.441860465116279
2034831,3,B0001WTWCY,"My Baby's Daddy is a noble attempt at a comedy about fatherhood and responsibility. I can't beat up on this movie; it's not that Bad. My Baby's Daddy isn't the funniest movie, but at least its heart was in the right place. I give props to everyone for at least trying to make a film showing black men taking charge of their lives. Thanks to the heart and strong efforts of the cast and crew My Baby's Daddy overcomes its production obstacles and is overall a watchable entertaining movie. Mad props to Eddie Griffin and co for showing black men in a positive light and a balanced picture of black life in the ghetto. We need more efforts like this.

The story follows three lifelong Philadelphia friends who are just coasting through life. Coincidentally their three girlfriends get pregnant and have their babies at the same time and give birth at the same time. From there we have hi-jinx and humor as the men learn moderation and adjust their quest for their dreams to fit their changing lives. The story has a happy ending that will leave the viewer satisfied.

Production values on this movie are solid. The camera work is great and the editing is tight. Scenes transition into one another seamlessly, unlike some of those big budget action movies I've watched(*cough Daredevil, X2, X3, Cough). You feel like you're in the Philadelphia neighborhood hanging out with the fellas. Even though six writers worked on this screenplay the story is tight and cohesive with solid dialogue and a few funny lines.

The acting here is pretty good, everyone does make an effort to make their characters convincing. Eddie Griffin, Anthony Anderson and Michael Imperioli are solid as the three dads. Method Man is hilarious for the short time he's onscreen. Bai Ling is very good as Anderson's girlfriend. She steals most of the scenes she's in and is often funnier than the guys in some cases. John Amos makes a great cameo as Uncle Bernie.

My Baby's Daddy is worth a rental at best. If you want an interesting study of black men and relationships, pick up How U like me Now. (Yeah, I keep pushing that movie in every review, but this extremely underrated film is THAT good.)",1149465600,3,2167,4.6947368421052635
