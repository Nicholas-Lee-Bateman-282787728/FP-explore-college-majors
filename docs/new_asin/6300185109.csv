7804337,1,6300185109,"I tried to play the tape for the first time ever today for my college theatre appreciation class and it could not play at all. I even tried it in two seperate VCR's. It played with serious tracking problems and slowly lost speed and then completely stopped playing altogether after about 2 minutes. I was really, really looking forward to watching this with my class.",1366675200,,367,4.661538461538462
7804338,5,6300185109,"I have never seen this version of the play. Too bad its not available on DVD. I think that classics should be seen in as many versions as possible, just like operas should be heard sung by different singers. Interpretation, that's the key.",1336003200,2,239,4.5813953488372094
7804339,5,6300185109,I have been looking for this for years. When will they release it on dvd? The vhs versions sold on amazon are much too high.,1316390400,4,124,4.0
7804340,5,6300185109,"This is the performance of All My Sons to own since the play is done in its entirety, unlike the watered down 1948 film version where the role of Kate Keller is reduced to tatters.  Here the play takes on full dimensions buoyed no doubt by the extraordinary performances of a cast consumed by their work.  Special note must be given to Michael Learned who brings such power and intensity to the mother, she transcends her own mastery.  And as the son of Steve Deever, the former partner of Joe Keller who is still serving prison time, Zselko Ivanek's George is a small gem.  The vhs may be pricey but worth every penny.  This is a production Arthur Miller would have cheered for.",1044835200,12,679,4.487804878048781
7804341,5,6300185109,"I rented this movie basically on a whim, and I was schocked by how good it was in all aspects.  The play, Miller's first hit, is not just the sign of a young playwright's beginning as a true artist, it is a typical example of  his psychologically probing work.  This would be the crowning acheivement  of many lesser playwrights careers.  This is a play about comming to terms  with the past, and how difficult that becomes as time passes.  It is also a  play about the role of the family and one's responsability to it.  (Sounds  like Death of a Salesman, but it ain't.)  The performances are strong in  all accounts, illustrating the many facits and layers of Miller's play.  No  one performer can really be singled out because they were all amazing.  The  direction and technical aspects or the production are up to par with the  rest of the ""movie.""  This is a gem of American theatre, and  should the genre.",963360000,6,912,4.518518518518518
