8433165,3,B004KNO77K,"I'll say this first: I enjoyed the movie.

The story was very good and was well developed in how it led to the ending. Also there were some aspects of Malay culture such as the sorcerer (ahli-sihir) and the amulet (jimat/azimat) that granted immunity of the wearer to weapons that I found interesting.

Though it could have been better in some areas particularly in the cheesy acting of some of the supporting cast.  Then there is the issue of the film's Historical accuracy. I won't spoil it much but definitely a lot of the things presented in the film are hard to believe and cannot be corroborated when you do some historical research. Also the story did have some nationalistic and political undertones which detract from its enjoyability.  I won't go into detail about this but they are obvious to people who know a little about the history of Malaysia.

Despite this I do recommend the movie for those who haven't seen it and can sit through some of the less enjoyable moments.",1347235200,,984,4.664739884393064
8433166,3,B004KNO77K,"Clash of Empires was a fair film, worthy of a lazy Saturday afternoon viewing.

The film begins with an epic storyline.  In it the Roman Empire and Han Dynasty arrange a marriage between a Roman prince and Chinese princess for political reasons.  The Romans hope to gain access to Far East secrets on weaponry, while the Chinese hope to gain smooth relations with trade routes into the western world.  The prince and princess in question are to meet on an island in the heart of the Malaysian islands where their marriage is to take place.

The Romans, however, run into a hitch when most of their fleet is lost at sea due to storms and unfamiliarity with the local waters.  Eventually they land in Goa, in India, where they meet a Malaysian outcast, Merong.  He reluctantly agrees to take them to the meeting place when his only other option is execution for womanizing in Goa. Once they arrive at the island, the Chinese princess decides that she doesn't want to marry the Roman prince.  In fact, he also seems to have misgivings about marrying someone who he has never met before.

The tensions lead to the princess sneaking out of the camp one night where she is captured by the Malaysian Gerudan Pirates.  In fact, the pirates attack the whole camp, killing most of the Chinese soldiers and what few Romans were left.  Merong fights heroically, but fails to protect the prince and princess, which causes him to doubt his worth in the world.  At that point the film focuses more on Merong and switches to Malay language with English subtitles, as he comes to terms with his identity and his past.  It turns out that he is destined to unite the people of the island against the Gerudan, to rid the islanders of the pirate threat forever.

As time goes by, he becomes the king of the Malaysian islanders and helps the Chinese and Romans to rescue the princess.  Battles ensue as all three groups struggle to be the dominate power in the islands.  The film sorts itself out in the end I won't spoil it for you.

I would have to say that Clash of Empires was a good film in concept, but the execution gets a little messy along the way.  The main reason for this is the addition of the Merong storyline.  It seems like the film is supposed to be about an early Malaysian hero, but during the film, the more interesting story is between the prince and princess.  I was a lot more interested in seeing how things turn out with them as they were the characters with the most color.  Then when the film switches to Merong, it seems to lose its appeal for awhile until the prince and princess's struggle is revisited again at the end.

In actuality, I think the film could have left Merong's character out altogether and would have been a stronger film.  He wasn't a character that I cared about or felt drawn to overall.

As far as the entertainment value, it's rated R, but seems more like a P-13 film.  That in and of itself wasn't a problem for me.  The acting is fair although the actor playing Merong wasn't as compelling to me as some of the others.  The film's budget seemed fairly high, although it wasn't epic like Gladiator or Braveheart.  It came across more light hearted in general and managed to include some humor, especially with the Chinese Princess and her maid.

Overall I gave the film a 3.  It probably deserves a 3  though.  It had good action, humor, a slight love story to it, and seemed like a fresh idea.  The balancing of the three cultures made it seem like it was trying to force a puzzle piece into a slot where it didn't really fit.  But it's worth a rental. I doubt you need to purchase this one though.  One time viewing should be enough for most. Many may be slightly disappointed with it overall so keep expectations low.  That way you won't expect more then what the film has to offer.",1326499200,,3816,4.47178002894356
8433167,1,B004KNO77K,"I just have a few things to say. Don't be like me, i was fooled by its evil marketing ploy. I have wasted time watching this garbage.

This is a Z-Grade movie. Don't waste your time. Go watch other flicks. Believe me, it's not worth the money.",1316217600,,243,4.170212765957447
8433168,5,B004KNO77K,"I am surprised by the other reviews of this film.  I was really entertained by the film and was not expecting much from an independent adventure film.  It has humor, production value, excitement.  The acting suffers a bit but I was really intrigued by the fantasy elements.  If you are a fan of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN or GLADIATOR, then it is worth checking out if you don't have studio level expectations.  If you want to see a 100 million dollar film, this might not be the right film for you.  If you are open minded and want some good, fun entertainment, this is the movie for you.  A hidden gem!!!",1313625600,2,604,4.387387387387387
8433169,2,B004KNO77K,"This is another pseudo-history that have become very popular with the movie goers. The exception is this is not really a pseudo-history, but a story based upon one iota of fact. WARNING: May contain plot spoilers.

Rome and China decide to come together with a wedding of a Roman prince and Chinese princess. They are going to do this on neutral ground in Malaysia (The movie was a big hit there.) The Roman fleet carrying the prince gets damaged and loses its gold ships. They limp into India and attempt to get more vessels, but without the gold, the crafty Indian (They make him talk like a convenience store owner) won't budge.

They end up hiring a warrior/slave (Stephen Rahman Hughes as Merong ), who descends from Alexander to take them in his small junque. The prince (Gavin Stenhouse as Marcus Carpenius ) is concerned that the princess may not love him. We get that answer in the next scene as we see the Chinese princess (Jing Lusi as Princess Meng Li Hua ) is bathing, complaining to her attendant she does not want to marry a barbarian. The movie shows the contempt Eastern civilization had for the west as they were ""barbarians"", ""fur and gold wearers"" and ""boy lovers.""

Rome is not at home in Malaysia. Clearly they are not in charge and are at the mercy of their host. Speaking of which, once the princess saw the Roman she opts to flee with her attendant Ying Ying (Nell Ng).

Marcus is also very adept in various Chinese fighting techniques.

There is sorcery by those that pray to the ""old gods."" There is a prophecy that Merong keeps remembering, one that his mother always spoke to him. Don't worry, if you missed it the first few times, you get to see it again.

When Merong is with his own people he speaks a foreign language with subtitles. When the Chinese are together, they opt for English, the same that the Romans speak. The princess mentions she also speaks Latin and does so, apparently not what the Romans speak. Ouch! Like so many of these pseudo-histories, the language is modern including slang, ideas and terms that are clearly anachronistic.

The movie dialouge and action is written for the younger audience, one prohibited from seeing this with the ""R"" rating. There is no nudity (naked silhouette). There is no foul language, Oh they do say ""pee."" The princess is apparently groped in one scene, but all we see is her face. There is a lot of fighting and killing with dead bodies, but not much in blood and gore.",1307145600,3,2454,4.589041095890411
8433170,2,B004KNO77K,"This is not a good film, however I am going to try to be objective. It is based on The Malay Chronicles from the 16th Century, which are pretty much myth and if you approach this as a sort of swords and sandals `Sinbad' then from certain viewer's points of view this may have some merit.

It supposedly tells the story of the uniting of the Han Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire of Hadrian, a Roman `Prince' is sent to marry a Chinese `Princess' and they are to meet in Malaysia via Goa, where the hapless Romans have to enlist the aid of a sea rover (Merong Mahawangsa) who claims to be descended from Alexander the Great. Once they get to this place of the `joining of empires' (a beach with a few bits of bamboo) where this ceremony is to take place, things go wrong.

If you have stuck with it thus far there is then a big fight, which is basically what this movie is selling itself as, a fight fest. I don't want to spoil the `plot' but needless to say after many, many plot holes there is some more fight scenes. I watched this with my nephew and one of his friends and they thought it was `awesome' etc. I begged to differ citing the historical, factual, material and language inaccuracies, all to no avail. That I think is the point, if you are prepared to suspend belief and forget even basic historical knowledge, then there is an average fight fest type of film trying to get out. The cover does mention the special effects as `stunning' well to have believed that you probably would needed to have been `stunned' possibly with a taser.

Also there really is not a `clash of empires'; more like a fight over some rock in the Pacific Ocean, so pretty much setting itself up for a fall straight away. It was to be called `The Malay Chronicles' which would have been more honest, but we all know that war sells. Also the sleeve claims that Alexander the great was `a renowned naval captain and traveller...' There was me thinking he was a sort of Emporer, General and looked like Colin Farrel, glad they put me straight.

The CGI is quite good in places, but the speeded up action scenes are a missed opportunity, the acting is wooden to faux melodrama and the sets are a bit `make do and mend'. The de rigueur man on man combat does go on interminably; I am always amazed that in a battle where everyone is `tooled up' that the two main protagonists decide to go for a bit of martial arts fisty cuffs, just stab him already. At 107 minutes this did seem like a chore, but it does have an audience, I just think with a 15 rating (in the UK) and an 'R' in the US they have accidentally excluded most of them.",1306886400,10,2617,4.302231237322515
