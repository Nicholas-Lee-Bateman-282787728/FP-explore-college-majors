8348402,5,B002042LK6,"I am hesitant to give this film a 5 star rating, in spite of the fact that it is the best cinematic depiction I have seen of the environmental crisis that humans have created for themselves, simply because it would be impossible to encapsulate the profound understandings of many of the interviewees such as Heinberg http://tinyurl.com/yqaodk Tainter http://tinyurl.com/bfdse and, in particular, Catton http://tinyurl.com/dtveq in a mere 90 minutes. (Notice I don't mention McKibben, who is a parvenu techno-optimist who does not belong these esteemed scientists.) This film would be a fine introduction for those who are unfamiliar with these issues, but for those with a deeper interest I would recommend going to the primary sources cited.",1414886400,,742,5.405172413793103
8348403,5,B002042LK6,"Perhaps the most compelling aspect of this great film is the panoramic sweep of its viewpoint.  No stone was left unturned in detailing the innumerable and seemingly unrelated components comprising fossil fuel and its impact, not only on the modern world but on the human species itself.  Everything we think and feel is as inextricably linked to the primacy of petroleum in human society as is everything we eat, drink, touch, experience and, ultimately, take for granted.  Each of the experts offering assessments of the human/petroleum condition approaches the topic from his or her particular field of expertise; these are not typical ""New Age"" gurus expressing ""New Age"" opinions or offering ""New Age"" solutions to the most significant and potentially catastrophic dynamic humanity has ever faced.  These are scientifically trained experts who apply their expertise to analyzing the problem and offering possible solutions.

The presenters who perhaps come closest to expressing the ""New Age"" paradigm are Derek Jensen and David Korten.  Jensen, whose ""Endgame"" book and DVD have taken modern civilization severely to task, is by far the most pessimistic voice heard. Korten traces the system which gives rise to and perpetuates the kinds of myths which lead people to accept uncritically whatever their leaders say regarding the human condition to the very roots of what we call ""civilization""; namely the dominant hierarchic dynamic which replaced cooperation to set a few members of society above the rest, thereby maximizing the exploitation of natural resources to keep the dominant few in positions of power.  More mainstream experts include Bill McKibben and James Hansen, both of whom for years have sounded the warning bell about the relationship of fossil fuel to climate change; and Dr. Albert Bartlett, physics professor whose mathematical breakdown shows what even small incremental increases in productivity actually mean over time.

By and large, far more is said concerning the inevitable decline and ultimate extinction of affordable and plentiful energy than the cumulative effects of its use.  Yes, the issue of global climate change, as specifically linked to fossil fuel, is covered, and in considerable detail; but the primary focus is on what happens socially, politically, economically and even existentially when the Peak Oil crisis begins to emerge.  And, as one might expect, by far the biggest challenge facing the modern world is its almost complete unwillingness to begin dealing with that eventuality.  As the film makes clear, there is still time to prepare ourselves for what's coming; but that window of opportunity is lessening every day we put off thinking about it till tomorrow.  And tomorrow, as Little Orphan Annie so rhythmically opined, is ""only a day away.""",1346198400,2,2805,5.35
8348404,5,B002042LK6,This film is extremely well done in giving us a sense of the extent to which oil resources changed the relationship of humans to their enviroment. Good education that should be used in the schools. The younger generation of children my son's age will need to understand the importance of the messages of this movie.,1330905600,,315,4.745454545454545
8348405,5,B002042LK6,"Blind Spot is an award-winning documentary about how after we reach the peak of oil drilling (within the next few years) life will begin to rapidly change for all of us, as the oil prices rise. This is not an if but a when and actually the when is really a HOW SOON and the answer is within the next few years, starting now.

There is some information about how we in the U.S. are driven to OVER consume by the advertisements designed by corporations. I know I fall for it.

This is a very informative reminder (we all pretty much know it's coming, right?)so that we don't stay totally glazed-over in our consumer culture.

Can this be stopped? Not if we all continue to ignore what is happening for instant gratification.

This is a very scary documentary and the fact that the interviews are with Ph. D's from Cornell and MIT is another slap in the face: This is NOT left-wing hooey. It is happening!

8348406,5,B002042LK6,"This movie cuts right to the heart of the matter, and tells a very important truth where most in society are oblivious. This should be mandator viewing for all, especially for all high school and college students; but is valid for all adults. The movie does an excellent job of getting to the point, making a point, and covering everything in a comprehensive fashion.  The world as we know it is headed for BIG trouble.  We MUST educate ourselves, and be proactive in taking positive steps to help our planet.",1318723200,,509,4.644444444444445
8348407,5,B002042LK6,"I just saw this film the other day, and I must say, it is one of the most disturbing, chilling movies I've ever seen. So scary, because it's real, it's happening to my life and yours right now. This film explains why our lives are falling apart. The explanation involves energy, overpopulation, mass consumption. It all comes together to paint a very bleak picture of our future. Many would like to deny the facts presented, and many would like to pretend there's nothing wrong. But, it's getting harder and harder to pretend. A must see.",1317513600,3,538,4.673684210526316
8348408,5,B002042LK6,"Everyone should probably see this movie and then start thinking of ways we can start to fix things now while there is still time.  This is basic History/Science/Physics not some conspiracy theory and we need to start acting accordingly. ""Adapt or perish, now as ever, is Nature's inexorable imperative.""  H.G Wells.  I also reccomend Nova: Solar Energy-Saved by the Sun it isn't so gloom and doom as Blind Spot, although alot of people might need the slap in the face that Blind Spot provides.",1297728000,5,493,4.845238095238095
8348409,5,B002042LK6,"In this film you'll find that are core causes to the crisis were in. There is also a deeper story of how humanity turned from partnership relations to organizations of dominator hierarchies. About five thousand years ago we started by these hierarchical structures, and when you organize by those structures, you have a few people at the top & a lot of people on the bottom. There is a HUGE disparity between them. This creates an enormous competition for positions of power, and that dynamic becomes imperative
to maintain the system, to appropiate more & more resources to maintain that struture of dominance, to maintain the militarty forces, to maintain order, to maintain the byzantium bureaucracy, to maintain the priesthoods that develope the ideology & religion that legitimize the KINGS over the serfs. This has played out for over five thousand years and evolved through the city/states, then the nation/states, to the current corporate/states.
 Some believe they will move either toward perhaps a world dictatorship or a nuclear World War before they loose their power to the people.
 Globalization's goal was to tie us all into this ecological overshoot. It is now very difficult for any individual or place to manage their own affairs, not just in resources but in pollution. Never has there been a time when all these civilizations are linked up in this globalized resource exchange called free trade, which in the short run gives us amazing economic growth but in the long term makes us incredibly vulnerable to political insecurity, resource anomalies, or Stalin/Hitler draconian outcomes.
 So we set up massive militerzations to force continued trade. We set up GIGANTIC banking/financial frameworks to keep this free trade going. This added complexity has diminishing returns. The only solution is to realign our population both in size & location with the biological carrying capacity of the planet.
 Unfortunately, as the film implies: it's do or die time.",1264118400,9,1976,5.184952978056426
8348410,5,B002042LK6,"Blind Spot was directed by this easy-going hard-working team of adolfo and amanda who patiently put together the first peak oil film to seriously discuss ""overshoot"" and ""carrying capacity"" - two of the most important concepts any world citizen should know. william catton's monumental book overshoot finally makes it's first appearance in a film as william catton, and later in the film, mathematics professor albert bartlett show how ignoring population and simple exponential math will, unchecked, destroy western civilization and alarmingly soon.  oil is a one-time resource. use once and it's gone. millions of years at the right heat and pressure to make and it will be too expensive to extract by 2100 because no one wanted to save it for grandchildren or use it sparingly. 2005 was probably the year of peak oil; that means that half of all the oil in history (the EASY to get half) is now gone. thus the end of cheap energy. without fossil fuels the world could support one billion, maybe 2.5 billion, depending on who you ask. so this century (of peak oil, peak uranium, peak coal, peak everything) the world's population must go down quite a few billion whether we like it or not, or there WILL be a massive die-off this century.

when the first barrel of american oil was extracted in the 19th century, the EROI (energy returned on investment) was a whopping 100 to 1. civilization needs a ratio of 10 to one to survive. put a dollar in the ground and out comes 10 dollars of fossil fuel. the EROI ratio of oil is now at 20 to 1.  there will always be oil in the ground. it will just take more money to pump it than it is worth. ethanol is a best 2.5 to 1. thus ethanol could only be a drag on civilization due simply to a shamefully low EROI (and you would have to plant only ethanol and have no food or people everywhere). when the EROI of oil falls below 10, the threshold of civilization, and it will this century, then the real fun begins. because few people are planning for this or thinking about anything other than britney spears and the michael jackson tributes few things will change in time.  when your car is going to crash and you are driving, the smart thing to do is to respond. all of us must educate ourselves fast -and respond.

great interviews with richard heinberg, matt savinar, william catton, roscoe bartlett, albert bartlett, mary-anne hitt, bill mckibben, and even derrick jensen. nobody seems to want to cover derrick jensen and he's such a huge influence on the whole movement (check out his non-fiction books on civilization on amazon - amazing). derrick says some great stuff in this movie and it pretty much begins and ends with derrick.  some illiterate in england complained that this movie had no women interviewed. i thought that's pretty insulting to mary anne hitt of appalachian voices who discusses mountaintop removal & coal. i also saw the reviews:

official selection london independent film festival 2008
official selection woodstock film festival 2008

howard zinn:  ""i was transfixed by it.""
laura flanders: ""beautiful images, gorgeous soundtrack""
bill mc kibben: ""the next few decades aren't going to look like the last few - not at all. and the sooner we come to terms with that, the better. this documentary is a good place to start.""
john stauber: ""beautiful, crucial, straightfoward, brilliantly woven images and music.""

""BLIND SPOT is a documentary that illustrates the current energy crisis that our way of life is facing. whatever measures of greed, wishful thinking, neglect or ignorance, we have put ourselves at a crossroad which offers two paths, both with dire consequences. if we continue to burn fossil fuels we will choke the life out of our planet and if we don't our way of life will collapse""
-on the dvd case

the title of the film comes from william catton's wife who once paused and said to adolfo, ""you know, i think it's actually the world's blind spot"" - people cannot see the relationship between energy and population. we have temporarily extend the world's carrying capacity for human population for two hundred years through the one time use of fossil fuels, when the fossil fuels go this century it will be the end of a lot of things. in my lifetime i will see the end of the growth economy (you can't have infinite growth on a finite planet), the return to community, local foods, local economy, less travel, and i'll probably be using 90% less energy than presently (whether i like it or not).  i give this film the highest recommendation to anyone who wants to understand the crushing triple problem:  climate change, end of cheap energy, end of cheap natural resources (water, copper, platinum, indium). the problem isn't global warming. the problem is global warming plus peak oil plus resource depletion. and even if americans do everything right and corporations and the world helps, it may not matter, because the profligate use of energy (not to mention the environmental cost - blanketing irag in tons of depleted uranium that will continue to poison iraq's citizens for 4.5 billion years- making d.u. affected u.s. soldiers end out their lives in diapers and on morphine) by the U.S. military assures that it (more than the rest of us) will make the war on climate change unwinnable unless the war machine is stopped (since WWII we have known that economies stay alive by the stimulation of a raging war, so expect resistance repackaged again as patriotism).  see AK presses great new book (green zone: the environmental costs of militarism by barry saunders). But it starts with Blind Spot. get a copy and share it with others.",1252972800,33,5628,4.794633642930856
