Gideon Levy / 'Antiwar' film Waltz with Bashir is nothing but charade
By Gideon Levy, Haaretz Correspondent
Tags: israel news, walz with bashir

Everyone now has his fingers crossed for Ari Folman and all the creative artists behind ""Waltz with Bashir"" to win the Oscar on Sunday. A first Israeli Oscar? Why not?

However, it must also be noted that the film is infuriating, disturbing, outrageous and deceptive. It deserves an Oscar for the illustrations and animation - but a badge of shame for its message. It was not by accident that when he won the Golden Globe, Folman didn't even mention the war in Gaza, which was raging as he accepted the prestigious award. The images coming out of Gaza that day looked remarkably like those in Folman's film. But he was silent. So before we sing Folman's praises, which will of course be praise for us all, we would do well to remember that this is not an antiwar film, nor even a critical work about Israel as militarist and occupier. It is an act of fraud and deceit, intended to allow us to pat ourselves on the back, to tell us and the world how lovely we are.

Hollywood will be enraptured, Europe will cheer and the Israeli Foreign Ministry will send the movie and its makers around the world to show off the country's good side. But the truth is that it is propaganda. Stylish, sophisticated, gifted and tasteful - but propaganda. A new ambassador of culture will now join Amos Oz and A.B. Yehoshua, and he too will be considered fabulously enlightened - so different from the bloodthirsty soldiers at the checkpoints, the pilots who bomb residential neighborhoods, the artillerymen who shell women and children, and the combat engineers who rip up streets. Here, instead, is the opposite picture. Animated, too. Of enlightened, beautiful Israel, anguished and self-righteous, dancing a waltz, with and without Bashir. Why do we need propagandists, officers, commentators and spokespersons who will convey ""information""? We have this waltz.

The waltz rests on two ideological foundations. One is the ""we shot and we cried"" syndrome: Oh, how we wept, yet our hands did not spill this blood. Add to this a pinch of Holocaust memories, without which there is no proper Israeli self-preoccupation. And a dash of victimization - another absolutely essential ingredient in public discourse here - and voila! You have the deceptive portrait of Israel 2008, in words and pictures.

Folman took part in the Lebanon war of 1982, and two dozen years later remembered to make a movie about it. He is tormented. He goes back to his comrades-in-arms, gulps down shots of whiskey at a bar with one, smokes joints in Holland with another, wakes his therapist pal at first light and goes for another session to his shrink - all to free himself at long last from the nightmare that haunts him. And the nightmare is always ours, ours alone.

It is very convenient to make a film about the first, and now remote, Lebanon war: We already sent one of those, ""Beaufort,"" to the Oscar competition. And it's even more convenient to focus specifically on Sabra and Chatila, the Beirut refugee camps.

Even way back, after the huge protest against the massacre perpetrated in those camps, there was always the declaration that, despite everything - including the green light given to our lackey, the Phalange, to execute the slaughter, and the fact that it all took place in Israeli-occupied territory - the cruel and brutal hands that shed blood are not our hands. Let us lift our voices in protest against all the savage Bashir-types we have known. And yes, a little against ourselves, too, for shutting our eyes, perhaps even showing encouragement. But no: That blood, that's not us. It's them, not us.

We have not yet made a movie about the other blood, which we have spilled and continue to allow to flow, from Jenin to Rafah - certainly not a movie that will get to the Oscars. And not by chance.

In ""Waltz with Bashir"" the soldiers of the world's most moral army sing out something like: ""Lebanon, good morning. May you know no more grief. Let your dreams come true, your nightmares evaporate, your whole life be a blessing.""

Nice, right? What other army has a song like this, and in the middle of a war, yet? Afterward they go on to sing that Lebanon is the ""love of my life, the short life."" And then the tank, from inside of which this lofty and enlightened singing emanates, crushes a car for starters, turning it into a smashed tin can, then pounds a residential building, threatening to topple it. That's how we are. Singing and wrecking. Where else will you find sensitive soldiers like these? It would really be preferable for them to shout with hoarse voices: Death to the Arabs!

I saw the ""Waltz"" twice. The first time was in a movie theater, and I was bowled over by the artistry. What style, what talent. The illustrations are perfect, the voices are authentic, the music adds so much. Even Ron Ben Yishai's half-missing finger is accurate. No detail is missed, no nuance blurred. All the heroes are heroes, superbly stylish, like Folman himself: articulate, trendy, up-to-date, left-wingers - so sensitive and intelligent.

Then I watched it again, at home, a few weeks later. This time I listened to the dialogue and grasped the message that emerges from behind the talent. I became more outraged from one minute to the next. This is an extraordinarily infuriating film precisely because it is done with so much talent. Art has been recruited here for an operation of deceit. The war has been painted with soft, caressing colors - as in comic books, you know. Even the blood is amazingly aesthetic, and suffering is not really suffering when it is drawn in lines. The soundtrack plays in the background, behind the drinks and the joints and the bars. The war's fomenters were mobilized for active service of self-astonishment and self-torment.

Boaz is devastated at having shot 26 stray dogs, and he remembers each of them. Now he is looking for ""a therapist, a shrink, shiatsu, something."" Poor Boaz. And poor Folman, too: He is devilishly unable to remember what happened during the massacre. ""Movies are also psychotherapy"" - that's the bit of free advice he gets. Sabra and Chatila? ""To tell you the truth? It's not in my system."" All in such up-to-the-minute Hebrew you could cry. After the actual encounter with Boaz in 2006, 24 years later, the ""flash"" arrives, the great flash that engendered the great movie.

One fellow comes to the war on the Love Boat, another flees it by swimming away. One sprinkles patchouli on himself, another eats a Spam omelet. The filmmaker-hero of ""Waltz"" remembers that summer with great sadness: It was exactly then that Yaeli dumped him. Between one thing and the other, they killed and destroyed indiscriminately. The commander watches porn videos in a Beirut villa, and even Ben Yishai has a place in Ba'abda, where one evening he downs half a glass of whiskey and phones Arik Sharon at the ranch and tells him about the massacre. And no one asks who these looted and plundered apartments belong to, damn it, or where their owners are and what our forces are doing in them in the first place. That is not part of the nightmare.

What's left is hallucination, a sea of fears, the hero confesses on the way to his therapist, who is quick to calm him and explains that the hero's interest in the massacre at the camps derives from a different massacre: from the camps from which his parents came. Bingo! How could we have missed it? It's not us at all, it's the Nazis, may their name and memory be obliterated. It's because of them that we are the way we are. ""You have been cast in the role of the Nazi against your will,"" a different therapist says reassuringly, as though evoking Golda Meir's remark that we will never forgive the Arabs for making us what we are. What we are? The therapist says that we shone the lights, but ""did not perpetrate the massacre."" What a relief. Our clean hands are not part of the dirty work, no way.

And besides that, it wasn't us at all: How pleasant to see the cruelty of the other. The amputated limbs that the Phalange, may their name be obliterated, stuff into the formaldehyde bottles; the executions they perpetrate; the symbols they slash into the bodies of their victims. Look at them and look at us: We never do things like that.

When Ben Yishai enters the Beirut camps, he recalls scenes of the Warsaw ghetto. Suddenly he sees through the rubble a small hand and a curly-haired head, just like that of his daughter. ""Stop the shooting, everybody go home,"" the commander, Amos, calls out through a megaphone in English. The massacre comes to an abrupt end. Cut.

Then, suddenly, the illustrations give way to the real shots of the horror of the women keening amid the ruins and the bodies. For the first time in the movie, we not only see real footage, but also the real victims. Not the ones who need a shrink and a drink to get over their experience, but those who remain bereaved for all time, homeless, limbless and crippled. No drink and no shrink can help them. And that is the first (and last) moment of truth and pain in ""Waltz with Bashir.""",1235174400,21,9578,4.705671641791045
3669306,5,B001KVZ6AM,"+++++++++++This review contains no spoilers.++++++++++++++

Brilliant depiction of war from a soldier's point of view.  Real life account of a soldier's experience in the 1982 Lebanese War. Do not let the fact that it is animated, or that it has subtitles, put you off.

The colours, music and dialogue enhance the experience, and show just how chaotic and seemingly random war actually is, as opposed to the notion that everything planned is executed to the last detail.

It is important to note that the film is Israeli, and it is assumed that the viewer will have a basic grasp of the background events and political alliances behind the Lebanese Civil War, the 1982 Lebanon war, and the Israeli vs PLO conflict in general, as these are only slightly explained by the film.

I would advise that viewers be over age 18, and that some content is sexually explicit.",1234051200,3,865,4.8175675675675675
3669307,5,B001KVZ6AM,"An animated bio-documentary? Yes. Writer, director, and producer Ari Folman was disturbed one night when his friend Boaz recounted a recurring nightmare in which he's hounded by a snarling pack of twenty-six dogs. The nightmare is clearly connected to his service in the Israeli army during the Lebanese war of 1982. For his part, Ari remembers very little about his life as a soldier. In this animated film, he interviews nine friends who were comrades at the same time in order to find out exactly where he was and what he did. On the personal level, the film explores moral guilt, uncontrollable fear, abandonment, the reliability of remembered history, the traumas of war, the boundary lines between the real and the surreal, and suppressed memories. On the political level, the film recalls a particular historical atrocity -- the massacre of about 3,000 Palestinians, mainly civilians, by Christian Phalangist fighters at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, in order to avenge the assassination of Lebanon's newly elected president, Bashir Gemayel. An investigation by the Israeli government later established its complicity in the atrocity. Can film not serve as a sort of therapy, asks one of Folman's friends.

3669308,5,B001KVZ6AM,"I saw this at Cinefest and it's a great movie! some great scenes and overall very good if you know anything about that time period(70s, 80s).
The only downfall for some will be the subtitles but I have no problems with them. Great movie.",1232668800,,237,4.409090909090909
3669309,2,B001KVZ6AM,"I just saw this film. I think it's a little over-rated. I will admit it was well-made (in terms of the animation), but I wouldn't say it was the best foreign film of 2008. (I think ""Edge of Heaven,"" ""Silent Light,"" and ""Three Monkeys"" were better than ""Waltz With Bashir."") I realize ""Waltz with Bashir,"" was an animated documentary, but did it have to drag so darn much at times and as a result--be boring.

I think the problem I had with this movie were: 1) It was from an Israeli's viewpoint instead of a Palestinian and/or Lebanese, who were actually involved in the massacre. As a result, there wasn't much explanation in the film. For example, why were the Lebanese (or Christian Phalangists) and Israelis fighting the Palestinians in Lebanon and not Israel or Gaza or West Bank?  Also, what were the thoughts and feelings of the massacre from the Palestinians and Lebanese?  If you're going to have an Israeli viewpoint, then get one that answers the following question: Why did the Israelis invade Lebanon and how did they feel about the invasion?

2) The film needed more interesting characters. IMO, the comrades that Folman interviewed pretty much all sounded the same. They couldn't remember this, they couldn't remember that. They were advising Folman to do this or that. None of them had a distinct characteristic trait. That's why I think this film dragged at times. You got tired of hearing the same person talk all the time.

3) This film spent too much time on the ""amnesia"" part of the film (""I can't remember what I did in the war"") and not enough time on the consequences of the war. What happened after it was discovered that the Christian Phalangists were ""massacre-ing"" the Palestinians?

As I said before, the animation in this film was well done, but ultimately I think it's over-rated. It spent too much time (almost 90 minutes) having the main character go through an ""amnesia"" state of mind before he finally remembered the horror.",1232496000,13,1960,4.766961651917404
3669310,5,B001KVZ6AM,"Although called a documentary, this movie was in fact an animated film centered on recalling the repressed recollections of a lone Israeli soldier who had provided the eyes and ears for the Phalangist Christian soldiers who carried out the infamous massacre at Sabra and Shatila camps in Lebanon in 1982. The film is one man's ""coming to grips"" with his repressed memories, and the guilt that he had tucked away of those events in his subconscious for more than twenty years.

For me, not crazy about the new trend in ""adult animations,"" this, a serious animated film, sounded like an artistic oxymoron. I was, to say the least, very ambivalent about going to see a serious ""adult animated film."" I felt pretty sure it would be the wrong vehicle to convey a seriously introspective message, especially one as morally complex and challenging as the events that occurred in Lebanon. My ""going in"" premise was that this approach sat best would be a kind of ""limited hangout,"" or partial revelation via fantasy of unspeakable crimes that could not be confronted otherwise, and thus as a way of shielding the author from the ultimate confrontation with the terrible truths he had avoided for twenty years and now reluctantly, and step-by-step, was forced to acknowledge, and then comes to grips with.

However, after seeing the movie, the currency of ""adult animation"" went way up in my mind. Quite frankly it has won me over as an exciting new genre. Waltz with Bashir proved to be a first class artistic triumph, as a surprisingly robust and multidimensional form of introspective analysis. It was not quite fantasy, and yet not quite typical ""movie reality"" either. Throughout the movie, I had the feeling of being in the same ""mental halfway house"" that Bashir found himself in: in a half-dreamlike state with monsters and ogres and such; and, in a suspended state of gradual revelations of all the things behind Bashir's mental shield.

Since his memory seemed to fail him, Bashir's dreams of beaches filled with corpses and wailing piles of victims, grotesque visions and flashbacks of barking dogs, etc -- had to be validated through interviews with his former ""band of brothers."" who recited bit-by-painful-bit unmentionable horrors and atrocities they had all committed together. Taken together, this tableau of dreams, interviews, and recalled memories, used animation well as the vehicle that lighted the passageway back from Bahir's repressed memories to a gradual confrontation with an unpleasant and shameful past reality, and of his role in the massacre of hundreds of mostly old men, women and children.

I am forced to admit that in this instance anyway, animation functioned well in the ""no man's land"" between reality (i.e. admissions of guilt) and the repressed subconscious (pretending not to know what he had done).
I left the theater understanding and empathizing with Bashir, wondering whether or not a ""real"" movie could have captured so accurately the ""mental no man's land"" that animation had captured so well. Joseph Campell and Carl Jung would have been proud of this incredible dreamlike but mythical production.

3669311,5,B001KVZ6AM,"This movie may be too serious for the mass audience, but I found it utterly riveting for the story, told from the point of view of a man trying to remember where he was in the 1982 war in Lebanon.  I've never seen animation that has so blown me away with its poetic beauty (phrase sounds hackneyed, but I mean it) and the accompanying soundtrack is rip-roaring good.  I didn't like the events that happened in this movie -- after all, it's about one man's experience of a war, revealed bit by bit as he visits and talks with others who may be able to help him reassemble the story piece by piece -- but the telling was lyrical and compelling.

This is the sort of movie that's probably best seen in a big-screen cinema house, but probably won't last that long or go outside of the arthouse circuit.  Failing that, watch it on the biggest screen you can find.",1231286400,2,858,4.34375
3669312,5,B001KVZ6AM,"I am writing as a politically engaged individual with long developed interest in the turmoil in the Middle East.  This film was therefore unlikely to provide me with factual information with which I was not already familiar.  That was not the reason to see it.  Wars are created from above and fought from below by human beings who might otherwise be colleagues, friends or lovers.  This film shows us a cyclical process whereby humans are turned into automata and then back once more into humans - changed, confused, damaged or maybe just puzzled humans.

The interviews exchanged between the ex soldiers are inevitably the most powerful.  These men were reconstructing events they maybe had not thought of for many years. Or more to the point had no desire to do so. This film was their film, their collective memory as of itself and inevitably, by extension, the collective memory of the country they fought for.

Beautiful, bloody, brutal and raw. War as fought by real people, who kill other real people and then live with the consequences.  Not pretty but true.",1228608000,3,1067,4.856353591160221
3669313,5,B001KVZ6AM,"This is a great movie not just about the Israeli debacle in Lebanon itself, but a study on PTSD that could be applied to anyone serving a country or a cause.

When your society/government sends someone off to fight, kill, or die for a nebulous or questionable cause, it becomes harder to fit that person back into that society.

The moment I began watching the movie, my eyes were stuck to my tv screen, and I stayed that way all the way through the film.
One of the things that the movie does well is use animation to help drive home certain emotions or meanings that otherwise could not be conveyed.
A great deal of the movie feels exaggerated, almost like it's a dream, and we are immersed into this dream.
But all of that gets violently pulled from over our eyes at the end of the movie, and we realize the one great ugly truth; war is hell.

3669434,5,B001KVZ6AM,"I can honestly say that I've never seen anything quite like WALTZ WITH BASHIR before. It's animated, but it's also a documentary which recounts director Ari Folman's attempt to reclaim long-suppressed memories of his involvement in the Lebanon War. The animation-documentary combination is an odd one, but nevertheless it works extraordinarily well with what the filmmakers seemed to be going for here. Although it mostly deals with firsthand war experiences, the larger theme is the subjective and fragile nature of memory, particularly of the traumatic and painful variety. I don't really want to get into any specifics because to do so would spoil the impact. All I'll say is that this film builds rather slowly as different people are interviewed and details are revealed, and the climax is sure to provoke an emotional reaction. As far as the quality of the film is concerned, the animation is very well-done. The movement is a little odd at times, but this is due to them either using cut-outs or roto-scoping (maybe a combination of both?). I'm fairly certain that the interview scenes were based on actual film footage, but I could be wrong. The sequences in the past are distinguished from the present by having this watercolor-like, washed-out, yellow-tinged and dingy look, while the scenes in the present have more natural-looking color. Back to thematic content, there is also some discussion about dreams and how they relate to memory. And of course, since this film deals with a war (and massacre) issues of morality come up, if in a more subtle way than you might think. What I took away from this is that the Lebanon War (and Palestinian massacre) is something that weighs heavy on the Israeli/Jewish conscience. We as human beings tend to block out things from our memories that we find offensive and overly traumatic, and there probably is some cognitive dissonance between the very real atrocities visited on Jews in the past and the atrocities that they have inflicted, or at least passively observed being inflicted, on others. It should go without saying that this film deals with some very heavy subject matter, but it's very important that we as human beings are able to confront and deal with all memories, even the ones we'd like to forget.",1425168000,4,2267,4.968421052631579

3669438,5,B001KVZ6AM,"An amazing award-winning documentary. One of the best that I have seen. The animation is superb - the artists re-create the individual mimicry of each person with uncanny realism, it is not Disney. It's a very reflective documentary, most of it is made up of conversations or discussions or reminiscences, not action. It's very personal and therefore powerful. The story is about the director, who was in the Israeli-Lebanon War in 1982 on the Israeli side and witnessed the Shatila camp massacres. He has forgotten about the incident - it's not clear why, maybe suppressed memories - but years later a conversation with a friend forces him to rediscover and face his memories. He does this by traveling to find and talk to his army comrades from the past to find out what they remember and what really happened. Overall, I thought this was visually stunning and the personal stories are powerful. It really makes you feel how futile and scary war is for young men. And how absurd and surreal. It is done in a thoughtful, not a sensational kind of way. It is not a typical action movie or anything like that. I would recommend watching this with teenagers as a way to teach them about the psychological consequences of war.

3669471,4,B001KVZ6AM,"""Waltz with Bashir"" got a lot of press upon release, and a lot of shouting and moaning from all political angles - it's too critical of Israel, or it's too critical of Lebanon (where as far as I know it has never played commercially), or it's not critical enough, etc. I'm not going to go into that, not being versed enough in Israeli politics or the Lebanon war; even if I wanted to, it's clear that Folman himself is ambivalent about so much that he probably takes it in stride that he's going to get pelted with critical barbs no matter whose ""side"" he takes. This is Folman's third feature-length film and first animated feature; I believe it's been claimed to be the first animated documentary feature, and while I don't know if that's true it certainly does seem to have the field to itself - if there's anything else out there like this it sure didn't get much play. I would call it as much a ""personal essay"" as a documentary; obviously all of the sequences that take place in the past are reconstructions, apart from one key moment at the end.

Folman's point of departure is meeting an old friend with whom he served during the Lebanon war who tells him of a nightmare, which gets Folman to thinking about the fact that he really doesn't remember his experiences at all. This starts a chain of inquiries as he tries to reconstruct his own past and finds out that many of his comrades have (apparently) missing chunks of memory also - or have different recollections. There are also a few conversations with pychologists to try to probe why these problems might have happened, but ultimately this ends up being less about the still unfathomable waters of human memory and more about the nature of these men's feelings about a massacre in 1982 which was carried out by Lebanese Christians upon Palestinians, but which the Israelis were technically involved in as they had control of Beirut at the time. How much to blame they are, how guilty they should feel - and (most contentiously I would imagine) whether or not they have taken the place of oppressors themselves when they have been so used to being victims -  is the main subject of the film. Folman doesn't really have answers, and so one comes away wondering what the journey can teach us - though clearly it has taught him something about his own past.

I liked the animation quite a lot - it's much closer to ""realistic"" comics such as Joe Sacco's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Palestine/dp/1560978449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Palestine</a>&nbsp;which I'd imagine was an inspiration, and it's very well-paced and edited. I guess on the whole it didn't quite add up to ""greatness"" for me. I'm not sure what I expected and I sure didn't want or expect easy answers - and I'm glad Folman refused to give them - but still, something's missing, I just haven't nailed it down.  He certainly comes across as a ""pro-peace"" artist, and there is never any sense that the massacre or the war in general were justified; but alternate solutions or ideas are lacking.  Maybe in a sense for Folman it remains too personal for the politics to really come across with as much clarity as they could; maybe I just don't know enough myself as an American with no specific connection to the situation.  In any case, well worth seeing despite my caveats.

The DVD has some decent extras; the Q&A with the director and two short behind-the-scenes featurettes add to the experience considerably I think.  Quite amazing that the animation is not rotoscoped!  I have yet to listen to the commentary, I find these generally too distracting no matter how good they are.",1380931200,,3656,4.808917197452229

3669484,4,B001KVZ6AM,"Israeli film maker Ari Folman decided to make this unflinching and harrowing animated documentary after talking to a former army pal who was having nightmares about what he had done during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Folman, who also took part in the campaign, realises he has blotted out all his memories of what happened and decides to uncover them. He talks to former comrades and gradually uncovers the story of what he and the others did, culminating in how Israeli troops stood by (and in some cases indirectly aided) Christian Falange forces as they massacred Palestinian civilians in a refugee camp near Beirut (estimates range from 750 to 3,000 dead). This really isn't meant to be the entire story of the 1982 campaign (there is no mention of the fact that then defence minister Ariel Sharon was forced to resign); it's the personal odyssey of one man as he delves deep into his post-traumatic stress disorder and discovers what he did as a 19-year-old soldier. His former comrades all come across as damaged by their experiences, some more than others. One recounts how he and the crew of his tank were singing along to the radio as they trundled north through Lebanon. Seconds later, the commander took a sniper bullet in the throat and the tank was blown up. This is a powerful and troubling portrait of what happens to soldiers in warfare and how often civilians in the wrong places are the ones who pay the price. I didn't take it as being particularly anti-Israeli or pro-Palestinian, more of a cautionary tale about the obscenities of war.",1363392000,,1558,4.795539033457249

3669489,5,B001KVZ6AM,"Ari Folman has opened up his soul and it is a bleak journey. Animation does not soften the anguish expressed in this film. It gives voice to what post traumatic stress is. Making sense of the insensible. Men thinking they are doing the right thing and then living with the doubts. I found parallels to my father's generation who lived under occupation, were resistants or soldiers. Youth when it started, full of ideals and then at its end, frozen men in a tundra of emotions held so locked down they would erupt at triggers, we their children could only guess at or learn to try and avoid. They did not have the means to deal with the demons in their head about what they saw and did. This is where this film stands out. I abhor and remember events such as the immoral 1982 invasion of Lebanon, the massacres in Shatila, and likewise Rwanda, Darfur. Lebanon cast a stain for many Israelis on how they perceived themself, their country and their future. But in that they are not alone. I think the greater majority of us living in relative comfort in western countries such as here in Australia turn a blind eye to uncomfortable truths. Such as how do we challenge genocide, injustice around the world and in our own domains?

3669490,5,B001KVZ6AM,"Waltz With Bashir is an animated documentary regarding a well-documented massacre that took place during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.  The victims in Palestinian refugee camps were killed by Christian militia in collusion with the Israeli forces.  The director, a documentarian, had been an Israeli infantry soldier and was unable to remember anything from the Lebanon War.  In an attempt to reconstruct what happened and why, he searched out old soldier friends, a psychologist, and a reporter who was there.  Animation is perfect for bringing to awareness the occluded nightmare memories and the horrors of the event.  The film ends with a transition from animation to actual footage of the aftermath of the massacre.  It shows the necessity of illuminating these dark events so that healing can happen, to both the victims and the perpetrators.",1348617600,,853,5.281481481481482
3669491,5,B001KVZ6AM,"Twenty years after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, of which he was a participant, the writer and director Ari Forman realized that he had little memory of his time there. This included being stationed a few hundred metres from the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila during the three days in which the Falangist militia massacred the population there.

Waltz with Bashir recounts how, with the help of others who had been there, including fellow soldiers, he began to recover his memory of the events.

Palestinians and Lebanese have no voice in this film. Nevertheless it still represents some of the best impulses in Israeli society, documenting how an ordinary Israeli faces the truth of a particularly vile episode in his nation's history in which he himself was directly implicated.

The massacre in Sabra and Shatila has echos through history: one Israeli journalist, Ron Ben-Yishai a distinguished war correspondent, who was witness to the massacre recounts how the scene in the camps reminded him of the images of the Warsaw Ghetto.

There are other echoes in Middle Eastern history. One not mentioned in the film is how in 1268, on capturing the city of Antioch, the Sultan Baybars immediately locked the city gates to stop the escape of any of the town's inhabitants as he proceeded to massacre them. Forman argues with this film that the role of the Israeli army during the massacre was the equivalent to Baybars' locking of the gates while their Falangist allies, Israeli-equipped, carried out the slaughter. While the film may provide only a narrow perspective on the Lebanese invasion, it is a startlingly brave and humane one, showing how an ordinary individual human can take responsibilty even in the midst of overwhelming historical event.",1346544000,2,1769,5.0687285223367695

Yet there is very little outrage in the film, more sadness and regret, and these apologists have the gall to claim Israel is treated unfairly by the filmmaker. In fact, as with most Jews/Israelies, the criticism of Israel is muted.
That said, the film does a number of things very well; the animation is excellent, the characters very three-dimensional (especailly the Israeli who went to live in Holland), it shows the madness of war, and, as the film puts it, the awful ""silence of death.""

The filmmakers forgot why the survived Jews were dumped in Palestine after the WW II. Verily, it was done by leading Germanic powers of the US, Great Britain and France who did not save the European Jews from extermination and did not accept them as refugees from the Central and Eastern Europe. A very small group of Zionists was boosted by these policies.
We are shown one Israeli guy who managed to make his home at the Germanic building in Holland. He disagreed with the Palestine option devised for Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardic and Mizrahi groups of the Judean faith or origin. Yes, Jewish survival was possible on an individual basis. But it was not guaranteed for the masses that perished in the Holocaust giving a tremendous lift to Zionism. However, Zionist left wingers--power brokers in a nascent State of Israel--loathed ethnic cleansing and preferred the low intensity conflict in Palestine which became a battle cry for many nationalist Arabs, religious Zealots and international socialists. And thus Palestinian Jews were forced to get militarized and fight small wars.
The Israeli army units in Lebanon are not to blame for Sabra-Shatilla killings done by the Lebanese Christians who lost their President-peacemaker Bashir Gemayel killed by pro-Syrian (perhaps, Muslim) forces.
The filmmakers should bring responsibility for wars to their Anglo-Saxon Germanic masters!

I walk to Harvard to listen to Guy Grossman,
a founder of the conscientious objector movement in Israel. He is a new refusenik!
Guy speaks slowly, ""It's about Israel being
a democratic state in part of historic Palestine or
a non-democratic one in all of the Holy Land.""
His bald head shines like the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount.
He talks about the oppression of 3.5 million of people, the stone throwing, the suicide bombers, the shooting of motorists and the cutting of olive trees.
I recall a benevolent Jew from Newton, who went
to Israel to plant olive trees for Palestinian villagers.
The Arab elder later commented, ""Well, we appreciate help but we are not happy. We ourselves want to come to Jewish homes in distress and help them.""
Guy Grossman goes on, ""As occupiers we get
legal orders. In case by case these orders of a tree removal, a building demolition and car searches are perfectly legal. But the whole picture is illegal.""
It dawns on me suddenly that he uses a pure Talmudic dialectic. It's thousands of years of studying and commentary of the Bible. They still do it in Brooklyn, Mea Shearim and Brookline.
I say to Mr. Grossman, ""There is a Jewish town
of Safed in Galilee. It is surrounded by Arab villages. And there is a large Arab city of Jericho surrounded by Jewish settlements in Palestine.
They are very peaceful places. Cars are not attacked, no bomb explosions, no shootings.
Instead people come to markets, go about their daily lives eking the living.
What's their secret? Why are they so peaceful?""
Guy cannot answer my question.
It seems to me I know the answer.
The ancestors of modern Jericho people are not only Ishmaelites but also Idumeans who were great merchants, sex workers, caravan leaders and artisan stone cutters. After the three millennia of perturbations they love to grow papaya with enterprising Jews and to run their Jericho casino attracting Jewish money.
Being meek people, Jericho farmers, shopkeepers and ceramists have accepted their ""conquered"" status at this lowest place on earth.
They adjusted to it and they live better than their ""victorious"" adversaries in the highlands of Judea and Samaria.

This film goes far beyond memory as it explores not just the horrors of war but the long-term consequences of war on a soldier's psyche. The opening dream scene of the vicious pack of dogs running through the streets is as frightening as only a recurring nightmare can be and its animation makes it brutally vivid. This is a film about the innocence of young soldiers and the repressed memories of one, now older, attempting to piece together his participation in Israel's earlier attack on Lebanon.  It's a film that explores the terrible cost of war on the israeli soldiers  involved in the attack  but also, and most powerful, the terrible  violence inflicted on the inhabitants of the Palestinian camps in Beirut as Israeli troops watched from the city's rooftops nearby.

I need not have worried.  It's a beautiful piece of animation, breathtaking at times, but in terms of message -- blah.  It's not even that the author's platform is so relentlessly Leftist; it's that he fails to make much of a point at all.  Many reviewers have already noted the various bits he might have tossed in to put the thing in context, but from the film, and even more from the interview with the filmmaker that was included as a special feature on my DVD, I understand that teaching history was not his intent.  Rather, the message, if there is one, is that war is hell, people die and survivors suffer; this is an important message but one that is neither new nor is done particularly well in the film -- if you want to see what art can do with it, read Remark's ""All Quiet on the Western Front.""",1278979200,5,1056,4.422680412371134

3669514,5,B001KVZ6AM,"This movie is one of the best accounts of the trauma that affects young men -- boys really -- sent to fight wars which deeply affects them decades after.

The war in question is the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon which quickly went bad and ended up with the Israelis providing a security perimeter for Christina Falangists to enter the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla where they massacred several hundred civilians.

The Falangists were avenging the assassination of their leader, Bashir Gemayel, who gives his name to the movie's title. The Israelis ought to have know their Christian allies were bent on revenge. Moreover, on the night of the massacre, there were numerous reports trickling out of the camps that atrocities were taking place -- but no-one acted on them. The Israelis only stopped the killing the next morning.

Years later, through interviews with Israeli soldiers who took part in the war and psychologists, this animated movie examines the deep guilt and trauma many still feel. The animation is beautifully done -- some scenes are truly lyrical -- and it somehow allows the characters to become ""everyman."" We see young, poorly trained kids panic under fire and lash out by firing indiscriminately themselves killing civilians. We see a 12-year-old Palestinian kid wielding a rocket-propelled grenade, determined to kill and ending up himself being killed. The opening scene with ravening, yellow-eyes wolves bounding through the streets of Tel Aviv to howl under the balcony of one ex-soldiers is particularly striking.

These kind of scenes could apply to any war or insurgency and parallels between this conflict and the current U.S. struggles in Iraq and Afghanistan are clear and urgent. Yet there is a special Israeli angle. Some of these soldiers were the children of Holocaust survivors, making the moral failures of this war even more traumatic.

3669516,5,B001KVZ6AM,"""Waltz With Bashir"" is one of the great recent examples of how animation can be used not just as a tool for children's entertainment, but as a serious film medium that can have a powerful impact. It is unashamed at being an anti-war film, this is because the director lived and survived the 1982 invasion of Lebanon by Israel, he participated in it and had things to say through his memories and talent. Some on here are going nuts by bashing the film as ""anti-Israel,"" shocked at a movie that would present a realistic, honest portrait of a certain political fantasy they want to keep alive as do most statist devotees. But ""Waltz With Bashir"" is not just about Israel, it is about war in general, about the experience of war and the brutal reality of violence. As an animated movie, it has deeper, more intelligent things to say than typical gung ho works like ""Band Of Brothers"" or even the recent ""The Hurt Locker.""

The film chronicles director Ari Folman's search for his memories of the Lebanon War and more specifically, the Sabra and Shatila massacre, a brutal massacre of Palestinian civilians by the Nazi-inspired Christian Phalange, which at the time was supported by Israel considering the Phalange's leader, Bashir Gemayal, was a potential puppet ruler the Israelis sought to install (for a detailed account of the whole war and the assassination of Bashir Gemayal, read Robert Fisk's brilliant book ""Pity The Nation: The Abduction Of Lebanon""). Folman revists old army buddies to recount the war and his own memories of the night Israeli troops fired flares into the sky and stood by as the Phalange carried out is butchery.

This is not the sort of material one would immediately think of as cartoon material, but in the hands of Folman the movie is a masterpiece of the animation medium. The images are haunting and sometimes breathtaking in their depth and scope. Like the best films, the images sometimes say and express profound ideas not found in just the dialogue or plot. The beautiful music by Max Richter helps enhance the film's hypnotic power. Folman's story brilliantly travels from documentary to psychological landscapes, from questions of history and politics to topics of psychology and how memories work and transform themselves. Folman also manages to tell very human stories without resorting to holding big banners in our faces. The politics and other topics all come with a real sense of humanity.

One of the great achievements of ""Waltz With Bashir"" is how it uses its medium to explore the subject of war. There are moments as surreal as ""Apocalypse Now"" and as raw and honest as Oliver Stone's ""Platoon."" Folman is making big statements, but he makes them by simply sharing what he and his fellow soldiers witnessed during the invasion of Lebanon. The visions of war and death can sometimes be terrifying in their clarity. Like the great Israeli writers Uri Avnery and Gideon Levy, Folman doesn't march in step with those who only wish to glorify the Israeli state and every single one of its military operations, he puts a mirror to the reality of the violence and terror of war because no matter how much some try to paint over them with heroism, wars usually spiral into orgies of human corruption and criminal mayhem. In the era of Gaza and Afghanistan, ""Waltz With Bashir"" has very relevant things to say about the realities of occupation, the politics of war states and the human toll they impose on general populations. The ending of the movie is an especially shattering experience that brings the point home.

""Waltz With Bashir"" asks tough questions, which is more than can be said about typical movies these days. It challenges the viewer, this is no doubt what disturbs the die hard Israel supporters on here who immediately respond to the movies with a whole scroll of ""facts"" or ""historical notes"" instead of discussing what Folman has to say, or even the accuracy of what Folman shows (and it is accurate even when one looks at Israeli scholarship on the issue). This is an important war film, because it is actually about war itself, it isn't just trying to tell a war story. Folman has made a work of truth and conscience, it will stand the test of time.",1265846400,37,4212,4.80551724137931
3669517,2,B001KVZ6AM,I was disappointed by this film.  I had hoped for more insight regarding the Israel-Lebanon War.  I thought this merely an exercise in soul cleansing.  Not that that is bad.

An ""animated documentary"" which moves along in a way that most docs don't, Waltz with Bashir concerns itself with different perspectives on Israel's controversial 1982 war with Lebanon and delivers a load of fascinating material in addition to some beautiful images; the Academy may have passed over Folman's impressive film, but that doesn't mean you should.

3669519,3,B001KVZ6AM,"WALTZ WITH BASHIR is really a film in a class of its own. It is, in a very real sense, an animated documentary. Which initially begs the question: ""Why?"" Why film it in an animated fashion rather than simply interviewing soldiers directly and showing the reality of it via real people? This will be the hardest hump to get over for most viewers. I know it was for me. Many times, I said to myself, ""Gosh, I'd really like to see the real thing here.""

Some of it, I believe, was done to hide the true identities of those Israeli soldiers who might have been involved during the 1982 invasion of Lebanon. And who could blame them. The disaster that is the Middle East still rages from day to day.

The impression one gets from the film is that of a dream-(nightmare)-scape in which an Israeli soldier tries to piece together his memories (or lack thereof) regarding his time in the military and his involvement in the Lebanon invasion. This is shown in muted, yellow-ish colors that washes across the screen and gives the viewer a sense that something isn't quite right. And it isn't. The soldier is blocking something here, not wanting to remember, trying to put a positive spin (or absent spin) on what was surely a bloody mess. This was painful to watch on an emotional level because you knew that reality was far different, and far more brutal. One dream-scape involves the narrator being plucked off a boat by a beautifully large, buxom woman just before the boat explodes. One could only imagine the reality of what actually happened there.

Comparisons between this film and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persepolis/dp/B0017APPSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persepolis</a>&nbsp;were also quickly made, as one is an animated autobiography and the other an animated war documentary. But Persepolis stands out as the better of these two for one distinct reason: Persepolis would NEVER have been allowed to be filmed in Iran. Plus, it was a much cruder representation, with black and white thick drawings indicating the strictness of the Iranian government. Whereas here with Waltz With Bashir, it it often full color with the narrator sitting around a coffee table chatting with someone about his war experiences. It pulled the story down to a crawl when this happened, which made it less enjoyable.

Artistically speaking one can understand why director Ari Folman chose the animated medium in which to tell his story (the dream sequences are a prime example), but it still seemed just a tad forced, as if Ari were trying to do something different rather than telling a good story that probably (to my eyes) would've been more engrossing had it not been told via animation.

Still, this is a unique film amongst the animation genre. And one that many people might find entertaining. I thought it was just okay.",1263600000,2,2857,5.018987341772152

Although one-sided in its historic depiction, Folman's personal story of working back through the holes in his psyche is gripping.  The accounts of his friends as they fill in his experience are as triggering for viewers as Folman.  Somewhat intense and sensually disturbing, the graphic artistry is compelling and deceptively simplistic.  As memory serves detachment, the quality of animating such charged material creates a layer of psychological comfort for watching horrific events, at least until their reality becomes undeniable.

When I rented this film, I anticipated learning all aspects of a historical, but horrific event.  While a producer/director has a right to his/her focus for a film, it is dangerous, if not incendiary, to display only one side of any conflict.  The Israeli Defense Force has admitted to not vetting the Phalangists as well as they should have.  Consequently, they found themselves in a type of partnership with inexperienced and undisciplined men.  The massacre portrayed in this animated feature made no differentiation between those shooting indiscriminately and the well-trained IDF.  The IDF also had specific reasons to be in that villiage having been given intell that their enemies were hiding in private residences, etc.  We cannot even pretend to understand why the producer chose such a slanted portrayal, and no doubt, a great deal of damage has been perpetrated by this film. At best, it's superb animation; at worst a form of propaganda. If you would like to watch animation--well done--about a historical conflict, this film is for you, but if you want the complete truth about this event, you will not find it here!

This film makes the Israeli soldiers idiots lacking any sense of patriotism. They cry and moan about the Sabra Shatila massacre by the Christians but forget that the Palestinians provoked it by raping, murdering, and maiming thousands of Christians, 10,000 in the city of Demur alone! Israeli films tend to make Israelis evil and Palestinians heroes. They ignore the heroism of Israeli valiant IDF, and in the film Beaufort for example they portray them as whiners and cowards. Waltzing With Bashir makes it seem that Israeli soldiers wantonly kill civilians. Not true. Israeli army soldiers serve with honor. I've been one. No other army in the world has ever tried to protect the enemy civilian population as the IDF has, yet these Israeli, self-righteous leftist filmmakers make these ugly negative films about Israel and its people and IDF, when Israelis are a heroic nation that managed to make the desert bloom, built a modern nation surrounded by blood thirty enemies determined to kill its entire Jewish and Christian poulation . These filmmakers ignore and forget the sacrifice of the 22,000 young Israeli soldiers who've sacrificed their lives for the State of Israel to be a haven for the persecuted Jewish people, and other persecuted people, i.e., Israel took in Vietnamese Boat People when no one wanted them, and many African refugees. I'm ashamed of films like this one, the disgusting Lemon Tree, Syrian Bride, Paradise Now that glorified suicide bombers, Beaufort, James Journey To Jerusalem, all horrible disgraces. I don't see the Palestinians making films that apologize for murdering and maiming of Israeli civilians, and Christians civilians in Lebanon. They make films glorifying themselves as victimized and heroic. Israelis should learn. The Arabs may not fight as well as the Israelis on the battlefield, but they cunningly are winning the PR war helped by Isareli and American Jewish foolish traitor apologists.",1256083200,24,2081,5.196428571428571
3669536,1,B001KVZ6AM,"WALTZ WITH BASHIR got one thing right.  When it comes to compulsive self criticism, Jews and Israel can't be beat.

If I had just dropped in from Mars with little knowledge of world history, and my first history lesson was WALTZ WITH BASHIR, I'd assume that Israel was an immoral miscreant for trying to defend itself against a particular ideology that delights in killing Jews.  For example, on March 11, 1978, the PLO crossed from Lebanon into Israel, hijacked two buses, and murdered 37 people in cold blood, mostly kids.  During the course of Arafat's adventures in Lebanon, the PLO murdered thousands of Christians, conducted terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians and according to the U.N., violated  270 documented cease fire agreements.  These little facts, including any reference to terrorists, Fatah, the PLO, or endemic Jew-hatred in the Middle East were conspicuously absent from the movie.

Between 1975 and 1990, Lebanon suffered approximately 200,000 civilian fatalities in a series of running conflicts involving Muslims vs. Christians, Syrians vs. Christians, the PLO vs. both Jews and Christians and the U.S. Marines getting hammered in Beirut.  The number of civilians killed by the IDF was a small fraction of this number.  One major point that the movie failed to point out is that the government of Lebanon INVITED the Israelis into Lebanon to help them get rid of the PLO, which the IDF eventually succeeded in doing.  Part of the deal was to allow Arafat and his thugs to escape to Tunisia where Arafat could spend his days dreaming of dead Jews and basking in the glow of his European and Arab sycophants.  Then, in 1993, under the Oslo Accords, Jewish guilt plus temporary insanity caused Israel to invite Arafat and the PLO back to the West Bank.  Big Mistake!  Let's not forget that when Israel REALLY occupied the West Bank, and not just 1.7% as it does today, Israel built Palestinian Universities, roads, hospitals and the life expectancy of  West Bank Palestinians went from 44 to 67 years of age!

The movie gives the impression that Beirut was utterly destroyed by the IDF.  In fact, Beirut was largely in ruins due to Christian Phalange attacks against Palestinian positions well before the IDF arrived.  It is true that the IDF shelled and bombed buildings and allegedly killed several thousand civilians in an effort to destroy the PLO and related Palestinian terrorists.  This really got Europe and the U.N. upset because they believe that Jews should not be allowed to defend themselves unless they can absolutely guarantee that there will be no collateral damage.  Of course, the movie completely ignored the factors that compelled Israel to enter Lebanon in the first place.  History reveals that Europe and the U.N. were complacent, not only when the PLO terrorized Israel, but both Europe and the U.N. failed to mount any meaningful protest after the PLO murdered, raped and tortured the Christian residents of Damur.  Just as irritating is the fact that Europeans, who are in no position to criticize Jews, are probably unaware that Palestinian Muslims have been killing Palestinian Jews long before Israeli statehood in 1948.  Does Haj Amin al-Husseini and the Muslim Brotherhood ring a bell?  Probably not.

The final scene in the movie shows the massacre of Palestinians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Chatila.  These camps, in fact they are cities, became headquarters for the PLO.  NOTE:  WHY ARE THERE PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS IN THE FIRST PLACE?  Some 800,000 Jews were driven out of Arab countries between 1948 and 1950, and most of them were successfully integrated into Israeli society.  Why haven't Muslims accepted the Palestinians as equal citizens in any of their numerous nations?  In any case, the IDF agreed to let the Christian militias go into the camps and drive out the PLO.  The militias went crazy and took revenge on the Palestinians for murdering their families.  During the siege of the camps, some members of the IDF suspected that Palestinian civilians were being killed, but they didn't do enough to stop it.  In fact, the only recourse for the IDF would have been to go into the camps and start killing their Christian allies.  In the end, after all the suffering caused by the PLO, the only thing that the world remembers is the Israeli connection to Sabra and Chatila.

Also, the movie makes the IDF out to be the most inept, corrupt, perverted fighting force in existence.  One wonders how the IDF managed to win all its wars while receiving absolutely no American military aid during two of its most difficult defensive wars - Israel's War of Independence and the 1967, Six Day War?

3669537,5,B001KVZ6AM,"""Waltz With Bashir""
(Sony Pictures, 2008)
------------------------------------------
A complex and multi-layered examination of Israeli complicity in war crimes during the Lebanon War of the early 1980s. Director Ari Folman picks an unusual palette for such a dark topic, using animated cartoons that are in turns flat and alienating or fantastical and soul-piercing. In the story, the main character discovers that he has a memory block regarding his own actions in the 1982 Lebanon War, and gradually learns that he was present at and complicit in a human right atrocity. The film is a remarkably honest exploration of the Israeli psyche, examining the irony and guilt of a Jewish army supporting the same sort of mass executions that Jews had suffered (on a much larger scale) in World War Two.

The narrator doesn't go into great depth to explain the war or its causes; indeed, as a nineteen-year-old soldier he is frequently at a loss to explain or understand the events around him -- he only knows that he is in a war and that his survival depends on shooting his guns and following orders. This is a personal narrative that leads to a historical exploration, rather than the other way around. Those of us who dimly remember these events as distant news stories will find ourselves viscerally plunged in the middle of one of the most destructive urban conflicts of modern times, feeling the terror or warfare with the same sort of immediacy brought by other films such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Black Hawk Down,"" while at the same time we are made to contemplate the meaning of the war from an adult perspective, that of the filmmaker in his forties, decades after he went to war. It's a powerful film, challenging and unusually made, and well worth checking out. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1253232000,2,1809,4.911764705882353

3669539,1,B001KVZ6AM,"Preliminary notes:
1. This movie may have been an award-winner for Israeli audiences, who would have brought a lot of emotion and context to the movie, but this review is for the US audience.
2. I gave up about halfway through the movie, and would have given up much earlier but I kept telling myself ""With those great reviews, it can't possibly be this bad--I must be missing something.""

Animation can create realities that go beyond anything done by real actors, and the reviews had indicated that this movie was one of those situation.  Instead, the animation created substantial detachment from the story.  First, the animation does not flow: The storyboards leapt out at me and it seemed like the movie was moving through static panels in a comic book--a mediocre one with its abstract, stylized violence and unreality.  Second, the poor quality of the animation--such as arms moving without changing their articulation--is distracting, undercutting what is being said.

With the animation doing little more than showing you the location and who is talking, the movie has to depend upon the dialogue.  But here it also fails.  All the participants (before I gave up) gave descriptions of events that were detached, distant, flat, emotionless, clinical, ...  Even worse, most of them avoid talking about those events. There is the lead character who doesn't remember, the characters who talk about not talking about the events, and ones who ramble about irrelevancies to avoid talking about those events.  This may be realistic, but it does not make for a good movie/documentary.  Listening to depressed characters, who blur together, talk about nothing is painfully boring and depressing.

The combined effect of the cheap comic book visuals and the somnolent dialogue that goes nowhere is a surrealism that does not work.  It is not that I don't understand what the filmmaker was _trying_ to do, it is that he didn't achieve it.",1251504000,11,1935,5.050314465408805
3669540,5,B001KVZ6AM,"In this unique movie, Ari Folman tells the story of the Sabra and Shatila massacres in 1982 as it has never been told before. The Israeli soldiers were dragged by their government to be the unwilling accomplices to this massacre, watching the killing of civilians and feeling helpless during a war they didn't understand, against an enemy they didn't know. George Steiner said it perfectly:  ""Men are accomplices to that which leaves them indifferent.""

It's not the agony of Israeli soldiers alone, but the too often repeated story of young men dragged to war by their government for reasons they do not comprehend. It's very similar to current traumas of young men who can't cope with their life after the war.",1251072000,3,712,4.87603305785124
3669541,5,B001KVZ6AM,"Ari Folman's Waltz with Bashir (2008), a unique combination of Animation/Documentary/Biography/ Drama/ War is not easy to watch and almost impossible to forget. It is original and unusual but in its core it reminded me of a film from many years ago that explored persistence of memory which can't be stopped or avoided - ""Muriel"" (1963) directed by Alain Resnais. One of ""Muriel"" characters is a former soldier who was hunted by the memories of the war in Algiers and the local girl tortured and killed by the French soldiers. As in Muriel, the main theme of the Israeli film is reality vs. memory of it. Can we always trust ourselves with what we remember? Does our memory reflect the events the way they really happened or our vision of them is altered as time passes and new realities inevitably enter our lives? Ari Folman and his team use an innovative technique to tell the harrowing story.  It is the first time, a film-maker blends documentary and animation, history and fiction to create such powerful, tragic yet beautiful film which I simply can't stop thinking about.  By making himself a character of the film who tried to understand why he has no recollections of the events he had been a participant in some and an eyewitness to the others, and gradually unveiling the long hidden unbearable truth, it seems Folman made the film as a metaphor for the whole country trying to block from memory a very dark, difficult, controversial and shameful page in its history that is known as The Sabra and Shatila massacre. It was carried out between September 16 and 18, 1982 by the Lebanese Forces Christian militia group, following the assassination of Phalangist leader and president-elect Bashir Gemayel. It is not the purpose of this short review to comment on the Sabra and Shatila massacre. I just want to point out that the information available from the different Internet sources is not always complete. A very important fact has been omitted from Wikipedia that ""Israeli troops allowed the Phalangists to enter two refugee camps, Sabra and Shatila to root out terrorist cells believed located there. It had been estimated that there may have been up to 200 armed men in the camps working out of the countless bunkers built by the PLO over the years, and stocked with generous reserves of ammunition. When Israeli soldiers ordered the Phalangists out, they found hundreds dead (estimates range from 460 according to the Lebanese police, to 700-800 calculated by Israeli intelligence). The dead, according to the Lebanese account, included 35 women and children. The rest were men: Palestinians, Lebanese, Pakistanis, Iranians, Syrians and Algerians.""  ([...])

This is a very sad and powerful movie that left a lasting impression on me but I understand that not all viewers feel the same way. My husband kept saying, ""So what? What new did they say? The War, any war is dirty, unglamorous and destroying for every side involved. Thousands of innocent die tragically. The war brings shame and guilt, remorse and nightmares to the soldiers who follow orders."" I agree with him but I understand why the director Ari Folman who is a Veteran of the First Lebanon War has made the film and what he tried to achieve. For almost 27 years, the debates have never stopped regarding the responsibility of Israeli military for the massacre because the Sabra and Shatila camps had been under the control of The Israeli Defense Force (IDF). By the words of Folman, his goal was not naming the guilty parties but trying to understand what is going on with these who fought as the Israeli soldiers during the First Lebanon War in Beirut and saw the results of horrors with their own eyes. Explaining why he chose to make the film as a documentary in the animated format, Ari said that animation had given him the necessary freedom in his creative process and the chance to blend the facts of reality with the perceptions, feelings and deeply hidden images in the memories of the retired soldiers- his friends and comrades whose recollections of these few days in September of 1982 as well as his own made the film possible.

The technique which is actually a combination of Adobe Flash cutouts and classic animation has produced simple, gripping and fascinating images. The atmosphere is surreal to which the dark disturbing color scheme appropriately contributes. The visual originality and innovation are accompanied by sorrowful haunting  soundtrack and the songs written for the film that add to the deep emotional impact the movie made on me.",1250726400,6,4546,4.912760416666667

It would've helped to have pointed out why the Israelis were in Lebanon - a few ""real-live images"" of grieving Israelis whose kids were killed by infiltrating PLO gangs from out of Lebabonon (FOR YEARS!) might have helped. It would have helped explain the growing MUTUAL POLITICAL ADVANTAGE between Israel and Bashir's people in Lebanon to drive out the PLO! It should have been at least been mentioned, as it was a KEY element to driving out the PLO, which was a SMALL BUT TYRANNICAL terror organization INSIDE LEBANON at the time! HELLO???
The REASONS ISRAEL DIDNT TRY TO STOP the massacre WAS Bashir's people were not under Israeli control! They were in a very loose alliance, and it would have certainly led to a rupture, possibly even violence between Christian Philangist and Israelis if the Israelis would have tried to forcibly restrain the Philangists.
Now, the fact that these points are omitted are what bothers me, for this is the crux of the Left-wing problem: they pretend to be so compassionate for their enemies, they actually twist the truth which would have allowed for justification of their own actions.
THIS IS CERTAINLY NO DOCUMENTARY in the sense of trying to explain anything.
Nooo, let's show most Israli soldiers as uncaring, panic-stricken drive by shooters (from inside armored vehicles yet!); panicked and inept, one wonders how they won Independence, the 6-Day war and Yom Kippur war as well.
By leaving the impression Israelis are mindless villains EXCEPT for the reflective introspection of the few characters, the film loses so much balance that the psycholgy it might have opened a door to peruse, is drowned in the shmaltz of ""poor me, I'm too sensitive for all this;"" and aren't we Israelis terrible???

A veteran of the 1982 Lebanon War recounts his recurring nightmare to writer/ director/narrator Ari Forman, who is then motivated to seek out others' recollections of that war.  Because no footage exists of the interviewees' memories, Forman renders them and the subjects themselves in animation -- not the Disney/Pixar style, but in a technique that has a smooth-inked look rendered with the help of computers.  Oranges and reds have their brightness dulled into a kind of bleached monochrome.  The often surrealistic images are perfect accompaniments to the dreamlike recollections of the men who fought in the war.  The impact of this subject would have been reduced by a traditional, uncinematic talking-heads documentary style.  The animation combines fact, memory, and fantasy with striking imagery.  Available in both DVD and Blu-ray, the disc includes commentary and a Q & A with director Ari Forman, a making-of featurette, and a demonstration of how an animation scene is planned.",1248307200,,1073,5.421686746987952

Waltz with Bashir is a harrowing, compelling, haunting, beautifully sad and almost surreal journey into the memories of Israel Director Ari Folman.  This is a movie with much more purpose than to simply entertain.

A friend is plagued by disturbing dreams that stem from his experiences during the '82 Lebanon War.  When asked about any of his own recollections, Ari explains ""it's just not in my system"".  Anxious to jar pieces of his repressed memories and relive part of his past, Folman seeks out other soldiers that survived the same horrible tragedy.

This depiction of war is unlike anything I've ever seen.  Nothing noble or heroic here.  It shows almost nothing but chaos.  How fear and adrenhaline can overcome rationalization and training.  How innocent lives get sacrificed for absolutely nothing.  It expertly paints a cold and alarming picture about the senselessness of violence.

The artwork here is completely mesmerizing and really sets the tone.  A very dark tapestry of greys, mixed with occasional dull touches of yellow, blue, red, and green.  Haunting and brutal.

Like I said, this is a story like nothing you have ever seen.  At the end it shows actual footage of a grief stricken woman and the piles of dead bodies left from the massacre.  This is a grim reminder that this story is much more than just a collection of drawings.

In the final half hour, with its series of interviews with talking heads who were there (including a famous Israeli TV journalist) it becomes sort of a somewhat extended and not terribly original TV documentary. While a good movie, I found another animated film dealing with politics in the Middle East from a personal point of view, Marjanne Satrapi's Persepolis, to be more interesting and rewarding. And what is somewhat bothersome from Bashir, is not so much its leftist point of view, but the constant guilt and self-hate of its protagonist.

Folman has taken interviews with  the participants and animated them to create a surreal blend of documentary and actual footage that works very well. The animation allows the filmaker to explore such topics as dreams and memories in a way that would not have been possible in live action filmaking.

The story centers on the character of Folman himself in his effort to piece together his part in the events of that fateful war. Along his journey we meet others like him who all have parts of the story in their heads but not a complete whole because of repressed memories. The animation style by Yoni Goodman  is computer generated cut out animation and works quite well in this context. The animation is fluid and the storytelling is quite good. While this may not be a film for everyone is is well worth one or several viewings.

The Blu Ray disc contains an excellent transfer of the film, a commentary by Folman and three featurettes on the making of the film.

3669572,5,B001KVZ6AM,"Israeli director Ari Folman was a 19-year-old soldier during the 1982 war with Lebanon and was present during the tragic massacre on the Palestinian refuge camps by the Lebanese Forces Christian militia group that left hundreds (and perhaps thousands) dead.  He realizes years later during a conversation with a fellow veteran that he has no recollections of these events or about most of his time in the military.  He sets out to regain his memories by working with a therapist and interviewing other veterans with whom he served.  This project became the basis for a most unusual movie - an animated documentary (of sorts) about his journey.  As he slowly pieces together what happened and realizes that at least one of his few recollections was actually incorrect, the film builds toward a shattering, amazing conclusion.  Folman's artistic choices for the ending elevate a very good movie to an excellent film, placing the entire movie into context.

""Waltz with Bashir"" is a superb, one-of-a-kind film that was nominated for the Academy Award for best foreign film, the first animated movie so honored.  The movie consists largely of real-life interviews with veterans, with their stories brought to life through animation.  Some people are likely to argue that the film really isn't a true documentary; indeed, two of the participants opted to have their interviews re-enacted by actors (one of the interviewees smoked pot during his interview in the Netherlands and didn't want to have his real voice and (animated) face used).  Perhaps ""Waltz with Bashir"" is more of a docudrama.  However, categorizing this film is somewhat academic, as Folman himself acknowledges in one of the dvd extras.

The animation style of ""Waltz with Bashir"" is simplistic and clean, with many scenes designed in a monochromatic scheme apropros of the topic matter.  Audiences used to more colorful and detailed animation might find this style a bit bland but it ultimately helps tell the story and set the mood.  The use of music, including OMD's ""Enola Gay,"" is brilliant and again helps tell this story.  Given the political nature of this movie, it's not surprising that there has been some controversy about the story, especially when one character compares the massacre to the Holocaust.  However, good documentaries are often provocative, and ""Waltz with Bashir"" is likely to provoke debate as it sheds light on a moment in recent history that is relatively unknown to most viewers.  Finally, some might question why the movie is animated instead of using a more traditional re-enactment documentary style.  Folman doesn't offer many answers here; fortunately, it works beautifully.",1246320000,,2674,5.181395348837209

3669574,5,B001KVZ6AM,"In 2008, Ari Folman wanted to shoot out a clear message through his Israeli animated documentary called ""Vals Im Bashir"" (known as ""WALTZ WITH BASHIR"") that is about Folman's memories of the 1982 Lebanon War but it was his anti-war film that revolved around the 1982 Lebanon War but moreso for the Sabra and Shatila Massacre in which Pakistan and Lebanon refugees (thousands) were massacred.

The film was risky for Folman because of the difficulty of getting funding for the film because although it was a documentary, it was animated which is literally unheard of, for a documentary.  But it's storyline is a part of history that can easily open old wounds but also can help bring attention to a horrific time in man's past but also to learn from it.

""WALTZ WITH BASHIR"" has been so successful that it earned an Academy Award nomination for ""Best Foreign Film"", it won the Golden Globe Award for ""Best Foreign Language Film"", NSFC Aware for ""Best Film"", a Cesar Award for ""Best Foreign Film"" and an IDA Award for ""Feature Documentary"".  Needless to say, ""WALTZ WITH BASHIR"" is a powerful film in which Ari Folman sends us a clear message with his goals to show that there is nothing positive that can come out of war.

The documentary revolves around Ari Folman who served the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) back in 1982 during the Lebanon War.  It is 2006 and he is unable to sleep.  He appears to have these visions each night which he sees himself and other friends that were in the military floating in water and watching flares being shot into the sky.  Ari doesn't remember his military years and now he is in search of why he has been having these visions and what is real and what is not real.

So, we see Ari traveling to visit friends in different parts of the world.  Friends that he served in the 1982 Lebanon War with and hopefully get an idea of how he was during the war, if anyone remembered him and hopefully give him a clue of why these dreams/visions are happening to him now and why he doesn't remember anything from the war.

Throughout the documentary, we see a glimpse of Ari Folman's life as a young adult and his life in the military but the documentary doesn't just focus on his life.  We also learn about how others survived the 1982 Lebanon War who discuss their experience.  One who survived the war by escaping to sea alone while his comrades perished but upon returning home, there was no hero's welcome.  Another who covered the atrocities of the Sabra and Shatila Massacre and much more.

The documentary is unique in that Ari Folman utilizes animation that is not your typical animation but utilizing a style that focuses on colors and dark hues created with Adobe Flash and vector style of artwork and also utilizing CG artwork and classic animation.

So, for example, during an interview with a former soldier from back during the 1982 Lebanon War.  The person's mannerisms is captured well via animation and we see parts from the interview in the present but depicting their stories through animation.

From discussion of soldiers having to bring dead bodies back to the base, fellow soldiers being killed next to them and just the soldier's memories as they recount their war years, discussion about survival and the overall atrocities of war.  Even Folman going through therapy and trying to find out what these images in his head mean to him.

And as animation plays a big part in the film, as does music as we hear the music of electronic musician Max Richter, Public Image Ltd.'s ""This is Not a Love Song"", The Clique's ""Incubator"" and more.

But what makes ""WALTZ WITH BASHIR"" so amazing is the personal message delivered throughout the film about the 1982 Lebanon War but also Folman's message that there is nothing cool about war.  And then ending the film with a real life atrocity that when Folman finds out the truth of why he has blocked out his old war memory, its simply ends with an unforgettable scene.  A scene that echoes Folman's message of how war is simply not cool at all.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""WALTZ WITH BASHIR"" is simply a vibrant and colorful animated film featured in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  The amount of work that went into this film is just incredible and I was really enjoying the artistic style of Yoni Goodman and the Bridgit Folman Film Gang Studio in Israel.

Documentaries are typically not animated and many people today have tried to leave this part of history behind them but Folman was wise to take on a challenge and bringing this film out now and so, many people who are not familiar with the 1982 Lebanon War can now understand how atrocious this war had become leading up to the fateful, tragic Sabra and Shatila massacre.

The animation features good hues of amber, but also an animation style that effectively showcased emotion, violence and even sexual themes.  And each scene brings out a tremendous amount of amber oranges and reds, overall ""WALTZ WITH BASHIR"" was vibrant and picture quality was clear.

As for audio, the documentary is featured in Hebrew and English Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  It's one thing to have the dialogue and music come clear through the front channels but this film because it depicts war, does a great job of utilizing sound through the LFE channel and rear channels as well.  From a tank backing up, mortal shells and machine guns being fired, there are some scenes where the audio makes you feel immersed as sounds are literally all around you.

Overall, ""WALTZ WITh BASHIR"" is an animated documentary that looks great and sounds great and overall getting high marks in both categories!

As for subtitles, English SDH and English is featured on the main documentary track.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""WALTZ WITH BASHIR"" comes with a few special features (featured in standard definition with English and Hebrew subtitles) which include:

  * Commentary with Director Ari Folman - For the commentary, Ari Folman talks about the film in detail and things he wanted to accomplish but moreso being critical on why nothing was done to stop the Sabra and Shatila massacre.  There are quite a bit of areas where Folman does keep silent for long periods of time.
  * Q&A with Director Ari Folman- (9:16) Ari Folman talks about the film, why he created it and how difficult it was to get funding for the documentary and his personal feelings about war and how he wanted to show how there's nothing cool about war.
  * Surreal Soldiers: Making Waltz with Bashir - (12:03) Ari Folman and those working behind-the-scenes and making everything in the film work via animation.  How there was no rotoscoping done on the film, how sequences were done from scratch and how fragments in the face takes a lot of time and hundreds of cuts..  Learninga bout imitating human behavior, catching real life movements, color design, music and taking animatic risks.
  * Building the Senes - Animatics: This segment features four animatics which include the edited footage and storyboard: ""Beirut Street Battle"" with ""Ron Ben-Yoshai"", ""The Fighting Arts with Shmuel Frenkel"", Tank Patrol with Dror Heraz and ""Attack in the Orange Grove"".
  * Theatrical Trailer - (2:03) The actual original theatrical trailer

JUDGMENT CALL:

After watching ""WALTZ WITH BASHIR"", I couldn't help but applaud Ari Folman and crew for taking the risks in making sure this film was made.  In the commentary, Folman talked about how his friends who were part of the film suddenly didn't want their names being publicly used because of their fear of what kind of reception the film would bring.

I was shocked beyond words of how the documentary ended.  It was devastatingly real.  For anyone who had to see these atrocities and unable to do anything to stop it and the government not doing anything about it, I can see how these people feel powerless and I can see for Ari Folman, why this documentary was important for him.

Folman commented on how American war films tend to show the unity, the brotherhood, the glory of battle.  But how he was dissatisfied of how the films had heroes.  But for him, having served in a war, there is nothing cool about war.  There were no heroes.

So, the film opened my eyes to another part of man's history of atrocities that probably many people especially those of us in the United States and other parts of the world are probably unaware of what happened back in 1982.  Immediately after the film, I found myself researching the war and the massacre on the Internet and I was just in disbelief and shock because I never knew that such a thing took place.

There is so much I would like to talk about certain parts of the film but mentioning anything else on this review, can easily spoil the film.  So, in a way, I prefer viewers who are wanting to experience something difference, especially through this unique style of animation used for a documentary, to please watch ""WALTZ WITH BASHIR"".

The animation and overall picture quality was absolutely beautiful and vibrant, the audio quality features really awesome audio depicting the war.  I enjoyed the respected nod to Japanese animation mention by Folman during the audio commentary.  I also enjoyed the various special features and putting his group of animators to work and bringing out the best in them to create a memorable animated documentary.

There is simply nothing bad I can say about this animated documentary.  It's just well-done, a message that is so chillingly clear and so real, needless to say that ""WALTZ WITH BASHIR"" is one of those films that you won't be able to forget.

Overall, ""WALTZ WITH BASHIR"" is a unique and powerful film worth checking out on Blu-ray!

3669575,5,B001KVZ6AM,"Waltz with Bashir - film review.

This film carries itself on two levels, as entertainment, and as a documentary.

As far as the documentary goes, towards the end we get the final perspective of just what the Lebanon war was like. Eventually, Israeli soldiers are plainly described [by the narrator] as young drafted Nazis, marching into war as ordered--not to be mistaken for the murderous S.S. troopers, whose appearance is played by the Lebanese Christian militia (The Phalangists)--who commit the massacres against the Palestinian refugees. Yet it's the Israelis who barely react to their own consciences when they know what's wrong is wrong.

As an animated movie, it's a fantastic visual journey of vicious imagery and a puzzle that strategically unwinds to reveal itself. This is a story told through non-linear flashbacks and dreams sequences. Towards the end, the script seems to run out of steam and is replaced by pure documentary as the last parts of the story are told through witness interviews.

Waltz with Bashir is artful, sad, provocative and extremely relevant.",1245542400,5,1080,5.189655172413793
3669576,5,B001KVZ6AM,"When I first saw the trailer for Waltz with Bashir, I was taken aback by its trippy, surreal vibe--it reminded me of a Hebrew A Scanner Darkly. Although I was immediately excited to see it, I wasn't sure about its overall quality, considering how ambitious it seemed. The blurbs, strategically inserted throughout the ad, boasted the film as ""groundbreaking,"" ""stunning,"" etc., but I couldn't tell why.

As soon as it was available in my area, I went to see it, and was floored. It was every bit as outstanding as the multitudes of rave reviews heralded. The film melds the hallucinatory aesthetic of a Flash animation film with a documentary, one man's empirical study of his own memory loss and traumatizing past. To beat the thoroughly bludgeoned horse, I've never seen anything like it.

The opening sequence sets the tone for the entire film. A throbbing techno beat resounds on the soundtrack as the camera pans over an animated city landscape, decimated, grimy, and bleak. Out of an alley jumps a black dog, foaming at the mouth, eyes lucid. More dogs are seen joining the first, and they run through the streets, unchecked, knocking aside passerbys and trash cans, never breaking pace. It is an unsettlingly surreal scene, with the run-down city backdrop giving a nightmarish quality to something that would normally seem just strange. The film then proceeds to tell the story of the narrator, Ari Folman, and his attempts to regain his memories of the Lebanon War.

How do the dogs tie in to his search? In brilliantly realized memory scenes, the viewer is left to form their own theories as to their significance. The film never gives anything away--it leaves you to ponder, a film to be digested rather than viewed in passing. And if you take the time to fully understand the implications and the emotional resonance (especially noticable after the heart-stopping final revelation), it is an immensely rewarding film experience.",1240704000,,1939,4.96

3669579,4,B001KVZ6AM,"Ari Folman, the Israeli documentary filmmaker, has now come out with one of the most provocative and original anti-war films in quite awhile. Waltz with Bashir focuses on Folman's recollections as a young soldier in the Israeli Army during the war in Lebanon in 1982. It employs a combination of Flash, hand-drawn and computer-enhanced 3-D modeling.

The film begins with jarring images of rabid dogs running wildly through the streets of Tel Aviv. It turns out that this is a recurring nightmare that Folman's Army veteran friend, Boaz, has been having for the past 2  years. Folman himself has virtually drawn a complete blank as to his wartime memories except for one disturbing surrealistic image of he and two soldier comrades, completely naked, slowly wading through the ocean at night onto the beach in Beirut. Boaz urges Folman to try and recover his memories so he seeks out a succession of veterans who he was in combat with as well as other veterans who also had experiences in Lebanon.

First Folman visits Carmi, an old friend who was in Folman's unit who is now a successful businessman in Holland. Carmi has no recollection of Folman's dream about wading onto the beach but recalls how when his unit first arrived in Lebanon all their training went out the window due to fear and they were firing their weapons continuously and indiscriminately when first entering enemy territory. This lack of discipline results in the Carmi's unit firing on a Mercedes that pops up out of nowhere, resulting in the death of a family inside the vehicle. On his way back to the airport to return to Israel, Folman begins to recover some of his repressed memories.

The middle of Waltz with Bashir deals with further interviews with other Lebanon war veterans as well as with psychiatrist who is an expert on post-traumatic stress disorder. The stories from these interviews are fascinating: one soldier is left on the beach after his tank is hit by RPG fire; after the other tanks retreat he hides from the PLO until nightfall and then swims in the ocean for miles and is luckily found by his own unit, miles from where they left him. Ironically, the soldier feels guilt that his fellow soldiers didn't make it and is also shunned by the surviving members of his unit who convey the unspoken message that he deserted his fallen comrades.

Other disturbing stories emerge from Folman's interviews and recollections. A 10 year old Palestinian fires a hand-held missile launcher and blows up a tank; he in turn is blown away by an advancing group of Israeli soldiers in a grove of trees. An Israeli officer spends his down-time fast-forwarding a German porn tape inside a captured villa. And as a group of soldiers are pinned down as they're being fired upon from skyscrapers at the beach front in Beirut, a soldier does his ""Waltz with Bashir"" as he wheels round and round, firing his machine gun up at snipers, managing to avoid being hit (Posters of Bashir, the soon-to-be assassinated Christian Prime Minister, appear everywhere in Beirut and are seen in the background as the soldier fires wildly at the snipers).

Waltz with Bashir culminates in an examination of the infamous massacre of approximately 3,000 Palestinians by Christian Phalangist militiamen in the refugees camps of Sabra and Shatila. One thing is clear: the Israelis were not directly responsible for participating in the massacre although many people in the Muslim world still believe that the Israelis were direct participants. One of the film's weaknesses is the failure to point out that the Palestinians were not the ONLY victims of the Lebanon war and that massacres were committed by the PLO against Christians prior to massacres in the refugee camps.

Nonetheless, an Israeli commission found the Army (under the head of Ariel Sharon) to be responsible for allowing the Phlangists into the refugee camps and acting indifferently, allowing the massacres to occur. The Commission concluded that the Army should have known that the Phalangists were out for revenge given the murder of Bashir two days before as well as the history of bad blood between the two groups.

It finally comes back to Folman; he wasn't on the front lines right next to the camps but was stationed on a rooftop where flares were continually being shot up, allowing the Phalangists to commit their horrific deeds while the sky was lit up during nighttime. Folman obviously feels a great deal of remorse for the Israeli soldiers' inaction during the massacre. Some writers here feel that Folman's viewpoint is one of a left-wing, self-hating Jew. But is it? Given the Jewish people's own victimization during the Holocaust, one would think they should hold themselves to a higher standard; despite being continually attacked by the PLO, they still had a responsibility to minimize civilian casualties.

Waltz with Bashir employs an eclectic soundtrack including pop songs from the period of the Lebanese War which adds to the film's verisimilitude. Coupled with the unique animation and the introspective voice-overs, Bashir points out the cost of the war in terms of human suffering as well as the deleterious psychological effects upon the surviving veterans.

Waltz with Bashir's final shots, where the animation is dispensed with and we see the actual scenes of the aftermath of the refugee camp massacre, is the only heavy-handed moment in the film. It's at that point we feel that the filmmaker has discarded his introspective, personal outlook and tried to make a political point. Despite the awkward ending, Waltz with Bashir is filled to the brim with jarring images that will remain with you for a long time, narrated by men who have been through hell.",1236988800,2,5709,4.96234309623431
3669580,5,B001KVZ6AM,"The honesty with which the director confronts the criminal aspects of a war fought by his country equals or surpasses ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"". A really good, honest American film about Iraq would probably look a lot like this. I wasn't sure whether animation was the best medium for the film, but any doubts I may have had were more than compensated by the extraordinary way music was used in the film.
But be warned, it is emotionally harrowing. (The film is also a good reflection of the extreme contradictions of Israeli society. That such a critical film could be made at all - something inconceivable in any Arabic-speaking country - is already extraordinary, that it was actually made with the support of the Israeli government highlights the extent of freedom of expression in Israel, which I think puts even the US to shame. And yet they elected a government of ultra-nationalist, almost fascist, parties ...)",1236902400,,934,4.917721518987341
3669581,5,B001KVZ6AM,"I'm compelled to write this review after watching the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Foreign Film selectors botch yet another award. David Ansen wrote in Newsweek last year about how the selection committee's decision-making, umm, 'process' is the industry's ""long-standing joke.""  The right films don't even get nominated (Ansen's article centered on the egregious omissions last year of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Months-3-Weeks-and-2-Days/dp/B00151QYE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Band-s-Visit/dp/B0013HL6ES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Band's Visit</a>).  And the ultimate winner is often the ultimate head-scratcher: faced this year with two sure-fire classics - this film and the equally worthy French offering&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Class-Entre-les-murs-Theatrical-Release/dp/B001AVCFGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Class (Entre les murs) [Theatrical Release</a>] - the committee chose instead the little-known (and almost completely unseen) Japanese nominee&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Departures-Theatrical-Release/dp/B001PR0YIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Departures [Theatrical Release</a>].  With all due respect to those filmmakers, you could hear the sense of bewilderment in the hall as the dazed winners (I suspect even they were dumbfounded) made their way to the stage.  I'm sure that bewilderment was mixed with murmurs from an audience of insiders - something along the lines of ""unbelievable, they've blown it again.""

A shame because this film is among the best you'll ever see - it's writer/director Ari Folman's attempts to deal with his repressed memories of his role in the Sabra and Shatila camp massacres during the 1982 Lebanon War.  Folman's innovative use of animation allows him to re-stage the memories of his fellow soldiers.  At the film's end, Folman's role (or at least his proximity to the events) is revealed and animation segues into real-life footage of what transpired in the camps.

The Golden Globe committee - with a far more firmer grasp on common sense than the Academy - handed 'Waltz' its award for the best foreign language film of 2008.

Ansen's article from last year reveals the Academy's ""attempt to reform a misbegotten system,"" and concludes that ""Mark Johnson, chairman of the committee, has vowed further reforms.  History suggests it's going to be an uphill battle.""

Keep working at it, Mr. Johnson.  This thing is still broken.",1235520000,17,2678,6.798245614035087
8316194,5,B001KVZ6AM,"NINE THINGS ABOUT ""WALTZ WITH BASHIR""

1. Dont let the title fool you. This is not about dancing. At least, not in the way you're thinking.

2. This is an Israeli war documentary. It is animated, and quite surreal.
The movie is about how the filmmaker, Ari Folman, realized that he had no memories of fighting in the 1982 Lebanon war, even though he knows he was there.

3. A chance comment by a friend triggers a memory in Ari, and he begins to hunt for the rest of his memories.  He eventually discovers that he had witnessed (and committed?) evil things that occurred in Lebanon during the war.

4. This movie is banned in Lebanon.

5. This movie is violent. It's a ""cartoon"" but it's not family safe. The surreal animation makes the violence both easier to watch and harder to watch.

6, This is the first movie Ive seen that is specifically about PTSD, the psychological trauma that causes it, and the consequences of it. And in my opinion, they get it right.

7. The actual ""waltz with Bashir"" is one of those iconic moments that capture so much that cannot be explained in words.

8. The animation style is exquisite. It partly reminds me of Ralph Bakshis technique, but it has its own character. I don't think this movie would have worked if it were not animated.

9. This is a hard movie for anyone recovering from trauma to watch, but it will be easy for them to understand. Its both beautiful and horrifying. It is clumsy and graceful and awkward. Just like the world we live in.",1524960000,,1490,4.464944649446495

8316203,5,B001KVZ6AM,"Unusual in that it takes the form of an animated documentary, ""Waltz With Bashir"" is also the first feature-length Israeli animated film produced in several decades.  It concerns the filmmaker's quest to regain the memories of his participation in the 1982 Lebanon invasion, as a teenager in the IDF.  The film alternates between his present-day discussions with his fellow soldiers, and dramatic recollection of the events themselves as he struggles to recall his own role in them and in the Sabra and Shatila massacre of Palestinian civilians by Lebanese Phalangist forces.  The soldiers are presented as children, not completely understanding the scope of the conflict or its ultimate goals.

The soundtrack includes covers of songs by Cake and others that both augment and comment on the action.  The Max Richter score is outstanding, although I was annoyed that obvious allusions to Bach's F-minor concerto, Schubert's E-flat trio, and what I am certain is a passage from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Koyaanisqatsi/dp/B0027534EU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Koyaanisqatsi</a>&nbsp;were not credited.
