8524281,3,B008309CTY,"Besides the open way sex and social climbing are treated (among heterosexuals) and the explicit references to marijuana and cocaine in the previous years to the Hays Code enforcement in American cinema, ""Bachelor Apartment"" is interesting for it was written by open leftist playwright John Howard Lawson, a Jewish-American who would become a member of the US Communist Party, president of the west wing of the Writers Guilds of America and one of the ""Hollywood Ten"" who were imprisoned and black-listed during the  anti-communist pursuits of Republican U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy in the early 1950s. However there is not much here to consider as progressive, daring or a menace to the status quo, apart from the female leading role, a working class woman whose dignity and self-respect (especially as played by Irene Dunne) set her apart from the other women in the movie. In the end it follows the romantic comedy formula, and reinforces the traditional gender and social roles of both men and women. So it is no wonder that Lawson decided to go South and learn a bit about social classes in 1934, after being accused by his fellow party members that he had ""a lack of ideological and political commitment"" and wrote ""adolescent works that lacked moral fiber or clear ideas"". But for its historical value, fast rhythm and a couple of enjoyable characterizations (by Mae Murray, a gentler version of Mae West, and Charles Coleman as the butler, with a curious scene full of innuendo in his exchange with a messenger) ""Bachelor Apartment"" is worth a look.",1477699200,,1557,4.9655172413793105
