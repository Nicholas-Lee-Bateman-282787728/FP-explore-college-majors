I first saw it in Greenwich Village at the TriBeCa festival, years ago. It was the era of ""Clerks"", ""The Brothers MacMullen"" and others from Jim Jarmusch, Hal Hartley and (early) Spike Lee that - briefly - captured America's attention.

""Criminals"", is a raw, gleefully unpolished, small-budgeted neo-Film Noir with Black Comedy elements.  Like those other films, it puts the weight of the story squarely on the shoulders of the quirky characters.  And here, Stephen Blackehart (Super) & Robert Margolis (Ed's Next Move) deliver the goods. I love stories like this.",1305072000,,1001,7.24793388429752
