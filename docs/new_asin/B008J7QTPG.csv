5168242,2,B008J7QTPG,"Spoiler alert.

Hard to believe hostage scene. Turns out only one kidnapper is dangerous and yet all the hostages sit frozen to their seats as the dangerous criminal drives the bus with both hands and his back to them. Also, the snipers have a zillion shots, particulalry as they really have only one target. Just totally strained writing.",1412380800,,339,4.844827586206897
5168243,2,B008J7QTPG,"Thank you for your review, Gideon Reader.  It confirmed our decision to not watch Season 2.  My husband and I shook our heads throughout each episode of Season 1, which proved to be totally underwhelming and a far cry from the excellent Heat of the Sun, which we've watched twice.",1397952000,,280,4.58
5168244,5,B008J7QTPG,everything he is in is great. this is a great series and I should recommend it to anyone who likes good drama.,1397001600,,110,4.045454545454546
5168245,4,B008J7QTPG,International negotiator for high profile kidnappings. Fun scenery and cultural splashes in each episode. Clever twists and turns of deceit and manipulation along the way.,1391904000,,171,5.88
5168246,5,B008J7QTPG,"The British know how to make a drama. Don't be concerned with the pretentious negative review, it's most likely from a teenager. I don't care what country you are from , you will like this show if you like exciting dramas with plot twists. This is an exceptional show period. Thanks",1376179200,,282,4.549019607843137
5168247,4,B008J7QTPG,Lots of action and twists in the story.  It kept  my attention and I am hoping for a third season.,1373068800,2,98,3.85
5168248,4,B008J7QTPG,"Good story with good character developments. The British have a knack for developing great TV dramas. The story was timely, the setting realistic, the charachter development complete. Trevor Eve iplays the perfect negotiator....cool headed, smart, and totally believable. I thought the story in season 2 was filled with great twists and turns  Hope it comes back for season 3",1365638400,,375,5.3559322033898304
5168249,5,B008J7QTPG,Not as spell binding as series 1 but well worth watching.  Trevor Eve never disappoints.  I've been a fan since the Politician;s Wife.,1361232000,,134,4.782608695652174
5168250,1,B008J7QTPG,"...boring staff,  unfamiliar with the entire subject of Hostage negotiating and were bereft of a marginally interesting story, had wooden acting, irritatingly poor production values and
direction made with a baseball bat rather than a baton, you would have over fed Trevor Eve wandering aimlessly BUT psuedo
commandingly as a somewhat hapless ""Hostage Negotiator"". If in trouble check the Yellow pages for someone competent.
An almost painful to watch show. Series 2 K&R arrived before Series 1.
I do not believe I have it in me to watch it. Maybe. Maybe not. And THAT is the trouble with this show.
If you miss it, you do NOT miss it.

UPDATE: Series 2 arrived.
I took myself hostage and forced a viewing. the verdict is in.
This is a plethora of game. A turkey. A fish left too long in the Sun.
A true stinker.
No mas. No mas.",1351123200,,828,4.587837837837838
