8644343,3,B00IP01SJ4,"The series is great.  The plots and acting are excellent.  However, the quality of the discs are not up to par.  Several of the episodes either won't play or they stop in the middle.  More than one disc will not load.  We are very disappointed that we aren't able to see all of the episodes as this was an excellent show.",1446336000,,321,4.19672131147541
8644344,1,B00IP01SJ4,A second copy was sent to me and it had the same errors as the first one. The first three discs of Season two are identical. I have returned them.,1406678400,2,146,3.9
