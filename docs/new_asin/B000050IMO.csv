1385517,5,B000050IMO,"This was a really cute family film---it shows that the underdog CAN rise to the top and win the prize.  Of course, it didn't hurt to have Frankie Muniz as the star; he is a very talented and likeable young actor.  No wonder Malcolm in the Middle is such a big hit.",978739200,,264,4.0576923076923075
1385518,5,B000050IMO,"Miracle In Lane 2 stars ""Malcolm In The Middle's"" Frankie Muniz. This is a true story about a boy named Justin Yoder who has to be handicapped for his whole life. Justin Yoder (Frankie Muniz) wants to be like his older brother and play all the kinds of sports. One day Justin (Frankie Muniz) was helping his brother and his brother's friends deliver newspapers when he came across a paper that was talk about the Soap Box derby. Justin asks his parents and his parents don't think it was a good idea because of Justin's condition. The Yoders neighbor helped Justin and his dad build a soapbox car. This is after Justin's parents decide Justin can race. One day while Justin was racing he had to go to the hospital because of an accident when he passed out. The other boy that was racing Justin had to drop out so then Justin got to go to the finals. Once Justin found out that he was going to the finals his brother didn't want Justin to go because he thought Justin would have another accident. Once Justin competes against the last person his family members and his neighbor cheer Justin on while at the end of the race they see that Justin won. That day Justin was excited because he won the soapbox derby and won a trophie just like his older brother.",977788800,5,1255,4.413793103448276

His family is very active in sports, and he is trying to live up to the reputation set by his fater and older brother. It is an insperiational story about over comming life's obsticles. I would reccoment this movie to be part of your collection for children as well as adults to enjoy.",1216944000,,362,4.260869565217392
1385572,5,B000050IMO,"Through Justin's character I see a part of me, and other young disabled people who are trying to make a stand, showing who they are.
It was nice he'd won the prize trophy,but gaining respect was more rewarding.
Seeing his older brother react reminded me of my own family. A siblings ""need"" to be wanted, and not over looked, is common in a home like Justin's. Strangely awkward the ""affected"" wish for normalcy, and desire doing activities their loved one takes for granted. We would undoubtedly favor playing in their baseball games, than siting on sidelines looking onward, because our muscles don't allow. All those surgeries, rehab, and medicines we'd trade, in an instance, to run those bases,in a home run, and hear people erupt when we did so.
I recommend this to families of disabled kids, and their siblings who don't have a disability to understand the other side of the coin!",1207958400,,886,4.7973856209150325
1385573,5,B000050IMO,"A feel-good movie based on a true story. Frankie Muntz does a wonderful job of playing a boy with a shunt in his neck. The boy feels a need to be normal and find his niche like his older brother. I love his version of God. ""God's explanations are pretty good for a race car driver. I don't care for the final scene in this movie but I can look over it. There are a few life threatening scenes that may be too intense for younger children but it is a sweet, sweet movie that I recommend to the whole family.",1205280000,,506,4.01980198019802
1385574,5,B000050IMO,"When I first saw this movie on the Disney Channel, I was 13, and from there I was totally in love with the movie. My nephew went through something similar, unfortuantly he passed away about a week after the movie Debuted. Frankie Muniz is so believable in this Movie that you actually believe he's going through it in real life. I think this is the Best Movie by far for Frankie Muniz. I was an avid Disney Channel viewer at age 13 and this film also had alot of Disney channel Stars in it.",1199404800,,490,4.223404255319149
1385575,5,B000050IMO,"I have a vision impairment, so I could relate to having over-protective parents, but the thing that I related to more was Justin's brother. I had a severely handicapped brother (he passed away when he was 10) and so I can DEFINITELY understand where the brother was coming from. There is a constant struggle between wanting the same amount of attention that your ""special"" sibling is getting and being afraid something will happen to that sibling.

So in a nutshell, I thought it was a great movie. The part at the end where Justin gets to see what heaven looks like was kinda weird, but I think it was just a way of saying that in heaven everyone is on an even playing field.",1171670400,,676,4.451612903225806
1385576,5,B000050IMO,"I throughly enjoyed this movie, but with the exception of ONE TINY DETAIL. During one of Justin's many racing scenes on his way to the soap box derby final, there is a quick panning over to a boy in the crowd. At the end of the movie, they showed pictures of the real Justin. My little sister was quick to notice a strange similarity between him,and the boy in the crowd. After closely observing his face,(we took pictures),we realized that the boy in the crowd was ACTUALLY THE REAL JUSTIN, SITTING THERE SMILING WHILE WATCHING HIS ACTOR COUNTERPART WIZZZ ON BY. Why the makers of this film chose to do that is beyond me. It seems rude, and very unjust to the real Justin. I mean, they didn't even make it a good role. He just sat there. And smiled. I was personally wierded out. I truely hope that you go back through the movie and see this. It's really worth it. Just wanted you to know.",1152662400,,890,4.335329341317365
1385577,5,B000050IMO,"ok, until I saw this film five years ago, I thought no one knew ANYTHING about Spina Bifida! i thought it was the rarest thing in the world to have! I LOVED this film! it was sooo true! everything from the way his family reacts when he has a headache, to the God sequences, was absolutely true to life!!I've asked myself and God, those same questions! this movie does a great job of teaching the humor in everything! the things Justin finds dire, will make other people with SB, die laughing because we think the same thing! I cant say enough great things about this film! its a good film to show to young ones, to teach them about disabled people! this movie is sooo funny!",1127606400,4,674,4.357142857142857
1385578,4,B000050IMO,"Coming from a young adult with spina bifida, Disney actually got something right this time!  I was thoroughly impressed with their handling of a sensitive issue.  They explained medical issues simply, where even young kids could understand.  They very accurately portrayed the tension that comes up in a family with a handicapped member.  And they did a great job of putting a comedic spin on what can often be frustrating and embarrassing situations (like when Frankie's character has a reflex gag issue and throws up on the Little League director).

One thing I did have a problem with: their portrayal of God and Heaven.  While it is true that God does not make mistakes, and I have seen many times when He has used my disability for good, I will NOT have these handicaps in Heaven.  It is misleading and very disappointing that Disney took this stance.",1127260800,6,856,4.782312925170068
1385579,5,B000050IMO,disney did a good thing shooting a movie about a wheel chair bound boy named Justin Yoder(based on a true story). I also like the scenes when they are in the court room deciding whether Justin should play baseball or not I like how the mom always defends him because hes handicapped and should have the right to play. this is a good movie.,1039392000,3,339,4.3125
1385608,5,B000050IMO,"This is a wonderful movie ""inspired by the life of"" Justin Ross Yoder and his soap box derby racing. Justin was 10 years old when I first met him in Akron in 1997. I visited with him in L.A. during the filming of the movie in February 2000 and again in Akron in 2001. The movie has brought so many new racers to the derby and that's really great. Justin is a true soap box derby hero as he paved the way for other children with his ""Justin Brake"" and winning spirit. I want to clarify that the movie was greatly inspired by the life of Justin. It's not a documentary. I was in the movie too, along with my husband and my daughter, Dolline, the 1997 Super Stock World Champion (the kind of car Justin raced early in the movie). We had a great time on the set and learned alot about making movies!",1018915200,3,795,4.135483870967742
1385609,5,B000050IMO,"I just watched this film on the Disney channel, along with my 8 year old niece and brother-in-law.  It was so touching and refreshing to see inspiring true stories, such as Justin Yoder's receiving such exposure in mainstream television.  What a great role model for young and old alike.  Justin's spirit really shines through with Muniz's portrayal - ALL of the supporting cast were excellent!  The film touched on so many different aspects of children and disabilities, along with how it impacts the family and friends in so many intense ways.  And yet, it didn't focus on the issue of Justin's disability.  Rather, it simply told a heartwarming story of just how powerful one individual's spirit can be.  I highly recommend this film.",1015286400,8,737,4.943089430894309
1385610,3,B000050IMO,"It's about a boy who is handicapped and his brother has alot of Trophy's and he wish's he had a Trophy but they asked if he could play in sports and the Coach's would say no so when Justin see's this movie the guy made who lives across the street he tells his parents he wants to play in Soap Box Derby at the final race at Soap Box Derby Justin's dream come's true.
This movie is a True story.
You may deffintely want to buy this movie.",1012780800,,437,3.977272727272727
1385611,5,B000050IMO,"Let me start out by saying that even though this is a Disney movie, I'm 29 and I love it!  It's the true story of an Indiana boy who has Spina Bifida and all he dreams about is winning a trophy in anything.  After several misshaps, he gets insterested in soap box racing and becomes successful at it.  The movie is not overly sentimental or sappy and is very truthful in how disabilities affect families.  It shows that no matter what, if you dream about something and work to make it happen, it will happen.  Another thing it teaches is that some people discriminate against those that have disabilities and that anyone, even a teenage boy can overcome those who discriminate.
See it on the Disney Channel, Rent it on video or buy it for your own collection (I own it).",1010620800,,770,4.432624113475177
1385612,5,B000050IMO,this movie is great because it has malcolm.  it is a heartwarming story about him in his competition against the win at all costs overbearing father of the girl.  it is just like a Full house episode,997401600,,199,4.351351351351352
1385613,5,B000050IMO,"I'm not much for made-for-tv movies, but this one is very good. It stars Frankie Muniz(Malcolm in the Middle) as a kid with a rare birth defect that has paralyzed him from the waist down. I am glad it was released to video.",988588800,,223,4.209302325581396
1385614,4,B000050IMO,I think that this movie was a touching movie. My little sister has what the boy in the film has but she is not paralized. She likes it because she sees that the boy goes throught the same things as her. I like it and I think it is a great family film.,985478400,,251,3.7547169811320753
1385615,1,B000050IMO,"I didn't expect much from ""Miracle in Lane 2"" Yet I checked my local lisitings every month or so hoping that I would see it soon. For no other reason than to laugh. Laugh at Disney's blindness. Only brainless executives could dream up a movie in which Frankie Muniz plays the wheel-chair bound protagonist. The same young actor who plays TV's Malcolm, whose family regularly uses Stevie (the show's wheelchair-bound character) as a comedic whipping boy.  Believe it or not, Muniz is the least of the movie's problems. Granted I am seventeen, do not watch the Disney channel, and I am certain that I am not included in the film's target audience. However that does not excuse the movie's shortcomings. I think that an older, more critical eye is just what this movie needs. Hopefully this review will stop parents from buying this video for their children, or sitting them in front of the TV to watch it re-run.  First, I do admit that I am aware that this movie was based on a true story, I have not researched the particulars and do not know how many of the film's events are true and which were created or embellished for ""dramatic appeal."" With that said, I will try to keep my criticisms of Justin's character to a minimum.  Disney does it again, masterfully turning what could have been a decent story into a poorly done ""feel good"" family film. The most of obnoxious way this is done is through frequent journies into Justin's imagination. For example when his parents are debating whether or not to allow Justin to participate in summer league baseball the scene turns into a courtroom, his parents are opposing counsel, wearing judges wigs.  One notable exception to this is the scene in which Justin imagines that he actually gets a place on the team. The ball is hit and then is held in suspended animation, waiting for him to catch it. This is good for a laugh and is a clever way to demonstrate that baseball is perhaps not the best choice.  Next there is the use of the word ""cripple."" I realize that the word is only used twice, once by a clearly evil character and once by Justin himself. The last time it is said is what worries me. Justin says something to the effect of ""Just because I'm a cripple doesn't mean that I'm an idiot."" The word is not used in jest and it appears as if it is an acceptable term.  I use the term frequently but ALWAYS in jest. It is a bad term to use in a movie that is geared towards viewers as young as six, they might not be able to make the destinction.  The most insulting thing in the entire movie are the scenes in which Justin imagines that he is conversing with ""God"" A marshmellow roasting race car driver. The most insulting of these scences occurs when Justin asks if he will be ""perfect"" or cured in heaven. ""God"" unlocks a door to reveal a room full of people in angel-winged wheelchairs implying that they will forever have to live with being disabled. This is supposed to be a good thing? If this wasn't enough ""God"" wears a muscle shirt thar proclaims, ""I don't make mistakes."" Implying that he intends for some us to be disabled.  If this is true than I'm going to expect a lot of explaining from whomever intended my legs not to work,my spine to be tilted eighty degrees, my hips slip out of their sockets, and my brain uncapable to drain fluid on it's own. And to further intend for me to stay that way even after I leave this world. As you can probably tell I'm disabled myself, and I don't think this movie sends as good of message as it intends......",983664000,8,3518,4.451863354037267

7928994,5,B000050IMO,"This is a true story about a 12 year old boy who was born with a birth defect known as hydrocephalus (water on the brain).  He was handicapped and required to have a shunt to drain fluid off of his brain.  He was left physically challenged for the rest of his life.  The DVD movie, Miracle in Lane 2 is about this 12 year old boy named Justin Yoder.  Justin Yoder won the national championship in the famous Soap Box Derby, and introduced the hand-brake that is know as the Yoder hand-brake.  In the foibles of youth, Justin met a neighbor how lost his daughter in a swimming accident;
this same Father had his daughter racing in the Soap Box Derby.  The neighbor had compassion for Justin and agreed to help him learn to race
in the soap box derby competitions.  Then Justin's family became involved.  The young actor, Frankie Muniz was the superb selection for the role of Justin Yoder and had the precocious talent to re-enact how Justin learned perseverance can overcome barriers.  Frankie Muniz is gifted and worthy of a five-star rating!  This is an ideal family movie and I have discreetly used it for families who have exceptional challenges.  Disney has a super track record for movies with moral meanings anyone can learn from.",1467072000,2,1237,4.628440366972477
