4712381,5,B005J9ZFGG,"The Ayakashi from Kokuboro have decided to launch an all out attack on Karasumori. The failing health of their Princess has left them little time to act. Now, Yoshimori, Tokine, and Gen must fight for their lives against the most powerful Ayakashi in the world. The battle is fierce, and it seems that the Kekkaishi have no chance. They are spared from death by the sacrifice of a great hero.

This is another great volume. All of the events that took place in the previous episodes have led up to this volume. I had gotten used to a sort of light hearted vibe from this series. This set was not that way at all. I didn't expect so much emotion from this series. I think that this is the best volume yet. The characters really come to life and shine. This series keeps getting better. I'm looking forward to volume 4.",1358035200,2,817,4.410596026490066

4712387,4,B005J9ZFGG,"For over 400 years, it has been up to the clan of Kekkaishi, barrier masters, along with their supernatural dogs, to guard the region called Karasumori and exterminate powerful supernatural creatures, Ayakashi, that appear every night. Karasumori School just happens to be setting on that supernatural land.

Yoshimori Sumimura is an overconfident and determined 14- year old boy who attends Karasumori School. He's also the 22nd Kekkaishi of the Sumimura clan and is trained by his strict and short-tempered grandfather. Yoshimori is always competing against his older rival and crush, Tokine Yukimura. She is also a Kekkaishi, and a strict and hard-working one at that. She's known Yoshimori since childhood and even lives next door to him with her smug grandmother. Both Kekkaishi, especially their grandparents, are constantly arguing about who is the rightful heir as a barrier master.

Yoshimori's goal is to continue to work hard to become the best so he can protect the ones he cares about. But it won't be easy. The most extremely powerful Ayakashi are showing up on the Karasumori site with an evil goal in mind. Yoshimori and Tokine can't defeat them alone and have to get help from Yoshimori's older brother, Masamori, the Chief of the Night Troops. This group is an interesting bunch with unique, but burdensome powers of their own. But having the Night Troops around also causes some problems with the Kekkaishi. Will they ever learn to get along?

This is an entertaining and exciting anime. The show gets better with each episode. There are many likable characters in this interesting and creative story. There are great magical, action-packed fighting scenes, along with dramatic twists and turns and surprises as well as lots of comedy. It's a great show that will keep viewers watching. (52 episodes all together in the 4 DVD sets)",1389657600,,1850,5.078947368421052
4712388,5,B005J9ZFGG,"I loved this series! The voice talent was cast brilliantly, Vic Mignona does a great job as Yoshimori especially capturing his over the top reactions to things. I also enjoyed that this wasn't the typical anime with the power up of the week or ""now witness my true power"" type of battles. Main character is very much an underachieving simple minded person who has to deal with a huge responsibility. I can't give this series enough praise.",1388448000,,439,4.714285714285714
4712389,5,B005J9ZFGG,its came in good condition with no problem it is an excellent anime and it was amazing to watch and see,1379289600,,103,3.9523809523809526
4712390,5,B005J9ZFGG,This set shows character growth and budding friendships. You don't realize how important these episodes are until it is too late. A twist that really shocks you and leaves you wanting more.,1370217600,,189,4.9375
4712391,4,B005J9ZFGG,"Great series and I wish their will be more.
Our nation is cutting back on anime and you better get them while their still there.",1369612800,,128,4.16
8475539,4,B005J9ZFGG,"The Kekkaishi are spiritual warriors, kind of like Buddhist monk fighters.  They use special barriers, Kekkai, to trap and destroy ayakashi.  They are spiritual creatures from Japanese folklore.  These creatures aren't supposed to interact with the human world and cause damage, so the Kekkaishi vanquish them.

Its an interesting action show that starts with two completing/cooperating Kekkaishi families as young kids, skips some years, and then after a few episodes or so gets to mid-teens somewhere for the rest of the show.  The leads Yoshimori and Tokine butt heads sometimes but find unique ways to beat strong enemies as the hone their skills throughout the show.  Its a bit unique and worth the watch.

Theme Songs 3/5
The show has a solid well-fitting opening. The endings eventually cycle between a few.  They were okay.

Ending 3/5
NO spoilers, the end completed a big story arc.  It left things as basically as now lets keep on keepin on. It was fine.",1527552000,,964,4.96875
