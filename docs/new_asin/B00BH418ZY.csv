5621125,4,B00BH418ZY,"This western succeeds in many levels. The principal actors are good and one really cares of them. The story is better than average, even gives some surprises. This is a B-film in the sense that it may not have beenvery expensive to produce, but it has good colors and enough open space. Sometimes just about everything clicks and the result is a very good film.",1393113600,2,361,4.569230769230769

5621127,4,B00BH418ZY,"Good old classic western. Was not sure when the ad mentioned it would make a copy when ordered, but was well pleased with the quality of the picture. The only downfall, and it was minor, was that there were no subtitles available.",1374883200,4,230,4.5
5621128,5,B00BH418ZY,"I remember seeing THE GUN HAWK many years ago, and thinking then that it was much better than the then run-of-the-mill ""little A"" Westerns being produced, and that although it might drag a bit at times, it had a wallop of a conclusion. Thus, this nice release by WarnerArchive offered the opportunity to enjoy the film again. And seeing it once again, after fifty years, confirms what I thought when I first viewed it: it's a fine little oater that packs a punch at the end.

First, Allied Artists assembled a solid, experienced cast, headed by stars Rory Calhoun and Rod Cameron. Interestingly, by 1963 the ""little A"" type Westerns that so dominated the genre during the late 1940s and 1950s were on their way out. By one count, just ten identifiable Western films were actually released in 1963 (of course, TV Westerns continued to be big at the time.) A. C. Lyles over at Paramount would produce a dozen of them with dozens of familiar faces during the period 1964-1969, but by 1970, the colorful kind of sagebrush saga that made good money for Universal and Columbia (and Allied Artists) in the 1950s was nearly extinct. The large-scale, sprawling John Wayne films would continue, but Vietnam and the ""cultural revolution"" of the 1960s seemed to doom the ""little As."" For this film Allied Artists secured Cameron, whose best work had been completed ten years earlier, and Calhoun, again, whose best Western work was behind him; and together the two weathered stars shine again, play off each other nicely, and spark some occasional fireworks that keep the dramatic interest going.

Then, there are the other veteran players, familiar faces to Western fans---Lane Bradford, Robert Wilke, John Litel, and others even less well known, but all of whom know the genre like the back of their hands.

Although some writers may be tempted to see psychological tangents or underlying, darker elements in the relationship between Calhoun and Cameron, or between Calhoun and his young follower, Roan, such analysis goes beyond the real goals of the film. THE GUN HAWK needs to be viewed as its experienced director (Edward Ludwig) and producers intended. Still, the final shoot out does cause us to think about what Calhoun is trying to teach Roan, and just how stark the lesson learned will be.

We are surprised by the rude ending; we don't expect it. Yet, in a way it is a satisfying means for the older gunslinger Calhoun to end his life, with a certain dignity and appropriateness.

The quality of this print is excellent. Jimmie Haskell's musical score which at first is fine, becomes a bit cloying after repeated listening. The picture is full-frame. No bonus features. In short, highly recommended to fans of classic Westerns.",1363910400,9,2727,4.893939393939394
8568433,5,B00BH418ZY,"I've always been a big fan of Rory Calhoun. Many critics have panned him as a third rate actor. I've always believed that he had never been given meatier roles which would have showcased his talent and shown him to be the first-rate western film star that he really was. This film, however, gives him the opportunity to shine, particularly in the role of a dying man who is determined to meet his end the same way he lived his life. He is sadly missed.",1494806400,,452,4.329411764705882

8568441,1,B00BH418ZY,"Don't know what people like about this film. Far from a classic, it is full of wooden acting, heavy handed cliched dialogue, and unimaginative directing and cinematography. In a word - it's boring. I suppose there are many out there who love the western genre so much that any dull serving will satisfy their hunger. There are much better westerns out there so no need to waste ones time on this and make the same mistake I did. Avoid!",1428364800,,435,4.518987341772152
