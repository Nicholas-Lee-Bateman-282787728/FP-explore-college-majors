7887594,1,6305239436,"I ordered this production which stars Liz Taylor and her .... uhm ... Richard Burton. I was sent this high school play..
I couldn't get past the first act. It was worse than having to go watch by daughter play a tooth in 2nd grade. (Although my girl's play had better lighting and sound) and the diambic pentameter was relaxed and flowed.
Blah, blah,
Here's the rub:
I ordered the cd, recieved this video/phone recording, sent the seller a request to receive a return envelope/label and not yet has that arrived. I ordered my film (And l HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE). So... I had to eat this one but bought the dvd i payed for in first place because I really needed the film.
If anyone would care to use this production as an teaching aide. Send postage. I beg All within on my knees... Use this poo to instruct young aspiring thespians to critic/ask you're students what they're doing wrong.
It's the only use I have found it's use.
Bottom line* Just don't buy from these Nimrods. Not only will you not receive the merchandise you order, you won't have an option to return or trade with this. .. whatever they profess to be.
Again, if there's a acting/productions instructor that needs this ""WHAT NOT TO DO""..

7887595,1,6305239436,"There are several versions of ""Taming of the Shrew"" floating around out there.  Each with its strong points. Howard Keel's is the closest to the original. Richard Burton is the most flamboyant and fun. But this animal has no social redeeming value and lacks any memorable actors.

This film counts on camp to distract from the bad acting and pore timing.  It is worse than a high school play. Karen Austin  as Katherina is more sex than shrew. Everyone else is just duffus.
