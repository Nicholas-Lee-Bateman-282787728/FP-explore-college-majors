5886824,5,B00E3GII7Y,"First hand account of (Alaskan) glaciers calving. No Narration. Dramatic, appropriate background music! Nature IS dramatic and so is this video. If you've seen glaciers first hand, if you've visited Alaska, you know what it is like. You will be reminded of the Majesty of Glaciers, of nature ... of life's vulnerabilities. If you haven't had the privilege of a 'glacier cruise' this original video will accurately depict all of that ... just as it happens .. caught on rare video. I am not so sure I believe in Global Warming as global temps have risen a mere .5 degrees in the past 15 years ... but, nonetheless ... calving glaciers make elephants and whales seem like tiny insignificant entities on this world's vast landscape. Order it today! Once it arrives - grab your favorite snack/s and beverage/s - invite close friends to your home - enjoy Creation in its natural form on your HD big screen -  view this natural habitat - untouched by man. I did. I hope you do too. Blessings and epiphanies ....",1386374400,2,1005,4.677966101694915

8600589,1,B00E3GII7Y,"I am an adult graduate student in a sustainability management program.  I do not see what value this video adds.  If you do not show before and after images and explain the implications, the message in the video will be lost on many.",1519430400,,233,4.395348837209302
8600590,3,B00E3GII7Y,"Dramatic music while watching glaciers calving & corking.  Very repetitive.  Beautiful for an adult to watch, but not the best video to keep a students attention.  There is no story-line to go along with it, only what looks like similar video over and over.  I was hoping there would be a narrator teaching about global warming & climate change during the video, but there was not.  Only music.",1512000000,,394,4.735294117647059

8600592,5,B00E3GII7Y,Outstanding! I loved every second of it and the music genuinely tells a story with the footage. I'm planning on buying copies for friends at Christmas Time. Thanks for the fantastic DVD. I have watched it several times and it NEVER GETS OLD! Awesome.,1405987200,,250,4.704545454545454
8600593,5,B00E3GII7Y,Global Warming in Action delivers an accurate display of the effect global warming has on our environment - silently calling us to come together and make a difference. I urge anyone reading the reviews to take sometime and witness the dramatic changes taking place in our environment. Kelly & Fair have brought us yet another beautiful movie.,1387238400,2,342,5.017543859649122

8600595,5,B00E3GII7Y,"Beautifully done. I guess I had never really thought of the effects global warming was having on glaciers. I did a little research and, sad to say, it seems that our glaciers have really been ""endangered"" over the last century. Is it Mankind or Nature's Course?? Hard to say, but sometimes I believe we, as humans, tend to interfere with the natural course of events. I, myself, don't believe nature is one of those things that we should alter as humans. Things of nature are here to serve a purpose and when we go interrupting the natural course of events, you are bound to see repercussions.

It was an amazing video. In the midst of what was happening, I was in awe of the beauty of our world.",1386633600,2,696,4.4375
