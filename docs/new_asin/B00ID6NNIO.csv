8640997,5,B00ID6NNIO,"Ever wanted to see a film that will blow your mind???? Then this one is it! Made way back in 1952, but just as relevant today. Like an extended Twilight Zone episode, this film explores the idea that money grows on trees.... The ulimate wish fulfillment of a society that bases its wealth on the idea of paper money and the consequences of a materialistic world economy are explored in depth. A delightful fantasy set in the 1950s, but could make a pretty decent film today considering just how far our economy has deteriated and the sad state of a world that takes inflation for granted. The fact that our government prints billions of dollars with nothing to back it up, you might just come to the conclusion that OUR money grows on trees planted at the Treasury Department with the blessing of the Federal Reserve of course.",1445817600,2,827,4.594594594594595
