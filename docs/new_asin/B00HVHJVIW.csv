8636457,5,B00HVHJVIW,"This set is exactly what I've been wanting! All episodes with a commentary by Dino! I bought my multi-region/univeral Blu-ray player just for this collection. The first season is absolutely hilarious with its wackiness, but the next two seasons are MUCH darker. Humor still remains, but a few episodes have the drama of a feature film! Never have I seen an animated show with this much depth. Really and truly, Moral Orel is not to be missed! You have got to see this show; money well spent! I recommend watching the episodes straight through in the order they were released, but below is the recommended viewing order from the man himself, Dino Stamatopoulos:

1.) The Lord's Greatest Gift (S1, Ep2)
2.) God's Chef (S1, Ep10)
3.) Charity (S1, Ep4) **My personal favorite...pure comedy!**
4.) Waste (S1, Ep3)
5.) The Blessed Union (S1, Ep6)
6.) Omnipresence (S1, Ep5)
7.) God-Fearing (S1, Ep7)
8.) Loyalty (S1, Ep9)
9.) Maturity (S1, Ep8)
10.) The Best Christmas Ever (S1, Ep1)
11.) God's Image (S2, Ep1)
12.) Love (S2, Ep2)
13.) Satan (S2, Ep3)
14.) Elemental Orel (S2, Ep4)
15.) Offensiveness (S2, Ep5)
16.) God's Blunders (S2, Ep6)
17.) Pleasure (S2, Ep7)
18.) Lord's Prayer (S2, Ep8)
19.) Holy Visage (S2, Ep9)
20.) Be Fruitful and Multiply (S2, Ep10)
21.) Praying (S2, Ep11)
22.) Repression (S2, Ep12)

27.) Presents for God (S2, Ep17)
28.) Orel's Movie Premiere (S2, Ep18)
29.) Nature, Part 1 (S2, Ep19) **Where the depressing poo really starts to hit the fan!**
30.) Nature, Part 2 (S2, Ep20)
31.) Numb (S3, Ep1) **The title of this episode is exactly how you'll feel going into this final season.**
32.) Grounded (S3, Ep2)
33.) Innocence (S3, Ep3)
34.) Alone (S3, Ep4)
35.) Trigger (S3, Ep5)
36.) Dumb (S3, Ep6)

With the exception of the first season, everything else is in the ""correct"" order. Watch, enjoy, and watch again!",1463616000,3,2116,4.842541436464089
8636458,5,B00HVHJVIW,"An almost perfect collection for the Morel Orel Fan, it is missing the Special Episode Beforel Orel: Trust.  But all the other 43 Episodes are there with deleted scenes, making of's, and more.  Region 4 so it won't play on standard US DVD/Bluray players.",1457136000,4,254,4.75
8636459,5,B00HVHJVIW,"At last! I've been waiting 8 years for Seasons 2 & 3 to be released on DVD. All of Season 1's brilliance and humor remain, but Seasons 2 & 3 are MUCH darker in tone--in fact, some of this stuff is truly horrific. It's also much deeper than Season 1. I'd call the entire series a creative masterpiece.

If you've got a ""multi-region"" DVD player, this Australian-market (""Region 4"") version will play faultlessly on any regular TV. I'd grab a copy while you can, because it seems unlikely that it'll ever be released in a US-market  (""Region 1"") version.",1438214400,7,552,4.565656565656566
