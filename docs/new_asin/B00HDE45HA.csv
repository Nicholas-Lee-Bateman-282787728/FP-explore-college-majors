This is a 1965 black & white mono recording. The picture lacks crispness. The performances were excellent. Reri Grist was outstanding as Zerbinetta. Hildegard Hillebrecht was Ariadne. Karl Bhm conducted the Weiner Philharmoniker.

Scenery tended to be minimal and not reflective of the story. Manuela Uhl was Danae. Mark Delevan was Jupiter. Andrew Litton conducted the Deutsche Oper Berlin.

CAPRICCIO (2 disks): 4.2 stars, 2004
It is available here:
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strauss-Capriccio/dp/B000B6N6F4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strauss: Capriccio</a>
Capriccio's storyline involves a poet, composer and stage director who debate about the importance of words versus music. They ultimately create an opera together about the exact events that occurred to them that day, using themselves as the characters. Robert Carsen, the director of this production, takes another step by having the characters sitting in the opera house, watching their opera being performed. He also moves the opera from 1775 as Strauss intended to 1942.

Rene Fleming was the Countess. Ulf Schirmer conducted the Opra National de Paris.",1484697600,,4459,8.780219780219781
8631613,5,B00HDE45HA,"The best purchase available for obtaining Strauss' greatest operas complete on DVD. Recordings vary in age from the 70-ies to the early 2000s, but they all are from some of the best Strauss conductors and singers of their time. For me, DVD is the most useful form to present operas, while for more absolute music, I prefer CDs / non-visual presentation form. This issue also comes with a comprehensive historical description / material / pictures officially acknowledged by Strauss' family. And to me - Strauss is the most interesting opera composer!",1443398400,3,550,5.054945054945055
8631614,4,B00HDE45HA,"It is amazing to me that for a relatively low price one can purchase these lives performances, some of them of rarely-performed works, from major venues.  The accompanying booklet itself is almost worth the price of the set.  Yes, there are some Euro-trash, ""concept"" productions, but the musical values are sound throughout.",1441411200,2,325,5.230769230769231
8631615,4,B00HDE45HA,"Salome, Op. 54 (La Scala, 2007)
Elektra, Op. 58 (Vienna State Opera, 1989)
Der Rosenkavalier, Op. 59 (Bavarian State Opera, 1979)
Ariadne auf Naxos, Op. 60 (Salzburg Festival, 1965)
Die Frau ohne Schatten, Op. 65 (Bavarian State Opera, 1992)
Die Liebe der Danae, Op. 83 (Deutsche Oper, Berlin, 2011)
Capriccio, Op. 85 (Paris National Opera, 2004)

1. Salome, Op. 54 (La Scala, 2007) Harding/Bondy: I still haven't found a good live Salome on video (Stratas/Bohm version is excellent but lip-sync; my favorite on cd is Studer/Sinopoli version). Nadja Michael's Salome tends to be shrill in high register (almost screaming). My best would be the yet-to-be-released 2003 Paris production with Karita Mattila / James Conlon (not very enthusiastic about 2008 Met production with Mattila as Salome).

2. Elektra, Op. 58 (Vienna State Opera, 1989) Abbado/Kupfer: This is a classic production with excellent conducting, staging and singing, especially, of three female singers (Marton, Studer, Fassbander). Highly recommended along with Chereau's last production in Aix-en-Provence in 2013.

3. Der Rosenkavalier, Op. 59 (Bavarian State Opera, 1979) Kleiber/Schenk: Kleiber's later Vienna version is slightly better musically (better singing and orchestra) but this production has gorgeous, though traditional, staging by Schenk and is a feast for the eyes. Highly recommended along with 2004 Salzburg production with Bychkov/Carsen.

4. Ariadne auf Naxos, Op. 60 (Salzburg Festival, 1965) Bohm/Rennert: Like their 1966 Salzburg Figaro, this is a classic production and a rare chance to see Reri Grist's immaculate Zerbinetta. Highly recommended along with 2006 Zurich production with Dohnanyi/Guth.

5. Die Frau ohne Schatten, Op. 65 (Bavarian State Opera, 1992) Sawallisch/Ishikawa: This is visually the best FroSch (strangely, very well fit in with this Japanese production) and Sawallisch's understanding and grasp of the score is almost second to none. Some may prefer Solti/Fridrich version (which is not my cup of tea, by the way). My top choice is, however, 2011 Salzburg production with Thielemann/Loy (Though its horrible staging, Thielemann's conducting Wiener Philharmoniker is absolutely beautiful and the female singers are also wonderful).

6. Die Liebe der Danae, Op. 83 (Deutsche Oper, Berlin, 2011): I don't know much about the opera or the production, so I'll skip.

7. Capriccio, Op. 85 (Paris National Opera, 2004) Shirmer/Carsen: Carsen's staging is wonderful and so is Fleming's Countess and Shirmer's conducting. Clearly my top choice for this opera.

All in all, with 4 to 5 top or near-top choice productions, this box set would be great if the price is much lower than buying those 4 or 5 productions separately.",1435536000,7,2731,5.516746411483253
