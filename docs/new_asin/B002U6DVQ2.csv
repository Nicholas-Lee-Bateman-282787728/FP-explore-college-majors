3988320,5,B002U6DVQ2,"Made under extreme conditions Roberto Rosselini's ""War Trilogy"" is a fantastic look into how people deal with war on their own soil. As Americans who have never seen our homes ravaged by the wars of other nations, this is a must-see for anyone who'd like to examine the human condition under duress.",1271203200,4,299,4.769230769230769
3988321,5,B002U6DVQ2,"Two of these three Rossellini films made at the very end of WWll are considered classics: Rome, Open City, and Paisan. The third film, the disturbing Germany Year Zero has always been controversial and was a failure, though it is loved dearly by some.

The copies of the films are fantastic, especially Rome, Open City and Germany Year Zero, pristine, sharply focused black and white and Rossellini's great mastery of light, shadow and intensity and contrast of that palette is astoundingly captured. Paisan is a very good copy, though some shots are a little dim or faded looking. For those who know Rome and Paisan from VHS copies that circulated there is no comparison in any sense -- these are tremendously vivid, absolutely complete (the VHS copies I owned clipped small sections and had jumpy cuts), with superb sound tracks (that means tolerating Rossellini's brother's music which can be intrusive, especially in Paisan though one must assume auteur Rossellini wanted this since he was notoriously a complete control freak.)

Most people with any interest in film will know that Rome, Open City stunned Europe and was credited with creating a movement called 'neo-realism', though one of the late interviews with Rossellini included in the many invaluable extras shows him mocking the term. Whatever one calls it, much that happened in European film in the late forties and early 50's was influenced by both this film and Paisan -- Godard and Truffaut not to mention Fellini (who had his first serious film jobs assisting Rossellini on Rome and Paisan), De Sica and a host of others all traced their choices back to Rossellini's courage and vision.

Rossellini in that interview is a little defensive about Rome, Open City and the extras include the flamboyant stories of its making -- not all true (electricity was stolen -- true -- film stock had to be begged, borrowed or stolen and there was very little available, much of it of poor quality -- true; the film, contrary to standard claims, was not improvised at all, there was a completely written script shot precisely as written. Only a few of the prominent actors were amateurs, the great Anna Magnani was a well known film and stage actress and Aldo Fabrizi, the priest, was a big movie star though as a comic -- it was on his fame that Rossellini was able to raise his tiny budget). All the interiors were shot in a small film studio, not on location; the few exterior shots included serious risks though the one where Magnani chases after her finance who the Germans have seized and herded into a truck along with other men only to be shot as he screams at her to go back has to be one of the most memorable scenes in all of movie history even if her performance is a little operatic. Fabrizi is clearly more comfortable and  convincing in the mildly quirky or funny scenes (probably written by Fellini)than when he needs to be very serious or righteous in facing the Nazi villain (glycerine tears are clearly used for him in one scene). But the scenes of his execution are very moving and the final image of his pupils, they've sneaked out of the city to see him die, slowly roaming off back to Rome is another unforgettable image.

Paisan is a different matter. This was entirely improvised though Klaus Mann (son of Thomas) had written a detailed scenario and another American, Alfred Hayes, had written a script. Rossellini discarded both except for a sequence in Rome written by Hayes -- the weakest stretch of the movie. It is six episodes, all short stories, though only a few have a neat beginning, middle and end. All but one of the performers was an amateur, the Italians were found in the different locations. The best of these are the story in Naples where a black G.I. meets up with a street urchin who is not to be trusted. The ruins of Naples, the drunk G.I. stumbling into a traditional Neapolitan puppet show (I suspect a Fellini idea), the street life of the jammed but ruined city and the devastating final scene are amazing. The final story where a group of Partisans and GI's (all cast from life) are hemmed in and eventually slaughtered by a small group of ruthless Germans on the marshes of the Po is stunning from every angle and was a tremendous influence on post war avant-garde film making.

Germany Year Zero is so horrifying it's hard to get to grips with. A young boy in a devastated Berlin where the Germans are starving is the sole support of a dysfunctional family and eventually takes drastic action. The story seems forced to some but the way it is shot and Rossellini's evident identification with the desperate, terrified and confused child carries one through some obvious contrivances. This has several brilliantly managed exterior scenes of the boy wandering in despair through the bombed out city that are tough to sit through but worth it.

The features are amazing, consistently interesting, sophisticated, enormously informative even when commentators contradict one another. A film about how the movies were assembled is revelatory. A photo montage of Rossellini's until now mysterious affair with a German woman (while he was married and seeing other women, he left her for the impossible Magnani much to his eventual regret) is stunning and moving.

When the films were shown on French TV Rossellini recorded introductions (watch the movies first) and those are invaluable. But some issues about Rossellini are scanted -- his earlier work in the Fascist film industry, which eventually cost him much of his popularity in Italy when it was revealed, the details of his monstrously difficult personality are left a little vague (though the letters written to and read by his only Italian collaborator on Germany year Zero, which include references to his idiosyncratic interaction with the slightly crazy Marlene Dietrich certainly convey a lot).

There is also his use of homosexuality to demonstrate the most unthinkable of all evils (the swishy but vicious Gestapo officer, his looming lesbian sidekick in Rome, Open City -- as though the Nazis tolerated open or even suspected homosexuals, they imprisoned or killed those they caught and none could have made a career in the Gestapo of all organizations, the pedophiles in Germany year Zero -- more plausible, maybe, but handled with a heavy hand) -- that's disturbing (in one of the late interviews Rossellini seems to apologize for this but doesn't go into detail). So he wasn't perfect or simple...

But this is the sort of treatment all great films should get and I can't imagine being without it.",1269907200,45,6568,4.861483467381591

3988323,5,B002U6DVQ2,"Wow, a week after this has been released there's still no reviews. I'd like to think that's because this set is jammed with such great content--movies and extras--that even the early adopters are still absorbing it.

It seems that Criterion thought long and hard about release #500. And it shows. These are three extraordinary movies. They're all over 60 years old, but they still pack an emotional and cinematic wallop.

""Open City"" is the most familiar and revered title here. It has lost little of it's power or immediacy. Maybe the melodrama is a bit more obvious to our jaded 21st century sensibilities, but that doesn't mean you won't get caught up in the story.  Short, plump Aldo Fabrizi plays one of the least unlikely resistance heroes imaginable, and Anna Magnani is nothing short of iconic. This may not be the birth of Italian Neo-realism, but it's certainly a precocious infancy.

""Paisan,"" here in its first US DVD release, was Rossellini's follow-up to ""Open City."" It seems to beg the question, how imperfect can a movie be and still be great? The acting is uneven to say the least (arguably the amateurs are more convincing that the professionals), not all of the six short story-like episodes are equally compelling, and most of them end with an unsatisfying abruptness. But on some very basic level, these imperfections just don't matter. In one of the special features, Martin Scorcese makes a very telling distinction between ""realism"" and ""authenticity"" and this film never feels less than authentic, often chillingly so.

""Germany Year Zero"" is the most problematic of the films, if only because it's so heartbreaking, few people will want to sit through it more than once. It's nonetheless an amazng feat of sympathetic imagination, as Rossellini brings neo-realism to the ravaged streets of post-war Berlin. It's almost as if he's apologizing for depicting the Germans in ""Open City"" as so single-mindedly villianous.

I've blathered on and on yet I've barely scratched the surface. Virtually all the extra features are worthwhile, especially Adriano Apra's comments on each film. Picture quality, though imperfect, is far superior to the previous releases of ""Open City"" and ""Germany Year Zero."" Sadly, only ""Open City"" includes a commentary track, but more so than a lot of great movies, these films speak for themselves. An essential purchase for film buffs.",1265155200,70,2387,5.092071611253197

3988350,4,B002U6DVQ2,"This is a great set and I love ""Paisan"" and ""Germany Year Zero,"" but knowing what I know today, I see ""Rome Open City"" as both historically and emotionally dishonest and, in the case of Rossellini himself, who was making Fascist propaganda films only a few years before, quite hypocritical. His pre-1945 Fascist films are, of course, completely ignored by his post-war-brainwashed supporters today

The official amazon reviewer or should we say useful-idiot Marxist propagandist wrote about ""Rome, Open City"": ""a harrowing drama about the Nazi occupation of Rome and the brave few who struggled against it."" How so? Fascist Italy and National Socialist Germany were on the same side. Contrary to what is said today Mussolini was MASSIVELY popular with Italians in his era and so was Hitler with the Germans and the Austrians. The Austrians even freely voted by a 99% majority in 1938 to re-unify with Germany because Germany, at that time, was the economic miracle of the entire world, inventing, in a period of only 6 pre-war years the first operational Jet aircraft and Jet engine, the first programmable computer, the first binary calculator, the helicopter, night-vision, 35mm 3-D film, Rockets, Guided Missiles, etc. (over 300,000 patents and copyrights were stolen by Stalin's allies from defeated Germany without compensation). While America and the rest of Europe were in bankster and usury created long-term depression, the Germans were prospering beyond their wildest dreams.

The Italians were also doing far better economically than ever before under Fascism. So who would be these ""brave few"" and why would they be ""brave""? Only communists and pro-Stalin's-allies Marxists that's who, and certainly NOT pro ""freedom"" people since the pre-war Italians and Germans IN NO WAY considered themselves ""unfree"" under Fascism and National Socialism.

They would only be ""brave"" if Fascism is automatically considered to be a worse and more oppressive system than Bolshevik Stalinist Communism, which you realize is absolute nonsense, as soon as you study the REAL HISTORY of the period from properly authenticated original source documents only, as opposed to the falsified history written by the winners and their black propagandists at the end of the war. The USA and Britain ALLIED with, FOUGHT ON THE SAME SIDE with, and, later, after the war was won, bequeathed NEARLY HALF OF EUROPE TO STALINIST COMMUNISM. Nearly half of europe went directly under communist misery, exactly as Mussolini and Hitler had predicted. The rest of the area in Western Europe or west of the Berlin Wall went under control of the same banksters who had funded communism (Trotsky aka Lev Bronstein through Rothschild agent Jacob Schiff of Kuhn Loeb with 20 million dollars printed out of thin air through the legalized counterfeiting and usury racket installed by the Federal Reserve act of 1913, which is still in place today), but they stayed in the predatory mercantile capitalist (not ""free market"" in any way whatsoever) ""democratic"" (dictatorship of the majority or lowest common denominator and a system of collectivism controlled at all times by the elite class from behind the scenes, but with some private property allowed, as long as taxes and usurious interest are always paid to the rulers) Western block. So, the ONLY way you could possibly consider the events depicted in ""Rome Open City"" to be ""heroic"" and ""brave"" is if you are convinced yourself that communists were ""freedom fighters,"" rather than enemies of all of Europe, the very principle of private property and freedom of thought, expression and choice, and therefore all of Western Civilization, which is what they were then and still are today under different names and disguises. Rossellini himself was busy before 1944 making Fascist propaganda films (his first three films are Fascist propaganda) which are virtually unknown for the usual reasons. Since Fascism and National Socialism were both anti-usury, anti-fractional-reserve-central-banking-legalized-counterfeiting, anti-communist, anti-freemasonry, anti-Jew (Mussolini only later became anti-Jew when Hitler showed him that usury against non-Jews was encouraged in both the Talmud and Torah as a way of conquest), anti-Jesuit, etc., the post-war black-propaganda by the winners (the REAL winners, not the nominal fronts or ""countries"": Rothschild-kabal banksters, communists, and freemasons) has to emphasize leftist sympathies and ignore any right-wing ones, regardless of any considerations of historical ""truth.""  Rossellini saw where his bread was buttered and as an opportunist, joined the post-war propagandists with ""Rome Open City."" Luckily he redeemed himself with Paisa and especially ""Germany Year Zero."" By the way, for fans of ""Germany Year Zero,"" if you want to find out what REALLY happened in post-war Germany, as opposed to the lies you've been fed your whole lives, and I'll warn you right now, you will be shocked beyond your worst imaginings, watch the documentary ""Hellstorm"" on you tube.

""Under Hitler, most of them had prospered beyond their wildest dreams; they had steady employment, tax deductions for multiple children, free health care, and many other formerly unheard-of benefits. They were convinced that a political party that had made good on its promise to wipe out unemployment, the scourge of the working class, deserved their support. """"- ~ excerpt from ""Destined to Witness, Growing Up Black in Notsee Germany"" (page 105) by Hans Massaquoi

""The fact that all of my classmates had become card-carrying members of the Hitlerjugend had in no way affected our relationship. Those who were close to me before they joined the Jungvolk remained so afterward. We continued to play and have fun together and visit each other's homes as if nothing had changed."" ~ excerpt from ""Destined to Witness, Growing Up Black in Notsee Germany"" by Hans Massaquoi

""For my direct, methodical and consistent course of policy the hate of the Masonic sect persecutes me even now. Masonry of that type has been beaten in Italy, but it operates and conspires behind mask of the international anti-Fascism. It utterly fails to defeat me. It tries to throw mud at me, but the insult does not reach its mark. It machinates plots and crimes, but the hired assassins do not control my destiny. It goes gossiping about my weaknesses, and the supposed organic afflictions of my body, but I am more alive and stronger than ever."" -- Benito Mussolini, My Autobiography (free online, google the pdf)

""I don't believe that anyone venerates Mussolini more than I... I know many exalted personages, and my artist's mind does not shrink from political and social issues. Well, after having seen so many events and so many more or less representative men, I have an overpowering urge to render homage to your Duce. He is the saviour of Italy and  let us hope  Europe"". Later, after a private audience with Mussolini, he added, ""Unless my ears deceive me, the voice of Rome is the voice of Il Duce. I told him that I felt like a fascist myself... In spite of being extremely busy, Mussolini did me the great honour of conversing with me for three-quarters of an hour. We talked about music, art and politics"". --- Igor Stravinsky

""To be a boy or girl at that time was wonderful. In the Hitler Youth the differences between Christian denominations or the different German states didn't count. We all truly felt that we were members of one body of people  one nation. Youth hostels were opened all over the Reich, enabling us to hike from one beautiful town to another seeing our fatherland. Every effort was made to strengthen our minds and bodies. Contrary to what is said today, we were encouraged to become free in spirit, and not to succumb to peer (or authority) pressure. In peacetime, no military training was allowed by the Hitler Youth leadership; scouting yes. Incidentally, to 'snitch on our parents' was frowned upon. The German press during the Third Reich had fewer taboos than the American press today. The only taboo I can think of evolved around Hitler, and, during the war, there was a law that prohibited defeatism. This was because of the negative role the German press played in the German defeat of 1918. I don't believe Ill ever see again a people as happy and content as were the great majority of Germans under Hitler, especially in peacetime."" -- Hans Schmidt, ""Living in Hitler's Germany""

Never were we as free as under the German occupation. -- Jean-Paul Sartre

""Freud did not understand the Germanic psyche any more than did his Germanic followers. Has the formidable phenomenon of National Socialism, on which the whole world gazes with astonishment, taught them better? Where was that unparalleled tension and energy while as yet no National Socialism existed? Deep in the Germanic psyche, in a pit that is anything but a garbage-bin of unrealizable infantile wishes and unresolved family resentments."" ~ Carl Jung - The State of Psychotherapy Today ( 1934)",1431129600,,9012,5.1594798083504445

It follows a few of Italians, some are actively fighting against the Germans, some are just trying to get by, while others are helping the Germans. The ties and conflicts between the Italian Christians, the Italian Communists and the Italian Fascists are dramatized in the film. Children also play a large part in the overall plot. Drug addition and homosexuality are also shown during the film.
The extras include an audio commentary with the movie which helps explain some of the things which the Italians would have picked up on in the forties which Americas might, and probably would, miss. The disc also includes other interesting documentaries and interviews.

""Paisan"" is actually six short films strung together one after the other following the American's advance northward up the peninsula of Italy driving the Germans out.  It follows not only the progression of the Americans northward, but also the progression of the relationship between the Americans and the Italians. It also shows the destruction to Italy by both the Germans and the Americans. Each short film, while remaining part of the overall advance of the Americans, has its own characters and its own plot.
This disc does not have a commentary with the movie but does have some interesting extras which shed some additional light on the movie.

The third disc in the set shows Germany during the first year after the war. Due to several circumstances the 12-year-old boy of the primary family in the movie has become, if not the major bread winner of the family, at least a major contributor. The movie shows several aspects of life in Germany during this time period. Food and other shortages, housing difficulties, and the black-market. Some remaining pro-nazi supporters are also shown, with a strong hint of them being pedophiles.

3988383,5,B002U6DVQ2,"The Criterion Collection's recent release of ""Roberto Rossellini's War Trilogy (Rome Open City / Paisan / Germany Year Zero), presents us with clean, remastered copies of these three memorable films. In them, we can see Rossellini invent Italian neo-realism on the screen; he had to, as, at the time he was working, Italy and Germany were nearly destroyed by World War II bombing, there was very little infrastructure left, and it was hard to get  film, filmmaking equipment - and everything else.  Thus, the director worked with natural light and sound.  The trilogy  also presents many informative extras: interviews with Rossellini's actress daughter Isabella; interviews with many of the films' actors, and film scholars, and Once Upon a Time . . . Rome Open City, a 2006 documentary on the making of Rossellini's most influential, important film.

""Rome Open City,"" (1945). This black and white, 100 minute long, unsettling war drama packs a lot into its brief running time. It is set in Rome, 1944, the waning days of World War II. The Germans are on the run, but still occupy the war-battered city that has been declared ""Open"" by parties to the war. It's anybody's for the taking. Its residents, largely old men, women and children endure a harrowing struggle with curfews, food shortages, joblessness, poverty, hunger and allied bombing raids. Meanwhile, they are trying to shield resistance forces from their de facto Nazi occupiers, and to maintain their self-respect. Rossellini's astonishing landmark film, which made its sensational debut at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Oscar for best screenplay, shows the Italian people's heartsick, weary despair and collective resolve to survive.

Giorgio Manfredi, AKA Luigi Ferraris, a Communist and an engineer, who's one of the Italian resistance leaders, is tracked down by the Nazis. He flees to his friend Francesco's place, where Francesco's pregnant fianc&eacute;e Pina, unforgettably played by Ann Magnani (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secret-of-Santa-Vittoria/dp/B0014BJ1D6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secret of Santa Vittoria</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rose-Tattoo/dp/B005DNPK7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rose Tattoo</a>), finds him, and carries a message for him to the local priest, Don Pietro Pellegrini, who's to marry the lovers in a day or two. But the Nazis are hard on Manfredi's heels.

Rossellini (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/STROMBOLI/dp/7885881512/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">STROMBOLI </a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Europa-51/dp/B001IKVWZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Europa '51</a>), actually co-wrote the screenplay - with possibly the greatest Italian star director of them all, Federico Fellini (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/8-1-2/dp/B000RFPORM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">8 1/2</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Dolce-Vita/dp/B004FPJ87W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Dolce Vita</a>), while the Germans still occupied Rome. He also started filming it while the Germans were still there. He had no film, and so had to piece together little bits and pieces he'd begged from the city's photographers. He was determined to have the film ready to release as soon as the Germans left Rome/were defeated in Italy. Therefore, he built no sets, and, for the first time in Italian cinema, filmed his story entirely on the actual streets and in the actual buildings of Rome. (He thereby established the Italian cinema protocol of realism, or neo-realism, as they preferred to call it, which held sway in Italian film for several decades.) He also didn't take much time - how could he--in composing the composition, the lighting - he used natural light--or the shadows of his film. He used actual German prisoners of war to portray his film's Germans - no Roman would have played a German at that time.  As the dialog is entirely in Italian, this film has English subtitles, thank goodness.

There is a scalding scene of the pregnant Pina's murder by the Germans, as she is dressed for her wedding, in her best, but still laddered stockings. She is killed in front of her son, an altar boy in a blinding white cassock, made even brighter by the Italian sun. Upon release of the picture, which was an enormous hit, Magnani was widely anointed ""the Mother of Rome.""

Ironically enough, Rossellini, Fellini, and Michelangelo Antonioni,(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-Avventura/dp/B002RA767Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L'Avventura</a>, [[ASIN:B0007989Y8 L'Eclisse (The Criterion Collection)] ) another great and famous Italian director, all got their starts making propaganda films, depicting a happy Italy, under the aegis of Vittorio Mussolini, son of the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. These were called white telephone films, as they depicted pretty young women lounging next to their white telephones, waiting for their lovers to call. There's another pretty young woman lounging near her white telephone in ROME OPEN CITY, waiting for her lover's call; Marina Mari, Manfredi's mistress, and the relationship does not ultimately serve him well.

PAISAN, (1946) a 120-minute black and white war drama continues the director's depiction of Italy at the end of the war.  In six vignettes, it follows the allied invasion of the country, from south to north from July 1943 to winter 1944.  It begins in Sicily, where a young girl who is helping the American soldiers is killed.  Thence to Naples, where an orphaned  local boy steals the shoes from a sleeping-it-off black American MP, who tracks him to a shantytown. To Rome, where an American GI meets a lovely young  woman the day the Americans liberate Rome: six months later they meet again; he is cynical, she is a prostitute.  In Florence, an American nurse braves a dangerous trip across the Arno in a doomed search for the partisan leader she loves.  In Monte Cassino, for which the allied and axis forces battled the longest, from January to May 1944, the arrival of three U.S. Army chaplains, including a Protestant and a Jew, upsets a local monastery.  Finally, in the northern marshes of the Po River, which waters both Milan and Venice, we find Allied soldiers and partisans seamlessly working together.  This is an ambitious, very moving film, now available here for the first time in its full original release version.  But one caveat: while we get subtitles for the Italians, we get none for the Americans.  And natural, outdoors sound, nonprofessional actors make their dialog very difficult to follow.  However, it is possible to follow the action in outline.

GERMANY YEAR ZERO, (1948), (78 minutes), gives us a horrifying snapshot of civilian life in war-ravaged Berlin shortly after the war.  The concluding chapter of the war trilogy is devastatingly intense and effective, a portrait of an obliterated Berlin shown through the eyes of Edmund Kohler, a twelve-year-old boy whom Rossellini told interviewers strongly resembled his own son, who had been dead for a year at the time of filming.  Edmund lives in a bombed-out apartment building, where ten families have been jammed into one apartment, with a  bedridden father and two older siblings.  His older brother Karl-Heinz had been in the German Army and fought up to the end, the corner of the block on which they live, so is afraid of reprisals for this, and accordingly has never registered with the postwar authorities.  Therefore, the family of four has only three ration cards.  Edmund's pretty older sister Eva gets dressed up to go out every night drinking and dancing.  But she does not pursue these evenings to what a viewer would expect to be their obvious conclusion, and therefore comes home every night with only a few cigarettes, rather than cash money, to show for her time. This leaves handsome young Edmund as the sole breadwinner for his family.  He is mostly left to wander unsupervised, seeking to bring back money and/or food to these hungry people.  Edmund  gets involved in the black-market schemes of a group of teenagers.  He also comes under the malign influence of a Nazi-sympathizing former teacher of his, whose ideas sway him in anti-social ways.  Rossellini seems to be telling us that the boy's former teacher is probably homosexual, and therefore immoral. By the way, as this movie is in German, it is fully subtitled, thank goodness.

If you are interested in history, World War II, or Italy and/or Germany, you probably should see these films, though they certainly can be downers.  No contemporary audience can quite imagine how powerful these films were in their time, but, believe me, they are still tremendously powerful, and will certainly live a good long time because of their overwhelming performances and documentary value.

3988384,3,B002U6DVQ2,"I have mixed feelings about the film Paisa. Although I liked that the film told the stories of several different people, the fact that the film only gave you one glimpse at their life kind of left you hanging. In general, the segments were good and I liked most of the characters. However, there were a few times that I got bored with the story. I especially did not care for the scenes at the monastery and with the soldiers in the marshes. I feel like at times the film had a captivating story but there were also times that the story dragged on. What I did really like about the film was the fact that it was shot on location. That gave the film a sense of reality that Hollywood films don't get. I also liked that the actors, such as the little kids, were most likely locals. One of my favorite parts of the film is when the soldier is interacting with the little boy. Another part of the film that I really liked was the scenes with the G.I. and the woman. It was heartbreaking to see that they had both changed so much that they did not recognize each other. I think one of the most important thing this film has going for it is its sense of authenticity. From the location to the actors to the story, the film was very true to life. Finding that quality in a film is highly valued and something that should be praised. One thing that left me slightly dissatisfied about the film was it's lack of connection between the stories. I don't necessarily think that the stories have to be connected, but the fact that they were not related caught my attention and made me wonder if they should have been.",1305072000,4,1604,4.297029702970297
3988385,4,B002U6DVQ2,"If there's one thing movies need, it's actors who can play the roles. Directors need people who are trained to perform their characters as best as the director visions them. Good actors get recognized and continue performing as well as they can. Yet, in the 1940s, Italian directors pioneered a certain form of filmmaking called ""neorealism"". This involved filming on location as opposed to a set and even had actual Italians performing the roles. Many of these had little to no experience acting, but the directors believed that their stories would be better told using actual Italians. Think of it as ""for Italians, by Italians, starring Italians."" One of the movies to incorporate this idea was Roberto Rossellini's post-WW II movie Paisan.

A large number of people would think that something like putting actual Italians to tell this movie would be a pretty interesting idea, and it actually is. Rossellini took something that hadn't really been done before at the time. Many of his movies are pretty famous because of it, and the idea itself has been pretty influential. Paisan really is no exception. Instead of using Italian actors, Rossellini used actual Italians in different roles combined with American actors. It's a pretty ingenious idea in terms of filmmaking. Unfortunately, the movie feels a little dry. It's probably the realism of the movie or the stories that come across in the film.

I say stories because the movie itself is actually a series of five vignettes as opposed to one full story. All of these have to deal with American soldiers in Italy after World War II. The first story deals with Americans in an Italian city who take one girl from the town to a seaside cliff. One of the soldiers tries to communicate with her but finds it hard because he doesn't know Italian. The second story is about a black American soldier who befriends a homeless boy that stole his boots. The third story has an American sleeping with an Italian prostitute musing about an Italian girl he used to love and tried to find again. He has no idea that the prostitute is the very girl. The fourth story has an American nurse meeting a painter who is a revolutionary leader named ""Lupo"". They struggle to get across the Ponte Vecchio and to safety. The last story is about American soldiers who are captured by the Nazis and executed before the war was over.

The interesting thing about this movie is that because these are actual Italian people portraying Italian people, it appeared as if they were Italian people. The little boy wasn't trying too hard to play a poor Italian boy because...well, he IS one. However, it's easy to tell that there is no experience with these people. The prostitute could have been done by an Italian actress, one who didn't really say her lines really monotonously. She realized who the guy she had was; she could be a little more shocked. The American actors were fine. Many of them felt like they actually were their characters as opposed to just acting them out. This makes it more interesting and even improves their acting. It's one thing to communicate with someone you know is faking it as well; it's another to communicate with someone who probably isn't. You have to be convincing enough to them, and that makes you convincing enough for the audience.

The ideas of communication and friendship are very heavy in this movie. The Italians are speaking Italian, but many of the Americans don't understand and find it hard to connect with these people. Rossellini tries to emphasize that in the first story. The Americans in the other stories knew some Italian, but it was the ignorance of the other Italian characters that cost them. The soldier with the boy didn't realize that the boy was homeless from the war and became mad at the boy when he stole his boots. The soldier with the prostitute didn't trust her judgment, and the story doesn't end too well for the both of them. The same can be said about the fourth story. Connecting with the people around you is important in these stories, and it becomes even easier if you understand them.

Unfortunately, this movie is a bit dry for me. When you try to make a story as real as humanly possible, you wind up making it so real that it feels like you're there. That works on numerous occasions such as mystery thrillers or suspenseful films, but these stories do come across as boring at times. The pacing of the movie has some part to play as the stories seem to go on and on. By the time something exciting or really dramatic happens, the scene is over. That may have been Rossellini's intent, but it doesn't help when there's nothing to keep us wanting to see these stories continue.

Bottom line: Paisan is a potentially good showcase because it uses potentially interesting concepts. The realism in the acting and the set really make the movie convincing. The ideas about communication and connection really do come across in the stories, but the stories don't pace well and have very little dramatic worth. The filmmaking ideas are influential and have good intents, but it helps when the story itself is interesting. Not everyone is an aspiring filmmaker, but those who are can learn a lot from this movie.",1304985600,4,5214,4.749448123620309
3988386,3,B002U6DVQ2,"These are problematical films from a problematical director. Rossellini's early career and life were tied up with Italian fascism. He was a close friend of Mussolini's son. He started his career doing films on the Italian military under fascism. Two of the films in this set attempt to rehabilitate Italy and Italians in the second world war. The third concerns Germany in the postwar period.

In the world of Rome: Open City and Paisan, Italy was a country full of anti-german resistance fighters who were the best buddies of every allied soldier. All the ambiguities of the war in Italy are glossed over. Nobody seems to have ever supported fascism. Italy and Italians are victims with no real sense of responsibility. Rome: Open City is visually interesting as a historical document but uninteresting as a story. Paisan is a collection of short stories about Italy in the war with amateur actors. If there is a theme, its the confused interactions between good Italians and the allied soldiers in Italy.

The final film, Germany Year Zero, is a incredible photographic work covering conditions in Germany after the war. The ruins and the devistation of the city visually speak volumes by themselves making the story - such as it is - almost irrelivant. The story has some good elements of realism to it covering conditions in Germany after the war. But it falls apart because the good elements degenerate about halfway through into a sadistic melodrama centered on a child character. Its all really over the top and unnecessary. It could have been so much better if Rossellini had actually stuck to the bitter realism which is bad enough. The stories of the sister and the older brother had more
potential than was used.

So in summary, these films are often incredible visual documents about the war but the stories presented are lacking in almost every respect. As usual, Criterion has delivered a high-quality transfer and an all-around good product.",1274054400,13,1956,4.9573170731707314

My only problem is with Criterion's treatment of the subtitles. Criterion is well-known for its meticulous treatment of classic movies, for its perfection in Blu-ray transfers, video and audio quality, bonus materials, beautifully printed booklets with such fantastic information for the cinema enthusiasts and yet they can make such A BIG MISTAKE WITH THE SUBTITLES: There are no subtitles for the English spoken parts! What an idiotic error this is! Its almost like someone decided to have subtitles for the Italian spoken part because Italian is a foreign language and necessary, but they thought it wasn't necessary to have subtitles for the English spoken parts. Does Criterion not have movies that are entirely in English? Yes, many. And don't those movies have subtitles for all of the English spoken parts? Yes, they do. So whats the idea of not having English subtitles in a movie that is half-Italian and half-English?

The purpose of the subtitle is that people who are hard of hearing or who, like me, are hard of understanding the spoken language because it is their second language, can read the spoken language. Now, how is that purppose negated by the fact that the movie has Italian spoken language? It still has tons of English spoken parts that are essential to the plot. This is not the only movie where Criterion made this mistake. La Dolce Vita suffers from the same mistake, although the English spoken parts in La Dolce Vita are not that many.",1517356800,,1733,4.993079584775087
