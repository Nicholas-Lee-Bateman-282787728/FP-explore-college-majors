8076036,2,B000A81BSM,I really didn't learn a whole lot from this video. It only had the most basic of pole dancing moves.,1368403200,,100,4.05
8076037,1,B000A81BSM,"I bought this dvd then immediately sold it on eBay the next day.  It teaches a very small number of moves, which was very disappointing.  Not to mention it spends more time showing someone who does not know how to do the moves correctly rather than the instructor.  Even if you have never tried pole dancing before, this video is really only good for one viewing.  I recommend getting something like PoleKatz that will at least continue to provide new moves for you to learn as you progress.",1162771200,,491,4.545454545454546
8076038,5,B000A81BSM,I love this DVD.  It is the best place to start when you want to get into swinging on the pole.  The instructor is VERY knoweledgable and is an excellent teacher.  Much better than S Factor and Carmen Electra's DVDs.,1134432000,3,216,4.35
8076039,1,B000A81BSM,"I am so sorry I purchased this DVD.  It's less then 30 minutes long and 7 minutes of that is an introduction and warm up excercises. I learned 3 moves from this DVD, which only shows you about 8 moves! I am a plus sized woman and I can figure out how to walk around the walk by myself (walk around the pole is one of the  moves that they teach!?!) It is not worth the money.",1133481600,8,374,3.844155844155844
