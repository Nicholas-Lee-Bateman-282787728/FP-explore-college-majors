Dex the prince of edonoi looks like a small mouth bass yet is portrayed as cute. the pet furbus is something that needs animal controll to come along and put to sleep. I would say this show is good for the mistie crowd that enjoys makeing fun of bad things, or it could make a good drinking game. Just take three shots when furbus calls for dex.",1314489600,,464,4.1098901098901095
7859800,1,630402181X,"I remember the show when it first came on. It was Saban's third venture into the Sentai world (after Power Rangers and VR Troopers.)  I never really seen much of the show and always wondered what happened to it.  Now I know why.

The series starts off simple enough.  Dex, the hero of the series must travel to earth to save it from Count Draggo.  Once there, he is adopted by a kind-hearted family.  Anytime when trouble arises, Dex calls upon his powers to turn into Masked Rider.  Mind you, the show wasn't of the best quality.  The lines delivered by the actors were, most often then not, hokey.  The storylines and pacing seem less than first rate.  But what can you expect from a series geared toward children?  However, there is one glaring reason for the show's demise and it was in the form of that annoying furball: Furbus.

In the scene near the beginning, when Dex and his troop where spying on the bad guys, Furbus draws attention to him by yelling Dex's name.  It was clear that Furbus was designed to be the comic relief, but in all, he was just freakin' annoying!  That role should have been left to the family's next door teenage girl whom's name I am to lazy to recall.  But, back to Furbus, it was not so much as what Furbus was, but what he represented.

The Sentai shows were getting a lot of complaints for being ""too violent"", so what Saban tried to do was to gear the series to more of a comedy than an action.  Bad move!  What they ended up was a series which was very much unwatchable.  The action that usually offsets the bad acting wasn't even there.  It was so bad that, reportedly, the original Japanese creator refused to lend anymore clips to the show, thereby canceling it.  He was that mad!

The only redeeming factor was that cutey Rheannon Glover.  Hey, Rhea, CALL ME!!!",1126310400,,1806,4.422492401215806
