A strangely optimistic clutch of abstracted musings on the nature of artistic creation from Monsieur Godard, who this time out seems energized by French new wave pop music, Dostoyevskys The Idiot, and classic slapstick comedy. Abstruse even by his standards, the film vaguely delineates a story about a childlike-moron filmmaker Prince (played by JLG himself, naturally) needing to make and deliver a movie in less than a day, and mixes this story with chopped up footage from actual Rita Mitsouko recording sessions and recurring surreal sketches about a failed ex-revolutionary who might also be the films narrator. Truly, its a puzzler that relies heavily on the faith that at least HE knows whats going on, but despite the intimidatingly gnomic story and theme, its not quite as dense with literary/visual citations as his other work of this period, and he seems to want to entertain. Whether or not we get the his points about the relationship between nothingness and creation, or more specifically, between silence/darkness/sleep and whispering/light/art, Godard keeps things moving along and provides some rather amusing surreal Weekend-ish moments that mock, among other things, airplane food, pedantic golfers, dramatic young lovers, and post-revolutionaries driving BMWs. If one could piece together the epic poem that accounts for the films voice-over, it probably would make more sense  indeed, the final sequence js quite moving, wherein the Man (putatively Fred Chichin from Rita Mitsouko) returns from despairing silence to once more hear the whispers of eternal creativity, and as such, it provides an uncharacteristic sense of emotional closure to what came before. Until, of course, the credit sequence, wherein disreputable film distributors start a riot in a coffee shop, reminding us once again of arts ultimate destiny in a society predicated on material gain. Leave it to Monsieur Godard to fashion a lyrical tribute to the creative process, take a dump all over it, and still leave us smiling.",1483574400,,2157,5.341176470588235
8583717,5,B00CN70M60,"It's easy to be bothered or bewildered by the characters in a Godard film. An affectionate woman is hushed by the rude man she loves, for he is playing golf beside a dreamer looking to break free of chance and fate. A bilingual American complains over the size of her pie on a chaotic plane ride. A gentleman, maybe hallucinating, is either dancing with a Finnish girl who also might or might not be Danish, and one of those two races have girls with pearl-white eyes, and she might be stripping without actually disrobing, or he might just be dancing by himself in a room where a door keeps opening on its own, evoking the western contemplation of life being one room, and the door being what lies beyond...

  KEEP YOUR RIGHT UP succeeds at offering wildly unusual moments that still look embarrassingly familiar or happily plausible. At times the movie's soundtrack (or the musicians within the movie) would become louder than the character dialogue or voice-overs, a tactic used in many earlier Godard films, memorably in WEEKEND. Could Godard be using language as a soundtrack to music in such scenes? The topic of music itself is discussed during many passages in KEEP YOUR RIGHT UP, even in reference to death and impending light, or the idea of a penultimate stage before the final deepening silence to come. Such editing seems at first to be an error in audio engineering, yet such fluctuating audio, as well as the distorted reel transitions, were hailed as characteristics of the ""new wave cinema.""

  The recurring scene of a door opening by itself accompanied by philosophical speeches is one of immense beauty. ""SUR LA TERRE"" (meaning 'On Earth') is displayed in captions frequently, yet one character questions if he is on the right planet. Viewers of any Godard film might repeat the same question, since the auteur's work takes patience to settle in, snuggly, before taking us 'beyond rebellion' & 'reconciliation.'

  I think what makes Jean-Luc Godard's movies seem so massively appealing to me is the absolute fact that his stories are just so different. Purely original. And I think that's fabulous, but also vital to all of us as a species. To put ourselves in such different comfort zones. The more we do it, the more we realize we're not actually bothered by such different things as we might have expected ourselves to be. And when we watch them enough, we find it all to be not as bewildering as the first viewing.

8583718,5,B00CN70M60,"Like so much of Godard, the photographic quality is wonderful and it has been so difficult to see good home video copies of his movies past ""Weekend"" (and even before). This blu-ray is a great improvement over the dingy Facets version and brings the imagery and the feelings behind it alive.",1374710400,7,291,4.7254901960784315
8583719,4,B00CN70M60,"4 stars for the film, I've got the Facets edition and the subtitles on that are difficult to read at times, I would gladly snatch this Olive Films edition up if I knew that that problem wouldn't be an issue. Judging by other Olive releases I have it probably won't have a subtitle option, but beggars can't be choosers I guess. Thanks Olive Films for releasing JLG, may there be more in the future, for example British Sounds, King Lear, and Wind from the East to name a few.",1374364800,4,475,4.348314606741573
