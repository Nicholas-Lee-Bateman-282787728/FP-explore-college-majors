1666095,5,B00005UPHN,She talks a lot so you learn about more that just the poses. She's very knowledgeable.,1263859200,4,86,4.4375
1666096,5,B00005UPHN,"Wonderful and soothing. You can actually feel the difference in your body after doing these workouts. Must have for beginners, those with stress problems, and athletes (after learning beginning techinques -if athlete-, would continue on to a higher level...)",1198022400,17,258,5.641025641025641
1666097,5,B00005UPHN,"I found this easy series just right for me as a beginner. I have had to do some for less time than shown and have over the last couple months strengthened incredibly. This is really the only exercise I do and my muscles are firm and movement is coming much easier for me. When finished I feel like I've had a full body workout. It is refreshing and energizing.
Wai Lana has a soothing voice that my husband calls monotone, but I find is slightly melodious and very easy to ignore when I'm doing something else, but easy to hear and calming to listen to when I do. She moves between poses rather quickly, but after a while I got used to this. If this is bothersome to you at first you can do the ""One Asana at a time"" or just do the poses in less time to give you time to rest more between poses. Wai Lana has beautiful outfits that change throughout each session and a variety of beautiful backgrounds. Her outfits are very modest and not form fitting (a plus for men who don't want distraction). She wears an elastic belt around her waist, which helps you see what she is doing with her waist. She is very descriptive of how to do the poses and what benefits you are getting. Because her voice is non-intrusive it isn't irritating that she talks most of the time. She says nothing extraneous that would distract you from the pose and over a long period of time of using the DVD hearing her say the same things each time doesn't get irritating.
On the main menu you have ""Start Workout"", ""Extras"", and Introduction (which is the same on each DVD). The ""Start Workout"" is the entire work out for that DVD. The workout itself consists of about 35 minutes of postures. After that is a time of music and meditation. Under ""Extras"" it lists ""One Asana at a time"", which does as it says; ""Customize your workout"", this lets you do the asanas (poses) in any order you wish with 17 asanas (on the beginner's I didn't count there others) and 20 slots for your choices, so you can do one more than once or some not at all as you don't have to fill all the slots; ""Guidelines"" this is a basic rundown of things to do and not to do to get the most out of it and prevent injury; ""Wai Lana's Little Yogi's"" (only on the Beginners DVD), this includes some snippets advertising her children's DVD; ""Using Yoga Props"" (only on the Toning DVD), which is a 12 minute segment with a model (not Wai Lana) with a man's voice explaining how to use the mat, block, and strap and also shows the Hero and the Shoulder Loosening poses modified; and ""More from Wai Lana"", which covers all the things she has to sell - her other DVDs and tapes, her music CDs, mats, etc. You can also see those things on her website: [...]
Each DVD comes with an illustrated book showing a picture of each asana, its English name, and what it physically benefits most. This is useful if you are going traveling and don't have a DVD player, doing the set outside, or if you want to do the set at your own pace.
There is also an option on the main screen of each that allows you to change from English to Spanish.
The Beginner's DVD includes these asanas: Blowing tree, Hummingbird, Folding Triangle, Wraparound Twist, Diving Pose, Krishna Pose, Churning Butter, Easy Arrow, Boomerang, Easy Wheel, Easy Spinal Twist, Easy Bow, Mini Sit-up, Head Roll, Cannonball, Yoga Nidra, and Meditation.
The Relaxation Workout includes: Three-Step Leg Lift, Rock & Roll, Sitting Eagle, Arm Circles, Shoulder Rolls, Shoulder Lifts, Reaching Backbend, Windmill, Tree Pose, Easy Camel, Alternate Leg Stretch, Biking Pose, Drawbridge, Side Leg Rise, Locust Lift, Sacrum Massage, and Meditation.
The Toning Workout includes: Energizing Breath, Neck Exercises, Tiptoe Squats, Flamingo, Dynamic Forward Bend, Triangle Stretch, Cobra Stretch, Grasshopper, Cat Stretch, Sunset Stretch, Leg Lifts, Lower Body Rock, Inclined Bridge, Leg Gyration, Samadhai Pose, and Meditation.
Side note: the asana Wai Lana is doing on the front of each DVD cover is not included on that DVD, so don't pick the DVD(s) you buy by the asana pictured on the front.
You can also buy each in this series separately, though buying the set may save you money.",1085097600,81,4164,4.575635876840696
1666098,5,B00005UPHN,"Wai Lana's style of yoga is very peaceful, relaxing, and great for cultivating energy. This first series is as it says ""easy"" but that's not the point. The point is it makes you feel great. She knows how to teach you to breathe and listen to your body to get the most out of the yoga positions.",1014076800,14,294,4.175438596491228

1666100,3,B00005UPHN,I found out yoga is not for me.,1437436800,,31,3.0
1666101,3,B00005UPHN,"I really enjoy watching the half hour Wai Lana yoga exercise programs.  I was terribly disappointed in that this series is just ""snippets"" of her exercises.  I would have appreciated this much more (especially considering the cost of the videos) if it had been complete half hour (or however long the shows are) shows, and not just bits of each exercise/pose.",1430438400,,359,4.868852459016393
1666102,3,B00005UPHN,"This is a good video for beginners.  However, if you are overweight, you might not be as happy with it.  Some of the poses are extremely difficult if you've got a belly or are sporting extra lbs.  Balancing on one foot for me was difficult so I used something to lean on for safety.  I will use this DVD when I lose a little more weight.",1427328000,9,337,4.0606060606060606
1666103,5,B00005UPHN,Love it!,1420329600,,8,3.5

1666106,5,B00005UPHN,"Perfect for what I need right now while I work my way back-up to a fit level- She is the absolute best Yoga Instructor-Music is soothing; Scenery is beautiful; Moves are Slow & Steady, Her Voice is soothing and warm; She holds the poses long enough to feel accomplished.  My back feels better already and I have just done 2x week so far.",1408579200,,337,4.349206349206349
1666107,4,B00005UPHN,"Great for beginners, intermediated, and older people who have never done yoga...slow pace, long instruction, very relaxing",1405900800,,122,6.235294117647059
1666108,5,B00005UPHN,"I have always been fairly fit and active, until a motorcycle accident changed my life. I was blessed to be alive, and was back to walking and things soon after, but with pain and an occasional limp. My knee hurt every day and worse on cold days. I know about fitness and yoga, I was a certified aerobics instructor for years, but the modern fitness options I had available in area gyms and studios, including yoga were either too fast, or too harsh. Wai Lana may look different with exaggerated makeup and her accent and colorful clothes and leis, but she gives clear concise directions, always gives modifications, and I can promise if you will try these dvd's you will see results. I could not sit back in a kneeling position when I started, my knees just wouldn't do it. I could not hold a simple balancing pose standing on one foot. I can now. I am not only more flexible, but I am more relaxed, have more energy, strength, and even tone. What looks like simple poses had sweat pouring down me, and yet I feel refreshed and so much better. I can walk without pain! On all days no. But with continued use of these and some of her other videos I have now gotten I believe I will eventually get that way. I am 47 with 4 kids, not a stick person lol. I want to stay active. This video met and exceeded my goals. My goal was to not hurt. I did that and now walk 15 + miles a week on top of doing the videos at least 5 times a week. These are short, only about 30 min. and even with my 12 hour work day I fit it in. I know they are not everyones style, but she is the absolute best for teaching the proper form and explaining what each asana is for. I know they have returned my quality of life, and I will continue to practice yoga and use Wai Lana.",1380240000,19,1748,4.129032258064516
1666116,5,B00005UPHN,"I used to do this yoga back when it was broadcasted on TV, and i was thrilled to find it on amazon.
This is great for starting out.

I needed to do something to take away stress and keep me fit and the asanas help in mainly stretching your back, you work out your abs some what  but i love it b/c it really helps in relieve my stress.

 I think i will be buying the intermediate series soon after i feel like ive exhausted my capabilities in the beginners series.
My honest opinion you won't regret buying this series if you want to start doing yoga and never have tried it before, then this is the way to go.",1363910400,6,609,4.05
1666117,5,B00005UPHN,"I have to agree with another reviewer, I find her voice very soothing and easy to fall deep into relaxation. I love the melodies she has for the background music, too. Those things aside, I have made great progress with her DVD's and would recommend them to anyone! I like to do a different one each time, to help maximize the benefits.",1361404800,4,336,4.435483870967742
1666118,5,B00005UPHN,"Love this calming yoga instruction. The background for all the videos are great and relaxing.
Would definately recommend it to anyone who likes yoga.",1358121600,2,149,5.25
1666119,2,B00005UPHN,"After using this for a while, I have shelved it. Just too new age for my tastes. The move from sequence to sequence was ok at first but became more distracting the longer I practiced with this DVD.",1356739200,2,197,4.2105263157894735
1666120,5,B00005UPHN,I am 75 and love this three set introduction to yoga.  I am using the Beginner's Workout and plan to get my husband involved.  The voice of Wai Lana is soothing and she does the explanations clearly. Excellent!!! I believe this will really help my flexibilit.,1343001600,8,259,4.608695652173913

1666122,5,B00005UPHN,I've watched Wai Lana on TV and was very excited to get her DVD's.  She is a very good yoga instructor and I love the feature on the DVD's where I can create my own flow of poses.  I highly recommend this product!,1302393600,8,213,3.9302325581395348
1666123,5,B00005UPHN,"This is a great introduction to yoga. She speaks in plain english (slighty accented, but completely understandable) without all the foreign names more advanced yoga classes require you to know. My coworkers (in their 50's and 60's) have started doing these with me. Good for general stretching for people who've never done anything before. Not for people looking for a strenuous workout. Great for true beginners.",1292371200,14,413,5.2727272727272725
1666124,5,B00005UPHN,"These Yoga tapes are great. You will enjoy Wai Lana tapes, she has easy to harder tapes. Great for the body. I recommend them to all my friends. Hope to still do her tapes to I'm 90+. The easy series is great starter set, or great for the baby boomers, who no longer stand on their heads(if you ever did)! Toning and Relaxation, great, great for your posture.",1266796800,2,359,4.294117647058823
1666125,5,B00005UPHN,"These practices by Wai Lana are a must for every fitness level, for every fitness collection. Instead of throwing you into these poses Ms. Lana takes you step by step with wonderful transitions inbetween, enough to get your footing and she leads you through each of the poses with a soothing voice. Her peacefulness fills your room imparting peace onto you while working. I do not mean to make these videos sound lax in quality. They are not. Wai Lana moves your body, gets the blood moving and creates a heat burning off the impurities we carry. She tones your arms, buttocks, back, and every other part of your body without throwing you for a loop like other practices. I always return to her tapes when I grow tired of my other videos. I highly enjoy them and recommend them.",1264118400,3,778,4.564285714285714
7954943,5,B00005UPHN,"I really enjoy Wai Lana~ this is a good beginners workout IF you are clear not to push yourself beyond your abilities but, instead, just do it regularly and you will see little improvements each time. Stay committed!",1515715200,,216,4.7105263157894735

7954945,4,B00005UPHN,"Had a vhs copy of this routine. DVD is great, Wai Lana easy series is a wonderful routine, softly narrated by Hui Lan Zhang and she is one of only two Chinese nationals to win the Padma Shri Award, which she got in 2016. Routine is challenging, but with consistency yields results.",1503619200,,281,4.423076923076923
