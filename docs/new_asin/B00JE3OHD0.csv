6355403,4,B00JE3OHD0,"Great shows, but the DVD quality is not the best - I know that a lot of it is the rarity of the kinescopes and films of these sort of shows, but some of the episodes here seem to be multi-generational copies of old VHS tapes. Kent Taylor's great in the title role in any event - right up there with Chester Morris and Gerald Mohr.",1432512000,5,330,4.015151515151516

6355410,1,B00JE3OHD0,"I just got through watching this last night.  The video quality was horrible.  It looked like either a copy of a copy of a copy, or else someone copied this off the TV and put it on a DVD.  There was no remastering, digitizing, or in any way enhancing the video.  Why can I get such a clear, sharp video of the Thin Man, which came earlier, but get such junk as this which is not as old as The Thin Man, or other older videos I have.  Amazon should have noted that the video had never been enhanced.

Save you money.  Do NOT buy this video.",1456790400,4,540,3.9906542056074765

6355412,5,B00JE3OHD0,"The quality of the picture isn't great, but it's good and watchable. The shots of the streets circa 1951 are a genuine treasure. Also, it's fun to see young Lee van Cleef under a pound of aging makeup.",1453680000,,201,4.315789473684211

6355414,4,B00JE3OHD0,This is a series that duplicates the stories made famous in the movies.  It is very interesting.  The movie ones are a little better but all are entertaining.,1439164800,3,158,4.607142857142857

8650145,1,B00JE3OHD0,"I like the storylines but the quality of the picture and sound is terrible. If you close your eyes and listen to the dialog like you're listening to a radio show it's okay, but just okay. TV has come a long way since Boston Blacklist, Sky King and Decoy, Dragnet and Highway Patrol. Too had they couldn't take the time and energy to put out a quality show.",1502409600,,356,4.25

8650147,3,B00JE3OHD0,"I goofed on these as they are twenty-four minute, black and white television with amateurville production values.  The plots were light years ahead of ""Colonel March of Scotland Yard"" but that's about all the good there is.",1491091200,,223,5.027027027027027
