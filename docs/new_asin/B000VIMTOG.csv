8218952,5,B000VIMTOG,"Have you ever tried reading the New Testament for yourself and found yourself lost and confused? Are you a little suspicious and confused at all the myriad contradictory interpretations and explanations, a little suspicious of what the Sunday school teachers have taught you over the years, and would just like to figure things out on your own? Well, you are not alone. As the lecturer says at the outset, the New Testament is probably the most revered and least-studied book in the world. This course is the cure. It provides an excellent objective historical and cultural background so you can begin to understand the context of these writings.  It provides the latest in archeological and historical research, and digests it all and puts it in historical context.  Then it goes into concise summaries of each book.

Once you have listened to this course, you can go back to reading the New Testament getting alot more out of it.  It is like being a tourist in a strange land, getting jipped by tour guides who are out to use your ignorance for their own agendas, feeling completely bewildered and lost, and finally finding a map that shows you how to get around on your own.",1312416000,4,1177,4.754901960784314
8218953,5,B000VIMTOG,"This is a great overview of the New Testament.  The Professor is quite knowledgeable and thorough.  He teaches from a ""historical"" viewpoint and sticks to the latest research available.  He does, however, have a bias when it comes to explaining the apocalyptic Jesus.  I think he stretches the data to make his point.  He could have left this particular lecture out as it is his opinion, which he attempts to document.  It is not directly related to informing you about the New Testament.",1246752000,5,488,4.819277108433735
8218954,5,B000VIMTOG,"The Teaching Company offers a huge selection of literally ""great"" courses delivered by some of the country's very best instructors. This course is not an exception to this statement. It is wonderfully produced, and the instructor was both objective and very scholarly. He has done several courses including two others I highly recommend - ""From Jesus to Constantine - The History of Early Christianity,"" and ""The Historical Jesus."" If you are looking for biased and subjective, go to Sunday School. But if you approach this course with an open mind, you will learn something.",1203811200,10,575,5.127659574468085
8218955,1,B000VIMTOG,"Rented this from the library.  Not very objective, and seemed like a lot of one-sided, anti-Christian rhetoric.",1195430400,10,111,5.529411764705882
