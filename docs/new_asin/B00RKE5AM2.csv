As childish of an anime as it may seem from the cover, the anime does have its fare share of dark scenes, along with comedy and some romance that build it up to be such a superb show. If u enjoy animes such as Stein's Gate, RE: Zero, Neon Genesis Evangelion etc, u will absolutely love The Eccentric Family. A definate must watch for all anime lovers. I know the price for the Premium edition box set is high, but since the anime is nothing short of perfection, i do not and will never regret buying this set. So if u got the $, buy it and if u dont, then atleast stream it so you can fall in love with this beauful masterpiece. I don't beleive there is an English dub, but there are English subtitles. Loads of fun and appropriate for all ages, absolutely loved every minute of it.",1508803200,,834,4.154320987654321
8695421,4,B00RKE5AM2,"Kyoto - home to 1.5 million humans, one grumpy tengu, and a family of foolish tanuki. Yasaburo is the third son of the Shimagamo family. He and his family are still grieving the loss of the family head, who was eaten in a hot pot by the human group known as ""Friday Club"". They all miss him greatly, but as you know, sometimes it is simply your fate to end up cooked and eaten in a hot pot. Or at least, it is if you are a tanuki.

The Shimagamo is certainly eccentric. Yasaburo, in addition to being a self-proclaimed idiot, enjoys masquerading as a girl and getting into trouble. His mother likes to cross dress and play pool, and is very afraid of thunder. The second brother lives his life as a frog at the bottom of the well. The youngest and eldest brothers are the closest to being `normal', but they have their moments as well. They are all awesome, lovable characters. In addition there is a cranky tengu, a psychic (psychotic?) girl, two more idiot tanuki, and plenty more fun to be had.

I really liked this series. But in the end there was something that really bugged me - the idea that is ok to eat sentient beings. Frankly, if I found a talking tanuki, I would not try and eat it. Tanuki Nabe (hot pot) is a big part of the story, but it only really bothered me when it is revealed that a character that ate tanuki nabe knew and chatted with the tanuki before eating it. They knew exactly what it was they were eating. Yet this doesn't seem to really bother anyone.

But aside from that one issue, I don't have any complaints. The Eccentric Family is a colorfully, funny, and crazy show that totally lives up to its name.

NIS America releases high quality box sets. This one contains episodes 1-13 (Japanese audio only) plus a full-color 64-page hardcover art book with episode guides, character info, and illustrations. NIS sets are almost always cheaper on their website (right now $51.99 + free shipping) and generally come with some bonus item (key covers for this set).",1422835200,3,1990,4.458791208791209
8695422,4,B00RKE5AM2,"The box is nice, the art book is high quality. The cases for the discs are larger DVD size, rather than the smaller Blu-ray size.

Be warned: the release features english subtitles that cannot be turned off or removed.",1420675200,4,218,4.589743589743589
