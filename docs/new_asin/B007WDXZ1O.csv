8522562,5,B007WDXZ1O,My grandson was ecstatic at receiving this collection of the entire series (at least until 2015). It has an excellent array of special features and quality bluray. This is a must for any fan of the Saw series.,1412985600,,209,4.526315789473684
8522563,2,B007WDXZ1O,"7 Saw movies are included in this 7-disc Blu-ray collection (Saw I-VII). The Saw franchise redefined horror and helped create the term, ""torture porn."" They are awesome, shocking films that can be enjoyed by modern horror freaks. In this collection we get the R-Rated version of Saw while Saw II-VII are unrated. Saw VII is available in 2D and 3D. If you don't own any Saw films yet (or few of them) then consider purchasing this package when the price comes down ($149 is too much). These are 4 star films in a 2 star release.

Overall, this box set is fairly lame like the Saw Quadrilogy. We get an R-Rated Saw when the uncut version was included in the Saw 5-Disc DVD collection. The movies and extras are identical to the stand-alone releases except there is no insert booklet, no list of the extras and the same inexpensive case for the discs. Lionsgate ported over the light bonus content from the previous releases but added nothing (Saw and Saw II get almost no treatment). I expected a total of about 7 hours (1 hour per movie) of extras to justify the upgrade. Fans may want to purchase the latest sequels individually on Blu-ray.

8522564,5,B007WDXZ1O,"The SAW series isn't filled with shocks and scares but the level of blood and personal violence increases through the first four.  I think the term ""torture flick"" is appropriate for them.  Movies 5 and 6 disappointed a bit but the final movie wraps everything up well.  It's always nice to see old characters come back at the end.",1362787200,,331,4.576271186440678
8522565,5,B007WDXZ1O,It more than met my expectations.  A horror movie must be totally scary and have lots of blood to be worth watching and these are the greatest and the best that I own.  They will become classics!,1355011200,2,195,4.243243243243243
