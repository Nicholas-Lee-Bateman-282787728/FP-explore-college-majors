8166323,5,B000096I8W,"My father was in WW II, and I am a fan of Foyle's War. Michael Kitchen (Foyle's War) is great in everything he does, so I can unreservedly recommend anything with him. It isn't a fun movie, but you get a lot of information about WW II.",1382659200,2,235,4.0212765957446805
8166324,4,B000096I8W,"Martin Bormann rose through the ranks of the Nazi party to become Hitler's closest confidante during the last days of World War II. This DVD uses color reenactments combined with interviews and newsreel footage to tell the story of the rise and fall of Martin Bormann.

Bormann saw Hitler as a genius and ""a great man;"" and Bormann joined the Nazi party in 1927. Bormann wanted power and he quickly went to Munich to ingratiate himself with those currently in Hitler's favor even before Hitler took over Germany. The DVD movie may be a short 50 minutes; but it documents the story of how Bormann controlled Nazi party fundraisers and eventually Hitler's personal bank account. Bormann stopped at nothing to get what he wanted--close access to Hitler so that eventually he himself could control the Nazi party. Even in the last days of World War II Bormann still intended to rule the Nazi party after Hitler's death; and Hitler even approved of that in his final will and testament.

Other topics explored in this historical video include Bormann's handling of the Jewish ""liquidation;"" Bormann's intense disdain for Catholics and the Catholic Church and many other disgusting and horrifying stories proving Bormann was an inhumane lunatic driven purely by his desire for power. You also learn why Bormann was referred to as ""Hitler's Fixer.""

The color reenactments are very fuzzy; I cannot tell if they were meant to be produced that way or if the technology used was poor. In fact, all I had to do was accidentally move my laptop screen a half inch too far back or too far forward and I could hardly see the color image on my computer screen! The black and white footage of Hitler and his partners in evil reflects the passage of time--there are splotches and no attempt was made to improve the quality of the image. However, that is a very minor disappointment.

Interesting interviews include commentary by Bormann's eldest son who became a priest in later life; and former British spies give special insight into the action as well. Excellent!

I recommend this DVD for anyone who wants a better understanding of what went on behind the scenes at the very top of the Nazi party. Through Bormann's example you learn just how ruthless the top Nazis could be when it came time ""to turn each other in"" as traitors before their leader. If you gained insight and knowledge from this DVD you may be interested in other DVDs that deal more professionally with the horrors and insanity of Hitler's rise to power and the men who helped Hitler including Martin Bormann. I particularly recommend the BBC's DVD entitled The Nazis - A Warning from History for further study and a more sophisticated understanding of the evils of the men who controlled Germany through ""The Third Reich.""",1172534400,9,2777,4.82563025210084
8166325,3,B000096I8W,Not much is known about Martin Borman. This DVD tells us much more than past videos with many interviews with Bormann's relatives.  Well worth watching for those who are interested in this subject.,1124409600,15,197,4.96969696969697
8166326,4,B000096I8W,"Martin Bormann is probably one of the world's most infamous underachievers in the sense that he rose from obscurity by being the ultimate company man, willing to say and do anything to please Hitler and thereby ensure his own desperate status as a somebody in the universe of freaks and psychopaths that fluttered in Hitler's domain. He survived at least temporarily in the confusion of the siege of Berlin by the Soviets, and various accounts having him succumbing to a sniper to escaping to Brazil.
Whatever his fate, his is an unusual story, depicted here quite well through the use of documentary newsreels and circumstantial evidence. Thus this documentary about his rise to become Hitler's deputy, and as such one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich, is a strange tale indeed. Bormann skillfully controlled access to Hitler and use this power to manage his own political and private affairs. In the end of course, he could not escape the fall of the Third Reich and all it meant to those in the Nazi superstructure.
This film concentrates on the quite intense personal relationship between Hitler, on the one hand, and Martin Bormann, illustrating how it was that Bormann connived his way through adroit insinuation into the innermost circle of the Nazi hierarchy, fashioning a spot for himself that was unrivaled within Hitler's inner circle. Indeed, by the time of the fall of Berlin, Hitler referred to Bormann as being ""my most faithful party comrade"", anointing him as the incumbent leader of the Nazi party. The film ruminates about the mysteries surrounding Bormann's final fate, including the enduring rumors about Bormann's supposed `escape' to South America and the allegation that he might have been a Soviet spy. This is an entertaining look at one of the most misunderstood of the figures in the Nazi hierarchy. Enjoy!",1085961600,55,1845,4.9935064935064934
