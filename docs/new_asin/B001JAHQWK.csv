5740247,5,B001JAHQWK,"Living abroad as I do and watching with family who aren't native English speakers presents problems. The first season had English subtitles but since then none of the seasons have had them. My guess is that there are non-native English speakers who enjoyed this show when it was first on-with subtitles in their native languages. Also those of us who are hard-of-hearing would benefit as well. Those are additional markets that are being neglected here.
My ongoing review. The top menu only directly accesses the episodes-none for individual skits. However, each episode is divided into sections that can be accessed with your remote.
In this season Mo Collins joins-Lorraine Swanson(the midwestern lady who can't make up her mind), Trina, Stewart's Mom Doreen, Cher(""Do you believe I'm still alive?""), and Alanis Morissette (""Wash Me"" video). Michael McDonald also joins this season playing Stewart(the 30+ year old little boy, Rusty Miller (college dweeb), and others. Phil Lamarr plays the UBS man, Little Hassan Taylor(racist songs for the white OFAY-""Kiss my big black ass,"" etc. Alex Boorstein plays Ms. Swan(He looka lika man.) Pat Kilbane as the Spishak salesman sells Yule Blazers (plutonium-based Christmas tree lights). Will Sasso plays President Clinton, accident-prone woodworkman Paul Timberman, and Kenny Rogers. Nicole Sullivan plays racist country singer, Darlene McBride, the Vancome Lady, and Antonia. The Halloween show includes Kiss and ""Nightmare on Elm Street's"" Robert Englund and has some funny skits. Would you let your teenage daughter go out with KISS-the whole band? Siegfried and Roy(Kilbane & McDonald) as Crime Fighters. Aries Spears as James Brown Jr. Deborah Wilson and Nicole Sullivan as ""Lida and Melina."" Guest Shaquille O'Neal plays Dennis Rodman's sister on Lowered Expectations.",1383609600,2,1818,5.496428571428571

5740273,5,B001JAHQWK,"Show was hilarious from the beginning but it really picked up with the inclusion of Michael McDonald and Mo Collins. This could very well be the best cast out of all the 14 seasons, plus Artie Lang and Orlando Jones still pop in from time to time as special guests. Has many memorable impersonations/characters such as Kenny Rogers, James Brown, Lorraine, Stuart, Vancome lady, Ms Swan, story time with Mr. Sasso, UBS guy, Marvin Tikvah, Paul Timberman, Sling Blade, Steven Seagal, Antonia, Christopher Walken... you really can't go wrong with this collection. Really hoping that Shout Factory doesn't cancel the production of these DVDs, and that they bring us Season 5 soon.

Please keep the show alive, it was part of my childhood! :)",1427068800,10,737,4.943548387096774

5740282,5,B001JAHQWK,"I have been waiting for YEARS for the GOOD seasons of MadTV to come out on DVD. For the longest time, it was only seasons 1 & 2 available. Now, I would take those seasons over any season of SNL, but let's face it, seasons 1 & 2 were not MadTV's best. I was afraid that the powers that be were seeing poor sales of those, and deciding not to release the rest of the seasons.  Hopefully they will see how well seasons 3 and 4 are selling and realize fans want this.

Season 3 starts for me the ""golden years"" of MadTV. When Will Sasso and Alex Borstein (among others) came along and frankly made MadTV the best it could be. Also in the lineup and providing plenty of laughs are Aries, Debra, Michael, Mo, Nicole, and Phil.  Andrew Bowen does a great and hilarious Nick Cage and Keanu Reeves.

Please powers-that-be, don't stop now! Give us the rest of the seasons.",1403827200,9,862,4.269938650306749
5740283,5,B001JAHQWK,MADtv was such a great show.  It's a great comedy and seasons 4 - 11 were really funny.  Love all the characters especially Stuart & Lorraine.  I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to be released.,1397088000,,200,4.2105263157894735

Watching Mad Tv brings back so many memories of watching the show when I was younger. It still makes me laugh to this day. I still haven't finished watching the entire season, but so far it's really funny.",1396396800,2,276,4.3076923076923075
5740285,3,B001JAHQWK,"I love mad tv but I bought this show for three characters mainly and two of them I didn't see. I love the swan lady, stewert and the older lady who has her pants up to her boobs that says ugggghh.. I cant remember her name but I didn't see stewert or the older lady I watched about 2 hours of this show and nothing.. I don't know if they are in the later episodes on this disc but I got bored. so if your looking for them two characters I would go with a later series. But other than that the dvd was in fantastic shape and most the shows were funny.",1392681600,2,550,3.8761061946902653
