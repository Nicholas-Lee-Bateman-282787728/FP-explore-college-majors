229893,5,6300214117,"What can I say? This movie is EXCELLENT in every way and from start to finish! Perfect mix of laughter , tears , and a mother's unconditional love for her daughter that is sometimes strained , but always her top priority. The cast is phenomenal , and Jack Nicholson really "" ups the ante "" with his hilarious antics! Shirley MacLaine gives a star performance ( like in every movie she stars in ) and gives the perfect balance of fun as well as being serious when the situation calls for it! This is one of my top favorite movies of all time! Just once watch and you will definitely want to see it over and over again! Just awesome!!!",1518048000,,633,4.283333333333333
229894,5,6300214117,"Whenever I need a good pick me up, this movie is just the best. The romance between Aurora (Shirley MacLaine) and Garrett (Jack Nicholson), is truly one of the greatest of all time. They have this chemistry that is pure passion and so electric. Every single scene is pure gold. If Garrett is trying have Aurora over for dinner and impress her; Aurora jumps up and insults him for keeping his Astronaut memorabilia on his walls and then they have a fight and then kiss and make up :)
I just love them both so much!
Of course the relationship between Emma (Debra Winger) and Aurora is also timeless. These two have their closeness in a way that every mother and daughter can easily recognize and relate to. Debra Winger just shines as Emma! Of course this movie requires at least a whole box of Kleenex. If you can even watch past the last scenes. I can't. Little Tommy will break your heart in the end if it's not broken already. These kids are amazing! I have ""no words""- for the calamity and wickedness that is Flap Horton. Aurora is proven right about her pre-wedding premonition.

I was just a little girl when this movie was filmed in my hometown. And everyone was just ecstatic that Lincoln, Nebraska was now ""in a big movie"". It's so funny to always see the sign that says, ""Now leaving Texas,"" and know exactly where that grain bin is on Highway 2 near S.14th Street. And to recognize Kay's Restaurant. We went there on Sundays, if we were good. And to sit in the Safari room was such a treat. The restaurant scene is actually filmed on the other side of the restaurant without the fun Safari motif. But Kay's Restaurant isn't there anymore; and it brings back the good memories to see it on film.

Terms of Endearment, regardless of where it was filmed shows the courageous story of a mom who loves her daughter more than anything and has to watch as her daughters life takes one tragic turn after another; it is about a dear mom who loves her three little children more than anything else; and tragically gets dealt such a bad hand so early in her life. It addresses the really hard times that rip your life apart and leave you tattered and torn. And it shows really what life is all about. It is timeless and such a dear precious gift to us all. So many people worked so hard to bring it to life! Such a gift!
James L. Brooks really knows how to make a great movie :)",1517875200,,2377,4.375565610859729

230078,4,6300214117,"Review of ""Terms of Endearment""
Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

Oh boy, get out your Kleenexes. And be sure to have an extra box on hand!

I don't usually like Debra Winger, but she gives an incredible performance in the film. Its easy to see why she was nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars alongside Shirley MacLaine, although its sad that in such a contest one woman will inevitably lose. Shirley MacLaine won, largely due to the famous and often spoofed Give my daughter her shot! scene.

Jeff Daniels, John Lithgow, and Jack Nicholson provide the male talent, and each give great performances without overshadowing the women; after all, the movie belongs to Shirley and Debra. There are a few humorous moments, but keep in mind that its a heavy drama. Dont be fooled by the cuteness of the opening scene.

Im not going to spoil the plot, or even tell you anything about it. Its a story about a mother and her daughter, simple as that. Sometimes they get along, sometimes they dont, but they love each other more than most people love in their entire lives. Everyoneyes, I mean everyonewill bawl during this movie. If you love your mother, hate your mother, have a complex relationship with your mother (or daughter), are extremely close or wish youd been closereveryone will bawl. Snot sniveling, mouth drooling, cant-catch-your-breath bawl. So, if you're in the mood for that, go ahead and watch Terms of Endearment. And if you really want to sob, watch it with your mother.",1498435200,,1483,4.736434108527132

230155,5,6300214117,"Growing up I would watch this film with my mother as it was one of her favorites. At that time, I could neither understand nor appreciate what this movie really had to offer. With Mother's Day around the corner this movie came to mind, and I thought I would purchase it on DVD for my mom. I then decided I would give this ""old favorite"" a viewing (thanks to Amazon Prime) as it has easily been 15 years since I've seen the movie. After watching the entire 130 minutes - I can say I've laughed and literally sobbed with these characters. I can see why my mom loves this movie so much, even more so now that I am a mother myself to a little girl. What a great film about a perfectly imperfect relationship between mother and daughter with the outskirts of their own personal lives and relationships.

But I couldn't stand it.

It was slow, pointless, and the worst part - the death of any movie or book for me - the characters were all completely unlikable people that I couldn't bring myself to care two whits about.

Many reviewers here also comment about how realistic the characters are. If these are the kind of people you know in real life and you think are realistic and behave realistically, I'm kind of sad for you.

Frankly, there's nothing wrong with rough characters or characters with tragic personal flaws. Especially when it comes to movies and literature, these kind of things add flavor, interest, depth, and dimension.

231568,4,6300214117,"I rate this 4 though the movie was good for the simple reason that there is no concentration at all concerning Flaps background. No familyis ever mentioned. The two married and the concern was Aurora not being at the wedding. There arefamily dinners etc but Flapnever has anyone there for him not even a best friend? Also though Pasy has some friends in New York through her eprofessional work whatever that is as that isn't explored either, Emma only has her...she has no outside social life except Flap and the children and some discourses with Mom and Rosey the household helper or maid...

The Evening Star follows similar only worse as the young girl (her name slips my mind) has absolutly no female friends...the only soc ializawtion she has is with her bf who later on dumps her. There is NEVER nop mention in either movie about outside soc ialization. BGoth movies to me were one dimensional in characterization.",1464566400,,920,4.786163522012578

231699,5,6300214117,"Tremendously moving, often very funny, and bursting at the seams with life, both good and bad.  No one is a hero or a villain, every character is just a screwed up human being trying their best, often failing, but picking themselves back up and trying again.

At the core this is the study of a very prickly mother daughter relationship, but it branches out to cover the men in their lives, friendships with other women, etc.  The performances are just about universally superb.  Some splashy and fun (Jack Nicholson, Shirley MacLaine), others just slightly lower key but still just slightly bigger than life in that good, movie way (Debra Winger), and still others are so simple and quiet they routinely get overlooked, but are little gems as well (Jeff Daniels, John Lithgow).

The film has a wonderful way of never going quite where you expect it, as it traces 30 years of life.  Serious scenes turn funny, funny scenes end up making you cry, and no one ends up where they, or we, would have guessed.  Especially in more recent, revisionist reviews, the film is often attacked for being sappy or melodramatic, but the older I get the more I see that life itself can be sappy and melodramatic, and if those elements are dealt with honestly they can translate real emotions, and can be part of a terrific film.

The only nit-pick I have is a few of the very small roles are clichs (e.g. the upper-class young ladies Wingers character meets in New York).  But when thats the worst you can find to say about a 130 minute film, you're in a pretty great place.  One hell of a feature debut for James L. Brooks.",1461024000,10,1607,4.56794425087108

That shift of narrative is seamless almost like a car on a trip that suddenly takes another road. Debra Winger gives one of her best performances and Shirley McClain won an Oscar for hers. Everyone has a mother which is why I think this film resounded so deeply with people and still does today for die hard fans of the film and new fans who discover it every day.

Now that that is cleared up, I had not seen this movie since 1983, and Emma died just as my wife died, looking into her mother's eyes. The movie destroyed me. Shirley MacLaine richly deserved her Oscar. Deborah Winger was fantastic. I don't think anything like it has ever been made.

I question the Best Picture though, The Right Stuff was excellent and so was The Big Chill, but it was well done.  It follows the life a mother and daughter over about fifteen years from when the daughter gets married until the daughter passes from cancer.  Tearjerker - yes, chick-flick - yes, but a well acted that holds it's own.  Both the Mom and daughter are headstrong, but love each other.  The mom is smothering and flighty and the daughter is headstrong and more of a victim with three kids and a cheating husband.  They endure.

232574,2,6300214117,"I know, I know, it took me YEARS to finally sit down and watch this movie. I just finished it and I'm fairly certain I wore a grimace or a puzzled look through the entire thing. It was painful. I do not understand why this movie is so popular. The dialogue was awful. The story is full of holes and is just choppy. The phone conversations are badly scripted. I was left confused for most of the movie. So Emma has an affair and her uptight mom apparently knows about it (where's the conversation about that?), but has nothing to say about it? The acting is only good in certain places. The story gets a little better near the end. But not even Shirley MacLaine's acting, which I normally love, could make her character bearable to watch. Emma's character is sooo irritating and selfish - she berates Flap for appearing to have an affair while she is having one the whole time and nobody ever finds out about it. And the poor kids barely get to speak in the entire movie or they're totally ignored, and Patsy the best friend role is terribly acted and one-dimensional. I hear this is a top notch ""mom-daughter"" film, but thank God my relationship with my mom isn't like this at all. Perhaps I'm missing some deeper meaning in the film and am just not ""enlightened"" enough to appreciate it... however, I doubt I'll be giving it another chance.",1398384000,5,1341,4.477551020408163

232695,1,6300214117,I ordered this movie for a Christmas gift and received an Arrested Development CD instead from 1993. This took me back to a time in my life when I realized the death of rock n roll was inevitable and not only rehashing this terrible time in the history of music I was unable to give my mother the sentimental Christmas gift I had ordered her for Christmas and actually rented the movie to suffice for the celebration of the baby Jesus. Arrested Development should have never garnered recognition for their music. Just a constant reminder that mediocrity will always prevail in the world of popular music and true artists suffer till they discreetly die and their music is never discovered till they are an ashtray. God Bless the Starved Arteest!,1390089600,,745,4.7384615384615385
232696,5,6300214117,"Film-making at its finest and genuinely deserving winner of 5 Academy Wards, including Best Picture, Best Actress (Shirley MacLaine, in a very tight, well-publicized, tension-filled decision over Debra Winger, who by the way just happened to be her co-star and was every bit as deserving), Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson, over co-star John Lithgow, albeit with a lot less drama than MacLaine and Winger), Best Director and Best Screenplay (both James L. Brooks).

There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but the ones that come the closest compensate for any less-than-perfect scenes with life-affirming moments that leave the viewer perceiving it as perfect just the same.  That's why ""Terms of Endearment"" belongs with the best of the best.  Now over 30 years old, I guess it's possible that there may be a select few who don't know what happens in the lives of ""Aurora Greenway"" (MacLaine) and daughter ""Emma"" (Winger).  If not, with your undivided attention, it would be an understatement to say that this movie will enrich your life, as there are certain SCENES and LINES from this movie that are better than most WHOLE movies (if you haven't seen the movie, please watch it before reading any further, to avoid spoilers).  Its beautifully fitting soundtrack is also distinctly its own.  [Major Spoiler Alert!]

Examples of memorable scenes and lines from ""Terms of Endearment"" (mostly in chronological order):
1.  Aurora pinches baby Emma to make sure she's breathing.  A perfect foreshadowing.
2.  When Emma and her little family leave for Iowa, Emma asks new husband ""Flap Horton"" (Jeff Daniels, in a career-high performance also deserving of high praise, especially in comparison to his polar-opposite/zany performance in ""Dumb and Dumber) to pull away from the curb slowly, Flap steps on the gas (and we know that this signifies a stereotypical mother-in-law relationship).
3.  After his Dad, Flap, comes back up the stairs of their home, after he had started to leave for work, the younger ""Tommy"" actor (Shane Serwin) puts his coat on and waits on the steps outside, as if he knows exactly why dad came back (you have to see the movie to know why).
4.  When Emma doesn't have enough money at the grocery store and starts to put some things back, which include things that she then realizes she promised the kids, she starts putting smaller versions of these same items back in with the groceries (a single candy bar instead of the whole economy pack).  Then, they are miraculously saved by ""Sam Burns"" (Lithgow), a local banker (how fitting!), who then tells the clerk that she was rude and ""...must be from New York"" (I love the way the movie seamlessly alternates between comedy and drama).
5.  Once leaving the grocery store, the older Tommy actor (Troy Bishop, who reminds me of a young Charles Grodin), realizing Sam is a potential threat to break up his family (because he knows his parents haven't been getting along), in a kind of last-resort desperation, unsuccessfully tries to get Emma, his mom, away from Sam so that nothing can materialize between them (kids are much more perceptive and influenced than most people realize).
6.  Aurora finally giving in to Garrett Breedlove's (Nicholson) advances, ever so cautiously creeping up his front-door steps with her hands on the rails.
7.  Sam Burns:  ""Even though I'm scared and we've committed adultery, I'm just so grateful to God, or the Devil, for letting me feel this way again.""  LOL, classic!
8.  Emma in the bathroom with ""Teddy"" (Huckleberry Fox, in a performance way beyond his young years), when she asks him not to flush so that she can continue her secret conversation with Sam.
9.  Garrett and Aurora's crazy car ride on the beach, at Garrett's urging, culminating in Aurora's ""Get it outta there!""  LOL! There are few movies such as this that can so easily go from one extreme to the other so effortlessly (that's what pure-gem films and TV shows are made of).
10.  Garrett to Aurora:  ""Is the Renoit under the covers?"" and, ""I was doing laps when you called; luckily for us I only did eight.""  LOL!
11.  Aurora (thinking to herself, waiting for Garrett to come from next door and hearing him get there faster than she thought):  ""Oh my God, he ran it.""  LOL!
12.  When their baby sister ""Melanie"" gets croup, Teddy encourages his dad to help his mom with the baby, knowing that's better for their marriage, and Tommy and Teddy lovingly know exactly what Melanie needs, and where to find it, to make her feel better.
13.  Emma asserts herself to Flap when suspecting infidelity:  ""If you are doing something and you're trying to make me feel crazy because I'm bearing your child, then you may have sunk to a point so low that you'll never recover.  You may have just panicked, Flap, and, trying to save yourself, you've thrown out your character and your principles.  Now the only way you can possibly redeem yourself and be the man that God intended you to be is to admit to me anything that you might've been doing last night because, if you don't do that, if you don't do that right now, you're a lost man.""
14.  Emma confronting husband Flap and his mistress right on campus and Flap running after Emma with baby Melanie (a real baby, not a doll, which makes the scene, well, more real).
15.  Emma, although without Flap, is ecstatic to see her mom, after having moved so far away, and literally jumps right into her arms.  Then, they walk up to the car to get the kids, and just after you hear ""Grandma, grandma, grandma,"" Tommy looks into his mom's eyes as if to say, ""Does grandma know what's really going on?""
16.  Emma and Aurora drinking coffee (or tea) in bed, while lying on their stomachs, so true and very believable as mother and daughter (regardless of what may or may not have happened behind the scenes).
17.  After being home for a visit and Emma goes to see best friend ""Patsy,"" even though the kids are having fun in the pool, when their dad calls their mom on the poolside phone, Tommy and Teddy make sure to listen, knowing their parents' (and the whole family's) situation.
18.  Once in Nebraska, on campus, Emma:  ""Miss!""  Melanie repeats it:  ""Miss!""  Emma to mistress:  ""Don't make me run after you; I have a toddler here.""
19.  When Aurora gets her daughter's diagnosis straight from the doctor and his counsel, she says, ""...And they let you get away with that?""
20.  Emma is ever so relieved to hear that one of Patsy's friends' names is ""Jane"" (you have to see the movie to know why).
21.  When Aurora gets a surprise visit from Garrett at the Nebraska hotel, after she recently found out her daughter's diagnosis, Aurora finally breaks down.
22.  Aurora and Garrett's goodbyes at the airport, complete with butt grabs!  Garrett (after the first goodbye):  ""I was inches away from a clean getaway.""  With second goodbye, he then says, ""I love you too, kid.""
23.  Aurora pleads like crazy for the nurses to give Emma the pain shot, which is probably the scene that clinched her Academy Award, by the skin of her teeth, over Winger (plus MacLaine simply having more friends in the Academy of voters because of being older and also having done more movies), but how could you not love them both?  (There has actually been a Best Actress tie before in Oscar history, but it would have been the most fitting for MacLaine and Winger.  The National Society of Film Critics, one of the top 10 award guilds, actually did award Winger as Best Actress over MacLaine.)
24.  Flap and Aurora's accidental meeting in the cafeteria (with that I-guess-we-now-have-to-sit-together tension) and subsequent discussion about the custody of the kids doesn't go well.
25.  Emma, on her deathbed, tells Flap that she honestly feels the kids shouldn't end up with him, and he admits that she's right.  After they mutually agree (Flap begrudgingly) that the kids should be raised by Aurora, Flap says, ""I probably had that coming.""  Pure genius.
26.  Emma, on her deathbed, to son Teddy (maybe the most touching moment among many):  ""I was so scared, but I think it went really well, don't you?""  Teddy, exiting the room in tears, nods.  Emma whispers, ""Yeah?""
27.  When Aurora is leaving the hospital with her 3 grandkids and they are on the grounds outside, Tommy makes the mistake of criticizing his mom right in front of his grandma, Aurora, who then slaps him (nothing fake here)...three times(!), before they embrace and Tommy says, ""I'm sorry.""  This is maybe the most powerful and authentic-feeling scene in the movie...so authentic, in fact, that I've always wondered if MacLaine needed to apologize to child actor Bishop in real life for really slapping him, three times.  That scene alone is better than five whole mediocre movies.
28.  Aurora and Emma look lovingly at each other in Emma's hospital room the evening before Emma passes.  A dream?
29.  Garrett's caring heart finally shines through as he comforts Tommy and walks hand-in-hand with little Melanie at the services.
30.  Patsy sits with Flap to comfort him, and Flap puts his head on Patsy's shoulder.
31.  Aurora asks Melanie to sit just a little bit closer, which is perhaps a foreshadowing for the sequel, ""Evening Star.""",1389484800,,9197,4.788839568801522

My former co-worker once ""termed"" this movie as the one where ""the mother and daughter talk on the phone all the time"". Well, it is. Burt Reynolds has taken a lot of heat over the years, because he turned down the role that won Jack Nicholson an Oscar, to do ""Stroker Ace"".

She doesn't even value her own role as a full-time mother.  Her kids don't treat her with respect, and she doesn't correct them.  She's total victim, completely by choice.  Then she gets cancer and dies.  Yes, that's sad.  Cancer is the one thing she could not change.  But good grief, this movie was made in the 1980s, not the 19th century, when women had few choices and fewer rights.  She could have grown a backbone and stood up to her mother and told her to mind her own business.  She could have thrown her philandering husband out, or at least held him accountable.

232803,5,6300214117,"Looking for a movie to watch, I picked up Terms of Endearment (DVD) at the store. I looked at the back and noticed it won multiple Oscars. While I expected this to be a well made movie, I did not know this was a tearjerker. My mother and sister both started to cry in the end and this might not a suitable movie for a young and sensitive child. If you do watch it with a younger audience, I would encourage to talk and discuss the movie afterwards!

Terms of Endearment is a movie about relationships, most specifically the relationship between a daughter and her mother. Aurora Greenway and her daughter Emma have been extremely attached to each other since the day little Emma was born. Her mother is very protective but loving over her. As for the father, he passed away when Emma was a child. Much to her mother's dislike, Emma marries Flap, a man who will get her out of her sheltered home and into the world. She is absolutely in love with talk and words despite him deep down being rather boring and not very successful in his job of being a college professor. Aurora refuses to attend the wedding and is disgusted when Emma announces her pregnancy. Eventually, Emma moves to Iowa and her best friend, Patsy, moves to New York to become rich due to her career driven personality. This makes an interesting comparison to Emma, who decides to be a stay at home mother instead. As the movie continues, it shows how  both Aurora and Emma's lives play out in both good and bad times of their life. One of the highlights is Aurora's romance with the neighbor Garrett who happens to be an retired astronaut who also enjoys swimming and dating women. But it is pretty obvious by the end of the film that no women had touched his heart like Aurora before. Closing up the movie, tragedy hits.

This movie has absolutely beautiful performances by Shirley MacLaine, Debra Winger, Jack Nicholson, and many others. The characters are extremely real and complex. There is no good or bad to this. It is all one big grey area. The characters we love did bad things, the characters we could not stand did good things. Just like in real life, of course. It will make you laugh, cry, and just all around care for this family. This movie is definitely not afraid of being sentimental and pulling on our heart strings. There are scenes in this that you know were shot to get us to cry out and feel bad for the characters. Not to mention, the soundtrack! Oh the soundtrack. I hear it get criticized often for being a little much but I enjoyed it. Terms of Endearment is a tearjerker and it is proud!

I would highly recommend watching this movie to anyone who loves their family or a good movie. It makes a good mother/daughter movie, I am sure we can all relate even if we have not been in these exact situations ourselves.

Brooks (most known for his work on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"") wrote and directed one of the greatest dramas of all-time. The movie, however, was not without its problems behind the scenes. Debra Winger, who played the daughter, was not easy to work with, and there were many casting changes for the role of the next-door neighbor astronaut, a role that ultimately went to Jack Nicholson. Burt Reynolds was the producers original choice, but he had to drop out because of other commitments. Harrison Ford was offered the role, only to turn it down. At one point during filming MacLaine stated to James L. Brooks that ""he could shove the Oscar up his #$#!"". Eventually, all was settled on the set and ""Terms of Endearment"" went on to enjoy huge boxoffice and critical acclaim.

What made the film for me were the characters & performance BOTHER OSCAR WINNERS FOR Shirley as Aurora & Jack as Garrett.

Winger & Daniels characters I just hated.  Why did she stay with him after the cheating?  His cheating made it OK for her to cheat with John Lithgow's character?  2 wrongs do NOT make a right.

The oldest son Tommy.  It took till near the end with him walking out of the hospital with his grandmother till an adult stood up to him for his behavior.  Parents NEVER did a thing about it.

Danny De Vito & his small part.  Never did figure out why he was with the family when Emma was in the hospital near the end of the film.  His character did NOTHING.

Still a good film after the passage of time.  Although, does not have the impact it did when released.

SO LACKING & BAD.  A CD with 4 songs-2 I know & like the others I have never heard of before do NOT make up for what else is NOT included.
There is NO brochure/pamphlet inside, any sort of information on the film.  Film makers, this was a big hit & Best Picture winner for 1983.  NO DELETED SCENES OR BLOOPERS.  Nothing.  No chapter search list.

So, when I was roped into seeing this film and found myself actually caring about what happens to the characters, I was pleasantly surprised.  The performances, especially Shirley MacLaine's, are very emotionally charged, yet believable. I found myself really liking and really disliking each character in turn, but that's what makes them real.  The plot bounces right along and the film is all-together very watchable (even for a seasoned chick-flick hater such as myself). Larry McMurtry always had a penchant for entertaining story-telling, and this movie is no exception.  The only character I had trouble believing was Garrett Breedlove. As much as I respect Jack Nicholson's ability, not even he could make his corny antics work. Garrett the astronaut stuck out like a sore--albeit sometimes amusing--thumb among all the other ""ordinary"" people. Nicholson did what he could with it, but the subplot itself just seemed like it belonged in a different movie.  All in all, a good flick, even if you typically don't go in for movies that try to evoke the full gamut of human emotion in two hours flat.",1222905600,,1212,4.985148514851486
233509,5,6300214117,"One of the top grossing films of 1983, including sweeping away 5 Oscars, Terms of Endearment, not only is a heart-felt relationship between a sensitive and compassionate daughter (Debra Winger) and her over bearing mother, (Shirley MacLaine) but also what it means to get caught-up in the day to day: and faced with the really tough things in life like seeing one's child go through unnecessary torment and hardship- but most of all, the film shows us about living in the moment, having fun in the moment, because life is fleeting, and often times, tragic.

Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson), a retired astronaut, lives next door to Aurora Greenway (Shirley MacLaine) and as middle age can be very lonely sometimes, reveals to Aurora a selfish man, but also one who enjoys life and she sets out to meet him, that ends in a strange but beautiful relationship. Taking away, at least, a little attention from her suffering daughter miles and states away.

This film is certainly a character driven film rather than plot driven because the story is a simple one. It is the dialouge, acting and the great direction of James L. Brooks, (Broadcast News, As Good as it Gets, to name a few) known in the industry as the 'actors director' which makes this film one of the best of 1883.

As I was watching it, I kept saying to myself ""When does this get better?"" It never did, not once over its achingly long 131 minute running time.

Jack Nicholson, as the next door neighbor, is outstanding as always and is a sleezy womanizing former astronaut who befriends Ms. MacLaine but by movie's end it is clear he loves her and is perhaps a changed man.

What do people see in this? For the life of me I cannot understand why a melodramatic piece of twaddle like ""Bridges of Madison County"" was a hit. I don't see what the big thrill about Madonna is either. She absolutely can't act. Her records are put together for her by producers. They crowd the stage with dancers and special effects in her concerts, in hopes you don't notice how little talent she really has.

She doesn't write her own songs. She doesn't play any instruments. She doesn't have a strong voice. Compared to someone like Sheryl Crow, who writes all her own material, plays most of the instruments, and has a very strong voice, Madonna is a poseur. I really have to wonder about anyone who would view her as anything other than a egomaniacal twit.

And please, don't even get me started on Bruce Springsteen.

Which brings me to ""Terms of Endearment."" What is so hard to understand about the fact that your average American male doesn't care about ""Women, and their relationships with their mothers""? I don't know of any man under the age of 40 who would sit through something like this movie, unless he thought it would help put his wife or girlfriend ""In the Mood"", and that he would reap the benefit later that evening. The characters aren't all that sympathetic. Debra Winger is supposed to elicit sympathy as the dying cancer sufferer, but she's such a whiny bitch it's hard to feel it. Shirley MacLaine is so obnoxious you just want to punch her right in the face. Jeff Daniels is a clueless career student who becomes a college teacher so he doesn't have to go out in the real world to make a living. The one bright spot for me was Jack Nicholson, but even his bright moments are too few and far between. Terms of Endearment isn't a awful movie, but I don't think it deserved anywhere near the accolades it got.

The mother, ""Aurora"" is completely against ""Melanie"" getting married because she thinks she's making a mistake. It is either because she's too young, or ""Aurora"" doesn't think ""Flap,"" an English professor is successful enough to care for her daughter.

They have their differences; yet the love between them is always so obvious.  It's also refreshing how they seem to be able to talk about anything with each other, even their sex lives.

I've seen this movie several times, and everytime I cry at the end.  In spite of the death, the movie ends on a positive note, giving us the feeling that life is going on and everything is going to be okay.

The budding relationship between Aurora and her neighbor (also brilliantly portrayed by Jack Nicholson) creates a plot-within-a-plot that is very entertaining and provides some comic relief from the sadness of the relationship between Emma and her husband and children.

The most interesting aspect is that Emma gets so bent out of shape when she finds out that her husband has been cheating on her, when she has been cheating on him as well.  Somehow though we sympathize with Emma and her gentle lover (played by the very talented John Lithgow).  We feel like they belong together and somehow their relationship doesn't seem wrong.

233813,5,6300214117,"Perhpas the greatest film of the 1980s', James L. Brooks' 1983 masterpiece ""Terms Of Endearment"" (based on the novel by Larry McMurtly) is a powerful, motional and often hilarious story of a mother and a a daughter and the ups and downs in their often sad relation ship. Showered with awards (including an Oscar for best picture), it has not aged a bit since then.

Shirley MacLaine won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Aurora Greenway, a middle agd woman dealing with a dull life hampered by a tumultuous relationship with her daughter Emma (Debra Winger). Married to the dull witted Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels) and raising three kids, Aurora is dissatisfied with the lifestyle Emma has chosen. She is also unhappy with her own life. She is living alone except for her maid (Betty King), and the only man who seems to be interested in her is a short, semi-unlikable man named Vernon Dahlart (Danny DeVito). However, one man is about to change her life forever. That man is Garret Breedlove (Jack Nicholson, who deservedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar), a carefree, boozing, womanizing former astronaut who adds a sense of la bella vita to Aurora's mundain existence. Meanwhile, Emma has suspected Flap of cheating, and she hooks up with a married banker named Sam Burns (John Lithgow, who wowed me with his performance). Unfortunately, Flap accepting a job in Nebraska ruins their chance of a true relationship. Soon, Aurora realizes that even though Garret has made her happy, she can't be with him. And to make matters worse, Emma has cancer. Everything culminates in a touching, heartwrenching finale (including MacLaine's famous ""give my daughter the shot!"" sequence) that will stay with you forever.

This is truly a movie that has stood the test of time. This film set the vanguard for tearjerkers, and with the exception of ""Steel Magnolias"", no film has ever matched this film (not even the 1996 sequel ""The Evening Star""). Truly, this is one film that has earned the title ""must-see"".",1122076800,3,2003,4.905604719764011
233814,5,6300214117,"Larry McMurty's novel has been adapted to the screen amazingly well; the film won five Academy Awards, including the Best Adapted Screenplay Award, as well as Best Picture, Best Actress (Shirley MacLaine), Best Director (James Brooks), and Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson). The cast includes a wealth of Hollywood celebrities -- Debra Winger, John Lithgow, Jeff Daniels, Danny DeVito -- and the performances are outstanding throughout the film.

The story is one of a mother, Aurora Greenway, (Shirley MacLaine) and her daughter, Emma (Debra Winger), and how their relationship develops over the years, from the day that their husband/father dies. Aurora is a woman with more than her share of admirers, whom she takes great delight in keeping at a distance, and who has a rather contentious relationship with her daughter, whose marriage to Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels) she opposes to the point that she boycotts the wedding. As it turns out, Mother is right. The marriage between Emma and Flap is less than rosy, with both having their extramarital affairs (although the extramarital affair that Emma has with Sam Burns, played by John Lithgow, comes across as endearing in the film). Almost parallel to the philandering of the daughter comes the pie-eyed former astronaut next door, Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson), who makes no pretenses about his intentions toward Aurora, and this time Aurora gives in. For the time that the affair lasts, Aurora is very happy. It has its run, then stops, but then starts again. Garrett, as it seems, has a problem with commitment, but he also has a problem with walking out on a good thing, too.

Flap comes home one day to break the bad news that the family is moving, thereby ending Emma's affair with Sam but continuing an affair that Flap was having. Emma discovers the affair and is indignant, but by now, Emma is also a mother and dying of a terminal illness. It becomes clear that Flap is not a candidate to care for the children after Emma dies, and Aurora re-enters the picture as the grand matriarch who will take over. When the moment of Emma's death arrives, the shock is still as painful as if nobody had expected it to happen. Garrett resurfaces to comfort the grieving Aurora and her family in a gesture that surprises Aurora greatly.

What really makes this film succeed is the vividness of the performances of the actors and actresses. Debra Winger's performance as the daughter who grows through a bad marriage and ultimately dies from cancer is unforgettable. Jack Nicholson's performance, as much as he has played the lecherous male before, takes on a new dimension in this film. Shirley MacLaine's performance earned her an Academy Award; she gives a superb touch in the most unforgettable scene in the film in which she approaches the nurses' station in the hospital at 10pm to tell the nurses to give her daughter her pain shot. As is very typical in all too many medical institutions, the nurses are preoccupied with their internal bureaucracy and not with relieving the suffering of the patients. That is enough to make her go ballistic; she starts to run around the station, screaming at the top of her lungs. The histrionics add both an intensely personal and yet somewhat comical touch to a poignant part of the film in a way that is amazingly effective.

This is a film that is definitely not to be missed.",1113523200,3,3382,4.8765217391304345

But before she disappeared from Hollywood she proved that she was, among other things, one hell of a good actress. In ?Terms of Endearment? she plays Emma, a newlywed, stricken with cancer and forced to grapple with the antics of her philandering husband, Flap (Jeff Daniels). The film is a potpourri of finely wrought performances and it really gets to the heart of the oddly confrontational relationship between a mother and daughter. On this occasion Emma?s mother, Aurora Greenwood is played by Shirley MacLaine. As the grieving, scheming, ultra-concerned, overly protective and manipulative mother, MacLaine is superb. It's really no wonder or surprise that she took home the Oscar for this performance. Jack Nicholson costars as has been astronaut, Garrett Breedlove, known more for his roving eye and noncommittal, devil-may-care attitude toward the ladies than his prowess in the cockpit. His love/hate stance with Aurora blossoms into a genuinely poignant relationship as the film progresses. Danny Devito also appears in a cameo as one of Aurora?s potential suitors.
Paramount Home Video has issued this movie in anamorphic widescreen. Colors are well balanced, though details get lost in darker scenes.

TERMS OF ENDEARMENT is an acting feast, boasting stellar performances from Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger (as unlikely a biological mother/daughter combo as you can imagine, but hey, this is the movies).  Jack Nicholoson does his thing as your typical astronaut-next door, and is effective, although it's a bit surprising that he walked off with an Oscar for what was, for him, pretty much a walk-through.  John Lithgow and a young Jeff Daniels don't have all that much to do either, although like Nicholson, they are, at least, true to form.  But this is one for the ladies, and it belongs to its two female leads.
I had a chuckle when I read Amazon's Tom Keough's review posted above.  ""Lumpy"" is not a bad term for this film.  It's really another one of those Hollywood adaptations, where you just know the book had to be better, even if you've never read the book.  Everything here is just a little too rushed, a little too sketchy.  You know time's flying because different child actors keep cropping up, playing the same roles at different ages.  There seems to be an inordinate haste to get to the meat of the drama, which is, of course, the illness and death of Debra Winger's character.
Overall, a better and more authentic weep-fest than, say, BEACHES or LOVE STORY.  Not quite as powerful a family drama as, say, the similarly themed ORDINARY PEOPLE, however.  Well worth seeing, if like me, you've somehow missed it all these years.  If nothing else, you can learn a great deal about the actor's craft from watching two truly great actresses.",1042329600,,1638,4.685314685314685
233917,4,6300214117,"1983's Terms Of Endearment is based on a novel by Larry McMurtry, the man who also wrote Lonesome Dove and The Last Picture Show.  Much like most of Mr. McMurtry's stories, the film takes place in Texas.  It centers around the tumultuous relationship between Aurora & Emma Greenway, who are mother and daughter.  Aurora is played with a spitfire essence by Shirley MacLaine and Emma is played by Debra Winger.  Aurora is a bit overprotective of Emma and this leads to the relationship strains especially when Emma marries Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels).  The two drift apart and Aurora starts up an unusual romance with her ex-astronaut next door neighbor, Garrett Breedlove (Jack Nicholson).  The scenes between Aurora and Garrett are the best in the film and both Ms. MacLaine and Mr. Nicholson are brilliant in them.  The movie teeters on the brink of sappiness at the end as it digresses into a complete tear-jerker as Emma develops a terminal illness.  But despite that, director James L. Brooks has crafted an enjoyable film that will make you both laugh and cry.  The film swept the 1983 Oscars as it won Best Picture, Best Director & Screenplay for Mr. Brooks, Ms. MacLaine beat out Ms. Winger for Best Actress and Mr. Nicholson took home his second Oscar and first in the Best Supporting Actor category.",1041897600,8,1308,4.829596412556054
233918,4,6300214117,"As cliched as my title sounds, those sentiments are appropriate to this movie.  ""Terms of Endearment"" won five Oscars back in the early eighties, and this movie will easily show you why.
The story spans many years of the life of a mother and daughter.  From the beginning you can tell that Shirley MacLaine's character is a bit eccentric, but we never quite understand how.  You can tell that she loves her daughter and wants only the best.  She does, however, disapprove of her daughter's choice of husband.
This is where the chief divide in the relationship lies.  The rift does not separate them, but this gap does provide distance, which allows them to continue to grow as characters.  Illness will bring them together.
I love Debra Winger's work, and I think her character here is well done.  My hat is off though to Shirley MacLaine and Jack Nicholson.  Both gave a lot of life to their characters and keep me engaged in their life.  This is a fine display of acting talent.
I would recommend watching this movie.  It is at time laugh-out-loud funny, and at others, tenderly sad.",1034640000,,1085,4.663157894736842
233919,5,6300214117,"TERMS OF ENDEARMENT explores the rocky relationship between a mother and her daughter. While they may drift away, their bond is forever and will always bring them back to each other. This is definately a tearjerker which will make you cry, and tug at your heartstrings. Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger turn in an excellent performance in this touching movie about family, heartbreak, and loss. The movie is a realistic portrayal of family life, and how things don't always run smoothly. Without giving away any of the details, this movie is very touching because its such a realistic portrayal, and it explores the roots between a mother and her child. Overall this is a must see movie, and if you enjoy these types of movies you will love this movie, and its sequel titled THE EVENING STAR.",1017446400,,793,4.795620437956204

But Terms of Endearment is definately my favorite!  It is a wonderfully acted, wonderfully written movie about a mother/daughter relationship...and the ups and downs that relationship endures during relationships with other people. I love this movie! I watch it every time I get the chance.  I highly recommend renting or buying this movie to someone who enjoys sappy movies that tug on the heart strings!",1014854400,,573,4.533980582524272
233921,5,6300214117,"I watched this film quite some time ago, when it first came out on video. And I looooooooved it. The actors are no bomb shells, but real people living real lives, juggling problems a lot of people are dealing with these days. The movie is funny (think about Shirley and Jack going for a ride in his Corvette... or Debra giving her flame a photo to remember her by - showing her pregnant and not made up at all...), sad (""cancer"" says it all...). Sure, the characters are somewhat overdrawn, but that's what it takes to get the audience going. Like I stated before - I loved the movie and still consider it one of the best films I have ever seen. Watch it and make up your own mind. Don't be turned off when other reviews describe Debra as being so slobby, they were happy to see her die... She wasn't meant to look like a barbie doll and I am glad, she didn't. Judge for yourself!",1010016000,2,880,4.244047619047619
233922,5,6300214117,This is a great movie. Similar experience went on in my family which made this a very memorable movie.  I was 10 when I saw this movie and still remember what effects I had watching this film.  Jack Nicholson and Shirley MacLaine were great.

234003,4,6300214117,"This film deals with the subject matter normally associated with mini series. Three generations of a family in times of happiness and sadness. Despite this, and despite its length, it is entertaining and attention-holding throughout. Shirley MacLaine gives a wonderful performance of a frosty divorcee/widow (it's never made quite clear) who thaws on meeting the charming neighbour Jack Nicholson. Jack plays his usual character, but as always, he does it so well that you forgive him for it. Shirley wears some truly hideous frocks and has some appalling hairstyles, but her smile manages to shine through all of this towards the end of the film. The strong ensemble cast is completed by Debra Winger and Jeff Daniels who play their parts to perfection, but these are not as detailed as MacLaine's Aurora, and maybe the film would have benefited from concentrating on one character. Having said that, the cutting between mother and daughter enables the film-makers to show us both sides of their relationship. The cryptic title keeps you thinking throughout the film, but the music occasionally stops you thinking and is over the top in places. You should be warned that this is an especially sad film, so don't watch it if you get too upset by this sort of thing.",1001289600,,1265,4.971698113207547
234004,5,6300214117,"Terms Of Endearment is, funny, sad, and heartbreaking. It's the story of a relationship of a mother and daughter that goes through ups and downs during the course of a few years. One of the things that makes this movie work is how real it is. This is real life. There's nothing more real than that. This can be anybody's mother and daughter. It could be you. Shirley MacLaine gives one of cinema's most memorable and brilliant portrayols as Aurora Greenway, who is one of movieland's greatest characters. She is so perfect, she deserved ten more Oscars just for the hell of it. Debra Winger, as the daughter, is good as well. She really brings her character to life. And there's Jack Nicholson. Nobody is better than Jack. His performance, like Shirley's, is also one of Hollywood's best classics. It's a role where Jack gets to shine brighter than ever. There are many classic scenes and lines in this film. That doesn't happen often. The remaining cast is brilliant: Jeff Daniels, John Lithgow, and Danny DeVito. What an electrifying cast. Watch this movie. And, oh, by the way, grab a hankie. A film classic.",999820800,,1111,4.731958762886598

234006,5,6300214117,"This movie is widely disparaged as one of the less-worthy Best Picture winners, yet it is so great. Comparing ""Terms"" with flicks like ""English Patient"" or ""American Beauty"" is an insult.  ""Terms"" feels like life, unlike ""American Beauty,"" which featured no characters I recognize in reality.  I first saw this movie when I was 19 years old, and I wondered if it could still affect me emotionally after many years and several viewings.  The answer is ""YES!""  Although it is manipulative, it is the rare movie that evokes both laughter and tears.  The supposed ""tear-jerkers"" of recent years have been, without exception, terribly lame.  Do yourself a favor and see this (again) whenever you're in the mood for a cry.",997747200,,716,4.925

However, director Brooks and his cohorts running commentary leave much to be desired.  One gets the impression from their babbling that they haven't seen the flick in fifteen years plus.  Compared to the excellence of director Chris Columbus commentary on Mrs. Doubfire, Terms is sorely lacking.  I am disappointed.",989798400,,479,5.089743589743589
234008,5,6300214117,"I loved Terms the first time I saw it in a theatre, and still love it today - I've watched it over and over through the years.  I first met Emma and Flap in Larry McMurty's extremely long novel, ""Moving On"" and was pleased to learn more about these two interesting characters. Everyone knows the plot, the superb performances all round, the tragic ending.  I wanted to call attention to two scenes, one being the most heart-warming love scene I've ever seen, and the other, the last few moments.
When the usually overdone, perfect Aurora walks into the Nebraska motel after being with Emma, Aurora with her black roots capping her blond hair, make-up shot, shlepping along, and you hear Jack Nicholson (Garrett) say, ""Aurora!"", she looks up the motel stairs and there he stands, the cad, his tummy barely diguised by his black sweater, with his face full of love and compassion, and they meet on the stairs, they embrace, Aurora's nose is running, and she says ""And who thought you'd turn out to be a nice guy?""  Of course, the theme music adds its special magic, and corny, yeah - and I JUST LOVE IT.  And then, just before THE END, the scene between Garrett and Emma's oldest, troubled son dressed in his church suit.  I used to have that scene memorized word for word - I thought it just perfect.  As I've worn out a Beta tape and a VHS tape, maybe I'll invest in a DVD.  This film just touches every emotion.",988329600,2,1412,4.4921875
234009,5,6300214117,"Another film that made me cry! If you've read my reviews on KRAMER VS. KRAMER and RAIN MAN, then you know my story. But, yes, it's happened again! Another Best Picture Oscar-winner has allowed me to shed my tears freely and openly.
Based on the novel by Larry McMurtry (Lonesome Dove, The Last Picture Show), TERMS OF ENDEARMENT is a ""family"" film that deals with a 30-year relationship between a flighty mother and her headstrong daughter, played to perfection by Shirley MacLaine as Aurora Greenway, and Debra Winger as her daughter Emma Horton. The film begins by establishing the relatonship between the neurotic Aurora with her young daughter.
It makes you laugh and it makes you cry! Either way, the film deserves its kudos. Created by future SIMPSONS producer James L. Brooks, we see the emotional turmoil that both Aurora and Emma face in their love lives.
The cast consists of: Jack Nicholson, as Aurora's zany cosmonaut boyfriend Garrett Breedlove (a role originally intended for Burt Reynolds [YIKES!]), Jeff Daniels as Emma's philandering husband Flap Horton, John Lithgow as Emma's lover Sam Burns, and Danny DeVito, in a delightful cameo, as Vernon Dahlart.
After a while, though, the film does tend to drift a bit. You have to be patient considering that the final climax, in which Emma loses her fight with cancer, is the blow that sent me (and possibly millions of other viewers) into tears. Watch Aurora's face; watch Emma's, and you'll know exactly what they're saying without them even saying a word. Simply devastating!
Winner of 5 Academy Awards including: three for director Brooks for Best Picture (as producer), Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay; Best Actress - Shirley MacLaine (also nominated against costar Debra Winger); and Best Supporting Actor - Jack Nicholson (nominated against costar John Lithgow).
All in all, in a year (1983) where TERMS was up against THE RIGHT STUFF, THE BIG CHILL, THE DRESSER, SILKWOOD, EDUCATING RITA, and FANNY AND ALEXANDER, TERMS OF ENDEARMENT proved that even a ""soap opera"" film can be the best! So true.",988329600,32,2077,5.040697674418604
234010,2,6300214117,"and not a very lucid one, at that.  *Terms of Endearment*'s biggest problem, I think, is that it somehow misses the point:  rather than delving into an intensive character-study of a mother-daughter relationship -- which is, presumably, what the movie's supposed to be about -- we're given a chronicle of the mother's and daughter's OTHER relationships, particularly with the men in their lives.  It's not altogether clear if we're supposed to compare and contrast MacLaine's and Winger's separate stories  (and that indeed is what this movie is:  mother and daughter share surprisingly little screen-time), especially since those stories seem to have little to do with each other.  In any event, it all comes across just a tad soap-opera-ish for my taste.
I do agree with the reviewer below who observed that MacLaine's and Nicholson's romance seems to be played strictly for laughs.  It's the equivalent of the old pie-in-the-face routine, and it starts to wear after the first hour.
Finally, the look of the movie is extraordinarily ugly.  It's as if director James L. Brooks and his cinematographer couldn't afford new film stock, or something.  It reminds me of those ghastly-looking Altman pictures, particularly  *McCabe & Mrs. Miller*.  *Terms of Endearment*, made in 1983, looks much older than that, and the digital clean-up on the DVD didn't improve its appearance.
I know people love this movie, and my opinion is just that:  opinion.  Well, here's another one:  if you want to see a great film from this director, look no further than  *Broadcast News*, a much more sophisticated film than this first -- and soapiest -- effort.",980899200,11,1640,5.089887640449438
234011,5,6300214117,"This movie is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen.  Debra Winger, Shirley MacLaine, and Jack Nicholson all give the performances of their careers in this film.  It is a wonderful story that reaches into your heart.  This movie will make you laugh, cry, pout, and most of all it will make you appreciate the great things that life offers us each day.  I hardly ever cry at movies, but this one did me in.  I totally recommend this movie to anyone.",975369600,3,451,4.385542168674699
234012,1,6300214117,"I really hate to do this to a movie that so many people love, but I just really thought that this movie was a stinker.  The acting was very good but somehow the plot just wasn't there.
It was supposed to be emotional but it just made me feel like I had been manipulated from the word go.  And, yes, I am a guy, but that isn't why I disliked this movie.  I didn't regret a minute I spent watching Gone With the Wind and if ever there was a girly movie, GWtW is it.  By the way, my mother also disliked this movie.  It just stunk.
Jack Nicholson singlehandedly pulls this movie out of the muck and mire and makes it worth fast forwarding through just for the ""date"" and beach scene.  I laughed until my stomach hurt.  Nicholson is so funny.
All in all, I didn't want to spend quite so much time on a sweeping epic of white trash.  I couldn't align with anyone in this movie, although Danny DeVito gets off the funniest line.  So if you watch this movie, which you will and should just for Jack Nicholson, and don't like it, you are not alone.

234103,4,6300214117,"I first saw ""Terms of Endearment"" in the theater when it first came out at Christmas 1983 and thought it was an very good picture.  Then,saw it several years later on home video and I still think so. I even  gave a copy of the video to my sister for a birthday present(along with  some other of her favorite movies).  A lot of the credit should go to James  L. Brooks who was the writer and director. Mr. Brooks was a writer on  ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" in the '70's and wrote the enjoyable  movie ""Starting Over"" in 1979.
  Shirley MacLaine stars as  Aurora and Debra Winger is her daughter Emma and the story is about their  relationship over many years. The two leads both gave fabulous performances.  Ms. MacLaine won the Academy Award for Best Actress(her one and only win)  and Ms. Winger was nominated. Jack Nicholson gave a very funny,likable performance as the former astronaut who lives next door to Aurora.  Nicholson won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this role(a role that Burt Reynolds turned down due to a prior commitment. Reynolds regretted it later because the movie he turned the role down for turned out  to be a flop).Actors John Lithgow and a then unknown Jeff Daniels also give  good performances in supporting roles.
  However, the real kudos go to  James L.Brooks who won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay  Adaptation(from the novel by Larry McMurtry)and for Best Director,very  impressive since this was his directorial debut. And,it also won Best  Picture of the year. The story has many funny moments,sad moments,and  intense moments,just like in real life. Mr. Brooks went on to write and  direct ""Broadcast News"" in 1987 and ""As Good As It  Gets"" in 1997 which were both very good pictures also.""Terms of Endearment"" is a good chick flick.",966297600,19,1793,4.7435064935064934
234104,5,6300214117,"This is the perfect representaion of the emotions that run through a lifetime.  Larry McMurtry is quite the creative wizard, without whom there would be no basis for such a touching piece of film.  Emma has her moments  in life...those moments would make any one of us lose control.  With the  strength she finds within and that which she has acquired from her mother,  it is no wonder she can get through an adulterous hubby, a son hit with an  ""I hate my mom"" phase, a telephone dependant mother, a life of  constant uprooting, and cancer.  I could not fathom going through all of  that all at once.  This movie gives me hope.  This movie shows me how much  I take for grnted...how much I need not do that anymore.  Mrs. Greenway has  her own problems with Emma, aging, and her astronaut neighbor.  The chain  of events helps her, in the end, to cope with her daughter's fate.  Garret,  the neighbor, is a refreshing perk among all else that goes on in this  funny, sad, and just plain endearing tapestry.  This is a classic and  timeless story that is often used while referencing or explaining something  else.  If you haven't seen it, do so.  If you have, see it again...for each  time I watch it I learn something new...a feeling that I never knew I am  capable of feeling.",954201600,2,1279,4.471615720524017
234105,5,6300214117,"James Brooks, who of late gave us AS GOOD AS IT GETS, has an uncanny way of sketching characters that are believable, and completely winning, despite their many foibles.  TERMS is filled with such people, and is so  deft at winning your affections that it is virtually impossible not to feel  that lump in your throat -- if not tears rolling down your cheek -- as it  makes its way to its manipulative but moving nonetheless finale.  Each  performer works to his/her potential, and the supposed fireworks between  Debra Winger (who inhabits her role so intensely she IS Emma) and Shirley  MacLaine -- who won an Oscar -- works perfectly on screen.  Jeff Daniels  pulls off a neat trick, and manages to be both reprehensible as Emma's  multi-flawed husband, but also engenders your sympathy vote as the movie  wears on.  Jack Nicholson (also Oscar winner) and MacLaine combatively  explore one of the funniest romances ever; the screenplay's distinctive  sense of humor adds much charm and much needed comic relief from the  increasingly depressing proceedings.  Michael Gore's already-classic theme  music can still inspire tears and resound with humanity.  This movie feels  absolutely commercial, and twists your heart in way that few movies do --  we are talking majorly sad sad sad -- AS BAD AS IT GETS, so to speak.  Yet,  in the final moments, Brooks does give the movie a sweet and surprising  lift, and nearly promises hope to these characters, most of whom we have  grown to love.",945648000,,1489,4.883534136546185
