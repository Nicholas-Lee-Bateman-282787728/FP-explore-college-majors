8237401,5,B00106K5FS,"Delightful, quite funny mockumentary in the vein of Christopher Guest, especially Waiting For Guffman. If this isn't quite as surreally inventive or hysterically funny as that modern classic, it makes up for it with a great sense of good cheer, a dose of humanity between all the absurdity, and a terrific lead performance from Ben Miller as a deeply self-delusional dance teacher.

Its all about dance school competitions between different groups of pre-adolescent girls. Miller plays Mr. Jonathon, who not only desperately wants to finally win, but also to make political statements by staging dances based on issues like the Kyoto Climate Protocols. This leads to some extremely funny sequences as we see these little girls dancing about some of the most un-danceable concepts imaginable. The dialogue is witty, the supporting performances generally very strong (the one weakness is that some of the supporting types lampooned are a bit too familiar and easy targets), and the choreography is great - just off enough to be extremely amusing.

I was very glad I took a chance on this.",1453852800,,1086,5.129943502824859
