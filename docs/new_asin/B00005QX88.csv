1651912,5,B00005QX88,"This film arrived very quickly. I enjoyed all of the movies on the Holiday Four Film Collector's Set. Surprisingly, it was A HOBO'S CHRISTMAS which I enjoyed the most. I have quite a collection now of Christmas films, most of which I have ordered through Amazon.com. My thanks to the seller and to Amazon.com.",1361491200,,309,4.7407407407407405

I liked that there were 4 stories on one dvd.
It arrived quickly and was well packaged.",1354752000,,116,4.086956521739131
1651914,5,B00005QX88,Bought this for Christmas Wonderland only.  Got 3 other movies with it for the same price people were charging for the single movie.  The other movies are not half bad either.  Kids will enjoy Winter Wonderland while the others are geared more for adults.,1331856000,,255,4.75
1651915,5,B00005QX88,"I have loved ""Borrowed Hearts"" for years, we use to watch the ""taped off the tv on vhs version"" with all the commercials & all every Christmas, so we were thrilled to find it on dvd! We watched ""The Man Who Saved Christmas"" and liked that very much as well, that's why we bought a few more copies  to give as gifts! We haven't yet watched the other 2 movies included on these discs. I would highly recommend this set even just for the 2 movies  I've mentioned! The product came quickly and was in perfect condition upon its arrival! Enjoy!",1326412800,2,539,4.326732673267327
1651916,5,B00005QX88,"These four films are great fun...not the finest ever made, or the worst either, but full of Christmas spirit and, I believe, well worth watching. They warm the heart and have some fine acting included as a bonus (the price is certainly right!). I thoroughly enjoyed them.
By the way, the bonus CD was a pleasant surprise, It is a fine selection of Christmas music, and in my opinion, worth the full price by itself.",1292284800,27,415,4.546666666666667
1651917,1,B00005QX88,"I loved all of these movies when shown on TV. However, Echo Bridge Home Entertainment does not offer closed captioning nor sub-titles on these Christmas delights. That includes not only this edition, but other 4 in 1 Christmas movies they offer. A poor choice for someone like me, who is hard-of-hearing.",1292112000,15,304,4.980392156862745

1651924,5,B00005QX88,"This is a great collection of two-part episodes from the series.  Each episode has Walker, Trivette and Alex working to solve crimes in the Dallas/Forth Worth area.  War Zone deals with clown bank robbers who kill one of the rangers and the leader of the gang is someone who no one would believe could be responsible for the crime wave.  Flashback brings the past to the present when money from a bank robbery is found by an old man.  A famous Texas Ranger is believed to have stolen the money for himself and accused of the theft of the treasure.  Present day bank robbers look for the treasure and find it while Walker goes after them is injured and hospitalized.  Trivette goes after the robbers alone and Walker leaves the hospital to help find the robbers.  In the end Walker and Trivette find the treasure has disappeared and the ranger is exonerated from guilt and the wrong is put right after so many years.  Standoff has a assassin who is after a Mexican politician where Walker has to deal with a madman would is almost as dangerous as Walker is.  The end is a surprise as to the assassin's target and who he is really after.  Whitewater has Walker badly wounded and put on medical leave.  Alex, Trivette and C.D. trick him into going on a rapids trip.  While Walker and Alex are rafting, Trivette finds out that an escaped convict is loose and Walker is in danger.  Trivette and C.D. go down to water country to find him with a helicopter and flying down the rapids searching for the group.  In the end Walker is glad that he went on the trip and has the opportunity to stop the escaped convict.  This is a must have for fans of the series.",1464739200,,1651,4.420529801324503

7951230,1,B00005QX88,"Should have checked the bad reviews first and I would have seen that these are NOT movies. They are just 2 part episodes from the original series. Luckily, my brother (who i bought these for) recognized the titles as episodes before he opened it. These will be going back as this is a HUGE misrepresentation. I assumed they were post series, made for TV type of movies, which is why I got them to go with the series I bought for my brother. He obviously doesn't need these since they are part of the series he already has.",1524614400,,522,4.336734693877551
