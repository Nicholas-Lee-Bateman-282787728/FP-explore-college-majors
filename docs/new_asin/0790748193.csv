114492,2,0790748193,"Was looking for something light hearted with beautiful scenery and excellent acting. This movie starts out interesting, evolves into a awkward love and blossoms into a second sudden tragedy.  The whole movie changed in the last two minutes leaving the viewers shocked and depressed.  Movie turned on a dime, like maybe they ran short of film, or had a budget cut!!!  Should have read some reviews before watching, but how could you go wrong with The cast???  Movie was good, but writers, producers and directors tend to be a little too full of themselves seeking to shock the audience!!!  If you want shock value...watch this or the news.  Not bad If you want a heart tearing drama, but If you want a relaxing movie to help sooth away the worries of the day...keep looking!!!",1515715200,,775,4.746268656716418

Why ruin a perfect movie by making it all seem a pointless waste by leaving a new person with a broken heart all alone and back at square one.  We see enough crappy realism in LIFE, I don't want to watch a whole great movie just to turn it off near the end.  And who wants to buy a movie for a huge let down,  NO ONE!!  I want to believe in the happy ever after fantasy that perfect romance movies all give you, even if its  typical or expected.  If you want a different ending why not have them film a new alternate HAPPY ENDING with pro make-up making them look way older with teenaged kids enjoying the cruise as Mom and Dad hug and kiss of just hug and look into each others eyes and say something grand,,,,, Or they take a picture, calling the kids to gather 'round and He (Kevin C,) rolls up the Insta-matic picture into a bottle, hands it over saying ""Here's How you found us, would you do the Honor?""  and She wings it into the Sea!

114500,1,0790748193,"Review of Message in a Bottle
Hot Toasty Rag, June 18, 2017

Message in a Bottle was Nicholas Sparkss first big hit. That sentence alone will probably steer you towards or away from this movie.

As you can probably guess by the title, a woman finds a love letter in a bottle, washed ashore. She is deeply moved by the mans words and tries to track him down. Miraculouslybecause, in all likelihood the letter was probably written decades and decades ago and she would never be able to find the authorshe finds him! And even more miraculously, hes single and attractive. And just in case that wasn't convenient and cheesy enough for you, hes sensitive and burying his grief over his dead wife. Gee, do you think the woman who found his Message in a Bottle might help him learn to love again?

Obviously, I didn't like this movie. If you're a Nicholas Sparks fan and like stinky, cheesy romances, go ahead and rent it. But if you like a little more realism and a little less saccharine in your love stories, heed my warning. Also, I don't find it funny when former heartthrobs are placed in old man roles in which half their dialogue consists of referencing their age and infirmity. If you feel the same way, you won't want to see Paul Newman as the stereotypical lets laugh at the old man character.",1497744000,,1297,4.51063829787234

114523,5,0790748193,"One of the most powerful ""messages"" about what very few of us can experience, by the depth of the gripping, yet fearful nature of being in love. For those who have the love presented by the cast & script, consider yourselves fortunate.  First time I saw this movie, I was very much impressed, but last night's viewing of this movie, took on a greater meaning.  Why?  because Robin Wright (formerly Ms. Sean Penn) has been through some real life struggles.  Read her bio in recent film pay discrepancy in House of Cards.",1495238400,,519,4.608695652173913

114528,3,0790748193,"As a writer, I'm a little bit jaded when it comes to watching movies.  As I watch them, I can't help but constantly be aware that the story I am watching was sculpted by another person.  The movies that I always fall in love with the most are the ones that take me out of that diagnostic attitude.  They are the ones that are so engrossing that I forget about analyzing what I am watching and I just enjoy the experience.

I wanted to like this movie...a lot.  I had a lot of hope for it.  It left me feeling kind of angry at the end, though.

The set up of the movie was wonderful.  It's a great premise and Robin Wright Penn is so beautiful, it's hard to not be anything but appreciative just for the chance to watch her up on the screen.  I really wanted a happy ending though.  The guy's life had been so hard, it would have been nice to see things work out for them...and the reasons why it all fell apart in the end seemed kind of odd and abrupt...no foreshadowing at all.  In the end it just felt I was watching a story that someone wrote who wanted me to feel sad and I wasn't engrossed in it anymore.  I wanted to give it 3.5 stars...but they don't so that here, so three is all I can give.  Had they fixed the last half hour, it very easily could have been 5 stars.  Too bad.  I really was hoping it would have been better.",1492473600,,1364,4.018587360594796

114531,1,0790748193,"1. Theresa needs to go back to acting school
2. There's something about watching old people making out that doesn't leave me with a good feeling
3. We spend such a long time watching him try to let go of Catherine and then when he finally does he dies....
4. Theresa was desperate
5. I legit thought it was going to turn into a paranormal activity movie when he ""only wrote 2 letters"" that scene was over dramatic and extremely weird
6. After watching that movie I was creeped out and had to have my mother tuck me in like I was two
7. I might recommend this movie to one of my enemies
8. I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks' movies and books but I had never heard of message in a bottle.... It's no wonder why I hadn't
9. This story line could have actually been put to use in a horror film but not in a romance
10. Kev seemed like the loss of Catherine was a disease that was eating at his brain and he couldn't do anything but be serious and act like he needed a mentor
11. The romance scenes were akward
12. Why in the hell does Theresa not like chocolates
13. Maybe they can be mentally challenged together... Oh wait he died....His death scene was so overdramatic and corny....
14. What was up with the tension at that stupid restaurant. Remind me never to go to that restaurant
15. I wish I could turn back time and do my homework
16. I wish someone would have sent me a message in a bottle warning me to not watch this movie",1490227200,,1431,4.114285714285714

Soulful, romantic, gorgeous movie.  The story will pull you in immediately and keep you in its grip until the final moment when the screen fades to black.  The accompanying musical score is poignant and nostalgic.  This Nicholas Sparks movie touched me in such a way that I was left breathless while sitting through the credits.

Robin Wright Penn and Kevin Costner have incredibly believable chemistry.  I felt every aching moment when they were apart and all the warmth of their love when they were together.  Their love deepens like a dream come true for all of us romantics out here.  Even the devastating heartache, due to an heroic act, doesn't take away from the romance or the beauty of this drama.  Would that I could know such a love as depicted in this amazing story.

This movie ranks right up there with Nights In Rodanthe and The Notebook (two other Nicholas Sparks gems).  If you haven't seen either of those, be sure to order them as well.",1426204800,5,1202,4.534883720930233

What an assignment!  Even the ""jocks"" will get involved!!!  And then, there is the written story written by Nicholas Sparks to accompany the video.

114956,3,0790748193,"It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't as good as some other Nicholas Sparks films either. I loved the performances by Robin Wright and Paul Newman; those two saved this film from a dismal one or two stars. Kevin Costner's affect is just so flat; he's such a one-dimensional actor. He kept pulling me out of the scenes with his cardboard acting, so the movie felt choppy and awkward for me. I love the idea of the story though - a man writes letters to his dead wife, helping him resolve his grief and emotional upheaval, and sends them in bottles out to the sea. I believe it would have been so much better with nearly anyone else but Kevin Costner.

On a technical note, I was very frustrated with the subtitles/closed captioning on this streaming video. I needed to see them, but they wouldn't stay up on the screen. The only way I could get the words to show up at all was if I rewound it. In rewinding, it would show the subtitles for about 3 lines of dialog and then disappear again. So I'd have to rewind again, just to catch what was said. This makes for a VERY long movie, even if it weren't boring to begin with. Why were the subtitles so erratic and unreliable?",1408406400,,1167,4.328767123287672

115121,5,0790748193,Kevin Costner is most realistic in this movie; as he is in most of his other movies. His movies are my favorites,1389225600,,112,4.136363636363637
115122,5,0790748193,I've seen this movie before. And I will probably watch it again. It's such a beautiful love story both his late wife and new person. Cried at the end.,1389139200,,150,4.206896551724138

115140,4,0790748193,"There are just some movies that you want to watch every year. This is one of them for me. Romance, heartbreak, lying, regret, hope, forgiveness, and moving on with your life after you've lost a loved one. Some of Costner's movies haven't been blockbusters, but this one, which also features Paul Newman as his father, is worth the time investment when you want to kick back for awhile.",1387152000,,385,4.676470588235294
115141,5,0790748193,I think this is one of Kevin Costner's best movie. Excellent cast with Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman as the dad. Great story. Based on a Nicholas Sparks novel which are always great. It's a tear jerker.,1387065600,,206,4.447368421052632

115143,5,0790748193,This is my favorite Kevin Costner movie . Nicholas Sparks books are great and who better than the handsome Costner to play the lead . Romantic,1385942400,,142,4.5
115144,3,0790748193,"In all fairness the film was pretty good, however I would have little respect for a woman who was so dis-honest right from the start. Costner was kinda goofy and Teresa was not a person who really cared for anyone but herself, like most woman. Neman  was cool though, always is!!!!!",1385856000,,282,4.529411764705882

115152,5,0790748193,"I bought this for my husband because he has always loved this movie and watches it over and over. Too bad it wasn't in blu ray, but that's because it is an older movie.",1383264000,,168,3.9705882352941178

115154,3,0790748193,"A woman who works for a Chicago newspaper finds a bottle washed up on a beach, with a love letter inside, and uses her paper's investigative department to analyze the bottle, the paper, the kind of typewriter that was used, and where the person who wrote that letter might live. Of course, she finds him, falls in love and we have some lovely scenes of sailing under canvas and living under the burden of remembering his first wife. Kevin Costner is the guy, and the reporter is Robin Wright . . . both suitable for their roles, but nothing remarkable here. Paul Newman is passable as the sailor's father . . . and the screenplay, which slowly withers, resorts to a death at sea. And while a tragic ending sometimes works, here it is neither fulfilling nor necessary. It is merely the ending to a long series of unlikely events, which ultimately rings hollow.",1383091200,,859,4.584415584415584
115155,5,0790748193,Message in a Bottle is a very good movie the book is fabulous as well. This is one of the few movies that I would put into a favorite list any day of the week.

115173,2,0790748193,I really don't understand why they allow such terrible endings to make it into movies.  I enjoyed a lot about this movie but overall it is beyond sad - unnecessarily sad!

The possibility that there could be three bottles tossed into the water and she found ALL THREE of them, is already a 1 chance in 10,000,000,000.  Then, with 100's of search/rescue teams, they couldn't find ONE man.  That just left me feeling disappointed at the end.  Not sad.  I enjoyed the acting.",1381968000,,422,4.56

You were a ship builder in this one. Which means hot with ""large"" muscles not ""lard"" muscles--maybe something got lost in translation in the directors notes). Sheeeesh.

Honestly, I wasn't impressed. Paul Newman was the only good thing about this movie, actually. The movie doesn't build any type of personal connection between the audience and the main characters, and neither of the main characters seem to really say anything that enthralling or particularly deep throughout the entire movie. There are scenes in which the movie makers TRY to make the movie emotionally powerful but fail. The relationship between Garret and Theresa doesn't seem to build over time - one second they don't know each other and the next second they're having a five hour long dinner and canoodling in bed. And if I see Theresa laugh cutely one more time I'm probably going to lose it. And it is BORING. Less than halfway through the movie, I lost interest and gave myself a pedicure, and I didn't feel that I missed much of anything when I started paying attention again. Also, the special effects in this movie are SO BAD! I don't know why I'm even bothering to give this three stars - possibly out of pity.

A good lesson here is to not dwell too long on the past. It takes more guts to try to love again than it does to throw in the towel. The trick is to know when the possibility of love is staring you right in the face - funny because it's the heart that love stares into.

Paul Newman is the older father of widowed Kevin Costner, who can't give up the love of his deceased wife. She apparently was very ill and committed suicide by going out into the weather and dying. The first note was Kevin's confession of his eternal love, but when a second note turned up, unknown to Kevin, it was from his deceased wife. He finds out that he has fallen in love, reluctantly with the reporter and feels like she has invaded an area too touchy when he learns that she was on a quest for a story. She gives up that she was interested in writing a story after she herself falls in love with Kevin.

She found this ""gruff"" and hurt man who had lost his wife and was throwing messages into the ocean.

Later whe the young writer found out the he was dedicating a boat he had built in honor of his wife, she went to watch and celebrate with him. He did not see her there and he set sail to go north. A storm came up suddenly and he saw another boat in distress with a family on it and went to help them out . He saved the father and child but the wife/mother dies and so did he.

There were times where background music was much needed to help pump some emotion into the scenes because there was quite the lack of it coming from the actors/actresses and then there were times where the music just blared out and caused more of a scene than the characters.

If what the writers and director wanted was inarticulate from Costner, they got it, in spades. Robert Wright Penn did well with the kind of part that normally would only be found in a comedy. Actually, the plot structure never had a chance since its fundamental  premise is comedy material not suitable for straight romance. From my point of view, the basic gimmick was unworkable for the kind of film they made. The basic premise: a researcher for the Chicago Tribune, finds a message in a bottle that touches her heart. Pursuing the search for more messages, two others were found. This leads her to Kevin Costner and Romance. There are various limbs to the trunk of the plot but none of them have much effervescence to them, mostly they fall flat. The film, however, may find favor with those for whom romance is the staff of film life. i should add, that a full two hours is a bit much for the content.",1324425600,,1018,4.44385026737968

115416,4,0790748193,"The one thing I abhor in a film is a story that builds emotional content, then allows the death of one of the main characters, destroying any hope of happiness. Yes, I know, such things are realistic and do happen, but give me happiness in my movies (or murder and mayhem). Don't allow me to invest in these other lives, waiting for the moment of connection only to see it crumble and crash.

Robin Wright plays Theresa, a researcher for a Chicago newspaper, and Kevin Costner is Garrett, a builder of sailboats (and, to me, the ""sexiest man alive,"" not that Ryan fellow). He's been widowed for three years, meets Theresa and is finally ready to move on--slowly. She has intentionally sought him out because she found his ""message in a bottle."" As a researcher, she is interested in the puzzle; as a woman, she is interested in the emotional investment this writer has apparently put into a life with this Catherine, the intended recipient of the message. Of course, what can you expect from a smaltzy movie--he is gorgeous and thoughtful and well, just perfect--and we know these men don't exist.

In no time, they have insinuated themselves into a possible relationship. He lives near a harbor, she in a big city. Maybe it'll work. But he's not quite ready. She's holding back because she hasn't told him about her research. Honesty in a relationship? Sure. Am I thinking it will work? I'm saying no--he will never leave the harbor to live anywhere else. What? She just got a promotion as a full-fledged writer for the paper (yeah, this is an old movie in a perfect world where newspapers can be held in one's hands, not on a mobile device). It looks like they are really going to get together.

But, darn (WARNING: big give-away, unless you are addicted to Nicholas Sparks), yep, ol' Garrett drowns trying to save a woman from drowning. He'd already saved the husband and child. Gone. Just like that. He was so excited, too, about future possibilities--a new life with a living woman instead of mourning the dead one. Gone.

Frankly, I don't appreciate a vicarious romance in a movie that ends like that with no satisfaction, no fading into the sunset, no promise of rich emotional fulfillment to come (or fights and divorce). (It reminds me of another movie with a similar ending:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nights-in-Rodanthe/dp/B0017ANB08/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nights in Rodanthe</a>&nbsp;with Gere and Lane, another Sparks story). Message in this bottle? You'll be heart-broken!

This is a story which becomes a bit difficult to review without giving away the plot, but I guess I could start by saying it is a serious romance. I don't wish to give away the ending, so this review has to be brief.

115443,2,0790748193,"This is a completely slushy movie which ought to be better.  It has all the ingredients, but falls short.  It may be that it is just too gussied up -- everything about it is picture postcardy and needed more roughness to really work.  It is all too beautiful. It swoops and swirls and the music swells and the sea is photogenic, and the viewer is distanced from the story accordingly.  Nevertheless, and in spite of what I just said, the best thing about it by far is Robin Wright Penn, who is completely gorgeous, and in one or two scenes is quite funny and charming (she needs way more of this kind of work). Kevin Costner has a pretty thankless task, and he gets no thanks -- he's dull, dull, dull.  His beach house is way sexier than he is -- many would kill for his house. The sex scenes between the two of them are not sexy:  there are two nice little scenes, one in a hotel, and one at her house in Chicago that suggest that something really human could have been made of their romance -- meanwhile the overt romance scenes are hopelessly dreary and contrived -- cuddling by a fire,  cute dumpings in the water, etc, etc, etc.  Please. The complicating factor in all this is that Paul Newman plays his father, and is far sexier than Costner.  The director obviously worried about this, so he deliberately put in a scene where Newman says how old he is, and that if he were a hundred years younger she would be in trouble.  In spite of this, there is a moment when one thinks that Paul and Robin should get together, now that the son is drowned.....

There is a mythological undercurrent to the story which also makes one suspect that the sweet young first wife drowns her husband for taking up with another woman.  At least it is lovely to think so.",1249948800,,1756,4.352760736196319

The trail leads her to a sailboat builder named Garrett and also to his father, Dodge in a small North Carolina coastal town... It turns out that Catherine is Garret's deceased wife, and the intriguing letters were written, two years earlier, after her decease...

Some people find the one true love of their lives, if they're fortunate enough... Luis Mandoki's film, in part, turns out to be a choice about what occurs when a person finds that right kind of love, then when he is faced with the impossible, and then when he is given the right to continue with his life and is brave enough to love again no matter how unpleasant his grief is...

As a reclusive widower, Garret was still in deep pain, and entirely devoted to Catherine's memory... He had hard time letting go of the past... Catherine was dead but not forgotten and was simply everywhere...

As a sailor Costner didn't inherit the charm of Newman... He was drawn to Penn by her smile, her beauty, even her mistakes...

Robin Wright Penn was beautiful, delicate and sweet as Theresa... She soon insinuates her way into Garret's life... Her expectations were always too high... Since the beginning, she just had to meet the person that wrote those letters... Her life was changed by them... Eventually when she met Garret that morning, she accepted, without hesitation, to step aboard...

Paul Newman as Dodge liked Theresa instantly... He saw in her the key to his son's emotional recovery...

115462,5,0790748193,"""Message in the Bottle"" is, like the tag-line suggests, a tale of love lost and found.  The way I was introduced to this film is rather interesting, I suppose.  Many years ago I came across it when I was searching online for information regarding the 1977 classic Disney film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rescuers/dp/B000096IAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rescuers</a>.""  Both films share the theme of the ""message in the bottle"" so the connection lead me to this 1999 film.  Finally, I saw it for sale in a grocery store's bargain DVD bin and just had to bring it home with me, so I did.  I could not have been more pleased.  The film is touching in many ways, beautifully filmed, with fantastic characters and great acting.  It's a refreshing tale of love that does leave a bittersweet impact, and probably will not be forgotten easily.  It is also interesting that I found this film so captivating, because romance tales have never really been of interest to me.  Emily Bront's novel, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wuthering-Heights/dp/0140366946/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wuthering Heights</a>,"" was the first time I felt interested in a story of love, enough to keep me reading, very intrigued, through its hundreds of pages.  ""Message in a Bottle"" did the same thing, it intrigued me.  The gorgeously filmed sceneries automatically appealed to me; sights of lighthouses, docks and ships, ships out at sea, ocean waves, beautiful sunsets... not to forget the message in the bottle.  To me it was like watching one of Thomas Kinkade's paintings come to life right before my eyes; the sceneries in this film are that beautiful.

This is the story of a young woman named Theresa, who works for the Chicago Tribune.  She and her ex-husband had recently divorced and the two exchanged the time they would spend with their one son.  One day, during a visit to the shore, Theresa finds a simple bottle stranded on the sand and discovers inside it a message from a mysterious man addressed to a certain ""Dear Catherine.""  Theresa is touched by the profound love expressed by this person to their beloved, deceased wife, and so are her friends at work when they read it.  Theresa is not happy when her friends at the Chicago Tribune decide to publish the message in their newspaper, for she believes the person had meant the message to be personal and private.  Still, Theresa becomes intrigued with this man and longs to find him.  With a crew of investigators, she uses every clue she has, including a second and third message, to track down the author of these messages.  Her investigation leads her to a seaside town in North Carolina and a certain G. Blake.  She has high expectations of this man and quickly sets out to find him.  When she finally does, her expectations are exceeded, and she rapidly falls in love with grieving, timid Garret Blake.  She discovers the story behind his wife's death and the rivalry the event left behind for two different family's, Garret's and Catherine's.  Garret is unwilling to let go of the past and wants to conserve every memory he has of his deceased wife.  That is, until he himself slowly finds himself falling in love with Theresa.  The story then changes into one of trust, honesty and understanding, as well as a story of letting go of the past and looking forward, allowing a past life to live only in memories.  Both characters struggle within themselves to find their right paths, until the story finally changes back to one of bravery and loss.

All in all, a very profound, believable and touching love story.  The characters, including Paul Newman as Dodge, Garret's father, are all strong, believable, unique and highly appealing.  They're dynamic, they change and grow in one way or another, and that applies to a number of minor characters as well.  The story feels like a classic tale of love set in modern times.  This doesn't affect the impact of the tale, however, because like I said, the sceneries in this film create on their own a sense of enchanting magic that surrounds the action and the characters.  I half-wish that some of the more adult-oriented scenes and language had been left out, thus making this film more appropriate for younger audiences.  The film is a perfect love story, refreshing and unique, and why should we not be allowed to experience it when we're younger?  Again, this film is beautiful and I'm delighted to have it in my collection.  I must say I was shocked at the number of negative reviews this film has received, ranging from bad to mediocre.  I guess in the age of dumb comedy and pessimistic disaster films, people are just not yet ready to experience a well told story of life.  I never, or very rarely, let others' opinions on a film alter my own views on it, so I give this film nine stars out of ten, which in my book, is excellent!",1214611200,,4925,4.9176755447941884

What kind of ""message"" is Message in a Bottle supposed to be leaving us with?  If you get all your problems figured out and then get your life going in the right direction... well that's it it's over, life will play a cruel joke on you?

115481,5,0790748193,"The novel by Nicholas Sparks, Message In a Bottle, has been turned into a wonderful movie about loss and new-found love.  It stars Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn and Paul Newman.  The story begins when Theresa Osborne is jogging on the beach in Cape Cod and finds a corked bottle half buried in the sand with a rolled up note inside of it.  She takes the piece of paper out of the bottle and discovers that it's a love letter written to someone named Catherine.  Divorced and raising a son on her on, the letter touches something in Theresa's heart that's totally unexpected.  She returns home to Chicago and to her job at the Chicago Tribune, where she works as a researcher.  Theresa decides to share the letter with her friends at work and an article is written about the letter.  This results in a ton of responses from the female readers of the newspaper.  Two more discovered letters are eventually added to the one Theresa has, and she begins a search to find out who the author of the letters is.  This leads her on a journey to the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Garrett Blake, a boat builder.  Garrett lost his wife two years earlier to an illness and has never recovered.  He still loves her and has kept their house the same since her death, refusing to allow her memory to fade.  When Theresa Osborne enters his life, however, Garrett begins to believe that it might be possible to love again.

Message In a Bottle is a beautiful film with magnificent shots of the Outer Banks (though most of the movie was filmed on the coast of Maine) and powerful performances by Costner, Penn, Newman, and John Savage.  Though the movie has a tragic ending, its message is still poignant in that it's possible to love again, even after you've lost someone close to you.  Oh, boy, is the ending of the movie a real tearjerker.  This is another 10-rating on the ""Boohoo Scale.""  The music to the film by Gabriel Yared is lovely and heart moving, and you may want to buy the soundtrack after listening to it.  Nicholas Sparks' Message In a Bottle is a great romantic novel and a wonderful movie about love that will have the eyes of most viewers brimming over with tears.  This is the kind of cry that's good for the soul.",1173398400,2,2224,4.47394540942928

Message in a Bottle hit me at my core. The passion and love that Kevin Costner and Robin Wright Penn share in the film is so real, so true. Costner's character is struggling with the loss of his beloved wife, Catharine, an element that adds greatly to the story.

I never expected to find so much passion in one movie. My heart simply aches for Penn's character; to find love like that...

OK. For Women. This is the kind of movie you get for yourself when you are down and you can't find the right love because you've been dating idiots like the guy above. And after this movie you may consider a stint somewhere in a Buddhist temple in a country that does not have zip codes.

The plot isn't bad although the author, Sparks and the actor, Costner, do their best to botch it up. People should miss those who have crossed the River Styx. Family members. Husbands. Wives. If you didn't miss them you didn't love them. And sometimes you can't move on. At least for awhile. At least you can't move on as fast as the people around you want you to.

So Robin Penn Wright finds 'the message in a bottle,' Costner's ode to the passing of his wife and his love, and falls in love with the sentiment. She tracks him down. I don't know how she does this. It seems highly improbable. I hate that in a movie. The director saying ""we're going to go from Point A to Point B, even though it seems impossible, so just forget how I did it!""

Whatever she uses she finds Costner and they begin to fall in love. At least she does. I don't know what Mr. Costner is trying to convey here. Maybe it's the script. He likes hanging out with Theresa (Penn Wright), And who wouldn't? She's just gorgeous, and says all the right things, trusts him, you know that they would be married forever. But he doesn't give her much to base anything on. Costner looks like an aging 'Lands End' model who JUST WON'T SHUT UP ABOUT HIS LOVE AND MISSING HER . . . .

So it's hard to understand why she would stick around. Harder to imagine why he would want her to. There is a great scene with the extraordinary Paul Newman and Costner where the acting talents of both come out. That's it. It's beautifully photographed.

It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, Paul Newman, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.

The only setbacks are in relation to some weak lines that Robbie Coltrane's character has to say, and also in relation to the little boy; is there really any reason why the boy has to look like a girl???

Penn stars as Theresa Osborne, a researcher for the Chicago Tribune who discovers one of the bottles which washed up on a Cape Cod beach.

Intrigued, Theresa begins to investigate the bottle and its contents.  She covers everything, right down to the manufacturer of the typewriter which the message was typed from and the letterhead that was used.  All of the clues eventually lead her to Garret and his North Carolina beachfront home.

Once there, Theresa discovers that Garret is still obsessed with his lost wife, and she must confront her own growing feelings for Garret.  Despite his tough exterior, Theresa manages to break through and a loving relationship soon begins to develop.  Soon, Theresa must return to her job in Chicago, but she asks Garret to come and visit her.  Weeks later, Garret takes her up on her offer and comes to Chicago.

This is a very good movie.  Robin Wright Penn and Kevin Costner are excellent, but I enjoyed Paul Newman's portrayal as Garret's father Dodge Blake the best.  His efforts to maintain his relationship with his son and his sound advice which he gave to Garret were high points of the film.  I also enjoyed Garret's boat building sequences.

For me, the most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the personal growth of Robin Wright's character, although it did require some suspension of disbelief that Costner's character was a major component of that growth.
But it was the ending that left me furious, and horribly disappointed.  I don't require the ending to be a happy one, but this tragedy felt entirely artificial.  I can only hope that the book made it more believable than the film did.

Almost nothing in the film rings true.  Every twist is predictable and unbelievable, devised only to tug at the heartstrings.  Could Costner truly be this obsessed with his dead wife and still love Penn- a woman with whom he has nothing in common?  Possibly, but the filmmakers make no effort to show what draws these two very different people to one another.  Instead, their attraction is assumed.  Without it there's no film.  The idea that anyone, let alone Penn's educated newspaper-woman, would even consider speaking with Costner's brooding, troubled, and occasionally violent boat-builder strains credibility.  Instead of a man with a romantic nature, we get a man caught between obsessive-compulsive disorder and a coma.
Only the supporting players survive with their dignity intact.  Robbie Coltrane does a nice turn as Penn's boss, and Paul Newman triumphs over the material as Costner's crusty father.",1032912000,,1473,5.186440677966102

This film tells a very good story of love, fate, loss, and hope.
It deals with the complexity of grief very well and anyone who has loved will empathize with the 2 central characters in this film. You generally give a toss for the characters, so heres the story in a nutshell.
Theresa (played by Robin Wright Penn ) is out jogging on a beach one morning and finds a bottle embedded in the sand, in the bottle contains a heartbreaking letter of someone who knows his partner is about to die, Theresa is so infatuated by the heart wrenching contents and poetry in the mans letter she dedicates all her time into finding him and when she does a love story develops and if I go any further I'll spoil it for you.
Now I'm a man and love Boys movies and hadnt cried in 3 years until I watched this film , its THE most beautiful coherent and honest love story told, without pulling any punches, no meaningless sweaty love scenes or whipped cream flying around, just an epic tale of romance , great characterizations, consumate acting from Kevin Costner, Paul Newman (very underplayed and moving) and Robin Penn all very good.
If you like films in the shape of 'City Of Angels', 'The English Patient' , 'Beaches', Terms Of Endearment etc this will be in your collection and the soundtrack is also awesome check reviews for that too.",1018656000,5,1385,4.680327868852459
115547,1,0790748193,"Let's see. A romantic drama about a woman who searches for the man who writes beautiful missives to his dead wife.
How powerful are these words? Princess Bride's journalist character travels down south to visit the man who wrote this beautiful letter in a bottle to his wife. She's intrigued by him. By his writing. How can a man love so much! She MUST know this man!
Until she sees that the man who wrote this stuff is a balding, overweight guy. Well, maybe that letter wasn't THAT great. Maybe he copied it out of a book anyways. Besides that, it's silly trying to find out about a guy who wrote something very private. I think I'll go home....WAIT A MINUTE. Kevin Coster is the man that wrote that letter...not the average looking, everyday fellow that nobody would be attracted to! NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, that letter really WAS intriguing! I MUST find out more about this guy!
Gimme a break. Costner's a hottie to Wright, especially since her mysteriously doesn't say much. She'll learn later that he doesn't say much because he hasn't much to say. With memorable pick up lines such as ""Do you like meat"", Costner must've been advised to keep his yap shut as much as possible...and it was brilliant advice. In fact, the more he talks in this movie, the more he puts his foot in his mouth. Wright touches dead wife's shoe (Costner leaves a room in his house untouched as a tribute to his dead wife), and that makes Costner FREAK. Costner actually spends the whole movie being quiet, giving mixed signals, pining for his dead wife, and acting like an extreme introvert. BUT THIS DOESN'T TURN OFF WRIGHT in the LEAST! Nope. She invites him to Chicago, has a sex scene with him (I guess she's loose, but it doesn't add to the romance of the movie, and seems like it doesn't really fit in the movie).
Romantic dramas work with solid dialogue. There was no banter between Costner and Wright in this movie. Instead, we watch them spending time with each other, with music playing in the background in place of words, showing us that the two are having wonderful conversations, without us actually hearing what they have to say to each other. Maybe it should be assumed that they have a lot to say to each other, but why would I assume that? In the parts of the movie where they have conversation, it's awkward and the dialogue is, well, dull.
The romance is unbelievable. What we have here is Wright's character acting like a desparate woman who wants a good lookin' man in her life so bad that she'll ignore obvious signs that should make her run away. Fine, if you don't sugarcoat it into looking like a classic romance between two people that naturally go together like ham n eggs. They don't. And again, NO CLEVER DIALOGUE IN THE WHOLE MOVIE. I watched it in the theatre, and thought the sex scene was a half-bleep attempt at forcing a romance in our heads. Sex doesn't assume romance. It assumes sex when there's nothing else going for this couple.
I've beaten that to death. Paul Newman overacted so bad it was embarrassing. I blame the director for this one. Newman knows how to act.
The death scene looked like an insurance policy. As if the movie wasn't tragic and sad enough, hey let's have a death scene to jerk some tears. I know. It's what the book called for. Still, make us care about the characters more before you throw in a death scene. I didn't care. I was insulted. A man's family goes out for a pleasure sail in stormy waters. Makes sense. I'd take my wife and small child on a pleasure sail in the middle of a storm. Yes, a sailor gets storm warnings before he leaves dock or he gets it from the radio.
So everybody capsizes, and Coster saves the family instead of the husband, who waits on Costner's boat for Costner to save his family. I guess the husband, seeing his family in danger, was more concerned with preventing pneumonia. Gimme a break.
If you check your brain at the door, you might not find this movie to be horrible. I still don't see how you manage to find it entertaining, though. And I like Costner and Wright!

115549,4,0790748193,"Although the main actors in this movie are Costner and Wright-Penn, I would have to say that I like Paul Newman the best.  His acting came across as a bit more profound and true than did the others.
Costner and Wright-Penn do good jobs in portraying their characters.  The former, a widower trying to come to grips with his loss, and the latter, a divorced mom wanting to believe that there are good, sensitive men still out there in the world.  This movie bring you with them in their journey as they discover that life does go on.
Visually, I really didn't find a lot of panoramic shots as you might find in ""The Prince of Tides.""  Given that this movie was on the Southern coast, I would have like to get more of a flavor for where Costner's character was coming from.
After the credits, the special edition includes deleted footage from the movie.  The director explains what he was thinking when he shot the footage as well as why he was told it should be deleted.  I think the scene in the shop fit the dialogue of the movie better, but I agree that the phone call was unnecessary.  I would recommend this version for these deleted scenes.  I don't think it created any great epiphany for me, but I found it interesting to hear what the director thought about the movie.

115552,5,0790748193,"This is a movie I bought primarily for my wife, I thought on first impressions when reading the back cover it would be a chick-flick. How wrong I was. This movie is best enjoyed on DVD for its seaborne settings more than anything - the Maine locations, doubling up for South Carolina are a joy to look at and add to the movie's many delights. But most of all, the performers are superb. Robin Wright-Penn plays Thresea, a divorcee and reporter who stumbles across a message in a green bottle addressed to one Catherine. She tracks down the sender to South Carolina - boat builder Garret Blake, played brilliantly by Kevin Costner who proves he's not typecast in action roles all the time! Blake is mourning his dead wife Catherine . . . and before you know it, time spent on his yacht and a bit of opening up his feelings brings out the romantic in both of them. But all does not run well in love as the plot takes on an interesting twist when he visits Theresa and her son in Chicago. And the ending, although a wee bit predictacle, is a real crusher, but then life has its ups and downs as well, one may say. Overall, this movie, like the also thought-provoking and brilliant WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, is one which you must watch with a wife or partner. I definitely agree with other reviews - it will make you appreciate each other a lot more and not take him or her for granted. Also watch out for Paul Newman as Blake's father - another very talented performer! Also, you get to hear a great soundtrack, including a song called I WILL KNOW YOUR LOVE by the beautiful and talented Beth Nielsen Chapman! A must see.",982108800,13,1614,4.383333333333334
115553,4,0790748193,"I rented this movie because my wife wanted something that she would enjoy (as opposed to all the war/action films that I have rented lately).  I mainly chose this movie because of the actors, not because I had read the book.  Overall, I thought it was a pretty good film.  A bit predictable at times, but a good story.
I thought the story concept worked well, and I really enjoyed all the scenes shot at the Outer Banks.  We used to vacation there, and it is a wonderful place to go and relax.  The only part of the movie I didn't like (and my wife didn't like it either) was the ending.  It seems like the director looked at his watch, noticed the movie was already over two hours long, so he decided it needed to end in 10 more minutes.  The ending just doesn't do a very good job of putting all the pieces together.
Like some of the other reviews, I recommend renting this movie instead of buying it.  It is a good movie to watch with your significant other, or possibly even a good ""date movie"".  It does talk about some pretty heavy topics (like death of a spouse, and divorce), so be warned....not everyone is happy in the end.",979430400,6,1133,4.28169014084507
115554,1,0790748193,"Wow.  I have a real dilemma here.  I'm sitting here trying to figure out a way to say as delicately as possible that this movie is a real piece of crap.  I could start in on some sarcasm, because I really enjoy being sarcastic at the right moment....something like, go ahead, watch Message in a Bottle if you are on death row and have nothing better to do.  Before I get too nasty, maybe I should explain.
 First off, no, I didn't read the book.  Maybe that would've helped.  I think practically everyone I've ever known who read the book before seeing the movie, still said, ""The book was better.""  So, knowing that, I say the book HAS to be better because the movie was so bad.
 Message in a Bottle begins in a somewhat interesting fashion.  Theresa, played by Robin Wright Penn, is jogging along the beach and finds a message in a bottle.  It appears to be a love letter of sorts to a woman named Catherine.  Theresa is so intrigued with this letter that she shows the lady at the inn, her co-workers, that dog of the neighbors that bites everyone....sorry, this sarcasm just takes over my body sometimes.
 So, Theresa does research for a Chicago newspaper and a columnist for the paper decides to print the letter.  It's content is intriguing to everyone, so, since she found the letter, she starts researching its origin.  This is one of few things I found sort of interesting.  The methods employed in tracking down the author of the message in a bottle kept me interested.  But unfortunately, that part of the movie lasts about 5 minutes tops.  Then, I was instantly bored again.
 So, she tracks down the origin of the message, and goes on a mission to exploit, I mean FIND, this Ernest Hemmingway of bottled messages.  Kevin Costner, who plays Garet Blake, churns out his usual monotone performance.  Don't get me wrong.  There are some Kevin Costner movies I really like.  Honestly, I do.  But, those have been the movies where the storyline fashioned itself around his calm, everyman demeanor.  This movie moves too slowly and has too few other characters to support his usual ""no acting is good acting"" method.  Kevin, buddy, just for fun, put some emotion in your character the next time.
 I'm no psychologist, so I really don't know the professional theory on whether it's men or women who hold grudges longer.  I think everyone will agree no one can hold a grudge longer than a teenage girl, but I'm talking about grown men and women, and their relationships with each other.  However, talking about forgiveness, there is a really nice moment of forgiveness between two men in this film.  Like I've said before, you love those moments in movies when your heart stops, just slightly.  This is one such moment, even if every other moment stinks, this one is good.
 For those of you reaching, hoping for something to love, you can love Paul Newman.  He is the only reason to watch the movie, if you really feel you have to.  He plays, Dodge, Garet's grumpy, surly father.  You may be pleasantly reminded of the old codger in your life.  So, it's kind of fun to watch movie characters who remind you of someone you already know.  His role, though small, is practically the only redeeming part of this film.  There's not much more I can say regarding plot, what little there is anyway, without spoiling the movie.  I think this movie was supposed to be a chick flick, but, being a chick, I could hardly stand it.  There isn't one shred of testosterone in this movie, so for those of you who enjoy a healthy dose of that, you've been duped.  The whole movie could have been avoided if, instead of retreiving the message, the character of Theresa watches Martha Stewart and turns the bottle into a fabulous Christmas gift.  Or maybe she could skip the creative stuff and just put some liquor in there and drink herself into a stupor instead.  The plot moves along at a snail's pace and Robin Wright Penn and Kevin Costner deliver subpar performances.

Unlike most films today, this one centers upon genuine love - not lust - between two lonely people. Kevin  Costner portrays Garrett Blake, a seagoing boat renovator and a widower of  two years who cannot let go of the past.  Robin Wright-Penn plays Theresa,  a research specialists for the Chicago Tribune and a divorcee with a young  son. While taking a few days holiday she discovers Garrett's message of  love to his deceased wife in a bottle that washed up to shore.  Haunted by  the letter, she uses her research skills, along with the help of the  Chicago newspaper staff, to track Garrett down.  The shy awkwardness the  two characters exhibit when they're together is refreshingly charming and  very realistic.  In spite of their lack of finesse, a sensitive, beautiful  love story begins to take hold that is destined to pierce the viewer's  heart. With the memory of his late wife, Catherine, constantly  overshadowing their relationship, Garrett and Theresa continue to draw  closer to one another and fall deeper in love.  Their story concludes,  however, with a surprising twist.  Paul Newman, who portrays Garrett's  father (Dodge), remains a master of his trade.  Coarse, and brutally  honest, Dodge's love for his son, and approval of the new woman on the  scene, is heartwarming.  Newman's character proves to be a necessary anchor  for the two lovers.  With an exceptional supporting cast who enhance the  tale, and beautifully filmed on the coast of Maine, ""Message In A  Bottle"" is a sad love story, but it sends a powerful message to us  all.

Costner and Newman are purely magical when you witness how a man deals with  grief and moving on with life, with Newman's character pushing the healing  along.  Wright - Penn, a single mother meets Costner and falls head over  heels for a man who is still holding a torch for his deceased wife.  The  chemistry between Wright-Penn and Costner is powerful enough to keep any  man or woman who may be skeptical about a second chance at love glued to  their seats, leaving them teary-eyed and a little more appreciative of  their spouse by the end of the movie.

Kevin Costner was your  typical man of the sea and portrayed a man not ready to move on with his  life after the tragic loss of his partner. It took someone like Robyn Penn  Wright to stir the deeply hidden emotions but even then she could not  compare to his lost love. She gave him inspiration and made him dig deep to  find his true self. Paul Newman was superb as the crusty kindly father and  without his inclusion in the film, be it as a supporting role, a lot of the  emotion would have been lost.

115577,4,0790748193,"First, there are some really fine reviews of this movie spinkled in here, especially the reviews from Mikeymkm of Dec. 19th, and Robert's of Sept 15th.  They are in disagreement over the ending, but reading their reviews  will give you an excellent idea of what this movie is all about.
Like  Robert, I too saw this movie first on an airplane, and the reactions of the  passengers were identical (maybe we flew on the same plane).  As our plane  landed and people disembarked, those of us who were watching the movie  stayed until it was over--and that has to say something!
Personally, I  tend to view the ending more in the vein of Mikeymkm's review, but not  because it was downbeat, more in that it seemed like a typical  Hollywood-style ending.  If they had stayed truer to the novel in this  respect (as mentioned by the North Carolina reviewer of June 12th--caution,  DO NOT read this review if you haven't seen the movie), I would have been  much more satisfied.
All in all, ""Message in a Bottle"" did a lot of  things right.  It kept me in my seat and I was attracted to both the theme  and the actors, and the cinematography seemed to sweep me to Outer Banks  (or Maine, where one reviewer said it was filmed).  Still, I came away  feeling a little unsatisfied, even a little manipulated.  Between 1 and 10,  I give ""Message in a Bottle"" a marginal 7.  It is a movie I enjoyed, and  will probably view again, but it missed on the level of being a truly  memorable film, at least it did for me.",947116800,5,1502,4.413919413919414

When Jason's dad takes him for a summer visit, Theresa's  journey begins at a deserted beach on Cape Cod where she finds a message in  a bottle.
The message Theresa reads quite obviously tugs at her soul as  she proceeds to share it with her hostess at the bed and breakfast where  she's staying, with her co-workers back at the Tribune where she returns  one day early, and with her boss, who does her the favor of sharing the  message with Chicago.
Theresa sets out on a mission, with the paper's  encouragement, to find out who the message was written by and the story  behind it all. Using her job's resources, she tracks down the author in the  Outer Banks of North Carolina. He is Garret Blake, a terse ship-builder and  restorer whose discomfort with the world around him is alleviated only by  his passion for the sea.
Kevin Costner (Blake) does well with roles that  don't require a lot of overt emotion and he does well here. Robin  Wright-Penn as Theresa was very good as the reporter who gets all too  caught up in her story. A special mention of Paul Newman here doing yeoman  character work as Blake's father Dodge, who understands his son's pain all  too well and who tries to help all around him keep their emotions in check  and headed in the right direction.

115592,5,0790748193,"The was one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. Almost a classic love story, but seems so true in a way. One always hopes that one day they will find their true soul mate. In this story, it's sad for the  reason that they had found each other and were so right for each other. It  makes you ask yourself should a person wait for a true soul mate. I highly  recommend this movie for anyone. Especially for the romantic at heart.",939340800,,443,4.011363636363637
115593,5,0790748193,"Thank God for films that do not follow the standard form of what is disgustingly called ""chic flicks"".(Sorry, ladies, but it's the hard and highly-biased truth).  This movie is poetry in motion--by which I  mean Shakespearian Love Sonnets,Keats, the Brownings and Shelley.  The poem  begins with breath-taking cinematography of the Maine coastine, reaching  out toward the Atlantic.  I believe these scenes are repeated throughout  the movie to remind us that this is a seaman's story, which has, as many a  coastline villager of any country will tell you, both poetry and pain.  The  film moves along at an easy, mellow pace, giving the viewer time to guess  what really is going on in the characters' minds, and where the next fork  in the 'road of life' will go.  When you learn to love someone who ""is  your true north"", and then lose them, think what that must feel  like--total, utter abandonment, a sick-feeling in your gut that you are  really, really ALONE.  It doesn't surprise me that Gerrett is as open as he  is toward Theresa; hugs are good for things like this, as are the things  that go along with hugs.  But Catherine is still there, much like Michelle  Pfeiffer as Gillian in ""To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday. There are  some heart-breaking and gut-wrenching decisions to be made, as there are in  real life.  Those who 'pooh-pooh' the ending and Gerrett's death, would be  better off reading Cinderella or eating chocolate.  It's your right to be  upset when you don't like a film's ending, but don't blast the whole movie  because of it.  I believe the acting of all three main characters to be  flawless and well in-tune with what I believe the director and producers  intended, a poignant, bittersweet tale of love lost, love gained and love  lost permanently. If you have ever seen ""Love Story"" starring  Ryan O'Neal and Ali Magraw, there are some striking similarities, including  the ending.  LIFE IS NOT FAIR!! but while you're living it, enjoy the  environment around as best you can, enjoy the people around as best you  can, and may God grant you the grace and friends you need should your  ""North"" be taken from you.",938563200,4,2147,4.7650273224043715

115605,3,0790748193,"Yes it is the same role as the Mariner, the Postman, Wyatt Earp, A Perfect World and others Costner has played. The good news is it works here too. This is an endearing story of a woman (Robyn Wright Penn) who discovers a  message in a bottle. It is a goodbye letter to Costner's wife after she has  died. She is instantly attracted to the poet author of the note, and seeks  him out. He turns out to be a ship builder who lives alone except for  visits from his father, another powerful performance from Paul Newman. This  is a fairy tale like story, but with a darkly ironic ending which turned me  off. Of course it's not the first love story to end in such a way, but then  I never like it when it does.",934329600,,707,4.116788321167883
115606,5,0790748193,"Costner was great as usual, but Paul Newman stole the show in this wonderful drama.  As for it being different from the book, it doesn't matter.  As an avid movie fan and with some experience in converting books  into screenplays, I know it is necessary to change the plot.  Movies and  books are different.  Books are geared more at a certain group - those who  can handle boring parts that are furthering the plot.  When you see a  movie, you don't expect that.  Every scene has to be interesting or it's  not a good movie.  So, the screenplay writers have to make changes that  will make the movie move along faster and with more exciting things.  Otherwise you have a 5 hour, boring movie, and who wants to see that?  The  point is, don't let the changes bother you.  It's a terrific movie, full of  romance, and it makes you think about what you have.",933552000,,856,4.412903225806452
