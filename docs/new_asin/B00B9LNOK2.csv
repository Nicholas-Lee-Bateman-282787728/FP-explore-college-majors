8564679,5,B00B9LNOK2,I have purchased both season one and two and am hoping they make the third and last season on dvd soon.  I have watched the third season on line but would love to own the whole series on dvd so I can watch it when ever I want to.  The united states seems to only make part of some of my favorite seasons of certain series from Australia and cannot figure out why but wish they would start selling more of them soon because I would buy all the seasons of many of the shows.,1427673600,,472,3.957894736842105

I admire the actresses performance, very true to the difficult life of being in this competitive world. Younger girls, experience the most trouble in this as they are left with
Choices, sometimes not theirs to make.",1427241600,,292,4.979591836734694
