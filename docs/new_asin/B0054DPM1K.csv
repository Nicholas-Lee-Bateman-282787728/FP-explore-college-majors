4566160,4,B0054DPM1K,"A TV show from the self-described ""biggest producers of garbage on the planet""? On DVD? Yep.

MAD premiered on Cartoon Network last year to mixed reactions. The younger folk seem to like it well enough, the snooty late-teens and nostalgic twenty-somethings turn up their noses, and the older folk just scratch their heads and say ""MAD magazine is still around? Huh."" In a nutshell, I would dare to describe it as ""Robot Chicken for a PG audience"". Animated sketch comedy that parodies and mashes up every facet of pop culture that might be relevant to today's cartoon-watching crowd.

And in my opinion, it works. What we're presented with here is a high-octane stream of movie riffs, kids' cartoon parodies, Internet memes, gross-out jokes, and quirky little bumps between segments (some of which are produced by the legendary Sergio Aragones himself!). The mash-ups range from up-to-date (CSiCarly, Avaturd, I Love You Iron Man, etc) to cross-generational (2012 Dalmatians, Malcolm In The Middle-Earth, Grey's In Anime, etc), and cover dozens of sub-genres in between.

If you remember reading MAD magazine as a kid (and haven't been keeping up with what kids are reading and watching these days) you may be ""too old"" to get this show. Some things will still make you chuckle, but unless you're familiar with Hannah Montana, Twilight, and Justin freaking Bieber, you'll miss at least 50% of the jokes present here. Though you'll probably still enjoy the Spy vs Spy shorts. Classic stuff.

For a DVD release, this works well enough. Half of the show's first season (13 11-minute segments) is present, picture and audio are fine, but no special features. And interestingly enough, no advertisements. Still, I'm docking a star for releasing the season in two $eparate part$, and for the lack of special features - some interviews with the snarkastic writers would have been nice.

All in all though, pick this up if you're a fan of the show. If your kids are always trying to take a peek at your Robot Chicken DVDs even after you've told them not to, give them this to suck on. Who knows, it could work.

Don't get even, get MAD.",1320019200,10,2128,4.880886426592798
4566161,5,B0054DPM1K,"Mad on cartoon network is totally hilarious!!! Sure it makes fun of people and does a movie parody a few times per episode.  If you have any sense of humor at all, this show is for you.  Can't wait for it to come out  so I can purchase season one.  Commenting on a review left----kids do have a sense of humor.  They think the show is funny.  I have no idea why you would even leave a bad review.  Have you even watched the show?  If not, you should.  You will like.",1311552000,10,466,3.9782608695652173

I love Mad Magazine and read it every time it comes out and while i like the spy vs. spy and the don martin parts i don't like the movie parodies as much as in the magazine. Dont get me wrong. The show is alright,just not my cup of tea.",1310774400,,317,4.0476190476190474

4566167,5,B0054DPM1K,"I actually don't own this dvd [at least not now] so I can't comment on the dvd's quality. I do record and watch it on tv or buy episodes off of iTunes for my iPad so I can watch it anywhere. This is a skit comedy show that makes fun of movies, tv shows and celebrities. It even makes fun of itself. It is based on the humour magazine, MAD. I haven't read it, so I can't compare this to that or MADtv. There seem to mixed opinions about this show, but I think it's funny just for how silly it is. I also think that it's a show that kids and adults can enjoy. There are lot of sketches that parody movies and shows that most kids won't be familiar with, but you don't have to be familiar with said movies or shows to enjoy the skits. Although, the skits might have spoilers for the movies or shows they parody, so if you don't want spoilers for said movies or shows, then you'll want to watch them before seeing the skits. There are also short funny scenes, Spy vs. Spy [about two spies always trying to outwit each other], and fake commercials. This dvd has 13 11-minute episodes. The Season One Part Two dvd has the same amount of episodes. I wanted to write that here so that no one thinks they're getting 13 half hour episodes. So if you're looking for a funny cartoon, I would recommend this. Although, as I've said before, there seem to be mixed opinions about this show, so you may want to check out a few episodes before deciding whether or not to get this.",1354320000,,1463,4.191489361702128

4566169,1,B0054DPM1K,"This show is only funny for infants or people suffering from severe brain damage.

The fact that it has the name MAD on it means nothing. MAD TV at least had a FEW good bits to it, however this show seems to be ""written"" by former SNL writers who were fired because the sketches they came up with bombed.

The ""comedy"" is so puerile, it makes the jokes on the side of a Happy Meal box look complex.

This show wants to pass off as being for children, and I agree. That is if Sesame Street is too advanced for your child.
Scratch that, I don't think this diarrhea of a show is worthy to be viewed by anyone, living or dead...although I'm sure that if you did sit a dead person down to watch this show, it would bring them back to life just long enough to switch the TV off.",1332115200,3,772,4.065789473684211
4566170,5,B0054DPM1K,"I've been a fan of MAD magazine since I can remember. Since the Seventies sometime, and I even still subscribe to the magazine. I have a young child in the house who loves to watch all of the latest shows for kids, and this show came on one day and caught my attention and from that day on I've been hooked.

Each episode is like an animated version of the magazine. You get the movie and TV show spoofs, the celebrity parodies, lampooned commercials, and other animated segments such as Spy vs Spy, Sergio Aragones clips, and Don Martin gags. It's all there and more in great 11 minute episodes. The voice talent cast is excellent as well and really adds a lot to the jokes being presented. In fact, some of the gags based on pop culture and celebrity icons that I am not very familar with are still hilarious just to hear the zany voices blather on!

If you are looking for some silly entertainment to lighten up your mood and give you some good hearty laughs then you'll be glad that you got MAD.",1329264000,,999,4.336898395721925

8456558,4,B0054DPM1K,"I loved MAD TV and this is the next best thing to the television series. With the same wittiness and satire for late night television, this animated series is designed to serve laughs but not for children rather than adults. The episodes include ""Avaturd"" and ""CSICarly;"" ""TransBoreMores"" and ""Green Wars;"" ""2012 Dalmations"" and ""Greys in Anime;"" ""Star Bleech"" and ""Uglee;"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean 4; Journey to Neverland"" and ""The Batman Family Feud;"" ""Wall-E-Nater"" and ""Extreme Renovation House Edition-Superman's Fortress of Solitude;"" ""Big Time Rushmers"" and ""Clifford-field;"" ""Fantastic Megan Fox"" and ""Mad vs. Wild;"" ""I Love You, Iron Man"" and ""Ben 10 Franklin;"" """"Class of the Titans"" and ""Zeke and Lex Luthor;"" ""S'Up"" and ""Mouse MD;"" ""DeGrinchy Code"" and ""Duck;"" and ""Snot Pilgrim"" and ""Malcolm in the Middle Earth.""

I wished there were special features about the DVD. But if you like satiric cartoons. You will definitely enjoy MAD cartoons. I wished that the cartoons were better animated though but I still like the humor. I enjoyed the ""Mouse MD"" spoof of ""House"" and ""DeGrinchy Code"" about the ""Grinch Who Stole Christmas"" and a ""Davinci Code"" spoof.",1493424000,,1167,5.240641711229946
