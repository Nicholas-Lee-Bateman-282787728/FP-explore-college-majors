8258210,5,B0015FGC2O,I couldn`t believe the package deal on this original classic and the more modern version of the movie. Brilliant idea!,1468627200,,118,4.95
8258211,5,B0015FGC2O,"The 1958 ""The Fly"" is a better movie, even though it's the older one.  Some times it just doesn't work with a remake.
This movie is truly a sci-fy  Experimential scientist Andre Delambre (David Hedison) is attempting to transfer matter through space using himself as the test subject. But things go really really wrong when a housefly buzzes into the chamber with him, resulting in two grotesque things. Each half human and half fly. I will not go any futher, the ending is awesome. Know one would have guessed what happens at the end of this movie, I didn't when I first saw it back in the day.
*The 1986 is just two gory and phony. Geena David and Jeff Goldblum star, Goldblum does the transportation, but he is fine when he comes out of the chamber. But as time goes on, he becomes the whole fly, he is oozing stuff and yes he is grotesque but not in sci-fy standards.  The story line is thin and I thought it was a ""B"" rated movie.
I had to buy the duel pack DVD just to get the 1958 movie.  Have seen the 1986 one before and didn't do anything for me and I really didn't want to buy it.  Had no choice.",1399334400,,1107,4.202830188679245
