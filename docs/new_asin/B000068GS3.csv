7964209,5,B000068GS3,"I bought these separately before the package was made. I am not normally a fan of packaging unless it is a series or some other theme. However there is not a clinker in the bunch. I suggest you look at the individual reviews. However for those that are in a hurry:

Casablanca: Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman - Two people fall in love during war France as the Nazis are invading. They meet again in Casablanca the last outpost on the way to freedom. There is mystery, intrigue subterfuge and the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

The Maltese Falcon: Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor - Sam Spade (Bogart) is accused of murdering his partner, murdering a suspect, and down right sneakiness. He is trying to find out why everyone is looking for the black bird. In the process he falls in love with Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor). Will they find the thing that dreams are made of?
A remake of the 1931 version.

The Philadelphia Story: Socialites Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn - A 1940 screen adaptation of The Philadelphia Story. C. K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) and Tracy Samantha Lord (Katherine Hepburn) get divorced. Now Tracy is going to marry George Kittredge, who worked his way up the corporate latter to the top of a mine. C. K. brings people from Spy magazine to cover the event. The fun begins as every one has second thoughts. And Wicked Uncle Willie is available.

Arsenic and Old Lace: Cary Grant, Raymond Massey, Peter Lorre - A Halloween tale. A critic of marriage gets married, and then he finds out that insanity runs in the family as two branches of the family compare body counts. This really is a comedy. They could not get Boris Karloff; however Raymond Massey does just as well. And don't forget Dr. Einstein (auch der lieber).

The Big Sleep: Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall - A 1946 adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novel. Private-eye Philip Marlowe (Bogart) is hired to keep an eye on Carmen (Martha Vickers), youngest daughter of General Sternwood (Charles Waldron), and you guessed it falls in love with older sister. Lots of sub plots. ""You go too far, Marlowe.""

Now, Voyager: Betty Davis, Paul Henreid - Based on the novel by Olivia Higgins Prouty. I think one of the shockers for me was when Charlotte Vale was forced to remove her eye glasses to find she did not need them. ""Don't ask for the moon--we have the stars""

Citizen Kane: Orson Welles, Joseph Cotton - A story is based on the life of William Randolph Hearst. Because of its popularity as an art film many people have trouble just watching it as the story. Watch it to find out what is meant by Rosebud.",1504396800,,2594,4.675438596491228
