I enjoyed watching it, but then I like to watch this kinds of movies ( B rated ).",1327881600,,117,3.72
8391216,5,B0038BZGHU,"As with most of the Japanese action movies, this didn't disappoint.  Great action movie, but that was all some of these movies need better scripts.",1319155200,,147,4.88
8391217,4,B0038BZGHU,"I had recently bought the 1st Onechanbara movie and i liked it very much. shortly after i bought the second one (OneChanbara 2 (Zombie Killer Vortex)) as well. it is quite different from the 1st one. different cast and completely different story line. this is NOT a sequel nor a prequel. you definitely get more bikini for your buck in this movie but you see less of Reiko. the acting, action, and cinematography are pretty good and overall i really liked the movie for what it was. ^_^",1273017600,8,486,4.534090909090909
8391218,3,B0038BZGHU,"Another movie I find at Toys -n- Joys. I have no idea how it relates to the first one. In Onechanbara, Aya tracks down her sister and duels her at the end of the movie and yet in this one, Aya and her sister are together. The actress are not the same either and seem younger no less. This movie ain't a sequal or a pre-quel. It's on it's own, not to metion Aya now has two swords from the start. Well, the movie is good and fun to watch. I think you will like this one is you liked the first Oncechanbara.",1268352000,4,505,3.912621359223301
