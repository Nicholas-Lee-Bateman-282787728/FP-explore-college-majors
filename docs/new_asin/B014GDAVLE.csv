7391458,4,B014GDAVLE,"Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) moves his family to a Southeast Asian nation (filmed in Thailand). He is an engineer for Cardiff, a company constructing the new water works. He meets Hammond (Pierce Brosnon) an ex-pat who drinks and causes civil unrest with his bad karaoke. The family is literally caught in the middle of a revolution, one where all foreigners must die. Jack and his family play hide and run for 90 minutes.

You can feel the intensity in the film during the roof scene which is depicted on the film poster, DVD cover and is in all the trailers. The rest of the movie is anti-climatic by comparison. Pierce Brosnon does disappear from the film for awhile, but returns to give us ""the speech"" about third world countries, [IMF] debt, foreign interests, and economic enslavement. You know, the terrorists are really the good guys speech.

The hide and seek part went long. In fact after the roof scene, I couldn't wait for the conclusion. Owen Wilson would not have been my first choice for the role. He didn't generate any excitement.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Near rape. Pierce Bronson assaults our ears with karaoke.",1442102400,4,1136,4.756345177664975

7391462,4,B014GDAVLE,"As ""No Escape"" (2015 release; 103 min.) open, we see a high level meeting taking place (drinks are tested for poison before consumption). It's the Prime Minister (of an unnamed country), and before we know it, the Prime Minister is murdered. The movie then switches to ""17 Hours Earlier"", as we get to know the Dwyer family as they are en route to Southeast Asia: Jack (played by Owen Wilson), Annie (played by Lake Bell), and their two young daughters Lucy and Beeze. During the flight they also meet Hammond (played by Pierce Brosnan), who has visited the country 15 times and knows the place inside out. Upon arrival at their hotel, Annie comments ""Welcome to the fourth world!"", as there is no functioning TV, phone or internet. The next morning Jack goes for a walk to by a US newspaper, and inadvertently gets mixed up in a stand-off between demonstrators and police in riot gear. At this point, we are not yet 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie has gotten pretty negative reviews from the experts and movie critics. Well, let me tell you, they are way off the mark on this one. If you have seen the movie's trailer, you already know that this is in essence one long escape movie (very similar in the way that the new Mad Max movie was in essence one long car chase). Once Jack gets mixed up in the stand-off, he and then his family in essence run and hide, and run some more, in a city where there is no sanctuary. It makes for an incredibly tense movie. It must also be mentioned that the movie is at times outright brutal, making for some difficult watching. This is definitely not a movie for the faint of heart. But there are also a number of heart-stopping scenes that play out brilliantly. The hotel rooftop scene, which is so reminiscent of the last days of Saigon 1975, will blow you away. Let me also point out a minus: much of the movie is shot with handheld cameras and there are tons of close-ups (enforcing the feeling of anxiety), which frankly makes for some exhausting watching. Also, I'm still not 'buying' into Owen Wilson as an action movie guy. On the other hand, Lake Bell, who shone a few years ago in her own movie ""In A World..."", shines again in this one. Kudos also for Brosnan, who still has the charisma of his James Bond days. When you realize that the production budget of this movie was just $5 million, a pittance in today's Hollywood terms, this movie more than delivers the goods.

""No Escape"" opened nationally this past weekend and due to the negative reviews I was hedging whether to go see this, even though I had liked the trailer. Well I gave in to my original curiosity. So glad I did. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great (it was a week night, though). If you are in the mood for an ultra-tense action drama and you are not faint of heart, you should check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""No Escape"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1441152000,3,3132,4.464223385689354
7391463,3,B014GDAVLE,"The Movie Review by Andy McKinney
No Escape
 The most frightening horror film in years turns out to be disguised as a thriller.  Imagine the parents of two young girls trapped in a city they do not know, among a population whose language they do not speak and the family suffering under unrelenting attack by forces not just hostile but beyond their understanding.  It sounds like a horror movie to me.
 But the films setup has different parameters from the horror genre.  A failed engineer, in an act of desperation takes a job in a third world nation with a water company, good for his family-he has a job-and good for the people of the third world-they have clean water. This seems like a win-win solution, right? Wrong with a capital W.
 The wayfarers are no sooner tucked into their luxury hotel, luxury by third world standards any way, when a horrendously violent coup breaks out against the government.  Insurgents shoot people right and left in full view of any who might want to watch.  Foreigners and the thin layer of people who have western educations or connections to western companies who are not shot out of hand are pulled down and bludgeoned to death.  Except for the victims who are chopped to bits with cane knives. We wouldnt have a higher body count in a Zombie movie or more meaningless and incomprehensible deaths.  The native-speaking people are angry enough to slay with a lavish hand and spare neither man nor woman nor child.  Nor do they spare the elderly nor the random innocent countryman who stumbles into the wrong place at the wrong time.  We have classic terror of the unknown with instant and terminal consequences for those people not running fast or far enough.
 We agonize with the parents.  We fear for the little girl children.  We want them to survive, to escape from their hunters.  Who wants, after all, to see ordinary people from Austin Texas bloodily murdered for crimes not of their doing?  And for a good while we roll with it.  The tension, the terror and the wild pace of the film sweep us along.  Until the characters start to do things that no survivor could do and live.  The husband and wife have too little faith in one another to make the escape work.  They do stupid things that no survivor would do.  They leave the little girls alone in the dark, they forget to pick up the weapons of the dead insurgents.  These are the things that the dead people in horror movies do, not the survivors.  And yet the writers let them live.  Phooey.
 Owen Wilson does very well as Jack Dwyer, the dad and engineer in this decidedly un-comic role.  Lake Bell, known mostly from TV, plays Mrs. Dwyer.  Pierce Brosnan and Sahajak Boonthanakit play British agents who pop up now and again to be of use to the terrified family.  Their characters exist only to fill holes in the plot.
 No Escape is directed by John Erick Dowdle who has also directed a couple of well-done Zombie and horror films.  Perhaps that explains the horror flavor to the movie.  He also wrote the screenplay along with his often partner in writing and brother, Drew Dowdle.
 This R rated (violence) film runs for one hour and 41 minutes.  They shot the film in Thailand for a reported $5 million and managed to bleed twice that from the public over the opening week end.  No Escape musters a lack luster two saw blades and that only because of the tension and terror of the first part of the movie.  The Year of Living Dangerously and the more recent Argo both deal with third world real life horror in much better films.",1441065600,2,3535,4.5643879173290935
7391464,4,B014GDAVLE,"People forget that Owen Wilson did a good drama role as a Navy pilot in Behind Enemy Lines (2001).  Forget the PC critics, this is a suspense action movie worth watching.  An American family moving to Thailand (my guess) to make a new start.  We take things for granted as Americans and expect to live overseas without difficulty or inconvenience.

This movie shows how quickly political climate can change in a country, 17 hours to be exact; for the Dwyer family.  A simple story line that must have gone deep into the critics psyche.  A family fighting for their life, trying to escape an internal civil war or a revolution without social order or peaceful demonstrations.  Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson) leaves the hotel to grab a newspaper, and sees the storm gathering in the streets.  His life and his families will change for the worse right before his eyes.  He takes off like a fugitive for his life to save his family back at the hotel.  Critics are crying about the lack of a plot, it is what it is; a family fighting for survival while death surrounds them.  A stranger who shares a common language, reaches out to help them; Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) who knows the land and it's people.  A dynamic role for him, he lights up the screen as a guardian angel of sorts.

This movie delivers tension, action, life and death decisions that must be made, at a steady to fast pace.  I haven't held my breath like this since the first Die Hard movie.  A pleasant surprise in a sequel flashback summer of doldrums.  It is rated R for a reason due to violence and blood, only those kids 16 and up should view this.",1440892800,96,1609,4.496551724137931
7391465,4,B014GDAVLE,"Recently hired by an international conglomerate,  an American man (Owen Wilson) spirits his reluctant wife (Lake Bell) and daughters (Sterling Jerins and Claire Geare) from Texas to Southeast Asia.  On their first morning abroad, the fresh start is disrupted by an explosive coup and a subsequent wave of anti-Western mob violence.  With the help of a mysterious, seasoned expatriate (Pierce Brosnan), the family fights to stay a step ahead of their pursuers and escape to bordering Vietnam.  No Escape is a fast, vicious, and highly involving action-suspense film.  Wilson (in a relatively rare, but not unprecedented dramatic role) and Bell exude convincing parental desperation and dismay, while Brosnan is a scene-stealing delight, if a tad underutilized, as the debauched, jovial, unshaven Man with a Past Who Knows the Lay of the Land.  The film zips from one close-call-in-close-quarters set piece to the next, rarely pulling a punch in regard to violence and nicely maintaining momentum and a pervasive atmosphere of claustrophobia and paranoia.  The specter of potential xenophobia is present (this is a film in which a sympathetic white family is contrasted with and pit against a thronging Other, and there will be those who ignore the quality of the acting and craft on display because of this), but the film admirably, if a tad halfheartedly motions to temper this by also indicting Western corporations' acts of exploitation and resource plundering in the Third World.  I for one have no significant problem with a grind-house-spirited film such as this mining stranger-in-a-strange-land unease:  the spatial disorientation, the inability to easily communicate, etc.  After all, it is a real and recognizable experience and, by extension, a perfectly ripe subject for pulp entertainment.",1440892800,29,1801,5.4

There is a revolution and him and his family try to escape.  It is very well acted by everyone including the two girls who play the daughters.

Had at least some effort at character development been made, then viewers might care about the outcome and want these folks to prevail. But theres nothing particularly likable about the 3 lead characters, and the children are one dimensional props to elicit sympathy as they are dragged along on their parents harrowing adventure. Near the end the Pierce Brosnan character attempts to bring some morality to the movie with a simpleminded speech about the misguided intention of foreign nationals contributing to political instability, but by then it is far too late for the film to imply any depth or significance beyond the flimsiest of poorly acted, shallow entertainment.",1507075200,,729,5.460176991150442

7391511,5,B014GDAVLE,"I was just channel surfing this weekend and came across NO ESCAPE on cable.  Thank goodness!  Owen Wilson usually annoys the bonkers out of me, but here he's completely believable playing an American husband and father desperately trying to get his family out of the unnamed southeast Asia country they are in (my guess, since Vietnam borders this country via a river, is they are trying to escape Cambodia)--and get them out alive, as some sort of coup has taken place, and foreigners are being killed on sight.

Wilson plays Jack Dwyer, a down-on-his-luck businessman trying to resurrect his career overseas.  His wife (Lake Bell is also extraordinary) and daughters (Sterling Jerins and Claire Geare) are less than thrilled to relocate to a Third World country, but they have little time to adjust; the coup takes place literally within hours after their arrival.  Jack rounds up his family and takes them to the roof of their hotel, where other guests have also sought refuge--but the violent Natives are in hot pursuit.  Desperate, Jack convinces his wife to literally jump the street onto the roof of the next building. . .then throws his two daughters to her.  I was literally twisting in my recliner, this was so intense.  The Dwyer family then embarks on a desperate flight to flee the country; they are occasionally aided by a British ex-patriot who becomes a sort of guardian angel (Pierce Brosnan in a very likable role).  The family faces constant, incredibly dangerous obstacles, culminating in a life-threatening encounter at the river that borders Vietnam; yet they find a way to persevere.

NO ESCAPE is extremely intense and violent; this is not a movie for the faint of heart.  Again, Wilson and Bell give extraordinary performances.  If you enjoy international thrillers that move at the speed of light with action that starts almost from the first frame and never lets up, then NO ESCAPE is what you are looking for.  Highly recommended.

I would have given it another star except for one issue - the family got on my last friggin' nerve.  EVERY one of them, including the children.  I'm sorry, but when your life is in danger and it depends on you being cooperative and quiet to survive, even most children will know to shut the h*ll up.  Instead, this family provided commentary when they should've been silent.  I almost wished for them their clan to get caught, just to shut them up.  And when the daughter asks the father to tell her about when she was born - while they were hiding, I really thought, ""Is there no point where Mommy and Daddy don't turn and around and tell that kid if she doesn't shut up she's going to get everyone killed?""  Maybe I didn't grow up in a storybook life where danger never lurked but, even at that age, I knew when danger was around and how to behave properly to keep safe.  If it weren't for Pierce Brosnan saving the day, as he seems to do in nearly every film he's in - figuratively and literally, I'd have bumped another star off this.  When I find myself saying ""SHUT UP"" repeatedly to the tv screen, the film has engaged me, but not necessarily in a way one would prefer - meaning sympathizing with the main characters.",1491264000,6,1325,4.415637860082304

Having traveled to a third-world country in the midst of a revolution, I could really see this happening, and being a mother, I could really feel how this incredible predicament would throw me into primal instinct. All of the adrenaline and survival intinct kicks in for almost the entire length of the movie - I say, you will be on the edge of your seat. So, get your goodies and all of your creature comforts, get yourself as comfortable as possible and take it in.",1488499200,3,553,4.431372549019608

The only thing I didn't like was the slo-mo, which I consider as annoying as jerky-cam. But it wasn't overdone. Over all a movie worth watching.",1487894400,,311,4.672727272727273

7391524,4,B014GDAVLE,"4 1/2 stars! This film is relentless in portraying the horror from the point of view of an innocent American family of 4 moving to SE Asia. Owen Wilson has taken a new job, and hopes for the best in this big adventure. Apparently, his wife and kids had to be convinced to make the big move. Unfortunately, the family arrives exactly at the outbreak of a brutal coup and uprising. The terror is presented very realistically, the sound design is very effective in conveying confusion and ""blanking out"", the cinematography is excellent, and it was filmed entirely in Thailand ( so, the ""sets"" are real). The action moves continuously and fast, the story is told very effectively. This can almost be described as a horror film, though most would say it is a thriller.

The only false note in this film is the ""magical"" appearance by Pierce Brosnan  to save the day at several convenient points. He serves as a savior and as an ""explainer"" for what is happening. Not very convincing that this is realistic. It does make the viewer realize that this, after all, is a movie. So, the Pierce Brosnan character should have been incorporated in a more subtle fashion. It would have elevated this film to a 5 star rating.

Some reviewers complain that the film makers are glorifying the American family as ""the good guys"" for no apparent reason, and dismiss the film on that basis. I disagree greatly with that complaint. Rather, I see this film in the context of a Hitchcockian thriller film: an  innocent family is thrown into a situation not of their making. How do they survive?",1487548800,,1571,4.6606498194945845
7391525,5,B014GDAVLE,I'm not an Owen Wilson fan. In fact I never even heard of the movie until the ticket was bought. I'm an action movie horror junkie. Nothing gets me not even when Glenn died. I cried like a baby and held my friends hand almost the whole way through the movie this was way under rated as a film and completely blew me away. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!

Unrealistic, you say.  When were you ever in a situation like this?  Have you left the comfort of you recliner recently?  I am a fan of this movie.  It was emotional, thrilling, suspenseful and action packed.  Viewers please remember this is a movie.  Yes, there has to be authenticity and accuracy but these screenplays are written for entertainment purposes and No Escape, did just that.

7391579,4,B014GDAVLE,"I was inclined to give it three stars, but rounded it up to four anyway ('tis Christmas season).  Owen Wilson does a credible job as the all-American family man, the dutiful cog in the US corporate machine, sent to do business in an unidentified southeast Asian country, caught up in an anti-foreigner coup and forced to flee for the lives of himself and said all-American family.  The reasons for the murderous rampage are obscure, but obviously a modern knock-off on the Khmer Rouge with the locale a stand-in for Cambodia.  Running to the Vietnamese border across the river lets one know the location is not Thailand, though the film is shot there using Thai actors.  Unintended humor was provided at the end (spoiler alert!): running to the riverbank, to climb into the boat for crossing the hypothetical Mekong, it's raining like a monsoon.  Cut to the family paddling across, no rain, calm river, excellent canoeing weather.  Approaching the Vietnamese side the sentry shouts at them in English: credible enough, given their blonde, Caucasian appearance, until he also screams in English at the Khmer/Thai pursuers - and they back off in full comprehension.  Oh, well, Academy-Award winning stuff it's not, including Pierce Brosnan's bit role as the CIA rogue who in the end gives his life for fellow Americans.  As usual, the deleted scenes should have been included, as useful plot elements were per always left on the cutting floor.",1480377600,,1441,5.0

I'm probably one of the few, but I think Owen Wilson does much better in serious action movies than funny movies.  Behind Enemy Lines is one of my favorites and I've been waiting for a serious one from him for a while, lets hope it's not the last.  Some of the action scenes were a tiny bit corny in that you wouldn't expect this regular non military dude to do some of the stuff he does, but please suspend reality a bit and just enjoy it.  The ending was powerful and satisfying.",1472256000,,549,4.1415094339622645

This was an ultra thrilling movie that kept me on edge the entire time it was on. Wilson played a perfect serious roll and perhaps was his best performance to date. The movie is believable and full of suspense and was well written.  Filmed in South East Asia, the plot and story was fantastic about a family who moved to the area that was hit with turmoil.

7391717,1,B014GDAVLE,"This is the worst racist trash I have ever seen. If Vietnam is just over the border, and the people are talking Thai, or Laotian, which are similar, (they are actually speaking Thai,) then it is Laos, only they are dressed and look like Cambodians. So the film makers have no clue about the differences in these distinct cultures and simply don't give a rat's rear. Why should the filmmakers even bother to consider this anyway. Who cares? All those heathen idle worshipers all look the same anyway, right? And all Asians, especially ones from ""exotic"" countries we don't know a lot about, are savage, scary, and brutal. Imagine a Japanese family trying to escape to asylum in Mexico and all the white people trying to kill them speak French, but dress in Bavarian shorts. It is just so ridiculous and downright ignorant, it is shocking. You might be able to overlook this if the movie was good despite this, but it sucks in every other way as well. It is just another one of those movies that confirms the idea that the foreign world is a scary, dangerous place full of barbarians.

7391769,2,B014GDAVLE,"This film has many flaws that are plain to see from the beginning. Some of them, remarkable enough, are the following:
1) Obviously, the director has not the slightest idea about staging a coup dtat or how a coup really works. First of all, whether a coup succeeds or not, there is a declaration of martial law and of a state of siege or a state of war, which implies that the main streets and key places of a capital city are taken by the army and the police, along with a curfew and the will to control the capital at all cost. Instead, against all odds, we find that there is not a single military unit patrolling the city, no control posts, no armoured vehicles anywhere, no air force flying over the city, etc. So the morning after the prime minister has been assassinated, Owen Wilson simply wakes up and finds that the capital city is smooth and calm and that he can walk freely all over the market place to find a newspaper. Of course, there are no warnings whatsoever about the political situation, no telephone calls, no messages from the US embassy and no armed force at the hotel to protect and eventually evacuate the foreign tourists. Admitting that this is not really a coup dtat, but a rabble revolution, there are not violent clashes anywhere between the armed forces and the insurgents, except for a short demonstration against the police at the beginning, when Wilson is caught between two fires. And, of course, in the heat of all the blind fury provoked by this violent popular uprising, the border with Vietnam is completely unguarded, or so it seems. Incredible.
2) The causes of the coup are so obscure that one cannot even guess why this mad rage happens. We are told that Cardiff is a company that builds water plants in Third World countries, but there is a constant innuendo about its evil machinations. Of course, we never know what those machinations are anyway. One might think: but a water plant is something good for the people, right? How could it be the reason for such boundless hatred against foreign corporations? Unless, of course, the countrys authorities have raised the price of water, imposing such exorbitant taxes that common people cannot afford them and are dying of thirst; which, being something difficult to believe in the first place, is left unexplained anyway. So we are kept in the darkest shadows the whole film, never knowing why these poor creatures (any human being, actually) have to take such pains to save their lives through a nightmarish neverending runaway. Even propaganda based on the foulest demagogy requires a bit of an explanation to become credible.
3) Violence everywhere, the most senseless, purposeless violence throughout the film, from the beginning to the end, which adds to the groundless plot.
In short, the film needed much more of a political thriller (and better constructed, as was pictured the last year in power of Sukarno in The Year of Living Dangerously) and certainly a lot less of leftist biased propaganda and carnage. A very disturbing film, by no means convincing",1463270400,3,3056,4.77882797731569

Lake Bell of In a World ?  Owen Wilson of Darjeeling Limited ?  How could these two sign a script where they beat the s*** of other people ?  Maybe the fact that Weinstein was behind this crap ?

7391840,5,B014GDAVLE,"No Escape stars Lake Bell in a tense action thriller set in south central Asia. Remington Steel or James Bond or Hammond, or whatever his cover name is helps her get her two daughters out of a city in the midst of political upheaval! The movie sets up some very tense moments with unlikely premises, like riding a moped with four people! or paddling a canoe! or throwing your kids off buildings!!!

I think we've all been there though, right? In the moment we are thinking 'maybe those last four tequila shots weren't such a good idea', 'maybe I shouldn't be doing this', but then we remember ""Hey its OK to toss my kid of a building if I wrapped my belt around her, she'll be safe, its a like a seat belt for pedestrians! What could go wrong?"" Regardless of the guy from Bottle Rockets parenting skills, oh yeah, I forgot that part, Bottle Rocket guy is in this too, they manage to navigate the dangers of the city to thrilling effect. (also, never cross Bottle Rocket guy when there is a desk lamp around. Just. Don't.)

The fact that Lake Bell and Bottle Rocket are married is by far the most outlandish premise this movie puts forth, although they do fairly well mixing it up and have OK chemistry. The story gives them a few downbeats between the guns and explosions and tip-toe moped scenes to play up their family ties and personal relationship.

I was glad to see Lake Bell working her acting chops here, trying to be a proud mother lioness while still being scared s***less. She is really coming into her own, getting some interesting characters under her belt and I'm looking forward to her future rolls.

Life lessons I took away from this film:
1. Dwarf Tossing is a valid, nay necessary pastime/hobby
2. You might be able to buy a boat with your shoes, So always wear fresh kicks! Bottle Rockets wearing Saucony or some junk. Had he been kicking some fresh Pumas, he could a scored a speed boat!
3. Fear Trucks
4. Fear Desk Lamps
5. Lake bell can murder you with a cane-sized stick
6. Kenny Rogers has really hit a career low, but damn is he a good shot.

7391844,2,B014GDAVLE,"This movie was 143 minutes of machetes and guns. People were getting killed left and right. There was very little character development besides this is a family and we should root for them because they are a family. Seriously, they are chased for the whole movie and everyone besides them gets killed. Everyone. I liked Owen Wilson in Behind Enemy Lines but that movie had a story as well as action. No Escape is just bloody action. I wish it could have been better.",1459641600,,466,4.559523809523809
7391845,5,B014GDAVLE,"No Escape is a survival film, an American family who stand out like a sore thumb amongst Asian faces must escape murderers and rioters  determined to kill them because of the company their father works for.  Jack (Owen Wilson) is that father and his family certainly have a lot of the negative character traits of the ""American tourist"", for example his wife brought a large rice cooker in her luggage, even though as Jack points out, I'm pretty sure they know how to cook rice here.  ""But they don't cook it my way"" is her response.  They aren't knowledgeable at all about the country they have come to live in let alone the fact that it is on the verge of a civil war, (we are never told what country that is, we know it's next to Vietnam but the fact the locals speak different South East Asian dialect at times means its probably supposed to intentionally be a fictional one).  Jack goes out on the first morning after their arrival to get an American newspaper and ends up inbetween a deadly violent battle between riot police and an angry mob.  He survives and makes his way back to what he assumes will be the safety of his hotel only to witness an arrogant ""I'm an American let me inside"" type responded to by a gun being placed against his head and the trigger pulled.  The hotel is about to be overrun and Jack's family is inside.  Will he or any of his family make it to safety alive?

At times the family is a little annoying.  Both the wife and daughters do stupid things throughout that jeopardise everyone around them's safety.  You're constantly yelling at the screen, ""Jack tell them to shut up, the only way you'll survive is if the bad guys don't know you're there!"" Talking loudly or even in English is obvious not something anyone should be doing.  But they are kids who have obviously led a very sheltered life without much consequences for misbehavior up to this moment, so it is actually probably pretty plausible behaviour on their parts.  Annie (the wife) well perhaps she's just not that bright.  Jack himself does ridiculous things like leave his belt behind which even if he wouldn't use it as a weapon, at least could have been used as tourniquet if one of them loses a limb against a machete wielding pursuer.

I enjoyed the movie.  It has the whole what would you do factor going on. Once it gets going the tension never really drops off, which is what you want with this type of movie. Spoilers follow - The ending was a little convenient.  Would the border (and a part of the border with armed personnel) be just a couple of minutes away from the center of a major city, especially one likely to be either the capital or major one since it contains the country's US Embassy?  Sure they would likely speak English to white people on a boat, but would they speak English to an angry Asian mob in pursuit.  Would they really say we would consider it an act of war?  Wouldn't they more likely say, you fire at them, we'll fire at you, you're all lit up under our spotlights and we won't miss! Or something like that.  I think the family would likely have been shot dead at a number of stages throughout, especially while on the moped. They should have picked up the helicopter gunman's machine gun and other weapons early on. But as it is, these kids are going to need a lot of support and professional help if they are going to lead any sort of depression/drug addiction free life.

Highly recommended movie to at least watch once!",1459555200,,3462,4.461904761904762

7391882,5,B014GDAVLE,"I love it when a movie sneaks up on me and is so much better than I expected. I only saw a couple ads for this film and thought it was just going to be an average action movie. It was way beyond my expectations. It was a tense, suspenseful, action packed thriller that had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. There were times I honestly didn't know what was going to happen.

It's basically a story of an American family landing in some unnamed Eastern Asian country that is politically unstable. Soon after the family lands there is a political overthrow of the government and the rebels are especially angered by the American company and it's workers who are exploiting the countries resources for their own financial gain, unbeknownst to the primary male character (played by Owen Wilson) who has just relocated there to work for this company. The family attempts to escape from this country before the rebels can kill them.

I loved how realistically the filmmakers approached this story. In countries that are politically unstable and generally hate Westerners, especially Americans, what is shown in the film is very true to life. Anyone who believes otherwise is very nave and clearly doesn't watch the international news. Many people have experienced similar circumstances, or worse, in real life. My thanks to the film makers for creating an entertaining film that realistically addresses this subject matter without resorting to far-fetched theatrics to sell an already brilliantly written story.",1457913600,,1524,4.996062992125984

7391884,4,B014GDAVLE,"We really enjoyed this movie. Nonstop action and tension - plenty of bang for our streaming buck. I was surprised by how well Owen Wilson pulled off a dramatic role here and while I desperately want this man to get a haircut already, he felt like a father reaching deep to find some courage and strength in a desperate situation. The woman playing the wife here isn't a great actress - the chemistry between her and Wilson was lackluster.

Having been to a few places in Southeast Asia, I can see how easy it might be to find yourself suddenly engulfed in a riot or worse with no clue it was coming. The sense of close quarters and crowding in the movie was well portrayed - zig zagging through a maze of alleys and dead ends in a monsoon at night, yeah that's scary enough without homicidal gangs chasing you. No Escape is well worth watching on a Saturday night.",1457827200,,864,4.4

From the start of No Escape I was on the edge of my seat.  I related knowingly from experiences landing in a foreign country where no one speaks your language and trust comes (for better or worse) simply because someone can communicate with you.  My heart pounded as I watched the characters fight for survival while the husband and wife clashed over what the next move should be.  When the movie finished my knees were shaking and I immediately went to google maps to figure out how far our embassy is from where we live.

When I received this blu-ray it was suppose to have an Ultra Violet code included..... which it did; unfortunately it was an Ultra Violet code for Great Britain and Europe, unusable in the states. So I returned the blu-ray and now I'm afraid that maybe all the copies of this film are that way.

7392024,3,B014GDAVLE,"Owen Wilson & Lake Bell are good at comedy and the transition to drama is difficult. Tom Hanks is one of the few who managed to make this transition. In No Escape, these actors do a credible job in serious roles. The movie will keep you riveted as the family goes from dire straits to more dire straits.

Their elder daughter was a giant pain in the rear by not cooperating the entire movie despite knowing that she was being chased by killers I found that a bit unrealistic since I would think that children who are exposed to scores of dead bodies, bullets flying everywhere and bombs going off not to mention Mom & Dad bleeding, wounded, & seriously stressed out would be frightened and so rely on Mom & Dad's directions. I got so tired of Owen Wilson & Lake Bell needing to plead with their daughters to please, please, do what they said.

I found the scenario (political climate turning on a dime) to be plausible but not for the reasons cited. I don't think that the city's occupants would riot in anticipation of an event (private American company managing the water utilities); rather, they would riot over their needs not being met - water being to expensive to afford or being deprived of water. Also, the wholesale slaughter of Americans would probably not occur when the Americans could be used as hostages and bargaining chips.

How do they escape from a land where all hands are against them?.  The border is conveniently close, but, all in all, this is a great film.

7392091,4,B014GDAVLE,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

The best thing about thrillers is that we get to experience something without having to actually live it. The bad thing is that in doing so there are moments when you can get so frustrated with the action taking place on screen that you find yourself yelling out loud. A friend of mine actually did this in a theater once while we watched HALLOWEEN. I found myself doing it while watching NO ESCAPE this week. If you missed it in the theaters this thriller kicks off fast and never lets up until the very end. It establishes the story early on and rather quickly before shooting off full blast into the action.

Owen Wilson is Jack Dwyer, a down on his luck engineer who has taken a job with a mega-company and is moving his family to a small Southeast Asian country (its never identified what country). With his wife Annie (Lake Bell) and two daughters Lucy (Sterling Jerins) and Beeze (Claire Geare) in tow there plane ride is uneventful and they make a friend in another passenger named Hammond (Pierce Brosnan). After arriving he helps them with a ride to their hotel and parts ways with them.

After little sleep Jack heads out to buy a newspaper. While out and about, he finds himself in the midst of a coupe taking place in the country (which we saw begin in a short prequel of events as the film opened). Heading back to the hotel and his family, Jack watches as Americans are caught and slaughtered in the streets outside. He eventually finds a way in and heads up to his room. Along the way he runs into Hammond who helps him and then tells him to get the family to the roof.

Jack gets back only to discover Lucy is in the pool. After rounding her up the family heads for the roof. And here is where as viewers we become the most frustrated and excited. The two girls (who appear to be about 8 and 10) seem to be the most uncooperative children one could find in a movie. Running from bad guys shooting at the family, Beeze drops her teddy bear and screams to go back for it. Not long after that Lucy refuses to listen to her father in a tense situation as he tries to save the family that nearly results in both of them dying. The movie has several of these moments and all will increase your blood pressure.

As the film progresses the family moves from one danger to another. In a country where they know no one, never met anyone from the company Jack was hired by yet and where the rebels now in charge view them as invaders trying to take over their land the odds of their getting out alive seem sparse. A few decent people help them now and then as they continue to try and stay one step ahead of the rebels and another chance run in with Hammond and his sidekick Kenny (Sahajak Boonthanakit) gives them the only respite they find in their quest to escape. The rest of the film is one that keeps you on the edge of your seat with your fingers working into the arm rest of your chair.

But is it a good movie? Well honestly yes, it is. All of the action promised in the trailer before the movie came out is there on the screen. The most played over sequence involving leaping from one building to another happens early on so it isn't a case of showing the ending to viewers before they even began watching the movie. The depth of story is pretty shallow but then thats not the point of the movie. The point is a family on the run trying to stay alive. It does that story remarkably well.

While inept actors could have made this unwatchable the cast here does a good job while no one stands out above the rest. In their hands the characters are believable and that makes us as viewers comfortable with their performances and more caring about their predicament. At some point you're bound to toss your hands up in the air over those kids but the fact that as young actresses they can make you feel that is a credit to their performances.
In the end this movie is one that is worth renting and for action fans one worth adding to your collection. It delivers the goods in spades. The only people who might not want to watch? Anyone with a heart condition or extremely high blood pressure. This movie is good enough at what it attempts to do that it will only make you explode.",1453334400,,4247,4.321204516938519
7392092,5,B014GDAVLE,Excellent,1453334400,,9,9.0
7392093,4,B014GDAVLE,"It's rare these days for a movie to keep you on the edge of your seat, actually not sure whether any of the lead characters will survive. Too often, it becomes obvious partway through that the lead is just ""too badass"" or ""too important"" to be sacrificed. This movie deprived me of any such assurance, up to the very end, which of course I won't give away as either happy or tragic. True, there are traces of ""Hollywood"" action in it: last minute rescues here and there.. at least one ultra-badass character.. But each time the ending seems predictable it's snatched away again. I'd call this an action thriller, just because it's such a roller coaster.

One star short of five for: A few unrealistic stretches, and violence being such a continual theme, slightly sacrificing character development but not badly enough to detract.",1453334400,,830,4.804195804195804
7392094,3,B014GDAVLE,"I admit I stayed away from this movie when it hit the theaters in the late summer of 15.  Primarily because of poor to mediocre reviews.  Hey theres only so many movies I can see.  Reconsidering, most of the reviews I saw complained about supposed xenophobia and even racism.  But I don't remember much about the actual quality of the movie.  So heres a nice Blu ray version to watch.

The setting is an unnamed country somewhere in Southeast Asia.  We learn that it has a river that leads to Vietnam so it must be Cambodia or Laos, right (filmed in Thailand)?  It doesnt matter I guess.  I just like to get my bearings.  In any case, Jack Dwyer (Owen Wilson, The Internship) is an engineer who invented some kind of valve, but his Austin, Texas company went bankrupt.  So he gets a job with an international company that builds water plants in developing countries.

Now instead of going there and doing a look-see first, Jack packs up his wife, Annie (Lake Bell, Black Rock) and 2 little girls (Sterling Jerins and Claire Geare) and heads out sight unseen.  Bad move, Jack.  Seemingly unknown to the American State Department and Jacks company, the country is on the verge of being overthrown.  While Jack and his family are ensconced in a hotel (with services not working), he heads out to find a newspaper.  What he finds is a violent and bloody confrontation between the police and a larger mob of rebels.  Caught in the middle, he barely escapes but the victorious rebels are out to kill Westerners and anyone who gets between them.

The rest of the movie is a tense escape where it appears Jack and his family are targets.  Pierce Brosnan plays a secretive character, Jack and his family meet at the airport.  He also stays at the hotel and gets the family out of a jam more than once.  One of the things that surprised me is that the 2 girls in the film are confronted with some scary stuff.  That fact Im sure had to be moderated when the young actresses performed their craft.  The pair are amazingly authentic which adds another layer of dread while watching the film.  The adults are very good as well, although I did have a hard time convincing myself that Owen Wilson is an action character.  But thats on me.  He was very credible.

There are too many escape coincidences and plot holes to take the film too seriously.  And we never learn exactly what was going on in the government or Jacks new companys role.  What we have here is a thrilling escape film with plenty of visceral images, brutality and death.  As far as the xenophobia criticism some had, I didn't see it.  While the bad guys are clearly despicable Asia thugs, there are plenty of locals who help Jack and his family along the way.

The Blu ray disc comes in a 1080p video resolution with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  As far as the quality of the images, I would suggest they are very good, but far from ideal.  Its hard to put my finger on it but the entire film seems to be under-lit.  While the color definition is fine, the black levels are wanting on occasion.  Everything else is good.  I doubt most people will have a problem with the video quality.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is excellent.  The film is full of explosions, gunfire, helicopter crashes, flying debris and so forth, so all the speakers and sub(s) will get some exercise.  Dialog is clear and well-focused.  An excellent musical scores add to the excitement.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include an audio commentary track with writer/director John Erick Dowdle and writer/producer Drew Dowdle.  In addition there are a couple deleted scenes and 4 short behind the scene pieces.",1453334400,3,3665,4.580893682588598

The premise was good, and some of the execution of it had okay moments, but everything was dreadfully predictable and boring, and the bad moments were just too bad to overlook and just made the whole thing such a drag to watch.
I found myself wanting to skip over the worst bits and having to remind myself that I wasted money renting this thing and should watch it through.

It might have been a more enjoyable movie if it came out in the 80's. A lot of the more hammy tropes in it felt very 80's like. Hammond was actually enjoyable, although such a ridiculously executed overly convenient plot device. It just doesn't work nowadays like it did in the 80's or 90's, the standards are different. I don't know how they suckered him into working in this movie.

Also, I'm at least glad that one of the kids, the little one, was ok. The older one was so unbearably annoying that it's a wonder she didn't get them killed right away at the first sign of difficulty. It's not because she's a kid that she gets a free pass at being this annoying. She was a higher liability for the family's survival throughout the movie than the enemy guerrilla wandering around.

into a war-zone there is an uprising.
The rebels are killing both the establishment and any foreign resident or holiday-maker they happen across ...in unfamiliar
surroundings the situation becomes increasingly desperate as 'Jack' try's to get his family out of harms way.
The family have but one ally - 'Hammond' (Pierce Brosnan) who they'd met on the flight over, he is a regular visitor to the location
and has friends there, he also knows his way around, he seemingly will become the 'Dwyer' family's only hope, but is it enough ?
Against all that they believe in 'Jack' and 'Annie' will have to meet violence with violence if they are to survive...it's become a desperate struggle.....is there any chance of escape at all ??
Must admit i've not seen 'Owen Wilson' in anything but a comedy role before, quite an eye-opener so to speak for me.....
have to say his role, trying to protect his family is pretty convincing.

7392147,5,B014GDAVLE,"I was pleasantly surprised at this movie. I found it enjoyable and a bit set in reality as this probably has happened before more than once. Once moving abroad to a South Asian Country with his company, (Owen's character) and his family settle in. Low and behold, a political uprising takes place and he must protect his family, his wife and his two daughters at every turn. Fighting for his very survival and theirs he meets a ""friend"" (Pierce Brosnan) and his aide. They will risk their very lives to seek asylum in neighboring Vietnam. This is one movie you should not miss! I wouldn't recommend it though for the kids under 13 as it is pretty violent. Intense suspense and action. If this is your type of movie, you cannot miss!

I only didn't give it 5 stars because I save those for the most exceptional movies  I liked how Wilson played a different role in this than his typical, and I think he plays vulnerable and struggling to survive best.

SPOILER ALERT:  How this family survives, pulls together and survives under insurmountable odds is incredible but believable. Luck, guts, strength all play a part. Owen Wilson has great range and wish I could see him in more - he can do comedy, drama and is terrific. The rest of the cast was amazing and it all stayed believable and yes this kind of thing can really happen. It's frightening in that sense but the will to survive surmounts all and this family just will not give in and through cleverness and willpower they amazed me.

7392180,4,B014GDAVLE,"Although Owen Wilson has done some dramatic roles, we tend to think of him as starring in quirky comedies yet Wilson shines in NO ESCAPE as a desperate man trying to save his family. NO ESCAPE has an interesting premise. What if you move your family to an exotic Asian country just as a bloody coup is underway? Foreigners are being executed on sight by the rebels. Even the locals are not safe. What would you do?

Jack Dwyer (Wilson) moves his family to an unnamed southeast Asia country to start a new life and career. His wife Annie seems only mildly supportive of uprooting their family that includes 2 young daughters. They are immediately trapped in the mayhem and chaos of the coup. Dwyer innocently takes a stroll from the hotel to buy a newspaper and is caught up in the violence. It's here that we see the story unfold as we wonder what any of us would do in such a situation. Annie (Lake Bell) and her daughters are in danger as the rebels enter the hotel and being breaking down doors and killing anyone in sight. It is gruesome and violent. It's time for Jack and his family to find safety at the US Embassy but is anyplace safe?  One hard to believe aspect is there is a coup going on outside the hotel staffers seem oblivious to any problems. New must travel slowly.
It was good seeing one of my favorites Pierce Brosnan as a mysterious businessman who befriends the family on the plan and to the hotel. There could be a whole movie in Brosnan's character and his Asian sidekick who goes by the name of ""Kenny Rogers"" (yes, that Kenny Rogers).
I don't believe the country is named but from the clues, it would be Cambodia since Vietnam is ""across the river"".  NO ESCAPE was filmed in Thailand but we don't get to see any beautiful scenery since the film is set in a big city.
The action is tense and the family tries to outrun the rebels. As foreigners, they stand out in the crowd and have to find ways to mingle or hide among the locals. It's a great adventure though the film is not without flaws. Lake Bell is a bit dry as the mother until the action begins and she becomes the woman determined to protect her family. This is Wilson's film and the man is remarkable. This is not the slow moving, shuffling actor in his various comedies. He puts meat into this dramatic role. Pierce Brosnan also stands out as the aging man of mystery.
NO ESCAPE is definitely worth a watch if you like political dramas and action thriller films. Owen Wilson really shines in NO ESCAPE.",1451347200,,2488,4.404347826086957

7392182,5,B014GDAVLE,"An action-packed suspenseful film with great acting all round. Other reviewers have described the story in more detail, but in a nutshell - US family in the wrong place at just the wrong time have to fight for survival over a 24 period since arriving in their new home in Southeast Asian country the same day as a bloody revolution explodes. There are no great heroics from Owen's character, just the actions of a man desperate to keep his family alive. I found his acting to be spot on - from the look of fears in the elevator, the stress hitting him later and the realization of the horrors he witnesses and must unwillingly participate in. Brosnan plays an interesting character and adds a little twist with his condemnation of the system that employs both him, and ultimately Owen, which makes you think. However, his reasoning, although potentially holding water, does not explain why the atrocities seem to be occurring randomly around them.
Overall, a good film although it is not suitable at all for younger audiences",1451260800,,1025,4.796610169491525

7392189,5,B014GDAVLE,"I absolutely loved this movie which was unexpected.  I'm shocked that some reviewers didn't care for it. I can't see how a poor review is possible.  The storyline was so intense with non-stop action and suspense which endured to the very end.  You rooted so hard for this family. It makes one think twice about international travel, especially to a 4th world country and the vulnerability that presents when outside of the USA.  Such a constant struggle for this family and the gripping decisions they had to make to stay alive, especially persevering with two children.  I was impressed with the acting of Owen Wilson and being new to Lake, it to me a bit to remember where I had seen her as her role was such a striking contrast to her performance in ""It's Complicated.""

DISCLAIMER:
This was an exceptionally hard movie to watch. I'm a well travelled person, and I give this review despite my contempt for the typical xenophobia of this sort of film. (special props to the milagro bean field war, the killing fields, beyond rangoon). moreover, I have only known the people of that region (CAM/LAO), to be the most kind, most resilient, and the most wise about the horrors of war. if ever I was to be caught in an insurrection, I would fear less there, than I would here.
BUT.
this movie could happen somewhere~ and stripped of its cultural baggage, which is some, but not much~ it's a touching, and terrifying story about what a family must endure to survive overwhelming adversity. the acting, and writing was excellent, and the direction, though a little gratuitous, was good. May there be peace in the world. may love always take in strangers and conquer evil. may no more innocent have to die. and honestly, if this wasn't about a white family, it happens everyday.",1450915200,,1048,4.6702702702702705

The movie started out good, it was actually pretty hard to watch given the recent terror attacks such as Paris. Nothing turns my stomach more than innocent men, woman and children being murdered by savages, I hate it with a passion. However, the idiotic narrative behind this movie made me want to vomit.

  At one point, Brosnan has a little heart to heart with Owen and tells him not to thank him for  saving his life, because after all it was actually Brosnans fault in the first place for aiding the ""evil corporations"" in pillaging the country. Not only that, the people that were hacking women to death with machetes a short time earlier were ""just like you and me"", and were just trying to protect their families from the evil corporations that were oppressing them. Yes Peirce, the normal everyday American and Brit go out and hack innocent families to death with machetes when we feel we are being oppressed by Corporations building water plants, screw you Peirce.

The basic idea of an American family caught up in a local revolution is not only is plausible but very relevant in light of recent headlines.  The director keeps you on the seat edge for virtually the entire film.  My only gripe was a brief but ham fisted speech by Pierce Brosnan making sure to blame Americans and US policy for the revolutionaries actions.  Did the director really need to pander to Hollywood politics with a perfunctory out of context speech inserted in the film like an item on a checklist.

Pierce Brosnan has always been one of my least favorite actors, but in this movie he really nails the role of.....well....I will not spoil it. It is very violent and bloody, and in ways horrifying, but without insect aliens or zombies. No, the monsters in this horrifying flick are human. I am one of those people who love to take a long shot with movies that I think may be great. And I am USUALLY, but not always right.

7392308,1,B014GDAVLE,"There is so much Deus EX Machina contriving in this P.O.S. that I wanted to gag.  I only saw this movie through because my guests wanted to.

I strongly suggest that you stay away from ""No Escape"". It contains mostly gratuitous violence. It has no plot, no clever twists of interest. And it's filled with the usual Hollywood cinematic clichs. While ordinary people get slaughtered, our hero, unarmed and towing a timid wife and two very upset small children, manages to evade a virtual army of people determined to kill him and to wipe out thousands of people in the immediate surrounds. We have to believe that the main characters are better at hiding, better at hand to hand fighting, braver and smarter than the thousands who die in close proximity all around them. Much of the action is filmed in the dark and I found hard to follow because we refused to turn out the lights for fear of nightmares.  Actually the whole movie was a nightmare.  It went the gamut from boring, linear and predictable to disgusting and disturbing. The final straw was the sacrifice of their savior, Pierce Brosnan, who blocked an enemy car with his body and a well placed shot, dying in the process, probably to atone for his sins as a CIA operative. Too bad because he was the only passable acting in the whole mess.  Unfortunately he was saddled with the task of pushing a totally overt, in your face political message that industrial countries assist third world countries with infrastructure and medical care solely to benefit by systematically pillaging and raping their economies. Sure, some of that goes on but the overplay of this issue was barefaced and revolting.

This was a complete waste of two unpleasant hours. I will avoid anything from this director again.  I suggest you not see this cinematic garbage unless you are completely masochistic and have not had your daily quota of boredom and pain.",1449100800,7,1895,4.759146341463414

7392485,3,B014GDAVLE,"Very intense movie. I would not recommend it for families. I am not sure what the hidden message in it is. The ending seemed to indicate that large  corporations and countries combined to start Civil disruption in order to take over control of smaller countries. This seems somewhat far fetched. Many large companies seem to be doing just the opposite such as GM, McDonald's and others who have moved into China and other countries. Even Walmart is international and has very large stores in Mexico. It seems like the writers were trying to push a hidden agenda. Another point is that Owen Wilson's family went into an Asian country that was under siege and no one contacted them to tell them to get out. Does this mean they were expendable?? Also they met a British man who suddenly appears at the end of the film after people are being slaughtered to help the family.

One star is deducted because I think this movie could have been even better if we'd have had a bit more of the backstory. Accepting a job in a foreign location, an important enough job that his face is on a welcome banner. A coup occurs and we can get the basic understanding that the people taking control aren't happy with foreigners but they don't seem to be too thrilled with the locals either. A couple of obvious liberties with the technical capabilities of a handgun, even caused me to ask - can he really shoot that far with a handgun?

7392536,3,B014GDAVLE,"When I saw this trailer the first thing that came to mind, are the producers crazy? This film stars two aging actors well passed their prime (if they even had one). Owen Wilson in the lead and an old James... I mean Peirce Brosnan playing a supporting role. One could usually assume when seeing a trailer including Owen Wilson, this will be a sub-par comedy and Vince Vaughn is likely to pop up somewhere. When you see Peirce show boating the British accent that could only mean one thing, here comes the James Bond recycled scraps lost in a 90's time machine. Surprisingly,(and thankfully) none of the above is present.

So Jack and Annie Dwyer take their two kids, Lucy and Beeze, on a field trip to Cambodia. At least that's what were lead to believe seeing as the country is never mentioned in the short yet intense film. Jack has been jobless for a while (again, we are assuming) and gets a job for a water company abroad. Once arrived they are un-greeted and have no contact with the new company. After a strange night in a beautiful hotel with faulty wiring and no working televisions or telephones, jack decides to wake up early and go get a USA today news paper. This proves foolish as an uprising occurs as he is out as we will later find is a direct result of the scam his company is running.

Lake bell plays the wife Annie here and this was yet another piece of this movie that turned me off before even seeing it. Bell seems to be un-inspired and underwhelming in every role she does, but surprisingly, she does very well here for most of the movie. It was almost a bigger surprise when Wilson hadn't done or said anything completely out of place through most of the film. Yes. Lake Bell and Owen Wilson did an action movie of all things and somehow pulled it off. Pretty nicely I might add. The characters, although severely under developed, all work relatively well here especially Brosnan. This is the first role I have seen Peirce play in a long time where I didn't reference in my head once, James Bond. This is his first stand alone and truly gritty performance in ages. Except when he tells Jack who he works for... I bet you can guess.

Overall This movie is very entertaining and well done. There are moments of true thrills which I did not expect, and surely, neither will you. The movie, however, will not be winning an Oscar anytime soon as the characters are severely under developed and we don't even know where they are! The bottom line is if you take this movie for what it is (a 103 minute adrenaline rush) you will not be disappointed. You might actually be pleasantly surprised in the stand out performances from un-likely sources. It's worth mentioning that the film has taken some flak about being a one dimensional tale that makes white skin good, and dark skin bad. I don't hold much water in that assessment though as throughout the film we see many natives of the area reach out to help the family, but, that's just how I saw it.",1448582400,,2968,4.472324723247232

In this movie, the soldiers are just going after any and everybody, even white Americans and hotel staff. Hmmmm...that's a great way to win hearts and minds! That's pretty much just asking for the US Navy, Air Force and Marines to make a speedy and violent visit to your country and end your revolution. Also, why the heck would revolutionaries kill the hotel staff? That would make a lot of the locals on your side angry, don't you think?

Pierce Brosnan is also barely in the film. Owen Wilson and Lake Bell are completely annoying and talentless. Lake Bell's character is always crying for no reason, and it gets annoying after a while. She's just terrible and ruins everything she's in.

I could truly feel my heart pound and feared for a heart attack. It is wonderful to see this normal family thrust into the roles of super heros to save their family from the terrible unrest in this new country they are moving to for Owen Wilson's job. You can't help but root for them even as you half cover your eyes because you are afraid to look at what happens next. Pierce Brosnan's character is hard to pin down which makes his character interesting. You can't really tell whose side he is on and what his motives are. Owen's wife turns out to be fierce. Of course, what mom wouldn't be in this situation? The two daughters are amazing. They are very brave. I recommend this movie for everyone because the situation could really happen. Many Americans like Owen Wilson move to another country for a job. Something could go wrong in the government and in the country they move to and that is exactly what happens in this movie.

It was quite scary and emotional not knowing whether they were going to come out alive or not! There were several close calls. The only thing that wasn't realistic was when the mom was able to sneak up behind the guy while hubby was being held by two men and a third at gunpoint. The idea that she could sneak up behind the gunman without the other two men not seeing her wasn't realistic. It made for quite an exciting rescue though. Glad they made it to safety finally.

7392628,5,B014GDAVLE,"***Potential Spoiler Alert***  With the recent Paris, Beruit and Russian attacks one cannot but help marvel at how insulated a culture America is. We really can go about our daily lives with only a passing reflection on the state of the world, usually generated by a spike in oil prices or some other commodity disruption the genesis of which we can hardly name let alone articulate in detail. Some may argue that is a testament to the American way of life, and in some respects I cannot disagree. In other respects, a reflective person can't but help to pause and contemplate Americas current standing in the world. Is it manifest destiny writ large or do we lay a heavy global hand or is it, like most things in life, somewhere in between? These are the thoughts that occurred to me during a movie in which such questions are only hinted at in the final climatic scenes. Well, hinted is putting it lightly, Pierce Brosnan spells it out for those unfamilair with criticism of IMF and World Bank policies. Hint, it smells of economic hit man. In my opinion this theme alone makes the movie worth a watch but do you know what actually hit me harder? The lengths to which a man and a woman may go to secure the survival of their family, their children. Talk about a nail biter. I think I jumped up from that couch at one point. Here lies the reality check. What if those perpetrating the atrocities you will witness in this film believe they are doing what is necessary for their families survival and prosperity. What then? To me the ultimate question of this film is, how do we secure the prosperity and interests of our own families, while respecting those very same interests of the people we collide with along the way? Don't get me wrong, placed in the same situation I would have blood on my hands. The question is, how do we avoid getting to that place in the first place.",1447718400,4,1878,4.507331378299121

7392644,5,B014GDAVLE,"I don't know if it affected my opinion or not, but in the interest of full disclosure, I must tell you that I watched NO ESCAPE on the day after the recent terrorist attack in Paris.

That said, I found the film, directed by John Erick Dowdle, to be an excellent edge-of-the seat thriller.  Indeed, once the action begins, the tension builds and never lets up, which might be the movies one failing.  Indeed, even suspense master Alfred Hitchcock gave his audiences a breather at some point in his pictures.

In an offbeat piece of casting, Owen Wilson plays a down-on-his-luck engineer who has taken a job in an unnamed country in Southeast Asia, moving his wife (Lake Bell) and two daughters there.  Within a few hours of their arrival, the family finds itself in the middle of a deadly political uprising and they must frantically escape the merciless rebels who are close on their heels and slaughtering virtually everybody (particularly foreigners) in their path.  Helping the family along the way is Pierce Brosnan, sort of a unkempt version of James Bond, whose clandestine secret service efforts are probably responsible for the current revolution.

This highly entertaining action film was shot in Thailand.

Anchor Bay Entertainment has released NO ESCAPE, from The Weinstein Company, in a Blu-ray/DVD/Digital version.  Extras include audio commentary by director John Erick Dowdle and his writer-producer brother, Drew, two deleted scenes, plus several behind the scenes featurettes  that contain interviews with the cast ad filmmakers.

7392645,4,B014GDAVLE,"You cannot take Owen Wilson seriously, because of his past movies.
And you think that this movie will not be anything interesting because of that.
But as it turns out, apart from some scenes you totally forget that he is the actor
that he is, and you see something different, especially when he descents into the
dark places that are necessary for a human to reach in order to survive.

This is a movie of survival, of a family of four caught in the middle of a violent
coup in an S.E. Asian country. The movie is fast and does not spend a lot of
time dealing with other context apart from the fight for survival. It is a little
predictable, yet some scenes, although there is a lack of gore, are extremely savage!

Pierce Brosnan gives some additional Hollywood fame to the movie, but from the
start you know that he will be the catalyst in the movie, the deus ex machina.
And he is also the one that delivers the underline political message of the movie, that
western powers are taking advantage of countries in the worst way, and some things
are only natural to happen, even if that means brutal killings.

This is not a political movie, despite the context. This is more of a family movie
in the sense that mom and dad will move heaven and earth, and reach deep down hell
in order to protect their kids. And in that respect it works for me.

It is an intense movie, especially after trouble breaks out, and the fast pace ads
to it, and consumes the viewer into the action, and without any huge tricks by the
director.

All in all, it is a good family to watch, if you can stomach the violent scenes!

7392646,5,B014GDAVLE,"Talk about intense first 30 or so minutes (WOW)...the film opens up with a bang...you don't want to miss the opening and the first half-hour...because it is the most nail-biting thriller ride I have seen in recent years...even the opening James Bond scenes don't amount to much compared to this one.  The plot is simply amazing...I love to watch thriller-dramas with political background, and this one delivers.  Too bad, that the film is rushed.  I feel like it could have been a bit longer.  Also, certain characters could have been more developed, especially the character of `Hammond (played by Pierce Brosnan).  I also did not like certain scenes or the way they way constructed, it is as if they were not thought-out well, and seemed unbelievable.  For example, how did Hammond knew where to find the family? How did he know they were hiding in the sanctuary's garden? In addition, the casting folks chose the wrong kids for the role...yes the girls physically looked like their
mother, but they did not do a good job at presenting fear and panic at the begging...only towards the end their acting got better.  I think better set of kids could have been casted.  Other than that, this is a top-notch thriller you won't soon forget.  It will actually, make you think about your next vacation, especially if you are planning to travel to a country or region with unstable political situation.

Intense from the moment we see the riot gear until the climax. Speaking of the adversaries in this, while they're crazy, there are some useful scenes of compassion and complexity, too, from the ordinary civilians they encounter.

7392651,3,B014GDAVLE,"(Not to be confused with a 1994 action movie No Escape starring Ray Liotta.)

Directed by John Erick Dowdle (Quarantine Devil), No Escape purports to be an intense thriller with some political material. Thanks to the star Owen Wilsons effective acting, the film manages to be constantly intense, but as to its political aspect, the result is far from subtle.

Owen Wilson is Jack Dwyer, an ordinary American businessman who has just arrived in an unnamed country in Southeast Asia with his wife Annie (Lake Bell) and daughters Lucy (Sterling Jerins) and Beeze (Claire Geare). While the Dwyers are staying at a hotel, however, a coup breaks out and rebels start killing every foreigner in sight.

Though the name of the South Asian country where the story takes place is not specifically mentioned in No Escape, the film is actually shot in Thailand. While the location gives an authentic feeling to the film, it does not exactly make the horrible situations surrounding the family realistic, as things happen too fast, with no dramatic buildup to the violence.

After all, No Escape works as a pulse-pounding thriller by supplying a series of perils in which Wilsons family struggle to survive. What a mysterious British traveler Hammond (Pierce Brosnan) tells him suggests political things, but they are quickly forgotten when another shootout begins. Thus No Escape should be best enjoyed as entertainment, though those who seek a more realistic look on the subject matter will be disappointed.",1442966400,,1496,5.093877551020408

Hard to believe Vietnam was the family's sanctuary after their ordeal in this unnamed Asian country under a coup. Bosnan excellent,Wilson a total surprise to me. The wife,and kids a little unrealistic-if your life is possibly forfeit,at least move and cooperate,esp older daughter!",1442880000,,350,5.5
7392653,2,B014GDAVLE,"I would give it another star or even 5 stars but the behavior of his 2 bratty daughters had me hoping the bad guys would get them or they fell from that roof.  They constantly  screamed and yelled at all the wrong times giving away their hiding positions.  What 2 spoiled brats.  Children in colonial times,settling the West times, kids who live in hell holes around the world and inside the USA instinctively know to keep their mouths shut.  After seeing people get slaughtered and bodies everywhere, it is unrealistic to believe 2 girls this age would be yelling. It doesn't make since unless the girls have low IQs or the plot was badly written.  They dithered on jumping off the roof so long, a guy waiting to jump after them got killed.  It should have been the girl Lucy shot not the man waiting his turn.  He should have just jumped and to hell with whiny Lucy and her father.  Either way...I was rooting for the bad guys getting the girls just to shut them both up.",1442275200,4,973,4.421348314606742
7392654,3,B014GDAVLE,"Well, THAT was exhausting! We see an American family relocating to an Asian city on the Vietnam border. They no sooner arrive when we see a well-executed assassination and a shocking suicide immediately followed by a bloody coup d'etat which throws the city into turmoil. The crisis is magnified as our hero has no idea what is being said; he only reads and speaks English.

Written and directed by John Erick Dowdle with writing assistance by Drew Dowdle, both of whom are making a career out of scaring the piddle out of us (""As Above, So Below""), we could only wish for captions because so much of the dialogue is in frantic whispers as our terrified family tries to communicate in various hiding places. Hand-held camera work adds to the confusion and claustrophobia.

We watch:
  * Owen Wilson (""Midnight in Paris"") Jack is moving his reluctant family after a business venture failed; he's an engineer who invented a valve that was ""almost a big deal."" He is trying to cheer them up with the promise of an exciting time and a bulldog puppy!
  * Lake Bell (""In a World..."") Annie is hesitant to enter into this new adventure with her husband and daughters. She is horrified to see how thin is the veneer of civilization when the chips are down.
  * Pierce Brosnan (""The November Man"") Hammond is the gabby, cheerful guy who steps in to provide local color. In my opinion, his explanation of how western countries exploit eastern ones is the only thing worth the price of admission.
  * Sterling Jerins (""And So It Goes"") Lucy knows her life depends on her father but she lacks backbone.
  * Claire Geare (""Inception"") Breeze is so frightened she wets herself ... to her everlasting shame.

This R-rated movie contains nail-biting suspense, children in peril, extreme brutality and corpses by the score. It has mild profanity (the family had a ""Swear Jar"" back in Texas), no sweaty bodies and only one explosion (although cannon fire deafens them temporarily). I became so exasperated with those whimpering females I wanted to shake them, but their flakiness helped the movie run a full 103 minutes. I recoiled from the clichs near the end, which is too bad because this well-directed movie has a very strong beginning and terrific performances.",1442188800,4,2248,4.8077922077922075
