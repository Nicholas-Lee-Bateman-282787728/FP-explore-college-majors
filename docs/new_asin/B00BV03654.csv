5677442,5,B00BV03654,Must have Indy horror flick with Sid Haig (House of 1000 Corpses) and Giovanni Radice (The Omen). Go buy now!,1377475200,,109,4.5
5677443,3,B00BV03654,"first of all, the storyline for this film is a little hard to understand, and the film itself was very hard to understand, considering the nature of the subject. The story goes like this a medical student kidnaps and rapes and tortures girls in his basement and kills them. There is one of his victims that survives and he impregnates her with the hope of bringing back the childhood/family that he never had. It is hard to make sense of this guys actions and the acting of the female victim is quite believable. i found a little bit of confusion towards the end of the movie. and was glad to see the final outcome. Everybody gets what they justifiably deserve.",1372982400,2,661,4.516666666666667

8574443,5,B00BV03654,"For an Indy film that was mostly produced when the Actor/Director had both free time and money to work with, it is wonderful. The characters of David and his father have a bizarre and twisted relationship, a strange understanding of their motivations and reasons for becoming killers. Then there's the twist of several famous horror actors who traditionally play villains in the roles of heroes, you keep expecting some of them to make a sudden turn to being on the side of the serial killer, but they are not just there for camp factor.",1445817600,,537,4.723404255319149
8574444,2,B00BV03654,Very poor acting and the script was atrocious!  Certainly not worth paying to see.,1407024000,,82,4.857142857142857
8574445,3,B00BV03654,"What the....???? I can't believe my eyes! The credits read like a dream: Doug Bradley, Bill Mosely, Sid Haig, Giovanni Lombardo Radice! That's horror royalty right there. The film quality itself is not the usual horrorible substandard one. But the rest fits in quite nicely. The very first thing I noticed that was a tip off were very awkward scene transitions. Next, the ""acting""... Whoa, Nellie! Dialogue! Oh boy! But those 2 combined is what elevated it to Manos status. It literally had me bursting out laughing at times, especially during the 'copy cat' scene. Hooded guy takes hooker to a cellar, concrete walls and chicken wire abound. Some lit candles on the ground. Hooker: ""Oh, how romantic."" Guy: ""I am David O'Hara. The most wanted murderer in America.."" Hooker: ""I'm not really into that.""  Guy: "" I could rape you and bash you in the skull with this claw hammer. But I want to exercise my superior surgical skills. You are going to be known as my first bone saw victim and my first hooker kill."" ROTFLMAO  Early on, I had to rub my eyes to be sure I wasn't dreaming Sid Haig reciting the most banal discourse I could've ever imagined coming from those lips! He plays a psychiatrist though he doesn't have much screen time. The funny thing was during his first scene, the banalities (How are you feeling? Hang in there... Remember your baby needs you...etc.) he says, 'I read something about 7 corpses (or something like that) were found disemboweled (or something like that)"" as the camera zooms in on his face. I thought I detected a glimmer of glee in his eyes, which would've been more appropriate. Sid's true to type onscreen persona came out in the zoom. I wondered then if that meant anything.

I can't imagine how much money was spent on casting in this flick. Doug Bradley's character: a police detective. Giovanni: An FBI agent. (He tried to create a character at least; but there was no space for that in this film.) Bill Moseley: O'hara's father. There was only 1 line he uttered that I even remotely believed. The other actors: fughedaboudit. Gotta say though, the film is unsentimental. I appreciate that.  I think its usually a bad idea when the same person writes, directs, and stars in a film. Its hard to do all 3 right. Unless you've been doing it your whole life. Writes and directs, not so much a problem. But stars too? Hard to maintain the necessary objectivity needed for direction. Anyway, I recommend this only as a contemporary Manos. I hope that was the intention.",1402444800,2,2505,4.6863636363636365
8574446,1,B00BV03654,"sorry to be terse but my time is limited and your time is too, and that's why you should not watch this movie at all.
i'm sorry because the first scene is very intriguing, but to state it simply: the guy in the lead role just does not have the chops. He's all backward, too, for the role. His face says innocent and likeable. And his attitude is like: there is no way I would ever be charmed by this man ever.
Do yourself a favor and watch Forgetting the Girl instead.",1402444800,2,468,4.0978260869565215
8574447,1,B00BV03654,"The acting in this movie is so utterly terrible that one might almost be tempted to believe it was a spoof movie, a la Leslie Nielson style. Every bit of dialogue in the entire film sounds like the actors have never seen it before and are reading it from cue cards. The story makes absolutely no sense, and there are enough plot holes to qualify as a cinematic black hole. If you get laughs from truly horrible acting, then give this one a rent. Otherwise, avoid it like the plague.",1397088000,,482,4.366666666666666
8574448,3,B00BV03654,"Had I not known someone in the film I would most likely not have watched it..... sorry, I didn't love it.",1395878400,,105,4.0476190476190474
