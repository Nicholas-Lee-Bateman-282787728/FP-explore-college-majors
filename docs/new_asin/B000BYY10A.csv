The '79 Israeli film 'Na'arat haparvarim' (meaning; West Side Girl) has now been released on a region 1 DVD under the revised title 'Rising Star' more in keeping with the theme and intent of the film to showcase the Yemenite folksinger turned pop diva, the late Ofra Haza.

Synopsis: Vered (Ofra Haza) is a beautiful blind girl wandering the streets of Tel-Aviv selling candy, gum and cigarettes. Three good hearted young men, Avi, Sussita and Chocho, take pity on her and take Vered to their apartment for dinner. The company of three friends soon become a company of four as Avi and Vered fall in love. With the help and self sacrifice of her new friends Vered's sight is restored after an expensive operation and her amazing singing talent takes her to the top of music charts. Will she forget her old friends or will she embrace her new fame and fortune and forget about them?

'Rising Star' is by no means a good movie. Production values are low, the plot contrived, the dialogue stiff, the acting mediocre and the discoesque soundtrack badly outdated. But you know what, none of that matters. This film is all about Ofra Haza and if you are a fan you'll love it. Ths is the Ofra Haza we all want to remember forever; young, vibrant, glistening eyes and a smile to accelerate any male heart still beating. Seeing that slight figure and angelic face is an absolute treat that transcends the limitations of the film.  Add to that the fact that she sings six songs , that alone is worth the price of the DVD.",1181606400,5,1548,4.5978260869565215
