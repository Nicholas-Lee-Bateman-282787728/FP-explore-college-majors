7659852,5,B01BLCBQKS,"Overall it's a great DVD - very cute, shows great examples of teamwork and problem solving, and it's great for boys or girls.
  ~ However if your kids a fan of the old Bob the Builder there may be things that they do not like.
1. My 3 year old misses the old theme song - the new one is still catchy, but the old version is what he knows.
2. Rolly is his favorite machine and he is barely in this one. Also while scoop, muck, and lofty look pretty cool - Rolly and dizzy could have been done better.
3. In the old version Muck has a girl's voice and in the new version it's now a male's voice.
4. Bob now sounds more American and has an apprentice named Leo. (Wendy is still there)
5. There are also short mini clips in between the main episodes.

EPISODES:
1. Scoop and the slide
  ~ mini meet the team clip with Leo
2. City Beach
  ~ mini clip learn with Leo
3. Saffi's TreeHouse
  ~ mini clip with Wendy
4. Wind and Shine
  ~ mini clip with Bob and Leo
5. Bob and the Masked Biker
  ~ mini clip with Bob and Tiny the crane
6. Scoop Cries Wolf",1472169600,2,1045,3.919047619047619
