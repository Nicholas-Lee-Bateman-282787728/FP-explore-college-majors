8278305,5,B001AO2OKY,"Liked the ensemble cast of such talented actors. Laughed so much with their antics and different comedic styles. Surprised by Shahrukh Khan's item number in this film, just added to why I liked the film.",1396224000,,203,4.828571428571428
8278306,2,B001AO2OKY,"This movie did not appeal to me though others might enjoy the social stereotypes and charming plot. I thought H. Roshan was in a lead role given the misleading graphics and copy, but not so.",1364169600,,190,4.457142857142857
8278307,3,B001AO2OKY,"Plot was pathetic even for comedy. Juhi, still looks good. There is NO HRITHIK in the movie. Sharukh has an item- they should have considered Hrithik for that. The four characters have played their respective roles okay. However, the screen play sucks. There was ample opportunity to spice up the comedy. but lost. For example there is a sequence that takes you to the ""Dhobi Ghat"" in Mumbai. I thought is was missed opportunity to exploit it (remember Amithab's Khaike Paan Banaraswala...). Nothing close.
But worse part was the streaming quality. It constantly froze. Ultimately a regret message from Amazon about streaming. Having spend (or wasted) over 60 minutes, I queued to the end at least to find out that it was indeed bad, all the way.",1364083200,,746,4.881889763779528
8278308,5,B001AO2OKY,"We watched  it with our 10yr old. Entire family enjoyed it, laughed a lot...liked the screenplay, have a funny crew who are all great actors",1355788800,,140,4.6
8278309,5,B001AO2OKY,"I bought this film because I am a fan of Shah Rukh Khan, and I knew he appeared in a song in this film (so did Hrithik Roshan). Shah Rukh Khan was FANTASTIC in his song. It was very enjoyable! And Hrithik Roshan's song (at the very end of the film), was a lot of fun to watch. I really like Juhi Chawla and she was in this film. The ""Krazzy 4"" men were a lot of fun to watch. The story was engaging. I highly recommend this film.",1334880000,,429,3.831460674157303
8278310,3,B001AO2OKY,"This movies says it stars Hrithik Roshan.  That's the reason I rented it.  He only does the Krazzy 4 song and dance at the end of the movie.  SRK performs the same song in the middle of the movie.  I was disappointed in this deception.  Otherwise, it was a funny movie, but just not what I was expecting.  If you say a movie stars a certain person, they should be the main character, not a dance number.",1262736000,9,403,4.1688311688311686
