8362688,3,B002C0G5B4,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this DVD at Amazon, as I'd recently read the Rafael Sabatini book (""The Nuptials of Corbal"") upon which the film is based.  Sadly, the movie and the DVD were disappointing.  The film is rather badly paced and the actors are mediocre.  The adaptation of the book is okay, but the movie just drags and lacks the swashbuckling thrills of the novel, which tells of a French nobleman -- beloved of those in his region -- who is ordered by the Revolutionary government to marry, or face Madame Guillotine.  Despite being listed as digitally restored, the picture quality ranges from okay to poor, though the menus and jacket are handsome and Renown Pictures offered fine customer service.",1421798400,,717,4.852459016393443
