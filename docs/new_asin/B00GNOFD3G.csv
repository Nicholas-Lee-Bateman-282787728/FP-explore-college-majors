8625152,1,B00GNOFD3G,"This is not on the disk itself since it isn't available yet but on my exploring the claims that were pictured.  How do you get 12 films on one disc-- clearly many or most are 'shorts'-- two reelers running 20-25 minutes each.  I didn't recognize some of the titles and used IMDB to  look up some and found that several were  Stan Laurel alone although the cover implies Laurel AND Hardy.  Both worked alone before being teamed together about 1925.  Their early work is  interesting but mostly to those following the development of the two and not up to their work together as Laurel AND Hardy .  But at least two are Laurel AND Hardy -- I didn't research each title.
Another issue is music -- 'silents' were never really silent -- orchestra in large cities, organ or piano in most venues.  All class A DVDs have music and that is often part of the description of the disc..  I didn't see any reference in Amazon's description.
Now there is nothing wrong  with having early Laurel or Hardy when they were not Laurel AND Hardy but that  distinction should be clear to the purchaser.",1419292800,,1080,4.510309278350515
