2440281,3,B000BT99D4,"While this abridgement provides the core, it misses a couple of major subplots and all of the subtleties of this classic love story.  There is a reason that this story has been done six times for its audience (once on radio, twice as a feature film, and three times as a TV series) and while I don't know how the story changed between all the versions, the 1993 series that was edited down to this DVD is regarded as a major classic by critics of the genre.  I do hope that Televisa considers issuing a longer version (not less than 20 hours) that includes the humorous moments and the delicious catfight between Aimee and Sofia.

I would recommend this DVD for viewers of the original who didn't tape and keep every single episode (which I did) and who want to remember some of the key moments that were heavily promoted on the network in the teaser ads:  Juan's first meetings with Aimee and Monica, the two weddings, and the two hottest love scenes between Juan and Monica (including the wedding night).  While these scenes illustrate the incredible sex appeal of the late Eduardo Palomo, we miss their context.  When I saw the original series back in the day it felt like I was watching a romance novel.

Thankfully, the original music is intact.  I truly wish that rather than using a popular song as a theme (and changing the title of the story to accomodate it), the producers would stick to having original title music composed for new productions, as they did here.",1152489600,14,1474,4.577946768060836
2440282,5,B000BT99D4,"This telenovela has been seen in more than 20 countries around the world, it has been remade three times over the last 35 years, and  it has won numerous awards. Corazon Salvaje, which means Savage Heart in English is a story filled romance, passion, intrigue, envy, greed, malice, and betrayal all the ingredients necessary in creating an unforgetable tale.

It begins with the shores of San Pedro when a savage abused boy by the name of Juan Diablo befriends the son of a wealthy landowneer named Andres de Alcazar y Valle. Instantly the pair become good friends unaware that the two of them are really brothers. Andres is the legtimate son of Francisco de Alcazar y Valle who 15 years ago had a love affair with a poor peasant woman the mother of Juan. Upon learning that Juan is his son from his dearest love Francisco begins to make arrangements for his Juan to be educated and most importantly so that he can have his name. Unfortunately Francisco has a heart attack, however before he dies he writes a letter conveying that his last wish is for Juan to have his name, in addition he makes Andres promise to take care of his brother and with that he dies not knowing that his wife Sofia fearing for the future of her child Andres takes the letter before anyone can see it and hides it and sends her son Andres to Mexico City. 15 years have passed and both boys have grown into men Andres is now an educated gentlemen charming everyone he sees and meets. Juan on the other hand is now a rich smuggler of goods and owns land, although still as reckless as the day he was born. In Mexico City, Andres falls heads over heels in love with Aimee the daughter of a penniless countess who unbeknowst to him is not only the sister of his fiance Monica but the lover of Juan Diablo. Returning to San Pedro he breaks off the arrangement with Monica and asks Aimee to marry him instead. Although already the lover of Juan Aimee agrees unwilling to pass up a good marriage with Andres, although she loves the passion Juan ignites in her the temptation of wealth and prestige consumes her and she accepts the marriage proposal of Andres. Humilated by the rejection of Andres, Monica the older sister of Aimee and calmly enters a convent desiring to be a nun. A month has gone by and Aimee and Andres are couple in bliss until the arrival of Juan who is furious that Aimee married Andres comes to abduct her causing a scandal. To clean up the mess her sister has made Monica steps in the middle and sacrificing her name states that she is the lover of Juan thus compelling her to marry Juan. Though Juan is a violent man witout manners, a title, education and even a name Monica falls deeply in love with him as she sees that below the tough exterior of his heart lies a man who is not only good, honorable, but selfless and kind to those more unfortunate than himself. Savage yet gentle, Vulnearale yet strong Juan begins to see a life filled with promise with the love of his beloved Monica, however his future with her becomes shaky when Andres discovers the truth of his relationship with Aimee. Angry and betrayed he joins forces with other individuals to destroy Juan his half brother, the son of his father. Yet through the trials and tribulations Juan is determined not to let Monica go the tamer of his wild heart. Together Juan and Monica fight to preserve not only their marriage but their wild hearts as well.",1149379200,2,3412,4.492753623188406
2440283,4,B000BT99D4,"I was thrilled to get this DVD.  I had previously watched most of the series on TV without English subtitles, limited by my incomplete understanding of Spanish language.  In spite of this drawback, I loved this show.  It was romantic, dramatic, tender, and funny all at the same time.  The scenery was breathtaking, the costumes were excellent, the cast was talented and believable, and the production obviously had enough budget for a classy production.

This favorite novel has been filmed in numerous versions over the years. Side note:  Enrique Lizalde, the family lawyer, starred as the dashing Juan de Diablo in the 1966 TV version.  This time pop idol Eduardo Palumbo shines in the role. The entire cast is perfect, especially Claudia Islas in an Emmy-caliber performance as Dona Sofia, the mother-in-law from hell.

Now for the not-so-good part.  I suppose it's impossible to trim all 80 episodes to fit on one 280 minute DVD without losing something.  Unfortunately, the plot got mangled.  Major story arcs disappeared completely.  Scenes of character development and twenty years of back story got chopped, as did a lot of the humor.  Instead of a rich, believable epic we are given a rather simplistic little story.  I miss the intricate interplay of relationships which gave the novel and the TV series so much delightful depth.  I fell in love with the TV characters, but so much is missing from this DVD.

I'm not sorry I bought this DVD, but it should have been so much more.

Startling Update:  ALL of the original 1993 episodes are now available online at YooTube.",1146528000,6,1581,4.90188679245283

2440365,2,B000BT99D4,"Corazon Salvaje is my mom's most favorite telenovela ever so I got this because you can't buy the full series in stores nowadays. So what happens when you take 80 episodes and condense them to something slightly over 4 hours long? A hot mess. Mom and I sat down over the course of 2 nights to watch this and I had to keep hitting the pause button, turn to her and ask, ""What the heck is going on?"" Poor Mom had to fill in the gaps in the story from memory. And the original music was replaced with some insipid piano piece that looped as obnoxiously as a midi on a Geocities website.

Don't get me wrong, this is an awesome telenovela. It's the DVD that is sorely lacking and its existence does the show a major disservice. The only thing I was actually happy with were the subtitles - they were pretty accurate. If you must buy this, expect to be confused (but seeing Eduardo Palomo is almost worth the confusion). Otherwise, find some way to acquire the entire series.",1396656000,5,970,4.359116022099448

2440393,4,B000BT99D4,"Note:  There are many versions of Corazon Salvaje out there - this review speaks to the 2009 Televisa version starring Aracely Arambula and Eduardo Yanez.  First, as others have pointed out, telenovelas that aired for 120 hours or more are then condensed into aftermarket DVD versions that generally run no more than 12 hours.  Unlike the prime-time airings, the shortened DVD versions move at warp speed, and much of the nuance gets lost.  How can it be otherwise?  In an hour you will watch what took two weeks or more to play out in prime time.  So, for instance, ""Oh honey, I've waited so long for you"" usually plays out as 'I waited six minutes for you' on the at-home DVD version :)  If you really want the full plot details and to get engaged with all the character roles, DVD telenovelas are not for you.  But if you simply want to watch a classic TN love story play out, with a cast that is familiar to you, these can be very entertaining.  I think this version of Corazon Salvaje is great. You can follow the general plot line, but the real entertainment is watching some of your favorite Televisa stars doing their thing.  Osvaldo Rios and Eduardo Yanez in the same TN - need I say more?

2440394,4,B000BT99D4,"As others have pointed out, telenovelas that aired for 120 hours or more are then condensed into aftermarket DVD versions that generally run no more than 12 hours.  Unlike the prime-time airings, the shortened DVD versions move at warp speed, and much of the nuance gets lost.  How can it be otherwise?  In an hour you will watch what took two weeks or more to play out in prime time.  So, for instance, ""Oh honey, I've waited so long for you"" usually plays out as 'I waited six minutes for you' on the at-home DVD version :)  If you really want the full plot details and to get engaged with all the character roles, DVD telenovelas are not for you.  But if you simply want to watch a classic TN love story play out, with a cast that is familiar to you, these can be very entertaining.  I think this version of Corazon Salvaje is great. You can follow the general plot line, but the real entertainment is watching some of your favorite Televisa stars doing their thing.  Osvaldo Rios and Eduardo Yanez in the same TN - need I say more?

No estoy exagerando cuando digo que es una verdadera porquera.  No se ni por donde empezar.  Le cambiaron los nombres a los personajes, inventaron a un tal Juan de Dios, el pelo horrendo rojo y artificial de la Aracely (no se si es peluca pero es horroroso), la carota gorda y enorme de Eduardo Yez que sin exagerar ocupa toda la pantalla.  Bueno esque hay tantas cosas que no terminara de poder expresar con palabras.  Qu gran verguenza para la nueva generacin que no conoce la maravilla que fue la legendaria versin con Eduardito Palomo que en paz descanse.  Sinceramente, a qu tarado se le fue a ocurrir poner a Eduardo Yez en el papel de Juan del Diablo?  Ese hombre ya est viejo y gordo y descompuesto.  Jams nunca para hacer un papel tan legendario y tan inolvidable como el de nuestro amado Juan del Diablo.  Yo creo que hasta le tuvieron que hacer liposuccin en la barriga porque se le ve toda rara, como esfondada para dentro, cuando sale sin camisa.  En fin, algo GROTESCO.  La versin con Eduardo Palomo se hizo con gran elegancia: el vestuario precioso de las damas especialmente, aun el de Aime.  Aime siempre se visti con muchsima clase y elegancia, mientras que a la Aracely la hicieron verse como una putilla barata de las que trabajaban en la Venta de Cajiga, toda vestida al rojo vivo.  Horrible.  Una de las cosas mas importantes en el arte es lo sutil, y solamente porque Aime era ramerilla, aun asi era una dama de sociedad.  Si de verdad quieren vivir la experiencia incomparable de Corazon Salvaje, vayanse a YouTube y vean la versin completa del 93 y as comprobarn lo que les digo.  Y una ltima cosa es la qumica genuina que haba entre Edith Gonzalez y Eduardo Palomo.  Esque esa si que estaba llena de pasin y sensualidad sin necesidad de forzar nada.  Lo legtimo no hay que adornarlo ni forzarlo.  Es espontneo, tal y como lo era el romance entre Edith y Eduardo Palomo.  Lstima que se invirti tanto dinero y tanta extravagancia en esta nueva versin, pues fue realmente un desperdicio.  Es algo simplemente grotesco, chocante y sobre todo descorazonante.  Ya bastante tuvimos que sufrir con la muerte del legendario Palomo y con la truncacin de la segunda parte de Corazn Salvaje.  Y ahora encima tenemos que soportar ste sacrilegio.  Eduardo Palomo debe de estar revolvindose en su tumba.  No es justo.",1306195200,6,2651,4.970454545454546

Es una Bonita Historia de Amor y tiene una maravilloza adaptacion. Cuenta con un Gran Elenco, esta Protagonisada por Aracely Arambula, interpretando un Doble Papel y Eduardo Yaez, con la Actuacion Antagonica de Enrique Rocha y Helena Rojo, ademas cuenta con las participaciones de Elizabeth Gutierrez, Angelique Boyer, Rene Casados, entre otros...

8/6/2011: El Dvd es tal cual como me imagine, en cuanto a la Portada, el Diseo, Los Discos etc... solo que Me Molesto Mucho que en la Tapa diga que Dura Mas de 12 Horas siendo que el Resumen tiene una Duracion de 714 Minutos, 11 Horas y 54 Minutos, ademas en la Contratapa dice: Caracteristicas Especiales: Entrevistas, Equipo Tecnico, y yo probe uno a uno los Discos, varias veces y me fije minuciosamente y en ninguno de los 3 trae algun Extra, Es Mentira. Por eso Estoy Muy Molesto.
En cuanto al Resumen de los Capitulos Deja Mucho Que Desear, Podria Haber Sido Muchisimo Mejor, el Dvd 1 se hace muy pesado, esta resumido con Escenas que carecen de mucha fuerza, mas bien resultan algo aburridas, eso me paso hasta ver que termina la travesia del Barco, cuando llegan al Puerto de Veracruz, por otra parte considero que muchas Escenas importantes y muy buenas las quitaron. Estoy de acuerdo con el resto de las personas que compraron y vieron el Dvd y pienso al igual que ellos, que la Edicion esta mal hecha, es de muy mal gusto. Ademas falta el Final de Fulgencio... que si bien no era uno de los Villanos Principales tenia un papel importante en la Historia y merecia que mostraran lo que pasa con el despues de todo lo que hizo y que era un traficante de armas.",1305676800,2,2116,4.6005291005291005

2440409,4,B000BT99D4,"WARNING, Amazon.com has tacked reviews of the brilliant 1993 version of Corazon Salvaje onto the sales page for the 2009 remake, the worst bomb in the history of telenovelas. (3/10/11 UPDATE: they seem to have corrected that.) Here's my review of the earlier version with Eduardo Palomo and Edith Gonzalez:

The 1993 version of ""Corazon Salvaje"" set a standard for historical telenovelas that has never been surpassed. I understand why reviewers who loved the series are disappointed with this extremely abridged DVD. It's true that many good scenes are cut, much of the character development is gone, and people new to the story may wonder what all the fuss is about among those of us who rave about it. But some elements of what made this telenovela great are still evident. The lead actors are all tremendous, often in surprisingly subtle ways. They play it sincerely, not in the over-the-top, campy style of current telenovelas. The characters are more nuanced than you might expect, not just good/bad or hero/villain caricatures (which the 2009 version falls victim to). There is a very real chemistry between Edith Gonzalez (as Monica) and Eduardo Palomo (as Juan) that's rarely captured on screen. Though not sexually explicit by today's standards, some of their love scenes are among the best ever filmed. What's not to like? Well, OK, this DVD is just too short and lacks the impact of the series. Longer clips are available on YouTube but have poor resolution and can only be fully appreciated by Spanish speakers. Televisa should recognize 1993's ""Corazon Salvaje"" as the true classic it is and release a complete boxed set in the US.",1276128000,9,1645,4.9818181818181815
2440410,3,B000BT99D4,"This is my favorite telenovela of all times. I loved the plot, the actors, the scenes, everything. However the DVD, as other reviewers have pointed out, is a very very condensed version. You can understand the plot but there are so many good scenes that were cut to be able to fit the story in 1 DVD, some of them very romantic scenes between Juan and Monica. That's the reason I give it a 3 stars. But other than that, I enjoyed watching the DVD.",1274486400,3,447,4.270588235294118
2440411,1,B000BT99D4,"Corazon Salvaje is simply one of the best produced, cast and written stories in the latin soap opera world. The cinematography, acting, costumes and storyline are top rate and everything about it (from the camera work to the ballet of a romance performed by the story's two main characters) has been thoughtfully and remarkably done.

However, this DVD does not do it justice.

Being already very short in duration compared to other melodramas (about 80 episodes shown 5 days of the week while running) that have been abridged, this story has been shorten to the point of mediocrity. It has been reduced to 4 hours and the entire storyline has been distorted, with no evidence of its greatness.

Due to the large number of soap operas created in multiple countries in Latin America, and lack of value given to them by the audience, studios have not seen an opportunity to sell entire soap operas (which are basically a one shot series in the culture). However, seeing the USA success in the sell of series (south park, house, etc), they have been testing the market.

This abridged version of Corazon Salvaje leaves you wanting. If you have seen the series, you will be very disappointed and if you have not, you will say: ""what's the big deal?"" if someone recommended it to you.

Juan del Diablo (Eduardo Palomo), a man with a dubious character and a pirate, has a fling with Aime&eacute; (Ana Colchero), the daughter of a count. But, she marries Andr&eacute;s (Ariel Lopez Padilla), Juan's brother and the man her sister loves. Juan then marries M&oacute;nica (Edith Gonz&aacute;lez), through a confusion of sorts. The telenovela revolves around the resulting relationship between Juan and M&oacute;nica and the way they endure through Aimee's schemes, Andr&eacute;s' jealousy, violence and natural disasters. Let me start by saying the this is one of the best telenovelas I have seen. The actors gave excellent performances. Ana Colchero was amazing in this telenovela. I liked her character, even through all her devious and evil schemes. Was I the only one still rooting for her? The acting of all the characters was truly excellent. The story was not only interesting, but also very engaging and emotional. When it first aired, I could not miss a single episode of this telenovela. This is a must see.

But, this DVD offers a version that is too abridged to offer a true or at least partial picture of the story.

There should have made a complete DVD version of the Telenovela, since it has been one of the best ever done...",1175817600,8,275,4.288461538461538
2440437,5,B000BT99D4,"I absolutely love Corazon Salvaje, ever since it came out when I was a little girl.  I was ecstatic when they replayed it two years later, which is when I decided to record it.  Unfortunately, those vhs's are horrible to watch! I recently bought the DVD, the condensed version, and like others I agree that it is chopped too much! There are a lot of subplots and scenes that I remember watching and miss.  We never meet Cesar Evora's niece and sister-in-law at all, we miss the romances of secondary characters and miss out on a lot of details (we don't really find out that Monica{Edith Gonzalez} is pregnant at the end)... essentially, a lot of details are cut out.  I also bought Amor Real and Alborada and am also feeling the same as with Corazon Salvaje.

That led me to research on buying the complete novela.  I found a great website called ""Novelas R Us"" and they have so many different complete novelas on DVDs. I just finished buying the Corazon Salvaje one and can't wait till I receive it. It is on 20 DVD's so I know it will have a lot more detail than this one. I am now planning to buy all my favorite novelas. Although it is 65 dollars (free shipping though) it is so worth it.

Corazon Salvaje should be enjoyed in its entirety and that is what I am going to do",1175817600,88,1278,4.322175732217573

2440441,5,B000BT99D4,"Corazon salvaje is the third TV version of one of the classic Mexican telenovelas (soap operas) with a prototypical plot involving virginal and whorish sisters, illegitimate children, a conniving mother, and revenge.  As in previous film and TV incarnation, this version is a ""who's who"" of Mexican beauties, and all four leads (Edith Gonzalez, Eduardo Palomo, Ana Colchero and Ariel Lopez Padilla) have never looked better onscreen.

Considering that they've edited multiple chapters into a mere 4 1/2 hours, I thought they did an excellent editing job, even building suspense to make you want to turn the DVD after the end of side one.

Unlike most telenovelas nowadays, Corazon salvaje has a fairly simple main plotline and not as many supporting characters and subplots going on, so you get the gist of what really matters: the ups-and-downs concerning the romance and revenge storyline between good sister Monica (Gonzalez), slutty sister Aimee (Colchero), gentlemanly Andres (Lopez)and his smoldering bastard half-brother Juan del Diablo (Palomo).  The story is less campy and tongue-in-cheek than contemporary novelas, basically its a televised Harlequin romance in Spanish with optional subtitles.

If you have memories of the original, you may be disappointed because of the short length, but if you're satisfied with the main plotline or are a ""newbie"" to this classic Mexian novela, you'll be more than satisfied.",1163289600,20,1424,5.396396396396397
2440442,1,B000BT99D4,"Corazon Salvaje (Wild Heart) is my favorite telenovela of all time.  It is one of, if not the most romantic love story Televisa has ever produced.  The recreation of turn-of-the-twentieth-century Mexico -- with the scenery, the wardrobe, and the sets -- makes this telenovela a big eyeful.  The great cast is also an eyeful, especially the leads, Edith Gonzalez and the gorgeous Eduardo Palomo.  Palomo was such a wonderful actor, so gorgeous and talented.  I couldn't keep my eyes off him.  I was saddened when I heard about his unfortunate demise a couple of years ago.  He was very young when he had that fatal heart attack, in his forties.  His Juan del Diablo is one memorable hero and he made this telenovela one of the best of all time.  I've worn out my tapes rewinding my favorite scenes, which is why I bought the DVD.  The DVD, however, is horrible.  You watch the show in fragments.  There are abrupt cuts from one scene to another and I would've been confused if I hadn't already seen this. Some of my favorite scenes were cut off!  Televisa, as usual, released a box set containing some clips of the show instead of the whole show.  The video and audio are horrid.  I thought I was watching a VHS tape instead of a DVD. And to make things worse, they don't use the original music score.  Instead, they use the same generic crap they used with Amor Real and other DVD box sets.  Ugh! If you're a big fan of Corazon Salvaje, you may want to own this.  If you've never seen this show and are curious about it, then I suppose you should give it a whirl, but don't be surprised if you get frustrated as you're taken from abrupt scene to another.",1161475200,56,1654,4.438538205980066
2440443,3,B000BT99D4,"First I want to say that I had enjoyed seen Corazn Salvaje again but I'm also sure that it could be better.  Although all the essentials of the main plot are there, all the sub-plots were cut.  Also many of important scenes of the main story were eliminated.  I understand that to make a 270hrs. DVD of a soap opera that lasted around 8 months require a lot of editing, but this is one of the best soaps I have seen, and trust me I seen plenty.  Now that the actor that played Juan del Diablo (Eduardo Palomo) passed away I was hoping for the real thing.  I am sure that a real fan will pay up to $40 or $50 for the original version that, if I remember correctly consisted of 5 VHS tapes of 2hrs or more each.  So like I said, although I have enjoyed this version, I will be on the look out hoping for the original.",1154995200,6,815,4.031055900621118

I will not be buying these dvd's thanks to the reviews. I would rather wait and hopefully get to see the day when we can have the whole novelas on dvd, even if it has to be a two or three dvd box set. They are well worth it. Until then I will keep my fond childhood memories of them and keep hoping.  Thank you all for taking the time to do the reviews. I hope someone in Televisa can get their heads together and make this happen.",1153180800,9,593,3.941666666666667
