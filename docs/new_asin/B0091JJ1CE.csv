8534294,5,B0091JJ1CE,"This was a very interesting video if you are a die hard Yankees fan! Most documentary types of videos can be boring with
all the mundane facts but this video brings you back to the ""Hey - Days"" of the opening and man of the ""Characters"" that made it
the legend it is today! I especially liked the interview with The Professor - Casey Stengel. I would highly reccoment watchng this video...",1404259200,2,389,4.416666666666667
8534295,5,B0091JJ1CE,"I just watched this video with my 91 year old father. It covers all the history that has taken place at Yankee Stadium. Babe Ruth, Casey Stengel, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio are featured as are some of the football games played at the Stadium and the first papal visit to the United States where Pope Paul said mass at Yankee Stadium.

It was entertaining and historically enlightening. My Dad watched it with rapt attention and declared that he was thirsty at the conclusion. When I handed him his water bottle, he declared 'This isn't a beer!' The baseball memories took him back to wanting 'a cold one'. Fortunately, there was one in the fridge, which we split.  He thanked me for the evening and happily went to sleep after a bit of reminiscing. That tells you all you need to know about this video.",1402876800,4,800,4.548611111111111
8534296,5,B0091JJ1CE,"This video took me back to the golden age of baseball. A time when it was a game first and a business last. A time when most of the players were moral, dedicated and hard-working men and not rich, spoiled, drug-taking, tattooed street thugs. Enjoyed some never-before-seen clips of vintage baseball games and it's true heroes. Just my opinion though.",1375660800,3,350,4.85
