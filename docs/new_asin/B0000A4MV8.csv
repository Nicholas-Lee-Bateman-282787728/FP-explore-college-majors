7995837,1,B0000A4MV8,I watched about the first 10 minutes of this movie and became so disgusted I took it out of my DVD player and threw it in the trash. I bought it for the title thinking it was something else so it was my own fault I suppose. The next time I'm not sure about a movie I will read the reviews if there are any. Instead of blindly buying a title.,1487030400,,341,3.816901408450704
