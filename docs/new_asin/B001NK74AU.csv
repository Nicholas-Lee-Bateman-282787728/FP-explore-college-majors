3719425,1,B001NK74AU,keep me confused with all the plot meanderings and maybe I will think this is a phenom action/adventure genre... nice try!,1331683200,,122,4.857142857142857
3719426,5,B001NK74AU,"Sissy Spacek is an under-lauded actress, deserving of so much more acclaim than she gets. I don't think that I have ever seen a movie that she was in where I thought she could have played the role any better. She is convincing of her portrayals, and always picks movies that have purpose, and depict an aspect of the human condition that is raw, poignant and emotion-filled. I never heard of Lake City before selecting it tonight to watch, and like someone else wrote, I will probably watch it a couple of more times. A winner.",1325030400,4,527,4.5
3719427,3,B001NK74AU,"Decent movie, actually. In all truth, I rented it to see what kind of an actor Dave Matthews was. He plays the part well, but the rest of the movie is also worth watching at least once, maybe twice. It's nothing that I'd expect to see on top of the charts, and attracting a cult following, but it's good enough to watch and will keep you entertained. It definitely seems like it's made for TV, though.",1323734400,,401,4.2894736842105265
3719428,3,B001NK74AU,My daughter asked for this movie for Christmas. It was moderatedly priced and arrived in a timely fashion. No complaints. The movie itself? eh.........,1262908800,,151,5.333333333333333
3719429,5,B001NK74AU,"In the opening scenes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lake-City/dp/B001NK74AU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lake City</a>&nbsp;we meet Maggie (Sissy Spacek), as she bustles about in the day-to-day activities of small town life. Finally at rest on her porch steps after a long day, a melancholy aura seems to encircle her.

Flash to another scene and focus in on Billy (Troy Garity), on the wrong side of some very bad guys and their fists.  Battered, he hurries home and hastily packs his bags; he then splits with Clayton, a young boy whose mother Hope has gone missing.  Billy, with Clayton in tow, is on the road to somewhere - possibly to hide, or maybe to find some answers.  We follow him in his journey as he approaches his home town and the mother whose sorrows from a long-ago accident dog her days and nights.

As the story unfolds, it soon becomes obvious that Billy's angst is complicated by his history of alcohol and drug abuse, and even though he is trying to change, the past will not let him go.  When the drug dealers, from whom Hope stole a stash, come looking for Billy (and Hope), all hell is about to break loose.

This film is a poignant portrait of tragic circumstances, errors in judgment, and what it takes to right the wrongs of the past.

3719430,5,B001NK74AU,"Sissy Spacek has always excelled at playing mothers in rural settings (Coal Miner's Daughter, Raggedy Man, In the Bedroom, The River)so her portrayal here as a mother reunited with her estranged son is right on target.  This being the case, ""Lake City"" is an absorbing film that amazingly gets better after repeated viewings.

The other actors in the film, mainly Troy Garity as her son Billy and the child actor who plays his son are equally fine as well.  There are some heart tugging scenes (to manipulate the tear ducts)but they aren't artificial.

The excellence of the cast and what they do with what is, at times, a choppy script more than compensates for this minor flaw.  Another minor flaw is the choppy editing.

But the cinematography is beautiful and the suspense factor builds momentum with each scene.  I suggest watching it two or three times to get the full impact because as I said, it is one of those movies that just gets better each time one views it.  I loved it and would recommend it highly!",1236729600,4,1015,4.662921348314606
3719431,4,B001NK74AU,"LAKE CITY is a little low budget film that has a good enough story behind it, backed by several social issues that are well handled to make it work.  Writers/Directors Hunter Hill and Perry Moore present a flavorful feeling of the South and keep this at times creaky story line moving along with the necessary momentum to maintain the viewer's interest.

The male lead of the film is in the Fonda line (Jane as mother, Peter as uncle, Henry as grandfather) and as such Troy Garity seems to have inherited the right genes. As Billy he is the central character:  Billy left a troubled home to seek his fortune as a guitar musician, but became involved with Hope (Drea de Matteo) who is deep into drugs and drug theft and has left son Clayton (Colin Ford) in Bily's care.  Billy is implicated in the drug theft and narrowly escapes death at the hands of dealer Red (David Matthews), taking Clayton with him to his hometown and mother Maggie (Sissy Spacek).  Billy's alcoholism and trauma drive him to AA meetings where he shares time with his old girlfriend-now-a-cop  Jennifer (Rebecca Romijn).  There are flashbacks that suggest a childhood trauma in Billy's past, a trauma that has driven a schism between Troy and Maggie.  And there are many twists and turns (some rather poorly delineated) that would be spoilers to reveal, but suffice it to say that this druggie on the run and son/mother relationship as well as the origin of the young keenly observant and needy Clayton together unfold the history of a family at risk.

Sissy Spacek is fine as Maggie and Troy Garity shows strong promise as Billy.  There are some minor subplots that include actors such as Keith Carradine that add little except atmosphere.  Despite its flaws LAKE CITY provides strong entertainment.  Grady Harp, March 09",1236643200,12,1794,4.788961038961039
