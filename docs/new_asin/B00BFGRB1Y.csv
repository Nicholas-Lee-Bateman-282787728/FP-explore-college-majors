5614945,4,B00BFGRB1Y,"Nine Things about Leviathan

1. This is what you would call an experimental documentary.

2. Its about the fishing industry off the coast of New England in America.

3. There is no narration to explain whats going on.

4. There is no soundtrack other than the sounds of the fishing boat and the ocean.

5. It was filmed by attaching tiny cameras on parts of the fishing boat and on the fishermen.

6. This movie makes fishing look really intimidating and scary.

7. Instead of being a traditional documentary that explains something, this one makes you feel like you are looking at a strange and alien job, full of people you will never understand.

8. There are lots of shots of dead and dying fish.

9. This is not meant for everyone. But its an extraordinary, non-linear way to tell a story. Its one of the more memorable movies of the year.",1388361600,30,844,4.5
5614946,1,B00BFGRB1Y,"Looked like bad standard definition, not a single frame was in focus and most of it was filmed at night and almost impossible to follow. Quite the most pointless film I have ever sat through. Leviathans are supposed to be whales, not a single whale appeared anywhere. Avoid like the plague!",1387411200,5,290,4.705882352941177
5614947,4,B00BFGRB1Y,"LEVIATHAN has attracted a fair amount of negative criticism from users.  The reason is obvious: it is an essentially plotless piece designed to appeal to the senses and the imagination rather than telling a story.  Focusing on the fishing industry in New Bedford, USA, directors Lucien Castaing-Taylor and Verena Paravel create a visually arresting experience in which color and imagery assume paramount importance.  The movie is full of memorable images - a flock of seagulls flying at night, a lone bird trying to find food on the fishing boat, the sight of the fishermen lopping the heads off their catch.  The movie has a memorable soundtrack, with the sounds of daily life in the fishing industry forming a kind of musique-concrete style score that has a certain haunting power.  In thematic terms, the directors are out to show the power of the elements and how human life often seems insignificant by comparison - sometimes the fishermen seem entirely at the mercy of the cruel sea.  Nonetheless they acquire a certain stoicism that enables them to continue their work; in one sequence, for instance, a lone fishermen is shown watching the television during one of his all-too-brief breaks from his nightly chores.  LEVIATHAN does not celebrate the fishermen's life; it is more concerned to create an experience for viewers, and more than fulfills the task.",1386201600,2,1364,5.0625
5614948,1,B00BFGRB1Y,"Total garbage. I was once a commercial fisherman so i was excited to see this. I guess I had imagined it would show some details or something amazing...nope not once was i impressed. Some parts do have some good cinematography and angles, If this video was cut down to say 10-15 minutes then i think it wad have been more impressive.",1386115200,3,333,4.475409836065574
5614949,5,B00BFGRB1Y,"This is certainly one of the most powerful documentaries ever made, and takes cinematography to new levels, but it can't possibly be appreciated properly unless you see it on a very large screen or in a theatre with the best hi-def projection possible. Incredibly intense, relentless, un-narrated, at times shockingly graphic and violent, disturbing, naturalistic, impressionistic, beautiful, and most of what's shown is almost never known or seen by the public or consumers of fish or seafood, not that it's anti-anything. It's a film that imposes no morals, judgment, context, history or attitude on its subject. Its ""themes"" , if you must have those, are the banality and beauty and brutality of reality, work, the material world, the elements, human drama, strength, boredom, interior life vs.exterior power. If nothing else, the film reminds you of why filmmaking must and should NEVER be allowed to devolve into small screen, self-enclosed experiences. Of course, it will become increasingly impossible ever to see the film as it should be seen.",1385078400,4,1051,5.299401197604791

Fishing causes noises unlike those heard on land.

Fishing is dirty.

Living things die due to fishing.

For those of you that can sit though this without trying to apply some artsy slant to the thing to justify your wasted hour and a half - I applaud you.  I'd still rather watch this than Deadliest Catch, and that is the nicest thing I can say about this movie.",1384905600,2,380,4.371428571428571
5614951,3,B00BFGRB1Y,"True story.

So this past summer I went on vacation with my best friend and our families.  Before embarking on our trip, my friend came across these promotional videos for the new Go Pro camera, a camera that basically allows any Joe off the street to become the director of his own movie.  We had to have one.  So, setting off for a beachside vacation with a Go Pro in our pocket (and on our heads and on a stick and basically wherever else we could stick it) we documented our entire trip.  The camera ended up in the ocean, bouncing on six foot waves, for forty minutes as we sloshed around and rammed into each other.  It was attacked by dolphins, wound up in the mouth of an alligator and ended up in my best friends pants.  Watching back these videos can be exhausting.  While they are visually stunning, forty minutes of going in and out of the ocean or ten minutes of barely distinguishable dolphin noses can be called artistic but cant really be called entertaining.

The point is that you can hand anyone a Go Pro and they start to think that they are Terrence Malick.

This is kind of the feeling I had while watching Leviathan, a film Id been anticipating since early this year when I saw the trailer.  Documentaries are a genre that I have vocally had a hard time embracing.  Last year the only documentary that I saw was Katy Perry: A Piece of Me and the year before that it was only Life in a Day (for the gimmick), despite really wanting to see Pina (it only played by me for like a week and I missed it).  I just don't gravitate towards them and so I tend to miss them all.  I wanted to change all that this year.  With so many documentaries garnering critical praise, I decided that I was going to make a conscious effort to see more of them.

I started here.

The first ten minutes or so had me experiencing so many different feelings and emotions.  About one minute in, as the screen remained mostly black with just the audible sloshing of water and the brief glimpse of a chain here and there, I was intrigued.  Three minutes in, with barely a change in scenery, I was concerned.  Five minutes in, as the action become clearer (sort of) and I could see men in slicks, soaked to the bone, yanking at machinery, I was almost convinced that this was going to be a masterpiece.  Ten minutes in, when the fish finally fell from their netted imprisonment, I already knew the films problem and it is a problem that remained throughout the entirety.

This film really needed a sharper edit.

Telling the story of a North Atlantic commercial fishing boat, Leviathan is the anti-documentary.  That is what initially drew me to the film.  As a man who isn't always interested in documentaries, to hear that the filmmakers themselves hate documentaries and set out to create a documentary that felt more like a gritty movie made me really excited.  Forget the fact that I coined the film Bears on a Boat after seeing the trailer (yes, Im that shallow sometimes), I legitimately wanted to see this for more than the five minute shower scene.

Debate my sexuality all you want; I don't care.

Upon finishing this film I was left conflicted.  There is so much that I actually admire about the direction that these filmmakers took here, but they are the very same things that I would probably change in order to make the film better.  Its a slippery slope from artistic to unwatchable, and while I applaud the idea and the concept (this is so avant-garde in construction), these choices ultimately bring the film down.

With no narration (and really, only a speckle of talking at all, which is barely audible thanks to the white noise emanating from the surroundings), the film feels very cold and detached, which was purposeful and kind of refreshing.  That being said, without any sort of conversation between crew or voice over to illuminate us on what it is that we are experiencing, the abrasiveness of the visuals (and they are abrasive) lose some of their poignancy and impact.  Watching fisherman desecrate the bodies of stingrays for five minutes is already hard enough to look at, but with no real context it feels like unnecessary brutality.  Again, this is probably the whole point and I do admire the idea, but I would have done it differently.  More than the lack of narration though, the films biggest hurdle is the lack of edit.  Each individual scene is probably two minutes too long.  If they had only trimmed these scenes down, the film would have been a 60 minute doc and it would have probably been perfect.

I mean that.

Instead we are left with elongated scenes that don't change much at all in composition and become repetitive and ultimately burdensome.  For a film that is a brisk hour and a half, I felt like I was watching a four hour movie.

And really, don't watch this hung-over.  I almost threw up.

If you are seeking a unique movie experience, this is your ticket.  The film is unlike anything Ive ever seen, but it is a film that I admired more than I enjoyed, and I really wish that these flaws hadnt been so present, because they overwhelm the film.  I do hope that more people try their hand at this style of filmmaking, because conceptually and visually, the film is not merely compelling but really beautiful, in a disgusting and gritty way.  It just feels so raw and honest and brutal.  This is a film that I won't be forgetting anytime soon, and one that Im sure Ill continue to mull over.

I may absolutely LOVE this in a week, once Ive removed myself from the initial experience and given my mind time to soak in the lingering impact.",1384473600,14,5584,4.509452736318408
5614952,5,B00BFGRB1Y,"Leviathan pairs the direct cinema ethnographics of Verena Paravel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foreign-Parts/dp/B0083Q4JYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foreign Parts</a>) with the more pared-down aesthetics of Lucien Castaing-Taylor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweetgrass/dp/B003FO80MI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweetgrass</a>) to create a truly unique approach to documentary, delivering an astonishing perspective on deep sea fishing in the North Atlantic. What strikes you at once is what you might call the naivet of the camera's eye. It's not random, it's intelligent, and seems to pay attention and figure things out, but it's as if the operator doesn't start out knowing what's important, it's as if the camera is a subjectivity thrown into the situation of the fishing ship -- to begin with in the nearly total darkness of the early hours -- and starts out just looking, intrigued by what it sees and wanting to capture it all, but only one piece at a time.

You'd think it would be boring. I was prepared for something slow and contemplative, and perhaps a little scary to see the blood of fish remains washing from the ship. It turns out I couldn't look away - the naivet of the camera made me forget what I know about fishing, and just look, sharing in the fascinations of the camera. It really turned out to be one of the most memorable visual (and visceral) experiences I've had in front of a screen.

It is as if, at first, we have a camera operator that does not know, for example, that people are what's interesting on a boat, that you should shoot things from an eye-level perspective, that there should be establishing shots to orient the viewer's perspective. Yet this lack of knowing never feels like incompetence or ineptitude, but rather signals openness, an inquisitiveness, an eagerness to see and learn. The subjectivity behind the camera is an intensely curious eye, intent on learning how things work. It's got the impulses, one might say, of a radical empiricist. Sometimes observing from the level of the deck, and sometimes just below the surface of the ocean, it is an eye that seems intent on learning how things work on the ship, figuring out just how things are done here, and to what purpose. At first we see the people who are working the ship only obliquely - a hand, a boot, a glimpse of a face. It's an amphibious eye, as comfortable coming up close to the machinery of the boat or the arms of the worker as it is in settling below the surface, breaking through to catch a glimpse of the sky only with the rolling of the waves

It is, in other words, an interested gaze, but one that doesn't come in with an agenda. It has an eye for the surprising and lovely, and can enter into a reverie, ceasing to roam for a while, as it settles in to simply watch the water rolling by the deck of the boat, or the flocks of seagulls, eager for the ship's remains. A few incidents on the ship ""teach"" the camera that people are the agents of the activities taking place, and the camera follows one man who seems to be in charge for a while, and it learns to sit and look, rather than roaming, as the man sits and looks at the television set while he eats, until he falls asleep, and the camera returns to where it seems to take the greatest interest, at the edge of the ship, just above and below the surface, where the birds fly above and the fish are below. Lingering on the border between sea and sky, an amphibious eye. Astonishing.",1371945600,10,3547,4.87893864013267
8567758,1,B00BFGRB1Y,"This is one of those ""somebody got a camera for Christmas movies"" that are just horrendous.  The camera gets to go on a couple of boats where stoic people catch fish and scallops.  The point of the movie seems to be 1) this is the most colossally dismal occupation a human could possibly choose, and 2) to show that the camera is waterproof and if you tie it on a rope and drag it alongside the boats, you get a lot of glub-glub noises like the drowning scenes in the movies - and ostensibly the view one would have if similarly tied on a rope and thrown overboard.

Perhaps the latter is punishment for talking on board, as in all 80 min of this movie here is the maximum dialog between any two workers (the crews are small, apparently 4 or 5 per boat):  Crewman 1: ""I looked up 'thumb' in the dictionary.""  Crewman 2 ""Dumb.""

As I lament, this is just a camera along for a ride, and nothing is really documented.  We don't know where they are, and can only infer a little about what they are doing .  A voice over explaining the work would have been helpful, just to explain the why of it beyond the obvious fact that the fish and scallops we eat come from SOMEWHERE. But no, the soundtrack, aside the camera-in-water footage already mentioned, is mainly the screeching of heavy winches and other machines that haul in the nets.

And, oh, yeah, if you didn't know that cleaning a lot of fish (some still thrashing) in a hurry is bloody, gross work, you're really gonna be surprised.",1486771200,,1484,4.367272727272727

8567764,2,B00BFGRB1Y,"I'm sure now everyone knows what this film is about. A unique and quirky documentary which deals with commercial fishing off the coast of New England. Obviously a wild and scary line of work. It promised to be (and I quote the critics tag lines): ""Visceral and intense. Captures a world in a way no one has before."" and other type hyperbole. In truth it was interesting, and they put camera's in places most would never go, and we got minutes on end of footage of floating dead fish. But ultimately I was expecting something a little more intense, some footage of the deadly peril and seas they fished in. Seas that have claimed thousands of lives in all the years. But it was quite tame in comparison. There were certainly plenty of shots that put you in the middle of what was happening, waves lashing against the lens, both below and slightly above the surface of the water. Those with weaker stomachs might want to consider taking several Dramamine before viewing. Certainly an ""immersive"" experience as they claimed, but not in a very interesting way. Minutes on end of chains being pulled from the water and nets dripping. Or people casually slicing fish, which if other reviewers; seemingly people with no real knowledge of such lines of work found brutally honest and intriguing, although such things can be found in abundance on your average ""ship at sea"" type show on the Discovery Channel, or countless reels of ancient documentary footage of fish processing. I found myself the whole time wanting to turn the sound off (it had no narration or sound track which could be fine if it were a bit more interesting) and wanting to put on some sort of intense and driving type music. Swans ""The Seer"" album I have recently found eerily coincides perfectly with multiple underwater documentary shows, and the loud, intense music of the album would go quite well with these visuals, and if watched at the same time would actually be a surreal, visceral, and intense experience. But that is simply my own tastes, and I think it would have improved it some. Ultimately some will find it fully engaging, and others tantalizingly interesting but falling short of their expectations. At the end of the day it's worth seeing once or twice, but I can't imagine it's something you would want to go back to time and again.

EDIT: I borrowed this film from the library again intent on viewing it with the Swans album I mentioned above. I have to say it improved the film dramatically. I highly recommend anyone viewing it to try it out, especially if you found it interesting but lacking. The entire two hour album is available on youtube so you don't even have to spend money.",1398988800,2,2670,4.6929637526652455
8567765,4,B00BFGRB1Y,"This is a great but disturbing film that provides a terrifying testament to our overfishing of the oceans.  The mostly close-up cinematography is breathtaking and there is no dialogue.  Some will find this unorthodox method of storytelling a little too off the beaten path, but I found it refreshing - there's something very subjective about it, almost as if you're actually there on the fishing boat. Strongly recommended.",1391644800,2,423,5.205882352941177
8567766,1,B00BFGRB1Y,I spent most of the time watching this wondering if it was actually HD as most of it is shot in low enough light to be terrible looking. I love beautiful films and don't mind little to no narration but the creativity in camera usage does not make up for it. I also wonder if this was made by putting go pro cameras on a boat and telling someone to use them in the most annoying way possible to try to piss off the fishermen. I will no longer buy any films that are suggested by film festivals or Aperture magazine. Even though I still love Aperture magazine,1391299200,6,557,4.166666666666667

After about 20 minutes, my wife and I were just looking at each with that ""are we being punked?"" look of incredulity.  I understand... I SWEAR, I understand, that a documentary means that the technical aspects of movie-making are often compromised by necessity.  That being said... my kingdom for a narrator.  I had no clue what I was seeing (when I could see anything at all) the vast majority of the time.  I felt like it was my first day at a new job, and that's not a pleasant or fulfilling way to pass the time.
