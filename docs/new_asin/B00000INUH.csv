1226094,5,B00000INUH,"One of the best Jet Li movies I have seen so far. I've never seen Jet Li look so cool before. He plays a Chinese soldier from Beijing who is hired as a bodyguard in Hong Kong. He protects a fine looking girl, but never loses his cool and his focus on his mission to protect her. He has a very serious attitude, with a skill that is unmatched against all the opposition he faces. The last part of the movie is the best part as he beats his opponents to a pulp and risks his own life to save the girl he is sworn to protect.",959817600,,522,3.8878504672897196
1226095,5,B00000INUH,"As a movie goer and watcher, Jet Li is one of the greatest martial artists alive...  This movie was a great flick, because of the drama, romance, and sad realization of what was happening.  The fight scenes were amazing and well thought up making it even more intense...  With a good actress like  Christy Cheung in there what could be better?  Surely a mix of both  talents will result in a good flick...",956361600,,405,4.47945205479452
1226096,5,B00000INUH,"I had never heard of Jet Li before Lethal Weapon 4 arrived in theaters.  I'm a Mel Gibson fan so I naturally watched that movie.  Jet Li was in it for maybe just over a half an hour but his fantastic moves nearly stole the  film away from Gibson's humorous dialogue.  Afterward, I was in search of  Jet Li movies.  Since then, I have seen about five and The Bodyguard from  Beijing is my favorite (it's about on par with Lethal Weapon 4 but that  wasn't really a Jet Li film).  It has everything any action fan could ask  for: a decent plot, well-developed characters (as good as possible for a  Hong Kong film), humorous dialogue and situations, as well as long action  sequences that are absolutely breathtaking.
Ching (Jet Li) is a bodyguard  from China who is assigned to protect a woman named Michelle Yeung (Christy  Chung), a schoolteacher who witnessed a murder committed by a corrupt  businessman.  It seems she will be testifying at the trial as a witness and  the businessman will stop at nothing to prevent that from happening, thus  entering Ching as the man who must protect Michelle.  Naturally, Michelle  hates Ching the moment she sets on eyes on him, but slowly begins to fall  for him despite the fact she already has a boyfriend (a very rich one, no  less).  Ching begins to have feelings toward her, too, and his image of a  hardened bodyguard softens throughout the film.
The number one question  any Hong Kong film fan will ask first about this movie is if it has any  good action.  Yes, Bodyguard from Beijing has some spectacular action  sequences that range from shootouts to an amazing martial arts fight  between Li and the main villain.  The shootouts aren't typical Hollywood  where the hero blasts all the villains away without breaking a sweat.  In  this film, Li constantly moves around (quite gracefully too) to avoid being  shot and displays some excellent footwork.
Li is charismatic as usual and  is very much likeable in almost all of his films.  Christy Chung is far  from annoying as some people seem to think, and Kent Cheng is quite  hilarious.
Action fans should look for this film.  It certainly wouldn't  hurt to spend just over an hour and a half watching this film.",956275200,22,2212,4.644155844155844
1226097,5,B00000INUH,"The Bodyguard from Beijing is the best of all the Jet Li movies I have seen (I have not seen Fist of Legend).  The film marvelously combines romance with grand shootouts and fabulous martial arts action sequences.  The result is dynamite Jet Li.
Li stars as Ching, a bodyguard who is sent  from communist China to protect a woman named Michelle Yeung (Christy  Chung) in Hong Kong.  She witnessed a murder committed by a corrupt  businessman and is ready to testify on trial.  She feels her life isn't in  that much danger until they attack her in a mall, where Li invokes the  wrath of an extremely dangerous retired soldier whose brother he  killed.
I'm hoping either New Line Cinema or Miramax will pick this film  up and distribute it in the U.S.  There's really no reason not to.  Despite  the fact the plot has been seen before, it's still an extremely enjoyable  movie to watch.
As usual, the best aspect of any Jet Li movie is the  action and Bodyguard from Beijing has a lot of it, ranging from the  incredible shootout in the mall to the long action-packed finale inside a  luxurious house that has Jet Li hopping up and down stairs and sliding down  pillars, reloading his gun without even grabbing the clip, while shooting  down badguys all the way.  As awesome as this shootout is the martial arts  fight that comes right after it is even better.  It's a furiously fast  fight that involves Li fighting the retired soldier.  Both men are quick  and very well-trained in the martial arts.  The fight involves them kicking  and punching each other around while trying to get water from a sink  (because of a gas leak).  There's no lack of creativity in this action  sequence as wet cloths and venetian blinds are used as weapons.  The fight  never loses pace or momentum and its movement is consistently fluid.  The  action sequence looks so genuine and well-choreographed beyond most of what  I've seen. It's one of the best martial arts fights I've ever seen on film,  ranking with Jackie Chan's ladder sequence in First Strike, the martial  arts fight atop a building in Who am I?, and the deliriously long fight in  the conclusion of Drunken Master 2.  Much of Bodyguard from Beijing's  success can be given to director Cory Yuen though it all mostly goes to Jet  Li.
As for the performances, Jet Li is his usual solid self though is  more fun to watch this time.  Christy Chung delivers a decent performance  as Li's love interest while Kent Cheng is all right in the role of comic  relief.  Ngai Sing is particularly menacing as the villain though his  character should have been in more of the film.  That's really my only  complaint, something most people would find minor.",956016000,13,2692,4.623404255319149
1226098,3,B00000INUH,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie immensely.  When you watch a Jet Li action film, though, you have to remember that plot, dialogue and acting are not what you are looking for.  My favorite part in the film had to be  the ""mall sequence"" in which the bodyguard (Jet Li) takes Christy  Cheung shopping.  What ensues is a rather intense action sequence that ends  up looking like a live-action video game with a nearly unlimited supply of  bad-guys popping out of every nook and cranny of the mall.  That's the kind  of action that seems possible only in Hong Kong films.  One thing that  I have grown very tired of in these movies are the whiny, silly, idiotic  and immature female characters that Jet Li ends up risking his life for.  Christy Cheung is no exception, playing her part as whiny and spineless as  possible.  Yeah, sure she's pretty, but if I were Jet Li, I would've let  the bad guys have her since she hardly seems worth all the trouble.",954979200,3,959,4.456647398843931
1226099,3,B00000INUH,"Jet stars as a bodyguard (obviously). Kind of a rip off of 'The Bodyguard', except Jet makes Costner look like an amateur. Great action, good plot, and Jet's smooth moves make this a decent modern-day action  movie.",948585600,8,215,4.8108108108108105
1226134,3,B00000INUH,"This movie was made in Hong Kong, starring Jet Li, directed by Corey Yuen. Although it is not Jet Li's best, it is nevertheless worth watching.

The bodyguard (Jet Li) is assigned to protect the rich Christy Cheung, the only remaining witness to a murder case (the other two witnesses were killed weeks before the trial). At first, they don't get along, largely due to the stiff bodyguard violating her privacy, installing security cameras not only throughout the house but also her bedroom. However, a romantic relationship develops after she violates security procedures and goes shopping, only to be saved from being narrowly killed by several assassins, due to the first rate fighting skills of the bodyguard.

The movie starts slowly but it builds up to excellent martial arts towards the end. The major disappointment is that the producers forgot that this was supposed to be a martial arts movie and introduced guns unnecessarily, which spoils the action. The action is not as much as I would have wished. However, the fight, towards the end is first rate, particularly when Jet Li fights Ken Lo (Jackie Chan).

However, for those who like guns and also like martial arts, then this movie will excite you.",1147046400,,1212,4.931372549019608

1226136,3,B00000INUH,"I'm a big fan of Hong Kong action movies, but Bodyguard from Beijing was merely okay. Jet Li stars as a doughty tough bodyguard from the mainland hired to protect a spoiled rich girl from Hong Kong. Sparks fly when he tries to restrict her movements and jet-setting lifestyle. The two eventually fall in love, despite the fact that his new girlfriend is already the mistress of a wealthy man.

I liked the film, but didn't find it anything to shout about. The girl's nephew Billy was way irritating. Jet Li was handsome and there were some great martial arts feats but this DVD was nothing to write home about. 3 stars. Average.",1140566400,,628,4.557522123893805
1226137,5,B00000INUH,"I don't have time right now to write a whole review, but definately  - BUY THIS DVD!!!
He has movies where is a lot of mystery, i hate that. In this one - practically no mystery at all - all looks real!!!
BEST OF THE BEST !!!",1033689600,2,225,3.7872340425531914
1226138,4,B00000INUH,"I used to really like this film, but as times gone on and I've come to understand cinema more I can see it for what it is, a fairly average Jet Li product. Don't get me wrong, there are some well chorepgraohed fight scenes, and Ngai Sing comes across well as the villainous Chinese Mainlander ex-soldier. The climax between him and Jet Li is inventive. But the rest of the film kind of meanders and acts merely as an average sort of martial arts film. The love interest in the film is a very beautiful woman but has very little in way of acting skill. In whole this film tried to collude the martial arts action theme with emotional rommance. In some ways I think it tried to emulate Kevin Cosney's The Bodygurad in respect to story without even trying, so they could just concentrate on the action scenes. The pairing between the action and the rommance in my eyes doesn't come across, and the two genres just end up impairing the other.

A film for raw Jet Li fans to watch. But if u want martial arts action combined with a love story then I'd recommend Donnie Yen's Ballistic Kiss, a low budget film, but it combines the two aspects fairly well.",1014595200,,1149,4.394366197183099
1226139,4,B00000INUH,"I have the american version called ""The Defender.""  The dubbing is HORRID, but I appreciate not having to read subtitles more than most, so I put up with it.  The story is quite impressive (if you can get past the despicable dubbing), which makes the action more dramatic and important.  The few action sequences aren't all that stunning, but the one at the end is outstanding.  Most of the action is with guns.  There is a kung-fu fight at the end that is pretty cool, but they put the bad guy on a wire, so it doesn't match the rest of the movie which shows Jet Li doing all of his stunts without one (even though he really should have had one)  But that is forgivable too.  All in all, it's a very complete movie.",1014508800,,716,4.2592592592592595
1226140,2,B00000INUH,"Chow Yun-Fat and Jackie Cheung (no, not Chan) are supposed to have guns, not Jet Li.

1226142,5,B00000INUH,I loved this movie.  One of the best Jet Li movies I have ever seen.  I recommend it for all those cops and criminals fans.  This movie also has great fight scenes too!  Buy it... buy it... buy it!!!,984960000,2,199,4.0256410256410255
1226143,4,B00000INUH,"This film was just great, it had everything, suspense, romance, action, a very good plot, and Jet Li's acting was very good. Jet is Ching, he is a bodyguard from mainland China trying to protect this woman that had witnessed a murder. I loved Jet Li's acting, he was an impassive character(Just like me, never laugh, never smile, serious all the time). While Michelle(The women being protected) gets very pissed off at him, at least until the big brawl at the mall. What surprised me was that this movie wasn't really aimed at action. There were only 2 fight scenes throughout the whole film. Only one of them was a hand to hand combat, and it was pretty short. That dissapointed me, but the whole story and the romance ambianting around Jet and Michelle will keep you watching. She started to like him after the fight in the mall. If you saw Tai-Chi Master, Swordsman 2, Lord of Wu-Tang, you would either love it or hate it. Because this movie had way less action and had a sad and emotional ending, which Jet Li left her.",974937600,,1023,4.505376344086022
1226174,4,B00000INUH,"Be aware that this video has recently been re-released under the title of ""The Defender"". Don't buy it twice... I did and with the exception of the DVD Case there are few differences. It's an OK Jet Li movie, but not his best. Long on romance and short on action. Good one to watch with the women of they're Martial Arts refusniks.",971395200,2,331,4.354838709677419
1226175,2,B00000INUH,"If you are a person who, like so many others, has caught on to the Jet Li  trend, then rent this.  It is not that good, in plot or action, but it has  some cool stuff.  If you are just looking for a martial arts flick, or a  good Jet Li vehicle, then check out Black Mask, The Enforcer, or Fist of  Legend(which I highly recomend).",968630400,,331,3.9393939393939394
1226176,5,B00000INUH,"This is one of the best martial arts movies I've seen since, ""Enter the Dragon"", with Bruce Lee. I love action movies and this movie was  full of action. The underlying love connection between Jet Li and the  leading female character was one aspect of why I watched this movie at  least 15 times. No sex, no kissing, just your imagination of what it could  have been like between the characters. Myself, as many other Jet Li fans,  first saw his outstanding film presence in, ""Lethal Weapon 4"",  and from there it was a search for any other movies Jet Li was in (foreign  or not). Anyone who veiws this movie and doesn't find it striking would  have to not be a true lover of action movies. I can't wait to see more and  more of Jet Li in American theaters.",967248000,3,757,4.3120567375886525
1226177,4,B00000INUH,"I just saw this movie, only now it is called ""The Defender"". Excellent action scenes; however, more gun play than fighting which is Jet  Li's strong point.",966643200,,155,4.7407407407407405
1226178,2,B00000INUH,"All I can say is that this is film was awesome! Christy Chung and Jet Li have a lot of chemistry together. I can see the sparks fly between the two stars making it a very interesting romance in the film. What really shines  is the action and suspense. The mix of martial arts and gun fights was  refreshing. The moves were done to perfection. Even though the story wasn't  deep or orginal, this was a great movie. However, this DVD had some of the  worst picture quality I have ever seen. The color and clarity was poor.  Almost half the screen was cut up and the other half was filled up with big  text subtitles. The Trailers were cut up scenes just put together in a  sloppy sequence that didn't flow at all. Overall, this version is no better  than the VHS if not worse. Major disappointment for a DVD.",964656000,,806,4.291390728476821
1226179,5,B00000INUH,"Hong Kong is where Jet's real movies are. After seeing Jet's three U.S. releases in the theaters, Lethal Weapon 4, Black Mask, and Romeo must Die,  I must say that his stateside released movies do not even come close to the  ones he made in Hong Kong. I know Black Mask was made in Hong Kong, so that  is one exception. Anyways, Bodyguard from Beijing was a great movie filled  with great action scenes. But what I really liked about this movie was the  love story subplot between Michelle and Jet. Do not take this film as some  sort of chop-socky flick because it isn't. I felt there was not enough  action scenes, but the quality of the ones in the movie and the story  itself makes this one great entertaining movie.",963619200,,720,4.401515151515151
1226180,2,B00000INUH,"I'm an avid Jet Li fan, I've seen Fist of Legend, Black Mask, Twin Warriors, Lethal Weapon 4, and The Enforcer.  Out of all the movies I have seen Jet doesn't use guns, but in this movie he does and it does nothing  for his reviews.  There is only two action scenes in the whole movie, with  only one containing martial arts.  Now when buying/watching movies of this  sort, you're not looking for Grammy Winners, but for more of martial arts.  The last complaint I have for this movie is that its subtitled and not  dubbed.  When I first started watching the movie I thought this may be a  problem, but after seeing the lack of fight scenes it didn't really matter.  This movie is a big disappointment.",963360000,,702,4.40625

Snobby at first when Jet turns her life upside down by  restricting all her activities and making her home a prison but after Jet  saves her life; she turns around and becomes more likeable and agreeable  and even tries to seduce Jet who is his usual stoic persona. (sigh)  He is  such a hottie!  The movie shows Jet being as terrific with a gun as with  his fists and kicks.  My main complaint was the poor translation in the  subtitles.  I kept going ""Is that what he or she said?""  And the  parts with the nephew got a little old.  But if you are a Jet Li fan you  will really like this  movie.",962409600,,762,4.144827586206897

I watch this movie over and over and over again. You know what, I don't even take it out of my  DVD player anymore. Ridiculous but true. I seldom get attached to anything  but this movie is so great that I wish they would release an english  version including the english version of the melody/love theme from the  movie. I don't know how to describe what the melody of the song does to me.  I sure don't understand a word of it because it's in cantonese. I highly  recommend this movie. The action has your typical Jet Li signature. The  romance part was breathtaking at some point, frustating at other points.  Does anyone know why Jet Li does not kiss any of his leading ladies.
