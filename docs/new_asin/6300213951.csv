229107,5,6300213951,"Acclaimed actress Jill Clayburgh brings her special sensitivity to the true-life story of Barbara Gordon, a successful television documentary producer who became hopelessly addicted to tranquilizers. This is a dramatic story of addiction and withdrawal, of one woman's survival in a battle for her sanity, whose career triumph is achieved at great personal sacrifice. It is a very powerful story of discovery of inner strength, independence, and ability to be truly happy. Must for clinicians and students of Psychology, Substance Abuse Counselors, and Social Workers.",1253059200,,568,5.694117647058824
229108,5,6300213951,"The subject matter is obviously heavy and weighs the audience down as much as the protagonist, but this is a mostly  successful (if highly earnest) adaptation of the famed memoir by prize-winning documentarian Barbara Gordon.  With such a lukewarm endorsement, my five-star rating may seem unwarranted, but this movie deserves a wide audience for one reason, as far as I'm concerned, and that's Geraldine Page's stunning supporting turn as the cancer-ravaged poet about whom Gordon is producing her latest work.  The scene in the hospital, when Page explodes at Clayburgh, for the sentimentality of the documentary, will raise all the hair on your body and is further proof of Page's greatness.  That she was not nominated for an Academy Award for this lacerating performance is an irrevocable blight on the movie industry.

One day Page will get her due.  Watch I'M DANCING AS FAST AS I CAN, with all its flaws, to see this acting genius at full throttle.",1163894400,19,956,4.981132075471698
229109,5,6300213951,"This movie requires insight and empathy for the lead character, otherwise it does appear the director did not adequately present what is the groundfloor to such addictions.  However, there is alot of character development here for those who listen carefully.  Barbara is tortured due to being unwanted and unloved and has used her career to cover it up along with Valium use.  She finally hits rock bottom and gets treatment via examining the sources of her rage filled inner-self.  This movie really stands out in memory from the 80's as a frank presentation of addiction, multiple competing roles, and the culture-of-Narcissm we live in and the sickness it can really create.  It shows that ""success"" is merely another cover up, another addiction with some people.  Lovinging oneself is unconditional if it is real and yes you ""don't have to cripple yourself to be loved.""",1126137600,12,874,5.034722222222222
229110,5,6300213951,"I lived her life and it is almost 20 years since I read the book and saw the movie and it still haunts me. Today I am fine, and I can say nothing more than that book really helped me to believe in myself.",1008374400,17,204,3.659090909090909
229111,4,6300213951,"Although her screen persona in such films as Starting Over and It's My Turn was being the nice girl next door, Jill Clayburgh
also took some chances. Just think of her vomiting in An Unmarried
Woman and her incestuous opera singer in Bernardo Bertolucci's
Luna. This film is based on Barbara Gordon's book and what probably
helped Clayburgh to deliver her searing performance is that her
husband playwright David Rabe both produced and did the screenplay,
and the director was Jack Hofsiss who did The Elephant Man on stage to
such acclaim. Her Barbara is barely likeable - obsessive-compulsive,
hostile, chain-smoking and valium addicted. It's fascinating to see
how she conceals her pills, and clear that she lacks the support to
accomodate her impulsive decision to withdraw. She is told that valium
withdrawal is as traumatic as opiate withdrawal, and having an
alcoholic abusive lover doesn't help. As Barbara withdraws, Clayburgh
goes all out - convulsing, drooling, shrieking, maniacal, with wild
mad eyes and Frances Farmer hair. When she is eventually
institutionalised we see the anger that the valium had suppressed as
she rages at her therapist played by Dianne Wiest, who matches
Clayburgh. Wiest's first film had been Clayburgh's It's My Turn and
it's generous to think that Clayburgh helped her along with this role,
before she found greater success with Woody Allen. The film is
actually full of interesting actors in small roles - John Lithgow,
David Margulies, Kathleen Widdoes, Daniel Stern, Joe Pesci, Anne de
Salvo, Ellen Greene, Richard Masur, Jeffrey de Munn, and Geraldine
Page as a poet with cancer who Barbara is making a doco on. The poetry
we hear her recite is by Marsha Rabe. Occasionally Page slips into
Method-overdrive, with her hands and her little girl voice, and she
kills the meaning of the title, but mostly she is believable. The
casting of Nicol Williamson as Clayburgh's lover however doesn't quite
work. He is certainly creepy but we never understand his reluctance to
get Barbara medical help during her withdrawal. Hofsiss gives us two
great images - Clayburgh walking down a long corridor after having
been insulted by Page, aggresively wiping away her tears, and her
running on the beach in a white gown. The music of Stanley Silverman
and the Primavera String Quartet is particularly beautiful and
moving. Also Clayburgh is dressed very stylishly here, that is when
not draped in her crazy lady pyjamas.",966816000,14,2450,5.0818858560794045

I would like to help by getting  this movie and letting my sister, mother, and rest of the family view it.  It is very informative.  Please help.",947289600,4,409,4.153846153846154

229244,2,6300213951,"Good acting by Jill, but the story goes in too many directions.  A bit dated now too.  I had a hard time getting thru it. I don't know what the rave is about on this one.  Like I said, Jill kept me in the movie and even she overplayed it at times.",1401840000,,247,3.7115384615384617

229247,5,6300213951,"I read this book in the seventies and really liked it. I read it again recently when I found it in the Kindle store. When I saw it as a video I had to watch it. It not only gives a lot of insight into the world of drug addiction and withdrawal, but also how mental illness can be swept under the rug by the use of drugs such as valium. It's a great story and definitely worth watching.",1400112000,4,385,3.8860759493670884
229248,4,6300213951,"Geraldine  Page was incredible as usual.  Her acting is timeless, thoughtful and sensitive.  It is no different in this movie, though the treatment of the movie's issues was different than it would be now. Back then they were just putting their toe in the water.  However Ms. Page was all in for her character. She DOES deserve 5 stars...always!

The movie brushed lightly over a lot of topics that stem from the main plot but cannot follow them all in 90 minutes. Over the time since this was made, many have attempted to address the RX related issues. we are told from childhood to trust completely and never question the doctor's conclusions. The patient that went to his family doctor, putting his life and health in their hands has made themselves vulnerable to everyone.

In the rush to blame the patient for any poor result, no one recalls the drug companies shilling their drugs on T.V. or paying doctors to push their products regardless of whether it was the ideal treatment.  From the patient begging for real help, he is now a junkie supposedly manipulating the poor innocent doctor to get the drugs advertised and promoted by the drug company as his cure. He is judged as a person of weak and wicked character for needing the medication that was specifically prescribed and is making drug companies and doctors rich in the market they created. The patient just wants what he has been led to expect from seeing a licensed physician... appropriate medical care that makes him better, not worse.

And yippee! another opportunity...the rehab facilities, propaganda, products all blossoming to make more money to care for the use or misuse of the miracle product that they created and spent tons of money convincing everyone was the cure!  Note that most movies addressing addiction are about vulnerable, trusting women. Yow.  The movie did have lots of issues.

This movie was a beginning in an area that was a secret and lightly brushed on ethics in the media.  It remained a secret until big business realized there was more big money to be made on the backs of every trusting patient.  It's so common place and expected now that people readily talk about paying to go to rehab a multitude of times. In fact, it's become a universal salve for bad behavior. Note that the rehab in this movie is really a shared mental ward.

The movie is a baby step, but a giant step at this time in history. If you can appreciate it as documenting an evolution, you will enjoy this. And obviously...tons to think about!",1398211200,,2514,4.723112128146453
229249,5,6300213951,"If you've been taking this stuff for a while, a doctor is necessary in order to wean yourself off slowly, or else you end up with this accurately portrayed withdrawal nightmare, which isn't easy even with a supportive partner.",1392422400,2,226,4.82051282051282
229250,3,6300213951,It was informative and showed what people go through to withdraw from Valium.  The acting was good.  It showed how people can be addicted to drugs and turn their life around.,1389830400,,174,4.580645161290323

229253,5,6300213951,"This movie was from decades ago and STILL the drug company criminals cover up what evil drugs like valium, xanax( now banned in the UK), klonopin,ativan, ambien do to people. NEVER cold turkey off those filthy pills.. and YES the withdrawal symptoms this woman experienced are VERY real and VERY common.. if you never took these pills treat them like the cyanide they are.. For those on them look up the Ashton manual to get off them.. NEVER cold turkey.. this movie is very real what benzos/anti anxiety pills do to people..",1334361600,4,525,4.717391304347826
7805357,4,6300213951,"Interesting.  Barbara Gordon's memoir turned motion picture has added memorably to the collective body of evidence that benzodiazepines inflict grave harm if taken long term and even worse so in higher dosages, despite being doctor directed or sanctioned.  Many aspects of the film seem dated (especially the jarring horror movie sound effects) but the lived experience of problematic benzo withdrawal sadly remains as relevant-- if not more so-- than 3.5 decades ago.

I felt dismayed that the highest drama of her acute cold turkey withdrawal from daily 60 mg. Valium (diazepam) dosage built up over 10 years of physical dependency was entirely overshadowed by the domestic violence of her abusive alcoholic live in boyfriend's control maneuvers.  It greatly detracted from the supposed main subject of the film.  However, it's based on her true story and often times in life issues compile and collide together in disastrous ways.

Ideally, medicine would be practiced as a collaborative effort between medical practitioner and client with full disclosure (informed consent) to the benefit-risk ratio of various treatments or protocols.  What most frequently happens is--as depicted in this film-- where patients get blindly led down  a path of the allopathic 'there's a pill for every ill' motto with no advertised exit ramp that can then be extremely difficult to extricate oneself from after years of habit.  Gordon realized one day that after a decade of compliance to a proscribed direction that actually she's functionally worse off than before she began and wants out.  Only she had no clue as to what lay in wait for her in getting off her prescription medication.",1499126400,,1675,5.239700374531835
7805358,5,6300213951,I always liked this movie.  I was so surprised a person could take as much Valium as she did and still keep functioning without falling asleep!  Really good movie.,1498262400,,163,4.586206896551724
7805359,3,6300213951,Not half as good as the book,1490745600,,28,3.142857142857143
7805360,1,6300213951,Very misleading and dangerous information. Withdrawal symptoms from valium don't just clear up whilst having therapy. Infact quite the opposite. Having therapy whilst in Benzodiazepine withdrawal is not a good idea. Psychotherapy is hard enough whilst not in withdrawal from a prescription drug but having it whilst in withdrawal could be enough to push a person over the edge!  In a nutshell severe anxiety symptoms are a result of a withdrawal syndrome not some under lying illness like this film has you to believe!  And they will disappear when the brains Gaba receptors return to their natural homeostatis .. not from some talking therapy!!!,1470268800,2,646,5.201923076923077
