1884678,5,B00009KU8L,"Scourge of Worlds might possible be the first DVD game. I takes place in a rich and beautifully animated world, that is on the brink of destruction, and only you can save it! This is essentially a CG movie, but during the important decisions of the characters you get to make the choice of what they do next! This DVD is really great. The graphics are wonderful, about the only thing wrong with them is the hair, it looks real but does not move like hair should. Also they did a great job making the druid look old, they just forgot to put wrinkles on the rest of his body (they are all on his face). The spell effects are awesome. And the characters voices, actions, reactions, and facial expressions fit their personalities wonderfully. I feel that this is a must have DVD for every-one not just D&D fans!",1060560000,5,807,4.422818791946309
1884679,5,B00009KU8L,"As a gamer since middle school, I have wanted a good D&D movie to come out. But this takes it even beyond that. It is like an endless quest type book, where your decisions determine the outcome. I high recommend this DVD. Especially if you ever wondered what the game was about. For experience players, you will recognize everything in here. Especially check out the displacer beast. It had the best animation of all of it.",1060300800,,423,4.578947368421052
1884680,4,B00009KU8L,"Scourge of Worlds, is a 'pick a path' interactive movie. Excellent computer animation coupled with reasonably decent writing make for a fun romp. With about 990 variations to the story with 4 different possible outcomes, it allows you to view the movie a few times and make different decisions to alter the flow of the story. This is the first of this kind of movie I have ever seen, but I certainly hope it is not the last. Although this will never replace sitting around the table, dice in hand, and creating your own story playing Dungeons and Dragons, it is a good way to spend an hour. I recommend this for anyone who enjoys the fantasy worlds of Dungeons and Dragons.",1059955200,,673,4.524590163934426
1884681,5,B00009KU8L,"I wanted to take a gander at the new technology. Scourge opens up a whole new market for DVD's. Don't like the ending? Change it! At first, when watching it, I was skeptical. The character's hair (the most difficult thing to animate), looked really bad. Everyone appeared to be bald or have a hard 'skull-cap' of hair. No one seemed to blink, and the elf looked like she was made of plastic.  Later, I became engrossed in the story, and these things became somewhat less noticible.
My only disatisfaction that I had with this DVD, was that there really doesn't appear to be a way to solve the 'dvd' without violence. While I'm not anti-violence, I would like to be able to find a peaceful resolution to conflict... Without taking sides between the druids vs. the cleric. I guess its just me, but I hoped to be able to redeem the antagonist and still safeguard the empire, without slaughtering allies.  Ah well, I'm a romantic at heart.
On the positive side, I liked the cut-scene where the characters were crossing the desert and swearing at each other! The fighter was well-animated, (although I had my doubts he'd be sleeping in bed in full plate mail), LOL, and I thought the druids looked cool, even if they forgot to make the older druids hands and neck as badly wrinkled as his face.
This DVD was fun. I hope they explore this technology in other genre's and by other companies. In particular romance and sci/fi, I am no longer as much of a fantasy buff as I once was.",1058832000,,1474,4.51685393258427
1884682,4,B00009KU8L,"I just watched the preview DVD found in Wizard magazine (which is also in Dragon Mag) and thought it was pretty cool to be given the choice of where they will go and what they'll do next. It only allowed up to 4 choices but it's all I needed to buy the full DVD. When you choose a way that sets you apart from all the other characters, it ends the movie..BUT...it moves you back to the last choice you made so you can see what would have happened if you'd made a different choice. Then you can continue on from there.
Can anyone say ""God complex""? haha
The bad side is...You can't fast fwd or jump to the next scene. For instance:  You have watched the whole movie and now you want to start over and make some different choices and see an alternate ending. You've seen the whole beginning and want to jump to the next choice and get it moving along. Nope, nada, ain't gonna happen. So..sit back and watch the movie again.

Basically, what this company has done is made a D&D themed, fully animated (using motion capture for realistic movement - think Gollum in the LotR movies) ""Choose your own adventure"" style DVD.
You dictate the path of the main adventuring party (comprised of iconic D&D characters) as they try to unravel a mystery behind a group of elves, a cleric, and a key.  Choose correctly, and you will save the world.  Choose poorly, and you will die.
Common run time start to finish is about 45 minutes, but this can be longer or shorter depending on the path you take.  I was told that there are TONS (I believe the number was in the hundreds) of distinct paths you can take from start to finish, and the overall quality of the graphics, voice acting and animation are GREAT!
I plan on getting this as a thing to do during those late night parties.  Yelling at the TV and telling the characters what to do will become a staple entertainment again in my house.",1053475200,73,1148,4.4523809523809526

You essentially get to watch it like an animated movie and occasionally make decisions about what the characters will do, resulting in one of many endings. Great for a group or an individual and has excellent replay value.

1884742,5,B00009KU8L,"I am a school teacher / movie watcher / choose your own adventure fan / D&D enthusiast.  This DVD plays in my middle school classroom the last week of school each year.  The students love trying to beat it.  The movie gives you one ""re-do"" in the middle of the movie but if you die again, you must start over.

Having played through this with approximately 20 different classes of students, 10% of them beat it without dying on the first try. 60% of them beat it with one death and 30% of them die.  Animated sword fighting and death is not horribly gory but it's not meant for a 6 year old either.

Most of the early decisions are either obvious or not going to completely derail your party where later there are 3 or 4 significant decisions.

I clean my classroom with some students as other students watch the movie and this year I saw some events that I had not seen before.

If you like D&D or Choose your own adventure, it's a must have.  If you want to try something new, it's cheaper than taking kids to a real movie!",1325116800,,1025,4.242268041237113

I've always been a fan of ""Choose-Your-Own-Adventure"" style novels, and sometimes it seems a bit of a waste of potential that we don't have more movies operating under the same kind of concept. I mean, considering how often I yell helpful suggestions to the people on the TV screen, it seems a shame that more movies don't offer the ability for the viewer to control the outcome of the story. Of course, you could say that's what video games are for, especially in the wake of games with epic story lines and beautiful cinematics, a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Fantasy-X/dp/B00005TNI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Fantasy X</a>. All of which makes ""Scourge of Worlds"" a bit tricky to classify. Is it a movie that looks and feels like a video game, or is it a video game composed entirely of cutscenes?

Because I wasn't sure what to expect and had braced myself for the worst, I was actually surprised at how relatively good ""Scourge"" is. The graphics are a little archaic at this point - no worse than the graphics of, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Morrowind/dp/B0000CNUUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Morrowind</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everquest-I/dp/B000OU66JU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everquest I</a>, but not as sharp and well-defined as, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guild-Wars/dp/B001DI6O6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guild Wars</a>. The pathing is surprisingly well-paced - the choices are separated by about 10 minutes of screen time, meaning that the viewer isn't swamped with too many choices, nor bored with not enough.

Probably the biggest failing of ""Scourge"" is the characterization of the players. I almost would have preferred to have the words ""Lawful Good"" flash under the elven mage a few times, rather than have her keep repeating stilted dialogue about what the ""right"" thing to do is. Similarly, the thief character manages to squeeze in three or four references to ""getting paid"" in the first five minutes or so - it just feels repetitive and sloppy, like a quick and dirty attempt at characterization before the action. Which is fine, but since this is a D&D game/movie, I wish they'd just cut the cheesy characterization and flashed up a character sheet.

I'm being unfair, perhaps, to expect good dialogue and characterization out of this. But with the other video game elements stripped away, there's not much else here to hold the viewer besides the novelty. Hardcore gamers will enjoy going through this a few times for the novelty of it all, and I think children would enjoy the ""choose your path"" functionality quite a bit, but there's not a whole lot here to keep you coming back for more after the first few times. I recommend trying it out, just because it's so unusual and fun, and appreciating the spirit behind the effort and try not to look too closely at the blemishes.

This Scourge of Worlds (Special Collector's Edition) is worth getting over the Basic Edition because it allows a few more different endings, and the endings have real bad things happening to main villain of the story (like being eaten by a Beholder for example?)and thus offers a more satisfying ending.

1884767,5,B00009KU8L,"Okay so the D&D franchise has spawned some real stinkers. You have to really try to not hate them: D&D the Movie, Wrath of the Dragon God, Dragonlance. They're all really pretty awful.

This one though, is actually really good. I mean actually good, good. The name and concept are not only interesting and cool, but tie into the official lore of the Greyhawk campaign setting, involving relics of the war between the Baklunish and Suel civilizations, a cleric of Pholtus, and the signature characters who you never really get to see more than art from in the books. They do a good job fleshing them out, and you really get to enjoy their relationships. Lidda, particularly, is awesome.

The look of the movie is interesting. You can tell they made it under a tight budget--but rather than go small they stretched their resources to really do some bold things. The characters are stiff and some of the faces are pretty primative, but there's an edgy look to the design that I really like, full of cracked flats jutting through with bony spikes and weird architecture that looks like the bones of some great dead demon.

The look of the animation is reminicent of the cinematics from the original Fallout game, or from Planescape Torment, with the same kind of quirky style that transends the primative puppet-like look.

And unlike what I'd expected from a choose-your-own-adventure DVD, the choices matter. You can play the movie through several times and discover a really fun new nugget of information you hadn't seen before, or a few new exchanges between characters, or a totally new fight scene. Plus there's really a sense of uncertainty (which you totally don't get in other storytelling media) where you just don't know if the protagonists are going to make it, or if something really horrible is going to happen.

Both are totally possible.

What's not to like: the original version does not allow watching all the way through like a movie (special edition does), the graphics are excellent for the cgi medium but not by movie standards, and it can be fairly difficult to figure out how to get to the most successful ending (just ask yourself, ""What would Regdar do?"").

I have never played the Dungeons & Dragons game and I don't intend to, but I love this DVD.  I played it 3 times in a row the first day I received it.  I finally came to an ending where they didn't die.  I will definitely play it again to try for the other 3 endings.  You don't have to know D & D or read ""Endless Quest"" books to understand and enjoy this Interactive DVD.",1109376000,9,491,3.909090909090909
1884815,2,B00009KU8L,"Bizarre atempt at merging the Choose your own adventure style of books with an interactive DVD.  The end result is mixed.  With four possible endings you think you can really control the out come of the adventure, but in reality you can not.  Death and dismemberment await you at all turns  with an anti climatic ending.

As for the CGI animation.  It comes no where close to Beast Wars or The CGI GI-Joes.  The animation is not fluid and tends to bind on the characters.  If you can find it really cheap, buy it but after you watch it once this disk will collect dust on your shelf.

No plot development, no character development, more interaction between monsters and enemies in Balder's Gate 2 or Ever Quest.  I was disapointed to say the least.

1884817,4,B00009KU8L,"I am curious as to whether or not any of my fellow reviewers have ever actually played the game? This movie was not made to stand on its own, it was made as a supplement to the D and D universe. The characters of Mialee, Lidda, and Redgar are iconic characters who have been known to D and D gamers for several years. The story is not really meant to tell the background of the characters or how they got together, rather it is designed to tell a part of their story, one of the many of adventures that the group had together. Personally, I liked the movie. Yes there are only 4 endings but, what do you want from them? This is the first D and D choose your own adventure DVD, and in fact the first choose you own adventure DVD I have seen. I have watched the story 6 different times each time garnering new information and have yet to get to the forth ending. If one was so inclined they could go through the movie a dozen times and still probably not see every scene combination available.  As for people who buy it and are dissapointed because its a poor game, news flash...its not a game. It is a DVD choose your own adveture story based on a game. I liked being able to watch the movie and recognize Mialee casting a fireball, or the group fighting a earth elemental summoned by a druid. Yes it is a very basic concept of the game but, thats all it was meant to be. A first time shot in the dark to see how people react to such a concept. Anyways I highly reccomend this movie to anyone who plays D and D or similar fantasy RPG's. Just keep it mind this isn't the best fantasy story out there but its is definatly a good start to the choose your own adventure genre.

1884818,3,B00009KU8L,"I bought this DVD on a whim from an un-named mass-market retailer (rhymes with ""wall"" and ""mart"") and thought it'd be an ok movie.  And it was.
The computer animation is detailed, but left me with the feeling that it's just not well polished.  Either unpolished or polished too much to the point of being dull.  The dialogue works, and the plotline is very linear.  However, for a bunch of buddies getting together to laugh at a movie that takes itself WAY too seriously it might be kind of fun.
Overall, this movie is like most party favors: best as a rental, but not worth shelling out $20+ for.",1089072000,2,597,4.4495412844036695

As far as games go, its very simple.  You watch a small cinematic and then choose what you want the group or character to do from a given menu of options.  Thats really it.  Don't expect more than that.
The graphics are pretty.  The characters personalities are sorta campy, but all in all a pretty good effort.
Supposedly there are 990+ combinations of stories.  I have not, nor will I ever see them all.  However, that isn't such a bad thing as I can come back to this DVD time and time again and the story will probably change every time.
Its a nice thing to have for game night as it provides a short break from what ever games your group normally plays.

On the box it advertises 990 different story combinations- which I'm sure is true, but when those 'different' options are: Do this, that, and that - option two you change the first thing, but not the second or the third it gets a little tedious.
The story could use a little work - it's a predictable DnD story and offers only a passing insight into the characters on screen.  But, if you're looking for a way to explain DnD to friends - it's a nice option.  I hope they put out a sequel with the 'different' options being truly different storyline options and not means to the same ends.",1072310400,2,706,4.449612403100775
1884822,4,B00009KU8L,"If you're trying to introduce some one to D&D, this is a MUCH better alternative than the live action movie (which doesn't even function properly as firewood).
You need a basic understanding of the characters of medieval fantasy to follow the plot which, at first, appears simple - but you won't understand it until you play through the DVD at least 3-4 times.  This makes Scourge of Worlds more like the tabletop experience than expected, because adventures often have hooks and information that players end up missing - never understanding the entire story and motivations of heroes and antagonists.
Scourge of worlds gives you that, with some surprising sense of humor, and over 900 combinations of options.  I've had this DVD since its release months and months ago, and saw a new cinematic last night for the first time.

The animation is above average a bit better than what you see in some playstation 2 games. The plot is simple and straight foward and the main characters are fairly likable. At one point in the story i was concerned and sometimes shocked at what i saw happen to the main characters. Overall a good purchase. I hope in future installments they would place more choices and maybe interactive puzzles or the like. this dvd is perfect for those who read those choose your own adventure books from the 80s...,1066694400,7,597,4.588785046728972

This DVD makes use of your remote to allow you to choose from a number of different story paths.  Though the package states there are 900+ combinations, it would be better said that it is about 4 hours worth of viewing.  In my eyes, this is a huge amount of time for such a simple, yet interesting story.
Like any first attempt, Scourge could have used more options and a more detailed plot.  However, I think the best addition would be to not stop the action while making choices, but to have the characters continue debating or the fights continue while you decide what to do.  The pauses are annoying because they detract from the pacing of the movie, but these stops can be overlooked in light of the uniqueness of this DVD.
All in all, Scourge of Worlds is a great first attempt at creating a movie that the viewer can control, but it is a movie that will be watched once then gather dust on a shelf.  Due to this, I would highly suggest renting it if possible.",1063670400,11,1208,4.248908296943231

It definately feels like a sequel is coming as the story is not complete.
  On the downside I finished the entire story (with all paths I could find) in an evening.  I think it's best value would be to split the cost with a friend or two and just share the disc.

First, this game's choices almost always follow the same structure:
1) make a choice--choose wrong, you die OR
2) make a choice--choose wrong, you will fail later

My problem with this is that it undermines one of the best things about Dungeons and Dragons: the sense of adventure. There is no real exploration because there are consequences if you don't follow the proper path toward the solution. I'm not saying there should not be an overall goal, but it would have been more entertaining if you could explore the world, have a handful of inconsequential puzzles and battles, and maybe gain a few treasures along the way. This is definitely worth playing through ONCE. A second time because you will want to see if there is anything you missed. But the problem is, during your second playthrough, you will get tired quickly of all the same sequences you already watched and you will probably not try it a third time ... at least not for many years.

I would recommend this as a purchase for collectors of D&D fantasy game products and collectors of fantasy DVDs. Also, its great to play it a couple of times, then pass it along to friends. Some *might* play this DVD game more than 3 times, but I would say the ones who do are few and far between.",1442188800,,1501,4.470802919708029
