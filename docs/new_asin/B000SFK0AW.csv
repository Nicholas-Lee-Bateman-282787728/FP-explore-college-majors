3715015,5,B000SFK0AW,"I'm sure my blood pressure dropped considerably watching this wonderful dvd. The inclusion of music added a lot to the overall enjoyment. The mixture of mountains, trees, animals, rivers, and foliage provided a very pleasurable and relaxing experience.",1390262400,,252,5.657894736842105
3715016,1,B000SFK0AW,"While this video had a couple nice scenic shots, it would make a much better screen saver than a video. One of the things that detracted from the video was the fact that it held essentially still shots of some images for 30 to 60 seconds or more. While that may be acceptable for a screen saver, it is not for a video. I found myself using the fast-advance on my DVD player's remote control a lot in this video. Some still shots in the video were held so long, even my DVD Player's fast advance seemed frustratingly slow. I would not recommend this.",1388534400,,549,4.288461538461538
3715017,3,B000SFK0AW,"The quality of the HD video is just OK (not superb), the music is simply bad but that is fixed easily (just mute your TV and play something you like instead). The images of the fall are beautiful but not exactly what I would call representative of fall. The video segments for all 4 seasons are too short for my taste but it is still acceptable.",1378944000,,345,4.242424242424242
3715018,5,B000SFK0AW,"I enjoy the out-of-doors in Washington.
This DVD highlights many interesting areas.
I recommend this DVD to all outdoor enthusiasts.
The music adds to the enjoyment.",1368144000,,165,5.384615384615385
3715019,2,B000SFK0AW,"I've seen many other nature and travel videos, e.g., Art Wolfe's Travel to the Edge and BBC's Earth series. in regular DVD format with much better HD image-quality than this Blu-ray format of The Four Seasons. Even PBS nature programs at HD-TV channel have much better image-quality. The videography of many post-card pretty landscapes was only as ordinary as many tourists' travel videos. As to the music, unless you 'Play All' the whole video from beginning to end, there's no variation of the musical score for each scene selected from the menu --- the same music accompaniment at the first scene is played repeatedly in a loop for every other season selection, which becomes boring after a while. Two stars only for the soothing instrumental music with no selection option.",1310083200,3,777,4.984615384615385
3715020,2,B000SFK0AW,"Based on some comments left on several ""Living landscapes"" volumes by Mr. Heumann (from the producing Studio), I purchased nine volumes from this blu-ray series - all from the same Amazon seller - with the certainty that I could turn the music off, and hear just nature's sounds.

Out of the nine I purchased, there are THREE (""World's most beautiful Sunrises & Sunsets"", ""Four seasons"" and ""Bali"" - sadly, among my favourite ones), that do not provide any audio option at all (I made dead sure about that): you just have to watch them with the music playing.

I figure they're part of an older batch, but I believe the producing Studio should have made sure that ALL of them were pulled out of the market, before reassuring the customers about the adio specs.

Needless to say, I'm very disappointed by all of that. I've been meaning to contact the producing Studio to get a replacement but couldn't find an email contact for the life of me.

It's a shame, cause I'd be happy about my purchase if it wasn't for that.",1302739200,5,1017,4.571428571428571
3715021,5,B000SFK0AW,"As a lover of Nature DVDs, I can only say that this is a good addition to my collection.  The scenes are varied.  The photography is excellent and even the music is very nice.  I believe Nature lovers will enjoy this DVD.",1283904000,3,221,4.214285714285714

8325715,4,B000SFK0AW,"We really enjoy these types of quieting, blood pressure lowering, videos.  I am a day dreamer given the time to do so, which if you are like me is very rare.  Life is too busy , this dvd was especially enjoyable for us day dreamers that like to stare at a lovely nature scene for a period of time. For me the lengthy time a scene was on the screen gave me time to reflect on  the beauty and drink in the scene and dream my own thoughts.  I will be watching this often.",1413590400,,468,3.9468085106382977
