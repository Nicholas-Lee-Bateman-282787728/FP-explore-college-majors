7985086,1,B00008L3T0,"Plenty of talent gets ignited in this failed satire based on the ""Alan Smithee"" pseudonym. Justly recognized as one of the all-time disasters, ""Burn Hollywood Burn"" (1998) lies on the screen like cinematic roadkill. Writer Joe Eszterhas takes perverse pride in surpassing the awfulness of ""Showgirls,"" but offers no camp value whatsoever. The ""in-joke"" is dubious and painfully unfunny.",1292457600,2,386,5.559322033898305
7985087,1,B00008L3T0,"BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN makes Ed Wood look like a misunderstood auteur.
Sly is actually hilarious and likable, so is Jackie Chan.
Seeing the late, talented, Richard Jeni here is a reminder how much we miss his standup routine.
Ryan O'Neal, as always, is painfully, awfully inept as an actor and should have stayed out of showbusiness altogether.
R. Evans looks like a walking train wreck and nearly makes one vomit to have to see that heavily-tanned cowhide skin of his.

And Naomi Baca? Hands down--the best thing about this dreck of a flick. She appears at the end, and briefly at that, sitting next to her husband Eszterhas--but what a lovely, ever-so-gorgeous woman! Wow!
She should have played the role of Evan's bimbo, instead of the real bimbo they used.  We get it: Evans was out attempting to dip that tired wick of his and gave the chick the part.
Bottom line: BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN is one of the worst ever made--and they had the money; they even had some decent actors. What a waste.
Joe, I want my money back. Your memoir HOLLYWOOD ANIMAL is far superior to this excreta. Just to show you we can be fair and that we (some of us) actually read books--unlike the Tinsel Town retards.",1263513600,3,1188,4.599056603773585
7985088,3,B00008L3T0,"First of all, this movie is not for everybody.  It is a satire, in the vein of Simon with Alan Arkin.

The casting was good, and the cameos were well done.  But the movie is full of inside jokes.  Anybody that has not worked in or around the entertainment industry will probably not get them.

And the irony is that the director of this movie himself (Arthur Hiller)had his credit replaced with Alan Smithiee.

In fact, this is the last official ""Alan Smithee"" movie.  The Directors Guild of America retired the name, and will now use names made for each movie.

If you like satire movies, or are a Hollywood Insider, give this a look.  And you will see a lot of truth in it.",1252108800,3,675,4.336
7985089,3,B00008L3T0,"When it came out, this satire of Hollywood filmmaking (Alan Smithee is the alias directors take when their film has been butchered by the producers and they are too ashamed of the final product) was reviewed as if it was about the worst film ever made. Actually, this movie is nowhere nearly as bad as it's supposed to be. It's artless and amateurish at times, but it's also quite funny. You've got to have some interest in the Hollywood scene to appreciate it. Otherwise, it might look like a waste of time and celluloid.",1204156800,2,522,4.5638297872340425
7985090,1,B00008L3T0,"Not much to say, considering that the majority of the reviews here have already warned people off this turkey.

The main culprit for the movies downfall is the terrible script, though the over the top performances from all really help sink it. You have to feel sorry for some of the stars who signed on, especially Whoopi Goldberg, who as an OSCAR winning actress, really deserves better. Eric Idle comes off unfunny, even irritating, which, as a Python star I'd never thought would be possible. Sly Stallone seems fed up, but maybe thankful for the work after his career was beginning to dry up (though his career seems to be revived at the moment).

It says a lot when the parody (this film) seems worse than the movie genre it is taking a shot at. Some movies are so bad that they have a 'secondary audience' who watch to laugh at it. This is just bad, and, very embarrassing. Avoid. Full stop.",1200182400,5,897,4.530864197530864
7985091,1,B00008L3T0,"I cannot think of too many stinkers that even come close to this film of such unbearable awfulness it is an abomination that it exists. Smarmy, lame, and unfunny in turns and undeserving of the moniker mockumentary. It is actually a self-congratulatory piece of trash that grates on the viewer with its winking in-jokeness.",1169424000,,323,5.0
7985092,5,B00008L3T0,"Somehow, Director Walter Hill managed to attract a premium cast to this horrible script, which probably sounded funny as a one line pitch. Yes, this film stars Stallone, Chan, Coolio, Eric Idle and CHUCK MOFO D!!! Oh, and err, Rayn O'Neal, and umm... Whoopi Goldberg.

5 Stars for the cast. OK 3 stars for the cast the HIGHEST score imaginable for Coolio's Hair. Average: 5 stars",1134864000,,379,4.742424242424242
7985093,1,B00008L3T0,"This film might have actually turned out decently if it wasn't a mocumentary.  The basic premise is, If directors use the name Alan Smithee on bad films instead of their own, what does a director actually NAMED Alan Smithee do? He burns the film.  There is a lot of comic potential here: the main issue with his name, clips from a so-bad-its-funny bomb, Smithee going mad and trying to steal his own film, etc.  Plus, the actor playing Smithee is none other than Eric Idle of Monty Python!  So how did this film turn out so badly?

First of all, Eszterhas decided to make this a mockumentary.  While the fake documentary form has worked wonderfully in movies like Spinal Tap, it only emphasizes this movie's failings.

The story line is horribly muddled.  The entire movie is awkwardly chopped into sections that are introduced, for some inexplicable reason, by Woody Woodpecker music.  Even more problematic, Alan Smithee (one of the few funny people in this) barely appeared in the movie! Instead, we are ""treated"" to interviews by people who knew Smithee.  Doesn't Eszterhas know that a good story (in whatever medium) should be SHOWN to the audience, not TOLD? This guy would flunk a basic creative writing class if he submitted this script.  We should be watching the main action actually taking place, not a bunch of repulsive people repeatedly rambling on about those events.

Which brings us to my second point, the characters.  Most of the characters are talking heads that are all meant to satirize various people/archetypes in Hollywood.  While vicious satire of the entertainment industry can be hilarious if done right (watch the Canadian show ""The Industry"" if you can find it), this movie only manages to poison itself with its own bile.  One of the worst offenders is Ryan O'Neal.  I saw him in this movie when it first came out on video, and the sight of his name ANYWHERE still makes me wince.  The celebrity cameos aren't much better, though Jackie Chan is at least amusing.  Overall, this movie just made me feel sick to my stomach by the end.

If Burn, Hollywood, Burn had not been a mockumentary it might have actually been a funny movie.  I can't even recommend this to Eric Idle/Monty Python fans, as he barely appears in it.  If you're looking for a funny Hollywood spoof, buy Bowfinger on DVD or, better yet, read Little Me by Patrick Dennis (a mock-autobiography of ""that Great Star of Stage, Screen and Television, Belle Poitrine"").",1113091200,,2460,4.7957244655581945
