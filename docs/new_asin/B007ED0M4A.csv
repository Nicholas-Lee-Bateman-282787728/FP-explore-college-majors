5079437,1,B007ED0M4A,I bought this item not knowing that it didn't contain the live-action segments.  I was sorely disappointed when I played it.  Don't buy this.  The show isn't as good without Captain Lou.,1377907200,18,186,4.75

5079439,5,B007ED0M4A,As long as you're ok with the live action segments not being included you should be happy with this DVD. The picture and sound quality is just as good as the old shout factory sets and also includes the same extras as those.,1346112000,4,224,4.232558139534884
5079440,5,B007ED0M4A,I have no idea why this is called the Collectors edition. I was hoping they were gonna release the whole Super Show in it's entirety with the Zelda ones included. I found out it is just the animated segments of the Super Show. This is a good set for Adults who think the Live action segments are childish for them. The Extras are the same as the Shout Factory version.,1340236800,11,368,4.271428571428571
8515219,2,B007ED0M4A,Not what I thought I was getting. I thought it was the whole show live action and all not just the cartoon part. It's great if that's all you want.,1523404800,,147,3.933333333333333

8515227,4,B007ED0M4A,"The Super Mario Bros. Super Show volume 1 DVD BOX has animated segment episodes crammed into 2 DVDs, but once you see the animated intro inside the show and the end of the first episode, the next episodes plays like a Dragon Ball Z Remastered Marathon Mode because the opening animated intro and closing credits play once per DVD! Also at the end of the disc it loops the episodes again.

This DVD BOX is good and accepatble at least, but if I just seen these episodes I'd leave it playing for other concerns. Usually I'd just go watch the real full length episodes on Netflix subscription. :(

Edit: The REAL reason why full length half hour episodes aren't on these DVDs is because of Cyndi Lauper.",1427500800,2,700,4.503937007874016
