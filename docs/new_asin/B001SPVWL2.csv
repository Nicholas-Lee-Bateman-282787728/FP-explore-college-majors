3786113,5,B001SPVWL2,"This DVD is one of the best bargains around - it runs for an hour and 48 minutes with 8 full earth-friendly episodes to entertain your children while they learn how to take care of the planet:

The Perfect Carrot - George learns how to grow carrots but when a friend's bunnies go missing, he has to make a decision: the bunnies or the carrot?

Everything Old Is New Again - the city is awarding a prize to the building that collects the most recycling. George goes out of his way to win collecting recyclables, but doesn't realize they have to be used first!

Curious George and the Trash - George throw's out the Man's with the Yellow Hat's yellow hat by mistake. He learns about the city's garbage system while trying to recover it.

Much Ado About Nothing - George learns how to make compost - or so he thinks. Pretty soon every container around is filled with ""compost"".

George Digs Worms - George's prize worm accidentally ends up in the wrong box - he's off to find it before it's used as fish bait.

Seed Trouble - George learns how to plant a vegetable garden but mixes the seeds by mistake. Can he figure out which seeds grow which plants?

Ice Station Monkey - George is off to the Antarctic on a research mission with lots of penguins.

Shipwrecked With Hundley - The Man with the Yellow Hat, George, the doorman and Hundley go sailing but end up shipwrecked on an island. The Man and the doorman go off to explore and George and Hundley get lost. Will they be stuck on the island?

The episodes are suitable for children ages 2+ and contain valuable real-life lessons after each episode, as children learn how to make compost and how  to cook with local produce, among others.",1246406400,23,1689,4.454545454545454

3786126,5,B001SPVWL2,This is a favorite DVD for my kids. Nice to snuggle down at night or watch on a rainy day.,1370217600,,90,3.55
3786127,5,B001SPVWL2,"My children love learning with George and they particularly like the part where ""real kids"" mimic many of the things that George was just learning.  It's fun and creative.  it's also common sense like making compost and planting vegetables.  it gives kids practical skills and knowledge to use.",1368316800,,294,5.083333333333333
3786128,5,B001SPVWL2,"My (almost) 3 year old loves Curious George and this is one of his very favorite DVDs. He especially likes the Perfect Carrot episode wherein George sacrifices his perfect carrot for the sake of some lost bunnies. When we travel, this is one of the few DVDs that accompanies us.",1368230400,,278,4.58
3786129,5,B001SPVWL2,My son loves Curious George and so do I! Any Curious George movie is absolutely worth the purchase. My son has a huge collection of Curious George movies that we both enjoy and learn from. Highly recommended!,1367020800,,208,4.648648648648648
3786130,5,B001SPVWL2,"I am so sick of the programming on Disney Channel teaching my boy that if you want to get down from a tree you need a giant piece of celery to slide down.  We try and give our child other things to do, but the reality is that sometimes it is just more appropriate to let him watch some TV...if you can stand the agenda of the people making the programs.

Then we ran across Curious George and were relieved.  No agendas, no politically correct subject matter, no illogical logic.  The first time we watched one it was like taking your shoes off after a long walk on a summer day...aaahhhh.

To top it off, each DVD only costs around $10. I ended up buying 10 different titles and have been happy with every one...thus I will copy and paste this review on each one of them.

This is one happy dad who loves that annoying monkey.",1366070400,,827,4.235668789808917
3786131,5,B001SPVWL2,"We don't watch cable, my four year old has never seen most popular t.v. shows.  The only time is when he's at other people's homes, which is rare.  But recently my grandma, who insists that my children watch television, bought him a curious George movie, so I took a look at it.  They really are sweet little cartoons.  I couldn't pick up on any indoctrination or any subtle underlying messages.  They seem like good learning cartoons.  My son just learned how to make compost from other kids on this DVD.  Pretty cute!  Highly recommend.",1365120000,,538,4.648936170212766
3786132,5,B001SPVWL2,"great for the grandkids

3786133,5,B001SPVWL2,"My 2 year old loves watching Curious George on pbs while at home.  We must have several dozen episodes recorded.  Now when we go on road trips, we are able to watch Curious George thanks to the dvds.  They are the same episodes you watch on tv. Each DVD contains 8 shows totaling over 90 minutes of pure entertainment for our child to watch.",1355270400,,341,4.296875
3786134,4,B001SPVWL2,This DVD  is entertaining and educational and cute. My sons enjoyed and even learned a thing or two about recycling,1332720000,,115,4.75
3786135,3,B001SPVWL2,"My son (& I ) love curious George. It's a great show & these episodes are no different. What I don't like are the US DVDs, they are rife with ads. In Australia we have limitations on kids ads so I was surprised they were on there at all, the UK versions I'd bought in the past did not. But the US ones have obnoxious ads for things like 'chunky cheese' (!) at the start. They also have educational snippets between episodes which are kind of OK, although a little seasame st for my tastes.

The UK DVDs have the same shows in a more pleasant format.",1330732800,3,549,4.130841121495327
3786136,5,B001SPVWL2,"Contrary to a previous viewer's worry that this is leftist propaganda, this is as cute as any other George DVD.  I am a conservative so I wasn't thrilled with the title either, but many of these episodes just teach about gardening and recycling (nothing any given preschool program might talk about). The topics are sweet and silly, like all George videos!",1327363200,,356,4.836065573770492
3786137,5,B001SPVWL2,"This is a great DVD, as are the others we have in the series. My son would watch ""George and carrot"" everyday if I let him.",1322006400,,123,3.769230769230769
3786138,5,B001SPVWL2,"My daughter is a huge fan of Curious George and this seems to be a personal favorite of hers.  The episodes are largely focused around sustainable concepts (recycling, agriculture, etc.).  Some of the concepts are relayed at too elementary of a level (i.e. plastic bottles are recycled back into plastic bottles - which is largely not the case) and set a foundation for misconceptions, but overall the information is good.  I have noticed that other comments have accused PBS of propagandizing a socialist agenda or some other such nonsense, but it's certainly not the case (unless agriculture and sustainable solid waste disposal are socialist concepts).

The value is great, at 108 minutes of quality children's programming that I don't have to worry about filtering, I was all about the price.  My daughter is 21 months old and her vocabulary is amazing.  I won't attribute it entirely to Curious George, but I found that she was far more responsive to the show as it uses actual dialog as opposed to the more linguistic abstractions that are found in other shows (i.e. Baby Einstein, Teletubbies, etc.).  The shows are enough to capture the attention of a child at 18 months and feature enough variety to hold it for at least several months.",1311292800,4,1245,4.9
3786139,1,B001SPVWL2,"My child does NOT need PBS to brainwash her with a socialist agenda of ""green"". I WILL teach her to responsible, which MAY include SOME aspects of the so-called ""green movement"", but she will also be taught that George was FORCED into doing this DVD by his evil agent!!!
It is good to see that this DVD is selling MUCH LESS than the other NORMAL ones.
Stop it PBS. No wonder you are loosing funding right and left.
For those who want to scold me for this review or say how ridiculous I am ..... don't!

By the way, Robin Williams has a MUCH better alternative to ""green"" ...... create the Ford Colon and require everyone to each at Taco Bell to fuel their cars ..... IT WORKS!",1307664000,4,676,4.28125
3786140,5,B001SPVWL2,My grandchildren call him Monkey George and they watched the tape so much that they wore it out.  This one is to replace the worn one.,1303776000,4,134,4.153846153846154
3786141,5,B001SPVWL2,Great!! Great!!! Great!!!! What more can you say about this little monkey!! Our son watches all his Curious George videos over and over again and this one has some of his favorites on it. Learning made fun and enjoyable for the whole family. Even Grandma sits and laughs along with the video. Unlike many childrens video's these do not talk down or dumb down the story line is something to hold the attention of children of various ages. I recommend for ages 1 to 103!,1299974400,2,468,4.517647058823529
3786142,5,B001SPVWL2,"I wanted to create my own review after reading the lone 1-star review.  This is not a Curious George recreation of ""An Inconvenient Truth.""  There is no appearence from PETA.  George doesn't attack whaling ships.  Its just a bunch of great shows that incorporate themes related to the outdoors and gardening.  All of the episodes are wonderfully done and great for all ages.  Thanks PBS for making such an educational cartoon that is enjoyable to watch over and over!",1281744000,8,467,4.848101265822785

8340048,4,B001SPVWL2,"My daughter loves curious george and we wanted something we can have on the go, so I purchased the DVD. It comes with 8 shows. I didn't give it 5 stars because I really would have appreciated an option to watch the movie with the audio in Spanish. We are a bilingual household and try to speak to our little one mostly in Spanish but when most of television is in English its a bit difficult to keep it up. Therefore its always nice to find DVDs with the spanish audio available. Overall, this is a great DVD that keeps my 2 year old entertained.",1490227200,,546,4.20952380952381

8340053,5,B001SPVWL2,"It automatically plays on its own and is over an hour long which is very important. When my two year old daughter who sleeps by herself in her room in a toddler bed wakes up in the middle of the night as long as this is playing with a low or no sound she will watch a little and fall right back to sleep. If you have an energy star tv then you do not need a night light going this! I think this one is great as it teaches kids about recycling, planting and such things. She really loves it. And for 5 bucks it is money well spent! I plan to buy a few of the other ones too in the future. We have netflix and stuff which she watches Curious George on but having the dvd is good back up for when the internet, power or such goes out. Also great if you have a portable dvd player in your vehicle which we do.

I highly recommend this product.

automatically starts,
teaches good things,
