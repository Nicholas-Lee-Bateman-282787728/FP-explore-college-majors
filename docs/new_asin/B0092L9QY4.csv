8534764,1,B0092L9QY4,"Thomas Tadlock knows his information, but not how to produce a good quality DVD. The audio is horribledifficult to hear what he's saying. I'm returning this DVD. Doesn't even face the camera because it's a live event and camera is positioned off to the side of the room.which might explain the difficulty in hearing him.
So I've returned this DVD because of it. Not only does it cost you to ship the return back to Amazon, but I'm being charged $8.98 for a restocking fee! Don't buy this!",1430438400,,488,4.556818181818182
8534765,1,B0092L9QY4,"The video and audio quality are very poor.  I am listening to it now and can't make it out much.  The pictures on the cover and back are misleading.  The video quality is very poor.  I'm returning it.  Thomas Tadlock does know his trade but this video quality is not worth a penny, I can't make a thing out.  I'm very disappointed.",1430352000,,331,4.258064516129032
