4988389,5,B006H3KQSK,"I really loved this Samurai movie set in the Edo period of Japan. Some may find the plot a bit slow and plodding but I liked how the slow build up of the story and characters only added to the amount of tension in the final sword fight scene. You know the fight is coming but you're on the edge of your seat when it finally does.  The beginning of the movie is seen partly through a series of flashbacks which can be a bit confusing at first but bit by bit it all falls into place, is revealed and becomes clear.  The lead actor Etsushi Toyokawa gives a stunning and stoic performance as do all the actors in this fine film. I fell in love with his character. I won't give a synopsis of the film as I don't want to spoil anything for other lovers of the Samurai genre. I'm very glad I got this movie for my Asian film library and it is a definite must watch again movie. Some may say it's a formulaic Samurai movie but as I said I just loved everything about it, the costuming, sets, cinematography, subtle nuances, treachery, deceit, romance, loyalty, intrigue and of course a great sword fight. It's all in there.",1329523200,76,1115,4.254716981132075
4988390,5,B006H3KQSK,"I won't repeat what everyone wrote below - it is a great flick! Super production values, great acting ....Love it - with one reservation.....

The penultimate scene with extravagant the sword fight  is overdone. The survival of the protagonist  in light of  multiple strikes, cuts, wounds and  stabbings just prior to using  the  title strike,  just didn't work for me. That scene was impossible, implausible and incredible and detracted from the  plot and  impact of the film.

Nevertheless, a good film.",1436313600,2,505,5.111111111111111

(One of my favorite films ever is Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri."") This is a slow-paced movie, but it's filmed beautifully, and so the visuals held my interest. Also the story builds slowly, but it does build. The ending is quite powerful too--nothing I will forget easily, if at all.

4988397,3,B006H3KQSK,"This film, directed by Hideyuki Hirayama, is a fine film. Fine acting, excellent cinematography, excruciating detail of Japan in the 1800s.

This story concerns the events of a guard who spends a years confinement in house arrest for the assassination of a royal concubine, but later is appointed to be a royal bodyguard.  Good story too.

But ...

The movie is a little too slow-moving for my tastes. Much of the script deals with interpersonal intrigues. While everything I said before is true, the slow pace of the story detracts against its many virtues.",1429920000,2,558,4.904255319148936

What clear, simple storytelling -- it makes you care for the people in it, even as it builds relentlessly toward a climax in which every measured cinematic stroke that went before pays off by creating the deepest emotions in the midst of a paroxysm of bloody slaughter. I love the echoes, in that gory and deeply disturbing final battle scene, of two other great samurai classics: HARIKIRI&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harakiri-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0009WIE2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harakiri (The Criterion Collection)</a>and SWORD OF DOOM (Daibosatsu Toge)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sword-of-Doom-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0007989YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sword of Doom (The Criterion Collection)</a>.

4988434,4,B006H3KQSK,"A film doesn't need to be innovative to be good. Sometimes it is enough to do a straight take on a classic genre, to hit all the beats in perfect rhythm and fluently play a familiar tune. ""Sword of Desperation"" does just that. In the opening scene when loyal samurai retainer Kanemi Sanzaemon walks up to Lady Renko, the favored concubine of Kanemi's lord Ukyo Tabu, and stabs her in the heart, you know just what you are going get. And that it will be good.

The genre here is author Fujisawa Shuhei (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bamboo-Sword-And-Other-Samurai-Tales/dp/4770030053/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bamboo Sword: And Other Samurai Tales</a>), whose work has come to define modern Japanese samurai fiction.  Far from any kind of ""Kill Bill"" action, Fujiwara wrote introspective, melancholy tales that dove deep into the psychology of the rank-and-file soldiers or Edo period Japan. Fujisawa's heroes are not the leaders and great lords of the castle, but stolid, loyal retainers who must fight a constant inner battle between personal feelings and duty to lords who often don't deserve loyalty.

Ever since director Yamada Yoji re-introduced the world to Fujisawa with his samurai trilogy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Samurai/dp/B00065GX0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Samurai</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hidden-Blade/dp/B000FS9FIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hidden Blade</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-and-Honor/dp/B0012SY0E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love and Honor</a>) --arguably the finest samurai films since Kurosawa stepped behind the camera--Fujisawa has become the Zane Grey of Japanese samurai fiction. Kurotsuchi Mitsuo directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Samurai-I-Loved/dp/B0028YW3EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Samurai I Loved</a>&nbsp;based on a Fujisawa tale. And now director Hirayama Hideyuki gives us another.

""Sword of Desperation"" (Japanese title: ""Hisshiken Torisashi"" or ""The Bird-Catching Desperate Sword"") is a by-the-numbers Fujisawa story (It even takes place in Unasaka-han, the fictional province that serves as the background for most of his samurai yarns). All of the familiar tropes are present; two righteous men being slowly moved into a confrontation that neither of them desires. A gloomy man living his life under a death sentence who suddenly finds a reason to live in an unlikely love affair, but whose sense of duty is stronger than his passion. Political corruption at the high levels, and lords who use their retainer's high ideals against them, manipulating them like pieces on a chessboard into battles without honor.

And then of course, there is the ""Sword of Desperation"" itself. Like Fujisawa's ""The Hidden Blade,"" the title refers to a secret sword technique known by only one man, an indefensible strike that can only be used at the moment of greatest desperation--the moment of explosive death that we spend the entire film waiting for.

Director Hirayama doesn't play around too much with ""Sword of Desperation.""  Fujisawa's tales are, by their nature, intimate affairs, and Hirayama tries to capture that.  He adds a few touches of cinematic flair.  The mirroring of the opening Noh performance with the final scene worked very well.  His use of the flashback device that fades to black-and-white is effective, but not consistent, leading to some confusion about when you are in a flashback.

A strong cast is necessary for this type of film, and fronting ""Sword of Desperation"" is veteran actor Toyokawa Etsushi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/20th-Century-Boys/dp/B002PHVHKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">20th Century Boys</a>) as Kanemi Sanzaemon. Kanemi is a tormented man, whose wife's death left him depressed and suicidal, until he saw an honorable out for himself by assassinating the favored yet controlling concubine of his lord, the spoiled, weak-willed Ukyo Tabu. Toyokawa gives Kanemi the gravity and presence necessary for the role, and plays all of the faces of Kanemi from groomed court samurai, to scruffy prisoner and wander, to the demon he eventually becomes. Toyokawa is playing somewhat against type in this film, which is probably helped him win the 2011 Japan Academy Award for this role.

Equally strong is Ikewaki Chizuru as Rio, the niece of Kanemi whose love for her uncle is more than familiar. Kikkawa Koji plays a good opposite as Lord Obiya, the righteous noble whose path sets him directly against Kanemi, even though they should be standing together.

If there is any real weakness to ""Sword of Desperation,"" it is that the film is too by-the-numbers. A straight take on a classic genre can give you a very good film, but not a great one.  With his samurai trilogy Yamada Yoji combined Fujisawa's source material with potent and powerful acting and directing, and set the standard for all others to follow. Hirayama just isn't the genius that Yamada was.  But it seems strange to fault someone for not being a genius.  Being very good is good enough.

A few notes on the DVD: Animeigo still does the best subtitles in the business.  I know there will never be issues there.  The DVD for Sword of Desperation is bare bones, with only a few trailers and some production notes.  But still, a nice release.",1343174400,9,5509,5.914357682619648
4988435,4,B006H3KQSK,"This movie contains all the elements you look for in a samurai movie. It has the heroically but tragically motivated hero with all the strange loyalty that happens in most other Japanese movies. It also has great scenery and costumes (artistically framed and filmed) AND the slicing and dicing you expect. It's like a John Wayne movie. If you like this genre, you will enjoy the movie thoroughly. Watch it! There will be no regrets.",1341273600,,432,4.773333333333333
4988436,1,B006H3KQSK,"I have never seen any action movie where the major action is the protagonist staring blankly ahead seemingly pondering an inscrutable concept for most of his film time. Never have seen such a boring and downer of a samurai/bushido movie, made more despondent by a Hollywood Strings violin music romantically playing mostly throughout. Violins and flutes, played the American way really seemed odd.

There are no thrills here. No adventure, just a Japanese rendition of the adage 'good guys finish last'. This is not an example of Bushido behavior or or beliefs. Rather, it's a turgid tragedy of a historical drama which is waylaid into a display of manic depression, misplaced loyalties, tragic character flaws, which all triumph.

And the desperation is only in the mind of the viewer.
This viewer wanted nothing more than it be over asap.

I am a film collector. I have 160  fine Japanese films (most all bought from Amazon) which I see and re-see often; I've come to really understand and appreciate the intense, strict samurai code heroes and their triumphs over evil.

I also have library shelves with just under 50 tomes by great Japanese writers and scholarly interpretations of their extraordinary culture. Yes, I've
visited Japan.

This is a movie of a sick, evil woman, a psychotic Lord and no justice, no honor, only dark, dismal, sad distortions of a classic, fine system of honor and right behavior. I often disagree with other reviewers; in this case I'm radically far away from five-star reviews. This is the only Japanese movie I've viewed that, start to finish, really appalls me.

I can't fathom the awards which have been touted on the DVD, the statements made in the very misleading description cited in Amazon Editorial Reviews. I can't comment on other reviews.

For me the only desperation was that, a ways into the film, it still dragged on. I'm an Amazon Vine reviewer. I take reviewing seriously. I'll re-visit this product page; if
enough comments question my taste here I'll respond with a list of Japanese films which are radically above this morbid soap opera. I'm really upset that this film has been so mis-represented.
