1988399,5,B0001CNRNO,"Try to find the original DVD releases of these films and you'll feel your wallet scream in agony.  Even on eBay the single DVD's sell for $15-$25 plus whatever shipping the seller wants.  Now, Universal has re-released their classic monsters again on a wonderful collection that includes 13 films including House of Dracula, which was previously unreleased (on DVD anyway).  At $55.99, that's only $4.30 per movie!  Plus Amazon offers free shipping!  Anyone who loves these classic films should jump at this opportunity.
The only downside is the focus on 3 of the classic monster pantheon.  Sadly missing are the Creature from the Black Lagoon and Mummy films, but I really can't complain.  Maybe the strong sales for this collection will spur another collection soon.
Just watch these great films.  There was something magical about these movies from the 30's (and early 40's in Wolfie's case).  The sets were detailed and lush.  The actors had a certain dynamic, over-acted life to them.  The monsters were foreboding and dangerous.  The fear was conveyed without gore.  Their motives dealt more with evil and our own repressed natures.
Each monster has his own 2 disk set featuring a total of ""13 films""  although I count 14.  It's possible they are counting the english and spanish versions of Dracula as one film even though they are different.  Many actually consider the spanish version superior to the english version.  The set includes documentaries, commentaries, and musical tracks.
The set was released today (April 27, 2004) but Universal, unfortunately, did not meet production expectations, so if you have ordered the set, there MAY be a delay getting your copies.  Even so, get your name on the list... order this amazing collection... and get ready for the ultimate marathon this Halloween!",1083024000,6,1807,5.08843537414966
1988400,2,B0001CNRNO,"Being one of the original ""Monster Kids"", I have been eager for this set. So eager in fact that I bought it @ a ""brick and mortar"" establishment so I wouldn't have to wait. Here's the bad news. I bought the set, opened it and found one of the discs unattached to its spindle and scratched. I returned it to the store and swapped it out. More bad news. The second set had TWO loose discs (also scratched). I opened the third set in the store and found that it was MISSING one of the discs! I decided to give it one last shot, so customer service allowed me to open a fourth set. You guessed it: two more loose and scratched discs! Universal apparently has some serious quality control issues. I gave this set two stars only becasue of the concept of the packaging w/ the little busts. I really hated walking out of that store empty handed.",1083024000,11,838,4.276729559748428
1988401,5,B0001CNRNO,"I've been waiting for these movies to be on DVD again for a long time!  I wanted to buy the out-of-print ones on ebay, but the prices kept me away.  I'm a big fan of James Whale's direction and of Karloff and Lugosi so these are a dream come true!  5 'Frankenstein' movies for the price of what one used to cost, plus all the bonus stuff that was included!  The same for the 'Dracula' and 'Wolf Man' collections, although 'Wolf Man' has only 4 movies, but I'll forgive them for it.  Plus, I love the little busts that Sideshow Toys made perfectly to go with them in this gift set!  Get 'em while you can!
Hey, universal!  How about re-releasing 'The Invisible Man', 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' and 'The Mummy'?  I'd love to see a legacy collection of them, too!
(...)Now that I got my set (...), I think it's truly great (...)!  There are just a few things I miss from the first release, in which I have only a few of.  Like the animated menus, the closed-captioning on the bonus features (I thought that was a good touch), and the ease of removing the discs (and of knowing which disc has what on it.  You gotta read the back of the inner box, not the outer sleeve to know for sure).  Still, to have this many of the original Universal monster movies is a treat to the fans everywhere!  I can't wait to see Hugh Jackman in ""Van Helsing""!",1079481600,,1343,4.260869565217392
1988402,5,B0001CNRNO,"While I did buy a few of the Monster DVDs when they first came out, I didn't buy any of the double features because I didn't feel like playing $30 for two films and no frills. But now the price is right.
For those of you concerned about putting this many movies on six DVDs, don't get too worried because a majority of these films are barely an hour long. Frankenstein was only 71 minutes - Bride 75 min - Dracula 75 min Dracula's Daughter 71 min - Wolfman 70 min so it's not too much of a squeeze.
It would be nice if Universal puts out a 2 disc set of The Mummy and another of their other classic monster movies along with the Abbott and Costello. Clear out the vaults by Halloween!",1077062400,19,684,4.111940298507463

Apparently the discs in this collection will be ""flippers"", therefore five movies and extras would be spread over four sides, not two, so compression should not be a problem. Certainly looking forward to this!",1075161600,6,332,4.741379310344827
1988444,5,B0001CNRNO,"I wanted the sets of Frankenstein, Wolf Man, and Dracula but realized buying this set would be a dollar more plus a few cool busts. I read most of the negative reviews and it took me awhile to make up my mind. I finally got the set for a fair price. Very nice set but the picture quality leaves alot to be desired. I have not viewed all the movies yet but I can see no problems with this set. It said somewhere that this would contain a bonus dvd of four other films but it did not come with my set, nor did it say so on the box. Overall, its well worth the money for this set but if you don't care about the busts, then buy separately.",1224028800,,636,3.9

Didn't think so.  Universal changed the horror genre forever when they began releasing their now-classic line of monster movies.  There is no more influential era in horror cinema.  Bela Lugosi as Dracula, Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster, and Lon Chaney Jr. as Larry Talbot, the ill-fated Wolfman, are simply the three most iconic performances of the genre.  Who can even attempt to estimate the number of movies and stories that have been inspired by the films in this boxed set?  This is classic horror cinema heaven on earth and if it's been a while since you've seen some of the flawless classics or their lesser known spinoffs and sequels then now is the time to mop them up because they aren't as good as you remember; in this era of crummy remakes and tired franchises they are better than ever!

The original ""Frankenstein"" is a film that veers wildly from the unequaled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/0743487583/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel</a>&nbsp;it was based on, but manages to find a life all it's own completely apart from it's otherwise superior parent.  This is largely in part to Boris Karloff's unforgettable zero-lines performance and an outstanding screenplay that expands the story in directions the novel didn't explore.  Many actually prefer the sequel ""Bride of Frankenstein"" where the monster learns rudimentary speech and some humor was added to lighten the tone some.  But that still doesn't stop the amazing climax from being disturbing and moving at the same time. ""Son of Frankenstein"" and ""Ghost of Frankenstein"" introduced Bela Lugosi's Ygor to the mix.  The character's name is typically misspelled as ""Igor"" and applied to the hunchbacked assistant, Fritz, from the original film.  How this happened is one of the true WTF's of cinema history.  The unkindest cut of all is that people have forgotten what a great and creepy character Ygor was as a result of this stupidity. ""House of Frankenstein"" brought in Larry Talbot and added Dracula (now played by John Carradine) to the mix, upping the ante for future horror crossovers.

""The Wolfman"" is another unforgettable film that featured one of the most memorable mantras in all horror cinema.

""Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night, may become a wolf when the wolfbane blooms and the autumn moon is bright.""

""Werewolf of London"" actually preceded it by many years and is arguably just as good, but ""The Wolfman"" remains the standard of the werewolf genre by which all others are measured. ""Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman"" is I believe, the first ever horror crossover film and remains a classic for good reason.  The climax always has been a disappointment to me, but it's still a landmark film.  ""The She-Wolf of London"" is more of a classic whodunnit than a horror film and is rather forgettable, but still worth a peek.

""Dracula"" is my favorite horror film of the time and one of my top 5 ever.  I could fill this review with nothing but praise for it.  It's got genuine chills, memorable lines at all stops, creepy sets, some solid laughs, and is more faithful to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/0743477367/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel</a>&nbsp;(which is the source of almost all vampire literature and media) then it gets credit for.  Lugosi may have been jealous of Karloff's success with ""Frankenstein"", but in my book there is no greater performance in horror then his as the undead Count.  Dwight Frye is as unnerving as he is amusing playing the lunatic Renfield, and Helen Chandler's performance as Mina Murray in the scene where she sits outside with Jonathan Harker still freaks me the hell out.  So underrated, that scene is.  The Spanish version adds much to the cinematography and story, but lacks the iconic performances.  ""Dracula's Daughter"" is an interesting sequel to the original that picks up where that one left off with Abraham Van Helsing standing accused of Dracula's murder.  He is saved when the title character steals her father's body.  This film introduced the vampire maiden of perpetual sorrow (and arguably the lesbian vampire) archetype into cinema.  ""Son of Dracula"" featured Lon Chaney Jr. as Alucard, either the son of the Count or Dracula himself using an anagram a'la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carmilla/dp/0809510839/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carmilla</a>&nbsp;to mask his true name depending on your interpretation.  Unlike most of Universal's horror films, this one took place in modern America.  Great film.  ""House of Dracula"" was another Drac/Wolf/Frank crossover extravaganza.  Pretty good.

If you aren't familiar with these films, buy this set.  If you are familiar with these films then I don't have to tell you ""buy this set"", but I will anyways. There are lots of great featurettes, many of which are sadly used to pimp Stephen Sommers' silly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Van-Helsing/dp/B0002KVUKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Van Helsing</a>&nbsp;-which was an homage to these three iconic monsters but didn't do much of a job of interpreting them- but are all still worth a look.  There are also very informative commentaries by film historians on a few of the flicks.  And the busts are a must.  Can't believe I just wrote that.  Sorry.  The Universal goodness doesn't stop here, either.

1988446,1,B0001CNRNO,"I'm sure the movies in this set are excellent.  However, when I received the set, the discs in both the ""Frankenstein"" and the ""Dracula"" cases were loose and all scuffed up.  So I was not able to watch several of the movies because my DVD player kept freezing up.  I ordered a replacement set through Amazon and guess what?!?!?!  SAME THING!  The ""Frankenstein"" and the ""Dracula"" set had loose, scuffed discs in them.  Unfortunately, Amazon would not send me a third replacement.  They need to check with Universal about the packaging.  Funny that they are still available here...  BUYER BEWARE!",1199491200,,595,4.87

1988449,4,B0001CNRNO,"None of the ""horror stories"" (pardon the pun) regarding DVD's damaged in shipping occurred with my purchase. My DVD's arrived in pristine shape, no scratches, no screen freezes. I think, judging by packaging descriptions in previous posts, Universal has improved on the package methods since the original release.  For the price (down to $39.00 as of this posting), you can't go wrong.  Purists will find things to pick about (yes the groan in Dracula's death scene is missing - but it wasn't in the original movie to begin with folks!)but to get all the Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolfman originals, plus the sequels, the extra movies and documentaries for this price -  you really can't complain.

1988450,5,B0001CNRNO,"I bought this set long ago and I'm surprised to see it still available. This collection features all the Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolfman films on three 2 disc collections. The DVD sets are loaded with extras and contain a total of 15 classic films(if you include  the 3 versions of Dracula). If you are not familiar with all these films, it will make more sense to watch them in the order of release, as many of the films crossover. As an added bonus you get the three monster bust in a neat package. The bust are very well detailed and will go nice next to your horror DVD's. Look for The Creature of the Black Lagoon, The Invisible Man, and The Mummy in similar sets to complete your collection of Universal Monsters. The transfers look very good dispite some very small problems. Treat yourself to a great Halloween gift to enjoy for years to come.",1190764800,,853,4.503225806451613
1988451,5,B0001CNRNO,"This is a great set to get which contains most of Universal studios greatest horror films. The best of which are: Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. The DVDs are very well packaged and the films are split into four areas:

Son of Dracula (1943)

House of Dracula (1945)

FRANKENSTEIN

Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954)

The Invisible Man (1933)

The Phantom of the Opera (1943)

The Mummy (1932)

There are a few of these films that are really terrible.

Noteably She Wolf of London and Werewolf of London. These two are exceptionally bad! However the vast majority are very entertaining and in quite a few cases they are essential classics for any film collection. The quality of the films was fine in my set, but my review is for the British version of the set which also has the extra films mentioned by a previous reviewer.

There are many many extras including documentaries and audio commentaries that make this set worth getting. The busts of Dracula, Frankenstein and The Wolf Man are very well made and the whole set looks excellent on the mantlepiece.

I have watched every film in the set now and can't recommend this strongly enough.",1181088000,2,1547,4.9921259842519685
1988452,5,B0001CNRNO,"I am a big fan of the classic monsters and monster movies. Interestingly, I am so without having seen any of them, practically! I mainly know them from later movies, from comic books, and from books. (I read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, for instance.)

So I jumped at the chance when I found out of a great opportunity to get a whole bunch of the most classic monster movies at once on DVD, and even at a excellent price. It has  three or four Frankenstein movies, and the same for Dracula and Wolf Man. It also has small busts of those three gentlemen, in surprisingly fine quality.  This is the MONSTER LEGACY COLLECTION.

If you can get it, I recommend the UK edition, which has four extra films, The Mummy, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Phantom of the Opera, and The Invisible Man. It is not quite as easy to find, but I found it at Blah DVD.

I don't know why I, like many people, have such an affinity for monsters. They just be weally weally cool.

What is a monster? Is it an evil creature or person? Is it a deformed creature/person? Is it something inhuman? I am not sure what the basic of it is. But at least this collection is a good start to any research. :)",1134777600,7,1173,4.3090909090909095
1988453,5,B0001CNRNO,"I bought this collection when it came out and found no problem with the discs. It was shipped by Amazon and came rapped and boxed in perfect condition.

All in all I find it a great collection (I wish Universal could have done the same thing with The Creature, Mummy and Invisible Man collections).",1124928000,4,380,4.366197183098592
1988473,5,B0001CNRNO,"If you grew up any time between the 50s and 70s, chances are you've seen each and every one of these movies on TV. If you were lucky, one of your local TV stations even had a weekly horror movie show - complete with a wacky host to introduce the films.

Well, those days are gone. Monsters have been replaced by hatchet-wielding maniacs in hockey masks, and your wacky horror movie host has been replaced by cable, infomercials and whatever else has prompted TV stations to give up on creating any sort of interesting local programming. It's a shame that you rarely see the classic Universal horror movies on TV any more...but it's also what makes The Monster Legacy Collection such a Godsend.

This set is, very simply, a must for anyone who grew up loving old black & white horror flicks. Over the course of six discs, The Monster Legacy Collection gives you very nearly all the films featuring Universal's 'Big Three' Monsters: Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man. (The one omission being ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,"" but this set is about the monsters - not A&C - so no quibbles from me.)

Of course, in this set you get all the original films in which the monsters appeared. With the likely exception of ""Bride of Frankenstein"" - a rare case of a sequel besting an original - critics would consider these the highwater marks of the lot. For my money, though, including all the films in the series is what makes The Monster Legacy Collection so worthwhile. So what if ""Dracula"" is actually a better film than, say, ""House of Frankenstein?"" Film historians may turn up their noses a bit at the latter, but it's actually more fun to watch because, well, it has more monsters! Through the six discs included in this collection, we see how Universal turned its monsters - the main characters in its great, classic films of the 30s - into fodder for kiddie matinees in the 40s. More importantly, we see just how well the later films have held up. They may lack the subtlety and art of the earlier films, but damn if they aren't great popcorn entertainment! As big studio exploitation flicks, they stand as classics in their own right. Hats off to Universal for including every one of them in this set.

And, just in case all the films for the three Top Monsters wasn't enough, this collection also includes a couple of flicks that are related by studio and theme even if they weren't part of these series. Both ""Werewolf of London"" and ""She Wolf of London"" are included in the 'Wolf Man' set. Add various documentaries, previews, commentaries and other extras, and you have a box set that's sure to please the Classic Horror fan or introduce the unfamiliar to these films in grand style.

It was dislogged from it's incasement and was just brutally scratched. Looked like someone took the DVD and just put it on their shoes and skipped around all day. I wasn't sure if I should have ruturned the whole set because that was the only one. But why can't they just get it right and make those DVD's secure for transportation?

I have not yet read a review that mentions a specific disc or movie that freezes - mine is Spanish Dracula at around 17:15 to 17:25 into the movie. This happens on three different players from three different manufacturers (though the Pioneer recovers gracefully and plays on). My box arrived in good condition without any loose discs as Amazon's packaging is above average for this type of item. It sounds like bad encoding at the source and I hope the next sets are not problematic. I'm grateful for DVD technology bringing so many classics into my home without breaking the bank and even enjoy the old silent horror movies and serials as well.,1091059200,11,724,4.6640625
1988478,2,B0001CNRNO,"Somewhere down the list one reviewer said everyone giving this set a bad rating was merely whining.  Angry would probably be more accurate.  I exchanged sets three times before finally finding one that contained discs that were all playable (though even that set had three loose discs).  Your best bet is to pick this up in a store so you can shake the box and listen for loose discs before purchasing---but even this method isn't foolproof: a friend bought a box that didn't rattle only to find that two of the discs were still scratched and another froze on every single DVD player he tried it in (six DVD players, just for the reviewer who said everyone with defective discs actually had defective DVD players).

As for the quality, the films are washed-out and nowhere near as crisp as the original DVD releases.  The busts are cool, but the packaging is done in the funky green tint without reprinting the great original posters in color.  And as everyone has pointed out, Drac's death groan is gone, and that alone should turn away all serious horror buffs.  And you still have to buy Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein to complete your collection (just as I had to buy this set to complete my collection since this is the first time House of Dracula has been released on DVD).

Yes, the price is low, but I would have been willing to pay more to get these classic movies in the the condition they deserve to be in.  What I did was pay 60 bucks for a glorified Van Helsing trailer.

The Mummy, Creature From the Black Lagoon, and The Invisible Man all get their Legacy treatment on Oct. 19.  I hope Universal has learned its lesson and doesn't send out more rush-jobs!",1090281600,28,1677,4.556666666666667

1988480,4,B0001CNRNO,"nicely remastered and nicely priced. of course its all to coincide with the definitely mediocre van helsing, but who cares? take advantage of it.
there are of course the stand out gems, beginning with the 1931 dracula.
the philip glass score is a disservice. one of the problems with dracula has indeed always been its lack of a good score. the film is a bit too minimalistic to begin with but having a minimalist composer (and, sorry, a bad one at that)score this film only compounds the problem. it really needs something more dramatic.
but, you can opt out of the glass score anyway, so...
that said;
dracula is certainly flawed. at times lugosi is brilliant and at times much less so. the first half of the film is undoubtedly the best and its mood and atmosphere are most striking in the transylvania castle.
the spanish dracula, on the whole, is somewhat better.
helen chandler seemed a bit too vampiric even before she was bit.
her mexican counterpart is much better and oozing far more sexuality.
the mood and pacing is better. torches instead of candles. draculas emergence from his casket and the ships travel to london is far more effective.
but this dracula doesnt hold up to lugosi, and at times the spanish dracula seems to be aping lugosis performance and
it too loses some steam once being transplanted to england.
still, dracula started a whole new hollywood genre, which leads us to :
frankenstein and bride of frankenstein.
it really is  apparent that the two whale films stand way apart from the rest. whales films possess an original style and art. even the mob scenes here seem genuine. in the later films the mob scenes seem paled down, weaker copies of what they are here.
karloffs pantomime performance is brilliant in frankenstein, but it is in bride that he surpasses himself. his monster is touchingly human.
as excellent as karloff is thesiger steals the show and his performance should have at the very least garnered an oscar nomination.
son of frankenstein is the last decent film with the monster. its also karloffs final turn at the character. but, karloff only has one good scene (when he finds the dead ygor). but it is lugosi and atwill who steal the whole movie.
lugosi is brilliant here, smashing the myth that he really couldn't act to smithereens. his ygor is gnarled, pathetic, evil, and charming. he would never top this performance and its a shame the universal execs didn't wake up to lugosis potential after this.
atwill gives a classic performance which was later spooofed by peter sellers in dr strangelove.
the scene when he is explaining his handicap to rathbone and crahes his false arm into the wall is milked for all the campy brilliance it can muster.
rathbone however overacts badly and his performance is at time embarrasing. originally peter lorre was wanted for the role and one can only imagine how much better lorre would have made it.
too, the kid is the worst sort of cutesy hollywood tyke and one keeps hoping the monster will dispose of the brat.
it is in the rest of the sequals that we start getting that sense of paled down copies.
draculas daughter however is a nicely paced sequal to dracula. gloria holden should have developed a following after this, but the film didn't take with a public who didn't want to see it without lugosi.
son of dracula also has a decent pacing,atmosphere, a badly miscast chaney and the quintessential whiny hero that you absolutely hate.
the wolfman was the 40s entry and it is a superbly cast film with chaney earning his place in horrordom.
everbody from claude rains to ouspenskia are excellent. the film has numerous loop holes in logic but none of that matters.
its a lesser classic but still a definite classic.
frankenstein meets the wolfman propels the story into the B category.
its a lot of fun and it moves along at a rapid pace. but lugosi was classically screwed over in this. at the end of ghost ygors brain had been put into the monster and the monster spoke again for the first time since bride (albeit briefly).
in ghost the sound of lugois raspy ygor voice coming out of the monsters lips actually worked and was one of the few interesting things about that movie.
and meets the wolfman was filmed that way, with lugosis blind monster speaking. but someone didn't like it so the voice was muted out and all references to the monsters blindness was eliminated, rendering lugosis performance ridiculous.
it was a cruel case of bad editing.
still, chaneys talbot is really a cool character here and if anything he is even better here than in the previous film.
the two house films are D grade. house of frankenstein at least has karloff and hes damned good. chaneys character is now starting to sound whiney but j carrol naish and john carradine are nice mixes to the brew and the scene were chaney gets put out with a silver bullit is classic.
werewolf of london is pre wolfman and stars henry hull. its mood is more subtle than the chaney one but its a very good film with more a sense of mythos and folklore than the wolfman.
the dog of the collection is she wolf of london (with house of dracula being a close second to the bottom) with the less said about it the better.
now if universal would put out a second collection with the black cat, the raven, black friday, the invisible ray, the invisisble man, the mummy and creature films then it would be a great round off. but then, unless van helsing returns to fight all these other characters, don't expect it to happen",1089158400,4,5490,4.653964984552008

The second box I tried didn't make a sound so I figured all of the discs were in their holders and that's the one I bought and so far no problems. But I'm afraid Universal goofed in mastering Dracula. If you watch the movie with the commentary track the person notes that the previously censored groans when Dracula gets a stake through his heart have been restored and you can hear them in the commentary track. However, if you watch the movie without the commentary you have a very noisy soundtrack and the death groans are still absent! I read another review for the previous single Dracula DVD and they said the soundtrack was correct and the image was better too. Bevare! Bevare!",1088640000,9,838,4.412903225806452

 Frankenstein's monster, The Wolf Man and Dracula are as much like old friends to me as Superman and Batman were to a lot of young boys back in the days before gangsta rap and Britney.
 But I say again: WHERE IS THE MUMMY? The Mummy series are my favorite of the Universals. Even most of the sequels for The Mummy are stunningly good.
 Even those who are more fond of some of the other monsters would not deny that The Mummy warrants this kind of nice DVD treatment too, right?

1988509,5,B0001CNRNO,"I bought the gift set and, like others, ran into a problem with it. However, in my case, I didn't have any scratched disks, and the only problem was on disk 2 of the Dracula set. Specifically, Son of Dracula crashed about 53 minutes into the movie. It also crashed on attempting access to Spanish Dracula.
Rather than substitute the Dracula set Amazon would only resend the entire set, but did so quickly. The replacement Dracula disk 2 was flawless, but ironically there was a similar problem with the new Dracula disk 1. So I ended up swapping out my disk 2 while keeping disk 1. If you elect to go this route, take a little time and save yourself more aggravation by scanning each disk, chapter by chapter, to make sure each chapter is accessible.
Yes, it was a hassle to go through each disk chapter by chapter to ensure that all the disks played properly, but considering the value price and the bonus collector busts, it is a small price to pay indeed. I agree with those who say Universal went on the cheap, but the complete error-free set itself is great and well worth $60.
If you can deal with the minor hassle, buy it from Amazon and save yourself some money.",1087344000,6,1170,4.446511627906977
1988510,5,B0001CNRNO,"Firstly, I know these movies but can't comment on the quality of the discs that are being shipped. The other reviews express enough dissatisfaction with the packaging etc. that I would certainly be leary. But-about the movies:
These are (of course) B&W and relatively low tech by todays standards. Frankenstein is THE CLASSIC, and Karloff (The Monster) and Colin Clive (The Doctor) deliver fine performances, the makeup for the monster is great, and the outdated style of acting actually adds to the effect. A great movie.
""Dracula"" is the beginning of Universal horror in the talkie age, but is also rightly recognized as the beginning of GOTHIC horror in the sound age. Bela Lugosi was a stage actor with poor grasp of the English Language, and the voice and look were so perfect almost no makeup was needed. This movie is downright creepy. No one had the voice down this well, and only Christopher Lee looked as good as Dracula (if even HE did). The new guy in ""Van Helsing"" is a good choice though, I must admit. This is not as graphic as ""Frankenstein"", but a very unique movie (although I suggest the German movie ""vampyre"" from the same year).
""The Wolf Man"" is a LITTLE more modern. Lon Chaney,jr. is the leading character, and he does a good job. His acting is not so dramatic as that of Lugosi, Karloff, or Clive, but in it's way is actually more human. Maybe even points the way to Marlin Brando, james Dean-in a way, maybe even Johnny Depp. This movie has a great script, introduces the top Werewolf of all time (he gets his ass kicked by the Frankenstein Monster in the sequel, but takes Dracula down a few films down the road)(and again in the novel ""Return of the Wolfman""), and draws us in to the world of the monster a bit more than the other two. Things are too slick today, they can't recapture the feel of those old days, but this where it all starts. ""Van Helsing"" basically comes after ""Frankenstein"", even though it was released in 2004. Buythese if you like the monsters, the stories, the feel, and great make-up, but aren't too hot on modern FX.",1086998400,,2070,4.5822102425876015

I read the reviews, but still didn't listen to what customers were saying about the condition of the dvds. The best bet would be to purchase the dvds at a retail store like Best Buy. You'll pay more money, but it's worth it to receive the dvds in great condition. This is what I did and the dvds were in perfect condition, no scratches or other visible damage.

1988513,1,B0001CNRNO,"I have read the numerous warnings about the discs in this set being scratched due to poor packaging. I orginally purchased the box set at a local retailer. I opened the set, and 4 discs were scratched badly. I then returned the set to the retailer. We then went thru the 4 remaining box sets on the shelf. Each set contained at least 2 scratched discs. The retailer ended up giving me a full refund. I thought I would take my chances with Amazon since I have had always had great service from them. When I received the set, I cringed as I could hear loose discs in the box once again. I opened the set, and once again 3 scratched discs. I notified Amazon, and they responded very quickly with how I could return the set with no charge to me. This is not a problem with Amazon, but a problem with Universal. It is a big hassle to return things in the mail. I have e-mailed Universal regarding this problem. All I received was a generic response saying they were sorry for the inconvenience, and that I should hear back from someone shortly. It has been 2 weeks, and I still have not heard back from Universal. Amazon has been great with this situation, but Universal has dropped the ball in a major way. The only reason I will continue to try and get a set that is unscratched is because this is an incredible collection. How could you pass up on these classic movies for this price? If it takes me months, I WILL get a set that is not scratched. Universal, you owe every single one us that just wants to purchase this set. Don't take the customer for granted. I'm going to keep my fingers crossed that I get an unscratched set soon. All I want is to have this set the way it should be, unscratched and for them to be viewable.

1988535,5,B0001CNRNO,"The Monster Legacy Collection pretty much speaks for itself.  You get 14 Universal monster films, true classics alongside some of the more hard-to-find films, trailers for almost every film, special documentaries on each monster represented here, fascinating commentaries by film historians of the original classics, short features with Van Helsing director Stephen Sommers explaining the influence of the classics on his film Van Helsing (blatantly promotional material I care little about, but the sad fact is that it took the release of the film Van Helsing to convince the powers-that-be to release this long-overdue monster superset), and super-nifty hand painted busts of Bela Lugosi's Dracula, Boris Karloff's Frankenstein's monster, and Lon Chaney, Jr.'s The Wolf Man.  It all comes in this fancy box that makes for a great display piece for your newly-acquired treasures.
You get five films in the Dracula set: the original Dracula (1931) starring Bela Lugosi (with commentary by film historian David J. Skal), which you can watch with both the original soundtrack as well as Philip Glass' modern score performed by the Kronos Quartet; the Spanish version of Dracula, filmed on the Dracula set at night after the American moviemakers went home - a much longer and technically superior version of the film (Carlos Villarias, however, cannot hold a candle to Bela Lugosi in the title role); Dracula's Daughter (1936) starring Gloria Holden as Dracula's daughter, a woman desperately seeking help to remove the vampire curse that afflicts her; Son of Dracula (1943) starring none other than Lon Chaney, Jr., as ""Count Alucard"" (an incredibly boring vampire film, if you ask me), and House of Dracula (1945).  The final film, a sequel of sorts to House of Frankenstein, features Dracula (John Carradine), Frankenstein's Monster (Glenn Strange) and Larry Talbot aka The Wolf Man (Lon Chaney, Jr.).  I thought Lon Chaney, Jr., was bad as the vampire in Son of Dracula, but John Carradine proved himself to be the worst Dracula of all time.  The set is capped off by the documentary The Road to Dracula.
The Frankenstein set features five films: the original Frankenstein (1931), Bride of Frankenstein (1935), Son of Frankenstein (1939), Ghost of Frankenstein (1942), and House of Frankenstein (1944).  The first two films, directed by James Whale, are truly the two best horror films of that era and probably of all time.  Scene after scene is etched into our collective unconscious, from Dr. Frankenstein's (Colin Clive) mad jubilation at the ""birth"" of his monster to the views of the marauding villagers to the final stand at the windmill.  No one will ever forget Elsa Lanchester's brief but iconic portrayal of the Bride of Frankenstein's monster, and her portrayal of Mary Shelley in the film's prologue is almost just as memorable.  Bride of Frankenstein is as close to perfection as horror movie making has ever come.  Son of Frankenstein features Boris Karloff's last performance as the monster, while both this film and Ghost of Frankenstein feature Bela Lugosi in the memorable role of Ygor.  House of Frankenstein boasts all three of the Universal monster heavyweights: Frankenstein's monster (now played by Glenn Strange), the Wolf Man (Lon Chaney, Jr.), and Count Dracula (played by John Carradine - the world's worst Dracula). It also features Boris Karloff in the role of the mad scientist who causes all sorts of trouble. A sequel of sorts to Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein is a major disappointment in my eyes; only the Wolf Man character gets a decent treatment in this fun but rather insignificant film.  The collection is rounded out by two documentaries, a weird short film, and amazingly informative commentaries for the first two films.
The Wolf Man collection is the most eclectic of the three, featuring just four movies, only two of which actually feature Lon Chaney, Jr.s ""the Wolf Man.""  The Wolf Man is, in my opinion, the most sympathetic of the Universal monsters, and Chaney was brilliant in the role of Larry Talbot.  The Wolf Man dates back to 1941, followed up two years later by Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man - this film was first and foremost a sequel to The Wolf Man, and it has the distinction of featuring Bela Lugosi as Frankenstein's Monster.  Chaney also played his trademark character in House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula - these two films (significant only for The Wolf Man's search for release) can be found on the Dracula and Frankenstein subsets of this mega-collection.  The Wolf Man set is rounded out with the documentary Monster by Moonlight; Werewolf of London (1935), Universal's first werewolf film; and She-Wolf of London (1946), a film I really enjoyed, although it differs greatly from the other films of its kind.
The three hand painted busts are quite impressive, and they are basically just thrown in to the deal for free; any way you look at it, The Monster Legacy collection is a bargain and a half.  I know some have encountered technical difficulties with the disks and problem with the packaging itself, and I must admit that each of my cases featured horrid little bumps of plastic seemingly made to scratch each of the DVDs themselves, but all of my DVDs played flawlessly.  The only bad feelings I have about this collection have to do with the fact that it should have been put together and released to all of us Universal monster fans well before now.",1086480000,16,5461,5.028792912513842

Each DVD is loaded with bonus features (some more than others) and even the weaker films are worth viewing at least once. It's very cool to finally have the Spanish version of ""Dracula"" on DVD as well as such guilty pleasures as ""Frankenstein Vs. The Wolfman"" and others. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney Jr., Dwight Frye, Claude Rains, John Carradine-you can do no wrong here. One of the coolest things about this set is the mini busts from Sideshow Toys.

1988538,5,B0001CNRNO,"It was pretty hard to decide between 4 and 5 stars.  In reality, I should have given the set 4 stars because there are still a few features missing from making it perfect (theatrical poster minitures, stock interviews with the Karloff, Lugosi, etc., and the Wolfman disc is lacking in bonus features) BUT the fact that this was offered to us for such an awesome price allows me to give it an edge.
It should be said that my set was ordered from amazon with NO complications (well, the plastic was a tad scratched but the discs were in pristine condition...also my Frank statue was loose but it was fine otherwise).  I have heard many legit complaints from people I trust that their discs were loose, but that was not the case with me.  Must have been a problem with one batch of them.
I haven't been able to watch all of the features but how can one complain?  We are given 4 movies with documentaries to accompany them as well as commentaries and other bonus materials, plus 10 other feature films for a NICE price.
Make sure you get this set rather than buying them individually.  The packaging is a nice edition to anybodies collection.
The reviews thus far have been nothing but positive (with the exception of a few peoples problems with the discs) and I'm sure Universal is making a killing.  I just pray that they have the sense to release a second set with the Invisible Man, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and the Mummy (or maybe even the Phantom and the Hunchback...then again, that could be a set on its own.)
Sideshow Toys never dissapoint with their respect to the detail of these monsters.  I own the entire 8"" action figure collection (my favorite) and the busts are a nice edition.  Basically this collection is well rounded and will provide days of entertainment going through all the bonus features.
p.s. Say what you will about Van Helsing (the new movie) but I love hearing Stephen Sommers talk about the inspiration he found in these classic movies.  You can tell he is a huge fan at heart.",1085788800,2,2012,4.551246537396122

Chilly would show a double feature and have a few comic skits too. These 14 films (except for the Spanish Dracula) were shown a lot by Chilly and they sure brought back a lot of happy memories for me!
I don't know why anyone is complaining about the packaging, my set arrived in perfect condition, no problems with any of the disks and the Sideshow team has once again delivered with beautiful busts of the Horror Grandmasters themselves!
As for the DVD's they all play perfect on my DVD players and my Mac, I don't have any sound problem with them. The real find is the Spanish Dracula, which I watched for the first time last night. It is truly fantastic to see. It makes me wonder if there was a Spanish version of Frankenstein in the Universal vaults!
Yes, I wish the Mummy, Invisible Man and Creature from the Black Lagoon were in this set, but I'm hoping that Universal will put them in Set #2. I wonder how SIdeshow will portray the Invisible Man?????
I hope Universal keeps releasing it's gems, and that goes especially for Boris Karloff's TV series ""Thriller""! Only 6 of the episodes were released to laserdisc or VHS, and that's a shame, because most of them are just as spine tingling as the Twilight Zone, Outer Limits and One Step Beyond!

However, one of the movies on my Frankenstein DVD freezes up during the middle of the film (Ghost of Frankenstein), then skips about 5 minutes of the film to the next chapter.

But for all of you who want to replace defective discs, Universal Studios will replace any defective discs you have. I went to their site, e-mailed them about the problem in the ""Contact Us"" section, and they said I just have to send them only the affected disc and some additional shipping information and they'll replace it within six weeks. Sounds like a deal to me!

1988587,5,B0001CNRNO,"Well, first off I just wanted to say that I love any of these old movies from Universal, but anyway. The Monster Legacy Collection, I think was a really great Idea, Yet now we get to the packaging. When I recieved my ""Box"" i thought oh wow this is going to be fun to open but when i opened it, i thought i heard a loose disc. And it was a loose disc yet from one my favorites, ""Dracula"" I was pretty pissed off but any way Buy This Collection it does pay off these movies are great and this is a great colection to own",1084579200,3,518,3.8962264150943398
1988588,4,B0001CNRNO,"I love the concept here...""all in one""...it has everything (and more) that I would want in terms of the films.  I am dissapointed by some of the sound and picture quality issues mentioned by others, and confirmed during my viewing.  Frankenstien has some shots that are totally ""out of focus""  due to extreme compression during non-moving shots, dracula's sound is poor, etc.  when universal asks the public to lay out big money for a special edition set they could at least make sure the transfer is optimal.  I would have rather cheap cases and no figurines than an overly compressed or poorly transfered dvd!",1084492800,7,611,4.836538461538462
1988589,4,B0001CNRNO,"This set is great, terrible packaging not withstanding. But, I wish all the films, or at least more of the films, had commentaries. I have the original 8 film collection, and the commentaries are excellent on all of them, and really put that set a rung above this one.
However, it is great to have all these films together in one package, even if some of them are not are not totally restored. There is also a scene missing in Werewolf of London, in which the main character claws the face of the other main character, Dr. Yogami. This was close up, and very extreme for it's time. Check out the trailer, the scene is in that, but not in the film. All of the films are pretty good transfers, with defects only a hardcore dvd critic would notice or care about.
Although I gave this a four star rating, I was a little disapointed that Universal didn't really do this set right, and those Van Helsing Commercials are horrible. Overall, it is worth the money
Lets see the Creature and Invisible man films next Universal, and do it right next time.",1084406400,3,1043,4.4375
1988590,4,B0001CNRNO,"I'm just confirming what others have said about Dracula. The Legacy Collection film uses a different audio track than the ""out of print"" Classic Monsters DVD release. The audio on the previous edition is much cleaner and does have Dracula's death groans. The audio on the Legacy Collection is very poor to these ears. I'm keeping my old DVD. It's the one I'll be playing when I want to watch Dracula.
  Other than that, the Legacy set is excellent. Love the busts. The audio on ""Frankenstein"" is much improved. The incorrect framing of ""Bride Of Frankenstein"" that marred the previous DVD edition has been corrected and the picture has been clean up significantly. I had none of the quality issues that seem to plague other buyers and heartily recommend this set. In fact even the audio issue on ""Dracula"" only affects those of us who purchased the original DVD. Newbies will be happy that these films are finally back in print and will love them no matter what.",1084406400,,962,4.720238095238095

I have the first edition of DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN, BRIDE and compared it with the new ones. Conclusion: although FRANKENSTEIN is not in pristine condition, the new edition is even better that the old one !!! All classic Horrormoviefans will go for this edition - if not for the main features then for the inclusion of the sequels and a nice addition of three beautiful figurines.",1084233600,5,574,4.808080808080808

But I can say that the disappointing thing of this set is the dvd packaging, damn digipack, one of the Dracula set was loose and got scratched, and this is very bad to me, cause I treat my discs so good. And it's a shame to receive your set already damaged. A double Amaray case would have fitted much better. I give it 5 stars anyway for the content.",1084233600,4,492,3.9797979797979797

""The Bride of Frankensten"" and ""The Wolf Man"" represent the very finest of the Universal classic horror films and atmosphere drips like wax in these tales from the shadows. Lesser-known films, like The Werewolf of London, are icing on the cake. And the busts of Frank, Drac and Wolfman are hefty, quality collectables! This collection is a tremendous value for the film lover and collector.

I'd like to see a follow up set that would include Universal's ""The Invisible Man"", ""The Mummy"" movies and more Karloff and Lugosi films. ""The Creature of the Black Lagoon"" doesn't belong in this expressionist-influenced genre. Nor does 1943 ""The Phantom of the Opera""(no dissin' Claude Reins though). Those two films are the reason I didn't buy the Univeral Classic Monster collection upon first release.

An earlier reviewer mentioned the abrasive spur in the back of the individual dvd holders. Good advice there! I scraped off the sharp plastic immediately, I think it might be the villan in a few quality issues mentioned.

1988636,5,B0001CNRNO,"I've noticed quite a few comments about the quality of these DVDs, mostly complaints.  I feel just the opposite.  This is exactly how I remember these films on Chiller Theater Saturday nights during the 60's.  Sure they are scratchy and hissy, but they are over 70 years old! Thats part of their appeal!  Had they remastered them in a Criterion way, it just wouldn't be the same.  If you were as fascinated by these films as I was as a kid, you're sure to get a kick out of seeing them w/o commercial interuption, or some TV station self promo in the bottom corner of the screen.  I watched Dracula last night and it was wonderful!  Don't miss out on this set!",1083888000,6,660,4.360655737704918
1988637,5,B0001CNRNO,"Absolutely bowled over by the packaging and contents for this set.  Don't quite know how Universal have managed to deliver 14 movies and the other goodies at this price.
Let's hope they do a Volume 2 for The Mummy, Invisible Man and Creature from the Black Lagoon.
And on the subject of Van Helsing, Peter Cushing is the man, without a doubt!",1083888000,5,342,4.516129032258065
1988638,2,B0001CNRNO,"The head busts have a great likeness to the classic monsters and are good items for avid monster movie collectors. However as far as quality DVDs are concerned, this is a step back for Universal. In some cases the picture and audio quality is worse than in the previous editions! Like in Dracula, no picture clean up has been done, and as far as audio is concerned, it hisses and it is noisier than before, and his groans at the end are missing! Why? They were there in the last DVD edition; and in the previous edition a section of music was missing during the opera scene! Couldn't they have gotten it right this time around? Why on the Frankenstein disk do they pause the end credits? That's just strange to me. Compression artifacts are visible on disks with more than one film. The Laserdisc and video versions released in the 1990s had better audio and picture quality (at least no audio was missing from Dracula). This is disappointing because the studio has done nothing to give us superb quality that these classic films DESERVE.",1083628800,61,1038,4.616216216216216
1988639,5,B0001CNRNO,"Where do I start? The box itself is a delight for the eyes, the DVDs are of good quality, the resin-cast busts are sturdy and lifelike, and the movies are classics. This has been one of my better ""deluxe"" type editions that I have purchased, and I will keep it forever and watch all the discs many times over. Being a classic Unversal horror fan, this box was a godsend to me. I received all the materials in tip-top condition (my condolences to the one reviewer who had numerous problem with his item). The slipcases are sturdy and fun to examine. The extras, while available on the first printings of the movies, where nonetheless exciting and informative. I appreciated the inclusion of ""House of Dracula"" and ""House of Frankenstein,"" two of my favorite spin-offs/sequels/""let's keep the franchise going"" efforts. If you are into classic black and white, atmospheric horror films, and you don't mind spending a few bucks, this one is highly recommended. Now, what to do with the first-printing single DVDs? Keep them or sell them off?",1083542400,2,1037,4.831460674157303
1988640,1,B0001CNRNO,"After waiting two months for this item, imagine my disappointment that the Werewolf of London disk was full of pixalations and drop outs! I talked to my brother, who also got a set, & he said his Frankenstein disk wouldn't play. When he examined the disk, and said that it was full of deep scratches and looked like someone used it for a hocky puck.
I read the reviews of others and it appears that Universal really goofed on this one. They also cut corners by making double sided disks, which are prone to damage.
Amazon has promised to replace my set--but geez, how many sets do I have to sit and watch to find the bad disks? Quality control isn't my job. Universal has created an inferior product all dressed up in a fancy package. They should have saved some money on the slick packaging and painted busts and made a product wasn't defective and that you could actually watch all the way through.
 Buyer beware. It took all the fun out of it for me!",1083456000,21,953,4.3841807909604515
1988641,5,B0001CNRNO,"Even if, like myself, you purchased the original Universal Monster discs a few years ago, you still need to get this set.  Mainly, of course, because it is the first time HOUSE OF DRACULA has been released on DVD.  But beyond that, the package itself is a great way to condense so much material into only 6 discs.  And the Sideshow busts have to be seen to be fully appreciated.  Like the other licensed Universal products the company offers, the attention to detail in these polystone treasures is remarkable.
If I have one minor quibble, it's that the way the films and features are laid out on the discs can be confusing.  No matter which of the 3 sides of a particular collection (Frankenstein, Dracula or Wolfman) you pop in the player, the initial menu offers your choice of any of the 4 or 5 films.  Unless you carefully examine the back of of the box for the contents, you'll find yourself having to put in another disc about 2/3 of the time.  And die-hard Wolfman fans take note: The only thing missing from the set is the trailer for The Wolfman (which was available in the previous single-disc release).  Well, that, and there is still no trailer for Son of Frankenstein.
But these are minor points, when one considers what you are getting for the money.  That's 14 undisputable classics of the Golden Age of horror (well...13, maybe.  She-Wolf of London is, hands-down, the nadir of the studio's output of the period).  You also get a wealth of first-rate documentaries and commentary tracks, some brief but informative interviews with VAN HELSING director Stephen Sommers, and did I mention that no monster fan can live without those lovingly-crafted busts?

So I go on to another feature and although it fares better, it does freeze for awhile.  So far it seems all the DVDs are defective.  One constant is the Macrovision copy protection, or should I say ""play protection"".  One CD was loose in the Wolf Man collection.  Too bad that Universal chose to use Macrovision - as I have only had trouble with Macrovision encoded discs.
As far as the contents go, great.  But where was The Mummy collection?  Nice try Universal, but you need to work on quality control alot.",1083456000,12,663,4.421487603305785

Nice set but the film transfers appear to be the same as the original issues. Everyone knows how good the movies are, so no need to review them.

The cases can be a pain to remove from the sides and the protective foam, but at least this way they won't be loose and harm the discs.

The Busts of the Monsters included in the Giuft Set is worth the price of Admission all by themselves ! Although horror movies today consist of high tech graphics and digital effects, It was very enjoyable to view Horror at its conception. I mean these films gave birth to the horror films of today and it lends a rather nastalgic feeling to experience what started the genre off in the begining, save for Nosferatu !",1294272000,2,1101,5.754601226993865
