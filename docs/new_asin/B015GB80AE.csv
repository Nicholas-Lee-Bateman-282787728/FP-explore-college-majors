7435913,4,B015GB80AE,"While the movie is fantastic, the BluRay is subpar. Nothing of particular note here outside of the actual film. Picture and sound are good. The film is so fantastic it's worth picking up... though perhaps go digital.",1489881600,2,216,4.864864864864865
7435914,3,B015GB80AE,"I'm a little shocked by the all 5 star reviews.  First off I love Sci Fi stuff, but there is just too much wrong with this film to highly recommend it.  You have to accept the premise, which is extremely outlandish.  Then you have to accept the ""resolution"" at the end, which also leaves a bit to be desired.  In the middle is a bunch of stuff that also either gets unresolved/unexplained, or just plain is out of whack.  As a piece of social commentary its an interesting watch and thought provoking if you allow yourself to look beyond some flaws.  I doubt I would rewatch this film due to those flaws.",1488153600,2,604,4.348214285714286
7435915,5,B015GB80AE,"A little odd, but a thoughtful film on the state of society.",1485475200,,60,4.083333333333333
7435916,5,B015GB80AE,"Classic cult movie. Not for everyone - you will either love it or hate. This is a totally unlikely even to ever happen but that is not the point. It is the characters, the story and the message here.  You can say the same about Star Wars, Star Trek or any other way out there SciFi movie.",1484352000,6,288,4.052631578947368

7435919,5,B015GB80AE,"Very interesting Premise.  It might be odd for some, but really enjoyed this movie.  Really takes a couple of watches.  Purchased only to upset the wife, she can't stand it!",1520553600,,173,4.7

7435924,5,B015GB80AE,"Whether or not they like it, at least most of the reviewers ""get"" what this film is about.

Modern conservatives will despise ""Snowpiercer"", seeing it as Liberal film makers' assault on all that America holds good and true. It sure is, and we can't have enough of such films. With Donald Trump and his gang of moral thugs in control -- and the real possibility that once Pence becomes President, the Constitution will be amended to pervert it -- it's important viewing. (Tom Hanks' recent remark that the ""self-correcting"" nature of the Constitution bodes well for the long-term good of this country, shows that he doesn't understand history or human nature.)

Parents are warned that ""Snowpiercer"" is extremely violent, so much so that it could arguably be rated NC-17.",1508630400,4,770,4.961240310077519
7435925,1,B015GB80AE,"Why this movie received such high ratings is beyond me. It was a ridiculous concept and poorly written. The only reason I continued watching was because of the rating, thinking it had to get better. It didn't. Don't waste your time.",1504915200,2,232,4.682926829268292

7435927,5,B015GB80AE,"SNOWPIERCER portrays a future as a dystopian horror show confined within the bowels of a super train. Its story is structured as a terrifying combination of Orwell's vision of a social order and ruled by a mad genius, master technologist as dictator. A cinematic experience composed of equal parts heroic individuals and heartless villains, meticulous set design and costumes, brilliantly fresh casting and unexpected plot twists. Taken together it's a contemporary parable as hallucinatory acid trip.",1496793600,3,501,5.605263157894737
7435928,4,B015GB80AE,Weird post apocalyptic story that drives hard on its own engine of thought.  Intense moments juxtaposed with hilarious scenes. Great cast!,1496361600,,138,5.571428571428571

8733488,1,B015GB80AE,Moronic overrated film.  Premise is so poor I wonder who got convinced to fund the project.  I can only guess that the great cast wasted on this film was there for a paycheck because there was no way in hell for them to save the film.,1523923200,,234,4.065217391304348
