8496054,5,B006BF2F9C,"Excellent box set of the British Paul Temple mystery series. If you like THE SAINT, THE FALCON and such stuff you will applaud your decision to purchase this fine set...4 DVDs, all nice prints, clear with good sound, especially with my failing hearing. And rest assured, these ARE PLAYABLE on your DVD player. I had no trouble with any of them, and picking this set up for next to nothing from an Amazon outlet seller it's perhaps my buy of the year.",1445126400,,450,4.5
