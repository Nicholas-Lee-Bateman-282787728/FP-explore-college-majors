However, after watching it, I'd suggest he keep his day job and forget about acting.  This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen, and then that is an understatement.  It was sheer torture to sit through this DVD.  This was filmed locally, but I would also suggest the film company give it up.  This is, obviously, a low-budget film and not worth the paper the cover is made of.  The bottom line is save your money and your eyesight.  I wish I had.",1236297600,,688,5.2
8150366,4,B000JGWG4S,"Although I don't usually watch anything darker than ""Singing in the Rain"", this movie moved me.  Gary Shannon's portrayal of John Mercy was so realistic that I had to remind myself he was acting. I hope we see more of him in the future.",1180310400,,236,4.363636363636363
8150367,4,B000JGWG4S,Enjoyed this films noirish and somewhat Lynchesque overtones. Love to see quirky little movies like this one. Also thought that some of the young actors showed a lot of untapped talent and promise.,1179273600,,197,5.0
8150368,5,B000JGWG4S,"Patrick Roddy's MERCY is a wonderful example of filmmaking in it's purest form. The beauty of this film is its minimalism. Nothing is wasted. Everything from the choices Mr. Roddy made in lighting to the underlying sound and score of this film play an integral part in the story and viewing experience.

MERCY is the thought-provoking story of John Mercy, a man recently released from prison for a crime that is not immediately apparent. From there, in this viewers opinion, the rest of the story can be left to interpretation. Is it the story of a man who committed a crime, paid his dues to society, but once free still finds himself imprisoned by his past? Or is it a cautionary tale, warning that the only path to freedom is to repent one's sins and ask for forgiveness? Where is God's Country for John Mercy? Watch and decide for yourself.

MERCY is a cinematic indie gem. A must-see for horror and art films fans alike. Patrick Roddy has created a dark, richly textured film. On the surface it seems deceptively simple. The combination of the imagery, that is dark and often disturbing, with the haunting score and use of sound draw the viewer into the world of John Mercy. Gary Shannon's expressive portrayal of John Mercy is perfect. The viewer gets lulled into believing that they are experiencing the day-to-day routines of a man trying to move beyond his past, and then suddenly find themselves side by side with John in a waking nightmare. This film will leave the viewer questioning, thinking, perhaps a bit unsettled, but most assuredly wanting to experience it again.",1163808000,,1582,4.7700729927007295
8150369,3,B000JGWG4S,"First off, this isn't your typical low-budget horror movie. MERCY's ambitious experimentation with sound, imagery, and storytelling give this expressionistic work a depth that is lacking in most films of this genre. Stunningly photographed in rich black and white, MERCY is a psychologically suffocating account of an ex-con looking to make a new start. Unfortunately for John Mercy, his dream of anonymity is plagued by disturbing flashes of his violent past and a predatory world that seems to be lying in wait.",1162166400,,513,5.2682926829268295
