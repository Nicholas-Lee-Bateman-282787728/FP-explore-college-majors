8747733,5,B01ALA0XKK,"I have loved all three of these main comedians since their early days, as well as so many of the talented people from SF at the same time - this film lets us in on their lives in a beautiful way.  No fair saying this stars Robin Williams though - yes, he is in it, but it's not mainly about him, and that does a disservice to the real stars, who deserve top billing here.  Great footage from the old SF venues, such memories!  See it.  You will love it!",1487548800,,453,4.0
8747734,5,B01ALA0XKK,"A thoughtful, funny, and at times heartbreaking look into the 1980's San Francisco Comedy scene and beyond.  The documentary follows three brilliant stand up comics (Durst, Steele & Brown) through their meteoric rise (80's) and their resistance to ""sell out"" to Hollywood. Highly recommended whether you are a comedy fan or not. The documentary will certainly touch you.",1485561600,,370,5.379310344827586
8747735,5,B01ALA0XKK,"This documentary on three comedians from SF is wonderful.  Though it's a bit sad that they haven't 'made it big,' the film shows at least two of them still performing vibrantly to very appreciative audiences.",1476748800,,208,4.942857142857143
8747736,5,B01ALA0XKK,"I love this movie. Brought back memories of the comedy scene in San Francisco in the 80s. Made me laugh , made me cry .",1465862400,,119,3.8
8747737,5,B01ALA0XKK,"Funny, touching, sad, and then funny again, this doc is a terrific and very authentic story of three very funny comics who almost made it big and eventually stuck out the comedy recession and continue to perform to this day.

San Francisco in the '80s was a hotbed of stand up comedy. For every Robin Williams or Dana Carvey or Rob Schneider who broke out and found success on the big and small screen, there was a legion of those that almost made it. Many quit or faded into obscurity, but Will Durst, Johnny Steele, and Larry ""Bubbles"" Brown kept at it all these years. They have no other choice to but to find a way to get onstage and tell their jokes and to make a living.

3 Still Standing is a far superior doc than Kevin Pollak's ""Misery Loves Comedy"" which was a meandering treatise on what comedy was about. That doc was all talk about comedy, 3 Still Standing is a heartfelt portrait of what it's truly like to be a not so famous working comic. We learn about Durst's start in Milwaukee clubs, moving to SF and telling jokes for 16 hours to get into the Guinness Book of World Records, and becoming one of the nation's top satirists. Steele is a high energy comic who constantly works the angles but can't get over the hump to stardom. But the most compelling figure is Brown, a beloved figure in the comedy community, who goes 21 years between appearances on Letterman. Self deprecating, depressed, but ultimately hilarious, ""Bubbles"" goes out on the road with Dana Carvey.

Come for the laughs but you'll stay for the story. Absolutely worth a look.",1462406400,,1561,4.508833922261484
8747738,4,B01ALA0XKK,"Living in San Francisco, I know a little bit of the history of stand up comedy here. I watched this to get a deeper understanding of the history. And I was not disappointed on just how deep they went into the scene. Except the downfall.

The film does a fantastic job of not focusing just on the 3 comics, but also goes in deep on the beginnings and history and downfall of comedy in SF. Ok, a little less on the reason for the downfall, but I'll get in to that.

It's classic documentary style when it comes to the lives of the comics, past and present. They interview lots of other well-known comics to give you a somewhat rounded out view of their lives, again, past and present.

The details say 90 mins, but for some reason it felt like a 2 hour documentary. I'm not able to check it again at this moment, but it 'felt' long to me. Not that it dragged, it just felt rich and deep and like it punched through a LOT of layers. Anyway, felt like a 2 hour long documentaryin a good way.

My only gripe with it is that they glossed over the downfall of stand up comedy, especially in SF. (Redacting what little spoilers there are) They mention _____ as the culprit, but don't really go into detail about it. They mention it in one or two lines, tops. I personally think it was not just ______, but more about a lack of diversity in the scene. Audiences were getting more diverse and comedy as a whole was getting more diverse, and I think people wanted to here from more than just white men. Among other things.

Great production value, edited well, and really felt well put together. Definitely recommend it to anyone interested in SF comedy scene.

I received this movie at a discount to evaluate and provide an unbiased and honest review. This review was written by me and of my own opinion after watching this movie. The movie being offered at a discount did NOT sway my opinions in any way.",1462320000,,1895,4.338983050847458
