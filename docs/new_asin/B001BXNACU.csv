8285073,3,B001BXNACU,This Bio is nothing special even though the people it's about were.  I heart a recording of the Howard Stern Show that John was a guest on....and John said he did not participate in this Bio or any Bio and didn't even know there was one.  So....I just don't think this was a very well done piece of work.  But I would have purchased it anyway because I like to watch and read almost anything on JFK Jr except for pieces of work where people are betraying his trust.  This is average at best and most of it is about his parents more than it is about Jr.,1391731200,2,552,4.083333333333333
8285074,5,B001BXNACU,"This was a very informative and awesome documentary about JFK, JR.  It was good to hear from people who knew him what he was like.  I enjoyed watching all the video clips and interviews which confirm that he is gracious and a good guy, as well as being drop dead gorgeous.  He's destined for greatness...not because of his name but because of who he is.",1252195200,5,353,4.4

8285076,5,B001BXNACU,"This magnificent man is highly portrayed in this first rate biography.  It will make you laugh, cry, but most of all, it will make your heart ache.  This video will bring John to life everytime you envision it's beauty.",962150400,,219,4.589743589743589
