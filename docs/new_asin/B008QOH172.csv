Names of well known artist aren't even pronounced correctly throughout the entire DVD. They hardly play any of the artist songs. The background songs are from other artists. The commentator was horrible and talked pretty much in monotone even while reciting the artist raps instead of having clips of the artist himself performing. I brought this DVD because my husband is the ultimate NAS fan and even he said this end was trash and an insult to the artist themselves.

Please don't waste your time or money by purchasing this DVD.",1394841600,2,639,4.705357142857143
