2874235,5,B000RPCJPC,"This DVD is taken from the WGBM production directed by Ilan Ziv.  It is admirably objective considering that Ziv was born in Israel and fought in the Yom Kippur War of 1973.  He came to the US and graduated from New York University's film school soon afterwards.

The film consists of interviews with soldiers and politicians from both the Arab and Israeli side along with footage shot during the war.  I say the film is ""admirably objective"" but of course there is no such thing as absolute objectivity in such matters, and I am sure that Arab viewers will find the production disagreeable.  This disagreement may stem largely from the fact that the Six Day War in June, 1967 was an unmitigated disaster for Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, and especially for Palestine.

However, Israel's swift and decisive victory brought with it no lasting peace.  It did however humiliate the Arabs who imagined that they should be able to defeat such a tiny nation as Israel with Allah on their side and great leadership from Egypt's charismatic President Gamal Adbel Nassar and Jordan's King Hussein.  To save face Arab leaders have done two things.  One, they have inculcated the faithful with the notion that Israel won only because the US and other allies helped them; and Two, they have refused to acknowledge defeat holding onto the notion that the war is not over and that the Arab nations will yet achieve victory.

Ziv's film emphasizes the political nature of the conflict, revealing the thinking of leaders on both sides, showing how Moshe Dayan assumed a position of power and influence just prior to the war and how Nassar deluded himself (or was deluded by his military people) into thinking the combined forces of Egypt, Syria and Jordan could defeat the Israelis.  In the United States President Lyndon Johnson was advised by his military people that if the Israelis struck first they would win in a week or so, if second, it would take them perhaps two weeks.  Johnson remarked (at the time mired in Vietnam) that his generals did a great job of analyzing prospective wars in which they would not be involved, or words to that effect.

Ziv reminds the viewer that the war could have escalated into a much wider conflict, possibly bringing in the Soviet Union on the side of the Arabs and the US on the side of Israel.  Some teletype messages between Soviet Premier Aleksei Kosygin and Johnson are recalled.

Some facts gleaned from the film:

Israel struck first with well-timed, precision bombing of Arab airfields so that the Arab states were left with no air power.  The war was, effectively speaking, over then within hours of its start.  However, when the report of the air disaster reached Nassar, instead of seeking peace as fast as possible, he ordered propaganda broadcasts replete with fictitious ""victories.""  Black and white film clips show the Arabs in jubilant celebration.  How cruel it was when the truth came a few days later.

Israeli's preemptive first strike was prompted by the military build up by Egypt and Nassar's closing of the Strait of Hormuz, which most authorities consider an act of war.  The film strongly suggests that if Israel had not acted first it would have suffered many more casualties, especially from Arab air power.

And then there is the famous phone call from the Arab states that never came.  The Israelis were willing to trade land for peace, but the Arabs decided to pretend that the war would continue and so they did not negotiate a peace treaty.  The actual fighting ended because the super powers and the United Nations demanded that Israel halt its advances.

There is some almost nostalgic footage of Moshe Dayan, Israeli's heroic Defense Minister who led the armed forces to victory, and some of indecisive Prime Minister Levi Eshkol.  Ziv recreates the story of their difference of opinion on what Israel should do and how Dayan's position prevailed.

The real losers in the war have turned out to be the Palestinian people who have been under occupation since the war ended.  The Arab states that were instrumental in bringing about this human tragedy seem content to blame Israel while doing nothing substantive to help the Palestinians.  Indeed a significant portion of the terrorism directed at Israel and the West is motivated by spiteful spasms of revenge by Arabs who are desperate to somehow erase what they see as a humiliating defeat.  How much wiser it would be to realize that what happened in 1967 reflects not at all on the manhood of anyone living today, or even then for that matter.  Israel won because it could not lose.  ""Manhood"" and heroic acts of valor or lack thereof have nothing to do with it.

Sadly, as many others have noted, Israel may win all the battles and all the wars and yet never achieve peace.  Theirs is an unenviable position.  As long as they exist in the midst of Arab nations who hate them and teach their children to hate, they will always be on a military footing.  Only when the old hatreds die, some many years from now, will there be lasting peace in the Holy Lands.",1201219200,196,5066,4.774971297359357
2874236,5,B000RPCJPC,"This is an excellent presentation of the events leading up to and including the historic six-day war between Israel and the surrounding Arab nations in June, 1967.  The viewpoint seems to be fair, balanced, and entirely factual, emphasizing the ever important concept that Israel was fighting for its very right to exist as a nation, rather than seeking territorial gain, which was a by-product of Israel's successful prosecution of the war.  Although perhaps overlooked by the present generation, this brief conflict in 1967 is one of the most important historic events of the twentieth century.

As an example, the film seems to attempt to soften Egypt's stated plan to ""exterminate"" Israel by saying things like, the Egyptian and other Arab leaders had little choice but to move forward (in trying to exterminate) since their public was now excited and energized by this. They also refer to Israel and Egypt as, ""the enemies"".  As if there is equivalence.  As if Israel is trying to exterminate Egypt, and Egypt is trying to exterminate Israel. So disappointed in this.

2874383,5,B000RPCJPC,"A very authoritative look at the Six Day War of 1967 through dozens of interviews with diplomats, politicians, scholars, and soldiers, from Israel, the Arab states, the Soviet Union , and the USA.

Stresses particularly

Egyptian dictator Gamal Abdel Nasser's dream of a socialist secular Arab state stretching across the Middle East which tiuny Israel stood in the way of , leading Nasser to make plans for Israel's annihilation

the very sinister and perfidious role of the Soviet Union to push the Arabs particularly Syria into attacking Israel by feeding them fabricated information about Israeli troops massed on the borders which were not in fact true

The bellicose actions and rhetoric of Arab leaders particularly Nasser, leading to a sombre mood in Israel.
Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq thundered  'plans to bomb every Israeli city and town to the ground.  Radio Cairo just before the Six Day War  thundered messages such as this particularly  bloodthirsty and chilling one ""All you Zionists, you get out, if you don't we are coming for you, and we will chop open your bellies and chop off your hands.and we will take the living babies from your stomachs"".

Jubilant crowds of hundreds of thousands baying for Jewish blood and lionizing Nasser thronged Cairo for months before the war
Massive troop deployments against Israel's borders by Egypt and Syria, followed by Nasser ordering the UNited Nations out of the Sinai and closing the Straights of Tiran as direct act of war forced Israel to finally act after long periods of delay.

The lack of preparedness of Levi Eshkol to take action against such obvious  Arab aggression and plans for annihilation
the nervous breakdown of Chief of Staff of the Israel Army at the time Yitzhak Rabin
the appointment by popular demand of Moshe Dayan as Defence Minister , and how Dayan ultimately took charge of things from an indecisive Eshkol.

Arab media fabrications of great victories against Israel all the while Israel was triumphing on the battlefield

Israel's please to Jordan not to enter the war
The conversation between Nasser and KIng Hussein of Jordan where they decided to fabricate lies of American and British intervention in the war on Israel's side in order to save face after their ignominious defeat

Israeli hopes for peace after the war , including interviews with ordinary Israelis where they state their only hope is for peace rather than joy at capturing disputed territories.

Disillusionment in Arab states at the total defeat of the war after they had convinced themselves they would soon crush Israel and annihilate it's population Nasser's resignation and withdrawal of his resignation after large demonstrations demanding he stay on as President.

Israel's offer of swapping all the territories captured straight after the war answered by the conference in Khartoum where the Arab powers reiterated the three NO's rejecting any peace with, recognition of or accommodation with Israel.

with Israel striving desperately for some sort of a peace deal that grants her survival and security and total rejection by the Palestinian terror networks  and their sponsors little has changed",1410480000,3,3168,5.1423001949317735

The picture quality is very good and if it had been properly presented would have been excellent considering the large amount of historical film it contained. The same can be said about the sound which is pretty clear but only stone age US TVs only closed captions are available. Not everyone has such a TV and as this disc will inevitably be watched outside the US proper subtitles should have been offered throughout, not just when Arabic, Hebrew or Russian are spoken.. The material is a well balanced and most interesting presentation that should be particularly interesting to Arabic speakers as much of the content is from Egyptian sources.

2874473,5,B000RPCJPC,"This here documentary presents possibly the most clear and concise account of the Six Day War, a conflict characterized by madcap lunacy and confusion that worked out great for Israel, due pretty much entirely to its air force.

The lead up to war is chronicled in fashion that clearly accentuates the Cold War politics that virtually caused the entire thing to begin with.  Aside from the many minor conflicts, skirmishes, attacks, and operations involving all the future players (Israel, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Palestine, etc), the most direct cause is given to the Soviet Union.

I'm unsure if the documentary was claiming or implicating (though it never did explain why) the Soviet Union into intentionally letting slip to Egypt and Syria false information that Israel was massing on the border with Syria plotting to invade.  Driven not at all by antisemitism and almost entirely by petty ""Stick it to the US"" political mentality (which is being sadly revived nowadays in Russia) the Soviet Union succeeded in freaking out the Arab countries, and spawning a self-fulfilling prophecy in which Arab nations from Syria to Egypt and Tunisia and Morocco joined together to crush Israel once and for all, retaliation for their defeat 20 years earlier.

This led to a massive rising amongst Syrians and Egyptians to strike at Israel first.  Particular emphasis is put on Nasser of Egypt, in his rallying the people to war with Israel.  When the US discovers these plans, the Soviets completely pull out their support for Egypt.  It then becomes a tragic farce when Nasser discovers that the Soviet intelligence was false, and now has the US and the USSR banding together trying to dissuade him from war, but by this time the warpath has been engaged and the Arab world is pressing relentlessly for war.

As time came and both sides faced off waiting for any little thing to provoke the conflict, Israel lost its nerve first.  Rather than foolishly lashing out, they brilliantly coordinated a series of pre-emptive air strikes that all but decided the war then and there, utterly crippling the Egyptian air force and ensuring that Israel owned the skies.

The ensuing war is described as a terrible clusterf-k in which both sides were driven as much by confidence in their own successes as by fear of their own predicaments.  The Israelis ended up taking so many prisoners, they had to release soldiers and keep only officers prisoner.  Undoubtedly, many died as they were basically forced to march back to the Suez, and others ended up dead, allegedly executed by Israeli soldiers.  It's even alleged that Nasser had some Egyptian stragglers flocking to the Suez killed to cover up the extend of Egypt's defeat.  The documentary makes no brazen claims unsubstantiated, though makes it very clear that Egypt lied to its allies in order to minimize chaos from rumors of defeat.

The Israeli offensive in the war led to their occupation of the Golan Heights, the West Bank, the Sinai, the Gaza Strip, and the entirety of old Jerusalem, of which Israel still holds Gaza, the West Bank, and all of Jerusalem even today, the basis for virtually all Israeli-Palestinian conflicts since then.

The documentary does a spectacular job of recounting the events of the war and portraying the confusion and panic associated on both sides, particularly the frayed nerves that led to Israeli jets firing on their own troops or Syrians rushing at Israeli troops to avoid aircraft fire.  While not passing any judgment on historical figures, Nasser comes across very favorably overall, emphasizing his early attempts to avoid war, and his post-war concession to the people of Egypt that they refused to accept.

The only thing missing from this is the USS Liberty incident, but that incident has been so thoroughly polarized and riven with controversy, the touchstone for antisemites and conspiracy theorists to spout their BS from, that it could warrant its own full length documentary.  An hour-by-hour rundown of the events only go further in supporting this documentary's atmosphere of confusion, paranoia, and anxiety, as communications broke down, banal decisions come back later to have severe consequences (such as removing the identified US ship from the radar screen because it was identified as non-hostile), and fears of provoking a nuclear standoff with Russia yet again (the aircraft initially sent to the Liberty's aid were armed with nuclear weapons, and recalled soon after their launch due to this concern) caused this debacle.  Going through the evidence myself, I am thoroughly convinced that this incident remains a heated controversy today due solely to antisemitism and/or anti-Israeli sentiment.

Problem?  Go in the toilet and argue.  I make no brazen accusations without good evidence, and don't automatically assume ""GUBMINT CUVRR UP"" if I can't find the evidence I may or may not want.  I have always found that no government on earth is even remotely competent enough to pull off those sorts of conspiracies and coverups.",1358467200,5,5030,5.082624544349939

2874530,5,B000RPCJPC,"This is a very well done documentary with some great archival footage. For it not only documents the war itself, but more importantly events leading up to is and the dilemmas faced by main characters on both sides of the conflict -- Israeli PM Levi Eshkol on one side and Egyptian leader Nasser on the other. Both of these leaders were exposed to some pretty intense pressures and the documentary does a terrific job retracing all the steps, exposing the sources of pressure, motivations behind them, etc.

The other great thing about this documentary is that it also brings in a number of eye witnesses from both sides, who are all pretty frank about their assessment. It's interesting to hear the commentaries from the point of view of Nasser's secretary, high-ranking Soviet officials, Syrian student in Cairo, Egyptian soldier, U.S.-born Palestinian journalist in Jerusalem, Jordanian commanders, UN commander, CIA officials, U.S. government officials, Israeli generals, soldiers and fighter pilots as well as Israeli civilians. This really puts it in even greater perspective.

The other interesting thing is how this documentary illuminates the misinformation and bias about the real state of affairs perpetuated by many Arab governments and media. It's interesting to hear Nasser boasts with almost sure victory in a conflict he instigated based on flawed intelligence from the Russians. He's touting the strengths of his armies which are ready for war, unaware that the war had already begun. Yet, when it's all over he refuses to take responsibility, blames the Brittish and the Americans for intervening on behalf of Israel even when the Israelis have clear evidence from an intercepted phone call between Nasser and King Hussein of Jordan plotting how to find a scape goat for their own folly.

But it also looks at the war and its outcome as the seed of the current conflict, the occupation of West Bank and Golan Heights, the land for peace principle and the general trauma that the war inflicted on the Arab world. I think this is a very valid point, which is no doubt controversial among Israelis as well as in the Arab world, but it effectively illustrates how we got to where we are now.

The authors got access to some pretty unique archival war footage, most of it from the Israelis. This is definitely a must-see documentary for anyone interested in the Middle East and wars in general. I certainly recommend it.",1220572800,20,2432,4.997530864197531
2874531,5,B000RPCJPC,"Few examples of Arabic folly and hyberpole exist more clearly than in the Six Days War.  Brought to the point of frenzy by the antics of Egypt's Nassuer, the Arab world expected and wanted a bloodbath in Isreal.  A byproduct of the Cold War, the 1967 Arab Isreali War was Islam's desperate attempt to attone for its sins of the 1948 War, which allowed the creation of the Isreali State.

This documentry provides a very clear and compelling look at the events leading up to and including the Isreali Blitzkreig of 1967.  Although few doubted that Isreal could hold its own in any Middle East conflict, the extent of Arab incompetence and folly made the events of this conflict even more lop-sided in its results.  Isreal almost tripled the size of its territory as a result of this war. The Egyptian and Arab air forces were all totally destroyed in a few hours in a dawn Blitzkreig that would have made any Whermacht commander proud!

The true folly of the Arab world is shown in the aftermath of this devastingly brief conflict where all the arab leaders manage to stay in power despite their imcompetence.  No more humilating and bitter pill than this could be swallowed by any self-respecting individual.  No wonder Arab pride is so wounded and susceptible to such demogogues that it has today!  Many of the problems of Isreali occupation of Gaza and the West Bank of Palestine can be traced to this conflict, and despite Isreali overtures to trade land for Peace in the region, the Arab World continues in its own delusions.  Another devastating war would follow in 1973 which again proved an emotional roller-coaster for the Arab Street.  And another devastating defeat for both Syria and Egypt.

One thing is clear after watching this very concise and accurate video, the Arab world's illusions of grander continue to this day.  Islamic Terror tries now to accomplish what armed conflict always failed to do.  Arab armies are tools of politcal domination for their leaders to use in order to remain in power, they have no real use against any kind of professional, occidental army.  Islam continues to delude itself as to its own supposed greatness, while the repressed peoples of its various regimes grumble and await their destiny.
