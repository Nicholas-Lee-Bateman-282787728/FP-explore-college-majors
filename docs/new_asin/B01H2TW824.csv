7776308,4,B01H2TW824,"Sometimes a movie comes out that is so bad, it actually turns out to be good.  This sums up Sharknado perfectly.  It's wonderfully bad, over-the-top silly, and is more corny than a Western Nebraska farm field.  It spills over with cheese, but (oddly enough) it's that same cheese that makes the films fun to watch.  None of the films ever try to portray themselves as something they are not.  Everyone involved with the films knows how bad they will be, so there's never a false promise of something good (except the number of eye-rolls present in almost every scene).  This is a film franchise that took a huge bite (pun IS intended) on pop culture, and stuck.  All of this makes up the appeal of these films, which delivers total brainless fun from start to finish.  It is the manifestation of the term ""jumping the shark"" on a whole new level.  And that doesn't even begin to describe the insane number of cameos from Hollywood heavyweights found, which has become another staple of the series.
To wrap the whole thing up, I give Sharknado 4 stars because it is what it sets out to be: over-the-top silly cheesy violent snarky (sharky?) campy melo-dramatic repeated eye-rolling ""I-can't-believe-I-just-sat-through-that"" fun.  And, just to save you the trip over to IMDB, yes there is a Sharknado 4 already in the works.  If there's any modern film franchise that deserves the immortal stamp of quality (?!) from Mystery Science Theater 3000, it would be the Sharknado series.",1474502400,3,1478,4.825396825396825

The two with Sharknado movies on them said ""not programmed for your viewing area"". How does the DVD even know what area it's in. The third disk just said disk ""error"".
She was very disappointed as she has never seen these movies. I was extremely disappointed at having given her a defective gift.

7776314,4,B01H2TW824,"For sheer cheapjack entertainment value, and even for those who don't like shark movies or so bad they're good bad movies, the Sharknado series is hard to beat.  Whoever thought mixing up sharks and tornados has been laughing their way to the bank ever since.  In comparison to the sequels the ridiculous movie that started it all seems like a formula drama for in each successive sequel the producers have decided to go for broke and ratchet up the outrageous quotient.  Outside of the zany its raining killer sharks like guided missiles from the sky basis on which this movie is based the producers have added a ton of guest stars like a giddy entourage name dropper and to increase the tension they inevitably increase the sci-fi aspects and throw in a few nods to several other recent for the time hit movies.  After enjoying Sharknado far more than I thought I should I thought that they couldn't outdo the craziness of Sharknado 2 but I was wrong as Sharknado 3 was even more gonzo and I was lasking (laugh-askinglets get this going as a new word!) myself, When will this madness stop!?!

7776333,4,B01H2TW824,"I bought these as a birthday gift for my father, who loves SyFy's original movies. The first two ""Sharknado"" movies are surprisingly good, deconstructing the monster genre and having fun while they do it. For a relatively low budget, they contain plenty of entertainment and are just a fun way to spend a couple hours. The third film jumps the shark, pun intended. The series begins to feel as though they were making sequels because they had to, rather than for the fun of it. Despite this drawback, this three-film set is a great way to enjoy these surprisingly entertaining flicks.",1502755200,,584,4.792079207920792

7776346,5,B01H2TW824,"Sharknado- Syfy now has a hit on their hands. The Sharknado films have now become cult classics and like the 'Super Bowl' for the Syfy channel. Personally, I hope they keep making them. The cheesier, the better. This is where it all began. The film is about a group of people led by Fin Shepard, trying to survive a tornado filled with deadly sharks, AKA Sharknado. Fin, Nova, George, April, Baz, Claudia and Matt try to stick together and survive and come up with unique ways of fighting the sharks. If you love cheesy campy cult movies, you'll love SHARKNADO!!!

Sharknado 2: The Second One- This is still stupidly awesome. I think it's actually better, campier, sillier and more fun than the original. This one is filled with random cameos from people such as Robert Hays, Matt Lauer, Kelly Osbourne, Kelly Ripa, Al Roker, Billy Ray Cyrus, Judd Hirsch, Jared the Subway guy and many others.

This time, the sharknado hits in New York City when Fin Shepard and April Wexler is on tour to promote her new book How to Survive a Sharknado and Other Unnatural Disasters (Which is actually a real book you can buy on Amazon) Fin goes around trying to save his family and friends from this newer and bigger sharknado that can't be stopped by explosives this time. If you love silly cheesy over the top campy B-movies, you'll love SHARKNADO 2: THE SECOND ONE!!!

Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!- The Sharknado films just keep getting cheesier, better and awesomer. I love that they know it's silly, but they embrace it. From saving the President in Washington DC, from saving everyone at Universal Orlando, and even all the way in outer space, Fin Shepard is back and ready to fight the biggest Sharknado yet. Keep a look out for all the cameos and references to other great films. Be sure to watch after the credits, because there is a scene that involves the fate of April. If you love cheesy B-movies, you'll definitely love SHARKNADO 3: OH HELL NO!!!

Be sure to check out Sharknado: The 4th Awakens and brace yourself because Sharknado 5 is coming Summer 2017!! : )",1486512000,,2058,4.63013698630137
7776347,4,B01H2TW824,"The Asylum makes movies, except bad. They used to have great story ideas (that were mostly rip-offs, but occasionally with a better twist) and terrible sound/special effects. Now they have decent sound, complete rip-offs or stupid ideas nobody else would do, and terrible special effects. Honestly, I'm just so happy that their sound isn't garbage anymore. Their special effects are still terrible, but at least in these movies, their special effects are hilariously terrible instead of just garbage.

In terms of the story, the movie is about (spoiler) sharks that arrive via tornado. In the first movie, the tornados start in water (which is where the sharks come from) but by the fourth movie, the sharks apparently just live in tornados now and tornados last for weeks and travel across multiple midwestern states (the same tornado, mind you). If that sentence doesn't have you interested, I can only offer you two words: Tara Reid. Not naked Tara Reid like her Playboy spread, but fully clothed Tara Reid, with all of her mediocre/decent acting which people put up with because of how ridiculously hot she is. If you are not interested in the comedic value of Tara Reid trying to play the stupid story seriously, or Tara Reid, skip these movies (seriously). I watched all of these on Netflix before buying them so I knew what I was getting myself into. The hottest girl in the quadrilogy gets killed in the first 12~ minutes of the first movie (while a guy somewhat loudly says ""hey get out of the water!""). Another hot girl in the first movie REALLY hates sharks because one of them killed her grandpa and bit her - but her delivery is pretty flat, so I was left wondering if she didn't really like her grandpa or if I'm just supposed to be distracted by her boobs. They have classic exchanges like: ""Man, I can't believe I forgot my gloves again."" ""What, are you afraid of the dark?"" I, too, wear gloves because I am afraid of the dark...

TL;DR:
The story will be predictable.
The characters will be predictable.
The special effects will be bad.
The plot will be stupid.
Character development is nonexistent.
The acting will not be good.",1486080000,,2145,4.7479892761394105
