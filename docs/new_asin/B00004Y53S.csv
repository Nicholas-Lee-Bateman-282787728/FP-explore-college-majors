The Scotland video-- which is sort of a history of the Scotish soldier-- is the best of the lot. Lots of reenactment footage and commentary, though one of the ""historical speakers"" made us think of ""Tim the Enchanter"" from the Monty Python Grail movie.  Mostly it's a good video.

The Wales one is feeble-- lots of shots of a bearded guy, pretending to be the single great Welsh leader (so it would seem) standing on a hill side thinking.  After the 12th take of this same shot... well, it was tedious. About 25% interesting stuff and the rest filler, it seemed. The Britain video is also filled with lots of silly druid types, with a few actually good actors doing readings from the period.  They are well done, if a bit overlong.

Overall, it's a collection I'll put in the bargin bin.",1111017600,2,926,4.514970059880239
