1876770,1,B000092Q6W,"I should have known better--and now at least you all will be warned.
All this DVD has is a collection of the same clips and interviews taken from this company's other DVD releases ""Lennon The Messenger"", ""Harrison The Quiet One"", and ""Beatles Big Beat Box"". So, some of the good Harrison stuff is on here, but not all of it by any means. This is just kind of like a sampler disc of the other three DVDs. Same horrible quality on the Beatles clips and Messenger samples as before. A cheap, underhanded attempt to keep re-packaging and re-name the same sludge over and over. Of course there is plenty of time and space that this could have included all the content from all three of those other titles, but no, this is still just an hour like the others. In many ways that is still an hour too long. Same old stuff on the audio CD too.
I can't believe the cost either! All of these DVDs should be bargain basement priced for what you get. I wish there had been a review before I bought this, because I wouldn't have. Now you know, avoid anything this studio puts out.",1064707200,35,1065,4.33
7988534,1,B000092Q6W,"A poorly edited, amateurish production.  Individual scenes drag on and on but add nothing to the overall story.  Entire movie is disjointed and not told in chronological order (film opens talking about George's death).  It almost seems that the people putting it together knew nothing at all about the Beatles and were just winging it -- splicing footage together willy nilly.  Captions will often show the DATE of a particular piece of footage but not the year.  Featured songs and incidental music is NOT by the Beatles but similar-sounding songs performed by the film's director.  The whole experience is profoundly disappointing.

Not only a waste of money but a complete waste of time watching it.",1385683200,,702,5.052173913043478
7988535,1,B000092Q6W,"If you like the editing acumen of a Beatles youtube playlist, and like to watch footage of the Fab four to Karaoke level covers of their non-original songs then you're in for a treat!  I don't know if this is just a cynical cash grab, or a student film, but something's up.  I'm suspicious.",1379203200,,290,4.351851851851852
7988536,1,B000092Q6W,"As said in other reviews, this was repackaged fluff.

I thought this was going to be a discussion of their collaborative efforts on guitar or vocal work, and maybe some songwriting craft, maybe some personal stories about the two of them together.  Not any Beatles music in this at all,  which tells you how little discussion there will be on their collaboration.  Every time someone else's inferior version of ""Taste of Honey"" started playing, it reminded me of how little effort was made to produce any quality.  Poor editing on interviews, poor choice of interviews, poor narrative.  Most of the footage seems to be on the death of these two very interesting men.  I'm beginning to wonder if the creators of this thing have ever heard a Beatles record.

George Martin is interviewed quite a bit, and I find it amazing how so many of his interviews seem to be about the great George Martin. He even wears an ascot, very rock-n-roll. You'd think the Beatles should have been named after him.  Similarly, there is footage a young woman who seems to be trying to follow a similar path to Harrison's, and she seems to make her commentary about Harrison all about herself as well. I'm waiting for her and Martin to collaborate on their spin-off documentary.",1372982400,,1254,4.741935483870968
7988537,1,B000092Q6W,"Like me, if you love anything Beatles related, chances are you're gonna buy this garbage.

List of why it's terrible and just a cash grab:

1. TERRIBLE FOOTAGE
2. NO ABSOLUTE FOCUS OR STORY
3. REPEATED CRAPPY NON-BEATLES MUSIC (they just want to sell this band)
4. UNORGANIZED
5. CHEAP PRODUCTION

Don't buy it, it's a rip-off.",1364169600,,327,4.701754385964913
7988538,1,B000092Q6W,the songs on here are neither written or performed by The Beatles... This is just random footage put together in random order..,1338681600,2,127,4.818181818181818
7988539,1,B000092Q6W,"This was a bizarre ""documentary"" which had choppy editing, no chronology, no actual Beatles music (all performed by a cover band, not even Beatles-written songs), and an odd choice of what to include, including a 5-minute interview with Mark David Chapman, Lennon's killer.  I have seen a lot of Beatles footage, and there were a few things I hadn't seen before, but nothing extraordinary by any means (which is probably why other, better documentaries chose not to show it!).  This is an obvious attempt to get money by slapping the name Beatles on something.",1241481600,23,560,4.946808510638298
7988540,3,B000092Q6W,"Before you take seriously what Richie Mason drops in his comments, put your mouse over his name, read his other comments. They all the same - like a carbon copy. He lies in his comments the reviewed product is a CD-R. Read tags to all his posted messages. He is not commenting on these products, he has his little personal war going. As I read more and more of his comments, seems, he is simply a sick man. Beware.",1215820800,,414,4.253164556962025
7988541,1,B000092Q6W,"I bought this because of the price and I got what I paid for! If you love the Beatles and enjoy any footage shot in the early years, you might like some of this. There is no setup for ""The Journey."" The editing is amateurish with some segments lasting way too long like the grueling Mark Chapman interview recalling the moments before and after he killed Lennon. The clips are just not that interesting. My impression is that the producer(s) had access to some third-rate archival footage and decided to make a buck. IF you can make it through to the end (I fast-forwarded a lot!) you'll see the self-serving end credits listing some songs and instrumental scoring performed by the people that produced the video. Don't buy this!",1212624000,2,729,4.658914728682171
7988542,1,B000092Q6W,"This dvd is a bootleg that ain't worth the powder to blow it to Hades.  The makers of the DVD do not respect copyright laws and from the looks of the dvd they don't care about quality either. It's a dvd-r, by the way, and who want's to pay $25 for a copy?  I am surprised AMAZON can't seem to get its act together in policing its own site.",1199491200,6,339,3.898550724637681
7988543,1,B000092Q6W,"This is the worst video I have ever seen. There is no apparent structure, it rambles on from one point in time to another. All of the music is some awful band the producer of this thing is in. The only ""interview"" they got is with someone who knew George in elemenary school! I was diappointed at the least and feel ripped off. Had to warn others: DO NOT BUY THIS!",1099699200,11,364,4.140845070422535
