1350891,4,B00004TJRU,"Highly enjoyable British comedy made in the late 70's.  The humor is engaging, and if you are a fan of such shows as ""Are You Being Served?"" no doubt you will enjoy this set.  My main gripe is that why in the world did the BBC start DVD distribution with the final installments of the series?  Paul Eddington is superb as is the rest of the cast. Enjoy!",1075939200,11,353,4.161764705882353
1350892,1,B00004TJRU,"Acorn Media has done the fans of Good Neighbors (known in the UK as The Good Life) a disservice with their transcription of the final series onto two DVDs.  Please bear in mind when reading this review that this is my favorite British comedy, ahead even of Monty Python's Flying Circus.
The quality of the pictures is no better than fair.  I could tolerate that, because my set of off-the-air VHS tapes has been played so much that the images are almost Impressionist pastels.  I was irritated that the bonus material is of such paucity as to be not worth your time; you can find out more about the show and its players from the Internet Moive Database than you can from the DVD. But even this is bearable.
What roused my anger was the fact that these brand new disks arrived in their original shrinkwrap but will not play properly.  Of the eight episodes provided, only three would play without trouble.  Of the remaining five, none would play normally; you get a portion of an episode, and then for unknown reasons the disk starts skipping as if you were fast-forwarding at 16 time normal speed.  One episode would not play at all.  And in the case of the bonus material, one part plays only in skip mode while the other won't play at all.
I have waited a long time for a DVD set of Good Neighbors that could replace my worn-out VHS tapes.  It now appears that I will have to wait until BBC America deigns to produce a complete set of DVDs of one of their most popular comedies ever, before I will be able to view Good Neighbors as it originally aired.",1052006400,26,1554,4.409090909090909
1350893,4,B00004TJRU,"I caught this show back in the mid '80's on PBS and have been wearing my videotape copies down to where they are barely watchable anymore.  Thank the powers that be that someone finally got around to releasing this series (or part of it, anyway) on DVD.  My question is, where's the rest of it?  I just emailed the distributor, and they said there are no current plans to release the rest of the series on this format.  ???",1048723200,12,423,4.3164556962025316
1350894,2,B00004TJRU,"I just purchased the DVD version of the Final Episode and the Royal Command Performance.  After watching just the first disk, I am disappointed.  This product has not been video remastered and some scenes are very hard to watch indeed.  They seem to shimmer a slightly out of focus haze that is distracting and not the quality that we expect of a DVD.  In this regard AcornMedia has cheated us and I probably will not  buy the rest of the series on DVD.
  Otherwise I agree with all of the other comments.  Good Neighbors is an excellent show and a wonderful laugh.",1037145600,33,565,4.470588235294118
1350895,5,B00004TJRU,"What can I say about ""Good Neighbors,"" or ""The Good Life?""  I own every episode that I can get on VHS.  Now I own this DVD set with the added Royal Command Performance.  I am waiting for the DVD release of the COMPLETE series.  Come on BBC!
These episodes are wonderful.  In ""Away from it All""  the Goods decide they've burned out of self-sufficiency and decide to take a break.  I love the role reversal in this with the Ledbetter's.  One word, ""flollopy.""
""The Green Door"" also has some great twists.  Margo is doing something secretly and the Good's curiosity runs rampant.  The other episodes are great also.  ""Sweet and Sour Charity"" has great Margo moments, and ""Anniversary"" sums it all up so nicely.  ""When I'm 65"" the Royal Command Performance was great!  After the lead in of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, there are some backstage shots and welcoming of the cast.  You even get a glimpse of Felicity Kendal's son giving the queen a bouquet.  Interesting narrative on facts surrounding the show.  The episode itself involves Tom's worries about their retirement.  The scene at the bank is pure ""Good.""  Then Jerry challenges Tom to a race to see who is more physically fit.  I already owned the final season on VHS, but I recommend the DVD for the extras.",1022630400,17,1269,4.660633484162896
1350896,5,B00004TJRU,"I have never in my life saw a show as wonderful as this. The characters are supurb, the story line is great and if that don't get you, Felicity Kendal is the most beautiful woman on two legs!  The last episode will make you weep. My only regret in seeing this series is that I won't ever see a new series like this again. I am really glad I got to know those neighbours!",984268800,6,370,4.0
1350897,5,B00004TJRU,"I saw this series when it came to US TV some years ago (thank you, forever, PBS).  I loved it then.  I love it now.  I've got the whole collection, finally.
Stars:  Tom & Barbara Good, played by Richard Briers and Felicity Kendal - whom I worship, and Margo & Jerry Leadbetter, played by Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington.
I also saw Felicity Kendal in a PBS replay of the BBC Shakespeare series with her starring as Viola in ""Twelfth Night"" and was so impressed that I named a daughter after her.
Felicity (and the other cast members) are believable, funny, and always in trouble, love, etc., with each other.
The setting...  Tom & Barbara move to a ritzy neighborhood and start a farm... well, more like they decide to ""live off the land.""  Try that in a swank neighborhood and I'm sure you'll end up with some of the problems they had.
Totally hysterical.  Very funny.  A must see.  Own it if you can.  Definitely for the whole family.",970099200,9,938,4.464705882352941
1350898,5,B00004TJRU,"Penelope Keith is the TV equivalent of film's Maggie Smith.  Going from brittle and castigating to touching and sincere, Keith's Margo Leadbetter is a brilliant creation of character and attitude.
This ensemble show has been a staple on PBS for  years and deserves a long video life.  It is a surprise that no one  considered remaking this for American TV.  I don't think it would work as  well since part of the fun involves the very British barbs and  personalities in each episode.
The peak episode of the series involves a  windbreak that Margo wishes to install in her garden.  Keith has a  brilliant three-minute monologue on why she has no sense of humor that  demonstrates her skills as an actress and the unexpected depth of the  script.",961545600,4,746,4.7421875
1350899,5,B00004TJRU,"Anyone who's a fan of British comedies knows that the 70's were one of the best decades for that genre. Many of my favorites started then-Monty Python, Are you being served, To the manor born, & the best of them  all-Good Neighbors. or, as it was known in britain, the Good Life. When I  1st watched this show, i wanted to do what tom  & barbara good had  done-become self-sufficent without having to go live in a commune in the  woods. the suburban lifestyle of their neighbors, the ledbetters{played  hilariously by paul eddington & the fabulous penelope keith-she also  did to the manor born} provides a humorous contrast to the good's spartan  lifestyle. these last 7 episodes allow the characters to develop more  fully, & bring the series to a climax. the final question the viewer  must answer for herself is, ""did they, or didn't they?"" my only  regret is that the series ended, & there aren't any more tapes  forthcoming.",961286400,4,930,4.708074534161491
7922781,5,B00004TJRU,What a terrific series. Loved for many years and was thrilled to see available on prime video. Then they took it away completely. I would have bought the whole series to view on my kindle but now it is too late. I hope they bring it back.,1452902400,,238,4.085106382978723

7922783,5,B00004TJRU,"This has always been one of my all time favorite series, but I don't believe I'd ever seen the Royal Command Performance.  Even though it happened in the 70's, it was wonderful.",1390262400,2,177,4.53125

7922785,5,B00004TJRU,"This is a very funny British comedy and I can not give it anything but 5 stars.  However, someone neglected to include in the description that the Complete Final Season is the same thing as the Complete Season 4.  So now I have a copy of both.",1375228800,2,243,4.148936170212766
7922786,5,B00004TJRU,We have enjoyed numerous chuckles and great laughs over this wonderful season of Good Neighbors. I am only sorry this was the final season of this great series.,1358726400,2,160,4.75
7922787,5,B00004TJRU,"Although on VHS I am very satisfied with quality and price paid.  Delivered on time and in shape advertised.  Didn't like having to see the intro's at the beginning of each and every chapter, redundant, and boring. Not the funniest British comedy, but entertaining and plausible story-line.  Certainly not over-the-top like Monty Python or Fawlty Towers.  The first British comedy I ever watched, so was glad to find it available for home viewing/ownership.",1314576000,2,457,5.219178082191781
7922788,3,B00004TJRU,"I grew up watching these on PBS.  This show was one of the first things my parents recorded on their VCR twenty-five years ago.  Our family loves the comedy.  Many lines, eg ""Dear sir, thank you for your splendid empty box . . . "", have become part of our dialogue.  I would recommend this series to anyone--just not this particular release.  The film quality is not up to par with what you would see on TV.  There has been a never release by the BBC which has much better quality.  If you are looking to add this show to your collection, try the newer release.",1151020800,,561,4.235849056603773
7922789,5,B00004TJRU,"I first saw ""Good Neighbors"" (1975-77) in the late 1970s on PBS, shortly after the show was completed.  I was impressed with the wit and comic timing of the actors, and the subtle comedy which didn't hit you over the head to make a point.  When they came on the market in VHS format, I decided to buy them in installments, and am very happy I did.

You likely know the story: Richard Briers plays Tom Good, a frustrated 40 year old draftsman who works for a plastics company.  Good and his wife Barabara (Felicity Kendall) decide to ""get back to basics"" and thereby Tom quits his job, turns the yard into a huge garden, buys chickens and pigs for livestock and decides to become self sufficient, bartering for only what they need, etc.  Not a practical life style for 1970s suburban London.  Contrasting are their neighbors: Jerry and Margo Ledbetter, played by Paul Eddington and Penelope Keith. Mr. Ledbetter is an executive in the plastics company Tom Good used to work for;  he crawls and grovels to the boss to keep his high paying job, which supports his expensive and well furnished home.  Ledbetter is a slave to his work despite finanicial prosperity;  Good doesn't answer to a boss or schedule, but faces obstacle after obstacle with his crops or livestock.

The chemistry and comic timing between all 4 principal actors is very fine, and the laughs are many and frequent.  Despite the impractical plot - no one would get away with having livestock in a subdivision anywhere in the civilized world for long - this makes for wholesome entertainment.  I haven't seen the DVD version for comparison, but the VHS tapes are very good quality: clear picture, great camera work.",1128556800,2,1681,4.719178082191781
7922790,5,B00004TJRU,"Whoops! I ment to enter this review on the full set ""Good Neighbors - The Complete Series 1-3"" which (hopefully) contains all episodes, not just the final year. Please read the following in that context...
This was a great and funny show! Other reviewers have already pointed out the things that made it so. I just want to add that I hope that the DVD includes all the episodes IN ORDER! The VHS tapes just threw various episodes together for no apparent reason. The episodes must be watched in order as the story and characters evolve as the show goes on. It even has a final episode of sorts (I don't want to give anything away). The only shows I found a little disappointing were the two 'extra episodes'. I believe one was a Christmas special and the other was a command performance of some sort. I felt that both were a little forced and not up to the quality of the regular season shows. The first time I saw Good Neighbors was when PBS aired it in the 1970s. At the time they were showing Good Neighbors and Faulty Towers back to back. A few years ago my (now adult) kids bought me the tapes of both because they still remembered how hard I laughed at those shows. Buy this DVD (and the Faulty Towers set) and you'll laugh too!",1114387200,4,1234,4.346320346320346
