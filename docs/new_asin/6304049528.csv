7859871,5,6304049528,"I discovered this video while looking for examples of folktales for my middle school students.  I have always enjoyed most of the Rabbit Ears videos and have had success using them with middle schoolers.  This Japanese story tells of a small boy whose family falls on hard times.  He is sent to stay with a priest, where he begins to show a talent for drawing cats -- LOTS of cats!  There is also a ""demon"" in the village, who brings destruction and pain.  You will enjoy the ending as much as my students and I did!
This story is beautifully drawn, the narration is outstanding (incredible voice and talents of William Hurt).  Elementary school children as well as older children would find this interesting.",1044057600,2,709,4.67741935483871
