4802637,5,B005LAJ1H2,"My wife & I enjoyed season 1 very much. Attention to detail, from the characters & setting. I only hope that season 2 stays on course, and does not deviate from actual events. The set-up of how the ""Mob"" took root in the ""Roaring Twenties"" is quit facinating !You have a winner in our household !!!  Grateful in Lakewood, Colorado",1329264000,,330,4.5
4802638,5,B005LAJ1H2,"I purchased for my son as a gift.  He loves Boardwalk Empire and is enjoying it.  This has a price guarantee as it was a pre-order, and the price dropped before it was shipped and I was only charged the lower price! My only complaint was not about the product, but I am pretty certain I said this was a gift, but my son did get the price included in his packing slip.",1327708800,,367,4.013698630136986

An ambitious Assistant State Attorney is in pursuit for murder and all kinds of charges. His old mini-nemesis, the fanatic prohibition agent thinks he can get at him now. His consort Margaret rethinks her relationship with the church..
Of course nothing is easy.
I can't remember any more entertaining melodramatic soap. Superb.",1327622400,17,494,5.346153846153846
4802640,2,B005LAJ1H2,"Boardwalk Empire had an interesting premise and some good historical material to mine. It worked ok for the first season. But as the second season went on, it became clear that the premise had been played out. The setting and the characters had been used up. And there was nowhere to go but down.

The first major problem was that the show degenerated into ""Good Irish Wife Playhouse"". This is a gangster drama. Most people (including me) want to see gangster drama rather than the overblown domestic trials and tribulations of I don't know how many ""good"" Irish wives in the cast. And because its Good Irish Wife playhouse, we have to treat the death of her wifebeating, baby-killing drunken husband Hans as great crime. Somehow nobody makes the point that killing a guy who beats his pregnant wife up in they way he did can be seen more as a sort of rough justice rather than a moral crime. I'm not sure anyone even bothers to make the point about what sort of guy Hans was.

About halfway through the season, they seemed to realize that the plot had run out. So they started killing and/or wrecking every character in the cast. By the end of the season, almost everyone but Thompson (and wife) was dead. Every episode seemed to require a shocking death or a shocking betrayal that often made little sense and were worse yet, against the actual history.

The real Commodore lived to 1934. Yet in the show he is killed in the early 1920s to provide more mixed up family drama leading to the death of another character. The Commodore was an important character to the show because he provided the bridge between the political machine and the business community.

The show also fails to understand the rules of a 1920s political machine. Gangsters were not going to openly kill high-profile businessmen or senior politicians without consequences. Especially a low-level gangster in Atlantic City. The show also doesn't understand that the local political machine fits into a bigger state-level machine with its own priorities.

The show also ignores the democratic party in terms of how things got done in that era. The democratic party (who controlled the statehouse at the time) would have been leading the charge to get members of the atlantic city machine. And the democratic machine would have existed in parallel with the republican machine. Working with gangsters in New York or other east coast cities would require political negotiations as well as negotiations with gangsters. Disputes between gangsters turn into disputes between politicians. The writers just don't understand and don't care much about how the era really worked.

By the end of the second season, everyone is dead and the show seems to have nowhere left to go. Its been renewed for a third season. But what that will consist of is unclear. They can either abandon history or they can repeat themselves.

Steve Buscemi does an outstanding job in the lead role. He is the only person associated with this program who deserves awards. Its just a pity that the writers are not up to creating better material for him to play.",1325980800,31,3097,4.81015037593985

4802844,5,B005LAJ1H2,"Love this season because it's Jimmy Darmody's last stand -- he was by far the coolest character on this show. The fact that they killed him off says a lot for the remaining seasons. Still, the whole season was worth it just for the last two episodes.",1493596800,,250,4.340425531914893
4802845,3,B005LAJ1H2,"The character Munya, played by William Forsythe is, to me, the most credible character so far.  It may be because Forsyth is such a solid character actor in the entire cast, but this character is a welcome addition.  The way the Darmody character is developed depends on the introduction of Munya to the storyline.

One problem that arises in this second season is that there are entirely too many anachronisms in this season.  The federal case against Nucky is made using RICO predicates, without calling it RICO.  The AUSA goes after Nucky for murder, which is not even a federal crime.  Maybe it's helpful to tell the story by ignoring historical facts like this, but it makes it too hard to suspend disbelief.

  Still, Boardwalk Empire is entertaining in a way that no 2 hour movie could ever be.  Thanks to HBO for introducing another great series.",1492732800,,854,4.7482993197278915

4803066,5,B005LAJ1H2,"Many films and TV series over the decades have dealt with the theme of gangster activity in 20th century America.  However, few TV series on the subject have been done as well as Boardwalk Empire.  Along with the Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire is loaded with excellent acting, powerful scripts and a story line consistent with what we know about not only that era but of Atlantic City history in particular.  As it turns out, the series is based on  real life personages such as Nucky Johnson (Nucky Thompson in the fictional role.)  It appears that the real life Nucky was not that far removed the series lead character.  However, one of the most striking aspects of the program is the way in which it depicts life in the 1920's down to the most minute details.  Watching the show gives one the impression that although the 1920's were not really that long ago, everyday life was dramatically different from today's world.  Of course, human nature has not changed very much and that is what makes this such as riveting and throughly entertaining series.",1485820800,,1050,4.762430939226519

I'm almost finished with season 3 and I kind of feel the same about that one, as well.  I realize that with a show such as this, with the character backgrounds and their many ""business"" dealings, there is going to be much bloodshed, but a few of the characters that died in season 2 was just plain sad!  I'm not crazy about some of the new characters, just because most of them are total A holes!  I hate the way the relationship between Nucky & Margaret has taken such a turn and her character has become just plain annoying! Overall, however, this show is SO good.

What is the big deal. The writing and the plot is just more of the same old same old: A bunch of big egos trying to muscle in on each other- what else is new. The first season was boring and this one is no different.  I am now convinced that the majority of critics here (on Amazon as well as on the entire internet) are very young and/or have not been exposed to much good and entertaining story telling in their time.

I don't have sophisticated electronics, an 8"" Kindle is within my means and until 3 weeks ago there was a 7"" Kindle.  BOARDWALK is great at any size, though I'm sure details are lost.  There is a scope to the Boardwalk that I didn't fully observe and the costumes were not as glorious.
But I enjoyed the characters and how apparently easy it was to overlook (or choose ignorance) activities that were illegal or immoral. Life must go on; survival of the fittest.
Jimmy was particularly fascinating, it was clear he was haunted by his past and I am guessing many might not catch the particular cues.

The fact that so many characters were based on the real people and happenings of the times made it a fun watch that will keep you checking in on your smart phone to see what were the exact circumstances and which people were real and which weren't.  The writers, producers and directors kept as much as possible true to the stories and times down to the costumes which were spot on.

4805754,5,B005LAJ1H2,"When I see an historical movie I want to see authenticity from haircuts to clothing. Boardwalk empire satisfied me many times over, as I tend to be a nonforgiving stickler for detail. I can't stress enough how delightful it was to see a production whose researchers knew what they were talking about. The styles changed with the passage of years. The cars were beautiful to behold. But the delicious icing on the cake was the music. Everything was in it's correct era of popularity. Barney Google was perfectly and psychotically sung. Japanese Sandman was authentically played on the uke as it would have been. I could go on with more examples, but the proof of the pudding was ""Does Your Spearmint Lose Its Flavor"". This is an obscure song from the 20s which later had to be re titled due to copyright concerns to ""Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor"".  In 1960 it was a hit song by Lonnie Donergan. Thanks for not insulting my intelligence by using the later title. It was wonderful to see such a well done historical production. Good on you!",1481068800,2,1046,4.623655913978495

What a setup. You people are more gangster than any of the players in the series. If i had known i had to pay in order to see the ending, i would not have wastes my time by watching the series in the first place. i watch all 4 seasons with great intensity just to be let down by the CHARGE of $2.99 to see the 13 remaining episodes of the 5th season. who is running amazon videos, ""NOOKIE"" of boardwalk empire?

Mesmerizing from beginning to end.  I'm binge watching & covered the 1st 2 seasons in a week.  A ""Sopranos"" of the 1920's Probition era.  Characters are fleshed out without fail; script is unfailingly accurate as are the sets, costumes, locations.  Claims to be a fictionalized drama, but with a ton of accurate realism.

Reminds me of some independent film projects cast by casting agents from William Morris to Cannice.  I highly recommend this series and can guarantee you'll likely enjoy in marathon fashion.  It's up there with Sopranos and OZ. It takes place in Atlantic City and the early 1900s set dressings and authenticity is consistently fantastic.,1473465600,,466,5.025974025974026

Not a great deal of money, but it irritates me to no end that they have created a ""bait and switch"" by providing the first 4 seasons and then once you're into the series they spring the pay per view on you.

Well, let me just say that I was emphatically wrong. I was completely captivated and simply addicted; I ended up neglecting both my husband and children as a result.

4810611,2,B005LAJ1H2,"The show is overly violent for no apparent reason besides simple shock value. Do we really need to see one character beating a man's head in with a wrench with no cutaways? I guess that's just how HBO makes their shows ""edgy"". The characters are relatively wooden and the plot mostly easy to predict. The actors are good but the writing is pretty dull outside of the violence and sexual images. I hated the characters so much I just hoped they would all die each episode.

The clothing, language, cars, homes, and social lives appear to be spot on.  As a devotee of history and the 20's, in particular, this view of the Prohibition era is gritty, true to life, and hard to take, all at the same time.  My Grandfather was a bootlegger in Detroit. I shudder to think what he, my Grandmother, Dad and his siblings lived through-- and my Dad helped deliver booze at the age of 11!

Needless to say, we did not take this bait.  Having said that tho, really enjoyed the 4 seasons we did see.  Nice mix of history with fictional characters based on real ones.  Story revolves around the ""Nucky"" Thompson clan in Atlantic City and his dealings with mobsters from Philly, NY, and Chicago during Prohibition.  Violent, yes.  But enough humor interspersed to take that edge off a bit.  Really enjoyed to transformations of Van Allen character who starts out as a religious Prohibitions Agent then transforms over the next 4 seasons.  Again. violent but so funny!  Recommend this series for those that have the stomach for it.",1469404800,,832,4.722222222222222

A crime period drama, created by Terence Winter , so that right there should perk your interest. Also Mark Wahlberg is an executive producer and so is Martin Scorsese. Brilliant right!? The show is based on Atlanta City  during the start of Prohibition. Of course this is the birth of corruption in Atlantic City. The main mobster is Nucky Thompson, who is brilliantly played by Steve Buscemi. I was never a fan of his until this show. This is his best ever performance in my opinion. Another favorite character of mine named Chalky White played by Michael K Williams makes for a perfect cast ! This is a really strong series, the storytelling of the characters and dialogue holds my interest. I mean I binge watch it as much as I can. Evena young Al Capone's character is thrown in the mix. And as the character Margaret gets my heart played by Kelly MacDonald, that accent is to die for and her role as a young widow, mother and mistress....she is rather surprising in some episodes from the shy quiet field mouse to strong bold and rather daring. Enough said. Watch it. You won't be disappointed. Only disappointment I had was only 5 Seasons !",1468540800,,1424,4.5408560311284045

4814254,3,B005LAJ1H2,"Season 1 was an easy 5 stars for me.  In Season 2, the production value is still excellent and the acting is superb, but I don't believe the characters have stayed consistent.  In what seems like an attempt to create added dramatic tension and create more complicated characters, the show creators have instead taken away large parts of what made the characters so compelling in Season 1.  The worst victims of this are Nucky and Margaret.  The show also can't seem to decide the level of intelligence of Al Capone, alternating between mindless and calculating.  It is one thing to portray him as letting his temper get the better of him, but this goes further.",1466121600,,661,4.71304347826087

4814331,5,B005LAJ1H2,"I give the series as a whole 5 stars. It's dark and on occasion uncomfortable to watch, but I like that--because it doesn't glorify anything. It doesn't present a polished and romantic slant on the gangster life, or the time period, or anything else. The story and each layer of sub-story is gritty and raw, and sometimes extremely, darkly funny. No one is completely good or completely evil, so as a viewer, you remain as tormented and torn as the characters in the story. But damn, don't watch it if you're depressed. :D hahaa",1465948800,,528,4.627659574468085

I never really would have pictured  Steve Buscemi as fitting this part but to my surprise he plays it and plays it very well! He is one of those actors that has such an identifiable face and features, for him to pull you into the characters he plays and make you forget that he is anyone else other than the character, he has to be good. This series showcases some great talent. I put this series up very close to Deadwood just obviously a different time period. Highly recommend it!",1448064000,,619,4.576576576576577

I love the backdrop - the costumes, the old cars and the look of Atlantic City during Prohibition. The story definitely shows how good intentions can go horribly awry as more wine, beer and bourbon was poured because of Prohibition than prior to that legislation. Fortunes were made by criminals who were criminalized by the law. It is a violent story so be prepared for blood and gore.

I'm 81 years old, and while I was not around, during that time period, I do remember talking to folks who were.

4825814,4,B005LAJ1H2,"This season is moving along swiftly, but as it continues it is getting more and more disturbingly bloody and gory.
The sexual and blood and gore content is not suitable for younger people at all.

But the acting is superb and the story line is engaging. To me there are too many murders, but then I did not live during this prohibition era and have no connection with mafia/mobs/ etc.- so maybe it is just a true to life rendition of the era.",1438992000,,442,4.325301204819277

4825819,2,B005LAJ1H2,"The early seasons of Boardwalk Empire began with great promise and descended into the most violent film(s) I have ever seen. The main characters (all of them) were ignorant, superstitious, petty psychopaths bent on power and survival. I'm sure that this existed then as it does now but WHY does film celebrate the lowest common base element of an era as an example of the times when there were (are) also examples of courageous and compassionate people too? The hard slant toward depravity is a bias.",1438992000,,500,4.825581395348837

Although this kind of show - violent and bloody is not my thing, I find myself engrossed in the story.  Bobby Canavale is not an asset in season 3 - a strange and  particularly thuggish performance that stands out for thuggishness even amid the violence of the series - a very poor performance on his part.",1438992000,,416,4.447368421052632
