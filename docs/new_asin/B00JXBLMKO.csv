8654400,5,B00JXBLMKO,What happens when 3 friends who have no outstanding qualities or passions to speak of decide how to spend their time? A seemingly boring premise becomes very entertaining as the characters spend their first year of high school doing nothing in the most interesting ways they can think of.,1448755200,2,288,4.8979591836734695
8654401,5,B00JXBLMKO,"Yuru Yuri is my overall favorite, but Yuyushiki exceeds in the outright ridiculous humor department. There are a lot of puns and wordplay in this anime and a complete lack of any plot development, as with any truly great slice-of-life.",1428969600,4,235,4.9
8654402,5,B00JXBLMKO,This is a great show. It shows that high school can be fun and friends can be cool. Hopefully it will be a classic for the future.,1418342400,,130,3.8518518518518516
8654403,4,B00JXBLMKO,"The menus are easy to navigate, and the whole show is neatly packed on one disc. The menu isn't animated, but the background they chose is appealing and fits perfectly with the music, which is Yuyushiki's OP, ""Seeno"". All 12 episode titles are neatly arranged on one page.

There ARE some issues. Some jokes are lost in translation so badly that they're confusing even in English, but this only affects a handful of lines noticeably. And there's a blatant typo on the main menu where Yukari's name is spelled ""Tukari"".

The physical product met expectations. But there's also the obvious carelessness with the menu, plus the lack of the NyaNyaShiki specials (granted, you're only missing 10 minutes of content that isn't as good as the core show)... A 4/10 release for a 10/10 anime, so I'm going with 4/5 stars.

If you're still deciding, stream it. If you like it and don't mind the issues with this release, buy this (I did). If you don't want to deal with the issues this set has, buying the Japanese BD box on Japanese Amazon is the best way to support the show. (I have that, too. The Japanese site ships internationally, but the JP version does NOT have subtitles.)",1418342400,2,1172,4.6521739130434785
