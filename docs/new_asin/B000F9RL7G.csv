8119215,3,B000F9RL7G,Renegade Girl is a unique western due to its tough woman main character. Ann Savage and an outstanding cast keep this b- level production surprisingly watchable. Cannot say anything positive about The Great Jesse James Raid- it is a stinker.,1441584000,,241,5.05

8119217,3,B000F9RL7G,"Entertaining enough, but ""Raid"" merely uses Jesse and various people that were associated with him as raw material for a B-western. The film has very, very little to do with the exploits of the real Jesse James; it's entirely fiction. As an example, ""Elias Hobbs"" was in actuality not a dynamite man but the town marshal of Northfield, Minnesota, during the James gang attempted bank robbery there. Out of ammunition, he threw rocks at Jesse and his buddies. Arch Clement was killed shortly after the Civil War and had been dead for some time when Jesse was going under the name of Howard. Quibbling, I guess. This gem is never shown on the History Channel.",1193788800,,657,4.721739130434782
8119218,4,B000F9RL7G,"Both movies on this DVD are not without merits. The Great Jesse James Raid is a classic heist movie in the manner of Rififi or Asphalt Jungle, which just happens to be a Western as well. The heist scheme is unusual, the gangsters want to reach gold stashed for transport in a mine by blasting a tunnel from another unused mineshaft. There is a lot of action and 50ies sexpot Barbara Peyton is not wasted on this one. She slaps the men and the men slap her in turn. The garish colors of the filmstock enhance a general atmosphere of despair and doom.

Another resolute woman of Hollywood's poverty row stars in Renegade Girl. Anne Savage (Detour) plays the daughter of a family who support rebels fighting against Union troops after the Civil War. She falls in love and finds cause to question her motives. Anne Savage was an excellent actress who never had a breakthrough, I cannot find fault in her performance. And she was a hell of a horsewoman too, apparently even doing the stunts (including falling of the horse) herself. I tip my hat to her.",1171238400,6,1048,4.544973544973545
8119219,5,B000F9RL7G,"I heartily second ""Mr. Jim's"" comprehensive review of Legendary Outlaws, vol. I...two fine films, the kind one used to see on the Saturday matinees, or perhaps late at night. VCI has done its usual great job in this release. Both this volume and volumes II and III are highly recommended.",1159315200,3,288,4.78
