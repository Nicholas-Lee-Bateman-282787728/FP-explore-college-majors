8559163,5,B00AYCM46W,"I bought this Last year,watched it and made notes.  First off let me say , if you plan to buy this product ,buy the Blu-Ray.  Japanese Blu-rays play on American Blu-Ray players ,if you buy the dvds those will only play in Japan [or maybe on your computer]  Do Double check this[ i looked at a chart that explained the different ""Zones"" for Dvds and Blurays [ if Amazon doesn't have this chart Google it ]  There are 4 Discs and this is what's on them.  Alll 4 Discs have a ""Play all "" button  a Photo Gallery Button and a Tour of the new Tokyo Disneyland Hotel.

  As i said before each disc has a Photo Gallery [ with a Gazillion Photos ] i believe they are grouped by year [ it's very hard to tell because all chapter commands are in Japanese ,you'll have to play with it ]  And Lastly each Disc has a Chapter Devoted to the New Tokyo Disneyland Hotel .  Again everything is in Japanese ,but here is the rundown..................................

  Tokyo Disneyland Hotel

  The Lobby

  Sherwood Garden Restaraunt

  Disney Mercantile Store

  The Pool

  Outside the Hotel at Night  [ Just Beautiful ]

  The Suite[s]  The Decor seems to be very ""Turn of the Century"" American with Disney Touches .  The Rooms seem to fit a Family of 4.  There was 2 Beds + an Alcove Bed ,there also was an ""Inflatable "" Bed next to the Beds.  And the Last stop on our Tour is......

  Canna  Restaraunt

  Whew!  To all those who have wanted to purchase this Box Set ,i hope this helps .  It would be better to buy this Box set than to purchase the individual Blu-Rays . I think Pretty much everything on those Single Discs is in this Box Set, but it's hard to tell since i don't read Japanese .  If By any chance i have made any mistakes [approx. Times  ,Languages etx.]  I hope you will forgive me
  Good Luck  LA",1432857600,,6511,4.898385565052232
