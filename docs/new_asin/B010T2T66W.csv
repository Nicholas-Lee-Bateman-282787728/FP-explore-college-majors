7316520,5,B010T2T66W,"Season one was good, but season two was OUTSTANDING.  The addition of Wes Studi was fantastic.  I am praying for a graphic novel - like they do for when the characters were younger - to wrap up the cliffhangers.",1446595200,4,211,4.384615384615385

7316524,5,B010T2T66W,"SPOILER ALERT---I LOVE this show and was really bummed when I heard it was canceled. This show is intelligently written with continually good character development--things you don't see on many tv shows these days and those shows stay on for years. Go figure. There are so many story lines to use in one or two more seasons but more importantly, they have to make a season 3 or even a tv movie so viewers can see whether Junior and Marie live or die!!?? Will Phillip finally get a break that lasts? And more importantly I just want to see more Jason Momoa on tv again--in addition to the movies! Come on SundanceTV!!",1444003200,8,616,4.508928571428571

Strong characters that were developing, and friendships and relationships that were forming.",1464220800,3,272,4.934782608695652

8723134,5,B010T2T66W,It is a great series.  It tells it like it is. I just don't like what happened to my people.  Being Native American not all that is cracked up to be and this proves it every one think we have it easy. So not true.,1518134400,,213,3.7111111111111112
8723135,3,B010T2T66W,"Poor Julianne Nicholson hears voices. That is almost impossible these days
because TV is always on. One hears voices all the time but they are those sent by
the TV channels.
Julianne Nicholson deserved a better script.",1497139200,,218,4.918918918918919
