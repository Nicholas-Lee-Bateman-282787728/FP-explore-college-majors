8097477,4,B000CCSAHG,The quality is good and the resolution of the colour is OK given the time of actions which go back to the 80's,1365033600,,110,3.8260869565217392
8097478,5,B000CCSAHG,"I really enjoyed watching this DVD. Contrary to other videos, this one focuses on the true character of Maradona. Behind  his controversial life lies a very simple innocent character. Diego talks frankly about all of the highs and lows of his tumultuous life. I highly recommend this video to all of diego's fan.",1291248000,2,312,4.886792452830188
