I am not a drummer and but only purchased this DVD for the live performances, however, I listen to alot of music and learned much about drumming theory and the different styles and how drum parts are created. It is all done with a sense of humor mixed in with the lessons and there is even a short spot with a David Letterman drumming tutorial - who knew Dave could drum too!!

Most importantly though, this DVD is a rare video record of the South African trio Skollie (Blondie Chaplin, keith Lentin and Anton Fig) performing live. The DVD includes three songs throughout - One song (Law and Order) from the 1992 Ostrich Man album and two other songs which remain unreleased (Cool Cool Day & 1-2-3). All three songs are great straight forward hard rock songs, no ballads here!!

The performances were filmed professionally with multiple cameras and are of excellent sound quality. Blondie Chaplin contributes his usual outstanding vocal talent and some crankin' guitar solos. Ketih lays a thick bass line and smooth backing vocals and Anton Fig pounds away with his usual great 'feel' and shines on the extended drum solos.

For the Skollie or Blondie Chaplin fan, let me say your collection is far from complete without these rare live performances. The trio Skollie was a class act with great energy, astute professionalism and powerful riffs. These guys are all three master musicians.

This DVD is a must have for these performances!!!",1275091200,2,1575,4.754578754578755

With the addition of other musicians to play along with, Anton demonstrates how to play the drums with the correct feeling as well as the correct beat for the music being performed.  A step above the usual ""I will show you how to play this beat"" dvds.  For beginners to the advanced drummers, there is something for everyone to learn from this dvd.  Highly recomended.",1260835200,2,518,4.65934065934066
