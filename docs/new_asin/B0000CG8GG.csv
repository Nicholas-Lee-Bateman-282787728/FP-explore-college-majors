7999298,1,B0000CG8GG,"This is the worst thing I've ever watched.  It has no plot, no real actors, nothing but sex.  This is horrificc",1365379200,,111,4.238095238095238
7999299,1,B0000CG8GG,"I rented this from a local rental store called ""videoscene"" it was sitting next to the regular movies. I mean no adult section nothing! Just sitting there right on the shelf next to the other action movies. I'm heavy into racing and cars, and picked this up because I thought it was a real movie. This was nothing but some long made for TV late night cinemax porno. As far as a soft core porno goes it rarely needs a real story or a logical plot. This one obviously had neither. The girls looked good better than looking at those boring cars.",1238889600,,542,4.323529411764706
7999300,3,B0000CG8GG,"Soft porn movie at best. It try to be a lower version of the Fast and the Furious. The overall plotline is not existent. The actor do a good job with the material they have to act on. I would recommend this movie if you like hot chicks, fast cars, and adult situations.",1168300800,,269,4.09433962264151
7999301,4,B0000CG8GG,Not as Hot as Fast lane but still recommended. 2 of the girl are a little flat from up. there is no girl/girl action. they try hard to have a story and action but I still use the fast forward.,1164153600,,192,3.825
7999302,4,B0000CG8GG,"Thrust is a good, recent softcore offering from Playboy/Image. It's not going to go down as a classic by any stretch of the imagination, but it does deliver satisfying helpings of cheesecake and sex. The story was good enough to keep me away from the fast forward button. Not because it was particularly good, but because it was bad in the right way. This movie was made to be watched in MST3K mode.

The movie actually looks pretty good. It's one of the few softcore offerings filmed in 16x9 anamorphic widescreen. There's also a 4x3 version on the disc, but it chops off the sides of the picture and has that ""zoomed in"" look to it. The car racing scenes are pretty good. They're not as exciting as anything you'd see in something like The Fast and The Furious, but they do look realistic.

But enough of that. There are eight sex scenes. All are boy/girl and all are good. But none are what I'd call spectacular. There are four women who participate in the sex scenes. All of them are attractive and give good performances. The sounds of the actors are always audible over the background music and all the sex scenes play out to completion.

I recommend it.",1102896000,8,1160,4.514285714285714
