829042,4,6304286619,"OK, it's not the best Randolph Scott film out there, though he does what he can with the limited script, but it is enjoyable in a mid-40s kinda way. Good, clean fun. No deep meanings. But largely entertaining. Add the one and only Gypsy Rose Lee, a surprisingly youthful Dinah Shore, and some very good show-stopping songs in a western setting and you have the makings of a great little popcorn entertainment. Enjoy it it for what it is.

The 1944 film is presented in its original 4:3 aspect ratio. This Technicolor feature could use some restorative burnishment to bring out its full potential. Probably won't happen -- but I wish it would. It deserves to be refurbished onto Blu-ray. That being said, it looks pretty good on DVD for a 1944 production. 3.5 stars.",1410307200,,765,4.666666666666667
829043,4,6304286619,"If you've seen one of the musical versions of ""Gypsy"" or just heard about the famous 'ecdesiast' (stripper), this is a treat. Gypsy plays the lead of a female performing troupe in a Yukon settlement during the 1800's Alaskan gold rush. The town is chock-full of shady characters and part of the fun is finding out who's in cahoots with whom--and who will get away with flim-flamming everyone else. A very young Dinah Shore is also featured as the only purely innocent in town, and her character incredibly manages to stay that way. Lots of old fashioned humor, romance and great costumes that leave no doubt as to where the expression 'hourglass figure' came from. No wonder ladies used to faint so easily!  Gypsy is fascinating. She used a lot of patter (stage talk) as part of her act, and she enunciated every word as if she were dictating a dictionary. This entertained her audience and kept them patiently waiting for her to reveal a little more, which of course she was famous for NOT doing. A fun movie and historically significant.",1388793600,3,1039,4.708791208791209
829044,3,6304286619,"I like a lot of movies from the 1930s and 40s but this is not one of them. I really tried to watch the entire thing but quit about halfway. Plenty of humor, which I liked, but in the end, I found this Technicolor movie very tedious. And the characters, while not unlikeable, were kind of meh.",1371168000,,292,4.140350877192983
829045,1,6304286619,"Very poor quality of reproduction. No remaster or product enhancement, just like the manufacturer of the dvd took an old copy of film and transferred to dvd",1354233600,,156,4.814814814814815
829046,3,6304286619,"Greetings All, I was disapointed with this copy, not so sharp and sound was ok. If you love Dinah Shore, then the movie is a must! Not to many movies with Gypsy Rose Lee and just wish her part was better. Cheers! William",1348617600,2,220,4.1395348837209305
829047,3,6304286619,"Even the charming presence of Dinah Shore and Gypsy Rose Lee can't completely save this strange musical, which plays like a poor man's ""Calamity Jane"" mixed with ""The Harvey Girls"".

BELLE OF THE YUKON, set during the bustling days of the Canadian goldrush, stars Randolph Scott as ""Honest John"" Calhoun, a con-artist on the run from the authorities who decides to establish a bank and then abscond with the profits.  Legendary striptease star Gypsy Rose Lee is Belle De Valle, Calhoun's former love who makes a splash as the town's new music hall star.  A subplot features the comical misadventures of saloon manager Pop Candless (Charles Winninger) and his efforts to stop daughter Lettie (Dinah Shore) from marrying a man he believes to be a bigamist.

Filled with songs by Jimmy Van Heusen and Johnny Burke (including ""Like Someone in Love"" and ""A Sleighride in July""), and filmed in blazing Technicolor, BELLE OF THE YUKON will be a welcome treat for musical fans; the early performance of Dinah Shore (costumed and wigged to resemble Judy Garland from ""The Harvey Girls"") is a real highlight, and seeing Gypsy Rose Lee is great too.

829048,3,6304286619,"Not too many people know that Gypsy Rose Lee, who virtually invented modern striptease, also essayed a career as an actress; ""Belle of the Yukon"" is one of the few examples.  It's a pleasant, if middling, Western comedy where you can also see Dinah Shore, another personality known for her achievements in other fields than the silver screen.  Gypsy Rose doesn't strip, which may disappoint some people.",1104278400,2,403,5.0
829049,4,6304286619,"Yes, its a lightweight film.  Its also a great chance to see some rare footage of Gypsy Rose Lee's short film career.  Randolf Scott (a handsome matinee idol in his day) is a strong veteran actor and plays his contrived role to the hilt.  Don't expect plot; just enjoy the rich visual experience of this vacuous film-as-entertainment novelty feature.",982800000,16,350,4.898305084745763

7866821,2,6304286619,It was fun seeing Gypsy Rose Lee but that's about it. Randolph Scott looks older than his years and Dinah Shore really doesn't cut it as a soubrette. I barely stuck with the movie until the end.,1429315200,3,194,4.27027027027027
