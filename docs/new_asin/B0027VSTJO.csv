3869879,5,B0027VSTJO,"I love Animaniacs; i have volumes 1-3, and i'm waiting desperately for this to come out before i go to college! I haven't even seen this stuff yet, but based off of the previous volumes, i'm giving this a full 5 stars. Anybody have any information as to when this should be out?",1245974400,2,278,4.264150943396227
3869880,5,B0027VSTJO,"Animaniacs is arguably the best cartoon TV show of the 90s created by WB. The level of depth of this project is incredible - despite being a cartoon show originally oriented towards kids and teenagers, it's drawn to well and it contains such a great amount of smart, witty jokes, and cultural references that it's interesting and funny to watch for people of all ages. Steven Spielberg's Animaniacs is a masterpiece that deserves a place in the hall of fame of the greatest cartoons of all time. I was happy to buy all the previously released sets of Animaniacs (DVD volumes 1-3) because this show is an eternal classic that all my family finds interesting to watch, and I definitely want my children to grow up on cartoon shows like this. However, I got really frustrated to see that the last, fourth volume got delayed further, and further, and further, while other WB shows of the 90s (unquestionably excellent, but in my opinion still not this great!) got released and even completed (e.g. Pinky and the Brain and Freakazoid). I keep looking for updates on Volume 4 practically daily and the day when it's finally announced and when I'm going to be able to hit the ""Pre-order"" button here on Amazon and know that the final episodes of my favorite series of all time is going to be released will definitely make me a very happy man, and I'm sure that I'm not the only one on the planet dying to get the last set of Animaniacs.

Animaniacs Volume 4, when and if released, will contain the final 24 episodes of the show (76-99) and will include such masterpieces as ""Hurray for North Hollywood"" (in two parts), ""The Animaniacs Suite"", ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Clock"", and much more.

Animaniacs is the show that deserves to be completed in the form of a DVD release. If you are reading this and you like cartoons, comedy, and parody, but you still haven't gotten Animaniacs volumes 1-3, I highly recommend that you get them because it's one of those shows you'll never regret buying. And if you already have volumes 1-3, definitely consider getting volume 4 once Warner Bros. finally decides to release it!",1244851200,37,2110,4.669354838709677

3869907,3,B0027VSTJO,Five stars for the puns and the laughs. One star for the dumbed down case and cover art. Volumes 1 to 3 were in beautiful card slipcases. Volume 4 comes in a plain plastic Amaray case. And then there's the really low quality 2.0 Dolby audio on the discs. What happened to the 5.1 sound? In the words of the Warner Brothers AND the Warner Sister....BORING!,1420243200,,355,4.393939393939394

3869917,5,B0027VSTJO,"A must see for WB cartoon fans - sadly I never saw these in their original run in the mid-90's, but glad to get them on DVD now so I can enjoy them.
Sure, kids can watch them, but adults are really the ones who are going to understand the running commentary on politics (still true today), awards shows, the entertainment industry, and all the gags in the credits.
Very worth having in your collection!",1404604800,,402,4.373333333333333

3869919,3,B0027VSTJO,"This is not the same as watching the TV show.  The quality is not nearly as good.  There's some weird pan and scan actions and it's out of focus sometimes.  Odd.  Also it's not a full ""episode.""  All the songs that introduce the different character's episodes are missing as are all the little shorts like ""Mime Time,"" ""Timmy,"" etc.  The first DVD was almost entirely Yakko, Wakko & Dot episodes.  I miss the variety a full episode provides.  Finally, there is no ""Pinky and the Brain.""  I'm guessing they had begun their own spin off by this time.",1398124800,,548,4.510204081632653
3869920,5,B0027VSTJO,"Best animated show ever! My students love the educational songs, my young nieces love the show in general.

3869922,5,B0027VSTJO,Bought this to complete the set. I missed watching all the cartoons I grew up with so bought the Animaniacs. There are plenty of things in here that I did not catch when I first watched these episodes as a kid. Now grown up I'm still enjoying the show and I love catching all the little things that flew over my head as a child.,1394323200,,328,4.061538461538461
3869923,5,B0027VSTJO,"Purchased this collection for my son (yeah right) It's a show i can sit and watch with him. The best contribution Warner Bros has made to animation since the original Looney Tunes.  Some of the familiar participants made it to their own shows (Pinky and the Brain), while others are just found here. The whole cast of crazies Slappy Squirrel, the Good Feathers and Rita and Runt as well as Good Idea/Bad Idea made afternoon cartoons in the 80's fun. The sets are boxed well and closed captioned...packed for safety I would recommend them to anyone who remembers the  show (and if you don't you should get them and laugh for the first time now).",1392076800,2,644,4.591304347826087

3869930,5,B0027VSTJO,"Animaniacs Volumes 1-3 came out years ago, but this Volume 4 set took a while to finally be released.  The packaging matches as best it can, but is just a standard DVD case, not the cardboard sleeves in the previous volumes.  Great episodes on here, so thank you to Warner Brothers for finally realizing they forgot to release this set.",1383350400,,336,4.583333333333333
3869931,4,B0027VSTJO,"It is great to have the final run of episodes for this great series, just wish WB would have put more effort into the last volume. 1-3 have better packaging, extras, fun. This in comparison is bland and meh. Goes out with a wimper, not the bang it deserves. It should also come with ""wakko's Wish"" as a fourth disc, but does not.",1381795200,,329,4.238095238095238
3869932,3,B0027VSTJO,"The picture quality is very grainy on my player. I changed the quality then it looked blurry. However, you will laugh your head off, if you remember this series. There's even an inside joke that's not for kids. So be careful.",1381017600,,225,4.512195121951219

3869934,4,B0027VSTJO,All of the Animaniacs sets up to this one have been great. This one looks like they ran out of the funniest writers.,1378512000,,116,4.086956521739131
3869935,5,B0027VSTJO,"When I was in middle school and high school, this was my favorite cartoon, and I never missed it.  I'm now in my thirties, and I was still so excited when they released Volume 4 of Animaniacs. The show's last couple of seasons contained some of my favorite episodes, such as ""This Pun For Hire"", ""The Sound of Warners"", and ""Star Truck"", among others. This show is still as fresh and funny as it was in the 90s. I enjoyed every minute of it.",1377388800,,441,4.25
3869936,4,B0027VSTJO,"I would give this volume five stars for the episodes alone. But I have run into a problem that many others have.

Episodes 90 thru 97 and 99 have a serious audio problem that chops off the right channel and leaves the left in a very tinny center only mix.

In other words the 'Macadamia Nut' and the 'Animaniacs Suite', two of the best musical moments I have enjoyed on the show, you cannot hear in their proper aural brilliance. Plus a few wonderful shorts like 'Bully For Skippy' and 'Back In Style'.

I was hoping this set would make those numbers less rare, but in fact have doubled these song's rarity.

Now for the episodes alone, I would give this set a sure-fire five to ten stars! Animaniacs is just that good, and we should all have the chance to see it's amazing four-part collection of 99 half-hour shows anytime we please.

But Warner Bros. really must fix this problem. I will gladly buy another set if this problem is fixed, just to hear those two pieces of music in the format they were made to be in.",1375574400,7,1017,4.35978835978836
3869937,3,B0027VSTJO,"Like vol 1-3, this is not restored. Looks just ok on a modern TV, scratches and specs on the film are somewhat disrupting.the opening credits a especially blurry and off putting.

The content is as awesome as I remember it, but the presentation is disappointing.",1375228800,,262,4.822222222222222
3869938,1,B0027VSTJO,"This score is not a reflection of the episodes themselves, as I have not watched many episodes to judge. I score based on some troubling audio issues I have found with many of the episodes on this set.

First of all, where the prior three sets have 5.1 surround audio masters, as in five separate channels of sound, the fourth volume is only in stereo sound, AKA only two. This in itself is regrettable, but the problems only escalate.

Episodes 90 through 97 and 99 are all in bare-bones MONOPHONIC audio, as in only ONE channel of sound. Think that's not so bad? Well, not only that, but by examining past VHS copies of these episodes, it seems that some if not all of these mono channels use only one half of the stereo track.

For example, in the episode Macadamia Nut, the audio from the left channel is also used on the right, so that Wakko is on the left and Yakko on the right, you will hardly hear Yakko at all. The correct mixing is used on the VHS copy, which is how this issue was identified.

Therefore, I would advise anyone who has yet to purchase to refrain until the issues are clarified and hopefully resolved.",1373760000,11,1128,4.382775119617225
3869939,4,B0027VSTJO,"This TV series really ought to be marketed for the adults, because so much of the humor is in reference to politics, social issues, and the absurdity of things we value in our culture. It is a fun tongue in cheek poke at all we take way too seriously, and throws us our own twisted views back in our faces. I really enjoy the humor, the inference, and the out right disregard for all we think is so important (that really shouldn't be important at all).",1373241600,,453,4.27906976744186
3869940,3,B0027VSTJO,"The first three volumes of Animaniacs were a joy to watch, however this final fourth volume feels ponderous and slow. These final episodes feel more like children's television, and lack the complexity which made the earlier episodes appeal to children, teens,and adults. Most of the skits feel tired, and worn out.

Despite the issues with most of the volume, there are a few episodes which will remind viewers of the show's earlier genius. These include episodes such as episode #82 a series of musical skits, two parodies poking fun at Disney's 80's-90's films in episodes #84 and #85, episode #92's satire of Federal television regulation, and episode #94's swan-song for Pinky and the Brain. A few other episode stand out, but are not worth listing.

Unfortunately the few great episodes don't hide the problems with the rest. Show highlights such as Slappy Squirrel, Pinky and the Brain, and sometimes even the Warner Brothers seem to be playing second string to less humorous acts such as Mindy and Buttons, Chicken Boo, The Hip Hippos, and Katie Ka-Boom. Other episodes date themselves terribly into the 1990's. The animation quality seems to have been lowered, and many characters often appear off-model, on all to many occasions. This feeling of decreased quality comes to a head while watching the final episode #99; where it soon becomes obvious most of the highlights shown from previous episodes came from the earlier seasons, and not the episodes collected on Volume 4.

To add insult to injury, Warner Brothers has not included any DVD extra's, make this final release feel like a bare bones afterthought; meant to cash in on the series reruns on The Hub.

If you enjoyed the previous 3 volumes, I would recommend getting this one just to finish the collection; however be warned watching this volume feels like a chore. If you are new to Animaniacs, skip this one and go straight to the older volumes instead. The Animaniac's early genius was lost in these latter episodes.",1372723200,5,1989,4.963963963963964

3869954,5,B0027VSTJO,"Animaniacs, to put it shortly, is one of the funniest and wittiest animated comedy/parody series of the 90s. The final, fourth volume was on hiatus for about six years or so, and now it's finally released and available for purchase, which was an event highly expected by the fans of the series worldwide. This final volume features the episodes from the dawn of the era of Animaniacs (24 episodes numbered 76-99), and despite the fact that Animaniacs was on the decline, every single episode in this volume is worth watching! A real treat for all the fans and a worthy buy for every collector of animation out there!",1362960000,,616,4.712962962962963

3869956,3,B0027VSTJO,"This is a collection of the last episodes of the series and is definitely the weakest of the four collections.  The early episodes were funny with cute stories.  These seem to be made from scripts that were just lying around and they have little life or fun in them.  A couple are okay but none of the episodes on the third disk are, in my opinion, anywhere close to the quality of the earlier cartoons.  A couple were so boring that I quit them about half way through.  If you are a dedicated Animaniacs fan and want the full collection, then you may like these.  Frankly, I was disappointed.",1362441600,4,593,4.394495412844036
3869957,5,B0027VSTJO,"I was so glad to hear that Warner Bros. was finally releasing the last volume of this amazing show. especially because of the fact that most of the episodes from the final season were some I had never seen before. This volume once again pokes fun at pop culture, elates your senses with classic cartoon comedy and as always has you walking away feeling a little smarter.

Some of the highlights in this volume include 'Wakko At The Bat', 'The Macadamia Nut', 'When You're Traveling from Nantuket to St. Paul' and probably the most heartfelt and surprisingly dramatic 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo Clock'. Of course my personal surprise was the return of Pinky & The Brain in the ingenious  'The Brain's Apprentice' Taking the classic piece from the 1940s Disney classic and making it an Animaniacs' own.

This is a must have for collection completion, but if this is a show that you remember from your youth this may be one of the most important shows out there to purchase and share with the generations that follow us. I plan to show this fantastic show to my children whenever they come. I want them to know the true meaning of quality children's programming and then have them grow up discovering that is it quality for adults as well.",1362182400,5,1235,4.63013698630137

Everyone has their favorites and - Faboo - I love the 'Macadamia Nut' episode.  A true musical classic! Seems hard to believe that the final Episode 99 came out in autumn 1998, almost 15 years ago!  My ONLY disappointment, and a # 4 rating, is that there were no bonus features.  How cool it would have been to include ""Wacko's Wish"" on the bonus disc as that was the true end to the series.  It would have been a great bonus and a nice reward for us dedicated Animaniac fans who have been waiting these many years for Volume 4.",1361577600,2,659,4.413223140495868

3869960,5,B0027VSTJO,I bought the first three sets when they first dropped over 6 years ago. I lamented that they were never going to release the final set (a decision I still don't understand). But it's finally here!!!  Did Warner Bros finally grow a brain???,1360972800,,239,4.558139534883721
3869961,4,B0027VSTJO,"Like a lot of people, I've been waiting for the final volume of Anamaniacs to be released. I never got to see the show when it was actually on the air, but have owned the first 3 volumes for quite a few years now, and thoroughly enjoyed them. I also have all 3 volumes of Pinky and the Brain, and I'd say I like them even more, if possible. So, I was really excited when this final volume was released and preordered it as soon as amazon would let me. I just finished watching the last 24 episodes, and on the whole, they were good, but I still felt a little let down. The reason being that on disc 3, there were 2 cartoons which had absolutely no dialogue. This is a huge problem for me because I'm totally blind, so rely on dialogue to know what's going on. Part of what I love most about Anamaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, etc. is the witty dialogue that has many laugh-out-loud lines. So, to have 2 cartoons, 1 of which was the final cartoon of the series, which had absolutely no dialogue was a bit of a letdown. Also, I don't know if the problem was with my hearing or these dvds, but there seemed to be lower quality audio on this set than on previous sets. Very difficult to explain, and as I am currently battling some hearing difficulties, I am hesitant to blaim these dvds. So, on the whole, I'm very satisfied with my purchase, but it seems that it was good for the series to end when it did.",1360713600,,1402,4.177121771217712
3869962,5,B0027VSTJO,"I grew up watching ""Animaniacs"", along with the classic Warner Bros. cartoons that inspired it. I liked the series back then, as well as the other series of the ""Silver Age"" of Warner Bros. animation helmed by Steven Spielberg. But unlike the classic Looney Tunes, I was never compelled to see EVERY episode. That was until it came out on DVD years later.

Warner Home Video released the first 3 quarters of the series to DVD several years ago, and, viewing it through an adult point of view, I was shocked, enthralled and impressed by the humor that had gone over my head as a kid. Watching the show in chronological order, I noticed that it got better as it went along...the characters were honed, the fully orchestrated music remained brilliant, the voice actors pushed the limit further and further, and the writers didn't just push the envelope, they hit it with a big wooden mallet and dropped an anvil on it. This was a zany, hilarious sketch comedy show for adults that just happened to be animated, and it was cleverly disguised as a ""kid's show"".

A few years passed, and I figured the final episodes would never again see the light of day on DVD. I figured the hold-up was poor sales, or music rights, or other legal issues. But somehow, the final volume has finally been let out of the water tower. And WOW, these final episodes are MASTERPIECES.

Content-wise, we have the titular characters, the Animaniacs (aka ""the Warner Brothers and Warner Sister"", Yakko, Wakko, and Dot), picking up where they left off...tormenting people with their mischief. The two lab mice, Pinky and the Brain, still try to take over the world. The hapless dog, Buttons, still protects baby Mindy from danger, only to have everything blamed on him by Mindy's overbearing mother. Aging cartoon star Slappy Squirrel is still a smart ass, and her nephew, Skippy, is still learning. Ralph, the Warner Bros. studio guard, is still an idiot. But we see some refreshing new twists on the formulas here. The Warners heckle explorer Magellan (in a brilliant 3-part harmony musical performance)as well as rip on Rush Limbaugh in the end credits. They borderline molest the shapely ""Hello Nurse"". They satirize Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"". Greek hero Hercules is portrayed as a simpering, whiney crybaby. Pinky meets his mental equal when conversing with Ralph the Guard. Buttons chases Mindy into a graveyard full of zombies. The whole gang does a hysterical parody of the 1990's Latin dance craze ""Macarena"" (as ""Macadamia Nuts"".) Slappy and Skippy explore the problem of bullying in a cartoon that is more relevant today than it was then.

I won't give anything else away, because I don't want to spoil anything for you. But I had never seen most of these later episodes, and experiencing them for the first time, at age 29, was a joy. It's also a shame to realize that it's a joy my future children may never have the chance to experience. The very existence of ""Animaniacs"", sadly, ensured that nothing like it would ever happen again. You can see that happening in these final episodes. The censors and TV executives from Fox and the WB Network pushed creative geniuses like Tom Ruegger, Paul Rugg, Sherri Stoner, Randy Rogel, Rob Paulsen, Maurice LaMarche, Frank Welker, Richard Stone, (and the list goes on) to be more P.C. and more educational. The creators pushed BACK. Sadly, they lost...but before they did, they were able to unleash some of the funniest and smartest cartoon humor ever made.

If you're reading this review, you know the characters, you know the show, you know a little about its history. But you may not have seen a few of these episodes, and if you haven't, be prepared to consider some of them your new favorites, and see how the series went out on a high note.

""Animaniacs"" quit (or was forced to quit) while it was ahead...and it was so far ahead that it's still waiting for others to catch up, even 15 years later.

Those are the facts!",1360713600,50,3956,4.749636098981077

To be honest I've seen better quality in some of the stuff I get in Chinatown for 99 cents.

3869966,5,B0027VSTJO,"Do you know how long - HOW LONG ?!?! - I've been waiting for this ?! I'd say five or six years tops, but hey, it's better late than never. The groundbreaking animated series ""Animaniacs"" is now available on a brand-new 3-disc DVD set featuring the last 24 episodes starring the lovable and troublesome trio, the Warner Siblings. If you've just got to know them recently, that's Yakko - the smooth and quick talker, Wakko - his crazy and voracious younger brother, and Dot - their little sister who's obviously cute, and maybe a bit overly dramatic.

Whether they're out on a loan-out for other cartoon studios or starring in their own versions of hit musicals or animated classics, you can bet that the Warner Brothers and the Warner Sister will bring out the funny in every episode. But don't think that the trio could have done it all themselves; they couldn't have done it better without their sensational supporting cast. Yes, the Animaniacs themselves are all funny friends whether they're furry (such as Slappy Squirrel and Rita and Runt), feathered (like Chicken Boo and the Goodfeathers), fat (i.e. The Hip Hippos and Ralph T. Guard), or even flirtatious (case in point, Hello Nurse and Minerva Mink). From bizarre world domination plots from Pinky and the Brain to Buttons the Dog chasing the curious Mindy into strange yet familiar lands, these guys know that they've got their work cut out for them.

So that's the fourth and sadly final DVD volume of the series we've all grown to love. And I suppose the only thing left to put on DVD is the direct-to-VHS movie ""Wakko's Wish"", which I hope is soon. But here's some great news: the classic series has found a brand-new home on The Hub channel ! (That's like, what, the fourth or fifth network they've been shown on, but still, check your local listings.)

My last word on this series is that the humor is kooky, original, and a pinch suggestive, which is what makes this cartoon quite the award-winning hit. And who knows ? They could make a comeback with a totally all-new series with more spoofs, gags, and the like. So until then, ""Good night, everybody !"" and ""Okay, I love you, bye-bye !""",1360108800,,2155,4.680738786279683

The Warner's making very candid and unflatting comments about the people scrolling by during the closing credits...until they realize the mic is still on...OH OH!!

4) No sense why a three-year-plus break between volumes 3 and 4, while the first three were roughly six months apart.
5) Releasing it will make WB execs look less like idiots.
6) I have many (not all) Animaniacs songs in my music library, and the songs ""Multiplication"" (Yakko multiplies numbers), ""Cheese Roll Call"" (Pinky sings about cheeses from around the world), ""Wakko's Two Note Song"" (Wakko defends two-note-only music), and ""At the Big Wrap Party Tonight"" (Numerous Animaniacs characters at a food party) have incomplete enjoyment.

Bring on the zany comedians, I can't get by on Marx Bros. classics and Mash reruns forever here! Help us Yakko, Wakko, and Dot!",1268092800,,398,4.115384615384615
3869992,5,B0027VSTJO,"Animaniacs was and IS a cartoon that has an incredible amount of genious minded individuals behind it.  Rob Paulsen (Raphael from the Turtles series) plays numerous characters including Pinky, as well as one of the lead characters, Yakko.  Tress MacNeille is the cute and adorable Dot, and also has a variety of other voices.  (just think back to when she was voicing Babs Bunny on Tiny Toons, she was not only Babs but like another 30 voices that Tress had to inpersonate through Babs).  Jess Harnell was a little more less known compared to the other 2 lead roles, but he did a fantastic job none the less.  Plus you've got Maurice LaMarche as Brain (and Wakko's burps!) and there were others as well, including the 3 sons of one of the producers, I believe his name was Tom Ruegger.  And this is all powered by Steven Speilberg, I mean HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

Speilberg looked in on every single script, and wrote several of them as well, and he went to the scoring and voicing segements often, he was very hands on and Im pretty sure no one can deny the fact that he is a major power house director in hollywood, he just has that special something when he visualizes the direction of a movie and in his animated series as well. Essentially what Michael Jackson did to music, Speilberg does as a director.

AND IT IS TIME TO RELEASE THE FINAL VOLUME OF THIS AMAZING SERIES, PLEEEEEEEEEEEASE!!!!  I mean it was I believe 17 out of 100 as the best, most outstanding animated series of all time... how can it be denied their final DVD set? IT CANT!!! RELEASE IT ALREADY!!!!!!!!!",1266278400,3,1592,4.637010676156583
3869993,5,B0027VSTJO,"I think the main reason vol 4 has not released
because no one has metioned it.
Is because of poor sales of vol 2 & 3.
private sellers that sell here are selling vol 2 brand starting at $5.00
and vol 3 starting out at $8.00 I got vol 2 at big lots,
for $6.00 over the summer.
Warner bros's did this to themselves by asking
too high of price, on all three volumes.

Update. [...]

It will finally be released on Feb 4 2013 thanks to everyone's
efforts.

3869996,5,B0027VSTJO,"I loved the show when I was younger even though I didn't understand the humor. I still enjoy it today and I understand the humor!! The word is out now that Volume 4 will be coming to a three disc set this coming February 5th. It will contain all the finale episodes from season three. Unfortunately, it seems like this set does not ( and most likely will not) have any additional features nor the 1999 feature film Wakko's Wish, but I don't care, what matters the most is that Volume 4 of this classic memorable animated TV show wraps up the entire series.

3869997,5,B0027VSTJO,"I have the first 3 Volumes of Animaniacs, and Kept hoping that Volume 4, which concludes the series, would be released afterwards.

Perhaps Volume 4 will be released after The final DVD set of Tiny Toon Adventures.

I also hope that Tiny Toon Adventures Seasons 2 & 3 get released in DVD set, as soon as possible.

Please release the final DVD sets of Animaniacs and Tiny Toon Adventures!

They would be perfect for the Holidays of 2009, or sometime in 2010!",1248134400,2,458,4.548780487804878
3869998,5,B0027VSTJO,"I agree with the previous reviewers and wait anxiously for the final DVD to be made available. I think it was unfair of WB to put out the first three seasons and then hold back the fourth and final disk.

Animaniacs was a refreshing show, at a time when most cartoons were aimed directly for young kids and had to meet a marketing agenda. Animaniacs offered social and political commentary in a way that was fun for kids, but insightful for the adults. A true family comedy where old and young could watch and enjoy. This was very much in line with the original Looney Tunes which were written for adults.

I am curious as to how Star Warners wound up in the Pinky and the Brain DVD. I realize that the segment did start and end with P&B theme however, it was originally broadcast as part of the Animaniac's 99th episode and included the The Scoring Session, Star Warners, Animaniacs Suite and a short Good Feathers clip. I know because I still have the recording I taped when it first aired.

But please, please, please WB release the 4th Animaniacs DVD. Until then I'm left watching Ken Burn's History of Paddle Ball (in 127 parts), again!",1248134400,12,1141,4.502415458937198
