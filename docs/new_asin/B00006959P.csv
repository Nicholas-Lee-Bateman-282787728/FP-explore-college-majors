1731139,3,B00006959P,"These films have a legacy as being shocking, brutal, explicit and unsettling. True horror fans take note: they aren't. I could name a hundred gorier, more shocking DOMESTIC films. (Re-Animator, I Spit on Your Grave, to name a few comparative films) Charlie Sheen thought Devil's Experiment and Flower of Flesh and Blood were real. What a gullible schmuck. These two, the first volume of offerings from Unearthed Films, are pretty tame. The first, Devil's Experiment, is a 'snuff' film where three laughing men mildly brutalize a complacent girl. They slap, kick, poke, and spin this poor girl for about a half hour. Oh yeah, and then they stick a needle through her eye. All except that last one are just humiliating and boring (considering I expected death and gory dismemberment), but the last 'stab' is well done (Fulci was proud). The other is just a poor man's Re-Animator, that is enjoyable but only mildly gory.
  Let's just say, if you have seen Braindead (Dead Alive), then this gore is a wasted fix. These aren't as brutal as I Spit on your Grave or Last House on the Left.  Maybe the susposedly ultimate Flower of Flesh and Blood will soothe that aching need for staged violence and gore, but these were a disappointment.  I have seen all the Fulci, Argento, Romero (Savini's gore), and some D'Amato, and these are just not as good.  Try Guts of a Beauty for shock.",1026172800,3,1376,4.7405857740585775
1731140,4,B00006959P,"Well,  just like everyone else i've seen the [bad] bootlegs that have been around and to think somebody put these movies on DVD in the US is nuts.  I guess I'll be getting mine before some government or stay-home mom group decides to ban these blood-soaked gems.  I'm glad some decided to put there balls on chopping block for the rest of  us. Flower of Flesh and Blood is my personal favorite out of all of Guinea Pigs- the dismemberment is so sick and real looking I had keep telling myself that there fake. I'll be on the lookout for what other titles Unearthed Films is going to be putting out.",1025395200,2,598,4.36036036036036
1731141,5,B00006959P,"I have viewed the bootlegs like a lot of people have, and I have also seen the PAL version. The quality in those versions, does not come even close to this one. Very crisp viewing quality with English subtitles so you can finally figure out what the heck they are saying. I am one of many very shocked people that this series is finally here in the states. I am looking forward to the next installments.
Now as far as what these are all about, if you are a horror, gore, and fanatic of gneres that relate to all out craziness, this is for you. If you haven't seen these or even heard of them, you are in for a real shock, this is definitely not for the light of heart.",1024617600,3,668,4.106870229007634
7965328,5,B00006959P,"The first installment of this notorious horror series presents a woman being kidnapped by a gang of black-clad men who torture her for several days before finally killing her. She is beaten savagely, spun around in the chair endlessly, has her fingernails pulled, animal guts are thrown at her, hot boiling water is poured on her and finally is punctured with a needle (really sick and nasty scene). The makers of this unforgettable torture show tried to make it as real as possible and for me this is the closest thing to a snuff film you can get without committing murder on tape. Of course some of the special effects are rather poor, but the idea of making a snuff is pretty gruesome. I have also seen ""Flowers of Flesh and Blood"" which is more gory and sadistic, but less disturbing. Anyway, this one is a must-see for horror fans!",1297728000,,836,4.58
7965329,1,B00006959P,"Hey Gorehounds, don't waste your time with this.

For Charlie Sheen to think that ""Devil's Experiment"" was real shows just how brain dead the guy is. It's nothing more than a relatively boring trip through some experimental torture session that lasts, apparently, a few days. The level of blood in the film is very, very tame compared to others as there's more time spent slapping, ""kicking"" and letting the subject/victim listen to a looped sound from a reel-to-reel machine for 20+ hours. Yes, we get to watch her sit there and suffer from whatever sound she's hearing. Convincingly non-convincing, if you catch my drift.

It's a waste of a good idea for a controversial snuff-esque film that anyone else could have done better.

I won't bother with ""Android"" as I decided to flip through it after I was finished with ""Devil's"" instead of watch it. Looks to be even cheaper and more lame than I had thought it'd be.

This DVD looks good on your shelf with other, better gross-out films and is probably worth having for the conversation aspect. Don't bother watching it, though. Really, it's stupid.",1292457600,,1100,4.835106382978723
7965330,1,B00006959P,"Guinea Pig Devil's Experiment: 1/10: Hardcore porn films fall into two categories those with a semblance of plot (Gee that is one lucky pizza boy) and those without (Anal Amateurs 36). Devil's Experiment falls solidly into the latter category.

It is of course the horror version of hardcore porn. An almost completely plot less 43-minute wait for the money shot. Shot on video in 1985 it consists of three relatively non-descript Japanese boys torturing one fairly unattractive Japanese girl. The tortures range from the banal (slapping her 50 times, kicking her a hundred), the silly (tying her to an office chair and spinning her around), the fear factor (a bath of maggots and sheep guts) and finally the money shot. (A well executed eyeball piercing).

That's it, no plot, no motive, just Blair Witch tree shots and torture. The girl looks bored and with the exception of yelling, ""no one expects the Spanish Inquisition"" during the office chair scene I was bored silly. Staring dumbfounded at the screen, waiting for the money shot. Just like hardcore porn.

Android of Notre Dame: 4 out of 10: Demented DNA dabbling dwarf seeks to cure ailing sister (her ailment isn't specified but I'm guessing Ali McGraw disease as she becomes prettier the sicker she gets). He gets a living dead girl to experiment on from a blackmailing body procurer (Tomorowo Taguchi who has only one expression but it's a dozy and kind of reminds one of a Japanese Phil Hartman). Taguchi gets greedy, the living dead girl decomposes, the sister gets sicker and the dwarf goes to a bad place.

The script sometimes writes checks the F/X can't cash (The legs and flying saw blade scene is particularly unconvincing) And the movie concentrates so much on the anatomical gross out it starts looking like an alien autopsy film. Yet an overall goofiness survives throughout.

Maybe it was the complete lack of humor (This is straightforward Poe style moralizing), the video quality that reminded me of a Canadian television movie, or the fact that after watching companion feature Devil's Experiment anything looks good but this little film wasn't all that bad.",1268265600,3,2136,4.971988795518207
7965331,4,B00006959P,"While Guinea Pig Devils Experiment isn't quite what I thought it would be, I found it interesting nonetheless. I'm a fan of gore films and this one certainly has that. It is a little cheesy in spots, but overall, if one is into these types of films, than I suggest giving it a try. I'm glad that I added it to my collection. I'll likely seek out the other films in the series.",1259971200,,376,4.164383561643835
7965332,4,B00006959P,"Whatever you expect of the ""Guinea Pig"" film series, you are probably wrong.  For one thing, only the first two in the series are anything ""extreme"".  The following films are just cheesy gore fests, almost on the same level as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Basket-Case/dp/B00005KH30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Basket Case</a>&nbsp;and with about the same level of realism.  But those first two...I don't even know if one can classify them as ""horror films"".

The series producer, Ogura Satoru, said that he wanted to ""test the limits of human pain"", but he is also testing the limits of what people are willing to watch.  People liked blood-splatter flicks, so he wanted to see just how much they could take, and to find if there a limit where even the most hardened fan would close his eyes and say ""enough!""  Apparently not.

This DVD has the first Guinea Pig film, ""Devil's Experiment"" (A literal translation of the Japanese title ""Akuma no Jiken"") and the fifth film ""Android of Notre Dame"" (""Notorudamu no andoroido"").

""Devil's Experiment"" is probably the harshest of the series, although not the most famous.  This is not a gore fest, this is just abuse.  A group of men kidnap a young girl, and proceed to torture her both physically and psychologically for an hour.  That is it.  No story, no conclusion, just a girl in a room being beaten, covered in animal guts and worms, thrown to the floor and kicked...and that is it.  It is a brutal film.

""Android of Notre Dame"" could not be a further contrast.  Pure blood and cheese, this one tells the story of a midget scientist trying to bring his girlfriend back to life by doing experiments on beautiful naked women.  There's not much to say about this one.  It is a goofy gore fest, and a nice relief after watching ""Devil's Experiment"".

Like most people, the reputation of the ""Guinea Pig"" series is what made me seek them out.  For gore and horror aficionados, they fall on the must-see list along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cannibal-Holocaust/dp/B000C4BBXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cannibal Holocaust</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Faces-of-Death/dp/B000060MU9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Faces of Death</a>&nbsp;films.  If you haven't seen them, you don't get to join the club as a full member, so to speak.

They are not as realistic as I thought they would be, and it is hard to imagine that people once thought they were actual snuff films.  Maybe we are more jaded nowadays.  Just to prove the point that it is all just theatrics however, this DVD even includes a ""Making of..."" feature for ""Devil's Experiment"".  Apparently, Ogura's greatest worry, finding an actress to play the part, was no worry at all.  Literally hundreds of women auditioned for the chance to be tortured and murdered on film.",1224201600,,2927,5.479910714285714

DEVILS EXPERIMENT

Devil's Experiment is a very fun to watch film and does not get old.

STORY: Not much of a story, A group of notorious men trap a woman and bring her to a torture chamber. They torture her in many ways (Spinning her in a chair 1000 times and getting her wasted on Jack Daniels, putting a long metal slimjim in her eye) and abuse her as many times as they can so she can finally die. This is for an experiment.

THOUGHTS: A very fine and well done torture film. You should see it if you want gore!

RATING: 5/5

ANDROID OF NOTRE DAME

Guinea Pig. BURRP! BLARGH! PUKE! SICK! DISGUSTING! Many ways you can say ""THIS IS SOOOOOOO TWISTED!"" Plus, You'll find 'em alot fun. And AOND? IT just sits there doing nothing, and being boring, and... uh yeah... BORING.

STORY: A disgrunted midget scientist is current grieving the fact that his sister is dying of a horrible heart disease. During her time of dying, The scientist must find a cure for death. Then one day the scientist gets a lucky phone call that there is a cure. He tries the cure and it all goes wrong.

THOUGHTS: What a waste of time! I kept wanting to turn it off. the gore is boring and totally snore inducing. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

OVERALL: So buy it for DE only.",1152489600,,1583,5.042307692307692
7965334,3,B00006959P,"Devil's Experiment is the first part of the infamous series of shock/exploitation gore films from Japan known as Guinea Pig. In reality, the first two Guinea Pig films contain absolutely zero plot; they are just cinematic examinations of torture, dismemberment, and abuse. The series has an infamous and controversial history, similar to Italy's Cannibal Holocaust. And, of course, we have all heard the so-called legend. That is the very reason why we are here in the first place, right? If it wasn't for this hearsay and this long endured rumor these films would have faded into obscurity a long time ago. The legend is that actor Charlie Sheen stumbled upon an old, unmarked VHS copy of Devil's Experiment/Flowers of Flesh and Blood and actually thought that it was ""real."" He ended up contacting the FBI about the tape where, of course, they came to the conclusion that it was a fake. And that is ultimately what the first two Guinea Pig films are - pseudo-snuff films. They are nothing more and nothing less.

Now you may ask, is there a point to these films other than putting them on your shelf in order to look ""hardcore"" in front of all of your friends? I don't know. From a certain perspective, these are some of the most fatalistic and utterly hopeless films ever made. They depict certain harsh realities that even most horror films will not touch upon.

There is no semblance of a plot, or even a deeper meaning behind these films. When it all comes down to it, you get what you get. It doesn't pull any punches. So when it comes down to actually reviewing this film, it is hard to come up with an actual objective rating. Giving it a five would be an insult because, quite frankly, this is a horribly unbalanced film. There is no story, no character development, no nothing. However, Devil's Experiment does succeed in what it sets out to do - it creates a shocking pseudo-snuff film. Granted, it may not be shocking to fans of extreme cinema, but it is still a shocking film to some extents. Just think about finding this film on an unmarked VHS tape, not knowing where it came from or who made it. That would be shocking and frightening. Of course, it looks fake because it is fake, but the subject matter of this film is still an examination of the darker side of our own nature. It calls out to us, intrigues us... whether we like it or not. Usually, we watch movies in order to escape the painful realities of death, but Devil's Experiment reminds us of how vulnerable we truly are and how short life is... And, as you can very well imagine, the good guys do not win in the end... Not at all.",1142553600,7,2611,4.529661016949152

Guinea Pig 5: Android of Notre Dame (Kazuhito Kuramoto, 1988)

Man, someone at IMDB has been messing with the numbers of the Guinea Pig flicks. How could Android of Notre Dame (1988) be Guinea Pig 2, when Flower of Flesh and Blood (listed as GP3 at IMDB) was made in 1985? I don't know either. Besides, I've seem the tapes. This really is Guinea Pig 5. Unfortunately, it seems the series went downhill.

The plot of this one concerns a doctor (Toshihiko Hino) whose sister (Ultraman Tiga and Ultraman Dina's pretty young thing Mio Takaki) is dying of some unspecified heart disease. The doctor is trying to save her. Why this involves attempting to bring the dead back to life, we have no clue. It does, however, involve high finance, and thus blackmail by a computer hacking geek (Tochiro Taguchi).

There are some amusing moments, and a few that will probably trip the gore scale for most folks, but those who have seen Flower of Flesh and Blood or Mermaid in a Manhole are probably going to be saying to themselves ""this is Guinea Pig?"" For completists, or those who are uncomfortable with the personalized brutality of the earlier films. ** 1/2",1080691200,3,1211,4.666666666666667
7965336,2,B00006959P,"This is not horror - horror has substance, characters, and a brain. The people behind this film supposidly set out to make as shocking a film as they could, but ended up with exploited pseudo-snuff that sways between stupidly staged to pointlessly violent. While I thoroughly enjoy gory film (Dead Alive, Bad Taste, Riki-O, etc.), the gore is not the focus of this video as 3 men torture a lady for about 30 minutes (only about 10 have ACTUAL gore). WOW - we get to see these men tie her up and SPIN her in a chair 200 TIMES - what FIENDS!!! But first, repeatedly slap her - I've seen more heated slapping on Jerry Springer! 1 cool scene - the needle in the eye (which is blatenly fake and Fulci's Zombie pulled off the gag MUCH better - try actually having SOUND!!) Oh yeah, your only sounds come from the slapping and a few mumbles of the girl.
I appologize that I did not view the second movie (Android) on the disc, but Devils Experiment was reason enough to shut off the DVD player and immediatly find another buyer. ... (Update) I did get to finally view Android and was quite pleased with the results.  The gore was done fairly well and the story/characters kept my interest through the short.  It's an odd coupling with Devils though, since the subject matter, tone, and even gore are not on pace with one another.",1028505600,2,1322,4.436213991769547
7965337,5,B00006959P,I picked up this dvd and I didn't kno wwhat to expect. I figured from all of the hoopla on the web it would be nastier then I can think but then the web said Blair Witch Project was real so I didn't pay any mind. Well I got the dvd in the mail and watched it. The Devils Experiment is twisted. Even though a couple of the scenes looked fake the rest didn't and that messed with my head. Ive seen a lot of gore films and have seen a lot of special effects but the skin they used was to real and the blood just acted to real for my tastes. I mean i'm glad I have it in my collection with all of the Dario Argento and Fulci flicks because it's just wacked and if I ever want to freak friends out this is the dvd. I'm really looking forward to the next dvd Mermaid in a Manhole and He Never Dies Double Feature and the the notorious Flower of Flesh and Blood disc. The Flower is supposed to be the worst in the series so I don't know. Unearthed Films is really going for the throat and it seems like they are going to release only real horror films unlike some companies I can speak of. Check this dvd out it's better then a lot of stuff being shoved down our throat from Hollywood,1027123200,2,1177,3.9495798319327733
