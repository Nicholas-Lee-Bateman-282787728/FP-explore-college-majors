8087433,5,B000BJNUKC,"All of the Squibs videos are advanced and they attempt to simplify subjects as much as possible. The animations aren't great, but they are creative and there are some catchy rhymes and songs in each video. When I was a medical student, I bought the Squibs video on the body systems and I absolutely loved it. My son (3 at the time) wouldn't sit down and watch it, but I would play it in the room while he was playing with his toys. Occassionally he would look up at it for a bit and keep on playing. Because of comments he would make to me, I was sure that he was inadvertanly retaining some of what he was hearing on the Squibs video. So I bought more. After I started doing the same thing with the Squibs Chemistry, he told me that, ""when wood burns it's undergoing a chemical reaction."" I now have the entire Squibs set and I am very pleased with everyone of them. They are really fantastic learning tools and give a nice overview of many different subjects. Just don't expect mindless ""educational"" cartoons like Little Einsteins (I was never happy with any of that line) because this is certainly way beyond that.",1233187200,2,1118,4.432038834951456

He's watched this DVD over and over and knows alot more space facts than before b/c of the songs that play during the video.  He really likes it.  It's good for children 3 to 7 or so, in my opinion.",1176163200,4,272,4.0
