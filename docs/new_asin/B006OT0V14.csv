8502297,4,B006OT0V14,"Now this was totally unexpected! A kooky, warped blast that betrays some serious talent and good movie making intuition by the makers. Its kinda lo budget, some mediocre production values, but the whole is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. There were scenes where I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I haven't had that experience in a loooonnngggg time! To me, it had a totally retro vibe because they just don't make them like this anymore! Kudos for that. If you have a warped sense of humor, you should like this.",1406764800,,530,4.648936170212766
8502298,3,B006OT0V14,"Okay a few disclaimers first: Yes the production values are low (hence the whole indie movie thing), the acting is silly often and it's all a little longer than need be. However, as far as movies go about killer fetuses , it could be worse!

This is much closer to the level of production that many Troma movies are- which should be an indicator to some to stay away and for others to seek this one out. In fact, really that's the best comparison I can think of: if ya like Troma movies (or any low budget horror flicks with ridiculous premises: Blood Freak, Thankskilling, Basket Case, etc)- then this should be up your alley. If those types of movies aren't your thing (too schlocky/gross/immature), then you'll probably not like this one either.

I think with the right expectations going in, this can be an entertaining flick- just adjust said expectations accordingly",1353801600,2,872,4.730263157894737
8502299,2,B006OT0V14,"I have put off purchasing Won Ton Baby for a while, because although it is a supposed horror-comedy that got good reviews and stars Debbie Rochon (one of my favorite actresses), the movie just looked too silly to me. And after watching it, I can attest that it really is too silly. The baby looks absolutely ridiculous, and the kills are few and far between. The comedy is also few and far between. What there is is far too much drama. The scenes with Debbie and the cop are just boring, and belong in a chick flick instead of a movie like this. There is also a scene in the movie where a baby is pleasuring itself while watching a fetish video, that was just unnecessary and revolting. Really, the only stuff in this movie that was good is Debbie Rochon's performance (too good for this movie), and the gore which is good whenever it appears. Avoid, unless you're a fan of Rochon like me.",1343001600,,889,4.393939393939394
8502300,5,B006OT0V14,Won Ton Baby is one of those little pieces of genius that make me love independent film. Starring the first ladies of Schlock horror Suzi Lorraine and Debbie Rochon this un pc jaunt into mutant baby mayhem is a must have for any true horror fan.,1333152000,3,245,4.3478260869565215
8502301,5,B006OT0V14,"I have been waiting three long years for this film to emerge on DVD.  During this period the expectations began to build up and thankfully I was not disappointed on viewing the DVD.

The film storyline and the well drawn up characters are original in their conception - including Won Ton Baby!  Initially the story begins in the seventies and moves onto to the present day but it has a feel of the eighties horror film output about it.  This time spanning proves to be a very successful formula in this instance.  All concerned in the project have combined well to hit the centre of the target in all aspects - script, direction and performances - in the presentation of a very entertaining and interesting package with its mix of horror and comedy.  The balance enables the viewer to maintain interest right up to the lively, over the top comedy fight scene finale.

All the necessary background information is cleverly and efficiently integrated in the opening scenes.  This is when the first touches of humour appear sprinkled into the weird story mix.  One vehicle for achieving this is via the characters of Little Wing played by Suzi Lorraine who speaks with a Chinese accent which is guaranteed to bring a smile to the faces of viewers and a gentleman known as 'The King' who is ably impersonated by Lou Martini Jr who later appears in another role as a detective.  His scenes with Debbie Rochon are particularly impressive.

A highlight comedy scene is when the brother of Little Wing (played by Abe Tran) offers an assessment of her accent and sentence structuring and this served to draw attention to the merits of Suzi's performance.  Tackling a role involving speaking with a foreign accent which covers a lengthy proportion of a film is a formidable challege for any actor especially if it also requires the delivery of a comedy element as in this case.  It is easy to lose concentration and consequently move away from the desired accent into delivery in normal speech mode.  It is to Suzi's credit that a consistent accent is presented throughout accompanied by the appropriate humour balance which is achieved through her application of mannerisms and body language to the task.

There are some excellent examples of camera work.  For example, in a scene featuring Debbie, Suzi and Gunnar Hansen the camera angle is utilised to build up the visual information required to provide a perception of their character elements with Suzi's apathetic approach to the situation being discussed by Debbie and Gunnar is revealed by her concentration on fiddling about with her phone.

A hospital bed scene when Won Ton Baby is introduced and the interaction between members of the family and Baby are little gems of comedy played to perfection by all participants in the scenes.  These light hearted scenes contrast abruptly and effectively with an immediate subsequent scene when the disturbing aspects of Baby's character appear and provide an indication of how Baby's monster like behaviour patters are likely to develop.  This fast evolving development of Baby utilised to maintain the viewer's attention and curiosity about the possible escapade's of the infant as well as his habit forming as he graduates into a rampaging killer.  The ending leaves the door open for a sequel.",1333152000,5,3288,4.932849364791289
8502302,1,B006OT0V14,"Who's giving this 5 stars? Certainly not me! And guess what? I'm the target audience for this kind of thing! I love stuff like Frankenhooker, Dead Alive, Zombie Strippers, Gutterballs, etc. This crazy premise should have been a home run -- but it's absolutely excruciating trying to get through the 1 hour 40 min running time. It feels like 3 hours of pure torture. Production values are crap, the special effects aren't even up to the level this kind of cheese would require. In other words, bad effects can be funny. These don't even qualify as funny. Just one level from a cabbage patch doll glued to a stick. Please avoid this and don't waste your time unless you hate yourself.",1332633600,2,682,4.644628099173554
8502303,5,B006OT0V14,"Sitting down to watch this at its UK premiere in London I wasn't exactly sure what I was about to see.

This homage to 80's shock horrors like Basket Case and Child's play was everything I could have wished for and then a swift kick in the nuts to follow.

From the start the production costs of this indie film made me feel I was watching something that I perhaps shouldn't be the film was luring me in with the expectation of something gross to come in the final reel.

Once the arrival of the title character hit the screens I found myself in pain form laughing so hard. having seen promo photos of Baby, what you see on the screen is a fantastic well executed puppet that is far better than I imagined and what he does on screen is both insane and hilarious and I'm sure everyone who watches this will try to impersonate baby's crazy noises, I know I did.

This is a fantastic horror comedy that gives you everything you could want from the genre. gore, shocks, sex, drugs, a freaky perverted baby, an Elvis impersonator and hell of a lot more.

Baby is definitely a mischievous character who I'd love to see grace the screen again, He is very similar in ways to basket case or the child zombie from Peter Jackson's Brain Dead with a heavy dose of a gremlin or a critter's penchant for misbehaving.

The film also features a great cast headed by the genre pleasing Debbie Rochon and the amazing Suzi Lorraine (who also wrote and produced the film) plus a cameo from Gunar leatherface Hansen.

This is definitely worth watching",1327708800,7,1530,4.442857142857143
8502304,5,B006OT0V14,"Vampires, zombies, aliens, Babylonian gods who enjoy possessing innocent American girls, you recognize them. They're all staples of the horror genre. However, at the New York Horror Film Festival, Suzi Lorraine and James Morgart brought the world a new monster to fear, babies in the horror/comedy, ""Won Ton Baby.""

During the seventies, Madam Won Ton (Debbie Rochon) was the head of an exclusive brothel that spent a night with ""the King."" During their ""fling"" both ingested some pills with unusual side effects. Thirty years later, Madam Won Ton runs a successful Chinese restaurant with her two children, Ben (Abe Tran) and her older daughter Lily or ""Little Wing"" (Suzi Lorraine). Lily has an unusually large stomach. After collapsing during a dinner service, the Doctor (Gunnar Hansen of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" fame) reveals that Lily has had a parasitic twin living in her stomach her whole life. The Doctor was able to remove it, giving the Won Tons a bizarre looking baby with a living umbilical cord, sexual appetite, and a taste for blood. The baby, named Won Ton, is the star of the movie. The only way to truly describe Won Ton is Baby Sinclair raised by Freddy Krueger and the Alien Queen. Won Ton enjoys eating rats, taking advantage of passed out women, his brother's porn collection, and eating people. Forgoing expensive, texture less CGI director James Morgart uses a creepy silicon puppet designed by Paul Mafuz and Ingrid Okola, who recently won her second Emmy for her work on ""All My Children."" Considering the silicon baby was built from scratch, it's easy to see why Ms. Okola won the Emmy. The baby has a creepy stare and it' swirling umbilical cord is gooey and disgusting, as it should be. Yet he's kind of cute...in a monstrous way.

Bringing a heart to the film is Suzi's portrayal of the baby's twin/older sister Lily. Lily has lived a bizarre life. In addition to her medical condition, she speaks like a stereotypical Asian because she's been raised to believe she's the daughter of an Asian businessman. Yet, Lily has an innocence that makes you care about her journey. In addition to playing Lily, ""Won Ton Baby's"" story was the brainchild (no pun intended) of Suzi, after seeing a story about the medical condition, ""fetus in fetu"", which literally means fetus within a fetus. Suzi also cites horror comedies like ""Evil Dead"" as inspiration for the tone of the film.

Another strong performance came from Debbie Rochon as Madame Won Ton. Madame Won Ton is strong, independent, woman who is trying to run her business and raise her children right. Unfortunately, her past keeps catching up with her, not only with Lily, but also persecution from Detective Bob ""Bubba"" O'Reilly (Nick Raio) who wants to shut her down, even though she's come clean. Still, Madame Won Ton's still got it and is not afraid to use it, wooing Bubba's partner Detective Hardin (Lou Martini Jr.) to her cause and inspiring her workers to prepare for Bubba a very special soup.

""Won Ton Baby"" is a funny, bloody, sexy, over the top, horror comedy that is reminiscent of the days of ""grindhouse"" theater. Director James Morgart really inspired his cast and crew to make a movie that was above and beyond all expectations. If you're a fan of ""Evil Dead"" or horror movies in general you must see ""Won Ton Baby."" It is well directed, well acted and definitely more original than any of the horror movies you'll find in the mainstream.",1327622400,5,3442,4.838709677419355
