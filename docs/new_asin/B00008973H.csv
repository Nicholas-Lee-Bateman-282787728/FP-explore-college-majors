1830699,3,B00008973H,"The first movie on this DVD is quite silly, and should be entertaining to those who get a laugh from really bad movies.
Journey to the Seventh Planet is hardly Oscar stuff, but I would see it as being better than Invisible Invaders.  Some of the ideas remind me of stuff I've seen on classic Star Trek, though the end is very weak.  Kids who like sci-fi should enjoy this one; my husband did when he was a boy.
Buy the DVD if you want a few hours of fun, but don't expect much else.",1051833600,,482,4.063157894736842
1830700,4,B00008973H,"The prolific Edward L. Cahn's ""Invisible Invaders"" was released a few months before Ed Wood's infamous ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and in many ways is similar to it, right down to its Cold War anti-nuclear message.  Physicist Adam Penner (Philip Tonge, featured in ""House of Wax"" and ""Macabre"") objects to the arms race.  Sound familiar?  When his colleague Karol Noymann (John Carradine, here in basically a cameo appearance) is killed in a nuclear accident, he resigns from the federal ""Atom Commission.""  After Noymann's funeral, an invisible emissary from an interplanetary dictatorship with a long-standing base on earth's moon reanimates the scientist's body and issues Penner an ultimatum: now that it is about to enter the Space Age, earth must surrender or be destroyed.  Penner's assistant John Lamont (Robert Hutton, fresh from his role in ""The Colossus of New York"") dutifully takes the message to the commission's heads in Washington, but is not taken seriously.  The invisible invaders proceed to enter the bodies of the recently dead and use them to commit ""sabotage"" all over the world.  The Air Force sends Major Bruce Jay (John Agar, who'd just done a fine job in Nathan Hertz's campy ""Brain From Planet Arous"" but who spends the second half of this movie doing an uninspired John Wayne imitation) to transport Dr. Penner, his daughter (Jean Byron, who would go on to play Patty Duke's mother on TV), and Dr. Lamont to a secluded bunker where they develop a weapon that eventually defeats the invaders.  Screenwriter Samuel Newman, who would go on to craft suspenseful teleplays for ""Perry Mason"" and ""The Wild, Wild West,"" here borrows a few plot elements from Fred F. Sears' 1956 film ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers.""  Director Cahn was an old hand at directing zombies, with ""Creature with the Atom Brain"" and ""The Zombies of Mora Tau"" under his belt by this time.  Special effects artist Roger George did a competent job on this his first feature film.  Paul Dunlap's score, with its military marches offset by eerie extraterrestrial interludes, later turned up in ""The Angry Red Planet.""  Though ""Invisible Invaders"" was obviously a rushed and at times careless production - Cahn helmed a total of seven films in 1959 alone, and even more than that the following year - the film's influence on George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" is unmistakable.
""Journey to the Seventh Planet"" is basically a remake of producer Sid Pink's earlier science fiction effort ""The Angry Red Planet,"" which is itself a quirky and inventive reworking of ""The Wizard of Oz.""  Filmed in Denmark in 1961, this film opens in the year 2001, when the earth has abolished war and is governed by the United Nations.  Talk about optimism!  When no life is discovered on the first six planets orbiting the sun, an international team of five astronauts is dispatched to the planet Uranus to investigate an unusual form of radiation emanating from it.  Expecting to find a forbidding, icy landscape, the astronauts are astonished to find evergreen trees and running streams on its surface.  Not long after a whole village the ship's captain recalls from his youth materializes in the distance, complete with women each member of the ship's crew knew and loved on earth, the five begin to suspect their memories are being tapped and used to create convincing illusions.  Eventually they penetrate the barrier that seals the forest off from the rest of the planet, and discover that a giant alien brain is manipulating their thoughts and hopes to dominate earth.  Enlisting the help of the women the brain has created for them, all but one of the men manage to break free of its control and escape, though presumably without destroying the brain completely.  (Someone has to sing, ""I wait for you... somewhere on the seventh planet"" as the rocketship speeds away.)  Except for John Agar, who had just completed ""Hand of Death,"" and Greta Thyssen, who had recently appeared in ""Terror Is a Man"" (available on DVD as ""Blood Creature""), most of the cast had appeared in director Sid Pink's ""Reptilicus.""  Fans of the film will be happy to know that the new DVD version contains the original song sung over the end credits by Otto Brandenburg, who's almost (but not quite) worthy of Tony Bennett.  Although the special effects, many of which were trimmed or reshot by American International after the film wrapped in Denmark, are primitive by today's standards, the film's comic book colors and hypnotic visual inserts give much of the film an almost psychedelic look that's definitely worth checking out today.",1050796800,4,4597,4.9647979139504566
1830701,4,B00008973H,"Journey to the 7th Planet:
A United Nation exploration team lands on Uranus and discovers that a ""brain"" rules the planet. This brain uses the memories from the team's mind to create images for them to experience while on Uranus (e.g. one finds a replica of his village, one that is scared of rats finds a giant one, and or course they all meet their girlfriends.)
Invisible Invaders:
The Invisible Invaders have been on the moon (of all places) for 20,000 years and have decided to take over the Earth unless it's surrenders immediately. Well the Earth does not surrender and the Invaders arrive and start taking over human corpses. These corpses march all over the countryside reeking havoc, and taking over bodies as people are killed.

1830738,4,B00008973H,"The Invisible Invaders is an early zombie type of story with the aliens invading dead bodies.  It's a cold war movie, so of course they want to take over the world.  It was engaging and creepy enough to watch more than once.

Where ever did someone find Journey to the Seventh Planet?  By the odd way some words are pronounced it wasn't made in America.  It was imaginative, however, some of the plot was copped later by the writers of the origial Star Trek.  Lonely alien on Uranus seeks playmates to help it get to Earth.  It creates places for astronauts to interact with women from their past.  See: Star Trek.  Don't miss the song played during  the credits.

1830739,4,B00008973H,What can one say about old Sci Fi movies.  You either love them or you hate them.  I love them.  The extremely limited special effects that they had to work with make these guys the real pros.  Not these newer ones with all the computer graphics to work with.  My hat is off to the George Pals and the other greats of their time.,1322870400,,329,4.078125
1830740,3,B00008973H,"My review just deals with the movie ""Seventh Planet from the Sun"".  I find these old sci fi films interesting because it shows what we thought we knew back at that time period, for example, Uranus having a solid surface.  I also like how when the crew flies past Saturn, the rings of the planet are fairly blury, just as it would be seen through the old telescopes of that day and not the actual tac sharp rings we see from the Cassini/ Voyager probe flybys.

I also find interesting how this movie made in 1962 has a fairly similar story theme to Stanislaw Lem's ""Solaris"" written in 1961.  The crew of a space ship start seeing people from their past, somehow connected to an alien intelligence and being manipulated through these created beings.  In Solaris the lead Kelvin rekindles his love for his departed wife suggesting to take her back to earth and warned by the avatar that she could not live away from Solaris, in Seventh Planet, it seems all the boys are smitten with their own girl from the past and the lead does bring back his love only to have her disappear on the way home.  Of course this movie's alien is much simplified in that it sees the earth men just as invaders and ""they must die"" although, like in Solaris, there is a scene from Seventh in which one of the bombshells talks of the alien intelligence as being separate from her and speculates about it.  What's interesting is that Uranus is really a great ocean just like the planet Solaris.",1309910400,3,1468,4.47565543071161

1830784,3,B00008973H,"The first thing about these movies is that the prints on this disc are in excellent shape! There is no excuse for the shoddy prints that some people put out of some older movies. There are no lines and scraps either. Another thing is that you get the very good actor John Agar in both of these very low budget movies. Invisible Invaders is the type of awkward movie that is inept and bad in so many ways that it's good. The acting is not bad though , these were accomplished actors and they play this movie with conviction.  However you do get that bad narration style of movie making. ""and then they went to washington.."" 'the dead killers are coming to..' but so what? this is very low budget movie making from 1958. But even then a viewer would have felt the awkwardness because it's slightly ed woodian; only it has alot more money than he had. The cave set is not too bad actually. The zombies look like zombies and the ray that kills them is hilariously fun. They shove stock footage and film from another movie in here too, of course this is really a c or z  movie and If you don't enjoy this type of movie either for it's low budget off kilterness or it's vintage fun then you'll be frozen by it's amazing awkwardness.  The other movie is a much higher effort and is more inventive in spite of it's low budget. But we must remember that to people of 1962 these effects wouldn't have been seen as awful.  This danish film is interesting and of course a low budget flick that one can enjoy on it's level and time period of creation.  Of course in my book low budget sci fi movies of this caliber are not even on the scale of a movie like casablanca but on a low budget scale you will enjoy them if and only if you enjoy these type of old very cheap sci fi movies. Some sci fi movies of this era were quite higher in their skill and execution than these. See 'x the unkown"" and others but that was good moviemaking on a low budget. These are ok and bad movie making from a lost era.",1266364800,,1987,4.2047244094488185

1830786,2,B00008973H,"This is another in the ""Midnite Movies"" releases from MGM(double sided disc) and in my oppinion the best film here out of the two is the 1959 production of Invisible Invaders,starring John Carradine. However this film has got to hold some kind of record for killing off it's name star within the first three minutes of the picture! For that's what happens to poor John as one Dr. Noymann in a radiation accident. After his funeral he rises from the dead and visits a friend Dr. Penner,played by another veteran actor Philip Tonge(the department store manager in Miracle on 34th Street).Penner is told by his old friend that he is indeed dead but his body is inhabited by a creature from outer space who,along with many others already there,plan to take over the world. He is given the opportunity to warn the worlds' powers but no one believes him. Eventually the aliens are forced to take drastic action which awakens the world to their presence. Dr. Penner,his daughter,her boyfriend and an air force Major Jay(John Agar) take refuge in a mountain hideout to come up with a solution,as the world is at the brink of destruction at the hands of the alien controlled undead. The solution arrived at is a sound ray that forces the entities to leave the host bodies and then die. Earth one,aliens nothing.
Carradine and Tonge bring their combined acting experiences together which helps an otherwise tepid movie. Because of them the movie at times can appear better than it is. It does move along relatively well and it is a decent little time waster. Unlike the flip side movie here,Journey to the Seventh Planet.
Journey puts the ""bad"" into the B-movie. It concerns a journey to Uranus(the 7th planet).While the credits roll the rocket ship is passing Jupiter,then Saturn. Come the opening scenes of the film,we see Mars and the captain asks their location. The response is that they just passed the moon and they should be coming up on Mars! Maybe they liked Uranus so much this movie is about their second journey(?).
No matter,just before they land an alien energy/mind force freezes the crew ,explaining it has plans to take over their minds and bodies and destroy them. They land on the planet and discover a breathable atmosphere and the landscape is forested. Upon further exploration they discover they are in a protective force barrier outside of which is the real atmosphere of the planet. They also discover that the creature is making many of their thoughts and desires come true,and where male astronauts are involved there has to be some females to amuse them,which dutfiully appear along the way. Outside the barrier they finally discover the creatures'lair and they hurt it enough to escape in their space ship. A real head scratching moment comes(and there are many!)as they board to leave. Outside is waiting one of the captain's ""mirage"" women and for some reason he takes her aboard. All along he has been warning the others to keep their distance,that they aren't real and should be avoided;yet he does that!?? Well just after take off the ""mirage"" lady becomes just that and disappears before the crew as background music swells up as that chart topping tune of the day ""Journey to the 7th Planet""plays. Who'd have guessed? This plot is SO weak,the acting so stilted and the aliens so mundane that you wish this MOVIE had gone to Uranus and stayed for the duration. John Agar from Invisible Invaders also plays in this stinker too and adds to the dullness from begining to merciful end.
Both films are in remarkable shape technically speaking,however. Invaders is in B&W (full screen) and Journey is in colour in a nice widescreen format. Both prints are very good and quite clear and crisp. Unfortunately this can't extricate this release from its' two star fate. Invaders is the most appealing of the two with Journey falling far,far behind. I can only see this having appeal to the most compleatist of Sci-Fi fans out there or those who have a tinge of nostalgia for one or both of these flatulant flicks!",1235952000,2,4029,4.815295815295816
1830787,4,B00008973H,"Critics continue to bash ""Journey"" unmercifully but it's one of my childhood favorites. Many have described the plot in detail so I'll forego a plot description and instead describe the effect it had on me. I saw the film the first week it opened in 1962 at the 1200-seat Palace Theater which was packed, and hearing the audience reactions both during and after the film, many appeared to enjoy it. I was 11 at the time and that cyclops dinosaur creature scared the heck out of me! And judging by the screams it scared many others as well. The giant spider crushed by the falling boulder was a hoot! The film was mesmerizing and entertaining throughout. Even the romantic ""Journey"" ballad sung over the end credits is a treat. I enjoyed the film so much I followed it to the second run theaters, and then convinced my parents to take me when it opened at the drive-ins.

Its many critics fail to realize that it was basically aimed at the teen and pre-teen market which I believe it satisfied very well.  It was certainly new and offbeat for its time with beautiful color, swirling psychedelic patterns, and that weird compelling music which suited the film perfectly (yes, I realize a good portion of the music wasn't composed for the film but was culled from various sources). When viewed today some of the acting (though not all of it) admittedly leaves a little to be desired, and the special effects and sets are not of the highest calibre. But none of this was apparent through the eyes of an 11-year-old in 1962 as the sets and effects were certainly ominous looking. Although even back then I did think it was strange when the actors spoke and their lips fit the words perfectly in some scenes but not in others.

Upon their first viewing of the film the honchos at American International deemed it ""unreleasable"" in the U.S. The entire film was redubbed, and scenes of the original Danish monsters were apparently so poor they were cut and replaced by two new creatures AIP considered more marketable for American audiences. The original music score was entirely replaced as well. Somewhere in some vault lies a print of the original uncut Danish version that I'd love to see.

I was lucky enough to meet John Agar at a Hollywood Autograph Show shortly before he passed away in 2002. I asked if he enjoyed making Journey to the Seventh Planet, and he said yes, very much so. He also mentioned he took the family along and they all had a great time vacationing in Denmark while he made the film.

Journey to the Seventh Planet should be enjoyed for what it is - a very low budget but imaginative and colorful space adventure.  The print used for the DVD is a beauty with rich vivid colors and a sharp image. I haven't yet watched Invisible Invaders so I cannot offer a thumbs up or down on this one. But it does star the great John Agar!",1226448000,3,2845,4.546875

The movie is however interesting for all Danes as they can recognize all the famous and belowed Danish actors of the time in some higly unordinary situations.

ESPECIALLY the fact that the danish actor Ove Sproge - the Danish actor who has played the most movie roles in danish filmhistory - acording to legend for many years refused to have played the part Barry'o'Sullivan in this movie makes it more fun to watch.

1830803,3,B00008973H,"I saw ""Journey...""in my own mind long before I saw it on the screen, courtesy of FJA's ""Spaceman"" magazine.  Too young to stay up late and watch it on Chiller Theater, I was lucky enough to attend a mid-sixties Saturday afternoon matinee showing it with ""The Angry Red Planet"".  Believe me, neither of these films looked cheap up on a 60 foot screen.  They were epic.  TV cuts everything off at the knees, but that first impression stays and its with that part of the mind that I can sit and watch a film that I would now probably turn off after the first 5 minutes.  However, the DVD is not the same film I saw way back then or what used to play on TV before it vanished.  I had hoped that by some miracle (it has happened), the original special effects would have been re-inserted.  Poor as these are supposed to have been, they at least would have made a better fit into the film than the re-shots.  I happen to have the original lobby cards and the pressbook, plus the aforementioned ""Spaceman"" as well as some bubble gum cards showing scenes not in the film and they don't really seem that bad.  One even indicates that there was a fifth astronaut; two of the others are shown investigating what appears to be the skeleton of a space-suited comrade.  This is not in the film.  What is different about this version is the demise of Karl (I think that was his name). Though he is supposedly absorbed by the brain at the end (actually, a recycled scene of Jack Kruschen's character's demise from ""Angry Red Planet"" (this was really noticeable when I saw both films back-to-back)), they no longer show the absorption.  Instead, everyone reacts to, what appears to be, an air filter sitting on a table, totally lifeless.  Not even a 60 foot screen could make that look epic.  Now why would anybody go to the trouble of making such a ridiculous substitution?  Ann Smyrner, unlike Greta Thyssen, is gorgeous.

""Invisible Invaders"", not being in color, wasn't quite as epic but it's also lodged in that dusty old drawer in my brain that can still look at it and say ""not great but I've seen worse"".  Even back then (I also saw it at a matinee, with ""Enemy From Space"")I would have shot Robert Hutton's whining, gutless character, the biggest drawback to this film.

1830804,5,B00008973H,"This is a wonderful double dose of silly sci-fi features from 1959 and 1962, the golden era of the genre. John Agar is a principal in both, and in both cases plays his role in his typical, formulaic, yet understated, way while chaos erupts around him and he takes on various monsters, including one with a ""honeycomb cyclops brain"".

In ""Invisible Invaders"" invisible invaders from the moon take over the corpse of scientist John Carradine who brings extra-terrestrial warnings from space to the protagonists of the film. (We also get to thrill to many Carradine voiceovers.) The Earth is engulfed in a stock footage war, but fortunate for us all, the brilliant cast is able to figure out not only how to make the aliens visible (it involves a latex bath, in part) but how to destroy them as well. (Whew!)

In ""Journey to the Seventh Planet"" John Agar and friends venture to Uranus in a ridiculously roomy spacecraft and discover lots of hilarious stock footage monsters (I am especially fond of the spider) and a brilliant opponent that can alter nature based on the memories of the humans. It is like a more primitive episode of ""Star Trek"" featuring John Agar as Kirk. This one is hysterical. It is set in the peaceful world of 2001, which is ruled by the brilliant and wise United Nations, and where everyone is happy and prosperous and there is no more war. (I will pause to let you collect yourselves now: I told you it was silly.) The film was made by the infamous Sid Pink in Denmark, with a mixed group of Danish and American actors. The result is a peculiar spectacle where only some voices are dubbed, It also features music you have no doubt heard in other movies of this ilk, most notably in ""Zontar, The Thing from Venus"" (also starring Agar, of course.)

1830807,4,B00008973H,"A two-for-one send up of silly b-movies.  Alien invaders and space exploration make up the themes of these tales of exploration and caution.
Invisible Invaders si about some aliens who have made themselves and their stuff invisible.  Atomic testing on Earth has pushed them to wanting to take over the Earth from their nearby base on the moon.  They will use the bodies of the dead to further their plans.  Either Earth must surrender or they will destroy all humans.  John Carradine is excellent as an animated corpse.  Although he is only on screen for a short time, his voice is used for most of the alien communications.  A small group in a scientific bunker must find a way to stop the invaders before all humans are killed.
Seventh Planet has a UN exploration team in 2001 traveling to Uranus to search for life.  None has been found on the nearer planets.  When the arrive they find themselves in a small region of German forest complete with village and beautiful women.  But the real answers lie on the real surface of the planet.  It was funny to see then traipsing though a forest and claim they still had not found any life (talk about not seeing the forest for the trees).  The pseudo Earth history is laughable at this time and sexism is very strong.  But it still has its moments with monsters, special effects, and outrageously bright color added because its in color (I love the spider with mustard and ketchup for blood).
B-movie fans should rejoice to get two movies for a reasonable price.  The only disadvantage of this DVD is that each film is on a different side so you can't watch them straight through.  But it does mean that the picture quality is very good.  The only special features are subtitles and the original trailers.",1059696000,33,1752,4.621359223300971
1830808,3,B00008973H,"Two schlocky sci-fi movies for the price of one?  I certainly give MGM credit for releasing these low end movies in this two for one format.  Let's see, Invisible Invaders...I would call this a mix of The Day The Earth Stood Still and Plan 9 From Outer Space, with the end result leaning much closer to Plan 9.  Apparently, aliens have been living on the moon for the last 20,000 years, and have decided the time was ripe to take over the Earth.  Thier timing had something to do with the the fact that the Earthlings are just beginning to harness the power of the atom.  They decide the best way to do this is by inhabiting the bodies of the recently deceased and sabotaging earths' ability to fight back and basically annihilate all earth men unless they surrender control of the planet to the aliens.  A small group, two scientists, the daughter of the older scientist, and an army major secure themselves away in a bunker in order to devise a plan on how to deal with the alien invaders, specifically for a way to make the aliens visible...I think....anyway, it's all hokey stuff.  John Caradine gets top billing, but he's only in the movie for about 4 minutes.  John Agar was the real star in this goofball movie.  The earth is coming to an end, and he still finds time to put the moves on the scientists daughter.  Funny stuff, a bit slow at times, and lots o' stock footage.  In the end, humanity prevails, and the aliens get their cumuppence.

Journey To The Seventh Planet...another Agar classic.  The movie starts out with a bit of narration telling us how it's the year 2001, there is no more war, and the Earth is governed by the UN...[insert joke here].  Anyway, an international group *cough cough* of astronauts have been tasked to explore the Seventh planet, Uranus.  On arriving, they discover the planet is very much like Earth with atmosphere, trees, grass, etc. , and it is all quite puzzling until they discover that a giant, pulsating space brain is manipulating them for its own nefarious purposes.  Once the astronauts discover what's going on and what the Giant Space Brains' plans are, they try to come up with a scheme to destroy it before it destroys them.  All of it is rather goofy, but I kinda enjoyed some of it.  I did like the stop motion on the rat monster.  It was nowhere near the level of Harryhausen,  it was nice to see, especially in this era of CGI.  John Agar is the star of this, and he plays a really frisky astronaut.  I mean, he seems like he is always taking about getting women or coming on to women (yes, the Giant Space Brain creates space babes from the astronauts memories).  Well, stuff happens, and the Giant Space Brain tries to destroy the astronauts with their own worst fears turned into reality.  You see, now that the Giant Space Brain has learned about earth from the minds of the astronauts, it wants to make the earth it's new home, and plans on hitching a ride with the astronauts or something like that.  In the end, humanity prevails, and the Giant Space Brain get its cumuppence.

I may be making these movies sound better than they are, but don't be fooled.  With both of these movies I had to take numerous breaks while watching because they made my little gray matter hurt, but I did get quite a few laughs from them.  Both movies are prime candidates for Mystery Science Theater 3000 (RIP).",1054166400,31,3362,4.521523178807947
1830809,4,B00008973H,"OK, they're both trashy. Still, the wonderfully self-gratuitous John Agar is here...TWICE!! ""Invisible Invaders"" is silly, but the transfer to DVD is quite good. John Carradine must've thought this was the end of his career, and it's a shame. He had a few decent performances left in him. But, with the help of Edward L.Cahn (often referred to as Ed Wood's less-talented little brother), he had nothing to do but glower and look tired. It's silly, and like all Cahn films, loads of trashy fun. I saw ""Journey to the 7th Planet"" as a kid, and not since. It's really not that bad, with a terrific premise. Unfortunately, the monsters and sci/fi stuff look mostly fake. There was a slight moment when the cyclops monster appeared and thought there might be a Ray Harryhausen moment (great stop-motion photography) but it only lasted a few seconds. Filmed in Denmark, with a Danish cast (all dubbed), Agar had an almost interesting role. He played second fiddle, and had a chance to actually give some character to the role. The women were absolutely gorgeous, starting with the lovely Greta Thyssen and not ending there. The plot, though contrived, was actually quite interesting in premise, a trip to Uranus and the concept of what was encountered. Like I said, I saw it as a kid and somehow always remembered this film and its idea. It's silly, fun & entertaining. Once again, I applaud MGM's ""Midnite Movies"" series for bringing more trashy fun to my house, and at a good price. (""Journey"" has a nice 1.85:1 Widescreen).",1053388800,7,1520,4.805343511450381
1830810,4,B00008973H,"At last, the ""Sid Pink Trilogy"" is available on DVD! Sid got his ticket punched when his ""Angry Red Planet"" did well at the Saturday-matinee box office, and went on to direct the (in)famous ""Reptilicus"". (See my reviews of THOSE two, also here on Amazon.) Enamored with the Danish locations of that film epic, Pink decided his next film, ""Journey to the 7th Planet"", would be made there, too. The entire film was shot on a 22 by 44 foot soundstage (except for the stock footage and ""special effects"") for a total cost of $75,000 - and $25,000 of that went to Agar and the female lead, Gretta Thyssen! As a result, we get a spaceship with a wood-plank floor, a few scrap ejection seats, and LOTS of primary-color displays. Pink picked Uranus as the destination because he believed that it was unknown enough that he could depict ANY sort of environment and be able to get away with it. The plot owes a lot to Ray Bradbury's short story ""Mars is Heaven!"", wherein the crew of a ship landing on Mars is greeted by family and relatives in an old-fashioned front-porch-and-lemonade village. In ""Journey"", the crew meets up with assorted Danish femme fatales in a thatched-roofs-and-cocoa Danish village, all manifestations of a giant cave-dwelling brain intent on hitching a ride back to Earth with the ship. Fans of ""Reptilicus"" will recognize most of the rest of the cast, all of whom needed to have their voices dubbed because of their Danish accents. Superb print, outstanding rendering of the hallucinatory color schemes, and great fun all around.
""Invisible Invaders"" was entirely new to me, and if you excised the stock footage, the film would be about 20 minutes long. Although willowy John Carradine gets top billing and a prominent feature on the cover, he's on-screen for less than 2 minutes. After being killed in an explosion at an atomic-weapons plant, invisible aliens who have been living on the moon for 20,000 years take over his body (as if there would be anything left to take over.) Hey, *I* didn't write it, OK? These ""invisible invaders"" shuffle around looking for corpses to inhabit so that they can carry out nefarious deeds of sabotage, since they don't actually have any weapons of their own. It's up to John Agar (wearing an ill-fitting flight suit and a flight cap seventeen sizes too small for him) and co-star Philip Tonge to find a way to defeat these poseurs from their underground bunker (actually the same cave in Bronson Canyon that ""Robot Monster"" was filmed in!) Again, a really nice, clean print (except for the stock footage, which varies wildly in quality) and a painless way to pass an hour. Recommended for all you fans of John Agar *and* the immortal Sid Pink.
Just one question - why is there an empty pair of shoes on the cover of the DVD case?",1052092800,65,2785,4.7207392197125255

Agar (Major Jay) and some scientists work feverishly to find a way to stop the invasion. Good 50's sci-fi.

You can't see me

It is the 50's and Dr. Karol Noymann (John Carradine) is messing around with atomics and gets irradiated. His carcass is buried. His friend Dr. Adam Penner (Philip Tonge) and co-worker decides his demise is not from any radiation but from trying to use it for military purposes.

Invisible beings who own the universe figure it is time to invade earth as they are getting too uppity with their new found atomics and rockets. So the give Dr. Adam Penner self comfiest pacifist the chance to spread the news of surrender or die. To get their point across they barrow Dr. Karol Noymann's carcass for a farewell performance.

The movie has all the standard sci-fi clichs and formula where the girl half betrothed to the wimp second in command really goes for the strong willed military type.

Lots of stock film and a ""Plan 9"" feel make this a film classic. No mater how campy if your are a kid this is one spooky movie.
