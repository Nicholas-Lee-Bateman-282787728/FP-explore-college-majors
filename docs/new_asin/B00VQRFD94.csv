8710942,4,B00VQRFD94,"Script and plot loopholes are large enough to drive a Conestoga wagon through, but that's not why you want to buy this Western. You want this one because Dan Duryea is at his psychotic raving best as a confused/demented vainglorious ex-Confederate officer rapidly losing his grip on reality. He does not disappoint. What you need to know is that the widescreen source print is excellent, offering beautiful color and lots of well-composed location shots. Watch this one as a double bill with Joseph Cotton playing a similar role in Sergio Corbucci's HELLBENDERS for a maniacal ex-Confederate officer gone bonkers film fest.",1503619200,,623,5.178217821782178

8710944,3,B00VQRFD94,This is one of the weakest Dan Duryea westerns. In glorious technicolor but nevertheless this does not compensate for a poor movie.,1439078400,4,131,5.0
8710945,5,B00VQRFD94,Dan Duryea is at his best in this dramatic western. We both enjoyed Dan's antics in this movie.,1437091200,4,95,4.333333333333333
