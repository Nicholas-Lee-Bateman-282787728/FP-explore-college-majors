They covered the many cities, markets, islands, lakes, both Caribbean and Pacific ocean seashores, volcanoes, the rain forest and cloud forest ecosystems, wildlife, the people, resorts, snorkeling, fishing, kayaking, surfing, sailing, history, etc., all done in a delightful and enthusiastic manner.

My copy was shipped from Nicaragua, so it took a few extra days, but it arrived in great shape with the envelope covered in beautiful Nicaraguan postage stamps. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone thinking about a visit, or just wanting to learn more about this hidden paradise in Central America.",1298505600,,743,5.452173913043478
8214113,4,B000UO93ZO,"I was a little nervous ordering this product after reading the reviews by people that waited a month or more to get the DVD. They apparently solved the problem because I got mine in about 3 days. It was shipped from the USA, not Nicaragua.

As far as the product goes, it was better than I expected. I thought it would be very kid oriented but I watched it through and aside from a few awkward moments, it is a very good overview of Nicaragua.

My favorite scene: the female teenage host sitting poolside drinking what looks to be a glass of wine. I'm not sure what the drinking age is in Nicaragua.",1209427200,,599,4.292035398230088
8214114,5,B000UO93ZO,This video is very well done. The best one I've seen done about Nicaragua.  It does an excellent job in showing Nicaragua's colonial and geographical history. It also shows and teaches you some of the country's ecological and environmental attractions.  I highly recommend this for anyone who has never visited Nicaragua or for those who are planing to make a trip down there to check it out.  I hope they do a part 2 soon.,1201132800,,423,4.613333333333333
8214115,5,B000UO93ZO,"It could be the best tourism documentary Ive seen on Nicaragua....saw some clips on its web page adventuresinnicaraguadvd.com and it looked awesome!

I will buy it as soon as it comes out!",1186099200,,188,4.875
