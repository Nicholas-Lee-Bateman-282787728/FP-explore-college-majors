8707214,5,B00UKG7H9Q,"I have an earlier version that was available several years ago and am delighted to see this series return. This is one of the finest versions available concerning Israeli Combat Shooting. I have all of Garret Machine's DVDs and AGIs Israeli Instinctive Combat Shooting. If you are looking to complete your training collection you need this set. It is well done and very easy to watch. However it is very basic in its presentation. There are no one hand manipulations, jam drills,closing distance, kneeling or barricade shooting. For these you will have to get Machine's DVDs. But when you get this one you won't be disappointed. If you are serious about learning the Israeli Draw this series is a must. Buy them as a complete set.",1429574400,,730,4.801587301587301
