4573664,2,B0055CP9XG,"Now I know that anyone can make a movie.  The grainy black and white filming was interesting, and really didn't add to the movie.  It's like they said ""We'll save money if it's not in color"".",1379116800,,191,4.277777777777778
4573665,5,B0055CP9XG,"AWESOME movie! I loved the black and white effect, the background music, and even though it starts out slow, the suspense keeps building.  I enjoyed the campy horror towards the end, and finally, a movie with a hippie dude as the main character.  It is intense, and not quit the ending  was expecting.",1377993600,2,301,4.6415094339622645
4573666,3,B0055CP9XG,"For the budget I'd say it is five stars.  Lots to like about his film.  The acting is a bit spotty but interesting and really good in places, same with the story. I'm going to check out the actors and director to see what else they've done.  It's an odd little film that manages to keep you from shutting it down and moving on.  If you really like the genre and don't expect major production values this might float your boat.  Watch it for a few minutes and see if you aren't hooked.",1376006400,,484,4.161290322580645
4573667,3,B0055CP9XG,"On a budget, but it does not show much.  Very good story and acting.  Watched the whole movie in one sitting.  Enjoyable.  Good old fashion horror story.  Again, well done, and worth watching.",1374710400,5,192,4.696969696969697
4573668,3,B0055CP9XG,"So this is nothing what I was expecting when I started it up. However, it is a pretty good story. It is kind of an art house film but the main character really pulls this story off.",1374451200,6,181,3.918918918918919
4573669,4,B0055CP9XG,"This movie is not ""The Shining"".  Then again, it's not meant to be.  Consider this a low budget gem for those dark and stormy nights when candlelight and microwave popcorn are all you can afford.  Director Jon Springer delivers a cinematic look and feel heavily influenced by David Lynch, Fritz Lang, and Alfred Hitchcock during his Universal years. Lead actor and ""American Movie"" veteran, Mark Borchardt, uses his monotone, deadpan delivery to validate Springer's handheld, monochrome cinematography.  The movie is set in a condemned Midwestern brownstone apartment building, the Hagstone, which sports a surrounding architectural decay that delivers all the charm of a mid-century columbarium.  Borchardt is the Hagstone's superintendant, a dismal failure of a man haunted both by his wife's suicide and visions of her ghost.  Beset upon by alcoholism, prostitutes, pimps, a Priest-in-law, Satanists, ghosts, demons, secret rooms, drugged drinks, and stopped toilets, Borchardt's character battles to defeat the encroaching Evil that haunts both his soul and the building he supervises. Memorable contributions by co-stars Nadine Gross, Cyndi Kurtz, Sasha Andreev, and especially Jay Smiley add to the pervasively creepy authenticity.  There is no great acting in this flick, but the actors are credible in their roles with each actor appropriately cast.  A good example is actor Jay Smiley.  We quickly come to realize that something is seriously wrong with the character he's portraying (if not Jay Smiley himself) and, as the plot unfolds, we are not disappointed.  An entertainingly devious plot is sufficiently developed to keep horror fans engaged throughout.  Highly atmospheric with some genuinely creepy moments, you might even turn the lights back on after one scene in particular.  However, if your cinematic thrill is sitting in the front row with friends heckling bad movies, and there are certainly a couple of scenes which qualify, you'll have to wait for the remake of ""Ishtar"" to have your jollies, for this is a stalwart ""B"" grade horror movie of which the filmmakers can be proud.",1371427200,8,2102,5.375
4573670,4,B0055CP9XG,"What amazes me about films like this, is that the people behind it are able to do so much with so little- that is what makes this a very good film- not great, but very good.  If you just want to be entertained, it might not be your bag, but if you are interested in mixing genres (horror and film noir in this case) it is definitely worth watching.  Jon Springer and his cohorts show great potential.",1368748800,6,400,4.181818181818182
4573671,4,B0055CP9XG,"The black and white photography and several direct nods to Romero's early camera angles make The Hagstone Demon a fun little movie. Filmed on a small budget and time constraints, acting sometimes has the one and done feeling to it. Despite its faults, horror fans (and fans of the documentary American Movie) will find this worthwhile.",1367280000,4,335,5.0
4573672,1,B0055CP9XG,"Horrible acting, laughable production. I didn't make it past the first 20 minutes. This movie is a waste of time.",1364342400,2,113,4.7
4573673,1,B0055CP9XG,"Not worth a rental, not worth the time I spent watching it free as an Amazon Prime member. Just awful. Juvenile directing, poor cinematography..........just poor..........dreadfully poor",1364256000,2,186,6.1923076923076925
4573677,2,B0055CP9XG,"ONE GREAT THING IS THAT THIS IS NOT A ""FOUND FOOTAGE"" MOVIE!

Filmed with grayscale effect and at some scenes it will go into full colour. Yes, it will go into full colour especially on those scenes that has upper body nudity. In terms of demon characteristics of the characters, I find it weird how a succubus is portrayed in the film. Succubus does not make a dead person comes alive!

Exorcism does not work as it is portrayed in the movie. Demons don't die. It can only be banished. And you have to make the demon tell you its name to banish it.

The following are what I found good in the movie:
-Audio overlay throughout the movie
-Yay! Not one of those handheld camera movies :D

The following are what I found to be no good in the movie:
-How the story escalated
-Lack of research regarding demons and spirits
-Sexual scenes are the ""honey trap"" of the movie; you don't need those scenes in a good horror movie!
-Please stick to one video format; either grayscale or colour but not both!",1402617600,,995,4.391304347826087
4573678,1,B0055CP9XG,"Sometimes a bad movie is so bad it redeems it's self by just being campy fun.  This movie doesn't.  It's just bad in a boring, low budget way with no entertainment.",1402099200,,164,4.258064516129032

4573680,1,B0055CP9XG,"I only finished this movie because I am sick and have be bed ridden for almost a week now... Even, then. I should have just turned it off and stared at the ceiling fan. Do your self a favor and skip this one. It is not even good as a ""good"" bad movie. It is just boring and a bit painful to watch. Nothing at the end will excite you or justify the time spent.",1399766400,2,359,3.8
4573681,3,B0055CP9XG,"reminded me of the old seventies B-movies, yeah the acting is bad but I thought it was weird enough to be watchable.",1398297600,,116,4.318181818181818

4573684,3,B0055CP9XG,"Would be better ranked at 2.5 stars. Laughably over the top, but played straight and with total sincerity. There is something almost endearing about this low budget (and confusing) demon horror that somehow keeps it just on the side of watchability",1385337600,4,248,5.073170731707317
4573685,1,B0055CP9XG,"This is a badly made movie. Bad story, bad plot and terrible acting. It amazes me that movies this awful actually get made and distributed.",1382054400,2,139,4.6
4573686,4,B0055CP9XG,"Quirky, different kind of possession genre.  A more than slightly entertaining, low budget horror flick. Not as bad as the title suggests, but not really in the league of the Excorcist",1380844800,,184,4.935483870967742
8457969,5,B0055CP9XG,"Superior horror/drama with a real feel to it. Plus, it was a treat to see Mark Borchardt in this movie.",1454889600,,103,4.2
8457970,5,B0055CP9XG,Mark is a cool actor an director. Check out his American Movie. I have met him and he is also nice to his fans.,1429401600,,111,3.6666666666666665
8457971,4,B0055CP9XG,"There's a very strong vein of American Horror Story running through the overall persona of this movie, which is not a bad thing.

It's very quirky and intriguing and at times disturbing in a surreal sort of way; the camera work is very good which is naturally integral to establishing and sustaining the twisted film noir atmosphere in which the plot is set.
The plot itself is somewhat vague and haphazard; not quite sure how else to put it, but overall this film manages to capture your attention and draw you into it's world of muted somnambulistic madness.",1423008000,,560,4.714285714285714
8457972,3,B0055CP9XG,"I'm giving this a very weak 3 star review.  I can't go down to 2, because I actually liked the movie for the most part.  The film was on it's way to a solid 3 stars, maybe even a 4, up until the ending.  The ending was so nonsensical and poorly done that it nearly killed the entire experience.

First off, this is a low budget film.  While the scenery is quite beautiful, the special effects are mostly acceptable, and the overall production is decent, the budget shows in the lead actor.  Most of the cast gave a decent performance, but the lead was just not there.

From his monotonous dialogue delivery to his rigor mortis like body language, Mark Borchardt's character, Douglas, is the weakest link in a chain already plagued by budget restraints. it was like a 5th grader with stage fright trying to play Norman Bates in the school play after he already pooped his pants.  There was no real emotion conveyed at any time, so much so that I began to suspect that Douglas has severe Asperger's with a touch of Down's.  (If that was supposed to be the case, then Mr. Borchardt should have won an Oscar)

***Stop here if you don't want some minor spoilers***

Cyndi Kurtz performed well as Barbara, but the character just didn't make any sense.  We have the basics: CNA working hard to raise her son on her own... but how in the world would that possibly translate into her being so desperate that she would fall for an unattractive alcoholic apartment handyman with major emotional baggage and obvious mental illness?  The woman could find better at the local homeless shelter, for sure.  But no, she just loves this complete mess of a manchild so much that she is willing to put herself in harm's way for him, risking making her son an orphan.  On second thought, Barbara is an idiot and her son should be taken by child services immediately.

As for the overall story, if this movie had been made in the 70's with a stronger lead and a better ending, it might be held in the same regard as such gothic horror classics as Rosemary's Baby.  It has moments that are intense enough to draw you in, daring you to figure out what is really going on, only to twist in another direction a scene or two later.  Unfortunately, the ending didn't make my attention to details pay off, instead making me feel as if I'd been part of a practical joke where they had intentionally left something very important out of the first 2 hours of the movie so that I could never understand the final showdown.  Don't take my word for this, give the movie a fair chance and you might be surprised.

 As it stands, it's a decent movie for a lazy night in, preferably with a few friends and a case of beer.  You can have your own  MST3K or Cinematic Titanic style yelling at the screen party.",1416355200,,2769,4.43960396039604
8457973,1,B0055CP9XG,"Terrible acting, terrible dialogue, terrible direction, terrible everything. Don't waste your time on this one. Even if you enjoy bad horror, you should just skip this one.",1414540800,,172,5.407407407407407
