3029228,5,B000YHMTGC,great received it and enjoyed all the shows will be buying more to go with my collection in few months,1381363200,,102,4.15
3029229,5,B000YHMTGC,"I own all of this series.  The storyline has three old now single men who are living out their later days.  The first series begins in 1974 and continues to series 24.  If you can think of a silly and/or funny situation for three old men, this series seems to have it.  A companion series ""First Of The Summer Wine"" which ran from 1988-1989 is a must if you really want to better enjoy the show.  It introduces the stars when they are young men just before WWII.  Certainly one of the better British comedy shows.",1367452800,2,513,4.291666666666667

8232840,5,B000YHMTGC,"I'm rating it a 5 because I'm SURE I would have liked it at least as much as I liked all of the other series that I've seen.  BUT, I had to return it because the DVD was the European version and wouldn't play on my machine.  Luckily I noticed that before I opened it.  It was my fault.......Amazon clearly listed it as not playable in the U. S. but I missed it.  They took it back with no problems.",1489968000,,398,3.9375
8232841,2,B000YHMTGC,"Sound quality is always a big problem with this series.  It's still entertaining and humorous though.  I've stopped buying the Summer Wine items simply because they are continuously, and massively raising the price for them, especially the holidays series.  I've decided that they are not worth the price hassle.  I'll check prices again in 4 or 5 years and see if they have returned to normal.  If, not, I'll continue purchasing alternatives as there are several to choose from.",1485993600,,479,5.012658227848101

8232847,5,B000YHMTGC,"One of the very best television shows ever made! I fell in love with this show from American PBS television. I've noticed that the American DVD versions have some scenes cut when compared to the PBS airings! I also have seen that the UK DVD's are the full episodes, so I bought a zone-free blue-ray player and have ordered the UK DVD's in hopes of experiencing the whole, unedited versions of as many episodes as I can find! I especially love the first two groupings with Compo, Clegg,, & Blamire or Foggy!",1413072000,2,506,4.510869565217392
