not feeling like I'm killing myself. There are 2 levels. I don't like that they switch the front view, then side
view, then back, I get confused left and right. I like Ellen Barrett she calls her left my right so I can follow
better...I've been doing her workout for 20 years and it still is my favorite.",1395532800,4,410,4.269230769230769
