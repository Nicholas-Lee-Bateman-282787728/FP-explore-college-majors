5271994,5,B0095Y3YHI,"on all the movies I purchase through Amazon, I will let my 5 star ratings be my evaluation, John Wayne never made a bad movie, nor Jimmy Stewart, and even the WWII hero (Audie Murphy) makes fine westerns Gary Cooper has a charm about him that no other cowboy can match, so if you are into westerns, you will like all of these, if I give less than 4 or 5 star rating, then either the movie was awful or there is something wrong with the dvd, and in the latter case I will write about that.",1481500800,,488,4.041237113402062

5272008,4,B0095Y3YHI,"Bought this for the superior FURY AT SHOWDOWN..Along came Jones is a good movie too, but Gerd Oswald (who directed most  of The best OUTER LIMITS episodes)  inventive direction, superior camera movement and composition, not to mention his getting a great pair of performances from John Derek and Nick Adams...An 8 day masterpiece shot by Oscar winning cinematographer Joseph LaShelle (LAURA) and a nice music score from the always undervalued Harry Sukman.",1418515200,6,456,5.319444444444445

5272010,5,B0095Y3YHI,How lucky to be the most beautiful and graceful actress and then to be able to play opposite Gary Cooper,1403481600,,104,4.25
5272011,5,B0095Y3YHI,I had a person wanting to see this movie and luckily Amazon had it. It came quickly and everyone really liked the old western. I am glad to see the crowd gather to see a real old western instead of the new fake ones. Much thanks!,1401321600,,229,4.0
5272012,3,B0095Y3YHI,"An intereting Double Bill at a good price. ""FURY.."" is excellent quality -Picture and sound, 4.3 Ratio. ""Jones"" not quite such a good transfer, but perfectly watchable (say 8/10) and good sound, 4.3 Ratio. Sadly that's abpot all I can say that isn't negative. I bought this only for ""Fury At Showdown"" a western I hadn't seen fo 30 years or more and remebered as being rather good. Unfortunately, I found it mostly boring and miscast. John Derek and Nick Adams shouldn't perhaps have made westerns, and Carolyn Craig never pushed my buttons (Gloria Talbott where were you, or did you read the script?). The only actor for me was John Smith who makes an excellent villain (see REBEL IN TOWN), and he has a humdinger of a fight with Derek surely on a par with the Donnybrooks in ""Shane"" and ""The Spoilers. The problem is that this and the badly handled climax are the only bits of real action. It is nearly a pretty good film, but if I am tempted to fast forward it isn't that good. But Derek, Adams and Smith do have their followers as does director Gerd Oswald, and it is a long lost film, and a good price so don't take my opinion for it too much to heart. Oh Boy, that brings me on to the ""Main"" feature, and probably the reason most people will buy this Double Bill. ALONG CAME JONES is a big disapointment...It was back then and several decades have not improved it. The lousy back projection, cheap studio sets, miscasting and poor script, plus Cooper's very odd mannerisms, and a failed attempts at comedy mixed with drama make this one to miss...Unless you are a Cooper dedicated fan. Sorry!",1393891200,4,1598,4.5137931034482754
5272013,5,B0095Y3YHI,"Gary Cooper and William Demarest (not sure of the spelling) have a very clever dialogue throughout the film.  Of course, Gary Cooper, shines.  I thought Loretta Young was miscast, but I continue to watch this because of Gary Cooper. I didn't watch the other film ""Fury at Showdown""",1385510400,,281,4.833333333333333
5272014,5,B0095Y3YHI,"Every birthday I attend, the hat is given to the birthday honorary. It is animated, and plays music.  It will be the life of the party.",1381363200,,135,4.1923076923076925
5272015,5,B0095Y3YHI,Along came Jones is a funny and well done western. Fury at showdown is not worth seeing. I bought the pack because it is cheaper to buy this way that just along came Jones.,1377475200,2,172,4.088235294117647
5272016,5,B0095Y3YHI,"I saw this movie years ago and I mean years ago and loved it. Saw it on line and ordered it immediately. First disk was damaged, however you sent another and have watched the movie several times.",1375574400,2,195,4.297297297297297
5272017,2,B0095Y3YHI,"This is a very cheaply made film, just like a typical B-western. Though the artists are supposed to be good and usually are, the result is ""tepid"", as Michael Pitts says in his Western Movies book. It was filmed almost totally in studio which shows all the time. Perhaps Cooper's money run out (He was a producer). This film is also amazingly violent in order to be comedy. Number of killings is high and even Cooper gets badly battered. Along Came Jones was neither amusing or exciting. I could watch it, though, because all kind of things were happening without breaks. Cooper's westerns are very uneven. Some are great, some just average or poor like this one. - Fury at Showdown I have not watched yet. I will review it later.",1373673600,,730,4.580152671755725
5272018,3,B0095Y3YHI,"I bought this DVD for the Gary Cooper movie, Along Came Jones, as I had never seen it. Gary Cooper is one of my all-time favorite actors. The film is entertaining, but is not a great film. If you like Gary Cooper, you will watch it for his lightly humorous performance. It is a comedy of mixed-up identities, but with some western violence (guns, shooting, death) thrown in as well. Loretta Young is beautiful; William Demarest is the typical western sidekick; and Dan Duryea plays his usual wonderful, evil villain character. If you don't like westerns, or, if you don't know who Gary Cooper and Loretta Young are, then you probably will not like this film. I recommend it to other ""old folks"" who remember Cooper, Demarest, Young, and Duryea and who can still enjoy a film of the former type, without the modern special effects.",1371772800,9,830,4.691780821917808
5272019,5,B0095Y3YHI,"This was a gift and I love both movies. First of all these transfers are great. TGG Direct did a great job on these two movies. Both movies are in Full frame format, B&W and there are no special features or other audio language and no subtitles. Plus ""Fury at Showdown"" has never been on DVD and this is it's first appearance.

""Along Came Jones"" (1945/90mins)
Gary Cooper, Loretta Young, William Demarest, Dan Duryea, Frank Sully; Directed by Stuart Heisler
""Fury at Showdown"" (2957/75mins)
John Derek, John Smith, Carolyn Craig, Nick Adams; Directed by Gerd Oswald
