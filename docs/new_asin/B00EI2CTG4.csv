5915094,2,B00EI2CTG4,"Vol. 1, 2, 3, 4.,  Coll. 1, 2, 3, 4,  I have been collecting Gene Autry movies for several years and when I look at all the Gene Autry movies available here I never know if I already have them or not.  Total confusion.  That's why I don't order them.

It would take hours to go through my collection to find out all the Gene Autry titles I have, and over 3000 other titles.  And then to top it off the titles on some of these Gene Autry sets that are on display do not show the titles, just a collection or volume number.

I've always liked Gene Autry.  He's 5' 9"" and can beat the crap out of a 6' 4"" outlaw without losing his hat.  Can't get better than that.  But alas, I have duplicated several Gene Autry titles along with other major western actors, and don't fancy the idea of doing more of it.

It would help other collectors if titles were added to the sets so they would not duplicate what they already have.  But let's get real,  it's not gonna happen.  SD",1402704000,2,967,4.101604278074866

5915099,5,B00EI2CTG4,"Gene continues his collection in this volume four with four more movies for your western enjoyment. Gene and the gang has to deal with fur smugglers, a tractor dealer,

deadly cattle weed and card sharks.

These are your typical western movies but I never get sick of listening to Gene's singing, and there are 26 songs in this set, but not all of them are sung by Gene.

Staring Gene Autry (of course), Pat Buttram, Smiley Burnette and a host of others, these movies should be added to your collection of Westerns. Be warned though, your

feet may start tapping the floor as you watch the movies and Pat Buttram is his usual self, getting himself into situations of a comic nature.

The collection contains ""The Old Barn Dance"", ""Blue Montana Skies"", ""Sierra Sue"" and ""Cowboy Serenade"", which were filmed between 1936 and 1942. They have not lost their vitality and enjoyment over the last 70 odd years.

Grab a copy and get lost in a time when cap-guns were all the rage and dead cowboys turned up in the next movie.

These movies get top marks from me as I always enjoy Gene's singing, and I don't think you will be disappointed by choosing to add this one to your collection. Don't forget that they are on region free discs.",1391126400,,1228,4.529411764705882

8605462,5,B00EI2CTG4,"These movies are one each from 1938, 1939, 1941, and 1942. They are all enjoyable movies typical of Gene's pre-war style.

The picture and sound quality are excellent, as usual. The bonus features offer additional insight into the making of the movies.

THE OLD BARN DANCE has more music than the other three. I was particularly interested in seeing The Stafford Sisters because one of them is Jo Stafford, my all-time favorite female singer. Their number is a hick comedy song with the girls dressed in such outlandish hillbilly costumes you can scarcely recognize them. Try to guess which one is Jo. You will see her again late in the movie when she appears in normal dress on stage at the fair. Walter Shrum and his Colorado Hillbillies, and the Maple City Four keep the hillbilly music going.

Roy Rogers, billed as Dick Weston, can be heard calling a square dance but otherwise is not seen. He originally had a song in the movie, but when the movie was re-released several years later he was by then a big star and his song was edited out.

SIERRA SUE is the movie where Smiley Burnette is the Human Cannonball and is shot out of a cannon. Eddie Dean has a small role as a crop duster pilot whose plane is shot down and Eddie bails out. Kermit Maynard and Rex Lease have small roles.

COWBOY SERENADE is another good movie. It features Tris Coffin and Hank Worden in early roles. Smiley, in drag, has a funny scene. I enjoyed seeing Tris Coffin because in the late Seventies, he appeared at a western film festival in San Diego. At the banquet, he joined two other fans and me at our table and told us interesting stories about his days in the westerns.  He was an amiable and pleasant gentleman. Gene sings ""Sweethearts or Strangers"", a song that became a hit in the Fifties by Faron Young and was the title of one of his record albums.",1416873600,2,1842,4.5
