7730672,4,B01E606F7G,"This film is an extremely simple, clean version of the Holy Family's life that ends with Joseph's death.  The action is slow paced and shows no violence or actual strife/worry in the family's life, even during King Herod's persecution or Jesus' disappearance before being found in the temple.  This is just too unrealistic for adult viewers.  With that said, I believe the film would be good for children and fairly innocent pre-teens.",1472860800,,435,5.013888888888889

7730677,5,B01E606F7G,"There have been a number of movies about Mary & Joseph and the birth of Jesus,but none have told the story the way this movie does. It centers around Elijah,who swears vengeance after Herod's soldiers kill two boys he had promised to protect. However,after meeting Joseph,Mary and the young Jesus,his thoughts wavered and he is torn between hatred and forgiveness. Kevin Sorbo is awesome in the role of Joseph and he really captured his essence-he was chosen to be Jesus'earthly father,and while he didn't understand why, he was willing to trust God and carry out the responsibility of being a father to The Son of God.. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie and in the day & time in which we live,it couldn't be more timely!",1468713600,9,725,4.808
7730678,4,B01E606F7G,"Thank you BH Impact for sending us this DVD to review!

Most Christians are familiar with Marys role in submitting to Gods will and bringing our savior into this world.  She agreed to carry the Lords child knowing that her future marriage and life would be endangered as a result.  Because of a dream Joseph received from the Lord, he knew that her pregnancy was indeed a miracle and continued the engagement knowing that his reputation would suffer as a result.  The movie Joseph and Mary doesnt focus on the angelic visit and begins with Joseph (Kevin Sorbo) crafting a wooden cradle for their future baby.

While the Bible doesnt specify the ages of Mary and Joseph, Im willing to bet that they were much younger than the actors used to play their roles in this film.  Im also willing to wager that they were not Caucasian either.  The miscasting continues in the temple scene with Simeon and Anna. Their actors are much too young for their roles.  Both of them were promised to see the Messiah before they died and Anna was in her eighties when she saw baby Jesus.

The acting is still decent regardless of their ages and the main story of the revenge seeking rabbi, Elijah, is pretty good.  King Herods taxes are causing an uproar and people who resist paying taxes are made examples of.  Rebekahs husband, Aaron, is killed in front of her despite Elijahs attempts of appeasing the tax collector.  The husbands dying wish is that Elijah takes care of his wife and he does so.  Her oldest son grows fond of Elijah and they become a family.  That is until Herod demands the deaths of young male children.  Rebekah vows vengeance on the soldier that carried out Herods orders on her family and she pressures Elijah into killing him on her behalf.

Elijah refers to the Deuteronomy 19 verse 21 which states a life for a life and an eye for an eye for agreeing to kill this legionnaire.  Joseph is trying to convince Elijah to forgive the man and have compassion on him instead.  As Jesus grows up and speaks in the temple, Elijah is convinced that theres something different about this child and starts to believe that Hes the Messiah.  Can he accept Christs teachings and learn to forgive?  Ill leave the rest for you see for yourself in this hour and twenty-two-minute film.

Because this film deals with the murder of innocents, there are some violence scenes. Other than those moments, this film is family friendly and teaches a good moral lesson.",1468108800,8,2452,4.61662817551963
7730679,1,B01E606F7G,"if you just watch the trailer and then go to luke 2:41-52, you can see this is not a biblical movie at all.  He didn't learn the scriptures from his adoptive father, He was born with all knowledge He had before He entered within the flesh.  I'm honestly disappointed in kevin.",1512777600,,276,4.392156862745098

7730681,5,B01E606F7G,Just a wonderful rendition of Joseph and Mary's story.,1504656000,,54,5.111111111111111
7730682,1,B01E606F7G,"This story is non biblical at its core. This is a work of fiction that should have never been associated with Jesus. Very little is said about Jesus as a child and he was certainly not an only child. The acting was poor, the story line was very weak and completely inaccurate. I was surprised that Kevin was in a story that strayed so far from the word after the last few he had been in.

If you are going to let your children watch this them be sure they and you both realize this is a work of fiction. The only part of this story that resembled the Bible at all was that Jesus was born to Joseph and Mary during the census and that Herod ordered the killing of all male children through 2 years old and that being warned in a Dream Joseph did not return home for a few years. Everything else is pure fiction.",1501372800,,810,4.09433962264151
7730683,5,B01E606F7G,I really liked this story...more in depth of what was going on in society at the time when Jesus was young.  And a glimpse into what Joseph and Mary had to go through with Jesus as a son.  Thought provoking.,1496102400,,207,4.15

7730687,2,B01E606F7G,"Not recommended in any sense.
Story line was accurate in the sense that Joseph was a protector of the child Jesus and cared for his physical well being as any father should.  But it veers away from Christian beliefs by seeming to indicate that Jesus was taught his religious message by Joseph; e.g Joseph counsels a friend to ""turn the other cheek"". Christians believe that Jesus's teachings were inspired directly by God, His heavenly Father.
Moreover, the story was plodding, and showed lower than normal production values.",1486944000,,525,5.0344827586206895

7730706,2,B01E606F7G,"Very low budget, poor acting, poor costumes, historical innaccuracies, poor scripting, the faults are endless. However, the only saving grace this film has, is the plot and subplot. It is very interesting! Puts a completely different twist on the real story.  If not for the interesting plot/subplot, this film would have been a total waste of money, and could be a cure for insomnia. It was headed down that path, when the storyline ""picked up"" a bit.
I'm not sure why all these Christian movies have to be so subpar.  Why can't somebody spend the money and do it properly!",1474156800,,574,4.73
