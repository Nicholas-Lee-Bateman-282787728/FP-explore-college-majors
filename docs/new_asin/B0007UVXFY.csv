8052020,5,B0007UVXFY,"Good songs, I had been looking particularly for ""All The Raindrops"" song.  However, this dvd presentation is more of a performance or show one takes children to, not an actual full length episode as in the child care format on tv.  There is a live audience participating, and songs are presented as such.",1485561600,,304,4.716981132075472
