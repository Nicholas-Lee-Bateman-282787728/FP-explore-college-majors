The exercises are done slowly (which takes strength, concentration, and awareness).

This has been a help in improving my posture.  I am 78 years old, and keeping a strong straight spine while walking has become a challenge.

I think this combo of book and DVD would be useful for younger people too.  Never too soon to understand how your body works.  And make sure the deepest muscles are engaged.

P.S. I bought the KINDLE ed. Apparently the paper ed comes with a DVD (who knew!) - However, Moira Stott, on this DVD,  was Colleen Craig's teacher! And it would be interesting to compare the DVDs.",1353974400,,1112,5.993670886075949
8053255,4,B0007XBM3O,"I've never used the big stability ball, so Core Balance was a fine, basic intro for me.  I found the directions thorough and the cuing perfect.  The pace was slow, even for a basic workout.  Get used to stretching your whole body over the ball, lying prone on the ball in various positions, and stabilizing sitting on the ball gripping your feet into the mat.  They did the challenging leg series leaning against the ball, complete with leg kicks to the front and back, leg raises and leg circles.  Mermaid stretches on the ball felt great.  The shoulder bridges were shaky b/c the ball moved, and it was a bit tough on the glutes and hamstrings, but it was doable.  At the end, I felt accomplished, and I actually wanted to go on to the next Stott stability ball DVD.",1347667200,,768,4.442857142857143
8053256,4,B0007XBM3O,"This cover indicates this is a level 1 DVD - I assume that means for people without experience doing ball pilates and for people who are not avid exercisers who are already in great physical shape.  And, that is what it delivers.  The cuing is good, the instructions are clear for the most part, the instructors have calm clear voices, the transitions are reasonable, and the production quality is fine.  There is an intro that explains the basics that you can avoid in the future.  Since I've done a few classes, I am not sure if the intro explains everything you'd need if you were completely new, bit it seems thorough.

The exercises are appropriate for someone who is capable of doing sit-ups, stretches, etc.  That said, some of the harder exercises could not be done by someone who was out of shape in the ""core"" area.

I avoid some of the exercises because I have a chronic knee condition and the specific segments hurt my knee.  I either keep doing the last exercise or fast forward (though I'd much prefer a video that addresses knee injuries so I wouldn't have to fast forward).  Of the four ball videos I have (all relatively new to me), this one has the most exercises I can do without hurting my knee.  On one I have, I cannot do over half of the exercises, so I appreciate this one.

All in all, it's not perfect, but it's solid and works well for its intended audience.  If you are toned, fit or do other ab work or yoga, this is most likely not for you. If you like hyped instruction, a fast workout, or to work at a more frenetic pace, this is also probably not for you.  If you like a calmer approach and are recovering from an injury, have been out of condition for awhile, or have never worked out, this will probably be just fine.  You may find the end of it a bit challenging, but it gives you something to work up to.",1235779200,6,1841,4.329446064139941
8053257,1,B0007XBM3O,I found it to be extremely boring. It would be great for someone older looking for a very mild workout or someone in poor shape looking to start slow. It consists of very easy moves like laying on top of the ball and rolling back and forward and holding very basic positions. If you are looking for anything challenging at all then I would suggest not buying this DVD.,1231372800,4,368,4.3478260869565215
8053258,4,B0007XBM3O,its a longer workout on the ball but Stott pilates covers everything and explains it very well. highly recommend!,1211328000,3,113,5.0
