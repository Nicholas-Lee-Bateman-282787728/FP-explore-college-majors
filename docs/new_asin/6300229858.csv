7806709,5,6300229858,"Johnny Legend compiled this brilliant bouquet of movie trailers that vividly express both the joy and the pent up angst that has brewed in American culture since man first gripped onto the moving picture camera. This is not simply a random presentation of trailers, but a well organized compilation that cries out ""Man has held the camera; he has also smudged, cleaned, and replaced its lense!"" The properly placed glimpse of ""Pin-Down Girls"" exposes the cultural rage that is gradually releasing itself in fine Gehutnist flight, leaving the viewer to weep; asking why cinematic efforts like ""The Speed Lovers"" have been hidden from the critics kind plume. We can only hope that Johny Legend will follow suit with another livid, vivid, hungry yet filling video essay that can free the creative spirit in modern America's poets, writers and philosophers.",984182400,3,853,5.143884892086331
