6605646,3,B00N1JQ3UI,"It's good if you want to know all about James Cameron's life and family.  There is lots of technical information and history about deep sea exploration.  However, if you want to see lots of HD footage of underwater life, you're wasting your time.  I would say less than 20% of the movie is underwater footage.  It's more of a ""making of"" his underwater adventure; a documentary about James Cameron.  In that case, it's a good show.",1418169600,15,431,4.618421052631579
6605647,5,B00N1JQ3UI,"Unbelievable. I would give this film 50 stars if I could.  I have never felt emotions this strong while watching a movie.  I literally had waves of goosebumps come over me at times, several times times I was so choked up I could barely breath as I was awe swept.  Big congratulations to the team....  the engineers, the planners, the scientists, the photographers and film crew. Wow.",1417737600,2,383,4.6716417910447765

6605653,4,B00N1JQ3UI,"Who else in the world has the resources, the people connections, the drive, and the physical ability to build their own private submersible and drop it into the deepest part of the ocean? No one besides James Cameron, presumably, since no one else has done it! Parts of this movie reminded me of ""Black Sky,"" the documentary about Burt Rutan's development of the first privately built space ship. The recipe seems similar for both projects: you need a ton of money, a group of highly skilled technical people who are willing to work ridiculously long 16-hour days, a hard-driving boss, and a tight deadline that will surely be missed. But here, the only person seen piloting the incredibly expensive and wildly dangerous toy is Cameron himself.
I liked the movie because I like ocean exploration. We do get to see some glimpses of deep sea creatures and footage of wrecks (like the ""Titanic"") where Cameron has explored previously. And I had no idea that two of Cameron's team members died in a helicopter crash while the project was still underway.
The exact cost of this project is not disclosed in the film, but you will see some of the technical issues that arose during Cameron's test dives and during his actual deep dive to 35,756 feet (nearly 7 miles down.) As demanding of a person as Cameron may seem, it is hard to not be impressed when things go wrong at crushing ocean depths and he manages to keep his cool. Although much of this movie plays out like Cameron's love letter to himself, I do think it is worth watching for the insight behind such a high risk/high dollar R&D project.",1415577600,9,1595,4.659574468085107
6605654,5,B00N1JQ3UI,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview(dot) com says: There are people who have a kind of adventurer bugand Camerons got it like a big healthy tick that feeds on knowledge. Lucky for us, he is also a film maker with the ability to organize a stellar crew and funding to build a submersible that will go deeper into our ocean than ever before.

Story goesPretty much everyone knows James Cameron is the guy behind the hit film Titanic. After the chance to go below and explore the Titanic in real life, Cameron delved deep into ocean exploration; and not in a millionaire-playing-with-tech-toys way...he puts himself into the jaws of death; diving deeper than anyone has been able to before.

And, for those who have watched this combo of explorer/filmmaker, also know he is to be taken seriously having already been a part of some incredible explorations beneath the waves. Here, he, and the bevy of scientists  each with a singular specialized task  have an incredible goal; to dive seven-plus miles down into the deepest canyon in the world.

The pressure is quite literally crushing. If one thing goes wrong, the one-man in the hole is gone. They have a saying from the first man down there (though not as far), If you hear a snap and you have time to think, What was that? you're gonna be okay."" Because there is no room for even the smallest miscalculation when you can be crushed in a nanosecond 27000 feet below.

As you watch, you realize, perhaps, only a sci-fi director could manage this remarkable team; a person used to the absurd budgets, micro-managing many, and keeping the science-y stuff palatable for the masses (ish). And, with this adventure, everyone involved understands any error equal quite soberingly, means death. It's more pressure than any bottom-line-driven studio head could muster.

Admittedly, Deepsea is not a blockbuster-styled special effect extravaganza. Well, perhaps for those who adore the idea of Earth-side look sees into places no human eyes have before peeked, it is; emotionally. Instead, Deepsea is a smart detailed behind the scenes and in-the-deep-minutia of how a team of gung-ho intelligente gets to a point where they can even send a man down this deep; the water pressure was once just insurmountable.

Ultimately, Cameron, his team, and his wonderfully unique submersible discover new species, and new bacteria. No mega shark-dinosaurs down there, but, for we into the awe, its a thrill. Kids may get borednot in the 3D theaterbut if you're watching at home; this is not The Abyss, though ironically, they actually go there.

Snack Recommendation: Sushi rolls all around and champagne - to toast this triumph- of course.",1415577600,11,2665,4.9707865168539325
6605655,5,B00N1JQ3UI,"I saw this at the theater.  It is a documentary of how James Cameron and his crew built and came up with a deep sea sub.  During filming two crew members were killed sadly in  a helicopter crash and that is in here as well.  That's what the movie is about mainly , until we go down deep into the deep sea trenches with James.  I must salute James for not editing out how  hard he can be to work with , but in this case , if they did ONE thing wrong he would DIE.  So lets give the man a break on that front!.  We do get to see his lovely wife Suzi Amis ,  as well. She needs to get in front of the camera more for sure.  If you like sea documentaries shot in 3d , then this one will do nicely.  3d rocks; and these days why would anyone watch a documentary shot today that ISN""T in that format?.  Personally I hope James comes up with some more good 3d feature films as well.  Until then this is a good documentary film by him.",1415491200,7,927,3.8412698412698414

- 60% about James Cameron
- 20% other people's expeditions and footage
- 15% interesting engineering
- 5% footage from the challenger deep

Seriously, there are clips from Avatar.

Also, Cameron talks a lot about ""science"", but never discusses what was already known prior to his expedition, what knowledge was gained as a result, or any caveats or limitations of his expedition. In short, there's no scientific thought going on; some scientific knowledge may have been acquired during all this work, but it was purely incidental to the production of this movie, and is not discussed at all.",1495411200,3,661,5.055045871559633

Well, lets just say, I'm on the complete other side of the fence. Had no idea this was possible. No wonder they were charging so much for it. Now thats with the active shutter technology, not the passive.
As far as the movie goes, its neat. At the same time if it wasn't 3D I'd probably pass. Not a lot going on. Just James sitting a the bottom of the trench. Thought there'd be more interesting things down there.",1479600000,,672,4.217054263565892

When you see this documentary, its obvious it was tens of millions of dollars to complete his life long dream, including designing and manufacturing the new technology to do this amazing task. And to our eyes, worth every penny. The 3D is stunning and the tale is very well told and exciting, fully hosted by Mr. Cameron himself, who is certainly an expert story teller. The price was a little over $6.00 new and if anyone knows how to do 3D, it's James Cameron. Highly recommended",1477180800,,670,4.686440677966102

6605763,5,B00N1JQ3UI,"It's one of the most inspirational and educational documentaries I've ever watched.  Filmed in stunning 3D--from a director credited with revolutionizing the technology--the film recounts the DeepSea Challenge project undertaken by James Cameron and a crack team of brilliant engineers to design, build, test and finally deploy a submersible exploration vehicle capable of descending and maneuvering at the deepest areas of the Earth's oceans piloted by Cameron himself.

After his ""Ghosts of the Deep"" documentary published earlier using similar production methods, this showed Cameron as a Deep Sea Explorer, a topic depicted in one of his earliest films ""Aliens of the Deep"" only this time he had managed to direct and star in it himself facing mortal dangers in the process beyond any possible means of rescue in case of a malfunction breaking a World record of the deepest dive ever.

6605864,5,B00N1JQ3UI,"I haven't seen this in 3D so I will not speak to that but, I will try to set the proper expectations for this film.  This is not a run of the mill documentary with sweeping camera shots and mellow music. Really, its the story of the challenge itself and Cameron's profoundly stoic determination to see his dream realized. Is his dream to reach the deepest part of the ocean and survive, returning with video footage of bizarre creatures and the spawn of prehistoric nightmares?  Apparently not. Footage abounds once the target depth of 35,000 plus feet is finally reach but its a whole lot of what you might expect in the most uninhabitable place on earth...nothing. Lots and lots of nothing with a couple new species here and there, some volcanic plumes a few rolling hills, all followed by more nothing. But like I stated at the outset, this is not going to win any awards for best cinematography but it is a powerfully intriguing and surprisingly emotional account of what it looks like when the spirit of adventure is fueled by the desire for knowledge kindled by scientific inquiry and innovation and culminates in conquering the unconquerable.  Cameron's vision is at full efficiency here and his calm, almost humorous composure under the most intense of pressure (pun intended) is enough to quell the viewer's mounting anxiety as well as convey to us what his true purpose for doing a project like this is. Not to find new or lost species, not to set records or obtain bragging rights but rather, to push the boundaries of scientific exploration, to shatter the stigma of ""cannot be done"" and inspire a new generation of pioneers to take his accomplishments just another step further into what ""can be done"".  Its obvious to me that Cameron's intention is to prove the viability of exploring outer space by reaching and learning inner space. You will believe that's possible after watching this.",1447977600,2,1902,4.807339449541284

6605872,4,B00N1JQ3UI,"Clocking in at 90 or so minutes this documentary is a very interesting look at Hollywood filmmaker and 'can do' guy James Cameron and the project he created in an effort to get to the very bottom of the deepest part of the worlds oceans - the Mariana Trench. The documentary is very much a filming of the whole project. We get lots of interviews with Cameron, we get to watch the team that created the vessel that took him to the bottom of the world go through emergency drills and teething problems and we get to see how a personal tragedy affected the crew. There is footage of tests, there is discussion about earlier deep sea exploits and Cameron talking about what inspired him to be involved with the ocean. All up the viewer gets a very complete package of what this project was all about.

As the show progresses things get to the pointy end where the craft 'Deepsea Challenger' is prepared for the big day. There is a genuine sense of tension throughout much of the show but this is where things get serious. The mood of things takes a turn as the craft moves deeper and deeper and how a vessel that is at the cutting edge of what mankind could build on the day is really tested by the extreme depth.

Some reviewers have noted that there isn't a mountain of animal life footage and this is correct. There is discussion about deep sea animals and there is discussion of the scientific aspects of looking at what sort of life is down there - the rather nifty ways the craft has of taking samples is fun to watch - but this is not an animal documentary. It is very much focussed on the challenge to exceed, to push farther.

Anyone with a sense of adventure - or especially anyone with an interest in the sea and exploration - will probably enjoy this film. It's available in 2D and 3D and the whole team who did this should be congratulated on their exploits.",1438905600,2,1867,4.3746397694524495

Seriously, I am a Cameroon fan, all his movies are good - this is a documentary about his desire to explore the oceans, and frankly it doesn't deserve much more than a 15 minute youtube video's worth of my time. You may feel differently, but I sat down expecting to see deep sea creatures, and at least 30 minutes to an hours worth of under water footage.

WRONG. It's all talking, and a little scripted emotion about ohh.. it's so dangerous going to the bottom of the ocean.....

No kidding.

If you weren't already aware of that, you wouldn't have purchased this film - because we are all attracted to stunts that defy the odds.

The submarine / craft that his engineers were paid to design and build - is outstanding.

If you want to spend your money wisely on a Cameron film, go watch Avatar again.",1420761600,10,926,4.354651162790698

6606010,5,B00N1JQ3UI,"Watching this excellent documentary was a wonderful and transformative experience. This film chronicles the journey from a germ of an idea James Cameron had of diving to the deepest point in the earth to actually doing it over a decade later in a sub he co-designed himself with an elite team of brilliant engineers and scientists - and its exactly as exciting as you'd expect!

The documentary is beautifully shot and the 3D really adds to the immersive nature - its as close to actually diving to the depths as most of us will ever be and there are many stunning images here which will surely take your breath away and increase your appreciation of the world we live in.

More people have been on the moon than have been to the Challenger Deep, and this really puts into perspective how difficult this mission was. I was very pleased with the focus on Cameron's vision and drive along with the ingenuity and resourcefulness of his team towards the goal. To me, the team seemed to represent the best of humanity: the curiosity, intelligence and drive to expand the boundaries of our knowledge. Watching the team design, build, train and finally accomplish the mission was akin to watching NASA during the golden age of space exploration. Some of the footage of the sub's interior and exploration is also very close to being on an alien planet which is awe-inspiring.

James Cameron funded the project himself and must be commended for 1) Conducting meaningful research and expanding our horizons and 2) Doing his best to inspire us and the next generation towards science, exploration and conservation.

James Cameron is arguably the best filmmaker working today and has been a trailblazer in the visual arts by developing and progressing technologies like CGI and 3D. He has used his successes there to fund his numerous expeditions and given scientists a platform for research and exploration. Last year he traversed the US with his submersible and his team giving talks and specifically focusing on young children to encourage their interest in science and engineering. The sub has now been donated to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution so it and its cutting edge technologies can be used by all interested parties. Watching Mr. Cameron speak in DC inspired me to start contributing towards conservation by volunteering my time. This documentary has further intensified my interest and I hope to increase my efforts.

Highly recommended - get a glimpse of a totally unexplored area of our planet, one bigger than North America! A stunning achievement which continues to inspire and educate.",1418601600,3,2600,4.981566820276497
6606011,3,B00N1JQ3UI,"I am a marine since teacher and I bought this because I teach ocean exploration.  It is more of a documentary about James Cameron's dream to do this dive and the behind the scenes work that goes into building a submersible capable of such a task.  For that aspect it's cool, but there was very little about the actual dive to the Challenger Deep and hardly any footage on animal life; this was a disappointment and why I only gave it 3 stars.",1418428800,3,442,4.313253012048193

About the closest documentary I've seen that captures so much of the feel and difficulties of highly mechanized field research.  I do airborne weather research, and could fully empathize with the engineers integrating complex systems and trying to keep them running and happy.  Hey guys, the wirings backwards, again...

However, they should have gone into a lot more detail about the sub, its systems, and how the deep sea environment drove the designs.  I would have loved to see early design sketches, and drivers forcing it one way, then another.  What is that nest of tubes going all over the place?  (looking it up later) Oh, it's pressure balanced hydraulics that drive the thrusters and even the arm.  What are they using for buoyancy instead of the giant gasoline tank they mention for the 1960 descent?  Oh, it's a special syntactic foam made of tiny hollow glass spheres embedded in epoxy.  How were the signals conveyed from the pressure sphere?  What was special about the big LED bank.  That sort of thing.

Actually, a ""making of"", with all the technical details, would be great!  Thanks guys and nice work pulling it off.",1501545600,,1244,4.918269230769231
