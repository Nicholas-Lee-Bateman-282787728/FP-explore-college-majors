6429771,4,B00KI30WX4,"No stranger to controversy, director Kim Ki-Duk (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pieta/dp/B00C6F61MS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pieta</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Girl/dp/B0009ETDCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Girl</a>) delivers another shocker with Moebius (2013), a strange and darkly warped tale of domestic dysfunction, violence, brutal mutilation, and perverted sexuality.  Warning, some spoilers follow.

Set in South Korea, Moebius mainly concerns an unnamed man (Jae-hyeon Jo), his wife (Eun-woo Lee), teenage son (Young-ju Seo), and the man's shopkeeper mistress (Eun-woo Lee in a dual role).  Enraged by his infidelity, the wife attempts to cut off her husband's member.  When she is thwarted, she then mutilates her son.  In one of the few concessions to reality, the father takes his son for medical treatment.  Apparently a very fast healer, the son shows few physical signs of injury, although he is deeply damaged psychologically.

The police do become involved, but not in a search for the estranged mother, instead the son is arrested when the shopkeeper mistress is assaulted by some punks.  First the father, and then the son, discover that sexual gratification can be achieved by alternate means.  When the mother unexpectedly returns, an already twisted situation becomes even more perverse and violent.

A film without dialog, Moebius requires that you pay attention to the visual presentation, to try and fill in the key pieces yourself.  Director Kim apparently believed that the story would have more impact with dialog.  While this may be open to debate, there being no conversation also serves as a device to move the plot along without providing rational explanations, as Moebius maintains a certain detachment from reality.

If you can accept the movie for what it is, and follow the story to its disturbing conclusion, you will find that Moebius explores some disturbing and daring subject matter, particularly for a Korean film.  There is nudity, and almost everything that happens has some kind of sexual context.  The actions of the characters may seem surreal at times, with an inordinate amount of slapping taking place.  Even though there is no dialog, the quality of the acting is very good, and charged with emotion.  Eun-woo Lee is impressive in a dual role, in a film that was supposedly shot in just seven days.

Perverted, controversial, and more than a little sick, Moebius isn't for everyone, but it deserves some credit for being daring, and it's a film that will probably take your mind in some unexpected directions.  The DVD release includes some nice bonus features, including interviews with director Kim Ki-Duk, and actress Eun-woo Lee.",1415664000,2,2777,5.680387409200969

6429773,4,B00KI30WX4,"Use discretion in whom you invite to watch this film.  The subject is depravity, served garish and cold.  In a way the film is itself an example of lives lived with no direction save impulse and that only at the moment it is felt.  Impulse may be what draws you to watch Moebius.  If so, you'll find self-indulgence duly rewarded with well directed and chillingly performed portrayals of self-deception and mutual horror, both performed for an audience that is at once the other character in the scene and you.  I am led to wonder at the capability of a storyteller to draw his audience to a place no one of us really has to go while we recognize the journey and its destination as something we've known all along.  This film makes the macabre reasonable, inevitable and horrific.  If you come away from this film entertained and revolted you'll have the satisfaction of knowing the storyteller has you in mind and, hopefully, not on the screen.  Should you slip into voyeurism or its thoughtless counterpart, the need to watch body parts that go covered by day, you'll be titillated and you'll miss what makes the  film worthwhile.",1414886400,,1132,4.7055837563451774
6429774,1,B00KI30WX4,"This Korean film has no subtitles, but that's not necessary because there's no dialogue either.  It is a horrifying and indeed repulsive story of a massively dysfunctional family.  The husband is having an affair with a younger woman. His wife naturally resents this, but instead of taking the predictable course of filing for divorce, she follows in the notorious footsteps of Lorena Bobbit and makes an attempt to emasculate her husband.  When he avoids the knife she attacks their sleeping teenage son, this time successfully, and then disappears.

The rest of the movie deals with the aftermath of the attack.  Both father and son are shattered and their lives spiral downhill.  When the wife reappears things go from bad to worse, and the film ends as macabrely as possible.  Reviews of this film quoted on the DVD packaging use terms like ""grotesquely rewarding,"" ""morbidly humorous,"" and ""insane and brilliant."" In each case I agree with the first descriptor, but not the last.

RAM Releasing sent me this film of their own accord, and if it is representative of the sort of thing they normally produce I hope they never send me another one. This one's going straight into the garbage.",1414022400,6,1192,4.925

6429777,3,B00KI30WX4,"A 2013 Korean drama Moebius is written and directed by Ki-duk Kim, responsible for such films as Bad Guy Samaria and Pieta. This means Moebius is no ordinary film. Ki-duk Kims typically shocking subject matter aside, the controversial directors film is anything but conventional, as it is shot without any dialogue and characters have no name.

A housewife, enraged because of her unfaithful husband, cuts off her sons genital organs, and leaves her home. The father and son, now left alone, have to find a way to cope with the painful reality. What follows is a chain of events, mostly violent ones including gang rape, with the final act that is as intense as any horror movie you name.

Thanks to the skillful editing and effective acting from the players, Moebius is far from boring and the unpredictable story is often fascinating. Even so, I kept asking myself while watching the film: Why does the mother have to do this to her own son? Why these two characters are played by the same person? Why? Why?

You may send me hundreds of answers to my question. Some may say this is a Greek tragedy in Ki-duk Kim style; some say this is a Freudian drama; some may say this is about sexuality and transgression; some even say this is a dark comedy, so don't take it too seriously.

To me, the film is made for no other purpose than to shock us and challenge our values. The director certainly succeeds in doing so, but I really don't see the point of the film.",1426723200,7,1460,4.5399239543726235
6429778,5,B00KI30WX4,"** I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

If youve ever looked at your family and thought, Wowwe are the definition of dysfunctional, you are certainly not alone.  Many of us have done that very thing, and some think about it often.  But if that thought has ever crossed your mind, don't worry:  your family is probably the epitome of sane compared to the people in MOEBIUS.  This Korean thriller is an inventive yet disturbing look at one familys struggle to maintain sanity amidst a self-inflicted turmoil.

This is one of those movies that is similar to a car accident; it is tragic and horrific, but for some reason you cannot look away.  That is a huge part of what makes the film so much fun to watch.  I squirmed several times throughout, but I loved every minute of it.

MOEBIUS is shot very well and looks great onscreen.  The production value appears high, and the cast and crew do an excellent job of putting this film together.  I particularly like how director Ki-duk Kim is able to accomplish so much without using dialogue.  There are no lines in the film, and yet it is full of powerful emotion, mostly due in part to a talented cast.  I am not familiar with any of the actors or actresses in this film, however they all do a phenomenal job with their roles.  I daresay this movie would be horrible if it did not have such a talented group in front of the camera.

The special effects in the film are good, with a couple of cringeworthy scenes (those involving the castration) that will make even the heartiest of gore-hounds sweat.  Granted, theres not much gore, but this is a case of less-is-more.  I love how the film is able to have this effect, as it hits home on a primal level.

The story in MOEBIUS is the big winner here, though.  The downward spiral that is set into motion after the moms horrific act is almost gratifying in a sense; the family is so apathetic towards each other that you want something to happen that might bring them together.  But unfortunately, the events have tragic consequences that make you feel sad for them in the end.

MOEBIUS is messed up on several levels, but it is a huge win for me.  I recommend it, however be warned if you decide to give it a shot:  the film deals with some heavy subject matters, even if some of it is darkly comedic.  It is available now in a variety of formats.",1425945600,,2377,4.39908256880734
6429779,3,B00KI30WX4,"MOEBIUS is a film that will find its audience - there is so much of this sort of morbid, weird derring-do in routine movies and on television that it should not really shock anyone. But the film is different. It is without spoken word and therefore relies solely on the body language and wordless reaction from the cast. Yes the story is bizarre - a married man with a son has an affair with a young woman, the wife flips over the top and decides to destroy the husband's offending organ - an act that is thwarted and the mother instead transfers her uncontrollable madness on her son, surgically altering him. The family disintegrates, the father commiserates with the injured and disturbed son and the mother re-enters the family picture with an even more bizarre behavior.

The three cast members are convincing - a factor that somehow makes the film work. Yes, it is a disturbing movie but some people with a thirst for the darker themes will likely purchase the film to watch repeatedly. Grady Harp, February 15",1423440000,7,1016,4.675977653631285
6429780,5,B00KI30WX4,"This is filmmaking at its finest!  Ki Duk tells a story of incest, castration and suicide in a Korean family without any dialogue for an hour and a half.  It is an Oedipal tale about a Moebius strip of a family, where one nightmarish thing leads to another and things go around and around. The direction shows through in the fine performances of the actors, who must use only their expressions and body language to portray what is going on.  It isn't a throwback to silent films though, because the acting is modern and stylized, the emotions are raw and plain to see, and the way it is filmed (camera work, sound) is exquisite.  This is not a movie for American audiences, brought up on Batman, Superman, The Hobbit; it is a movie that requires an open mind and an understand heart in order to make sense out of the surprising, and often shocking twists and turns of the plot.  Duk is not content to just turn out a easygoing Hollywood thriller or fantasy film.  This is completely original from beginning to end.  The subject matter is twisted and over the edge, even after Korean censors had Duk remove some scenes.  It is a film for the diminishing group of film devotees left in our culture.",1420502400,2,1196,4.50462962962963
6429781,5,B00KI30WX4,"If you never heard of this film before, you're not alone.  It certainly isn't the kind of movie promoted in mainstream, middle-class America (and, yes, we should be ashamed).  I was lucky enough to find it while browsing Amazons prime selection.

A husband cheats on his wife, who takes revenge on their teenage son by castrating the boy!?  If the movie ended there, it would be enough to make anyone uncomfortable.  But thats just the beginning.  Leave it to the Koreans to push the envelope.  Just about every perversion you could imagine is here, and its all done without dialogue (geniusthe characters facial expressions tell you everything you need to know).  Incidentally, I was shocked to learn that the Mother and the Mistress were played by the same actress (Eun-woo Lee).  Bravo!

In my humble opinion, the moral of the film (suggested by its ending) is that we would all be better off without the sex drive (or at least the equipment necessary for its fulfillment)an odd but strangely sensible notion.",1419552000,,1012,4.8654970760233915
6429782,1,B00KI30WX4,"Be warned this review contains a [ SPOILER ALERT ] below the 2 top paragraphs

I just watched it and I have to say this is the sickest twisted and most *&$%#@ up movie rape, guy on guy attempt rape, cheating, marital trouble, revenge, great drama, psychological destruction and torment all the perfect ingredients in a great plot. It made an excellent start with heavy suspense very thought provoking and gripping anticipation held me to it I was really into it

Wife catches husband cheating and then here's what KILLED it for me I actually liked it until I saw what the mother did to her own son then what happened between them is what made me sick, like me you to will say WTF? Seriously for a mother to do that to her son death is too kind for her. after doing what she did she takes off than comes back later on. There is no dialog in it but it is so well made who cares, I love the actors to they give amazing performances, the characters are also good

8659141,5,B00KI30WX4,"This is only the second film I've seen by the brilliantly twisted Korean director Kim Ki-duk - the first being the lyrical and beautiful ""Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter - Spring"". After emerging from viewing the crazed  ""Moebius"" I initially thought: ""Boy - those were sure really different films from the same guy!""  However, upon deeper reflection I was struck by the Buddhist overtones present in both pictures and could see similarities.  Other reviewers have done a good job of 'revealing' the plot line and unique elements of ""Moebius"" so I'll not bother to reiterate any of that.

I found this to be a very powerful film dealing with the nature of human sexuality and the major role that it plays in all humanity. Kim Ki-duk drives his points home with a sledge-hammer by playing with the unsettling concept of castration and what role sexual organs play in our identity and quest for pleasure, relationships, and personal satisfaction.  There is a delightfully dark Oedipal edge to the story-line as karmic elements bend in upon the characters who are caught up in a perverse moebius-strip of destiny.

In the end, after much angst has been expended in trying to get everyone's sexual equilibrium back in order - the Buddha puts in a final appearance to remind us that 'earthly desires are the source of human suffering' and the sly smile of the youthful, re-neutered,  protagonist shows us that he, at least, has gotten the message and found his enlightenment.  I loved this film and, despite it's vaunted 'uncomfortable' sexual elements, would not hesitate to recommend its' viewing to anyone (ADULT).

I would note that the version I purchased (and reviewed) is a Euro Region 2 PAL edition from ""Terracotta' that is 'rated' as 18+ - the stated run-time was 89 min..  In N. America there is apparently an NTSC  'rated' 90 min. version and an 'unrated' 103 min version.  In the version I watched much of the 'castration' action was sorta 'alluded to' rather than graphically depicted (which was definitely cringe-worthy enuf!!) - but I don't know what the difference is between what the rated & unrated US versions provide - nor how they compare to the Euro version. Regardless - one 'gets the point'.",1455494400,,2210,4.89544235924933

I loved the fact that so much was shown through non verbal language (of course there are grunts and sexual noises but no real dialogue).  With all of that said, this movie is by far one of the most twisted movies I have ever seen.  It doesn't take number one some how (lol)  but it is way up there.
