7795859,2,1553600843,"This is a very superficial attempt at fusing Pilates with Yoga.  I expected Merrithew entertainment to do a better job with this product, but it's clear that they lack experience with Yoga postures & the sequencing of these postures.  Stott Pilates needs to focus on Pilates DVD production.",1483056000,,290,5.020833333333333
7795860,1,1553600843,This was my second order of the same DVD.  It jammed my player early on in the recording and caused a lot of problems not to mention the frustration.(both times)  There is something wrong with the production of this item.  You should not be selling it.,1241913600,,252,4.434782608695652
7795861,5,1553600843,"This is an hour long vinyasa flow video, intermediate level power yoga - starts with any sun salutations A and B, with not much time for step backs, so if you do not yet jump back, be aware.  Progresses to standing and seated poses, with some interesting variations.  Constant reminders to stabilise the shoulders and knit the ribs are what make this ""pilates-infused"" - do not expect any proper pilates, or fusion.  Actually a lot of pilates is based on yoga, so there you go.
PJ O'Clair gives great instruction and cues - I was impressed and highly recommend this tape.",1044144000,3,571,4.633663366336633
