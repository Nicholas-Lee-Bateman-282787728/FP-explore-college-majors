So I guess she loves it. Poor parents.",1179446400,,150,4.321428571428571
2679041,5,B000JSI61I,This was well worth the money and the time spent on finding this DVD,1176163200,,68,3.9285714285714284
2679042,5,B000JSI61I,"We now have all but 1 of the Hi-5 dvds. My grandsons are 2 and 1yr. old.

I started with 2 for Christmas stockings, and have since ordered for Easter baskets. THEY ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! Every segment has a lesson: counting, shapes, vocabulary, playing with others, etc..... I can't believe how much my 2yr. old remembers every time he watches it. It can be weeks since he has watched a video, and he remembers words to songs and different dance steps or routines. I'm sure before the next birthday, we will have to have another one. BEST MONEY WE'VE SPENT!",1173744000,,554,4.54
2679043,5,B000JSI61I,"My 2-year-old daughter loves this DVD.  She also loves the MOVE YOUR BODY DVD.  She loves to dance to the upbeat music, and I think she even has a little crush on Shawn.",1171497600,,169,4.090909090909091
2679044,5,B000JSI61I,I enjoy this program with my son mornings on TV and thought this would be a great stocking stuffer this past Christmas. It is great to be able to call upon the segments he likes at will and the sing along and karoake features are great as well.,1169078400,2,244,4.104166666666667
2679045,5,B000JSI61I,"This DVD ranks at the top of our choices for our grandchildren, ages 2, 4, 5, and 6.  Hi-5 not only inspires little ones to sing and dance along with performers, it teaches them to accept the differences in individuals and cultures.  When we first discovered Hi-5, we had to have DVDs and CDs for each household.  We are happy to add Action Heroes and Move Your Body to our collection.  A GOOD BUY!",1168819200,2,398,4.337837837837838
2679046,5,B000JSI61I,"My granddaughter (3yrs) loves Hi-5, and was delighted with this one. never took her eyes off the screen. I like them for their wholesomness. Seem like a nice bunch of kids.",1167868800,3,172,4.580645161290323
2679047,5,B000JSI61I,"The DVD's are great, and they are a different format than the three previous releases (Game Time, Music Magic and Color Craze) Instead of having three shows from the same Theme of the Week, they have bits of each theme, and three themes on each...does that make sense? Ok here ya go.....

Move Your Body DVD has bits from

Five Senses

Move Your Body

and North, South, East and West (CPP - my favorite)

Action Heroes has bits from

duh, Action Hero

T.E.A.M (another fave)

Underwater Discovery

It's very refreshing to see three songs instead of seeing the same song 6 times on a DVD, with two back to back.....much less irritating for dads and frazzled moms!

Plus, the Move Your Body DVD has the best skit ever....Captain Puffy Pants baby!! WOOT!!! That is absolutley the most hilarious skit ever....Everybody does a great job on that skit, and they especially did an awesome job at the MYB tour....(shhh I heard they did it special for me...hey...it's not bragging if it's true!!! he he!!!---hey I wonder if they put CPP in the commercial and the new DVD for me too......a girl can dream!!!!)

The dvds are durable, so if you entrust your techno gizmos to little ones, they are perfect....they are brightly colored, so it will catch the eyes of the little ones at the store...

If you want a fun and eduacational show that will have your kids singing and dancing and learning about shapes, music, numbers, vocabulary and using their imaginations, this is a great show that will have the whole family singing along...a great buy!",1165708800,10,1534,4.704119850187266
2679048,5,B000JSI61I,"Yo no se que tienen estos chicos pero han cautivado a los nios y me gusta el formato pues es educativo, cretivo y los pone a moverse, ejercitarse y a tener ritmo.",1202428800,,162,4.09375
2679049,5,B000JSI61I,"Our kids have certainly enjoyed this DVD. Big Hi-5 fans in our house. Only complaint is that for those of us without cable access, more segments or complete episodes would be nice. As I said, our kids are big fans. Most of the time I appreciate the automatic restarting of the DVD once it has played since it is about 45 minutes long.",1200960000,,334,4.317460317460317
2679050,5,B000JSI61I,My Grandkids (2-2 yr olds) love this CD as they do all Hi-5 CD's. Favorite song is Undrwater Discovery unfortunately it is the very last song. Still a great CD.,1198972800,,160,4.366666666666666
2679051,4,B000JSI61I,"If you watch the show (or rather your kids watch the show), then this is a good compilation of some of their better skits and songs.  It's good for road trips, or bedtime.",1197936000,,171,4.181818181818182
2679052,5,B000JSI61I,My grandson loves the Move Your Body by Hi-5.  The music is great and the messages it provides for children is great.,1196294400,,117,4.318181818181818
2679053,5,B000JSI61I,My kid loves this show and now everytime I need to cheer him up I put it on,1195689600,,75,3.2222222222222223
2679054,5,B000JSI61I,My grandson (4) has memorized all the songs and actions to this DVD. He knows all the character's names and seems to identify with their child-friendly approach. There are several titles in the Hi 5 series. You can't go wrong with any one of them. I just sent one to a friend for her granddaughter who is two. I know she will love it also.,1187222400,,339,4.230769230769231
2679055,5,B000JSI61I,"Hi-5 is the best kept secret of children's shows.  Unlike other shows made for kids that can be annoying, I actually ENJOY watching this.  It is also far and away my 1 1/2 year old daughter's favorite show.  As a matter of fact, it's the only show that actually holds her interest (which may be a good thing!).  Since I can't sing, I have a big appreciation for those who can and these kids (in their 20's) are VERY, VERY talented!  Plus, their songs are so catchy, I find myself singing them!  We own the yellow DVD (volume 1) as well and they are both FANTASTIC!  We have also ordered the newly released volume 3 and look forward to seeing Hi-5 in concert on August 2.  I just can't say enough about them!",1183680000,,707,4.2631578947368425
2679056,5,B000JSI61I,"As you already know Shaun and Karla have left the show (for a new career opportunity) so they will be missed.

The great addition in this DVD is the video of the Hi-5 gang with a bunch of kids having fun. Fragments of this video are played between scenes.

In the ""Move Your Body"" DVD, the complete group play with the kids. In this DVD, only 3 of them (without Shaun and Karla) play with kids doing some great stuff (climbing, flying, seeing sharks, riding on a boat, etc). I hope they don't include the new members in the 3rd DVD. It will be very confusing.

My 3yo son always asked me for this DVD (""the blue one"" according to him). It's so easy to play, they don't have the big wait like any other DVDs. You can skip the legal advise with a simple FWD!",1182211200,,756,4.164383561643835
2679057,3,B000JSI61I,"I expected to have more episodes available on this DVD, but it was not to be. The DVD include the themes from ""Under the Sea"", ""Action Heroes"" and ""T-E-A-M"" and an episode from each of the themes. I would have preferred more of the show, but I did like what I saw. The DVD also includes a few stickers and a ""travel case"" (rather than the typical DVD case).",1180137600,,357,4.188405797101449

8152916,5,B000JSI61I,"Your child can't remain on the couch for any Hi-5 DVD. Lots of non-stop action, music, role-playing and vibrant story-telling. I love these as much as my grandchildren. Take away the electronic devices, and get ready to move and groove with the children in a very fun, interactive and educational learning experience!",1355702400,,317,5.115384615384615

8152919,5,B000JSI61I,My two year old boy loves all the Hi-5 videos.  He can watch it over and over again (The Hi-5 videos are the only ones that he will watch the entire 45 minutes).  He loves the songs and sings along with the Hi-fiver.  Strongly recommended for children of all ages.,1219017600,,264,4.24
8152920,5,B000JSI61I,this is my 2+ year old daughter's favorite hi-5 video.  she insists on wearing her cape for the opeing song and it has been endlessly requested.  my four year old son also likes it alot.,1219017600,,186,4.285714285714286
8152921,5,B000JSI61I,"Well, my son L-O-V-E-S HI-5, this group has wonderful songs and they are great!.. I owned three of their D VD's already, and I will be buying the rest of the collection pretty son.. My son is 2 years and 6 months of age and he sings,dances and he uses lots of new words that he learned from the videos, and the music is so great that you will get involve with your kids while they are watching this wonderful video..",1212537600,,416,4.148148148148148
8152922,5,B000JSI61I,"My girls LOVE Hi5, but it is on too early in the morning for them here. Having the videos are great!! I was so happy to find them on Amazon!
The Easter Bunny left 5 of them for my girls and we have already watched 4 (Easter was just yesterday!) They'll probaly watch the 5th one before the end of the day!",1206316800,,305,3.935483870967742
