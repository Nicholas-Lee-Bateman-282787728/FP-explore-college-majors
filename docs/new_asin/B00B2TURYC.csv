5553707,4,B00B2TURYC,"Political agenda of Film Director shows refusal to understand reality on the ground. Easy to raise questions about the military's behavior and conveniently ignore facts. Liberal point of view masks real facts.
Good acting by all actors, primarily the female interrogator and accused officer.",1380672000,2,291,5.636363636363637
5553708,1,B00B2TURYC,"Sorry, this is not worth the rental or time spent watching. The effort at filming a 'closed-in' space is not artful (just boring) and the dialogue is simplistic to the point of creating a parody. I didn't learn anything new about the Middle East or the known brutality of occupying soldiers.",1376092800,,291,4.7254901960784315
5553709,4,B00B2TURYC,"Israeli film with English subtitles; it's a gripping psychological study that takes place mainly in an interrogation room (Room 514) on an Israeli military base.  A young female interrogator is grilling some battle-hardened veterans about an operation that has occurred in occupied territory.  She meets with the veterans' contempt since she has not had the same combat experiences that they have to deal with every day, and on the other hand they don't understand her dedication to her job and her zeal to find out the truth.",1374364800,,526,5.0344827586206895
5553710,3,B00B2TURYC,"""Room 514"" is an artfully crafted movie. Using only a handful of actors and dominated by the claustrophobic confines of the title interrogation room, it lays out the story of Anna, an underdog Israeli army investigator. Anna is a conscripted military investigator seeking insight into events that take place beyond far beyond her span of control (an operational unit in the Israeli/Occupied territories, and persons of interest that increase in rank --and their commitment to the military as a career) as she defies logical processes that might convince her to just let go.

Viewers without some familiarity with the Israeli military (and its mostly compulsory military service) and the political climate of the Levant will be challenged to take away much from this movie. This is not the movie's fault, since it's Israeli made (in Hebrew with English subtitles). Beyond that, even with the sparest of sets and actors, familiar military movie tropes abound:
-conscript vs. careerist
-enlisted vs. officer
-junior investigator vs. senior accused
-forward operational issues vs. rear echelon regulation.

Anna reveals multiple issues during the course of her face to face and telephonic issues: mommy issues, male/daddy issues, issues with authority. An extended --and I would argue, gratuitous, even with both participants fully clothed-- ""tryst"" with her lover in the interrogation room does little to advance the story, while doing plenty to prompt questions about Anna's ultimate regard for the institution she is professing to serve with the truth.

In the end, I found the craft of this movie to overwhelm its narrative, and wished we could have had at least as much information as Anna did as each conversant appeared. Between the lack of context and the jarring, single-room venue that dominates, this movie takes a lot of work to absorb.

Is this movie worth renting and the time it takes to watch it? Absolutely. But if you've entered it with high expectations based on critical acclaim from film festival buzz, you might want to temper those.

Note: Film Movement provided a copy of this movie for review.",1371340800,,2114,5.169590643274854
5553711,5,B00B2TURYC,"It is rare to encounter a film confined (for the most part) to a single room that packs the wallop that this film form Israel delivers. Written and directed with great sophistication by Sharon Bar-Ziv and acted by a very small cast of splendid actors, this is a cinematic experience that shake's the viewer and makes an indelible impression of the many conflicts facing not only the Israelis of the story but of all peoples of global significance.

Anna (Asia Naifeld), whose origins are Russian, is in the Israeli army and is assigned the duty of investigating military/civilian incidents. Her current investigation involves interrogating Nimrod (Guy Kapulnik), an officer who is suspected of having information about a group of Israeli soldiers who brutally beat and unarmed Arab family. Nimrod is sarcastic about Anna's abilities, saying she doesn't understand warfare: his accusations are punctuated with frequent cellphone calls Anna accepts from her mother about household matters. Anna is in an affair with a fellow soldier Eraz (Ohad Hall) who is engaged to be married, but that doesn't stop their have very steamy sexual encounters in the interrogation room (there is one of the most erotic, complete sex scenes in film and all of this is by suggestion only as clothing is present). Eraz wants Anna to stop the interrogation of Nimrod because no killing was done. At the same time Eraz wants Anna to lie about their affair when his fianc Michaeli (Hilly Israel) confronts him.  Anna acquiesces to Eraz demands but pursues Nimrod until Nimrod agrees to bring in his commanding officer Davidi (Udi Persi) who apparently was the perpetrator of the beating incident. The results of Anna's interrogation provide her with the sense of justice that she has won for the victims of the beating, but that successful interrogation brings about a surprise ending to this film that is almost unbearably heartbreaking. While the underlying theme seems bound to Israeli versus Arabs, the issues explored are applicable worldwide - when is the abuse of power justified, what is the difference between covering for an act of adultery and covering for an act of military violence against innocent citizens?

This is an eye-opening view of the Israeli military and the very human problems that exist, but more importantly it is an under the microscope examination of human motivation. The cast is brilliant. Apparently the film was rehearsed for six months and then shot (in perfect cinematographic technique) in 5 days! In a word, it is brilliant! Grady Harp, May 13",1369958400,9,2557,5.083333333333333

5553713,3,B00B2TURYC,It's a good film - not excellent. Deserves three stars.,1465084800,,55,4.6
5553714,4,B00B2TURYC,"Room 514 is an interrogation room belonging to the Israeli military police. A woman investigator feels her duty is to uncover violent incidents against Arab civilians by an Israeli commander. The ethical dilemmas involved are skillfully explored with nuance and unsentimental ambiguity by all involved with the film; direction, acting and writing are all first rate.
 If only there were more American movies like this one. The American films that deal with serious subjects often seem infected by the hidden motive of profit. They are intelligent, well written, well acted and confront serious themes but at the same time reveal a sentimental softness at their core; they seem a curious combination of cynicism and sincerity. Are you listening, Mr Spielberg?
I do have a few caveats: The female interrogator sometimes pauses in the midst of serious accusations to have a cellphone conversation with her mother. The accused soldier is present during these conversations about trivial domestic issues. This hardly seems professional.  Is this to make her seem more human? Wouldn't she leave the room during these calls or more likely, not answer her cellphone? Second and more serious: the accused commander is to ask to sign a brief hand-written confession which only generally mentions the accusations against him, accusations which will ruin his career. In real life, wouldnt he have a lawyer present? And wouldnt he demand a specific list of accusations? But don't let this stop you from seeing a taut and sometimes grim movie that goes to the heart of the corruption sometimes behind the iron-willed Israeli need to preserve their way of life. This is a film that absolutely believes in its message, yet manages to present that message in a way that leaves you enlightened and questioning at the same time.",1459987200,,1809,5.128813559322034
5553715,5,B00B2TURYC,"An intensely filmed piece about brutality against Arab civilians by an Israeli Army Unit, and the secrecy and manipulation its members use to maintain the status quo.  The system willfully turns a blind eye to the situation, except for one Israeli officer bent on uncovering the truth. Her will withstands other soldiers' attempts to make her leave the situation alone. They try everything from cajoling to intimidation, but some of them break before she does. Still she is not free from temptations. The film is a statement about secrets big and small, and how no one is fully free from them, including the main character.",1455580800,,623,4.933333333333334
5553716,3,B00B2TURYC,Intense. Good film with a lot of underlying issues. Captivating - very difficult to pull off a movie that is set for the most part in one room.,1453075200,,143,4.142857142857143
5553717,5,B00B2TURYC,"Wow, wow, wow.  This is the best movie I have seen in a very long time.  It kept me on my toes trying to figure out how it would end.  A Definite Must See!!",1445904000,,156,3.5294117647058822
5553718,5,B00B2TURYC,"It is amazing what can be done with a few talented actors, a script that is compelling from both sides and a director who knows how to get the most out of his tightly shot actors. This is the opposite of room 101 in ""1984"", this inquisitor is driven by a higher morality, but may not see the ""Big Picture"". Where do we draw the line in the conflict of life and death? There are no easy answers, we are left to make our own decisions... and they will not be easy to make.",1445472000,,470,4.01063829787234
5553719,3,B00B2TURYC,"Well worth watching not just about Israeli military culture but for view of paternalistic societies and what any person within institutional structure faces in questioning ""the means justifies the ends mentality"" until it eventually corrupts the very ideals on which it founded itself.",1440979200,,285,5.651162790697675
5553720,4,B00B2TURYC,"This film is powerful on many levels.  We have landed a front row seat into the inner workings of Israeli society, the Israeli Defense Force and its male vs.female soldiers, sexual harrassment, enlisted vs. officer, non-tactical soldiers (where these interrogators reside) vs. tactical troops stationed in the Occupied Territories, and how a young female Russian immigrant Israeli soldier in her early 20s traverses all of this when she has only three weeks left in the Army as an interrogator investigating military crimes against Arab civilian populations.
Anna an IDF female interrogator,is burdened by being a female soldier among males who intimidate her and show their contempt for a woman in uniform, but she holds her ground and fights to show them she should be respected as a soldier, for her interrogation skills and mission accomplishment, and for her not sweeping things under the rug when she happens upon a military/political powder keg. Anna is also having an affair with her Commanding Officer who uses her not only for sex, but also as his ""counselor"" when talking about his fiancee. Layered into the film is the voice of Anna's Russian immigrant mother who is completely oblivious to what her daughter does for a living as an IDF interrogator and  constantly calls her at work about groceries and household tasks.  This film needed better editing; filmed almost entirely in Rm. 514; Anna seems to live there, sleep there, have sex there and interrogate there.  She even listens to Russian music there; and you see a certain nostalgia for how her life once was and how she misses her father who did not immigrate to Israel.  Anna is a lone woman shouldering a phenomenal responsibility and yet in reality just a young girl barely in her 20s supporting her mother.  The crux of the movie follows her last case; a soldier named Nimrod is brought in for questioning when complaints are made about an older Arab man being brutally beaten in front of his children for no reason, and other alleged abuses perpetrated on the Arab population by this ""elite"" IDF Unit called the ""Samarian Wolves"" known for their loyalty, ferocity, and the tough/terrible nature of their jobs.  Anna being an excellent interrogator soon unhinges Nirmrod to disclose info on his Commander Davidi.  The nature of ""snitching"" and when the ""snitch"" is found out is moving; as Nirmrod now no longer has the loyalty of his unit and they have turned on him; you are vaguely afraid for his life.  As the story unfolds and Davidi is questioned more thoroughly, things start to unravel in a way Anna never expected. Does she continue the mission she was trained to do to get social justice for the Arab population and punish the ""Samarian Wolves"" and its soldiers?

5553721,4,B00B2TURYC,"Full of tension with questions we would ask ourselves....how would we re-act when facing such a complicated and tragic ""us-against-them"" theme?",1431648000,,143,5.857142857142857
8561767,3,B00B2TURYC,"I tried a few times to get through this, but couldn't finish.  No fault of the film, I just didn't connect with it on any level.",1504310400,,128,3.923076923076923
8561768,4,B00B2TURYC,"In an era of ""fake news"" and ""alternative facts"", who really still wants to know the truth? It is especially hard when one person - or a whole society, tries to settle two contradictory moral codes: the normal system of justice and the war zone code. Over time, It gets harder and harder to look at the mirror and not deny what you see. When reality becomes monstrous, can society still preserve that which it cherishes most? The film puts such a mirror to the characters who face these dilemmas every day.
In my opinion, the film steps back at the conclusion. What could be the outcome for the investigator or to the high officer (her supreme commander)?  Perhaps this additional step was too difficult to take, even for the creators of the film.
Still, even by posing extremely difficult questions - the film fulfills an important mission.",1501718400,,841,4.6824324324324325
8561769,4,B00B2TURYC,"Good film, shows the difficulty Israelis must live with while trying to maintain justice for all and protect themselves from terror. Also, helps to understand the Palestinians point of view of their treatment by Israeli military. This film shows sexism, PTSD and how even the strongest people can crack under intense pressure of war. The sex scene and lack of morals annoyed me but was realitic.
As was some of the unprofessionalism ie. mother calling her daughter at work. Sex on the job with a subordinate. The ending was a bit predictable.
Acting by the female protagonist was well done.",1501286400,,590,4.91
8561770,5,B00B2TURYC,"Asia Naifeld is unbelievable in this movie . I enjoyed her acting tremendously. She is way more powerful than the story line that deals with the conflict between the good guys and the bad guys in the military hierarchy.

8561774,5,B00B2TURYC,Must see. Two sections of the same army doing their job bang heads and one protects the other to be able to be safe and do their job and the one being kept safe must try to bring another down for a bending of what is accepted in the field. A tragic story in a tragic part of the world. Fantastic acting. One would think these people were actually in the army. If they are Israeli born citizens then they were subject to mandatory draft after high school at age 18. The general at the end looked like a real general,1481241600,,514,4.099009900990099
