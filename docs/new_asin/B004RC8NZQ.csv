4460381,4,B004RC8NZQ,"Johnny Ferro and Stephen Tyrone Williams are tragic interracial lovers in a story that beautifully exposes pervasive homophobia and hypocricy plaguing Carribean culture, especially Jamaica. (My African and Carribean co-workers are especially homophobic!) Williams and Ferro are a color-coordinated drop dead gorgeous couple surrounded by breathtaking Bahamian scenery. Ferro's face is perfectly sweet and angelic while Stephen's expressive face and perfectly sculptured flawless body are chocolate candy for the soul.

Margaret Kemp positively sparkles and I am looking forward to seeing more gay films from Kareem Mortimer, a truly sensitive and relevant filmmaker.",1311379200,,666,6.161290322580645
4460382,5,B004RC8NZQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed this video.  I hadn't heard of it prior to seeing it on cable and I had to get it.  This video shows a lot of the misconceptions about homosexual, those who give homosexuals the bad reputation it has, and those who don't understand the life of a same gender loving individual.",1311033600,,297,4.481481481481482
4460383,2,B004RC8NZQ,"Children of God is the feature-length expansion of a short movie called Float, about an uptight young gay white guy (Johnny) and a laid-back, mostly straight black guy (Romeo) who hook up in the Bahamas, where they both are natives. It was made by the same writer/director as Float and stars the same actor (Stephen Tyrone Williams) in the role of Romeo.

It differs from Float primarily in three ways: a different actor plays Johnny; a parallel story of an intensely homophobic woman and her lying preacher husband is added; and the ending is changed. Only the first of those changes is an improvement.

Johnny Ferro (playing Johnny) is gorgeous, charismatic, sensitive, sweet, shy, brooding, and very, VERY sexy; so it is totally believable that anyone on earth would fall for him. (The huge flaw in Float was that the poor actor who played Johnny was none of the above.) The story between Romeo and Johnny is practically identical to Float, and adding Johnny Ferro really makes it shine.

But the side story of the lying preacher is just too corny and overwrought to believe. It doesn't fit with the Romeo/Johnny story at all, so it is only an annoying distraction. And the ending is just as bad: forced, clumsy, and painfully predictable all at the same time. The director should have cast Johnny Ferro in Float and stopped there, or remade Float with the vastly improved Johnny.

Float with the right Johnny would be a lovely gem, but Children of God just does not work. However... I have never seen Ferro anywhere before, so just for introducing him to the world I gladly give this movie three stars. Except for the fact that Johnny Ferro is not in it, Float is a better movie.

UPDATE 07-16-2011:

I watched this movie again, and I have deducted one star from my original three. Although casting Johnny Ferro was an excellent decision, even the Romeo/Johnny story is much weaker than it was in Float. Overall this is a messy, frustrating movie that tries too much and accomplishes too little; and this time (in contrast to Float) it is Stephen Williams as Romeo who is miscast. He simply is not credible playing a gay man (Romeo was not gay in Float, but it seems that he is supposed to be gay in this one). I still give it two stars for introducing the remarkable Ferro, but that doesn't entirely compensate for an otherwise lousy movie. You can see more of my reasoning in the comment section below.

Float is included on this DVD, but I would advise anyone who wants to see it to get the compilation DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Not-Gay/dp/B00134YQNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Not Gay</a>&nbsp;instead. It includes three other shorts about gay men relating to straight men, and two of those shorts are excellent, better than Float and MUCH better than Children of God.",1310515200,3,2829,4.905857740585774

4460386,5,B004RC8NZQ,"This very beautifully photographed, wonderfully directed and greatly acted film was a most enjoyable ""movie experience"" for me.  Although the movie exposes a lot of really nasty ""anti-gay"" hypocrisy and feelings, the main focus of the film is really a lovely love story between Romeo and Johnny and because of that love the aforesaid characters find themselves and are able to deal with the nastiness that they encounter in the beautiful Bahamas.

 All of the acting, in this movie is superb.  However, I must single out that Stephen Tyrone Jones, as Romeo,  is marvelous as the Bahamian young man that finds himself and is willing to accept what he really is ""about"".  The actress Margaret Kemp that plays the ""anti-gay"" minister's wife is really great too in this film.  At one moment she spewing out  very vehement and venomous ""anti-gay"" rants that are so convincing that I wanted to throttle her and the next moment , I found myself feeling very sorry for her and what she was dealing with finding that her super holy husband wasn't so holy after all.  My god, she's a good actress.

Set in the idyllic world of the Bahamas, a blocker painter (Johnny Ferro) searches for inspiration for his painting but instead finds inspiration in the arms of another lost soul (Stephen Tyrone Williams). Director Kareem Mortimer has set this beautiful story in an island paradise.  But the characters he has created keep finding ways to keep paradise from coming true for them. The acting in this movie is revelatory. All of he performances are top notch, especially those by Johnny Ferro, Stephen Tyrone Williams and Margaret Laurena Kemp.

Having seen the short film Float, on which this movie is based, I was so pleased to see production qualities in nearly every area greatly improved over the original. The movie captivated me and got me emotionally involved in the story line. The acting was outstanding. Layers of sub-stories were added to the original, adding complexity and mystery to the story. But when I got to the end --SPOILERS AHEAD--, I was blown away at the changes to the original ending. The killing of one of the two lead characters was completely unnecessary, in fact it did violence to the rest of the storyline and felt out of place. It was a gratuitous attempt to add drama to the story, making it a tragedy instead of a true personal triumph and overcoming. I went back and watched Float again, and though the short film had many rough edges, the ending was consistent with the progression of the storyline. I am torn with giving Rivers Wash Over Me 5 stars for its excellence in nearly all ways, and 1 star for the betrayal I felt with the altered ending.

As the characters in the story try to deny, ignore, suppress, and even force same sex love go away, people are hurt emotionally and physically. Some characters pretend to be vehemently opposed to same sex lifestyles in public, while secretly acting out their forbidden sexual passions. Then there is the preacher and friend, who see the two men in love with each other as not being any different from anybody else.

4460420,5,B004RC8NZQ,"This movie is top quality.

Johnny and Romeo are two young Bahamian men who fall in love.  I've seen reviewers dwell on their interracial relationship.  To me that wasn't such a big theme, other than the differing degree of cultural taboo against being gay.  It's easy to see how Johnny and Romeo found beauty in each other.  The camera certainly loves them.  How they contrast and complement each other on screen is stunning.  So I encourage anticipating this lovely element of an interracial story.  These two characters just add to the overall feast of beauty in this movie from beginning to end.  If not for the anti-gay tyranny, this would have been a great commercial to travel the Bahamas.

I agree with other viewers the acting was top notch all the way around.  How the movie weaves the arc of the story right through to the very ending made me catch my breath.  A final expert touch of storytelling.",1368316800,4,909,4.647798742138365

4460430,1,B004RC8NZQ,"These four and five star reviews are absurd for such a very crudely made student film.  Amazon has been gamed by sock puppet reviewers--apparently with some kind of stake in the film--writing totally over-the-top raves for a very simple-minded movie about the hateful bigotry of the evangelical right, which, I am depressed to report, is hardly a revelation.

Seriously, please take a look for yourself and ask if this really measures up to four and five star international films.  There is a faction who believe that GBLT movies deserve some kind of special dispensation--sort of like a Special Olympics for cinematically challenged gay filmmakers--which is insulting and demeaning.  Is there any rational reason why filmmakers should be judged less rigorously because they have a minority affectionate preference or choose GBLT subject matter.  It's absurd.

Joel Shumacher, Gus Van Sant and William Friedkin are three very accomplished filmmakers--whatever one may think of their respective bodies of work--who never asked to be excused from making successful pictures merely because they were queer.

The movie is crap, and even on it's on terms, an incoherent mess.  The white protagonist gets killed because he taunts a young black man about the size of his penis in front of the black kid's friends.  Could anyone possibly be so braindead?  Similarly, preaching to the choir while lobbing stink bombs at the religious right is never going to help anyone and only incites the bigots to become more entrenched in their beliefs that GBLT people are despicable fools.

This is a student film that never should have seen wide release on video.  The filmmaker has much to learn about effectively using the movie medium.  For starters, he could heed Samuel Goldwyn, who knew from movies, and his famous dictum: ""If you have a message, send a telegram.""

There are far more subtle, skilled, and useful means to broaden awareness than this ham-fisted polemic.  Sadly, I have already gone over the top of the heads of these overly enthusiatic kids gushing such glowing reviews of first time student effort.  I fear ""ham-fisted polemic"" is too complex a concept for these wannabe publicists to grasp.

BTW, The first essential quality for a successful publicist is credibility.  If you expect any major media outlet to take your call after hitching your wagon to this manure, you are in for a major disillionment.  Time to grow up and get real.",1331337600,7,2440,5.0701754385964914
4460431,4,B004RC8NZQ,"Coming into the film you are introduced to your thoughtful main character who turns out to be a brooding young artist; it's been done, but I suppose it's true that artists do feel more. Johnny (main) has a missed coital opportunity with a local guy followed by a fit of remorseful vomiting. So it's not too difficult to infer that Johnny is struggling with some underlying issues. The film shifts to his art school, where his surprisingly concerned instructor notifies him that he is failing due to the lack of ""feeling"" in his work (only in art school). In order to aid her student in rediscovering his voice, the instructor offers Johnny the use of her house in Eleuthera on the condition that he paints a very specific scene, with feeling. While this is transpiring, the dichotomy of the film is revealed in the unfolding story of a religious leader's wife (Lena) struggling with the news that she has contracted a venereal disease. Her husband, who it turns out is using his religious influence to rally people against the homosexual rights movement taking place in the Bahamas, is having clandestine affairs with other men (what a twist) and infected his wife, though he won't admit it.

The underlying point of contention in the film is the issue of homosexual rights in the Bahamas, so after Lena is brutally rebuffed by her husband upon receiving the news that she is infected, Lena takes their son to Eleuthera while she organizes a rally against homosexuality being tolerated in their country. It's on this trip that Johnny meets his counterpart in the film, a local man named Romeo who it turns out went to highschool with him. Romeo helps Johnny move his vehicle and they begin a fledgling romance after having a swim together. This romance is complicated by Romeo's need to keep up the appearance of being heterosexual; this conflict comes to a head at a beach-front gathering where Romeo is with his girlfriend and rebuffs Johnny openly. Along the way Lena finds comfort in the arms of the kind, alluring and I feel all too understated Reverend Clyde Ritchie (they don't actually have sex I think, just draw strength from eachother).

Johnny finds his way to Reverend Clyde after being rejected by Romeo, where the two have a truly meaningful and unexpected interaction, a reaffirmation of life.

This film does play on some cliches, the brooding, lonely artist, the evil, closeted minister, the gay character who can't accept himself, so he lashes out; I think first and foremost though, it keeps you concerned about the issue of accpeting homosexuality and it forces you to care about the lives of the characters, also the filmmakers didn't play up the interracial romance card which they certainly could have, it was refreshing.
Ultimately, the issue of Lena and her husband resolves itself with subtlety at a family dinner (for the most part), where Romeo also begins to accept his feelings for Johnny. Then comes one of the most hackneyed movie cliches at the end, an attempt to ramp up the poignancy, relevance and staying power of the film I feel; I also feel this was a miss, the film could have achieved greater meaning and lasted longer had the filmmakers chosen to think a bit outside rahter than going to the extreme (it seems every gay film that wants to be taken seriously goes this route).

In no way am I discouraging anyone from viewing this film, it's beautifully shot, well acted; it just staggers at the end, falling short of a satisfactory conclusion. Still, a marvelous effort, also Johnny Ferro and Van Brown were both a joy to watch.",1331078400,4,3571,4.792207792207792
4460432,5,B004RC8NZQ,"This movie was great.

It depicted several topics and bridged them all into one. The movie dealt with the struggling homosexual man whom is married, the male that grew up playing with female toys, the male that had to live up to family standards, the male who was scrutinized for being gay due to cultural beliefs, and lastly, the man who was attracted to the opposite race.

This movie compare and contrast several components with how homosexuality is growing in the sense of acceptance and normality. Religion in this film is displayed as horrible, judgemental, and intolerable towards the homosexual persons. It makes the homosexual person believe that God will never ever love or forgive the homosexual sin, as we know it to be. One of the parent's in this movie went as far as stating that she wish her son would be on drugs instead of a homosexual. This climax changes drastically and keep the viewer(s) waiting for more.

The ending will take you by surprise. Reason? You would have suspected more. However, it ended in reality of abuse due to one's sexuality. Later, it crescendos to the last few minutes of something no man can take away from you. That is your ability to DREAM ABOVE HUMAN AWARENESS. The soul never dies and is free to explore in ecstasy and pure unconditional love.

I give this movie 5 stars. Not because of the glitches you would find in the acting or settings, but on the over-all plot itself. Priceless!!!

4460433,4,B004RC8NZQ,"This is somewhat of a tragic story, but still good as it illustrates how a couple of guys ultimately overcome the anxiety and fear of disapproval associated with their coming out--but for very different reasons.  One of the characters comes to grips with the importance of being true to himself (coming out) more from an existential standpoint (basically accepting that he's gay because God made him that way and there's nothing ""wrong"" with him because of it), and the other main character comes to grips with his need to come out more because his staying in the closet has caused him to lose someone he really loves.  This is the main plot of the story although there are some pretty clear subplots concerned with societal and religious discrimination against gays as well as the fact that there are people ""on the down-low"" that you might never expect. With everything all woven together, I found that one of the take-away messages (at least in my opinion) is that while society on the one-hand is upset with gay people ""sneaking around"" with regard to their sexuality, they on the other hand basically have created such a threatening environment for people who don't fit the accepted heterosexual norm that they FORCE people to sneak around and be less than genuine even to their closest friends and family (and sometimes, these people actually would be very accepting if they only knew!).  Anyway, I didn't mean to get into too much psychobabble here, but I just felt the story was thought provoking from a number of angles.  Also, it doesn't hurt that the main characters are cute and charming, and the setting is often beautiful (at least to those of us who like tropical places).

If you could pretend that the rest of this film is pathos-building background noise, the tender romance between the two principals is stellar. Unfortunately, so much time is given to the noise to disallow focus on the real story - the romance between Romeo and Johnny. The performances by Messrs. Williams and Ferro are close-to perfect and few of the peripheral performances get in the way. You don't have to be Bahamian to recognize the familial and social wars in this film. You don't have to be from a Black, Christian family, either, but I certainly related to most of the family issues. The scene with the doll, while not identical to anything I've experienced, certainly struck a few nerves in my personal narrative. True, unusual, and not-just-a-little heartbreaking, ""Children of God"" is a welcome addition to my have-viewed list.",1324857600,,1112,5.081967213114754
4460435,5,B004RC8NZQ,"Blonde, blue-eyed Johnny is a native Bahamian, attending art school on a scholarship, and dealing with the fact that he is gay in a society that is highly homophobic.  His art teacher suggests his work would improve with a change of scenery, so he travels to the nearby island of Eleuthera, where he meets a friendly and attractive black musician, Romeo, with whom he slowly learns to open himself up to new experiences, as well as a sexual relationship. Unfortunately, Romeo also has a fiance', and, although Johnny is not the first boy he has taken to bed, he is the first one that truly makes him wish he had the courage to be whom he really is.  The story develops amid an atmosphere of bigotry and violence justified as religion, as activists attempt to force a vote assuring that the Bahamas denies any kind of rights to homosexuals.

This is an emotional, well-told coming-of-age story, teaching tolerance and self-acceptance amid adversity and misunderstanding.  The photography is also exceptionally beautiful, including several underwater scenes. Acting is very good, and has won awards at several film festivals.  DVD extras include extended numerous deleted scenes (a couple of which I would have left in, to make the film a bit easier to comprehend), Kareem Mortimer;s (writer/director) commentary, and Mortimer's 2007 short film ""Float"" on which the longer film is based.  Absolutely, five full stars out of five.",1322784000,2,1427,5.051063829787234
4460436,4,B004RC8NZQ,"I truly enjoyed this movie and I watched it only because it was recommemded. The story line, the plot, I loved, but the ending was predictable. Even real life doesn't always end like that! I wasn't even looking for a ""Fairy Tale Ending, "" but with all that was put out there, the ending in my opinion could of had a little more depth! Overall, it was a great movie.",1320451200,5,365,4.228571428571429
4460437,3,B004RC8NZQ,"I have to add my review to the others that I didn't care about the characters either. So, while the acting may have been strong, something was missing. Also if you're looking for an uplifting, romantic gay movie... you won't find it here. What I will say was that other parts of the film seemed well done. There was success in the tying up of the pieces throughout the film, so kudos to the writer, director. The cinematography was shot decently. There was definitely lots of angst with all the characters. Yet, I felt nothing for any of them. Maybe it needed more character development.

I was disappointed because I expected it to be wonderful. And it wasn't. Even in it's genre. I thought it might be a romantic film, which it wasn't. It was more docu-drama or just drama. But, I'm rating this more on the film itself and not my disappointment in wanting a romantic story and finding a depressing drama.

SPOILER: The ending is NOT uplifting. IMO. And while probably close to reality in the Islands, it's not something I'd like to see.",1318550400,2,1038,4.575268817204301

4460441,4,B004RC8NZQ,"I strive only to own movies that I think are so good I'd want to view them more than once or twice. I saw this movie first on a premium cable movie channel. And when it was over, I immediately logged onto my computer to buy a copy of it to own.

The movie is extremely well acted with a great script and directed very well. It is not one of those low budget movies where the acting is of amateur quality and the filming and script atrocious. This is no 'B' Movie. It is a quality film that describes a love affair that happens in the midst of intolerance and oppression.

The emotional empathy conjured by the film of love found amid extreme bigotry, a love deep and ever lasting transcending life itself, was powerful and brought tears to my eyes several times. Also, there are not too many gay films that deal with the racial issue of a relationship about a white guy and an black guy. And not being that attracted to black guys myself, at first glance, reading about this film, I wasn't that interested because I didn't know if I could relate. But, boy was I wrong. I actually found the black guy more attractive physically than the cute white guy. But it was the transcendental and universal concept of the deep love between two people that was socially forbidden which I related to whole-heartedly.

The extreme anti-gay sentiment of the entire Jamaican society, where this story takes place, is well known. The bigotry, intolerance and oppression against homosexuality is endemic in Jamaica and condoned and encouraged by the government. To tell the story a love affair in such a bigoted climate took an act of courage not only for the characters in the story, but also on behalf of the actors and the film makers.

This is a extremely good film that will leave you very emotional. It teaches many lessons and offers up the hope that some day, love can actually conquer all, that love, any kind of love, is far better than hatred, no matter what the reason.

The story of forbidden love is an old one, and like Romeo and Juliet, this does not have a happy ending. The only reason I did not award this movie 5 stars is because, as is the case too often in gay themed movies, it ends in sadness or tragedy. It is however an extremely powerful film and I highly recommend it.",1315699200,2,2278,4.440191387559809
4460442,4,B004RC8NZQ,"This movie is very satisfying. I almost gave it 5 stars. Finally there is a movie that shows different types of gay people which makes the film more realistic. I was rooting for the female lead character because I really wanted her to come to her senses. She is shown in many lights and I love how real she is even if she is wrong in her beliefs, other than that she is so beautiful and you will grow to love her too, I promise. I love the two main characters who happen to be gay, they display a romance that some people may not expect but you will love them. I read someone's review and saw this movie so I am now also very very glad and excited about this movie. I'm happy I watched it and hopefully someone will watch it because of my review.",1315526400,6,746,4.081632653061225
4460443,4,B004RC8NZQ,"Not perfect, but very well done film about conflict between faith and sexuality.
Another proof that Christianity isn't such tolerant religion as it seems to be. There are still countries in Europe which could have been used as background in this story. Narrow-minded people, bigots (such as this closeted preacher) live everywhere.",1314316800,,331,5.384615384615385
4460444,2,B004RC8NZQ,"I applaud any director/writer taking on current issues concerning the LGBT community. Children of God attempted to tackle some heavy issues: religious persecution, nurture vs. nature, self discovery/acceptance, being on the downlow, etc. It failed on almost every attempt, at least for me. I've seen dozens of the latest TLA movies and one thing consistently lacking in characters (oddly it seems to be an American trait) is chemistry. I mean really, these guys were great actors. Johnny Ferro and Stephen Williams did an excellent job being realistic in most aspects of the film but failed miserably in convincingly portraying two guys that liked men. It was awkward and grade school, and redundant to a dozen films before it where the characters peck each other on the lips and embrace like their arms would shatter if they squeeze too tightly.

While their relationship was but a portion of the film, and honestly, I wasn't expecting fifteen minutes of making out, I felt like the director ultimately collapsed under his fears of being 'too gay'. The opening scene was an unnecessary shot of a woman's naked torso, breast and all. Any intimacy between the men was quickly scaled down to frantic touching, talking, and dancing in a circle with their shirts off. I mean if you are going to go for it--GO for it.

The split story regarding the preacher/wife/whatever the hell the husband was, just distracted me from what I really wanted to focus on. It was as if their storyline was a filler for the lack of plot dedicated to Romeo and Johnny's story.

I would assume that most directors,producers, and writers attempt to endear their characters to the viewers so that when something happens--both good and bad--you react accordingly. I found detachment from these characters fairly easy. Throughout the movie I could not drag myself out of the well of disappointment to really care where it was going and how it ended.

I don't know what these filmmakers need. Gay actors maybe. Or straight actors who can convincingly portray any sexual preference. If you can't convince the audience of true passion,love,or commitment the rest goes down hill pretty freaking fast.

Some good TLA videos with convincing characters and solid story lines: The String, From Beginning to End, and Eyes Wide Open.",1313280000,5,2294,4.994764397905759
4460445,5,B004RC8NZQ,"CHILDREN OF GOD takes place in Nassau and on the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas.
This film is beautifully shot, the acting powerful and moving. The two leading men played by Stephen Tyrone Williams and Johnny Ferro are handsome, sensual and seem like real people to the viewer. Colorful island scenes border on breathtaking. Sunsets, underwater footage, a jump from Rainbow Cliffs; it's a jewel of cinematography. There are several subplots that weave in and around a budding romance between two Bahamian men and the portrayal of institutional homophobia that challenges and complicates their relationship. Most non-Bahamians do not know that this island nation banned BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN and considers itself a 'Christian Nation' meaning that essentially there is no separation between church and state. In this case the church sponsors the homophobia that Romeo and Johnny are confronted with throughout the film. I suggest watching the deleted scenes and director's commentary as well. These extras bring you even closer to a story that needs to be told and a film that must be seen.",1311552000,3,1089,5.228571428571429

They spend the entire movie building up the main character, only to kill him off in the last 10 minutes of the movie, and most times, it is a senseless and meaningless death.  In the final scene of the movie, someone that nobody knows, stabs the main character, and he dies. What is the point that the writers are trying to deliver to the audience??  That many gay relationships end in death?  That gays should die?  Can the directors, writers, and producers of these movies come up with a more imaginative ending?  I am stunned, at what they think is their brilliance, in killing off the main character!  Many times it is by a stabbing or shooting, and by someone who comes out of no where.  I cannot give this movie more than 1 star, for that reason.  And that is a shame... because up until the final scenes, this movie had a lot of potential.  Producers need to take a deep breath and come at these movies from a different angle; like showing more imaginative, creative, and positive endings in their movies.  It is as if the writers run out of ideas when they get to the end of the movie, so they just kill off the main character.",1471046400,3,1310,4.363636363636363
