1420835,4,B00005B216,"The instruction is fabulous. I've applied tips from this DVD to my other Pilates DVD(Jennifer Kries' Perfect Mix). The workout is 40 minutes long and definitely do-able for all fitness levels. They provide challenging (and easier) modifications to accommodate varying fitness levels. This is a Pilates workout you can definitely grow with. It makes an excellent first Pilates DVD. I feel a pleasant burn following this workout, especially in the upper abs, rib area, and obliques. The soundtrack is wonderful...with a more classical bent and beautiful singing at the cooldown. The music enhances (and doesn't distract you from) this great workout.",1096848000,,647,5.415841584158416
1420836,1,B00005B216,"This was very disappointing and non motivating instruction.  They did not really go over breathing very well, which is so essential in Pilates.  Did not provide any good visuals mentally to help you relax and get into the exercises.  The women instructors were very boring and stiff.  My past instructors at the gym were so much more fun and motivating.  I wish they would do a video.  Totally inappropriate title of ""Breakthru Pilates""",1086652800,2,436,4.904109589041096
1420837,4,B00005B216,"This video is not recommended for beginners. I've been doing yoga for over a year and Pilates for a few months and I found this video to be a bit of a challenge.  You really need to have strong abs to perform the workout here.  The workout is about 30 minutes long but it's long enough to get a decent workout.  This Pilates workout focuses on one's core: the stomach, back, and buns. The exercises target these muscle groups in a series of no-impact workouts that allow one to tone muscles, flatten abs, and improve posture.  This is one video I'll be adding to my collection.",1080604800,,577,4.415094339622642
1420838,4,B00005B216,"Good workout - Michelle and Tracy give good instructions and keep things moving at a good pace.  The workout is all done on the floor - no standing work.  Since the total tape is only about 30 minutes long, I often tack it onto the end of my workout and find that it also helps me to unwind, center, and relax.  This tape is not very difficult, but it does provide a good workout even for an intermediate.",1074470400,,405,4.166666666666667
1420839,4,B00005B216,We get regular use out of this disc.  Challenging without being difficult.,1053993600,,74,5.166666666666667
1420840,5,B00005B216,"This is the first pilates video I've ever bought, and I loved it. I take pilates class now, and I think this was a great introduction. After a while, it gets simple, but it's still fun. Although it's an excellent beginner workout, it does get easy quickly. Still, I'd recommend this video to anyone.",1044057600,,299,4.555555555555555
1420841,2,B00005B216,"I have been practicing Pilates for two years and own eight Pilates videos.  What I have enjoyed the most about Pilates is the serenity and fluidity that goes along with the teachings.  If you have never tried Pilates you may like this tape however, if you have been accustomed to the quiet teachings and svelte instructors this video may not be to your liking.  In my opinion this video lacks fluidity and concentration which are essential components in Pilates.  Although the instructos do offer several movements I have never done I was afraid to bulk up like the instructors so I figured it was best for me to stay with my tried and true Pilates teachings.",993254400,19,659,4.655172413793103
1420842,5,B00005B216,"This is probably my new favorite Pilates tape.  Clocking in at 40 min. this works you out from tip to toe.  Previous Pilates experience is recommended.  Most tapes work the core and lower body, with this you get some challenging upper body work.  There are some push-up variations as well as a bridge exercise where you are up on your elbows and alternate leg lifts.  It works everything. Also, there's an exercise on your back, where you rotate an imaginary ball with your legs.  That really works the abs.  The instructors are very informative and give explicit direction ""imagine your spine in a C shape"", ""pull the navel back to the spine"".  At this price you get more than your money's worth.",990835200,24,697,4.655737704918033
7936648,5,B00005B216,"I love this video. I've been doing on and off for about 15 years. I actually have it on VHS, I was so happy to find it on DVD! Since my VCR needs to go!",1490227200,,152,3.3714285714285714
7936649,5,B00005B216,Perfect condition just like the VHS my fiance used to have.  She loved it.,1439769600,,74,4.285714285714286

7936651,5,B00005B216,"I never tried pilates until I found this in the library; then I bought it because I liked it so much. This DVD is great and surprisingly effective at toning and strength training for your abs. It doesn't seem like you're doing much at the time, but the next day you can feel it. The instructors are laid back and the music is mellow so it's a relaxing experience and more like a yoga session. It's not very long so I'm more apt to do it if I'm running low on time to exercise. I enjoyed this DVD and the instructors so much I then ""graduated"" to their Breakthru Pilates Sculpt DVD which I also love. It's more cardio and uses weights.",1404000000,,634,4.204918032786885
7936652,5,B00005B216,This really does give a good workout to the core muscles.  I do regular workouts but wanted a core workout that also would help elongate the muscles.  Several moves are a challenge for me to even attempt but look forward to improving with continued use.,1386979200,,253,4.6
7936653,1,B00005B216,"I have done pilates before and thought this dvd sounded like it was what I was looking for,but I injured my neck and would not recommend anyone trying this. There are others out there that are safer. Perhaps because it is a little dated techniques may have improved since then.",1384128000,,277,4.56
7936654,5,B00005B216,"Following this program transformed my body...I'm not exaggerating! There are many fitness videos to choose from and these two instructors, Michelle Dozois and Tracy York, keep a nice pace, explain the poses clearly without taking forever and help make the excersizes enjoyable. My midsection tightened, my legs have become more shapely and my ankles have become more slender...I have no idea how that happened! Thanks for a great fitness tape.",1383436800,,443,5.3428571428571425
7936655,5,B00005B216,"I was given this edition from a friend on VHS. However, I wanted it on DVD except when I went to order it, it was either pretty expensive or unavailable. So I was able to place the order, recieve it and use it within days. The DVD was in great shape like new and a great price too!",1313884800,,281,3.8620689655172415
7936656,4,B00005B216,"After doing the Windsor Pilates for about a year, I decided to try someone different. I have done Tracey York's workouts in the past and found them challenging but not impossible with repeat workouts. The presentation was slow at times but they can be fast forwarded. I really liked the workout and felt it was more targeted than the Windsor's. I will be trying some of the other workouts. Tracey and Michelle worked well together and taking turns made it easier to get to ""know"" both the instructors.",1138492800,,501,4.704545454545454
7936657,3,B00005B216,"This is a fairly nice introductory video, with nice instruction and reminders about form and breathing. It goes a little slow, with pauses and instructions in between some of the exercises (not all). Some of the exercises are very challenging. I've been working out for a solid month every day, and was not able to do a few of them, so beginners may have to skip or modify some exercises (or better yet...get a more appropriate beginners video). The instructors are encouraging but don't make many suggestions for modifications.

Overall, an OK pilates video, but you can do better for both instructional quality (see instructor Ana Caban) or non-stop routines without pauses. I checked this one out from my local library, and after trying it out, I wouldn't buy it. Netflix does have this title available for rental.",1126915200,,817,4.920289855072464
