8728246,4,B013OR14H8,"A reasonably sturdy offering here despite a few low rent blemishes.

The basic premise is that there is a Korean weapon that has been smuggled out of the country and ended up in Hong Kong to be traded. As you can imagine neither the Koreans nor Chinese are thrilled with this scenario. While a joint Korean/Chinese team tries to work their way towards recovering the weapon a rather ruthless duo are trying to secure it for their own purposes. As the movie progresses we find out that the main suspect for who would want to get their hands on the weapon is a dastardly mastermind known as Helios - hence the title.

As noted above there are a couple of points where your suspension of disbelief will be tested - mostly in relation to the weapon - but outside of that this is a reasonably taut action film that eschews the usual labyrinthine Chinese action film subplots and inexplicable behaviours. While there are some twists they are linear enough for those following the subtitles to follow.... if you follow me...

Acting is OK, cinematography and editing are fine and there are some nicely resolved action set pieces. There are subtitles in English which basically make sense - unlike those on, say, Lazy Hazy Crazy which I viewed on a few days ago - and overall this is a useful Sunday afternoon action flick.

The ending makes it clear that they intend further movies. Hopefully they'll be of the same useful nature.",1471046400,,1423,4.657370517928287
