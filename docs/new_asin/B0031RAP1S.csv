8387254,4,B0031RAP1S,"Really love this guy and am surprised by his recent invisibility; nonetheless, the DVD is below the standard of what I'd previously seen on TV. He's still fresh, funny and interesting, but much of the manic hysteria is gone or sedated. Like Pee Wee Herman's high voice, it must be tough to sustain that for long periods. Regardless, I'd recommend this DVD highly. Favorite joke [no spoiler alert necessary]: what he says about his dog being a rescue. Positively brilliant!",1418860800,,472,4.9125
8387255,5,B0031RAP1S,"Good in parts, eg the America/Canada bit, but falls a bit flat when he tries to improvise with the audience.",1410739200,,108,4.45
8387256,5,B0031RAP1S,"Hilarious comic who I've actually gotten to see live. If you have not seen him yet, look up some of his videos online first just to get a taste for him before you buy this.",1405296000,,172,3.942857142857143
8387257,5,B0031RAP1S,if you haven't seen him before this guy will crack you up. me and my wife love watching him perform. Hope he makes another one.,1403827200,,127,4.12
8387258,3,B0031RAP1S,"His performance on Comedy Central was a lot more polished, in terms of his delivery and the clever way he links his jokes together, giving them a common bond.  This DVD has a more ""off-the-cuff"" feel, and he talks about things that are funny to him, not necessarily about things to get a laugh from the crowd.  It wasn't bad, but if you were really impressed by his stand up special, you may be slightly disappointed by this.  If they threw in his Comedy Central Special, this would have been a far easier recommendation.  You can always see it on Amazon instant video though.",1383177600,,576,4.509615384615385
8387259,5,B0031RAP1S,"Saw Jeremy Hotz on a Comedy Central special a few years ago and thought he was hilarious. This turns out to be a completely different show, but also extremely funny. Wish he had more available.",1370995200,,193,4.542857142857143
8387260,5,B0031RAP1S,"This comic is so orginal with his topics and delivery that it is well worth the selling price! He is very funny and likable! Likability is really what stand-up is all about ! The dvd has some good extras so one can get to know this comedian ! He does a great bit on the dvd ""just for laughs: over the edge"" also! JUST a great comedian !",1367539200,,336,3.9558823529411766
