8394534,5,B003CWEQE4,"""Obama's Deal"" is the story of President Obama's attempts to get health care reform and why, ultimately, it was pretty much a complete failure. I use this DVD in my Public Policy course because it does the following things very, very well:

1) Shows how the legislative process works; watching this, you'll learn a lot about Congress and all the behind-the-doors deal-making that goes on

2) Demonstrates the power of lobbyists and large, private sector companies to HEAVILY influence which policies get passed and which never make it to Congress

3) Provides a realistic portrayal of the conflict politicians face between wanting to act as idealists, trying to fulfill their campaign promises, and as effective politicians, forced to compromise--legislatively and ethically--in order to get anything accomplished

In a world where most movies/documentaries about politics are little more than partisan slandering and/or celebrity-politician gossip, this program provides a very sobering look at how the political process actually works in this country.",1346371200,4,1053,5.5625
8394535,5,B003CWEQE4,Congress in action where legislators do each other for their own financial gain and big Pharma controls it all so legislation passes to benefit few regardless of the President or party affiliation.

8394538,5,B003CWEQE4,"This is a very good documentary showing how the U.S. government works. Obama has a tough job in getting the health care reform bill passed.
