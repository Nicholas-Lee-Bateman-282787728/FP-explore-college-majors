8069516,5,B0009XCZU6,"I've been working on a refit of my first boat for 2 years now, and that last frontier for me was the rigging.  I wasn't sure how to tension my shrouds, and this video made it easy.  True, there's not much to it - but only if you know what you're doing.  Brian covers not only exactly what to do, but the theory behind it so you can apply his tuning examples to your specific rig.  If you have boat yard tune your rig, buy this video and it will pay for itself in one season.  The confidence that comes with this knowledge is a great deposit in your boat's little back box.",1315353600,,572,4.0265486725663715

8069519,5,B0009XCZU6,"Mostly,I want to comment on the instructor/tutor,Brion Toss. He is excellent,excellent,excellent:personality,humor,know how. And

kool. But that's just my opinion. I would encourage the producers

to make more of these tutorial videos featuring him.",1140825600,,249,6.515151515151516
8069520,5,B0009XCZU6,"Toss is a great teacher, very calm, articulate, and methodical. His ""bungie rig"" (visual teaching aid) is excellent, and demonstrates how the rigging works and that the mast and rigging are a system, not just separate wires to be tensioned. Step-by-step he takes the viewer through the tuning of of several rigs and explains not only what to do but what not to do to tune a rig.  He demonstrates how to hear the wire tention, feel the wire tention, and to use mechanical guage's to measure the tention of a wire. The DVD covers a static(dockside,no load) and dynamic(on the water, loaded)tuning. The goal being to get the whole system working together to maximise, boat speed, performance, and safety.  Very well done.",1140739200,6,718,4.829268292682927
8069521,5,B0009XCZU6,"This video explains the science and the art behind tuning your sailboats rigging. Of course, I had to watch it 20 times before attempting to tune my boat. In fact, I'm ordering the DVD version to replace my worn out VHS version.",1120867200,2,228,4.4523809523809526
