8664638,3,B00L9IJ4HC,"It is doubtful that anyone other than a true Sherlockian would be interested in this collection.  For decades, we have read about Eille Norwood's portrayal of the Great Detective but have been unable to see it.  Well, here it is.  The set includes three Norwood features from the Stoll Company and ""The Copper Beeches"" which is a very early silent Holmes film which predates Norwood's performances as well as a newsreel interview with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  There has been no restoration done to the films and the images display blurring and fading and, especially ""The Copper Beeches"" scratches and damage.  The music on the soundtracks of the silent films is classical ( Beetohoven) and bears no relation to the action.
A better buy is ""Sherlock Holmes: The Archive Collection Vol. 1.""  You get only one Norwood feature (""The Man With the Twisted Lip"") but it's the same quality and you get the Doyle interview as well as ""The Copper Beeches and several other Holmes features, including a couple of very early TV presentations of Sherlock Holmes.  All for a few dollars less than this set.",1457654400,,1093,4.844086021505376
