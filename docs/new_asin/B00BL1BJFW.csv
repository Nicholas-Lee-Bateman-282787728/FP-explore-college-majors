You have been diagnosed with Iron Man 3. Symptoms may include:

The Oily Discharge, The Trapped Under Something Heavy, The Friend in The Hospital, The Trapped Under Something Heavy Again, The Trapped Under Something Heavy For The Third And Fourth Times, The Buddy Flick, The Double Cross, The Identity Crisis, The Panic Attack, The Rocky Relationship, The President in Danger, The Villain Monologue(s), The Glorified Extra, The Evil War Veteran, The Trapped Under Something Underwater, The Henchman, The I Can't Quite Reach You, The Falling, The Annoying Little Aryan Boy, The Christmas Movie, The Wisecrack, The Ex Girlfriend, The Product Placement, The Happy Ending and The Trapped Under Something Heavy With Fire.

Either every scene was written by a totally different person or they filmed six months of an Iron Man TV show and spliced 23 episodes down to two hours.

Aside from the absolutely hilarious and priceless Ben Kingsley and the inventive Robert Downey Jr., this is the biggest stinky floater of a train wreck script made since Batman and Robin. I'd blame Shane Black, but the best thing he was ever a part of was McTiernan's Predator, and they killed his character off quickly in that jungle. Marvel Comics is working as hard as they can to run their properties into the ground faster than they can reboot them.

""I AM the Mandarin. It was me the whole time!""

We know, the script told us that like an hour ago, brah.

""I AM Iron Man!""

We know, that's the title of the movie.

OK, unless I get trapped under something heavy, I AM outta here.",1367539200,25,1580,4.800738007380073
5636266,5,B00BL1BJFW,"I think this is the best ""Iron Man"" until now! I loved it and, even more important (and quite incredible in fact), my wife liked it even MORE! Below you will find more of my impressions. This review in principle is FREE OF SPOILERS.

""Iron Man 3"" is a merry, cheerful adventure, very fast paced, with excellent fighting scenes, but mostly relying on humor and excellent dialogs, full of typicall Tony Stark's jokes, half acid, half bitter but always pretty funny. The story is mostly about Tony's past coming back to kick him in the butt with the maximum speed and strength, forcing him to visit places even more exotic than the wormhole in ""Avengers"", like deep ocean and rural Tennessee - and no more will be said. There are some darker moments, but general mood of this film is light - this is an amusement ride, not the voyage to the heart of the darkness.

Robert Downey Jr offers here to his public a spotless, brilliant performance, even better than in previous parts and ""Avengers"" - and honestly, I think here he is even better (funnier) than in his ""Sherlock Holmes"" franchise.

Gwyneth Paltrow is a very, very beautiful woman - but in this film she is much more than that. She is HOT, she is smoking hot, she is burning hot, she is lava hot, she literally bursts in flames so hot she is, in fact she is so hot that by moments she outshines the principal hero...))) No, for real, it is not an exaggeration - I will even hasard an opinion that in this film she reaches the degree of hotness never before attained by any other Hollywood actress...)))

Guy Pearce does well in this film. The character of Tony Stark's loyal bodyguard named Happy plays an important role. There are also some more hot bad guys and girls involved.

Dora the Explorer makes a short but remarkable appearance in her debut on the big screen - but nothing more will be said. And no, this is not a joke!

But it is Ben Kingsley, who plays the ""Mandarin"" who completely steals the show once we arrive to his evil den, which is a place of vile infamy, maleficent plots, decadent delights and rotten corruption so infamous on so many levels that it defies imagination! Believe me, in whole history of cinematographic villains, you have never seen a place so abominably unique as the horrifying hostile heretic hideous hidden hideout of ""Mandarin""! And the lord and master of this place matches it in infect depravation!

Very exceptionally for a Hollywood super blockbuster, this film is not offensive to French or Muslims. No, really. I am serious.

As I already stated above, this film is so good, that my wife, who usually is not at all into comic books and/or superheroes almost died laughing and she actually thanked me for taking her to see it (and that doesn't happen often!). Therefore I recommend it without hesitation for a viewing with your wife or girlfriend - this should be a very pleasant common experience.

I will say nothing more here. Go see it in the cinema as long as it still plays - and me, I think I will definitely buy the DVD as soon as it is available! Enjoy!",1367452800,,3066,4.5398550724637685
5636267,5,B00BL1BJFW,"EDIT: If you are marking this review as unhelpful, please comment below as I would love to hear why you think so. In order to give potential customers the most informed opinion, discourse is good - so please tell me why you don't agree (be forewarned, I may rebut). It is my intention to provide the most thorough review of the film possible without spoilers. Please refrain from posting them in the comment section of this review.

Premise: One year after the harrowing events of ""The Avengers"", Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is a changed man - he's seen things and now they're taking a toll on his psyche and his relationship with Pepper (Paltrow). When a mysterious terrorist known only as the Mandarin (Kingsley) initiates a series of terrorist attacks against the United States, tragedy hits home for Stark - stirring him to action. As Stark investigates this new foe, he learns about the technological program known as ""Extremis"" which brings him against a new line of cyber-enhanced foes that might be more than a match for Iron Man...

Thoughts: Iron Man III is Marvel's unveiling of ""Phase II"" - the lead up to Avengers II - and it presents a subtly different take on Tony Stark/Iron Man. Taking over directorial duties for Jon Favreau is Shane Black (the acclaimed inventor of the Buddy Cop genre with his screenplay for Lethal Weapon), who brings a sharp flair for humorous quirk and sharp wit, which complements Robert Downey Jr.'s performance and enhances it. This film retains the charm of its predecessors while diving head into an exceptionally exciting genre: the technological thriller. On this third go around, the cast gels - Cheadle, Paltrow, Favreau and Downey all hit the ground running. The new additions (Pearce, Kingsley, and Hall) all act as very strong foils to each of the main cast and help develop the acclaimed ""Extremis"" story line from the comics. That said, certain stylistic elements were questionable: such as the Mandarin's voice - which has heavily reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker - gets a tad old quickly but with purpose. However, this is overshadowed by better choices: such as Tony's friendship with a young boy named Harley, which illustrates a side of him we have not scene before. The film is full of unexpected surprises and touching emotional moments which make this film a must see. And like all Marvel films, be sure to stick around for after the credits for a nice little post-credit scene involving a character we have seen before in a surprising situation. ;) ""I'm not that kind of doctor...""

Should you buy this film? Absolutely. Iron Man III is the first ""Must See"" summer blockbuster of 2013 and it more than redeems Marvel for their last solo Iron Man film, which felt more like a commercial and less like a movie. Exceptionally crafted, brilliantly directed and realistically dealing with the ""why not just call the Avengers"" problem in a satisfying manner, this film will be a great collection for any fan of comics, Downey Jr. or Shane Black. For best viewing - get the Bluray: you'll get a DVD copy and a Digital copy so you can watch on the go - well worth the extra definition on the television.

IRON MAN III stars: Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall, Stephanie Szostak, James Badge Dale, Jon Favreau, Ben Kingsley",1367366400,58,3317,4.824253075571177
5636268,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Since the conclusion of Marvel's The Avengers last summer, everyone has been begging for details about how the 2012 juggernaut will impact Iron Man III.  The list of questions has been endless, but the biggest question (outside of plot points) is 'can Iron Man III live up to the worldwide success of The Avengers?'  The fact is The Avengers is the biggest summer blockbuster of all-time.  It sits at number three on the list of the top-grossing films of all-time.  So, how do you follow that kind of success?  The easiest way to answer that question is to just admit that it's silly to think any film will ever top The Avengers in terms of success - at least any other comic book film, that is.  We saw The Dark Knight Rises fall in the aftermath of The Avengers, so if Chris Nolan's Batman couldn't surpass the success of The Avengers, how can another Iron Man sequel can do it?  The answer to that question is: momentum.  Simply put, the interest created by The Avengers will most likely thrust Iron Man III to heights most people couldn't possibly imagine.  Regardless, this is just speculation and it's far too early to tell how Iron Man III will play out at the box office, but in terms of the overall quality of the film - well, we have that answer for you.

Directed by Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Iron Man III stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man.  In the wake of the events that took place during the invasion of New York, Tony Stark has not been able to sleep and frequently experiences panic attacks.  Waiting for the next big attack to strike, Stark has been in his basement building an army of Iron Men, all the while a terrorist leader, The Mandarin (Ben Kinsley), has been strategically setting off bombs all over the United States.  One of these bombs catches Stark's old body guard and new Stark Industries' chief of security, Happy Hogan, in the crossfire - which quickly gains Stark's attention.  At the same time, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearch) has made his presence known, using an ""explosive"" new state of the art rehabilitation program, known as Extremis.  Suddenly, Stark finds himself trapped in the evil web of The Mandarin, along with the impact of the Extremis program, not to mention struggling to protect the people he cares about most.  Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Rebecca Hall, and Jon Favreau also star in supporting roles.

Coming as no surprise, Iron Man III's screen time belongs largely to Robert Downey Jr.  Obviously, Downey Jr. continues with the character he's made famous and doesn't miss a beat with his usual wit and charm.  Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow both play their usual supporting roles as (respectively) the armored sidekick War Machine (now called The Iron Patriot) and the damsel in distress.  The best part of comic book films is that they're always chalked full of goodies, including character additions.  Iron Man III sees the addition of Iron Man's arch-nemesis, The Mandarin, played by Sir Ben Kinsley - who is nothing short of a treat in this film.  They honestly couldn't have picked a better actor to portray this villain (there's a huge swerve involving this character).  Finally, like Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell in the previous Iron Man films, Guy Pearce fills the role of the jealous scientist, desperate to destroy Tony Stark - just because he's smarter than everyone else.  Sadly, Pearce is probably the least interesting villain in the franchise.

Now - here's the good, the bad, and the ugly.  First and foremost, Iron Man III is a comic book lover's delight.  If you were a fan of the Extremis storyline in the comics, you'll absolutely adore what these filmmakers have done with this movie adaption.  The bad news is for the film lovers of The Avengers.  If you thought Iron Man III would be full of cameos from Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Pine, or Chris Hemsworth - you'll be very disappointed.  Without specifically spoiling anything, you will get to see at least one member of The Avengers (briefly) make an appearance.  And, the ugly has to begin with an apology.  Sorry, kids - there's no Ant-Man debut, no reference to the next Thor film, and definitely nothing to do with the mysterious Guardians of the Galaxy (unless Shane Black decides to add another scene after the fact, like Joss Whedon in The Avengers).  This film is completely centered on Tony Stark and the rest of the Iron Man characters.

Generally speaking, the plot isn't all that it's been talked up to be.  Yes, the film is full of action, and this particular sequel is Tony Stark's version of The Empire Strikes Back.  He gets an ass-kicking in this film that just keeps on giving.  However, for anyone to even compare The Avengers to Iron Man III is completely and utterly delusional about the quality and scale of these two comic book films.  For the average movie-goer, Iron Man III is on par with its predecessors, but the first Iron Man film is still the best in this trilogy.  Iron Man II has the best villains, Iron Man has the best plot, and Iron Man III is just a combination of the first two films.  Disapprovingly, the landscape of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is relatively unchanged after this film, meaning - in the grand scheme of things - Iron Man III is a bit of a letdown.  There's not much of cliffhanger and nothing overly exciting going on to lead into the next Phase II film.  Sure, it's an enjoyable, entertaining fill - but this critic can't help but want more.

Overall, Iron Man III is an average addition to the Marvel film library, but it doesn't even come close to the quality of The Avengers.  Unfortunately, the plot lacks meaningful progression for the future of the Iron Man characters (other than Pepper Potts) - yet if you're just simply looking at Iron Man III as a solo story and means of entertainment, it will be difficult to find a better action film in the summer of 2013.

Overall Film Grade:  C+

One thing for sure, the movie does address the question ""does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man"". For Marvel comic fan, especially an Iron Man lover, then you'll immediately find out that it went off the track quite a lot when you're expecting a lot of similarity to the Extremis. If you really enjoy the first two movies, you might find this one to be less satisfying in some ways.

Let's talk about hero personality exploration, this department feels a little bit empty here. Somehow, we have to figure out the thoughts inside Tony's mind and the things that trouble him the most ourselves. Seeing how the relationship between Tony and Pepper has grown though is really nice and very reassuringly comforting. Did we create our own demon or make our own enemies? Perhaps so, as the man before the birth of his armour constantly spread the seed of jealousy and metaphorically created a sea full of green-eyed monsters. Watching these ""demons"" taking revenge on the world around Tony and Tony himself is strangely familiar enough so to speak. There's nothing to be worried about actually as Tony always have some tricks up his sleeves.

Are you expecting S.H.I.E.L.D. to be somehow involved? Is anyone missing Director Fury? ""Nothing feels the same since (our ever order obeying Agent Coulson left us), you experience things..."" No one is trying to be nostalgic here but his part did bring some extra hint of flavour to the live action film of Marvel comic. The product of Extremis seems horrible and freaky. They're surely a little bit too overpowered and look almost impossible for Tony himself to take down all of them. Somehow, they feel too mighty to be real but Iron Man is part of Marvel and they're about superheroes and fantasy. No matter where your imagination might lead you, they're all within reason for this genre of film. So, if you like things to be more realistic, then this won't be quite your cup of tea. Twist or no twist, as the plot is building up towards the climax, it certainly leaves more to be desired.

Our man of the show, Robert's performance is sometimes over-the-top but he still stay true to what Tony is supposed to be: narcissistic, confident and on top of all, being stylish and cool. Remember what Captain Rogers said about Tony is ""all about style"" in The Avengers. He truly lives up to that.
Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall's role aren't really well developed but should be suffice for the not-so-character focus in this time around. They're convincing enough but there are rooms for improvement. So if you just want a charismatic lead actor, you have it. He's there and he's never been better.

The dialogue for most of the parts is well considered but you may find certain portion to be clichd. They're funny and possibly way too funny at times. There are some moments where you think you might actually be watching a comedy. The movie is full of action so you action junkie out there won't be disappointed. Well, even the lead actress has a few moves of her own, you should get the idea.

This theatrical cut is definitely gratifying to the eyes and the ears. Videophile & audiophile alike will be pleased. The movie almost feels three dimensional for most of the time even when you're watching it on just Digital 2D. I remember there's this scene at Tony's mansion, the front props are almost popping out of the screen which is to say, amazing. The depth and focus are excellent. The low lighting portion of the movie is surprisingly detail, defined and not too grainy at all. Choose a good seat at the cinema and get ready to be immersed into the world of Tony Stark. For audio, the surround activity is as what you'll be expecting from a superhero-action movie. The musical soundtrack is very engaging too thanks to Brian Tyler's excellent arrangement. All in all, it's a reference grade video presentation. Audio is well engineered so it's easy on the ears and they shouldn't be fatigue over time.

Okay, here's a note of warning, this is not a G-rated movie so parental guidance is highly advisable for audiences below the age of 13. The mix of action violence and some mild adult theme in it do stir things up a bit so just be aware of that. If you're anyhow in some sort of hurry, do yourself a favour and leave when the credit rolls. There isn't much uncovering in the post credit scene and its Blu-ray is going to be out soon so don't worry.

Generally speaking, Iron Man 1 and 2 were superb and this sequel is nonetheless good. So think of it as the Nolan's Batman Trilogy, Batman Begins was a stepping stone to the splendid peak of The Dark Knight then The Dark Knight Rises came and conclude the legend. Don't let the downside of this sequel mark you down. Lower your expectation and you'll have a good time enjoying this pre-Summer blockbuster of 2013. Just buckle up and be blown away by Tony's new toys! Whether or not Iron Man is making a return, the chances are, it's on us.

Cheers and go watch the movie now!!!",1366761600,12,4999,4.601571268237935

A poorly written storyline that contains the worst plot twist (Mandrian Reveal) I have ever seen in the movie. The characters are overall handled terribly to the point where the movie feels like a big joke. Speaking of jokes there are so many forced on bad jokes that get shoehorned into this movie to the point it is cringe-worthy. The final act was a big CGI catastrophe that was completely pointless and dumb (Don't even get me started on Peppers turning into the human torch like thing).

The story is good and serviceable when it come to Tony having to deal with his near death experience in the first avengers film. And by the end of the film Tony has learn that he is Iron Man even this out the suit on of not since its his mind that is his greats tool.

Even DC comics does a better job, and they mess up everything...

Maybe,""Suit of Glass""

This was one of the only Marvel films where I was slightly disappointed in the antagonist. To elaborate without spoiling anything: the antagonist's motives are confusing; he wants to do good but is willing to do very bad things that will not even bring him closer to his goal. Why do bad things if they do not lead to something greater? Even for a villain, his motives aren't clear.",1502323200,,593,4.4907407407407405

5636394,3,B00BL1BJFW,. It seemed to me that Robert Downey JR seemed uninspired. He mumbled lines and was off his sarcasm game. The best parts are him and the boy just talking to each other. The rest I can do with out. Maybe they wanted something more for gwyneth paltrow to do. Maybe they wanted to show off how much lifting she have been doing? but I didn't like this one as much as the others. Guy Pearce is good in some roles..and others not sure why they picked him. I don't think they did a great job with is role in this movie. But Ben Kingsley was fun..maybe had the best role to act in since it had more meat to chew on. Instead of fast dead lines..make something worth the actors time!  maybe slow down in parts to show some sort of reacting instead of doing a human video game? that is why you hire actors instead of digitally making them .,1499817600,,829,4.117283950617284

Based on her explained absence from the last 2 Marvel films (she and Tony aren't getting along), maybe they finally got the message.

5636452,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Yeah, Tony Stark is up to his old tricks again in this Iron Man 3 production tinkering with the far edges of technology-and off-handedly saving the world, well almost the world, the generic American president (depending on your point of view a question of some import these 21st century days). But our Tony, I don't think I have to mention that he is played by Robert Downey, Jr. not after two previous efforts as Iron Man and others as one of the Marvel Comic action hero collective), has been a little off his game since helping save the world from aliens along with his Marvel buddies. In the old days that might not have mattered but now that he living with his paramour, Pepper, who I also probably don't have to mention is played by fetching Gweneth Paltrow, his post-traumatic stress is getting in the way of their wholesome relationship. Every guy knows how that one feels, and will play out.

Of course with those personal problems weighing down on him it is an open question whether Iron Man will be able to save the world yet again. That is not a rhetorical question either because another in the long line of villains, alien (meaning from off-planet not some woe begotten refugees from the worlds incessant conflicts) or earth-bound, is raising hell, creating firestorms and all creation falling apart.  A guy who looks very much like an Osama bin Laden character who calls himself the Mandarin is talking big talk about taking the known world, the known Western world, down in flames. Along the way an old nemesis an off-beat edgy scientist named Killian is simultaneous trying woo Tony to his side and to supplant him as the king hell king of the Marvel universe.

You know the end of that story, you know old Killian will have to take the fall, have to take the big step-off on general principles that bad guys cant make the pure as gold Marvin heroes pantheon. That part is clear but kind of a side issue because this dastardly Mandarin had taken the American President prisoner in order to execute him on world-wide television (nice if evil touch). By the way the Prez was not hijacked from the White House but from a flying in the air Air Force One which should make one wonder about high level air security and what the heck the Secret Service was up to but we will let that slide for another day. What we won't let slide for another day though is that Tony, okay, okay Iron Man saves the Presidents bacon from Mandarin who just so happened to been a cover for Killian. So, yes, Killian took the big step-off from guess who, yes, Pepper. Nice work. And to make it a great success Tony had an operation on that silly pseudo-heart of his and so now he and Pepper can go under the silky sheets without worrying about him going off on some crazy tangent. Good action-packed fun-okay",1489708800,,2797,4.545634920634921

The ""Mandarin"" villian turns out to be a little bit of a lame misdirection, and then the movie is muddled by the introduction of other villians (including the Extremis process), and Tony's internal battle with himself. A single, more obvious, antagonist would have allowed the movie to focus more on Tony's internal struggles and the tumultuous relationship between him and Pepper. Overall I would rank this as the weakest of the three Iron Man movies, but pretty middle-of-the-road as far as the entire Marvel Movie Universe is concerned.

Robert Downey, Jr. nails Ironman again.  I would watch him as old retiree Ironman if it came to that.  The entire cast succeeds in this sequel.  I especially liked the touches to the Avengers film with Tony's flashbacks, with his obvious love for Pepper when he knows he's put her in jeopardy, to how he deals with Harley (Ty Simpkins) and Pepper saving Tony at the end.  The tag with Tony telling his story to Bruce Banner (who's fallen asleep) is a hoot.  Liked this one better than Ironman 2.",1474848000,,657,4.516949152542373

5636553,1,B00BL1BJFW,"As a fan of Iron Man who thought Iron Man II was less good but passable, the third installment is by far the worst and not worth renting. This movie had the star power and the cgi, but it did not have the script. The plot doesn't hold to a moments reflection, the characters behaved in inexplicable ways, and there was an entire ""bonding with child"" subplot that was offensively forced and totally unbelievable. In short, good movies make you forget you are watching fiction, but this movie was so divorced from reality that this was impossible. Not because of the suits, the tech, or any of the fantasy elements, but because no human beings or organizations (i.e. the us government, the bad guys, etc.) behave as carelessly as the people in this movie do. It's a dumb movie, which would be fine if it were fun. But it isn't. Instead of exploiting Downey's charisma and the exciting iron man suit, they somehow manage to dampen Tony Stark and make a plot point of him not using his armor. I get that they were going for a more complicated Tony and raised stakes from his lack of armor, but they failed to sell Tony's trauma and instead made a joke of it, and Tony never did feel like he was in danger anyway. In short the idea of the movie, Tony has PTSD and is forced to try to take on a new menace largely without a suit, could be a good one, but the execution was botched. The worst part is this: almost all the conflict in the movie could be resolved by Tony Stark using his Cell Phone and calling S.H.I.E.L.D. It's ridiculous that he would need to raid these super dangerous locations by himself with no armor when he could literally just call SHIELD and get them to do it. Come on. This movie insults your intelligence and ignores what you want in an Iron Man movie.",1474675200,2,1772,4.372727272727273

5636560,3,B00BL1BJFW,"The third outing for our metal-suited hero is better than the second but falls short of the first. Black & Pierces script is something of a return to form when it comes to intelligence and wit, and the humour is delivered with panache by the cast, especially Downey and Kingsley. The plot is still standard superhero fare but it is more interesting than that of the second film. Some elements, however, do not quite gel, particularly Starks sudden-onset PTSD. Its big on FX, as one would expect, and includes some impressive set pieces, although it becomes a little incoherent as it progresses and the final act is plain messy. As with the first film its the humour and Downeys easy charm that make this film worth watching, rather than the prodigious pyrotechnics. 3.5/5",1474156800,,771,4.804511278195489

It is, however, the best of the three Ironman films by far.  Now, some reviewers have expressed anger because of a plot twist about halfway through.  Why?  I thought it was pretty clever.  I fail to understand why this would be angering to anyone.  Aside from a few fanboy grumblings over some detail being different from the comic or whatever, this film is filled with heart as well as spectacle, and is a terrific culmination of the trilogy.  No denying that it is a Robert Downey, Jr. vehicle through and through, so if you're a fan, you will be in hog heaven (as they say).  Also, I didn't find the little kid annoying at all.

5636827,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Released in 2013, Iron Man 3 stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in this third installment where Shellhead takes on the so-called Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics), led by Killian (Guy Pearce). After Starks personal world is destroyed, he is left to survive by relying on his ingenuity and instincts to rise from the ashes and protect those closest to him, like Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). In the process Tony seeks to answer a question that has haunted him: Does the suit of armor make the man or does the man make the suit of armor?  Don Cheadle and Jon Favreau are on hand as James Rhodes (War Machine) and Happy Hogan respectively while Rebecca Hall plays an agent of A.I.M.

After the absolutely kinetic (and inexplicably criticized) Iron Man 2 this third part of the trilogy is a bit of a letdown. Its a quality superhero movie, but the first act is lethargic compared to the dynamic initial reel of the previous movie. Things pick up in the second act as Stark is separated from his loved ones and presumed dead, forced to team up with a brainiac kid. While some claim that the movies more serious than Iron Man 2, it has the same tone and the same main characters/cast; the amount of more seriousness is marginal.

People say Iron Man 3 plays better on repeat viewings, so Ill update this review after future viewings. But I was letdown by the lame representation of the Mandarin, the ambiguous powers of the A.I.M. operatives, the myriad Iron Man suits functioning without a person in them and the fact that everyone and their brother dons the Iron Man armor or parts of it. For instance, Pepper morphs into a veritable superheroine at one point. Nevertheless, its not bad at all and the cast is great with Rebecca Hall and Guy Pearce effective in their roles.

The movie runs 130 minutes and was shot North Carolina, Southern California and Miami.

5636832,4,B00BL1BJFW,"I watched all three Iron Man movies over the last week for the first time and I am going to roll my review for all three into one because I am lazy and I do not have a ton to say. I will start by saying that I am not really a comic book fan and I have not bothered to see most of the Marvel movies made in recent years. I have seen one of the Captain America movies and The Avengers and that is it. So I did not approach these movies as someone who already has a deep love for the Marvel universe and its mythology. I just approached these as movies. I am going to list pros and cons. My cons list will probably be longer because the things I do not like about things tend to stick out but I enjoyed all three movies. I was entertained by them which is all I was looking for.

Pros: The movies were quite funny and they had some genuinely unexpected moments. I laughed out loud a number of times in each film. The movies have a light tone and the action is mixed with some slapstick. I tend to prefer darker movies most of the time but I also sometimes crave a lighter tone and these movies fit the bill. The writing for the most part was pretty good. The writers mostly avoided cliche and they often went in a direction I was not expecting. I was actually glad that the action scenes did not overwhelm the entire movie. When I was younger I loved action scenes and I was bored by the talking scenes. Now that I am older I am the exact reverse. I start to tune out when there are really long action sequences in movies. They bore me (which is one reason I have not watched very many of the Marvel movies). The Iron Man movies had a good mix of both action and ""talking"".

Cons: I read an interview where Matt Stone and Trey Parker made fun of the character arc in Top Gun. Basically, the movie starts out with the hero thinking he is awesome, then he begins to doubt whether he is awesome, but in the end he realizes that he really is awesome. I thought it was a humorous and apt description of the character arc in Top Gun. The Iron Man movies basically have the same character arc except they leave out the part in the middle. Tony Stark never has any doubt that he is awesome. They attempted to put a character arc in the movies, especially the third where Tony starts to have panic attacks, but it is skin deep. Tony essentially remains the same fast talking, unapologetic narcissist throughout. I did not really like the character much. I could handle two hours of Tony but if I had to spend any more time with him I would want to blow my brains out. I find people who have to be clever or funny all the time unbearable.

I do not usually complain about plot holes. If a movie has emotional power or if it is entertaining then I usually do not really care if there are parts of it that are unrealistic or do not make sense. I do not watch movies in the hopes of seeing a carbon copy of reality. However, there was a plot hole in the third movie that annoyed me. SPOILER ALERT. For much of the movie Tony Stark is struggling without his suit because his house is destroyed and the suit he is wearing when he fled is in disrepair. He has a panic attack when he realizes that his suit is not charging but a little boy inspires him by telling him to make something so he does. He makes a very crude mitten with an electrical current and a few other small gadgets and uses it to infiltrate The Mandarins lair.

While he is in the lair, and shackled to a bed frame, he manages to call his suit which is miraculously fine now. The suit was broken when the writers needed it to be broken and it was fine when they needed it to rescue Tony. But that is not the worst part. Eventually that suit really is destroyed and Tony again inflitrates Aldrich Killians hideout with nothing but a T-shirt and a pistol. He again finds himself in trouble but luckily it turns out he had about 30 more suits stored deep beneath his house and he calls them all to the rescue. Why did he have a panic attack when his one suit was not charging when he knew he had about 30 more suits in his house he could call at any time? He could have called one and still left himself 29 backups but instead he decided to make a mitten with a few wires attached.

I think this plot hole points to another problem I had with the movies. Super hero movies face a challenge that non-super hero movies do not. They need a villain that is equal to the super hero. The villain needs to appear even more powerful than the super hero for at least part of the movie. Watching Iron Man foil run of the mill bank robbers for two hours would not be exciting. I was not super impressed with any of the villains in any of the movies. Ivan Vanko was my favorite and Aldrich Killian had his moments but I never really felt like Iron Man was in all that much danger, at least, when he had his suit. I think if the writers had managed to create more imposing villains they would not have needed to resort to all the tricks with Tonys suit.

They needed him to be vulnerable at times but he is essentially invulnerable when he has his suit. So they invent reasons to leave him without his suit. But then they need to get him out of trouble and no one wants to watch Tony Stark battle it out with a super villain. They want Iron Man! So they give him back his suit without worrying about continuity too much. This seemed like a flaw to me.

But I will say this for the third film: at least the rich, handsome, fast-talking, insincere womanizer eventually triumphs against the awkward, crippled, disadvantaged but sincere dork in the end. Score one for the good guys! I say that in jest but to return to the character arc. Tony claims he is a changed man at the end of the third movie. He also claims that he created his own demon by leaving Aldrich Killian alone on the roof because he was ""weird"" and off putting to all the beautiful people. But, at the end of the movie, do we really believe that Tony, if faced with the same situation again, would invite Killian in to talk instead of leaving him alone on the roof? I do not. I think he would do the same thing again. There is no believable change or growth. That was my main complaint with the movies. They were still entertaining though.",1462838400,,6237,4.175249169435216

The Mandarin thing really took a wrong turn. They were doing so well with him for the first hour and change. Gwyneth Paltrow is not doing it for me. John Favreu should be War Machine.

The problem I had with the movie was the use of Extremis which was just too unbelievable. The Warren Ellis story, was really good. But the concept doesn't translate well here and comes off as corny with Guy Pierce, who is a brilliant actor, but misdirected here.

5637045,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Surprisingly, this was my favorite of the three Iron Man films.  It has been criticized for logic holes, obvious twists and other sins, and those are fair charges.  Yet in some ways this installment brings the best of the first two films together and adds something more.

For me, this had the strongest balance of humor and seriousness.  The first film leaned a bit towards a self-serious edge, and the second felt almost like a flat out comedy with action sequences grafted in.  But here the flow all works, and the humor almost always comes out of the characters.  Also, this had by far the best action sequences of the three films.  Even knowing how things will work out, my palms were sweaty for much of the lengthy climax, and the stunts mesh seamlessly with the visual effects to put you inside the ride, instead of standing back.

Last, on a character level, theres a humanity and melancholy to this edition of the story.  Tonys enemy is ultimately as much himself - his own flaws and fears, as the outside world.  That's something hinted at in the first two films, but brought to the surface here.  Theres a desperation under Downeys still very funny shtick that gives it more layers of meaning.  Im not saying its Bergman, but this was definitely the most emotionally engaging of the films for me.

 Again, I cant fight those who point to the weak spots.  A couple of cheats had me almost groaning out loud.  But that was because I was pulled in and involved on a pretty intense level.  BTW this has by far the best after credits throw in as well.",1457136000,,1557,4.523297491039426

I had a couple of minor bones to pick *after* watching the film (e.g., HOW many suits did he have in the basement?!?), but none that took away from the enjoyment. Even the plot ""twists"" that could be seen coming from over the horizon had a few goodies that offset them well. Yes, it's a flawed movie -- but SO much fun to watch, who cares?!

SPOILER ALERT:

I'm not really a fan of having the villain being an actor. That whole story arc was a bit strange. However, it gives some incite into Tony and Pepper, and also explains why Tony does not have an Arc Reactor in his chest anymore.",1448841600,,338,4.349206349206349

5637276,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man 3 has been called the best Iron Man film in the trilogy, and it lives up to the hype, following the highly rated Avengers film. Iron Man 3 is about Tony Starks emotional journey, from womanizer to a man with morals, as he finds out who and what matters most to him in life. This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, and I couldn't take my eyes off. The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Gwenyth Paltrow is  great in this film, and it was interesting seeing their relationship evolve over the course of the movie. Also, the humor in this film was very well made, and Robert Downey Jr has perfect timing with his witty comments.
In the beginning of the film, there is a flashback to a New Years Eve party in 1999 when Tony Stark was a womanizing, egotistical entrepreneur. Tony, dressed in a white v-neck with a deep cut, black sunglasses, and intricate facial hair patterns, is clearly hunting for a love interest for the evening. His sunglasses represent how he prefers to make less eye contact with people, because he does not want to form close connections with people. At this point in his life, he is merely a rich womanizer, who only cares about himself.  Here, Stark meets with a woman named Maya Hansen, who introduces Tony to her experimental product called Extremis, which allowed people to recovery from injuries. There, Tony also runs into a disabled scientist by the name of Aldrich Killian who offers Tony a position in his new company, but Stark declines the offer by ditching Killian, leaving him humiliated. In a voice over, Tony says that this is where it all started.
 The flashback to this scene gives a preview into the emotional journey that Tony is about to embark on this film, and how his character will evolve outside of the Iron Man suit.
 Fast forward several years later, and six months after the Battle of New York, in the previous film, The Avengers; Tony is constantly getting panic attacks following his near-death experience during the alien invasion. Tony is unable to sleep, and is constantly tinkering in his lab with his suits. He is unable to sleep properly, as seen through the messed up sheets on his side of the bed. He is restless at night, and leaves Pepper to sleep on her own. When Tony does decide to sleep alongside Pepper, he faces countless panic attacks, resulting in quick camera shots of every angle of Tony, which represents how it feels like he is trapped in his panic attacks. Pepper approaches Tony of this problem, but Tony becomes defensive and claims that it is because he realizes he finally has someone he cares about, which in this case is Pepper.
 Pepper is essential to Tonys emotional journey throughout the film, because he grows as a person because of her. In the previous two films, Tony was an egotistical womanizer, who attracted women with his power and money, but now that he is moved in and living with Pepper, he feels a need to protect her at all costs. Tony believes that by perfecting his multiple Iron Man suits, he will be able to protect Pepper better, but this in reality is causing conflict between the two, and concerns Pepper. This forms a sort of love triangle between the Iron Man suits, Tony, and Pepper.
 One small detail to note about Pepper in this film is that color of her usual outfits are different. In this film, Pepper wears more white outfits, as opposed to the previous two films, where she wore more black outfits. This outfit change in the film is symbolic, because now Pepper is considered the one thing Tony cant live without, and white is usually seen as a color of peace, calmness, and comfort.
 In the film, the main conflict is between Tony and the Mandarin, who is a terrorist who is bombing and attacking places all over the world, and follows them a very cryptic video broadcasting a hate towards America. The Mandarin eventually attacks someone close to Tony, his security chief, Happy Hogan, and is severely injured in the attack. Tony then issues a televised threat to the Mandarin, giving full details on his whereabouts. This represents Tony displaying his need to protect those close to him, and doing anything to ensure their safety. The Mandarin responds by destroying Tonys home. Maya Hansen and Pepper survive the attack at the home, and Tony manages to escape in an Iron Man suit, but J.A.R.V.I.S, his artificial intelligence within the suit, routes him to the middle of nowhere in Tennessee. Once Tony lands, his suit is left broken and powerless, and Tony seeks refugee in a garage, and befriends a young boy named Harley, who lives there. Now that Tonys suit is damaged, he must figure out to defend those he loves without his precious armor. Also, with Pepper far away, and Tony being unable to protect her, he must learn how to become a hero outside of the suit. This dichotomy between Tony Stark and Iron Man is a subplot within the film, as Tony must learn how to evolve as a person without his suit.
 In the first Iron Man films, Tony relied fully on his suits to prepare him for any situation, but in The Avengers, Tonys near-death experience proved that anything can happen. Because of this, Tony realizes he needs to take situations head on, and decides to fight the Mandarin immediately.
 As Tony charges his suit, he believes he can attack the Mandarin without the help of his precious suit, and creates homemade weaponry with the help of Harley. Using this improvised weaponry, Tony traces the Mandarin to a location in Miami and attacks the Mandarins compound. Tony is able to successfully track down the Mandarin without his trusty suit, giving him the confidence to attack the Mandarin.
 Tony is eventually captured by the Mandarin, who was actually a puppet figure for Aldrich Killian all along. Here, Pepper, is injected with the Extremis drug, causing her life to be put in jeopardy. Seeing Pepper in danger, Tony manages to successfully summon his suit and escape the Mandarin. Despite seeing Pepper in danger, Tony saves a plane full of people first, allowing them to land safely. Now, Tony must go back to fight Killian without his reliable Iron Man suit, and channel his own strength to kill Killian in order to save Pepper. All of his suits are eventually destroyed in the battle, except for the defective one. Before Tony could save Pepper, a rig falls around them, and Pepper supposedly falls to her death. Using the defective suit, Tony loads Killian into it, and the suit malfunctions and self destructs, but does not completely kill Killian. In the end, it is Pepper that successfully kills Killian, using her Extremis powers. Pepper, now dressed in a black sports bra and leggings, is now able to protect herself. Pepper is unable to fend for herself behind her layers of professional blazers, pants, and dresses but once they come off, she is able to find her inner strength and protect herself and Tony. Here, Tony realizes that the people he tries so hard to protect, are able to protect themselves too. Iron Man does not always have to come in and save the day.
 In the end, Tony destroys all of his Iron Man suits, symbolizing his devotion to Pepper, and the shrapnel that operates the Iron Man arc reactor is removed from his body. Tony throws the arc reactor into the ocean, which shows how he can now be heroic even without the suit. Tony claims he is still Iron Man, but now he has the choice to be Iron Man, and not always rely on his suits to be a real hero.
 When Tony found out who and what is most important to him in life, he felt like he had everything all figured out. Now, him and Pepper can start a new life together, without the Iron Man suits constantly standing in the middle between them.",1446681600,,7692,4.62298682284041

Those that did not probably won't.....When I saw the previews, I got excited because it very briefly introduces ""The Mandarin""...In my opinion, he was Iron Man's greatest foe....So what does the director do with Iron Man's great enemy?  They play him as a complete goof, a drunken washed up actor....What in the name of all that is holy in the marvel universe were they thinking??????  They completely destroyed the image of The Mandarin and the movie itself in doing so....They did the same exact bonehead move in X-men 3 The Last Stand with the Juggernaut....Why is Stan Lee allowing this bulls*** to happen (pardon my french) Another bad move was using dozens of Iron Men (robots) flying around...When you have so many Iron Men, it takes away from the original Iron Man...It makes him no longer exclusive and special....I would have rated this and X-men 3 a big fat ""Zero""  if I could have....Save your money and your time on this pathetic attempt....A complete and utter disappointment.....Nuff Said",1445126400,2,1193,4.891089108910891

Sorry, I didn't like this one as much. It seemed to be special effects for special effects sake.

I can let reality slide and handle Jarvis, and the suit, and the flying and the lot, a single suit is pretty implausible, but too many suits in this one.. Seriously, like 30 of them flying around controlled by Jarvis. I also don't like that Rhodey kept a suit. I would want my suit back.

Also there is too much, I got this, without any proof or explanation of what happened. You are supposed to take their word for it and they left the door wide open for something at the end.

I am glad I didn't run out and buy it, either here or in a store. It was just on TV and I have watched it twice. That's enough.
I have no interest in the Avengers, Fantastic Four, Thor, Captain America or any of the other Marvel franchise movies. The previews look cheap and cheesy.

I guess i am done with the Iron Man franchise. If you buy it, don't expect a lot. You might not agree, but that's my opinion.",1444262400,,1034,4.175879396984925

5637441,5,B00BL1BJFW,"I really love this franchise, and this is my favorite film of the franchise so far.

Tony Stark/Iron Man is bombastic, three-dimensional, in-your-face, and yet endearing, because of the sheer charisma and buoyancy of Robert Downey Jr.  He turns the almost unlikable Tony Stark into an actual likable character, blessed or cursed with sardonic wit, which I absolutely relished, and an absolute inability to take nothing seriously.  He is brilliance, humor, and arrogance, but his salvation is that he is ultimately good of heart.  He cuts when and where he needs to cut.  (Another badly written script would have made Tony Stark/Iron Man falter, looking into a poor child's eyes but only Robert Downey Jr. can say the impossible with sharpness, starkness, humor, and warmth.)  Tony Stark's love for Pepper Potts humanizes him, and that is because of the equally nuanced performance of Gwyneth Paltrow.

Gwyneth Paltrow is a natural actress, who blends right into the screen.  She looks both polished and homespun; refined and humble; cold and empathetic, and she was a highlight in every film.  She has the right touch in every scene, and you get the sense that everyone who meets her either adores her or respects her, and she doesn't have to be disarming - just understanding.  And unlike other films, where I felt the obligatory love interest was just filler, or worse an obstruction, like a thin line of slime that the director unsuccessfully tried to weave in (note Jane Foster/Natalie Portman in Thor:  The Dark World), Pepper Potts enriched Tony Stark - actually humanized him.  Pepper Potts is no damsel in distress.  She does not make stupid decisions, say stupid things, and then willingly put herself in disadvantageous situations, and worst of all, cry for help.  She tries to be independent, and yet because of her significance, many see her as a target.  She is vulnerable, and that is because of Tony Stark's extremes.

What elevates this film - made it particularly enjoyable (although the first two films are also excellent) are Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley's performances.",1442448000,,2088,5.026162790697675

5637493,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Tony Stark is a character that was created to court controversy. Comic creator Stan Lee has admittedly stated that in creating Tony Stark his goal was to create an arms dealer during the Vietnam era who becomes a hero. The challenging element to this creative decision was in making him likable to a generation of youths who were against the Vietnam War. By injuring him mortally through a heart wound and making him vulnerable and then leading him to essentially don a suit of armor like a chivilaristic knight, Stan Lee was able to create a sympathetic character out of an unsympathetic situation. Throughout Mr. Stark's storied history, comic creators have added further moral conflict into his character. These additional conflicts have included alcoholism and absolute black & white decisions.

 The question posed by this unique character is what is it that makes up the worth of an individual; is it the contributions made toward the community or is it something more innate? In the film Iron Man 3, Mr. Stark struggles with the idea of is his value as Iron Man or as a person able to contribute to society with his own natural talents. This is a question that he is only able to answer when his quality of life, his technology, friends and family are taken away from him.

 This is a dilemma that many people have to face at some point in their lifetime. Generally when someone introduces themselves to a new acquaintance they state their name and their occupation. By doing this a person is prioritizing their occupation over other areas in their life. This displays a sense of identity within how a person contributes to their community whether it be local or regionally.

 This is a concept that is reinforced through our upbringing and family life. The message that some receive is that there is value not only in your occupation but that there are occupations that are better than others. This leads to behaviors geared to attain the best occupation possible to display yourself. Some of these behaviors include gearing our life to be more available for work such as where we live, what we do in our leisure time and other personal decisions.

 While there are other areas of life that suffer in importance in opposition to a person's occupation such as volunteer time, personal relationships, personal development and so on. While the potential of community impact and personal value is just as great for the other areas of life; they are put on the back burner for the professional life. This causes some individuals to become numb to a complete life and to minimize the importance of such a life. It is only when we lose what we consider to be our life that we are able to find value in the rest of our life. It is regrettable that this tends to only happen when we are forced to in order to find happiness within our lives.",1440374400,,2840,4.7002012072434605

Though when I saw it in the theater half my group hadn't seen Avengers and seemed a bit lost why he was acting so strange. If you haven't seen Avengers try and catch it before you see this.
The excessive number of suits wasn't appreciated by some of my crew as much as I liked them but that wasn't a deal breaker for me.

5637525,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man, and Iron Man 2 were both good films. They both also suffered from moments wear the writers seamed unsure as to how they wanted to move to the next scene. The fight with War Machine, for example, seemed half-hearted, and not just because Tony Stark himself didn't seem to be into it.

Iron Man 3, however, is a wholly different beast. The narration by Robert Downey Jr. helped lend it a bit of a Film Noir feel. The interaction between Tony and the little kid showcased a side of the character that we had never seen - not even in the long history in comics. Finally, the depiction of his growing anxiety problems was spot-on. For that, I speak from experience. For the first time in the entire history of Iron Man, I could relate to the character.

Gwyneth Paltrow was also a tour-de-force. Ben Kingsley played his part so convincingly I was shocked they didn't offer him any kind of award nomination. Finally, seperating the man from the suit, and having Stark realize that he was much more than his spare parts, made the film the gold standard in super-hero titles.",1439164800,,1077,4.546391752577319

The third film in Marvels debut franchise focuses on the man in Iron Man, which is in keeping with the bold decisions Marvel often makes.  Tony Starks armor is not present for much of the film, forcing the billionaire inventor to show that it is more than just a robotic suit that makes him a hero.  Giving Stark a means of summoning his armor remotely is a great idea and leads to some very inventive action sequences.

Plot holes and far reaching jokes that rarely paid off. I won't even get started on the mandarin. What a terrible moment for comic book fans everywhere.

The screenplay focused on too many things and badly on all of them.

The boy and Pepper had too much power over Iron Man, not to mention the Colonel and the
talents of Ben Kingsley were wasted on this film.

He's either Iron Man or he's not.  They turned him into a wimp for most of the movie.
They should have kept Pepper as Stark's personal secretary and him in charge of his company.

Pepper's character is offensive, acrimonious and very ungrateful -- I can't stand to watch or
listen to her.

That would have been the manful thing to do.
This movie is about Iron Man, not about Pepper, or the boy, or the colonel or whoever.
Iron Man is the hero and they flopped on that score.

A bad story equals a bad movie.

I'm about the same age a RD Jr.  I guess I'm getting too old for farfetched action driven formulaic stories w/o believable characters.  I think the reason I liked IM-1 was that, for whatever reason, I actually suspended disbelief about the sci-fi and kind of kind of accepted the Stark character.

I wanted to be amazed by this. It was the movie meant to kick off 2013 as far as summer blockbusters are concerned. For me, this movie was done in by deceptive marketing, overly used humor mechanics and poor use of supporting characters. I understand the message of this was ""Does Tony Stark make Iron Man or does Iron Man make Tony Stark"" but this could've been done better. Literally hearing a joke every 3 minutes is not needed Shane Black. Please stick to the buddy cop films you are familiar with. If you didn't read the comics there is so much here that can be missed (each suit of Tony's had special characteristics and some more important than others). Unlike Cap 2, the mystery and intrigue here with it's villain is severely lost in its plot twist and probably the thing that turns me off the most. Marvel pushing to put Iron Man's greatest villain on screen but change everything about him was not a smart decision. If you need to drastically change a lot of the qualities of a character so they fit the realm of realism then I suggest not doing it. I will say that the air force one rescue was very awesome to witness knowing too how it was filmed. I for one am having Iron Man burnout and am happy to accept him only appearing in Avengers installments moving forward. Rhodes should have been utilized more and not everyone Shane Black movie needs a Christmas back drop......

5637722,3,B00BL1BJFW,"For an ""Iron Man"" movie, especially one that came AFTER the 1st Avengers' movie, it's really ""so-so"".
Without going into details, the villains in this movie are basically as strong as the good guys; there are close calls all over the place, making it seem like ""LUCK"" was the determining factor in the end.

Minor SPOILERS below (if you'd rather avoid anything that can be considered spoilers, please do not read the rest of my review):

-the infiltration parts in the movie make it seem less like an Iron movie.
-Tony had to rely on complete strangers to accomplish some important things in this movie, which was NOT a strong point in this movie
-most (if not all) Iron Man suits in this movie simply break easy. In all previous movies with Iron Man, the armored suit could take a lot of beating & abuse and still hold, but in this movie, it just seemed like they come apart the very moment they sustain any major impact.

I just have to add that at the beginning, Tony has this new ""prototype"" that isn't even properly equipped for combat. How does that make any sense for an Iron Man suit? Also, we find out at the end that he had another 20 (give or take) armors waiting for him at his place, and yet throughout a whole 75-90% of the movie, he's relying on a suit that's partially functioning, as if that was his only option. That doesn't make any sense, to me.

It's worth watching, but not impressive.",1432944000,3,1407,4.441860465116279

I am a huge fan of all of the films in the recent Marvel tidal wave.  Out of all of them, I have to say that I really loved all of the Iron Man movies - except this one.  Iron Man is a fascinating character; he reminds me of the Marvel Universe equivalent to Bruce Wayne/Batman.  Using his intellect and seemingly limitless financial resources, he can hang with the likes of Thor, Loki, The Hulk, and a whole slew of other beings in the Marvel Universe who could easily destroy him without his suit and wit.  With that being said, Iron Man deserves enemies who are equal to him.  In the first two movies, he faced antagonists who were close intellectual equals to him, and who used their respective intellects to build suits that were similar to his own to fight him.  Not only that, but the first two movies had a different feeling to them than this third one.

There are so many things that are wrong with the third movie that I could probably spend hours writing about them, but I'll talk about a few of them that really bother me.  First, as I said, Iron Man needs a worthy adversary.  In this film, his adversary is a human being who becomes powered up and can regenerate.  Pretty cool if he were fighting someone like Wolverine.  But Iron Man needs an enemy who is cunning, witty, and, I feel, should be technology-based - like he is.  Then, if that wasn't bad enough, they took a villain like The Mandarin and made a complete mockery of him.  Not only did they make a mockery of the character, they made a mockery of the world-class actor who played him! Ben Kingsley is arguably one of the greatest actors ever, yet in this movie he plays such a ridiculous role that I just had to shake my head at it.  I guess they were trying to throw a bit of humor in the mix, but Downey's Tony Stark does it all by himself with the witty things he says.

The movie had so much promise.  Even the ending was ridiculous.  I won't spoil it here for anyone who hasn't seen it, but don't expect anything great unless you enjoy poor writing and plots loop holes that make no sense.",1432857600,,2083,4.283887468030691

But then, that has been the point of these films for years. I did not see the Hulk or Thor movies, so I cannot compare all of these Marvel films, but I recommend this film to anyone who may be worried this installment does not live up to the brand.

5637938,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Maybe I needed time to warm up to Iron Man.  Maybe I was just a grump when I saw the first one.  I don't know, but I wasn't that impressed with the original.  But that hasn't stopped me from watching the sequels.  And I have to say that Iron Man 3 is the strongest yet.

In many ways, this is more a sequel to last summer's Avengers than to Iron Man 2.  In fact, as it opens, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is working on a new Iron Man suit after having been up for 3 days straight.  If he does try to sleep, he has nightmares of what happened in New York.

But an encounter from his past is going to come back to haunt him as Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) comes back into the life of Tony's girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Killian is looking to partner with Stark Industries on a new technology that would aid in human injury recovery.

Meanwhile, a terrorist who calls himself The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is setting off bombs around the country.  He is promising something big for Christmas Day, which is only a few days away.  Can Tony pull it together to stop him?

I'm going to start in an interesting place for a superhero film - character development.  Honestly, Tony's character was my biggest issue with the first one and still a complaint with the second.  So you can imagine my surprise when I say I genuinely liked the guy here.  And I can now see the arc he's been on since the first one.  Meanwhile, Pepper Potts got some nice development as well.  The rest of the characters?  Not so much, but with those two developed I really felt like I cared about the outcome more than I have before.

Obviously, I thought the acting was great, not only from Robert Downey, Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow but the entire cast.

Of course, that's not to say that there wasn't plenty of great action.  There are several edge of your seat scenes, although the climax had a few too many cuts, so it was sometimes hard to tell exactly what was happening.  Those looking for action will be plenty thrilled.

And the special effects?  I for one believed everything I saw, which isn't too surprising these days.

The plot holds together well.  If there were plot holes, I didn't see them.  In fact, I appreciated how they set up several things they used later in the movie.  While they spent a little bit of time setting things up, I didn't feel it was too slow.  It certainly didn't drag after the first 20 minutes or so.

I don't remember the first two movies being this funny.  There were several great lines and a few scenes that really had me chuckling.  No, it's not a comedy, but the laughs were a pleasant surprise.

So I highly recommend going to see Iron Man 3.  It's got heart, action, and a sense of fun.  What else would you want from a superhero movie?",1430179200,,2765,4.352941176470588

5638109,2,B00BL1BJFW,"The story introduction.
This movie is a direct sequel to the 2nd movie. You may want to watch 1 and 2 before watching this one or you may be loss to what happened. In this movie Iron Man fights a terrorist named the mandarin, another villain from the comics. On the news Tony Stark arrogantly announces he is not afraid of terrorism and that how is how the story begins.

The good
Intricate storyline.

Robert Downy Jr. does a great iron man.
Tony Stark is still identical to his comic personnality.

The bad
The mandarin is a let down when you get to the end of movie. He was better at the beginning of the movie. Ruins the story greatly in my opinion. Had the makings of a great realistic villain at the beginning.

Iron patriot instead of the better war machine in the past movies.

Conclusion
It is a okay iron man movie. Could handle the whole mandarin villain better. It falls apart near the end.",1424822400,,902,4.377245508982036

5638125,5,B00BL1BJFW,"To add to the other 2,000 something reviews of this movie...out of all 3 Iron Man movies, this has been my favourite. I was really reluctant to watching IM3 after watching IM2.  I honestly didn't care for IM2, and after reading some other great reviews here, I decided to give it a go.

Although it's already been summed up - this takes place after the Avengers and Tony Stark is having issues coping.  Other reviews have done a wonderful job of summarising the plot.  The part I enjoyed was less action and explosions (although there are plenty still in the movie), and more 'who is Tony Stark'.

I really got a great laugh out of the end of credit clip, and after this, look forward to Iron Man 4, if they still plan to make one, and the next Avengers movie.",1424649600,,760,4.361702127659575

The story does pick up where the previous one leaves off. So I recommend 2, first if you haven't seen that one. Or even if you have. I enjoyed going back and watching 2, then watching 3.

Downey Jr.'s acting and screen presence was spectacular as expected. Ben Kinsley's character was a good twist halfway through. Guy Pierce's character was unbelievably dumb. Did he play that character to just have one under the belt - have one for the repertoire?

If you're one of the people disgusted with the portrayal of The Mandarin, too bad. I'm not a comic book purist and have the ability to judge the movie as is.

5638290,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Not the best Iron man, or even marvel movie in general. It stands very closely in my book to Hulk. They did not stay true to Tony Stark as a character or a person. I'm not complaining about the anxiety attacks, if anything i'm glad that they included them and portrayed them so well. But Tony Stark just.....losses all the things that we as a audience have come to love when we read/watch Iron man. Not to mention the Mandarin is Iron Mans biggest enemy and at first you think at least they hit the nail on the head with the villain but noooooooo, the took that hammer and smashed the audience with it in the face several times over! I did not like this movie and felt it was actually very unnecessary to the MCU.",1420329600,4,713,4.25

5638310,3,B00BL1BJFW,"I agree with a lot of the one and two star crowd in this movie's reviews. The only good parts are the first 40 minutes and the last 40 minutes. In the middle of the movie you will suddenly get that good review killing feeling called boredom. Being bored. Unimpressed. In need of more action. The action scenes to watch are at the beginning of the movie when Tony's house gets bombed by the Mandarin's ""gunships"", also called armed helicopters. Imagine 3 Army attack ""choppers"" bombing a million dollar mansion on an ocean view lot and you get the idea. Good scene. Starting at this point all the way up to the final fight this movie reminded me more of an episode of Le Femme Nikita, a super spy TV show much like the James Bond films. The armor is not even used by Tony most of the time! The second, and sadly last, scene to watch is the final 30-40 minutes which is an all out super powered streetfight! If the director and writers of this film wanted to show a hero's ""human side"", they certainly got their point across! If you ever read the comics, you know that Tony Stark was diagnosed with panic/anxiety disorder and PTSD. In this movie, the disorder starts to affect him and his ""quality control"" of his multiple suits of armor. The one REALLY sexy and cool thing about the final fight was Pepper getting involved! No spoilers but this is one hot woman(you will get the pun/joke if you watch the movie)! What's that Beatles song about ""I get by with a little help from my friends""? That was apparently the script writers' idea. EXCELLENT CGI and special effects! I loved Iron Man 1 & 2 but I cannot honestly say about this one. A good movie but not as great as other Marvel movies like The Avengers or Captain America:Winter Soldier(my favorite superhero movie EVER). Be sure to watch until the end of the final credits! Marvel has been doing these little scenes at the end of the credits and often they contain cliffhangers or hints at sequels or other things. Good but just not excellent movie.",1420070400,,2004,4.478142076502732

5638312,5,B00BL1BJFW,ok,1419984000,,2,2.0
5638313,4,B00BL1BJFW,Another great comic book movie.  I think I'm spoiled with these things.  Just sit back and not worry that something inappropriate is going to happen.  It's great family fun and what watch a movie should be like.  Non-confrontational - no blood - all the bad guys just go away and the hero wins.  Thank you!  The production values are just top notch.  You have to watch the DVD extras and learn how they did that incredible stunt where all those bodies fall out of Air Force one and Iron Man has to go save them.  I really thought it was a CG effect but apparently those are real people  --WOW... and all those graphic artists that did that work.. It is amazing.  My mouth drops at all that talent.. the only thing better of course is its lead actor!!  Of course Robert Downey Jr is just a joy to watch act.  What an actor.  I'm guessing that's who he really is because I never remember Tony Stark having this much personality.  Of course he is who he is in ever movie and its just cool.  You can't beat being RDJ!,1419984000,,1013,4.257894736842105

 This is a Monster of a Film, a Colossal Movie, a Stupendous Achievement-to use the language of movie ads of the 1950s.  Im not kidding.  This is a big, wonderful movie that works on every level.  This is the third Iron Man film and easily the best, which is almost unknown in the world of movie sequels.
 Lets start with the story and the writing.  Shane Black is the writer, a professional craftsman who has penned many big action films including Lethal Weapon 1 and 2.  Strictly as an action flick, this film is a winner and worth watching.  Our heroes are put into a series of dire situations and get out of their predicaments in exciting and interesting ways.
 Of course having familiar characters to watch is a plus, characters that we in the audience know well and are very fond of, namely Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  This gives the film a running start in the race for our hearts.  We love the troubled genius Tony Stark and his resilient girlfriend, Pepper Potts.  Paltrow and Downey wear their roles as if the characters were real people.  Also returning are Jon Favreau as Starks pal and employee and the brilliant actor, Don Cheadle as Air Force Col. Rhodes.  Cheadle may not have anything brilliant to do, he is a kind of junior hero, but it is still fun to see him.  Experienced name actors Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall play the bad guy and girl.  When the director puts great actors in even secondary roles and the writer gives them something important to do, we get an especially fine film.  Also notable is Ben Kingsley, one of the giants in modern film, as the evil mastermind, the Mandarin.  Kingsley takes the role and runs with it.
 Writer Shane Black also serves as the director, only his second directorial effort after Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.  Black neatly balances the requirements of storytelling, the characters and the narrative, and the spectacular, complicated and unrelenting special effects.  The effects are enormous, colorful and cool to watch.  But as extravagant as they are, they do not dominate the experience which often happens in films that are not so well done.  I saw the movie in 3-D, my first 3-D film since the 1950s.  I found the 3-D to be a plus but not a game changer.  It was fun to see burning pieces of material floating over the heads of folks in the first few rows of seats.
 Iron Man 3 rates a big four saw blades with an extra half saw blade for the 3-D effects for a Stupendous total of four and a half saw blades.  This will be a huge box office success and we will be watching it on TV for the rest of our lives.  It runs just over two hours and is rated a Disney standard PG-13.  This is the first absolutely must see film of the year.  See it.",1416528000,,2755,4.441117764471058

Iron Man 3 has been panned and insulted, but it's a good action film. Trolls who hate these films and can't have fun for all the flaws, don't recognize that this is IRON MAN, not The Avengers. This story shows his ability to solve a crisis on his own. The characters are fun to watch, and RDJ still ricks as the Snarky Stark. This film also gives some hints as to why his participation in the other phase 2 films was non-existent. But RDJ  IS Iron Man, and let's hope we see more of that.",1415577600,,594,4.342342342342342

Please, to the powers that be, do not ever let Shane Black anywhere near anything associated with the Marvel brand, he turned ""Iron Man 3"" into a total dogs breakfast.

About a half way through this horrible cinema experience I was thinking that possibly the only thing that may give this turkey a slight degree of redemption was if the tag scene was any good, alas that was a complete waste of time as well.

5638572,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Intense. That was the word I used to describe Iron Man 3's first trailer, and it's a description that stuck through the rest of the previews as they were released. It also aptly fit the movie itself. My poor husband was a sweetheart and let me squeeze the life out of his hand throughout the movie.

For being an intense film, there was a lot of humor neatly tucked in. It's always nice to be able to break a smile and chuckle, even if the next moment you're on the edge of your seat again.

Going into the movie I was particularly interested in Tony's character development. In Iron Man we see playboy, egotistical, billionaire start his transformation into something more. In Iron Man 2 we still have a narcissist who doesn't play well with others, but he has made improvements (after all, he is in a stable-ish relationship now). In Avengers he actually takes one for the team. I mean, the guy's come a long way! Honestly, I wasn't sure -- where do you go from here? where would they go?

The one thing that couldn't happen was for Tony to stagnate. We couldn't have the Iron Man, Iron Man 2, or the Avenger's Tony. We needed more. And we get more. Tony's still Tony - there's no question, but he certainly does not disappoint in his character development.

Another key point I was interested in was the relationship between Tony and Pepper. There's a lot in the previews to keep you wondering what happens here, and I think the scriptwriters did a pretty good job of not letting things get stale. They're in a different place in life than before, and we get to see how they react to current challenges and how that affects them as a couple. When an old wanna-be suitor and a former one-night stand show up, it's bound to effect something.

I didn't miss Rhodes in Avengers. He didn't belong, but I know a lot of people did miss him, and it was nice to see him back and him and Tony working so beautifully together, as always. One man can't go up against the Mandarin (a formidable and surprising villain) alone, and even a genius-soldier team need back-up.

Oh, for all of you who are dying to know about the special effects and explosions and what not... don't worry. There's definitely enough to go around and make you very happy. I won't say I didn't think some of it was over the top, but I didn't find it so excessive that it detracted from the rest of the movie.

I think this is the best Iron Man movie yet, but it's strength lies in the fact that its number 4 (watching Avengers before you see this film is a must). For Iron Man 3 to shine, it needs the other movies.

My review in one sentence? I'm glad we get to see less of the iron, and more of the man.",1413331200,3,2669,4.3346693386773545

Of all the Ironman movies, this one was unique in the sense that Tony Stark's personality has changed.  Also, one of the interesting aspects (spoiler alert) of the film is the anxiety and panic attacks that Tony Stark has to deal with as he saves the world.  I appreciated the personal issues that he dealt with here because they did a lot to humanize him as a character.

5638690,1,B00BL1BJFW,"Reason for the 1-Star.

-1 star, because it has a cute, precocious child helping Iron Man.

-1 star, This precocious child is actually smarter then Iron Man, is an subject from a broken home, it is Christmas and it is snowing and his father is a dead beat who ran away 15 years before (all the classic crap).

-1 star, did I mention that this child saves the day in the last 20 minutes of the movie.

-1 star because of the plot premise; an environmental wacko liberal is upset that an oil tanker spilled some crude and killed a bunch of fish and other sea creatures and nobody is punished enough, This environmental wack-job decides killing millions of Americans is more important then dead fish
.
-1 star because Robert Downey Jr has numerous crying fits and is a real wussy in this movie.

Good action movie, but it could (and should) have been done better.",1411257600,3,860,4.452229299363057

5638706,1,B00BL1BJFW,"Coming off the success of The Avengers, one was to expect that Iron Man 3 would have the biggest budget and be the best Iron Man film to date....what we got was the exact opposite.

That being said if your buying this movie for children, I imagine they would still like it. If your buying to keep up with the marvel phase two story, just rent it first.

I feel that the entire movie including script was rushed. Special effects in this movie seemed to be done either on a very low budget or by amateurs. The story could have at least been good, if it didn't go off in a weird idiotic direction. Its just not the great movie we deserved for being marvel phase two.

Not to get off topic but I waited until most of Phase Two was out to do this review,  Guardians, Thor 2, Cap 2 are all out now. I have to put Thor 2 on the same level as Iron Man 3. Now Cap 2 and Guardians are what I expect every Marvel movie to be from now on.  Both of those movies are amazing in every way and I feel they are what we all expect and deserve after a movie like The Avengers.",1411171200,,1057,3.9669811320754715

5638723,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Definitely a disappointment. None of the humor, wit, or character development of the previous two. For the first time, I have to say the screenwriter(s) on this one were to blame, as, of course, was the director. This one comes off as the inevitable money grab, at which they certainly succeeded. This one, particularly with regard to Downey's dialog and interaction with other characters, including the young boy, were just rather... ugly. I have deliberately not looked up the screenwriter(s) names for this one and the prior movies, but I'd be willing to bet that they were different for this film than the first two. I bought this movie, unfortunately, thinking it'd be at least as good as the first two. But this one is really quite a downer - especially in the dialog department.

5638727,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Sorry but I grew up collecting comic books and Iron Man was one the few which I had searched and collected ALL the issues from Iron Man number 1. The script isn't true to the comic book. There was no Jarvis computer Iron Man talked to, Tony Stark wasn't as boisterous like Robert Downy Jr. played, didn't crack jokes, wasn't a ladies man, there was no Pepper Pots the whole movie comes across cheesy and gimmicky if you read the actual comic book. If you didn't I guess you would have no expectations but even without any expectations I didn't think it was that good as a whole and doesn't come across nearly as good as action movies in the late 80''s and 90's with Arnold, Harrison Ford, etc.",1410480000,,693,4.37984496124031
5638728,3,B00BL1BJFW,"This is enjoyable 'tho ""The Mandarin"" was too much of a caricature, and I can see where some feel this is a ""jumping the shark"" moment in the Iron Man franchise.  Robert Downey Jr's swagger with one liners as Tony Stark is played out, 'tho witty and enjoyable is a rehash of the other films, so becomes more predicable, sometimes you're rolling in the isles, other times you're rolling your eyes.

I'd say overall it's worth watching, maybe not owning... unless you're a collector and completest and have Iron Man 1 and Iron Man 2, and feel a need to get Iron Man 3 otherwise feel a void in your life and that by not owning it your collection is not complete (this is actually the reason why I bought this and didn't just rent it).

It's worth about $10 or less and I think if you have patience this is the type of title, since it's not so popular that will either stay expensive (since there's not a huge sales volume) or go cheap (to product dump and make up in volume what may have been lacking in home vidoe sales).

It's not a bad movie, and compared to many others is good, but just not great and up to potential.  I'd rank the Iron Man movies as #1 being the best, followed by #2, then #3, so it's not improving but has gotten creatively worst, but at it's worst it's still better than others (like ""The Hulk"") at their best, and I'd recommend watching all 3 films still.

I'd love to see an Iron Man 4 to make up for this as the last impression of the franchise.",1410480000,5,1470,4.232142857142857

5638995,4,B00BL1BJFW,"I really liked Iron Man 3, and from all three Phase 2 Films in Marvel Cinematic that I've seen, it is definitely better then the first phase, with a lot more action, and character development. This movie also has a mixture of in-suit, and out-of-suit action in it, making it really exciting.
 Now the reason I'm giving it only four stars is because of the mild suggestive content. I don't like some of the clothes that some of the women are wearing, and Pepper does say something to Tony that isn't really okay, although it wouldn't have been so bad if they were married. Tony really seems to care for Pepper, but still they should be married, which would make it even better, because although Tony said he was in a committed relationship, it still isn't right to do that stuff unless your married. At least it could show them with a wedding ring, (but in Rio 2, it states Linda and Tulio are married, but I didn't see any ring on them [By the way, I don't have a review for that movie]).
 Overall, if Tony and Pepper were married, and subtract the bikini women, then I would definitely give it 5 stars, but overall, I still like it and am giving it a pretty descent rating of four stars.",1405900800,,1188,4.3710407239819

5639107,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Where to begin.  A genius defense contractor (Tony Stark) who doesn't have really any defensive measures for his home after making boastful statements against a super terrorist -- really?  It takes an old girlfriend looking at the news broadcast to to tell them they are about to get hit by a missile?  Hollywood writing at its best for sure. It only went downhill from there.  I really don't want to watch Tony Stark crying all the time about his issues and then teaming up with ""Murtaugh"" to play Lethal Weapon as pseudo-cops.  Lastly, in all his armored glory, he still fails and has to have his girlfriend save the day without a suit -- what? Is this Iron Man or some adaptation of My Super Ex-Girlfriend?
I wanted to see serious suit time with endless explosions and fighting -- is that too much to ask for?
I know it made inconceivable amounts of money but was a seriously weak Iron Man offering nothing of the class of the first film.
I really like Iron Man as well, which hurts.  I watched this Bluray hoping my memory from the theater was askew but I had to turn it off about 1/3 of the way in and watch re-runs of Gilligan's Island instead for a more cohesive thought provoking treatise of entertainment.

5639113,3,B00BL1BJFW,"For whatever reason, there seems to a severe and stark contrast between the their films and those from DC. Marvel movies seem to be much lighter in tone, and DC can have lighter instances, but the drama portrayed is darker yet the balance between the two are sufficient. That leads me to ask: why introduce The Mandarin, who clearly presented a real problem for Tony Spark/Iron Man in the comics due to the Ten Rings, who has a ruthless nature, as an idiot?! Borrowing from Iron Man: Extremis, the series written by Warren Ellis and drawn by Adi Granov, these issues were nothing but dark, but obviously there was not enough material for the big screen. That should not have warranted The Mandarin's portrayal being so drastically changed because it just did not work. And introducing Extremis to inflict both its maker & Pepper Potts, again, it was a stretch. Stark had to use Extremis in order to save his life after being punished by Mallen, and having altered it, in the comics, he was able to store the undersuit for his armor in the hollow of his bones, and control his armor with thought. A+ story made into a B rate movie, maybe even a grade lower. Marvel missed the mark with this one, and while you may see what it is about, it's better as a rental. This way, you will not feel gypped.

Robert Downey, Jr. is wonderful in this movie (as he was in #1, but didn't like #2 as much (Mickey Rourke turned me off - he needed a bath, a shave, a hair cut, manicure and just an over all cleaning) - I realize he was supposed to look that way, but OMG he was really repulsive).  Love the action, love the humor, love the sexual tension between Iron Man and Miss Pepper.  I absolutely love the technical sides of all these Iron Man movies.

5639135,1,B00BL1BJFW,The first time I saw this I wasn't too harsh on it but the more I thought about it the more I realize that these movies in general are just not very good. They are pretty poorly written. This is the worst one yet and we all know Marvel is gonna keep churning these out. I have nothing against RDJr. He's good in this role and without him these movies completely fall apart. I can't stand gwenyth Paltrow though so that doesn't help. They messed with the mandarin and made a movie much more geared toward kids. It's just not good.,1402272000,4,529,4.247524752475248

5639149,4,B00BL1BJFW,"I really liked Iron Man 1 and 2, so was looking forward to watching this one.  I love Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of the character and especially enjoy the humor.  This show was very entertaining.  I especially loved Ben Kingsley in it--he was hilarious and has always been one of my favorite actors.

My only reservation with ""Iron Man 3"" is the language, as it seemed to me there was a lot more swearing than in the previous two installments.  Some people aren't bothered by that, but I find it extremely offensive.  The other thing I wasn't wild about was that this film has Pepper Potts and Tony Stark living/sleeping together.  I know I'll take a lot of flak for mentioning these things and for being offended by it, but there it is.  That's the whole point of a review, right?  Hopefully my comments can help somebody else decide whether or not this movie is for them.  So, while I was entertained for the most part, this is not one I would ever buy because of the offensive stuff.  If Hollywood hadn't run Clean Flicks out of business, then this kind of stuff wouldn't even be an issue.  But, alas...",1402012800,,1108,4.485

It's not exactly going to be a classic movie, but it's a very entertaining show and consistent with the others in the franchise.  Worth a purchase in my opinion.",1401840000,,342,4.467741935483871

I did not get to see this in the theater and glad to have the 3D at home as the next best thing. Sadly it looks like this maybe the last one of the individual Iron Man movies and will have to rely on the Avengers to get my Iron Man fix.,1401580800,2,336,3.7464788732394365

5639173,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Badly in need of a spark after an underwhelming second installment, this series has swapped directors and imported a major villain from the comics for its third. Frankly, it doesn't fare any better for the effort. That's partially due to the Tony Stark character hitting a wall - his arc has been stagnant for a while now - but I found more culpability in the icy set of cold feet developed around the plot's halfway point. In the blink of an eye, the whole tone of the picture changes from a topical dash of political intrigue (and a pointed metaphor for the US's approach to terrorism) to just another struggle between Stark and the latest in a long line of bland, suit-wearing, self-enhanced business rivals with an eye on one of his inventions. That the Mandarin is downplayed doesn't necessarily bother me. Actually, I found Ben Kingsley wonderful in the role and enjoyed the sudden wheel-jerk of his change in course (those upset about his blasphemous take on a sacred character need look no further than the short follow-up film All Hail the King for vindication). But that sudden, accompanying leap from a new path to a tired, over-familiar formula is a development sour enough to curl toes. This character needed a blast of fresh air, some momentum to carry him through the next phase of Marvel's plans. Instead, he's simply planted his feet deeper in the same vat of quicksand. Despite all its intentions, it's really no better than Iron Man 2.",1401321600,,1454,4.75098814229249

5639195,3,B00BL1BJFW,"I've never been much of a fan of comic book films, although I did like the updated ""Superman"" quite a bit.  And I surely liked ""Iron Man""'; even ""Iron Man 2"" was pretty good.  But this time I will be unfortunately the one who needs to discuss the Emperor's New Clothes, at least Tony Stark's.  They seem to come on, and more importantly, off, one too many times.

From the opening scene, this film decides that it wants to be cute, and it decides that it wants to be slapstick.  While that might have worked very well when Robert Downey Jr. played ""Chaplin"" -- a film in which I believe he should have won an Academy Award, where slapstick was required due to the subject matter -- slapstick just doesn't work here.  The strong points of the previous films:  a lot of action, and a lot of situations where comedic elements fit in naturally with the dialog of the screenplay.  Here, that comedy seems forced; my eyes were rolling in many places where the jokes just didn't work.  After all, comedy is supposed to be funny, right?

And then, of course, it seems that we are required to sit through the superhero-meets-young-boy-and-young-boy-bails-out-superhero junk.  Ouch.  Perhaps this will appease the intended demographic for this film -- 12 year old boys -- but for anyone else, it might be tempting to just head for the exits long before even the final credits roll.

This is really too bad, because while I am a fan of Mr. Downey, and I am surprisingly a fan of even the Iron Man series, I am surely not a fan of this film.  It's too bad that the producers of this film didn't use the opportunity to create something truly worthy, instead of just another Superhero throwaway.  And ""Iron Man 3"" is surely just that.",1400457600,,1720,4.538961038961039

The movie is a fun super hero movie, lots of action sequences and a fairly face pace, but the villain is very disappointing and not very well developed.

5639320,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Read Amazon Queen's post from February 2014, and you'll have my sentiments about this disappointing sequel almost to a tee.

IM3 felt more like another bad Terminator sequel, with a little bit of Iron Man thrown in and, oddly enough, with Gwyneth Paltrow transforming into the T-1000 at one point.  (Yes, I'm being facetious.)

Positively disastrous choice of main villain?  Strike one.  (The phony ""Mandarin"" was downright insulting.  Speaking of which, this movie belongs in the same crapper where he made his two concubines hide in that one idiotic scene!  Yeah, it really does stink that much.)

Almost zero connection with the Avengers or the other Phase 1 MCU movies?  Strike two.  (Honestly, if you never watch IM3, you will not miss a single important piece of information regarding Tony Stark or his fellow Avengers, except for the fact that Stark suffered temporarily with PTSD following the Battle of New York from the first Avengers movie. That's seriously all you need to know about IM3!)

Vulgar language used by the ""superhero"" when conversing with a child?  Strike three.  (Terrible taste there, Marvel. Coarse language, which has no place in films marketed to kids in the first place, should come ONLY from the villains and never the heroes.  Keep the moral clarity black & white, please.)

Do yourself a favor:  Ignore this film and go see Captain America: The Winter Soldier instead so you can understand how good a comic-based movie actually can be!  (Actually, when it comes to solo films, Cap has been kicking ALL his fellow Avengers' hineys!)",1397779200,3,1565,4.980694980694981

I only hope that this is the last one they do.

5639356,4,B00BL1BJFW,"So many sequels don't come close to comparing with the original  on plot, on character development, and mostly on originality. While it's certainly no ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Iron Man 3"" offers a rollicking good time nonetheless.

For one thing, although the film is cram-packed with excellent, believable special effects and high-tech action sequences, it focuses much more on character.  The one thing the ratio of Robert Downey, Jr. to Iron Man seems much higher than in any prior Iron Man film or The Avengers  all of which this reviewer enjoyed  to the benefit of acting (and Downey) fans everywhere.  The indomitable Gwynyth Paltrow seems even more comfortable with her role as Pepper Potts then in prior films  likely also the result of a better script.  Ben Kingsley also turns in a masterful performance as an archvillain with some serious issues of his own.

The film felt satisfying as an exploration of the character and narrative twist, in which the superhero's identity is not just known, but famous common knowledge.  The story has its weaker elements  the story has some holes if you're watching carefully enough. But overall, it worked for me on a number of levels, so I really didn't care.

While the Iron Man suit clearly continues to be heavy, Iron Man 3 is lighter, funnier and every bit as entertaining as its predecessors, and maybe even more so.",1397433600,2,1362,4.899563318777292

5639360,4,B00BL1BJFW,"With all the different continuity connected franchises, weve seen Tony Stark quite a few times now. In fact, the appearances of the character are steadily inching towards the James Bond or Godzilla territory in terms of movie screen time. Iron Man 3 marks Robert Downey Jr.s fifth outing as the titular superhero, and a lot is riding on his shoulders once again. In the wake of Joss Whedons mega hit, The Avengers, this is the first of the Marvel properties to be released after their team-up. Its also a dreaded third entry in a franchise, something thats all too often proved to be inferior to the movies preceding it. Is Iron Man the hero to finally break a trend that dates all the way back to the Superman movies, or has the armored avenger overstayed his welcome?

Picking up not too long after the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark is suffering from a sort of post traumatic stress. Hes battled gods and aliens, yet the world is expected to just go back to normal. Rather than confront these bizarre new changes, hes chosen to hide away in his lab, building armor after armor. While hes occupied with his distractions, a mysterious new threat has surfaced, calling himself the Mandarin. A super terrorist hell bent on attacking America, he makes theatrical threats and uses bombs that leave no trace whatsoever. It gets personal when Tonys friend Happy Hogan (played by former director Jon Favreau) is caught up in such an explosion, forcing Iron Man to challenge the terrorist at his home. The rest of the movie centers on Tonys battles against the Mandarin as he tries to find him and put a stop to his evil schemes.

For a third installment in a franchise, a lot of credit should be given to new director and co-writer Shane Black for keeping the story interesting and fresh. The humor is sharp and plentiful, the action is great, and he takes it back to the basics of what made the first Iron Man so good, namely its protagonist. The bulk of the story centers around Tony, whos alone, battered, and without his armors. Hes forced to solve an insurmountable new problem using only his wits and his uncanny resourcefulness. Its a testament to the strengths of the character where he can still be found so engaging after so many appearances. Its not a rehash of the previous movies, and there are a lot of twists and turns (some more dramatic than others).

One of the major and welcome additions to the Iron Man series is the more memorable villains. Ben Kingsly as the Mandarin is a scene stealer and an unexpected take on the classic character. Guy Pearce is also memorable as the slimy Aldrich Killian, the head of A.I.M. who weaponized the Extremis enhancile. Speaking of which, its refreshing to see Iron Man up against super humans rather than armored knock-offs as in the previous films. It makes for different kinds of fight scenes that are interesting and new for these characters.

The movie is Tony-centric, dropping almost all references to S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers (apart from the occasional remark), wisely keeping the focus on Tony Stark himself. To emphasis this, hes often shown out of the armor  or in only a few pieces of it  during action sequences. A lot of fun is had with this, in one instance pitting Tony against thugs with only the aid of one gauntlet and boot. The same can be said for Rhodey (Don Cheadle), whos given a new paint job for his War Machine armor. They call it the Iron Patriot, but it hardly gets any use from its pilot. Instead, Rhodey gets to shine out of the armor, showing his abilities in actions scenes without it. Its in these actions scenes where even Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is given more to do, upgrading from her usual sideline position to a more central role.

Speaking of which, the action scenes are spectacular in this, highlighting just about everything that can be done with the armor. One of the most memorable is when Iron Man has to rescue a group of people falling from Air Force One. A lot of the scene was done using practical effects and real skydivers. Its quick, intense, and a gripping sequence. The finale is also incredible, matching some of The Avengers in terms of scope and superhero action.

Given all that takes place in the movie, and at a fast moving pace, certain aspects are weaker than the rest. Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen is probably the most underwhelming of the new characters, given a short arc that is resolved rather suddenly. She never feels like she played the role that the character was meant to, despite her apparent importance. This pace is also almost too fast for its own good, and the ending seems to gloss over various events that seem somewhat too important for a brief epilogue. These are relatively minor complaints, and are hardly noticeable while watching the movie.

In the end, Iron Man 3 is a fantastic and fun action adventure, topping its predecessor and reaching for the heights set by The Avengers. In many ways it succeeds, serving as an excellent starting point for the next batch of Marvel movies. It doesnt quite match the first film, but makes for a more than satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.",1397174400,7,5134,4.670353982300885

5639437,4,B00BL1BJFW,"I've read some of the other reviews and the criticisms are valid.
The sci-fi tech is pretty far fetched : An Iron Man suit that assembles itself from pieces located miles away with no detectable power source?
A party of automaton Iron Man suits that sit around unused until the very end of the story.
And then after several episodes, Tony Stark finally decides ""Hey, I think it's about time to have all the shrapnel surgically removed from my chest.""
That being said, I found the movie very entertaining, and will view it again to catch the nuances I missed the first time.
Oh, and I love the witicisms that are deftly delivered by Robert Downey Jr. I first saw him in ""Back to School"" where he stole some scenes from Rodney Dangerfield.",1395532800,,737,4.548872180451128

5639439,4,B00BL1BJFW,"The first is still my favorite.  The second and third both seemed to have less emotional and psychological involvement.  However, where the second one used wit to pad out the story, the third used character development.  I consider that a good thing because previously we really aren't quite sure who Tony is now.. Iron Man 3 shows him finding his footing and becoming more sure of his role in the changing world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  I didn't ""buy"" all of the development but there were some fairly genuine scenes.

Spoilers:
A lot of people give the film grief because of the Mandarin.  It turns out that Marvel was sympathetic to this and released a short film about Ben Kingsley's ""Mandarin"" and the genuine article.  Iron Man 3 as a film though is not about that.. it's about Extremus, which is a major part of Iron Man's history.  After all of the revisions and feedback and everything else going on with Marvel, I think the only thing about this movie that still peeves, is Pepper's action scene at the end.  I dislike when people in movies gain superhuman reflexes, strength, etc.. but they also magically learn kung fu.  If you're able to deal with that you'll probably enjoy the movie.  If you get to the end and wonder if there will be more Iron Man.. Robert Downey Jr is at the very least going to return for Avengers movies, though we don't know about future Iron Man movies.",1395446400,,1401,4.586345381526105

5639441,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron man is my least favorite Avenger. Having said that, his first movie was great. Second movie was ok. The third movie is awful. His suits that previously were indestructible are now falling apart if you sneeze on them. This is the same suit that took multiple hits from thor's hammer and remained intact. Now they're constantly malfunctioning and falling apart. He's also hardly ever in them. The Mandarin twist is horrible. Ben Kingsley was playing an excellent villian till the carpet is pulled out from underneath him. Kung Fu Paltrow at the end is one of the silliest moments I've ever seen in a movie. Brody is useless. Killian is a generic villian. Even though they mention the Avengers several times, this movies feels like it has no bearings on the rest of the MCU. I tried to find something good about this movie. I've watched it three times. I dislike it more each time. Its just a mess of a movie. People love the Iron Man charcter. I cant help but feel that skews their opinion of this garbage.

It makes no sense to me to fight interstellar bad guys, on earth no less, if the whole gang doesn't get involved! There I go getting logical, my apologies!
It is somewhat darker than the others and we have Gwyneth Paltrow sort of becoming the second member of the Fantastic Four, or err Two?! I don't know but she satisfies the necessity for a female superhero!

1st. Pepper wears the suit, I work in engineering and I tell you this suit has to be built to a metric scale of the person's body. Not to mention the president, Killian, extremis. Oh boy!

2nd. Billionaire, Playboy, philanthropist, Genius, Summa cum laude  Tony Stars is a confused nervous wreck? Cant get his suit's to work properly. Seems like Jarvis is the Brains behind Tony not the other way around.

3rd. Yes I also complain about the Mandarin, Everything was going well for this character and they released the film by butchering this character. Damn, Like Tony Starks days in the movie "" you experience things and then they're over!"" Marvel killed this movie.

4th. Killian is pissed because he was dissed years ago. What a baby! horrible back story for this character.

5th Pepper the assistant is a raging fighter, she whips Killian's A$$?

6th Stark Destroys his suit's and gets the mini arch reactor surgically removed and throws it into the ocean, this is how you close a movie.

5639534,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Try to think of a ""part 3"" movie that meets or surpasses the previous two. I can only think of a couple (Toy Story 3 and Return of the King - though even LOTR was really one big movie broken into three installments). Iron Man 3 is better than the first two. The story is tighter, the action sequences are extraordinary, but, most of all, Tony Stark is finally likable. Not just enjoyable to watch, but actually likable. We can thank The Avengers for that. Building on the Iron Man plotline and the new anxieties brought about by the events in The Avengers, Stark now has to figure out how to live in a world where there are gods and aliens, while he's just ""a man in a can."" His insecurities humanize him, while his ego remains. In this movie, the right balance for this character has finally been achieved. It's fantastic.

One of the problems inherent to Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk is that the main actor essentially disappears for the action sequences, making it less emotionally satisfying. Wisely, Iron Man 3 keeps Tony Stark unmasked for most of those scenes, letting the suits buzz around him, catching and releasing him as needed. It works very well.

This is a key moment in Marvel movie history. They've created a great foundation with (mostly) good or great movies. The Avengers film was better than I ever expected, and now they have a chance to go deeper into the characters while taking the action to new heights. If Iron Man 3 is any indication, we're in for a lot more fun.",1394323200,,1494,4.509225092250922

5639567,1,B00BL1BJFW,"So many things wrong with this movie
SPOILER ALERT
Tony Stark:  You just took on an Alien Race--carried a Nuclear Bomb through a worm-hole to another dimension and now you're having... ANXIETY ISSUES?

This movie just ""Tries"" to out-do Avengers--and ""Tries"" to keep up--and it shows.  It's just bad.  And here are just some of the reason why...

1.  So Iron Man went toe-to-toe with a couple of GODS in Avengers (Thor and Loki) and never had a serious Suit malfunction--but in this movie--Uh OH.  EVERYTHING malfunctions--at the worst of times.  Over and OVER!
2.  He has an Army of suits in the basement-that are controlled by remote-but he doesn't want to use those against a simple HELICOPTER.  That's right--a Helicopter can stop Iron Man but not an entire ALIEN ARMY!?  SO STUPID!
3.  Oh and at the end--he blows up all his suits--or they get destroyed (VERY EASILY I MUST ADD!) But NEVER ONCE did he have an ISSUE in ANY OF THE OTHER MOVIES?  (Remember all those times his suits got destroyed because Iron Man is so easily defeated...)
4. He gives out his home address on the news... (and since Pepper is the one person he cares about the most and doesn't want anything to happen to her--of course--he tells all the bad guys RIGHT WHERE TO FIND HER!)
5. The bad guy BREATHES FIRE...
6. Mandarin is an actor.
7. Tony Stark is never Iron man (because everything keeps malfunctioning--because obviously a genius can't build something that works)
8. PEPPER SAVES TONY AT THE END?  BARF!
9. Stricken with FEAR--TONY STARK-CAN't BREATHE?  BULL $#!+!  BULL $#!+ BULL $#!+
The reasons we watch and love the character is why we watch and love JAMES BOND--it's a form of escapism--not a normal piece of $#!+ YOKEL!

DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GARBAGE!

it just makes me mad that this movie is so insulting as a viewer--the director obviously thinks we are all idiots and loves to DAMAGE the source material it was based upon--I hope he never gets to direct another comic book film.

And FINALLY----IRON MAN WOULD NEVER GET SURGERY ON HIS HEART---THAT""S WHAT MAKES HIM IRON MAN!  SOOOOOOOO STUPID!",1394064000,4,2097,4.708791208791209

5639595,1,B00BL1BJFW,"Awful!

 I am a comic book collector from the first days of Marvel Comics. I have enjoyed many of the movies created from the Marvel Universe of superheroes (especially the most recent Thor movie) BUT this was an absolutely terrible film.

#1. Too much time spent on Tony Stark the man rather than Ironman the superhero. Who really cares about Tony Stark. It is his alter ego who is supposed to be the real star.

#2. The Mandarin was a real super villain in his first appearances in Ironman comics. He was Chinese. He wore rings of power and he was a deadly threat to Ironman. Here he is a joke, a British actor playing at being him with the real power being AIM.

#3. Enough with the modernizing/revising of Marvel super hero history.  I see ,as usual, that many people giving this good ratings have no clue about the history of Ironman. They are dazzled by special effects.

#4. This was long, boring, and tedious to watch.

#5. The script was awful. Way too many quips and smart ass remarks by Tony Stark and others. Why all the needless scenes that made this movie drag.

#6. Stop pandering to people who don't really appreciate what a good old fashioned super hero is supposed to be.

#7. Should have simplified the script. All the tech stuff was way too confusing. Not enough Ironman in action. Too much action by his extra Ironman suits without him in them.

#8. The script should have created a real Mandarin truer to his origins and made combat between him and Ironman the feature of epic battles. Instead we have a wimpy brainy scientist with a chip on his shoulder who also spends too much time talking and trying to make witty quips (just like Tony Stark).

#9. Great art is more characterized by what one leaves out rather than what one puts in. Here they could have edited out so much that was non essential and left in the real essence of Ironman as the star rather than Tony Stark.

#10. Jack Kirby would turn in his grave if he saw this film.  (If you don't know who Jack Kirby was, you may not realize why Marvel was so successful).

#11. I could go on but this terrible film has worn me out.",1393545600,2,2111,4.390745501285347

5639612,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Tony's legions of empty suits are a perfect metaphor for this film. Souless, gutless, and running on autopilot. Some will say that Marvel and the filmmakers took 'risks' within this film.

Allow me to tell you, they did not.

This film is very safe, very closed off and very, very stupid. Not mind bendingly stupid, as it does have some nice ideas and many funny jokes, but just plain old 'what was the point of that' stupid. They managed to turn Tony Stark into a character who is shown with having no flaws, and the ones we see in the film are either dropped or more or less fabricated for us. He's a 'jerk with a heart of gold' except the heart of gold is very forced and mostly tacked on and makes him look like a buffoon and a class clown without any of the heroics he displayed previously (aside from a few key trailer moments). And for all of their talk about the events of the Avengers film, they seem to forget what actually happened and why it mattered. And then they go and forget the effect it had on Tony about halfway through the movie.

And don't even get me started on the main villain. Actually, instead of saying what happened, as other reviews will surely detail that to you... imagine a football player about to score a touchdown. He's running down the track, no one seems to be able to catch him, and you cheer him on because WOW, is he awesome! And then someone else, some guy you never seen before but know has a really bad attitude trips our guy, steals the ball, and finishes the run. Yeah, disappointing.

All the characters have become mere extensions of Tony instead of actual characters, but they do help make up for some of the stuff Tony doesn't do, like actually fight the main villain (who I am not calling the Mandarin for various reasons). Or, you know, caring about the situation.

The special effects are pretty great, however, but are sometimes wasted, especially at the end. We get all of these cool and crazy suit designs, many of which are homages to Iron Man's other suits from the comics... and they just sort of zoom by the screen in a flash and then explode. Yeah, again, disappointing.

Perhaps the entire movie can be summed up as ""Sometimes cool, but mostly just disappointing."" It had the potential to be a very meaningful and fun movie, packed with superheroics and character development and moving things along for Stark and co... instead, it's a very stale, very 'been there' kind of movie that starts out with a bang and ends with a cheap trick and cheesy one liner. It starts out with Tony feeling like the walls are closing in and ends with him apparently giving into those walls for no reason, and then acts like that was never the problem in the first place even though it was? And that's not even counting the actual themes contained within, which are just as confused and muddled as the main villain's character and motivations. And just as half-baked.

Anyway, I'd recommend Iron Man 3 to anyone who doesn't care about the Iron Man character, his history or stories within action movies. If you just want to turn your brain off and have a few laughs and half of a very good flick, then you might get some joy out of this!",1393372800,7,3181,4.464716006884681

He couldn't even make a new suit right.  Every time it would bump into something it would fall apart.

And he was such a damn joke, his girlfriend defeated the villain.  A villain who was done completely wrong compared to the comics.

5639665,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Like so many others, I was supremely disappointed in I3. Some of the action scenes were interesting, I grant you. However, this was not the Tony Stark we came to know and love in other installments. Understandably he suffers from PTSD...but nowhere is it ever actually resolved. He has a couple fits, then it never happens again. There were so many other instances of disharmony and jarring contradictions that I could not stay ""in"" the film.

When Tony gets to Tennessee, the impression is that he is utterly alone, stranded far from home. He miraculously finds the perfect shed to dump his suit into, and meets the perfect ally in a kid who looks to be about 11. Then he suddenly has access to a car, which he hops into and drives off. Where did that come from?

In the scene where Tony is driving and he talks to the boy, it is stated that Jarvis is not all the way back to 100% and that he mixes up the last word in sentences. This happens once during the conversation to underscore the point, but doesn't happen again in the same conversation.

The Mandarin was a sloppy disappointment. Enough said there.

As someone else stated, why did Tony not have surgery in the beginning to remove the arc reactor? Suddenly this is a viable option?

A brief nod is given to the Vice-President being involved in the plot, but that's all. No explanation, or follow up.

This movie was just plain sloppy and poor. I love Tony Stark and Iron Man, but I'd think carefully about purchasing another Iron Man done by this director with this writing team.

5639707,2,B00BL1BJFW,"**SPOILERS**

This movie honestly started out as a promising one, the action was good, the plot started out decent, and the acting was almost as good as the other Iron Man movies. Then halfway through, it just kind of fell apart, Mandarin was a joke (literally a drug addict/alcoholic actor named Trevor? REALLY?!), the kid's acting progressively got worse, the plot just kind of vanished, Pepper Potts gets powers, Killian shoots fire from his mouth, hundreds of Iron Man suits flying through the air getting destroyed, no development on Rhodey, etc.

 I can't really blame the actors for what happened, but I can blame Shane Black. Shane Black is known for his  action/comedy flicks ""Lethal Weapon"", ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"", ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", etc. So there was promise when Jon Favreau stepped down as director and named Shane Black as the new director for Iron Man. Little did I know that this was a mistake, however I should've seen it coming. Admittedly Iron Man is supposed to have comedy because of Stark's snarky comments and such, but when you have to rely on fart jokes, that's pretty sad.

I can't really give it a 1 star because Downey's acting was fantastic, as usual, and the beginning half of the movie was just perfect and what I expected from the Iron Man movie. However I can't give it a 3 or 4 star either because the rest of the movie was literally just the biggest middle finger to fans of Iron Man.

I can't really recommend anyone watch this, but do as you will. I'm sad to say this movie will never grace my ""comic book movie"" shelf of my Blu-Ray library.",1392422400,3,1586,4.6063829787234045

5639713,3,B00BL1BJFW,"In this 3rd installment of the highly sucessfull Iron Man movie series, Bob Downey Jr. again returns to the lead role. Bob Downey's performance is once again engaging despite the film not measuring up to the 1st. Hollywood gets caught up in the ""reality realm"" alittle too much. These are comic book characters, with super powers...We don't need or want to see Tony Stark having panic attacks or Superman worrying about why Lois won't sleep with him for 2 & 1/2 hrs! Hollywood must remember that these characters are larger than life, and should be portrayed as such. For some reason, producers believe that the Mandarin is Iron Man's only main antagonist, which is completely false. Where's Titanium Man? Or the Crimson Dynamo? How about the Living Laser or Blizzard? Not to mention some of these characters would further along the armors that are portrayed in the films. Having Blizzard appear in a film would require Iron Man to employ an Arctic Armor would it not? Or perhaps a Space Armor to deal with the Living Lazer? The films that have already been done are more concerned with Tony & Pepper's relationship, rather than the larger than life world in which Stan Lee intended for his character to exist in. How far is Hollywood going to go before Marvel decides to pull back and ""re-boot"" another character? The next Iron Man better be more true to the comics and better have alot more Iron Man action, otherwise Marvel will probably have to ""re-boot"" Iron Man. Bob Downey Jr. better be very careful before agreeing to do any more Iron Man films. In my opinion, the 1st Iron Man(2008) & the sequel Iron Man 2(2010) are much better than Iron Man 3(2013). Highlights of the 3rd are probably seeing an actual ""Armory"" and the introduction of ""remote-controlled"" armor. Hollywood better read some Iron Man comics or watch some Iron Man cartoons before they think about making another one. It isn't Bob Downey's fault, he doesn't write the scripts or direct the film. Hollywood is to blame for this most recent film, not to mention the several other franchises that have had to be ""re-booted""..Superman, Batman, Spiderman, the Fantastic Four, Ghost Rider, the Punisher just to name a few. Iron Man could very well be next :(",1392163200,,2226,4.7844155844155845

I just kept remembering Iron Man, and Iron Man 2, as I watched this
inevitable sequel for something in the way of compelling plot or acting.

The only really ""new"" thing about this sequel (ok--""big"" plot spoiler, if such a
thing were possible) is that instead of one Iron Man suit, now there seemed
to be a couple of dozen of them, all capable of flying, like drones, without
anyone actually inside them.  Well, that plus Robert Downey has some
moments of vulnerability when he isn't inside his suit, with a kid who is a big
admirer of him as Iron Man (and who, of course, has to help him save the day).

For Iron Man 4 (no doubt there must be one) I would say start with a really good
story writer.  Make better use of Gwynneth.  Come up with some actually interesting
new plots.  Then add the eye candy as a bonus, not the main feature.",1391558400,,917,4.2057142857142855

I just found the overall ""feel"" of the story to be more ""personal"" than before, and the characters have reached into their depth to give us more of what we'd like to know.  At least I'D LIKE TO KNOW!
It's the sort of feeling I got from ""The Dark Knight Rises"".  Suspense, surprise, and the CGI to bring the comic book feel to the film.  Marvel have done a great job tying these 'franchises' together, and one can only hope it continues to get better.  Robert Downey Jr. is well suited to this role, as is Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, etc.  Let's not try to look too deeply into the story, as this is a good rendition of a comic book come to the screen.  It's fast, it's fun, it's about as tense as it can get without you saying to yourself ""Formula 22""....  One thing is for certain.  Marvel have got a sure fire formula going!

Go to marvel.com if you are not familiar with the character...the whole thing of Tony losing his nerve didn't sit well with me either.

This movie is brilliant with it's minor flaws of course. I rated it 5 stars because I'm rating the item not necessarily the movie. I love this higher quality combo pack. The movie within itself was alright, besides the giant issue I had with Mandarin. In the comic books Mandarin was flat out evil, but in the films why was he taken as a joke? Was it to lighten up the fact that the movie was ""too serious""? I on the other hand admired the emotion that was presented with Tony Stark, it was beautiful to me.

5639831,5,B00BL1BJFW,The inner geek in me will always love comic book movies so I am biased on these type of movies.  It is my opinion that even someone who is not a comic book fan will like this fast paced movie that has a good story.  Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect Tony Stark and all supporting cast work well together.  Sit back and enjoy the movie.,1390608000,,334,4.03030303030303
5639832,2,B00BL1BJFW,"First off I would like to say I am a comic book fan of all sorts and love the movies for the most part. I really enjoyed IM1 and IM2 (underrated imo). However this film really bothered me, the insult to the viewer wasn't just about the source material but the lack of seriousness they put into this made me cringe. Overall if you want an action movie with very little depth, this is for you. If you want a comic book film that isn't serious in any area, this is for you. If you want a good Iron Man film, skip this one and wait for Avengers 2 where I hope Iron Man is resurrected as a cool character again.",1390521600,7,606,4.016528925619835
5639833,5,B00BL1BJFW,My son-in-law wanted this movie for Christmas. He was so thrilled to get it & loved the movie. HE really liked that it had both types of media - blue ray & dvd.,1390521600,,160,3.878787878787879
5639834,4,B00BL1BJFW,"After a film like The Avengers it is very mind boggling to think how any film afterwards will match it. The after you see the credits scene in the Avengers your doubts are officially removed.

Iron Man 3 is the first of the second wave of Marvel films and it definitely sets a darker and more mature tone, especially for Tony Stark. The third installment is a lot more organized than the second one and the story is much easier to follow from beginning to end. Of course, it is not as good as the first one. Robert Downey Jr. however, gives a much more emotional and dramatic performance and of course the final action sequence between Iron Man, War Machine and the Mandrin is awesome. I as a comic fan of course have my gripes about the whole persona of The Mandrin, but I do have to say that Ben Kingsly is quite good at comedy. Also the ending was one that I was a little surprised about, but it definitely keeps me eager to continue watching this amazing and bold film saga unfold. Will there be an Iron Man 4? Who knows, but for now just sit back and enjoy the ride because this one is a pretty fun starter.",1390521600,,1112,4.245283018867925

5639848,3,B00BL1BJFW,"I found this movie less entertaining than the first two.  There is still some humor, but more darkness (probably intentional), and the continuing characters were less likable.  Husband wandered away while it was playing, so I gather he also did not care a lot for it.  The effects are good, and the performances believable.",1390435200,,323,4.944444444444445
5639849,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Good, funny, and entertaining movie. The comedy is sharp. I couldn't see any other actor as Iron Man - RD Jr is the character. Qwyneth Paltrow does a good job, heck all the actors are good in it. VERY entertaining and fun to watch.",1390435200,,231,4.2727272727272725
5639850,3,B00BL1BJFW,"This film falls flat when compared to its predecessors.  The plot is a little too convoluted and slapped together.  It's definitely still watchable, but probably more as an ending to a movie marathon than a stand alone.",1390435200,,219,4.891891891891892

5639866,2,B00BL1BJFW,"As for any of the Marvel movies, I will defiantly be watching them. However, that does not mean I will always enjoy them. The first thing I would say about this is the lack of action. Tony Stark is not this much of lil girl. Throughout the entire movie there was little spurts of weak action and then finally at the very end there is head spinning (not in a good way) epic action scene. There is so much going on that it was hard for my eyes to focus on anything. Hopefully, they end up making a fourth to make up for the super emotion cry baby non suit wearing Tony Stark.",1390262400,10,573,4.079646017699115

In fact, we returned it and got another copy and it STILL doesn't work in our player.  I'm not sure what the issue is as other regular DVDs work just fine.  This item does work in our older DVD player that's built in to one of our old TVs, but it's certainly NOT the TV we want to be watching this on!  Amazon's return policy is great, however, so I appreciate that.  I just wish this item would work as intended on the TV we want to watch it on!

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Probably the most powerful film for action addicts this year IRON MAN 3 blazes the screen in 3D. Robert Downey Jr. outdoes his last outing of the major action hero with his strong presence and tongue in cheek wit. Whether you are a fan of Marvel or just looking for a great adventure film, check this one out. Its the film that keeps giving with chat way after youve left the theatre, but don't give away the surprise ending and stay for a last word at the end of the credits.

In this 3rd sequel of IRON MAN we find Tony Stark has invented a new way to don his impenetrable suit of armour and a room full of new fashions. Hes on top of the world living with Pepper Potts [Gwyneth Paltrow] the love of his life in his home and new headquarters at Stark Industries. Flash back to the 1990s at a science convention and we are introduced to scientist Maya Hansen [Rebecca Hall], a previous girlfriend of Tony Starks. During an elevator ride inventor Aldrich Killian [Guy Pierce] jumps in wanting a meeting with Tony Stark to show him his new creation, but he gets sloughed off.

Flash back to today and Pepper Potts meets her romantic rival Maya and then gets led to a meeting with the now wealthy Aldrich Killian as he shows her his newest creation of developing the brain. In the meantime, an ugly Middle Eastern despot The Mandarin [Ben Kingsley] has reared up in defiance to the United States Governments killing of innocent people in his county. He has vowed to kill the president and do the country mortal harm. When Iron Man swings into action and his side kick Colonel James Rhodes [Don Cheadle] gets caught up in an insidious plan to blow up America, the fate of the world hangs in the balance.

The excitement in this film, especially in the 3D version reaches new heights, but Iron Man has scouted to the top of my list for these comic book heroes. Director Shane Black who helped write this sequel, hangs it all out with some very creative scenes showing the dismantling of Stark Enterprises seaside building, an exploding set that includes huge cargo cranes, along with several bombing locations including the Chinese Theater in Los Angeles. Tony Stark is an uncontrollable child in a toy shop busting up everything he can get his hands on.

The CGI computer graphics is outstanding, especially combined with the 3D effect. Showing Stark Enterprises coming apart floor by floor, walls against walls and cement blocks breaking apart as they tumble into the sea and thats only one dramatic scene. We are treated to several unimaginable CGI scenes as director Shane Black turns his magic on the body suits for Iron Man, a visual of the inside of the brain showing the brain synapses and the neurotransmitters and receptors in all their glory, glowing antagonists and much more. IRON MAN 3 has one of the best uses of CGI to date with not much more that can rival this Marvelous film.

Theres not much more I can say that hasn't been said already about the excellent performance of Robert Downey Jr. in this role during his four, counting the Marvel Avengers Assemble picture run and no one else will ever play the character better than he. For Robert Downey Jr. its that special look in his eyes when he sees danger and you can see his train of thought as he looks the situation over on how hes going to avoid it. Its also his quick intimidating stare followed by a witty glance and a knowing look of satisfaction that makes him the only important person in the room.

All the films cast is brilliant with character creations, adding another reason why youll be tell your friends and relations that this is a MUST see 3D Blu-ray disc. Guy Pierce is the top of his game with a character that changes over time and intimidates those who he knows are under his control. When Guy Pierce meets up with his equal however, theres always a grudge to settle. Taking on the role of the mad The Mandarin Ben Kingsley makes this character vicious at first then despicable. About to meet his maker however, hes not quite up for the fight. No one can play Pepper Potts except Gwyneth Paltrow with her sultry look, sweet as candy smile and a body to match. Im hoping Gwyneth Paltrow will be returning for Iron Man 4 and especially of course Robert Downey Jr.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The encoded stunning 1080p image with the aspect ratio 2.40:1 transfer to Blu-ray is totally excellent. Colours are properly saturated and the CGI and physical effects were perfectly blended  in fact, the bonus features reveal how much of the film was made using physical sets and effects, and especially the stunning CGI effects. Often, I use the original IRON MAN Blu-ray for demos. It's hard to imagine that could be topped, but here we are. Overall, I found this film's palette to be a bit on the dark side sometimes, but that's not a bad thing. IRON MAN 3 is still an absolute feast for the eyeballs. There are multiple superhero suits to ogle and explosions happen both in the air and on the ground, all of which look great. Even during some of the film's most chaotic moments, the detail is superb and the colours sparkle. Those close-ups on Robert Downey, Jr.'s face show off a ton of detail, including pores and facial hair, that is why this 3D Blu-ray is something that will make your jaw drop with the amazing images you will experience.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  IRON MAN 3 delivers a no-compromise 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio channel soundtrack. The film was originally mixed in Dolby Atmos for theatrical release, which is impossible to duplicate in a home theatre environment. However, the translation down to 7.1 channels for home release was done very well, capturing the spirit of the theatrical mix. The centre channel dialogue was very well-balanced against the main and surround channels. The surround channels and subwoofer are definitely active throughout the film, providing both definitive directional cues as well as excellent sonic immersion with no detectable between-channel audio dips. Also, this film also features one of the best blending of effects on Blu-ray that I have heard - just the right amount of punch when needed, without being overbearing. If you are looking for a great 3D Blu-ray Disc to show off the capabilities of your home theatre system  then IRON MAN 3 is definitely the one to consider.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Drew Pearce and Shane  Black: Director and co-writer Shane Black and co-writer Drew Pearce provide a complete and thorough rundown of all things IRON MAN 3, with a rapid-fire, dryly funny commentary that slips humour amidst its insight to engaging, eventually revealing ends. The discussion that evolves is quite fascinating too, as it avoids shot-by-shot dissections in favour of broader thematic, philosophical, narrative and cinematic lectures that shed light on a more thoughtful, textural and explorative IRON MAN 3 than any of us may have realised.

Special Feature: Deconstructing the Scene: Attack On Air Force One [1080p] [9:00] Jump into action with the stunt-team skydivers in this close-up look at creating one of the films's most memorable scenes. It's hard to believe how much of the Air Force One scene was shot practically, and this scene breakdown documentary reveals just how much time, effort and ingenuity went into making one of the film's key action sequences as effective as it is.

Special Feature: Exclusive Behind-The-Scenes Look  Marvel's Thor: The Dark World [1080p] [2:00] Experience the spectacular new worlds, unforgettable characters, and pulse-pounding thrills of the upcoming blockbuster movie. Short but sweet, this exclusive glimpse at Thor's upcoming sequel is a satisfying  albeit truncated  tease that left me begging for more. Dont hole me back!

Special Feature: Marvel's Iron Man 3 Unmasked [1080p] [11:00] Join cast and crew for a crash course in epic movie-making, Marvel style. A brisk behind-the-scenes documentary that offers a lot of great information before wrapping much too quickly. Still, it's well worth watching, and serves as a nice appetiser before digging into the disc's commentary.

Special Feature: Gag Reel [1080p] [5:00] Robert Downey Jr. gets his Tony Stark on, Gwyneth Paltrow drops a few censored F-bombs, Don Cheadle cracks up, and the rest of the cast join in the hijinks in this semi-decent outtake montage.

Deleted and Extended Scenes [1080p] [16:00] A rather lengthy laugh a minute package with cuts, extensions, improvisations, outtakes, and more traditional deleted scenes; some good, some hilarious, some wisely exorcised from the final film.

Finally, you have to hand it to Robert Downey Jr. The man owns the Marvel Cinematic Universe at this point, and it's hard to imagine it without him. Still, Tony Stark will live on being a really funny man, and if IRON MAN 3 is to go by any indication, there's plenty of room for more films, more stories, more villains, more iron-heroics and more Avengers-free missions to come. With Paramount Pictures Blu-ray release, sure steals the show here, with a perfect AV presentation born from a terrific transfer and a powerhouse 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track. Yes, the 3D experience is for my mind a terrific rollercoaster experience to make you totally drained and totally exhausted by what you view, and yes, some extra supplemental that has added even more value to the package. But with an audio commentary and one of the best I've heard in some time, two brilliant documentaries, sixteen-minutes of deleted and extended scenes, and much much more, so making IRON MAN 3 3D comes highly recommended...especially in the 3D experience, to make it THE must have to add to your Marvel Collection release. I also hope more of these 3D films get released, especially anything with Robert Downey Jr., who is IRON MAN and we can believe a man can fly and so again I am honoured to add another 3D film to my 3D Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

5639904,1,B00BL1BJFW,"The Mandarin was a serious evil character in the comics but they turned him and this film into comedy central or tried to anyway. The jokes fell flat, much like Tony Stark's house!!  The plot had so many holes they should of sold donuts instead of popcorn at the theaters it was shown at. A dozen Iron Men and one prototype couldn't take out three little helicopters!! Really!! And the Iron Patriot? That was enough to grab a puke bag in itself! Pepper should of left Tony a long time ago, running and screaming all the way out of the door. His social skills is on the level of a two year old which is pretty much the same level of audience that this film was made for. Lastly, Happy!!  Happy reminds me of one of the more infamous Star Wars characters, Jar Jar Binks. Need I say more?

The finale was pretty spectacular. Only thing is, why is Tony having a nervous breakdown over what happened in ""Avengers""? He only fought off aliens and went up into space and almost lost Pepper and almost died. In the previous Iron Man movies, he fought mechanized human monsters and almost lost Pepper and had shrapnel embedded in his chest and almost died.

Iron Man was always a favorite and I thought IM 1 & 2 were excellent.  Robert Downey owns the Tony Stark role and really makes these movies worth seeing. Like other reviewers I dislike when these contemporary films feel the need to stray from the source material.  I accepted in IM #1 that Tony revealed his identity as Iron Man contrary to the comics, but in IM #3 they've gone too far.  The Mandarin was a formidable foe now reduced to a joke.  The ending where Tony has surgery to remove the shrapnel threatening his damaged heart and with it the need for the arc reactor (which he tosses into the sea at the end) is bewildering.  Why didn't they operate before if they could?  Speaking of the arc reactor, it was the power for the suits, so how is Iron Patriot powered (Rhodes doesn't have a reactor in his chest) or all those remotely operated suits?  Not sure where they're going with this but I'm worried they'll ruin the franchise (James Bond anyone?).  Another disappointment for me was the lack of Iron Man in this film, Tony is outside the suit for much of this story.  Why these recent superhero adventures choose to have the key character moviegoers pay to see not appear on the screen is beyond me.  The last Batman movie probably the worst example of this trend; when I go to see a movie about Batman, sort of expect to see Batman on screen, not Bruce Wayne nursing a herniated disc in a dungeon for half the movie.  Oh well, RDJ makes it fun and it's visually impressive.  Hoping for more on Avengers 2.",1389744000,9,1720,4.35423197492163

5639947,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Hello all
Recently i got the first blu Ray in Marvel's Phase 2 series of movies Iron man 3. Fist off let me say this is a good movie, not great good. Fist off let me say that the extras on the disc are well worth it, the Agent Carter one shot is very well done and adds a little to what happened after captain america was frozen. The features and gag reels are well done and very enjoyable but you can definitely see why they were not included in the movie. The sneak peeks of Thor the Dark World and Iron man and Hulk is a nice add on and the overall feel of the Blu ray is well done.

The movie is good, but after a couple of viewings you can definitely see that they were trying to replicate the darkness of The dark knight Trilogy of films, that aint Iron man and while the ending and the secret ending are good and are worth the price of the Blu ray they could have done better and not try to replicate what Christopher Nolan did but instead go with the vibe of the first two films but add a little darkness to it. Still though this is a good movie and if you are a marvel fan or a fan of the avengers where this picks up from then this is definitely a movie to buy.",1389744000,,1171,3.9201680672268906

The second film was definitely a step down, but still watchable. This third installment is cringe-worthy tripe. To take an enigmatic, exciting, diabolical character from the comic books like the Mandarin and turn him into a fake character puppet portrayed by the great Ben Kingsley, well, it's beyond absurd, it's insulting. Kingsley was mis-used and frankly I'm sad to see he would accept such a pathetic role. I have adored Downey Jr. as Tony, but his arrogance and annoying attributes are wearing thin on me. But I'll continue to lobby for him so as to avoid Ben Affleck becoming the new Stark! This movie blows. What's next? Iron Man 4 where Iron Man fights the great Crimson Dynamo only to find out he is really played by Ron Jeremy, a struggling inventor? Honestly, please don't waste your time or money on this. It's garbage used to suck in $$$$ because the American public will go see ANYTHING with superheroes in it.

Unfortunately I can't fully describe that complaint without giving away a huge plot point, but I will say that the cheesiness of the Mandarin's television interruptions were never redeemed for me later in the movie, even though they were for my husband. I still found them cheesy and unbelievable, while he found them to make sense.  So, take from that what you will.

SPOILERS FOLLOW.

I found this moving to be a strange portrayal of Tony Stark.  It presents a man who once strong enough to save himself from capture and torture in the first movie to be suffering from PTSD because his house was destroyed in this one.  All of his noble qualities were discarded with the movie culminating in him destroying all of his suits and getting the reactor removed from his chest.  Why would a person so invested in is work destroy it all like that?  I found the humor to be very apologetic and weak in this movie compared to his infectious cockiness in the first two.

As the next movie to come out after Avengers, expectations were high and this movie failed to meet them in the same way that Thor The Dark World did. Stark acts as if the rest of the Marvel U doesn't exist, even as he constantly references the NY battle. Where is SHIELD when a global terror network is terrorizing major American cities? Why doesn't he call Black Widow or Hawkeye or Cap for help? If this is soon after the battle, then why isn't Banner with him during the movie?

Then there is the whole unnecessary destroying of his armors at the end of the movie, which serves no purpose seeing as how he will be suited up again in Avengers 2.

OK #2 wasn't god awful, it just didn't have anything to care about.

In #3 we've got a decent blend of internal tony issues, big terrorist issues, and iron man armor issues. The odd thing to see is how much tony's suits are failing, in the first movie alone he perfects the suit and i guess with mark 42 the idea is that he's pushing the boundaries of his skills and thus things are falling apart with his latest suit and his life. I think i just got more insightful than i care to...

We get teased along with the whole mark 42 suit because they imply there are upwards of 40 suits lying around. It's no secret due to the trailer that those suits all show up at the end to fight off the baddies. My main reservation is in just how ridiculously strong they made the extremis badguys. I'd have notched their overall abilities down a good 30 percent.

The other obvious ridiculous stupidity is that he's in the PROTOTYPE in preparation for a TERRORIST attack...meanwhile he has 40 other suits that are finished and ready and completely autonomous but for some reason he decided to keep them out of it and rely just on the one prototype.... pretty retarded for a genius.

and i guess were supposed to believe that after his house is destroyed that he couldn't call them out because the rubble was on top of the chamber. man, if they just had some weapons to blow out of that rubble... oh wait....

But honestly that gaping hole wasn't ruining of the film, but if you have a half of a brain it'll make you shake your head.

Guy pierce was awesome, loved his character. Most suprising was that they left the rest of the universe out of it, meaning no scarlet, no shield, just him.

I actually enjoyed watching Stark deal with PTSD from his mission with the Avengers. It lent a new level to Stark's personality. I also enjoyed more scenes with RDJ out of the Iron Man costume. Seeing Stark's home destroyed was not pleasurable at all, but necessary for the storyline (especially since Stark invited the attack by giving out his address). ""The Mandarin"" was hysterical. And the ending was fabulous. I don't want to give too much away for those who haven't seen the movie yet. Just be prepared for a great story and lots of great Iron Man action.

I'm tired of Iron Man fighting the same stereotypical middle aged caucasian genius antagonist who has some inner personal hatred towards Tony Stark for doing them some kind of wrong in the past. I was hoping for so much more than what we've all seen from this franchise in the past, and what we're left with is a watered down less memorable remake of the previous installment. I hate to say it, but Marvel Studios really dropped the ball hard on this one.
If you turn your brain off for about 2 hours, the action scenes aren't bad. And on a side note, does the suit become weaker the newer the model? Because by about ""mach 15"", they really start to fall apart like aluminum foil.",1388880000,3,792,4.394557823129252

If you are one of those people this movie probably won't do much for you. I just really enjoy the overall narrative that Marvel has taken for this series of movies.,1388880000,,477,4.311111111111111

This was just a bad movie. Completely different from how the trailers showed it to be (not in a good way) and I saw every twist a mile ahead. Granted I Went into this movie knowing the Mandarin twist and I hated it. What a waste of Ben Kingsley's talent! The whole movie felt like the studio thought it needed to pump out another movie and so they threw this piece of crap together. I only saw this movie once and sadly i will prob end up buying it as I did X3, so that i can have all of them. I also felt that they copied (not well) Nolan and co. approach to Batman by focusing on and also telling Bruce Wayne's story, so in IM3 they focused more on Tony Stark and less on Iron Man. Even though one in the same I want to see Iron Man in an Iron Man movie...Sadly he was missing. I don't care if the world knows Tony is Iron Man, he is not Iron Man without the suit..which he destroys. Way to go. I think just about everything about this movie made me mad. I hope this isn't a sign of the direction Marvel movies will not be taking. HISHE hit it right on the nose...this whole movie was basically the Incredibles (You're better off seeing that). Maybe this is what happens when Disney buys out other companies. So will Star Wars Episode VIII basically be Buzz Lightyear of Star Command???",1388620800,2,1334,4.19455252918288

I have found that the 3D movies have NOT caught up with the technology of the 3D hardware. I also purchased the new Star Trek movie and it did the same ""jerky motion"" thing. It was giving me a headache. However, the 3D Cirque du Soliel 3D movies work fantastic!

5640153,5,B00BL1BJFW,"There's been a lot of controversy over this movie (in a matter of accuracy to the comics). Some people weren't very fond of how they portrayed the antagonist of the movie because it was so different than how the comics depicted that character. While I definitely see what they mean (I won't go into details due to spoilers), I don't see that as something worth getting so worked up about. I was very impressed with the way this movie turned out, and it has become one of my favorite films of 2013. The writing was hilarious and has definitely become one of my favorite scripts in any Marvel movie to date. I also really liked how much Tony has matured since the first movie. He's still far from perfect but he's definitely an improvement over the mess he was in Iron Man 2. In fact, I think this movie made better use of Tony Stark than Iron Man himself! Normally I'd consider it a problem to make the secret identity a bigger role than the super hero, but in this case I consider it a positive. When it comes to story, it was also pretty good. They had some pretty interesting plot points throughout the film. This, unfortunately, is  the source of the bad too. Some of these plot points lead into those inaccuracies that I mentioned earlier (and there's a part in the final battle that I consider completely cartoonish and stupid). So basically, in movie standards, the plot is fascinating. In comic book standards, it's gonna raise some eyebrows. I'm not a particular fan of reading comic books, but I like stuff based on comics, and this happens to be one of my favorite comic book adaptions I've ever seen.

UPDATE: I just watched the movie a second time on New Year's Eve and thought it was actually better than I remembered! I think this is due to the fact that this time I was prepared for some of those things I didn't like so much (like the inaccuracies).",1388361600,4,1865,4.4662756598240465

5640170,3,B00BL1BJFW,"**MAY contains spoilers**

Im going to keep this review brief. Iron Man 3 was just ok. My biggest problem with the movie is that it is toofunny. Like, even when Tony Stark is in trouble, I don't fear for him because he jokes about everything. Sure, that humor is part of his character but I like  worrying about my heroes a little bit + seeing them get their asses handed to them a little more.

The plot, for me, was weak + loosely thrown together. Paleobotany gone wrong + a scorned fanboy coming back for revenge. Zzz. The Mandarin revelation was a huge disappointment, and goes back to the film being too light-hearted. Terrence Howard deserved to get fired from the Iron Man franchise for his foolishness + demands but Don Cheadle as War Machine, No.

The only thing I really loved about this movie was Pepper Potts becoming a bad ass H.B.I.C. That damsel in distress role gets old, + Im glad the directors thought about that.

In the end, the movie is solid but too family friendly/cheesy for me. Definitely worth a watch, though, + a good start to the Summer blockbuster season.",1388275200,,1085,4.543589743589743

5640189,4,B00BL1BJFW,"This was a worthy successor to the Iron Man and Avengers franchises, as Tony Stark deals with PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) in the wake of the battle for New York as depicted in ""The Avengers.""  He deals with his PTSD in a state of denial disguised as hard work, and that leads his already-overblown ego to deal with a near loss by means of hubris toward a terrorist named The Mandarin.  That, in turn, leads to a near-total loss of everything he holds dear and forces him into a position of...

Well, if I were to go on, it would lead to spoilers, and we wouldn't want that.  :-)

The movie is entertaining and exhilarating, but its ending seems to leave more than a few loose threads (such as not satisfactorily dealing with his initial problem of PTSD), although the tag following the credits hints that he is attempting to resolve his issues in a healthy, albeit disappointing (and humorous), manner.

The actors were good but the villain different from what I expected.  It was nice to see Pepper in such a strong role but it diverged too much the traditional character.  I enjoyed all the armor but it seemed that they weren't as tough as in previous movies.  I hold this movie on par with Iron Man 2 but still think the first is the Bert to date.,1387929600,,457,4.089887640449438

5640232,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Firstoff this movie has good action scenes and good chemistry between the main characters.

This movie gets 3 stars for me because of the royal screw up of the Mandarin! I am by no means a geek or a comic book guy, but I do know that the Mandarin is supposed to be Iron Man's greatest foe. He is supposed to have the 10 rings of power, not just 10 rings like he wears in the movie, but 10 magical rings that are the source of his power and that give him power. I'd also like to say that I did not mind the directors going with the Mandarin as a modern day terrorist who is the mastermind behind the war on terror. However, when it is revealed that the Mandarin is no more than a crazy druggie and alcoholic actor my heart sank.

Also, I question what Guy Pearce was even doing in this movie. If the director was going to make Pearce a bad guy, make him an accomplice of the Mandarin like everyone thought at the begining of the movie. Don't make him the main bad guy and criminal mastermind behind the whole plot!

Like I said, 3 stars because of the Mandarin screwup. This movie really deserves 2 stars but I don't dislike the movie enough to give it that. If you are a fan of the Iron Man movies and The Avengers than I would still recomend buying this movie despite its major flaws. I saw the movie in theaters but still bought it on DVD when it came out.",1387843200,,1358,4.1169811320754715
5640233,1,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man is a genius who created a new type of technology and is responsible for supplying the military with firepower (according to comics). This being said, the technology prowess of this film is below disappointing. In the first film you had the jericho, which blew up an entire mountain range. The technology that followed was far superior compared to some of the stuff we actually have. The preceding movie was about stolen technology, which is why it was understandable not to evolve the technology. However, this latest film is a laughable joke compared to the first two. After going through so many models, the suit attaches at command? That's it? No special bombs, no special weapons, and a code that commands all of the suits to assemble as a team to fight an army but can't seriously fight? There are so many disappointing aspects of this film that I wish I could get my time and money back from it.",1387843200,2,910,4.658385093167702

5640235,4,B00BL1BJFW,"The combination of the writing and Robert Downey, Jr. elevate this comic book stuff to another level. The most enjoyable parts of the movie are the dialog scenes, which are often quite funny and always deftly handled by Downey, Jr. Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley make great villains, and the rest of the cast is uniformly good.  And we see that Gwenyth has some serious abs. There is some very funny stuff involving henchmen towards the end, which makes them seem more human and pokes gentle fun at the whole action movie genre. The only times they lost me was during some of the big, over the top action sequences that were just too elaborate and too loud - with one exception: the astonishing free fall sequence where Iron Man must figure out how to rescue thirteen people plummeting to the ground after being sucked out of Air Force One. Be sure to catch the ""how they made the movie"" short to see how it was done. My only other quibble was that the world seems to have gone right back to business as usual after the big alien invasion of ""The Avengers"". You'd think that event would have united the planet for even a couple of years.",1387756800,,1134,4.451923076923077

I'm not one to say too much about movies because I hate spoilers.  I will say that this brings the Iron Man story to an interesting (possible) conclusion and I really enjoyed it.  I'm hard pressed to say which of the trilogy (really 4 stories) that I like the most but I think this is possibly right behind the first.  All of the RDJ Iron Man movies are awesome in their own right but this one goes more and more into the core of Tony Stark.

The film did a great job of not ignoring the Avengers and tying the two movies together. Robert Downey Jr. does a great job as Iron Man. He's funny but still cocky.

5640304,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Ok so I watched this last night and here is my take: Robert Downey Jr. is once again spot on and hilarious. Great acting on his part. I thought that the removal of Tony's chest piece was a little over the top and kind of ruined the whole series and cancelled out most of what the other two films were about. The comedy in this movie was just as good as the others and I love the fact that Tony is basically a walking train wreck. He rescues all those people from Air Force One,the music swells, he turns to fly off heroically and CRASH right into a semi and the suit flies apart! Priceless. Another thing I did not like was Pepper. She has been with Tony for how many years as an assitant so she knew full well going into a relationship what kind of a man he was and what his passions were and what drove him, not to mention his role as Iron Man and all and now she wants him to give it all up and change? How is that fair?  As he says so famousley: ""I am Iron Man"" and Pepper wants him to destroy it all? Good movie mostly.",1387065600,,1024,3.970873786407767
5640305,4,B00BL1BJFW,"The special effects are top-notch.  The acting is good but does Robert Downey, Jr. have to be so cocky?  Aside from that, a good movie.",1387065600,,135,4.36
5640306,5,B00BL1BJFW,"If you are unsure about whether or not to buy Iron Man 3, I assure you it is a worthwhile risk. I personally feel that this is the best Iron Man out of the series so far. In fact, I would say this almost beats the Avengers for me, which is no easy task. The plot is solid and keeps everything consistent from Iron Man 1 and 2. The performances are amazing, especially with Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, who would have seen someone who once play Ghandi become such a washed out druggie and be able to pull it off. The special effects are phenomenal. Buying the DVD is nowhere near being able to see it in the theater but I still love watching it at home. Support Robert Downey Jr's return to Hollywood and buy this film.",1387065600,,719,4.179856115107913

5640309,3,B00BL1BJFW,Seemed to rely on special effects at the expense of a plot. The story line was weak compared to the 1st two and the Avengers.,1387065600,,125,4.04
5640310,5,B00BL1BJFW,What can one say to give this franchise any more credit? Iron Man is a great story line.

5640329,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Robert Downey reprises his role as billionaire genius Tony Stark, aka Iron Man in this third movie.  I already own the first two Iron Man movies, so I'm probably biased, but I LOVED this one!  It's easily my favorite of the three, and it's mostly due to the somewhat expanded role for Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts.

Pepper is the gentle conscience that a perpetual frat boy like Tony needs, and she makes him a better man.  In this movie she finally shows she's got a bit of iron in her makeup, as well.

Downey and Paltrow are a delight together, and their solid characterizations are what lift Iron Man movies a notch above the rest of the genre.",1386979200,,650,4.47457627118644

5640362,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Good move and its awesome to see in 3D.

Robert Downey Jr.does it again...

5640363,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Lots of action.  Unfortunately, the story was not very believable.  It stretches the imagination that each part of the Iron Man suit would have the intelligence, jets and fuel to get to Tony Stark and then reassemble.  The suits traveling as an entire unit might be conceivable, but not piecemeal.",1386547200,,297,4.9
5640364,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Actors need work too.  That's the only reason I can find for this movie. It has a talented cast and good cinematography. Special effects are over the top as usual for today's action movies. Once in a while it would be nice to see a plot or some interesting dialogue. I'm guessing Hollywood has laid off most of the talented writers and replaced them with video game code. Such is the case with this movie and too many others lately. About the only films that have maintained any quality was the Indiana Jones series, which also deteriorated with the last one. The Matrix, while a great initial offering, soon began to smell worse with each sequel. I really enjoyed Iron Man. I liked the plot, the actors and the originality. Iron Man 2, not nearly so much. Iron Man 3, forget about it. However, it's not called show art. It's called show business and when Hollywood has a winner, the first thing they do is to wring every last dime out of it. I guess if you're Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Guy Pierce, Don Cheadle or even Ben Kingsley (How could he make Gandhi and settle for this?) , if someone waves enough money under your nose, you'd be foolish not to take it. All I can say is, please direct all that money and energy someplace else and find another subject to run into the ground. Either that, or hire a writer.",1386547200,2,1324,4.426229508196721

5640376,1,B00BL1BJFW,"This is by far the weakest of the Iron Man Trilogy. One of the main pillars of script writing is to escalate the conflict, as you build towards the climax. This movie does just the opposite. The writers of this awful script should never be allowed to work again.

Robert Downey Jr. is charismatic enough to save this film from being completely unwatchable, but you would think that as an A-lister, he would have called for a re-write of a copiously flawed script. I found myself hating this film more the more I thought about it. Furthermore, resolving a hero's tragic weakness takes away his connectivity. What's next? Batman goes to therapy and gets over the death of his parents? Superman develops an immunity to kryptonite?",1386460800,4,727,4.76984126984127

OK the origin story is normally good, and required for non-comic book people, (although not knowing someone's origins, I think can actually add to the story, but not iron Man or Spidy), so 1 was good and got you involved.

IM2 failed IMHO as the whole story was good guy/hero.robot versus bad guy/robot/hero and was just a CGI-fest with very little story.

Whereas IM3 has as story, with some very good tricks and twists (no spoilers), although the SUIT seems to have bccome it's own star. Plus with Ben kingsley we have a superb villan",1386201600,,635,4.418803418803419

Still, you can't just take an enemy who has been known to have caused the creation of Iron Man in the first place and change him into something totally different with no impact on anyone.  That's just bad writing and even worse scripting.

I do wish the movie industry would grow up and realize that what worked in the comic books so awesomely will work equally well on the silver screen now that we have CGI effects to draw on and amazing artists to put it all together.  Why change a formula that has worked so well.  It's like the absolutely stupid idea of making Galactus a cloud because you don't like the look of a robot on screen.

Don't toy with what the fans expect to see or your movie will end up like those last two lackluster Fantastic Four releases.",1386028800,,831,4.398692810457517

Why didn't he call Jarvis and have him send a suit to pick him up? Granted Jarvis was down for a bit but why not make that your main goal? Now the suits are drones and well for an Avengers 2, why will they need Tony when he can build and send a suit he drives or just let Jarvis and well send a fleet of suits.

5640426,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Third times the charm, isn't that how it goes? Except usually not, at least as far as film franchises go. Third time is usually where the gasp of creativity that breathed life into the series to begin with finally starts to run out, leaving the filmmakers with one of two possible options: either keep repeating what has worked already on larger and larger scales ad nauseum, or break the series apart and come at it from a brand new angle.

Fortunately, Black is not going to let anyone rest on their laurels. Hes given a real think at how to advance an Iron Man story beyond what has come before and the result is not only the cleverest action beats in the series to date, but the most work Downey has had to put into them. In fact, for all the many dozens of suits of armor flying around through the film and all the people wearing them (at one point it seems as if the entire cast is put into a suit at one point) Iron Man 3 actually boasts the least Iron Man of the series to date.

On the downside, along with the armor, a lot of Tonys supporting cast tends to come and go for long periods, particularly once he disappears into rural Tennessee to follow up a lead. Sure they get stuff to do  Happy follows some suspicious characters and sets the plot in motion, Rhodey once again backs Tony up during the action finish after doing little else the rest of the time, and Pepper actually gets into the action movie game for the first time, particularly during the middle segment when she briefly gets a suit of her own.

But then they disappear so that Downey can go off and trade quips with a 10 year old for 30 minutes. Which is, it must be said, far better than it sounds due to Starks inability to actually be sappy but its still hard to feel like you're being gipped somehow. After two films setting these characters up and making you care about them, they are shipped off because now no one knows what to do with them.

Those are generally small quibbles, though, as Iron Man continues to set the bar for Marvels solo superhero films through a combination of wit, charm and out and out entertainment. Its not quite as good as Iron Man 2  but then Im one of the few who thinks Iron Man 2 is the best of the series  but its not far off and certainly does no shame to the series. I don't know how many more of these they can make, but so far it doesnt look like theyve run out of steam quite yet.",1385942400,,2402,4.22004357298475

5640480,4,B00BL1BJFW,"""Iron Man 3"" picks up after 2012's ""The Avengers"", with Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) suffering panic attacks as a result of battling aliens in that movie. He copes by building more Iron Man suits and trying obsessively to perfect the Mark 42 suit, which can home in on him and attach itself to Stark in pieces wherever he may be -when it works. Pepper Potts (Gweneth Paltrow) carries on as CEO of Stark Industries, but she's annoyed and concerned by Tony's behavior. On the news, a self-proclaimed terrorist named ""The Mandarin"" takes responsibility for a string of bombings of US targets. The White House believes this is national business, not superhero business, so they call in Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) in the form of ""Iron Patriot"" to deal with it. But when Stark Industries' chief of security (John Favreau) is seriously injured in a bombing, Tony Stark vows revenge.

Shane Black has replaced John Favreau in the director's seat, and he co-wrote ""Iron Man 3"" with Drew Pearce as well. This is a stronger entry in the franchise than ""Iron Man 2"", which suffered from too many characters and subplots. Tony Stark does a lot of work without his suit this time, which allows Robert Downey, Jr. more screen time. With the franchise's characteristic humor, the film pokes fun at celebrity, actors, and technology, the very things it promotes. But ""Iron Man 3"" is more a morality play than even the first installment. And it doesn't shy away from political commentary. It's a stronger film for that, but by no means perfect. We see too many remote-controlled suits, which are not interesting and defeat the idea of a superhero. The final battle is boring. Apart than that, it's pretty good -though I kind of liked Stark better when he was a big, rich jerk.",1385596800,2,1766,4.771241830065359

5640485,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Ostensibly, this is a superlative cinematographic piece. Mr Downey Jr has made the 'Iron man' role his own. The pyrotechnics, CGI, & acting skill-set of all the principal characters are without flaw; it is the darkest offering of the trilogy, & a conscionable masterpiece in its own right. I have given it a four star rating, primarily because it does have all of the aforementioned attributes, but there is something lacking in the dynamic - the drive of the first two movies (inexorably) clearly gave licence to this last, but I would consider that 'Tony Stark's' (latter) persona might well have been ""examined"" earlier in the saga. Obviously, the darker denouement that transpires within our hero, completes his development, but the loss of so much of his arid humour (even within the adversity of the storyline) deprives the viewer of what is, ultimately, the man in the suit. Furthermore, the inclusion of the little boy's plight as a sidekick, was rather overdone - it added nothing to the plot, & merely contrived to be an unnecessary hindrance to the core theme of the whole film - it was schmaltzy, to say the least, if not sickly sweet. The format extras bouyed-up this purchase (from the USA) - the British release of the same (as is always the case), was sadly lacking in features. All this said, it was a more than adequately packaged production, but one would hope that this is the finale - a fourth movie would be a characteristic mistake (but then I am not a member of any appropriations committee from the Marvel studios). I think Iron Man would inevitably 'rust', & disintegrate.",1385510400,3,1598,4.793478260869565
5640496,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Long story short. Story terrible, events unrealistic, Iron Man suddenly feels like a cheap replica made in China, and it feels like story was changed to satisfy Pepper's desires for a bigger role, even if it didn't serve the story best. Also, and since they already brought SHIELD into the story, you see them completely missing when they're needed the most, and shall not allow what's happening. But they don't show up. Why? Because it will cost them more than $10M to bring Samuel Jackson and Scarlett Johanson.

The ending made no sense at all, and is just a lame way for them to say it's a wrap. I prefer it to be a normal ending over this.",1385510400,2,644,4.4576271186440675

The special features are wonderful (as all the Avengers movies go above and beyond in this area). For me the Agent Carter One-shot alone made this disc worth the purchase!

5640502,2,B00BL1BJFW,"The most helpful critical review is right on the money.  Nothing much to add to that except this:

Am I the only one that think the overall message of the movie is lame? Sure, Stark is very persistent and try his best to overcome his challenges but this whole Ms. Potts thing  is ridiculous. Who is Tony Stark is this movie? Some teenager having his first crush?

In the movie you will find statements like ( made by Stark or by other people but he is agreeing):

A) ""I (Stark) have nightmares and the only reason I did I not lost it is  because of you(Potts)"";
B) ""I don't deserve her"";
C) the iron man suits are a distraction"";
D) you did not like the giant bunny I gave you ? ( not asked in a ironic way, but in a very, very pathetic one by Stark);

And the movie goes on and on about this poor tormented soul that can only be a real man in the presence of the one thing he cherish the mostl : Ms. pepper pots.

Please, I am not against love message in movies, but I like empowering ones, like he is on his path and she is supportive ( or vice versa). She may even be in danger and he is willing to sacrifice everything for her, but because he is a MAN not some child/loser that can't keep it together without her.

The  movie reaches a new level of stupidity when SHE saves him and then, get this, he gives up being iron man ( well, at least this ending was in harmony with the rest of the movie: Tony is a loser and in the end reaches rock bottom all the while thinking he is doing amazing).

which, I screamed out-loud in surprise and woke up the house (I had headphones on and didn't realize how loud I yelled). RDJ owns
this role now and I rather enjoyed that the storyline kept him out of the suit for long stretches of time. The relationship between Tony
and Pepper (a beautiful and intelligent Gwenyth Paltrow) is complete now and I expect we are working towards a wedding after The
Avengers save the Universe in Avengers2. This movie was a complete surprise after the ""Good"" IM1 and the ""Pedestrian"" IM2 and I
had a great time watching it. I even rate it higher than the grandiose Avengers. This is a superhero roadtrip the likes you will never see

5640572,5,B00BL1BJFW,"This was my all time favorite movie of the year and by far my favorite Iron Man movie so far.  We have seen Tony go from playboy jerk billionaire to Super Hero Invincible Iron Man to simply being a hard working and brilliant human being in three amazing movies.  After the Avengers kicked serious super aliens out of New York City, Tony returns home to settle down with Pepper and live a nice, quiet life... until panic attacks, obsessive behaviors, and fears threaten to overwhelm him. Tony creates a plethora of Iron Man suits (all of which we get to see in the amazing final ending).  A terrorist/super villain/madman threatens the world/the US President/Tony/Iron Patriot (aka War Machine).  His best buddy Happy (remember his now obsolete 'security guard'?) nearly dies, his house is destroyed, Jarvis nearly 'dies', Tony nearly dies, Pepper nearly dies, well...you get the picture.  Tony becomes a human again.  A real human of flesh and blood.  And as he puts it in the end ""I AM IRON MAN""  A definite 5 star movie for me...  I am so shocked that the third movie was by FAR my favorite of the three!  If you were sick of Tony's self-centered egotistical womanizing and partying behaviors in the first movie, there is light at the end of the tunnel as Tony finally figures out what is really important in life.",1384819200,,1316,4.682608695652174

5640639,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Ok, I know you see two stars and you think ""he's an Iron Man hater!"" NOT TRUE!! I love love loved the Iron Man movies! the First one was hilarious, action packed, great story line, the second was as well! Avengers was my favorite, Tony Stark back with his hilariously arrogant and 'I'm invincible' attitude. The Avengers was probably the best action thriller I have seen in years (maybe even my whole life!). SO you can imagine, I was VERY excited for Iron Man 3 to come out. Until I saw it in theaters.

THE ACTION WAS GREAT. *BUT*, Tony Stark was portrayed in this movie as a post-traumatic stress victim and spends most of the movie getting beat up with his tail between his legs. This is not at all like the way I picture Tony Stark. He's supposed to be fearless, cocky, and impulsive! Then, his suits get destroyed left and right by every minor villain that comes his way. In the first movie, a fighter jet crashed into his suit and THE JET was the one that got wrecked, not the suit! In this movie, he goes through about 30 different suits, and all of them get destroyed in disappointing ways.

THE PLOT WAS QUESTIONABLE. Tony, in his stressed-out state, gets rescued multiple times by other people who have zero qualifications to rescue THE HERO OF THE MOVIE. For instance, there is an EXTREMELY cheesy part of the movie where Pepper Potts arms jumps into the air, and arms herself with part of tony's suit, then goes commando (literally, she's busting out ninja moves and fighting techniques) and single-handedly, in about 5 seconds, defeats the bad guy that HAS BEEN BEATING UP ON TONY STARK THE
E-N-T-I-R-E  MOVIE!

THE BAD GUYS WERE REALLY CHEESY. Granted that the background of the villain is pretty well thought-out, the villains being fire-breathing ""Johhny Storm"" wannabees, are extremely cheesy. They were next to invincible, while the iron man suits were getting wrecked by the dozen, by Less Than Formidable opponents.

THE MAJORITY OF THE MOVIE IS THE GOOD GUY GETTING BEAT UP, AND GOING THROUGH A CRISIS. I don't know if this has become a trend lately, but Batman followed the trend (in the last movie), so did Superman(in the new man-of-steel movie), and so did Wolverine (in his new chinese movie). All the latest/last movies in the series show the hero incapable/decrepit and getting beat up left and right by the bad guys. Don't get me wrong, but isn't it supposed to be the other way around???

All in all, I was extremely dissappointed in this movie, and personally prefer to exclude it from my DVD collection and pretend that the avengers was the last Iron Man movie. The action was great, but I wasn't a fan of the story.",1384560000,3,2649,4.625531914893617
5640640,2,B00BL1BJFW,The worst of the 3 Iron Mans.  I have been a comic collector and enjoyed the other movies developed from comics. They completely killed the character of Mandarin from what he was in the comics.  The placed more of the hero factor on Pepper.

Hard core comic book fans will probably be mad but I've never been a huge Iron man comics fan so the big reveal in the movie didn't bother me at all. Also this is probably the closest we will get to a ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" sequel.  Just a fun movie overall and Marvel made an inspiring choice with the director.",1384473600,,381,4.08
5640645,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man 3 was a step in a better direction then Iron Man 2.  Except the movie felt generic, bland, and lackluster.  The movies story was mediocre, just enough to move the movie along.  Then it felt like certain action sequences were added for the sake of action sequences.

For non comic fans the switch with the Mandarin not being a real villain, simply an actor may have been okay.  Unfortunately I know a bit about the Mandarin and he is one of the best villains for Iron Man.  Which was disappointing that he was wasted in the manner he was.

However even with the movies mishaps Robert Downey Jr. delivers another performance to life.  The movie was vastly entertaining and enjoyable.  The humor and action were placed correctly, in a way that the movie doesn't feel long.  Which make it a fun movie to go see.

When the movie is done you won't be like ""Whoa! That was amazing"" or ""Whoa! What a horrible movie.""  You'll be left somewhere in the middle, where you won't be sorry you saw it but it isn't anything to write home about either.

Iron Man 3 isn't a bad movie by any means, but I just didn't buy the anxiety-ridden superhero bit and I don't feel Downey really sold that supposed anxiety in a very convincing way.  The smart little kid out of nowhere was not believable either.  I found him more annoying than anything.  I actually watched Iron Man 3 twice just to check my first impression, but found it wanting both times.  Downey's constant snappy wit grows very thin in this movie as well.  It seemed to fit the development of the character better in the first two than in this one.  I did enjoy Ben Kingsley, though.  What a hoot.",1384387200,,855,4.388535031847134

5640714,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Superhero movies are making a HUGE comeback and have continued to rack up dollars at the box office for the past couple years.  You can thank Sam Raimi and Christopher Nolan for revamping our interest in the genre.  With `Iron Man' making a giant splash with critics and audiences in 2008, it was only a matter of time before Robert Downey Jr. became a franchise all his own (since he IS Iron Man), and now in 2013 his name is synonymous with big budget Hollywood franchises.  In fact, if Daniel Craig hadn't snagged the role back in 2006, I'm sure Robert Downey Jr. would have jumped at the chance to be a superhero, a sleuth AND a spy.

But, back to `Iron Man'.

The reviews and reception of `Iron Man 2' was dismal (and deservedly, since outside of Scarlett Johansson's hotness, the film was a mess) and so they really needed `The Avengers' to be a hit, and it was, to the point that `Iron Man 3' became one of the most anticipated films for all boys over the age of two and under the age of dead.

I'm late to this party.  I missed it while it was in the theaters and so I had to wait until Redbox would let me rent it, and even then I waited a few weeks for some reason unknown to myself.  I finally wrapped my eyes around this visual spectacle last night, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  I will say this as preface; I really, really loved the first `Iron Man'.  I hated the second one.  I found `The Avengers' to be, quite easily, the most overrated movie of 2012.  I liked it, but my god was it pimped out to be the second coming of superhero movies, and in a year where Nolan closes out the most impressive trilogy in superhero history, you have to do better than that.  It was fun, but rather messy, cluttered and underwhelming.

I know that I'm in the minority.

`Iron Man 3' takes place after the events that happened in `The Avengers', so if you haven't seen `The Avengers' you're going to be about as confused as my wife was while watching this last night and seeing Tony Stark have spastic panic attacks when someone mentions the word `alien' or `wormhole'.  So Stark is going through his thing, but the world is going through something else.  Explosions are taking lives and some creepy man of questionable (and ambiguous) ethnic decent is taking over the airwaves to make threats and take credit for destruction.  He calls himself Mandarin, and the world is in a state of panic because of him.  Stark is sidetracked, but then things get personal and Tony has to man up, grab the machine by the wires and MAKE.PEOPLE.PAY!

Shane Black does a really nice job of keeping the action the center of attention, and the action is worth noting since it is done so well.  The action starts relatively quickly, and it remains steady throughout the film's two hour, ten minute running length.  I'll be the first to point out that the final fight sequence between Stark and his real rival is WAY TOO LONG, but it's still entertaining.  These scenes are glossy and sharp and upgrade the series previous installments, showing growth and not just a lot of the same (the underwater sequence is remarkable).

Another thing that `Iron Man 3' gets very right is the balance of humor and realism.  The film has its stark dramatic core and yet Downey Jr. is so easy and effortless in his role that he exudes such natural charm and his humor is spot on.  The dialog between Stark and Hogan and Rhodes are littered with sharp jabs and a lot of fun.

And let's just say that Ben Kingsley is amazing here for SO MANY reasons.

I never followed the comics, so I can't voice in on the treatment of Mandarin, but I do understand that fans have mixed emotions about it here.  I thought it was brilliant, but that's mostly because Kingsley handles it so well.  The rest of the cast is fine, but nothing remarkable.  Hall is wasting her career, Pearce is too obvious, Cheadle has become so boring and Favreau has so little to do, but Paltrow is great and Badge Dale is effective.

It's a tad long, the last act is drug out too much and the finale feels like a `Dark Knight Rises' rip off, but the film is far more focused than `The Avengers' and Downey Jr. was really born for this (a far better fit for him than that of Sherlock Holmes), and those effects are jaw dropping.",1384300800,2,4278,4.396442185514612

SPOILER: The reveal about the ""actor"", who's portraying the Mandarin. (Ben Kingsley's a scene stealer) The action scenes are interminably long, and so over-the-top in non-stop destruction and violence , that one's reminded of the finale in MAN OF STEEL.

I specifically chose this version because it had a digital copy. I neglected to pay attention to the special features listed, which is my fault, and there are very few included. The digital copy was more important to me, though, and I was very unhappy to open the package only to learn that the digital copy included is not compatible with my device. This is definitely not my fault - there is no indicator on the package or in the item description that says this digital copy is only a streaming copy. I have an iPod Classic, which requires a download via iTunes. Though many Disney films allow a download via iTunes, this particular film does not. All of the options listed are for streaming only (Amazon Instant Video, VuDu, and GooglePlay). I checked with the digital copy provider and they confirmed that there is not an option compatible with my device.

Movie ok just by itself, but I don't know about you. But I'm tried of movies productions killing off villains and list is very long!

Could I say more. But wait there been a few villains that, with rewrite was brought out even better... Thats another story...

Still, this is Iron man don't care if its the 1st 2nd or 3rd, Robert Downey, Jr, plays Tony very good. I give cridet where credit is due! Keep up the good work.

If putting our hero in the Iron Man suit, then putting many in such a suit is better, right? WRONG! This movie's plot goes against what those of us want of our hero and substitutes sound-and-fury special effects for wit and substance. One cardinal sin of this plot is that it makes the heroine into some sort of monster and - to ""solve"" this dilemma - hero Downey says at the end, ""I took care of the problem."" THIS is WRITING a movie? Iron Man 2 was the predictable ""bigger Iron Man suit against the original Iron Man suit."" - This was poor but not too bad.

That said it is significantly better than Iron Man 2 and that's because the story is deeper and direct. There's a lot less focus on explosions and fancy effects (although there is plenty of that) and more on dialogue and character development.

One thing I like about this movie is that you get to learn more about Tony Stark, as much as I loved his arrogance in IM1, 2 at the end of Avengers he was humbled and that continues in this one. On the one hand I love the suits and the fancy technology but it's Robert Downey's sarcasm and wit that make him so great for this franchise.

Yes there is a big plot twist but it by no means ruins the movie and while I was not a fan of the ending, you can see where things are going towards Avengers 2.

It may not be for you, my only advice is to make sure you watch it again. I was angry the first time I did and thought the movie was a joke, each additional time I've watched it I take something more from it and enjoy it a little more.",1383955200,28,1134,3.9649122807017543

5640818,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Dreadful, boring movie. I almost felt bad for Downey, Jr. and Paltrow, until I remembered that they got paid a bunch of money for sleep-walking their way through this.

When you're halfway through a movie, and you realize you don't give a dang about any of the characters, you know you're watching a bad movie.

This is a truly crummy movie. Please, don't make any more like this, okay guys?",1383955200,,391,4.571428571428571

so when this came out on dvd, I pounced. I have not regretted it.

5640869,5,B00BL1BJFW,It's true Robert Downey Jr. IS IRON MAN. I thought 3 would be a dud. But not as long as Stan Lee is alive. This episode is different because it focuses on Tony Stark the man not Ironman. It was a risk that paid off.,1383782400,,215,3.8
5640870,4,B00BL1BJFW,"A sequel to both the earlier Iron Man movies and the multi-character The Avengers, Iron Man 3 finds Tony Stark suffering from panic attacks after his close brush with death during the traumatic battle of New York that took place in the latter film. Now hes up against an evil techno genius played by Guy Pearce whos created an army of exploding warriors he plans to use to take over the world.

Written by Drew Pearce and director Shane Black, the plot isn't all that compelling this time around, but as usual, it is Robert Downey, Jr. who keeps the super hero relatable and life-sized amidst the crassness of the movies multi-million dollar production values and special effects. Downeys greatest achievement is that he manages to be wisecracky and smart-alecky without becoming cynical. This is enhanced by the chemistry between him and Gwyneth Paltrow as his erstwhile ladylove and company CEO Pepper Potts.

The special effects are predictably spectacular - with a jumping-out-of-an-airplane scene an eye-popping, heart-stopping standout - but, as with the earlier films in the series, its the humanity of the title character that makes it all work.",1383782400,,1153,5.063157894736842

I don't review that often but I can now say I have seen all 3 films and Iron Man 3 was the cheesiest thing I have seen with this type of budget for a long time. I don't know if I am just old and cranky (I am 27yo guy) but I love good films. LOTR, Matrix, Bourne Identity, even The Avengers are all great movies. Iron Man 3 however misses the mark by doing things that just don't make sense.

Pros:
* Special Effects
* Robert Downy Jr's acting was solid

Cons:
* Really no back story to the villain explained in the movie despite the fact that the comics have a well articulated background.
* Iron Mans new suit is a prototype throughout the movie that constantly gets knocked off his body in every fight and can be ripped off by almost anyone.
* Bad guys in the film have abilities that change when continent to the story. (Melt your face one moment, rip an iron man's helmet off the next)

* Cheesiness example:
- Lady says ""hey look at that missile 300 Ft away flying towards your house"" which proceeds to move in Super slow motion until everyone looks at the T.V.
- Random kid happens upon Iron man in the middle of nowhere beaten and in temporary hiding and says ""everyone thought you where dead.."" and proceeds to hand Iron man a newspaper proclaiming his death that he carries around with him everywhere""
- Crazy Fire lady chases iron man with intent to kill him and gets handed a shotgun when she overpowers an idiot that walks up to her with a shotgun (Because Shotguns don't work unless you are within 1.20 feet of assailant)
- Iron Man needs to hack a satellite and so he immediately finds a news van with a tech inside who is able to ""Boost Signal Strength 40%"" by fiddling on the roof for 5 seconds.

There are SOOO many more. seriously with the money poured into this film how hard is it for the director to actually try to put a movie together that that makes slightly more sense than this.
If you are reading this and you have never seen the film rent it.",1383609600,3,1988,4.262599469496021

5640937,5,B00BL1BJFW,I think this is my favorite of the three Iron Man movies because so much of takes place without the help of his suit.  It shows that Tony is the hero and not just the suit.,1383523200,,172,3.7777777777777777

This one seems a little more on the Sci-Fi side, at least to me, but it's very good.  Always action going on or ""the calm before the storm"" brewing.  At times you feel like the situation is hopeless, but Iron Man eventually always comes out on top.  The villain's are creepy looking and have amazing powers.  Seeing all of Tony Stark's ""suits"" coming to his aid at the end was awesome!  If you're an Iron Man fan, this is a must-have.",1383523200,,543,4.173076923076923

Robert Downey has simply defined the role and his wit and faults make him an incredibly human super hero. Putting Gwyneth into the suit was first rate and she just smokes (literally).  Ben Kingsley is amazingly versatile.  Guy Pearce does a show stealing job and once again proves he is one of the most under appreciated leading actors in Hollywood.  As is true of Don Cheedle. Hey, Spiderman loses his abilities.  Batman screws up.  Even Superman loses his powers once in a while...I think the ending is a bit overdone.  The cool thing about Ironman is that HE's IN THE SUIT, not operating a gameboy...  Oh well, can't have it all.  Great pace, dialogue and special effects.

5640984,3,B00BL1BJFW,"This becomes more of a movie review than a product review but I wasn't in love with the 3rd installment of Iron Man but I do love the series.  So being the completest, I had to have this one.  I would say this movie pales to the first movie, and is very comparable to the second for me.  I would say that this movie had much more comic relief, but overall story was a bit underwhelming.  I'm fearful that this is the trend that Disney will be going with allowing major movie lines to fade away but we shall see.  You know that they will ride out the Iron Man love for years to come.  Robert Downey Jr. carries the story, and without him the movie line would fail.",1383436800,,663,4.10077519379845
5640995,1,B00BL1BJFW,"(In re-reading my review I realize it is a bit spoilery and ranty, so be forewarned)

I'm afraid this is an example of a great group of very talented people getting together and making a movie that I absolutely DID NOT want to see made.
The trailer was like seeing a beautiful, perfect apple. Then the movie was like taking a bite of the apple and finding out it is just sawdust covered in wax.

I imagine this would be my conversation with the writers/director/whoever:
Wouldn't it be great to see Tony Stark suffering serious post-traumatic stress?
My answer is No.

How about seeing a constantly malfunctioning prototype Iron Man armor?
Nope. That would be a terrible idea.

Well, we can have Col. James Rhodes as Iron-War-Patriot-Machine, who gets to do next to nothing.
NO, I tells ya!

Did I mention that Iron Man's armor constantly falls apart?
You have not mentioned that yet, but I NEVER want to see that happen in any Iron Man movie.

Um, alright, we'll have The Mandarin in the movie (Great!), he'll be played by Ben Kingsley (Excellent!), he will be of indeterminate nationality (I like it!) BUT . . . it turns out it is a cheap and embarrassing trick where he ends up being just a goofball actor (wrong, wrong and WRONG! Horrible idea!).

OK, OK. Well, we'll use the Extremis Virus (that could work) to make people into super-heated, fire-breathing, exploding beasties that can tear Iron Man's 42 different types of armor (wait, what?) into pieces (NO!)

Tony will run around wearing just PARTS of his armor, stumbling and bumbling his way around until flaming Pepper (whazza!?) rises from the fire to save him! (Now you've completely lost me. And I am a lifelong fan of comics and superheroes.)

Then I would say, ""Well, thank heaven we had this conversation and I stopped Marvel from making a mind-bendingly horrible Iron Man movie."" Wait a minute. They MADE that movie?!! It earned over 1 billion bucks?! But its horrible! Its idiotic! Its . . . And then my nose starts bleeding again and I have to just give up.

Anyway, thanks for allowing that rant. I did think this film was just FULL of terrible ideas that ruined it for me. However, the scene where Iron Man saves the people falling from Air Force One is excellent. I loved the special feature about the sky-divers that pulled it off. Those people were absolutely awesome. (Then the director blew it in the movie by having Tony NOT be in the armor and then having him crash it like an idiot into an oncoming truck where his armor (of course) FALLS APART!

On a positive note, the Agent Carter short-film was PERFECT. WAY better than IM3. And the kid who works with Tony is NOT annoying and gives a really good performance.

You know, I loved the trailer for Iron Man 3, then I felt completely cheated by the movie. I also LOVE the trailers for Thor 2 and Captain America 2. I pray I don't get cheated on THOSE two. In fact, I feel all panicky, like the trauma of having seen Iron Man 3 has made me incapable of going to anymore Marvel movies. What will happen next?!",1383436800,37,3038,4.543956043956044

5641026,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Everything you wanted was there in the movie but it never came together. It seemed like Tony Stark just randomly delivered his intoxicated dialogue throughout the entire story. The other movies seemed to have Tony with a sort of sarcastic quirky charm but this one seemed like his personality was forced on you. Why am I complaining about that? Well, it makes the movie feel like a movie instead of having a character naturally blend in with the story, it feels like you're just hearing lines you know were meant to get a reaction from the audience. This film plays more on comedy than wit and it gives off a cartoonish vibe. What I never get about any of these Marvel Superhero movies is that they always turn into some lighthearted comedic action movie. When in the comics the characters are pretty complex,serious,and deep. This is more like the Saturday Morning Ironman than the comic book iron man but so be it. What's surprising about the film is that it's light hearted but Tony Starks shoots people with guns and kills them in the film? Why? Iron Man doesn't go around killing people he's not the Punisher. That stuff aside the overall Villain in this movie is typical and that's boring. Ironman 2 YES! That was fun. Iron Man 1 I forgot who he was ever fighting but it didn't matter because it was all about IRON MAN. In Iron Man 3 it's like it has Trilogy Syndrome. It's time for the hero to hang his cape up and go on enjoying his life. Lets not forget that danger still exists and there will always be a need for a superhero or that Tony Starks might need his little inventions again for another threat in the future. It's just the standard cliche super hero Trilogy ending. With Iron Man it leaves on sort of a sad note because I don't think Iron man ever had a true Villain worthy of him fighting at least not depicted properly. The Mandarin is probably one of the bigger let downs of the film. Hopefully the Avengers movie will make up for Iron Man always having such week villains in a universe full of Supervillians from Dr. Doom to Madame Masque that have better movie worthy story lines. This 3rd installment definitely felt like it was just put together to finish the series off with little thought into the plot outside of as much action as possible. Was it a movie worth seeing? Sure it's a good action fix if you need it but it's not better than the first 2 it's actually a weak follow up that leaves you looking for something better. Hopefully we'll get that in Avengers 2.",1383350400,4,2496,4.463894967177243

What can I say Iron Man 3 is the best in the series so far.

I'm not a comic book fan, until the Avengers I just watched Iron Man because I went to the movies with the male members of the family but after the Avengers I went back and watched all the movies starting with Captain America, just to see how the whole thing comes together. I have to say each one of the movies can stand on their own but together they are box office gold.

5641064,4,B00BL1BJFW,"A lot of people were turned off by the second Iron Man movie, rightfully so.  Too much studio involvement, a silly villain, Mickey Rourke at his most over-the-top... all valid criticisms.

This movie grounds it all again and starts fresh.  A seriously distraught Tony Stark has withdrawn from the world following his experiences in the Avengers movie, but of course the world won't leave him alone.  With an okay villain but lots of great action, this movie really shines.  For fans of the Mandarin from the comicbooks, yes you might not like what's done to the character in this movie.  But it makes sense in the bigger picture of the story and we get a very entertaining and weird performance from Ben Kingsley out of it.

As critics have mentioned, though, the best part of the movie is when Tony doesn't have his armor on.  Then we get to see RDJr shine as the smarta$$ he does so well.  Tony Stark is much more interesting than Iron Man, and this movie allows him to take center stage.

The ending is probably a little too ""Hollywood"" for my tastes, but it's fun, and I smiled for quite a while after the movie.  Very enjoyable!",1383177600,,1133,4.532019704433497

In the big final action set piece, Iron Man's suit keeps coming on and off without any clear reason -- what's the good of being Ironman if you can't use the suit?  And finally, Stark's wife falls into an intense fire, presumably dying, but reappears without a scratch a few minutes later.  Huh?

Also the un-needed violence escalates through the movie to point that my 10 and 13 walked away from the movie on their own.  The movie guys are trying to hype the movie to bring in the adult audience, but they have missed their target. Go back to how IM2 is set up with a villian and go down the comic strip road. Obviously the movie studio bean counters thought that more violence and personalized violence plus some seedy and controversial topics would bring in more dollars and Jon Favreau let them get away with it. As for the families that like the Captain America, Thor, and the Avengers movies,  Iron Man missed the mark and was a tin flop not a strong steel movie.

5641131,5,B00BL1BJFW,"If you are a fan of the franchise you can't go wrong with this movie.  Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic and is Iron Man in the same way that Christian Bale owned Batman.  My issue with this title however is how the digital copy redemption has been muddied to the point of being painfully annoying.  Previously, codes were typically available for iTunes or UltraViolet copy.  Both have their strengths and weaknesses which I won't go into in this review.  My complaint with the new trend in digital copies is that now end users are sent to a website to enter their redemption code found inside the jacket.  Once entered, three options are presented.  Amazon Digital Copy, iTunes, or Vudu (UltraViolet).

Now, choice is good, heck choice is FANTASTIC.  My complaint however arises from the fact that in order to try to get information about the service you have to click the link first.  Once you click the link, the redemption key is BOUND to that service, whether or not you actually choose to redeem the code.  Case in point, I was interested in reading more about the Amazon Digital Redemption so I clicked it to read the terms.  Decided I would rather have it in my Vudu library and tried to go back... low and behold every click towards another service would return a message that the key was already bound to Amazon.

I can understand trying to prevent fraudulent redemption, but how can you build a platform that binds a user to an option before the same user has a chance to read the terms for the provider. At the VERY least, a warning alerting users that once they click on a service the key will be bound would be helpful.  Not to mention linking the TOS for each provider on the FIRST Page so that you can view them before proceeding.

I didn't deduct stars because of this issue, the movie itself is fantastic.  Just a word of warning, be careful when you are getting your digital copy!!",1382918400,,1897,4.535294117647059
5641132,2,B00BL1BJFW,"There once was a game called 'Doki Doki Panic,' if you know it at all, you will probably know it as 'Super Mario Brothers 2.' It was a good game in its own right, but it wasn't a Mario game.  Rather, it was simply a solid game that they attached the Mario name to because of the popularity of the first game.  That's how this movie feels, it feels like it wasn't even meant to be an Iron Man movie and they just kind of made adjustments here and there to make it work.  There will be spoilers for the rest of this review, as I don't think it would be helpful to be vague on some points.

Let's start with some plot elements.  The main adversary is the terrorist known as the mandarin, his thing is basically that he has genetically engineered henchmen that can generate crazy heat.  This allows them to melt things (like an iron man suit) or just overheat and blow up like a giant bomb.  That's a kind of lame power when you think about it, but meh, I understand that they don't want every nemesis to just be some guy in an iron man suit, so no problems there.

The problems with the plot come from the sloppy plot devices.  Tony Stark picks a fight with the mandarin for really no good reason, and then a team of three helicopters attack Tony at home.  Wait... three helicopters... against Iron Man... let's stop and think about this for a second...  But wait, Tony's Iron Man suit is a prototype that doesn't work... well that was lucky for the guys in the helicopter wasn't it?  Good thing when they were planning this mission they were able to say ""Ya, we're just going in with a few helicopters, but it should be OK because I've got a hunch that the nearest suit will be a piece of junk.  Ya, he's got like 40 more suits downstairs, but I mean, what are the odds that he'll go down stairs?""... It's just ridiculous, but they did it because they wanted to strip Tony of all his advantages and allow him to prevail through determination.  It's the same as when Dark Knight Rises decided to make batman poor, sloppily done and frustrating.

Later, because he doesn't have any working suits, he decides to raid a terrorist compound on foot, with a hoodie and a bunch of stuff he got at home depot as weapons.  What is this nonsense?  He's Tony Stark, not Rambo-Macgyver.  And lastly, for the final fight, he suddenly has 40 spare suits that can act as drones.  Man those would've come in handy when raiding the compound, but the rubble of his house prevented them from being accessible.... until just the right moment.

There are many more problems, from a poorly-conceived Air Force One infiltration to absurd fights (this guy can melt my suit! I better ignore all the projectile weapons on my suit and fight him in melee range!).  Perhaps this all seems nitpicky, after all we should be willing to suspend disbelief to some degree for movies like this.  My problems stem from how sloppy this all was.  I will say, if you are a fan of the series thus far, you should still see this movie.  If the stuff I gripe about doesn't bother you, you may really enjoy it.  Problems aside, it's not that bad by itself.  But it's by far the weakest in the series.",1382918400,32,3153,4.365351629502573

So fun performances from Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley with some plot twists that will keep things interesting.

5641185,2,B00BL1BJFW,"I felt this was more about Tony Stark than Iron Man.  I realize the two are sort of a split persona, but I at least expected a 50/50 split of screen time between the two.  Instead, I sat through a dry movie with a recycled storyline that's been done to death in not just superhero movies, but movies in general.  Within the first few minutes of the opening scene, I immediately knew this was going to be a by-the-book movie.  It setup all the trademarks of rehashed plots we've all seen throughout the years.  There was practically no action and what felt like 30 seconds of Tony being in the Iron Man armor.  The ending with the various versions of armor just seemed like a ploy to sell action figures.  The end credits confirmed my opinion of the film.  There was so little action and so little screen time of Iron Man, that the majority of the action shots shown during the end credits were from the previous films.  I really like the first film for it's mix of comicbook-like action that blended well with a good origin story.  The second had a flew flaws, but was interesting.  The third just seems like a cash-grab.  Hopefully the other Marvel sequels coming out (Thor, Capt. America, Avengers, etc.) won't take this path.",1382832000,3,1228,4.506787330316742

5641188,3,B00BL1BJFW,"This movie was entertaining, to be sure. Lots of neat effects and some fight scenes. However, after two movies of ""character development,"" this movie fails to deliver on any front. The ending left me frustrated and an analysis of the movie reveals that the character went in a full circle; he was in no way different than when he started the movie. Everything is still the same in terms of what causes him distress. However, he no longer has an army of Iron Mans to help him since he destroyed them. The fact that they engaged in hand to hand combat with a foe that could magically disable them by touching their arm (Really?) was laughable.

5641208,2,B00BL1BJFW,"I can usually tell by the trailers if the film will be empty, action packed, exciting or lacking something.  When I saw the Iron Man 3 trailers, I got that feeling that something was not right.  I was not excited about the Mandarin, and I was even less excited about a non-Asian one.  I passed on this film in the theaters, and I saw the other two in theaters.

They need to give this film a redirection or this franchise will come to an abrupt end.  No reboot is needed, just get back to the story of IRON MAN!  More IRON MAN (that is the title, right?) and LESS Tony Stark and even less of Pepper!  The 3 Spider-man films suffered because they had too much Mary Jane!  Women slow down and ruin action films!  Men have women in their lives, but keep them for the lovin and keep them away from the action!

If you wanted to see this film expecting to see Iron Man, then you might want to watch another movie!  The least that you see in this film is Iron Man.  How can you have a film called ""Iron Man 3"" and hardly show Iron Man?  It was mostly about Tony Stark and his going without the armor.  I guess the producers of this film thought that recovering dope fiend, Robert Downey Jr. was the main attraction to Iron Man.  Maybe they placed too many bets on that, but I don't want to watch a super hero movie to NOT see the super hero, I want to see Iron Man.  You really don't see Iron Man and the little that you do see is half A.  Most of the armors are half done and they seem to get destroyed easily.  Also, the calling on armor pieces for anywhere is not cool.  Yeah, it may be easier to get the armor on instead of the briefcase, but it is silly an unrealistic.  The briefcase was Tony Stark and Iron Man!  It is also what made the character unique in Marvel Comics.  I guess they messed this up.

I was not always crazy about the Mandarin, but if they were going to show him, I was expecting the classical Mandarin which this film fools you into believing that you would get.  Instead, you get Mandarin that has no rings and is one that I don't recognize.  I stopped reading comic books around 1988 shortly after Amazing Spider Man #300, so who knows what happened after that?  This film was dull and Hollywood needs to understand, that with super hero films, people don't have time to wait on lame enemies, we want to see as much of the hero as possible and we want to see the villains - interesting villains!  Do that and you can have winners.  More of Iron Man 3 and no one will want to see super hero films anymore.  Given that there are few options for films these days, they need to get these right.  I vote for Dr. Doom as the villain in the next one, along with a minor villain at the start.",1382745600,7,2707,4.140115163147793

The movie proper had no musical accompaniment.  None.  Nada.  Zilch.  There was music in the opening credits before the movie starts, and a bit of sound track AFTER the climax of the film in the wrap up, and NOTHING in between.  The music and Robert Downy were the defining two elements of Iron Man 1 that made the thing work.  Number 3 only managed half.

Quiz: What do Iron Man 1 and Pacific Rim have in common?  A Ramin Djawadi musical score and mostly positive reviews.

Go watch Fifth Element and listen.  The Fifth Element CD sound track sucked as there is no full song or score per se, but Fifth Element uses musical sound to define and frame every scene.  Movie Audio Awesome (by Eric Serra).  Iron Man 3?  Visually fine, audible... out to lunch with nobody home.  Whoever heard of a Hollywood movie climax without climactic music?  Really?!

Shane Black better clean the wax out of his ears and remember that Hollywood movies are supposed to have a sound track.  How did everyone making, watching, and reviewing Iron Man 3 not notice?

Sure, the explosions are amazing and it looks like things are flying toward you, but that's not the main focus of the movie.  I never felt like the effects did anything except enhance the story.  The action scenes are amazing in 3D, though sometimes there is so much motion going on that if you're at all sensitive to that you might want to close your eyes.  I actually had to take a break for a bit after the mansion scene to rest, before watching any more.

The final battle was just a bit over dramatized, I thought.  To many iron men flying around.  It seemed his remote control units blew up awful easy, no wonder he didn't want to be in them!

5641261,4,B00BL1BJFW,"I just watched this on DVD. I am slightly disappointed. I didn't know a lot about the movie before watching it and so a couple of things took me buy surprise. First of all this is more of a Tony Stark Film than an Iron Man film. Sure, there are plenty of Iron Man suits in the move its just rare that Tony Stark is in them! However, I do like the anxiety and trauma issues that he is dealing with. That is good character development. I do like how Marvel has heroes that are not perfect and who have flaws. Makes them more human and I can relate to them better.

I was not happy with how they turned the Mandarin into a front and a fake for Killian. Sir Ben Kingsley  is a great actor and he was doing a good job as the Mandarin and even though it was a good plot twist, and that scene where the truth is told is great, I would have liked to have seen Kingsley play out the bad guy role. The movie does have a ton of really good action scenes and I did enjoy the story itself. Guy Pierce does an excellent job as the villain, Killian.

As usual Robert Downey Jr. is superb as Tony Stark. It is his movie and he provides great quips and attitude and also a real depth of humanity as he deals with his trauma along with the terrifying events that are unfolding. I enjoy the continuity of the Marvel Universe and how the movie tied his PSTD to the events from the Avenger's movie.

Despite my slight disappointment with a couple of issues the movie is an exciting action adventure roller coaster ride!",1382572800,,1498,4.13745704467354

5641283,2,B00BL1BJFW,"(SPOILERS)

The original Iron Man stands as one of the Top 5 Superhero films ever composed and set the foundation for an exciting franchise, but with the exception of Avengers, our red suited engineer has been in a tailspin since take two. I later came to appreciate Iron Man 2 as an action film and had every confidence the third would return the story to solid footing (as The Last Crusade did for Indiana Jones), but instead they went full steam ahead with the same problems that afflicted 2 and then added some more just to make sure. The most obvious was the irrelevant kid sidekick, but to be honest they lost me with the cliche setup of, ""goofy people Tony overlooked in the past,"" coming back as hardcore villains. If that wasn't bad enough, one of them is ""yet another"" smarmy business rival in the military-industrial complex. What, again? Just how many business rivals of Iron Man are going to go full evil? It's true he faces a large number of them in comics, but there were other enemies who could have fought without recycling that plot device for a Round 3.

The Mandarin could have been one of them, but in order to make the concept behind the character work with the foregoing tried plot device, they had to whitewash the Mandarin into a drunk British actor masquerading as cocktail of anti-American movements while replacing his dramatically charged eco-terrorism into a limp-wristed commentary on how the military-industrial complex tries to manipulate both the supply and demand sides of the War on Terror.

This was marketed as an intense and personal film with a strong revenge element, one that would pit Iron Man against a terrifying opponent, but ended up being the most disneyfied of the Marvel movies thus far: shallow themes, cartoony villains, a plot and protagonist trapped in a hamster wheel, with awkward resolutions to most unresolved plot threads.",1382486400,,1881,4.8354037267080745
5641294,5,B00BL1BJFW,"In a surprising turn of events, Marvel/Disney chose to forgo the typical by-the-numbers superhero formula, and craft something far different for this installment of Iron Man- a movie wherein the protagonists's flaws and weaknesses are highlighted, as opposed to his propensity for banter and ass-kicking (which are still present, mind you). The result of these efforts (and they are darned good efforts, so hats off the writers), is a story in which our superhero feels much more HUMAN, as opposed to SUPERHUMAN, and this works well. The end of the world scenario is fine for superhero movies, but it's been done so many times now, it lacks novelty or any real sense of urgency. This movie's more focused plot (with smaller stakes) is more in line with something like ""Kick Ass"", where the emphasis is on a more personal level, and in my book, way more effective. There's still special effects and beat-downs galore, so this series has not turned into a Hallmark movie or anything- it's just more intelligent now.

Guy Pearce also performs impressively as Downey's nemesis.  The writing is crisp and clever, and the directing controlled and masterly.

5641376,3,B00BL1BJFW,this movie was ok. Wish Tony wasn't having so many inner  demons . Felt him out of the suit all the time kinda sucked,1382400000,,117,3.875
5641377,5,B00BL1BJFW,"The third and most likely the last Iron Man far exceeded my expectations; the script was fun. I happen to like Robert Downey Jr. and Gwenyth Peltrow.  This version did not lack from explosions or terrorist motives, suspense or drama or sarcasim. It's one movie I will watch again and again.  There is so much going on, in that Stark manages to create 3-D additional Iron Men, which I found entertaining, technology develops and moves on.  Stark is still experimenting and having fun doing it. I thought the ideas of multiple Iron Men was fun, each having a specific trait of Tony's or a different ability was entertaining. The movie kept my mind working and engrossed in what was happening. I liked the facade for the Manderin. It was an interesting twist. I still enjoyed this Iron Man, a lot of thought went into the script to make the movie work.",1382400000,,849,4.6092715231788075
5641378,5,B00BL1BJFW,The movie arrived right on time and it was brand new. The movie itself was in very good condition. I love the Iron Man series,1382400000,,125,4.04

5641396,1,B00BL1BJFW,"Some people have said that Iron Man 3 was the best, which I strongly disagree with.  The movie itself relied on computer animation and not on a creative story line.

5641398,5,B00BL1BJFW,Robert Downey Jr. is amazing in all the Iron Man movies. We especially liked the uniqueness of this movie. Of the 3 I think this was our fave. Pepper is wow! in the one which took this over the top. Must see!,1382400000,,208,3.9761904761904763

5641415,5,B00BL1BJFW,"I didn't see it in the theaters (hardly ever ""go out"" anymore because of the noisy kids in most theaters these days) but my wife and I enjoyed watching it in 3D the day it was released in our home cinema.",1382313600,,204,4.0
5641416,3,B00BL1BJFW,"I loved the first two Iron Man films and of course the Avengers.  I was really looking forward to this film with Tony and a whole gang of new Iron Man armor.  Instead Tony is a basket case of fear and self-doubt.  He is out of the suit for most of the film and at the end he destroys all of the cool suits that he has made in the course of the last few years (hello and goodbye, we never knew you).  It was kind of a bummer for me and I hope this isn't where the series ends.  Bring back the Tony/Iron Man that I know and love.",1382313600,,527,3.7545454545454544
5641417,4,B00BL1BJFW,This is the most action-packed Iron Man movie in the trilogy. There were 3 amazing actions scenes in this movie that I re-watched a few times. The Blu-ray is full of extras including a nice prequel to the TV show SHIELD.

5641420,3,B00BL1BJFW,"I went in to buy a DVD movie and came out of Amazon with this in the cloud. I really wanted the DVD for our library in the mountains because we cannot get ""the Cloud"" up there, too rural and no phone line cable because it's microwaved. The only reason I gave this a three!

But, to the movie, it was thoroughly entertaining and I felt the best on yet. Acting was fun and natural, computer enhancements were fantastic and felt almost possible, but the entertainment value was a 9+.",1382313600,,480,4.333333333333333

There were a few good action scenes, but they were meagerly parsed out amidst a lot of mildly comedic chit chat.  It was hard to believe, but they really failed to make a good movie.  It seemed like a lot of out takes that could be edited down to an okay trailer but as a full length movie it was a dud. What a dud! Don't get burned, watch something else!",1382227200,9,509,4.06
5641435,5,B00BL1BJFW,With a family full of boys the Iron man trilogy has become a fast family favorite. We love the action and the dialog doesn't  disappoint!

For what they were trying to do, its probably about as good as it was going to get with the concept they wanted to do. I know what i was buying from seeing it in theater, just wanted to complete my collection from the others. If you have the other two movies you might as well get it.

5641467,1,B00BL1BJFW,"I have to say I was very disappointed on Iron Man 3. I loved the first 2. This is mainly because, since I am a comic book geek, and viewing how the writers tried to put the Mandarin alongside the Extremis to combine a crazy story that was just all over the place and hard to follow. These are supposed to be two separate stories. Marvel Knights Iron Man was the best in the Extremis story and it was a motion comic.  The Mandarin supposed to journey the globe to collect the 10 rings that made him become the great villain who then takes on Iron Man. Ben Kingsley is a good actor but his character of the Mandarin was weak, and now where near the what the comic depicts of what he supposed to be. I enjoyed all the other Marvel super-hero movies to build up the ""Avengers"" climatic mother lode movie, but they should have stopped making them after that.",1382140800,7,853,4.265432098765432

Also, this movie is loosely based on the ""Extremis"" story arch from the comics, but the story was butchered in order to make it work for the movie. If the Extremis storyline in the comics ended like the movie version it probably would have been one of the most hated stories in the Iron Man series.

5641557,1,B00BL1BJFW,"Whew where do I begin. After waiting impatiently for 3 years for IM 3 here goes:

Firstly, I AM a comic fan so I am familiar with the Marvel universe. Secondly, this was the most OBNOXIOUSLY arrogant film I've ever seen. Shane Black completely RUINED the Avengers continuity--Oh no, not from me but from Joss Whedon himself!! Youtube it--

This script had some good dialogue and ideas other than the obvious flaws that the Mandarin was a fake and ridiculous and Tony never wore the suit very much and when he did it would just fall off??(or the hero half the screen time fights unmasked). I'm tired of writers premising a plot that interferes with what the characters are ABOUT. Yes you can throw in the personal character conflict and STILL maintain the action as long as said action includes yep, you guessed it, Iron Man (since that IS the title of movie). I'm also sick of the writers always making our hero a 'bumbling incompetent buffoon' til the end of the movie when they finally 'save the day'. You want personal character conflict address Tony's alcoholism not his panic attacks.

The Iron Patriot was useless. The Killian character was never developed--How did they attain their powers? (Yes I know it was from some mutant plant but really they exist...??? Wanna explain that a lil more???) Why did some of them spontaneously combust? Why was Killian actually the Mandarin?? How was the actor not spotted by his actor buddies and not exposed as a fraud??

The female botanist character was COMPLETELY worthless and added NOTHING to the plot or in any help to Tony.

The Christmas Carol character of 'Timmy' the antagonist was annoying and actually made me angry at him.

Also, are you telling me ALL of Tony's suits are stored in his Malibu home? All in plain sight?? None in the basement of any of his probably other 20 locales he owns? Not 1??? Also he communicated with Jarvis the whole time why didn't he order up the robot army sooner?? WHY did it take days to charge his worthless suit?? WITH electricity. Why didn't Jarvis summon the Iron Patriot suit?? He can 'overide' all commands thus far...In a life or death situation WHY wouldn't he use a tried and true suit to insure your safety?? A squirrely malfunctioning prototype to protect you from a real threat??? Yeah that's a good idea...And no one thought to call the other Avengers?? At least Captain America?

Are you also telling me terrorists needed Stark to publicly tell them his Malibu address to find it they couldn't GPS or google it themselves?? NOR was he in the LEAST prepared for said attack???

The regeneration theme was better suited to an X Men movie, NOT Iron Man. IM should be about hi tech villains and gadgetry, not an army of Human Torches which could also be a Fantastic Four movie but I digress

The little kid was in the movie because when Robert Downey makes appearances at Comicons the kids show up in droves to honor IM wearing their mini IM suits and IM gear pointing their pretend laser blasts from their hands at him (you can youtube this if you want to see it). I suppose this was homage/appeasement to their loyalty. This is also possibly why RD doesn't want to play the role of Tony Stark anymore.

When Iron Man was flying 100 mph and hit the semi truck going probably 70 on the bridge and it knocks his suit off, Tony had to land on the pavement going at least 80--AND survives??

This movie SUCKED on so many levels it makes Cat Woman look like Citizen Kane. When you have Thor, Captain America and The Avengers being taken seriously then you pull this kinda crap on us you should be sent to comic book HELL or at least made to watch Aliens or Predator or Jurassic Park OR The Avengers 10 times each to see a REAL action movie.

This is what happens when Joss Whedon and Jon Favreau don't direct.

I hope Shane Black NEVER works again.

BTW, Iron Man 2 ROCKED

I also don't know why our president in 2013 (It is set in OUR current timeline) is STILL GW Bush??? Oh wait--to make our current regime look like bad guys in a movie would be racist gotta keep it old white guys they are the true villains in America right?? NOT our REAL bold face PROVEN liar of a president--

--Liberal Hollywood at it's finest...

3/1/14

After seeing Thor: The Dark World is even MORE reason to hate Shane Black--Hey Shane you ever seen a comic book movie??? Or a movie for that matter coz you don't know d$%k about it. The director of Thor in the Marvel One Shot was desperately trying to UNDO what Shane Tard did to the Mandarin and continuity of the Avengers/Marvel Universe. Go youtube Joss Whedon giving Shane B crap as well.

Letting Shane Black direct Iron Man 3 is like letting a retarded kid do a finger painting--You might like it, but it's NOT art.

Shane Black is a MORON even his name sounds moronic

AND this is an immature college effort that I give an F- and two thumbs DOWN

6 8 15:  All Hail to the King at the end of Thor: The Dark World was an attempt to SAVE the disjointed mess Shane ""On Crack' Black made of Iron Man 3.

But what really makes this movie for me is the moments of character interaction: Tony blows off a standard-pitiful plea from Harley (the little kid who's helping him rebuild his suit and his confidence), saying he knows the kid's cold ""because we have a connection"" and driving away--and Harley shrugs, smiles, and says it was worth a shot, completely unfazed.

The action sequences build throughout the movie, all the while we are are given a deeper look into the thoughts, feelings, and inner motivations of each of the characters.  This movie thus falls into that rare category generally known as ""intelligent sci-fi.""  Great storyline, with a few plot twists to keep you on your toes.  The special effects are absolutely mind-blowing on this disc...especially in Blu-Ray.  My one complaint:  we need more Gwynneth Paltrow.  She has the class and charisma to warrant more screen time.  The romance between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts has been steadily growing throughout the series, so I say it's time to let her be the Bacall to her Bogey.  A fun ride nonetheless.

I like the correlation between the movies, as they work toward building the universe itself as a whole so that it seems more real and also tangible--given that he is dealing with issues that anyone could have in real life.

5641655,5,B00BL1BJFW,"This may be the best of the three Iron Man Films to date, and in this reviewer's opinion, certainly one of the most meaningful and entertaining theater releases of the 2013 summer season. Robert Downey Junior's Tony Stark is back. However, gnawing at him are the post-traumatic effects of his exposure to the aliens and worm-hole stresses of his work with the Avengers in New York (as experienced in the earlier Marvel's The Avengers film of last year). The effects on his life range from an inability to sleep, to a constant tinkering with variations of his Iron Man robotic suits (reflecting a heightened focus on insulating his body) and an inadvertent distancing of himself from the woman he truly loves, Pepper Potts. And into this uncertain time in his life comes a new threat to world peace who will only identify himself as the mysterious ""Mandarin"" and who Tony learns uses ex-soldiers as unknowing human bombs to accomplish his agenda.  Worse yet, as Downey Jr./Stark narrates from the very film's outset, it's all the result of Stark's own past carelessness with others coming to bite him back in the present. Tony takes a pasting in his initial battles with the Mandarin before realizing the true influence behind the Mandarin's overt terrorist attacks. Along with Robert Downey Jr.'s and Gwyneth Paltrow's own strong acting and familiarity with their roles, the characters and film are abetted by the enjoyable involvement of a ""wiser-than-his-years"" fun ten-year old boy. Despite all his gusto, and all his wealth, Tony Stark has to dig deep within himself, to his own core innovativeness to rescue himself and his world and resolve the obscured complexities he's become enmeshed in - personal and collective. This film offers enthralling action in the tradition of the best of the Iron Man films, and it's also great storytelling with a very human and wonderful moral tale.  The films' resolution is visually and morally uplifting!  I highly recommend it.",1381708800,3,1970,5.018348623853211

5641658,1,B00BL1BJFW,The packaging was really nice and colorful and the case seemed sturdy.  I should have let it be but no I insisted on watching the movie.  Big mistake. There was no plot just a series of plot holes flying in loose formation.  The actors were directed by a man who should have stuck with 7-11 training films.  He clearly knew nothing about the franchise and in fact by the end he had literally ripped the heart out of Iron Man and discarded it. Not one character mattered and neither did their poorly explicated actions.  If only Amazon had directed this turkey.,1381622400,,560,4.5049504950495045

I tried everything. It showed up on my computer when I viewed it there but not on the TV. The captioning is always on for the TV so it wasn't that.

5641676,5,B00BL1BJFW,"I love the Iron Man movies. IM I was my favorite, until I saw this one. This movie is really more about Tony Stark than about Iron Man. Or more accurately, it's about Tony Stark coming to terms with just who Iron Man is. It begins with a man who is pretty badly unsettled by the events of The Avengers. He fought beside demi-gods and truly enhanced humans, and he describes himself as ""a man in a can."" This movie is about him finding the worth of Tony Stark.

I'm not a real fan of Guy Pearce, anyway, and he didn't fail to disappoint as the villain in this movie.  Probably a bad call on the director's part since sequels are already suspect (is it a story or just a franchise?) and a weak villain, after the epic nastiness of Jeff Bridges' and Mickey Rourke's villains, didn't do the film any service.",1381449600,,430,4.417721518987341

I don't mind a kinda wild, implausible story, but this time nothing makes any sense at all anymore. Without giving anything away, the technology displayed via the new ""suit"" is so advanced, one would imagine that with tech like that, there is absolutely no reason for anyone to be inside the suit at all. The real movie would be one of indestructible drones going around and instantly dispatching of every bad guy that ever walked the earth (in the first half-hour) and the last two hours, everyone living peacefully in a world devoid of evil megalomaniacs. But the real movie features a Tony Stark, who apparently, selectively applies his genious as the plot requires, and likewise, somehow his IQ will drop drastically to facilitate a plot device that otherwise would never come to fruition.

Still a fun movie overall and certainly worth the price of admisson with all the flash and effects. Enjoy.",1381449600,,1028,4.807909604519774

This movie was an interesting extension of the series, but seemed a bit ""out of place"" when considering the capabilities of Iron Man established in the first two installments and The Avengers. Iron Man appeared weak and paltry. I'm sure this was the desire, to convey a since of Tony Stark loosing himself and Iron man along with it, but it went way too far. I wouldn't be super jazzed to see this movie a second time.",1381449600,,470,4.413793103448276
5641755,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron man guy (Tony?) has a flashback of meeting two people he kinda uses and abuses. Of course the flashback is not just to fill up a movie. They return to the plot to cause pain and damage.

I guess maybe I have seen too many of these movies to know if my ""eh"" feeling about this one is just boredom setting in or if this movie really was boring. I mean it was good and all of that but it just didn't seem to have a kick to it. It also seemed to comment in a sly ways on this or that in society as these types of movies do but they really didn't focus too much on them to really say much. I mean was the entire osama bin laden just to poke fun at him/mock him? or was there something else there? I mean if that had been in a movie circa 2004 then yeah it would have gone over well. But now? Just kinda goofy. And the idea that a person would go so far to regrow a limb that they would kill many people . . . is that social commentary on the science community using killed children (ie abortion) to regrow limbs or is that just showing human weakness and self-centeredness? I dunno. It was kinda mentioned in passing.

5641773,5,B00BL1BJFW,"I am not going to give away anything plotwise for those who haven't seen this movie yet but my advice to everyone is to watch ""The Avengers"" before watching this one.  The reason for this is because the movie frequently references things that happened there and they will make more sense to the viewer.  It at least sticks with canon where the films are concerned.  While ""The Avengers"" isn't necessarily ""Iron Man 2.5"", there are things that happen to the Tony Stark character in that film that come into play in ""Iron Man 3"".

(Personal side note, I purchased the single disc DVD, just because that was in my budget.  I would have preferred Blu Ray but I am one movie fan who doesn't really nitpick about formats.  I will watch a film on VHS if I want to see it bad enough.)

That notwithstanding, it is still a great film on its own.  If you want to see Robert Downey Jr. a LOT, this film will NOT disappoint you in that department, nor will you feel cheated out of special effects galore, stunning and jaw dropping stunts, and great stuff all around.

Ben Kingsley is hilarious.  There are many instances where you laugh out loud in this film.

It is an all around entertaining way to spend two hours and eleven minutes.

The story takes place around Christmas time, which surprised me that it was a summer film.  I guess Paramount figured it would be a better time to launch the third film in the franchise.  It isn't technically a ""holiday"" film anyway, but in any case, Paramount studios dominated movie theaters when this first came out and then ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" started playing a week or so later and they ran concurrently there for a while..then ""Star Trek"" got released for home viewing first.

One last thing.  Watch all the way through the credits.  Like the previous two movies, there is an ""Easter egg"" that hints to what may or may not happen if a fourth film ever gets made.

I enjoyed the film and ultimately having a good time while watching a movie is the most important thing.",1381363200,72,2007,4.497237569060774

5641825,2,B00BL1BJFW,I enjoyed the first and second Iron Man movie but I can't understand what all the hype is about with the third movie.  Was Iron Man really even in the third movie?  He spent more time trying to get in the suit then he did actually wearing the suit.  I am still trying to figure out why this movie made so much money at the box office.  I am also trying to figure out why the ctritics loved this movie and hated man of steel.  Everyone said this movie was better than Man Of Steel.  I felt Man Of Steel was 10 times better than this movie which is why I saw MOS twice in the theater.  I like Iron Man just like every one else here.  I have watched the first and second movie many times.  Iron Man was the highlight of the Avengers movie and I watched that several times as well.  The third Iron Man movie will only be watched once!,1381190400,,830,4.0060975609756095

Yup - that about sums up the character of Tony Stark - an arrogant, likeable jerk - brings out the human side in all of us.  I'm not a big comic book fan, so I don't really understand the complaints about how the Mandarin character doesn't match the comics. As a movie though, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1381190400,,469,4.2

5641828,3,B00BL1BJFW,It was ok. I didn't like the fact that they were ending it. And to end it like that was no good to me. They gave him PTSD over the New York thing in the avengers. They could've just made another iron man movie they didn't have to link the avenger movie in to it. Iron man didn't even save the day pepper did. I think who ever wrote it should give it up.,1381190400,,353,3.7837837837837838

If you are a die-hard Iron Man fan then you'll probably like the movie but if you expect at least a minimum of consistency and expectations then you might be disappointed with Iron Man 3, we were.",1381190400,4,505,4.270833333333333

Come on . . . is making ""The Mandarin"" a crazy white guy, better than making him a rich Chinese revolutionary ... oh I see the problem.
I am offended by the politically correct replacement of the Chinese villain, with a crazy white guy. Pure Communist Racism!
Totally racist against the Muslims as well (who have nothing to do with the ""Mandarin""), but don't make the Chinese Commies mad?

Usually Disney likes demonic magic for their characters.
But not the alien technology rings of the real ""Mandarin"".
Alien tech + Chinese villain = great bad guy.
""The Mandarin"" could have been his own Billion dollar movie in china alone.
Such short sightedness of the white homosexual Disney Communists.

Just to sell more movie copies?
Why? In a land of stealing communists, that do not respect other people's property.
A country where there will only be one Blu-ray sold, the rest will be illegal copies pirated for 5 dollars each.

The Comics are available on line, if Disney needs to see how it is done.

Will these guys ever understand that they are NOT Stan Lee.
There is no point re-writing Marvel comics, when the master has already given you the completed work.
Just stick with the experts.

Stop sacrificing the integrity of the stories already written, to imbed your communism.

Yes integrity, awesomeness . . . Why else did Disney pay 4.64 Billion for Marvel.
More than Disney paid for Star Wars!!!

As a movie . . .
- The movie has lots of ups and downs.
- Sometimes communist, sometimes capitalist.
- Sometimes Tony is a woman, other times Tony is a man.
- At times it seemed like I was watching a Hallmark movie.
- Pepper suddenly learns how to do martial arts and kick a missile at the bad white guy. The untrained uncaring constantly complaining woman saves the superhero. Come on.
- Don't dare be a patriot or a man, or you will have a midlife crisis.
- Go back to sleep, being a normal person is so much better than being all you can be.
- Tony finally goes all the way, putting himself on the line to save others in Avengers, only to wimp out over an entire movie.
- The War Machine/Patriot Armor is coded to one guy. But yet the president and the bad guys can use it with no problem.

- Worth seeing once
- . . . not worth owning.
- I have the Blu-Ray version, should have waited a few years.

Really disappointed . . . it should have been better, less liberal, less communist.

I had hope for Marvel Movies respecting the characters when Captain America said ""There's only one GOD, ma'am, and I don't think he dresses like that.""

Remember in 1942 Disney supported Hitler (National Socialist Party), the Soviet Union has fallen, maybe China is there last best Hope. Don't get mad, it's only History, you can look it up.

Disney please, change your plans to re-imagine-commie-neering Voltron . . .

Bottom line:
Destroy what makes you an extraordinary individual, so other people will like you.
Typical liberal communist religious dogma.
Maybe one day they will make an Iron Man 3.",1381017600,4,3105,4.571171171171171

5641925,1,B00BL1BJFW,"I just watched the movie for the first time on DVD last night, and now this morning I'm still upset with it, so here goes the rant.

There are a lot of good things in the movie, which makes it seem like it's a continuation of the very good Iron Man I and II, but it slowly loses its grip on reality and the last 10 minutes are absolutely horrible. So let's start with a list of retcons.

1. Tony is back in Malibu, his original house, not the Stark Tower built in Avengers.
2. Tony has anxiety attacks rather than physical problems to solve.
3. His armor splits into pieces that fly and operate on their own rather than being powered by 1 arc reactor.
4. War Machine opens like the armor in Avengers, but War Machine is the Mark I and we know how that has to be opened by an external machine seen in Iron Man I.
5. Pepper isn't familiar with Tony's former girlfriends and disapproves of them...but she was his personal assistant who 'took out the trash' with them multiple times, and even said that lifestyle was 'ok.'
6. Tony becomes stupid, not remembering how his own tech works and has to be reminded by Jarvis, and can't even take down 3 pathetic attack helicopters when he is in his newest armor. And he knows the attack is coming, because he invited the Mandarin 'to his house.'
7. The armor isn't air tight, and he gets water in it. In Iron man I and Avengers he goes into space, therefore it is air tight.
8. The armor can now be cut in half by the touch of a very hot hand...but only got nicked a bit by Whiplash's energized lashes.
9. Tony can't seem to measure distance, because he tells Pepper to let go and he'll catch her, then he misses by a mile with no outside interference. The man is a mechanical genius and has an eye for detail, yet he overestimates the reach of his arm by half a meter? No.
10. War Machine can be worn and operated by anyone, not just Tony and Rhodey, including the President.
11. Tony building in his workshop is now obsessive behavior jeopardizing his relationship with Pepper.
12. Tony's armor is now a 'cocoon' that is holding him back in life.
13. The armor and being Iron man is now holding him back from being with Pepper. In Avengers she encourages him to 'do his homework.'
14. Tony can have surgery to remove the shrapnel in his chest...this is a big one, and directly contradicts Iron man I and II. In II Tony was dying because he had to have the arc reactor in his chest. Why not have the surgery then?
15. Being a superhero, saving the day and people's lives, is now a negative. That's not the Iron man we saw in Avengers who has accepted his role and is happy with it.
16. Rhodey leaves the fight to get the President away from harm...and never comes back to help. That is not his character, who would never leave Tony hanging.
17. Pepper suddenly turns into a badass fighter with moves that she had no right pulling off.
18. Iron Man doesn't do combat missions anymore. Suddenly that's War Machine's job.
19. Iron Man's plethora of weapons in his armor suddenly disappears.
20. General physics, which was adhered to pretty well in Iron man I, II, and Avengers get thrown out the window with Extremis.

Overall, the theme is 'being a superhero is a temporary cool thing that becomes a negative and must be abandoned in order to live a happy, normal life.' By the end of the movie Tony's armor is a bad thing that he has to destroy to get his life back, get Pepper back, and fully heal. THAT isn't Iron Man, and is completely contradictory to what we see in I, II, and Avengers. This movie takes a superhero and turns him into a broken man who has to return to the bliss that is 'being normal,' and that is a total betrayal of the series and of the character.

This is a movie I really wish hadn't been made and that I hadn't seen. It leaves a sick feeling in your stomach afterwards, and a sense of WTF just happened? Someone else compared it to ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and I have to agree that a similar hatchet job was done here. In the end the only thing that matters is getting the girl and living a normal life. But Ironman can't live a normal life. He HAS to have the arc reactor in his chest or he'll die.

Not in this movie. He gets surgery, is fully healed, and even chucks the miniaturized arc reactor into the ocean, effectively saying good riddance.

This movie just makes me want to puke.",1381017600,64,4355,4.291970802919708

I like stories that have the blow'em up stuff with plot that makes the characters believable. This one is a good blend of the two.

I would have liked to see more of the development of the Mandarin's character, though. It was a little anticlimactic when his Tony finally caught up to him.",1380931200,,507,4.3936170212765955

Ironman 1 is fun and I enjoyed how it introduced us to the iron hero, Ironman 2 took it a step further and punched up the danger without allowing EVERY FOE to kick ironman's ass. Then there's three. The worst of the lot. I would watch Green Lantern Again before I watched this movie. I don't want to give away any plot for those who might be reading this who haven't seen it suffice it to say the plot takes center stage and our ""hero"" is more vulnerable than ever.

5641932,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Note: Plot Spoilers.

There were so many plot misses in this film, I'm not even sure where to begin. Let's start with Iron Patriot. Rhodey was never the Iron Patriot. Instead, the real origin is that Norman Osborne takes control of the War Machine suit from the government and paints it to be the Iron Patriot (at first to be a villain, then later redeems himself as a good guy). Ignoring the film's poorly rewritten origin, the Iron Patriot was absolutely unnecessary to the plot. It added nothing. If Rhodey had been wearing his War Machine suit, the plot would have been identical. It was simply added as a merchandising tactic. How many 'War Machine' toys can you sell? Parents probably aren't even happy by this name. However, the 'Iron Patriot' is a much more uplifting name from a merchandising perspective. Of course, they even point this naming piece out using dialog within the film. I digress.

This film completely lost its way nearly throughout. Abduction of the president of the US? Seriously? The vice president is compromised because of his daughter's (plot convenient) missing limb? How much suspension of disbelief are we expected to put forth here? I rolled my eyes as soon as I saw the vice president's role.

Unfortunately, it seemed this movie's sole goal was to show us Tony Stark out the Iron Man suit more than in it. If I go to an Iron Man film, I expect to see Iron Man doing Iron Manly things actually IN the Iron Man suit. Not Tony Stark galavanting about in t-shirts and jeans. I also don't expect to see robotic remote control Iron Men all doing random things. Again, it's about Iron Man, not some robotic IronFest.

While the actors put forth their level best to reprise their roles, and did so quite well, the plot was just so far off the mark not even the best acting could reel in this story disaster. Yes, it even concluded with fairly cliche  and convenient happy ending, but what it took to get there wasn't really worth the time and effort. And worse, it shows Tony having his shrapnel finally removed. If it were that easy to have had it removed, why didn't that happen at the end of the first film? If it were that easy, why was the electromagnet even necessary?

Overall, the Iron Man series should have ended with Iron Man 2. This one probably should have gone direct to DVD.

5641979,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Before we attend to details about the movie itself, I want to draw your attention to an item I spotted in the lab scene (6:17). When Tony asks for the Christmas music to begin, there's a quick shot of the record player. Nearby, there's a red album cover on the table.

It's A Charlie Brown Christmas, the read-along storybook and record album with dialogue from the sound track. This record album was released in the late '70s on the ""Charlie Brown Records"" label, a division of Disneyland/Vista Records. You won't see this factoid anywhere else, nor should you. Apparently talented visionary genius types like Tony Stark like Peanuts -- and cool cartoon records.

(AS IN MOST REVIEWS, THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS ABOUT WHAT SPOILED THE MOVIE)

Anyway, I wish the entire film was as satisfactory. Iron Man 3 was certainly entertaining in the current superspetacular movie-as-theme-park-ride way, but there are some serious story flaws that I suspect sprang from whoever forced the filmmakers to add the ""twist"" of the Mandarin being an actor.

I do not object to the idea as a comic book fan as so many have, but because you can tell that the rest of the film seems to have been reconfigured to make this micro-managed plot splotch work.

It may be a guess, but if the film were not reconfigured, that would make the two years of work by the entire cast and crew seem less than what they are clearly capable of. The film works so well up until the scene in which the fake Mandarin is revealed, I cannot believe that that such an experienced, accomplished team did this by design. Something's fishy, no matter how much the director and screenwriter valiantly try to make excuses for the situation on the otherwise fascinating audio commentary (which reveals more about the personalities of the duo than the film).

Robert Downey, Jr. is the heart and soul of the film, optimizing both the dramatic and comic aspects. The Pepper character is just as strong, caring and competent as ever, though her sports bra superpower moments also seem added -- Pepper was plenty strong already folks, without supplements.

The special effects are of course, top of the line, especially in the home destruction scene. What is truly remarkable is the nail-biting aerial rescue as the people plummet through the sky. This is what makes this kind of film great. Yet, the climactic battle scene is just one explosion after another, with as many Iron Man suits as they could fit into the scenes -- again, seeming to come from someone saying, ""Let's cram in a lot of suits? That'll make it better!""

Again, I have to wonder if the climactic battle was always between Tony and Killian. Guy Pearce is a superb actor in the right role, but he doesn't come across as the ""real"" Mandarin. He's much better as the smarmy, creepy toady of the real boss (like he was in Bedtime Stories). No matter how things burst into flames and explode, Pearce as a super villain never gets truly scary, just very very moussed and veiny.

I sure hope that in the next Avengers movie, Sub Mariner finds the Iron Man chest thingy that Tony threw into the ocean at the end. We need an Iron Man 4. This film made enough money to finance it. Let's hope this is not the last time we see Downey don the suit.

The product arrived early and presented with good digital and audio features.  My issue is more about the movie in general.  Sadly, my wife and I couldn't help but be bored at times (a majority of the middle of the film) and feel that the writers were going for a more unrealistic means that just didn't feel as believable as the other two films.  Granted, none of them are really believable, but this one stretched that limit perhaps too far.  I will try not to spoil the film for anyone with all of our reasons, but I will say we were most disappointed with the representation of the Mandarin.  You would have thought his rings could have been tech related and play more of a role like in the comics, but sadly this was not even close to the case.  Don't get me wrong, the film was okay, but not great.  Parts of it were funny, there were a few good action sequences, and they attempted to pull you in with emotions at times.  However, we feel the other 2 films did a better job.  This is only my wife's and my option and you might feel it was the best Iron Man Film thus far, but for us, it ranks last in the series.

5642065,5,B00BL1BJFW,"I took my youngest son to see this in the theaters because there are some movies that you need to see on the big screen first & this is one of them.  But, when it became available to buy, I snatched it up right away & couldn't hardly wait the 2 days free shipping I get with my Prime membership.

I've watched the DVD's, both regular & Blu-Ray a few times with my nephew or just by myself.  It doesn't disappoint being seen on a TV screen instead of the theater but that might be because I've already saw it in the theater.  I do recommend this movie to any Iron Man fan along with any fan of Marvel in general.  You can see that there is going to be a sequel after the movie is over & I can't remember if that was in the theater release or not.  But it does give you an idea of the character that will be the bad guy if there is a sequel.  But that doesn't take away from how good this movie is.

This is going to be one of those DVD's that I will watch over & over as time goes along.  Just like I am doing with the Avengers & the Thor movies as well as the Fantastic Four's & X-Men ones also.",1380758400,,1095,3.8526785714285716

5642070,3,B00BL1BJFW,Iron Man 3 is the follow up movie to the Avengers so it had a lot to live up to. The first Iron Man movie pretty much set up what super hero movies needed to do it had a good balance of humor and action to make it to a successful and a great movie. The 2nd one was good as well despite it being slower paced. Then of coarse we get the Avengers which is one of the best if not the best super hero movies ever made so how does this one live up. Well my biggest grip with this movie is that it doesn't feel like a iron man movie. It feels more like Die hard or lethal weapon with Tony Stark and robots. Theres actually more fighting outside of his iron man armor in this movie then with it on and when he does have it on it breaks apart. As for the villain the kinda butchered what the Mandarin was about worse yet the had a guy that closely looked like the one from the comics and turned it into a joke and the real one was just a generic white guy. Also the ten rings that the mandarin used was turned into some weird genetic experiments so in my opinion the villain was the worst part. Anyway there is some good things about the movie the end fight was pretty epic and there was a lot of good humor here just as the 1st movies were. The acting is good and of coarse Robert Downey jr. is still the perfect choice for tony stark. So do I recommend this movie I would say rent it first and see what you think of it its not perfectly done like the original movie but theres still some fun to be had here 3.9/5 stars,1380758400,,1511,3.909090909090909

5642072,1,B00BL1BJFW,"This ruined the series and the Mandarin. Any real comic book fan was dropkicked in the face from watching this horrific movie. Plot from start to ending never follows any of the books nor story in any which way form to charter profiles. If anything the Mandarin that they cast is closer to Magma then the martial artist master with power of the 5 rings Mandarin. Feel like rushed 1/2 baked script to just end the series instead of going out with honor and glory. Another flaw of a character profile mishap is Patriot was not War Machine in the comic it actually Norman Osborn a villain role trying to use his connection in the military and attempts to steal Tony tech to combat spider-man. Obviously they had change this due to Sony owning Spider-Man rights, but just leave this out has no business in the movie if not gonna do it justice. Anyone remember Spider Man 3 looks like history repeats it's self here.",1380758400,6,911,4.527272727272727

5642077,4,B00BL1BJFW,"You ever see a movie where the hero/superhero has been beat up by the villain and is pretty much impotent the entire movie? Well, welcome to Iron Man 3. Notice some of the other reviews that say......really picked up at the end? Last 20 minutes good? stuff like that?

Even worse, when Tony Stark is Iron Man, Iron Man is broke and not working half of the time.

This is not a superhero movie, this is a action/adventure/comedy movie starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark with an occasional appearance as Iron Man. Downey is witty and funny as usual, which is what holds this movie together.

These movies, with the fallen superheroes, are all basically the same. The superhero finally comes back at the end to save the day. So no different here, at the very end, you get to see some Iron Man action.

Even with little Iron Man action, the movie is still pretty decent and worth a rental. Robert Downey Jr. gets 4 stars. As a superhero movie, a 2 star movie at best.",1380758400,,969,4.426966292134831

This movies storyline is very messy and all over the place. It has no real focus. The movie leaves you with more questions than answers. The origins of the bad guys are unanswered and are misleading. The entire movie is a quirky mess. However, just for the pure sake of entertainment it will fill your time very well. I thought this movie was too long; I just wanted it to end after the first hour, which seemed like 2hours because it was so dry. The real action occurs (in) the last 20 minutes of a 2 hour movie. All acting, sets, props, wardrobe, make-up, and effects were spot on. This was NOT the best Iron man movie...they really need to come up with a solid storyline for a Billionaire (man-child) and his flying super suit, with nothing better to do. I definitely will not be watching this movie again; it really was NOT that good, it was downright disappointing. This movie was pieces of strung together special effects, added here and there, but lacking a storyline to tie it all together. However, on a boring Friday night, it makes ideal entertainment.

I bought the disc expecting to be able to use all the special features that I had heard about. The JARVIS Second Screen is ONLY viewable by those with Iphones/Ipads.

5642131,4,B00BL1BJFW,"It seems Iron Man 3 received a lot of hate from fans and casual movie-goers alike, but from an objective standpoint: Yes, there were a lot of plot holes and the Iron Man suits kept falling apart whereas it was practically indestructible in the first 2 movies and in the Avengers movie. However, like Tony Stark repeatedly says throughout the movie, ""I am Iron Man"". The suits are just suits, the actual superhero is the person and this movie is about Tony Stark. With that in mind, it does develop his character more and introduces Extremis. It doesn't quite follow the comic books, and I am not sure if he is injected with Extremis at the end. I just know that I am more anxious to see the Avengers sequel and Iron Man 4.

Overall: 4/5 stars. If you liked the first 2 Iron Man movies and the Avengers, I highly recommend watching Iron Man 3. There's no AC/DC and Tony Stark is less stylish/flashy in this one, it is mainly about his vulnerabilities and how he overcomes it.",1380672000,,974,4.441340782122905

5642213,4,B00BL1BJFW,"What makes the Iron Man movies great is that it all ""looks"" so real and Exec Producer Jon Favreau (who directed the first two) keeps his hands on and does an excellent job making it all pretty believable as well. And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an ""iron"" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but can fly. There's a bit more cheese and silliness in Iron Man 3 than the first two, but it all still works well.

Who better to be in the role of the eccentric, wise-guy Tony Stark than Robert Downey, Jr.? Man, does he nail the role of Stark or what?! The rest of the cast, especially villain Guy Pearce, was terrific. Pearce does a great comic book-esque bad guy. Don Cheadle (Iron Patriot) and Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) add some nice flavor to this installment, but I gotta say, the less I see of them in an iron suit in any subsequent films the better.

Iron Man 3 picks up where&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marvel-s-The-Avengers/dp/B0099RFVXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marvel's The Avengers</a>&nbsp;left off and has Stark dealing with two issues: 1) Post traumatic stress disorder, and 2) A slighted scientist from his past. Oh, and a third issue is a terrorist called The Mandarin that ultimately twists beautifully into the film. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. The story is well-written and Shane Black in the director's chair keeps the viewer clamoring more of Marvel's series of Avengers related films over the next several years.

Iron Man 3 may not be the best in the Iron Man or Marvel Superhero franchise, but it's still a great movie. Worthy of an on demand viewing at minimum.",1380585600,,1703,4.90625

5642219,2,B00BL1BJFW,"First off, I don't think any superhero story ends up working well when the main problem is that the hero has lost his or her powers (or in this case the suit doesn't work properly).  We know the powers are eventually going to come back so there is no real drama/suspense.  In the meantime, we vicariously experience frustration (Why doesn't the suit work? Why didn't he stick with the old suit that worked?  Why didn't I just watch one of the previous better Iron Man movies?).

Next, most good guy - bad guy movies are only as good as the bad guy is interesting.  Robert Downey Jr. is  a little bit of both and is constantly interesting to watch (not so much here as the previous movies), but he still needs a worthy rival.  I did not even understand the bad guy's motivation.  He wants to ""have the monopoly on terrorism"" (something like that), but why?  Because Tony Stark left him waiting on a roof?  This is his big revenge motive?  Iron man 2 had a revenge motive (not the most interesting motive), but at least it was for a lifetime of being cast out and perceived theft of ideas (I get how that would make someone a little obsessive).  I think that here they had an idea for the special effect (translucent fire stuff with regenerative properties) and then went from there.

Robert Downey is so good in this role and the look of the movie is excellent as are its predecessors.  So you only need a decent story line to create a really good movie.  Here the story is abysmal and makes the new movie as dysfunctional as the new suit.",1380499200,2,1538,4.385159010600707

Taking a good set of characters and making them unwatchable - the producer/directors really messed up.  I hope it isn't, but it is very likely a portent of things to come.

I don't want to spoil it for folks who haven't watched it.  Let me just summarize:

Iron-man One - Tony Stark is introduced, and overcomes being jailed in a cave in Pakistan, ending with a great rendition of a Stan Lee superhero
Iron-man two - Tony gets to the root of his father issues, and we see what Hammer industries gets when they team up with a super-villain.
Iron-man three - Pepper Potts becomes a new super-hero by falling unprotected into lava.  Tony doesn't need to get off the couch - his remote control lets him handle 100 iron-man drones at a time while he sips margaritas.

Sometimes CGI can ruin a movie.  We liked the characters in the series - but they didn't deliver this time.  Just seeing 100 copies of the same suit-drone flying around shooting stuff isn't fun to watch.",1380499200,,1113,4.364077669902913

There are a good performances by Ben Kingsley who, as the Mandarin, is not exactly what he appears and (SPOILER!) Guy Pearce, who literally burns up the scenery as this movie's Arch-Villian.  The Rhodie character, played by Don Cheadle (I liked Terrance Howard MUCH better in this role) is just a toss away character in this movie.  They could have written him out all together and no one would have missed him.  The battle at the end was satisfactorily explosive, shedding light on just how Tony spent all those sleepless nights in his lab.

5642269,1,B00BL1BJFW,"I don't watch much TV.  Don't go to movie theaters.  Don't check too many reviews.  After a long week at work, and having to extend a stay at work through a Saturday I was excited to see this delivery when I got home.  Nothing else went right this week, but hey - I get to watch the new Iron Man release.  This movie ended up being like everything else this week - jacked up.

I've really liked the Iron Man series thus far and estimated this release would be good too.

This movie was so bad I'll never pre-order another movie again.  I'll wait and check on reviews, etc. before ordering.

I'll try to avoid any spoilers and not give too many examples to prove my point but this movie was horrible compared to the earlier releases.  I read some of the other reviews and everyone commented on how funny this was.  I guess I have a different sense of humor.  If I wanted funny, I'd buy a comedy flick.

Compared to the previous releases action was non-existent.  When it did come up due to the story line I didn't even care.  I kept waiting through the entire movie for something to interest me or draw me in.  Only thing to spark my interest was the end of the movie.  The story line seemed to focus on an almost ""I'm in a mid life crisis, whoa is me, does she love me"" event.  Great.  Deal with it.  Go blow something up.

I've called all my family/friends that really liked the entire series thus far.  Warned them this was a lemon and not to buy it or waste any time/money on it.  If they want to watch it, they can borrow or have my copy.  Something changed in this Iron Man release.  It's almost like someone wanted to generate the revenue from the movie but couldn't come up with a good idea at the time and released this garbage as a ""place holder"" until they come up with something better.

As far as picture, sound, etc. my 1 star rating doesn't reflect because of anything like that.  Movie looked great, sounds great.  1 star rating is just because it's a really lousy movie.

There may be some partial spoilers from this point on, so read on at your own will but I thought I better justify some of the above comments.

- Predictable.  I knew too early on who the bad guy was.  Great.  How many movies have had the ""picked on nerd guy"" come back to be the bad guy.  Snore.
- The ""supposed"" bad guy was a joke.  Give me a break.  See comment above.  It was obvious he was just some clown.
- The K-Mart Iron Man versions flying around were horrible.  They left the impression someone could knock one out with a BB gun or they would fall apart on their own.  Maybe Iron Man set up a factory in China to make these guys.  I'm sure if I could zoom in close enough the ""Iron Man"" clones would have a Made in China stamp somewhere.  Really, why didn't they make the main character tough enough to be the hero?  Most of the so called action was a bunch of tin can Iron Man clones flying around and getting blown up.
- With all the references to Iron Man in the Avengers movie one would think it would have brought Iron Man to toughen up.  Not so.  It's almost as if he took two steps back and created suites that should have shown up in the ""everyone else is years away from an Iron Man suit"" section of the last movie.  This movie is an insult to even mention the Avengers movie during the screen play.
- I can respect involving the Iron Man's personal relationships into a movie.  But in this case it was too much.  The movie didn't do enough to draw me in to that.  The entire time I watched this I couldn't help but think - this is a guy just feeling sorry for himself when really he has nothing to complain about.  Iron Man having to blow into a paper bag?  Give me a break.",1380412800,4,3682,4.167852062588905

The intro of A.I.M from the Marvel universe was also an interesting touch.  That said I've thought the Iron Man series has been kind of uneven; maybe due to no-one being able to effectively compete for screen time with Downey Jr. So the plots often come across as empty w/ no real conflict or character development.

5642289,4,B00BL1BJFW,"This movie follows up both on the previous stand alone Iron Man films, and show the ""post Avengers"" Tony Stark and the toll that the events of that movie had on him. There is a lot of misdirection in this movie, which even hinting about would give away too much. Some people hated the way that turned out, but I personally did not have much problem with it. Although the effect of the big twist did make the movie in a way similar (but not the same) as the plot in the second one.

This film definitely ratchets up the action. There are a lot more ""big"" action sequences in this movie, from Stark's house being blown up, to a mid air rescue, to the final battle. A lot is going on, and the effects are blended very well with live action shots so they look more ""real"" than in any of the other movies. The plot is somewhat convoluted and like I said above, has twists to it. Both the characters of Pepper and Rhodes have even more expanded roles in this movie. Robert Downey Jr continues to nail the Tony Stark role and mixes humor and intensity. Ben Kingsly is excellent in his role, he was very chilling as Mandarin, and is involved in one of the plot twists. There is also the usual after the credits scene involving a cameo by one of the Avengers.

As far as extras go, there is about an hour of material from making of/behind the scenes features, a short film that reveals events after the end of Captain America, a short look at the next Thor movie, and a gag reel. In all enough to make those who like the bonus material happy. Of course the movie looks and sounds great on blu ray for those who get the actual discs.

While an argument can be made that the superhero franchises are becoming over saturated, they do not seem to be slowing down over time. This movie definitely left open the possibility of further stand alone Iron Man movies, but also brought a sense of closure to the Tony Stark origin story.

There are references to the Avengers movie, so if you haven't seen it yet, you should watch that one, which is a very good movie.  I like it even more than this one.  If you can't or won't see Avengers before this one, don't worry - it will stand on its own - you'll just have to skip over the references.

Character role changes and life changes in this story make it interesting.",1380412800,4,654,4.371900826446281
5642312,5,B00BL1BJFW,Loved the movie. This had more drama then I was used to seeing from Tony Stark. Yes he loved Pepper Potts and showed it this time but I wanted more bad boy.,1380412800,,156,3.90625
5642313,4,B00BL1BJFW,"It even has fireworks!

This was a great conclusion to the trilogy after a fine first film and a shaky second film.  If you ever have an Iron Man party, though, you can get everyone psyched up with the first one and serve dinner, play volleyball or take a walk during the second one and then cuddle up on the sofa (cuz yeah it's kind of a geek date movie) for the third one.

Stick around for the scene after the credits that has become standard for Iron Man films.",1380412800,,465,4.144444444444445

5642318,1,B00BL1BJFW,"Even 3D could not save this Iron Man 3 movie.

The 3D itself was mediocre by today's standards.  They short-changed the great acting skills and experience of the Colonel (Don Cheadle). They pathetically overplayed Tony Stark's ability to fight out of the Iron Man suit as if he was a secret agent. The completely unnecessary emergence of Disney-based homosexual scenes (the technical guy's tattoo and love affair with Tony Stark in the trailer).  And Tony Stark's character was a bleeping Chatter Box who talked entirely too much.

Iron Man 3 died from suffocation from two HUGE Double-Ds as a result of Disney's (their owner) emerging and KISS-OF-DEATH influence on Marvel. As typical of Disney's productions, those Huge Double-D's did not come from a woman, but a man:  Disney gave Robert Downey Jr. too much input in DIALOGUE and DIRECTING.

Marvel's ultimate Kiss-of-Death will be Disney.

5642355,5,B00BL1BJFW,"First, a little background: I thought Iron Man 1 was pretty good and 2 wasn't bad but certainly wasn't the 1st.

Iron Man 3 is a great guilty pleasure movie! It isn't Shakespeare, there are plot holes and places you can knit-pick, but it is a great action flick with more toys than a Toys R Us. And Robert Downey Jr pulls of the Tony Stark character perfectly. And Guy Pierce plays a very good villain roll.

Seeing the number of movies that have bombed on their 3rd run (Home Alone, Batman, etc), it is nice that the Iron Man series was able to finish with what I thought was a quality movie.",1380326400,,593,4.238938053097345

5642359,3,B00BL1BJFW,I like the more in-depth story of Tony Stark coping with his ordeal from the Avengers. Just like his alcoholism in the comics. What makes him Iron Man is his inner strength. Some have commented that this show of weakness in this 3rd movie is out of character but I disagree. I do however believe the biggest mistake of this movie is the Mandarin's role in the movie which is a complete mistake. He is one of Tony's archenemies in the comics and is reduced to a joke.,1380326400,,466,4.306818181818182
5642360,4,B00BL1BJFW,"I expect Tony Stark to be a smart mouthed and brilliant scientist and an entrepreneur surrounded by an invincible armor of his Iron Man creation. In this film Stark is a broken man that has lost his way in life and doesn't really know what his future holds and he is on the verge of a metal breakdown. Only when the things he values most in his life are threatened with destruction does he really react the way Tony Stark would behave but without his technological weapons and advantages, how will he survive and win...

This movie to me is a dramatic change from the traditional Iron Man theme and I don't like it as well as the other films in the series. The action is good but no one likes seeing their idol crushed and taken down the way the role of Tony Stark (Iron Man) is played in this film. For me this film was a 3.5 to a 4 star rating. It had so much more potential than that. In addition it leaves you hanging at the end with a plot that can go either way.

This film at times was dark and more depressing because of Tony's depression and panic attacks. For me I look forward to the old Tony Stark and the Iron Man who crushes the bad guys. Call me old fashion call me crazy but my superhero had better kick some bad guys around with attitude. This film was at best a four star rating and that is a little kind.",1380326400,,1323,4.124031007751938

Then they had to add an annoying damn kid in the mix, and that scene, that was reaching for comedy, with the ""mandarin"" was so painful. Tony Stark was iron man for 10 minutes or so of screen time. I love that all these people, pepper, villains, can just jump right into the suits and fly, fight, launch weapons, all with no learning curve.

The current price for any version/format of Iron Man 3 is outside my break-point and I don't understand why Amazon is not more competitive. Similar newer releases and pre-orders such as The Wolverine, World War Z, Man of Steel, Star Trek: Into Darkness, Pacific Rim, etc. are all offered for much less and I consider the price point for this title to be unrealistic in comparison. At $31.99 for the 3D Combo-Pak it's too much for me but I will happily purchase it at Walmart for $24.96 ($21.96 after the Disney Movie Rewards coupon)!",1380326400,,621,4.706422018348624

This movie is a steaming pile.

The writing is terrible. So many loose plot points and character development.
This is almost not worth 2 stars. I can't get past how bad this movie is. It's as if they spent 200million in special effects and put it on a script that was only 10 pages long.

Another comment claimed that the Blu Ray version for ten dollars more does allow an itunes download so you are PAYING for download options - it's not a free thing.

Okay, I chose amazon instant video because I am a big fan of Amazon and the name Vudu scares me because it reminds me of the World of Warcraft trolls.  It works of course on the Amazon website, doesn't let me download to the pc that I can tell, plays on Roku if I close out the website on the laptop BUT even if it plays nowhere else, it will not play on the iPhone despite the Amazon Instant Video app which is the reason I was willing to choose Amazon over Vudu.

The message on the iphone is:

Unlike most sequels, this franchise gets better with each subsequent film. This one is more fun than the first two. I think since you know all the characters and the world the film has created, they felt they could add more levity this time to the story. Yes Tony still spouts zingers the whole time, Pepper has come into her own and their romance is quirky and cute. The music is all rock and roll, just like the character, and the effects are great, even if a bit unbelievable.

5642440,1,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man 3 is a terrible film that lacks everything that made the first film so amazing. The villain's motivations are an exact duplicate of the Riddler's from the terrible Batman Forever film. In this film the main villain is heartbroken because Tony Stark stood him up for a date and didn't reciprocate his homosexual feelings. It makes very little sense why someone who barely knew Tony would be so hurt by him as to plot for nearly a decade to get his revenge. The failure here is the same as Mickey Rourke's villainous role in Iron Man 2; very little character development as to why they are so motivated to destroy Tony. i understand that Guy Pearce's character is upset because Tony is not homosexual but there has to be more as to why he would want to kill him. Another thing that was terrible was the little kid as a side kick, that was too cliche for me. the best part of the film is when they put tony's fat butler in a colma (his best contribution to the trilogy by far) and when i thought stupid Pepper Potts had died. I was so overwhelmed with joy i stood up out my seat full of happiness seeing stupid Pepper fall into the inferno...only to see her come back from the dead as phoenix from X-Men. Also the plot twist involving the Mandarin was stupid as they get. The whole time you think the guy is a super terrorist and he just turns out to be ""the Dude"" from the Big Lebowski film. Also the fact that the film makers had to change the Mandarin's character because of political correctness is just pathetic. Anyone that perceives the original comic book character as racist is just a sissified over sensitive dim witted wimp. It just comes across as utterly absurd...I mean really, a cowboy Texan sounding Asian Terrorist called the Mandarin?! Hollywood liberals and their lame and cowardly political correctness ruined the character. This film is complete and utter garbage.",1380153600,2,1891,4.564705882352941

5642445,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Put simply, Iron Man 3 is like a roller-coaster ride - the kind that makes you vomit. Not because all the material it presents is essentially puke-worthy, but because it hurtles through all that material way, way too fast. It whooshes its audience along at breakneck speed, slowing as it climbs a hill just long enough for us to ask ""How the heck did we get here?"", then plummeting down the other side before we can arrive at any answer to the question.

The Mandarin. Killian. Tony's wormhole-related PTSD. Pepper. Extremis. After spending two-plus hours watching this movie, I felt like each of those subplots had flashed across the screen for about five seconds. And, taking a breather to analyze how they were used, I found myself decidedly unimpressed. I'm not exactly an avid reader of Iron Man comics, but I can see from some simple Wikipedia research that all these concepts lost quite a bit in translation - Extremis in particular. No longer a complex and intriguing method of producing super-soldiers, it now seems to only be capable of turning people into glowing lava monsters. The brief and boring explanation of how it works is an insult to viewers' intelligence. So are a lot of other things about the film - the final resolution in particular. Deus ex machina, anyone?

I won't spoil the major twists here, though I wouldn't be robbing you of any great dramatic highs if I did. My main advice regarding this movie is rent, don't buy. There are some character moments and blips of humor that make it watchable. You may like it better than I did, but definitely don't expect anything along the lines of the first Iron Man, or even anything much better than the second.

(Of course, if you want the DVD for the Agent Carter one-shot, that's a different story. I've heard it's excellent, though it didn't come with my digital rental, so I haven't seen it myself yet. If and when I do, I'll update this review with info on it.)",1380067200,5,1938,4.6608187134502925

5642447,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man 3 is the first installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 2 (Post Avengers. Personally, I think they are off to a strong start. Iron Man 3 is a highly entertaining move and a major improvement to the previous Iron Man installment. The story is competent and engaging, the characters are well developed, the action will get your blood pumping, and the villains are also good, for the most part. There are problems, that bring the movie down for me slightly though. Most of the problems are nitpicks, but one might be a major turn-off for viewers. In my opinion, Iron Man 3 is vastly superior to Iron Man 2, but not quite as good as the first Iron Man.

The story is quite interesting and executed much more competently then in Iron Man 2. The story deals with demons from Tony's past come back to bite him in the present. Tony is also plagued by panic attacks from the fight in New York in Avengers. Tony must find a way to defeat his demons before they hurt those he cares for. Unlike Iron man 2 I actually felt Tony's plight, and the big threat is actually legitimate. The story was quite good, though I personally prefer the story too the first Iron Man more. The main characters are the same as the first two films. Tony is back and has a new dilemma he has to face. Unlike the second film, I actually felt for Tony. Tony came off as too arrogant in the second film and made so many stupid decisions that I found myself kind of not liking him until the end. In this film, while still arrogant, I find Tony much more sympathetic and he is actually being smart in this film.

Pepper's character, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is more in line with what she was in the first Iron Man, which is a good thing. In Iron Man 2 all she did was nag Tony. In this she is much less annoying, and actually serves the plot. She even helps Tony in the end like in the first film.

Rhodey, played again by Don Cheadle is also better in this film. He has much more to do in this film then in the previous films, which is a plus. Though, I wish Rhodey had more time in the suit doing things. The rest of the cast did a fine job for the most part.

The villains very good and quite refreshing! Unlike Iron Man 2 the villains, for the most part, can be taken seriously. Plus the villains feel like an actual threat, not a minor inconvenience like the villains in Iron Man 2. Plus it is refreshing that the big threat at the end is not another version of the Iron Man technology.

The effects are great as always. The humor is a ton better this time around. The action is one of this movie's strongest points. One thing I did not like about the previous two films is that the action scenes. The action was too short and anticlimactic, especially the final battle. However, in this movie, the action is very ramp up. The final battle is actually satisfying. The film does have a couple problems that do bring it down a little for me. Firstly, the middle was a bit slow passed. The moments with the kid I did not care for that much. The big issue for me is a twist that comes half way through the film. This twist might piss lots of people off. When I learned of the big twist, even I was like: ""What..really?"" The twist did not ruin the film for me, but it might for some people, particularly fans of the Iron Man comic.

Overall this is a great addition to the Iron Man franchise. It definitely makes up for Iron Man 2. I highly recommend this!",1380067200,3,3439,4.250764525993884

5642451,5,B00BL1BJFW,"This movie was fabulous, plain and simple. And one of the interesting things about it is that it just shows you how much it means to be a ""movie star.""

I had just watched the Emmys a couple of days ago, and then watched this. There may be few people with less charisma than Neil Patrick Harris, but in this politically correct age, even without charisma, they let him host the Emmys. That said, watching Iron Man 3 shows you just what a movie star is, namely Robert Downey Jr.  Since I had just watched the Emmys, it really started the neurons burning about how great it is to watch a movie star do what movie stars do. Maybe next years the Emmys will get a movie star to host them so they can be interesting.

Back to the movie, a couple of reviews say, ""misdirection,"" well yah sure, but it isn't cheating misdirection where they come out of left field and you feel cheated. It is ""complicating the plot,"" as one needs to do to have a complete story. One might also note that Don Cheadle was great and there wasn't any of that ""oh we were slaves"" that seems to be so popular today. Seriously, it would be nice if that could be packed away. Don Cheadle didn't seem to speak ""black English,"" was crisp and good-looking, macho, and overall great. Compare that to the whining Oprah in The Butler? Who doesn't want to be around Don Cheadle so shall we talk racism or shall we talk what kind of person we want to be around...

What I really liked about it, if memory is correct, is that even though this is a Shane Black movie, I didn't hear the ""f-word"" even one time. If that isn't a cause for celebration what is? And Gwenyth Paltrow? Well let's celebrate having a woman as the female lead who doesn't have altered breasts.

The story looked like it was going to be a winner and I liked where it was going.  Then it fell on it's face.  First and foremost, I was rather upset over the lack of Iron Man being in his own film.  What you get is scene after scene of Tony Stark running around playing a high tech James Bond.  No no no.  I paid money to see Iron Man, not his alter ego.  The title of the movie is Iron Man 3, not Tony Stark 3. I don't know if it's the fact that the producers felt the need to show Downey Jr's face over and over, or if they didn't want to spend too much money on special effects.  I don't get it.  Without the suit, it's just another movie.
  The next thing I had a problem with is the old tired worn out cliche of the wise cracking 12 year old kid who bails out the hero.  OMG, nothing kills drama in a film better than this stupid plot device.  Why was this needed?  How many great hero films have you seen that has a annoying kid rescuing the hero?  Batman Begins?  X2?  Iron Man I?  Nope, can't think of one.  I can think of plenty of garbage films that do though.
  The third thing that was a disaster for the film was what they did with the Mandarin.  I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it, but I cannot figure out why they would do this with that character.  It was incredibly stupid and made no sense.  Was it for humor sake.  If so, it was a huge FAIL.

5642457,4,B00BL1BJFW,"First off this movie only garnered a 4 star rating with me due to the Blu-Ray Special Features. Iron Man 3 for me was lacking in what made Iron Man, Iron Man. I will say however I do get WHY they decided to go this route with the movie, however I think it was a little over done and lacking in certain areas.

Pros:
-I LOVED the visuals in this movie. Some of the best I've ever seen.
-I liked the different twists this movie had to offer.
-I wasn't that big on comics, I watch a movie for entertainment value and AT the theaters I liked the Mandarin Twist.
-RDJ does his best Tony Stark yet, and the cast was a really good fit.

Cons:
-NO point for having war mach...I mean Iron Patriot in this movie except to use him as a plot device. WHY give him a big shoulder canon if he isn't going to use it.
-Not enough Tech. I know Stark is mentally broken after the events in NY so I DO understand his suite will have glitches as well as his home security (which by the way that scene was just phenomenal), but I mean ALL of his gadgets break?
-After re-watching the movie I saw that that the mandarin plot was dragged on for TOO long until the twist. They should have found a better way to deal with it. Mandarin was set up to be the biggest threat Tony ever faced yet they just used him as a gimmick for a guy that has a grudge against him?
-There is ONE deleted scene that should have made it to the final product and they dropped the ball on it. It was the scene with the kid and his bullies. THAT scene would have added so much more depth, character, and relationship to Tony and The Kid.

Overall I bought it to complete the trilogy and I give it a solid 7.9-8.1 just because the Blu-Ray features made it a must own.",1380067200,,1717,4.058997050147493

I was reading Iron Man comic books twenty years ago, so i'm thrilled that not only have the movies been made, but that they've been successful. But this one, for all it's entertainment value, was a misfire.

Its not Robert Downey Jr.'s fault at all - he has not phoned in his performance (so far) in any Marvel movie. But Iron Man is supposed to be rooted in something resembling reality. He fought comic book villains in his first two movies, but they were human beings that advanced the technology that Tony Stark created and used it against him. The first two movies were also about mortality, and doing something good with your life with the time you have.

This movie begins with the promise of incredibly real reality: a human terrorist. Suddenly, we have a villian who is not superpowered, but very very real. No more Iron Man vs other guys in Iron suits. The movie was about to go in an amazingly brave direction: Tony wouldn't be able to shoot this villian with repulsor rays to defeat him. He'd have to outthink him. What promise! But alas...

We get Iron Man vs. Lava Monsters. Silly and absurd. Yes...Iron Man battled with aliens in The Avengers (a fact that i was not thrilled about when i first learned about it, but the movie was so good i just learned to accept it). Yes, i know, they are actually Extremis-enhanced super soldiers who healed from their injuries using genetic abilities powered through superheated inner-core body temperatures.

It was a disappointing direction. For what it was, it was fine. But easily the weakest installment in this Marvel Cinematic Universe. Edward Norton's ""The Incredible Hulk"" is exceptional by comparison.

Oh well. I have to own it to make it a complete collection of movies. It's very rare that a superhero movie be sooo bad (Spider Man 3, Man of Steel) that i'd never watch it again...let alone own it. This one i'd watch, if just to enjoy the 3D.",1379980800,3,2014,4.646067415730337

That being said; this movie was quite a let down.
The high tech that we all loved about the suit in the previous movies has gotten out of hand. They actually have the different parts of the suit having their own rockets and targeting system that can find Tony anywhere. Little parts, like the face plate alone, has rockets and tracking that can fly across the continent and find Tony anywhere. Even to me this was purely unbelievable.
Tony is suffering from PTSD. The whole movie we see several iron man suits but Tony isn't in them. They've become drones that are controlled by Jarvis. All the action we see from Tony is out of the suit.
I suppose the effort was to make us see and like Tony as just one of us normals. There is a tiny bit of success there when he interacts with the kid, but it falls short.
We don't go see Iron Man movies for warm and cozy normalcy. It's high tech adventure we  have come to expect and want from this series and we just don't believably get it in this movie.

5642477,3,B00BL1BJFW,"NOTE: There are minor spoilers in this review, but nothing that would deter from your overall enjoyment of the film.

While I enjoyed this movie and had a fun time, I think ""Iron Man 3"" is the weakest of the Iron Man trilogy. That's not to say it's a bad film, it just means that I liked the previous two Iron Man films better than this one. I should state that while I've become a big fan of Marvel movies, I was never a big reader of comic books - so my feelings toward the film are more about it's merits/flaws as a movie experience (rather than how true it is to the comics).

I think about how far we've come since the first ""Iron Man"" (and it's not in a particularly good direction). That film was refreshing because it played everything totally realistically - everything was tech-based, there was nothing supernatural. And now, in the third film of the series, we've moved on to Extremis (which is by far the most un-realistic concept in any of the three films). Now I'm not against fantasy movies, but up until now I've considered ""Iron Man"" to be one of the more grounded superhero franchises - and I liked it that way.

Also, it seems the new mandate from Marvel is to tie their movies together as much as possible, which is fine but it also puts a strain on the individual story being told. This film seemed to draw less on the previous ""Iron Man"" movies and instead focus on the fallout from ""The Avengers"". I understand why the events in that film, notably the battle in New York, would affect Stark emotionally. But that whole storyline feels unnecessary in ""Iron Man 3"", and Tony's random panic attacks seem very out of place (and don't mesh tonally with the rest of the film).

PROS:
- As always with the Iron Man films, the crowd-pleasers - the action sequences and the moments of humor - were very well-done.
- Brian Tyler's score was fantastic, particularly the main theme for ""Iron Man 3"".

CONS:
- Although I love the song ""Blue"" that opened this movie, I really missed AC/DC's music. It just seems odd to not have AC/DC in an Iron Man movie (it fit so well).
- To me, Tony's panic attacks felt out of place.
- As someone who likes a certain level of realism in movies, the concept of Extremis (and in particular fire-breathing) was another step in the wrong direction.
- I just wasn't a fan of the Mandarin's character arc. It was a valid choice the filmmakers made, but it just didn't play well for me.",1379980800,12,2426,4.40625

Not only does it work well with the first 2 Iron Man movies, but the big pay off is how the story continues after the Avengers movie.  Robert Downey Jr. is the only actor for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man.  His acting skill really show when he has the rely on his wits and skill and not the Iron Man suit.  The writing is outstanding for the over all story line and all the characters development within the story.  The work and money put in the making of the movie shows on the screen.  Robert Downey Jr. heads a great cast of actors that look like they are having a great time working on the project.  My 8 year old son and I sat down and watched the other Marvel super hero movies, Thor, Captain America, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 1 and 2, and The Avengers.

The way they made the War Machine into the Iron Patriot was pointless, and why even have him in the movie when he does basically nothing but get captured? They should've called this ""Fiberglass Man 3"" due to how the suits that could handle so much damage, even getting whacked by Thor's hammer, fell apart so easily is stupid. My thought also is how can he still be Iron Man and power the suits if the power source for them is gone, thanks to having his ""mini-arc reactor"" taken out and throwing it in the ocean?",1379894400,,639,4.245901639344262
5642501,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Remember how refreshing the first IRON MAN was?  It was fun, witty, fast-paced, with solid acting and an undeniably charismatic lead in Robert Downey Jr.  Then we got all hopped up for IRON MAN 2, and we were...underwhelmed.  In fact, to this day, only two things about the sequel stick with me: the absence of Terrence Howard, and that amazing scene between Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke in the prison cell, where you leave two great actors alone in a room together and see what happens.  Everything else is a mediocre, ""oh what might have been"" blur.

IRON MAN 3 walks the line between those two films, not as great as the first, not as utterly forgettable as the second.  It's plot is pretty great on the surface: a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is targeting America, using technology so advanced that no one can put their hands on it.  Enter Tony Stark (Downey Jr.), aka Iron Man, aka ""don't mess with my friends.""  Well, the Mandarin does just that, and suddenly Tony finds himself in a (somewhat) morally complex spiral through terrorism, bureaucracy, and good old fashioned revenge.

The film, from director Shane Black (who directed Downey in the grossly underrated KISS KISS BANG BANG), takes a few interesting twists and turns.  This will probably have fanboys wringing their fists (and pounding their keyboards) in frustration.  In part, they're right to do so; the film, like the second, wastes a lot of its potential with a third-act twist that (let's face it) is rather predictable.  BUT, unlike the second film, it at least tries to do something else.  I won't say what, but it's nice to see a blockbuster shy away from conventional expectations.  That being said...it IS still a letdown, albeit one boasted by some great performances (Kingsley in particular, but Guy Pearce has a few good moments as well, and James Badge Dale has some nice scenes).  Rebecca Hall gets little to do, but she does it well; same with returning stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, and Jon Favreau.

Ultimately, how you feel about IRON MAN 3 will come down to your expectations going into it.  If you keep your expectations realistic (remember: IRON MAN 2), then you may be pleasantly surprised...unless you're fiercely loyal to the source material, in which case you're gonna be disappointed.  IRON MAN 3 isn't the film it could have been, but that's actually a two-way street: it could have been better, but could have been much worse.  Take that for what you will, but at least it's another chance for Robert Downey Jr. to quip some one-liners and give the cameras a mischievous glare.",1379894400,2,2599,4.8

He has become more obsessed with his work and by throwing everything he has into it he thinks he won't have to deal with those events. After a terrorist attack effects one of his closest friends he goes one step further and tells the man behind the attacks to ""bring it on."" That off the cuff remark changes everything and effects everyone around him. I have never been a huge comic book movie fan. My main reason is because they are mainly nothing but how many explosions can we have. The Iron Man movies started a change where the acting and story become front and center. While the other Iron Man's were fun and comical this one was more dark and interesting. It is hard to make a movie like this realistic. The fact that they made this movie about terrorism really helped root the movie in reality even with all the comic book elements going on. There are a lot of little things in this I did have problems with but for the most part I was very entertained and that is what is important in a movie. Also just as a heads up you do need to watch both Iron Man and The Avengers movie in order to get everything that is going on.

In this film it's not just Tony Stark who's been tinkering, he's up against someone who has been conducting his own experiments. The principal bad guy is terrorist seemingly with the ability to strike anywhere, including Stark's home when he brashly issues a challenge on live TV.

Stark shows a bit more of a human side in this film, revealing a few flaws, nothing too dramatic, but it just adds another dimension to the film. As with the previous films Stark is the star of the show, he's funny, but nothing we haven't seen before.

Growing up I always wondered if technology would develop to the point to realistically bring IRON MAN to the big screen.

Well computers and CGI has technologically made it possible ---- BUT ---- unfortunately that is about all that can be said for the IRON MAN movies.

Impressive Computer and CGI skills ........ but weak stories, changing Tony Stark's character too much, and bad campy humor.

The first half of the first Iron Man movie was ok, but then it collapsed to a predictable plot formula that Marvel used on all their hero films that year.

Then IRON MAN 2 came out.
Ughhh ......... we won't say anymore about that one.

NOW we have Iron Man 3.
The Disney stamp is all over this movie.
Especially with the kid who helps Tony Stark ------------ cheesy --------- classic Disney thing all the way.

This is NOT IRON MAN !!

yeah the CGI is impressive and I am sure that many long hard hours of work went into making this movie, but the result is a major dissapointment

Special Effects alone DO NOT carry a movie.
OR maybe I am wrong and modern audiences only care about flashy eye candy and no substance.

And they pay Downey $50 million per film for this ?
Tony Stark was not a smart mouthed comical wisecracking comedian --- he was a tragic character.

Downey should say his thanks every day of his life for being blessed to be so overpaid for so little actual work.

In the average Iron Man movie, Downey has less than 20 minutes of screen time
Reports are he works on site for 6 weeks making these films

So $50 million for 6 weeks of work ?

5642524,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Its gotten so tough to figure out where Robert Downey ends and Tony Stark begins, I'll bet there are days that he can't figure it out, either. And, that's great news for fans of great adventure movies; because he is THE rock star of movie superheros.

After the bloated self-importance of 'Iron Man 2', this third tale puts Mr. Stark exactly where we want him: in the most serious trouble; and, with nothing but his intellect, ego and eloquence to bail him out. Borrowing from the classic 'Extremis' comic-book arc, IM3 has Stark running from the nightmares he experienced in 'The Avengers', and discovering that old Buckaroo Banzai was right: ""...no matter where you go, there you are."" This angst and and resulting burnout stresses the relationship between Stark and gal-pal Pepper Potts; and, in ways that will prove vital to the film's denouement. Gwyneth Paltrow continues to deftly blend Pott's quicksilver emotions towards her naughty-boy, Supersqueeze: exasperation, elation, devotion and the clear desire to take a maternal wooden spoon to his backside. She is more than his match.

Guy Pierce, in yet another 2013 movie performance, proves to be a villain of charm, hubris and intellect who provides a very dark reflection for Stark to contemplate. In addition, the genesis of this new tale ties up elements going back to the first Iron Man movie; and, proves that our actions always catch up with us.

Sound a little deep for a superhero flick? Not to worry. The cast and director massage it all in such a way, that it keeps your brain engaged, while providing the visual and auditory assaults we all demand of such movies.

There is some well-managed humor from (former Iron Man director) John Favreau as bodyguard/factotum Happy Hogan; and, a kid 'sidekick' for Stark who manages to act like a kid, without becoming an obnoxious jerk (yeah, Short-Round...I'm talkin' to you).
Don Cheadle returns as ""Rhodie""/War Machine/ Iron Patriot; and, there is a lot of fun watching this intense actor/character being mercilessly teased by his buddy.

The story is suitably sinister, and Pierce's minions are as hiss-able as anyone could ask. A rollicking score, crystal cinematography and tight editing wrap this excellent cine-present up in a tidy bow.

Oh, about those extras...
Start with 'Agent Carter', a short movie (""Marvel One-Shot"") about Captain America's secret-agent sweetheart. It takes place a year after the end of 'Cap', and puts our Miss Carter at odds with evil spies and FBI male chauvinists, too (gasp!). An absolute little gem.

In addition, there is a generous selection of the usual 'making-of' clips and outtakes. However, what I really got a kick out of were some clips of Downey vamping through scenes, at a mile-a-minute, until he gets the version that 'clicks' for him (and, ended up in the theatrical release).

Top to bottom, this is 3 hours of soaring, solid action entertainment.
That's it...I'm off the bloody soapbox!

5642541,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Fan of the Lethal Weapon series (particularly 1 and 2)?  More importantly, did you see and enjoy Kiss-Kiss, Bang-Bang starring Marvel Poster-boy Downey?  Perhaps you would enjoy it more than you would if you were looking for something more akin to what we just came off of in the Avengers and previous Iron Man iterations.  The third in this character franchise is stands a bit clearer away from its two previous flicks.  It is very much a Shane Black story--a Christmas story with&nbsp;]] corrupt politicians and CEOs.  True, the latter was very central to the previous movies, but for Black its a particularly favored character-villain.  Then, too, we have the actual story delivery:  it is being told to us.

That's why it is more a spiritual successor to Kiss-Kiss.  It has the similar background characters.  Drug users, alcoholics, and everyone's armed to the teeth in repartee.  It's during Christmas.  Simple as that, Christmas is his preferred backdrop.  And it's a detective story.  We have Iron Man's CSI and a few sequences where he's investigating and picking up leads.  That's more fun than you would expect, but it's quite different than what most people wanted.  As a fan of Black's storytelling, this would be right up  your alley.  It worked for me.

This movie might lack in Iron Man flying about. A super hero movie without the superhero's trademark armor in flight and on display?  Yet it is still an Iron Man story (""I am Iron Man,"" after all; but as an interesting aside, the original line was going to read ""I am Tony Stark"" as if to say these Stark/Iron Man movies are indeed about the personality more than they are about the suit).  You get what you got in the first two.  Tony is center-stage and fun as hell when he's gabbing on about anything.  The action sequences in the flick are satisfying too even without the suit.

Now, the big issue is in the Mandarin and the confusion around him.  For comic fans, this was obviously a huge disappointment.  They wanted their Kingsley to be the Mandarin and they wanted their martial arts expert with Super Science rings.  That was nowhere near what they got, but when you finally finish up the movie, can it not be said that the Mandarin was a presence and was an individual?  True, he winds up without any of the notable powers in the comics, but the villain remains a powerful combatant anyway.

All in all, that part is up to everyone as is everything I appreciated in the film.  I do think this was a good movie and superior to the second.

I feel it would have been a much better movie if they had kept him as the actual villain. Not only that, I'm pretty sure there is an actual Marvel comics villain named the Mandarin, who was either Chinese, Middle-eastern or something like that. So that was curve ball that I didn't particularly like.

All three movies lack a spectacular finish, but ""Iron Man 3"" dares to not repeat the formula of the first two: metal on metal mayhem. IM3 explores the relationship between a man and his life priorities as he matures (somewhat late). In the comic books, the hero almost always chooses duty over love. In this movie, as in real life, things are not so simple.

As for the Mandarin, you cannot in 2013 bring that character to the silver screen as is. Sorry, that is just how things are now. This isn't a Jess Franco/Christopher Lee movie from the 1970s. I thought it was handled as best it could. I did not feel the impact of the other adversaries in the movie, maybe that was more effective in the comic book storyline.

5642581,1,B00BL1BJFW,"For years Iron Man has been my favorite solo superhero. I've read the old comics, and I watched the animated series when I was little. I loved everything, the character, the villains, the concept, everything. Fast forward a few years to the first movie. It remains one of my favorite movies. So when I heard about the second movie, I got excited. Like many fans, I was disappointed to say the least. Everything went wrong. So now, with as few spoilers as possible, I'm going to tell you why the third is just as bad, if not worse.
I started hearing about the third one just like everyone else. When I saw the previews, I thought they would redeem themselves.  All the signs pointed to it. And since it came out on my birthday, my girlfriend decided to take me out to it(quick note, she's an even bigger Iron Man/RDJ fan than me). It was a waste of money. I'm not expecting some artsy thing, it's an action movie. But this didn't even have a solid premise. The Mandarin has always been my favorite villain, but he DOESN'T EVEN HAVE POWERS. THEY GOT RID OF HIS MAGIC RINGS. And if you do go through the ordeal of watching it, you'll see that isn't the only thing they mess up about one of Marvel's finest villains.
Also though, there is so many plot gimmicks. I think the writers were on a time crunch and just had to go with whatever stupid crap they could think of to keep the story in motion. Nothing in it seemed genuine. They wanted to do too much with it.

I would have gotten my money back had I paid for the movie. Pretty much a total disappointment. no surprises or guest stars and the villain was really the melter?
The movie was an over CGId broken sentence speaking mean spirited travesty.
I was so completely underwhelmed by the super skitty post end credit scene that I stumbled into the new star trek into darkness show, which I never planned on watching, and ended up rather enjoying it. Granted star trek was a sad rehash of the older movies, yet it towered over the feeble IM3. And seeing ST free in theaters saved me $1.35 in rental fees.

So back to the reviews. The less stars a movie is rated, the more ignorant and sarcastic the review. Most people do not understand that a movie is not an exact visual dramatization of your treasured comic book. Comics have their place. Movies are a retelling with added fluff and certain license to create new thoughts, emotions, flaws, and each actor/ actress brings their own to the part. So... my advice, which to you one stars would be worthless, is quit screaming at your television trying to influence your quarterback to pass instead of handing the ball off for a loss of yardage. Instead of coaching from your couch, let them tell you the story they want, not what you had planned out in your head or wished would happen. You cant control life fully. Some things just happen. Tony's story just happened.

5642622,4,B00BL1BJFW,"The Movie (4/5)

Let me start by saying I love the concepts thrown into this movie.  The plot has a few flaws, but overall, it is the best Iron Man story out of all the Iron Man live action movies.  That said, it takes a page out of the Extremis comic story.  It is far from original.  It features a lot of old Iron Man elements we already saw in the Extremis motion comic (which is free on Amazon Prime Instant Video).  I honestly love the Extremis concept, but that is such a small portion of this movie's plot.  The story centers on Tony Stark's inner turmoil after the alien attack of the Marvel Avengers movie.

The characters showed potential for some great backstory moments, but the writing simply did not offer much in terms of backstory, and characters simply did not get flushed out completely.  I think the Mandarin character could have been done in a way closer to the comic character.  I did not appreciate how Mandarin turned out.  Thankfully, the Extremis plot worked out fairly well.  The ending, however, left me wanting more, scratching my head about what happens next.  The writing was simply scattered and felt unfinished.

Bonus Features (2/5)

The bonus features are terrible for the price.  I would rather they give us the bonus features as separate videos.  Instead, they are formatted as part of the movie, which reminds me of why I don't like VHS tapes.  In this day and age, we should have better organization of features.  Menus have been around since DVD movies, and it is easier to make a menu system for the web, so I feel that they have no valid excuse to not give us properly formatted bonus features.  You could get the movie from Vudu instead and get the bonus features as separate videos.  I wish I did that instead of relying on Amazon Instant Video.

The lack of organization aside, the bonus features were somewhat boring.  There was a making-of video that took up maybe 20-30 minutes right after the feature film, and there were bloopers for about 4-5 minutes at the very end of the video.  Between those features, there were some deleted scenes and a Captain America prequel short.  The short was actually pretty good, but it wasn't anything memorable.  The deleted scenes were deleted for a reason, but some of them made nice bloopers in my opinion.

Overall, I think Amazon screwed up the formatting of the bonus features, and that is probably the biggest flaw with them.  However, I do not think the bonus features add enough to the movie to make it worth paying extra for.  Save money by buying the movie by itself if you have that option.",1378684800,2,2585,4.58296943231441

5642628,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man 3 is not an Iron Man movie. It's a Robert Downey Junior movie. Don't get me wrong, RDJ is a great actor and I love what he does with the Tony Stark character but there's this implication in the film that he doesn't need the suit to be considered a superhero. I get what they are trying to sell but the movie makes the suit (or suits) appear to be fragile and worthless.

This movie's take on the Mandarin character has no respect for the comic book character. I'm not a comic book purist and I generally approve when movie studios take liberties with characters to make them more believable (Spiderman's Green Goblin for example) or relevant, but they completely trash a character for their own purposes.

Hollywood blew it with this movie. They've been given some creative freedom by fans but here they took it too far. It's as if they don't like comic book characters so they are trying to just use them as a vehicle to show us what they consider is art.

This is good action/suspense movie but a terrible comic book movie. RDJ is a great actor but through most of the film I was waiting for him to just shut up and get in the suit.",1378598400,2,1143,4.331775700934579
5642629,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Bringing comic book adaptations to life on screen seems to be a difficult balance for anyone that's not Marvel it would seem. Could they do it again here? The answer to that is a resounding YES! Other studios and some directors think that translating content which is mostly successful on paper through to a live action takes some extra clever handling or major changes. Marvel knows that nothing could be farther from the truth. Trust the material for the most part and the movie will blossom. Sure, Marvel can change and adapt within their own universe when the need arises. The Mandarin in this very film is the perfect example of change done right. Mandarin needed more than a tweak to work on film and what they crafted here was brilliant. Thankfully, director Shane Black and Marvel worked well together because the team up resulted in a film true to Marvel's heritage but also something new and fresh.

Iron Man 3 is a fun big-screen blockbuster with heart but also brains. It's smart and benefits from an amazing screenplay. It wonderfully blends experienced, award winning actors with a balanced mix of story and action. The comedy works so well on many levels. There's the ""hit you over the head"" type humor and then there's the drier, sarcastic comedy that Robert Downey was born to deliver. Everything meshes here for one of the better film going experiences of the year.",1378598400,,1383,4.7866108786610875

To me a good movie takes you on an adventure without having a moment where you can't possibly suspend your disbelief enough to just experience it. I don't think this one ever pushes too far, while still being exhilarating through great action and consistent plot. I say just sit back and let the roller coaster go.",1378512000,,583,4.12280701754386
5642631,3,B00BL1BJFW,"NOTE: There are minor spoilers in this review, but nothing that would deter from your overall enjoyment of the film.

While I enjoyed this movie and had a fun time, I think ""Iron Man 3"" is the weakest of the Iron Man trilogy.  That's not to say it's a bad film, it just means that I liked the previous two Iron Man films better than this one.  I should state that while I've become a big fan of Marvel movies, I was never a big reader of comic books - so my feelings toward the film are more about it's merits/flaws as a movie experience (rather than how true it is to the comics).

I think about how far we've come since the first ""Iron Man"" (and it's not in a particularly good direction).  That film was refreshing because it played everything totally realistically - everything was tech-based, there was nothing supernatural.  And now, in the third film of the series, we've moved on to Extremis (which is by far the most un-realistic concept in any of the three films).  Now I'm not against fantasy movies, but up until now I've considered ""Iron Man"" to be one of the more grounded superhero franchises - and I liked it that way.

Also, it seems the new mandate from Marvel is to tie their movies together as much as possible, which is fine but it also puts a strain on the individual story being told.  This film seemed to draw less on the previous ""Iron Man"" movies and instead focus on the fallout from ""The Avengers"".  I understand why the events in at film, notably the battle in New York, would affect Stark emotionally.  But that whole storyline feels unnecessary in ""Iron Man 3"", and Tony's random panic attacks seem very out of place (and don't mesh tonally with the rest of the film).

PROS:
- As always with the Iron Man films, the crowd-pleasers - the action sequences and the moments of humor - were very well-done.
- Brian Tyler's score was fantastic, particularly the main theme for ""Iron Man 3"".

CONS:
- Although I love the song ""Blue"" that opened this movie, I really missed AC/DC's music.  It just seems odd to not have AC/DC in an Iron Man movie (it fit so well).
- To me, Tony's panic attacks felt out of place.
- As someone who likes a certain level of realism in movies, the concept of Extremis (and in particular fire-breathing) was another step in the wrong direction.
- I just wasn't a fan of the Mandarin's character arc.  It was a valid choice the filmmakers made, but it just didn't play well for me.",1378512000,,2434,4.401785714285714

5642636,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Unless you've been under a rock for the last 5 years, you know that Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of Tony Stark in 2008's Iron-Man singularly brought Marvel Studios to recent prominence. It is hard to remember that Marvel Comics almost went bankrupt in the late 90's, and that Marvel Studios' last round of success came from licensing its properties to other studios - beginning with 1998's ""Blade"", starring Wesley Snipes as the titular Vampire Hunter. So yeah, no Robert Downey Jr, no Avengers... and no Wesley Snipes, no Spider-Man or X-Men franchises as we know them.

Iron-Man 3 is a good movie but it is not a standalone story. A major plot thread of the movie references the Avengers so much, that this film essentially serves as a spin-off/sequel to that movie. But this makes sense, because Marvel has been deliberately trying to interweave all their movies into a coherent, persistent universe. And they have done such a good job at it that the latest movies using licensed characters (Sony's ""Spider-Man"", Fox's ""The Wolverine"") seem odd and weird for existing in a world without S.H.I.E.L.D. or the Avengers.

If you somehow missed this in theaters, and you've seen the Avengers, then I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie. I would have given it 5 stars, but I took a star away for their portrayal of the Iron-Man armor's durability in the film. If you watched Avengers, you know that Iron-Man's armor stands up to Thor and aliens. In this movie, watch how it fares against both the bad guys, and even normal traffic. However, this actually works for the sake of the story and helps to explains Tony Stark's overall mental state after his last Super Hero escapades.

Those are the only spoilers I'm giving you.

Yes, the Amazon Unbox DRM doesn't always work, but there are ""work-around's"" if you have technical issues with installing the movie on more mobile devices than Amazon allows, or if the DRM file on your PC is corrupted and won't allow you to download your purchased movies at all.

The film is well cast (with the whole team of Paltrow, Cheadle, and Favreau back in the saddle), well-written and witty, superbly acted and a just a lot of fun!

Robert Downy Jr, Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow were all great.  I thought that the movie really played to the strengths of the characters and told a great story.

SPOILER ALERT:  I thought that the way they used Ben Kingsley as the fake Mandarin was brilliant and definately out of left field.  I thought it was so humorous in the way it was presented and definately surprised me.  They could have stayed with the comic origins and had the rings of power and maybe even Fin Fang Foom, but this was great all the same.  I know this really irritated some of the die hard fans out there, but you cannot follow the comics line for line.  Why watch a movie based on the exact material you just read?  Do you not want to be surprised and fear for the characters?  If you know every aspect of the story, then what is the enjoyment of it.

Definately understand why this made so much money.  Best movie of the year.  Definate buy.",1378339200,2,1040,4.293814432989691

5642653,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Right off the bat, Iron Man 3 has a very different feel to it than the previous feel.even tony Stark himself reflects this in his narration that opens the film, where he says something along the lines of, ""things are different now, and I'm a different man"". Even the tone is different, and very unique. It isn't like the first two at all, even- this is reflected by Brian Tyler's score. Whereas the first two movies feel more polished, this film feels more raw and personal.

Tony Stark suffers from PTSD as a result of the events in ""The Avengers"", and furthermore, said events have made him realize that he's more vulnerable than ever now. Tony has to protect Pepper Potts, and his entire city. As a means of twiddling thumbs, Tony keeps adding upgrades to his Iron Suits. In one upgrade, he can signal them over piece by piece so he can begin wearing it from afar, and another upgrade is that he can move the suits himself. But even these won't stop Stark from suffering from nightmares and panic attacks about the New York events. He feels like he's in greater danger than ever before. This is even so much that he has the suits guard them while he sleeps.

For the first part of the film, the plot centers around this and two others: The Mandarin, a mysterious villain who commits acts of terrorism and transmits disturbing images warning people about his full potential. And then there's Aldridge Kyllian, a handsome but mysterious and brilliant scientist who has a cure for all weakness: Extremis, an addictive drug that helps people regenerate through body heat. Admittedly, the latter seems ridiculous given the context of the first two films, taking Iron Man in a more sci-fi direction that is admittedly very unexpected, but it works, in a way you wouldn't expect either.

What's really interesting about this film though is the sheer irony of Tony Stark spending at least 90% of the movie out of the iron suit. Yes, even more so than Iron Man 2, which was similarly light on iron, but heavy on stark. Don't let that worry you, though; in fact, by the time the final battle comes along, you won't have even cared about the fact that he spends so much of the movie out of the suit. He even goes so far as to make a stealth break-in in one scene using store-bought materials. And the use of the self-moving suit (controlled by Tony from an external source) is used brilliantly in the airplane scene. I don't have a fear flying, but I do have a fear of falling and the cinematography, even in IMAX, had me suffering intense bouts of vertigo. The plane scene is one of the more well-done action scenes in the movie, and is executed very cleverly. The final battle does cost the film some points in that there's too many suits used in the scene, making it very hard to follow at times, but it's a fun scene to watch, and some very clever twists and cliffhangers are used.

Also, stay around for the bonus scene after the credits. I guarantee, you won't be disappointed.

In short, Iron Man 3 is the worst of the film and it does have some flaws, but it's still tons of fun to watch. It's both a blazingly exciting action epic and a character study that deconstructs Tony Stark's character very cleverly. Even if you find tons of things wrong with the story, you'll still enjoy it for the fun it offers.",1378252800,5,3308,4.515859766277129
5642654,5,B00BL1BJFW,"This film is action packed.  The action scenes are incredible.  Even more incredible when you learn how they filmed some of them!  I won't ruin the extras.  But this film is a very humanizing, humbling, self-effacing portrait of Tony Stark in the midst of troubles he is outmatched by.  When the suit is gone, Tony is a charming James Bond type with American flair--but he is just a human.  Up against some enemies that will freak you out.  In fact, I'd say the enemies in this film are way more frightening than the aliens he faced in Avengers.

The movie constantly puts Tony Stark in horrible situations, in over his head with evil.  Pepper plays a fantatic part in this film.  So does Rhodey (War Machine).  Jarvis is one of the best characters, as always.  Happy too.  Everybody gets a chance to shine in this film.  Especially the SUITS!!!!

Iron Man's deadliest enemy and a popular villain from Marvel turns out to be a joke. Instead of the mastermind he was portrayed in the comics, here he's a washed up actor pretending to play the villain while the character Killian was the real deal. Great disappointment, especially when the rings didn't come to life. The rings were the trademark of the Mandarin and the reason why he became popular.

5642673,3,B00BL1BJFW,"OK, fans of super hero films, Generation X-ers and anyone else with an opinion; here we go.

Number One - The first half of the film had me saying the exact opposite of what I wrote above. When the Mandarin called the Prez on Air Force One - I said out loud: ""This is the best one yet"". Which as you guessed I retracted approximately 20 minutes later. The Mandarin is an ICONIC Villan the way he was originally written. The script twist was Stupid. It is because of the tone struck right at that point that most movie goers find Super Hero movies juvenile. The Mandarin as revealed to the audience in the first half of the film, was awesome and scary. Then, the desire for a cheap laugh blew the whole thing. Alderidge should have been like Johan Schmidt in Captain America; A second banana who was trying to eclipse his boss. Nice Going, Mr. Black. You single handedly erased all the ground gained by The Avengers with the film goers who are not fans.

Number Two - Marvel never should have taken Jon Favreau off the Iron Man  franchise. He knows Marvel, He Knows Tony Stark and the first 2 installments were perfect. When some thing isn't broken, DON""T FIX IT.

Number Three - Pepper in the Armor?? Really? Come on! Lame, Lame, Lame, Lame Lame! It seems to me that too many people have gotten to wear that Armor in the movies. It doesn't matter that they wrote those stories lines in the comics..They were bad, and not worth wasting valuable Celluloid on.

Number Four - Even if Tony had blown up all his armors and had surgery to remove all the Shrapnel (which makes sense), he wouldn't toss the chest arc reactor in the sea -  No Way.  Again, Stupid.

Topping the past 2 Iron Man movies and the Avengers would be really difficult, but not impossible. The stories are already written, they just need to be tweeked.

by the way, I didn't hate it. I just was disappointed - as all of you should be.",1377993600,10,1899,4.387464387464387
5642674,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Personally, I never felt strongly about Iron Man or Iron Man 2, although IM2 definitely improved by including Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff, an integral and awesome character in the Marvel franchise. IM3 follows The Avengers shockingly smoothly, addressing Tony's very realistic responses to his near-death experience in New York. Not only is Tony's PTSD and general anxiety addressed, but it is done respectfully. However,  this isn't the only great thing about this movie; the plot is intriguing and carries the film, and ends up subverting the often racist idea of terrorism hitting America - instead of the evil Chinese terrorist being the main villain, we instead have to worry about an angry and embittered white man. This is great to see, considering that movies recently have refused to recognize the racist stereotypes in media.

Not only does this film deal with racism and anxiety in respectful ways, but Pepper Potts is allowed to shine in ways she previously hasn't. But none of these things take away from Tony's story; instead, they add to it. Tony's story involves other characters and isn't a cliche, and it's put together wonderfully and shockingly entertaining.

IM3 could have easily been a bust and ignored these issues, but instead it dealt with them in a respectful and entertaining manner. If you haven't seen it and like the Marvel universe, I highly recommend this film. And if you just like good action films that deal with real life issues - definitely pick it up, or at least rent it or borrow it from the library when it's available.",1377820800,3,1572,4.969581749049429
5642675,4,B00BL1BJFW,"*Be warned, this review contains spoilers*

When it comes to Marvel's latest masterpieces, Iron Man 3 has by far the greatest gap in differing opinions.

What this movie is NOT; Iron Man 3 is NOT a movie where Tony Stark is portrayed to be an ""American hero"" going out to fight ""cliche terrorists"", like the promos made it seem. Personally, I am glad for this- while The Mandarin may have been a well written comic character, a ""terrorist"" movie has no place in the American media after the previous decade's elections. A terrorist is an insensitive idea, and, quite frankly, the way the promotions were HINTING at a ""terrorist"" really put me off. When it turned out that there was no foreign named terrorist, I became more interested. The Iron Man movies are not ""Tony Stark vs the world,"" no, each one has been a political statement, a slap to the face- Tony Stark does not go out and fight bad guys from everywhere else, no, he saves America from itself- and Iron Man 3 is the best example of that.

I was very glad to go into the theater (I was kind enough to be invited to a midnight release) and see a movie that delved deeper into Tony Stark, himself. This movie shows how Tony Stark is recovering from the events in ""New York""; Tony is even more messed up than before- worse than his initial kidnapping way back in the first Iron Man. It shows the man outside the suit- his life, those important to him, and how Tony is trying to get that back under control. The suits have become a habit, a hobby- he may be Iron Man, but Tony Stark has his own needs, emotional and psychological. Instead of some foreign power causing trouble, the root of the movie's peril comes from within the US, within someone in Tony's own memories. Tony is fighting himself in more ways than one- psychologically and physically, in that Aldrich Killian represents one of Tony's past mistakes.

This movie is far better than most people are saying; please, ignore the ""misleading"" trailers and look into the product, itself. Marvel has done their characters justice yet again; IM3 deserves praise.",1377734400,5,2079,4.595687331536388

  - More Iron Man Action. More Iron man in more scenarios. that's what we wont. WWSD?
  - He starts behaving like Tony stark should. He can't shake his own agency or the value of human lives. He cannot reenter his fantasy/escape.

Cons:
  - Potential:
  + Extremis was Tony's first step into trans-humanism. He would now have a stronger, faster body and be able to rebuild his suit on-the-fly while storing the entire thing in the hallows of his bones via nanites. Instead, Tony never even uses them. Extremis is used as nothing more than a monster maker. a magic potion with little explanation. Just another excuse to bring another simple-minded bad-guy into the movie for tony to fight.
  + The villain was supposed to be one of earth's most powerful sorcerers. An Extremis-modified super human with the ability to reshape his armer and being to build tech in ways that only he can, fighting Marvel Studio's first, real sorcerer. Pure tech vs pure magic. There are no rules for this kind of battle on film. That would have been both risky and interesting. Iron Man 3 was fun, not interesting, but fun.",1377388800,9,1109,4.694300518134715

The producer after the movie even asked the crowd what they thought and they had A LOT of negative feed back. My beef is it dose not fit the bill of any iron man comic when he has the surgery to remove the ark reactor, and it runes the next avengers movie because with out the ark reactor there it's like iron man has lost one of his most unique  characteristics. I as a hard core marvel comic fan was offended seeing  that go to blu-ray and DVD!",1377388800,3,674,3.841726618705036
5642701,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Being a big fan of the original Iron Man and Robert Downey, Jr., have to say I was pretty disappointed with this sequel.

This movie lacks originality, solid plot, and character development.  If this was the first movie of the 3 Iron Man's, it would have also been THE LAST.  Let me emphasize:

Here we have a superhero with astonishing mental and emotional characteristics, which was actually established in the first movie (thanks to Robert's excellent acting). What sets IronMan apart from other superheros is his mortality; without his suit, Tony Stark is just a blood and flesh human being, that is capable of dying of cancer or developing alcohol addiction (as seen in Iron Man 2).  In this movie, Tony Stark displays PTSD, which really added to the character's depth, yet did not seem to fit within the general tone of the movie. Robert's acting was mediocre at best and really seemed out of place with the Disney World tone of this movie.

What a clich...(Spoiler alert)
Tony Stark decides to give up all his incredible abilities and care for society for some bimbo named Pepper. What a bad bad ending... How many times have we seen a Super hero give up his powers (Ex. Superman 2) to live a domestic boring life with some aging woman?  Towards the end of the movie, Tony decides to blow up something like 100 Iron Man Suits, to start a ""New Slate"".  Oh PLEASE, ""let me create 100 ten billion dollars suits, so I can blow them up in a 'beautiful' firework display to impress my boring girlfriend.""  One of many major stinker scenes in this movie.

The Villains:
Ok, this is the most ridiculous villains I've ever seen.  You have normal people turned into fire breathing red devils, by some magical serum.  Dumb, dumb, dumb..  Is that the best the writers could come up with? What is amusingly idiotic, is that if the bad guys get ""too hot"" they explode like mini atomic bombs. (Spoiler alert) Having the Mandarin turn out to be a Ex-homeless British theater actor was actually kind of humorous, but may not sit well with many avid fans of marvel comic movies.

If this movie had left out the cliche ending, dumb villains, bad acting, annoying characters, and Tony's lard butt bodyguard it may have been a decent.. oh wait, that pretty much is everything. (smirk)

On the positive side, this movie had a couple of entertaining action scenes, but hardly made up for the rest of this Iron Man tragedy.",1377388800,8,2406,4.6415094339622645
5642702,2,B00BL1BJFW,"I really enjoyed the first Iron Man, and Iron Man 2 (as boring as it was) was an okay movie. This latest installment was unsatisfying. The movie was cliche, characters were just annoying, especially Pepper and the kid, and the twist with the Mandarin, which wasn't half bad, had a terrible payoff. Many people enjoyed the action scenes, also okay, just don't grab you. My biggest gripe with the movie is the ending, just a rushed resolution. As a casual movie goer, it will keep you entertain, and does a good job at it. However, fans of the franchise, or non-casual movie goers, will find this movie the worst in the series. Hopefully when Iron Man 4 comes out, it won't be as bad as this one.",1377388800,5,694,4.47244094488189

5642704,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man 3 only works slightly when its making fun of itself.  From the revelation about The Mandarin to a wise cracking little boy side character, the film uses self referential irony to try to make up for its cliched ideas.  Out for the most part it relies on one unimaginative CGI action sequence after another, and the wink and nod aren't enough to redeem such tired archetypes.  This is the movie that makes one wonder if they'll ever stop making super hero movies.  Unless you really like Robert Downy Jr, I wouldn't bother with it.",1377129600,3,538,4.572916666666667
5642705,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Of the Iron Man the trilogy, the first film is still the best one.  It has a great balance of story, characterization, and action.  However, even in saying that, there is still only one film that, in my opinion, has given us the best and most complete version of Iron Man, and that was ""The Avengers,"" which is still my favorite film with Iron Man (who has always been my favorite superhero).

Any time that you sacrifice story for special effects or human connection for spectacle, you end up with a very flat story and film.  George Lucas once stated shortly after the first Star Wars film in 1977 that ""special effects without a good story is a pretty boring thing.""  There is a lot of irony in that statement since he largely broke his own ""rule"" with his latest trilogy, which is also why the newer trilogy is largely considered to be quite inferior to the previous one.

Iron Man 3 delves deeply into the mind and psyche of Tony Stark.  We already know that he is a man of great wealth and intellect, who often prefers a drink in his hand or a one-night stand at his side, than to have to deal with any real human connection.  This is an aspect of the character that is largely taken from the comic book storyline of Tony Stark.  In a very real sense, it can be distilled down to ""the man vs. the machine,"" which ironically, is a theme that has been addressed in many science fiction and fantasy storylines.

The principal villain of this film is a terrorist known as The Mandarin who is assisted by and orchestrated by AIM (Advanced Idea Mechanics), founded by Aldrich Killian (wonderfully portrayed by Guy Pearce) who wishes to demonstrate an unnatural union between scientific advancement and human biology.

Tony Stark's world is turned upside down by the Mandarin who instigates an attack upon Tony at his Malibu beach home.  The attack is well orchestrated as we see Tony struggle to save himself, but also the one person in his life that he realizes that he loves even more than himself: Pepper Potts.

With many of his suits of armor destroyed, and stuck with his most advanced, yet non-working, M-42 suit of armor, Tony must figure out a way to, not only find out who has masterminded the attacks, but how to stop them and get his life back...largely without the use of the armor that he has become so largely dependent on.

Tony Stark realizes how fragile his life is, and how dependent he has become upon his armor.  Perhaps so much so, that he has forgotten the human aspects of himself.  He has done a tremendous amount of good in the world, since the invention of his armor and the alteration of his company's ideals and mission.  However, Tony is also forced to come to terms with his own mortality, which is largely exacerbated by the trauma of nearly being killed in New York while fighting to save the Earth alongside his fellow Avengers.

There isn't a whole lot of Iron Man in this film, and those who were really looking forward to seeing a lot of Iron Man may find this film to be largely disappointing.  Iron Man 3 could easily be titled ""Tony Stark,"" because the film's story is about him, not Iron Man.  Robert Downy Jr., who has already immortalized himself as Tony Stark/Iron Man gives us a greater depth of that character than has ever been done before.  And, of course, his performance is as magnificent as it ever has been.

The film does have a number of moments that you may find yourself ""raising your eyebrows"" at; situations that just don't seem to fit or situations that might detract from the story.  These elements prevent, in my opinion, this film from becoming even better than it is.

Iron Man 3 works because it focuses on the human elements; the connection that the viewer feels with and for Tony Stark; his constant inner battle with who he is and what is really important in his life.  Perhaps he even succeeds in realizing that Iron Man may very well be a part of him, but Iron Man is not all that he is.  And Pepper greatly serves Tony by, perhaps, being the only person to realize this and accept both Tony and Iron Man for who they are.

Joss  Whedon gave us an exciting Iron Man as well as a fallible and all-too-human Iron Man/Tony Stark in ""The Avengers"".  We have already seen Tony at his most charming, most selfish, most defensive, most exciting, and most self-sacrificing self.  Iron Man 3 gives us Tony at his most vulnerable state.  And perhaps that is why we can relate to him so well, because facing and dealing with our own vulnerable states is most often that one thing which we most fear to do.",1377043200,7,4563,4.494545454545454

The action was fantastic; Stark's panic attacks make him all the more human, and interesting since it tied in with The Avengers, making it a part of the same world instead of a stand alone; loved the kid and the entire plot in the small town; not certain I liked the end result for Potts but it played well overall.

5642725,1,B00BL1BJFW,"Everyone was excited over Avengers. It made over $1 billion in the box office and was a huge success. Well, because of that, it was a gimme Iron Man 3 would be a smash hit as well. But here's the problem. The movie made over $1 billion in the box office, but the movie itself was a massive let-down.

For starters, the film is called IRON MAN 3. Meaning Tony Stark as Iron Man. But at least 98% of Iron Man sequences are the suit controlled by Tony from another location or by Jarvis. And when Tony did get in the suit? The suit was rendered immediately useless by someone with Extremis powers. The Mark 42 was a joke. It kept falling  apart, and that joke got old FAST. But they kept using that joke. Even in the end when Tony looked like he was about to be killed by the ""real"" Mandarin, he spots Mark 42 coming while Jarvis controlled suits are fighting Extremis soldiers, he says, ""the prodigal son returns"", and it immediately fell apart. I remember hearing everyone around me laughing at that scene. And all I could think was, ""what, you still think it's funny after the first 20 times it fell apart?""

What the movie got right: Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark.

What sucked about the movie: You name it, it sucked.

For starters, they build up the Mandarin as this dangerous terrorist, even doing this big thing showing that he has the President willing to cater to him to protect innocent people. Then when Tony confronts him, without his suit of course, I mean, who wants to see an Iron Man movie where he's actually wearing the armor? When he confronts the Mandarin, it's revealed that this big bad terrorist is just an actor hired by Killian (the ""real"" Mandarin) to distract people. That way while the FBI and Shield (oh wait, SHEILD isn't in this movie, even when the President is kidnapped, Nick Fury doesn't even send one agent to help) will be chasing the actor and not the real threat. Killian kidnaps Pepper, pumps her full of Extremis, which makes her invincible, and when she falls into fire, she doesn't die.

In fact, Pepper beats the bad guy! After every suit Tony uses to try to beat the bad guy is wrecked, Tony is left whimpering in a corner while Pepper beats the bad guy. Pepper is all upset because Tony spends more time with his suits than with her, so he blows up all of his suits. Then in a voice-over narration, Tony reveals that they cured Pepper (even though it was mentioned that there was no cure). TOny has his arc reactor removed from his chest, which he didn't think to do in the first movie? Then Tony looks at the remains of his house, and says, ""I'm still Iron Man."" Yeah, because blowing up all of your suits and removing the power source didn't effectively neuter you from being Iron man or anything. I forgot to mention the freaking kid. They do this lame bit where Tony is hanging out with a little kid who helps him when he's in a small town investigating an Extremis explosion, similar to what injured Tony's friend Happy (who thought that name up?). The kid saves Tony at one point. Meaning Tony spent more time being saved by other people than by actually being the badass the first 2 movies and Avengers painted him to be. Oh, and the ""invincible suit of armor"" was easily broken by the kid. The kid just popped a finger off effortlessly. Which might explain why Tony destroyed all of his suits. The more he made, apparently the worse they got. Must have been shame, not pandering to his woman.

This movie sucked. After a solid Phase One, Marvel has started out Phase 2 with a big ole turd. Pass it up. Maybe rent it, but don't buy it. Frankly, the only movie from Phase 2 that seems to have any real potential is Thor: The Dark World. And that'll obviously be ruined by the fact that Natalie Portman has been upgraded from supporting cast to main cast. Meaning she'll probably beat the bad guy while Thor watches on.",1375747200,8,3870,4.426966292134831

5642731,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man 3, which is the focus of the Extremis virus and Tony Stark's mental breakdown after the events in The Avengers, is directed and co-written by Shane Black. Here, we see darker action sequences, much more serious plot, but also something that angered hard-core Marvel fans everywhere: The Mandarin, who is literally nothing like the one from the comics. Now, I do love action movies, and comic-to-film movies (DC and Marvel fan), but after watching Iron Man 3, I cannot fathom the stupidity behind the film. First, they turned Tony Stark's most powerful and diabolical enemy into a walking joke (literally) who was supposed to wield the ancient Ten Rings of Power, which came from an alien ship. But no, Shane Black completely removed that plot line from the Avengers universe. Why? Because it wasn't grounded and not realistic enough, and yet, somehow, people who breathe fire and explode is more realistic than aliens. Then, secondly, Aldrich Killian, who was supposed to kill himself for his mistake in creating Extremis, is a main villain here. I will just stop there, because I need to review the movie as a film now.

The acting is good, with Downey, Jr. becoming a much more battle-hardened Tony, who must accept the fact that extra-terrestrials exist. Paltrow is great here, showing us a side to Pepper that we have yet to see, and it is awesome. The directing is good, being better than Favreau's in Iron Man 2, but not the first Iron Man. Brian Tyler's musical score is great, capturing both the bombastic action sequences and darkness that is surrounding Tony. The script was good (movie-wise), having a twist that some movie-goers will not see coming. The visual effects were good, but not award-worthy compared to that of other releases (Ex. Pacific Rim, Man of Steel, Oblivion).

So, if you have not read the Iron Man comic storyline for ""Extremis,"" then you will like this addition. If you have, I suggest you steer away because you will be angry, or suspend your love for the comics for this film and any further Marvel addition involving Iron Man/Tony Stark.

5642732,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Ok. I won't give a point for point review as others have already done so eloquently and these comments will only make sense to anyone who has already seen the film. But for the most part this film was a big disappointing mess. Tony Stark dealing with post traumatic stress syndrome?? Most of his suits  of armor presented as so weak and brittle? (Note: one suit survived an entire war in The Avengers movie??).. Pepper Potts can freely jump into an Iron Man suit and know how to use it?.. That element reflected a total disconnect between the significant bond of Stark and his suit.""I am Iron Man.. The suit and I are one."" Apparently this is not the case if simply anyone can jump in the suit and be a bad ass. Iron Pepper saves Tony? - silly! And I don't believe that SHIELD would have allowed an attack on Stark's seaside residence. His home would have been under surveillance due to his statements regarding The Mandarin. And now Pepper has mutant powers?..Really?..  These are just a few of the asenine moments in this film. I'm hoping Iron Man 4 will clean up some of this silliness. I will probably get the 3D blu ray version just to have the trilogy. The tone of the film was just dry and uninteresting from the start. Of course It will be hard for Iron Man to follow his heroics performed in The Avengers,but this film just seemed aimless and uneventful. I'm getting a headache.. Maybe I'll add more later. I gave this film 2 stars out of respect to RDJ's performance. He truely has made this character his own.",1374883200,6,1520,4.4640287769784175
5642733,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Darker than the two previous Iron Man movies, Iron Man 3 is a cautionary tale. It reminds me, oddly enough, of an episode of the TV series Touched By An Angel, in which the angel Monica, in an uncharacteristic bad mood, snaps at someone, setting off a chain of events that results in a woman's suicide. One never knows what impact a seemingly unimportant act or comment might have on another.

At the start of the film, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), in voice-over, says that he created two of his own demons. He recalls the events of New Year's Eve 1999. His callous treatment of two idealistic young scientists, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), at a party in Switzerland set into motion a thirteen-year quest for revenge that would lead to countless deaths and destruction.

When Tony must face those demons, the timing couldn't be worse. He's been struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder since his all-too-close brush with death in New York (in The Avengers). He's unable to sleep. He's plagued by self-doubt. He builds one Iron Man armor after another, for a grand total of forty-eight. He worries that he can't protect the one thing--the one person--he can't live without: Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), now CEO of Stark Industries. Yet in his manic state, he seems to be neglecting her, and that worries his friend and former bodyguard, now head of Stark security, Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau)--especially when Aldrich Killian shows up at Stark Industries one day, presumably in search of funding for his Extremis project (which reminds me a lot of the supersoldier project in Captain America: The First Avenger).

Extremis is one of those discoveries that, in the right hands, could have been a gift to humanity--but it's in the hands of a madman, and it's dangerously flawed. But is the madman the Asian terrorist who calls himself The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley), or is it Killian himself? Not everything in Iron Man 3 is what it appears to be.

The movie could be subtitled Tony Stark Finally Grows Up, because until now, he's been, for the most part, a big kid with a lot of really cool toys. He's the boy who never thought his father loved him. I've often wondered what his relationship with his mother was like, and what role it played in his inability to commit to Pepper through two movies and countless comic books. A shrink could make a career of this guy.

Iron Man 3 is more about Tony Stark than it is about Iron Man. As he searches for the identity of his enemy, he also searches for his own identity in his post-Avengers world, and what he discovers in the midst of all the explosions, battles and confrontations is, I think, as surprising to him as it will be to his audience. I loved it--as always, RDJ delivers the rapid-fire wit in abundance, and though there's less banter between him and Paltrow this time around, there's some funny dialogue between him and best buddy Rhodey (Don Cheadle), who hates having to trade in War Machine for Killian's flashier Iron Patriot armor--Rhodey's password, WARMACHINEROCKS, pretty much says it all. There's also some great scenes between Tony and a young Tennessee boy (Ty Simpkins) that makes me wonder--could there be a baby in Tony and Pepper's future?",1374796800,6,3255,4.795008912655971
5642734,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Living in China has it's perks.

Cinema tickets are dirt cheap, for one. The movies stay in theatres longer. China is the fastest growing movie market, and many big Hollywood films (Looper, Iron Man 3, World War Z, Transformers 4) are catering to China to capitalize investment, leading to cool bonus features, premieres, and early releases.

There are downsides, though.

On a good year, 15 blockbusters will come out (The only 2013 Hollywood films to come to China so far are: Oz: The Great and Powerful, Jack the Giant Slayer, Oblivion, Iron Man 3, The Croods, Man of Steel, and Star Trek Into Darkness. UPDATE: After Earth, White House Down, Fast and Furious 6, and Pacific Rim have come too). They will ALL have Chinese subtitles. None of them (except for the aforementioned China-Hollywood partnerships) will be released on time, leaving viewers like me waiting as long as a month to see a film. I had to go to Hong Kong to see The Hobbit in theatres. And worst, to watch a film with a Chinese audience is destroy the sacred ritual of movie watching, and open up to a barrage of jabbering, phone calls, and Chinese ads before the movie.

But I'm not complaining. Well, I kind of am. But this system means that only the biggest films come into China, sparing us from the chaff and Adam Sandler comedies. Who wouldn't want that?

...

So that's a run down of foreign cinema in China, told from a first-hand basis. Lets get down to Iron Man 3.
The film, directed by Shane Black of Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang fame, got a lot of buzz for having roughly 5 minutes of extra, only-seen-in-China bonus features. It was rumoured to star veteran character actor WANG XUEQI and superstar FAN BINGBING (A very popular Chinese actress and model. Think the Chinese Angelina Jolie. I actually had the pleasure of bumping into her one night as she was swarmed around by jubilant fans while visiting the Canton Tower. True story!)

...

So what of the extra footage? Well, to put it simply - mildly, even...it was TERRIBLE. The scenes had a knack for completely and utterly destroying all tension in the film. They were conveniently placed around action scenes or strategic emotional moments to just let the tension fall from the movie. Don't get me wrong; the bonus scenes did not ruin the film, which I greatly enjoyed, and found it fun, action-packed, emotional, and, at times, hilarious. Review and overview of the scenes below, but first, you'll have to forgive me - my Chinese is not fluent, but I get around. So don't expect fancy translations. Also, I have never seen the foreign theatrical version, so if you people NOT in China have seen a scene here, let me know in the comments.

SCENE 1: At the party in 1990, Tony Stark is introduced to a Dr. Wu (Wang Xueqi), by Dr. Yinsen (see Iron Man). He is told Wu is one of the foremost authorities on advanced surgery: something that will come up later on in the film. Wu talks to Tony in straight Chinese. Tony does not understand, but laughs and says, ""I like your style"" and invites him to ""Party sometime"". This is the best of the bonus scenes, and the only time Downey Jr. has contact with any of the Chinese actors.

SCENE 2: Dr. Wu is seen back in China, years later. TV screens in the background show Iron Man in Beijing, school-children clapping, and Wu shaking hands with the metal-suited billionaire before he blasts off into the sky. He then gets on the phone with someone who is suspected to be JARVIS (Tony's robot helper), where he talks for several minutes. I have no idea what he was saying, but it was dull, unnecessary, and basically served as filler while they stuck in product placement. I later learned he is looking to contact Stark, urgently.
Smack dab in the most obvious place on the screen is the word ""ZOOMLION"" - the name of a construction company.

SCENE 3: An unmemorable continuation of the above. Wu continues to talk on the phone. He is careful, reserved, as if talking to someone important.

SCENE 4: This scene takes place after the climax. Fan Bingbing is seen walking down a hospital corridor wearing an unconvincing nurse's outfit, but looking gorgeous, carrying some papers. She opens the door to Dr. Wu's office, and OHMIGOD, what in the name of the great green goblin? He's pouring himself a drink. Of a cheap, common soymilk drink, available in every hole-in-the-wall shop. This is the most shameless product placement I have _ever_ seen.

SCENE 5: The two characters - Wu, and his assistant, prepare for their operation on Tony Stark. They wash their hands, stare at themselves in mirrors, and put on surgical gloves. This is so melodramatic and overdone it looks like a cheap Chinese soap opera. I wanted to throw something at the damn screen. They talk about how dangerous it is, and what is at stake. They realize they are risking the life of the world's most powerful superhero.

SCENE 6: Tony Stark is seen under the knife as Dr. Wu operates on him. Acupuncture needles are seen in his arms, and Wu removes a tiny piece of shrapnel from his chest with forceps, then drops it as it is sucked up by an electromagnet, where several other pieces of shrapnel are seen.

SCENE 7: Wu is seen on another phone call, where he is glad to know that the mission worked out all right.

All the scenes comprise perhaps 4-5 minutes.

BONUS: The two actors get placement in the credits.
MEGA-DISAPPOINTMENT: For some unfathomable reason, there is NO post-credit scene with Mark Ruffalo. I stayed until the screen went black. Nothing, nada, !

Conclusion: There is literally _nothing_ to miss in the Chinese scenes, which feature wooden acting, poor plot and dialogue, and shameless product placement. They do not contribute to the film in anyway, but they do not detract from it, as evinced by Iron Man 3's billion dollar payout.

................

What did I think of the film itself? I liked it very much! Shane Black directs with style, the action is fast-paced, explosive, and engaging, the screenplay is sharp and witty, and filled with twists, Robert Downey Jr. IS _the Bomb_, Ben Kingsley steals the scenes, the plot is action-packed, surprisingly emotional, and with a satisfying conclusion. The score by Brian Tyler is completely fantastic - reminding one of the James Bond theme. My favorite movie soundtrack of the year, tied with Hans Zimmer's operatic Man of Steel score.

I predicted this would be a money-making success from the very beginning. It's nothing serious, nothing weighty - just Marvel firing on all cylinders, and the result is an entertaining summer blockbuster. It _does_ have problems - that Mandarin Twist is now infamous and makes a sizeable portion of the audience feel cheated, and there are numerous plot holes (In one scene, one of the Extremis soldiers heats up his hand to metal-melting temperate...with his WATCH on!)

But I chose to play along with the twists, and was swept away with the ride.

And what a ride it is!

4.1 Stars! Highly Recommended!

...

I hope you enjoyed my review on the Chinese scenes in Iron Man 3. If you missed them, there is really no need to worry. But if you really DO want to see them, Marvel is releasing a One Shot (short film) called The Prologue that will feature these China only scenes.

5642736,1,B00BL1BJFW,"*SPOILERS NOTICE* for the 2-3 people who haven't seen the movie by now, but feel compelled to read the reviews.

As good as the first Iron Man was, the 3rd movie was horrible.  I can forgive a certain number of plot holes big enough to drive a Audi though (more on that in a second) since the whole point of a action-packed big-budget early-summer block-buster is to entertain, but there were so many problems with this one that my brain kept reminding me that what I was watching was preposterous.  Here are a few that annoyed me the most.

1) EVERYBODY seemed to drive an Audi.  Okay, I get Tony owning an R8 and I'll even buy Pepper driving the RS7, but honestly, even the BAD GUY drove an Audi?  Talk about product placement overkill.  Did the pizza delivery guy drive a TT as well?  I'll have to keep an eye out for it in a future extended ""director's cut"" of the movie.

2) One size fits all Iron Man suits.  It doesn't seem to matter if you are tall, short, fat, or skinny - an Iron Man suit will fit you and function perfectly.  Tony Stark could make a 2nd fortune as a tailor.

3) Something like 500 Iron Man suits (including the Lego suit) that don't actually need a person inside of them to operate as autonomous entities.  'nuff said.

4) That kid. One question - why?

5) The self-destruct ""button"" in every Iron Man suit.  Even Doctor Doofenshmirtz knows better that to install one of them (and yet he does anyway - so perplexing, but I degrees).

6) Pretty much everything that happened in the last 5 minutes of the movie.  Every single sub-plot and open issue is wrapped-up in a convenient (and absolutely ridiculous) montage.  Seriously, the only way it could have been made any more clear that this might be the last movie in the series would have been if Robert Downey Jr. looked right at the camera and said ""THE END!  DO YOU GET IT PEOPLE?  EVERY SUB-PLOT AND LOOSE END HAS BEEN WRAPPED-UP!  THE ONE THING THAT MADE ME TRULY UNIQUE IS GONE!  IT'S OVER!  GO AWAY!""

5642749,4,B00BL1BJFW,"I am an Iron Man fan, loved the first two movies. I think that Robert Downey Junior nails the part perfectly. He did a great job on this one. But, the writing, script etc was a bit confusing. Not to mention that I remember from the comic books a guy named Mandarin who was an actual guy who wanted world domination etc. This story deviated from that whole scenario quite a bit. ***Spoiler Alert the whole Mandarin as a actor/fool just took something away from the Iron Man storyline, and to be honest I found it confusing. Why not let Mandarin be Mandarin. Why did they need another person who hid behind his persona? There was no need for that unless they were looking for filler. There is a great but unrealistic connection with a little boy whose' garage Tony Stark ends up in. And, how is it he had to drag the iron man costume around. I remember the costume used to fold up into a briefcase. There were way too many conflicting pieces to this Iron Man. Conflicting in the sense that they conflicted with the comic book version that I remembered. When Iron Man landed on the ground in the ice and snow, his suit began to fail. Ok, he got out. Then the suit should have folded up into a neat compact suit that could be carried. Perhaps because this was an experimental suit, maybe I could buy that. Then there was the scene where he saves something like 17 people who are blown out of an airplane, very unrealistic, but hey it's a comic book movie, I'll accept it. That is, until the train shatters his suit and we find out. . . HE WASN'T IN IN IT!!!!!  Talk about confusing and misleading. There were many other plot holes. What does picking up that little tiny piece at the end really symbolize, certainly not what I think it was supposed to. (Have to watch the movie to find out that spoiler).  **** End Spoiler Alert.  All in all I will buy this one when it comes out, only because I want to see it again. That and I own every Marvel Movie that has been put out, so why not this one too? Should you buy it, I think there is enough fun in this one that justifies buying it when it comes down to about $5 or maybe as part of a multi-pack unless you have the others already like I do.

5642751,2,B00BL1BJFW,"The Good- Robert Downey Jr. gives a solid performance as Tony Stark.  The chemistry between Stark and Rhoadie is much better here than in Iron Man 2.  The scene in which Stark's house is destroyed is top-flight filmmaking.
The Bad-  The scene where his house is destroyed is the first action sequence of the movie and also the best of the film. That's bad.  For some reason, there are no working Iron Man suits throughout the entire movie (either the weapons system is down but he decides to wear the suit anyway, or all his suits break apart like toys from a thrift shop). The fraility of the suits was annoying. He gives one a karate chop after it goes haywire in response to a nightmare he is having and it crumbles like an old cookie. Huh?  Yet, in the Avengers, he gets caught up in the rotor of the SHIELD heli-carrier and the suit remains intact (as it should, otherwise Tony Stark would be dead). Another negative was the lack of a villian who posed a threat.  In this movie we are promised the Mandarin, but in an act of blatant false advertising the audience is cheated and we are given 'Firedude' as the main villian.  Then, Iron Man must fight Firedude's henchman who have the same power as the main villian (borrrring).  Firedude is too busy constantly making jokes to ever prove a menance to Iron Man.  Super Patriot is completely wasted in this movie.  A cool looking suit, but all he ever does is walk around.  There is also a lot of mistimed humor here, namely, at the film's climax (not really the time for slapstick, but rather, to get the audience pumped up).  The climax is an unmitigated diaster, everyone jumping around as if it were a videogame and ordinary people making jumps with Spider-man like grace. Huh? The end of the film deconstructs what the previous two had  established (see for yourself). Tony Stark is physically in an Iron Man suit for about 15 minutes (probably less) of the 2+ hour movie. Uhhh, isn't that the whole point of the movie?
The Deal- Shane Black misses by a country mile here.  While there are some good scenes, the parts are greater than the sum.  I was somewhat disappointed in Iron Man 2, but Iron man 3, makes Iron Man 2 look like Iron Man 1. The story was interesting up until about the mid-way point where the wheels came off in a hurry.  If you like seeing Tony Stark beat up baddies without his armor, then this movie is your cup of tea.  Initially, I was excited about Shane Blank writing and directing. 'Wow' I thought, that's the guy who did Lethal Weapon.  Then it hit me, what else did he do? Uhhhhhhhhhh......yeah.

but i felt that this film was more of a Robert Downey Jr. action comedy, than it was an Iron Man movie.  for some that is fine.  for me, that is not why i watch comic book films.  i want a good story centered around Tony Stark and Iron Man Lore.  i want the bad guy to be compelling.  I want to see Tony Stark and Iron Man..  I want the die hard Iron Man fans to come out of that movie saying ""WOW.  now THAT was Iron Man!"".  Unfortunately, i didn't get that with this film.  I got a great action comedy with Robert Downey Jr. as the main character.  not once did i feel like i was watching Tony Stark or Iron Man.

It had some great action scenes and special effects, but they were just not enough to rescue this sequel.  It was too depressing at times, and there were long, boring scenes where boy befriends superhero. I also just didn't buy the mad scientist turns soldiers into lava creatures bit. While you might be able to teach someone how to spontaneously combust, I don't think there is an off switch. I did enjoy the movie more the second time I watched it, but it is my least favorite of the three.  I saw the first Ironman because I was a Robert Downey, Jr fan, not a fan of Ironman the superhero.  I never really liked the comic, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Ironman 2 was also very good, because the formula was the same.  This one was different. He lost his charm, his devil-may-care attitude and his aura of the invincible superhero.

Movies with character, movies with depth, we need these, and it kills me that so many people hate on Iron Man 3 because that implies they just want a big mechanical suit shooting stuff for two hours, ala Saturday Morning cartoons.  To me, that says that we lack the attention span to enjoy a film with depth, character, and humor.  Iron Man 3 was a huge film, a huge success, and a ton of fun.

No doubt there are changes and even errors compared to the Iron Man rulebook.  On the other hand, if you can take a step back and realize this is a movie that pokes fun at both itself and current events, it's a lot of fun.  A guess would be that the people involved thought a sequel to the sequel wasn't really necessary but if you're going to do it again, why not have some fun with it?

After seeing Man of Steel, which was long, somber, predictable, expensive and really kind of dull, I wasn't expecting a lot from Iron Man.  But I think a comparison is appropriate.  Both these movies cost millions and have state of the art effects.  Iron Man has some wonderful, funny exchanges between Tony Stark and the little kid (nothing like that in Superman) and of course the hilarious Mandarin who deserves a movie of his own.  Whereas Russell Crowe is wasted on corny Krypto-dialog and Diane Lane is hardly in Superman, in Iron Man, Ben Kingsley creates a new, totally incongruous character that people will remember even if they didn't like the movie.

5642793,4,B00BL1BJFW,"[THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE THEATRICAL RELEASE].

Ironman 3  ** MINOR SPOILERS **

First Impressions:  Though I was a bit disappointed that the storyline was not about Chinese megalomaniacs with 10 alien rings of power, I did enjoy the non-stop action and humor!

Storylines and Plot:  Well heck, you can read most of that on IMDB or other user reviews.  I will say that Tony Stark has to be the most prepared guy in the universe.

After further improvements in his armor and even getting to a point where the armor comes to him and parts of it can act independently, we find the only reason he's doing this is to immerse himself on what he does well - a mechanism for controlling is panic attacks!

We forget sometimes that Tony is just a guy.  A very smart guy but really behind that superior faade it must be a shock that there are aliens and gods in the universe and that he was barely able to hold his own with the technology that he has to hand.

Rather than being an advertisement for the earlier Avengers film (and that would be a natural conclusion, LOL), it's similar to Ironman 2 - an exploration into Tony the man.

I love the Marvel films because they are more than about the heroics.  This may fall flat with fan boys but the producers want a film that resonates with the general public, and Ironman 3 does just that.

Best Scenes:

Destruction of the Malibu home yet there is some pretty clever moves that ensure survival from a missile attack by black helicopters.

Mid-scene reveal of who The Mandarin really is (and no, he is not a Chinese dictator who has alien rings of power - dang it!) as he is surrounded by beauties.  Humorous bathroom scene.

The people that Tony dissed at a 1999 New Years' party and the resultant backlash 20 or so years later.  Some surprises.

Though it is scientifically impossible for the body to heat to 3000 degrees, the film made the idea somewhat plausible - the weaponization of scientific discoveries is not completely unheard-of.

Pepper Potts kicking some violent action!

Bottom Line:  Plenty of great action scenes - some ties to terrorism and the media's slavish reporting of it - and the power of what one man can do to either conquer the universe or conquer himself.

Recommended!

5642796,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man 3 follows on the events of Avengers Assemble. Tony Stark is trying to return to his normal life, but the stress of the attack on New York manifests itself in many sleepless nights and quite a few panic attacks. Sure, Tony can tackle problems like how to make his armor more compact and powerful but the problems of the soul are not his forte. He needs help. Being an alpha male, he doesn't really seek it until his back is against the wall.

A terrorist named the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has been bombing various places across America and the world, accusing Americans of deceit, arrogance, and greed. The hits finally come too close to home and Tony recklessly demands the Mandarin come fight him. After his posh cliff-side home (and almost everything he has) is destroyed, Tony has to rebuild his life from the ground up.

Meanwhile, Stark Industries and Pepper Potts are being courted by a scientific company, A.I.M., headed by Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). They are working on bio-tech but aren't too ethical about their practices. Killian had tried to get Tony in years before, but he hopes with new leadership at Stark Industries he can woo Pepper into a merger.

The story moves at a good pace and is quite interesting. The dialog is fresh and fast. Performances from the cast are good and the action scenes are exciting if not overly imaginative.

Fans of the comics might object to the handling of the Mandarin (who is well-played by Ben Kingsley) but I thought it was an interesting take on the character and worked well for the story. The theme it suggests could have been played up more in the film. The end of the film is a little robbed of drama by the more or less invincible bad guys fighting Tony and his army of Iron Man suits (which we saw in the trailer). Other parts of the ending just don't make sense. It's as if they used up the movie's quota of smarts in the first two thirds of the film.

All in all, Iron Man 3 is a fun summer action film. It could have been smarter for my tastes but it's enjoyable nonetheless.",1371945600,9,2048,4.494623655913978

5642808,3,B00BL1BJFW,"The people who made this movie purposefully removed many of the things which make Iron Man so compelling. Everyone knows the coolest thing about Iron Man is Iron Man himself, Tony Stark in his armor, doing cool things and saving the day. Yet for most of this movie Tony is either not in armor at all or, when he is, it is flimsy, faulty test armor. Another cool thing about Iron Man is Tony is the only Iron Man. They ruined that by putting all kinds of people in the armor and even letting the armor itself become a character, flying around and saving the day all by itself. Apparently Iron Man himself is not only not unique or special, he himself is not even needed. Early on it seemed as if they had at least gotten the idea of having a credibly formidable adversary right but in the end that too turned out to be an empty suit. Every concept gets off to a promising start then is quickly neutered as if the third installment were diagnosed with low testosterone.

In short they took the three most important concepts for a good Iron Man film and completely gutted them. Watch this if you are a true fan, consider any Iron Man movie a 'can't miss', and are prepared to feel somewhat let down rather than exhilarated at the end.

Iron Man 3 was every bit as good as I was hoping for. There was a lot of intense action, some really funny lines and another look at an aspect of Tony Stark that makes him even more relatable as a person. The essence of Tony Stark/Iron Man from the comics is still there in the movie. Sure, there were some twists that some may not have enjoyed. But when fleshed out were really funny.

If a film was made in 3D, it costs the studio absolutely no more to put it in 3d on a bluray,  or 2d. The cost of the film remains the same,  and the manufacture of the disk is the same process,  the information is all digital in most new movies,  so why is Disney charging such a premium?  It seems to me they are simply trying to keep 3D from selling to most consumers. The disks are dirt cheap to manufacture,  so actual cost is a lie, my only explanation is they don't want 3d to go mainstream,  they don't want the average family on a budget buying 3d, or even considering it.

5642816,3,B00BL1BJFW,"I loved Iron Man I and II, and was really looking forward to Iron Man III.  While it was not a complete waste of time, it definitely was not nearly as enjoyable as the previous films, and was a huge letdown as the first followup to The Avengers.  It was not necessarily a bad movie so much as it was not the movie I, and I assume many others, wanted it to be.

This movie focuses largely on the character development of Tony Stark and his personal struggle to deal with events and the enormous responsibilities that come with his power.  That is all fine and good, but what I wanted to see in an Iron Man movie is (1) Iron Man and (2) Tony Stark being his trademark snarky jerk self.  Instead the vast majority of the movie consists of Tony Stark moping around and having deep, meaningful realizations about his life.  Again, I'm not saying that kind of movie is bad, but it's not what I was wanting to see in a comic book superhero movie.  Seriously, who wants to watch a movie about Tony Stark struggling to deal with anxiety attacks?

In short, this movie suffers from the same flaw as The Dark Knight Rises, namely that the costumed superhero has ridiculously little screentime.  The Dark Knight Rises might just as well have been called Bruce Wayne: The Movie, and Iron Man III might just as well been called The Emotional Struggles of Tony Stark.  I could care less about the absurd plot holes and contractions to previous movies.

5642828,4,B00BL1BJFW,"The ""Iron Man"" series has been like a shot of adrenaline into the superhero movie franchise.  It had one of the best `origin story' films ever (equal with `Batman Begins') and, even when its sequel was underwhelming (as it was with ""Iron Man 2""), it is still a lot of fun.

  ""Iron Man 3"" steps up the sequel game a notch.  While it doesn't quite reach the excellence of the first film, it is an improvement over the second.  The third installment doesn't pick up at the end of ""Iron Man 2"".  Instead, it follows the events from 2012's epic blockbuster, ""The Avengers"", as Tony Stark makes repeated reference to events of the `Battle of New York' causing him problems with sleeping.

  In ""Iron Man 3"", Tony obsesses with building more Iron Man suits in preparation for the next big threat, to the constant irritation of girlfriend, Pepper Potts.  The next threat is very real due to a series of terrorist attacks executed by a shadowy figure known as the Mandarin.  On the front line of these assaults are a series of genetically engineered super-soldiers who posses enormous recuperative powers.  Tony Stark's first attempt to stand up to the Mandarin backfires horribly, forcing Tony to go on the lam to try and keep the people close to him safe while he investigates the source of the attacks and formulates a response.

  ""Iron Man 3"" has added to an incredibly strong cast with Sir Ben Kingsley portraying the Mandarin and Guy Pearce as the once nerdy, but now suave, Aldrich Killian, whose chance meeting with Stark 13 years earlier had a profound impact on each.

  Robert Downey, Jr. continues to `own' Iron Man and Tony Stark.  After having enjoyed his performances over several films, it's hard to imagine anyone else so perfectly encompassing Stark's combination of arrogance, insecurity and thirst for justice.  Gwyneth Paltrow still remains solid as Pepper Potts.  And, while I do like Don Cheadle as an actor, I still think Terrence Howard was a better fit as Rhodie.  It's a shame whatever dispute that kept Howard out of the sequels could not be resolved.

  All in all, the action is as good as in any of the ""Iron Man"" films.  Unlike ""Iron Man 2"", the threat-level is much higher and more palpable.  This is definitely a worthwhile summer blockbuster.",1370908800,41,2270,4.736572890025576

5642833,1,B00BL1BJFW,"The first Iron Man movie was a pleasant surprise to me, most of the movie tried to be realistic in the context of the kind of superhero that Iron Man is, this is something that i guess we all owe to the last Batman trilogy. Unfortunately this third Iron Man movie broke with that new standard and depicts situations on which i was like ""no way, that's silly!"".

SPOILER ALERT, where can I start? Let's be realistic, the superpowers that Killian and his sidekicks develop from just an injection are plain ridiculous (FIREBREATHING? REALLY???), COMMON!! they could have come with something smarter than that! Now the whole smart-suit-parts-that-seek-for-Tony thing is also over the roof. I also hated that in order to try to give a spectacular twist to the movie they wasted Ben Kingsley's ""Mandarin"" character, he could have been a super sinister Joker-like villain... sometimes simpler is better, I am actually surprised that such an excellent actor as Kingsley agreed to that degrading roll. How about a deeper development of Iron Patriot's character with interaction between him and Iron Man? maybe some conflict between them, that could have worked. And, what happened with the Iron Man suit's strength? it seemed like Tony Stark in a move to cut costs outsourced the manufacturing of the armour to China, as easy as the armour was destroyed in several parts of the movie even me myself could have defeated Iron Man just with a can opener. It is also unfortunate that the suits are already autonomous and do not need an actual human inside of them, with this what's the point on Tony Stark risking his life inside an armour? he could retire to Bali and control his suit army from a beach bench with a pina colada in one hand, they took away the human component to Iron Man and that breaks with the essence of Iron Man.

Beneath the good things were the great special effects and of course Robert Downey's excellent Tony Stark characterization. Unfortunately since the first Iron Man movie was such a good movie the studio knows that we are going to see the new ones no matter if the plot is garbage.",1370736000,14,2102,4.740437158469946

5642836,3,B00BL1BJFW,"SPOILER ALERT!

I realize as I write this that I have not submitted reviews for either of the other two Iron Man movies or the Avengers tie in movie - all three of which I loved.  This was an enjoyable movie also and I am not disappointed that I went to see it, but it was certainly not the best of them and is probably the worst of the four (counting the Avengers).

There were lots of good things in the movie.  Robert Downey, Jr. continues to prove that the rebirth of his career (after rehab) is not a fluke. I love to watch him act (as both Tony Stark and as Sherlock Holmes). I also loved that Tony Stark suffered from severe PTSD resulting from the Avengers movie.  That was a neat tie-in.  Also, the special effects were as good as always.  I even liked the fact that Pepper Potts became one of the heroes at the end of the movie, but that was too easily foreseeable the moment Killian (Guy Pierce) injected her with the formula and was even more so foreseeable when she fell into the fire.

There were, however, just as many disappointing things as well. (SPOILER) Tony gets his chest piece removed?  Really?  I hated that.  I also hated the whole drone army thing with the suits.  Jarvis may be a really good AI, but somehow I doubt he could have controlled all of those suits in battle... too SkyNet for me... perhaps too Deux Ex Machina... and definitely too over the top.  Guy Pierce continued to be a problem for me personally... I just couldn't watch him without thinking of HG Wells and The Time Machine- but maybe that is my personal problem.  Similarly, I just thought the fire breathing aspect of his character was just ridiculous.  It didn't work for me. Finally, there just wasn't enough Iron Man for my taste.  It was supposed to be an Iron Man movie.  Instead, it was a Tony Stark movie with a little Iron Man and a lot of Jarvis thrown in.  Sure, Tony Stark is Iron Man... but if that is the case then make it so.

5642838,5,B00BL1BJFW,"I remember being a child reading Marvel comic books by the dozens.  I'm going to get a little nostalgic now, so if you're just interested in a review of the film, move on to the next paragraph.  I'd go to comic books stores weekly to get my favorite issues and become immersed in the stories and the artwork.  The static images were vibrant in my mind, and occasionally as I imagined the action between the comic panels, I'd ponder how glorious it would be to see my favorite heroes come to life.  It seemed like a pipe dream, but now it seems that the day has actually come.  Iron Man 3 represents the eighth spectacular achievement in the Avengers vein by Marvel studios as they revolutionize the concept of the film franchise.  The cinematic universe that Marvel studios has created achieves a detailed serial nature usually reserved for complex television dramas.  The success of these films is often attributed to their effects and unyielding action.  Nevertheless, the greatest titles, Iron Man 3 being one of them, deserve their status because of clever writing and character development.

Iron Man 3 finally finds the suited up superhero, Tony Stark pitted against his greatest nemesis, The Mandarin.  While Iron Man's battle with The Mandarin in the comics dates back to 1964, The Mandarin's role in Iron Man's cinematic adventures has only been hinted at in the previous two films.  Thanks to clever and creative writing from director Shane Black and screenwriter Drew Pearce as well as a superb performance by the great Ben Kingsley, The Mandarin was well worth the wait...and that's all I'll say.

For the sake of keeping Iron Man 3's impact in tact, plot should be discussed minimally.  What can be said is that a new terrorist, The Mandarin is violently attacking America in order to expose what he believes is a hypocritical and offensive ideology shared by the American people.  At one point, Stark mentions that he ""sounds like a Baptist minister,"" suggesting perhaps that he's using ""crisis"" as a way to force decision, a controversial Baptist philosophy.  It gets personal when Stark's head of security, Happy Hogan (played again by Iron Man 1 & 2 director, Jon Favreau) is seriously injured in one of The Mandarin's attacks.  There is much more to the story including a minor flashback to 1999 where Stark is just hitting his stride.  It is there that he meets bourgeoning scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and ""botanist"" Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), and again...that's all I'll say.

Iron Man 3 is a very smartly made film, and while it still addresses comic book staple themes like good/evil, identity, revenge, and freedom, an emergent theme can also be extracted from it - learning from mistakes.  Film series usually start to run out of steam by the third part, with few exceptions.  A third film in a series tends to be darker and excessive in regards to whatever made the first two work be it action, villains, or some sort of familiar formula.  Iron Man 3 learns from others' mistakes and avoids them.  In fact, it can be said that this film acts as a ""how-to"" manual on freshening up conventions.  In scenes where the hero is captured by henchmen who are normally silent and sinister, Shane Black and Drew Pearce devise witty and even humorous dialogue that makes those scenes enjoyable.  At one point, Iron Man must team up with a child, a move that often results in schmaltzy sentimentality, yet in the hands of Black and Pearce it works.  By the end of Iron Man 3, it is clear that these film makers are thinking quite a few moves ahead and have no intention of letting the audience down at any point.  The film has fun with Stark's Iron Man identity being public knowledge and various nods to The Avengers add another level of substance and self-referential fun.  Robert Downey Jr. has certainly found a home in his role as Stark/Iron Man.  This installment is his best as he tactfully and authentically balances humor, intensity, and sentimentality without ever missing a beat.

Other favorites are back as well including Rhodey (Don Cheadle) formally War Machine, now dubbed the Iron Patriot and Stark's reliable CFO/lover Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  The other star of this film is the Iron Man suit itself.  JARVIS and the suit have made some exciting and enjoyable upgrades that are quite central to the evolution of the story.  Iron Man 3 is another excellent entry into an ever-blooming genre of film.  It is entertaining, gratifying, and most of all - clever. A

Iron Man 3 is rated PG-13 with a running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes.  It should be seen in 2D rather than 3D as nothing is gained from the 3D transfer.  Also, as with every Marvel film, stay through the credits!",1370131200,3,4727,4.771217712177122

5642846,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Following on the heels of one of the greatest superhero films (The Avengers) ever, Iron Man 3 had the daunting task of being the first film to initiate Phase 2 of the next set of Marvel films.  Add to that the fact that third acts rarely do well in these individual film series (Spiderman 3, X-Men 3).  Directed this time by Shane Black, (former director Jon Favreau still plays bodyguard Happy Hogan), there was every reason to believe that this installment would fall short of expectations. Surprisingly, this film is pretty good and benefits from a strong plot and the usual Robert Downey Jr. performance.  By keeping the audience guessing, this action packed film not only kick starts the next set of films in the Marvel plan, but sets new expectations going forward in the series.

Tony Stark (Downey) has been traumatized by his near death experience in The Avengers with a little help from his friends and must contend with trying to find some normalcy in his life, and that includes his relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Stark recalls a past relationship with a female scientist, whose potentially revolutionary, regenerative process called Extremis is found to have explosive side effects.  At the same time, a young genius name Aldrich (Guy Pierce) proposes an idea for high tech think tank, Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.), which will later have severe implications.  Further, a terrorist named The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is hijacking the airwaves and threatening catastrophic events. Are these events related?  The story takes Stark out of his comfort zone and drops him in a nowhere town in Tennessee, and he is thus forced to improvise, relying upon his skills and wit to battle a formidable opponent while forging an unlikely bond with a local boy.  A deadly, convoluted plot begins to take shape which has far reaching consequences to not only Stark's home but the world.

Downey owns this character, and he gets nice support from Paltrow in an expanded role.  Pierce makes a worthy antagonist with tricks up his sleeve so to speak, and Kingsley is a hoot playing up his mysterious role as The Mandarin.  Paul Bettany again amusingly voices Stark's computer Jarvis.

Shane Black's talent was notable in the screenplay for Lethal Weapon, and it shows in the dialogue especially between Stark and Pepper and his interactions with the boy.  He also was astute enough to challenge his main character by stripping him of his closest allies (no sign of S.H.I.E.L.D either) and his armor and stranding him in the middle of nowhere.

What set Marvel characters apart from most other super hero comics was that they experienced real, personal problems, and that, combined with a real threat, formed an emotional response from the audience.  It's nice for comic book fans to see the Marvel films incorporate the established comic book lore including A.I.M. and pushing the ante on supporting characters like Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as The Iron Patriot.  At times you feel a bit of James Bond influence and then a bit of The X-Files which is not bad thing.

There are some clever plot twists and unexpected surprises in characters including one revelation that may upset some comic book purists.  The standout highlight is a spectacular action sequence in midair as Air Force One is attacked and its passengers are thrown out helplessly.  What's a superhero to do?  The result is a terrific, beautifully shot maneuver that raises hairs.  Then there is that magnificent armor that Start is constantly perfecting to the point that he can remotely get suited up by sections.  Special visual effects are top of the line as witnessed in the pyrotechnic climax at a shipyard.

Not content to paint by numbers, Black and Downey have fashioned an entertaining, superior third film that is almost as good as Iron Man 1.  There's a certain finality in the way it ends which makes one wonder how will they do another Iron Man film.  This is Downey's last contractual Iron Man for now and it would be a shame to deny fans another go at a fascinating character especially with The Avengers 2 in the not too distant horizon.

So we now see Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) going through a whole line of problems. Sure, he flew up into a wormhole in the Avengers to save New York. But now he can't really sleep at some times in the movie. And the villain in this film is the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and now Tony may need to come back and stop this guy to save the day again. In other news, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is trying to avoid the clutches of the Extremis project that was formed by her former lover Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who is trying to get her back.

If your only experience with Iron Man has been the movies, you will likely enjoy this movie.  Not as much as the first and probably more than the second, but you'll like it.

However, if you are a fan of the character and are aware of the history of Iron Man, you will HATE the movie.

In the first movie, I was willing to overlook the changes made for artistic license and to help make a decent movie and franchise.  When the second movie came out, I was disturbed by the continued changes and poor choice of directions the movie took.

But, this movie and especially the big ""twist"" had me wanting to throw my popcorn at the screen and leave the theater.

Overall, this movie felt rushed, predictable and poorly written.",1369440000,8,769,4.45
5642863,4,B00BL1BJFW,"I am openly conflicted about ""Iron Man 3."" On one hand, I am desperately trying to achieve objectivism in my review. I enjoyed it. It had a solid plot, it tied wonderfully to Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers,"" and a majority of its special effects are a technical marvel. I thought that the casting was superb, and personally the inclusion of Sir Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce always make a filmbetter. All-in-all, the quality of the film sits snugly between the first and the second Iron Man films.

However, on the other hand, I was incredibly dismayed to learn that, ""Iron Man 3"" would be Robert Downey, Jr's last standalone Iron Man film. In this context, ""Iron Man 3"" disappoints. It doesn't invoke the same sense of finality that I experienced when watching Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Rises."" ""Iron Man 3"" felt like a strong mid-entry to the series, but not the epic conclusion that should be expected from the franchise. However, it has been pointed out to me that Robert Downey Jr. will reprising his role for ""The Avengers 2,"" so maybe a more adequate `conclusion' to Iron Man will present itself within the confines of an Avengers film.

Personal reservations aside, ""Iron Man 3"" is a topnotch Marvel film. It dives into the character by making Iron Man fallible, resulting in a two-hour character exploration--One of both his weaknesses and strengths. The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley) and the founder of A.I.M. (Aldrich Killian played by Guy Pearce) are excellent villains and far superior than ""Iron Man 2's"" subpar Whiplash (Mickey Rourke). I also enjoyed Marvel Studios' deviation from the more-famous Iron Man comic book plots. It held true to the character (for the most part), but was removed enough to surprise comic book and films fans alike.

I thought that the special effects were top notch, save for the fire effects used for the A.I.M. henchmen. The were starkly different from the other special effect heavy scenes, which made them appear dated and cheap. The end sequence was gorgeously rendered and nearly all of the scenes involving the Iron Man armor were meticulously dazzling; they were fluid and excellently scripted.

My only complaint, besides the shoddy A.I.M. fire effects, is that Stark seems to break character towards the end of the movie. The script alters the very core of the character's personality, and it as-if the exploratory elements of the film override the source of Iron Man. I am curious to see if Joss Whedon carries this new `Tony Stark' into ""The Avengers 2,"" or decides to follow a more comic book-like rendition of the character that was presented to audiences in the first two Iron Man films. Whedon will be struggling between cohesion and character integrity, but with his directing and writing chops I am sure a happy median exists.

Overall, ""Iron Man 3"" is a good film. It is better than the last and is on par with the other Marvel Universe films. Besides my own comic book snobbiness and reluctance to see Robert Downey, Jr. leave the mantle, ""Iron Man 3"" is more than worth the price of a couple of movie stubs.

They seem to have concentrated so much on the action that they didn't take the time to develop a solid story. I realize this is all comic book fiction, but I still expect a certain level of realism in a super hero movie where I don't have to turn my brain completely off. Good action, poor story.",1369353600,,397,4.037974683544304
5642865,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Perhaps it is because I walked into this film with low expectations due to a lackluster second film but I was delightfully surprised with this third installment in Marvel's Iron Man franchise.

Shane Black takes over the directorial role from Jon Favreau, who was in charge of the first two films, and he brings the fresh approach that this series needed.  After being bogged down by the suits, suits, and more suits approach of the second film, I was relieved to find that this installment (other than one, I'll admit, major plot point) pulls focus from that aspect.

Here we see Tony Stark a mess after the ""New York incident"" (of The Avengers).  He's psychologically vulnerable, arguably more than we've seen since he was kidnapped in the original film.  We see Iron Man take the backseat and Tony take center stage.  He's put in the position where he must rely on his own tech-prowess; Tony is the underdog once again.  Seeing his human side was great but coupled with that was more of a spotlight on those individuals around him.  Walking out of the theater, I felt I had seen a movie in which Pepper Potts, Happy Hogan, and Lt. Col. Rhodes are heroes as much as Stark himself.

In that regard, all of the actors involved here brought their A-game.  While I felt that Favreau's Happy got a bit too much screen time (likely due to his removal, willing or otherwise, from the director's chair), I was pleased to see Happy taken at least a bit more seriously as a character - and without taking away his role as comic relief.  Robert Downey Jr. really delivers the comedy here too.  In the second installment, it seemed as if he was hamming it up too much.  The comedy was physical but absurd and much too over the top.  Here, it's done with some more taste and to great effect.

I've heard complaints about the somewhat controversial twist in the film but I didn't have any problems with it.  As far as I'm concerned, it kept things interesting.  I'm glad that they made changes from the original ""Extremis"" storyline, as it allowed even individuals who regularly read the comics to still be surprised and, hopefully, entertained.

These are just my thoughts.  Some of the people I saw the film with were not as taken with it as I.  So really, the most important thing is for you to see it and decide for yourself.  At the very least, it's an improvement over the second.  In my mind, it rests somewhere very close to the top of the Marvel pile.  They'll have a tough time coming up with an equal to this.",1369267200,4,2508,4.524444444444445

Did it follow the comic book religiously?  I have no idea, nor do I care.  RDJ nailed it this time boys and girls.  It's worth seeing!

An evil mastermind terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is wreaking havoc via a rash of bombings, holding the world in his grip. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) gets on the case and discovers the bombings are initiated by people exposed to the Extremis program, something Stark Industries could've had ties to a long time ago, but chose not to. Turns out those Tony Stark knew back then are neck-deep involved with what's going on now, have re-entered his life, and are making things complicated.

While trying to pinpoint the location of the Mandarin, Iron Man aka Tony is also dealing with the aftermath of the Chitauri invasion of New York in The Avengers. Having trouble sleeping, he's been spending all his time constructing various Iron Man armors to help himself cope. This brings tension to his relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who he's now living with and is dedicated to.

Upon discovering the location of the Mandarin and his true identity, Iron Man and his almost-sidekick the Iron Patriot aka War Machine aka Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) head up against a battalion of Extremis-infected warriors and must pull out all the stops to put an end to their reign of terror. The problem is these Extremis soldiers are so powerful that victory doesn't seem likely.

Can Iron Man prevail against an army as strong as he is?

I'm not sure what to make of this movie. Sure, it was entertaining and the storyline was fine. I like the idea of making it a direct follow up to The Avengers, and showing how Tony Stark's world--never mind the rest of the world--had been affected by the Chitauri invasion and the presence of the other Avengers.

This flick was loaded with solid action, tough bad guys, cool tech, guns and everything else that makes an Iron Man movie a lot of fun. I just wasn't sold on the presentation. This might be harsh, but this flick came off as the Batman Forever of the Iron Man movies. I'm all for humor in even the most serious of movies, but it seemed the jokes were either too forced or too slapstick to make me take this flick seriously. And that's the secret with superhero movies: they need to take themselves seriously--even if they're meant to be a comedy--otherwise they'll never work. There was an awful lot of getting in and out of the Iron Man suits in this film, both by Tony and Rhodey, never mind Pepper getting a shot at wearing it, the President, the Extremis guy--there were so many suit changes that the novelty of watching someone don the Iron Man was quickly spent after the first three times.

This film was not directed by Jon Favreau, which might have had something to do with it. Just seems this movie was weighed down with not enough Iron Man and a storyline--which was solid in and of itself--that moved slowly. I realize Tony's aftermath and post-traumatic stress from The Avengers was the focus, but the same goal could've been accomplished had there been more Iron Man. I don't necessarily mean more action--as action-filled movies that are nothing but explosions start to finish get boring after a while--but perhaps him having a love/hate relationship with the suit because being in it nearly killed him at the end of The Avengers, or maybe take the robo-injections to summon the suit to a new level because he's trying to make himself super to be on par with guys like Captain America or Thor and have him deal with that?

The extra scene at the end of the credits with Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) picked up on the bromance from The Avengers. A nice touch. Didn't move the Marvel cinematic universe forward in any way, but was a nice touch.

If you're a Marvel movie completest, then by all means, check it out. Likewise, pick up the Blu-ray when it comes out to complete your set. For me, I think I'm going to have watch it again and perhaps I'll warm up to it a bit more. I felt let down when I watched the first Spider-Man in 2002, but got more into it with subsequent viewings. Iron Man 3 might be one of those movies.

Just think they could've done a lot more with it.",1369180800,5,4084,4.582191780821918
5642879,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man 3 was absolutely fantastic.  The change in directors does mean there's some difference in style.  Shane Black loves a bit of narration and has different taste in music than Jon Favreau.  (I missed the classic rock.)  But there doesn't seem to be any animosity in the changeover.  In fact, Favreau's role as bodyguard Happy Hogan was expanded.

But perhaps the biggest change in Iron Man 3 is that it's not all about Tony Stark.  (Although, in the end, it is.)

Much like Favreau, Don Cheadle gets a bigger part to play.  I'm am fully in favor of that, because Cheadle is terrific as Colonel Rhodes.  He's a good guy, but not a boring one.  And when given more screen time, Cheadle imbues Rhodey with enough of a sense of fun that you believe he and Tony Stark could be best friends.

And speaking of cast chemistry, Gwynth Paltrow continues to have tons with Robert Downey, Jr.  Her Pepper Potts is competent, compassionate, forgiving, but not a pushover.  She's firm and has zero time for b.s. from her boyfriend or monologuing villains.  I don't care how you feel about Paltrow; I can't imagine anyone else in the role.

Same goes for RDJ, who really plays up Tony's vulnerability after sacrificing himself in The Avengers.  He's faced tough situations before, but deliberately choosing to die really did a number on his psyche.  It leads to some great scenes when Tony teams up with a kid who can't keep his mouth shut around a real live superhero.

Of course, summer blockbusters and superhero films are all about the big fight scenes.  Iron Man 3 lives up to any expectations I had on that count.  The final battle is kinetic and visually delightful and still allows for some nice character beats.  I would've left the theater with a smile on my face even if the falling action wasn't just as terrific.

Iron Man fans, don't miss this one.  And, like all Marvel films, be sure to stay till after the credits.",1369180800,3,1922,4.601769911504425
5642880,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Obviously one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the year. It's always very important for any movie in a franchise to do well after a big movie, such as the event that was ""The Avengers"". But IM3 totally exceeded the expectations and proved that we fans had nothing to worry about. It combines all the best things from the previous two Iron Man films, with a story and a cast that was still original enough to make for a great movie. Also, the entire Iron Man franchise is very rooted in the ideas of self-destruction and regret. Therefore, if you pay attention to these themes in all three films, then you notice a progressive full-circle kind of thing. The first Iron Man introduced us to the character of Tony Stark and his genius, but there were slight implications of self-destruction in that if he didn't figure out something to do with all of his money and technology, then he would never be able to make up for all the mistakes he made as a weapons supplier/dealer. In IM2, he absolutely has to figure out how to fix his relationships with others and the problem with his arc reactor, or he will most certainly die and regret how he didn't fix them. And now, in Iron Man 3, his obsession with building all these different suits and using them to save the world has finally come back around to bite him in the butt, and he has to figure how to fix it all by himself. This leads to some very welcome flashbacks from Tony's experiences in ""The Avengers"". The film's big twist is surprising and very well thought out/set up. Others have said that this totally eliminates the entire idea of the villain, but the film makes it clear that the villian still exists within the film, just in an unexpected way. Besides, when anyone feels that the physical villain of the film does not satisfy, they can always rely on that self-destructive factor of Tony himself. That is also a villain, even if it's just in the metaphorical sense. Shane Black's direction makes sure there is a definite balance between action, great emotion/feeling, and some comedy. At times in the film, all of these things will exist in one scene, usually one right after the other. Unsurprisingly, RDJ turns in a terrific job once again. The rest of the cast also does a great job, especially Paltrow and Pearce. IM3 also doesn't disappoint in the general sense of the franchise. While Iron Man was and still is a great movie, Iron Man 2 was all over the place and never did really find a central theme, but there were certain parts of it that were very good and somewhat made up for where it fell short. Now, Iron Man 3 has absolutely wowed the socks off all its appreciative fans, and still is, according to the box office numbers. It featured what we loved from the first Iron Man in spades, while still kicking all of that up a notch with a much stronger central theme.

5642884,3,B00BL1BJFW,"I am not entirely sure where to begin my review. Iron Man 3 starts off unusually with our favorite hero Tony Stark/Iron Man narrating in the film. And honestly I immediately had a flashback to how Spider man 3 started off and when I heard Tony Stark narrate I was worried. I gave Iron Man 3 a chance and while I would not call the movie itself a waste of time or complete garbage, It was a little disappointing. Yes this will be one of my first bad reviews unfortunately. Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Don Cheadle, return and I think they all did a great job portraying Tony, Pepper, and Rhodey. Now on to the new additions: we have Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen, and Ben Kingsley as Mandarin. They all did good in the movie. And with such a big cast you may be wondering why Iron Man 3 is getting so much criticism? Well here it goes.

I am not the biggest Iron Man fan, but the problem with Iron Man 3 is that the cons outweigh the FEW pros it has. Starting with the much talked about ""twist"". God I really hated the twist in Iron Man 3. It was really childish, surprising, entirely unecessary, and just plain wrong. It just made the movie a lot worse. Another problem:IRON MAN was not in the movie enough. Sure Tony Stark's presence is Constant; but this is a SUPERHERO movie. The script was also rather...lazy in some aspect. The movie has its moments, but ultimately it just doesnt have that WOW factor that we are so used to with Marvel movies. Now on to some pros.

Say what you want, but Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow have great chemistry. And it does show in Iron Man 3. Which takes me to my next statement: despite the flaws that are present in this movie, Iron Man 3 is more serious and SOMEWHAT more thrilling than Iron Man 2. And finally, I am glad this movie was not any longer than what it was because it could have been a even BIGGER mistake for the movie. It should come as no surprise that I myself will be in NO rush to buy this when it comes out on dvd. I think the question that is on everyone's mind is: do we need/want an Iron Man 4? Sure but please bring the WOW factor and make a better movie the next time around. Seriously.

Iron Man 3 is no 5 star movie, and it is not even a 4 star movie strangely enough. But in my opinion Iron Man 3, whether you love it or hate it, gets:

A sapping story line with a kid of course teaching him the way, a very forgettable villain with no personality and a great many one line zingers.  I loved the Avengers, but this follow up was pure garbage.",1369008000,11,337,4.25
5642886,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Good movie. Could have been great. Those of us who have grown up on Marvel understand the wisdom of Stan Lee when he stated,  ""Spider-Man is, and always has been, at the center of the Marvel Universe, but it's success does not come from Spider-Man; rather, this is truly the story of Peter Parker... Peter is the foundation and the very heart of Marvel"" (Paraphrased). I believe this truth is understood by many, but is sometimes overlooked by the movie industry. Certainly, I believe Christopher Nolan nailed it with the Batman trilogy. Remember how long it took to develop characters, and not just the headliners. Each character had time devoted to them, including the thugs, the detectives, the mayor etc. This is not an easy task, and with precious screen time, directors have to edit and cut portions they devoted great resources to. Still, Nolan both ""got it"" and even better, he ""did it"". The Dark Knight is one of the best movies ever made, and should be a required course for up and coming directors. The true depth of the movie is not from special effects- it comes from character development, which of course requires great acting and a genius script. (Bullseye on both!)
...Despite the mistakes of Iron-Man 2, this third offering had several great opportunities to do the same, but ultimately blew it. Here are two riveting character developments- character maturing themes:
... 1. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts love for one another. It grew throughout 1 and 2, but was not given enough time nor ""heart"" in 3. Simply put- they didn't slow down the action and let them interact so that we could get to know them as a couple. Compare and contrast this with Peter and Mary Jane in Spidey 1 and 2. GREAT MOVIES, with deep, interesting, and even ""real"" issues that ALL couples face. They grew to know one another, but Sam Rami knew this would take time, and he indeed gave them plenty of screen time to do this: to tease each other, to cry, to misunderstand, to laugh, to sorrow, and ultimately, to grow individually and together! (Read Ecclesiastes- ""there is a season..."") Think about how many ""un-rushed"" wonderful scenes Sam devoted to them: behind their homes after MJ's father demeans his daughter; their frequent ""coincidental"" encounters- yes I know he was in costume, but you felt the heart of Peter and MJ at all times; the encounter in the cafe, interrupted by a car thrown through the window- NOTE, WHAT REALLY MADE THAT SCENE SO WONDERFUL? (Hint- it wasn't the car nor the 8 limbed villain!) Great script- great acting!
...2. Tony Starks anxiety- his post traumatic stress. Yes- it's a wonderful opportunity to understand Tony Stark... not Iron-Man. Once again, the concept was great, but the scenes felt rushed. I never felt his anxiety, and a great film maker could have done that to me. (More slower... flashbacks?)
....For me, these two great story lines, his loving relationship with Pepper and his severe anxiety condition are a ""match made in heaven""- they are absolutely perfect for each other. Yes, they got it right in concept, but didn't take the screen time to slow down and let this wash over us. I struggle with anxiety, and I only make it some days because of the wonderful woman in my life- my wife of 33 years. Put another way- why did we not see them together more. Guys, you should have given us more of that, and junk 80% of the ""Iron-Man remotes"" at the end. The climax was kind of silly- we were looking for something richer- more endearing.... more human. less robotic... something that wouldn't ""rust"" like iron.
...SPOILER ALERT- DO NOT READ WHAT FOLLOWS IF YOU HAVE YET TO SEE THE MOVIE. One last opinion: The ""twist"" regarding the Mandarin was brilliant. I never saw it coming! Hilarious, well acted, and really, really clever!
...ADD YOUR COMMENTS BY LISTING SUPER-HERO MOVIES THAT GOT IT RIGHT: Where the movie was about the man or woman behind the costume.",1369008000,6,3904,4.741176470588235
5642887,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Warning: here be spoilers.

Iron Man 3 sets out to return Iron Man to his roots of dark, believable action established in the first movie, while retaining the big-spectacle adventure of Avengers. To that end we see Tony Stark face off against a peculiar new representation of the Mandarin, a snarling, ethnically nebulous terrorist ringleader portrayed by Ben Kingsly. After an exasperated Stark promises to end the Mandarin's reign of terror, the mastermind seemingly orders the destruction of Stark's house, setting him on a quest to locate the Mandarin through an entertaining combination of detective work and MacGuyver-esque trickery. Stark is opposed by an army of mysterious flunkies who have been granted superpowers by Extremis, a genetic modification originally meant to help the disabled (as opposed to military nanites as in the comic).

Viewers have made much of this film's twist- that the Mandarin is in fact a puppet of the real villain, AIM director Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who has hired a degenerate English actor to portray a power-mad despot as part of a political misdirection. This was a polarizing twist- for those who are new to the franchise it is a clever, Shyamalan-esque turn, and for serious comic nerds, it's an unexpected twist that is not out of line with the spirit of the franchise. For many, however, the reveal that the Mandarin was not in fact his usual Ming-the-Merciless-esque self, or even real, was a huge disappointment. For me the twist worked- I was disappointed at how generic and ridiculously grimdark the Mandarin initially appeared, but the reveal that he was a fiction- and not a very bad guy in reality- was something I did not expect. One can also read the twist as something of a satire of Ben Kingsly's career, which has been heavily built on playing ethnic and foreign characters, just as his filmic alter-ego does.

Another point of contention is that Iron Man spends so much of the film outside his armor. I would assert that this is important- by pitting the largely average Tony Stark against the super-powered AIM operatives who obstruct him we see him acting as a hero without the crutch of dominating technology. It makes for a refreshing reminder that under the armor there is still a hero we can root for.

Although it's not as BIG of a movie as Avengers, Iron Man 3 succeeds at being a thriller, and action film, and just a bit funny all at once. It rekindles the new, fresh feel of the first movie in a way that the second missed, and develops all of its characters in entertaining, satisfying directions. Of particular note is Ty Simpkins as Harley, a bratty sidekick who attaches himself limpet-like to the unwilling Tony. I am always leery of kids in movies of this kind, but he's spot on. It's also hard to fault Shane Black, who blends 90s directorial sensibilities with modern FX and camerawork to create a movie that feels different from its predecessors and from the rest of the MCU. Among other things, Black dials back on the CG of Avengers with numerous effective practical effects (I could swear I spotted a cable when Iron Man rescues the crew of Air Force 1, though) and excellent set design and lighting throughout.

Were I to complain about any part of the film, it would be the character of Tony's friend James Rhodes, AKA War Machine (Don Cheadle once again). Back when he was Terrance Howard, Rhody didn't even GET to be War machine, and he was only limited in the second film. Here once again the producers seem concerned that audiences will be confused by the presence of two Iron men, as War Machine spends most of his time out-of-scene, and participates in the climax out of his armor. I love Cheadle's take on the character, and would have loved to see him get a better part as what we DO see is well in line with the character as he appears in other media.

PROS:
-Unique direction makes for a film that feels genuinely different from the other coming attractions
-Good acting from a pretty diverse cast of characters
-Recaptures the feel of the first Iron Man

CONS:
-Editing is sloppy in some places
-Soundtrack is not particularly memorable

FINAL THOUGHTS:
Iron Man 3 is a worthwhile entry in MCU canon, and its departures from the comics are justifiable as part of building the film.",1368921600,4,4284,4.764150943396227
5642888,5,B00BL1BJFW,"After the events in The Avengers it's a more uncertain and weakened Tony Stark that we see in Iron Man 3.  The arrogance is still there but it's tempered with fear of the future and what the great unknown might bring back to Earth.  His fear of keeping his lady love Pepper Potts safe has him up nights making The Suit even better.  Needless to say, sleepless nights equals a Tony showing some serious moments of anxiety which make him all the more human and demonstrates that he IS NOT Iron Man, at least not entirely.

After its explosive opening salvo we're given a flashback montage of Tony's earlier wilder days (with a recognizable face or two that made me go aaawwwwwww) and his knowledge of some important medical research which brings us back to the now and a madman named The Mandarin, who's holding the world hostage through random bombings and overall fear.  His actions are a smokescreen to something even bigger and it's up to Tony to figure out what it is.  With The Suit out of the picture for a period of time Tony must rely on his mind and the creativeness that made him a millionaire.  Being stuck in small town America he enlists the help of a young boy named Harley, who he sees a lot of himself in, and together they gain even more vital information into the military's part in the bombings and who's really behind it all. The interactions between these two was delightfully playful and had me thinking how great a father Tony would be.  I'm usually annoyed by children but found him an admirable sidekick.

In the previous movies, Pepper was the damsel in distress, but I'm happy to report she kicked some serious butt in this movie.  I liked seeing the duality of businesswoman Pepper and the woman who saves Tony.  There's a newfound respect from her in regards to the necessity of putting your life on the line and I think it brings them closer together.  After an uneasy transition to Don Cheadle portraying Rhodes in the previous film, I found him to be much more comfortable in the part.  He and Tony had enjoyable verbal bantering and he had a more commanding presence in the War Machine armor.

The Mandarin seems a formidable villain and, played by Ben Kingsley, he brings unexpected humor to his villainous persona.  As the movie progresses though we find out that there's a bigger, more scarier, player behind the scenes.  He's using medical technology to change people and make them invincible and he's a worthy opponent in a battle against Iron Man.  This final battle unleashes some very intense special effects.  It's like 4th of July has been unleashed on the screen and it only gets more exciting as a surprising army comes to aid Tony in his fight to save Pepper, the President, and the world.

After a disappointing second movie, I found this one a return to form. The humor was back, the villain was a worthy adversary who had a cleverly nefarious plan, and Tony again showed emotional character growth.  He was brought low in this movie and rose heroically from the ashes.  I see that for true comic book afficonados this movie was a disappointment, but as a person unfamiliar with the comic book origins I found this an intriguing twisting and turning story with delightful verbal sparring and edge of your seat action.  The acting was well-done all around with a special shout out to Ben Kingsley who really isn't what you expect him to be.  Guy Pearce, who plays Killian, also shows a dramatically different side as he starts the film in full geek mode and transforms into cover model handsome while showing a deceptively malicious side.  The returning main couple of Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert Downey Jr. have their characters down pat.  There's a connection between the two that can't be broken no matter what befalls them.  With Tony making a surprising choice at the end it will be interesting to see where he and Iron Man go next.

5642892,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man 3 was completely underwhelming.

I guess the writers wanted to have more of Tony Stark outside the box, as it were, but it was too much of it. This resulted in much less spectacle than I was expecting.

To have him challenge the Mandarin without having any defense systems in place? Completely silly. We create our own demons? Looking back at the last film, the Avengers, this doesn't make any sense. Spoiler alert: destroying his toys at the end? Completely nave. Is the world now free of other threats?

There was one cool idea: the flying Iron Man parts. This gave us one really touch scene when he uses this capability to protect Pepper.

But the middle third of the movie just seemed tedious and drawn out. There was a lot of action at the end, but it was all happening so fast that it was hard to appreciate what was going on, what with multiple iron men flying about.

Iron Man 3 takes the chemistry that was on display there, and amps it up with Black's touch of his Lethal Weapon writing, and RDJ's amazing take on Tony Stark.

While I won't give away much about the story, I will say this film touches on some real world issues, and pays homage to many current Iron Man stories, especially Matt Fraction's run on Invincible Iron Man.

It may be a notch below The Avengers, but Iron Man 3 is an amazing start to Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Can't wait to see what else is to come with the rest of our fellow Avengers.",1368662400,2,785,4.36986301369863
5642895,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Having saved the Earth with Marvel superhumans in ""The Avengers,"" a genius industrialist (and playboy) Tony Stark comes back in ""Iron Man 3,"" an action-packed movie of which story becomes pretty darker than the previous two ""Iron Man"" films. Maybe this is not surprising as the new installment is directed by Shane Black, writer of ""Lethal Weapon.""

""Iron Man 3"" revolves around our billionaire superhero Tony Stark/Iron Man, who, while struggling with panic attacks, has to fight the armies led by a terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). Guy Pearce plays Aldrich Killian, a scientist Tony Stark should have treated better.

This is a film that will divide opinion between those who are avid fans of Marvel, and those who just want a thrilling action movie. I happen to fall into the latter group and enjoyed watching the film pretty much, though I knew this was not exactly an ""Iron Man"" film. Slick and enjoyable as it is (don't miss the amusing post-credit scenes), ""Iron Man 3"" is less about the titular hero than about Tony Stark with lots of flying suits. Also, though I don't reveal the entire plot here, I don't know the point of introducing the super villain with ten rings in this way.

As I said before I enjoyed the visually stunning action sequences of the film, though I am disappointed with the story that starts out well but gets pointless at it unfolds.",1368576000,,1378,4.781512605042017
5642896,5,B00BL1BJFW,"For most of the world, Iron Man 3 is the first Marvel film following the massively successful Avengers film.  People the world over have waited to see how Marvel will go back to focusing on a single superhero and whether it would satisfy after last summer's superhero binge.  But for some of us Iron Man 3 is important for a very different reason.  For a few movie fans, Iron Man 3 signifies not necessarily the glorious return of a franchise superhero, but rather the reunion between star Robert Downey Jr. and director Shane Black.  You might be unfamiliar with the name Shane Black (and honestly who could forget a name like that), but you almost certainly are familiar with the movies he has scripted.  In the late eighties/early nineties Black became the highest paid screenwriter of all time.  He's most famous for his work on Lethal Weapon and its first sequel and less famous for films like The Last Boy Scout and The Long Kiss Goodnight (although, for my money, The Last Boy Scout is entirely underrated).  His movies combined action elements popular in the eighties with a decidedly film noirish cynicism.  It was no surprise, then, when, after nearly a decade missing in action, Shane Black's first directorial effort was a post-modern noir, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.

It was overshadowed by the first Iron Man, but Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was without a doubt Robert Downey Jr.'s comeback vehicle.  It may not have reached the kind of audience that a superhero film can, but it once again proved that Robert Downey Jr. possessed impeccable comedic timing and charisma to spare.  And there's a shared comedic sensibility between Downey and Black.  Both seem to revel in freewheeling and unexpected turns, quick wits and big egos.  And while Iron Man 3 is first and foremost a big budget summer blockbuster, both Black and Downey find enough space to fit their own oversized personalities.

There's plenty of back story in Iron Man 3, so much in fact that a lot of information is delivered by Downey in the form of a voiceover.  The film begins at the turn of the new millennium when people were still worried about the Y2K virus and Eiffel 65's little ditty, ""Blue,"" was worming its way into our hearts.  One of the central themes of the film is how decisions have long term consequences that we aren't initially aware of, and so early on we are introduced to Maya Hansen, a genius botanist who is developing a procedure that could eventually help re-grow limbs.  We are also introduced to Aldrich Killian, played, at least in this part of the film, as socially awkward computer nerd who walks with a cane and has yet to master basic grooming techniques.  Killian makes his way onto the same elevator as Tony Stark, and he proceeds to pitch his idea for a venture capitalist start up.  In order to get rid of him, Stark promises to meet him up on the roof in a few minutes and then deliberately forgets about it.

It should come as little surprise that thirteen years later Killian the socially clumsy computer nerd has become Killian the suave industrialist.  Killian has somehow cured his limp and is macking on Tony Stark's main squeeze, Pepper Potts.  Meanwhile there's a terrorist on the loose by the name of The Mandarin who has been releasing mysterious footage of himself decrying Western decadence while detonating bombs across the country with impunity.  It doesn't take much to figure out that there's a connection between The Mandarin and Killian (but things are either more or less than they seem at first).  While following one of Killian's henchmen, Stark's former body guard and friend, Happy Hogan, gets himself blowed up real good, and in a fit of rage Stark calls out The Mandarin on television, even providing his home address as a challenge.

Stark's challenge is accepted, and three heavily armed helicopters show up at Stark's Frank Lloyd Wright inspired mansion and proceed to blow it up.  Stark narrowly escapes, and decides to play dead in rural Tennessee.  While convalescing in a barn, Stark strikes up a friendship with a precocious ten year old named Harvey.  Stark spends most of the film outside of the Iron Man suit, a smart move on the part of the filmmakers.  One of the chief problems with superhero films is that the superpowers can get in the way of the action.  We're never quite certain how much punishment the protagonist can take and after a while watching two nearly invulnerable people pound on each other starts to lose its appeal.  This is why it's much easier to build a movie around Batman than Superman.

There are a number of twists and turns throughout the film, and I don't really want to give them away.  Shane Black is a master at setting up expectations just so he can undermine them.  (Watching Iron Man 3 a year after the Avengers got me thinking that maybe Black is the progenitor of Joss Whedon.  Both really want to pull the rug out from under the audience).  A lot of Black's personality really shines through in the film.  Like Lethal Weapon, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and A Long Kiss Goodnight, the movie takes place at Christmas (this guy loves Christmas).  Much of the dialogue consists of men exchanging quippy exchanges with one another while under nearly fatal doses of testosterone.  And Tony Stark, like Martin Riggs before him, is suffering from mental problems, a case of PTSD following the events of The Avengers.  Hell, the climax of the film even takes place at the docks.  Of course, all of Black's personality is shrouded in the wares of the Marvel Universe, but it's a good fit nonetheless.

The film itself isn't perfect, exactly.  The villain's plan is ridiculously convoluted.  There are also a number of moments where the movie attempts to sublimate our collective trauma surrounding 9/11.  Terrorism is used as a plot point, but it's a mostly bloodless kind of terrorism that's meant to be exciting rather than horrific.  Perhaps the most troubling moment in the film happens when Tony Stark calls out The Mandarin, claiming that he's out for pure revenge and not politics, as if the two are mutually exclusive.  If we've learned anything after 9/11, we should have learned that vengeance is an extension of the political.  So the film might read as a piece of propaganda to some (which is true of most of the Iron Man movies) but to others it might be a fascinating depiction of America's failure to fully come to grips with 9/11 even a decade out.  But purely as a work of entertainment, Iron Man 3 is the most accomplished of the series.  Where Iron Man 1 and 2 worked best during moments of comedy and only started flailing during the action sequences, Iron Man 3 balances these two modes perfectly.  It got me thinking that this whole superhero thing might have legs after all.",1368576000,3,6760,4.725255972696246

5642910,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Ironman 3 is the concluding chapter in the Ironman trilogy. While the movie has a lot of good features to boast about, it's ultimately an unsatisfying ending.

Ironman 3 finds Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) an emotional wreck, reeling from the events that transpired in the Avengers movie. But Stark's past is about to catch up with him in the form of Alldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) who has a idea for DNA regeneration that Stark had rebuffed years earlier. The threat to Stark is doubled when the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) appears inducing terrorist attacks across the U.S. To complicate it all is Stark/Ironman's relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).

Some of the problems begin with the introduction of Aldrich Killian, it seems his plan to take over the United States is remarkably similar to the one Jim Carrey's The Riddler has in Batman Forever. As a matter, of fact Pearce's first appearance and portrayal of Killian is similar to Carrey's portrayal of Edward Nygma, and later Pearce seems to be aping Val Kilmer! Then there's the dependence on the Avengers movie, as a stand-alone movie Ironman 3 is much too dependent on the Avengers movie and the assumption that an Ironman 3 audience would have seen the Avengers. I didn`t, and it left a considerable hole in the story. Then, there's the Ironman suit featured in most of the movie. It seems to have no other practical purpose except the function it will have in the conclusion, that is telegraphed almost from the first. Finally, there's the unfortunate inclusion of the Iron Patriot, Don Cheadle in the role of Colonel James Rhodes who is now the U.S. government's enforcer. But at critical moments in the action, Rhodes doesn't seem to know how to operate the armor.

That isn't to say the acting isn't good. Everyone in movie turns in a strong performance. Robert Downey is reliably good as Stark, Gwyneth Paltrow has finally been given something to do in an Ironman movie besides scream and react to Downey's Stark. Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin takes the character from a truly menacing character to parody (it's purposeful) and is believable in the almost dual role. Even for the drawbacks I've mentioned before, Guy Pearce's performance is strong and he's believable in the part.

If you're an Ironman fan you're going to see the movie. If you're on the fence, maybe wait for the DVD/Blu-Ray (and the extras it's sure to carry!), or temper your expectations. Perhaps Hollywood is all ready for an Ironman reboot.",1368576000,5,2488,4.874704491725768

What it does have...Robert Downey solid in his role as usual, great special effects and some really funny humor.  The Iron man/kid scenes to me stole the show.  But the baddies are a little weak, doesn't follow the comic's version of the Mandarin at all.  The movie in fact weakens the Mandarin's abilities as compared to what he was portrayed in the comics.  I really wanted Ironman to be more Ironman in the suit and less of a bunch of empty suits flying around in the main climatic scene.

Having said all that, I do like the movie and think it is a worthwhile watch and purchase but in comparison to the others, you will think this is the lesser of the 3.",1368576000,5,884,4.201183431952662

Same Name, not the Same Game.  You see, I love RDJ as Iron Man.  I rated the first Iron Man film a 4.8 out of 5 stars.  It is hands down the best Marvel movie ever made and launched a reboot franchise that is breaking box office records.  Iron Man 2 I downgraded to a 3.8, but it was still very entertaining despite the criticisms.  The Avengers blew my mind and catapulted the viewer score to a 4.5.  But this latest movie in the franchise lacks something the others had:  Character and solid entertainment.  Sure there were great, ground-breaking special effects.  And yes we get to see some really cool ideas and action sequences.  However the characters seemed less important and the soul of the movie was edited out to move along a plot-line that seemed confusing and unoriginal.  With a different director and editor on this film, it didn't fare as well.  Why did Jon Favreau make `Cowboys and Aliens' when he could have made a better Iron Man 3?  Not to say don't see this mind you.  If you like Iron Man, you'll like this film, but you won't love it.  No, it's unfortunately lost most of the charm that the characters demanded of you from the first film.  And the villain was pretty much forgettable and badly written.  I mean, what happened to the Mandarin?  Comic book aficionados should be furious!  So due to the lack of story interest, I give this special effect romp a 3.3/5 stars.  Overall, it's just not as good as the others, but not as bad as most of the other non-marvel action movies that have come along lately.  But if you are gonna see it, do it in the theaters.

5642913,1,B00BL1BJFW,"Tony Stark wants to be a hero with out the suit... we get it.

He's growing up to be a man instead of a play boy... we get it.

What I hate is... there is no point to the plot at all - Iron Man 1 the bad guys wanted weapons to fight in the Middle East and control of the largest weapon company int he world.  Iron Man 2 saw a bad guy whose father was 'destroyed' by the Stark family Hammer wanted his company to overtake Starks.  In Iron Man 3... there was no reason for the main bad guy to do any of this.

I sat there and said ""why"" over and over.  Why are the Iron Man suits weak?

In Iron Man 1, after flying from California to the Middle East, blowing up a militant force, then their base, then blown out of the sky by a tank, the suit took shots from F-22s, hit a plane in mid flight, saved a pilot, then flew home... all on the 2nd power heart.

5642914,5,B00BL1BJFW,"I was impressed by ""Iron Man,"" underwhelmed by the character-stuffing antics of ""Iron Man 2"" and didn't have high hopes for ""Iron Man 3.""  But it's clear that Marvel's Phase 2 of its overall movie plan is actually a plan, not a bunch of execs sitting around a table fretting about what the audience wants, and the results are on screen.  This is the best Iron Man of the bunch.

Like the first movie, debonair playboy billionaire Tony Stark (Morton Downey, Jr.) is his usual intense self, but he's evolved in a new direction since the events of ""The Avengers."" Nobody - not Stark, not the rest of the world, not little kids he bumps into during his adventures - forgets that aliens nearly destroyed New York City.  The world has changed: National fears are elevated by a no-longer-existential threat, security and tensions are heightened, and Stark suffers from panic attacks. Old-fashioned terrorism has to raise the game to get anybody's attention.

When a Bin-Laden like villain known as the Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley, doing a brilliant turn in a character far nuanced than the comic archetype would usually warrant) begins hijacking the airwaves with a bomb so intense that it echoes Hiroshima's after-effects of burning shadows into walls, Stark does what he always does.  He calls out the Mandarin by giving him his home address...on national television.

The consequences for his action are dire, of course.  ""Iron Man 3"" looks the life of a superhero squarely in the eye and says: this is what happens when you're famous.  It's what keeps Stark up at night too; when you've watched the Hulk in action, is it any wonder he can never sleep again?

Forget villains of the week, action figures, and commercial tie-ins.  This movie is about Stark and Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Guy Pearce does an excellent turn as the disgruntled founder of AIM, but he largely just sits back and let the other actors do their thing.

It's easy to see why this movie is an international hit.  It is at times both breathtakingly cynical and terrifically optimistic. When Stark goes on the run after his aforementioned schoolyard taunt lands him in deep trouble, his relationship with wide-eyed but not innocent Harley Kenner (Ty Simpkins) grounds the film.  It's a reminder that for all the politics and power suits, Iron Man is still a superhero at heart.  And as the 70s-style credits retrospective reminds us, the Iron Man Franchise is just getting started.  Stay after the credits for a humorous conclusion to Stark's narrative.

5642915,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Director Shane Black (Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang) took a screenplay by Drew Pearce (No Heroics, Pacific Rim) and himself and made a fun romp of an adventure in this third film of the Iron Man franchise. It comes complete with a simple premise but a few plot twists that will definitely surprise you in the beginning, middle and the end.

Most of this incredibly fun adventure is due to the magnetically charged personality that is Robert Downey, Jr. (Sherlock Holmes, Due Date) as Stony Stark. He is the genius billionaire with the alter ego known as Iron Man who seems to do things under his own agenda, whether anyone likes it or not. His relentless deliveries of sarcasm, wit and humor toward almost everything about himself, his enemies and even his girlfriend, is nothing short of pure delight to watch.

Yes there is plenty of action sequences, flying sequences and some pretty impressive special effect sequences, but the heart of this film is his dedication and love for Miss Pepper Pots played even more dynamically this time around by Gwyneth Paltrow (Seven, Contagion). The two of them on screen is nothing but a pure delight of electricity and passion to watch. And, Gwyneth is much more than his pretty `Girl Friday' in this film. Without saying much, she actually gets to wear one of the suits herself - what she does with it - look out!

Now without revealing too much, Ben Kingsley (Gandhi, Schindler's List), plays an astonishing role that will literally leave you in a state of shock, as the key villain, or so we think, as he has something unusually strange about himself that is later revealed. Ben does an amazing job in this weird and yet offbeat character he was given to play.

Don Cheadle (Crash, Hotel Rowanda) reprises his role as the `patriotic' vversion Iron man with a small chip on his shoulder. Scratch that, a large chip on his shoulder.  In this film he realizes the importance of what Tony Stark is doing and learns that everything is not always as it appears to be, especially in the face of danger.

Now throw in a second villain, played artistically evil by Guy Pearce (Momento, The Hurt Locker) and you have a sadistically cruel and vengeful character driven film that literally will keep you guessing all the way to the end. This film sees tons more action and definitely more defined characters than in the second film of the franchise, which was my least favorite of the three.

The movie is fast paced and heart-pounding with movement and incredible stunts and effect sequences. The artistry of cinematography and visual effects combined make it almost hard to believe we are not watching it as it `really' happens. Composer Brian Tyler (Eagle Eye, Middle Men) does an amazing score to compliment the entire film with orchestral strides of passion and action combined to make you hum some of the underscore.

I personally feel the first Iron Man, although an origin story, still had more depth of story and character development and therefore still making it the best of the three for me. But this film is far superior in the humor and action department. You will literally be cheering in your seats for the finale in this film. Oh, be sure and wait for the credits to end, I have a strange feeling a certain group of `super' heroes are coming back soon. (Wink wink.)",1368316800,3,3304,4.704152249134948

Should you be a purist, or at least a Marvel historian like my sons, you will recognize the story lines that blur and sometimes are eliminated in I-3.

Tony Stark, as melded by the incomparable RD Jr., startles once again with his chameleonesque revelation of self, the everyday guy next door who also happens to be not merely a billionaire genius hero action guy, but is in fact, Iron Man.

Generous portions of plot and character are dished out across the screen and throughout the tale, Ms. Pepper igniting the screen per usual with her unmatchable finesse at equaling her always challenging love.

Ben Kingsley had to have been overjoyed to be blessed with his role as (pseudo)Mandarin,[and that is not giving anything away!] the part having had to have been spun out of a future that was yet to exist, shimmering from his illustrious past.

The digitizers need their own review by someone that can actually explain how it is they do what they do so magnificently.

5642928,4,B00BL1BJFW,"When confronted by his own vulnerability, Tony Stark made himself stronger with his Iron Man suit. But now he's seen that for all his power, there are plenty of people out there bigger and badder than him.

In that way, ""Iron Man 3"" isn't really a sequel to the previous ""Iron Man"" movies, but a sequel to ""The Avengers."" With that in mind, director Shane Black brings a more introspective, raw quality to the third movie about the man in the mechanical suit -- there's still plenty of quirky humor and Robert Downey Jr. being awesome, but it's trying to be more introspective.

Ever since the events of ""The Avengers,"" Tony Stark (Downey) has been suffering from panic attacks and insomnia. He's also been compulsively building newer, stronger Iron Man suits, and even injects himself with nanotech that allows him to control the suits with his will. Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) isn't pleased about his weird behavior.

Then a cruel new terrorist called the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) unleashes a series of bombings on US soil. When one of the bombings badly injures Happy (Jon Favreau), an angry Tony challenges him to come and get him. Bad idea: the Mandarin bombs Tony's seaside mansion to the ground, and Tony is presumed dead. But he's not dead -- he's just stranded in Tennessee, with a broken suit.

And as he works to fix his suit, Tony discovers that the terrorists are somehow involved with an experimental virus known as Extremis -- which the think-tank genius Killian (Guy Pearce) has been showing off to Pepper. Now Tony must not only get himself back together, but unravel an elaborate conspiracy centered around Extremis. If he doesn't, he may lose everything that he loves.

Expect ""Iron Man 3"" to be very different from the previous two movies, because director Shane Black (best known for ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"") has a very different style from Jon Favreau. In this case, he's trying to blend together a fiery, fast-moving thriller with a more introspective look at Tony Stark -- who is he and what can he do without his armor? What is most important to him? Is the armor just his security blanket against the big bad world?

Don't worry, things don't get too angsty. There's still plenty of Tony's quirky humor (giant stuffed bunny) and some gloriously white-hot action scenes -- which are made even cooler by the presence of Tony's independently-moving Iron Man suits. Awesome. And even in the tense, dark scenes, Black is able to insert some clever dialogue (""Don't shoot! Seriously, I don't even like working here. They are so weird!"") and dark slapstick (Tony running into a truck).

The biggest problem? When Tony lands in Tennessee, the plot's momentum grinds to a halt, and it doesn't start up again until he leaves. I don't know why we needed this whole section with Tony's tattooed fanboy and the kid who helps him fix his suit -- it feels totally disconnected from everything else.

As usual, Robert Downey Jr. is complete perfection here. On the one hand, he's still the snarky, clever technical genius (""'a cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner' could be the name of my autobiography!""), but his Tony is also struggling to deal with his insecurities and fears. Downey gives a beautifully subtle depiction of post-traumatic stress disorder, revealing Tony's fears without making him seem weak.

The rest of the cast is almost as great -- Paltrow gets some awesome scenes as a self-assured woman dealing with a very difficult boyfriend, and she even has an awesome action scene. Don Cheadle is awesome, Guy Pearce is wonderfully creepy, and Ben Kingsley... well, who is more perfect to play a charismatic, eerie terrorist? Nobody!

""Iron Man 3"" suffers from a dead spot in the middle, but otherwise it rounds off the Iron Man trilogy beautifully -- and while it's wrapped up, the door is left open for more adventures. Just don't expect the same kind of story.",1368144000,,3880,4.829819277108434

Putting the fact that I wasn't a huge fan of the first two Iron Man movies to begin with: the second was infinitely more plausible and darker than the first. The problem is in this third entry - they refuse to go darker. The Mandarin becomes a Joker, you almost find yourself rooting for the villains and hoping that Stark will be out of commission. The action is decent but the mad genius brilliance of Tony Stark has nowhere to go. It can't go into the new suit because it is just a prototype, the old suits just don't have the same general kick as the Mach series and don't even get me started on the Iron Patriot or the apparently uselessness of Don Cheadle as Rhodes. Sadly no-one seems to care at all, I honestly got more of a kick out of watching the Thor 2 preview that preceded the movie rather than being able to really embrace this and for Marvel to let this slide, well there are no excuses except to say that they've used their 'we just needed to cut paychecks' card.",1368144000,9,1041,4.343589743589743

5642932,2,B00BL1BJFW,"WARNING: SPOILERS!!!!

 I walked into the theatre the day after the premier with confidence that Shane Black and staff would have had no problem whatsoever in creating an epic kickoff for phase two of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Since Iron Man 2 was a little disappointing and steered astray of the Extremis plot, I just knew this story would get Iron Man back on track, and couldn't help but be greatness with such a clever cast and such valuable characters to the storyline. The plot started out somewhat rocky, but I was indulged at the introduction of Maya Hansen, being as the ""Extremis"" plot is my favorite in all Iron Man history. Although I really don't care much for the original Extremis plot to be toyed with, I kind of liked the idea of creating a villain out of Aldrich Killian, since his story in the comics was a waste of character; like they got rid of someone they really didn't have time or room enough to keep in the mix. It was inevitable that he would be a villain in the film as Tony emphasizes in his narration about ""creating monsters"", and deliberately leaves Aldrich waiting on the rooftops during the New Years Millennium party. But, like I said, I'm fine with all that; I wouldn't want the motion picture to completely duplicate the comics or Joss Whedon's animated version, and I actually liked how they spiced up the extremis virus. It was looking good. The Mandarin made his appearance and Tony gets pissed. Action rocks in..... then, after that, everything goes WRONG WRONG WRONG!!!

 First off, Marvel has had a grasp on the best comic book motion picture franchise and running continuity since the first Iron Man. Why would you cast one of the best actors anyone could ever think to play one of the most iconic villains in Marvel comics, and then screw it up so bad that I have almost completely lost faith in the entire phase two conundrum? I mean it's Ben Freaking Kingsley for Christ's sake!! It could have been monumental. I cant' believe he was on board for such a butchering. They had so much potential for villains in this movie. I mean, making the Mandarin a spoof!!! What are you thinking?!?! That's like taking Joker away from Batman, Green Goblin away from Spiderman, General Zod away from Superman. It's an insult to Marvel fans, and especially to the original comic book writers and artists, and it makes this whole film just silly.

 Secondly, why would you hire someone who's greatest accomplishments are clich action blow 'em up, beat 'em up, bland scripted bullcrap, to direct and write a screenplay that was suppose to tell such a wonderful story? It is beyond me that such a successful franchise devolved into a Michael Bay/Chris Nolanesque script for what should have been a very important piece of the pie. I almost threw up putting those two names together in order to reference a film, but it makes since if you'll let me explain. I understand that Nolan did wonderful things with the story of not only Batman, but especially Bruce Wayne. I loved The Dark Knight Trilogy, no doubt. I felt like Black was making some kind of crude, twisted, corny, failed attempt at a similar story this go around with Tony Stark. We all love Tony, but we already have enough Tony. We love him. We know his background, his story, his don't give a damn attitude. We know Tony. We know he's not a sissy, whiny, pansy who has anxiety attacks because of a battle he experienced with the Avengers. Tony Stark is a bad @$$, not some blabbering crybaby. He's the one who uses wit, incredible genius, ingenuity, an invincible suit of weapon filled armor powered by a core that defines bad @$$ery, and an inability to back down from any adversary to be the fearless leader of elite superheroes, Nobody raises their tails off the edge of their seats anymore than when Iron Man fans see Stark suit up and kick into action. The script is crap. It's like Black wrote most of it trying to imitate Michael Bay's excuse for comedy. It's repulse. The action sequences and plot holes are hideous as well. The climax battle is pretty good, if you can stomach getting that far into the movie. All these are traits of Bay, who is a buffoon (in case you didn't know).

 Thirdly, why the heck did they make the MK 42 (new compact ""suitcase"") armor so malfunctioned? Stark is a genius. He creates things that work. Other than that he has forty-something other suits that work perfectly well that he could have easily used at anytime.... including Iron Patriot, which Rhodes barely even wears, and which is stolen from another Marvel comic book storyline in which Norman Osborn dons the name and armor. Also, I literally got sick and tired of seeing Iron Man armor explode in this movie. That ain't cool when your entire life you've considered Iron Man's armor virtually indestructible.

 Fourthly, in the end Stark has no home and no armor. He destroys every last suit before riding off and proclaiming "" I am Iron Man."" Not a great way to blend story arcs with the next Avengers movie, and definitely something Tony would never do. You would think since Black put so much emphasis on getting to ""know"" Tony Stark, he would've knew better than end things in such a mess. I also noticed in the end credits a special thanks to Joss Whedon. I really don't expect he had a hand in writing such blasphemy. I'm sure he offered sound advice. They should have taken it if they were going to thank him for it.

 Lastly, after the end credits we get the bonus scene just as all the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films supply. It reminded me how infuriated I am that Marvel decided not to cast Edward Norton for the remaining run of films including last year's Avengers. He was the best Bruce Banner ever, and done a superb job in writing for the film The Incredible Hulk. I Don't think Ruffalo done a bad job or anything, and this really didn't have any effect on my opinion of Iron Man 3, I just felt the need to share my frustration about the matter.

 Overall, almost everything about this film blows. I gave the film 2 stars. Those stars belong to the actors who done a magnificent job with a crappy screenplay. The writers ruined the Mandarin, ruined Iron Man, and ruined my hopes for a great Extremis trilogy. They crippled the series with Iron Man 2, but this was the final devastating blow.",1368144000,8,6314,4.595914742451154
5642933,3,B00BL1BJFW,"After hearing what a blockbuster it was opening weekend and hearing a couple of comments from reviewers stating this was best of the 3, I gotta say I was very disappointed after seeing this last night.  Was it entertaining? - yeah sure. Did it have some good special effects? - yeah sure.  Did it have a coherent logical somewhat believable (for a comic book hero) storyline - NO!  This was a movie that was trying to be way too cute for my tastes.  One reviewer I listened to said this was a much more gritty version/story than the first two.  I don't know what they were watching, but it couldn't have been this attempt at a laughfest.  At least the humor in the first two was more balanced by the story and action whereas this one was throwing out one-liners one after another and only half of them were actually funny, the rest where obvious that someone was trying to hard.  While I realize this is a comic book hero, I prefer some semblance of reality to the plot/storyline.  Turning Madarin into a complete joke did not help.  They really lost me when the Guy Pearce character blew fire out of his mouth like some dragon.  Why not just have him bend over a blow it out his you know what since they were so obviously trying to get the most laughs out of this.  Then the whole thing with Pepper Pots supposedly perishing near the end (you knew she didn't) and then coming back to clobber Guy Pearce was a bridge too far. I hope this is not what we can expect from Disney now that they own Marvel.  If it is, it's gonna be the death of the franchise.",1368144000,8,1554,4.302405498281787
5642934,4,B00BL1BJFW,"The world has changed.

This is the guiding mantra of Marvel Studio's latest offering, Iron Man 3.

Following the alien invasion that devastates New York City and nearly costs Tony Stark his life in The Avengers, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a changed man. He has panic attacks. He spends his nighttime hours designing new Iron Man suits instead of sleeping. He hides himself at home, often projecting the Iron Man as a shield of defense. (I can't say more without spoilers.) Even the way he speaks is changed. Though still present, the confident, snarky humor that characterized Stark in the first two Iron Man films and The Avengers is toned down in Iron Man 3.

The result of these changes is that perhaps for the first time, audiences get a deep look at a Marvel hero who seriously struggles with the monumentally strange events that have come to shape his life. (Some of this was done for Captain America in The Avengers, but he quickly suits back up.) This leads to a more intimate investment in Tony Stark than conjured by the previous films and makes this film stronger than the last two.

Unfortunately, the change in the world that darkens Stark's mind hemorrhages into the rest of the script, at times needlessly creating a darker world.

Iron Man 3 finds our hero battling the Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley), a new breed of super terrorist who loves blowing things up and leaving no evidence of any kind that can be traced back to him. Through the course of the film, we see some of these attacks and their aftermath. Anyone near the blast is incinerated instantly, leaving human shaped scorch marks for the audience to look at.

These images are violent and unsettling. But there are more.

This time, Stark has no qualms about shooting bad guys. ""I'm going to kill you first,"" he tells one of the Mandarin's henchmen. Along with Col. Rhodes' War Machine (Don Cheadle)--rebranded as the Iron Patriot--Stark shoots lots of baddies throughout the film, though he lets one run away when the henchman drops his gun and exclaims that he hates his job.

The end result is that a lot of people die before the credits roll--many more than in previous entries in the Iron Man and The Avengers series. From this we see that the world really has changed. The typically light, fun Marvel summer blockbuster is taking on an increasingly dark and heavy tone, suggesting that Americans are only ever more paranoid about the world's many dangers.

By itself the tone isn't a persistent problem, but it's also coupled with too many characters with no motivation. Typical henchmen are usually not given any backstory in movies, which is appropriate as the movie's two hours should be spent developing the protagonist and villain. But in this film, the Mandarin employs several U.S. army recruits who volunteer to become super soldiers in his private army. They are central to his plans. But why these previously good men and women turn evil is not explained, leading to a plot that is too cartoonish even for a comic book movie.

Overall, though, the film is still very enjoyable. Stark's character is more human and superhuman than ever, and the spectacle of the action scenes is state-of-the-art and not to be missed. The world has indeed changed, leading Marvel in a mostly strong direction.",1368144000,2,3291,4.778169014084507
5642935,3,B00BL1BJFW,"I'm writing this more as a reaction than an actual review as I believe anyone who saw the first two movies - which was a whole lot of people - will want to see this one no matter what any reviews say. Nonetheless, I will try to avoid giving any plot spoilers.

But as someone who was a fan of the Iron Man comics since the character first appeared back in the 60's, I absolutely have to say one thing right out of the gate. In the words of Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons:

Worst... Mandarin... ever!

Seriously, the best advice I can give anyone planning on seeing Iron Man 3 is that if you remember the arch-villain the Mandarin from the comic books, try to purge your mind of everything you ever knew about him. The character in the movie is _not_ the Mandarin from the comic books, not even remotely, though the film is clearly playing on the fact that unwary fans will think he is. I've heard a number of reasons for the changes to the character, the most believable being that the film's producers didn't want to offend the Chinese (i.e. China), who are a major film market these days and who also now own the largest theater chain in the US. It's essentially the same reason the producers of the remake of Red Dawn changed the villains from being Chinese to being North Korean. So this Mandarin, played by Ben Kingsley (but not his fault) isn't remotely Chinese, doesn't have awesome power rings, isn't... Actually, his calling himself 'the Mandarin' just makes no sense whatsoever.  So for those of you who know the comic book character, brace yourselves for disappointment. For those of you who don't know the comic book character, you have no idea how fortunate you are.

I have other problems with Iron Man 3. It's uneven, particularly in the first half, shifting back and forth between long tediously slow segments and then suddenly jarring action ones. It has plot holes big enough to shove an oil tanker through and at times requires suspension of disbelief that would take the cables from the Golden Gate Bridge to support. And the use of 3D in the film is distinctly unremarkable.  The characterizations resulting from the script are uneven as well. Robert Downey Jr. and Guy Pearce manage to turn in good performances in spite of the script and the direction.  And Stephanie Szostak gives a stand-out performance as a bad-ass henchwoman.  But most of the other actors are largely wasted, most particularly Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle, but also William Sadler and Miguel Ferrer. To his credit, Ben Kingsley does carry off the Mandarin role that the script calls for. Unfortunately it's one that I want to completely purge from my memory.

The blame for the film's shortcomings must be laid at the feet of Shane Black, who both directed and wrote most of the script (Drew Pearce co-wrote and evidently provided most of the humor that appears in the film). Jon Favreau, who directed the first two Iron Man films (and who plays Happy Hogan in all three) stepped aside for this one and it shows. It's something of a mystery why Black was picked for this film as his only directorial credit was 2005's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. As a screenwriter he does have 1987's Lethal Weapon to his credit, but his record since then has been decidedly spotty with a string of big-budget films like The Last Boy Scout and The Last Action Hero that didn't catch fire with audiences.

But all that said, the movie does pick up steam considerably in the last third and the final battle sequences are, to be honest, fairly awesome.

A couple of side notes of things to watch for:  Stan Lee (as always) has a cameo in the film, this time as a beauty pageant judge.  And make sure to watch all the way through the credits as there is an additional scene at the end with a surprise cameo that's worth catching.

Recommended for fans of the first two movies (but not for fans of the comic book) and for the fairly awesome climactic battle sequences.",1368144000,7,3939,4.576704545454546
5642936,2,B00BL1BJFW,"I call it that because I can't think of anything else to call it. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I kept thinking 'When is this silliness gonna stop, and when will the real film really start.' Now I don't mind a film being somewhat deceptive so as to hide some things. I take offense to a film or filmmakers being deliberately deceptive with total and utter false advertising. Hey if they are scared to really write and show the Real Mandarin, that is their right. Just leave the character out of the film altogether. Don't give the middle finger to true and longtime fans who have been begging for a true Iron Man/Mandarin showdown since the first Iron Man film was announced. We don't have to go see it a second time. If you really want to pander to kid-friendly audiences that is also your right, but trust me when I tell you this. They don't outnumber real and longtime fans. Your playing a dangerous game. Casual fans eventually move on to something newer or more exciting.

As an action film, Iron Man 3 isn't really that bad. This isn't the real Iron Man IMO. It's clear to me that the new director either knows nothing about Iron Man, or simply didn't care. This is a hatchet job if I've ever seen one. Bad enough I don't get to see the Real Mandarin, I also have to endure an annoying little kid throughout and Iron Man barely in one of his many armors. Sorry to have to tell some of these arrogant and self-indulgent filmmakers this, but contrary to your popular belief or need, but many of us really do prefer the hero in his costume or armor. It's why we first pick up those comic books in the first place. Please quit trying to rehabilitate heroes that don't need saved or early retirement.

I think that would have been great, technology vs magic. Anyway, they took Iron Man's greatest enemy and turned him into a joke. A bad one.

Ben Kingsley is a great actor, but his talent was wasted here. The story could have been based on the entire Extremis  plot, why mix it up with a fake Mandarin? That scene where Kingsley is coming out of the bathroom, the audience is laughing and my friends look at me and ask: THIS IS THE MANDARIN? You know there is something wrong when everyone is laughing in a movie like this one. It felt like we were watching a parody of Iron Man.

It is like tropic thunder, Kingsley is a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude. It also reminds me of this other movie (Wag the dog). Is Marvel going to do this often? One good movie, let's do a bad one now. Do not hate me, it is just my opinion and I would like to know about yours. The plane sequence was awesome so was part of the final battle.

5642943,4,B00BL1BJFW,"I had been waiting to see this movie since it was announced; I kept looking for news of when it might be shown. I saw it and liked it, but it left me feeling a bit let down. So: four stars.
The actors are as good as ever, Downey in particular - my favorite -- as the quick and quirky Tony Stark, dead pan, courageous, and as neurotically obsessed as ever.
But I must say that, while the first part and middle of the movie were great fun to watch, the last part - in particular the climactic battle on board a big industrial ship that might have been used for either oil transport or exploration, is something of a mess. I got the feeling the director put together a lot of short fight scenes and could not suffer to part with any of them. The result is hard to follow: something tremendous happens, but before one is sure of what, the scene is cut to the next big explosion that is cut half way to the next bad person being blown to bits that... `Choreographed' it is not a word that describes it very well.
In my humble opinion, if the director would had left out half of those takes and gave the remaining ones two or three seconds more each, so one could have enough time to appreciate them and get some overall idea of the mayhem in progress, the effect would have been much more satisfactory.
In general, this movie has more in common with the ""Avengers"" than with ""Iron Man"" and ""Iron Man 2"": here Tony Stark is more like a comic book super hero and less like the bright genius cum regular guy that just happens to have invented and uses these great armored suits, but is otherwise just your basic daredevil billionaire.
I know that some critics and people writing here about the movie see depths in it, that some kind of existential doubt assails the hero; to my mind that is ""a bit too much of a muchness"", as the Brits would say.
Summing up: this is an action movie with good acting, but it could have been edited better. Mostly fun and worth watching, but not as good as what its predecessors had made me expect. And if this turns out to be the greatest box office success ever on planet earth and even the whole galaxy? One goes to the movie theater to see movies, not make statistics.",1367971200,,2196,4.2685851318944845
5642944,3,B00BL1BJFW,"SPOILER ALERT:

For me this was the weakest of not only the Iron Man movies, but of all the recent Marvel tie-in movies.  Also, let me say up front that I do not care about accuracy to the comic books, but I do care about consistency between the movies.

I'll start with the good:
- The acting all around was good.

- The CGI was excellent.

- I liked the twist with the Mandarin and the possibilities with the media distorting reality.

- All of the references to the Avengers movie and the references to Iron-Man 1.

- The realism of Tony dealing with PTS and working through his mental struggles.

- The skydiving scene was very cool.

The bad:
- Tony having the chest piece completely removed at the end of the movie.  Whether or not you like Iron Man 2 or not, the fact is that it happened and much of the story in the movie revolved around Tony dying from Palladium poisoning, trying to find and alternative power source, all of Tony's reckless activities due to the idea of dying, discovering a new element to replace Palladium, etc.  If he could just have a surgery and have the chest piece removed then most of that movie goes away.  And, I had someone say that he was able to do it now because of the Extremis program.  If that were true then that does not work either because he would not need a surgery at all if that were the case.  Did all the Extremis people who got repeatedly shot need surgery to remove the bullets...no.  So he shouldn't need a surgery either to remove shrapnel if Extremis was the answer, which the movie gives you no reason to think that was the case anyways.

- Prior to this movie it was always made clear that the chest piece in Tony was powering his suit.  They have completely ignored that fact in this movie.  As a result for a lot of the movie his suit never reaches full charge and therefore is constantly in a weakened state, so he went backwards on his design.  I understand that the new suit did need to have a certain level of internal power to allow it to fly to him and to allow it to suit him up, but beyond that is should have been powered by his chest piece as was established previously.  I'm sure they did this to set up the ending for the removal of the chest piece, but come on.  Again, another consistency issue.

- As others have mentioned there is just not enough Iron Man.

- All the controlling of the suit remotely.  So, there was already a lack of Iron Man in the movie, but on top of it most of the times when we did see Iron Man it was just the suit with Tony controlling remotely.  This is ridiculous.  A lot of the appeal of Iron Man is having the guy inside the suit.  I really hope this does not become a trend for Iron Man going forward.

- The craziness with Tony giving out his address on TV.  Really?  Because anyone and everyone who wanted to get his address couldn't find it out on their own without being told, especially terrorists who had the technology to block out the television airways and had the means to get into the President's cell phone.

- Tony publically announces that he is coming after the Mandarin to kill him after Happy is put in the hospital.  Don't you think he would have gone home and made his suit battle ready as quickly as possible or change to a suit that was battle ready?

- When they are being attacked by the helicopters at his house he had the suits that he could have called as he did at the end, but didn't...why?  Oh yeah, because it would take away from the climax of the movie.

- The little kid brought nothing to the movie and was totally unnecessary.

- The Extremis group was taken too far with giving them super strength, breathing fire from their mouths, etc.

- The Extremis research took years upon years to get sort of working, but still not perfect.  Then Tony comes along when Pepper is the only one left and in the blink of an eye he can just fix her like it was nothing, effectively wiping out a major part of the movie like it never happened.

- The climax with all the Iron Man suits seemed good at first, but it was taken too far over the top.

In any case, this is my opinion on the movie.  I just expected more from Iron Man 3.",1367971200,44,4161,4.223067173637516

I don't understand what goes through the minds of these guys when they put this stuff out. Don't they care? I love children. But stop making everything geared for them! You water down everything just to gain more fans but sacrifice the ones who have been fans just to make an extra buck(OK a lot of extra bucks) and these are the people who will forget about it just move on to the next big thing. Why is the 3rd installment always the worst when it should be the best? Why do we always see less of the character we really want to see? Why is the 3rd one always the most humourous and lighthearted, when its supposed to be dark and serious, with a little humour mixed in unintentionally, just to releave some tension? Why did this movie seem like EP.3 of the Iron Man Show on Nickolodean? Did they really do that to The Mandarin character? I know it will be atleast 1 or 2 more Iron Man movies, but you guys kind of owed us after part 2. And why couldn't the bitch just die???!!! I can't stand her!",1367971200,5,1455,4.163120567375887
5642946,4,B00BL1BJFW,"I'll admit there are some inconsistencies in this movie, like Iron man being able to take on Thor and other hard core baddies in ""The Avengers"" movie, but in this movie the armor is pretty fragile. However, I'm a big fan of Shane Black movies, especially ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" (One of my all time favorite movies). This movie definitely has Shane Black written all over it. Set at Christmas time, a good amount of gun play, funny banter between the characters. Also, the narraration by Robert Downey Jr. was similarly done in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. I also love the twist on the Mandarin character and the way Ben Kinsley plays him. I can understand why hardcore Iron Man fans would be disappointed, because this is pretty much 70% Shane Black flick/ 30% Iron man movie.",1367884800,3,767,4.605839416058394
5642947,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Note: I will update this review when I eventually get the Blu-ray.

Since the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, things have been progressing quite nicely. It all started in 2008 with Tony Stark and his claim to fame as the fabled ""Iron Man."" But when the universe eventually escalated into something much more massive by 2012's ""The Avengers,"" an interesting philosophical quandary was posed to the genius inventor by one Steve Rogers. Essentially, the question was, ""does the man make the suit, or does the suit make the man?"" The first film showed us Stark's reason and cause for dawning the armor after he realized his direct/indirect contribution to so much destruction around the world and felt the need to repent. The second film took it slightly further by showing how he dealt with the pressure of being a publicly-known superhero, how it affected him, both, physically and mentally, and asked what kind of legacy he wanted to leave behind. Conversely, it diverges about halfway through the story and, instead, starts to set the dominoes for ""bigger and better"" things, like S.H.I.E.L.D and the Avengers. In this third entry, we get the (final?) full-circle journey that, more or less, will come to establish Tony Stark/Iron Man as one or the other.

Some time after the events of ""The Avengers"" we begin with a very restless Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who just can't seem to get a good night's sleep. As widely-known as he is for being Iron Man, and with all the major villains targeting his back, there exists a man by the name of The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley), who is terrorizing the United States causing all kinds of chaos via public bombings and televised threats. After a dear friend of Stark's is severely injured, he takes the attack personally and issues a decree of vengeance. But in typical Tony Stark fashion, he not only paints himself another target, he even invites the trouble by publicly stating his home address. When his home is attacked, he barely escapes and must regroup in order to fight another day. In the meantime, secrets would be revealed and events would unfold as Stark discovers the truth, not only about his enemies, but also about himself.

So how do you top ""The Avengers?"" After five excellent prequel films setting up a giant glorious spectacle of quasi-intergalactic proportions, there's nowhere left to go, but higher, right? Well, it depends. If you go by that logic, then you can only go further by making a direct sequel. But what would be the point of exceeding all that successful buildup by not trying to do it again? IM3 marks the beginning of Phase 2 by being less Avengers-centric (aside from a few event references) and by bringing things back down to earth. In doing so, we get to see Tony Stark for the genius, billionaire, playboy (well, not so much since he's with Pepper), philanthropist that he is. At a point in the film, and as obvious by the trailer, his house does, indeed, get blown to smithereens and buried in rubble. And being left with nothing but his ingenuity and resourcefulness, Stark must work his way back up from the ashes to stop a madman from manipulating the world with terror.

And so far, based on the mixed reactions by divisive audiences, your expectations may or may not be met depending on what you're really watching the movie for (character development and storytelling or all-out action) and who you believe the true hero is, Tony Stark or Iron Man. I vehemently support the notion that Tony Stark is, without a doubt, the man that makes the suit. He didn't get however many umpteenth degrees in science and technology or create a mini Arc reactor from a box of scraps in a terrorist cave without showing some signs of intellectual capacity and a knack for building stuff. And for as little time as he spends inside of a suit, I think the film really cements him as a greater character than I would've ever expected. Tony Stark *is* Iron Man. He creates the suits, embraces his role, and finally comes to grips with his past.

On a side note about the technical aspects, I saw this in 2D, as I'm not quite a believer in post-converted 3D films yet, so I can't tell you which version looks better. I will, however, give my compliments to the production crew on another excellent overall effort. The cinematography was pretty breathtaking on a few occasions (particularly when Stark is rescuing people from Air Force One) and and the final battle sequence with all the backup suits. Musically, Brian Tyler does an equally stupendous job driving the film with a mix between Ramin Djawadi's electronic style of the first film and John Debney's traditional orchestral sound of the second. And whether or not they make more IM films, which I think could be overkill at this point, remains to be seen. But I'm confident enough to say Tony Stark is ready for Phase 2 when it happens. Hopefully, the remaining MCU films will do just as great a job at expanding/establishing these characters and continuing to build up for an even more climactic meeting for when things fall into place for ""The Avengers 2.""

Coming off of last year's crossover film, Marvel's The Avengers, Iron Man 3 sets the stage for Phase 2 of this generation's Marvel films. It's been three years since fans have received the lukewarm Iron Man 2 and the third entry in the series attempts to right its predecessors wrongs. The end result is one with a lot of passion, but also one filled with many mistakes.

The story is more emotionally driven this time around as we follow a troubled Tony Stark trying to cope during the aftermath of the events in New York. He can't sleep and when he does his dreams are filled with nightmares. To help keep his mind off of things he's constantly recreating new models of his suit. He keeps telling Pepper that it's a hobby, but it's pretty clear that this is nothing more than a distraction and, to some degree, an obsession.

After the more lighthearted execution of The Avengers film, this darker story might not fare well with the younger audience, but fear not, Iron Man 3 is not without its laughs. Even though Tony is a bit troubled this time around, he's still Tony. So you can still expect his snarky, sarcastic humor. While I found most of the jokes to be fairly entertaining, there were some bits that felt slightly corny and a little bit unnecessary. A good example would be in the beginning as Tony is trying on a new suit. It'll get laughs from the younger crowd, but I couldn't muster more than an awkward sigh.

Overall I found the story enjoyable and I thought the more emotional side of Tony was a nice break from the usual stuff we've received thus far. With that said, some of the scenes in here are extremely cliched and formulaic. What's that? Iron Man fell in the ocean? Oh, how about we get him stuck beneath a metal rod as a huge chunk of cement comes crashing down above him. I'm sorry, what was that? Tony ignores an eager young scientist over a decade ago and he's out to seek revenge? Who would've seen that coming?

While the story in this entry is much more enjoyable than the one present in Iron Man 2, this third installment suffers from the same fate as its origin story: the lack of an interesting villain. Technically this film has two villains. Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) and The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) are the antagonists this time around and they're about as interesting as a sack of potatoes. Killian's character is your recycled fanboy who seeks revenge on the evil idol who payed him no attention and The Mandarin is just a joke. In the comics The Mandarin is a serious force to be reckoned with, but here? He's nothing more than a feeble attempt at gaining some laughs from the crowd.

One of the things I found most odd about Iron Man 3 was, surprisingly, the lack of Iron Man. Now Tony's in a good 85-90% of the scenes in this film, but Iron Man? It felt like he got put on the back burner appearing in maybe 25% of the scenes. I think they tried to hold off in anticipation for the big finale, but it just wasn't the same as seeing Tony flying around in the suit. There's a lot of down time where the suit he's with just isn't functioning properly (at the worst possible times of course), adding another layer of cliche to the story.

Finally, as expected, the cast in here is pretty great. Robery Downey, Jr. came through with another fantastic performance as Tony and Gwyneth Paltrow might have given her best performance of this series getting a lot more screen time and having a bigger role in the story. Don Cheadle finally found his groove as Rhodey, giving a much more enjoyable performance than the uncomfortable effort in Iron Man 2. Guy Pearce did a great job as Killian and Ty Simpkins was a nice touch as the young Harley who assists the troubled Tony Stark.

Overall Score: 7/10 - If you can't tell already I'm about as neutral as neutral can get. The writing for Tony's little side story is very well done, but the main story with these two villains is pretty sub-par. The lead performances from Downey and Paltrow were excellent, but the lack of screen time for Iron Man wasn't. The action was intense, but cliched at times. In short, it was an Iron Man film. We have yet to receive an entry to this series that has been mind blowing, but what makes these so enjoyable is the fact that Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man. He is Tony Stark. There's no denying that he was made for this role and I think that's why I keep coming back. If you're looking for a good popcorn flick with a touch of heart then I would say see this. Because as flawed as it is, it's a nice ride.",1367884800,37,4581,4.425860023724792

5642960,1,B00BL1BJFW,"Ladies & Gents, Boys & Girls, I am not saying this lightly, this movie sucked in EVERY possible way.
Whether one is a Marvel enthusiast or not, there is nothing to like about this $200M cinematic disaster.

1. Tony Stark gets his butt kicked throughout the whole movie. His armor consistently fails him. Buckets of bolts just falling apart at every turn.
  Isn't Iron Man supposed to be invincible?

2. Too much Tony Stark, hardly any Iron Man. Gone is the swagger, now Tony has anxiety issues. Oh please!

3. Iron Man is reduced to the status of malfunctioning buffoon. Too many lame attempts at humor undermine EVERYTHING. Is this supposed to be a comedy?

4. The premise is pointless. The plot is inane and full of cliches, the dialogue is dangerously cheesy. You will neither be thrilled nor uplifted. You will neither be awed nor inspired.

5. Of all the superhero flicks since 2000, this is simply the worst. Yes, worse than The Incredible Hulk. And if you thought Iron Man 2 was bad, this is far worse.

6. This makes Michael Bay movies look good (he probably laughed at the jokes).

7. Shameless product placement. Over 40 armors we barely get to see, all available at your local toy store.

Save your time and money. For the love of Zeus, AVOID this pile of tin cans!",1367798400,21,1276,4.557017543859649

5642962,3,B00BL1BJFW,"There are some strong parrallels between ""Iron Man 3"" and the box office strong but much criticized ""Spider-man 3"".  Fans of Spidey (rightly) pointed out how frequently Spidey was shown without mask, with partial mask, or with the focus being on so much of Tobey Maguire.  As Peter Parker is Spider-man and Tobey Maguire played Parker we saw a lot of Maguire, too much for the fans in fact when they believed they should have been seeing Spider-man more than they did.  So too in IM3 where Robert Downey, Jr. plays Tony Stark (who famously says ""I am Iron Man"") and we see a lot (underscored) of Tony Stark, and I mean a lot.  Is he in his armor?  Sure, quite a bit actually.  It's just that it's in various arrays of armor with faceplate up, the suit coming half off, the suit on in pieces, or the suit partially shredded.  Getting Downey, Jr. was a coup to play Stark and the best thing for the Iron Man films but he is here in the movie too much balanced against being in his armor too little.  And that's too bad because the film suffers from this push to expose Downey and get him as much face time as possible as opposed to focusing on some cool and extended shots of him inhabiting his armor.

Also whereas Spider-man 1 & 2 were brightly lit and colored 3, while still quite bright, toned the colors down and brought in the metaphorical and lighted-effects of darkness.  IM3, if different, is different only in tone (a grittier all around feel) and that many more of its scenes occur at night or in darkened places.  It is like having an artist that you really enjoy drawing your comic only to have another artist step in whose style is so different that it changes the comic book tonally.  That is what has happened in this movie.  IM2 was rather heavy and dense in its themes and story but the lighted qualities drew you in and kept you interested.  In IM3 you may find that you just want some scenes to end or for it to move back into daytime lighting.

Spider-man 2 threw us the curveball that Peter Parker could lose his powers if he was morally conflicted about being Spider-man and then 3 showed us his slide into becoming drunk with power.  IM3 mixes these a bit with Tony Stark using Iron Man as a real and metaphorical crutch, suffering flashbacks and panic attacks from the events of the Avengers alien attack and being briefly and momentarily in another universe.  This is an interesting and organic connection to the previous movie, with PTSD effects fouling up Stark's mental capacities and negatively effecting his choices or causing him to run into his suit to have his body scanned to see if he's dying.  I found that the story-arc around this was actually quite smart except that it didn't just ostracize him from his friends and Pepper Potts but it also ostracized the audience as well; the characters aren't happy and their personalities aren't fleshed out in this iteration as they were in the first and especially second movies.  Stark's accomplishment, if you want to call it that by end of movie (he doesn't ""need"" the Iron Man armors anymore the way that he did throughout the movie--that's all I'll say about that), leaves the viewer at movie's end with unsatisfied questions not as to what will happen next but as to what exactly did all of the quick resolutions really mean.  The brash cock-surity of Stark, something that drew the filmgoer in previously, appears to be in peril at movie's conclusion.

If IM1 & 2 were more stories about redemption and realizing and holding onto meaningful relationships IM3 is about overcoming adversity and hoping to hell that you're relationships will just work out.  Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts, who was Tony's righthand woman and mental/ emotional sparring partner and equal in the first two movies here is a worn, ""why am I doing this?"" tough-gal for part of the film and a damsel in distress for another part and finally the powerful heroine by movie's end (though she still needs to be saved); none of this felt fresh and IMO she never came across as Tony's equal here (she was his superior) so the relational aspect wasn't as satisfying not nearly by half.  Favreau, the previous director of the first two installments and who has given way to new director Shane Black (go back, Jon, go back!), gets a lot more screen time as former bodyguard now promoted to Stark Industries head of security.  Cheadle, in a revamped suit dubbed ""Iron Patriot"", also gets more screen time.

But what of all of the Iron Man armors?  Are there a lot in the film?  Yes, a ton.  And you don't really get a good look at any of them but a brief highlight moment of a few seconds for about 5 of them outside of the main suit.  As far as this fan is concerned that was a complete waste of armor and a very unsatisfying finale to the film.  Notice that in Spider-man 3 he dons more than one suit...but at least they all get decent screentime.

You may have noticed that I haven't spent a lot...or any time on the villains of the story.  For those in the know there are elements of the Extremis storyline in here; for those who don't know Extremis manipulates a person's brain's ability to amplify physical energy and regenerative ability.  Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.) is using this biological technology to their own end and an Osama bin Laden type of terrorist called The Mandarin is also on hand and provides one of the film's few surprising, and humorist, plot twists.  In Spider-man 3 the way that the villains were presented and jumbled it made for too many in the stew.  I will give credit to this film for having several villains and meshing and balancing them out nicely.  Still, I wish that they were more outlandish.  Where's Mickey Rourke's Whiplash when you need him?

This film wasn't horrible by any stretch of the imagination.  It just wasn't that great and definitely the inferior of the three.",1367798400,4,5871,4.576481835564054
5642963,4,B00BL1BJFW,"I understand that this movie messed up The Mandarin character and a lot of comic book fans are mad, but I really enjoyed this new film. Shane Black gives us a dark and comedic new tale in the life of Tony Stark. I thought this new film was much better than Iron Man 2. I love that it takes place around the Christmas holiday. I love the references to 'The Avengers' After almost dying in The Avengers, Tony Stark has been having panic attacks and nightmares. When Happy Hogan is injured during a Mandarin terrorist attack, Tony takes it upon himself to bring The Mandarin to justice. When his house is destroyed, JARVIS sends Tony to rural Tennessee where a Mandarin bombing happened. I loved the comedic one-liners and the witty banter between Tony and a 10-year old boy named Harley. If you love the Iron Man series, you'll love IRON MAN 3!!!",1367798400,3,844,4.522875816993464

Yes Downey is Tony Stark for sure.  And the Skydiving sequence is nothing short of incredible.  But the rest of it is kinda quirky.  And it's filled with recycled stuff.  The villain really isn't original, The whole terrorist plot thing gets really tiring and it's pretty predictable.  Here we are blowing up Air Force One again, with the President in peril, and blah, blah, blah.  If it wasn't for Downey's one liners it would have been boring.",1367798400,5,601,4.59433962264151
5642965,4,B00BL1BJFW,"So Tony Stark, him what's a ""genius billionaire playboy philanthropist,"" is of late going thru a crap time. His stint with the Avengers, his part in stopping the Chitauri invasion, has opened his eyes to the immensity of the universe and his tiny dot of a place in it. Today Tony suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and the wiggy moments and the chronic insomnia that go with that. ""I'm a pipin' hot mess,"" he confesses. Mostly he wants to protect the things he cherishes most, and topping that list is Pepper Potts, the one person he ""cannot live without."" And so you may scratch your head and ponder why Tony would so impulsively publicly challenge the fearsome global terrorist, him what styles himself the Mandarin and is ethnically ambiguous and dresses like a Chinese warlord. Tony, in that brash moment, gives out his Malibu home address on national tv. That moment bites him in the butt.

But wait... As Tony, who provides voice-over narration, tells it, this mess originates thirteen years ago. The film opens on New Year's Eve in 1999, in Bern, Switzerland, during a technological summit. Tony Stark, back then more warmonger than philanthropist, was busy applying his brand of seduction on hottie botanist - but she's more than a botanist - Dr. Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall). Callous and randy, he dismisses the overtures made by the unkempt, geeky scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). Tony literally leaves him out in the cold.

Present-day now, and Killian has resurfaced as this sleek, confident entrepreneur, and his big brain is big and brainy enough that it dazzles the normally unimpressed Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, Tony, consumed by his anxiety attacks, has neglected his personal relationships in favor of heavy time in the lab (and if you'd seen the trailers, then you know what he'd been tinkering with down there).

The Mandarin's reach spans limitless, seems like. His retaliation to Tony's challenge is rapid and ruthless and comprehensive. The destruction of Tony's world propels him on a quest to root out all those responsible. And maybe that's the smartest move that writer/director Shane Black contributes. Months ago, Black had vowed that, for this movie, he wouldn't pit men in armor against each other, and he holds to that. In fact, the pendulum swings so much the other way that, if anything, there may be a dearth of Iron Man sequences. Instead, Black opts to showcase Tony Stark predominantly outside of his metal shell. When you strip away the CG and the big superhero elements, this movie essentially boils down to a detective story. And it's never ever a dummy move to shoot more of Robert Downey, Jr. in front of the camera. And because this is Downey, Jr. and because this is Tony Stark, Tony's recent emotional damage never quite undercuts the swagger. Downey's comic timing is impeccable, the quicksilver wit flashes plenty, but without compromising the dramatic beats. Downey is so good. Shane Black, who directed him in the awesome KISS KISS BANG BANG, takes full advantage of his star's talents. This is, of course, providing that you're down with - or if you buy into - Stark's having accrued debilitating trauma as a direct result of what he experienced in THE AVENGERS. Some may contend that Tony Stark is so arrogant there's no room in his psyche for a bump of insecurity.

IRON MAN 3 is killing it at the box office because folks view it as a direct AVENGERS sequel and because of (mostly) positive word-of-mouth. Much to like about IRON MAN 3, but also a grip of select quibbles.

The positives (don't worry, no spoilers):

- If you like Shane Black and his slick, high octane formula and his sense of humor, then prepare to get giddy
- The screenplay is sharp and emotionally charged and puts Stark thru his paces
- More of Downey, Jr. on camera, oozing charisma and demonstrating yet again that Stark is much more than a guy in an iron suit
- Expands the roles of Pepper, Rhodey, and even Happy
- It presents a startling take on one of Iron Man's classic adversaries. Ben Kingsley threatens to steal scenes from Downey
- Neat focus on the Mark 42 armor, on its strengths and weaknesses
- Somewhere along the way, Tony finds himself in Tennessee and runs into a kid sidekick (Disney's mandate?) and exhibits wonderful chemistry with him
- Ample references made to the Avengers movie (my favorite is probably Happy's comment about Tony's being too busy hanging out with his Superfriends)
- Humor, plenty of it
- ""Trevor Slattery,"" brilliant
- The post-credit scene
- Cool armor mayhem

The negatives:

- A few dead spots (usually when Downey's not onscreen)
- Diehard comic book fans may get upset over the treatment of the Mandarin
- Not a faithful adaptation of the fan favorite Warren Ellis ""Extremis"" arc (again depends on how much of a diehard comic book fan you are)
- Pretty tired of the often regurgitated super-soldier formula plotline
- Was the Ten Rings, a seed planted in the first IRON MAN, even mentioned in IRON MAN 3? (Maybe I missed it)
- Rebecca Hall's part is underdeveloped
- Late in the film, a cop out of what would've been a hell of a dramatic development
- Obstinately sidesteps explaining why none of Tony's Superfriends come to help out
- In the interest of having the cake and blah blah blah... not enough Iron Man
- May be Downey's swan song (if it is, it's a good way to bow out)",1367798400,4,5368,4.758324382384533
5642966,1,B00BL1BJFW,"After a better-than-average debut with a better-than-average cast for comics into film, this franchise has declined into mere eye-candy, and not very sweet at that.  The plot of Iron Man 3 is largely nonsensical, and barely serves to provide a prop for the next action or FX sequence.  As for the cast, gotta be the easiest money they've ever made (other than maybe Downey's $50M for Avengers), as little acting is required.  Per usual, performers like Cheadle, Kingsley, Paltrow and Pearce are utterly wasted, as -- for the most part -- is Downey himself.

If you're an avid fanboy, or action and visuals alone will amuse you for two hours, this may be the film for you.

5642967,4,B00BL1BJFW,"This 3rd, and I suspect last, entry of Marvel's Iron Man maintains the momentum of the predecessors thanks primarily to Robert Downey, Jr. as rich industrialist/inventor Tony Stark who outed himself as Iron Man in the first film.  Director Shane Black takes over the director's duties replacing Jon Favreau, who's still on board as Tony's friend Happy Hogan.  Even after The Avengers (which includes Iron Man) stomped the aliens month's earlier, human bad guys are still out to get America.  This time it's an Osama bin laden style character known as ""The Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley) or Man Darin as he is known in China.

The evil Mandarin takes aim at Tony after Stark promises to come after him.  Tony's great house is destroyed with Tony and live-in girlfriend Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) inside.  The Iron Man suit is malfunctioning and Tony must recover using his wits and plenty of movie magic.  He befriends a pre-teen boy named Harley (Ty Simpkins) who helps him get going again.  Tony is homing in on the Miami (!) based lair of The Mandarin who he has vowed to kill.

Introduced into the film are Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), a man with ideas that Stark shunned years earlier and his technical assistant Maya (Rebecca Hall) who Tony bedded that same night.  It appears Killian is supplying The Mandarin with the warfare needed to terrorize the world.  That includes some newly enhanced soldiers.  This all leads of course, to the big showdown and the filmmakers spare no expense.

The film is a bit of an anomaly.  On one hand it is a bit darker.  Tony has developed a case of severe anxiety for example.  But it also has plenty of humor, most of which is supplied by Downey, Jr.  And the Iron Man suits don't always work.  They stumble and fall.  So is there anything wrong?  Well sure.  For one, I would like to see more byplay between Pepper and Tony.  The actors have great chemistry together.  Why not exploit it?  There are some continuity issues.  There's a scene where Tony, without his suit, is fending off the bad guys in a darkened building.  He more than holds his own, both with his fighting and his shooting prowess.  In the climax however, he and his buddy Rhodey (Don Cheadle) are zeroing in on the bad guys and it appears Tony never fired a handgun before.  Quibbles?  Sure.  Iron Man 3 is loud, explosive and full of humor.  Great entertainment.",1367798400,,2369,4.677184466019417
5642978,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Let me start by saying that I can understand why there are a lot of split opinions about IRON MAN 3.  It's a film full of misdirection and deceptions, and I was a little distressed by a couple of them - which would give away too much to detail here.  Suffice it to say that there were a couple of moments I felt somewhat cheated; and though I'll be vague about it I can say it involved Mandarin. Still, read on; while I gave the movie four stars, I believe down the road I might very well revise this to a five.  I'll explain...

First of all, rest assured there is A LOT of action. And there are a lot of the Iron Suits, too...it's just that Tony Stark isn't often the one IN the suit.  I found myself often frustrated by that fact: Iron Man interruptus, if you will. Either the suits were off on their own, or they were on other people, or they weren't working properly...something that seemed to occur almost constantly.

I saw it in Imax 3D, and it was well worth the extra $$ to do so (given the fact that $17 is a RIDICULOUS price for a movie ticket in the first place). The movie was lush, packed with detail, and continuously drew me ""inside"" it.  The scenes of (don't panic about spoilers - these are in ALL the promos) Stark's house exploding and falling into the sea are meticulously crafted and extremely inclusive...I really felt the dimensional layers as the house was blown apart: I could feel the force of the detonation, and house collapsing, and the impact of the sea as the house AND Iron Man tumbled into it. Similarly, the moments where his suit fly through the air and ""find"" him, or the death-defying scenes aboard (and outside) Air Force One, and so many others throughout the film really do feel like you're there.

When it comes to the action you'd expect from a movie such as this, IRON MAN 3 is a rollicking, smash-mouth treat. Director Shane Black - whose only previous directorial role was on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiss-Kiss-Bang-Bang/dp/B002QYSZBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a>&nbsp;(which ironically served as Robert Downey, Jr.'s comeback film) - does a more-than-capable job, and the characters and events are big and loud. You'll feel like you are on a roller-coaster; while there are of course moments of crazy adrenaline rushes, there are also emotional ups and down.  But Tony Stark is just as glib as always, causing almost as much damage with his mouth as he does as with his armor.  I laughed a lot during the movie ... for those who care, Tony's mechanical manservant JARVIS (the voice of Paul Bettany) gets a good deal of air play here, and he's just as lovably bumbling as always.

Yet - and remember my dichotomy about this - the movie really focuses on Tony Stark OUTSIDE the suit. I wish the promos had clued me into this: our man Tony is experiencing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder because of what happened in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Avengers/dp/B008NCSZQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Avengers</a>. Had I been informed of that I wouldn't have felt slighted, and I think it would have better prepared me for this movie. I found myself constantly disappointed, even cheated, by the absence of Tony WITHIN the suit. I realize now that was the only way I felt Iron man was indeed Iron Man. Yet I will declare that now, looking back, I feel good about the movie, and I'm glad to have seen Tony as a more ""real"" person, as a more human man, a man undergoing a metamorphosis.

There are other things about this movie that surprised me - and I'm sure will surprise you - that I will NOT tell you. Just realize that while this is a very action-packed movie, it is also a personal one. It's this kind of writing that has typified the action movies of today, making them stand out above their ""super-hero"" predecessors. Like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight/dp/B001OGWY1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight</a>&nbsp;movies of Chris Nolan, these new, and better, powerhouse films are focusing on their heroes' moments of personal growth, warts and all. It's a trend I'm really happy to see.

5642979,1,B00BL1BJFW,"I'm reminded of a famous quote attributed to a musician Charles Ives paid so he could actually hear one of his compositions played. ""How do I get this terrible music out of my head?"" But Ives was a genius. This is a bombastic, franchise-ruining train wreck of a movie. No wit, no charm, no laughs- unless you count unintended humor. The good news is, I only saw it an hour ago and it's already fading away.

Not really a super hero movie at all, it works tirelessly to deconstruct the whole notion of heroism. Inexplicably set at Christmas time, (was this thing intended for release 6 months ago, then sent back to the shop when they realized what a turkey they had on their hands?) it manages to mock all the values held sacred by Americans until about five minutes ago. With all its duplication and redundancy (is that redundant?) poor Iron Man comes off as just an empty suit. Gone is the snarky uber-confidence you expect from Tony Stark.  Instead, you get a whiny, cringing ""vulnerable"" Iron Man.  No thanks.  More than just emotionally tone deaf, this thing is atonal. Iron Man 3 is emotionally incoherent, dramatically unsatisfying, spiritually empty.  Other than that, it's great.  View at your own risk.",1367712000,24,1212,4.720379146919432
5642980,5,B00BL1BJFW,"""Iron Man 3"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Brilliant industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man is pitted against an enemy whose reach knows no bounds. When Stark finds his personal world destroyed at his enemy's hands, he embarks on a harrowing quest to find those responsible. This journey, at every turn, will test his mettle. With his back against the wall, Stark is left to survive by his own devices, relying on his ingenuity and instincts to protect those closest to him. As he fights his way back, Stark discovers the answer to a question that has secretly haunted him: does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man?

The cast led by Robert Downey Jr. (excellent as usual as Tony Stark / Iron Man), Gwyneth Paltrow (as Pepper Potts), Don Cheadle (as Colonel James Rhodes), Guy Pearce (as Aldrich Killian) & Ben Kingsley (as The Mandarin) is excellent. The directing by Shane Black (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is excellent. The screenplay (based on the comic books by Stan Lee (who also executive produced), Jack Kirby, Don Heck & Larry Lieber) by Black & Drew Pearce is excellent.

The music by Brian Tyler is excellent. The cinematography by John Toll is excellent. The film editing by Peter S. Elliot & Jeffrey Ford is excellent. The casting by Sarah Finn is excellent. The production design by Bill Brzeski is excellent. The art direction by Second Chan, John Eaves, Alan Hook, Desma Murphy, Jay Pelissier & Brian Stultz is excellent. The set decoration by Danielle Berman, set designs by Brian Baker, David Moreau, Alex McCarroll & Timothy M. Earls, set dressings by Mark Bankins, Scott Edward Collins, Brendon Crigler, Amy Graham, Beejay Grob, Scott Johnson, Eric Luling, Gordon McVay, Matt Mizell, Jennifer Raneri, Nathalie Rhodes & Jason Williamson is excellent. The costume design by Louise Frogley is excellent. The special make-up effects by Michael Spatola is excellent. The special effects coordinated by Alec Muradian & supervised by Daniel Sudick is excellent.

The stunts coordinated by Jeff Habberstad, Mark Rounthwaite & Mike Justus, fights coordinated by Eric Oram & Philip J Silvera is excellent.

This is an excellent movie and follow-up to the first two ""Iron Man"" movies, landing in between the first ""Iron Man"" and ahead of the last ""Iron Man"". It is also an interesting follow-up, somewhat, to ""The Avengers"". This is also a well-made, well-done film that is entertaining, thematically and visually. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as usual as his fifth run as Tony Stark / Iron Man. Shane Black is an interesting replacement as director for Jon Favreau, who returns as executive producer and also as Happy Hogan. This is one of the best movies of the summer season, thus far, also an excellent movie to start the summer season off on, and also one of the best movies of the year, thus far, as well.",1367712000,7,3475,5.103690685413005

5642982,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man 3 isn't really a third movie, it's a 4th, following directly on from the Avengers. In fact, I'm surprised it has the 3 prefix instead of a subtitle like the other Phase 2 sequels do. Anyway, Tony Stark is still reeling from the Avengers and has spent his time having panic attacks and building a bunch of suits. The U.S. Government is trying to regain face after the attack on New York in Avengers, and so have turned War Machine into Iron Patriot (which did well in the polls) while trying to deal with a new terrifying threat, the Mandarin, a mix between Bin Laden and Genghis Kahn with one hell of an ax to grind against America.

Well, basically, there's a MAJOR twist. A film changing twist. One that comic  fans will hate, and people like me who don't mind these sort of changes if they're done well will love. One that no casual audience member is likely to get (though there is an early hint that film students like me should recognize as such). This twist involves the Mandarin, and it results in the biggest real world statement about the effects media has on the way we view terrorism that I've ever seen, as well as resulting in some of the best comedic moments that Marvel has ever had to offer. Don't believe the trailers, this is not The Dark Iron Man Rises, it's more about defining who Iron Man is without the suit through both serious scenes and comedy. This film is excellent, and exactly what Marvel should aim for moving forward. In my opinion, it matches Iron Man 1 for the best Marvel film except Avengers. If Marvel keeps doing unique, high quality, exciting, and original films such as this, then people won't get sick of superheroes and we might just see Kevin Feiges dream of James Bonding the Marvel Cinematic Universe happen. Warner Brothers, you have a lot to catch up with.

This movie is a movie where Tony Stark is on his own, there is no Captain America,Thor or S.H.I.E.L.D. to help him out this time. The fun part of this movie is the fact that it does link up the 1st ""Iron Man"" movie and you do see what the effects that the ""Battle of New York"" from ""The Avengers"" had on Tony Stark. It was great seeing Jon Favreau's character ""Happy Hogan"" having a cool part in the movie and seeing Gwyneth Paltrow's ""Pepper Potts"" not play the typical "" Damsel in Distress"" was great.  Don Cheadle as ""Rhody"" was a bigger part of this movie and did a really great job. All in all, everyone played their part and made a really great film that I highly recommend and that I hope to own and add to my 3D blu ray collection.

5642984,2,B00BL1BJFW,"With last summer's gargantuan financial and critical slam-dunk of Joss Whedon's THE AVENGERS, it's sure that any film following that from Marvel Studios would have its work cut out for it. And since it was the franchise that paved the way for THE AVENGERS, it's only natural that the film that would be the follow-up would be the third (and perhaps final) film in the IRON MAN series. With expectations extremely high, but a little shaken after the lukewarm response to IRON MAN 2 (which is a film I do really enjoy despite its flaws), people are sure to go in feeling comfortable in seeing star Robert Downey Jr.'s return to the sardonic wit, effortless charm, and supreme snark of Anthony Stark facing off against what fans consider to be his greatest villain, The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley, one of the finest living actors on Earth). And with fresh blood in the director's chair as Shane Black (whose only previous directorial feature was the criminally underrated KISS KISS, BANG BANG, but also is the screenwriter of the first LETHAL WEAPON, THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT and THE LAST BOY SCOUT) takes over for Jon Favreau, who directed Tony Stark's previous cinematic outings, this seemed sure to be a summer feast for the eyes and ears and mind.

But unfortunately, while this film may be somewhat entertaining, both the plot and the star seem to run on autopilot the whole film.

The central theme of the film is the answer to the question posed by Captain America to Stark during THE AVENGERS when he asks, ""Big man in a suit of armor; take that away, what are you?"" and this film is very determined to give you that answer. The film, also being a direct sequel to THE AVENGERS deals with Tony Stark's frame of mind in regards to the events of that film. He hasn't slept much, and has somewhat severe anxiety attacks whenever anyone brings up the events that almost led to his death in that film. It has alienated him from his girlfriend and CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, returning again), and he has spent all of his non-sleeping creating new armors. Meanwhile, a mysterious Bin Laden-esque terrorist known only as The Mandarin has been setting off explosions all over the world against American targets, prompting Tony's best friend James Rhodes (Don Cheadle, reprising his role he took over from Terrence Howard) to don the War Machine armor retrofitted to adopt a gaudy rebranding as The Iron Patriot. Another explosion hits much closer to home, critically wounding Tony's longtime friend and Stark Industries security chief Happy Hogan (Favreau), prompting Tony to hunt The Mandarin himself essentially inviting an attack on his home. Entering the picture at this time are Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall of THE TOWN), an old flame of Tony's and bioengineering expert and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), rival scientist for Advanced Idea Mechanics, who are both working on a project called Extremis. Tony's newest armor, the Mark 42, fails after the attack on his home, Pepper is kidnapped by The Mandarin, and Tony is forced to rely on his intellect and his savvy to make it to the final confrontation between him and the forces of The Mandarin, where, naturally, the free world hangs in the balance.

There are many things about this film that work: The snappy patter in this film is golden, and that's Black's bread-and-butter, if you've ever seen any of the films he's done; Ben Kingsley is absolutely magnetic as The Mandarin; and sequences like the Malibu house attack and parts of the second act where Stark is armorless and the scenes with Tony and Rhodey as they do the Riggs/Murtaugh prototypical buddy action stuff are terrific. However, for everything they do that's right, there's an equivalent number of things that go wrong. First, there is a very distinct lack of Pepper Potts in this film, and that loses big points right there. Black is someone that has never written women particularly well, and tends to use them more as damsels-in-distress rather than fully fleshed-out characters. Black does do a bit of a turn-around at the end with Pepper, but it seems like it was shoe-horned in. Secondly, there are some parts where the effects look downright clunky, but that's seldom. Also the second act is a MAJOR slog to get through, and the sequence where Stark has to MacGyver his way out of an assassin's grasp, while clever, feels very inorganic. The two most troublesome parts, though, are A: the autopilot that Downey is on as Stark, and B: the almost complete absence of actual plot. Tony Stark has become, for better or worse, Downey Jr's definitive role and he wears it brilliantly, but here in IM3, he seems like he's coming in for a visit to this character rather than living in it. Also, what's really going on in this film? Once a huge reveal is made about The Mandarin, the audience is left with far too little information. Why is this group doing all these things? How do certain players really fit in? What's their ultimate motivation? In the first film, Obidiah Stane wanted power. In the second, Vanko wants revenge and Justin Hammer wants the spotlight. Here, the villains seem to exist solely for the purpose of having a villain to fight, and that's just not enough.

Black's direction is much more confident in the non-effects oriented scenes, and the final battle sequence is far too spastic to maintain any focus, and the fate that meets one of the main characters that is meant to shock really doesn't provide any shocks. Yet, everything is wrapped up in a neat enough package and we get a post-credits sequence that, while hilariously funny, does nothing to continue setting up the future of Marvel's Cinematic Universe. There are some nice easter eggs for Marvel fans, such as the existence of Advanced Idea Mechanics and Roxxon, but neither are utilized for full effect. And Marvel and Iron Man fans are likely to be very disappointed by the big reveal of The Mandarin. I understand why, to an extent, this was done, and I found it alternately clever and frustrating, which sums up this film perfectly.

There's a lot of cleverness to IRON MAN 3 and it's not a terrible film, but ultimately, the film is undone by its own cleverness and that leads to a great deal of frustration in seeing what this film could have been rather than the bloated spectacle it is.

On the scale of films I rate this above the second feature, but below the first one and ""The Avengers."" In this movie there are references to the Avengers, or ""super friends"" and the worm hole, but they don't play a role. There were lines in this film written for us older guys such as ""You like that West World?"" something even the hip youngsters might miss. Iron Man is aided by Don Cheadle and a kid from Tennessee (Ty Simpkins). I was also glad to see Gwyneth Paltrow's role expanded.

(Among other things, she gets some real action-hero moments.) The villains are truly villainous, and that kid had a great role. The action keeps going to the end, with enough surprises to keep it from being predictable.

More than just an effect-fest, though, this has some complexity in at least some of the characters. Stark is forced to face his flaws, vanity in particular, and forced to deal with some very human weakness. In the end, it's not the super-suit that wins the day, it the man and the intelligence that wield the tool. And, if not the most subtle, it reminds everyone, not just scientists, that the best of intentions can be turned to dark purpose. It takes real moral strength and foresight to make sure that doesn't happen.

But, at heart, it's just a comic book movie, filled with comic book characters and Roadrunner physics, and I mean that in the very best way.

Iron Man 3 follows on the heels of both previous films Iron Man 2 and The Avengers.  A direct sequel to both films, this is a movie that will please fans of the film franchise but will most likely anger fans of the comic book.

A little history, before the analysis, if you can bear with me.  Prior to the release of the first film, Iron Man wasn't a particularly known character outside of comic book reader groups, and even inside it was usually considered a B-lister at best.  This all changed after the release of the first movie, at which point Iron Man's popularity skyrocketed as if propelled by his famous repulsor tech.  The character became more important in real life and inside Marvel's comic universe and all its iterations.  Before all this, some non-comic readers knew about the character due to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1994-s-Iron-Man-Animated-Series/dp/B0036EH3XO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1994's Iron Man Animated Series</a>, in which his most prominent foe was the one considered his nemesis in the comics: The Mandarin.

The Mandarin, who was a powerful sorcerer in the comics and animated series, had been teased in the previous two films in the franchise, and he finally makes an appereance here, re-imagined as a powerful terrorist leader.  The plot of the film focuses on Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) as he copes with post traumatic effects after the events on The Avengers, while also having to deal with both the threat of the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and the sudden re-appereance of Aldrich Killian (Guy Pierce), a man who wants to use Stark's resources to improve the human body beyond its capabilities but actually holds a grudge against Tony due to a past experience and doesn't reveal the true capabilities of his formula, codenamed ""Extremis"".  In the meantime, girlfriend Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) also has to deal with Killian, who used to be interested in her, and friend James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), formerly known as War Machine has had his armor outfitted with a new paint job and re-named Iron Patriot in order to instill a sense of security on the population in a time of terrorist threats and the aftermath of an alien attack.

Director Shane Black does a fantastic job with this movie.  Keeping with the tradition of the franchise of humor, cool tech and great action scenes (of which there's no shortage this time around), he tells a tale that advances the story and its characters without compromising the action.  Iron Man's new control-remote armor (which brings memories of Duck Tales' Gizmo Duck) is ridiculously cool.  The new biologically-altered foes pack a punch and are very visually appealing.  A scene with dozens of different Iron Man armors is fantastic and offers some great references to both the comics and the animated series.  As an aside, Iron Man finally gets a theme!  It's a great heroic piece, and I recommend you get the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/movie-s-Soundtrack/dp/B00B9JDAYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">movie's Soundtrack</a>&nbsp;just for it.

In the cerebral side of the story, we get to see a pretty hilarious buddy-cop relationship between Tony and a kid, Tony's realization that his past self has brought him more trouble than he could have imagined and his new self has trouble adjusting to a life of responsibility.  RDJ is as great as ever, of course.  Don Cheadle finally finds his footing in the interpretation of James Rhodes, and does a fantastic job.  Guy Pierce's Killian is not a terribly interesting character to begin with, and his story echoes too much The Riddler's from Batman Forever (this analogy is one of the first things that gets noticed the moment the guy shows up on screen at the beginning of the film, though, of course, this character has a more serious tone), but he knows how to be menacing and does bring some terrifyingly realistic villain moments.

And then there's the Mandarin.  And here is where the fanbase divides.  Fans of the film who didn't have previous knowledge from the character will have no problem with him.  Fans of the comics are likely to be mad to the point of hating the entire film for it.  I'm trying to be objective, so while I recognize this is a spectacular film, as a comic book fan I find what they did with the Mandarin unforgivable.  You see, I was a fan of the comic since I have memory.  The very first comic book I ever read over 25 years ago was an Iron Man issue in which he faced the Mandarin.  I was fascinated since then and I was excited for his appereance since the release of the first film.  After watching him here I suffered one of the greatest dissapointments in entertainment in my entire life.

You see, once word got out that Ben Kingsley was going to play the Mandarin, the fanbase divided (yep, again).  People wanted the Mandarin to be asian which not only it would have made sense considering his origin, but also his name.  I didn't mind much.  Kingsley is a fantastic actor, and considering that in the first film Stark was captured in the Middle East and not in Asia it made sense for the continuity of the franchise.  When the first footage of the Mandarin showed up, the fanbase divided (happens a lot, huh?).  Some people hated it because of the weird voice and looks, while others feared they might do a Nolanesque version and strip the character of his magic power.  I didn't care much, I just wanted to see Iron Man face the Mandarin on the big screen.  Then the movie happened and...

SPOILER ALERT!!!

It turned out the Mandarin is not real.  He's an invention.  An actor pretending to be a character that doesn't exist to give the press a target, to give the people someone to blame and hate for Killian's crimes.  After that reveal I spent the rest of the film looking for another twist that would either reveal that the guy was lying all along pretending to be a hired nobody and he would show his true power or that they were going to pull a Ra's Al Ghul and show that while Kingsley was a fake the real Mandarin was still in the background.  It didn't happen.  This movie single-handedly destroyed this and all future opportunities for this franchise to represent Iron Man's greatest nemesis.

END SPOILER

You see, I understand what they were going for.  And it works great for the film.  But there's absolutely no doubt that they could have easily pulled this off with a villain specifically made for this film.  Or maybe a lesser villain that no one cared about.  Or they could have reversed the roles of Killian and the Mandarin (since in the comics Killian was there just for one story arc, while the Mandarin has a long story of facing Iron Man) Picture if The Dark Knight had revealed at the end that the Joker hadn't killed anyone.  All of his victims were actors hired by the Joker's father to please his son, who was an autist.  And it turned out that the main villain of the movie was King Tut.  They could have easily made the same point without defacing Iron Man's greatest villain.

On the plus side, Kingsley is clearly having a lot of fun playing the character, and he does a wonderful job with what he has.  But this only makes me think he would have also made a wonderful job if he had something better to work with.

So yeah, while I don't think this particular problem kills the movie, it takes one star away for being a slap to the face of the comic fans, who are the entire reason this franchise exists in the first place.  Make no mistake, this is still a great movie, but sadly there's a huge amount of lost potential.",1367712000,5,7944,4.779325513196481

5642993,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Prior to being released, Iron Man 3 had a lot to live up to. Not only was it the third installment in the wildly successful Iron Man series, it was also the first movie in the Marvel universe to be released after the record-shattering and ultimate team-up flick, The Avengers. With the charismatic Robert Downey Jr. once again in the title role, and with the addition of veteran screenwriter Shane Black at the helm, Iron Man 3 officially kicks off the second phase of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, and brings us Tony Stark in his most vulnerable state yet.

Iron Man 3 is a completely different animal than the previous two films in the series. Rather than overusing the spectacle of the Iron Man armors like the previous film, Iron Man 3 tells us the story of the man beneath the armor. In fact, this is very much a story about Tony and his beliefs, and shows the playboy philanthropist donning the armor only a handful of times throughout the movie. There are elements in the film not typically found in superhero flicks, along with underlying themes that really add to the story including the war or terror, propagandization, and revenge. It gives us Tony Stark at the most vulnerable point in his time as Iron Man, and tells a great story of a man trying to reconcile his past.

This movie is very much a Shane Black film that's filled with witty dialogue and choppy quips, and has a definite ""buddy cop"" feel to it. Black, the writer behind Lethal Weapon and Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, is a master of smart and pop culture injected lines, of which there is no actor better suited to deliver than RDJ. The direction Black has taken the character tells a darker tale than has been told before, but the outcome is one that works very well.

As it turns out, the movie I saw ended up being very different from the one I expected to see...in a good way. The story contains some twists that I did not see coming, and that the marketing team did a good job of hiding in the trailers. There's some spectacular action sequences, particularly the aerial rescue and the final thirty minutes, and a lot more humor than the trailers will have you believe. There's also some memorable performances from the supporting cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow, who is given a more action-oriented role, Don Cheadle, who has some fun back-and-forth exchanges with RDJ, Ben Kingsley as the memorable Mandarin (and who steals the show by the way), and Guy Pearce as the mysterious and manipulative Aldrich Killian. I was also pleasantly surprised by the casting of youngster Ty Simpkins, who, somehow, manages to out-banter Tony Stark.

It may not be as high-flying or action-packed as the previous films, but it's a very worthy successor to The Avengers, and a terrific addition to the Marvel universe.",1367625600,3,2776,4.682377049180328
5642994,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Took my son & girlfriend to see Iron Man 3 yesterday in theaters. They both said it is their favorite Iron Man of the 3 films. I enjoyed it a lot. Yet I felt it wasn't how I had expected it to be. The film is packed with action,some humor,great special effects,ect..! But if your like me (& my son) and read and collect comics (including Iron Man). Then you may feel how I do. The villain in this Iron Man is Mandarin (or is it?). The film starts off with Stark saying how he had made a enemy without even knowing it. It. Reflects on a part of his life (New Years eve 1999). After a few minutes, the film is back to current times. As the film progresses. Tony has difficulty sleeping. And also has some occasional panic attacks. Still kinda easing over what had happened in The Avengers film. ""Mandarin"" taps into TV stations air waves & shows clips of war,corruption,ect..while talking about how America is bad. Tony (Iron Man) pretty quickly is approached by media, & threatens Mandarin. Evn giving Mandarin an invitation to bring the fight to him @ his house, then gives out his house address. Some choppers soon start to attack Tony (and Pepper & a another character) while they are inside Tony's house. Tony is believed to be dead. He winds up passing out in his suit, as it is going to a destination. He met a kid while breaking into a garage to repair his suit. The kid ends up helping him out. Meanwhile Rhodey (Iron Patriot/War Machine) is supposed to protect the president. As the film progresses, Tony encounters a few enemies which body heats up. Eventually Stark (Iron Man) works his way to where Mandarin is. However, his suit is recharging in the kid's garage. He encounters ""Mandarin"" and finds out that this man is just an actor protraying as Mandarin. Pepper get's abducted by the real Mandarin. She also is starting to have Mandarin's methods of making skin heat up, done to her. Rhodey loses his Iron Patriot suit to the real Mandarin. And Tony,Rhodey, a army of Stark's Iron Man suits (controlled by Stark) end up all being where Pepper,the president (who also was abducted) and the real Mandarin. Of course a big battle ensues & in the end justice prevails. However, it is Pepper doing some major butt-kicking at the very end! All in all good, solid film. But those that follow comic book story lines may not like the adaptation they see of Mandarin. The ""real"" Mandarin in this film is not even like the Mandarin from the comic storyline. The actor looks like the comic version. And the ""real"" one in the film does not look like him or anything. He didn't have Mandarin's rings or nothing! I was able to look past these differences and enjoy the film. Others however say it ruined the film. Also some don't like that Tony isn't in his suit nearly as much this time. And when he is, it get's ruined shortly after. Aso Rhodey doesn't do much at all in the War Machine/ Iron Patriot suit.  Some may say that if it were more true to the comic storyline, it would be predictable. That's true. But I feel it could've been more true to the comic (character-wise) and comic story line in some ways. But add other elements to make the story/plot different for those that do read the comics! Overall I'd give it a 4 or 4.5 out of 5. I collect & read comics, and still look forward to buying the Blu-ray and watching it again! Is it the best of the 3 films!?! To some yes, to others it is the worst. It all boils down to personal opinions. For me I don't feel it is the best. However, I really like all 3 so I don't know the order of best-worst for me, they all rock!",1367625600,4,3579,4.390060240963855
5642995,4,B00BL1BJFW,"One of the things that Marvel has done so well with their series of movies has been to keep the characters true to their comic book origins. I say Marvel in the sense of the movies that Marvel has done, not in the sense of all of their characters (because, if you look at what Sony did to Wolverine and will be doing to him again this summer, you will find that non-Marvel companies have not handled the characters quite so faithfully). With that in mind, I was looking very forward to the Mandarin as the villain in Iron Man Three.

The Mandarin, for all intents and purposes, is Iron Man's nemesis. He pre-dates the Iron Man comic book just as Iron Man does [Iron Man made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39, the Mandarin in issue #50], so I was expecting something... well, I was expecting something epic. Iron Man's greatest foe and all of that. That is not even close to what Marvel delivered with this movie, and I can't say more than that without offering spoilers. Let's just say that I was... disappointed with the Mandarin, especially given that it was Ben Kingsley. Not that Kingsley didn't do a great job; he did. I mean, he was fantastic in the role that they wrote for him; it just wasn't the role I wanted to see him in.

Here's the thing, for most of you out there, the vast most of you, the most of you that didn't spend more than a decade reading Iron Man comic books, there will be no issue with the role of the Mandarin at all. See, it works great in the movie. Which is what causes my divergence of opinion. On the one hand, I'm disappointed with the portrayal of the Mandarin, but, on the other, Iron Man Three was completely enjoyable to watch and has a lot going for it. In my head, I know that the continuity that the Marvel movies is setting up is not the same as it is in the comics, but that doesn't change my emotional reaction to it. The ""why did they change that?"" reaction.

Of course, it's comic books, and, maybe, they didn't change anything. It is conceivable that the Mandarin will still become who and what he is in a later movie. Or, maybe, he's that, now, but they're just hiding it.

As for the movie itself, it was quite good. Robert Downey, Jr. was amazing as always. It's a more personal movie than the previous two in a lot of ways. Tony is dealing with... issues, mostly brought on by his experiences in New York during the alien invasion in The Avengers. For much of the movie, he's effectively alone without any armor, and it was interesting to see Tony operating as a person rather than an iron man. Downey pulled that off with what appeared to be effortless ease.

Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle were respectable in their roles. Even Guy Pearce was adequate. Okay, probably more than adequate, but I really don't like the guy, so, when he plays a villain, he gets an automatic boost from me in that regard, so I actually have a difficult time in telling whether he's doing a good job or not, because I'm not going to like him anyway. I'll know that he can actually act if he ever bothers to play a good guy and he can make me like him. And, as I stated, Ben Kingsley was amazing. He really was.

Iron Man Three is slightly different in structure than the other two. It starts with an opening narration, and I don't tend to be fond of narration in movies. Of course, it ties in with the way the movie ends, which almost makes it worth it, but not quite. It also starts and, then, jumps back, which I'm also not fond of, but, at least, it didn't do a ""three days earlier"" or anything like that.

Also, the CGI is a bit... clunky... in this one. I didn't know why until I got home and looked it up: ILM did not do the effects on this one. Now, that is something I completely don't understand. ILM did the effects for both other Iron Man movies and The Avengers, so why switch when Disney owns ILM, now? If it was that they were too busy with the new Star Wars, I could understand, but they have at least half a dozen films coming out this year that they're doing the effects for, so having someone else do this Iron Man seems odd to me. Oh, well, I'm sure it was cheaper. It's always about the money, right?

So, yeah, as a movie, I liked it. It's great, in fact. But that doesn't stop me from being ambivalent.",1367625600,,4269,4.274752475247524

Which really keeps the film in a standing direction and not boring. It really makes you think what's gonna happened next. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. I love how through the film it shows Tony as not being the savior the whole time and having very human reactions. The twist with the Mandarin and Killian now that was funny. Love how Tony is determined to pull through for love and how she keeps him grounded. Pepper is incredible in this. Just such an awesome cast and story-line.

5643009,5,B00BL1BJFW,"""Iron Man 3"" is a blockbuster, serge forward, non-stop action movie
with a few surprises, a couple disappointments and wallop of
bigger-than-life, special effect-filled screens.

Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is back, and after fighting with the
Avengers, faces a new threat, a terrorist named Mandarin (Ben
Kingsley)and a new foe Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). We also see James
Rhodes/Iron Patriot ( Don Cheadle) who helps Tony out in his time of
crises. Not only is Tony facing the anxiety of keeping Pepper
Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow) safe, but also learns that it's the man that
makes the suit.

I love the special effects in this flick. The suits get better and
better. The way they move, attach, fight and look is wonderful. Robert
Downey Jr. continues his character development as Tony Stark and I love
every minute he's on screen. Gwyneth Paltrow is fantastic. She's not
just a damsel in distress. She saves Tony two different times and has a
likable, lovable personality. The story is very engaging and the dialog
is great. The one thing I don't like is the intellectual twist. I have
mixed feelings about the turn of events in this film. My inner die-
hard, comic book-loving side is disappointed, but my film critic side
sees it as genius.

My favorite character is Harley (Ty Simpkins), a boy who befriends Tony
and helps repair the Iron Man suit. Harley is bright, independent and a
little too much like Tony. When you put the two together, you get
non-stop laughter.

The moral of the story is: it's not the suit that makes the man, it's
the man that makes the suit. Tony can't sleep because he gets
nightmares, so he spends all his time at night making more suits to
protect himself and Pepper. The truth is, he saves Pepper without the
suit.

My favorite scene is the final battle. The action is larger-than-life.
The different suits, the way they fight, make you want to cheer. It
gets you to the edge of your seat; it's intense, fast and
action-packed,

I recommend this to 11 year-old and up. Bad language is low and the

give this 5 stars. Even if the twist is a little disappointing, it's
still amazing.

5643010,4,B00BL1BJFW,"I almost skipped opening day of Iron Man 3, but was able to clear the afternoon for my wife and I to go see ol' Shell Head in action for his third solo outing.

We went to see it in IMAX 3D as I had a couple of free passes. While the 3D effect is very good, I didn't think it added much to the movie and wasn't nearly as effective as The Avengers was in 3D.

Iron Man 3 runs around 2 hours (2 hours long when credits start to roll) and 15 minutes, but feels longer. If not for Robert Downey's ability to captivate an audience, this film may have been a complete bore. It has a decent story even if a bit incoherent, the special effects are excellent with tons of new Iron Man suits and gadgets, but the Iron Man action is quite sparse until the big finale.

The trailers showed us Iron Man's arch enemy was going to be the main villain, but The Mandarin is completely wasted in the film and the only association with the character in the comic book is in name only.

You would think this would be a huge disappointment, but once I realized the joke being played on us, I got over it and decided to just enjoy the film for what it is. The Mandarin does give the film a few laughs, but it would have been cool to have Iron Man fight another villain instead of variations of Iron Men like in the finale of the first two films.

I'm sure there is going to be hell to pay from any Iron Man fan boys seeing this film and I don't blame them. I have gotten to a point where I am just happy to see quality super hero films regardless of such liberties....Life is short, go with it and relax guys.

******SPOILER ALERT******

All the main characters are back, but it seems like they are all conveniently ""busy"" Happy is in a coma after a run in with the super villain, Pepper is running Stark Industries and also has a run in with the super villain, Rhodes is now Iron Patriot  also has a run in with the super villain...yadda yadda yadda.......

******* END OF SPOILER******

If not for Downey this film would fall apart, but somehow it doesn't. I was interested throughout even if I wondered from time to time when the hell is Iron Man going to kick some A$$!

For some reason in the world of super hero movies, the film makers think that we must give the super hero outrageous disadvantages and put them up against ridiculous odds.

While this tactic may work for drama's sake, it is extremely frustrating for fans to have to watch our hero being continually beaten about all the time, Downey takes so much punishment in this outing that he barely keeps his Iron suit on for more than a minute at a time.

Of course the end battle is spectacular and in my opinion the best of the three films in this department(one reason being, I'm sick of Iron Man fighting other Iron Men!). After the giant battle the ending is wrapped up quickly and is a little strange too as it leads us to believe that Iron Man is no more, at least as we know him. I doubt this is the case and we all know in the land of movies, no one is ever truly gone.......especially if there is big money to be made! They better secure Downey for future Iron Man appearences because he carried this film from start to finish!",1367625600,5,3180,4.201970443349754
5643011,3,B00BL1BJFW,"I'm beginning to think that these superhero movies are toying with their fans and viewers, doing just enough to keep people wanting more with each movie they release. You come expecting to see Batman or Iron Man and mostly you get a lot of scenes of Bruce Wayne or Tony Stark either unable to be their alter egos because their stuck in a hole, hurt, emotionally scarred, trying to fix their suit, or maybe they haven't become their alter-egos yet and we need half the movie to get there. Or maybe the script, in the case of Iron Man 2, is just bad and you get the entire core of the movie without Iron Man; with the exception of a brief scene where Tony Stark is drunk and shooting fruit at a party. Could these billion-dollar franchises be saving money on special effects, or was my initial assessment correct?

Iron Man 3 is no exception. Without giving too much away, the middle of the movie is spent with Tony Stark suit less because it needs to be fixed. So, ultimately we get the same thing we got in Iron Man 2; a setup, a big scene in the beginning, a talky middle and a slam-bam finish. The good news is, the middle and mostly Iron Man free part is not without action, it is just Tony Stark doing the action, with some Iron-Manish gadgets. This is why I believe this trend of superhero movies with sparse superhero moments is not unintentional. To me though, ""Iron Man 3"" is without question the best of the trilogy; although that isn't saying much.

Fortunately for ""Iron Man 3"", you can't cut out the core of the movie and still get the gist of it. While it does do the same thing as ""Iron Man 2"", the story is intricate, complex and thought provoking. While Stark is out of sorts and without a suit, he becomes a bit of a Sherlock Holmes, figuring out the mystery of who the terrorist `The Mandrin' is and where he will strike next. We miss Iron Man through those scenes, but we are still invested in the film and sure enough when the suit finally reaches its full potential, we get what we paid for in a smash up finale that was right up there with ""The Avengers"".

Although, while he spent the entire movie fixing one suit, he manages to call up dozens of suits to help out with this big finale. Which didn't make sense, and once again proves my point about MONEY being the dictator for these scripts instead of LOGIC.

It's not like these studios don't have money or know that the current movie they're working on is gonna make its money. This is a billion dollar franchise people. BILLION. With a B. So why do we keep getting the same screenplays where our hero is disabled or unable or emotionally scarred for some unknown reason for most of the movie? I just don't want these studios and all the billions their making off of us, to think they can nickel-and-dime us like everybody else in the world is these days. I'm onto their game. I'm calling them on it. Nonetheless, it is Iron Man, and for now, it's the only Iron Man we got, so I'll probably still buy their nickle-and-diming blu-ray with the money-saving screenplay.

5643012,5,B00BL1BJFW,"I attended the premiere of Iron Man 3 on May 3rd in 3D.  It was spectacular!

The acting, the visuals; you name it!  Iron Man 3 is epic!  Iron Man 3 is about Tony Stark's past haunting him, and a new evil rising, The Mandarin.  There are a few surprising twists in this film that may confuse you, but they turn out to be funny ones!  I find that Iron Man 3 is the most comedic movie in the franchise, from jokes to puns and beyond.  This adds to the lighter tone of this movie.  I recommend this movie for children over eight, for there are several frightening scenes in it.  In the end, Iron Man 3 is the best film of 2013, and possibly one of the greatest superhero movies ever made.

I recommend this movie.",1367625600,2,710,4.116788321167883
5643013,5,B00BL1BJFW,"Where all this talk of constant explosions and non-stop action are coming from is a mystery to me since there are only three major action sequences in the film and the rest is all about showing the effect Avengers had on Tony Stark and how bad decisions can cause irreparable damage.

My only complaint about the film is how the main villain is developed. There's not enough time spent on him/them to really give us an accurate picture of who they are and what their motivations are. By the end of the film, if you've paid attention, it becomes very clear and is actually a really great idea.

But the overall point of this movie was about developing Tony Stark outside of the Iron Man suit. Is it the man or the tech that's the hero? This movie answers that question and, albeit too quickly, wraps up a major part of Tony's story. Still, the dialog was great, the jokes don't feel forced and the villain is actually way more menacing and threatening than what we got in Iron Man 2.

I won't say this one was as good as the first film. I think when the first one came out it was this amazing fresh idea that took everybody by surprise and maybe a lot of people are going into this one expecting the same. It's hard to be surprised by something twice, though this movie does factor in a couple of really smart ideas.

If you're one to hate it when these comic book movies deviate from the comic story, you're going to have a bad time. Do yourself a favor and stay home. Or go see something else. At least then you won't have wasted your time/money. You'll feel better in the long run.

For everybody else who understands why these stories aren't brought to the screen verbatim from the comic book page and/or you loved The Avengers and its predecessors, you'll most likely enjoy this movie. Be forewarned, it is still very different from all the ones that came before it. The story is heavily character focused on Tony Stark and that means other characters really don't get a lot of screen time, at least not as much as they should (Pepper Potts). I didn't see it in 3D so I can't comment on if that's worth it or not, but I usually get a headache from the glasses anyway and I'm more interested in the story than something that often comes off as a gimmick to get more money out of me. Movie tickets cost enough as it is.",1367625600,4,2321,4.338709677419355
5643014,4,B00BL1BJFW,"You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this movie!

First off, I will admit to being a total Shane Black fangirl, having enjoyed his other work immensely, so I was giddy when I found out he was hired to direct.

I must say, I think he did a great job and for those that are familiar with his other work, you'll notice just seconds in that this is definitely ""A Shane Black Movie"". Iron Man 3 has a very different feel to it than that of it's predecessors, but in my opinion it's a very welcome change. I've seen some reviews say that they disliked the fact that the story had such a dark tone and that it felt too emotional for a superhero flick. I understand where that crowd is coming from. Heavy storylines and superheroes seem to be almost an oxymoron. Usually, the plot for a comic book movie is pretty linear: (Solely my opinion) There's a hero/and/or heroes, a conflict/villain, said villain then causes destruction and the hero(es) face impossible odds but then figure out a way to save the day and the movie ends on a high note.

Iron Man 3 is *not* that movie. In fact, I think I enjoyed the third installment that much more because of it's emotion and darker storyline. I enjoyed seeing Tony shattered and desperate, doubting himself, waging an internal war with himself in the wake of the events seen in ""The Avengers"".Even though it's a movie intended to entertain, I think by showing the audience a vulnerable Tony Stark, it let's them know that even ""superheroes"" struggle with everyday problems like everybody else.

Besides, we see him struggle with personal issues, guilt and self-doubt all the time in the comics, I found it refreshing that they chose to deal with Tony's anxiety and nightmares directly rather than, presenting the problem, kind of dealing with said problem and then either sweeping it under the rug or forgetting that they put it in the script altogether like they did with Iron Man 2.

Now, that doesn't mean the movie is exquisitely perfect. There are plenty of plotholes too and in my opinion, the use of flashbacks really mess up the whole cinematic timeline of Iron Man as we know him and that was the only thing that *really* bothered me. Also, the movie essentially takes several storylines from Iron Man's history and puts them altogether. I'll admit, that's not what I was expecting. I thought the plot would focus more on the Extremis virus than it did, but I didn't mind at all. I think that's one of the main gripes that people have with it. When they said Extremis, I think everyone expected something very similar to Warren Ellis' beautifully written comic.

Another thing that will rub some people the wrong way, especially if you're a die-hard comics purist, is the fact that there's a pretty big twist involving The Mandarin. This is another common gripe I've been seeing on various sites. I personally didn't mind it, but judge for yourself.

Overall, I thought it was a really fun, entertaining movie and a great way to get the summer started! If you're willing to keep an open mind, silence that little voice in your head that screams ""inconsistency!"" or ""Plothole!"" every time something differs from the comic and just have fun and enjoy yourself, Iron Man 3 definitely satisfies!",1367625600,5,3247,4.666083916083916
5643015,2,B00BL1BJFW,"Going into this film, you think ""What could go wrong? Marvel has just come off Avengers, and has an established hero in his third film."" Then this movie happens. What went wrong? First, Stark has 42 suits of armor to choose from, and he consistently wears the only one that can't fly and has technical difficulties. Second, they choose the Mandarin for his villain (a great choice) and then choose to completely destroy the whole character with this treatment of him. Third, the end of the film drags on forever as Stark just keeps getting beat down and goes up against the villain that just...won't...die! Every time he goes down, there he is again. It gets so horribly monotonous.

And here's a thought: why not let Stark actually WEAR ARMOR? This is the third film, shouldn't he be in the suit for at least half of it? And the final wrap up with Stark was absolutely abysmal, as they deviate DRASTICALLY from the comics. I see no way they could do another film for Stark with it left this way.

This is a dangerous misstep for Marvel, as this is the beginning of ""Phase 2"" and if their other upcoming films don't do better (and to be fair, Iron Man 3 didn't set the bar very high at all) then this could begin the decline and eventual death of Marvel's movie franchise.

So ultimately, how bad is this film? Let me put it in perspective: it makes ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" look good. And forget the after-credit sequence this time out...it's just a waste of time.",1367539200,15,1475,4.51685393258427

-The bad guys, bio-engineered flame beings, whatever they are...were overpowered. WAY overpowered.
-If the one you love is missing and you're not sure where they are and if they are dead or alive, is it time to make stupid jokes? No...didn't think so!
-The suit(s) are way underpowered.
-I think Tony was in one of the suits a total of 6 minutes? I'd have to watch it again to time it but I won't subject myself to this movie again.
-Tony is basically a genius in movies 1 and 2. This Tony? Well, to put it nicely he is a neurotic basket-case.",1367539200,22,1131,4.566502463054187
5643017,2,B00BL1BJFW,"After watching this Film in Real 3-D today  I had to be the voice of Negative Reason
Save your cash
Watch The Dark Knight Rises imagine Iron Man instead of Batman and you have this Shame of a Film
I'll be without a doubt the only Person who actually found plenty of fault with this Lazy attempt to just make a HUGE Amount of money from the movie going Public!
I'm pretty sure the two screen writers were watching The Dark Knight Rises and had a laugh
""We should copy elements of this Film for Iron Man 3""  and this they did Just poorly and lazy without having any regard of any Negative criticism  (But, lets be Honest you can't be Negative when it comes to anything Marvel Studio puts out nowadays)
In this day and age God Forbid you attack Huge Money Drawing Comic Book Film Adaptions and of course The Walking Dead

Pros: You get some awesome Preview Trailers for The Wolverine, and Man of Steel!!!
You have a strong cast of actors  (I'm not faulting any of the actors in this Flick you have two amazing actors in Ben Kingsley and Guy Pearce as Solid ""Real"" Bad Guys
In fact  when Hollywood decides to do yet Another Re-Boot of Batman Cast Guy Pearce as The Joker
The Concept is good but, it just stands still (The Story could've been in League with The Dark Knight Rises but, the writers just phoned it in)
Shane Black co-wrote the script (Co-wrote is the key  Shane is a Solid Action Film writer) So why is this without a doubt his weakest Story
my guess would be the deadline from studio and the co-writer
This film was made and financed purely to make money and I'm talking about HUGE Box office money

Cons: This film is Nothing more then a Tech Demo for the Big Wigs at Both Paramount & Disney to Push 3-D into all Homes (Keep in mind some scenes had No 3-D at all Flat Smooth Scenes)
The film is way to long.......  There are scenes that have no point in the Film (Picture this Scene down in AL there's this Crazy Bar fight with guns being fired and loud explosions! a few miles away they are having a Porn Star wannabe  Bikini Contest WHY??? (OOhh yes to pop Stan Lee into the Film) No Point
There is another Scene with the Presidents Air Plane Exploding with people falling out (Another waste of time for a scene just to fill time.... when it started it looked extremely  real (I'm amazed they kept the start of the exploding scene intact) But, keep in mind once you see all the people falling down it looks very fake the 3-D don't help sell the gag
Lack of a Solid Story there are slight little hint of something there but, nothing really progresses
They bring some stupid kid in no real point.... he's only put in to help Tony get his suit back  (I understand why The Studio did it so children can put, themselves into the kids shoes)
the story progression very weak (They hide lack of a Strong Story in just scene after scene of Action sequences for the sake of action sequences
Great Idea Paramount & Disney
Jon Favreau who directed and acted in Both Iron Man & Iron Man 2
makes a very small appearance as Happy Hogan but gets Blown-up (Doesn't that just say something if you think about it?!?  All the Nonsense that went down making this piece of garbage)
This film was made and financed purely to make money and I'm talking about HUGE Box office money

90 minutes in I wanted just to walk out
IMO Just a Huge disappointment all around but, of course it will hit Massive numbers (Cause all the Critics Gush and maybe just maybe there is some old school payola going on to help push it)
Like i said maybe I'm just way to picky God Forbid I get a Solid Story (Like in The Avengers)

5643028,1,B00BL1BJFW,"My 11 year old son and I went in with high hopes... soon dashed by the endless explosions, cutesy jokes, exaggerated cgi, pointless 3D, and mindless plot.

Ben Kingsley and the Mandarin character: totally wasted.

I wonder... Do Marvel, the writers, the directors, start out wanting to make this kind of movie?",1367539200,20,310,4.9423076923076925
5643029,5,B00BL1BJFW,"I have to say though, the trailers are misleading.  They make you think this is a darker, grittier post avengers film about Stark dealing with his mortality and so on.  In reality, the movie is a lot of fun, and may be the most humorous of the three.  It also is the most action packed, having three large action setpieces and many smaller moments in between.

The portrayal of the Mandarin may be a put off for some, but I thought it was an enjoyable development to the plot.  The plot had some nice twists and turns and was engaging throughout, without any real lulls in the pacing.  The Extremis powered fights were entertaining, and I particularly enjoyed James Badge Dale as Eric Savin.  However, this is Starks movie through and through.  Tony spends the movie coming to terms with being a smaller piece in a much larger world, and he is learning that his past has consequences in the world and on those he cares about.  It is at times very introspective, and this is the heart of the movie. Robert Downey Jr. does a great job balancing humor and a bit of edge as Tony Stark, who is less smarmy then in previous installments, but rather an emotional mess.

Returning and new cast members are all great.  I thought Don Cheadle's Rhodey had a better banter with Stark in this movie, and they seemed to be better friends then in Iron Man 2.  Gwenyth Paltrow's Pepper is given more to do in this film given that her relationship with Stark is more central to the plot, which is a nice improvement.  Guy Pierce is effective in his portrayal as a snarkey and cockey scientist, and Ben Kingsley...not much can be said without spoiling things, but suffice to say he delivers.

It is not a perfect movie, with the humor occasionally falling flat and some occassional choppy editing.  The portrayal of the Mandarin may not be welcome to some, and the motivations of the villains are a bit hazy as we never really learn what the endgame is, but those are small complaints to an otherwise very enjoyable movie.  Go in ready to have some fun and some laughs, but also for a deeper look at the man behind the mask.  To me, the original Iron Man film is still undefeated, but 3 was no slouch, delivering an immensely enjoyable action packed ride with plenty of laughs in between.

4 1/2 out of five.  (But I'll round up to five as the stars won't let me use halfs.)",1367539200,5,2356,4.44988344988345

5643031,1,B00BL1BJFW,"The trailers, I think, completely misdirect you on what Iron Man 3 is going to be about.  The trailers make you think that there's going to be the big Iron Man-Mandarin fight that's been teased since the Ten Rings were introduced in the first Iron Man movie.  You're made to believe that Tony Stark needs to make all of those new armors to take down the Mandarin.

Guess what?!?  Shane Black has decided to give a big middle finger to the comic book fans, and then try to make some movie that means something to him; creates tons of new product to license; and appeals to little kids.  If you have seen the movie, you know what I mean.  Shane Black has, I think, completely ruined the Iron Man movie franchise.  The only great thing about Iron Man 3, I think, was the post-credits scene.  The post-credits scene was the only thing that stopped me from asking for a full refund.

Disney and Marvel, if you are reading this, DO NOT ever, ever let Shane Black work on any Marvel movie in the future!  If I was Disney and Marvel right now, I would grovel and ask for forgiveness from comic book fans.  I would give whatever money Robert Downey Jr. wanted, while assuring Downey Jr. that Iron Man 4 will not have a little kid steal the spotlight and have a showdown between Iron Man and a major comic book villain.  Disney and Marvel should let the door kick Shane Black and then tell this guy never to come back!

Yes, I was so disgusted and disappointed with Iron Man 3 that I'm not going to buy any disc release or digital download release.

If you thinking about seeing Iron Man 3, cancel your movie tickets and get a full refund!  Turn back now!

5643032,3,B00BL1BJFW,"Since the conclusion of Marvel's The Avengers last summer, everyone has been begging for details about how the 2012 juggernaut will impact Iron Man III.  The list of questions has been endless, but the biggest question (outside of plot points) is 'can Iron Man III live up to the worldwide success of The Avengers?'  The fact is The Avengers is the biggest summer blockbuster of all-time.  It sits at number three on the list of the top-grossing films of all-time.  So, how do you follow that kind of success?  The easiest way to answer that question is to just admit that it's silly to think any film will ever top The Avengers in terms of success - at least any other comic book film, that is.  We saw The Dark Knight Rises fall in the aftermath of The Avengers, so if Chris Nolan's Batman couldn't surpass the success of The Avengers, how can another Iron Man sequel can do it?  The answer to that question is: momentum.  Simply put, the interest created by The Avengers will most likely thrust Iron Man III to heights most people couldn't possibly imagine.  Regardless, this is just speculation and it's far too early to tell how Iron Man III will play out at the box office, but in terms of the overall quality of the film - well, we have that answer for you.

Directed by Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Iron Man III stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man.  In the wake of the events that took place during the invasion of New York, Tony Stark has not been able to sleep and frequently experiences panic attacks.  Waiting for the next big attack to strike, Stark has been in his basement building an army of Iron Men, all the while a terrorist leader, The Mandarin (Ben Kinsley), has been strategically setting off bombs all over the United States.  One of these bombs catches Stark's old body guard and new Stark Industries' chief of security, Happy Hogan, in the crossfire - which quickly gains Stark's attention.  At the same time, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearch) has made his presence known, using an ""explosive"" new state of the art rehabilitation program, known as Extremis.  Suddenly, Stark finds himself trapped in the evil web of The Mandarin, along with the impact of the Extremis program, not to mention struggling to protect the people he cares about most.  Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Rebecca Hall, and Jon Favreau also star in supporting roles.

Coming as no surprise, Iron Man III's screen time belongs largely to Robert Downey Jr.  Obviously, Downey Jr. continues with the character he's made famous and doesn't miss a beat with his usual wit and charm.  Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow both play their usual supporting roles as (respectively) the armored sidekick War Machine (now called The Iron Patriot) and the damsel in distress.  The best part of comic book films is that they're always chalked full of goodies, including character additions.  Iron Man III sees the addition of Iron Man's arch-nemesis, The Mandarin, played by Sir Ben Kinsley - who is nothing short of a treat in this film.  They honestly couldn't have picked a better actor to portray this villain (there's a huge swerve involving this character).  Finally, like Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell in the previous Iron Man films, Guy Pearce fills the role of the jealous scientist, desperate to destroy Tony Stark - just because he's smarter than everyone else.  Sadly, Pearce is probably the least interesting villain in the franchise.

Now - here's the good, the bad, and the ugly.  First and foremost, Iron Man III is a comic book lover's delight.  If you were a fan of the Extremis storyline in the comics, you'll absolutely adore what these filmmakers have done with this movie adaption.  The bad news is for the film lovers of The Avengers.  If you thought Iron Man III would be full of cameos from Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Evans, or Chris Hemsworth - you'll be very disappointed.  Without specifically spoiling anything, you will get to see at least one member of The Avengers (briefly) make an appearance.  And, the ugly has to begin with an apology.  Sorry, kids - there's no Ant-Man debut, no reference to the next Thor film, and definitely nothing to do with the mysterious Guardians of the Galaxy.  This film is completely centered on Tony Stark and the rest of the Iron Man characters.

Generally speaking, the plot isn't all that it's been talked up to be.  Yes, the film is full of action, and this particular sequel is Tony Stark's version of The Empire Strikes Back.  He gets an ass-kicking in this film that just keeps on giving.  However, for anyone to even compare The Avengers to Iron Man III is completely and utterly delusional about the quality and scale of these two comic book films.  For the average movie-goer, Iron Man III is on par with its predecessors, but the first Iron Man film is still the best in this trilogy.  Iron Man II has the best villains, Iron Man has the best plot, and Iron Man III is just a combination of the first two films.  Disapprovingly, the landscape of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is relatively unchanged after this film, meaning - in the grand scheme of things - Iron Man III is a bit of a letdown.  There's not much of cliffhanger and nothing overly exciting going on to lead into the next Phase II film.  Sure, it's an enjoyable, entertaining fill - but this critic can't help but want more.

Overall, Iron Man III is an average addition to the Marvel film library, but it doesn't even come close to the quality of The Avengers.  Unfortunately, the plot lacks meaningful progression for the future of the Iron Man characters (other than Pepper Potts) - yet if you're just simply looking at Iron Man III as a solo story and means of entertainment, it will be difficult to find a better action film in the summer of 2013.

5643033,4,B00BL1BJFW,"Iron Man 3 is an improvement over the last installment, so it is a bummer that it ultimately lacks a clear and memorable villain. Ben Kingsley is a great actor of course and his acting is fine here, but without giving too much away, I feel cheated by the advertisements. I will leave it at that. Robert Downey Jr. turns in his best Tony Stark performance yet. I don't like his ego in reality, but he sure was made to play this character.

The CGI is of the highest quality as expected and while most of the movie lacks action, the final act easily makes up for it. In Iron Man 3 you get more Tony Stark the man than you get Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit.

The writing is pretty good and there are some very funny lines, but it can almost get too silly at times. They also felt the need to throw out references to what happened in The Avengers film every so often. We get it.

IMAX 3-D was not really worth it. The 3-D was done after the fact and it only added so minor depth.

For the first BIG movie of 2013 it is a good start. Here is hoping that Star Trek: Into Darkness and Man of Steel bring a little more to the table.",1367539200,4,1126,4.013392857142857
5643034,5,B00BL1BJFW,"I thought that Iron Man 3 was one of the best movies of 2013. When Tony Star faces his greatest foe ever, it puts his friends in danger. When Tony is unable to use the suit, he must use his smarts to get his Iron Man suit up and running again to help save the world.

I love this one as Tony puts aside his image when his friends are in danger and has to fight without his suit at times.. He is dealing with nightmares and the fact that one of his co workers is nearly killed when an attack happened at a theater... The moral of the story is being a hero is more then the suit.. It comes from Inside you....

Robert Downey Jr gives a great performance as Tony Stark and I consider this installment THE best of the series...",1367539200,4,723,4.013888888888889

Everyone's favorite Avenger is back in his own film, and he is in no rush to get the dazzle going.  Iron Man 3 opens with an untold backstory, just not the kind you might expect, given such a statement.  After that, the movie takes the post-Avengers route, which is to say it shows one piece of the aftermath.  The impact of these preceding events is apparent in the first act, but offers little more than a character roadblock, in the long run.  Beyond that, the threat of a new villain is brought up consistently enough (through broadcasts) to warrant Tony Stark's curiosity.  The rest is left to be seen first-hand.

Iron Man 3 returns much of what was missing from the second film: delight.  The laughs and conversations can definitely get obnoxious, but even when they fall flat, there's still an odd gravitation to find towards it all.  At least, with the very potential exception of the film's key plot twist.  Spoilers will not arise, but those in charge of the script choices really jumped the shark here.  This will be an experience-destroying moment for some, especially given what is initially built up.  From there on, the plot begins to fade away as action is (finally) incorporated on a more frequent basis.

Like the laughs themselves, Iron Man 3 has tone shifts splashing left and right.  To say the film loves leaping from detrimental threats to light-hearted scoffing is definitely an understatement.  If it wasn't so brash--usually courtesy of Robert Downey Jr., you could almost pass it off as dark humor.  Whether it works or not rests entirely on the viewer's emotional flexibility.

One certainty, however, is that the cast had a fun time doing this film.  While there are some serious scenes, a lot of room is made for whimsical or play-along-with-it moments.  Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle and Ben Kingsley get a lot of the latter.  In fact, if there's anyone who gives Robert Downey Jr. a run for the suck-it-up award, it would have to be former series-director Jon Favreau, even with his brief screentime.  There really aren't any weak points in the cast, although Gwyneth Paltrow could've had more footage during the second act.

Where Iron Man 3 shines the most, unsurprisingly, is in the action sequences.  No, they aren't always plausible.  Then again, neither is half the technology Tony Stark has at his disposal, so credibility is far from top priority.  As Guy Pearce says in the movie, ""ever since that guy came down with the hammer, things haven't been the same.""  Nonetheless, this leads to some pretty impressive stuff.  The attack on Stark's mansion is as thrilling as you'd expect, while the climax almost feels like it got mixed up with The Adventures of Tintin in some spots.  But given all of the style, it's tough to complain.

The final word on Iron Man 3 is that it's a very misleading film.  Things start off quite serious before quickly turning comical.  There's nothing wrong with that in and of itself, but it isn't always for the best reasoning.  Still, everyday audience members won't have a problem rolling with what comes around, simply because it means plenty of entertainment.  Iron Man 3 is a worthy successor and inclusion to the franchise, but the first film has continued to prove a tough piece for Marvel to match.",1367539200,10,3278,4.786096256684492

First of all how could Marvel do this to Iron Man's greatest villain, the Mandarin. He is a make believe character really? The movie was created by the official Marvel studio. What were they thinking? Also the MK 42 was barely working in the movie. Don Cheadle didn't even get any Iron Patriot action in this movie. Such a disappointing movie. The only was they can do Mandarin justice is if they rebooted the franchise.",1367539200,27,435,4.64935064935065
5643037,5,B00BL1BJFW,"This is the first of the summer action films and it was not what I was expecting. It was a fast-paced action film with a reasonable sense of humor and a decent plot. As usual Robert Downey Jr, carries the film on his personality and charisma. Gwyneth Paltrow does a wonderful job in a supporting role. They even figure out something useful to do with the character of Happy Hogan. I didn't know what to expect when Ben Kingsley was cast in this thing, but they figured out the perfect role for him. Don Cheadle was also used in a very effective way. The characters all had roles to play in the overall story. None of them stayed too long and their roles in the script were exactly suited to their characters. That I think is the most impressive thing about the writing.

The film was directed by Shane ""Lethal Weapon"" Black. Its full of all his usual bits. But it seems fresh because its been a long time since he has done them and he is doing them in a different sort of context. Some moments feel very lethal weapon-ish (the gunplay, the buddy banter, the comedy) but I doubt most of the audience would notice. Black's strength is that he managed to bring out the character and human elements from the material in a way that was complementary to the action sequences.

The best part about the script is that rolls out an interesting plot with a fair bit of mystery to it and delivers something worth all the build-up. The only negative is that certain aspects of the plot are *very* 2005. Certain points being made just seem kind of dated or cliche. There were simple way that the same ground could have been covered in a more up to date way. But the film moves so fast over them that it doesn't really matter much.

Within its genre, its a really good film. Its pure action and character with excellent writing complemented by a first-rate cast. I would never have thought after what is now four films that Robert Downey Jr could be carrying this material so effectively.
