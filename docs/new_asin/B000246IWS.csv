8513444,1,B000246IWS,"This DVD has not been digitally remastered, so the sound and image quality are mediocre.  I do not recommend this particular DVD as it will not play well (i.e. all the shortcomings will be obvious) on high quality DVD equipment. The seller offers fantastic customer service though, so I was able to return the DVD.",1246752000,,314,4.709090909090909
