7909968,1,B00000IBTB,"I used to enjoy the travel by train series but this video ruined it for me.  For me, the focus was on seeing places, not seeing trains.  This video has boring places to see, and the focus is on showing the food and accommodations on the train.  They say that Australians go for three-day vacations that consist solely of sitting on a train and getting fed.  What a boring way to spend three days.  It begins promisingly by showing some cute Australian animals, but it turns into a boring ad for the train, which I wouldn't want to be stuck on for three hours, much less three days.",1152662400,7,581,4.342592592592593
