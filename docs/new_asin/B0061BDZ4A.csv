8490818,4,B0061BDZ4A,"Film is a surprise from start to finish! Almost Film Noir but a bit long for modern taste. Casting is wonderful and settings will thrill you as well , alas it's B&W ! Think of it as nascent Indiana Jones! Nah ! More like the Third Man with no zither :)

If you are a real movie buff this is worth your time. Limited action good acting marvelous senic work. The Salamanders' written philosophy  seems to have no real basis in history and why it got there is never adaquately explained . I would apprieciate any clue you might have!",1446940800,,530,4.29

8490821,4,B0061BDZ4A,"A well crafted intrigue/crime thriller film, set in the French-Arab North Africa colonial culture of Tunisia, circa 1949.
Reminds me of novels by Francis Clifford (pseudonym for Arthur Leonard Bell Thompson) and films based on his novels (e.g., ""The Naked Runner"" with Frank Sinatra).
The characterizations stand out and are believable - good guys and gal, bad guys (some are REALLY BAD), guys caught in the middle/muddle.
I like the sound track a lot - very tuneful, and also appropriate to the action and the atmosphere of the various scenes.  Melodies are like early versions of the soundtracks of spy and intrigue films from the 1960's, like ""The Ipcress File"" and ""The Deadly Affair.""",1369872000,,689,5.043859649122807
8490822,3,B0061BDZ4A,"This 1950 production seems to be a belated British attempt to make a sort of Warner Brothers noir mystery thriller from the previous decade. Trevor Howard and Herbert Lom are fine actors, of course, but the script is only average and lacks inspiration and individuality.  Long chase scenes don't help.  Rather than being a classic, as advertised, this is simply a ""B"" movie.  Not bad, just average.  Perhaps what is most unique about the film is some dreadful miscasting.  Wilfred Hyde-Whyte, who usually plays clergymen and con men (often at the same time)is assigned the Hogie Carmichael role, complete with a dangling cigarette and only the lamest attempt to pretend playing the piano. Miles Mallison, familiar as a befuddled and amusing clergyman in many comedies, is supposed to be a chief of police.  Anouk Aimee, trying her best to act, is the love interest.  Three stars at best, and not worth the money.",1368835200,2,912,4.921568627450981
