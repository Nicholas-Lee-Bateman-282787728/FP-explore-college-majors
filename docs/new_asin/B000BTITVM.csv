2441028,5,B000BTITVM,"It's Charles Bronson, so the rating should start with five stars, not one.  It has a good plot, his standard nerves of steel, and it's a good movie to get lost from reality for a bit.",1366416000,,183,4.083333333333333

2441030,2,B000BTITVM,"Cold Sweat, 1970 film

The movie starts by a harbor in France, one fishing motor boat arrives from the sea. The captain plays cards and wins. Back home he gets a phone call and hangs up. Its not for the police. Lights out, curtains drawn! [Who is Joe Moran?] There is a noise inside the house. A stranger talks to them, but doesn't say much. ""How did you find me?"" [Is this actor's voice dubbed?] There is a fight, Joe wins. But he won't call the police. Joe explains his past life in Germany to Fabienne. He was part of a criminal gang. Joe tidies up, nothing on the living room floor. They carry ""Vermont"" away. Fabienne is fussy about a clean house. On the return they find three old friends waiting. Ross asks for Joe's boat. Will he go along? Yes. On the sea there is a boat with a Turkish flag. Opium? Joe learns about his stepdaughter.

Fausto is paged at the airport. Joe sees him, then meets a courier. They go for a ride and stop at a isolated cottage. Joe can bargain with Ross now that he has a hostage. But something goes wrong! Joe wants to get a doctor for Ross. Katanga makes a decision but it is overruled. Joe leaves with Moira to get a doctor and quickly return. There is an exciting car chase on a curvy highway, then the car goes off the road! [The red car looks like new.] The situation changes back at that cottage. Katanga is now in charge. They go for a boat ride together. A flare gun adds to the celebrations. And so it ends well. ""I'm hungry.""

This was filmed in southern France at the port of Beaulieu-Sur-Mer (a fine place by the sea). The story of a gang that abducts people goes back to ""The Petrified Forest"" and similar movies from the 1930s-1940s. The cast seems chosen by a quota system. You may find it just about average.",1336089600,,1760,4.2792792792792795
2441031,3,B000BTITVM,"Have seen this movie in 70s and Bronson was a rage then. Seeing this after so many years, felt that this was dated. Didn't excite me as much, though of course have seen some scene copied in some Hindi films",1333238400,,206,4.175
2441032,1,B000BTITVM,"A very tame story line. The movie drags on and lacks direction. Only for the ""die hard"" Charles Bornson ""fanatics"".",1325030400,,115,4.8
2441033,3,B000BTITVM,"This spartan Charles Bronson crime thriller qualifies as an above-average actioneer about a tough guy who broke out of military stockade and managed to lay low for a decade.  Not only has Joe Moran assumed an alias, but he has also married and has a stepdaughter.  Moran was a sergeant in the U.S. Army who came back from the Korean war to Germany with his superior officer, Captain Ross (a mustached James Mason), but Ross could not stand the peace and got involved in the black market.  Eventually, Ross and Moran wound up in the stockade together.  Ross engineered an escape, but one of their comrades Katanga (Jean Topart) killed a German guard.  They ended up in stir for ten years while Joe made a fast getaway.  Now, Joe lives in the south of France and owns a chartered fishing boat.  Ross and company escape from prison and go after him.  They need Joe and his fishing boat to get a consignment of heroin off a ship flying the Turkish flag.  Principally, Ross and his men take Joe's wife, Fabienne Martin (Liv Ullmann) and his 11-year old stepdaughter Michle hostage to blackmail him into helping them. During a dispute the trigger-happy Katanga accidentally wounds Ross with a slug in the belly.  Ross sends Joe to fetch a doctor while he holds the greedy Katanga at gunpoint. The villains in COLD SWEAT are sleazy through and through.  Indeed, the villain create more chaos when they wind up shooting one another.  At a crucial point, Katanga cuts loose with his folding stock submachine gun and shoots his leader, Ross, in the stomach.  ""Thunderball"" director Terence Young does not let the action slow down.  Once Ross has been wounded, he sends Joe out to get him a doctor, leaving behind the wife and stepdaughter of our hero.  Bronson races into town and picks up a doctor.  On the way out of town, our hero discovers that two motorcycle cops are fast closing in on him, so he guns the car and drives like a mad man. The renowned stunt driving team headed up by Remy Julienne give us a riverting chase scene, especially when our hero and his passengers plunge off the regular highway and careen across country!  Ullmann has the best line in the movie when she shows her contempt for the former Foreign Legion soldier:  ""Killing him would not be murder, it would be like cleaning a cesspool.""  Of course, the tough but resourceful Bronson keeps surprising everybody, including two uniformed motorcycle cops.  This crisp thriller is sometimes quite brutal as when the hero snaps a villain's neck with his bare hands. The British censors made the filmmakers cut out this scene as well as some brief frontal female nudity, and the death of a villain by a flare pistol.  Terence Young never lets the action slow down and the car and motorcycle chase is pretty good.  Charles Bronson delivers a charismatic performance.",1301443200,,2829,4.7073170731707314
2441034,4,B000BTITVM,"Charles Bronson's performance is riveting.

Liv Ullmann who played his wife is okay.

The action scenes are swift and deadly.

The first 70 minutes contain some good suspense and action. Especially the scene when Charles Bronson fetched the doctor and the scene right after that, they were almost unbearable to me.

This is one of the timeless movies of Charles Bronson. The others are: Dead To Rights, Family of Cops 1, Family of Cops 3, Mr. Majestyk, Murphy's Law, Red Sun, and The Evil That Men Do.

P.S.

When I first posted this review in 2007, the DVD I bought contained poor quality of the ending scene. It was dark and blurry, very difficult to see what's going on. That's why I made a complaint my review. That's also why one of the 3 comments posted here asked me to reveal what company that made the DVD I bought. Today, June 2013, I bought another DVD from Amazon. Its video quality is very good. Especially the last scene is clear and sharp.

So, I've deleted the old complaint and updated the review accordingly.",1191110400,11,1026,4.573770491803279
2441035,4,B000BTITVM,"This is not the greatest Bronson movie ever made but it is nonetheless entertaining.  It does have one spectacular car chase or rather motorcycle pursuit on winding roads of south of France.  There are some nice perforamnces and it's fun to see James Mason play a villain although he's a likable one. Liv Ullman is fine and Jill Ireland plays a hilarious rich hippie chick.

There are the usual plot absurdities but Bronson is the reason we watch these movies and he's no different here.  He's a very likeable tough guy trying very hard to be nice around bunch of incorrigable villains.

The main concern here though is the resolution quality.  It looks like they transfered a video quality image. On a high def flat panel it looks aweful, but you can still enjoy the film.  I wish they would remaster but I guess that's why the price is cheap. If image quality and DVD presentation are important then this should really get a 2 star rating.",1169683200,4,941,4.598802395209581

2441042,4,B000BTITVM,"The quality of the print leaves something to be desired. It is 4:3, but is an early Bronson action thriller, pre-Death Wish and Mechanic. He's a family man and this sort of role was probably one he would have wanted to reprise later in his career when he bemoaned that audiences only wanted to see him perform acts of violence.
One of the surprising performances in the film is by James Mason as an American criminal scumbag with a suspect accent.
The movie has a satisfying climax and gives Bronson, the family man, the chance to settle the score with the bad guys. A good flick.",1478217600,,580,4.481132075471698

2441085,2,B000BTITVM,"Extremely dull thriller Starring Charles Bronson as an American ship's captain with a rental boat living in France with his Swedish wife and step-daughter.  His life is just peachy until some crooks from his past turn up in his living room demanding--well, it's actually hard to say for sure the plotting is so muddled.  It has something to do with a boat with a Turkish flag and a spacey hippie-chick (the inevitable Jill Ireland) with a suitcase full of money but beyond that I really couldn't say for sure.

It's hard to imagine how Cold Sweat could possibly be less suspenseful than it is.  James Mason plays one of the villains with a horrible American accent that he seems to be having fun with--but everyone else just seems bored and going through the motions for a paycheck.  There's very little in the way of plotting in Cold Sweat--just characters spinning around in circles long enough to run out the clock.  Charles Bronson made a large number of forgettable European thrillers in the late 1960's/early 1970's before becoming a Hollywood action star with movies like The Mechanic and Mr. Majestyk.  Cold Sweat is about as forgettable as it gets.",1420070400,,1157,4.813131313131313

2441089,3,B000BTITVM,"I'm a Bronson fan, however, this movie left me lukewarm.  It was made in the era when Bronson was a big hit in Europe but still little known in the US.  ""Red Sun"" and ""Rider on the Rain"" are better examples from that era.  The picture quality is almost poor.  It was made in France on a low budget.  Bronson is more affable than usual but it seems odd to see him as a respectable boat captain with a young wife and child and partying friends.  The car chase scenes got a bit long winded.
