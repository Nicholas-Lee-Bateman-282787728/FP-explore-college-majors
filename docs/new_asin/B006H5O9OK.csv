4989222,4,B006H5O9OK,"Director Antonio Isasi dips into the Euro-American Crime genre with this convoluted but stylish heist movie from the late Sixties.  Gary Lockwood plays a casino dealer who partners with secretary Elke Sommer who's boss, Lee J. Cobb, is on the take from the mob and has a secret stash of $200 million in gold bullion,and they plan to steal it from under his nose.  Meanwhile , Federal Treasury agent Jack Palance is investigating Cobb for his mob deals and then the whole plot starts cooking as everything merges into a classic heist caper.  As you can see, the film has a stellar cast and Isasi keeps things rolling along with twists and turns in its slithery plot. You'll also spot many Euro actors including Jean Servais and Gerard Tichy.  Gary Lockwood plays his role cool and collected which amounts to a twist in the proceedings, and Elke Sommer, fresh from her stint in Blake Edward's 'A SHOT IN THE DARK' is gorgeous and would make the underrated spy film 'DEADLIER THAN THE MALE' the same year.  Cobb and Palance prove the thespians that they are as they play a battle of wits throughout the films running time.  Boasting great photography by Juan Gelpi, crisp editing unfortunately the film editor is not listed in the credits, and a great sixties style music score by George Garvarentz, its a great time capsule and is an entertaining  Spanish-French-Italian-German co-production.  Available as a DVD-r from Warner Archive from a gorgeous 2.35 widescreen negative, it is now available from Amazon.com.  The price tag may be high but its worth it if you are a fan of classic heist movies.",1292025600,5,1597,4.799270072992701

4989233,4,B006H5O9OK,"Filmed in 1968 but released in 1969, ""They Came to Rob Las Vegas,"" a Spanish-French-Italian-German co-production, begins a rather standard heist melodrama, but true to that genre that was very popular during the late 1960s, it soon escalates into an action-packed, stylish adventure whose momentum becomes unrelenting. With stand-out performances by Gary Lockwood, Lee J. Cobb, E l k e S o m m e r and Jack Parlance, the plot keeps building until the surprise, unexpected ending. I liked it because I'm a fan of that genre, especially during the late 1960s. Recommended for fans of 1960s cinema. An almost-forgotten film that brings to the viewer some real surprises and plot twists.",1377648000,,683,5.053097345132743

Almost immediately, complications begin to occur, as Ferris leaves the hideout to eliminate a witness, but soon finds himself taken into custody by the sheriff.

Spanish director Antonio Isasi-Isasmendi, displays great style in handling the action scenes, many which are set in the desert, and usually have some measure of tension, although the players often can't seem to shoot straight.

Tony Ferris isn't very impressive at first, but as the action heats up, he asserts himself as a determined leader, and cold-blooded killer.  There is very little humor, in what is mostly a slick and stylish crime drama.  The idea of concealing an armored below the sand has some potential, although it isn't realized as well as it might have been, as Ferris leaving the pit with the armored car, seems to disrupt the film's momentum.

Another European co-production which turned into a 60s cult classic, starring yet another gorgeous blond namely Britt Ekland - and also John Cassavetes! Locations this time are San Francisco, Las Vegas, Manhattan and L.A.
Fortunately this B cult already has gone BLU!! Enjoy!",1318896000,5,1446,6.471502590673575
4989240,4,B006H5O9OK,"In the 1960s, as the Hollywood studio system was falling apart at the creative and financial seams, European cinema was kicking ass with auteurs like Fellini, Truffaut, Godard, Antonioni, and so on. Europe was also doing a roaring business in what would later become cult pictures: titles such as Barbarella, Danger: Diabolik, The 10th Victim, and Black Sunday all became classics of their kind. It's into this last category that They Came To Rob Las Vegas (1968) falls. Like most cult films, it's essentially a B-movie that earns the cult label through an extra degree of artistry, inventiveness, energy, and, for lack of better term, craziness.

The plot, which is far more complex than your average B-movie, has a group of thieves taking down an armoured car that ferries cash from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. But this is no ordinary armoured car; it's a Skorsky armoured car which means it's built to be invulnerable to attack. It even has remote controlled machine guns to dissuade attackers. Tony, the leader of the gang, has the edge on Skorsky because his girlfriend, Ann, is Mr Skorsky's personal (very) assistant, and can tell him the route the car is taking. The attack on the armoured car goes down without a hitch, but things quickly go pear-shaped from there, and Tony, the anti-hero of the film, has to scramble to keep the money and his life.

That's the plot in a very tiny nutshell. But what makes the film a cult classic? Let's start with the soundtrack. It was almost a regulation that all European genre films of the '60s had to have a really cool/weird musical score, and They scores high in this department. Georges Garvarentz was the composer, and when he wasn't scoring schlock like Killer Force and Sappho, he wrote the music for Charles Aznavour's songs. Georges gives the film some wonderfully brassy, bombastic music for the action scenes, and a classic piece of trippy mood music that features a female vocalist doing a lot of humming and la la la-ing.

The quality of the acting is all over the place. Pros like Lee J. Cobb and Jack Palance earn their paycheques, but no more, and Elke Sommer as Ann is, well, she looks good in a low-cut dress. It's Gary Lockwood as Tony who's the revelation here. Stanley Kubrick had already cast him as the doomed astronaut in 2001: A Space Odyssey, and you can see here why Kubrick gave him the role. Lockwood lacks leading man looks, but he certainly has leading man charisma. His character is supposed to be tough, smart and oh so very cool, and Lockwood conveys all this effortlessly. It's a bewilderment that Lockwood never got anything but TV work after this and 2001. The no-name actors who make up the rest of Tony's gang all seem to have got their training in the commedia dell'arte. Nothing is too over the top for this group of thespians. The script infers that they're all hippies, but they come across as deranged hipsters with a fondness for trilby hats.

What really makes this film work is the look of it. European directors of this period loved the chance to work with big, wide open spaces. Just look at Sergio Leone. In this case the director, Antonio Isasi, is shooting in Las Vegas and the Spanish desert (doubling for Nevada), and he clearly relishes the chance to move men and machines around in vast landscapes. The shot composition is always first rate, as is some of the location work in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The highlight of the film is the seizure of the armoured car in the desert. It's a complicated sequence involving many moving parts and it is, without a doubt, a brilliant combination of cinematography and editing. It should be shown in every film school.

Another thing that distinguishes this film is its absolute cold bloodedness. Tony is clearly the hero of the film and yet he thinks nothing of killing security guards and, in one case, an innocent bystander. This kind of nihilist attitude is common in films now, but in 1968 it was pretty shocking.

Is They Came To Rob Las Vegas a great film? No, of course not. The acting is sometimes laughable, the dialogue is clunky, and some sequences (the Las Vegas strip by night) appear to have been filmed from the back seat of a cab. What this film does have is insolence, energy, a surprisingly intricate plot, dynamic action sequences, and a fun vulgarity that makes it not just a B-movie, but a cult B-movie. If you want it, you'll have to order it online from the Warner Archive Collection.

Sad also that Amazon on there video service only allows you to buy it, and not to rent it. Have a friend who would not might paying a fee, but finds the price to buy a film he has never seen before a little much. this is a great film, a film that was unjustly neglected by the American critics back in the 60's, I think partially because it was a Spanish film, and of course Spain had a dictatorship at the time, and those critics probably didn't think any thing could could come from such a country, having  read one of the reviews at the time. Also a must for any fan of Jack Palance, he is wonderful in it.

For me also, one of the fun things about the film is that while at the beginning, one has to laugh at writers idea of American geography, he pain stakingly shows a street sign, and then a scene of Lake Merrit in Oakland, and the Kaizer building ahead, which I think he does get right.
