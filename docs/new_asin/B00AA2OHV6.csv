8548890,5,B00AA2OHV6,"I have also read George Lindsay and the Art of Timing. This was the 2011 Investment book of the year. This DVD is a quick overview of Lindsay and the concepts in the book.

The market moves in waves of emotion. Having a big picture view of typical market oscillations is worth the price of this introductory disc. The market provides us a changing picture all  the time. What Lindsay's concepts allow you to understand is where you are in the journey from a market bottom to a cycle high. Beginning investors will appreciate how the model explains different parts of the cycle. More advanced investors will find it helps take their focus off the immediate term and refocus on where you are in the big picture. One of the primary goals of Technical Analysis is the awareness of when major market drops are about to occur so you can protect your investments. This video will introduce you to understanding the lead up to those market formations. Do you know how long bull markets last? That nugget of knowledge is singularly important. How long are typical declines?

I personally find great value in Lindsay's work. Understanding how markets base, accelerate, consolidate, top and decline makes for fascinating dialogue. Most market technicians will agree how markets have moved in previous cycles can help analyze future cycles. This broad scale pattern recognition presented by Lindsay is very important. I find acceleration from market lows very, very profitable. Just when the world is bearish, the market pivots and shoots higher. Lindsay lays out classic market basing structures to alert you to times when the market will provide extreme market potential. Two of my most profitable months have been generated from understanding Lindsay's concepts.

While this video is a quick overview of the depth of Lindsays work, you will need to purchase Ed Carlson's book that lays out Lindsay's counting methodology. Should you choose to follow Lindsays methodologies closely, you will become much more aware of market cycles, recent high/low data and typical time spans for optimism and pessimism. Just when the world is turning grumpy, you will find yourself watching bases form and optimizing these moments. Conversely, just when things appear most rosy, you'll be in a position to know what to look for to help time to exit.

I invited Ed Carlson to come to our city to present these topics to an investing community. I am very aware of Lindsay's methodologies and use spreadsheets to keep track. It doesn't take much time, but it is the best unconventional method to market position. When I combine these methods with other technical setups, the power of the information is compelling.
