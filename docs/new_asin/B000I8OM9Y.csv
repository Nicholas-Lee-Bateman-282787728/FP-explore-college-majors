8144562,3,B000I8OM9Y,"Many enjoyable moments. I liked the part of the 40's & 50's cars pulling showroom restored camping trailers. And some spots of Route 66 fun spots. Other parts kind of dragged for me.
Hard to rate this one. Some parts of this video are at least a 4 and others are only a 2.
I Love old 60's muscle cars - and there is near Nothing in here about them.
I plan to keep this DVD - but I can't rave about it.",1392249600,,401,3.8433734939759034
