4484190,5,B004VRK4DG,"Before Larry the Cucumber and Bob the Tomato from the ""Veggie Tales"" videos, there was Davey, and his dog, Goliath. The stop-motion animation series was produced by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in the 1950s and 1960s to provide a Christian-based show for young viewers.

The 15-minute episodes center on Davey, a likable, polite, and hard-working kid who wonders how to apply his Christian faith and values to his everyday experiences. What made this show so approachable was its lack of good and evil dichotomies. Rather than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/sin-and-sinner-storylines/dp/0758613741/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">sin and sinner storylines</a>, these shows simply convey Davey's yearning to understand his place in God's creation. While some of the shows deal with large social issues such as bullying, racism, and death, the majority of the plotlines explore Davey's daily journey of a faith-based life with Goliath by his side, both as companion and conscience.

Uncomplicated storylines, simple set designs of familiar characters and places, a thoughtful and kind central figure whose seriousness is balanced by his goofy yet loyal dog, anchor each show. The show's messages of love and forgiveness can trace its roots all the way back to Jesus and the New Testament teachings. I remember the powerful impression these shows had on me as a child. Despite the low-tech quality when compared to today's animation, my kids are equally riveted by this series.

This review applies to all the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/other-shows/dp/B007ATHNHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">other shows</a>&nbsp;within this beautifully produced series. Highly recommend for your family.",1389312000,9,1783,6.239837398373984

4484193,5,B004VRK4DG,"I rarely got to watch Davey and Goliath growing up because it seemed to only come on TV while I was at church with my family, but now my kids can watch them anytime!  The stories are still very relevant today.",1360195200,,209,4.097560975609756

4484195,5,B004VRK4DG,Forget todays tv - put on the classics! my kids are glued watching these and can't get enough.  they learn timeless Bibical lessons that kids face and have fun doing it.  Cancel cable and get some noble shows like this.,1336608000,,219,4.45

4484197,5,B004VRK4DG,I use to watch Davey and Goliath when I was little and living in New York. I hadn't seen any of these for 30 years. I found it amazing that I remembered each and every episode just like I did when I was little. It brought back some great memories. I highly recommend this show for your kids (10 and under) or for you if you loved the show when you were little!,1325635200,12,360,3.9452054794520546
4484198,5,B004VRK4DG,"The 5 stars is for the show.  However, several of the titles in this 6-DVD set (16 of the 36) have been previously released in the last few years.  The ELCA (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America) can't seem to choose or keep a good distributor, so the Bridgestone Media Group has started over on the release of all the titles.

So, if you want the new stuff, you may have to repurchase the previously released titles.  Thank you, ELCA for the required double-dip.  Hopefully, Bridgestone will finish the job before distribution company XYZ starts over yet again.

The episodes appear to be the exact versions released around 2004 and 2005, so the quality is fine.

I paid less than $32 w/shipping.  There is quite a bit of variance in pricing out there.

Many people make fun of Davey and Goliath, but for safe, yet simple children's entertainment with an excellent message, it is hard to beat.",1311120000,22,896,4.6923076923076925
4484229,5,B004VRK4DG,"Children love these videos! They want to learn morel lessons. They want to know right from wrong.

The videos are not goody-goody. We see Davey make mistakes. He is a flawed sinner, but he is loved and forgiven. He does not always live up to the highest values, but those values exist and they give him a solid, safe foundation

These videos make a great gift because they bring joy to children and they protect children from the cultural pollution they get from modern media and society.

This DVD set is an amazing bargain. For just a small purchase, you can give a beautiful gift that will provide a lifetime of enrichment.",1420934400,,626,4.571428571428571
4484230,5,B004VRK4DG,My brother and I watched Davey and Goliath every Sunday morning way back when. Haven't seen these in over 35 years; yet the basic message each story conveys is still words to live by as an adult. Bottom line is great nostalgic fun at a bargain price.,1420588800,,250,4.340425531914893
4484231,5,B004VRK4DG,"The claymation is classic! Actually, what I loved about this series most was less the fabulous claymation and more the old lessons kids learned from playing outside. My favorite was actually the lesson about how to know when you can skate on a pond - how it takes time for ice to freeze in a larger body of water. How many kids learn that these days? And it is absolutely adorable, calm, and non-flashy like most modern kiddie stuff.",1419638400,,433,4.493670886075949

Now that I am in my 60's, I was reminiscing about the series. I bought and have enjoyed each episode and the biblical truths apply today just as then.

Highly recommend this for all ages.",1409616000,,348,4.4375

8443901,5,B004VRK4DG,"These movies are just perfect for ages 3-7. Especially for kids not used to video games and lots of TV. They have a slow natural pace, no loud constant noises, and are moral and interesting. Many of the stories interest boys more so. These are actually good for children and do not ruin their attention spans like other hyped up programs. I cant recommend them more!",1463097600,,366,4.5606060606060606
