Some of the takes may have been redone a thousand times to get the results he wanted for the video because the video is edited and stops immediately after a sentence and picks right back up again on the next screen.  Not sure if I would always bet this way, but it is definately instructional on Craps.",1362960000,,384,4.319444444444445
8055013,5,B00080HHO4,"I noticed what the first reviewer said about this DVD and I can understand where he's coming from. Before watching this DVD it's helpful if you've played craps before. JP talks fast and you have to pay attention but what he says makes perfect sense and that's what the DVD is about. I play in a casino about 4 times a year and I watch this DVD before every trip. Each time I've watched it it makes more sense. Use the pause button to write down what he says about how the beginner should bet. I know how all the bets work but without a sound strategy (which he teaches), I've gotten killed at a craps table before and sometimes won a lot with dumb luck. This DVD shows the proper strategy a beginner or even a novice (like me) should use to play smart so that you give yourself a better chance of walking away a winner and/or cutting your losses.",1326240000,,846,4.228395061728395
