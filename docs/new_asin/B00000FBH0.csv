Otherwise, it is wonderful to be able to have on VHS tape some truly great moments in opera history.  Thank you.",1461110400,,249,4.488888888888889
7908107,5,B00000FBH0,"The best thing about this video is that you don't have to sit through all the jugglers, ventriloquists, etc., to get to the 'good stuff' on the Ed Suillivan Show.  Through the years these 'clips' were taken from (50's to the 70's) styles changed but that doesn't make much difference.  Few of the performances are what you would call 'primo' but they are pleasant enough reminders of some great singers from that era ... many of whom are scarce on video.  Enjoy!",1360540800,,462,4.609756097560975
7908108,5,B00000FBH0,"this was wonderful to have..some of the greatest operatic voices from the past.
We will perhaps never see or hear again the performances of Maria Callas in Tosca
or other performers in this video.  Truly a music lovers collectible to treasure
and keep.",1304726400,,252,4.8604651162790695
