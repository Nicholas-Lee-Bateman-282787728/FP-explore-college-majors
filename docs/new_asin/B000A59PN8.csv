2360269,5,B000A59PN8,"This DVD wastes no hype, describing USC football as a religious experience. In describing Pete Carroll's hiring, narrator Roger Springfield says that USC was ""delivered"" from a wilderness period by ""the Second Coming of McKay,"" Pete Carroll.

It has good featrures, like interviews with Marcus Allen and Craig Fertig, and reveals a death threat against Coach McKay in 1975, but as much fun as it is for Trojan alums, I recommend TROJAN VIDEO GOLD, narrated by Tom Kelly for SC's 100th anniversary in 1988. Kelly is the true voice of SC!

That one was just a little more true to the old days, in my view, but this is still great stuff!

Fight On!

2360270,3,B000A59PN8,"As an alum I couldn't wait to get this video as soon as it came out.  It was entertaining as an overview of the history of 'SC football, but left me hungry for more.  Especially more highlights of Marcus Allen, OJ, and the other Heisman winners.  Also, some more dwell time on the greatest games vs Notre Dame, UCLA, and the Rose Bowls.  Wish it had been a 2-disc set more along the lines of the NFL Films history series now out.",1135641600,2,429,4.195121951219512

8074556,5,B000A59PN8,"This video was produced after the 2005 season; just prior to the infamous 2006 fiasco.  At the time, USC was delirious in that it was deep in the Pete Carroll era, so Carroll sees quite a bit of air time in this video.  I've been a USC fan since 1972 and I love the history of its football program as told in the video.  Very comprehensive and well told.  I found the interviews with Reggie Bush and Pete Carroll to be sad and pathetic in light of what both of them did to SC's program in and after the 2006 season.  But other than that, a great recap of the USC football legacy.",1479340800,,579,4.088495575221239
