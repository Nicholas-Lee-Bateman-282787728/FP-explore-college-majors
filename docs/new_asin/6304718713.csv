915954,2,6304718713,"The graininess of the 16mm film detracts from the smooth, soothing atmosphere attempted by the producers.  With high resolution viewing, the imperfections and age of the orginal equipment are substantially  irritating.  Cheaply priced, but I wished I had saved for 50% of Starship  Troopers.  I received good reviews on Earthlight, and will try that...a  reluctant thumbs down on Desert Vision.",934588800,3,394,5.483333333333333

7876317,4,6304718713,"Video works well  for background during exercise routine, the soundtrack is a good match for this purpose.",1454025600,,106,5.235294117647059
7876318,5,6304718713,I really like this video.  I wish that David Lanz would make another video every bit as good as this one.  Very relaxing!,1436659200,,121,4.217391304347826
7876319,5,6304718713,"I moved to the Southwest US after seeing this the first time, and it still moves me.  Wonderful landscapes, fine filming, great musics.  An inspiration.",1388880000,,152,5.04
7876320,5,6304718713,A wonderful video with natural states music. Designed to open the mind and take you to serene places.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!,1380672000,,125,4.9523809523809526
7876321,5,6304718713,"I purchased the Dessert Vision music cassette around 1990-1991 and loved it! Several years later I found the Video in VH. Now I have it in DVD. This has been viewed by family and friends over and over again. I am very happy with the quality of the DVD, thank you. A must see on the new flat screen TV,s. This is a film for the very young to the seriously elderly. The scenery is a perfect match to the music!",1379203200,,408,4.049382716049383
7876322,3,6304718713,"This is a poor copy of the original VHS tape that I have of ""DESERT VISION"" for many years. I loved the music, content and beauty of the origional and was looking forward to seeing a crystal clear version of it on a DVD and didn't get it. I now wish that I still had a VHS player so I can enjoy it again.",1373500800,,304,3.765625
7876323,4,6304718713,"I have this in VHS, so it was time to up grade. I wish it had a sharper picture,(16mm film) but the music matched with breath-taking landscapes combines to make a very enjoyable video adventure.",1296259200,,194,4.571428571428571
7876324,5,6304718713,"From my travels of 2/3rds of United states and a 1/3 of Canada, I believe the source material provides abundance in variety that brings in me a sense of playful delight owing to the creative synchronization of music and video of landscapes.

I had the opportunity to view this video, thanks to Georgetown Public Library, Georgetown TX. It is unfortunate that buying this video is a challenge.",1214697600,,392,4.850746268656716
7876325,5,6304718713,Perhaps the film quality is older but if I were to speak negatively of this video simply because of age then I might as well say bad things about every other older video. The new age music blends perfectly with the  scenery of the desert and makes me want to travel to the southwest every  time I view it.,948672000,10,305,4.1525423728813555
