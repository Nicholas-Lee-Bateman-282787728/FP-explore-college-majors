8052086,1,B0007V2852,"This is what I wrote about Volume 1.

""It has a few people talking about their experience of moving to Spain from the U.K./Ireland. That's it. Very overpriced.""

There is nothing different here in Volume 2.  Both DVDs are short - less than one hour.  They don't offer any real information except for short interviews with people who don't say much except they are glad they moved.  Both of these could have easily fit onto one DVD.  They are geared towards Brits.  A waste of time and money.  Don't buy it.",1169251200,,506,4.483516483516484
