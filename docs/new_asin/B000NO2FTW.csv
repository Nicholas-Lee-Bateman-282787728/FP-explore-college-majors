8179688,5,B000NO2FTW,"...and the only slamming done was by NCSU!  Great video of one of
the greatest games in sports.  It was especially nice to not have to sit
through commercials and time-outs.  Thanks for the wonderful
documentation of the 1983 NCAA basketball championship game.  I
do wish there had been a bit more coverage of the after game
celebration and awards ceremony.",1366675200,,357,4.80327868852459
