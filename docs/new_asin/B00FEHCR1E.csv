5980568,5,B00FEHCR1E,I have been doing Barr workouts for 2 years and when I found this one I thought I would give it a try.  Sadie Lincoln does a good job demonstrating and explaining the moves.  This is an excellent workout!  Some moves are the same as what I am used to. But most were done in a different way and had me using muscles differently and WOW!  Not for a beginner.  I would highly recommend this to those that are ready to feel those muscles working.  And to feel the same muscles the next morning!,1389744000,,490,4.159574468085107
5980569,5,B00FEHCR1E,"If you don't have a lot of time but you want to work out-  this is the dvd for you!
It's really fun to do, Sadie is extremely accessible and friendly. Liked doing this one. It keeps me in the loop longer than most",1388880000,,213,3.840909090909091
5980570,5,B00FEHCR1E,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; please see that site for a more detailed version of my review.

This DVD features Sadie Lincoln, founder of the barre3 method and studios.  Like most of the other videos in the Element series, Barre Conditioning offers two separate routines, both of which use a high-backed chair in place of a traditional ballet barre.  Lincoln also recommends use of a mat for both routines, and for the second practice, which includes core work on the floor, she uses a rolled-up towel.  Lincoln practices barefoot and teaches via voiceover, providing mirrored cueing.  I have described each routine in greater detail below.

BURN & FIRM (33:42 minutes)
This high-energy standing routine begins with a warm-up of side-to-side lunges in horse stance; Lincoln layers on an arm to the side/overhead and then a side leg lift.  Next, she moves to the chair for pli work for the side body.  [Note:  the moves are performed all on one side first before moving to the second side.]  Lincoln starts slow, again picking up the pace with side leg lifts.  Coming back to horse stance, she performs pli pulses, moving only an inch at a time, first with the feet flat, then on the toes.  Additional moves including standing diamond (on one leg, bending/straightening both legs) and narrow athletic ""v"", again moving just an inch at a time.  She finishes on the first side with single squats, first starting with a pulsing squat, then a full squat.  Lincoln repeats the entire series through standing diamond on the second side, concluding this time with power leg (small pulses) and chair pose (pulsing then full).  For the 5.5 minute stretch, Lincoln faces the chair for a quad stretch and crescent pose.  She also performs a standing forward fold, bending each knee in turn to get in an extra hip stretch; she then returns to standing and takes deep breaths to finish.

LENGTHEN & STRENGTHEN (32:36 minutes)
[Note:  during the Introduction, this routine is incorrectly labeled onscreen as ""Lengthen & Straighten""; it does not appear that way on the menu.]  The warm-up for this workout begins more slowly, with side-to-side taps that turn into hamstring curls and knee raises.  The standing work starts facing the chair for crescent lunge.  Lincoln performs small lowers (one inch) for this position and then larger raises.  She also concentrates the weight on the front leg to work the glutes.  (For these moves, Lincoln alternates legs.)  After this short standing sequence, Lincoln moves to all fours, slowing bringing in an alternate arm and knee and then performing a straight leg pulse.  Next, she transitions to her side for side-lying diamond on either side (with a seated twist in-between) followed by bridge lifts.  For the core work, the rolled-up towel supports the pelvis.  The moves here include pass leg lowers, point/flex presses, and fourth position scoops.  Lincoln then returns to all fours for a cat/cow stretch and a final move, plank, adding in a micro bend of the knees (and optional elbow bends).  Again, there is a nice long (5.5 minutes) stretch which includes child pose, seated shoulder/side stretches, twist, modified camel, and standing forward fold.

Although these workouts focus on small, precise movements, they challenge the muscles in unique ways and thus are definitely likely to bring about significant results.  I found the second routine, ""Burn & Firm,"" to be a bit easier; for those who are familiar with Lincoln's ""barre3: Total Body Lift"" DVD released several years back, this was similar, except without the arms work and with the towel replacing the squishy ball.  I loved the first workout on this DVD, which I thought was solidly intermediate and which did an amazing job at targeting the legs from all angles.  (I found it odd, however, that Lincoln repeatedly mentions the ""amazing upper body work"" in this routine:  although the arms are used, they simply are not worked all that hard.)  Lincoln is an enjoyable, encouraging instructor, and I would definitely recommend Element: Barre Conditioning for its challenging yet accessible workouts.",1384819200,71,4166,5.021865889212828
5980571,5,B00FEHCR1E,"Since I love doing yoga and pilates this is the perfect workout for me.  I don't have to choose one or the other.  I also like that it works my entire body to help with physical awareness and posture.  My posture is something I have been trying to improve, anything that gives me help along the way is much appreciated.  I almost forgot to say... this is Low Impact.  Since I have had a complete hip replacement, this is perfect.",1384387200,23,429,4.3125
5980592,5,B00FEHCR1E,This was such a great purchase.  I like the short but effective and efficient 30-minute workout it offers.  I also like that you only need a chair and/or mat for it.  But be prepare to sweat!,1504310400,2,191,4.25

5980600,5,B00FEHCR1E,Great workout! Not too hard if you're a beginner but will still leave you soar. Recommend!!,1493769600,,91,4.75
5980601,5,B00FEHCR1E,"I am an over 50 exercise shunner in middle-age fair shape.  This workout is difficult, but doable even for me, not hard on the joints.  As I get more familiar with it, I've been able to concentrate on really isolating and working the muscles.  I think it will still be challenging months down the road.
This workout is great for the following reasons:
you do it barefooted
all you need is a mat/towel and a chair
peaceful, mellow music
set on a grassy cliff with the Pacific Ocean in the background
the trainer doesn't yak too much
slow, purposeful movement
lasts 30 minutes",1492992000,28,574,4.553398058252427

5980615,5,B00FEHCR1E,Bought this to work out with my daughter- who used to do ballet. This workout is great. The tiny movements don't look difficult- but boy do you feel it- especially the next day!!,1487376000,3,178,4.424242424242424
5980616,5,B00FEHCR1E,"I love this video. I like to workout at home on my own time and I really love Barre classes. This video is wonderful.  I can feel it work and I like that there are two classes that are 30 minutes, so I can do one or both.  I can already tell a difference.  Best part is the music is good.",1484784000,5,288,3.6885245901639343
5980617,4,B00FEHCR1E,I used to be a division 1 rower and in amazing shape....I am now 25 and haven't worked out the way I used to in a couple years.

5980620,5,B00FEHCR1E,"I have a bad back (pinched nerves in my spine) and every workout I've done gives me back pain so bad I can't walk the next day.  I decided to try barre because I did ballet and danced for 15 years, and I am now a dance teacher so it looked fun to me.  This was a great workout.  It was low impact, and doesn't look hard, but at the end of the workout I was sweating and could feel it in my muscles.  The best part was my back didn't hurt at all while I was doing it or the the next day.  The time went by fast and enjoyed the workout.  I highly recommend this video, especially if you have back problems, or enjoy ballet.",1483315200,6,621,3.8503937007874014

5980645,5,B00FEHCR1E,"Oh man, do I love this DVD. I usually do my workouts in the morning before work. At 4:15, I don't have a lot of energy. I don't want to do burpees and high knees that early in the morning. But I want a good strength workout. This almost feels relaxing at first. It is very small movements that don't seem like much. It becomes obvious quickly how intense it is. It burns so bad in a good way. And without a doubt, by heart rate gets way up there. So even though this is not a 'cardio' workout, it certainly is for me!",1474848000,15,517,3.980769230769231

movements were tough. I always thought deeper squats were tougher. Wrong! My legs did the ""shakes,"" and by the end I was sweating, like I had done a cardio dvd. This is going to be a great lower body tone/sculpt. I highly recommend.",1464652800,9,508,4.1938775510204085

I ordered this one and it kicks my butt everytime! I workout regularly (Crossfit, Insanity, Nike Training, yoga) and i couldn't be happier with this.

5980676,5,B00FEHCR1E,"I pride myself if being in great shape. Ran track all through college, coach currently and enjoy intense kettle bell workouts. However, due to current health conditions, it's was recommended that I change my exercise routines...Barre was mentioned.

This workout is tough, challenging and it pushed me. Within 10 minutes my legs were burning from lactic acid build up and I was beginning to perspire. I completed both workouts, but at times almost had to take a break which surprised me.  I rented the video on my TV but will be purchasing for continued use.

I'm excited to have found this workout. Can't wait to see where this regiment will take me physically!",1459641600,14,662,4.84070796460177
5980677,5,B00FEHCR1E,I love barre 3- and joined Sadie Lincoln's website as well as the studio.  The video was shipped fast and the workout is one I still do.,1459555200,3,136,4.037037037037037

5980680,4,B00FEHCR1E,Not too hard for a beginner but makes you sweat. I have only tried the first session but I will probably buy this to own.  She's doing a voiceover but it's not annoying like some of the other workouts I've tried.,1458172800,,212,4.170731707317073
5980681,3,B00FEHCR1E,"Good video if you want to focus on the big leg and butt muscles without having to do crazy amounts of lunges and squats (there are some, but they tend to be smaller and more controlled).

She says it tones deep into the muscle, but I did not feel that. I was actually surprised that I could feel the layer of muscle right on top, all the way around the leg, but nothing down deep. I have been doing Mary Helen Bowers' workouts that really do get down deep into those muscles, and there was definitely a difference. I was also surprised at how tight my muscles felt afterward. After the first section, just standing up straight felt like I was constantly stretching rubber bands in my legs, and that their ""relaxed"" state would have been slightly bent, into a squat. My calves were also worked way more than I prefer. I get the feeling my legs would get bigger, not smaller if I did this workout consistently.

I can see myself using this on occasion, just to mix things up and make sure those muscles get some attention, but it's not really a video that I'd get excited about doing. I'd actually prefer to return it, if that were possible. I enjoyed some of the exercises, but a few were still a little hard on my knees and I did not like the tightness in my muscles after the video. I'm sure I could have done some more stretches, but I feel like a workout video should include enough to get you reasonably loose again after the workout.

I do want to mention that I did like the pace! She is very good at taking things slowly and getting you into the proper position, which is great, but I could see this being a bit slow for some people. It's a nice, relaxed workout for those days that you don't feel like beating yourself up!",1458172800,16,1730,4.300613496932515
5980692,4,B00FEHCR1E,"so far so good!  I like the instruction, it is very clear and helpful.  The workout isn't crazy hard - definitely doable although I can't do the full number of reps so it gives me something to work up to.  I like that it is only 30 minutes.  Very workable into my morning routine.  It is all leg, butt & ab work, no arm work other than a few accompanying arm movements.  I haven't been doing the workout long enough to see results so might up it to 5 starts in time - TBD.",1455580800,5,472,3.9680851063829787
5980693,5,B00FEHCR1E,"This is the perfect exercise routine for when you just don't feel like punching, jumping, or kicking. It's no/low impact and you don't move around a ton. There is a lot of ""holding"" of the positions and tiny movements within the holds. This feels like such an elegant workout, and I love it. You will be challenged! There are a few Yoga concepts and exercises included (for example, a seated twist during the cool down).

I love the instructor! She is extremely encouraging and pleasant on the eyes, and she lovingly guides you the entire time. She teaches alone with a beautiful ocean in the background.

Some people may find her flowery movement descriptions a little pretentious, but I don't. I'm just thinking of my friend, who criticizes many Yoga instructors in Portland for this same reason.",1455321600,7,798,4.817518248175182

5980699,4,B00FEHCR1E,"In the last few months I've been doing a lot of barre workouts.  I bought a bundle of DVD's from Barre 3 featuring Sadie Lincoln and I really like her as an instructor.

There are two workouts filmed in a gorgeous outdoor setting.  Burn & Firm is a lot more challenging than Lengthen & Strengthen.  I was sweating up a storm and my legs were shaking durning B & F, whereas L & S was much more gentle.

Compared to the Barre 3 workouts that I've done, these have almost no upper body work and I missed that element.  Also, the instructions are done via voiceover, in the B 3 workouts they have microphones.  I don't like the voiceover as much.

I had a ballet barre built especially for this group I exercise with, hoping I could find a ballet-oriented DVD out there to use for the usual plies in all positions, rend de jambes, releves, battmas, stretching on the barre, etc.). This DVD doesn't really fill that square at all. HOWEVER! It is still a great workout to build a ballet body - and get an aging one back into shape!",1433462400,4,784,4.097402597402597

5980761,5,B00FEHCR1E,"I actually rented this DVD through Amazon Instant Video to see if I would be interested in this whole ""barre"" workout phenomenon. I casually pressed play and started following Sadie along in the standing workout. I think I was 5 minutes in when I started yelling at my laptop because my legs, which before this moment I had always regarded as quite strong, were shaking uncontrollably and I could barely follow along. But, I placed my imaginary pointe shoes and big girl leotard on and continued the workout, all the while trying to emulate Sadie's grace. By the end of the workout, my legs were aching in places I never knew existed (and I run/bike/hike/workout frequently).

Needless to say, I am purchasing this DVD. I was also delighted to discover that Sadie is from Portland, so many Barre3 classes are offered all over Oregon so I can attend some classes in person. If you are like I used to be (hesitant about trying this form of exercise), I highly recommend that you try it! There is no doubt in my mind that completing these exercises will make me a better runner and overall human being. And, really, if I can pirouette my way around the house a little more like Misty Copeland, I'm in.",1424822400,16,1198,4.598130841121495

Before my third child I was very fit but after a hard pregnancy with little exercise I found myself out of shape and flabby.

Highly recommend to all the other moms out there just getting started back into a fitness routine looking for a low impact/beginner level workout to strength legs and core.,1422316800,14,468,4.583333333333333

The background music and scenery enhance without distracting and the filming allows the viewer to see the entire movement and understand the finer points of the isolated and smaller ranges of motion. I'm very happy to go through the sections and feel as though Sadie Lincoln knows both her anatomy and how to effectively work the entire body.

5980810,5,B00FEHCR1E,"I love this video. I've done the ""Lengthening and Strengthening"" workout 2-3 times a week now, for about a month or two, combined with 30 min treadmill. That workout is not about burning large amounts of calories. The exercises are small movements, but they are definitely working the muscles you never knew you had. The exercises are low impact and worked well for my recovering back. I haven't tried the other workout yet, as it appears to be more challenging and I'm not ready for that yet. I love Sadie's voice-over cues, as they are perfectly timed and not annoying to hear on a repetitive basis.",1402790400,3,601,4.679245283018868
5980821,3,B00FEHCR1E,"I bought this because my local gym only offers one barre class a week and I wanted something to supplement it with.  I watched the previews and read the reviews but I'm a little disappointed.  Yes, my legs did get the shakes (which was great!)  and the small movements are very effective but I was turned off by the instructor.  It wasn't her presentation as she obviously knows what she's doing and was effective with her cueing.  I don't know why but the constant chatter bothered me, especially with the repeated ""oh no, the dreaded inch!"" comments.  She seemed pleasant and the surroundings were beautiful but within ten minutes I was annoyed that she talked so much.  I realize and appreciate that she emphasized form but after one or two views that was enough instruction.

That said, this is a solid barre routine for a beginner.  The class I take is absolutely brutal so I suppose anything else couldn't begin to compare.

As other reviewers noted this is not the best arms workout but I know barre isn't known for focusing on the arms (unless you Ballet Body: Upper Body, which is a killer).  I do think that I'll use this again on days when I'm sore or tired but the voice-over drives me nuts.  The creator of Ballet Body also uses voice-over but it's minimal.  I recommend the DVD but beware of its claim that it works your entire body and contains cardio.  It definitely does a number on the legs but that's about it.",1401235200,15,1429,4.53125
5980822,4,B00FEHCR1E,"This is really good video. I like the instructor and the minimal equipment required. Don't let the tranquil scene and beginning fool you - it is a really intense workout, though low impact. A great addition to any workout DVD library.",1400716800,,234,4.7317073170731705
5980823,2,B00FEHCR1E,"So, I love to exercise and for strength workouts I like to use weights and really work on muscle toning. I thought this would be a nice complement to my regimen to provide more ""lengthening"" movements and keep me lean. However, there are a lot of small repetitive ballet-like moves that don't really challenge me and some moves are not as easy on the knees as I thought this program would be. It was also just to repetitive for me, and I quickly became bored. I was also off-put that it was filmed using the voice-over technique, the instructor's voice was just super annoying and fake.

On the positive side, it was filmed in a beautiful location and has pretty scenery. However, I much prefer the New York City Ballet's workout. It is more varied, and I feel like I'm actually working out.",1400112000,13,791,4.531468531468532
5980824,5,B00FEHCR1E,"I'm into Barre workouts and think I'm probably close to having them all (Bar Method, Pop Physique, Pure Barre, Signature Sculpt, Boston Barre, Booty Barre, Tracy Effinger's ""Squeezed"", Rocking Models, Cathe's Barre DVD, etc. etc.). I'm always looking for a new DVD to throw into the mix for variety and to stave off boredom and work the muscles a little differently.  I'd never tried any of Sadie's, so was pleased that although there is a lot of the same stuff, she still has her own approach which made things fresher for me. It has a serene background, good voiceover coaching, has sets of just the right length so you can make it as challenging as you want by  ""taking it to the edge"" knowing the sets are finite. I really enjoyed it, will return to it as part of my rotation and recommend it for others.",1399680000,,808,4.527397260273973
5980825,5,B00FEHCR1E,"I've run through this video now a handful of times, and have to say, it's great. I'm not in bad shape...I backpack for days in high elevation, ride my bike and do circuit training. Yet still, this video busts my butt, literally. I still haven't been able to make it through the entire thing without taking breaks or skipping parts and moving on to just finishing the other side of my body to work both sides.

But the background of the video...a beautiful landscaped yard bursting with flowers with a blue sky and the ocean behind, and her calming and encouraging voice, make you want to stick through the video. Unlike other high energy butt/leg workouts that I do, to loud high energy music or at the gym, when you do this one you feel like you're in a yoga class.

Some of the exercises, you're barely moving AT ALL, but holding squating postures while she says, ""OK, the dreaded inch!"". Meaning, in that squat posture, now just move up and down the tiniest fraction of movement. Then, your legs start shaking and you're in pain and you want to stop but her calm, encouraging voice comes on and says something like, ""that shaking means that your body is changing"". And suddenly you have the energy to just do it for a few more seconds before collapsing. :-)

Overall, a great video.",1398211200,6,1285,4.530172413793103

5980827,5,B00FEHCR1E,"This workout is tough and I really like the instructor - she talks you through the workout.  You just need a waist high chair and a rolled up towel ~ there are ""2"" 30 minute workouts - one standing the other on the floor.  You work so deep in to your muscles that your legs start to shake and just when you think you can't do it anymore Sadie will say just 2 more and your done.  REALLY GOOD Workout.",1396569600,2,400,3.975
5980828,5,B00FEHCR1E,"I will admit that I was the ultimate couch potato before coming across this DVD. It has changed my life for the better. I have medical issues with my legs so a high impact workout was out. I also have not exercised in a really long time so there was no way I was going to be able to do anything where you have to bend like a pretzel. The Element: Barre Conditioning has simple enough movements that are very low impact and that have very small movements but provide a very effective workout. It is very safe and enjoyable. There are two workouts 1)Burn and Firm and 2)Lengthen and Strengthen. The first one involves more standing work that gets the heart rate up and tones your body. The second one which, is harder for me is the floor work (on a mat) for toning up the core with small but intense movements. I never knew that such small movements would leave me sore the next day. ""Just one inch.""

This has helped me because without any expensive equipment other than a chair and a mat, the workouts have increased my agility and I can feel that I have worked out the muscles. I have seen an improvement in my legs and I feel better.  I can choose which style workout I want to do and they are short workouts. The first one is 34 minutes and the second workout is 32 minutes.

Sadie Lincoln has done the voice separate from the workout so it makes it more enjoyable. The scenery is beautiful. It gives you a workout that is incredible without having to jump around or buy expensive equipment. It is great for the beginner and yet, I feel can help to keep in shape the more experienced exercise buff.  It is a DVD I plan on using for a long time.",1395878400,2,1647,4.252396166134186

I am, with no doubt, a huge fan of barre workouts.  They lift your heart rate and your bum, and all with minimal hair damage.  That they can typically be done in a small space is a bonus.

5980836,5,B00FEHCR1E,"If you were expecting basic ballet movements, there are other great DVDs to look for. This program is more about stretching, lengthening, toning & body awareness using smaller movements, in standing with or without a chair for balance, and some floor work on the second workout.
The outdoor setting is beautiful with water in the background. The music is basic jazz that somewhat melts in the background, but has a good upbeat tempo that goes well with Sadie Lincoln's voice over to keep you going, not make you bored. The production, sound/lighting is high quality and professional. Sadie Lincoln has a very pleasant, encouraging voice without being overly perky & even mentions once in a while that some moves can be difficult.

Burn & Firm - 34 minutes
All standing movements with some semi-fast back/forth leg movements to warm up at first, then toning of a lot of quadriceps with squats, hamstring & standing balances. You're mostly working just the legs, but the core & some arm movements are incorporated to get a full body workout & lengthen everything. For those with balance issues, Sadie shows modifications, but know this program is based on squats, and one legged balancing & body awareness.

Lengthen & Strengthen - 33 minutes
This has some easier toning of the legs, but goes right into hands/knees, then side laying floor work with some additional twist sitting & side stretch poses. It starts with some easy standing back/forth leg movements, and then some easier basic standing toning/balances. You then go for the floorwork into balancing on hands/knees, the side laying leg diamond pose, very small bridge pose for a while. You use a towel under your hips for lifted leg movements, regular bridge pose, plank/slight pushups, side sitting stretches & standing forward bend to end.

These programs won't make you sweat, they are more about toning, but they are deceptively difficult, and you'll feel the muscle aches the next day, especially in your quadriceps from the Burn & Firm workout.

You can find three different clips on Youtube by: CollageVideo, TotalFitnessDVDs, AnchorBayFitness, or going to their respective websites.",1392768000,,2148,5.09375
5980837,5,B00FEHCR1E,"I won't review a workout unless I try it for at least 3 weeks unless I feel it's unsafe or unless I just can't bear doing it after a week or so. That wasn't the case with Element: Barre Conditioning with Sadie Lincoln. This was a fun workout! First of all it was set in a beautiful location - which was really nice considering so many workouts are set in bare bones studios with a fake plant somewhere in the background - boring! This is set with the Pacific Ocean in the background - which gives a zen-like feeling to the workouts because as the workouts are done you're not distracted by Sadie coaching you through the workouts; instead there's a voice which describes each movement as it's done.

There are two workouts on this DVD - Burn and Firm, and Lengthen and Strengthen. The first is cardio, but it also tones and tightens both upper and lower body and strengthens the core. While the 2nd workout sculpts and slims and gives you that long strong dancers body.

What I loved is seeing a real difference in my arms! In a mere 3 weeks I lost an inch in each and saw a dramatic difference in tone! My shoulders, back, butt, and legs look much better as well. Also, I have a very weak core from a back injury and have been meaning to work on it - well, this has made a real difference! I can feel a difference in my core and will continue to use this DVD to help tone and strengthen my body!

I highly recommend this DVD!",1392681600,266,1426,4.235294117647059
5980838,4,B00FEHCR1E,"OK...not perfectly, but I am not overwhelmed and can follow along for the most part from the first viewing on. Yes, I have miles to go before I've completely tackled this video, but I am usually so frustrated with exercise videos that I give up to early. Not so with this one. Turns out Ms. Lincoln is the originator of Barre3, an online, DVD, studio based exercise regimen that combines, ballet, yoga and Pilates. This is low impact and you don't need a barre...a sturdy chair will do nicely.",1392595200,,493,4.550561797752809
5980839,4,B00FEHCR1E,"The Element Barre workout is a low impact at-home workout that focuses on posture and conditioning. No special equipment required, just a chair to simulate the barre.

This DVD offers two programs. One is Burn and Firm, a 30-minute workout that actually provides a decent workout (breaking a little sweat) via a combination of plies, squats, arm work, thigh work, etc. When I finished, I didn't really feel any different. That said, the next day I woke up and felt it in my butt, arms (yes!) and lower legs. You don't really get how many muscles you're using while your actually doing the program.

The second program, entitled Lengthen and Strengthen, is more of a toning workout focused mostly on core, legs, and back. It also includes mat workout unlike the first program which is all standing. With this program (especially on the mat work), you will feel the burn during the workout and then again after. Good for alternating days.

This is my second Element ballet workout video and I'm completely satisfied. I'm about a month in and definitely feel changes in my body and improved posture.",1392595200,,1096,4.819148936170213

5980851,4,B00FEHCR1E,I liked how approachable this workout was - easy to get started when not intimidated! Beautiful views while doing fundamentals of dance. Even your posture will benefit from this DVD.,1392076800,,182,5.1
5980852,4,B00FEHCR1E,"Some moves will be a tad difficult for beginners, but she does offer a modification on some of the moves, so beginners and people with a little less lower body strength can start there. The instructions are very clear, but what I like most about ballet workouts is how fast the time goes. You could do both workouts (totaling over an hour) and it would only like 30 minutes.

The second workout entitled Lengthen and Strengthen feels like it does exactly that. Very pilates in style and a little less beginner friendly than the first workout on the DVD.

The first workout called Burn and Firm isn't exactly what most people will probably think it is. By ""burn"" it means your muscles will burn, not burn as in cardio intensive. Even people with a low amount of endurance won't get much of a cardio effect from this workout. But ballet conditioning workouts are not designed to give you a cardio burn. They're designed to strengthen and tone your muscles.

Overall, I found this to be as enjoyable and along the same lines as other ballet workouts. I appreciate the two shorter workouts so you have the option to do a shorter half an hour workout. My favorite ballet conditioning DVD had one 55 minute workout, so I love that I have something similar that I can do in a less amount of time.",1391990400,,1289,4.523605150214593
5980853,4,B00FEHCR1E,"I was in ballet for most of my life and realized that once I stopped taking regular classes, I started to put on weight.  Then came the challenge of finding a studio that had beginning/intermediate classes for adults (that didn't actually include 12 year olds).  On top of that, dance classes are expensive.  With all of this working against me, I decided to try to find some of my old loves in do it at home DVDs.  When I saw this available to me through Vine, I said what the heck.  There are some good parts to this video.  It does provide two different workouts of roughly 30 minutes a piece.  You do need something to act as a barre (a chair is recommended) and a mat.  If you have a smaller workout area, this may be difficult to accomplish.  You need to have enough room to lift your leg while still holding the chair.  I had to move some furniture around in order to accomplish this.  Also, the mat needs to be nearby because there isn't any time to transition.  The workout will definitely hit your buns and legs.  The second workout also hits your abs pretty well.  The upper body workout is based on traditional ballet thought, you get the workout because you need to keep your posture and your arms in certain positions.  Maintain the grace and focus only on moving the bottom part of your body.  While this does not build muscles within the arms, it will make them work against gravity.  If done everyday, you would probably see results, but without the added bonus of other people, I find it tedious.  Overall, I think this is a good restart video to get back into the dancing world if you haven't found a class to attend yet.",1391990400,,1640,4.392026578073089
5980854,4,B00FEHCR1E,"My favorite workout is the burn and firm. What I love: there is no floorwork at all, no kneeling or laying down, you really strengthen your muscles like in vinyasa yoga, and it is gentle on your joints. What I don't like: the lady references her chain of Barre 3 fitness centers about a million times, please don't turn my workout into a commercial.

To really use the chair effectively the back needs to be as high as your belly button. The only chairs at my house come up to my hip and were not easy to use for the video, but you never have to use the chair at all if you have really excellent balance. You do get a good shoulder burn from lifting your arms so much but you won't build your arm muscles at all. This doesn't bother me because I have a range of dvd's I rotate through to get all kinds of exercise each month. I do have bad knees so I changed some of the pli squats to regular squats (feet and knees forward rather than out) and had no trouble following the workout in this modified position. For whatever it's worth, my first grader loved the dvd and did the whole thing with me. It was fun.",1391990400,,1108,4.153488372093023
5980855,5,B00FEHCR1E,"There are two workouts on this video.  Burn and Firm is focused on conditioning the body through a tightly controlled isometric workout.  You won't find complex choreography work here.  You won't find ""tie yourself in a human knot"" type yoga poses.  You will find a really solid workout that leaves you feeling it the next day.  Each of the workouts automatically adjusts itself to your level as your form improves.  Lengthen and Strengthen reminds me of dance class more than yoga.  It is focused on improving both flexibility and balance.

These are good for the beginner, as well as those returning to yoga or dance.",1391990400,,619,4.828571428571428
5980856,5,B00FEHCR1E,I have been back at the gym now for a few months and wanted to start incorporating the barre classes into my workout.  The times weren't convenient and I didn't want to pay 15.00 every time so I ordered this dvd.  I have yet to be able to get all the way through it and it makes me sore in all the right places. it's almost as hard as the classes. but's that's only because it's easier to stop in my den.  I would recommend this dvd for sure.,1391990400,2,442,3.943820224719101
5980857,4,B00FEHCR1E,"This is a barre style workout that is most appropriate for beginner exercisers.  There are two workouts on this DVD and the only equipment required is a chair, mat, and a towel.  Both workouts are about 30 minutes and largely focus on the butt and legs.  The movements are gentle and easy on the joints.  Neither of these workouts would be a problem for someone with joint issues.

Both workouts use a chair to mimic a ballet barre. Both workouts take you through a standing series on the barre with ballet inspired moves. The burn and firm workout is almost entirely lower body work and is done standing.  The lengthen and strengthen workout has more core work included and more floor work included.

Cueing is done well, the scenery is beautiful, and the video is well produced.  This video would appeal to someone who likes Pilates and yoga.  You do not need a ballet background to use this nor do you need to be super coordinated.  The only thing holding me back from giving this 5 stars is the lack of any real upper body work.  The video claims to give you a balanced body which suggests a total body workout.  This is really a lower body and core workout.",1391817600,,1162,4.480952380952381
5980858,3,B00FEHCR1E,"While I found this sort of barre workout to be boring and dull, it definitely has value in it's price and appeal to those who enjoy dance or ballet on a casual level. Of course, for those who really do practice ballet or dance, this workout will seem like a beginners beginning of barely skimming the surface sort of workout. If you enjoy ballet style and workout from your youth, or wish for a simple, calm, low-impact way to tone and workout--then this might just be fore you.

I personally do better with faster workouts. I also can't do yoga very well because it seems  so  slooow... but this is a personal preference thing. As for the DVD itself, it's well made save for the menu screen which is lacking--though that is the case with most workout DVDs. The workout does offer some challenge and is sure to leave the average person burning after a bit. That said, I think this video is for those who are definitely certain they'd like a ballet-style barre workout, with low-impact, toning exercises, and are okay with a dull pace.",1391817600,4,1034,4.548387096774194
5980859,5,B00FEHCR1E,"There are two routines on this DVD: Burn & Firm and Lengthen & Strengthen. They are both unique, yet both provide a perfect balance of movements in the Bar Method. You may ask, what is the Bar Method? It is a combination of small movements, larger movements, holds, and stretching with ballet theme gracefulness in a perfect balance to help strengthen and tone. These practices also provide a little cardio and excellent stretching and lengthening of the muscles throughout the body. If you're looking for a hard-core, tough workout, this is not the DVD for you. If you're looking for an easier workout, yet still effective, this is it!

Each of the 2 routines are approximately 30 minutes in length. Sadie Lincoln provides perfect queues throughout the routines (in voice over) and also gives options for making the postures easier or difficult to challenge every fitness level. I love the music too, light, uplifting, yet not obnoxious at all. You will need a waist-high chair (or slightly taller), a mat, and towel. You do not use the chair to lean on, rather it is used to help hold your balance and in many cases you won't need the chair (for the floor exercises).

BURN AND FIRM (30 minutes)
Consists of all standing exercises. Begins with standing deep breathing and then an easy, fun warm up. For the warm up, Sadie has you stand in horse pose with legs out to the sides, lunging side to side, then adding arm movements. After a short warm up she moves into pleas (squats) with very small movements (1 inch or so), then holds, and then full squatting. She calls the small movements bar earthquakes and they are actually quite effective to tone and strengthen. Plus, its so easy and relaxing so good for your psyche too! She moves on to several other standing bar movements including standing diamond where you stand on one leg and lift the other leg, bending and extending the leg. With the assistance of the chair, you can help hold your balance, so I believe this would be a good routine for any level and age group. Another exercise is on toes with feet pointed out and heels together, again with small movements. I definitely felt this in my legs, buns, hips, and feet too! The whole routine is then repeated for a 2nd set on the other side. I love it too that Sadie added 5 minutes of stretching to the end to finish it off, then standing, breathing as it began.

LENGTHEN & STRENGTHEN
I really like this routine on days when I want floor work (usually after a tough day at the office). It provides the same type of standing warm-up as the burn and firm, but uniquely different in the movement. You start with breathing, but this time step-taps instead of lunging. Then facing the chair, Sadie begins a series of Crescent Pose (one leg forward with bend knee, and the other leg back with straight leg lunging) and a lovely backbend, then scooping movement. I love this part, it opens your spine and so relaxing, feminine, and graceful that it reminds me of some of my favorite yoga flow movements! 10 minutes into the routine, she moves onto the floor putting the chair away. She begins on all fours with movements of arms and legs, and again beautiful, therapeutic movements to flatten your tummy, then holding to build strength and endurance. Then, onto your side, laying and diamond leg lifts for gluts and abs. On to seated twists, then awesome bridge lifts (on your back). I love these lifts, just small movements, but effective for abs, hips, and buns! Then various core work inclined on your back with a towel under your hips and legs up. Inspired by ballet, I love this section too. Then back on all fours for cat/cow (crunching and bending your spine), then strengthening plank pose. Like the previous routine, there is a lovely 5 minute seated stretch, then ending like it started in standing and breathing.

This DVD reminds me of classic Gaiam videos that I have enjoyed and used frequently over the years. The setting is beautiful, the music is lovely, and the instruction and routine are fun, easy to follow, and effective! The length of the practices are perfect for after work and before starting your evening, or even as a morning wakeup routine. Not only for toning and strengthening, but also for connective tissue, muscle stretching, and balance. My balance has really improved and Im sure will continue to improve with regular practice. This is definitely on my list as one of my all-time favorite workout DVDs!",1391817600,,4445,4.687580025608194
5980860,4,B00FEHCR1E,"This DVD has contains two workouts.  It's a good low impact workout and it definitely works your muscles.  It contains moves that are similar to Pilates and Ballet which may look easy but you'll feel it the next day.  The instructions are clear and the exercises are easy to follow.  The video clearly shows the movements.  It was enjoyable to watch.  I don't know that this is something you'd want to do every day but maybe cycle it with walking or some other cardio and you shouldn't get bored.

5980873,4,B00FEHCR1E,"Element's Barre Conditioning presents two adequate thirty-minute workouts for those who employ isometric training to keep them fit.

Instructor Sadie Lincoln has a likeable personality--she smiles throughout the workout and is enough of a pro to indicate when her muscles are shaking, instantly reassuring the viewer participant that yes, indeed, this is normal and welcome.  Each session is demonstrated outdoors in a lovely setting and delivers what is expected--mellow music, calming over voice and the invitation to modify when necessary.

The sessions DO require some basic equipment even though the packaging suggests that nothing is needed.  Some viewers may not need the chair to balance, others might.  More imperative is the need of a cushioned mat to insure knee comfort.  Lincoln does employ a towel to aid in her stretches.

The first 30-minute session consists of fifteen minutes on each side of small movements that can, depending on your fitness level, be challenging.  These movements are mostly for the legs, arms only get involved when the are raised over the head or used to scoop up from a chair position.

The second 30-minute session seems more yoga-based, performed mainly on the floor, and because of this, this reviewer did not enjoy it as much as the first.

Neither session elicited much ""sweating."" Personally, I prefer to be warm before I start these types of moves--my body is looser, performs better and I am less apt to become bored.

The presentation does not employ any kind of a matrix selection so that the two programs run together for those participants who are ambitious and want to do one after the other.

Bottom line?  Barre Conditioning is a good workout that employs isometric small moves, yoga and Pilates.  Use it as a fundamental adjunct to your toning program--don't rely on it to take the place for a cardio workout. Recommended only for those who must have it.

5980874,3,B00FEHCR1E,"Barre conditioning is an adequate workout that concentrates on working your abs, buttocks and thighs. Sadie Lincoln is a capable instructor, and her methods seem to be based on ballet and Pilates workouts.  The first workout, Burn and Firm, is supposed to tone your entire body and runs 33 minutes.  The second workout, Lengthen and Strengthen, concentrates on your core and your legs to create a more lean look. This workout is 30 minutes.

I was a little disappointed in this workout.  Burn and Firm is marketed as an all over body workout.  It is not.  There is virtually no work done with your arms for this workout, except holding them over your head in a graceful pose. You merely wave your arms around a little in some ballet inspired exercises, and that is it. This workout also requires a larger space to exercise in than I  accustomed to.  If you have a larger than a 4 foot by 6 foot space to work out in, with enough room to accommodate both the chair you will need for this workout and the mat, then fantastic.  If you are like me, you had to improvise with your lack of space. I had to use my husband's coral tank to brace myself against for the barre exercises, which did not work very well (and which the coral may not have enjoyed). Also it is marketed as an aerobic workout.  I think my heart beat hard for about 10 minutes during this workout, far short of the needed aerobic time that most physicians and workout instructors recommend.

The second workout, Lengthen and Strengthen, is better because it is marketed correctly (only toning certain areas of the body).  This workout can be done in a smaller space.  It is more of a Pilates based workout.

I normally like to do workouts in the element the mind&body experience company because they are always filmed outdoors in peaceful, exotic locations that takes me far away from the small bedroom that I have to do these workouts in.  That was the big plus of this workout video.  I enjoyed Sadie Lincoln's teaching style, motivational but not too pushy.

Normally, they always include a menu option of being able to combine both workouts.  For whatever reason, this DVD does not include that option, so if you want to combine both workouts you finish one, then have to go back to the menu to do the other one.  This is an inconvenience. This DVD is also marketed clearly on the front cover as ""No equipment needed."" Did they forget that the instructor states clearly at the beginning of each segment that you will need a chair and a mat to do the workout?

So unfortunately because of the way the DVD is designed, and the misleading marketing of the workouts, I have to give this workout only three stars.",1391299200,14,2677,4.5375
5980875,4,B00FEHCR1E,"The scenery is lovely just don't let it make you think you will live that way if you faithfully perform these exercises.  That said, it is tricky to say who should purchase and try to use this tape.  Many of the exercises are isometric which are intense yet possible for most people.  There is truly no equipment necessary....have a towel to put under your behind, a chair to use in balance and a mat for when you are on the ground.  This is the tricky part.  A number of the exercises require being on the ground on your hands and knees.  If you have a knee issue or knee replacement, these are not for you.  Several others require you being able to get up and down from the mat.  If that is an issue for you, this is not for you.  Many of the exercises will help with balance and core strengthening so there is value in being able to do even some of them.  And that is the tricky part, knowing your own body and your own abilities, how much value will you get from the tape if you can only do some portion of the exercises.  If you have such limitations you might want to consider finding something that works with them.  If you have no limitations, these are excellent for balance and strength.",1390953600,,1197,4.247787610619469
5980876,4,B00FEHCR1E,"I think one of the most important things that needs to be pointed out is something that other reviewers have mentioned: though the product's description states that the routine tones your upper body, and the instructor repeatedly references how it is ""an amazing upper body workout,"" it's really not.  There's some reaching involved and periodically holding one arm or the other up for more of a balance challenge, but I wouldn't say that anything in either workout has much impact on the arms, at all, so if you're looking for a real full-body routine, you won't find it here.

What you will find is a pretty intense workout that really challenges many muscles in the lower body.  Though there are a couple of moves designed to increase the heart rate, most of the moves involve very, very small movements that are done in enough repetitions that you really start to feel it.  In fact, after a certain point, your legs will likely start to shake, which the instructor  explains is the whole point, i.e. to fatigue the larger muscles in your legs so that smaller muscle groups are also challenged.  This workout can be tough and even uncomfortable, and even though I've completed it many times at this point, I haven't found that it gets easier: each and every time I find myself drenched in sweat with all of my leg muscles burning when I'm finished.

The workout concludes with a couple of minutes of stretching, and I would recommend that you don't skip it given how taxed your muscles are upon completing the main routine.

I really liked the instructor; yes, she utilized voiceovers, but I didn't mind it, because I found her tone to be pleasant and friendly, and she frequently mentioned how certain exercises can be modified for people who have hip or knee pain, and she often gave reminders as to proper form and the like.  (Side note: speaking of knee pain, my knees are. . . not great, and though some of the moves challenged them a bit, I didn't experience actual pain.  However, there was some aching going on the next day, and that occurred for the first several times that I completed the workout, but eventually that stopped happening.)

Also, one thing that I found interesting is the impact that this has had on the heel pain that I have on my left foot.  I wasn't expecting it by any means, but I find that every single time that I complete this workout, that pain is greatly eased the next day.  I suppose that's because the feet get worked/stretched throughout the routine given that several moves require the heels to be lifted and the weight to balanced on the balls of the feet.  Whatever the cause, it's certainly a welcome side-benefit.

One additional note: the case states that a chair is ""suggested,"" but unless you have superhuman balance, I'd say it's less a suggestion and more of a requirement.

All of the above was in reference to the first workout, i.e. Burn and Firm.  I have to say that I don't enjoy the second routine - Lengthen & Strengthen - as much, primarily because I don't find it as challenging.  It begins with some more work on the legs, and that's pretty much the toughest, most intense part of the entire second workout.  Everything else may serve to lengthen the muscles, and it may focus a little more on the core than the moves in the first workout, but again, I didn't find it to be anything special or particularly taxing.

To sum up, the highlight of the DVD is the first workout: it's tough and intense, and you can feel pretty much every single muscle in your lower body being challenged and fatigued.  It's a good strengthening workout that really burns the muscles in your thighs and your backside.  You will need to supplement your workouts with some cardio, of course, but I'd definitely recommend picking this DVD up if you're in the market for really working out your lower body.",1390780800,10,3843,4.628865979381444
5980877,5,B00FEHCR1E,"I've been wanting to try a Barre class for awhile, and my gym is finally offering them.  However, I was thrilled to receive this DVD first so I could see what to expect.

I had not heard of Sadie Lincoln or her barre3 method before this, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how much of a sweat this worked up in a short amount of time.  The DVD is comprised of two workouts that are about 30 minutes each.  The first is the Burn and Firm; the second is Lengthen and Strengthen.

I always have high hopes for workout DVDs and then am usually reminded that I like classes so much more.  However, I found that this DVD held my interest.  I think that she is able to give great cues as to posture and alignment, which is really hard to do via DVD.  If you've read any of my other reviews (rants) about starting a home Yoga practice, I caution that you really need to start in a studio, so that a teacher can help you with your alignment.  If that's not possible, I think that this DVD could really help with that.

And speaking of which, I had not worked out much over the last few weeks (holidays, weather, etc.) when I did this DVD.  During the standing diamonds, my lower back cracked and cracked and cracked.

Using very small movements (an inch), you quickly fatigue your muscles, and I knew I would be feeling it the next day (and I was right.)  I also enjoyed that this workout could be done in a relatively small space with equipment that most of us have.

Highly recommend.",1390694400,,1495,4.236749116607774

I have only been using it for a couple weeks but I really like not only the subtle moves that Sadie Lincoln demonstrates but I like her personality as well.  So many workout DVDs have overly amped up presenters who get annoying very quickly, but this one doesn't.  There are two routines on this DVD - Burn and Firm which is done standing up and Lengthen and Strengthen which is done standing and on the floor.

If done correctly, they are incredibly hard.  I took a barre class at my gym once, and it was so difficult, I sprained my ankle.  I obviously needed a more mellow workout, but unfortunately, this DVD was a little too easy.

The location was great, and the instructions were clear enough.  The Burn and Firm section posed a bit of challenge, but the Lengthen and Strengthen section was a let down.  This is a pretty boring, unchallenging workout.  If you are a complete beginner, then this might work for you, but if you want more of a challenge, this probably won't cut it.  Barre workouts really are fun and hard, so if you find this too easy or too boring, don't give up on it until you try another DVD or go to a class.",1390435200,5,863,4.277777777777778
5980880,5,B00FEHCR1E,"I am more of an athletic training gal, preferring weight training or intense cardio workouts.  But, in my quest to diversify my routines, Im turning more and more to barre and ballet type workouts.

This DVD has two workouts:

Burn and Firm
Lengthen & Strengthen.

Why I enjoyed these workouts:

* Each one is about 30 minutes, so they're perfect when you're short on time or as add-on workouts.  I usually do them during my rest weeks and use them as add-ons.

* The beautiful background (California?) in a lovely garden by the ocean.

* Sadie.  She really knows her stuff, plus she is an excellent instructor.  I love how she gives the form pointers.  They seem to come at just the right time.

* Sadies calming voice.  At first, I wasn't too sure about the voice over, but Sadie has such a pleasant voice that I quickly got used to it.

* The emphasis on posture.  I sit hunched over a computer all day, so anything I can do to help me straighten up is good.

* Sadies modifications.  I have a tweaky knee and cant go very deep on any moves, but my muscles still felt really worked.

I thought that Lengthen & Strengthen was a tad more difficult than Burn and Firm.  Of course that may be because I tried Lengthen & Strengthen after another leg workout.

It does seem that Sadie is talking constantly, which can get a little annoying.  I know she wants us to be meticulous about maintaining good form, but it would have been nice to just have some quiet to focus on the moves and the gorgeous scenery.

In Lengthen & Strengthen, I didn't like putting the rolled up towel under my lower back during the core work.  This hurt my back and my legs, so I just did the exercises with a flat back.  Sadie is very good at offering modifications, so if something doesn't feel right for your body, there's always an alternative.

I view these workouts as intermediate.  Sadie is good about giving modifications, so I think an advanced beginner would also enjoy these workouts.",1390262400,,1969,4.46067415730337

I also really, really appreciate how well she explains what's going on or what  muscle group you are working. I would definitely recommend this workout DVD.",1530057600,,290,4.8
8614865,5,B00FEHCR1E,"I absolutely love this workout. I was a dancer for many years, and then stopped about 3 years ago. This gives me sore legs like dance practices used to. It isn't very difficult, you don't need to have been a dancer for this to work. But I don't feel like Im workout out with this - it feels enjoyable for me because it just reminds me so much of a successful class. I have only used the first half, but Ive done it for months and LOVE. IT. I sweat a lot, my heart monitor shows an increased heart rate into the cardio zone, very close to peak zone. Its a fantastic workout. It helped me lose a couple pounds last fall. I just started it back up. Wish more from this series were available for streaming purchase!",1526515200,,711,4.159420289855072

8614870,4,B00FEHCR1E,I've done barre classes before.  My schedule is such that I can't always make it to classes so I thought I'd keep up with videos.  I honestly thought this video was going to be easy. Well that's what I get for thinking.  The video is easy to follow and easy to practice without it.  There's not much required for the video that most people don't already have in their home. The exercises did require a bit of free space so I had to make room.  My only issue is it's split into two separate routines.  So doing the whole requires going through two different warm-ups and cool-downs.,1512432000,,581,4.383177570093458
