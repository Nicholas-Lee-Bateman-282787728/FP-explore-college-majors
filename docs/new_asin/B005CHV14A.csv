4653354,4,B005CHV14A,"I'm having a hard time justifying why I like this movie, but I do.  It's a pale imitation of other better films; yes, certainly, I can't argue that.  All the characters are `types' needed to move the story along and good for little else (except shark food).  The story is basic, very similar to others.  Not a lot of imagination went into it, that's obvious.  But, I still like it.  I've always been a fan of Robert Davi and Kristy Swanson (I even liked D.B. Sweeney in this case).  Having a fondness for certain actors helps elevate what might otherwise prove tedious.  Also, being a killer shark flick gives it an immediate pass (even when the shark is rarely seen except for its fin).  It's dopey, it's dumb, it's a visual feast of junk food proportions; I just had to have it for my shark movie collection.  I refuse to apologize for that.",1334448000,9,843,4.450980392156863
4653355,4,B005CHV14A,"SWAMP SHARK is certainly not a great movie but its refreshingly different from other recent sharkploitation films.  There's no busty marine biologist with glasses nor any ruthless executive doing genetic experiments.  And there's a slightly humorous undertone that cleverly spoofs itself.  A more mature cast elevates it above the usual mindless teen romps we've come to expect.  Kristy Swanson (the original Buffy) has a down-home peskiness and bravado that makes her charming; D.B. Sweeney brings an aw shucks macho as the wildlife investigator; Jason Rogel is the computer nerd; Richard Tanne is the smarmy boyfriend; Jeff Chase is the really big brother with a big heart; Gary Sinise's daughter Sophie is Swanson's teenage sister; and Robert Davi oozes villainy as the perverted sheriff.
The Gator Shed is a fun setting much better than the usual sterile science labs.  Yes, the shark effects are pretty lame but this is a SyFy movie, so you get what you expect.
All in all, a nice change of pace in an inundated field of killer shark movies.",1330819200,,1046,5.023121387283237
4653356,3,B005CHV14A,"The secret to good camp is a 100% serious sales effort behind a piece of entertainment which both parties (producers and audience) know is not serious at all.  No, you're not making ""Hamlet.""  But sell it like you are; just with a baaaaarely visible wink and a nod.

""The Wizard of Oz,"" for example, is awesome camp.  Judy Garland alternately skips, sings, and snivels with vigor.  Margaret Hamilton strikes an 11 out of 10 on the Cacklemeter.  Bert Lahr's tail has a mind of its own.  And the storytellers, with gleeful heedlessness, just blaze right by logical signposts such as, ""How in the world does snow wake you up from poppy sleep?"" and ""Would those Flying Monkeys' wingspans really support their body weight?""  Oz (like all fairy tales) is not meant to be logical ... just good, rollicking entertainment, sold with gut-busting effort.

Okay, so ""Swamp Shark"" is obviously not in the same league (or even solar system) as the 1939 classic.  The derivative premise and plot cliches (like the hijinx of pre-coital teens bringing on the appearance of the killer shark as surely as a plastic surgeon's shingle signals a cameo from Donatella Versace) automatically relegate this movie to the minors.  But.  What the movie does have is a kick-ass sales effort by the principals in the cast.  If they weren't having fun making this fish-sandwich of a story, at least they sure looked like they were.  So you can't help but enjoy the ride.

Everyone can and will recognize the ""Jaws"" references and outright rip-offs in this movie.  (Duh!)  But what made the movie entertaining for me, besides its being funnier than I expected, was this weird realization I got about a third of the way through that what I was actually watching was an extended Scooby Gang adventure.  Really.  Work with me here.  Kristy Swanson as Daphne ... DB Sweeney as Fred in Shaggy's body ... Richard Tanne as Shaggy in Fred's body ... Jason Rogel as Velma ... Jeff Chase as Scrappy Doo in Scooby Doo's body ... Robert Davi as just about every Scooby villain ever foiled by the dauntless gang (I kept waiting for the moment where he would arrest himself and snarl, ""I would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids!"") ... and that dune buggy contraption as the Mystery Machine.

The principal characters were strictly stock types -- plucky heroine, funny coward, bullish big guy, encyclopediahead, corrupt lawman, etc.  So, no genius strokes of characterization here.  But the characters made a well-rounded team by virtue of their opposing personality traits, and the actors hit all the right notes in playing their characters.  My favorite performances were from Robert Davi as the creep of a sheriff (good performance expected, though, since he was playing, well, Robert Davi) and newcomer Richard Tanne as the heroine's hot (and hot-tempered) coward of a bartender boyfriend.  The funnier bits in the movie were almost all Tanne, whose high level of comic delivery (including what must be one of the lengthiest pronunciations of the indefinite article ""a"" on film) was both unexpected and unusual in a killer-shark movie.  Watch for this guy.  I'm going on record as saying I think he's a terrific young actor who's headed for much bigger things than ill-fated encounters with modern-day megalodons.

As is to be expected, ""Swamp Shark"" has its share of Flying-Monkey-wingspan logic defiance.  How the shark manages to zip around gulping down the meaty goodness of so many gators and people in such a short time span (about 3000 lbs of Alligator mississippiensis and 1208 lbs of Homo sapiens, by my rough calculations), without exploding like Mr. Creosote, is a detail more or less taken for granted by people less obsessed with details than I.  Okay.  I'll overlook that one.  I understand the carnage quota of B-movie killer sharks.  But can someone explain the physics that allows an unsecured 500-lb airboat to reel in a multi-ton leviathan and not vice versa?  Or why Gary Sinise's lovely daughter flunks the all-American test by not knowing how to pronounce the football position of ""lineman""?  These are the questions that will keep you up at night if you watch this movie.

Yep, we have all seen this flick before, but it's a tasty jambalaya of rip-offs, lifting from not just the killer beast horror sub-genre but rummaging through things as far afield as Robin Hood and Shrek for its gimmick shots and lines.

""Swamp Shark"" is camp, but it's good camp.",1321488000,11,4470,4.872847682119206
4653357,3,B005CHV14A,"The Sy Fy original Swamp Shark (2011), is another in a long string of creature features from the cable network.  Like many of these films, Swamp Shark features a half-baked plot, stars a bit past their prime, passable acting, unimpressive special effects, and a not terribly realistic looking creature.  Making a few allowances for Sy Fy's lower standards, Swamp Shark is something that you can turn your brain off and enjoy without too much effort.

Somewhere down south in gator country, Rachel Bouchard (Kristy Swanson) operates a waterside eatery called ""The Gator Shed"", which for entertainment purposes, features the feeding of live gators kept in a pen.  Helping Rachel run the place are her bartender boyfriend Tyler (Richard Tanne), sister Krystal (Sophie Sinise), brother Jason (Jeff Chase), and waiter Martin (Jason Rogel).

The local law, Sheriff Watson (Robert Davi) is secretly involved in the trafficking of illegal animals.  While transporting a huge shark, the beast manages to escape into the swamp waters.  It later strikes at The Gator Shed, smashing into the gator's pen, and killing a drunk who falls into the water.  After a severed arm is found, Watson threatens to close down the restaurant, so Rachel and her crew decide to hunt down the creature, to try and save their business.  They get some unexpected help from fish and wildlife investigator Tommy Breysler (D.B. Sweeney), who is looking into the sheriff's activities.

The creature continues to strike, leaving behind bloody remains.  Banned from joining the hunt, Krystal slips away to a boat where some college kids are having a party, only to find herself threatened by the shark, and in need of rescue.  Rachel borrows the Sheriff's boat, and manages to find her sister.  The locals are having a celebration called ""The Gatorfest"", and in what is perhaps a questionable move, Rachel leads the shark over to the gathering, where it has a quick bite to eat, before coming ashore one final time.

Now 43, Kristy Swanson has put on a little weight since appearing in the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992).  Her character Rachel is tough, handles a gun pretty well, has a sister that is half her age, a young boyfriend with a hair-trigger temper, and is being romantically pursued by the 60 year-old sheriff.  Jason Rogel seems like a pretty funny guy, and Sophie Sinise, the daughter of actor Gary Sinise, is not that bad in her feature film debut.  Veteran Robert Davi doesn't have that much to do, but helps give the picture some credibility.

Sometimes limited to just a CG shark fin, the special effects are often minimalistic.  On a limited budget, the kills often involve the shark swimming in to chomp on someone, and then cutting away during the kill.  In an already overused stunt, the swamp shark leaps from the water to decapitates its victim.  It takes a team effort to bring the creature to a bloody demise, as Breysler employs a harpoon gun, while Rachel strangely takes it all in from the sidelines.  Swamp Shark isn't impressive, but for various reasons, it is kind of fun, and doesn't have a lot of stupid and annoying characters racing around like idiots.  It's fairly watchable for a Sy Fy production, although you might want to catch it on cable first, before you decide to buy.",1314489600,23,3287,4.893501805054152
4653358,4,B005CHV14A,"this movie is stupid but cool the stupid part is that the shrieff saw the shark said that their is no shark.and the black guy was too drunk to notice the shark and got eaten,idiot.and the one deputy was a prevert and got eaten.and the girl's boyfriend was acting like a complete jerk and got eaten.and finally when the sister went on the boat the guy who invited her destoried the radio and therw her phone in the water and thank goodness he died.so the shark is a good guy by killing the stupid people in the movie.

4653372,3,B005CHV14A,"""Swamp Shark"" is another aquatic romp that's been done better many times before, but from the vantage point of a lover of cinematic cheese is still a cause for celebration. The film opens with a corrupt sheriff (Robert Davi) running an illegal rare animal smuggling operation when a giant shark gets out of a tanker truck and jumps into the Louisiana swamp. What could possibly go wrong? While the acting is generally awful throughout, the individual scenes are often almost breathtakingly poetic in their beauty. I offer as an example the very special ""whiskey retrieval scene"" which is not to be missed. It turns out that sharks like people in canoes. Or on houseboats. Or standing within 10 miles of the shore. You get the picture. Though there is no nudity or really anything objectionable here the romance angles are sickly sweet and ultra-contrived. Be prepared to laugh at the awkwardness all the way around.

In keeping with the genre, it's time for the ""Tenth Annual Gatorfest,"" which is pretty lame even as Gatorfests go, and there is the typical debate about shutting it down or not due to the fishy threat. The police gator patrol, meanwhile, is particularly ineffective at their job. It turns out that our heroes, restauranteur Rachael (Kristy Swanson) and her sister Krystal (Sophie Sinise, yes, Gary's daughter in her dramatic debut) along with various brothers, boyfriends, and the leader of the undercover ""Fish and Wildlife SWAT Team"" end up either imperiled, imperiling others or themselves, and occasionally menacing a shark in a variety of humorous ways. (Did I mention this is a very rare shark with an exoskeleton?...Oh never mind.) After the least likely escape from the law in history, Krystal turns out to be the least skanky girl in the movie, all while figuring out how to outsmart a fish with a brain the size of a walnut. After the annoying boyfriends get munched and guzzled (and not a moment too soon) there are novel choking scenes and a dune buggy tussle that are not to be missed.

The film concludes with the cast assembling a bomb made from fish and a propane tank and trying to shove it down the shark's throat while sniper Rachael shoots it. (I seem to recall something like that in a movie before...now where was that?) No matter: the resultant and wholly expected toothy smackdown of the evil sheriff is a thing of hilarious beauty. I will tell you that the fish bomb produced an unexpected result, but I won't tell you how the shark is ultimately dispatched as it's a high point of the film.

""Swamp Shark"" is in the middle of the pack for contemporary outlandishly ridiculous sea creature films. The special effects are especially poor, which provides one rich layer of the tapestry that makes the film what it is. When you combine the plot, the acting, the romance, and the armored shark in a swamp, it's hard not to appreciate the film, even if only on a very primeval level.",1425686400,3,2920,4.766798418972332

A better reason than normal - the sheriff doesn't want to go to jail.  Good B movie cast Kristy Swanson (the original Buffy out to slay a shark this time), D.B. Sweeney and Robert Davi.

She sets out with family, friends and a jerk boyfriend to get the shark and have her restaurant opened again.  Fun and entertaining movie with a few annoying characters (bait).

The story is about a town trying to recover after Katrina.  The local town relies on its annual Gatorfest for tourist dollars.  Rachel Bouchard (Kristy Swanson) owns a restaurant that is popular with the locals.  Rachel's brother and her niece Crystal work there.  The close-knit and peaceful town is policed by a corrupt sheriff (Robert Davi) who is making some extra cash as part of an exotic-animal smuggling ring.  Sheriff has the hots for Rachel, but she has her eye on a mysterious stranger in town.  (Rachel and Crystal look like they are sisters in real life. )

Sheriff bungles a handover of a rare shark, that gets away in the bayou.  He does nothing except cover his rear end, and dismisses Rachel's claims of seeing a shark eat her restaurant's tame gators.

8465454,4,B005CHV14A,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2011 and directed by Griff Furst, Swamp Shark chronicles events in the Louisiana bayou when an exotic shark thats nigh invulnerable due to being used to low depths is released into the swamp. Kristy Swanson, Sophie Sinise & Jeff Chase play the sibling owners of a restaurant whose livelihood is threatened due to the creature. Jason Rogel plays an overweight-but-intelligent Asian worker with eyes on the younger sibling. Robert Davi appears as the corrupt sheriff while D.B. Sweeney is on hand as a gung-ho game warden.

The low reviews are hilarious because Swamp Shark works for what it is, a made-for-TV nature-runs-amok flick. The tone is generally serious, but comic booky with campy/amusing elements (e.g. the sheriff & his deputies). True, its hackneyed and rips-off elements of Jaws (so what else is new?), but you cant help but root for the five protagonists and you can't beat the authentic Louisiana bayou locations. Moreover, there are a few decent cuties, including Sinise. Speaking of which, Natacha Itzel has an unexpected and suspenseful strangling scene, which is well done.

THE FILM RUNS 85 minutes and was shot in Henderson & Lafayette, Louisiana. WRITERS: Jennifer Iwen & Eric Miller (also Charles Bolon).
