8473264,5,B005HM7DNS,"I bought this DVD because I was doing a research on the Goddess of Compassion and Forgiveness, Kuan Yin. I had read something about the actress but there is not much about the movie because it was done some decades ago. What a wonderful surprise!  The film shows the story of a reincarnation of the Goddess Kuan Yin, in details, with an actress who is pretty much a Goddess. I do recommend to all who have an interest in this wonderful Goddess, committed to help and hear the cries of the world, no matter the timeline. Remmember that you have to have a multisystem device because it was done in Hong Kong.",1391990400,,606,4.410714285714286
