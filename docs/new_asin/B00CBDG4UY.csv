5711242,3,B00CBDG4UY,There is very little action in the DVD.  It is essentially about men talking about their lives.  Only a couple of scenes hold some action.,1379376000,,138,4.48
5711243,3,B00CBDG4UY,"While ""Brothers"" set a new standard in continuous filming, it also lacked a great deal on accuracy. Too few actors, no real story line of any real depth, very poor real life living conditions of WWI trench warfare, are just a few of many draw backs of this DVD.",1378425600,10,261,4.346938775510204
5711244,2,B00CBDG4UY,"I'm a fan of Canadian film, so I thought this would be an interesting addition to my war flicks collection.

The ""all in one take"" thing is interesting, and the acting was OK, the script felt a bit forced in some sections.

Also, in the ""being picky about military flick details"", the uniforms and personal kit on the troops often looked WAY too clean to have been in a trench for some time.",1377734400,14,391,4.342465753424658
5711245,2,B00CBDG4UY,"This movie received international aclaim but I found it to be forced acting, dull subject matter and not easy to follow.  The background action was almost nonexistent and ther was no musical score to maintain sime interest.  All in all, it was very boring and I like almost anything.  I've never given a bad movie review and I wanted to give this movie a chance but it just stank!",1377043200,3,380,4.478260869565218
5711246,1,B00CBDG4UY,"Bad filming, actors, conversation, color, argument, etc etc. Do not waste your money no action, worth of a portrait for this film,",1375574400,2,130,4.954545454545454
5711247,2,B00CBDG4UY,"Now I was not expecting an epic with thousands of extras and big name actors, but this Canadian effort was poorly done as it seemed like it was a bunch of over-weight reenactors festooned in all their expensive but authentic web gear (kits, excuse me) and .303 Enfields stumbling about in trenches that were far too shallow and not enough sandbags. It was well done as far as the gear and uniforms, don't get me wrong, but the attempt to portray the filthy conditions, the vermin (not one rat was in the cast) was nowhere to be seen. No duckboards, the sandbags weren't stacked well and it seemed like all the guys were too tall for the trench. I understand the limitations of budgets and such, but everybody was far too clean and orderly. Ever go camping for a few days? Dirt just seems to follow you and clings to you but in this film the cast were too neat and clean and few whiskers were visible. I did like the two ceramic rum jars in the beginning. I know the film was supposed to focus on the hazards and daily frustrations faced by the troops but this fell short.
And besides that, my new DVD froze near the end. Nadda. Not sure how it ended but it could have been so much better for an independent and low-budget film.",1374796800,30,1227,4.339130434782609
5711248,4,B00CBDG4UY,I liked this movie and it was a good war film of world war l. I would recommend it to anyone interested in world war 1 history. The film was of the Canadian Army in the trenches of world war1 .,1374278400,,193,3.731707317073171
5711249,5,B00CBDG4UY,"This is a film about a group of Canadian soldiers in World War !, who are very close to each other, and the horrors of trench warfare, are truly depicted. This film, has no breaks in filming from beginning to end, no breaks. Great acting, because if you screwed up, they would have to start all over again. I loved it.",1373500800,8,318,4.229508196721311

8579735,1,B00CBDG4UY,This could be the worst film I have ever seen. I watched the first 20 minutes and that was all I could take.,1426204800,,108,3.739130434782609

8579741,1,B00CBDG4UY,"Just abysmal is the only way to describe this film. I own hundreds & hundreds of war/history DVDs and couldn't get thru this movie it had so little to hold my attention; no action, no characters to get to know, no interesting dialogue (the film has no subtitles by the way which doesn't help) and the ending is just ridiculous. Its not like war movies can't be well done on a small budget. Also listed along with this film is ""Juno""  about Canadian troops during WWII on D-Day. ""Juno"" is very well done and a WAY better film than this drek. If you want a great WWI film about soldiers in the trenches, they haven't made anything finer than ""Paths of Glory"" with Kirk Douglas and probably never will!",1394150400,3,699,4.4186046511627906
8579742,1,B00CBDG4UY,"I've seen High School amatuer videos with more substance than this. The special effects were pitiful, there were less than 2 dozen people on the set, and I didn't like the actors being ""filmeed and talking to the combat photographer"" who'm you don't see. I stop watching about halfway through. I couldn't take it anymore. Only buy this if you suffer from Insomnia.",1382400000,8,364,4.7936507936507935
8579743,4,B00CBDG4UY,"this film potrays a solid story and crazy battle scenes, a movie that will have you wanting to know about the war and how it felt to be in it",1381795200,,141,3.7333333333333334
