5409002,5,B00ABMW6X6,What a wonderful passionate story.  Very easy to follow.  The acting is superb with some incredible Hungarian folk dancing that is truly enjoyable to watch.  I love movies with happy endings that leave you feeling satisfied.  I know you will enjoy watching this story as much as I did.,1437782400,3,285,4.755102040816326
5409003,4,B00ABMW6X6,"Great film that will probably go un-noticed!  Story has a lot more weight to it than what the preview says.  The Hungarian language parts to this film (which is about 90% of the movie), are skillfully sub-titled, unlike most Hungarian translations in movies!  This is a small film done on a small budget, however, it was wonderfully done.  Just don't expect big budget effects or anything like that.  The story doesn't need!",1433030400,3,424,4.833333333333333
5409004,5,B00ABMW6X6,"Loved this movie.  From a dance artist's perspective, staging folk dance carries baggage which can only intensify the passion conveyed on a stage.  That baggage includes nostalgia for the folk, the task of bringing that art to a space, each dancer's personal weaknesses and the willingness to labor at all costs for perfection to guarantee one's place in the world.",1430438400,2,365,5.066666666666666
5409005,4,B00ABMW6X6,"Not sure how I stumbled upon this in my Amazon Prime viewing...but I took a chance and it was well worth it.  Hungary... my only shallow context of that country was in relation to second world war. The story here is not original, but opened my thoughts to a place/and culture on earth that I never even contemplated the existence of. I want to go there. Hungary seems like an intersection of so many parts of the world. Glad I found it.",1427414400,3,436,4.317073170731708
5409006,5,B00ABMW6X6,An exceptional Magyar film highlighting the extent of the consequences politics and the making of 'art' have on individual and family relationships. Decisions are not easy and come with deep compromises.,1425168000,4,203,5.580645161290323
8549849,4,B00ABMW6X6,"My mother was born in Hungary and the rest of my family is from Austria and Germany so I am familiar with this type of folk dancing. All of these countries have very aggressive and physically difficult dances. I've also been privileged to participate in some off-broadway productions. Doing folk dances among your peers and for pleasure is completely different from mounting a production for an audience that pays to be entertained. This movie shows how difficult that process is; from getting funding to putting the production together.  That's only one part of the film. The other is the political and family situations that took place before the story begins.  Can two brothers, who haven't seen or spoken to each other in 20 years, bring Hungarian dancers on a world tour?  Much love, hate, lies and finally truth must be sorted thru before we reach the end of the story.  A word about the music. The high, pitched wind instrument can be difficult to listen to if you are not use to it. Let the music fade into the background and enjoy the dancing and the story. Both are dramatic and worth while.",1517184000,,1101,4.689119170984456
8549850,4,B00ABMW6X6,A former dancer and one who choreographed a few performances - wow! Really developed characters that pull you into their story while watching a group of dancers progress from a bit dusty to shimmering. Very good acting - watch this one.,1499644800,,236,4.780487804878049

8549853,5,B00ABMW6X6,A really honest portrayal of how due to petty jealousies family can treat one another viciously without an ounce of compassion.,1461974400,3,127,5.095238095238095
8549854,5,B00ABMW6X6,"I loved this. To see traditional folkdance choreographed so full of emotion was amazing. The human experience of family, love and betrayal echoed in the dance, music and cinematography thrilled me. Here was folkdance elevated to it's truest art form. Bravo to all who worked to create this film, it's not often that a film touches me the way this one did. If you're a folkdancer you'll love this film Riverdance step aside.",1459900800,3,423,4.808219178082192
