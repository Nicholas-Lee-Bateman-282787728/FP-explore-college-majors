7889309,3,6305378495,"My WCW flashbacks continue as this is Slamboree '99.  Around this time, DDP was the World Champion & turned heel while Kevin Nash was the #1 contendor & turned babyface while still being a member of the nWo Wolfpac who were the heels...all within a course of a month.  Ric Flair was ""consumed with power"" as WCW President to the point where Roddy Piper was able to have committed to a mental hospitial (I'm not making this up, it happened) & both men are feuding over who the office of WCW President.  Speaking of Ric Flair, Randy Savage cost him the WCW Championship the previous month so Flair refused to offer Savage reinstatement into WCW which lead into arguments with not only them but their sidekicks in referee Charles Robinson (Flair) & Georgous George (Savage).  While Savage was busy with Flair, he was also assisting DDP in title matches to help him win the WCW Title twice in the past month.  And as far as trying to keep up with who is & isn't apart of the nWo...good luck as Scott Steiner & Kevin Nash were members despite one being a heel & the other a babyface and with the appearence of Eric Bischoff later this night, you'll just be more confused.

WCW Tag Team Champions Rey Mysterio & Billy Kidman vs. Raven & Saturn vs. Chris Benoit & Dean Malenko - The setup for this match was confusing as there are times were it looked like a three way dance with one man from each team allowed in the ring at a time while other times was just a one on one with one team being the odd man out like a triangle match.  This was quite the opening match as you had your high flyin', mat wrestling, and double teaming & multiman brawls with there never being a slow/dull moment with even Arn Anderson getting in his class ""spinebuster"" at one point.

Konnan vs. Stevie Ray - Despite the nWo Wolfpac group looking like a mess, the black & white nWo was still together as Stevie Ray was the leader of the group with Horace Hogan & Vincent being in his corner.  The match was your average performance with nothing really special here as Konnan got the win with help from Rey Mysterio evening the odds.

Falls Count Anywhere/Hardcore Match: Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Brian Knobbs - This was typical of what WCW thought ""hardcore"" was at the time where both guys for the most part were brawling & using various weapons like trash cans, chairs, cookie sheets and eventually moving on to the internet position & merchandise stand.  This wasn't anything special past the typical WCW ""hardcore"" match but the most entertaining parts to look out for  was when the announcers wanted to hear the impact of the weapons being used but Mike Tenay just wouldn't shut up.

WCW Television Champion Booker T vs. Rick Steiner - This was another good wrestling encounter here between both men but the suprize appearence of Scott Steiner helped Rick win the Television Title & left Rick Steiner confused...or was he?

""Lil Natch"" Charles Robinson vs. Gorgeous George - Wow, you knew this match was going to be something right from the bat when Charles Robinson came out looking like Flair's mini-me straight down the ring gear, robe, hair, strut, tan, and ""WHOO!"".  All I can say is that this match was just straight classic entertainment with everyone around getting a moment like Charles Robinson slamming Ms. Madness on the floor (""Molly Holly""), Madusa & Aysa getting into it, Robinson getting in all of Flair's classic spots (argue with referee & get shoved down, whipped into & flip over turnbuckle before being thrown off the top rope, walking around & falling down face first, figure four leg lock), and George delivering Savage's elbow drop.  Just great entertainment from start to finish.

WCW United States Champion Scott Steiner vs. Buff Bagwell - Bagwell was looking for revenge against Steiner for his post-Uncensored attack by Steiner for costing him the TV Title.  The match was good for what it was but nothing special past the suprize appearence from Rick Steiner leading into the reunion of the Steiner Brothers.

Ric Flair vs. Roddy Piper - Unfortunally, this match comes off as a disappointment as this match didn't come close to their previous encounters & I just found this one boring as Roddy Piper was very ""limited"" in what he could do at this point in his career while Flair just couldn't carry wrestlers to a wreslting classics at this point either.  The only thing that kept this match entertaining was Charles Robinson being heavily bias towards Flair to the point where Flair quit as one time but Charles said that he didn't quit.  In the end, Flair cheated to win but Eric Bischoff came out (who was last seen as a member of the nWo) & reversed the decision to Piper.  Nothing got solved here.

Sting vs. Goldberg - This match heavily resembled the recent John Cena/Batista match as far as buildup goes because this was a WCW dream match just thrown together with no real major storyline behind it.  The match was real short (around 10 mins.) and was good with each man trying to stop the others momentum & being able to counter each other's attacks.  In the end though, this was just there to set up future storylines involving the reunited Steiner Brothers against Sting while Goldberg's being injured courtesy of Bret Hart.

WCW Champion Diamond Dallas Page vs. Kevin Nash - This match really showcased how underrated DDP was as a wrestler because he carried & dominated Kevin Nash for a majority of the match by working on Nash's knee (he he did Hogan's last month) & using heel tactics like an exposed turnbuckle & using weapons like the microphone while Nash stuck to his usual offensive performance.  Randy Savage eventually came out to get DDP disqualified & keep his title before Bischoff appeared to have the match restarted before Kevin Nash once again won the WCW Championship.  The match was good but that was thanks to the inring work of DDP more than Nash.

In the end, there really wasn't a horrible match on here but there wasn't anything really to go out of your way for past the highly funny Charles Robinson/Georgous George & the opening tag team title match.  In the end, I would recommend if your a heavy fan of WCW or have some spare cash to spend.",1220918400,,6179,4.631868131868132

7889311,4,6305378495,"I'll tell ya, this was the best Slamboree they put together. The 1st match between Chris Benoit & Dean Malenko Vs. Raven & Saturn Vs. Kidman & Rey Mysterio Jr. is a great match to open up the PPV, in my opinion though the match lasted a little too long. My personal favorite matches  are: Sting Vs. Goldberg, Buff Bagwell Vs. Scott Steiner, Kevin Nash Vs.  DDP, and the Hardcore match with Bam Bam Bigelow and Brian Knobbs isn't bad  either. The reason with me giving this tape 4 stars and calling it the best  Slamboree ever was the match between Gorgeous George and Charles Robinson  because this match is good for a few laughs but if your looking for actual  wrestling, watch the match with Konnan and Stevie Ray, or better yet, the  TV Title match with Rick Steiner against Booker T. Even though before the  event everyone knew that Nash was going to beat DDP for the world title but  atleast they made a good match out of it and even added a little twist when  Randy Savage interfered. All in all, this was a great tape.",948412800,,1025,4.375661375661376
7889312,5,6305378495,I was at this event and let me tell you I've seen just about every PPV NWA/WCW has had and this was definitely one of the better ones. Gorgeous George(macho man's 21 yr. old girlfriend) vs. Lil Nature Boy Charles  Robinson. Ric Flair vs. Roddy Piper. Sting vs. Goldberg. DDP vs. Big Sexy  Kevin Nash. Raven/Saturn vs. Malenko/Benoit vs. Kidman/Mysterio. Konnan vs.  Stevie Ray. Booker T vs. Rick Steiner. Scott Steiner vs. Buff Bagwell. Bam  Bam Bigelow vs. Brian Knobs. Worth the full retail price. Lots of twists  & turns. ***** WCW's best in last 2 years!!,927158400,,559,4.721649484536083
