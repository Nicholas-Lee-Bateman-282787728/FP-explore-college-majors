8638565,4,B00I2ZTAEW,"This is one of the worst films made by Asylum. I am a lover of their bad films and this one tickled my funny bone.

The DVD cover similar to ""Rosemary's Baby"" leaves no mystery as to the identity of the baby. The film opens with a Mayan calendar, some Bible verses, and words spoken about pharaohs just to cover all the bases. Our ""Damien"" or Sebastian in this case is born C-section, the kind of C-section where they use no anesthetic and the mother (Sara Malakul Lane) cries in pain.

Our infant, which looks like an ugly prop from a David Lynch film, was apparently inspired by the bunny in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" as he can fly around and grab people by the jugular with his long razor sharp teeth. In spite of the kid having teeth and clearing out the birthing room in a deadly fashion, mom ignores it all and opts to breast feed...ouch!

12/12/12 is something that is used by a doomsday cult, most likely because my nephew born on 6/6/66 is boring and sells insurance.

The detective (Steve Hanks) has a fondness for lollipops...Oh where did the writers come up with that?!

This is a low budget film that goes absolutely no where. The plot doesn't flow well and is haphazard. The dialouge and acting was bad, but if you are going to use bad actors, rule of thumb is to use pretty D-cup women so us guys won't care...thanks Asylum.

This is a great film for bad Asylum film lovers as the budget and special effects are worse than usual.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, rape, nudity (Sara Malakul Lane, Bonnie Grinberg) 4-5 stars for Asylum fans, 1 star for non-fans.",1401062400,,1580,4.446366782006921
