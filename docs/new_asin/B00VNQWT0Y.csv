That is not a criticism of the previous show as I really did enjoy it.  Just an observation.  In this case we begin with Queen Elizabeth the first and range through Queen Elizabeth the second.  Not every monarchal period is covered.  In just one hour run-time, it is not possible to have anything near comprehensive.  However, the various details and anecdotes are pretty interesting and entertaining.

COVERAGE OVERVIEW:  Though we begin with the Reign of Queen Elizabeth the first, there is a quick reference of how she adjusted and learned from Henry VIII.  The program demonstrates how Elizabeth even passed statutes using dress as a means for establishing station and keeping people in their place.  The size of Elizabeth's wardrobe is unbelievable and the detail and cost of a single dress extraordinary.  From the Tudors we see the evolution to the Stuarts and their attitude about clothing and how that may have affected the population in some ways.  This includes the printing press and how that was used to form opinions on the royal family and their dress.  It is demonstrated how Charles II had to separate himself from the image of his father Charles I who was executed.  We move quickly through the Georgian periods.  Through each of these so far there is some really interesting comparison of women's foundation garments designed to create silhouettes that are quite strange to us now.  Queen Victoria's impression from later paintings showing her a little more doughty are dispelled as her younger dresses and carefully orchestrated image are explored.  The program quickly moves through 20th Century reigns focusing mainly on Elizabeth and her sister Margaret.  Contrasting Margaret's ability to use fashion house Dior while Elizabeth creates a conservative yet timeless style that has changed little over many decades.  There is also a quick sidetrack to discuss Princess Diana's style and wardrobe sale.

FINAL THOUGHTS;  Seeing Dr Lucy Worsley try on and demonstrate many examples of the clothing (usually modern reconstructions) is a highlight and illustrates their complexity and even absurdity in some cases.  A few trips to historical sights are included.  She also asserts early origins of the suit coat and white wedding dress.",1435363200,2,2680,5.528255528255528

7099841,4,B00VNQWT0Y,"Let's start with Elizabeth I, 400 years ago: ""Right from the start of her reign, Elizabeth had to control her image very carefully."" Dr. Lucy Worsley tells us that a 1599 inventory shows that Elizabeth had 1,326 dresses. None of her clothing survives, unfortunately, except for one lonely corset.

Then through the Stuarts, where  ""clothes could contribute to the breaking up of a monarchy."" On to the Georgians and the mantua, the least practical dress ever. On to Queen Victoria, who we rather remember as this dour lady dressed in black. But it hadn't always been so, and Worsley shows us a delightful tartan dress that Victoria wore when she was 18. Victoria was only 5' 1"", so her dress looks like it's standing in a hole next to the curators.

Worsley ends with the current queen, Elizabeth II, not forgetting Princess Diana, who created waves with her beauty and her clothing.

""Tales From the Royal Wardrobe"" is not just a show-case for clothing. It is about how clothing can have a real effect. For the royals, ""clothing has created their image and helped determine whether they've been loved or loathed."" It doesn't hurt that our host includes interesting tidbits and stories to keep our interest.

During the show, Worsley talks with Professor Karen Hearn (art historian, University College London), Mark Wallis (costume historian), Susan North (curator, Victoria and Albert Museum), Eleri Lynn (curator, Historic Royal Palaces), Beatrice Behlen (curator, Museum of London), Deidre Murphy (curator, Historic Royal Palaces), Dr. Shaun Cole (London College of Fashion), Austin Matti-Mewse (author/curator, Hardy Amies) and Meredith Etherington-Smith (editor-in-chief, Christie's Publishing).

Locations visited include Christies of NY, The Cromwell Museum, Hardy Amies (London), Hatfield House, Museum of London, The Royal Parks, The Savoy (London), Victoria and Albert Museum, Walton Heath Golf Club, Westminster Abbey Museum, Whitehall Palace Banqueting Room and a London street called Wardrobe Place.

If you're watching on DVD, English subtitles are available on the 54 minute show. There are no bonus extras on the DVD.

Worsley is Chief Curator for the Historic Royal Palaces. These are palaces owned by the Crown, but no longer lived in. Hampton Court, for example, is no longer a residence for any of the royal family. I imagine that Worsley's position gives her easier access to historical items.

An enjoyable show, though not long. 4.4 stars rounded down to 4.
I recommend another show hosted by Worsley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-the-Six-Wives-DVD/dp/B01N5EQI2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of the Six Wives DVD</a>,  It's longer, and chock full of interesting details.

7099843,5,B00VNQWT0Y,"Lucy Worsley's work, in print and film is must-read/see for anyone interested in Western European social history. When she wears clothing based on the period she is telling us about, it's a little kitchy, but it does help me to imagine what moving about in them would feel like. She has access to so many incredible resources and we have access to them through her. She is a natural born teacher and story teller. Dr. Worsley, if you read this, please consider a longer, more in-depth book/documentary like you did on the home.",1486857600,,527,4.67741935483871

7099896,3,B00VNQWT0Y,The photography and detail in the recreations are well-done and fascinating.  The presenter is too flippant and mocking so as to misrepresent some history.  She mocks some monarchs for being too flashy and then praises others for doing exactly the same.  It would much more enjoyable without the attempts at humor.,1464048000,,314,5.117647058823529

I've watched several of Lucy Worley's other documentaries, and she is both informative and interesting. The saying ""The clothes make the man"" is certainly true for the men and women of the British monarchy. The next time I read a period book, I think I'll review this to get the feeling of the era.
Lucy, you need to make a documentary about the clothes of the gentry, the guilds, and the peasantry. I wish I had this resource when I taught English Literature.",1462752000,,558,4.480392156862745

7099927,4,B00VNQWT0Y,Well done documentary. Especially like the parade of the host actually wearing of some of the styles. You can get a much better vision when you see real clothes rather than just art work. This is a very basic look at the subject but still enjoyable.,1461369600,,249,4.434782608695652

7099936,4,B00VNQWT0Y,"This was quite interesting.  I've always wondered about these things since I love historical romances, and created my own clothing in the '70's.

7100236,4,B00VNQWT0Y,An interesting glimpse into the impact fashion can have on the public's perception of royals. This one hour program covers Henry VIII through Princess Diana and focuses on both royals whose fashion helped their public image and whose fashion hurt their public image.  The host models several recreated styles and it was fascinating to see how this clothing looked live rather than just in paintings. My favorite was the dress that was 8 feet wide but only 18 inches front to back. Fun to watch.,1456272000,10,494,4.811764705882353

The program could have been more substantive but it contained a lot of fun facts.
