8100107,5,B000CPKDMI,"I loved this production of Anne Perry's ""Cater Street Hangman"", the first Charlotte and Thomas Pitt mystery. Keeley Hawes and Eoin McCarthy are perfectly cast as Charlotte Ellison and Thomas Pitt.  I agree with previous posters that they softened the mystery by changing the solution, but I think I appreciate it less for the mystery, and more for the story of Charlotte and Thomas.  It's too bad this isn't available on it's own anymore.  It's still available as part the British Victorian Collection,  but as I really don't want the other three movies that come with it,  I'm glad I was able to get ""the Cater Street Hangman"" on it's own.  I started reading the books because of this production, and still imagine Charlotte and Thomas as they were in the movie.",1339545600,,763,4.742424242424242
8100108,4,B000CPKDMI,"I agree with the earlier reviewer that changing the ending was not such a good idea. The book ending was more interesting and provocative. The additional of the Kali worshipper was inexplicable. But the change in the death of the sister was compelling, and the progression of the relationship between Thomas Pitt and Charlotte Ellison was better done in the movie.
I didn't like these actors at first but upon watching the movie again, they grew on me. The small budget is very obvious, though.
Worth watching, but not brillant.",1313539200,,528,4.877777777777778
8100109,5,B000CPKDMI,"This A&E production is a faithful and excellent adaptation of Anne Perry's novel of the same name. The A&E description of the plot follows:

""In the class-conscious world of Victorian England, the Ellison family is painfully aware of their respectable place in the comfortable London neighborhood of Cater Street. But when a young woman is garroted nearby, it is the beginning of a remarkable sequence of events that will see their world shattered.

At first, the Ellisons dismiss the murder as the result of the victim's impropriety after all, a real lady simply couldn't be the victim of such a tragedy. But when the killer strikes again, he takes the life of the Ellison's maid, and a gruff, no-nonsense police inspector with no care for anything but solving the crime comes calling. Inspector Pitt makes it clear that no one is above suspicion, and though some in the family object strenuously to a man of his position asking questions, their answers suggest that not all is being revealed. And when Pitt and one of the Ellison daughters start to fall for each other, a complicated case gets even stickier?

Based on Anne Perry's critically acclaimed novel of the same name, the first in a series of Charlotte and Thomas Pitt mysteries.""",1185062400,,1241,4.872037914691943
8100110,5,B000CPKDMI,I have been reading Anne Perry's Thomas and Charlotte Pitt mystery series.  This movie gave me some faces to put with my reading.,1152489600,,129,4.608695652173913
8100111,5,B000CPKDMI,"and history.  This movie combines all the above in one, and maintains  a level of enjoyment that is unadulterated by gratuitous sex and violence.  The story of a young woman of a good family who is constrained by the cultural mores of her time, struggling to find her place in the midst of a serial killer is interesting for the insight into the Victorian Era, and the development of the crimes. Her introduction to a completely ""unsuitable"" hero as the crime is solved hold ones attention and interest.",1142985600,,503,4.693181818181818
8100112,3,B000CPKDMI,"Most of the time, when I hear the words, ""Based on the book by..."" I cringe and turn the channel.  Not so with 'The Cater Street Hangman'.  While not entirely true to the Anne Perry book, it contained most of the major details and was suspenseful enought to make the ending rather shocking.  The casting was good (although I must admit that I always pictured Thomas Pitt as being a polite but rather unremarkable-looking man - which he wasn't in the movie!).  Charlotte was wonderful.  I would very much like to see other Anne Perry books dramatised in a similar fashion - perhaps the William Monk series?  The only reason I gave it three stars rather than four was because the limited budget was painfully apparent on occasion - for example, Charlotte's final encounter with the murderer.  That, at least, could have been filmed better.  But all-in-all, certainly worth a look.",1058832000,,878,4.768211920529802
8100113,3,B000CPKDMI,"As a big fan of Thomas and Charlotte Pitt, I awaited the TV version of The Cater Street Hangman with interest. As a whole I was quite pleased. The characters looked exactly as I pictured them and the acting and casting were excellent. However, I must confess to a slight sense of disappointment with the ending. In the TV version, it turns out that the murderer is killing young girls because she thinks they are after her husband, while in the book it is clear she is trying to destroy them because she is attracted to them herself. It's far more surprising and thought provoking than the version the TV producers gave us. Why did they feel the need to change it?True, there are people who dislike any reference to homosexuality, but must we cater to them in all things? Charlotte (in the book) says ""I never knew women could feel like that...about other women"", but we know it happens and it's no longer shocking. Must we still subscribe to Victorian notions of modesty?
That being said, I hope there are plans to bring the rest of the series to the small screen.",1025049600,,1065,4.523316062176166
8100114,5,B000CPKDMI,"Anne Perry is the MASTER in taking a reader to Victorian England. Even more than reading Dickens, the reader (and in this case the viewer) really feels a part of that era. This writer is, in my humble opinion, a genius. This film is as nearly a perfect realization of the book as could be expected. It does condense a long novel into a 2 hour time frame, but does so wonderfully. For those who criticize the changes made to the film, they should be aware that in interviews Ms Perry endorses the film. Books and films are two different things and what works on the printed page, does not sometimes work on film.

""Cater Street Hangman"" is the book that introduces Thomas Pitt and Charlotte Ellison (soon to be Pitt). In this film, the two actors could not have been better chosen. They look and act as a reader has pictured these characters in each of the books. Ms. Perry has stated that she considered the casting to be exactly right.

It would not be fair to state the plot. That would take away from anyone who is finding it for the first time. The complex and winning characters are fully realized and leave the viewer wanting more of the books transfered to film.

The fog shrouded, gaslit streets, the elegant drawing rooms, the social conditions, every facet of late 19th century London is perfectly captured. The muted colors are exactly right for the story. This production does not have the feel of a film quickly made for TV. It is a beautifully made recreation of the Victorian era with a puzzeling series of murders.

Any Anne Perry fan will love it and anyone just discovering Ms. Perry will find themselves ""hooked"".",994204800,,1632,4.559726962457338
8100115,4,B000CPKDMI,"Sarah Hellings did a brillant job with the direction of this film.  The Victorian setting makes it ideal for a murder mystery. From the opening shot, where you see the body of the first victim, to the death of the Ellison maid, Lily,(played beautifully by singer Hannah Spearitt of S Club 7 fame), to the  investigation by Charlette and the police officer, to the  revealing of the murder's identity, this movie will have you  on the edge of your seat.  Anne Perry did a wonderful job creating the suspenseful plot, which has you guessing who the murderer is throughout both the book, and the movie. A perfect novel AND movie, for all who love mysteries. This movie definatly got ME hooked on to these types of mysteries, and I hope to enjoy it for years to come!",989452800,,763,4.54014598540146
8100116,4,B000CPKDMI,"Sarah Helling's film version of British novelist Anne Perry's ""Cater Street Hangman"" takes us into the dark misty streets of 19th-century London, streets that hold a terrifying entity:  the Cater Street Hangman.  Like most film versions of novels, this film is not as detailed as the book, but it is beautifully done.  Viewers are treated to an inside look at the manners and morals of Victorian days, but with a sinister twist. In a respectable, presumably safe, British neighborhood, young women are being brutally slain.  Who is doing these dastardly deeds? Let's just say it's not the typical villain, and the film keeps the viewer ""hanging"" until the last possible moment. Add to this the exta romantic plot that brings together Thomas Pitt and Charlotte Ellison, two of Perry's best protagonists in her long-running series of Victorian murder mysteries, and the audience is in for a true cinema treat. The acting, sets, and costuming are superb.  Somebody obviously has done her research on this one, as it is quite historically accurate and entertaining at the same time.",970099200,,1078,5.067796610169491
