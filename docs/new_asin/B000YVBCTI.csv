Here is what we have and I don't think any of this will be a spoiler. Dad who is the backbone of this bunch passes away, Mom not too strong and doesn't know how to deal, her sister moves in to ""help"" but she is a parasite. The daughter flips out and does something horrible and mom doesn't even react. The son thinks he should be in charge and acts out too. Mom meets another guy family hate3s each other til Jacks 21st birthday and all of it comes out. I was so annoyed at all the drama and pouting that went on that at times I almost turned it off. This is a sad and not happy movie. Would I recommend....if you are already depressed...no....you will cut your wrists. If you want to see a fairly good film and can put up with the crap of the kids especially jack, go for it.",1485734400,,888,4.1988304093567255

8234249,3,B000YVBCTI,"For the last two nights my bargain-rack movie has been the ""Alpha Male"" DVD which I purchased at a nearby Ross Store. I'd never heard of the movie. I guess the packaging looked as if it might be a quality movie. In any case, I picked it up along with a half-dozen other movies and put off viewing it for a while. Then I bit the bullet.

The production quality of this movie is quite high. The photography and soundtrack are excellent. The setting is, well, magnificent. The movie took place in a British upper class home. Well, the home looked more like a castle than a home. Actually, it reminded me of a good-sized university building on a posh, magnificently landscaped campus, except that there was much more vacant land about and much fewer people. In any case an extended family of five occupied this gargantuan piece of real estate, but servants, groundskeepers and the like seemed to be absent. I guess it just somehow managed to take care of itself. The family was undergoing some business-related stress. Ultimately, the father died.

As the movie proceeded at a glacial pace, we gradually met the participants. I'd judge the acting to be good, but none of the characters has even the least appeal. They're just people going through their high-class existence at that glacial pace. Well, I finally got so that I just couldn't take it anymore and I turned the movie off to be resumed the next night. Believe me, I never do that! However, I was tired, the movie was dragging on and on and I had to get up early the next day. Well, the next night the movie resumed. Same thing. I was hoping that something dramatic would happen, but it never did. Maybe there was something here that I somehow missed. An action film this was not! On and on and on the movie went and then finally all the remaining family got together at a birthday party and the credits appeared, almost by surprise. I couldn't help but wonder, what was this movie all about? If I had to give someone a concise explanation of the story, I couldn't do it. Well, there was a lot of upper class living and talking on a magnificent set. I guess that's it.

I couldn't help but wonder, what in the world was this, what would I do for a review and what did other reviewers think of it? So, I went to the product page for the first time. There were no reviews. No reviews? On a movie that came out in 2008? Not even a single review? Wow! This movie must have had the same impact on a lot of other people that it had on me. Zero. I've never been left at the end of a movie with feelings for all the actors no greater than those which I experienced when first introduced. I just didn't care. The entire situation just had no interest. None. I experienced no hostility, I might add, but the movie was just a total washout, but a very well done one. Very strange.
