8602800,1,B000LC4Y54,I was very disapointed with this dvd. I have about 12 dvd and vhs instructionals and every one has a tab booklet. This dvd does not have one. I emailed three diferent people at learnrootsmusic and also orville johnson to find out if i could obtain one. Not one person took the time to respond. The company I purchased it from refered me to Mel Bay who told me it did not come with a tab book. To me trying to figure out what is being demonstrated without the tabs is very frustrating. There is a lot of good dvd instructionals on the market and my suggestion is buy one of them instead. To me this one is a waste of money.,1262304000,3,622,4.10655737704918
