2747615,5,B000MTFY0K,"This DVD has so many benefits - it will be difficult to put into only a few words.  As a first time Mom and former Life Skills Support Teacher, I appreciated the DVD for it's practical, easy to follow massage' techniques.  I was also impressed with how genuine and well-thought out the content within the DVD was delivered.  Most of all, though - this DVD helped make very special ""connections"" among my daughter.  Ivy League Baby is so comprehensive in that it includes use of all senses - for Baby, as well as for the care-taker; and it explains how the simple techniques of massage' can bring you and your Baby closer together.  A PERFECT GIFT OF LOVE - for your Baby and You, your Mother-in-Law, a special friend who is expecting, or a nervous ""Stay at Home Dad""!

2747616,5,B000MTFY0K,"I learned so much about the art of baby massage from this DVD! I feel that it helped me grow closer to my daughter because every time I used the massage techniques, she would have an immediate response that was positive. I love the interaction it provides. This would be a great shower gift - I recommend it highly!",1170806400,3,315,4.3559322033898304
2747617,5,B000MTFY0K,"I loved the DVD, and now there is a baby nassage iphone app that is just as informative and easy to use. iphone, itouch and ipad users, search for Aimee's Babies Baby massage app. It's a must have for all new parents!",1170806400,10,217,4.190476190476191
2747618,5,B000MTFY0K,I wish this would have been around for my older kids! The instructor is a certified infant massage therapy instructor as well as an Occupational Therapist. She shares so many tips on how to help with development. I work with so many children that have sensory issues and have gone to many trainings on brain development. Aimee mentions many of the things I have learned on the DVD. As for one reviewer writing that her baby cried when getting the massage. Aimee states in the begining of the video that some babies might cry because they are not used to it and to stop the massage and try another time. She also states that it might take several attempts before the the child is ready for the whole thing. I love this dvd and reccomend it to all parents of young children!,1226966400,4,772,4.443661971830986
2747619,1,B000MTFY0K,"I really wanted to like this video and at first I did!  It started out being very informative and helpful on a variety of baby developmental subjects.

Why did I give it 1 star?

The instructional portion on the actual massage seemed okay until I tried it on my baby.  The very first technique I used on our 7 week old baby girl was basically having her on her back and sliding my fingers gently over her lower back/kidney area.

I did exactly what the video instructed.  My baby started crying so hysterically that she couldn't catch her breath for several long seconds at a time.  It took me about 10 minutes to console her.  I felt terrible!

Please note:  The video tells you to get approval through your baby's pediatrician to do baby massage before doing it.  My baby's pediatrician said it was a good idea to do baby massage so I tried it.  However, unless you have a pediatrician who is willing to look at all the techniques in the video to approve each one, it's not enough to get the okay to do the baby massage.

Don't get a baby massage video UNLESS it is approved by a pediatrician or the techniques are performed by a pediatrician.  The woman who instructs this video is NOT a pediatrician nor is this video pediatrician approved.  Aimee (the instructor) is just a new-age hippy type person who apparently isn't doing proper massage instruction.  Even if I did the technique wrong, a good instructor would have warned their audience to be careful NOT to do a technique a certain way and to make sure to do it the right (proper) way and how to make sure you are doing it properly.

I am now afraid to do any kind of baby massage which is unfortunate because my daughter is missing out on the incredible physical and developmental benefits.

Like I said, look for a video (or book) by a pediatrician or that is pediatrician approved.

I'm still looking myself...",1219968000,5,1874,4.491124260355029
2747620,5,B000MTFY0K,"Very well prepared and engaging DVD, easy to follow instructions. Highly educational about other aspects of development, as well. Our 4 months old loves looking at all the babies in the movie, that keeps him completely occupied while I'm doing the 4-5 minutes massage routine with him.",1215043200,,285,5.085106382978723
2747621,5,B000MTFY0K,"Finally, there is a massage DVD that is informative and practical for mothers and fathers to use with their babies.  Not only is this tool excellent for bonding, but helps to stimulate the whole infant body system.  As an occupational therapist myself, Aimee's DVD is the guide that we parents need to perform functional, simple and fun activities with our babies to promote health, happiness and wellbeing.  I absolutely love this product and am going to buy it for all my expectant mother friends!  Thanks, Aimee!!",1213833600,,516,4.965116279069767
2747622,4,B000MTFY0K,Great Video for interaction between baby & mom or baby & dad.  I supposedly heard from other parents that it really enhances the development of childhood intelligence but I am not sure if it's true.,1208563200,3,198,4.6571428571428575
2747623,5,B000MTFY0K,"The content on this video is great. The packaging and production look cheap, but the actual examples and content are great. I have bought this for many, many friends when they've had their new babies. It's informative, quick and easy to follow.",1200096000,2,244,4.833333333333333
2747624,5,B000MTFY0K,"this is not a big budget production - but it is very very helpful.  in addition to a very nice massage that i do with my babies every night, there were other great ideas about how to interact with my newborns to help their development.",1185494400,3,235,4.222222222222222
2747625,5,B000MTFY0K,This video is wonderful - very informative and so helpful!  I just gave one to my girlfriend who is a first time mom and she is so grateful - this would make a great shower gift!!!  I highly recommend it!,1172275200,5,204,4.075
2747626,5,B000MTFY0K,"As a first-time parent, this DVD really helped me establish a great nighttime routine with my baby.  I've been doing the massage for 5 months now and I can tell how much it has increased my baby's body awareness.  The DVD shows easy techniques to help you and your baby bond.",1170979200,,275,4.372549019607843
2747627,5,B000MTFY0K,"What a wonderful resource for any parent who wants their kid to be healthier, smarter and happier. I really felt like I was learning advanced lessons that they never used to tell people. I think my kids will be better off and happier for having been properly massaged as babies. I thought the DVD was easy, straight forward and really useful. I couldn't believe all the information that Aimee crams into one DVD! I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who either has kids or knows someone they care about who is about to have kids.",1170892800,4,527,4.557894736842106
8171985,1,B000MTFY0K,Very  poor DVD.  The DVD shows little about baby Massage.,1504483200,,57,4.6
8171986,5,B000MTFY0K,Nice Video...,1475625600,,13,6.0
8171987,2,B000MTFY0K,"We found that these DVD's are too limiting and difficult to learn the first traditional communication and healthy, nurturing touch
for babies.  This ancient tradition, lost in many cultures today, is too important to take lightly.
Even if one has missed it with their parents, everyone can learn well and remember with hands-on instruction
beside us. The strength of our future generations depends on bringing this tradition back. Babies are smarter,
and healthier for the rest of their lives.  Too many misunderstandings with DVDs...I hear parents say it's a 40 min. massage
for a baby instead of 5 - 15 min, or baby is too young or doesn't like it at all or ""it's not for them"" or they don't continue to do
for their babies?  Nurturing touch is how baby's learn respect, trust and care for themselves and others...there is no other substitute for that
60% of learning that touch teaches, words are also too limiting and come along too late...
The future of our human beings is in our hands. Learn now please! Learn with someone who knows how.",1434931200,,1044,4.7569060773480665

8171989,1,B000MTFY0K,"i had added this item to my wishlist for a present for my new baby. today the two of us watched the dvd. it was simply awful. it was no more than 30 minutes, mostly of which Aimmee just babbled. don't get me wrong, they woman gave great information, but the amount of time she actually spends on massage and developmental exercises/ activities is way under par to say the least (10 minutes at the most). i will most likely not use this dvd again as it was simply not useful.",1337126400,,474,4.21978021978022
8171990,5,B000MTFY0K,"I have seen a few different baby massage instructional videos and I truly love this one.  Not only is the instructor very informative, but she demonstrates the different techniques and explains the benefits of each one. I sometimes just use the abdominal strokes on my daughter when she is fussy and these always seem to calm her.  I love massaging her after her bath and having our special bonding time.  I would highly recommend this DVD to all new parents because having a relaxed and happy baby is priceless!",1299110400,,512,4.730337078651686
8171991,4,B000MTFY0K,"The dvd I received was the 'new edition' so running time is only 30 min and information seems quite basic and not that informative. The massage part is very quick but each move is explained. Overall for the money & other reviews, I expected much more. **I contacted seller and they sent the older version to me right away. I prefer the older dvd-longer running time, more informative and detailed. Great customer service-thanks!",1274054400,8,428,4.876712328767123

8171993,5,B000MTFY0K,"As a pediatric OT, I really enjoy giving this gift to anyone who is expecting a child.  It is well done and she explains things in a well thought out manner.  I consider it a ""must have"" for any expecting family.",1249084800,2,212,4.146341463414634
8171994,3,B000MTFY0K,"I bought this product because I was interested in learning more about child development and how it related to baby massage.
