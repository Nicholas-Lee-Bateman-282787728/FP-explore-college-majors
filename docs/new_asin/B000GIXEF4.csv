8132923,5,B000GIXEF4,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie about Cuba. It is an interesting look into its musicality & how Cubans survive on a day to day basis with mostly their music to nourish their souls.,1371340800,,180,4.484848484848484
8132924,5,B000GIXEF4,"If you want to experience more about Latin music and dance, see this film.  However, that is only one part of the story presented here:  Really impressive is the use of black and white film to contrast the socioeconomic, political and racial dynamics of Cuba through it music and dance, while simultaneously capturing the true longings and common humanity of the Cuban people.  I'm not going to go on a rant about our shameful foreign policy, but the U.S. really needs to find a better way to be good neighbors to the people of Cuba, with whom we have much in common!",1180483200,2,567,4.53921568627451
8132925,5,B000GIXEF4,"First rate documentary. Done as a series of slice-of-life episodes, the film shows a variety of sides of Cuba and Cubans. Both the good and the bad.

Your opinion of Cuba will change after seeing this: if your politics dictate that that Cuba is either heaven or hell, you'll have a more rounded view after seeing this.

The music and the musicians are very good as well.

My only complaint - and it's a very small one - is that the nightclub scenes seemed to consist mostly of Cuban hips. Understandable, but still...",1176768000,,517,4.537634408602151
8132926,5,B000GIXEF4,"La Tropical is a fantastic effort by director/photographer David Turnley. This moving doc is about predominantly black Cubans and how their musical lives cross at La Tropical, an outdoor dance hall in Cuba.
I am a big fan of documentary work, this is one film that held me motionless all the way through to the end credits. What touched me most is its sincerity and photojournalistic vigor, the camera work is superb and the story, told mostly in captioned Spanish, is honest and unflinching during those times when biting truths unfold.

My girlfriend had seen this film at the Miami Film Festival when it premiered. I was unable to attend. She spoke so well of this film that I waited over two years to catch it on DVD almost by accident. It has been a long journey to finally see this film but it has lived up to more than I anticipated. Well done.",1160611200,6,851,4.525974025974026
