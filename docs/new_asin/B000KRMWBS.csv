8158960,1,B000KRMWBS,"This is a garbage dvd. The title leads one to believe that there will be some Visual Factory Mgmt and Control examples, case study, application cases, etc.  REAL DATA and information.

Instead all there is a 'Commercial' interview, discussing the EMS product line.  Having people pay $50 for a commercial, with a misleading title is paramount to illegal and certainly unethical.

After recieving, paying and viewing this product, i would suspect anything else that the group Cimware puts out, unless your just looking to listen to someone talk about their product.  Which if thats what your expecting, fine.  But there is little interesting or new infromation on this DVD that one couldn't get from going to the EMS website.",1173744000,7,724,5.042016806722689
