7851117,4,6303507603,"The Cheat is one of Cecil B. deMille's better films. It is about a greedy woman (Fannie Ward) who invests money from a Red Cross charity drive into a company that goes bust. Her husband (Jack Dean) has been working to raise funds for his money-hungry wife, but his investments don't pay off until it is too late for her. She goes to a friend (Sessue Hayakawa) who turns out to be less-than-amicable; he lends her the money under the condition that she become his property. He brands her with his seal, causing her to shoot him. Her husband comes to the rescue and takes the blame for her actions.

Sessue Hayakawa is appropriately sinister and aggressive; he is not likable.

Fannie Ward plays the greedy, innocently pretty wife. She is good at using subtle emotions fit for the movie screen but in times of crisis she gives way to the more stereotypical stage gestures silent films are known for.

Jack Dean is a sweet man, handsome enough and very likable. The audience sympathizes with him.

The print is average. There are plenty of artifacts that could have been fixed. However, the print does not hinder the scenery, especially the gorgeous shots of the Japanese garden.

This film is accompanied by a short called A Girl's Folly. There is no correlation between this short and the subject of The Cheat, but it is highly entertaining. A Girl's Folly is about filmmaking in the late teens. A girl stumbles upon a group making a film and mistakes them for the real thing, freaks out and ruins the film. Then she tries to become an actress. The title cards are fun and accompanied by cute pictures. This film is in better condition than The Cheat, but it has deteriorated a bit over time.",1134086400,4,1691,4.604651162790698
