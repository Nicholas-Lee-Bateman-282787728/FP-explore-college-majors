8104175,1,B000E1OID0,"Grier is an amazing guitarist otherwise why would I have bought this? The tab is notoriously incorrect and leaves out tons of the best stuff David plays.
If you just want to watch him play then perhaps this is a good purchase for you. If you are prepared to copy the music and uploaded to your favorite transcribing software and then go back and forth between and the DVD to see if you have the correct fingering , then by all means have at it.
However, if you really want to learn something without all this fuss, then do yourself a favor and save your money for something else.
Also, David isn't the greatest teacher. He seems high on something.
This looks like one of those deadline jobs that suffers all over the place.",1297814400,,723,4.402985074626866
8104176,5,B000E1OID0,"i have several good instructional videos for guitar: tony rice, doc watson, etc., but this is my favorite. most players can't really describe what they're doing when they're playing, and they can't slow down their music at all. d. grier slows the music down while keeping the content (not an easy thing to do), and explains pull-offs, hammer-ons, slides, etc. as he plays them. there is quite a bit of variety to the music selection (both traditional tunes and some of his original music), in both 4/4 and 3/4 time. there's an excellent tablature booklet that comes with the video. this video has tunes carefully chosen to get you working on your cross-picking.",1213747200,3,661,4.8584070796460175
8104177,3,B000E1OID0,"I purchased this to learn the mechanics of building more intricate guitar lines for bluegrass songs, and I've got to say that as an instructor, David falls a little short in my opinion.

Don't get me wrong, he's a PHENOMENAL picker, and truly somebody to be admired on the guitar... I've even thought about buying some of his CDs!
But, the movie opens with him jamming nicely for a minute, and you're there thinking, ""I can't wait to learn from this guy,"" but then after the song, you're expecting this vivacious, charismatic, charming voice to come out to immediately engage you into the learning process.... But he actually seems more nervous than anything, and possibly (dare I say) a little stoned....

As he tries to explain the different methods of bluegrass soloing, he seems to only want to play his guitar, and not explain the guitar lines for you in full detail... Then he'll say, here let me SLOW THAT DOWN FOR YA..... He'll slow it down for you, but he'll play it differently the second time around...

There's a tab book that's included with the DVD, but it's folded up tightly on the inside cover, making it impossible to keep it open on a music stand for you look at it as you play...

Essentially, what I personally learned from this video, is one basic cross picking technique that's explained as ""up down up down, and that's all you need to know,"" half of a song called ""Bill Cheatham,"" and that bluegrass soloing is really hard to learn from David Grier if he's been smoking...

I'd look for a different video to start learning bluegrass solo mechanics... But might be right for more experienced bluegrass cross pickers/soloists, which I am NOT.... At least, not yet...",1202947200,3,1688,4.6891891891891895
