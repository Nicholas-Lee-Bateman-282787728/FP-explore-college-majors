4903880,5,B005XP60V0,"I was already a fan of David Garrett and I love the music from the Legacy CD, but the DVD is what you would expect if you were going to see an orchestra perform. It's a little dull sometimes (even with David Garrett) and the pace is slow. The DVD also has a documentary on David Garrett and it's really good.  It was interesting to see some insight into the man that creates such wonderful music. That alone makes it worth purchasing the DVD. To really get a feel for his wonderful talent try his David Garrett: Rock Symphonies DVD.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/David-Garrett-Rock-Symphonies/dp/B004BCT2HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">David Garrett: Rock Symphonies</a>&nbsp;3/7/13 update.  I just realized they have this DVD listed as an import that won't work on a US DVD player.  I didn't have any problems with it, it plays just fine.  I didn't notice that when I ordered it.",1349308800,7,923,5.344827586206897
4903881,5,B005XP60V0,"a friend recommended this dvd. sure glad she did, and has the full collection of his work. i had no idea of david's talent. don't usually listen to this type of music, even though i do have some classical cd's. then i purchased david's 'rock symphonies'. was even better and blew me away. spectacular!",1341619200,2,301,4.592592592592593
4903882,5,B005XP60V0,"This is David's latest - there is light classical music from Fritz Kriedler and a Beethoven piece which is excellently played with passion and feeling - it is DAVID, after all. I really enjoyed the ""Playing for my Life"" documentary which offers interviews with David's mother, Dove; Itzhak Perlman, and business promoter types like Costa Pilavachi and also David's manager. It gives us insight into how David's music developed and how he got to this point. It also chronicles some of the challenges David experienced as a child with a gift, parents who very much believed in discipline, and the difficulty of getting people to share his vision. The story reminds me a lot of J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter; she had to go many rounds with publishers before she found one with the courage to publish her story. Imagine a world without Harry Potter! David overcame obstacles (it seems) through the tenacity of his belief in himself and his mission to get people to see music from a different angle. It also gives the viewer a chance to see David as a child, and in different environments - casual and dressy. I recommend this for any David Garrett fan who wants to know more about the man. Great visual and listening stuff.",1336953600,17,1219,4.727699530516432
4903889,5,B005XP60V0,Love anything he does. So talented. This CD is great because you get to watch him perform classical.,1423008000,,100,4.611111111111111

4903891,5,B005XP60V0,"The music sounds modern and great music always elicits an emotional response, transcending time and space.

""Beethoven: Violin Concerto in D, Op. 61"" is multifaceted like a stunning diamond. ""Allegro ma non troppo"" is majestic yet uncomplicated. Well over 3 minutes into the long orchestra introduction after two themes are introduced and developed, the solo violin (hereafter the ""violin"") enters and begins to weave beautiful ornamental variations on the two themes while ascending into upper registers, accompanied by stately grandeur orchestra. The movement ends on a crescendo.

""Larghetto."" The simple, serene Larghetto is tranquil and peaceful, and the ethereal violin sound is simply divine. There is great rapport between the violin and orchestra, complementing and enhancing each other throughout. PAY ATTENTION near the end of Larghetto as the orchestra force darkens and the violin nonchalantly changes tune . . .

""Rondo (Allegro)."" Immediately the violin launches into a happy tune overflowing with joy. Beethoven can be romantic! The cheerful violin has ample opportunities to display virtuosity unaccompanied (a Kreisler cadenza) and be emotionally demonstrative through many beautiful lyrical passages. Finally the orchestra joins the violin to a resounding fortissimo climax.

""Kreisler: Praeludium and Allegro in the style of Pugnani."" Following a loud, compelling opening the ""Praeludium"" continues a highly romanticised saga as the exquisitely accented violin draws out the resonance and vibrancy of each note in sustained long phrases. The fast-paced ""Allegro"" section is serene and poetic, containing an intensely sensual cadenza for solo violin.

""Rachmaninoff: Variation 18 (Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini, Op. 43) arr. Kreisler."" Many of Rochmaninoff's classic pieces are featured on movie soundtrack. This theme induces intense emotions and longing and is the favourite music of the romantic male lead in Somewhere in Time (1980), a sci-fi romance film. Garrett plays the sweeping melody with heightened passion and solid intonation.

""Kreisler: Caprice Viennois, Op. 2."" The multi-movement melody is charming and subtly flirty, alternating between enigmatic, capricious tunes and glissando waltzes radiating warmth and affection, while the violin dazzles with delightful Kreisler mannerisms including quasi-cadenza, seductive harmonics (double stops in waltzes), light portamento, melodic rubato, expressive vibrato, bouncing ricochets and playful pizzicato.

""Kreisler: Variations on a theme of Corelli in the style of Tartini."" The waltzing, serenading violin is certainly in the mood for romance. The emotionally generous, lyrical phrasing makes the lilting Viennese melody even more romantic.

""Kreisler: Romance: Larghetto on a theme by Carl Maria von Weber."" The restrained tender long phrases are filled with love. The flowing legato is sweet, warm-toned yet delicate like a lyrical tenor aria revealing romantic feelings.

""Kreisler: Tambourin Chinois (Chinese Drum), Op. 3"" is a playful pseudo-Chinese folk melody with pseudo-Oriental inflections to display violinists' virtuoso fireworks. The violin plays high speed exotic scales with uninhibited enthusiasm in the first and third sections, bridged by the middle section which sounds mysterious and somehow impressionist, definitely non-Asian.

""Kreisler: Liebesleid (Love's Sorrow)."" The simple, sweet and sorrowful melody has a natural human sobbing rhythm(!). Every time the solo violin glides up, there seems to be a big teardrop. The ending is vibrato-drenched as if tears well up again. The beautiful tune is so evocative that the emotional repercussions linger long after the music stops.

DVD: Playing For My Life
A documentary on the musical journey of The Phenomenal David Garrett. The film features insightful interviews with Garrett, Garrett's mother, prominent violinists/conductors, visionary artist manager, among others; video clips from Garrett's rock-inspired concerts and classical recitals; AND home video clips of an extremely focused, adorable little boy/intense teenager playing very beautiful music on the violin.

Bonus:
Garrett introduces the music by telling back stories in plain English (see booklet) with listening tips and behind-the-scene anecdotes to get listeners ready to experience great music.",1409356800,3,4320,5.91653290529695

4903893,5,B005XP60V0,I love the extra documentary included with this video.  It is great for David Garrett fans and others who want to know about the history and childhood of David Garrett.  Such a wonderful addition to this already awesome video of David's musical talents!!,1402099200,,254,4.883720930232558
4903894,5,B005XP60V0,"David Garrett has done it again.....only more so!  Not only do you get to hear the most beautiful, (in this case), ""classical"" violin music, but you also get to ""Meet The Man"" behind the music, through a wonderfully crafted documentary about his musical career, from age 4 until present time.  David is engaging, intelligent, and a pleasure to listen to during interviews...BUT, you also have the pleasure of hearing from his mother, his teachers, and peers.  ""Clips"" of some of his other concerts, both ""classical"" and ""rock"" are also shown, and all I can say is, ""HE IS A JOY TO WATCH PERFORM!""  If you purchase this DVD, you will NOT be sorry....you WILL BE  recommending it to every one you know!",1401580800,,700,4.704918032786885
4903895,5,B005XP60V0,"I was very interested to know about David Garrett's life, upbringing and training.  I love his music and concerts and he is more than amazing.  This DVD was very, very good.",1390953600,,173,4.548387096774194
4903896,5,B005XP60V0,"Many of us, who are fans of this breathtaking musical genius, have come to appreciate his phenomenal interpretation of  modern and pop song classics, which beside being fun and cool,  provides a window into his own uniquely personal style.

With that in mind, when you have a full concert, of him playing some of the greatest classical music ever written, it helps in recognizing that style, within the structure of music that's been played for generations, such as Beethoven, and Bach.. familiar pieces that we've heard hundreds of times, ourselves, but, new life is endowed into these immortal masterpieces through David.

What is most remarkable, for  me, in ''Legacy'' and about David's choice of pieces, is that he chose works of the masters, as they are interpreted by the next generations of other masters, such as Rachmaninoff's interpretation of Paganini, performed by him 80 years ago, and now played by this generation's  master of the classical world.

  David Garrett, is up there adding to the LEGACY.

Even more profound, is the acknowledgement of how he was mentored and taught by the greatest violinists of our time, like Isaac Stern, and Itsak Perlman, to name a few, so, there is this feeling of  mystical growth, between  classical masters,  who each mentored, reinterpreted  and passed the original flame.

 It is this synergy between them all, from the original composer, to the ensuing generations, which makes these well known pieces, modern and ancient at the same time.

In the Rachmaninoff piece, for instance, it's obvious that based on his style, and how his pieces  are usually structured around piano, Paganini, is interpreted through this additional aspect. Then David interprets the piece, with the piano still prominant, but, not featured,  like nodding back to Paganini's original composition.

David infuses this new spark, and the synergy explodes in hearing some of these works, as if for the first time, and the recognition and awe of how progressive musicians contributed and built on the original foundation. .

 I can't really describe it the way I want, because, this music is understood on an almost spiritual level, more than an intellectual one. But, it's like these dead composers had a presence, and with David's own prodigious tutors, the greatest violinists of the 20th Century, all of them were clearly heard in the final pieces..

Some may be disappointed by this concert, because, it lacks bells and whistles, pyrotechnics, more like rockstar, but, if you close your eyes, and open your mind, you can behold, in your mind's eye, and your mind's ear, this phenomenon stand on the stage, with the phantoms of the greatest composers and musicians who ever lived, up there with him.

He gets a well deserved five stars. He gets a sixth star because  he is gorgeous and very easy, almost mesmerizing to watch for an hour. He modeled while in NYC attending Julliard. This guy's got it all, but, he's worked hard for this gift,  since he was a small boy. He's not just another pretty face.",1389830400,7,3035,4.972222222222222
