5691562,1,B00C6B8LGQ,"A lot of people seem to be confusing this movie with the GOOD 2010 Hulk film starring Edward Norton. One review even stated that he didn't care for Jennifer Coniwhatever and liked the cameo from Stan and Lou. This film has NO cameo from Stan Lee or Lou Ferigno as neither of them wanted anything to do with this. The story is awefull, the way they tell it in comic book for is a pain to watch and the addition of Banners father is just plain madness. Hulk was various sizes throughout the movie way to green and showed WAY to much power all at once. Ang Lee the director even gave a public apology for this movie as it was soo bad. Don't waiste your money!",1377302400,3,656,4.173228346456693
5691563,5,B00C6B8LGQ,"This is a re-written review from July 17, 2003.
I so awaited anxiously for this HULK movie since I heard about it a year ago. Well, it took them a whole hour just for story-telling. Slow-moving story and boring. Jennifer Connelly wasn't interesting to me. All the actors look pale. The color of the film look faded. But the most exciting of this film is the HULK with CGI-effects in raging action. However, some scenes go by so fast you don't get to absorb every frame. Nighttime scenes and underwater scenes are too dark to see what is going on. That's a waste of CGI. The HULK is only seen for a total of 20 to 30 minutes.
  Stan Lee as well as Lou Ferrigno (who played ""The Incredible Hulk"" in the tv series) are in a cameo appearance. It would have been nice to have given Mr. Ferrigno a funny bit to do to remind us of his HULK days. This film is nothing like ""The Incredible Hulk"" tv series (1978-82) that starred Bill Bixby (may he rest in peace) and Lou Ferrigno.  The tv series had emotion.
  I enjoyed the ending of this HULK movie with the hope there will be HULK 2. Now that the story-telling is out of the way, we can move on to more action in HULK 2

  As Lou Ferrigno would probably agree with: Give the Hulk more screen time.

5691564,5,B00C6B8LGQ,"If you're a HULK fanatic, then this steelbook is a great buy for you. The Hulk is my favorite Marvel character and I was glad to bring home his live-action film to add it to my blue ray collection. The movie was great, but they went overboard with the hulk's size and outside the comics a bit. Unlike the regular hulk blue ray movie, this steelbook gives you the ability to watch the film on your phone, computer, tv and even online with Ultraviolet.",1373328000,,450,4.369047619047619
5691565,5,B00C6B8LGQ,"Thiw was an excelent but overly underrated movie.  It had a great deal of excelent amount of depth provided by the actors and writers.  The CGI is not as great as it is today.  But CGI was still in its infancy in those days.  Also a great transfer to bluray.  I must also mention that Universal takes great care in providing options in regaurds to digial copy.  They allow you to access both I-Tunes and Ultraviolet.  I prefer using I tunes.  But here it's not an issue.  You get to use both.  Again, that's a great option.  I wish WB and some of the other studios would do the same.",1373328000,3,583,4.209090909090909
5691566,5,B00C6B8LGQ,"The series of Steelbooks that universal has released called The Reel Heroes are very cool Editons.  They've been released previously in various parts of the world and being a collector have picked up a few in the last year.  These now come with the DVD version as well as the UltraViolet Digital copies for those on the go.  So to any steelbook or just blu-ray movie collector, I would say to pick up these editions, they're pretty awesome.",1372550400,9,440,4.615384615384615
5691567,5,B00C6B8LGQ,"I'm glad this movie is getting star treatment because it's one of the better superhero films to date. Sure, it gets a little too bogged down in the psychology and relationships of the characters and takes itself way too seriously but there's a decent story buried underneath it all. The script wasn't too bad, the storytelling was cohesive, and it had unique way of conveying it's tale. I'd say it also stretched the comfort zone of viewers and really set the tone for what was and wasn't acceptable for comic book films, a necessary stepping stone if you will.

Most people will slag this film for not being true to the source material but this couldn't be further from the truth. It's actually very grounded in the Peter David approach to the character and the film cherry picks ideas and storylines from the comics while adding a modern spin on the origins of the character to make it more ""believable"". My only gripe with how the story and characters were presented laid within the supporting cast of characters which is usually a lot stronger in the Hulk universe and makes for more interesting conflicts.

I would also have to say that for a film in 2003 the Hulk looks visually stunning and the action scenes while poorly paced in spots were visceral and carried weight. The whole fight scene with the Gamma Dogs was great and there's a part where he pops open the jaw of the one dog and proceeds to rip the head apart which had me wincing and that's the kind of innate reaction that people should get. Speaking of which, yes, there are Gamma Dogs in the movie like there are animals endowed with the powers of the Hulk in various stories of the actual comics; but this kind of scenario should be nothing new to people familiar with the character.

Unfortunately, there are serious flaws like most movies and while the film takes on all the visual flair of reading a comic, it doesn't retain all of the actual fun of reading a comic. The other thing it sorely lacks is the wealth of action that's usually packed into the contents of the average Hulk issue. Peter David did a fantastic job of balancing the psychodrama aspects of the character with the adventure that you would expect and that balance is missing here. All in all, it's an interesting film that's certainly worth a watch or two but try to limit your expectations for what the film should be and you might find yourself enjoying the experience.",1369526400,7,2415,4.585648148148148
5691568,5,B00C6B8LGQ,"This was a brainy Hulk and I'm a little biased because my friend the Late Michael France did the story. Ang Lee did a great job of not being caught up in being too much like the TV show ......which was good for its time but, c'mon it had to be updated! And my late friend did a very good job of updating the story........don't judge it next to the TV show because it ain't the TV show.....and never pretended to be.......I liked the cast too....Eric Bana is a very underrated actor and Mr Nolte was good as his father.....enjoy it !

8577648,5,B00C6B8LGQ,"This blu ray is awesome!
I know not a lot of people loved this movie when it came out in 2003, but I was just a kid and my dad took the day off to take me on opening day. I have always loved the Hulk and seeing that movie is one of my favorite memories. So, when I saw this version of the blu ray was on sale for $14 I absolutely had to have it.

A lot of people complain about the CGI in this movie but it was only 2003, and even today I love how the Hulk is portrayed in the film. This is the Hulk that I grew up with and the one I will always remember (of course Lou Ferrigno will always be the only live action Hulk though).

The case is sweet! It does a great job of using the comic style design to make the limited edition that much cooler to have.

All in all, if you are a Hulk fan or just want a sweet blu ray to add to your collection, you can't go wrong with this one.
