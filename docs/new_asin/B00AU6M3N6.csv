8557884,3,B00AU6M3N6,"I was shocked when I found this movie on Prime. I first saw it in a German movie theater in the 1980s. This version looks like someone filmed it right off that screen, cut 30 minutes, and gathered some buddies to dub it. The quality is awful, even though the original movie wasn't that bad. What's lost here (and probably would be lost on an American audience) is the subtext of communist dictatorship -- the committees, the heroic dock workers, the inadequate equipment. In 1973 Romania, at a time when there were shortages of everything, producing this movie would have taken major effort -- maybe the filming even caused Elena Ceausescu to don a pair of shoes and venture out to inspect the set?

Given the poor quality and pretty strange plotline, I can't in good conscience recommend watching this to anyone who isn't interested in traveling back to that time -- there are better ""bad"" disaster movies to waste an hour of your life.",1488240000,,937,4.678787878787879
8557885,3,B00AU6M3N6,"This 1973 Romanian disaster movie is actually quite good. Based on a real incident, exciting and very realistic. However, the bad news is that the transfer is awful. If you are lucky enough to have an old VHS copy, don't bother buying the DVD. The 30-years-old ex-rental VHS looks great in comparison. If you like 1970's disaster movies and haven't seen this one, you really need to get the DVD, even if it looks as a copy of a copied copy.",1481932800,,440,4.444444444444445
8557886,3,B00AU6M3N6,"This could have been a good film with proper equipment and filming. Or maybe it is just a very, very poor transfer. If the film master is still around I would like to see a proper transfer made. It was very hard to enjoy the movie as the picture quality was so bad most of the time.",1438560000,,282,3.9649122807017543
8557887,1,B00AU6M3N6,This has got to be the worlds worst rendition of the Poseidon Adventure. Where did these actors cone from and bad filming. In all Honesty it deserves the Lemon Award and No Stars. That was a waste of my time. Later.,1429574400,,215,4.2682926829268295
8557888,1,B00AU6M3N6,"I only watched the first few minutes but it was enough to show me what a bore this movie was. Blah,",1414713600,,99,3.761904761904762
8557889,1,B00AU6M3N6,"I just checked this movie out as I was curious about the sound issue, I found it had sound...then kind of started to watch...but every aspect of this was just so poor, except the acting which was worse.  If you want to just skip to the best part jump to the 1:19:37 mark (hint, movie is 1:19:36 in length).  Rating of one star as Amazon does not allow zero stars as a option.

Titles look like they were generated by an old VHS cam-corder, lights, props, special effects...if that is what they could be called were childish at best.  The dialog jumped back and forth to what seemed to be a cuts from the beginning of the day when the crew and cast were fresh, to the end of the day of filming when they were just worn out.  Overall the sound just seemed translated and dubbed over where the translation did not fit quite right.

The story, as it says, big freighter catches on fire in a port area and the rest of the film is about the drama on board, on the ships attempting to save the people and later the nearby city, the end of the movie and the ship is in the explosion, where it appears to be some small cherry bombs filmed exploding in a small pond...over and over...the a few close up shots of bad backdrops of what is supposed to be the city and the wind (as in wind machine) rushing through to give the impression of a massive explosion...

Do not even waste your time on this one, even if you are looking for cinematic examples of how not to do a movie, it is just so bad that the bad is not even good enough to use as an example.",1392854400,2,1541,4.133779264214047
8557890,1,B00AU6M3N6,"I didn't believe the first two reviews and found out for myself.
This isn't meant to be a silent movie, so come one Amazon... geeze.",1388620800,2,132,4.32
8557891,1,B00AU6M3N6,"I already knew what I was getting into clicking on this movie, but did not expect no sound. This makes me very sad, I want my money back. :(",1384387200,2,140,3.8620689655172415
8557892,1,B00AU6M3N6,"Would be helpful if the streaming included sound.
I'm sure it had sound when released in theaters.
Picture quality was pretty poor as well.",1378771200,3,139,4.833333333333333
8557893,1,B00AU6M3N6,"It's kind of hard to rate or review a video that has no audio.  I tried on my laptop and I tried on my Kindle Fire HD and got no sound whatsoever.  I even went further into the movie to see if it came on at some point but I didn't hear any.  What part of the video I DID see while trying to find audio looked pretty good but even though I can read lips, it's not something I want to do on a video.  Fix the sound and I'll change my rating.",1375747200,3,439,3.6382978723404253
