8164382,5,B00008G818,Lamb is one of the first films Liam Neeson starred in. He gives a great performance in this intriguing and thought provoking film for it period and subject.  Anthony Hopkins is superb in this spine chilling film.,1388966400,,212,4.72972972972973
8164383,4,B00008G818,"First, I haven't watched ""Arch Of Triumph"" and much as I love Anthony Hopkins I have absolutely no interest in the plot and no desire to see it.
It was strictly a price point that caused me to purchase the two film DVD and if I had found a good price for ""Lamb"" by itself I most certainly would have bought it. Why these two films are grouped together I have no idea because they are day and night apart in plot and premise.

Considering the rarity and lack of distribution on this film the transfer to DVD is fairly good and about the quality of a clean quality VHS tape on a good player. Don't know about ""Arch"" haven't watched.
I'll not give way any spoilers as too many have already done that in earlier reviews; not necessarily on this site.
I ordered the book by Bernard Mac Laverty at the same time as the movie choosing in advance to view the movie prior to reading the book. Having to put in the research due to the rarity of both I was we'll aware of certain plot developments that I would find cumbersome emotionally if I was to dwell on them so I chose to watch the film as new to me, (which it was) and try not to anticipate that which I knew was coming.
 I do hope after reading this you avoid any reviews with spoiler alerts so as to watch the film fresh an unprepared.
You of course will feel the same as all when you watch the pivotal scene but afterwords you may reflect and make allowances for the actions before you but I don't know if forgiveness could be in the cards even if the action was precipitated by no other choice given for the times or moment. This said, I can't say that I agree with the choice made.

You will care about these characters, you will grow to know them in a very short period and though you may root for them you know that this dream of their future can not continue. You may damn the times when this occurred and even though this tale may be fiction all told these places and times were real and most probably crueler than depicted in Lamb so the threat felt was indeed real.

This film is not available for streaming on any legitimate site that I know of but the title, (I found out later) can be bought individually on Amazon US & UK.  I'll review the book at a later date but I'm quite enjoying it each night before I retire I just wish I could read more before dropping off!

I couldn't give this film 5 stars because I couldn't say I loved it, watch it then you'll know why.",1361404800,,2427,4.164179104477612
8164384,3,B00008G818,"This 2 for 1 DVD from Direct Source Label features Lamb with Liam Neeson and Arch of Triumph with Anthony Hopkins.  The print of Lamb is fine--good video and sound quality.  The print of Arch of Triumph is not as good--the color tends toward greens and reds, and the audio is a bit muffled, especially noticeable in the music score.  If you want this product for Lamb, it's a good buy.  If you want a good copy of Arch of Triumph, look elsewhere.  All in all, 1 for 2.",1235952000,5,468,4.213483146067416
