8599252,5,B00DYS7KJ4,This is really a great course for beginners or if you are a little weak on blues theory. Especially helpful on vocal phrasing and the use of the capo in duo type scenarios...I gave it to my grandson and I know it will accelerate his ability to participate in jams and also give him a jump start in improvising. Keep them coming John.,1380931200,,333,4.301587301587301
