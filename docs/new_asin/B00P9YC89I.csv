8687156,4,B00P9YC89I,"This is a movie to experience on a alcohol or hallucinogen or a type of distanced intellectual curiosity. Like 200 Hotels, Oddsac or movies like Trash Humpers, or even the weirder Tim & Eric or PFFR,  this is a film that defies narrative convention and goes for an extremely personal vision. Like those movies/Shows, it seems like it can be hard for some people to tell that it's ""Good"" at what it's trying to do. This work involves a of of irony in both the tonal and technical aspects of filmmaking. If you're not versed in the type of meta detritus of 80s and 90s culture you might be lost...but I personally would rather be confused than bored. The extras are cool, and I'm interested to see what the Collage Fossil folks could do on a higher budget. I think this'll be a cult favorite in a couple years.",1432512000,,808,4.422818791946309

Say what you will, but Im still a fan of the Power Rangers after all these years.  Sure, the show is kinda corny, but they're so much fun to watch, even after all of these different iterations.  So when I first heard about COSPLAY FETISH BATTLE DRONES, I thought, Sure, Ill give it a shot.  Why not?  But I wish now that I hadnt thought to do so.  I spent 90 minutes of my life on this film that Ill never get back.

I can usually find something positive to say about every movie I watch, no matter how horrible it is.  Sometimes the camerawork is pretty good, or the actors do a good job, or even the story itself is decent.  But this film puts me in an awkward spot, because theres not a single plus side to it anywhere.

COSPLAY FETISH BATTLE DRONES looks like it was shot on a low-end 80s VHS camcorder.  Needless to say, the picture quality is terrible.  The sound is ok, but still slightly muted in places.  The lighting is also acceptable, but certainly not good.

The acting is bad and corny, so much so that its painful to watch.  I did not find a single character I could relate to or even like, so the entire cast annoyed me throughout the film.  I knew going into this that each character was a damaged individual, but this group garners neither sympathy nor emotional interest.  In turn, I spent most of the 90 minutes watching the clock instead of watching the film.

The special effects are a joke, and even if they were meant to be cheesy, they fail in that aspect as well.  They simply made me angry.  I get this is a low-budget film, but more effort would have gone a long way.

COSPLAY FETISH BATTLE DRONES is simply an awful movie, all the way around.  At times, I couldn't tell if it was meant to be campy or serious or trying to make a social statement, but it falls way short in all regards.  I would steer clear of this one.",1427760000,2,1922,4.205479452054795

Your eyes and mind are starved for a new perspective, for the perspective that requires new holes to puncture your reality and emboss alien signatures upon your sub-conscious. Shake up your commercially saturated brain with an infusion of alternate messages and be free!",1416614400,,326,5.288461538461538
