4099733,3,B003A12WBQ,"With the leaking of Government secrets headlining every other week, No Way Out is worth re-discovering. Gene Hackman, Sean Young and Kevin Costner deliver solid performances.",1378771200,,174,5.730769230769231
4099734,2,B003A12WBQ,The video of this movie is stretched horizontally so much that even trying to adjust for it by changing the output format of the TV (4x3 or 16x9) doesn't help keep the proper dimensions.  The movie itself is excellent.  I just wish that the video was better.,1371427200,7,258,4.468085106382978
4099735,5,B003A12WBQ,"If you like movies with subplots, suspense, and twists and turns, No Way Out is for you.  I had to watch the movie twice to figure out how some of the actions tied together.  Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman work well together and create a very enjoyable movie.  The supporting actors are also very good in their roles.  The movie is violent but does not show a lot of the graphic violence.  Due to the sexuality, I do not recommend for 14 and under.  Very good movie that leads in many directions and are never quite sure what will happen.",1366761600,,538,4.33
4099736,3,B003A12WBQ,Should be OK. But have not watched it yet. May have an opportunity to watch it in the next few months.,1365552000,,102,3.9047619047619047
4099737,5,B003A12WBQ,I love these movies. Love Gene Hackman as the bad guy. This is a great deal for 2 great movies.,1354320000,4,95,3.8
4099738,5,B003A12WBQ,"I had already seen this movie on TV and liked it.  Still like it on video.  Haven't watched Company Business, in fact failed to notice it was included.  Have to do that! However, I've seldom been disappointed in anything Gene Hackman has done, and Kevin Kostner was very good in this role too.  It was well plotted, a good mystery, and multiple character's study, to the end. Plus, there were not too many characters to study, which I like in a story.  The action present was present, no special effects, which I also appreciate, as well as the fact that the drama was drama, not articially created with music, or screen darkening, swearing, shouting, etc.

I'm referring to the DVD version of the film.",1348963200,8,703,4.629032258064516
4099739,2,B003A12WBQ,"The DVD came to me on time and in good condition. Always seem to have a good business experience when dealing with a purchase from Amazon, and this time was no different.
The viewing of the DVD wasn't what I expected. There were scenes and language,
I felt were not good for anybody, which would have been better left out. I don't recommend these movies, but I do recommend doing business with Amazon.com",1344211200,,404,4.5479452054794525
4099740,5,B003A12WBQ,"Good price too. Thrillers with spies. A glimpse of our Sean Young in No way out. Gene Hackman always good as usual. What's happening with our taxes at the government level if any of this is plausible or even true! Sedate and a bit dated compared to the extreme tempo of the Bourne series, IMHO. But the Bourne series is extreme, too much maybe.",1315526400,8,344,4.390625
4099741,5,B003A12WBQ,"Gene Hackman double feature for a great price.

No Way Out (1987) features Kevin Kostner as U.S. Navy officer hired to work as a personal clandestine spy for U.S. Secretary of Defense played by Gene Hackman.  What the two do not know is that both of them are in love with the same woman...a dispute erupts that transpires into a cover up search for a murderer/Russian spy who is accused of...  Very intriguing and tense plot-line; however, unrealistic.  What I like most about the film is the tension, which reminded me of another film with similar rising tension, namely: Out of Time (2003).  The ending came as a surprise to me...who knew?

Company Business (1991) starting Hackman as a retired CIA-agent called by one of his friends from the agency to handle an exchange between
spies, which goes haywire.  Mikhail Baryshnikov plays the ex-Soviet spy who is to be exchanged...but instead befriends Hackman's character...and the two become fugitives sought after by both CIA and FSB (former KGB).  I really enjoyed the second half of the film, which takes place in Europe, specifically Berlin and Paris.  The sequences shot on the streets of Paris and on top of the Eiffel Tower are the best ones.
Also, I could not help but notice that Mr. Baryshnikov physically resembles a famous West German actor Klaus Kinski...perhaps the former is an illegitimate son of Kinski who was born 22 years before Baryshnikov.",1451865600,,1411,4.894957983193278

4099754,4,B003A12WBQ,"I picked this up for Company Business (I already had a copy of No Way Out). There are plenty of reviews already, but they don't cover the quality of the transfers that well, so I am adding one more.

Both of these are good Gene Hackman movies. No Way Out is an excellent thriller, with a quite unique story. Company Business is good entertainment.

The transfers are mixed quality. Neither has subtitles available. No Way Out is presented in a boxed form - it doesn't fill the screen on the horizontal or the vertical - this is identical to my original MGM copy and thus seems to be no fault of this transfer - it is just the poor quality put out by MGM. Company Business fares better in that it is an anamorphic transfer - it fits the entire screen. These are both old transfers, not digital remasters, but I don't think you can find any better quality on DVD at this point - they'll probably get better treatment for Blu Ray if they make it there.

Bottom line: you're getting transfers of the quality that MGM put out but without any subtitles or extra features (my MGM No Way Out didn't have English subtitles either - only French and Spanish, so this is not a big loss for me). For the price, this is a very good deal - no point in paying more to get the original MGM discs, unless you really want the extra features.",1421539200,4,1322,4.301204819277109
