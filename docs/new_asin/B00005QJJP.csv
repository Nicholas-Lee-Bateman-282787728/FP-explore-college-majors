1648659,2,B00005QJJP,"This 1970s movie version of the Jack London novel deserves at least three stars, but I give it two because this DVD is so poor.

 A recurring problem with inexpensive DVDs is poor quality control. I've had problems with bargin bin DVDs at discount stores, and though I bought this one from Amazon, the low price should have been the tipoff.

 The DVD looks like it was taken from an old 16mm TV print. It's a ""full screen"" version, so part of the credits are cut off. The color is poor. Bright day scenes are sometimes washed out. The nighttime scenes are even worse. The darker colors (night sky, ocean, men's beards, dark clothes) bleed into one another.

 The sound is poor, the music distorted by the soundtrack's age. Obviously, this is no digitially re-mastered film, but what do you expect for under $5?

 Even worse, toward the end of the film, the DVD keeps freezing, continuously, so you can't actually finish watching it. I've had the same problem with the ELIZA'S HOROSCOPE DVD, which I bought in a bargain bin.

 The film itself is pretty good. The tale of a gentleman ca. 1890s who is ""shang-highed"" (not sure about the spelling, but it refers to the then-common practice of kidnapping men to serve as sailors). He finds himself on a seal-hunting ship run by the cruel Captain Wolf Larson. Larson is a Nietzschean figure, who philosophizes that if you can't impose your rights, then they are not rights. Since his weaker crewmen can't overpower him, he has a right to kidnap them.

 Some interesting philosophical debating occurs in this film, as well as some good action sequences.

 I think this may have been a foreign production (Italian?), with dialogue dubbed in. Chuck Connors is an excellent Wolf Larson, and he seems to have dubbed his own voice. About two thirds into the film, he picks up some castaways, including ""Bond girl"" Barbara Bach. Bach did many Italian films before THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, but I'm not sure if she dubbed her own voice (which is odd, since she knows English).

 A reasonably enjoyable film, marred by the poor DVD.",1090540800,19,2063,4.673130193905817
7950741,2,B00005QJJP,"Unfortunately, the poor quality of the recording made it impossible for me to watch more than 1/4 of this. The colors are all faded. The sound doesn't sync with the video, and you can hear the bad sound recording in the wavering of the music track.",1515628800,,248,4.413043478260869
7950742,3,B00005QJJP,"interestingly presented ...  it is almost impossible to do justice to any book via movie, it is particularly difficult for this excellent book.  Recommend.",1459209600,,155,5.416666666666667
7950743,3,B00005QJJP,Good story plot.  Background music doesn't seem to line up with the story or scenes.,1419811200,,84,4.6

7950746,4,B00005QJJP,This is a pretty good version of the classice! Chuck Connors does a great job stepping into Edward G.Robinson's role! This one is a bit different but if you are a Fan of Chuck as I am...you will enjoy it!,1411344000,,204,4.125

7950748,3,B00005QJJP,"If you saw the classic 1941 version of The Sea Wolf, starring Edward G. Robinson, John Garfield and Ida Lupino, you may well be disappointed by this inferior film. Chuck Connors as the fearsome and sadistic Wolf Larson doesn't quite have the depth or dramatic chops to bring it off. The production is an early 70s Italian one, cut from the same cloth as the Spaghetti Westerns of that era (the director, Giussepe Vari made quite a few of those in the 60s and 70s). The colors here look faded and dark shots appear blurry. The music is so bad as to sound campy. Despite these flaws, the movie does stay much closer to London's novel than the 1941 version. If fidelity to the original story is important to you then it might be worth watching. Although there were some alterations, as mentioned by a previous reviewer, they were few in comparison to the 1941 version, which in my view works far better than this, changes or no. At any rate, I watched this relatively faithful version with some interest on Amazon Prime for free. It has its moments. But I wouldn't go out of my way to see it, especially in light of the much more powerful 1941 Hollywood version which shouldn't be too hard to find.",1396569600,,1195,4.486238532110092
7950749,3,B00005QJJP,Chuck wasn't always a top notch actor. This was an opportunity for him to stand up and put out. He played his rifleman role. He didn't try to stretch himself. The reluctant kidnapped gentleman played a better role.,1390089600,,214,4.657894736842105
7950750,3,B00005QJJP,"The movie was OK but definately not as good as the book. The opening and ending of the movie have been changed from the book which I assume to help fit into the typical movie length. To me the opening change was OK but the ending removed a significant part of the story line and left the girl's character completely undeveloped. She is a significant part of the story but for the purpose of the movie as it was done it would have been better to leave her our.  A lot of key points/ from the book are included in the movie but without the ending as written, those moments lose the effect of building all the characters. I would think that without having read the book I would have been scratching my head as to what the meaning was of some key moments.  I think the actoring and  were fine but with the dialogue cut up the way it was, critical statements just seemed out of place.",1389916800,2,879,4.220238095238095
