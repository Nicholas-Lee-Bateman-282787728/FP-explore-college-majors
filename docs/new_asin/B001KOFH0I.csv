3667281,5,B001KOFH0I,I saw this movie on Netflix and I watched it a lot and when the took it off it mad but I got it here for a good price so I can watch any time.,1359504000,,142,3.085714285714286
3667282,4,B001KOFH0I,"I love Asian movies, and this one is no exception. We start off with some thugs robbing a store in bunny suits. No one takes them seriously until one fires a shot. Next thing, there are people screaming and running, and the cops show up, and bullets are flying everywhere. The robbers who make it away are too stupid to drive and end up crashing into a building where an innocent young biker is resting. They take him as a hostage and run out back, wondering why the cops aren't chasing them anymore. They board a train, and upon noticing that all the passengers appear to be quite wealthy, decide to rob it. It's not easy to rob ghosts, though ... The leader always shoving his gun into his friends' faces gets annoying, and the gay guy adds comedic relief. One of those B movies that I like enough to add to my collection and brag about.",1328918400,5,839,4.350318471337579
3667283,4,B001KOFH0I,"Since there is no product description for this movie, I decided to list the cover info for those interested in buying it:

After committing a robbery and evading police, five teenagers find an empty train and decide to wait out a search by the authorities. Little do they realize that the train is actually inhabited by ghosts on their way to final judgment. And these ghosts intend to take the five passengers with them.....

The movie isn't top notch entertainment but it does have an interesting premise and some over-the-top acting, which makes for some funny scenes. But it also does have a sense of foreboding and creepiness and a couple of twists to keep things moving along nicely. It is in Thai with English sub-titles and runs 91 minutes long.",1273968000,11,753,4.740458015267175

3667287,4,B001KOFH0I,"Intriguing film, interesting from beginning to end. The title should have been translated as something like ""Train of Souls"" to avoid giving the impression it might be about zombies. The English subtitles were clumsily translated. Those are my main reasons for knocking one star off the rating. The story held my attention. I found the characters all interesting, and the acting was very good. I keep looking for a good ghost movie but have a lot of trouble finding one that does something different, so I was very pleased to discover this film.",1466726400,4,545,4.870967741935484
3667288,1,B001KOFH0I,It was just trash the whole way through. My kids could have made a better movie.,1466553600,,80,4.0625
3667289,1,B001KOFH0I,This is not a zombie movie it is a ghost movie and a very poor one at that. On top of it they stole cover art from the video game Dead Rising 3.. Isn't that copyright infringement?,1466208000,8,180,3.891891891891892

8315590,2,B001KOFH0I,"This movie was hilariously awful with the most obnoxiously annoying and unlikeable characters imaginable.  It also boggles the mind why they would show footage of a real train at times, and then show horrific CGI of a train from 1989.  All this being said, it was still entertaining as a silly film.",1503619200,,299,4.730769230769231
8315591,2,B001KOFH0I,"It would have been better for me in English. I don't know ahead of time that these are Asian movies until you get into them. By that time, credits have gone by, time wasted... La di da... LOL Anyways, when I see it has subtitles, I then have to sit down and read while watching which most of the time I'm doing something else while watching... pain in the patinkas!

So, interesting, funny, odd, serious characters... the full range. Seemed like it would have been a good movie... if I didn't have to read it at the same time. You miss out on facial expressions and acting when you have to read. Seemed like it would be an interesting movie if JUST a little illogical at the end. Someone else mentioned the whole, Why was girl not able to cross over, not her time, and all, but her body was destroyed, but, what, she didn't believe it?

I don't know. I think that just messed it up for me. I think the translation of the subtitles messed that up so it just took a little of the satisfaction of the ending away from me... ;(",1501459200,,1023,4.241025641025641
8315592,1,B001KOFH0I,"I did not like the deception of a man that thinks he is a woman trapped in a man's body,but how else are you spose to ruin a movie,are show?Another illogical scene set up. Savika Chaiyadej as Rahtree does a good job of acting like all the others. Rahtree says""It's not my time yet,but my body has already been destroyed.(So it is her time?)So I can't get back to my body.(She can't get back to her body because her body is destroyed?She does not have a physical body anymore?)I have to wait with the train of souls until my time comes.(When her body was destroyed?Her time came already?Why didn't she depart with the other souls if her body was destroyed already?Because destroyed is no more there?)See refrence in the movie to her palm,and the male hostage's palm about the train of souls train ticket guy?I see what another says?Why call it the train of the Dead?Seeing as the people(Ghosts already died?)Zombies already died once,but in the movies they can die again,but hm?",1494028800,,977,4.686046511627907
8315593,3,B001KOFH0I,"2.5 stars.  This movie had misleading cover-art and poor translation.  Apart from that, it was so-so in entertainment quality.  The ending was a bit choppy.",1492905600,,156,5.16
8315594,2,B001KOFH0I,"First, the cover at is misleading. This is not a zombie movie, it is a ghost story. And not a great one. Some will be turned off by the subtitles but that is not bad.",1483747200,,166,3.7714285714285714
8315595,2,B001KOFH0I,"It was interesting to say the least. I could see the potential in the creative process. Work on the dialogue a little, and it could be better. Still, entertaining is what I will call it.",1481500800,,186,4.3428571428571425
