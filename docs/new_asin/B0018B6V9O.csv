T&B was copied from an airing on cable channel Black Starz. The logo pops up in the lower right hand corner of the film. Once again the picture quality is subpar.

3414708,2,B0018B6V9O,"had to have this classic movie as part of my collection. Plus this is one I actually missed growing up so I wanted to see it. Not a great film but a pretty good story for it's time.

As others have stated: This movie, although in wrapped packaging, was record for TV to VHS then recorded to DVD. Now imagine that spread across 65"", it was painful to watch. Even my upgrade everything system could not improve on the picture or sound quality of this movie. Hopefully the studios will see the interest in this era of movies and re-release versions form their master copies. (Please)!",1411430400,4,581,4.481132075471698

I just remembered the theme song which I loved!  If you want to watch something low-key with minor violence and light comedy, please add to your collection.  It was good to see Vonetta McGee and Max Julien in a non-blaxploitation film.  Basically, it's the ""diversity"" version of Bonnie and Clyde!",1318377600,,428,4.72972972972973

Anyway, it was a nice slice of the western genre, which more black actors seemed to lean towards in the 70s.  If you enjoyed such flicks as ""Buck & the Preacher"" and ""Adios Amigo,"" you'll dig this.",1315785600,4,433,4.308641975308642

This can't end well.

I was so disappointed with the quality of the print that I repurchased a another copy from Warner Archives and I am extremely pleased.  It is an official copy so the print is very clear.  I watched it on a 55"" LED and a 32"" LCD and the picture and sound are great.

Good Movie But Do Not Purchase Copy from Blax Films - Horrible Picture Quality

I love this movie so when I saw it listed on Amazon I was very excited.  It's a little dated but I love it anyway.

Anyway, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this movie.  It is the quality of a bootleg DVD.  While watching the movie the Black Starz logo appears in the lower right corner of the screen.  This makes me question the legitimacy of this DVD.",1294012800,18,814,4.476190476190476
3414725,5,B0018B6V9O,"Before there was,Bonnie and Clyde, there was a dynamic dual of the dying west moving up in the banking business.  You can discern a little Robin Hood in the characters, as the dual take from the rich and give to the poor.  One of the best movies by Max Julian (The Mack) with Vonetta mcGee.  They're like a doubled barrel shotgun smoking after a big blast.  This is a hot film, an collectors item especially for the blaxploitation genre.",1276041600,,437,4.493670886075949
