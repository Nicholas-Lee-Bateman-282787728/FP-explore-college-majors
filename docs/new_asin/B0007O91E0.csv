8049434,5,B0007O91E0,"I just received the video and watched it for the first time.  I am very impressed.  The stretching sequence is very thorough.  I recognized maybe 3 of the stretches.  The others I have not seen before.  The description says that the video was created in 1986 (Pre-DVD).  I was expecting a poor quality video, but was hoping for the best.  The quality is pretty good, not DVD quality, but good nonetheless.  Master Shum's instruction is VERY good.  I am impressed with his teaching ability.  He shows the moves several times from all angles and then shows what NOT to do.  Common mistakes and the like.  He also uses other parts of the body for cross-reference to insure that the body part that he is working with is in the proper position.  For example, the knee should be above the toe and parallel.

I should add that the DVD has chapters at each new subject except for a couple.  Nice to be able to move back and forth to the section that needs work.  Here are the contents of the video:
