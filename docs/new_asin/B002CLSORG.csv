8364259,5,B002CLSORG,"Dragon Ball Kai vol. 1 on DVD was released in Japan on September 17, 2009 which makes this the very first Dragon Ball Z Kai DVD in existence.
The first volume contains the first three episodes in 16:9 Widescreen with Kenji Yamamoto music, as it's part of Season 1 or Saiyan/Vegeta Saga.

There's flashback story about Goku from Bardock The Father of Goku to his recap of Dragon Ball adventures over the years. Then the Z begins again.

It's so good you get to watch Dragon Ball Z Kai the way it was originally meant to be....manga-wise. However, DVDs have its limits and so does Blu Ray production limits. It would've been cool to have 16:9 footage Dragon Ball Z Kai on Blu Ray, but production authoring would come at a higher price behind the scenes which ended up being 4:3 on 1080p that would later persist to all Funimation releases in the last 6 years today.",1441238400,,863,4.490445859872612
