The English subtitles were good too.. only a few weird lines, but in saying that, I can't speak Japanese so I can't say if it translated right or not! Otherwise, all ok. It came in nice packaging too. :)",1285804800,,314,4.431034482758621
8345417,5,B001V0WTK2,"The subtitles for this movie are excellent compared to most Japanese drama and movie translations that I have encountered.  The word ""fianc"" is missing the ""e"" every now and then, but other than that, everything is great.  I would definitely recommend this product!  Thank you!",1264896000,,277,5.111111111111111
8345418,5,B001V0WTK2,"This is a brilliant movie, very entertaining, very romantic, very funny and Jun Matsumoto is simply brilliant and incredibly gorgeous as Tsukasa Domyoji! Mao Inoue does a great job as Tsukushi Makino too, very true to the manga character. It's not hard to see why both of these received awards for their acting.
I loved the drama series to bits and really got my hopes up for this movie and was definitely not disappointed! The second half of the movie, in particular was amazing and very romantic leading up to an incredible ending! Even the credits were superb with ""One Love"" by Arashi (the band that Jun Matsumoto is a member of) being a perfect choice for the movie's theme song.
The plot is simple: Domyoji and Makino are getting married. Makino receives ""The Smile Of Venus"", a tiara which has been worn by every woman entering into the Domyoji family for decades. However, when the couple are in their hotel room, a thief breaks in and steals the precious heirloom. Although Domyoji chases after him, the thief gets away and when the two return to the room, the window has been repaired, the staff appear oblivious and nobody believes what happened. They soon realize that nobody can be trusted and embark on a mission to get the tiara back, while keeping a low profile (something Domyoji has a hard time doing). Basically, it's simple, if they don't get the tiara back, then the wedding isn't happening! Throughout their journey, they face things which will seriously test their relationship and make them question whether getting married is really the right thing to do.
The story may seem really cliche and corny and honestly, i thought that too, but it's not as bad as it sounds. It just really is very sweet and entertaining so i would highly recommend it to all HanaDan or Matsujun fans!

Also, people may be wondering about the English subtitles. Well, i bought from Diamond0705, who is a very good person to do business with. The DVD had excellent English subtitles which could be turned on or off depending on your preference!
So overall, i would highly recommend Hana Yori Dango Final!",1249516800,,2103,4.745901639344262
8345419,5,B001V0WTK2,"Yes, the plot was kind of cliche, but it was great. I througouly enjoyed it. Especially the end. The acting was great, and the characters, well, stayed true to their characters (unlike how some other sequels/movies totally make the characters cheesy). It's a must buy, and for a cheap price too!",1242518400,4,295,4.803921568627451
