8754965,4,B01D5MPOZU,"Dina (Karen Malina White) is a single mom and not the best one. After spending a night at a bar, waking up without her pants, she goes home to find social services has been called. After losing that battle, her child Star(Sasha Matthews) lives with Miss Linda (Lyne Odums). At mommy counseling, Dina must attend group classes with Leshawna (Terry Dexter) who happens to be the wife of her boyfriend.

With Star being a ""selective mute"" it isn't difficult to guess the real issue.

The film is based on a ""true story"" and treats a delicate subject respectfully. For ""Lifetime"" film type fans, this one would be in your wheelhouse.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.  3 1/2 STARS",1466812800,3,676,4.65546218487395
