5092600,5,B007K7IC9M,Bryan is the man,1405900800,,16,3.25
5092601,5,B007K7IC9M,Original material and very very funny. Nice call backs and Bryan paints the story in your mind as to be part of each skit.,1391299200,,122,4.125
5092602,5,B007K7IC9M,"Bryan Callen is hilarious in his ""Man Class"" stand-up.  If you want to know what it really takes to be a man...WATCH THIS!  LOL",1374278400,,127,4.25
5092603,5,B007K7IC9M,"I have recommended this video to everyone I know, and it's truly a comedy-lovers dream to watch. He's funny, and the vulgarity is minimal, so it's just good fun.",1364774400,,161,4.586206896551724
5092604,3,B007K7IC9M,Bryan Callen is a very funny comedian and capable of much better than this. There are some laughs but the set doesn't flow and gets side-tracked by physical gags. Worth watching if you are a fan but probably won't convince you to buy his next special if you are not.,1355097600,4,266,4.34
5092605,5,B007K7IC9M,This is so funny!  I've shared it with many of my friends and most of them have then bought it.,1351641600,,95,3.75
5092606,5,B007K7IC9M,"Great comedy DVD. Had the pleasure of seeing Bryan Callen twice & this DVD combined both acts together. For me it wasn't new material, but it cracked me up so much the first time I watched it that I needed to see it again. This DVD also gave me a chance to show friends that didn't go to the show, what they missed. Its like watching him at a small comedy club.",1350345600,,361,4.027777777777778
5092607,5,B007K7IC9M,Watched this during finals week which was a very stressful time and this had me laughing the whole time and really relaxed me.  The man is histerical and I can't wait to watch again with anybody I can recruit.,1340409600,,209,4.358974358974359
8518737,5,B007K7IC9M,Worth it. Every penny.,1529193600,,22,4.75
8518738,5,B007K7IC9M,"Absolutely my favorite special, loved it will watch it again",1521331200,,60,5.1
8518739,5,B007K7IC9M,The best comedian out there. I can't ever stop watching and he is hilarious. A must see for all!,1517443200,,96,4.105263157894737
8518740,5,B007K7IC9M,"This is one of the funniest specials I have seen in a while.  He is a guy you have to watch and not just listen to because he is so physical.  All of his movements just add to the hilarity of his stories.  I also love how he re-uses material from other parts of his act, like eating peaches and a guy's hairdo in the audience.  I have seriously watched this video ten times and it is every bit as funny each time.  I'm a big fan of physical comedians and this guy has that aspect down pat.  He's incredibly talented in that aspect.",1516579200,,531,4.0576923076923075
8518741,5,B007K7IC9M,My employee hounded me about watching this for months and months. I finally gave in and I hated myself  for waiting so long! Ive watched it at least 7 times and finally bought it. Most hysterical comedy special ever!!,1515369600,,217,4.564102564102564
8518742,5,B007K7IC9M,"If you don't think this is hysterical, you're an uptight person, and you're too self conscious. The stories and accents combined with his wonderful body control is first rate..I've had parties and put this on. People pee in they're pants.. Also saw him live, and got to meet. Warm, approachable guy. Highest recommendation.",1504396800,,323,5.113207547169812
8518743,5,B007K7IC9M,Loved it! Great material and a lot of laughs!,1494460800,,45,4.111111111111111
8518744,5,B007K7IC9M,"Very, Very Funny ! I highly recommend this DVD if you want lots of laughs",1482796800,,73,3.933333333333333
8518745,1,B007K7IC9M,"This is stand-up for a very narrow audience. I lost interest and watched the second half a week later.  Although it has one or two bright spots, there are just three types of jokes: odd physical comedy with a lot of acted out scenarios, yes I am - no I'm not statements, usually about some kind of same-sex desires, and random characters with mediocre (but apparently crucial) accents.  I don't think this is worth the $10, unless you're already a fan of his work.",1460419200,,464,4.511904761904762
8518746,5,B007K7IC9M,The funniest CD I have the pleasure of owning. Bryan Callen is HYSTERICAL!!!  Love him.,1447113600,,87,4.8
