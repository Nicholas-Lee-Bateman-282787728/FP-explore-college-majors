8192107,1,B000PKJ4PM,"I purchased the download version of this video, and it is pretty much worthless.  I am very familiar with most DAW's and, in general, the computer-based music environment.  After watching this video, about the only thing I got from it were the names of a bunch of products they were using.  The ""info"" the video provides could be found by going to the software manufacturer's website and watching an intro video about it, or just reading the features on the product page.

When I emailed their support on the website to let them know that the content was obsolete and that I would appreciate a refund, I got a one line response of ""See the website for the return policy"".  Since I did the download version, they apparently don't stand behind it.

I would run away from this product, if you're considering it.  It's probably the most worthless info product I have ever purchased.",1238025600,,878,4.662337662337662
