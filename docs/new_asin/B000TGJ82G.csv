in re-runs I have to say, there should not been a ninth season.
Everything was thrown out of whack
Really dumb stories character re-writen history
the adoption really , really idiotic,. For Carries
character, wanting to adopt a child,? she hated kids for most
for entire series. In the real world she would not make good
mother nor doug a good father. He probably leave the baby
on top of the car, going to pizza hut.
If you love King Of Queens
I would ignore the last season

2897402,4,B000TGJ82G,"I've been a big KofQ fan ever since the series started and thought that this was a pretty good end to it. In and of itself, it was a good season, but compared to the others, I didn't think it was quite as good. Some of the storylines were a little forced and it seemed like they were sort of forcing us along to the end, but even so, it was still enjoyable. I'm just sorry that the series had to end.",1244592000,,400,3.8902439024390243
2897403,5,B000TGJ82G,"My husband and I have the entire collection of The King of Queens. We have literally watched them each at least a dozen times. Every time we watch an episode it is funnier.

2897406,5,B000TGJ82G,"The only thing that is disapointing about this last season is that there's only 12 episodes. I think that was due to Kevin James filming Chuck and Larry at the time. He should have stuck with the show though instead of making a movie with Adam Sandler who makes crap in my opinion. Besides this show is funnier than any movie Sandler has ever made.

  All the episodes in this season are worthy last episodes of the series. I mean, no matter how many  times I watch the episode where Doug buys an Ice Cream truck it still makes me laugh. The one where Doug goes Vegetarian is hilarious as well. The last few episodes pack both drama and laughs since Doug isn't sure if he wants to be married to Carrie any more. However, watching Doug get drunk due to that is probably the funniest work Kevin James has ever done. Besides the shortage of episodes, the only other disapointing thing is that the show is over. The end is a worthy ending but it made me want to see more anyway.",1210464000,8,974,4.306010928961749
2897407,5,B000TGJ82G,"I first started watching this sitcom on the recommendation of my husband.  He said he was hooked on it so every day after work, I would sit down and watch the reruns of this sitcom.  I totally agreed with my husband.  Now, we watch the reruns over and over, and probably know the dialogue by heart, but it still makes us laugh.  I feel it was an underrated show, much better than RAYMOND. Kevin James is absolutley the funniest guy around, along with the cast of Leah Remini and Jerry Stiller to round off a PERFECT cast. Also,the supporting cast was great...Deacon,Danny,and of course SPENCE!!!!  The last year was not the best for the KoQ,the writing was not all that great but we grew to love and look forward to seeing this crazy but lovable family and friends.  It will be sorely missed!!!
