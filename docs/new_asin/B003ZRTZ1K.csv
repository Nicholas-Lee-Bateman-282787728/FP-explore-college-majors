8410746,1,B003ZRTZ1K,"The writer/director was so proud of the fact they only spent $2000.00 making this film. That is really impressive, but it still looked like a $2000.00 movie.",1340841600,,157,4.851851851851852
8410747,3,B003ZRTZ1K,"Nephilim/Bipolar Something=First of all if you must see this, watch the bonus part before anything else, this is the only actual discussion of Nephilim by Neil Johnson maker of this sordid production, he also explains the low budget and his cameos thruout movies, neither movie is like Sci-Fi or Biblical drama. Like I wrote see Neil Johnson in bonus-you get it then. Did not care for Battle Planet which Johnson also made. The model spaceships parts are the only eye catching events. Always curious about who and what the Nephilium in the Bible were/are. This did not give me any explanation whatsoever theatrically, more like a low budget monster-slasher movie. Yes I watched both movies.",1303603200,5,690,5.008695652173913
