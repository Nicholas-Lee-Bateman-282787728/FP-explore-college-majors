8112886,4,B000EQ47SG,"As a die-hard Astros fan, this DVD was greatly enjoyable. Any fan will great enjoy this walk down memory lane. The only major admission is the Bagwell walk-off hit against Milwaukee in September. Also, it would have been nice to have more extras. However, any Astro fan will enjoy this DVD.",1330300800,,290,4.705882352941177

8112888,5,B000EQ47SG,"As a lifelong Astros fan and someone who followed the 2005 season very closely, I can say that this DVD does a great job capturing the abysmal start, miraculous finish, and dramatic playoff run that the team went on.  What a roller coaster!  This DVD is an absolute must-have for any Astros fan.",1200787200,,295,4.547169811320755
8112889,5,B000EQ47SG,"I cannot actually give a review of this product since I purchased it as a gift for friends; however,I am giving it a 5 because I know my friends will love it. The family lives in Texas and are mega Astros fans; they never miss Astros games during the baseball season. If they could, they would have them playing 365 days a year. I am a die hard Red Sox fan and was ecstatic when they won the 2004 World Series. I imagine my friends felt the same when the Astros took home the 2005 pennant.

8112890,5,B000EQ47SG,"I'll admit that I am first and foremost a Chicago White Sox fan, but I figured why not check out this DVD offering and get a look at the Houston Astros' 2005 season, as well as the World Series from a different perspective, and I'm glad I did!  All in all this is a thoroughly enjoyable presentation of the Astros' rollercoaster ride of a season, covering an early 15-30 record which caused them to be written off by just about everyone (including the Houston Chronicle, which printed a full-page ""obituary"" for the 2005 Astros season), their torrid play in the second half of the season, a memorable game pitched by Roger Clemens following his mother's passing, the stretch run in late September where they ultimately clinched the wild card on the final day of the regular season, and their exciting run through the playoffs.  No shortage of drama either, including Chris Burke's memorable game-ending home run in the bottom of the 18th inning to get the Astros over the first hurdle, the battle vs. the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS where they rebounded from Albert Pujols' stunning home run off Brad Lidge in Game 5 by winning the NL pennant the next game in St. Louis.  Also plenty of World Series coverage here, and again it was interesting to compare and contrast with the White Sox DVD.  There are lots of insightful player, coach and manager interviews here, narration by Dennis Quaid, another great musical score, plentiful use of players' wireless microphones and some really cool bonus features as well (great to see full innings among the bonus highlights).  Overall this DVD is a worthy keepsake commemorating the Astros' first NL Championship season that Astros fans (and baseball fans in general) are sure to enjoy.",1151539200,7,1732,4.837837837837838
8112891,4,B000EQ47SG,"This is rather nice production, utilizing some footage that was (probably) shot during the playoffs for a World Series DVD if in fact the Astros had won the Series.  I imagine some of the interviews occured after the whole thing was over.

Anyway, my main complaint would be the lack of unedited moments - most of the big hits or outs are montaged together with shots of the crowds and of interviews with players or coaches or what not.  Fortunately the dvd ""extras"" include the wins of Game 4 of the NLDS and Game 6 of the NLCS with the Astros radio as the audio... so that's nice.  I'd still like to have footage of Berkman's homer in Game 5 of the NLCS (even if the Astros ultimately lost that game, <sigh>), which to me is the most memorable moment of the series... err, most memorable positive moment anyawy.  They certainly show the homerun, but it's spliced in with a lot of other stuff.

And a big omission is Bagwell's game winning hit on September 16.  Pitch-hit, hollywood-type ending.  It should really be on the DVD.  Ok, it's on the main title screen montage but that's it.  It'd be nice if it was in the main program.",1144195200,6,1132,4.42512077294686
