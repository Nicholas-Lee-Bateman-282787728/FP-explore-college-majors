8548888,3,B00AA2GO6C,"Why does one buy a DVD of someone playing piano sonatas? At least in my case it's because you want to see the person actually playing the sonatas. That is, you want to see hands on the keyboard. You don't get enough of that on this DVD. Maybe a third of the time you see his hands on the keyboard. There are a lot of long shots of his mostly expressionless face and far away shots from across the room of him sitting at the keyboard. As an example he plays the entire first movement of the Pathetique sonata without them even once showing the keyboard. The Buchbinder DVDs are much better at showing the hands and keyboard.",1524441600,,623,4.288135593220339

The new 2014 re-issue of the Metropolitan Munich DVD set, previously issued as separate discs in 2013, now includes the important bonus film/interview from 2012 in which Barenboim explains in detail the concepts lying behind this entire presentation. This bonus film was previously only available on the Blu-ray set. The new re-issued DVD set therefore offers significantly more material on fewer discs and at a lower cost. It is therefore much better value than before and a closer match to the excellent, but more expensive, Blu-ray set.

The detailed review of the complete 2014 re-issued set can be read under the 2014 re-issue heading and replaces the previous review under this heading",1359331200,,700,5.185840707964601
