3646454,4,B001I2L84Q,"This DVD, I had to admit, at first I thought it was not going to be what I needed.  I have tons of books; on Poodle grooming as well as Shih Tzu.  Have been doing the poodles since I was 16--Shih-Tzu for the last 3 years, mostly on my own, trying it with the books.  I was having trouble with the faces.  But this lady gives you  thorough, step by step instructions through the whole process.  After watching this a couple of times, now I am confident that I can do this. Thanks, this DVD has been very helpful to me!",1280534400,15,517,4.069306930693069
3646455,2,B001I2L84Q,"A bit disapointed by the DVD content : I was looking for Shih Tzu competition grooming and that's not what this DVD is about.
A Shih Tzu recovered from RSPCA, in poor condition, is groomed.",1273708800,2,189,4.428571428571429
3646456,5,B001I2L84Q,I really liked this video on grooming alot!  She went over the tools and how you use them and also showed scissoring as well as using clippers.  Seemed pretty thorough to me.  Great as a reference video if you forget something along the way!  I say it's well worth the money.,1261008000,19,275,4.333333333333333
3646457,5,B001I2L84Q,"I bought this video because the description promised I'd see a shih tzu groomed, not a beagle or a poodle.  I learn better by seeing/doing than by reading a book.  Books make grooming seem alternately impossibly difficult and absurdly easy.  Well, our Shih Tzu puppy and I watched and learned as Lena groomed Popcorn, step by step.  Our puppy responded to every ""good girl"" Popcorn earned--but didn't quite learn Popcorn's calm in the face of clippers and shampoo. The DVD is like taking a grooming class, only better because I can review any part of the grooming process when I want to--just click and hop to equipment or bathing or teeth or ears or nails or clipping (from hair long to hair gone).  Lena grooms Popcorn in a home using the same equipment that's at hand for me--sink, sprayer, table.  Lena anticipates questions and gives tips about what to do when the grooming process stresses your pup.  And by watching I learned what I can try now--teeth, nails, bath/conditioning, face and paw trims and top knot--and what I'll need to leave to a groomer until I have more confidence and a calmer puppy.  Thanks, Lena!",1254009600,32,1123,4.723076923076923
3646458,5,B001I2L84Q,"This is just what I needed to learn how to trip my three shih tzus.  I can't take them to a pet shop for every trim, and this shows me how to keep them neat.  Saves lots of money.",1374624000,,179,3.5641025641025643

3646460,4,B001I2L84Q,"I bought this DVD because I have two shih Tzu's and it's getting costly to get them groomed.  Since I'm a license hair dresser I figured that maybe I can do it myself.  The DVD is great for beginners.  I wished she would focus more on the face, but it's very informative.  I learned things that I didn't know.  I recommend it.",1371513600,2,326,4.193548387096774

3646462,5,B001I2L84Q,"Excellent video! For the price even if you only got one tip fromit it would be worth it. EVERTHING is covered! The video is long but it goes through the entire process of grooming. I also like  that the dog she groomed wasn't always cooperative, easier to groom a calm dog!  I do agree with the other post that her finished puppy didn't look hot, face didn't match the body!",1363910400,8,374,4.328571428571428

3646464,5,B001I2L84Q,"This is a great video.  It gave me the knowledge and the courage to start grooming my shih tzu myself.  The trainer is very easy to understand and follow.  She also goes through the list of grooming tools you will need.  I had already bought tools I did not need.  Another bonus-you will able to grade the groomers, if you continue to have someone groom your dog. You will know what they are supposed to do.",1339027200,4,407,4.302631578947368

8310389,4,B001I2L84Q,"I ordered this dvd wasn't quite sure when I first started to watch, but as it progressed I was surprised how much there is to learn about grooming your dog.  She explained and shows how important it is to do the sanitary cut and to remove the hair inside the dogs ears. I would recommend you watch parts of this dvd in sessions. 90 minutes is too long for one sitting. Worth the money glad I purchased it .  I groomed my two Shih-A-Poos, and they look pretty good  Used my new Waul Deluxe Clipper set followed her instructions and was very pleased with the results.",1395878400,,565,4.311320754716981

8310394,5,B001I2L84Q,This DVD is excellent for a new home groomer.  The dog was at times difficult and uncooperative which made this realistic.  Other DVDs show dogs that are used to being groomed and perfect conditioned coats.  I would highly recommend for first time groomers.  A bit boring for more experienced groomers but very useful just the same.,1374710400,4,332,4.875
