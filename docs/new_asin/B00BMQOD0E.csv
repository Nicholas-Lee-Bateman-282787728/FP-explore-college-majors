5647655,1,B00BMQOD0E,"This DVD was not in English.  On the website it said it was in English but when arrived I looked at the outside of the DVD package and it said in was in Italian.  I'm kind of wondering what to do with it, I haven't opened the package but I don't have the order slip.",1389052800,3,266,3.8181818181818183
5647656,5,B00BMQOD0E,Haven't finished watching it yet but so far my wife and I are enjoying it. It helps because we understand Italian and our parents were born in Sicily. That is all I will say for now until we finish watching it.,1385942400,2,210,4.146341463414634
5647657,5,B00BMQOD0E,"A very well made movie. HD quality, close caption in English. I only wish that it was spoken or dub in English. Italian subtitles are very hard to follow. Very good acting and great story. If they put it in English...most likely, I will buy a copy of it.",1385942400,2,254,4.204081632653061

8570888,5,B00BMQOD0E,"First class miniseries.  As the plot can get complicated (who is who) watching in a short period is very rewarding.  I had watched over a ten week period on Sky tv and the recording of the final episode failed.  I got this, then binged with my wife.  Much better.",1439683200,,263,4.3061224489795915
8570889,1,B00BMQOD0E,"I was hoping for an epic, as the box said, instead i found it to be very boring. i love italian drama, so the subtitled didn't bother me, the acting was bad, and i just didn't care about the characters. my suggestion, rent the godfather 1, 2,3",1435968000,,243,4.191489361702128

8570892,5,B00BMQOD0E,"This is a great, epic Mafia story for every organized crime fan. It's Italian but there are subtitles. The actors who play Toto, etc are incredible. My only complaint is the Hero, the cop pursuing him is given to much time. I understand they have to do something for the law enforcement who died fighting the mob. However can you imagine Good Fellas, the Godfather, Scarface, etc if half of it was dedicated to the law enforcement. My only complaint with this masterpiece.",1428624000,4,472,4.698795180722891
