4132644,5,B003K1NGXE,Why is the NBC color peacock on the cover art box when all the shows are in black & white?,1278892800,7,90,3.55
4132645,5,B003K1NGXE,"When I was a little boy about 5 or 6, I was fasinated with the opening credits of this TV show.  The music and the swirling, marble-like liquid was really special to me.  As an adult I find the stories and the actors better than anything on TV.  Although, in black and white, it was a good restoration of the original broadcast.  I think that the scripts were so well done that it was the best thing these actors had ever done on Television.  It is a psychological drama as it delves into motives and tries to stop crimes before they happen.  It was worth the money.",1278028800,11,566,4.242990654205608
4132646,5,B003K1NGXE,"Firstly, l would like to say my review will not be on the actual dvd of Checkmate- the complete series, since l haven't purchased this set yet. Ive only Purchased Checkmate season 1 and season 2 the best of series. My dissapponted is that Timeless Media Group should have released Checkmate - the complete series in the beginning, instead they give us a some of the epsiodes of both seasons on two different sets. Ive really enjoyed watching this series and now l will buy the complete series, as l really would like to watch more of series. My dissappointment is l am forced to double up on epsiodes l already have from the other two sets. This is really a waste of money.  Im sure other fans of this series will share their dissappointment in doubling up on epsiodes as well. I wish the studios stop releasing seasons of shows and then releasing the complete set at a later date.  It would be kinder on fans to release the complete series in one hit.  But on the flip side, Im happy Checkmate is getting all epsiodes released. ( I hope this time the quality is a little better).",1277424000,6,1080,4.417085427135678
4132647,5,B003K1NGXE,"From 1960 to 1962, Checkmate was my favorite television show.  During much of the 1980s and '90s, I collected as many episodes as I could on videotape.  So I was quite excited when the dvd sets of Checkmate, the best of seasons 1 and 2 were released.  However, as I said in my review of the season one set, the episodes on that set were far from the best of Checkmate.  That has now been remedied with the upcoming release of Checkmate-The Complete Series.  There were so many great episodes from season one that will now be released: the great pilot ""Death Runs Wild"" with Anne Baxter, ""The Human Touch"" with Peter Lorre and ""The Murder Game,"" a greatly atmospheric episode featuring an old house, a stormy night and murder. (I love those type of plots.)  As I stated previously, for some reason, the scripts for Checkmate's first season were far superior to Checkmate's second season.  I noticed it when I originally watched and I can still easily tell a first season show from a second.
While Checkmate got good ratings its first season, CBS still wanted to cancel it.  However the show was produced by Jack Benny's production company and Benny used his clout with CBS to renew it for a second season.  (Benny even guest starred on an episode of Checkmate.  How many other dramatic series did you ever see Jack Benny guest on?  I can't think of any.)  However CBS changed its timeslot the second season and wound up cancelling it after that season.  I guess not even the great Jack Benny could get them to renew it for a third.
However, as I previously stated in my review of season one, Checkmate had some of the greatest guest stars I can ever remember appearing on a dramatic series.  On top of the ones I just mentioned, there was Charles Laughton, Lee Marvin, Joseph Cotton, Joan Fontaine, Dana Andrews, David Janssen, Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Montgomery, Jack Lord, Patricia Neal, James Coburn, Nick Adams, Claire Bloom, Dorothy Malone, Dick Shawn, etc. etc.
I look forward to purchasing the entire series.  Now all I have to do is figure out what to do with the Best of Seasons One and Two.",1275350400,138,2100,4.60752688172043
4132648,4,B003K1NGXE,"I am glad to see this series released to Video....another iconic series from the 60's, which holds special memories for me...again we have series stars, who for the most part were in the beginning or near beginning of their careers, with Doug McClure going on to the Virginian series a few years later, and Sebastian Cabot going on to the butler role in Family Affair.  There was much location filming, and as the synopsis indicates, the beautiful and sometimes haunting vistas of San Francisco and the bay area. I have visited there and it is truly one of the most beautiful places in the States...  The stories were for the most part very well done with wonderful guest stars from time to time and terrific acting...A welcome addition to the other series of that era...Bravo!",1273276800,25,777,4.7481481481481485
4132659,5,B003K1NGXE,"so much fun to have this set, and what memories it brings back.  We always thought Doug McClure looked like my brother back then.  A friend interviewed him for an Audrey Hepburn book because he was in Unforgiven, and he said he had just returned from the doctor and had a clean bill of health. He died shortly afterward.  It was so sad.

I remembered the show as being in color - I'm still on the first season, so maybe it was later on.  The shows move quickly and have some great guest stars plus San Francisco locales.",1472428800,,520,4.26530612244898

4132663,4,B003K1NGXE,"I remembered this show fondly from when I watch it as a kid, and it's well worth buying. A nice cast, even if Anthony George is a bit stiff, and an amazing lineup of guest stars from one episode to another. They always had at least one major star, backed up by other great stars who hadn't yet made their names -- just very well cast.

The majority of shows in the first season are strong, with some weak ones here and there, while the majority of shows in the second season are weaker with a few standouts here and there. It seemed as though they shifted in the second season from focusing on solving murders to solving people's personal dramas, more of the vein of those anthology shows like Route 66 where each week the characters inserted themselves into someone else's little drama. The show was said to fail in the rating in its second season due to a change in time slot, but I suspect it was at least as much due to the shift away from murder mysteries to personal dramas.

Image quality is good -- there's no remastering or anything, it looks like a rerun you'd see on late night -- nothing special but nothing terrible either.",1442707200,3,1136,4.37914691943128

4132671,4,B003K1NGXE,"Loved watched reruns of this detective series when I was a lot younger and was delighted when it was released as a complete series collection.  In retrospect, having watched all seventy episodes, this fine Revue-Universal caper series holds up pretty well.  Created by the brilliant British espionage and crime novelist and screenwriter Eric Ambler (the influence of many including Graham Greene, John Le Carre and Len Deighton), the ingenious idea behind the series was of preventing crime, not solving it.  Over the two years it aired it featured countless great guest stars, had the benefit of a San Francisco setting and a likeable cast, especially Sebastian Cabot as the entertaining and very believable criminologist Dr. Carl Hyatt.  This show also had the benefit of a great theme composed by Johnny Williams before he became John.  A theme easily recognized for years after and his scoring for the early shows were so noteworthy and highly praised that Columbia Records released an LP album of the show's music in 1961 which was actually the first full Williams soundtrack issued.
Sadly ""Checkmate"" did die rather quickly, probably due to its unique premise.  It obviously became very difficult to continue producing believable and original storylines for this limited type of show.  And I must admit most of the last lot of episodes are a bit dull and lifeless, only worth catching for enjoying some of the top guest stars of the day.
P.S.  Anyone interested in the ""Checkmate"" music of Johnny Williams, please check out Film Score Monthly Volume 9 No. 8 for the reissue of this terrific music. And you also get ""Rhythm in Motion"" by Williams and His Orchestra, another Columbia release of 1961.  On the FSM reissue (2006) you get both albums on the one priceless CD, adding up to 69 minutes of early Williams magic.",1407196800,6,1825,4.9573770491803275

4132693,5,B003K1NGXE,"Many are complaining about the video quality of this wonderful series.

What you fail to understand is that series such as Perry Mason, Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock and Outer Limits were syndicated and therefore preserved properly.  Even so some of the less popular episodes of those series are not of the best quality.

The distributor provided a notice on the box and in the description stating that the quality of the video was the best that they could find.

It is not the distributor's job to remaster a series.",1357603200,7,519,4.797752808988764
4132694,4,B003K1NGXE,"I recommend this package to all fans of vintage TV. This is, in my opinion one of the better mystery-adventure series of the time.
Intelligent format with the checkmate characters, and well done stories and dialogue, scenes from the time around San Francisco. Of course, I enjoy the format of the 4 act play.
However don't expect HD quality we've become accustomed to. The film has been cleaned up but there will be some unavoidable imperfections. There are some cuts that cause a few gaps. But all in all, I highly recommend this family friendly mystery series.",1357430400,5,562,4.804123711340206

4132696,5,B003K1NGXE,"I'm surprised that this 1960s TV series isn't better known. It stars three actors who went on to greater fame: Anthony George in Dark Shadows, Doug McClure in The Virginian, and Sebastian Cabot in the classic sitcom Family Affair. It's fun to pick out the many guest stars who later starred in other movies and TV shows, too.

Things were so much different in the 1960s. This show gives an entertaining look at how criminal investigations and psychiatry worked in those days. Crime scenes are handled by guys in business suits, bare-handed and passing the evidence around. Everyone has a Freudian issue leading them into a life of crime. And everyone smokes like chimneys and drinks like fishes! And don't get me started on gender issues...

Anyways, if you like 1960s dramas, this is an undiscovered gem. I highly recommend it. The stories are compelling, the characters are likeable, and you'll enjoy the trip to the ancient era of the early Sixties.",1355788800,7,952,4.87037037037037
4132697,2,B003K1NGXE,"I never saw Checkmate when it originally aired, but it sounded interesting, plus someone recommended it, so I took a chance.

First off, the picture and sound quality on this set is horrible!  Personally, I find it criminal that anyone would have the audacity to release something this bad, let alone sell it at a price comparable to other shows that have pristine production qualities.

Secondly, aside from the unacceptable production quality, the show itself was dull and uninteresting.  I cannot recall a single episode that I found to be especially good.  When it comes to private eye type shows, there are so many others that are way, way better in every respect, i.e., writing, acting, directing and guest stars.  I can see why this show did not last long on the air.",1355702400,4,774,4.7819548872180455
4132698,5,B003K1NGXE,"The ""Checkmate"" box-set never let me down. The series reflects a time in entertainment-history when movies had peaked as the principal mode of entertainment and the most enduring names in theater were transitioning from the big screen to television. Hence, producers were picking off the ground what had once been the highest-hanging fruit.
Add to this the writing talent of an Eric Ambler (""Epitaph for a Spy"" (1938), ""Cause for Alarm"" (1938), ""Journey into Fear"" (1939), ""The Mask of Dimitrios (US title: ""A Coffin for Dimitrios"") (1940), and the viewer has reason to anticipate excellence.
If there is a question it is in the description provided on the CD box. As advertized, I found in none of the fifty-eight hours of unalloyed enjoyment one ""fog-filled"" street. The nearest to this was a steam-bath scene; but, the blurb on the box detracts nothing from this delightful series.",1337299200,3,884,5.061643835616438
4132709,5,B003K1NGXE,"Checkmate is a crime show with a difference. It involves preventing the crime before it happens. Two private investigators and one professor of criminology are the main characters of the show and who's task it is to prevent the crime from happening. It stars Anthony George,who I must admit to not hearing about before and Doug McClure as the private investigators with Sabastian Cabot as the Professor. He is like a big uncle to the other two. Anthony George is the more business-like investigator while Doug McClure is the happy-go-lucky sidekick. Similar to his performance of Trampas on ""The Virginian""
This is a great crime drama with intriguing plot-lines. The guest list reads like a who's who of TV and movies. I really enjoyed this series although I had never seen it before. It is set in San Francisco with some location shooting of that great city. The only minus point here is that it is shot in black and white and so you don't catch the splendour of the locale. It has a great theme score by John Willliams. Two points of interest on the show is on one episode early on in the series,an actress named Barbara Luna appears. She was once married to Doug McClure and the building used as police HQ was also used in another San Francisco based series. It was the office of Ironside, which starred Raymond Burr, seven years later. I think the actual building was raised to the ground in 1966 or ' 67.
There were only two seasons made of this series and they are all here. Enjoy.",1332892800,4,1487,4.573033707865169
4132710,1,B003K1NGXE,"For anyone used to classic television show DVDs such as Perry Mason and Twilight Zone, these Checkmate shows are terrible beyond belief.  Although the packaging is first rate, the DVD product is third rate at best.  There has been no remastering, the prints are not clear, the sound is hit or miss, and it wouldn't be surprising if we were to learn that they are not even produced from original negatives, although I have no idea how they were produced.  As much as I like the Checkmate show, I watched two episodes and said forget it, no more.  To watch any more of them would be a complete waste of time.",1330041600,10,606,4.4324324324324325
4132711,4,B003K1NGXE,"I enjoyed ""Checkmate"", although I liked ""Honey West"" and ""Bourbon Street"" even more. Then there was ""M Squad"" which was almost as good as ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor) and I never missed an episode. At school everybody talked about ""M Squad"" and ""The Detectives"" on the next day. I think there is a large Baby Boomer potential for selling/releasing more of these classic TV series.

Many of those who loved the ""Lassie"", ""Flipper"", ""Fury"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens). I wish these two wonderful old TV series and many others like ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance) would finally be released on DVD.",1323820800,,836,5.147058823529412
4132712,3,B003K1NGXE,"""Checkmate"" is a vintage crime show from the early 1960's (1960 - 1962) and is rather obscure. I was fortunate to grow-up in a city where it popped-up as reruns on a station or two for quite a time after its initial run.  However, I have not seen this show in decades and was thrilled to see it released on DVD.  The premise of the show has been described in other reviews so I will share some gripes for prospective buyers to consider:  First, the initial release of the two ""Best of Checkmate"" DVD sets (which I bought) forced me to ""double-dip"" on episodes included in the complete set.  Second, the quality of the DVD images is ""nostalgic""....Watching these episodes reminded me of watching the reruns on old independent UHF stations tettering on bankruptcy way back in the 1960's/1970's.  In other words, the image and sound quality were less than par but fortunately still watchable.  Third, the DVDs themselves had nicks and scratches for no apparent reason.  It took me three attempts to get a ""scratch free"" set.  Obviously, teh manufacturer, Timeless Video, has quality control issues.  Finally, Amazon. Com delivered two of the three sets in cardboard wraparound packages where the DVD sets arrived slightly crushed....  When will Amazon. Com ever learn?  In fairness, Amazon.com is improving on their packing of DVDs.....At least they aren't using those totally inadequate bubble-wrap mailing envelopes to ship DVDs anymore (knock on wood...)....",1309910400,,1458,5.033333333333333
4132713,5,B003K1NGXE,This is a really top-drawer series although the third year lacks the consistency and quality of the first two seasons. The guest star list is awesome. Every episode has at least one or two major guest stars ranging from Charles Laughton to Angie Dickinson. The concept behind the show was unique; the acting and dialogue was top-notch. Plus no two episdoes are alike.,1306800000,,367,4.841269841269841
4132714,5,B003K1NGXE,"This is a fun series that I've now watched twice all the way through. I like seeing the guest stars presented in different roles, and the Jack Benny episode is great (then again, I love Jack Benny). The film quality is a bit dodgy -- they didn't clean it up and digitize it like the Perry Mason episodes -- but it's certainly watchable if occasionally fuzzy or too dark or light.
My only real quibble is that the series is supposedly set in San Francisco, but the directors/producers of the series never really use that as a backdrop. It could really have been set anywhere. M-Squad, on the other hand, really uses Chicago as a ""character"" in the series.
All in all, I recommend this series to anyone who likes Perry Mason, M-Squad, and series like those.",1301097600,2,755,4.518248175182482
4132715,1,B003K1NGXE,"I absolutely do not recommend this DVD series to anyone.  The film quality is  horrendous, and the writing is inferior. Even though it has well-known actors, the shows are boring.  I own the entire Perry Mason series that is available so far, and Checkmate does not compare in the quality of film, or the plots.

4132716,4,B003K1NGXE,"I had not seen ""Checkmate"" since it was originally on the air and remembered it as being a childhood favorite. It was similar in format to a popular predecessor ""77 Sunset Strip"" as each featured a three-man team solving mysteries, but ""Checkmate"" was more literate. Viewing this show some 50 years later, I can appreciate the fine writing and performances. It is a joy to see favorite actors of the 50's and 60's in featured and supporting roles. For example, an early episode with Jane Wyman as a guest star featured a very young and exquisite Mary Tyler Moore portraying a receptionist in an architectural firm. The main drawback (and it is a big one) is that the sound quality is horrible -- the soundtrack is tinny and loud and drowns out the dialogue. I could live with that if only there were close captioning, but there isn't. Another issue is the picture. There was no digital remastering and the degradation is very obvious. If you can overlook the sound and picture and can appreciate good scripts (a rarity on tv today), excellent acting (Sebastian Cabot is a special delight), and an opportunity to see actors -- some famous and still working (Dean Stockwell, Cloris Leachman) and some who are barely remembered today but were extremely popular in the 60's, such as Janice Rule -- it is a great value and will give you many happy hours!",1299801600,5,1349,4.69620253164557
4132717,1,B003K1NGXE,"Checkmate was one of my favorite TV shows.  I saw the complete series was available for purchase and I jumped at the chance to own it.  I was deeply disappointed in the quality of the video, it was obviously not remastered.  I have purchased other vintage TV series, Alfred Hitchcock TV series for example and I found the quality to be excellent.  Timeless puts a disclaimer about the quality at the beginning of the video but I do not believe that releases them from the responsibility to produce a quality product. Hope to never purchase a video put out by Timeless again.",1298332800,24,574,4.598039215686274
4132718,4,B003K1NGXE,"Checkmate was a detective series with a very original premise: a detective agency using the latest investigative techniques that endeavored to solve/stop crimes BEFORE they happened. You might imagine that this was a very difficult premise for the writers to stay true to, and you'd be right. They didn't always manage to match the premise, but the stories were in any case inventive enough to offer some surprises when compared to standard detective fare. When the stories did live up to the premise, they were clever and entertaining indeed.

The show provided early looks to TV viewers at Doug McClure and Sebastian Cabot. Both played their roles to perfection ... McClure as the brash and personable young partner, and Cabot as the learned, brilliant investigative perfectionist. Anthony George, the leader of the trio, was solid as the concerned professional and clever tactician. Unfortunately, much like Anthony Eisley in ""Hawaiian Eye"", Checkmate was the high point of George's TV career. After Checkmate he had a couple of stints in soap operas, and otherwise guest starring roles.

Like other series of that day (Maverick and 77 Sunset Strip, for example), I remembered liking Checkmate as a kid, but at this point couldn't remember any details about it. I'm finding it very entertaining to rediscover a show I liked as a kid, but from an adult perspective where I obviously understand much more about the stories than I did then. For a fan of nostalgic TV shows, this is a good choice, and the price is a bargain.

The DVD presentation is far from pristine, but picture quality is a major cut above what would have been seen in syndicated re-runs over the years. I've found that in most older movies and TV shows, if the story is compelling, you soon lose track of the flaws in the picture, and that is certainly the case here.

As other reviewers have noted, Checkmate was chock full of big name guest stars, as well as early looks at stars who would shine in major ways a few years hence. For example, one early show has Mary Tyler Moore in a minor role, a couple of years before she would become a household name in ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"".

I give this one a strong recommendation.",1297555200,7,2197,4.755905511811024

* QUALITY OF TRANFERS: Images are soft and appear as dubbed VHS video cassette images although they are probably secondary (video) copies of older film transfers.  Nevertheless, the episodes are highly watchable and appear as 40-50s type of material.  Persons over 40 years old will probably be satisfied since they grew up in this era.  There does not appear to be ANY type of remastering and this is clear in the first episode that shows splotches, scratches, and other old film type of defects.  Sound is acceptable mono.  No subtitles (English, etc.)

* DISKS AND PACKAGING: Excellent.  Disks are single-sided, labeled, and in polypropylene (soft plastic) cases packaged 2 per case.  There is a strong odor of printer's ink on the disk that may go away with time.  I hope that the Studio will use more environmentally friendly inks in the future... they should demand it from their source of manufacturers.

* SHOW IN GENERAL: 5-star show--suitable for all ages that like to see crime drama that is not gory as in ""classic television""-- BLACK & WHITE television.  Photography tends to be on the dark side, but plots and acting are excellent and believable with even some humor interlaced with the action and suspense.  The audience is generally given the viewpoint of the 3 detectives, but also knows many of the overall crime elements.

* PRICE: I had never seen this series and bought it on the basis of the reviews and price.  For $32.99 (USD) or roughly 59% off the list price, the show represents good value, although similar sets (Wanted Dead or Alive) with similar production (minimal) are in the $13-$20 USD range.  The price may go lower than this and if so, it is series worth having unless remastered versions become available.

* CONCLUSION: a little more effort could have been made by Timeless Media Group Studio to make a better compilation.  BEWARE OF THIS STUDIO BECAUSE THE QUALITY IS MINIMAL.",1288224000,50,1973,4.8562874251497
4132731,5,B003K1NGXE,"This 14-DVD set (you get the entire series) in glorious black and white is very good quality and a lot of fun to watch as a cultural window into 1960--like having to search for a payphone in the field in order to stay in touch. Some of the stories are top-notch in their originality--most people couldn't guess the outcome--as is the concept of an organization that takes only cases that give them the opportunity to prevent a crime before it occurs--in other words, to ""Checkmate"" dastardly deeds.  The actors (Anthony George, Doug McClure, and Sebastian Cabot) are just great and very engaging.  I love series that have lots of guest stars and wonderful character actors--this series delivers in every episode.  Examples:  John Williams, Gary Merrill, and Peter Lorre;  Cloris Leachman early in her career, and Mary Tyler Moore playing the small part of a secretary just months before becoming Laura Petrie on the Dick Van Dyke Show!  Lots of entertainment here at a great price.",1288051200,9,981,4.915151515151515
4132732,4,B003K1NGXE,"The series is still quite good even after 50 years but the cuts are annoying.  One-hour series back then typically ran for 52 minutes.  The remaining time was for commercials.  See, for example, The Fugitive.  On this release the running time fluctuates at about 48 minutes.  This suggests that 4 minutes or so are cut from each episode.  Obvious evidence of cuts is that each scene ends on a fade right after a line of dialogue.  This reminds me of syndicated episodes that were cut to fit certain time slots.  Another complaint is that the picture quality fluctuates from episode to episode.  On my set it seems that one episode on each 5-episode disk is at a lower resolution.  It looks like one of those 50-movie packs.  Now I suspect that the explanation is simple:  To fit 5 episodes on one disk requires one of the episodes to be recorded in lower resolution.  Having to fit 5 on one side might also explain some cuts as well.  Perhaps a more dvd-literate reviewer can comment on my suspicions.  Overall though the price is right and the never-ending stream of familiar guest stars a joy to behold. Still, though, a restored uncut version would be appreciated by this reviewer.",1287964800,10,1184,4.6521739130434785
4132733,2,B003K1NGXE,"I have no problems with the TV show Checkmate - I enjoy it. That's why I bought ""Checkmate the Complete Series"" after forking out money for the two best of sets which had been released earlier, knowing that I would be duplicating these episodes. I do however have major problems with the quality of this release, as indeed I invariably have done with nearly every Timeless release which I have purchased.

Even on the first two sets there were quality issues - the episodes had not been remastered in any way, and there were frame drop-outs,sound problems, blotches, scratches and muddy image quality on many of the epsisodes, although from memory all of the episodes in the first two sets were watchable. I suspect that most of these epsodes were edited from their original running times, though not as I remember in a way so as to be obvious and detract in a substantial way from one's viewing pleasure.

The Complete Series release under discussion here unfortunately does not improve on this state - if anything the image qualty issues are somewhat worse - even on some of the epsiodes repeated from the first two releases!! What is even more annoying is that the editing on some of the previously unreleased epsisodes is so bad as to render some of the plots barely comprehensible in parts because of gaping holes in the narrative. Off the top of my head the best example of this is the episode ""Will the Real Killer Please Stand Up?"" where it is obvious that certain onscreen events have been deleted from the epsiode. And even more bizarrely, some of the episodes which are repeated from the first two sets appear to have been even further edited for this set, suggesting that the guilty party may not be the source - as in syndicated copies edited to fit a TV timeslot - but the people at Timeless themselves. The best example of this is the episode ""Down the Gardenia Path"" where the opening few minutes of the epsiode present in the first ""Best of.."" release are completely missing from the ""Complete Series"" release.

In any event, I doubt whether I will bother with any further Timeless releases, even if they are TV shows I have been wanting to see for years.",1287273600,81,2172,4.636363636363637
4132734,4,B003K1NGXE,"I cannot add anything to the program descriptions left here by my fellow reviewers. As already noted, some of the programs show age related film defects and some graininess in picture quality, but I knew beforehand that these episodes hadn't been digitally remastered during transfer. I recall watching this series when I was still in grade school and found it even more enjoyable now than I did back then, especially since I missed about a dozen episodes.

My only caveat to potential buyers is that the packaging could have been made a bit more durable. Upon receiving my order, I discovered that some of the plastic ""fingers"" of the central hubs securing each DVD were too fragile and had broken in transit, leaving the discs free to rattle around inside the storage cases. Fortunately, none of the DVD's were scratched. Even in the cases which were still intact, the discs were not secured very well. I was able to remedy this problem by inserting a piece of stiff paper between the two discs inside each case before I stored the set in my library.

The four-star rating is really for the fault in the packaging, not the quality of the TV series. Timeless Media should acquire better storage cases for future issues of this product.",1286582400,7,1236,4.744186046511628
4132735,3,B003K1NGXE,The plots are usually typical and the viewer is generally 10 minutes ahead of the detectives. The video quality ranged from poor to fair.,1285718400,12,137,4.75
4132736,4,B003K1NGXE,"I bought Checkmate the Complete Series for $36.99 and for that price, it is a steal. I wish the video had of been restored...for the most part it is OK but some parts of some episodes have some grainy areas. Don't let this deter you though, we should be grateful the series is on DVD.",1283299200,12,284,4.181818181818182
4132737,4,B003K1NGXE,"I love this show. I love this set. The price is great. But I disagree with those who give the picture quality a B+ or even a B-. For me, on average, this is C+ material at best. I realize I am spoiled by the pristine transfers that for so long came from Paramount; even so, I had hoped the picture quality here would be better, even by just a little bit. I am also saddened that not every episode is presented in its complete form. The editing doesn't look too bad, and I am so happy to see this beloved show I can forgive these issues after taking off one star from my rating.

In my opinion, if you're not a fan of this show you should be, and if you are a fan, the pros (having this series at last!) outweigh the cons I mentioned above.

I am glad I bought the set. You will be too.",1282867200,15,785,3.930817610062893
4132738,5,B003K1NGXE,"For years my dad told me about this great series, and now I can enjoy it myself any time I want.  This team of 3 private detectives are not like any you will see again, and they do their job well (as many of you know my role model is a pretty good one at that).  Their mission was to prevent major crimes BEFORE they happen.  That is not something you see today.  But from 1960 to 1962, it did happen for 70 hour long episodes.  Hence the name of their organization, Checkmate.  The stars:  Anthony George as Don Corey, well experienced private detective, Doug McClure as Jed Sills, his junior partner who has a weak spot for the girls but still gets the job done to everyone's satisfaction.  Along for the ride is Sebastian Cabot as Carl Hyatt, a former Oxford professor of criminology who now teaches at the local university (the series takes place in San Francisco I believe).  I would not be surprised if the good doctor obtained some of his methods from Sherlock Holmes himself.  The series as I said ran 2 seasons, and 70 episodes (not much time for reruns well considering it was the early 60s, reruns were still a new concept or maybe even non existing one at the time) with a guest star list that could fill their own personalized volume of Who's Who.  Joining the team in Season 2 sporadically was Jack Betts as Chris Devlin, a ""new recruit"".  This series has been previously video released in 2 12 episode, 3 disc spurts (1 from each season) in 2007 and 2008 (the latter containing at least 1 Devlin episode).  The manufacturer also released a hard to find 2 disc 4 episode third set later on that year (2008) as well which did not duplicate the episodes in the above mentioned ""Best of"" sets (remember those words don't always mean the best episodes, but is advertising ploy to get you to buy) so if you could find it, at the time it was worth the purchase.  Several episodes have also been released by the ""el cheapos"" who offer compilations of old cop/detective shows like Dragnet 50s, Ellery Queen 50s and others in a variety pack.  Most likely, the episodes in these sets are now duplicates of Timeless Video's 3 previously mentioned sets.  When I found the 3rd set, and I emailed the manufacturer about it's availability and they told me how selective it was, they also offered to put me on a waiting list as they working on this mega set for hopefully a soon release at the time.  Now just in time for the show's 50th anniversary (although it took an extra month from the street date to get copies to other retailers including Amazon), HERE IT IS, all 70 shows, 5 each on 14 discs, uncut and uninterrupted which of course makes the other 3 sets worthless.  This set is definitely a keeper, if nothing else for the array of guest stars.  For those of you who only remember watching Tony George for the short time he was on Dark Shadows, Doug McClure for his westerns, the late 80s sci fi sit com, Out Of The World, and other stuff, and Sebastian Cabot for Family Affair and his work for Disney (and for whatever else is on Jack Betts' resume for that matter), you are in for a treat.  This is a show that shares one thing with ""24"", ""Wiseguy"", ""West Wing"", ""NCIS"" and other ""keepers"".  Once you are hooked, you won't give it up.  And once you reach the end of disc 14, you will wanna start again.  BUY IT BEFORE IT GETS AWAY!!!!",1279929600,41,3345,4.403252032520325
