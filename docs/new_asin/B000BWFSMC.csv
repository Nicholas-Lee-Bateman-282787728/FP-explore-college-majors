[...]

This video shows the research done by mormons who used to be a part of the mormon church.  If you study archeology and linquistics, the evidence is apparant that the book of mormon is a religion based on lies.  The Living Hope Ministries offers some answers to questions about this issue and shows some of the contradictions between the bible and the book of mormon.  Another good video made from the same ministry is DNA vs The Book of Mormon which reveals the true ancestry of Native Americans.  Don't just look the other way to avoid the truth...",1155513600,9,595,4.628571428571429
2444355,5,B000BWFSMC,"This documentary, produced by the Living Hope Ministries in Brigham City, Utah, remains faithful to its explicit purpose: to determine if the Book of Mormon truly is comparable with the Bible.  While the individuals behind the film are Christians, as they readily admit, this is not really an examination of faith per se.  What it really tries to do is put both the Book of Mormon and the Bible in context alongside geographical, historical, and scientific facts.  To put it in a nutshell, this video succeeds in proving that there a single piece of evidence for the factual basis of the Book of Mormon.  It is not an attack on the Mormon faith in and of itself, as faith is by definition unquantifiable, but the implication is about as clear as can be - if the Book of Mormon is riddled with factual errors, it cannot be the inspired word of God.

It is an incontrovertible fact that not a single piece of evidence has been found to substantiate the factual basis of the Book of Mormon.  In consultation with a diverse group of geologists, anthropologists, historians, archaeologists, linguists, and other experts, the makers of this documentary walk the viewer through the evidence step by step.  There is plenty of evidence to support the historical authenticity of both the Old Testament and the New Testament - non-Biblical sources referring to Biblical figures (including Jesus Christ), ancient manuscripts containing some or all of the various Books of the Bible, verifiable locations of important events, evidence of past cultures in the region during the right times, etc.  As one expert succinctly puts it, the Bible is archaeologically sound.

In contrast with the Bible, there is no factual basis for the Book of Mormon.  There are no ancient manuscripts pre-dating Joseph Smith's discovery in 1830 of the golden plates (which themselves are not extant for any type of investigation).  We are told of three large civilizations in the ancient Americas and written records produced over the course of a thousand years, but there is no evidence that any of these large civilizations existed - no ruins, no skeletal remains, no tools or handcrafts.  Where are any of the 30+ major cities the Book of Mormon talks about?  Why can't the LDS produce a single map corresponding with anything resembling earth's geography?  Why have no sites been discovered containing the slightest bit of evidence for the metallurgical accomplishments spoken of in the Book of Mormon?  We are told that the Nephite civilization spoke and wrote in the language of Reformed Egyptian, a language that simply never existed on this earth.  Not a single one of the metallic coins reportedly used for over a millennium have been found, nor any sign of metallurgical advancement dating back to that time.  Why is there no applicable evidence whatsoever from Cumorah, the site of two intense battles that reportedly left hundreds of thousands of warriors dead?  Where are the chariot pieces, steel swords, mass graves, etc.?  And what of all those horses the warriors rode into battle hundreds of years before horses were first introduced to the New World by the Europeans?

When you break down some of the most basic ""facts"" contained in the Book of Mormon, it's obvious that many of them are categorically wrong if not impossible.  The book talks about animals and plants that were not in that region; there is no evidence of even the most basic metallurgy, let alone steel swords and golden tablets; there's not even the first arrowhead found at the site of two fierce, large-scale battles.  Setting aside religion altogether, it's obvious that the Book of Mormon is simply riddled with factual errors.  This stands in contrast to the Holy Bible, which is archaeologically, geographically, and historically sound.  Whether or not you are a Christian and follow the teachings of Jesus, you can be assured that the people and places referred to in the Bible actually existed; if you are a Mormon, you have to have blind faith in a ""Scripture"" that is provably false.  The primary purpose of this documentary is to challenge Mormons to take a good, hard look at their faith - and it succeeds admirably in doing just that.  Two of the most effective interview subjects are LDS anthropologists who set out to prove that the Book of Mormon was factual and ended up leaving the church after failing to come up with a single piece of evidence.",1154822400,16,4417,4.9111709286675636

2444357,5,B000BWFSMC,"If you can approach this subject with an open mind, this DVD is a powerful expos on the fictional account known as the Book of Mormon.  Think of belief in Mormonism as being a campfire - this video first throws water on the fire, then methodically goes through any smoldering coals remaining and extinguishes them one by one.  I have seen several videos on this subject, and this is the most compelling and well-researched of them all.  Living Hope Ministries also has another DVD entitled ""DNA vs. The Book of Mormon"" which is also quite good, though not as excellent as this one (it refutes the Mormon claim that Native Americans descended from Jewish ancestors.)  And to second the motion made by prior reviewer E. Milewski, I also *HIGHLY* recommend the book ""One Nation Under Gods"" by Richard Abanes which meticulously lays out a detailed and damning history of Mormonism, supported by extensive footnotes and references.",1147392000,12,926,4.916666666666667

It covers it all in this DVD many Mormons are affraid of watching this DVD however if they truely feel that there Book is correct then why are they running from the truth?

2444362,1,B000BWFSMC,"I suppose we can simply come to the conclusion that the people who made this film were either completely ignorant or they didn't tell the whole truth on purpose.  Evidence suggests the latter.

Let's give a simple real life example:

Let's say a father has plenty of money in a bank account that his children do not know about, and he could buy them a nice set of books.  However, let's say that he doesn't want to spend the money on educating his children.

Now, if his kids were to ask him, ""daddy, I really want to get these books and learn from them,"" he could reply, ""no, I have no money ..."" and then whisper under his breath ""on me.""

In this scenario, the father doesn't mention the money that is in the bank account because, even though his kids trusts him, they don't want to explain the whole story because it doesn't fit his agenda.

This film is just chalk full of THAT kind of ""little white lie"".  Together they make a big one.

Don't take my word for it.  Look into it yourselves.

2444363,5,B000BWFSMC,"When compared to the abundant evidence that can be used to support the historicity of the Bible, there is no comparison when the Book of Mormon enters into the picture. What the makers of this documentary have done is show definitively that the Book of Mormon cannot be supported archaeologically, anthropologically, historically, and scientifically. The interviews with some 40 different scholars show that it takes a great amount of blind faith to hold to this book as being authentic, though there are indeed some 12 million people who belong to the Mormon Church apparently believing that Joseph Smith, Jr. truly did translate an ancient American scripture.

Most enjoyable was seeing two LDS anthropologists who claim that, while they personally hold to the truthfulness of the Bible, they can no longer believe in the most sacred of all LDS texts. It almost seems as if they are begging to be excommunicated. I wonder if Gordon Hinckley will do what Thomas Murphy seems to want, cut him off from the church and thus invite a head-on confrontation. But Murphy is right: If the Book of Mormon is not accurate, a mere fairy tale, then every Mormon has a problem since his or her faith is based on lies. If one must merely spiritualize this book in order to hold on to the faith, then nothing really matters and you might as well believe in the Tooth Fairy and Loch Ness Monster. Just bow down to the altar of whatever you choose, which just doesn't make sense. Even many early LDS leaders have said that a person could ""take up"" the Book of Mormon, and if it didn't stand the test, then the entire Mormon religion would fall as well.

What I appreciated most of all is that this was not a ""in-your-face"" film put out by ""anti-Mormons,"" as the producers clearly showed that they are Christians who love the Mormon people and merely want them to become exposed to the facts. As Joel Kramer said in the video, ""We did this project as a labor of love because we want the Mormon people to come into a relationship with the real Jesus of the Bible.""

I highly recommend this DVD for the thinking viewer who wants to see what the experts have to say. Another thing that I wonder about is if the LDS apologists will respond to this production other than offer ad hominem attacks against the messengers, as is typical of how they have dealt with other hard-hitting projects. Let's just stick to the facts and leave the games for the football field, gentlemen.",1136678400,17,2453,4.647465437788019

These atrocieities were in the Book of Mormon along with the huge highway in the book of mormon that was discovered by archeologists. Mormons have read the Holy Bible and believe it should go hand in hand with the Book of Mormon as was fortold in the Bible about there would be 2 sticks (which were scrolls) and both would become one stick. Besides the Book of Mormon and the Holy Bible I have also read the book of Jasher, book of enoch, dead sea scrolls and found them all as a testimony that our creator lives.

Unfortunately our Mormon missionary friends are not allowed to view it while on their mission, but it will give you some basic questions to present about the ""deeper truths,"" i.e., where is any record of the great civilizations, the cities, the tools, modes of transportation, weapons, coinage, animals, plants, etc. that are mentioned in the Book of Mormon hundreds of times, that did not exist prior to Columbus?

2444377,1,B000BWFSMC,"On behalf of all my Mormon friends and any other religion attacked by ""Science"" for that matter:

Ha ha ha! Don't make me laugh! Nothing says foolishness like trying to use science to prove or disprove religion.
Science is a religion! You've traded ministers but, they're still passing the collection plate!
If you choose your religion, or lack thereof, based on a video you're not very bright.

First, scientists claim to disprove the Bible all the time so how can these guys use it for a measurement?!

Second, if this is ""REAL SCIENCE"" where are the required peer reviews and opposing debate?
Think people! This is unsubstantiated propaganda with a clear motive.

You can believe me, I'm a scientist, and I'm never wrong. It must be true, because, I researched it! No one will ever disprove my theories and you should bet your entire spiritual happiness on what I say instead of following your heart and your God!

HA HA HA! This video is total bunk as are these not so subtly disguised Mormon hating reviews. Give me several thousand dollars and I'll make a video with my own scientists that totally refutes this one! GUARANTEED!

Don't put your trust in the arm of flesh or you'll never find your spiritual way.

Finally, you should know, that we really have no idea what Native American Cultures looked like before WE wiped them out with our European diseases, oppression/slavery, and before the Jesuits burned all of their so called pagan records (except the ones carried back to the Vatican of course - wouldn't those be interesting). They were not simple primitive pagan societies. They were very complex and intelligent societies with their own brilliant people and science. Don't believe me? Just ask scientists how the South American natives built stoneworks without mortar that are so tight and perfect. You'll get ten different answers and none of them conclusive. Moreover, ask them how many records of the people survived at all and why most are gone. (Basically it's easier to label people as savages, kill them, and take their land if you destroy any proof they're really smart religious human beings.

The only scientific fact, is that scientific fact is anything but fact!
It's just the best information we have until we get smarter.
No one knows people!

Don't put your spirituality in the hands of those who are most devoid of it.
Set high standards for yourself, follow your heart, have faith, and strive to be a better person.
If being Mormon helps you do that, more power to you and God bless you.

2444391,5,B000BWFSMC,"I am an active Mormon and attend Mormon temples. Much of this review comes from a prior review of mine on another work by the same authors.  What is nice about this edition is that it has extra footage included that is not found in the original.  This extra footage has some very interesting and crucial subject matter.  I'm very happy this second edition was released. The research presented in this work does not bother me in the least. The authors are merely attempting to demonstrate that we have ample, physical evidence for the writings contained in the Bible and absolutely nothing for the Book of Mormon. Nothing presented in this work should come as a surprise to those who are honestly seeking truth by researching Joseph Smith, his works and the early Mormon church. Truth is not afraid of challenge and research.

There is no evidence in any realm of research that demonstrates an advanced, record keeping, coin exchanging, machinery building, steel smelting, chariot/horse riding, Egyptian-Hebrew speaking, blood-descended-of-Israel, hemispheric people in the America's prior to the arrival of the Europeans. Had this been the case Columbus and his crew would have found a very advanced civilization here in the Americas complete with cities, roads, buildings of stones, coins, elaborate trade systems, Christian theologies, churches, advanced implements of war, wheat, barley, horses, chariots and the list goes on. Instead what was found? We all know the history on this. Columbus found beautiful indigenous peoples with customs and rituals dating back thousands of years. Multitudes of languages and dialects that trace their origins to Asiatic language pools. And all of this, including their DNA markers have NOTHING to do with Israel.

Many Mormon defenders, including those at Brigham Young University, support and teach a theory which attempts to explain why we can't find anything in the Americas related to the peoples and races described in the Book of Mormon. The theory, the so-called Small Geography Theory, suggests that the founding populations described in the Book of Mormon were so small and geographically isolated in Meso America that they couldn't have contributed much to the gene pool of Central America nor to the landscape on which they lived. This theory flies squarely in the face of what the Book of Mormon itself teaches. The book teaches that the Americas were hidden from the knowledge of the entire world essentially making the Americas uninhabited by humans prior to the arrival of the people described in the book. We know this is not true. Further, solid research has demonstrated that the ruin sites of Meso America have no tie whatsoever to the Eastern world. The book teaches that the populations in the book were as numerous as the sands of the seas and had cities in numbers that could not easily be counted. This clearly tells me these peoples covered a vast territory in the Americas. It names cities, a river and seas all of which cannot be located anywhere. Is it really honest to distort the teachings of the book to account for the lack of physical evidence? The populations described in the Book of Mormon lived here 1000 years. That's 1000! Yet we can't find so much as a single coin from the elaborate coin system described in the book? On the other hand, the cities, coins and people of the Bible are accounted for not just by science but by texts that date back thousands of years.

We, as a church, cannot continue to preach to the indigenous populations of the Americas in this hemisphere that they are blood descended of Israelites in order to grow the church and keep members in the church pews. It's a lie and a cunning proselytizing tool. We, as a church, say we embody the truth. Well, frankly, we need to stop covering everything up and admit some of our major doctrines are false and misguided. The American Indians and Latinos of the Americas are beautiful, Asian descended people. I challenge all Mormon Native Americans and Latinos to research your molecular genealogy and the areas in which you live. Study the ruin sites in Central America and understand more about the Olmec, Aztec, Maya and other peoples in your countries. I need to do the same with the indigenous populations of North America. Put the Book of Mormon to the test. Do not be afraid to discover where your ancestors came from. There are huge genographic projects happening right now that will help you understand your lineage. It's really about the truth. Once you really begin to hunger for truth will you be able to begin the journey of finding your past and your future.",1174521600,36,4620,4.916666666666667
2444392,5,B000BWFSMC,"I am an active Mormon and attend Mormon temples.  Much of this review comes from a prior review of mine on another work by the same authors.  The research presented in this work does not bother me in the least.  The authors are merely attempting to demonstrate that we have ample, physical evidence for the writings contained in the Bible and absolutely nothing for the Book of Mormon.  Nothing presented in this work should come as a surprise to those who are honestly seeking truth by researching Joseph Smith, his works and the early Mormon church.  Truth is not afraid of challenge and research.

There is no evidence in any realm of research that demonstrates an advanced, record keeping, coin exchanging, machinery building, steel smelting, chariot/horse riding, Egyptian-Hebrew speaking, blood-descended-of-Israel, hemispheric people in the America's prior to the arrival of the Europeans.  Had this been the case Columbus and his crew would have found a very advanced civilization here in the Americas complete with cities, roads, buildings of stones, coins, elaborate trade systems, Christian theologies, churches, advanced implements of war, wheat, barley, horses, chariots and the list goes on.  Instead what was found?  We all know the history on this.  Columbus found beautiful indigenous peoples with customs and rituals dating back thousands of years.  Multitudes of languages and dialects that trace their origins to Asiatic language pools.  And all of this, including their DNA markers have NOTHING to do with Israel.

Many Mormon defenders, including those at Brigham Young University, support and teach a theory which attempts to explain why we can't find anything in the Americas related to the peoples and races described in the Book of Mormon.  The theory, the so-called Small Geography Theory, suggests that the founding populations described in the Book of Mormon were so small and geographically isolated in Meso America that they couldn't have contributed much to the gene pool of Central America nor to the landscape on which they lived.

2444393,4,B000BWFSMC,"Unfortunately Mr. Breivik and Stonestreet are missing the point. There is only one truth and one God. Period.. I am not by any means trying to offend, but your remarks are exactly what lead people astray. The Bible is the only truth.. It is the only book that has stood the test of time for over 2 thousand years. Not Buddha, not the book of mormon, and not the watchtower society. There are aethiest scientist out there that would give their right and left arms if they could prove the Bible a hoax. They never have. It's funny these same aethiest use the Bible as a book of reference because it is always right. Please read 1 John 4:1-4 It will explain the false prophets that will and have come.",1166572800,4,698,4.376923076923077
8093626,3,B000BWFSMC,"Supposedly based on a true story, this was a staged interview between an unknowledgeable Mormon and a knowledgeable Christian about why the book of Mormon (and thus the Mormon religion) cannot be trusted, and why the Bible can be trusted.

8093629,1,B000BWFSMC,"Oh my I thought I had read it all. Here we have some disillusioned people who couldn't abide by the LDS teachings write another slightly tactful deceptive book attacking the Book of Mormon. Nothing wrong with trying to prove the Bible is truthful considering it itself proves the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. Historical readings unfortunately prove how the Bible has been incorrectly translated multiple times. Without addressing this you are left with a lack of real facts. Adding to this is the huge factual proven findings of evidence throughout the years of names, places, events from the Book of Mormon. Of course none of these are mentioned. Far more intelligent men than these have attempted the same misdirection and failed. The Bible does have the word of God, and the Book of Mormon is proof of it as it has much more.",1468800000,3,835,4.805555555555555
8093630,5,B000BWFSMC,I grew up in a mixed Catholic and Mormon family this is a great way to spread some truth to the Mormon people.  Joseph Smith reports he spoke to an Angel named Moroni who told him about  Zephani from the tribe of Nephi. The whole thing is just one big lie. This movie helps you to see that...Maybe that's why most people check in hotels using his name.,1451865600,,352,4.161764705882353

Ex-Latter Day Saint families on YouTube shine a little more light on the theological and practical inconsistencies of the historical and current leaders and prophets, but this documentary really just gives a black and white comparison of the two books... at the preface to the book of Mormon it says that it is a work comparable to the Bible, so this documentary simply tests that claim as to whether or not the Book of Mormon can pass any of the geographical, historical, and archaeological tests that the Bible passes.  Very well produced.  Highly recommended for Mormons, Protestants, or anyone that wants to see what tests each book passes.",1429833600,2,702,4.923728813559322
