8011607,5,B0001EYSFI,Everything else about this film is just laughable. That's why its fun to watch. Its laughable. The main stars mentioned above are pretty interesting to watch and have gone on to daytime tv and larger films.  There are some crude words and actions info the film that could have been left out. It would have made it better.,1426204800,,321,4.5344827586206895
8011608,5,B0001EYSFI,"This is the ultimate cult classic.  It is very hard to find this DVD...but if you do...BUY IT!  True horror fans will love this flick...the story of a truly insane maniac out to kill his family and anyone who stands in his way.  It is rated NC-17 because the gore is extreme...totally extreme...JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT!!!  LOL!!!  I'm not sure as to why this gem is a pin in a haystack, but perhaps the extreme nature of true horror has scared distributors from moving this along.  It will give you nightmares.  Trust me.  BUY IT!!!",1269388800,,531,4.402061855670103
