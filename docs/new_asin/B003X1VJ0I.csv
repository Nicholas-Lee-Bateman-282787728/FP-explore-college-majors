8407578,4,B003X1VJ0I,"THE MOVIE IS IN GERMAN LANGUAGE, AND ALL THE ACTORS ARE GERMANS.
THE MOVIE HAS ENGLISH SUBTITLES.

THIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT A YOUNGER ADOLF HITLER, DURING THE TIME WHEN
HITLER WANTED TO BE A GREAT CHARACTER, A GREAT PAINTER, AND ATTEND
ONE OF GERMANY'S TOP UNIVERSITY IN GERMANY.  BUT HIS STRUGGLE WITH MONEY
AND UNKNOWLEDGEABLE LIFE EXPERIENCE THIS WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT
FOR HIM TO BE ON TOP OF VIEW OF SOCIETY.

NOW, ANY ONE READING MY REVIEW... I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT
I AM NOT A HITLER FAN, OR  A HITLER LOVER.

SO, WITH THAT SAID... I THINK THIS MOVIE IS GOOD.",1370822400,,573,4.317757009345795
