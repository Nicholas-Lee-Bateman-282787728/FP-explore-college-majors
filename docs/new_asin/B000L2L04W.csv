I would not waste your money as I have done mine, If you have not already read other books by Rich dad then these are a good beginning.",1398556800,,402,4.10126582278481

8160009,5,B000L2L04W,"I've known of the Rich Dad/ Poor dad series of books for quite some time.  However this is my first material that I ended up trying from them.  So far, I love it.  I'm about half way through the first book, and I haven't even checked out the DVD's yet.  I suppose there probably is a lot of repeated material from his other books as one reviewer pointed out.  But if this your first read from the author you are going to love it.

I already feel its worth 5 stars and I haven't watch the DVD's yet.  A good deal.",1354579200,,512,4.00990099009901

8160011,5,B000L2L04W,This DVD is something to open your mind a bit. It is more of a good introduction. I enjoy Rich Dad teaching this is typical Robert.,1200182400,5,131,4.076923076923077
8160012,1,B000L2L04W,"If you are going to use one of Christ's parables, Mr. Kiyosaki, at least get it right.  You used the Parable of the Talents in a recent broadcast on PBS featuring this book and its teaching.  However, the man you referred to as the father was actually a master in Matthew 25:14-30. The people he gave the money to were his servants, not his sons.  In the book of Luke it is the Parable of the Minas.  I do not see in either account that any of the servants spent all of their money. That was the younger son in the Parable of the Prodigal Son. Good teachers check their sources.",1189209600,3,578,4.18018018018018
