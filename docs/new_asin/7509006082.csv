1114667,5,7509006082,"Rating should be 4, or perhaps 3-1/2, stars but it is a sentimental favorite of mine from back when...back then, 1969, and it still gets the juices flowing. Saw it again to compare it to the current re-make and, as expected, overwhelmingly prefer this original. The heat between Delon and Schneider is felt, not just as authentic which it was of course, but as human, real. Then there is the external weight of the summer warmth, all of it still and waiting, as we do, for something to happen. Even when it does, it is low key on the screen, organic to the scene and the characters, very possible and real. Just love the subtlety of the original. Setting is lovely without being lush. The pool and its summer light is the focus but no need to glamorize what is already breathtaking.",1465084800,,782,4.514084507042254

1114726,5,7509006082,"In this excellent collection from Studio Canal ""Screen Icons: Alain Delon"" we get 5 very distinctive films of his, with some strong performances by him as well.

First-up is the stylish-new-wave classic from 1960 ""Plein soleil"" (""Purple Noon""), which was directed by none other than Ren&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment. What more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said. Alain Delon gives a taut and enigmatic performance (as Tom Ripley), and he really is the epitome of ""cool"". So much so, that you actually kind of sympathize with him and, want him to get away with it all. Now, so many people have different opinions on what this story may actually mean, and I have mine too. Never having read the book, I can only base it on the context of the film (but I'm sure it's very faithful to the original storyline). I believe that at the heart of this story: there is an assertion being made; of the symbiotic relationship between Americans (U.S. foreign policy) and sociopathic behavior. Anyway, that's how I see it!

The film had excellent production values: the lush cinematography is by master ""lensman"" Henri Deca, and with music by Nino Rota. The rest of the cast were all very good too: Maurice Ronet, Marie Laforet, etc. The DVD picture and sound quality is excellent, the film has been fully-restored. PAL format, French (English subtitles), NR 113 mins.

Our second feature is a true masterpiece of the Cinema. Michelangelo Antonioni's ""L'eclisse"" (""The Eclipse"") is an existentialist masterwork that has been widely written/talked-about by film scholars, critics, and fans alike, since its initial release in 1962. What more can I add that hasn't already been said? I will say this much: Antonioni has probably given us, one of the most eloquent and poetic films, dealing with the subject of: alienation, abstraction, and the disintegration of the human-being; into an uncaring, egotistical and materialistic automaton, that is no longer responsive to other human-beings/the natural world for that matter. The film's symbolism and message is still very relevant even today (especially the part about the ever-present threat of nuclear annihilation). Alain Delon and Antonioni's ""muse""---Monica Vitti, were both simply amazing in their own way. The DVD picture and sound quality is excellent, the film has been fully-restored. PAL format, Italian (English subtitles), NR 121 mins.

The third film in the collection is a classic of its genre. Jean Pierre Melville's ""Un flic"" (""The Cop"" from 1972), is a suspenseful, psychological crime-drama. 'Commissaire Eduard Coleman' (Alain Delon) and 'Simon' (Richard Crenna) are both friends/foes on opposite sides of the law, and to make matters worse, they are both in love with the same woman---'Cathy' (Catherine Deneuve). This is a tale of deception and betrayal that, explores the unwritten ""code of honor"" and the uneasy co-existence that lies between ""police and thieves"". Richard Crenna was very good as the professional criminal and Alain Delon was suave and cool as ever. The ending of the film (really says it all), reiterated and emphasized the points of the plot that I touched upon. This an excellent Melville film. The DVD picture and sound quality is of course, excellent. PAL format, French (English subtitles), NR 96 mins.

Next up is, one film in the collection that, distinguishes itself from the rest due to its classification in sci-fi/horror. ""Traitement de shoc"" (""Schock Treatment"" from 1973 and directed by Alain Jessua), is an interesting work of its time, but its plot and storyline is even more applicable to our present state of world-affairs and conditions. I won't say anymore about this one, other than to say that it's very good, and I don't think it's available on DVD on its own (with English subtitles anyway) and in the pristine condition as it is here. So, just for those reasons alone, this a worthy and rare addition (Annie Girardot never looked better). I will tell you that the film made waves back in its day for featuring FFN from all of its leading actors! PAL format, French (English subtitles), NR 91 mins.

The last and final film in our collection, is the riveting and fast-paced crime-drama ""Flic Story"" (from 1975), which was directed by Jacques Deray. This is the real-life story of the infamous and unrepentant killer---'Emile Buisson' (Jean-Louis Trintignant), and the seasoned inspector---'Roger Borniche' (Alain Delon) that's been trying to nab him. Again, for the sake of brevity, I will just simply say that this is another excellent film depicting the similar dichotomy between ""cops and criminals"". This is an excellent Deray film. PAL format, French (English subtitles), NR 107 mins.

This collection is worh every penny, and is a must have for every die-hard ""cinephile"" and Alain Delon fan. And like I said: all the films have been fully-restored to a pristine state, what more can you ask for!

I've been thinking of and wanting to see this movie again as an adult.

1114754,5,7509006082,"I'm reviewing Le Piscine (The Swimming Pool). The setting is up the mountain from St Tropez, FR. The characters are Parisians on vacation for a month renting a villa with a beautiful stone swimming pool/terrace. Handsome Delon and lovely (sexy) Romy Schneider are together for healing - it seems Delon's character at one point in his recent past tried to commit suicide. Suddenly an old lover of Romy's arrives uninvited who's surprisingly brought his pretty teenage daughter that no one ever knew he had. Romy's Ex apparently has been showing up lately in the couple's life & it seems to Delon he's trying to split them up. Needless to say Delon is not happy when Romy invites them to stay for a few days. This awkward arrangement, where Delon seems to be left with the teenager alone, is the beginning of an interesting kind of triangle.

That is the basis of this 120 minute movie. Some say it drags at times, but I am so fascinated by the gorgeous setting and characters, that the slow casual pace doesn't concern me. Even details of meals intrigue the viewer, and you'll get a good laugh from a party that is suddenly sprung upon the vacationing couple by their guest who has friends down in St Tropez... probably to put a dent in the romantic atmosphere the couple so longed for.

If you're new to Delon & Schneider, you are in for a treat. This couple has zinging electricity together on screen... off screen the two were the hottest couple in Europe during their 4-6 year engagement which ended in heart break due to their diverging budding careers.

Think of this as purchasing The Swimming Pool and with it you get 4 extra dramatic movies by one the best actors in Europe during the late 50's to 90's. Delon is one of the most handsome & talented actors of his generation. He's the ""James Dean of France"" who didn't die - who went on to have a full career - and Romy? she is unique unto herself.",1310342400,17,1905,4.531976744186046
1114755,3,7509006082,"This collection of Alain Delon is good because it has several films not very popular starred by this French actor. The quality of DVDs is good in general with a good presentation. All DVDs are spoken in French and subtitled in English and Spanish. However, the DVD with the film ""The swimming pool"" (La piscine) has a shortcoming, you must see it with both subtitles on, i.e. English and Spanish together something that does not happen in the other two DVDs. This inconvenience should be avoided in similar collections, e.g. Catherine Deneuve.",1307577600,2,543,4.913043478260869
1114756,5,7509006082,"This BD contains TWO versions of the film: English (""The Swimming Pool - First Love Never Dies"") AND French spoken (""La Piscine""). All actors being bilingual (except Paul Crauchet, ""Inspector Lvque""), immediately after each take in French, the same take was also shot in English for US release.
(Tous les comdiens tant bilingues, sauf Paul Crauchet , une fois la prise en francais termine, on tourne la mme en anglais pour le march amricain o le film sortira sous le titre `The Swimming Pool`, BD production notes)
So what you get are actually two entire movies - not just dubbed! - which differ in minute details which are fascinating to detect. Maybe some shots without dialogue were used for either version, I'll leave that up to you to find out...
Excellent picture quality too, thank you Warner!

1114767,4,7509006082,"I bought this set because one of my favourite Delon films, Le Piscine is included. Of the five films it seems the least dated, and still conveys an imagined idyllic existence for anyone who cannot spend the summer in a large house with a pool high above the coast of the French Riviera, with or without Romy Schneider but any other icon of the era. Widow Couderc is well acted by Simone Signoret and Delon and the atmosphere of hard working farm life well established. Le Gitan is interesting, but not a film to want to watch again. Notre Histoire has an intriguing idea of presenting the lives and loves being established as stories told by the cast which may or not be as lived but as wished. Diaboliqument Votre is the flm that has dated the most. It's intriguing concept of the Delon character being brainwashed in his sleep by Senta Berger and Sergio Fantoni has less coviction than it should and the outcome is not any surprise. This spoils the involvement of the spectator unfortunately. All in all a good selection of Delon's lesser famous films from the years 1967 to 1984. One can see him mature, and develop an interest in stories that present an ambiguous moral denouement. My only disappointment is that the disc of Le Piscine arrived badly scratched as it had slipped inside the cover during shipment.",1289347200,2,1315,4.648068669527897

However, if you are a die-hard Delon fan, you will not be disappointed.  Mostly average, some are better than others.  1) ""Swimming Pool"".  If you are a fan of Romy Schneider, you will not be disappointed.  She simply radiates.  The plot moves terribly slowly.  It's a weak rehash of the ""Purple Noon"".  2) ""Diabolically Yours"".  Silly and outdated.  Senta Burger, then a popular German actress, is not in the same league as Romy Schneider.  3) ""Widow Courderc"".  This is excellent.  Almost a classic.  The film is beautiful to look at in its natural setting.  Good period details.  Great acting abounds.  Simone Signoret gives thoughtful, heart-breaking performance.  If the ending was not so ridiculously over the top, it would have been a classic.  4) ""Gipsy"".  An average crime drama, a B-film.  5) ""Notre Histore"".  This is an interesting turn for Delon.  He is actually more expressive than usual and shows a wider emotional range here.  But overall this stylized film is rather boring to sit through.",1229558400,25,1148,4.921052631578948

7899830,4,7509006082,"Possible spoilers.  Jacques Derays 1969 film proffered at least two later films, Swimming Pool (2003) and A Bigger Splash (2016).  Both wicked and provocative so I thought Id take a look at the original.  To begin with, the film has an excellent cast.  Jean-Paul is played by a very James Dean-like Alain Delon, a wannabe writer whose first book flopped.  Hes in a 2 year relationship with Marianne played by gorgeous Austrian actress Romy Schneider.

Mariannes career isn't clearly spelled out but she appears to be an entertainer, perhaps a singer.  The pair are sequestered in a beautiful chateau in the hills above St. Tropez, loaned to them by a friend.  Jean-Paul is on a month long vacation from a job that he doesnt like very much.  He still wants to write.  They seem playful and happy.  Marianne receives a call from an old friend and lover named Harry (Maurice Ronet) who is in the area with his 18 year old daughter, Penelope (Jane Birkin).  Harry had only recently known of his daughter, the offspring of a brief affair with an English woman.  Marianne invites them to stay at the home as it has plenty of room.  Much of the film takes place in or around the beautiful swimming pool where meals and drinks are often served.

Harry is a bit of a gadfly and at one time was Jean-Pauls best friend.  He has a successful career as a record producer.  Pen seems uncomfortable with her dad.  As she explains later to Jean-Paul, Harry likes to make people think his daughter is actual his girlfriend, before admitting that she is not.  Harry obviously still has eyes for Marianne, and Marianne is a perfect flirt.  But were not sure if she is just fond of him or if she is trying to make Jean-Paul jealous.  Jean-Paul plays the game well, seeming oblivious to their coziness and counters by spending time with the shy Pen who enjoys the attention.  When the booze flows, Harry becomes somewhat carefree with his language.  He takes several stabs in the direction of his old friend.  While we never see it directly, we can surmise that Harry and Marianne have reconnected sexually.  And Jean-Paul and Penelope disappear for a day in what we assume is a tryst.

When Harry returns from a shopping run in town, hes drunk and nearly wrecks his new Maserati.  He approaches Jean-Paul who is alone by the pool.  The ladies have turned in for the night.  After a few verbal swipes at Jean-Paul, Harry takes a swing but misses and falls into the pool.  Supposedly a good swimmer, the drunk Harry cant get out of the pool without help and Jean-Paul offers nothing but a shove back in.  In a scene that pushes the ridiculousness barrier, Harry cant figure out how to get to the shallow end or at least to the other side of the pool.  So he drowns.  In his haste to make it look like an accident, Jean-Paul makes a tactical error.  One that is identified by a police inspector (Paul Crauchet), but can never be proven to implicate Jean-Paul.  Marianne manages to trick Jean-Paul into telling her the truth.  But will she tell the police, even now when he has promised to go with Pen?

This is a very good movie, if a bit unconvincing at times.  It is flush with sexual longing and sensuality with an untidy mystery at its conclusion.  And begging for a Criterion remake.

A few words of caution about buying this movie.  The copy I have appears to be originated in South Korea based on the jacket cover.  It also states that the film has an aspect ratio of 1.37:1 or a full screen version.  This isn't the case.  It is actually closer to 1.66:1 and as a wide screen but appears in shadow-box format.  That is, it has black space on all sides and comes at a smaller size that fits the middle of your screen.  I don't know the original aspect ratio.  While the film is watchable it is also clearly compromised by repeated copying.  It has not been enhanced.  I also noted that the English subtitles don't always appear to be synched professionally.  That is, they appear just a bit early or a bit late and sometimes disappear quickly and in one case altogether for a couple minutes (1hr 20 min. mark).  Some of the English subtitles are also written poorly.  In any case use caution when ordering.",1485820800,,4190,4.533422459893048

It's more or less staged like a play with just few locations ~ pool, dining table, driveway. The storyline is brooding and somewhat dull, like the lead character. The actress playing the ingenue was miscast and the resolution is unsatisfying.",1472428800,,386,4.863636363636363
