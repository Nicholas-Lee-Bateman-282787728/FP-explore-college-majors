8020228,1,B0002235Q2,"This is a story of revenge.
  There is a good guy and a good gal.
  A whole bunch of bad guys.
  A nice dog.
  A cute baby boy.
  Lots of great actors.
  SPOILER ALERT
  The good guy punks out at the last minute {literally} and drives off into the sunset {literally} with the good gal and a piano {literally} leaving behind the nice dog and presumably the cute baby with grandma.
 I bought this DVD.
 Why?
 I don't know.
 One star for the terrific song ""It Makes Me Cry"" sung by Deborah Allen during the sunset credit roll.",1198368000,,523,4.163265306122449
