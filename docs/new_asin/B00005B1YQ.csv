As a student of WWII in the Pacific, I  agonized over watching this movie bearing in mind that it all happened over sixty years ago.  Other viewers need to keep the years of this war in perspective when comparing it to 21st century technology and modern movies with their stupendous special effects.  This was history as it happened, and it wasn't pretty.  One would do well to read about the ferocious battles of our soldiers, sailors, and marines in the South Pacific on such remote places as Wake Island, Iwo Jima, Kwajalein & Okinawa as well as viewing this DVD.  And for that reviewer who found the word ""japs"" offensive, you should have been there buddy, they were called a lot worse than that.  History has shown the japs were far worse than animals in how they treated our wounded soldiers and POW's, and I hate them to this day for killing my uncle.  Semper Fi.  May our boys rest in peace.",1109808000,36,976,4.505681818181818

I would have gladly chosen to take on the elite of the German Wehrmacht and S.S. before I would have signed on to take the war to Japanese soldiers.  The Japanese were tough as nails; they gave no quarter and fought on long after most soldiers would have surrendered.  They also enjoyed a home field advantage of sorts, as the American military had never fought a campaign against island chains full of jungles and the tropical diseases that thrive there.  The story of America's war against Japan is really quite amazing and should be heralded as such.  Much intense fighting took place between the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as this video makes clear.
Indeed, Payoff in the Pacific begins with the sneak attack on the Pacific fleet and takes the viewer all the way through the Japanese surrender.  Long before the D-Day invasion of Normandy, American soldiers were storming beaches all across the Pacific.  In the days and months following December 7,1941, Japan all but established its supremacy in the region.  It would take time for the U.S. to rebuild the Pacific fleet and get new recruits ready to fight, but even in 1942 U.S. soldiers were fighting the Japanese in places such as Papua and the Solomon Islands.  This video basically takes you through the American advance toward Japan, island by island, featuring impressive and telling footage of the battles - you don't get a lot of detail about each battle, but the big picture comes through loud and clear.  At first, the Americans basically tried to hold back the Japanese advance, losing many islands in the process.  As the new army took shape, however, the tide slowly began to turn.  Long and deadly fights such as the battle for Guadalcanal (which took six months) evolved into shorter and less deadly battles as the U.S. forces began to go on the offensive.  By summer 1944, the Americans were ready to take back the Philippines, and it is here that Japanese defeat became all but inevitable.  A vicious two-day naval battle in the Gulf of Leyte essentially broke the Japanese navy's back, and by early 1945 the army had taken Okinawa (albeit with heavy losses) to land itself on the proverbial doorstep of Japan.  It was at that time that the Enola Gay made her way into the history books with the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima.  After Nagasaki fell prey to a second atomic bomb, the Japanese were compelled to surrender.
The video doesn't stop at the signing of surrender papers, however.  It offers a significant glimpse at how quickly American troops went to work rebuilding the infrastructure of the nation they had just defeated.  Not only did this pave the way for a new friendship between these two formerly antagonistic nations, it highlights the character of the men and women who made up the Greatest Generation of Americans.  This video was released officially by the U.S. Army, but I don't consider it propagandistic - it may be one-sided in its approach, but this is an American film about an American victory.",1087257600,60,3180,4.780621572212066
7936905,5,B00005B1YQ,"Undoubtably propaganda, this film was produced by the United States Army, and released to the defense community, as well as to the American public.
I am not usually interested by propaganda, but since this film discussed the sequence of events of World War II, a subject I am interested in, I decided to buy it.  The film starts with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and ends with the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in the same order in which they happened during the war.  This film uses actual footage taken during battle sequences.
I would not recommend this movie as an objective look into the war, after all the government only says what they want the public to know in this fim.  However, for anyone interested in the time period during World War II, I would recommend this movie as an interesting piece of history.",1002672000,23,838,4.687074829931973
