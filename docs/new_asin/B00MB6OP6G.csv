6567401,4,B00MB6OP6G,"I like it, I wish they could release a DVD with the 10 Minute Countdown Clock. It's a great prop for that back yard drive in movie. You can play these ads while your getting ready to see the main feature. My Family enjoyed watching I will use it often. But please get a DVD with the 10 minute Animated Countdown Clock. I will buy it!",1441152000,4,333,4.0606060606060606
6567402,5,B00MB6OP6G,It was so fun watching these videos! I used it for a drive-in movie themed birthday for my hubby. He loved it and even watched the whole thing!,1431302400,5,143,4.142857142857143
6567403,5,B00MB6OP6G,It brought back good memories it was worth it,1424390400,5,45,4.111111111111111
6567404,4,B00MB6OP6G,"Most of the 'theatre ads' discs you see out there usually fall flat in the quality catagory.  This one isn't exactly blu-ray/HD quality by any stretch, but it provides for an entertaining sitting.  For those of you who like making 'programs' using the old snipes and trailers and ads presented, you'll def. find something here that will work for you.  The quality is midrange, but it's still fun",1423440000,5,395,4.779411764705882
8671345,5,B00MB6OP6G,buahahahahahaha I love this! It is really cool to see all the old ads. Bah I love this retro junk,1494547200,,97,3.9
8671346,3,B00MB6OP6G,"1 hour & 44 minutes.  The description should specify that video and audio is not remastered or cleaned up & some of it is poor quality because of the source material.  It should state they are as they found them & some ads have color issues and general bad quality picture and sound, but some ads look & sound great.  I just wanted as many ads as I could get on one disc so I could watch them or just leave them on when doing other things.  I had no problem playing it on new & old DVD players.",1491091200,,494,3.95959595959596
8671347,3,B00MB6OP6G,"Some of the clips are fun on this, but, it is not organized well on the disk. I wish it was indexed so it could be queued better. And, it doesn't have the most popular, ""Let's all go to the lobby"" on it. That was a let down. But overall, there are a lot of fun things on it.",1487030400,,274,3.6610169491525424
8671348,5,B00MB6OP6G,It was awesome.,1470268800,,15,4.333333333333333
8671349,4,B00MB6OP6G,"Some repetitive ads, but reasonably well put together. Decent quality transfers. . Was not that impressed with the trailers for movies that were included. . There was lots more info that could have been included. . .",1466640000,,216,4.864864864864865

8671351,1,B00MB6OP6G,The disc is blank. Nothing on it.,1462406400,,33,3.857142857142857
8671352,4,B00MB6OP6G,Used it on the Christmas train garden in the drive in scene. Worked out great,1454976000,,77,4.2
8671353,5,B00MB6OP6G,"Despite the many Cuts which makes some of this Skip,the rest is a Gorgeous reminder of How exciting going to the Drive-In Movies were! These were usually shown inbetween the Double Features,and features still available brands of Food! 146 Minutes of the Drive-In Intermission Ad Reels in all! Also,Movie Trailers are scattered both within the Ads and a Bonus Section,too,has these! Recommended for those Who want to Relive those ""Glory Days""! Almost No ""Intermission Clock"" Segments but they are there!",1450137600,4,502,5.2875
8671354,4,B00MB6OP6G,I wish it had the let's all go to the lobby video...I can't seem to find it anywhere but this is cool to see back then what was the crim de la crim.,1445212800,,148,3.515151515151515
