8122337,1,B000FGJT0G,"Yes, 9/11 was an inside job.

No, you should not buy this movie because of over a dozen factual inaccuracies that were brought to the attention of the producer in 2005 and ignored.

He got the year of the Kenya and Tanzania bombings wrong.

He got the amount of deaths, the month, and the name of the bomber of the 1993 WTC bombing wrong.

He got the date of the USS Cole bombing wrong.

He got the CIA director's name at the time of 9/11 wrong.

He got the name of the ""Let's Roll"" United 93 hero wrong, calling him Scott Beamer instead of Todd.

He got the date of the beginning of the WTC construction wrong.

He mentions a ""mysterious explosion"" from WTC building 6 immediately after the second plane hit and show a huge smoke puff coming up from the ground not realizing the picture he's showing was actually the south tower collapsing.

He gets one of the plane's flight numbers wrong.

He confuses the ""mastermind"" of 9/11, Khalid Sheik Muhammad(KSM) with Khalid Bin Mahfouz, who was supposed to be one of the original hijackers but was denied entry to the U.S.

This is without a doubt, one of the worst ""9/11 Truth"" DVDs out there.  I brought all these factual inaccuracies to Humphery's attention in 2005 only to get a rude letter of scorn in response.  His refusal to change these facts and his choice to keep selling this bogus film demonstrates his apathy towards informing people with correct information and proving he's only interested in making a buck.

George Humphreys simply doesn't know what he's talking about and, to my knowledge,  has not once participated in the 9/11 truth discussion since releasing this half-assed film.  If you want good facts about 9/11 Truth, I urge you to steer clear of this factually inaccurate film.  It's a huge embarassment to those of us who have dedicated the last 10 years to getting the facts of 9/11 CORRECT and out to the public for all to see.",1289779200,6,1903,4.566371681415929
8122338,5,B000FGJT0G,"It's a well put dvd and very informative. I had a buddy of mine give me a high 5, which I'm sure would have been 2 high 5's if he would not have been working. I loaned it to him and he's going to watch it again. I have seen it at least 6-7 times already and pick up something new everytime. All we have to do is discern, and the truth will set us free. There are very cruel and evil souls out there that have already sold it to Satan. There are no if, ands, or buts. If we don't pay heed, this country will be a has been unless we wake up and stand up for it and claim what our Lord intended when he created us. Freedom from sin of this world he wanted for us, and not following the evil one and being enslaved and bondage with his wicked schemes.",1269820800,,747,3.825806451612903
8122339,5,B000FGJT0G,"For many years I have been researching all the 9/11 info and DVDs that I can lay hands on, and ""The Great Illusion - End Game of the Illuminati"" DVD by George M. Humphrey rates in the topmost ratings along with those of Alex Jones, Eric Hufschmid, Dylan Avery and a number of other avid gov't. crook whistle blower researchers who have spent untold hours gleaning out the REAL TRUTH verified by documented facts. After viewing each one of these well-researched and documented videos they ALL seem to bring forth some new and proven, finger-pointing evidence that WE The AMERICAN SHEEPLE were and continue to be TOTALLY scammed and hoodwinked by the media brown-noser, spin doctors and the mendacious gov't. crooks whom we have quite sadly been responsible for having elected to their despicably all too powerful controller  puppeteering status when SO MANY of them are traitorous scum bags in sheep's clothing purporting to be the good guys while lying through their teeth!",1174780800,9,973,4.969325153374233
8122340,4,B000FGJT0G,"I read the review given by someone here about this documentary. I do agree that it is more of an audio narrative with mostly stills and is done a little less professional but that is not what is important here. The reviewer forgot to even mention the stark and shocking real facts being given about this event. This was the whole messgage behind the film. The visuals are merely aids. There are tremendous facts given to make even the most skeptical realize something was not as we were told about what happened on 9-11. Everything the author reveals can be backed up with research to be fact. Why the reviewer did not even get this is beyond me! It is factual and makes a very clear point as to whether you feel it was the illuminati (new world order) or not, it illustrates a very clear intent of lies and cover up by our officials behind the events of 9-11 not on just one level but numerous, numerous levels. He just doesnt make one illustration of this but dozens and dozens of them. It is a worth while film to listen to and watch. America needs to listen to this message...",1157760000,7,1080,4.378109452736318
8122341,2,B000FGJT0G,"This almost two hour long documentary is made up narration accompanied mostly by still photographs. We get to see the second airplane hit the World Trade Center and the narrator tells us that immediately when he saw it on TV, he knew the Illuminati was behind it. The film then points out fifty or so facts that contradict the official story of what happened. The conclusion is that the 9/11 attack indeed was an act of the Illuminati in order to gain control over the world.

Indeed, there are many strange circumstances around the 9/11 attacks that still needs to be further investigated. There seems to be things we haven't been told, but the conclusion that the Illuminati is behind it is not even close to proven in this documentary. It's just the usual conspiracy theory. Yes, we can conclude that the oil people in the Bush administration had something to gain from it all and they might have known things they haven't told us, but it doesn't mean that they did it. The purpose of terrorism is to cause fear and conflicts among the enemy, and from that point of view, the 9/11 attacks have been tremendously successful. Americans fight, at least verbally, against eachother and the retaliations from the Bush administration has caused opposition against the United States to grow. This would be a victory to islamist extremists and others violently opposed to the United States (not because - as some would say - The US is the ""world's greatest democracy"", the ""land of the free"", etc., but because of their violent foreign policies of the last half century). Much of the information in this film has been pointed out by others, such as Gore Vidal and even Michael Moore.

The film is apparently based on a pamphlet, and is even referred to as such by the narrator. This is one of the film's problems. It's not really a film at all and could be ""watched"" with your ears. The proper format for this would have been as an audiobook. Overall, the narrator doesn't do a very good job. He does not even try to sound objective. Then there's the quotes by various people, which are read by a different person who reads them in funny voices and mock-German accents. It makes the whole production feel very amateurish.

After the film has made its point, the narrator goes into a long sermon about how we should all live our lives without fear, love eachother, smell the fresh air and believe in ""the creator"". I can do without that sort of preaching, thank you very much.

Overall, this is a rather bad, very unprofessionally made film that brings up some important issues but also makes too many far fetched conclusions and ends up preaching at you. It's not really worth it. It would probably be more interesting just reading the leaflet it was based on, or listening to it as an audiobook, without the preachings and funny voices.",1152057600,10,2832,4.669338677354709
