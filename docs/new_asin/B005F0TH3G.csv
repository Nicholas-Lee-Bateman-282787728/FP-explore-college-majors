4670241,4,B005F0TH3G,"No Reservations Collection 6, Pt. 1 features episodes from season 6 starring Anthony Bourdain.  The set contains some special style episodes that Mr. Bourdain has been doing in recent years including the Techniques episode in which world renowned chefs like Jacques Pepin, Thomas Keller & Scott Conant show basic food cooking techniques that every home chef should learn to master.  The show also features Mr. Bourdain's visit to Eric Ripert's Le Bernardin in which he observes fish butcher Justo Thomas carve his way through a 1,000 pounds of fish in six hours (this scene is beautiful written about in Mr. Bourdain's Medium Raw book).  Food Porn 2 has Mr. Bourdain getting all lathered up over charcuterie, sausage and sushi with some hilarious interludes featuring Ron Jeremy.  The Caribbean Island Hopping episode features some gorgeous locales and makes you completely envy Mr. Bourdain's job.  The Hudson Valley episode ends with an interesting interview/lunch with Bill Murray.  Harbin China shows a snowy land that one would never associate that type of winter living with China.  Heartland is a great show where Mr. Bourdain tries the restaurants of Middle America while on a speaking tour that most foodies on both coasts would probably never enter into their minds to even try.",1322611200,18,1288,5.163461538461538

Panama - An you thought it was only rough during Operation Just Cause.

Istanbul - A place that should be on everyone's bucket list.

Prague - Got to love Eastern Europe.

New York Hudson Valley - There is more to the Empire State than the Big Apple.

Ecuador - More than just guinea pigs.

Harbin, China - Not Hong Kong.

Maine - Don't think just lobsters.

Food Porn - Could have made a better bonus feature.

Caribbean Island Hopping - Gotta love Island life.

Heartland - Could have covered more - the heartland is big.

Bonus Features - not much of a bonus.",1381795200,7,617,4.371681415929204
