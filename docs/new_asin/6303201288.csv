592503,4,6303201288,"Four Saloon Gals (Madeline Stowe, Andie MacDowell, Mary Staurt Masterson & Drew Barrymore), who demand avoid Pinkerton Bounty Hunters (Led by James Russo) Sadistic Outlaws after one of them kills a Ordinary Citizen in Self-Defense.
Directed by Jonathan Kaplan (The Accused) made a Action-Packed Western. A bit different from the Usual Westerns films. Strong role by Stowe. Fine Performances by the Rest of the Cast. This was a Box Office Disappointment but it`s gained a Cult Following on Video. Action Fans wouldn`t want to miss this one. Grade:B+.",1012262400,,549,5.25

We girls love to watch these liberating film.  It was in the same genre as Thelma and Louise, Boys on the side, and Charlie's Angels.  Mary Stuart Masterson and Madeleine Stowe were really good.

Whoever would enjoy this really enjoys suspending  disbelief above and beyond the call of duty.  My imagination is pretty good  and even can't imagine this ever being a good film.

592508,4,6303201288,"This movie, Bad Girls, provided an up close and personnal view of women not as the stereotypical house wife, but as outlaws, as a contradiction to the international degrading view of women.  This is something different,  new in a sense, and therefore, good.  The acting involved is great all  things considered.  Think otherwise, you try and do better.  Yeah, Sandra  Bullock would have been great here, but that's ok, we'll make do w/ Drew,  Madeline, and Andie, right ?  :)",931910400,3,475,4.8375

592757,4,6303201288,"I had thought that I would not like this film. The TV gave it only two stars which denotes movies I generally do not watch. But I like westerns and decided to give it a chance. I am glad I did. I enjoyed it.  While the four women in this film are prostitutes who were driven out of town because of their profession and because one of them killed a man who was trying to kill or at least maim one of the four, there were good reasons for their behavior. As the film develops, we begin to like these women. We begin to understand why they became prostitutes, why they had no choice in the matter, how they were forced by circumstances in their lives to sell their bodies for money.
As the film develops we see how one of them was treated so badly we almost applaud when the culprit is killed.",1482105600,,790,4.12987012987013

592886,4,6303201288,"This is the second DVD release of the movie. The menu is pretty decent this time around, with motion scenes and music. 4 well known actresses come together to basically do a female version of ""Young Guns"". They are all prostitutes in a city where it seems they are not really well liked by most of the citizens. One day, one of them gets roughed up by a client, (Madeleine Stowe) comes to the rescue in defending her friend after the client pulls a gun and starts firing at her. She defends herself and shoots him dead. With no lawyer or ""trial"", most of the citizens or residents there in the saloon see this and immediately take the woman to be hanged for the crime of murder all the while the drunken sheriff doesn't know what is going on.
A friend of hers comes riding into town on horseback and basically frees Stowe's character and they ride off out of town. Later on, the other two join them, leaving the ""cat house"" behind. They try and form a plan as to what they want to do next. Stowe's character tells them that she has put away a good sum of money, over 12 Thousand dollars in the town's bank. But, they have to go back and get it. That's when things get ""dicey"". While in the bank, an old accomplice of ""Stowe"" comes in with his cohorts and proceeds to rob it, guns drawn and all. The 4 then have to formulate a plan to get her money back from her former colleague in crime while dodging the Pinkerton's out to get her for the shooting death at the saloon in town.
I would say this is a decent movie, for me anyway. There is lots of action, and the gals seem to have good chemistry on screen.
Drew Barrymore looking lovely, bares her chest in a few scenes, but not full frontal.

The movie is in the ""Extended Cut"", widescreen, good menu, good Dolby Digital 5.1 sound.
The only ""Special Feature"" on here is the Theatrical Trailer of which the DVD description above says it isn't. It is on here though in the main menu.",1460764800,3,1932,4.278688524590164

592999,4,6303201288,"Bad Girls is a 1994 western film starring Madeleine Stowe, Mary Stuart Masterson, Andie MacDowell and Drew Barrymore. It was directed by Jonathan Kaplan from a screenplay by Ken Friedman and Yolande Turner.  The story follows four former prostitutes on the run following a justifiable homicide and prison escape, who later encounter difficulties involving bank robbery and Pinkerton detectives.

Of course, a Hollywood Western with lovely ladies. However, a good script and our stars were all young and very profesional. Ms. Stowe plays her part with a lot of emotion and the rest of the cast is excellent. I have the feeling that the lady actors had a lot of fun doing this movie, I would have paid to be in it.

I love this movie. There is a couple of rough scenes in it. Drew Barrymore is one of the 4 girls. They are whores in a old western town. Cody kills the Coronel, for roughing up Anita, another one of them and the town is going to hang her but her 'sisters' rescue her. They are on the run, stop at a bank that holds a large amount of money for Cody and while they are there the Pinkerton's show up and before the Pinkerton's can get them out of the bank, Kid shows up. Kid is from Cody's past and he is an outlaw. He steals Cody's money along with robbing the bank and leaves the 4 girls and rides off. 3 of the girls get away, one is put in jail. There is another guy in the story who joins them for a while and he also rescues Drew's character for Kid who has kidnapped her for trade for his father from Cody. Yeah, I left some facts out but you'll have to watch the movie to find out what has happened and what is going to happen. I don't like the violence in this movie but I do like the movie. Enjoy!

593250,5,6303201288,"Maybe there's a lot that's fun in this film.  Maybe it's subtly manipulative, or not too good for women or for the left-wing, either.

But I think it should have focused a lot more on the Drew Barrymore character and a lot less on the other characters.  They should have made it basically about her.  She is pretty good-looking in the part when she wears that dress and tries to distract the jailer by showing him her legs, so they could have had her wear something like that in a lot more of the movie and doing stuff like that or stuff that looks like that a lot more.  They shouldn't have had her get captured by the bank robbers, either.

There shouldn't be quite so much very serious or upsetting stuff in the film.  They kind of focus on the guys a little too much, like they're trying to show how cute they are.

Since it's anti-historical in the first place to have women gunfighters in the old west, they should have just gone a little further with this and added some sci-fi elements, made it into a weird west story.  But they shouldn't have made it overbearing and made the film basically about the sci-fi elements, it should have been more like nice touches to the story here and there that make it more interesting.  I'm thinking of sort of a space western thing like Cowboy Bebop, like maybe, what if an alien civilization had come to Earth in the 1800s and given humans super-advanced technology so that old west towns were like space weigh stations where extraterrestrials could show up all the time, and cowboys could sign up to go on outer space missions.

We get to see Madeline Stowe, Mary Stuart Masterson AND Andie McDowell all in one film!  I've never cared much for Drew Barrymore, but I concede she does a pretty good job in this movie.

Madeline Stowe still looks good today, but this movie was made in 1993, when she was @ the very apex of her beauty.  On top of being gorgeous & having a ""mystery"" about her (which intoxicates me so!) she is also a bona-fide accomplished actress.  It's great to see her go from a naieve woman in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS to being a tough-as-nails, no nonsense cowgirl in the present flick.  She is a much more diverse actress than most women in Hollywood.  Now if only she'd agree to a candlelight dinner with me.....

Anyway, this DVD has often been thought of as a female version of YOUNG GUNS.  Well, perhaps.  However, in my mind, BAD GIRLS is the far more entertaining of the two (I found YOUNG GUNS rather boring).  Also, one nice thing about the film is that it is NOT a film that's just set about to glorify male-bashing. While it does set about to accurately depict examples of unfair treatment of 19th century women, it never becomes ""preachy.""  Moreover, our cowgirls stumble across some nice fellas who help them out.

If you like westerns, you may or may not like this one.  If you like un-conventional westerns where the main characters are pretty girls (not too many other movies can compete in this category), then this movie is a must. It was filmed in Texas and California & some of the screen shots had gorgeous scenery and a few of the sets really made me feel like I was back in the old west.",1172361600,9,1771,4.370030581039756

593610,4,6303201288,"that's how I view this movie... beautiful and popular actresses, lots of action, and a not-to-bad story line.  This is one of those movies you can put in during a party and it's entertaining for any short amount of time people choose to look at it... and if you do decide to sit down and get into the movie, it makes it that much better.",1166400000,,337,4.184615384615385
593611,5,6303201288,"I love this movie. It's not a glamorous or super action packed, but it does show a great deal of the hardships a woman had to deal with in that time. Back then women were seen as nothing without a man by the public and the law, so this show shows you how the women end up where they are and how they end up becoming stronger then even society ever thought they would become. Makes you want to buy a horse and go for a ride.",1156291200,,423,3.8735632183908044

593613,3,6303201288,"I really like both Madeleine Stowe and Drew Barrymore and really had high hopes for this movie, but frankly the storyline is weak at best.  There is just no plot.  Still, Stowe gives a great performance all things considered and I don't think I've ever seen Drew Barrymore look hotter.  Worth renting, but maybe not buying, at least not before you've seen it.",1136678400,,359,4.666666666666667
593644,4,6303201288,"This movie does not pretend to be a serious effort in film making.  It's a funny, not so serious movie that's eye and mind candy.  Think of it as Charlie's Angels set in the 1870's.  Madaline Stowe, Andie McDowell, Drew Barrymore play whores that are run out of one town and are trying to make their way to another.  Along the way they run into Stowe's ex boyfriend who was not so kind to her before and even worse now.  It's escapist fun and I recommend it heartily.",1125878400,15,467,4.261363636363637
593645,5,6303201288,"I've read the reviews of this film on this website, and one claims this film is like ""The Wild Bunch with women"", and another one says ""It's a female 'Young Guns'"". I wouldn't say that about this film, I think this is an underrated gem. This film is entertaining and the actresses (especially Drew Barrymore) do a great job in this film. If you are a fan of westerns or a fan of any of the actresses, check this film out. You can find the DVD of this film in the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart.",1120176000,9,485,4.11578947368421

Since I am a huge western fan and live close to the badlands, I absolutely love how it captures how the old west was. If you love westerns this is one for you.

593650,5,6303201288,"Bad Girls is my all-time favorite movie. Okay, some of the plots are a tiny bit lame, but what can you expect from a Western? I find this movie to be a fresh look at Western style movies, with strong females using any and every card they have to do what they want. It also has a cast of amazing actors, most that are getting more successful with time. If you like action-packed movies and powerful women, buy this movie!",1024272000,7,420,4.2625
593651,5,6303201288,"I am a western lover and BAD GIRLS is one of my favorite movies.  I have never seen anything like it since westerns usually are shown from the male perspective.  It's about time we get a great female western, especially told from the perspective of prostitutes.

593652,1,6303201288,"Everyone knows about the Blacks-ploitation films of the Seventies. Well, this is the same rot but exploiting the chick flick genre. How could such wonderful actresses demean themselves by appearing in this terribly written, terribly directed film? Don't be fooled into thinking it's anything close to a strong woman film--there's gratuitous violence, rape, women being humiliated, one scene contrived just to show us Drew topless. None of the characters had any depth. The storyline itself made no sense. If you have a brain, you will kick yourself for watching this. If you want to give someone a lobotomy, force them to watch this",1017705600,7,632,5.145631067961165
593653,1,6303201288,"Is this country so starved for a decent western that we have to sit through this steaming cow patty to find it?  In the first few minutes, four prostitutes leave town in a frenzy after one of them kills another's client in hooker defense.  I don't have any character names, because this all happens in the first ten minutes without any background to who the characters are or their relationships to each other.
The women escape and go for a pie in the sky dream of running a lumber mill in Oregon.  Enter James Russo, Madeleine Stowe's former beau and current outlaw.  He takes all of Stowe's hard earned money.  She works hard for her money...so hard for it, honey...  Dermot Mulroney of the ""Young Guns"" series happens by to flirt with the ladies while seeking his own revenge.  The rest of the film consists of at least three of our five heroes getting capture and disappearing, then the others riding to rescue them.  Three times...they shouldn't have quit their night jobs.
The four leads are pretty and beautiful and buxom and nothing like the Old West's real soiled doves.  The quartet could have stepped off a Ralph Lauren fashion runway.  For a more realistic portrayal, try either ""Unforgiven"" or stupidly titled ""The Wicked Wicked West"" with Kelly McGillis and Brenda Fricker.
You know the routine in this kind of film, the bad guys lose, the good girls (or is it bad girls?) win.  Director Kaplan apes the late great Sam Peckinpah, throwing in slow motion scenes.  Unlike Sam, Kaplan uses slow motion for no motivation or reason, just to do it.
Except for Mulroney and James LeGros, all the men here are pigs who are just holding these poor women down.  A great feminist statement that is ironic in a film that dumped its first female director in favor of Kaplan, who decides we cannot get through the film without a couple of glimpses of Drew Barrymore topless.  Girl power!
This is not a good western, your first clue is the five different writers listed in the opening credits.  All involved have done better, and you would be better off checking those out instead.  ""Bad Girls"" are bad in more ways than one.",1014595200,5,2124,4.63903743315508
