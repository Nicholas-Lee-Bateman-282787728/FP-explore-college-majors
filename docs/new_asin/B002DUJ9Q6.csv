3913074,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Babylon 5 was one of the best television series ever in the medium. Taken for all in all, it was the best SF/F show ever on television.  This was because it didn't dodge the big questions:
Who are we?
What do we want?
Where are we going?
It made the big questions the central focus of the series.  It didn't always provide clear and succinct answers to them either.  It also made things very much like they are in the real world.  Impure or evil motives might lead to actions with overall good outcomes, and good intentions may well pave the road to hell.
J. Michael Straczynski is the reason is stayed focus on the large themes. JMS created the series and wrote all the episodes of the session, as well as all the 4th session episodes.  He was specifically looked to create myths that addressed the big questions in life.
You can't address the big issues without acknowledging the reasons that most people stop thinking about them: the minutia of life often makes us focus on little things that often don't bear on the larger issues. JMS wrote the series in a way that the big questions came into line with the little issues of life.
His focus also allowed for characters to grow and change over the course of the series.  For example, Vir, a character that starts off as a basic comic-relief player, yet ends up as one of those who can speak with great wisdom.  The third session was when this change in him became evident.  Also, the characters are not all perfect examples of morality and heroism: they each have their strengths and faults.  This makes things much more believable.  Especially since much of the underlying stories of good vs. evil is rather fanciful.  In order to make it all believable is requires that there are underlying things that make sense, so that the home viewer can grab a handle on the program in order to anchor the rest of the story.
The normal human issues of alcoholism, drug addition, religion, family problems, bad marriages, etc. all get explored in the course of the show.  Which adds to the believability aspects of the program.
Many other shows with similar takes on the world of character development have been ""St. Elsewhere"", ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Buffy: The Vampire Slayer"".
The acting in the show is normally good, with especially good performances by Andreas Katsulas as G'Kar and Peter Jurasik as Londo Mollari.
The first season is very rough, with about half the shows from it being almost bad at times.  The second season things got a lot better. The third session of Babylon 5 is probably the best of the five sessions the program was on the air.  But the fourth session was very close in quality to the third.  The fifth was weird... very well made, and at times very well written, but in the end the 5th season was about the same in quality as the second.  Which would have been fine if it had come before season three and four.
One of the minor overall problems with the show is that, although clean and succinct answers are not always provided, they are sometimes forced in when they shouldn't have been.  I am sure that this was not the intention all the time of the shows creative force: JMS.  It is just that it is expected in TV land that they be provided.  Basically, I am sure they were sometimes added because TV executives probably insisted on them.  Especially when the message sometimes is that ""there is no clear message"".  Which, at times makes the show feel a little clunky.
I know that my criticism of this sounds almost like I am contradicting myself.  And that may be the problem with it in the show... maybe the show is contradicting itself in some ways.",1081036800,14,3628,4.549230769230769
3913075,2,B002DUJ9Q6,"B5 had an interesting yet unoriginal premise for a show. The acting was nothing spectacular and the plots needlessly elaborate. The makeup and sets were decent. However, the extreme use of action sequences (which were brilliant no doubt) took away from the story. Better to watch Star Trek (Original, Next Generation or DS9) where the characters and plot tell the story. Or the X-Files for Earth-based sci-fi, or Hercules or Xena for fantasy.",1080777600,,442,5.068493150684931
3913076,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"I will be brief.  If you ever take the time to watch and experience the entire story of Babylon Five, you will come to the same conclusion others have:  It is the greatest sci-fi story ever brought to screen.  It will leave you thoroughly satisfied yet wanting more.",1080518400,11,266,4.5
3913077,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Yes, Babylon 5 is the best sci-fi show ever produced.  No doubt in my mind.  It simply is.

Season 1 starts slowly.  Mainly because the show was not written by J. Michael Straczynski (series creator) but by outside help. Result: Lousy B-movie scripts.  Only 5-6 episodes are truly good.

But then Seasons 2-5 arrive, and the series truly shines.  This is the CORE of the Babylon 5 story.  J.Michael Straczynski took the reins and wrote ~95% of the show.  AND IT SHOWS.  Seasons 2-5 start with battles, end with battles, and have plenty of drama in the middle.  A new race called ""The Shadows"" starts pulling strings, manipulating the characters, and ultimately spinning off a war.  And just when you think all is dark and dreary and depressing... all hell turns loose!  The drama just builds and builds and builds.

And then we have... THE GRAND FINALE TO THE NOVEL FOR TV: Set 20 years in the future, this single episode will bring tears to your eyes, because it shows the death of the hero: President Sheridan.  As series creator J.Michael Straczynski wrote:
""The sad truth is that we die. That is not a happy ending, not a sad ending, simply a fact. The question is what we accomplish during the days and months and years preceding; do we leave the world a better place or a worse place? If we have left the world around us a better place, as these characters did, then it's a happy ending. - - - - - Ultimately, for me, the end of B5 is neither a sad ending nor a happy ending; I'd say it was a graceful ending, a dignified ending, an ending that said individuals can effect profound change, if they are willing to put their own lives and happiness on the line; not happy, not sad, but a testament to the idea that you have used your time here well.""

""What interests me, what I wanted to do with making this show, was in large measure to examine the issues and emotions and events that precede a war... the effects of the war itself... and the aftermath of the war.  The war is hardware; the people are at the center of the story.""  Well said Mr. Straczynski, and thank you for creating this wonderful show. Like a classic novel, Babylon 5 reaches beyond mere entertainment. Thank you.",1079222400,42,2190,4.459798994974874

3913138,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Put simply, this is IMO on of the greatest TV shows ever created. A highly engrossing political space drama that captures the spirit of what it means to be human through the eyes of aliens. It simultaneously explorers the meaning of life while making the revelations of such meaning palpable. Some of the lines delivered by G'Kar have been the very foundation of my own moral integrity and character. Watching this show as a young man I failed to truly appreciate it was but I was smart enough to remember the feeling of wonder it gave me and be so totally incapable of fully understanding the depth of what I was watching. Many years later after completing the entire series and movies many times over I can honestly say that no other TV show, movie or book has ever compared.

As they say, ""They don't make them like this anymore"".

G'Kar - ""If I take a lamp and shine it toward the wall, a bright spot will appear on the wall. The lamp is our search for truth, for understanding. Too often we assume that the light on the wall is God, but the light is not the goal of the search, it is the result of the search. The more intense the search, the brighter the light on the wall. The brighter the light on the wall, the greater the sense of revelation upon seeing it. Similarly, someone who does not search, who does not bring a lantern with him, sees nothing. What we perceive as God is the by-product of our search for God. It may simply be an appreciation of the light, pure and unblemished, not understanding that it comes from us. Sometimes, we stand in front of the light and assume we are the center of the universe  God looks astonishingly like we do!  or we turn to look at our shadow and assume all is darkness. If we allow ourselves to get in the way, we defeat the purpose  which is use the light of our search to illuminate the wall in all its beauty and all its flaws, and in so doing, better understand the world around us.""",1480032000,,1939,4.315934065934066

There are some scenes where the picture quality is pretty bad.  Again, not a problem with the DVDs because the original video hasn't been restored to 21st century quality.

Other than that, it's great to go back and watch this epic space opera.

3913180,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"In case you're wondering the significance of the title of my review, it refers to this wonderful series which can appeal to all ages. B5  has something for everyone-for the younger set there's plenty of exciting aliens, monsters and space battles.  For the older set, myself included, there is drama, humor and suspense.  I can't stress enough the superb writing on the series.  Most importantly, is a continuing cast of characters that you grow to care about.  As the Narn ambassador, G'kar,  explains to another in season one, ""nobody is quite what they appear to be.""  Like in another favorite series of mine, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, characters who start out being  minor, or insignificant, end up becoming something quite else  characters who may initially appear of one personality, will change as social and political events change.  There are the inevitable comparisons between B5 and Star Trek, and for fans of both series, endless hours can be spent discussing them.
 When I was growing up in the 1960s, there were two science-fiction series of a similar theme that ran on the airwaves - Star Trek and Lost In Space. TREK  was considered to be the ""adult"" Sci-fi series, while LIS was for ""kids of all ages"".  I believe today the comparison can apply to both TREK and B5 - BABYLON 5 (and similarly, Trek : Deep Space Nine) is Star Trek for adults!
Finally, and just to reiterate the title of my review, I'm currently re-watching  and experiencing on a whole new level, BABYLON 5, with my mom, who is 88 , and just LOVES the series!",1463702400,,1542,4.726591760299626

3913186,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Remembering back to 1994, (1993 if you count the pilot movie), when the Babylon 5 series began, it was a time when the majority of televisions where large bulky cathode ray tubes. With that being said, J. Michael Strazcznski, launched an ambitious sci-fi project where the imagery on tube was being projected in the letter box format, rather than the image filling the screen, as with all the other television programs of the day. The story had a continuous storyline which lasted for 5 seasons, 7 movies, plus off shoot programs. Babylon 5 had intelligent writing, good visuals, plus characters you could care about. That is what makes this box set a good choice. Plus, with Hugo winner Harlan Ellison as a creative consultant, how could they go wrong?
I give this box set (B)-5 stars..
It was a great program then, & still holds together well now.",1460073600,4,849,4.743243243243243
3913187,3,B002DUJ9Q6,"Great show!  Crappy DVDs.. terrible encoding of the digital effects.  WB seems to think in the day and age of digital programming they can STILL get away with charging for content which is highly popular and keep it locked behind a pay wall.. for a series that is 23 years old!  Don't get me wrong I LOVED Babylon 5 and watched every episode when it aired between 1993 and 1998.  It was revolutionary in that it was planned like a novel, with a 5-year story arc.. and each episode moved the plot further along.  TOTALLY unheard of in 1993!!  Now we take it for granted since every show has followed the success of Babylon 5 and does the same.  I bought these disks 6 years ago, and have only re-watched 3-4 episodes.. the quality of the disks and the encoding onto DVDs is THAT bad.  I'll never purchase another Warner Brothers product again.  Do yourself a favor and buy the whole series on Amazon Prime instead.  Since WB will never release this 23 year old product to Netflix.. even though it would make a killing on Netflix.  Please someone buy the rights from WB!!  We want to see this wonderful show unfold once again in front of a whole new generation of B5 lovers!  Not looking forward to trying these disks again after 6 years after reading comments here saying that they won't play at all anymore after sitting in their cases untouched.  Typical WB packaging and cost cutting to make a buck I suspect.  Do yourself a favor... DO NOT BUY THESE HERE..  purchase on Amazon Prime instead.",1459382400,3,1494,4.4981412639405205

The extras are a bit sparse, but the handful of episodes with cast commentary are still a lot of fun. MJS is pretty hard on his work in this show when he's doing commentary, despite what an accomplishment it is.

I'm glad to finally have this series on my shelf.

For those wondering: ST:TNG had a full, multimillion dollar re-do of ALL the cgi effects in order to get released on blu-ray. The original effects, like those in B5, were recorded on SVHS and would look absolutely awful in hi-def. Whereas Trek has the following and can command the production costs, B5 doesn't and can't. Standard Def DVD is likely the only digital release we'll see of this show.

This is a great value. Get it, because holding out for hi-def like I've been for years now is, as Capt. Mal says, ""A long wait for a train don't come.""",1449014400,2,1009,4.322751322751323

3913235,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Babylon 5 is the best science fiction series that I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them; all of the Star Treks, and many others. Why?

It was (and is) well thought out and plotted out fully in advance. Michael Strazinsky (check spelling) knew what was going to happen in the fifth year before he filmed any part of the first season. The earliest episodes contain hints about things that will not happen until the fifth season.

Babylon 5 has more continuity than the other shows, especially when compared to the two main Star Trek series, TOS and TNG. Facts established in early episodes remain facts in later episodes. This is unlike Star Trek TOS which, in its last episode, ignored the fact that Spock had mind-melded for specific purposes in earlier episodes. When asked, he said that this was the first time.

Voyager comes closest of the Star Treks to having continuity, because it started with their getting lost, and ended with their finding their way home, but the adventures along the way had no related continuity. Deep Space Nine comes third in continuity, especially during the Cardassian Wars, but again, there were many individual episodes that ignored that continuity.

If you have trouble getting into Babylon 5 Season One, try starting with Season Two. In comparison, Season One is very slow and Season Two more action-packed. Because of where I lived, I didn't discover Babylon 5 until Season Two, and it didn't bother me at all that I missed the first season, because I knew I'd eventually see those episodes, and I did.

I was so into this series, I purchased the seasons as they came out, $75 per pop, because I wanted to vote with my wallet to make sure that future seasons would also be issued.

Michael was more than willing to take on controversial topics, even Jesus Christ.

I more than highly recommend this entire series to you.

3913236,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"One of the greatest science fiction series of all time. Graphics are a bit dated but the plot and characters are incredible! Several plotlines are complex, yet never overdrawn and can last over several seasons (especially the Sinclair saga). I don't believe anyone has ever handled time travel in such a complicated fashion and actually pulled it off and made it seem probable. Give it at least a handful of episodes and if you find yourself interested, you can't go wrong with the entire series. Season 5 is a bit of an ""add-on"" but still quite good.",1435449600,,551,4.690721649484536

I am embarking on watching this series for the 3rd time now that I own the DVDs and I could not be more excited.  Don't let people tell you the 5th season is bad.

The special effects are somewhat dated but they were very good for their time.  The series held its ground against some of the sci fi heavy hitters of the day and it has aged gracefully.  The writers/producers did a wonderful job integrating a continuously running story line into the series from start to finish.  As the title says, it is the story of Babylon 5.
The dvd production is good but I'd like to see it in blu-ray someday.  If you are a fan of sci-fi, I highly recommend this series.",1433894400,2,699,4.464566929133858

3913252,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"I saw all the B5 episodes in the 1990's when it was on, but had forgotten a lot of the story.  I have always enjoyed B5 and especially have found the G'Kar/Mollari story arc to be the most powerful.  I love watching G'Kar transition from a dubious ""villain"" at the beginning of the show to a spiritual figure/writer at the end of it.  Mollari's story is far more tragic, and he has to live with the ""Drahk"" creature in him after he becomes Emperor.  Before that happens, however, it is very cool to see the forgiveness and friendship that finally happens between G'Kar and Mollari in the last two seasons.  My favorite episode was the one where Mollari helps G'Kar to free Na'Toth from the Centauri prison.  The whole transition of Londo and G'Kar  was beautifully done, with the characters hating each other so horribly in the First Season to tolerating each other in the middle and then at last becoming friends to the bitter end.  Vir is also one of my favorites, as you see him go from buffoon to humanitarian to Assassin of Emperor Cartagia to being the Centauri Emperor himself at the very end.  The characters absolutely made B5 the great show that it was--they were all fabulous, but there are too many arcs to mention them all here.  I also liked the Sheridan/Delenn relationship, and of course, Garibaldi.  I'm still enjoying the episodes many years after the show ended.",1432944000,,1381,4.6419753086419755

3913268,4,B002DUJ9Q6,"Beware, spoilers and my opinion below. That's right, that is all that it is, my opinion.

First, if you are a fan of the new Battle Star Galactica, then please do not waste your time with my review.  I am not a fan of that show, like so many other reviewers of this Babylon 5 series are, here on Amazon. I am not here to debate this subject as this is about Babylon 5. However, you are welcomed to find my Amazon review on Battle Star Galactica. Therefore I will not be making any comparisons to that show like others have. Instead I will be comparing Babylon 5 to: Star Trek TNG and Star Gate SG1. In my opinion both those shows are some of the best TV series science fiction, ever. Next, if you judge a twenty year old show buy its special effects then you are wasting your time reading this as well. I watched this show based on its story, and good acting, not early computer graphics that's twenty years old and special effects. I am smarter than that, not an opinion. Last, why I am now reviewing Babylon 5 twenty years later? Because this show requires serious episode by episode commitment. This will be discussed later.

The Good: a. The writing. When the writing was good it was as good as some of the best of Star Trek TNG and Star Gate SG1. Babylon 5's Second season's, Comes the Inquistor was as good as TNG's, The Inner Light, and First Contact or SG1,s, Window of Opportunity. All Classic science fiction.

b. Aliens that we got so involved with that we cried for them. GKar's humiliation at being in chains and being tortured was very emotional and Londo getting even with that spokesperson for the shadows and Vier getting his wish were outstanding. Some of the best TV acting I have ever personally experienced.

c. My biggest surprise was Mr. Chekov, or Walter Koenig. I am not a huge fan of Mr. Chekov from Star Trek and I remember thinking ""Oh no"" when I first saw him as a guest star on the first season of Babylon 5. However his performance and continued performances as the slimy Bester was on the order of Leonard Nimoy's performance as Mr. Spock. So dark was his performance that I soon forgot all about Mr. Chekov. Outstanding Mr. Koening.

d. When the acting was good it was very good. Some of the best on TV. However some of the actors were picked for their model like, good bone structure looks and those people were not so good. This is the price you pay when demographics dictates that we must use sex to make the show a hit. For many this is not a problem but for me it is.

Now for the bad and the many reasons I could not give this show the 5 stars it really deserves. Because when it stunk, it really stunk.

a. There is a complete lack of discovery and the adventure of discovering new and bazaar Aliens and deep exploration of the galaxy or universe. In Babylon 5 we know all the Aliens and they know us. If something is discovered or new is found, it is brought back to the station only to find out that what ever it is, that an Alien race they already know about built it and there goes all the mystery. It took me awhile to put my finger on this but when I did I realized how much this kept the show from being one of the best science fiction shows I have ever watched.

b. Unnecessary and silly fighting. Do not get me wrong I love a good fight (The Matrix) but when it goes on for no logical reason and people are jumping around doing these flying kicks then I become bored.

c. When the acting was bad it could be really bad. This gets back to d. under the good, like I said, you pay a price by using sex.

d. When the shows were not good they could be bad enough that you were ready for the next show. The first season really stands out but you must watch all of the first season to know what is going on.

e. You must watch every show, every season to completely know what is going on. If you have a very busy life like I do then that becomes a problem. I can see why this show had a hard first year. Then they throw in a new commanding officer the very first show of the second year. It took me at least 4 episodes to get use to him and when I did I really liked him but all that is hard on the viewer and can be very timely. This is why it took twenty years for me to watch all 5 seasons. thanks to DVD's and the public library.

In all Babylon 5 was a positive viewing experience. The show has good strong moral stories and the word God is spoken without fear on this show. But if you do not have faith in any God (Mr. Gerabaldy) then that is cool to. Good over comes evil and the show makes you feel good. Military people might enjoy this show as it is the military that is in charge of the station. Some language is used that might not be suitable for the smallest of children but over all good family viewing. Highly recommended",1428192000,,4779,4.170281995661605

I love Babylon 5 and this boxed set has a bunch of extra material that comes with it. There are extras, deleted scenes, and commentary. I definitely felt like I was getting my money's worth.

3913318,4,B002DUJ9Q6,"I had no problems with playing these.  They ran smoothly.  I watched them all, right away, after having heard there were some problems with play.

As to the content, having watched these while they were on television, I knew what I was getting into.  The shows get better, mature, through the series.  Always some Hollywood idealism, leftist political notions creep in like bugs from time to time.  It looks like cast and crew where hashing some of it out?  Especially in the first season or two, though expect to be belted with it from time to time throughout.  Still, fairly decent.  As far as sci-fi goes, it's probably as good of a series as I have seen.",1415404800,,658,4.555555555555555
3913319,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"I love great sci-fi and came to the Babylon 5 franchise late in its original run as a TV Series.  By the time I found Babylon 5 the plot had pretty much unfolded the characters had established roles and the cult following had formed.  But hey this was good science fiction and I am not one to leave if I come in on the middle of a great series.  What I saw of Babylon 5 those many years ago I loved so I brought the whole series.  Now I am in the process of watching every episode of Babylon from beginning to end.  The quality of the video transfer is not great it is not horrible but on a quality 55 inch screen the images look very grainy and not sharp at all.  the DVD's are watchable so I would give video image quality a 7 out of possible ten in quality.  Audio quality fades at times so again it gets a 8 out of ten in quality.

All the disks are in very nice cases and I have yet to find any defects in disks.  Many others have shared what the babylong 5 experience is so I won't be adding to it.  I simply share with you that the Babylon 5 complete season set is worth its price.  Remastered to the blueray standard of most execelent quality this complete series would be perfect but, if you want to relive the Babylon 5 experience now this full TV series set is worth watching even with its less than perfect video and audio quality.",1414195200,2,1343,4.068441064638783
3913320,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"This show had the effect on me in my 40s, of wonder and magic and mistery and exitement, that I hadn't experienced since I was a little kid, when works and shows of fiction and scifi would blow my mind and send my imagination flying into a vast, intriguing universe.
The complex, adictive characters evolve throughout the seasons. The story arc begins to take momentum untill it explodes into a galactic war. And all the while the threat of totalitarian regime on Earth creaping up  over a few seasons. But from the first episode to the end this show is full of ideas, soul, philosophy, heart... B5 is magic.
 I love this TV show.",1413676800,,630,4.517543859649122
3913321,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"This is one of the more obscure Sci-Fi series that isn't all action. While there is unrest in deep space and plenty of space ship batles, there's also a lot of character development and cultural backdrop intermingled with unexplained mystical happenings. It's a little like X-Files meets Star Trek while going on a religious pilgrimage.",1412985600,,336,5.127272727272727

3913323,5,B002DUJ9Q6,My only regret is that someone has not yet done a serviceable digital conversion on this wonderful TV series that just predates the era of HDTV. Straczynski was a fearless innovator.  His vision of a space station where myriad alien species converge and convene a deep space United Nations style consortium was carried out with style and finesse.  Outstanding costumes.  Ambassador G'kar's character was played by an internationally famous Shakespearean actor.  The entire cast deserve Emmys.,1411603200,,492,5.434210526315789

3913326,5,B002DUJ9Q6,I've loved Babylon 5 ever since the beginning.  This is my 4th time watching the series.  My last watch was about 6 years ago on my VHS.  I had to buy the collection because I don't have a VHS!  But now I have the DVD collection and the VHS collection.  The VHS is in a box in my storage locker.  I hate to throw them away; I wish I knew what else I could do with them.,1410220800,,369,3.727272727272727

3913348,4,B002DUJ9Q6,"The story line it's self is really good. Though I must add, the Special effects, does have a bit to be desired. Since the Series was made in the mid 1990's and the FX wasn't as good as it is now....I guess I can't complain too much.",1403654400,,232,3.9574468085106385
3913349,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"I've been a fan of Babylon 5 since it first premiered, and once I saw the complete series on DVD for a discount I had to pick it up. The show IMO really ushered in a new phase of sci-fi, not only using comouter generated effects but also being one that had a true beginning, middle, then a true ending. If you are a fan of sci-fi then owning Babylon 5 The Complete Series is a must. The special features on the seasons start off with an introduction to the season, some commentaries on a couple of episodes, and the final disc of a season contains information to help you get better acquainted with the shows alien races, technology & the station itself. This is the same for every season. The only downside is the special effects look a bit rough, but if you set your picture to Standard it will look great. I hope one day WB will release a new version with more commentaries & updated effects but for now I'll take this. Definitely worth the money & time!",1403481600,3,957,4.292817679558011
3913350,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Babylon 5 was the show my parents watched after they'd sent my brother and I to bed.  Once we were older, my brother and I were allowed to stay up and watch.  We taped every episode on VHS and would go back and watch them.  Babylon 5 was my childhood - and what made me fall in love with SciFi.

If you love the 90s, science fiction, or political-themed shows, then this one is for you.  I can't recommend it enough.  I'm re-watching the seasons again - and have watched them countless other times.  Who needs Deep Space 9 when you have B5?",1402963200,,540,4.184466019417476
3913361,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Babylon 5 the series was one of my favorite TV shows growing up. My dad was a huge fan and we were both puzzled as to why this series never aired again. It appears they only did one run of the series on DVD. So when I saw this, I had to snag it as a Christmas present.",1400457600,,268,3.6379310344827585

3913363,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"I'm a lifetime fan of science fiction literature and the original Star Trek.  Babylon 5 simply took science fiction to a level never previously seen on television.  The depth of the plot and the exploration of ideas and themes alone would have justified a five star rating, but it was paired with acting, casting, sets, music that were cinema quality.  The one dated element is the CGI imagery, which, while state of the art for its day, shows its age -- but I never let the 1960's model work get in the way of enjoying Star Trek, and the B5 CGI work is well above that.

One day, I might hope B5 will get the same updating and restoration that the old Star Trek got -- if the CGI effects were updated, the series could be released on Blu-Ray, which I would cheerfully buy.  But don't let that hold you back -- buy it and watch it!",1398729600,,831,4.267515923566879
3913364,5,B002DUJ9Q6,This program series came to mind a while ago and I remembered enjoying it but missed several episodes because of late night scheduling in my area. The picture and audio quality of the discs is outstanding and it was a joy to see all the episodes commercial free. My only complaint was that the disc holders break free inside the cases very easily and are VERY difficult to put them back in place. An oldie but a goodie worth adding to the collection for any sci fi fan.,1395100800,,469,4.340909090909091

3913367,5,B002DUJ9Q6,B-5 is more addictive than Star Trek and this whole set keeps the shaking down to a minimum. It's cheaper than therapy.,1394409600,,119,4.454545454545454
3913368,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"First and foremost this is a fantastic story with a 5 year arc and it does have a satisfying ending.(no spoilers from me) There are a few quirks from a DVD production stand point. If closed captions are important to you the First Season leaves a bit to be desired. The timing is off and the dialog incomplete. The following seasons seem to be spot on however. From a production stand point the quality improves with each subsequent season. By the the end of the second season and on, your hooked on the storyline and characters. This is a must have for all Sci Fi  fans and and a worthy addition to any movie collection where great stories, and great character acting is appreciated. Highly recommended.",1394323200,,703,4.579365079365079
3913369,3,B002DUJ9Q6,"The staging of B5 doesn't wear well in an age of production values like those of Battlestar Galactia.  Watching B5 feels like sitting in the audience of a sitcom.  The lighting, grouping, and acting are very much 1970s television, which is a shame given B5 was made much later.  But at least the aliens don't all rely on forehead prosthetics ala Star Trek.  If you've never seen it, it's worth watching.  Shame it won't be done on Blu-Ray, though, as the SD compression here doesn't stand up well on a 65-inch screen.",1394064000,,517,4.576086956521739

3913374,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"I had the good fortune to see a fair number of Babylon 5 episodes when the series first aired in the mid to late 1990's, so about 7 months ago, I decided that I wanted to view the entire Babylon 5 canon.  I've just finished watching the entire five seasons of the television series (with the several feature films mixed in, where appropriate), and can safely say that, in my opinion, this is the best science fiction series that has ever been produced.

As with any series, some episodes and story threads are more compelling than others, but overall I felt that the characters and character development, plots, subplots, and production values, were all superb.  Ultimately, it's ones ability to empathize with the various characters that makes the viewing experience an unforgettable one.

Although there are other sci-fi series that I have really enjoyed over the years (especially Stargate SG-1, and to a lesser extent some of the Star Trek iterations), I have found none as interesting or emotionally compelling as Babylon 5.  There were some episodes that caused laughter, and others that brought me to tears, and I was especially moved by the final episode of Season 5.

I am not quite finished with the saga, as I still have the Crusade series and Babylon 5: The Lost Tales - Voices in the Dark to finish, but I would unequivocally recommend Babylon 5: The Complete Seasons 1-5 to, anyone who considers themselves a science fiction fan, and also think that this series has the potential to convert those who have never previously cared for science fiction.",1389830400,9,1563,4.835205992509363

3913378,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"I loved this series for all the things it did differently than everybody else.

1. It tackled the monumental task of creating a universe with as diverse a background as Star Trek and Star Wars with an ease during the first season that astonished and impressed me.

2. This was one of the first television series to take advantage of a modern day, video recording, audience. After the introductory season one, it pretty much abandoned the traditional, hour-long one shot episodes that prevailed through much of the 60's, 70's and even into the late 80's and early 90's. Instead, there were ongoing storylines that could - and did! - eventually explode in a blast of dramatic television unexpectedly during key episodes.

3. Some of the alien characters are fearsome. But it is the ones who look almost ridiculous, that in the end, can turn out to be the most bloodthirsty and who do the most damage.

4. This is an astonishing, wonderful television series. If you love science fiction, or any deep and penetrating story with intelligent dialogue, then Babylon 5, the short-lived Crusade series, and its associated movies are just what you're looking for.

5. In my corner of the universe, Babylon 5 aired very late at night, right after Deep Space Nine. I considered it a double treat, recording both for next day viewing.

Babylon 5 taught me, as with books, not to judge a story by its cover.

I watched it... and LEARNED.",1387670400,,1423,4.760162601626016

The makers of this show accomplished something truly remarkable and memorable despite a relative shoe string budget as well as plagiarism and lack of support on the part of paramount studios (many key concepts of deep space 9 were straight up ripped off from B5 like the entire series being based around a space station, shape-shifting, etc.). I say this as huge fan of star trek overall too, but deep space 9 itself completely soured my stomach and wasn't even a good rip off (if you're going to steal ideas from someone you should at least have the decency to do it well).

3913403,3,B002DUJ9Q6,"I admit I did not really watch Babylon 5 in the '90s when it was brandnew and came to it only after having enjoyed Battlestar Galactica (the 2004 series), which aired ten years later. So, although I agree is somewhat unfair, I cannot but compare the two shows and in this comparison Babylon 5 really does not look all that great. This is surprising in a sense, as the show had the great advantage of having a story arc more or less written out from the beginning as the project was planned from the first day on as a five year-running program (much to the amusement and disbelief of television connoisseurs at the time). Unfortunately, this advantage his hardly recognizable in the show, as plots all too often unfold in a way so incredibly stupid that they insult the intelligence of the audience. As a reviewer before me had already pointed out, one of the many examples for a terrible plot would be when Commander Ivanova tricks ""an ancient alien species that had lived for billions of years before, and is supposedly advanced in all ways and unbelievably complicated"" by using a reverse psychology scheme that a six year old would have easily seen through. Even major story arcs get abruptly terminated. For instance, we follow through season after season how the Shadow War unfolds and eventually escalates, culminating after four years in a full-fledged war between the Shadows and the Vorlons, both incredibly far advanced, powerful races, threatening the end of the universe. Until Captain Sheridan solves the problem by telling them to leave. That's right. I sat in my chair speechless.

But even if one can suffer through the bad writing, it is even harder to tolerate the abysmal acting. Even I would have been a more convincing John Sheridan. Hell, I even would have made a better Susan Ivanova. And those two still give really stellar performances compared to Dr. Franklin or Zack Allan. Of course, it is also not exactly helping that essentially all the human characters on the show are insufferably one-dimensional, predictable, and boring. I will not start a comparison of these characters to their strong, charismatic counterparts on Battlestar Galactica. Babylon 5 could only lose. BIG TIME!

So, why do I give the show three stars then instead of one? Well, it is the aliens. While the human characters on the show are so embarrassingly dull and almost cartoonishly stereotypical that they appear to the viewer like aliens, the ""true aliens"" on the show are actually involved in exciting plots, have strengths and flaws, and develop so believably that they actually seem human to us. Another reviewer had pointed this out earlier and I could not agree more. G'Kar and Londo Mollari alone are worth watching the show. Each of them alone is fantastic but how they interact with each other is just brilliant. They start as irreconcilable enemies, then learn how to work with each other, yet take the first chance to destroy the other, eventually rise above themselves, offering forgiveness, and will nevertheless kill each other eventually. Also many of the other aliens on the show are great. Vir Cotto is adorable, Na'Toth is fun, Lennier is great (, although the writers manage to destroy that character in the next to last episode). Always when the aliens were in the focus of the show, I liked it.

Also, the show was quite revolutionary at its time, which is easily forgotton when we look back at a TV program of the '90s. Long story arcs that would span many episodes or even seasons were extremely unusual at that time and almost nobody back then believed that this could work on a Science Fiction show. Moreover, Babylon 5 was pioneering with the extensive use of CGI visual effects. It is probably not exaggerated to say that we would not have had Battlestar Galactica without Babylon 5 paving the way. If that were the only success of the show, I would be grateful already.

In summary, I have mixed feelings about this show. At times it was extremely exciting and I could hardly stop watching. At times I got so frustrated, I wanted to throw the DVDs out the window.",1378252800,,4094,4.794617563739377

3913446,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"I've purchased the seasons elsewhere, over time, and I wanted to express my admiration and respect for the show here. To be fair, I am not a fanatic, but a sincere admirer.

When I first saw ""Babylon 5"" in the 90s, I was a kid and never really follow it. I've enjoyed a few episodes here and there, but then, while in college of early 2000s, I watched the re-runs, starting from the beginning to the end, and I am going, ""wow."" The show felt like a combination of science fiction and politics in the future along with religious/spiritual subtexts, and it became one of my favorite shows.

This show is set between the years 2258 and 2262 when Earth becomes a unifying ""Earthgov"" along with the colonies within the solar system, which makes up what's called the Earth Alliance. Since they discovered the hyperspace and met the Centauri, they became one of the dominant civilizations beyond their own civilization. Many decades later, the space station Babylon 5 was created around the year 2256, some two years before the first season (there is a pilot movie that took place about a year before:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Babylon-5-The-Gathering/dp/B000255LMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Babylon 5 - The Gathering</a>) - the fifth number is the number of the stations, with all previous stations were either destroyed or disappeared. The new station is located in the orbit of the planet Epsilon III.

The first season takes place in the year of 2258, and Jeffrey Sinclair is in charge of the station. This is the only season with him being one of the main characters on the show. This season seems to be focusing on him as he discovers his past and his disappearance at the ""Battle of the Line"" and the reason for Minbari's surrender. Other stories involved Ambassador Delenn before her transformation into a Minbari-human hybrid in order to make connection between Minbari and humans, emerging conflict between the Narn and Centauri, and the insidious activities behind the closed doors on Earth.

Season Two begins the year 2059 after Sinclair been recalled to Earth for re-assignment and the infamous Captain John Sheridan has been assigned to be the military governor of Babylon 5. Sheridan is proven to be strong-willed and incorruptible. The friendship and the trust between him and his command staffs is growing, as well as his emerging relationship with newly-Minbari-human hybrid Delenn. A tension develops between the command staff and the Psi Corps. The on-going conflict between the Narn and the Centauri. An ancient race known as ""The Shadows"" is behind the many mysterious and disturbing events throughout the season and coming to the surface from their hibernation. Unaware, Centauri Ambassador Mollari enlists their aid to attack the Narn homeworld. Towards the end of the season, Pres. Clark and his administration begins to develop the characteristics of dictatorship, controlling and restricting freedom of speech.

The third season starts the year 2260 and is appropriately named ""Point of No Return."" It's also the beginning of the war with the Shadows and the war with the Earth Alliance. The phrase ""Point of No Return"" refers to the martial law as declared by Pres. Clark and the B5 command staff had to make a toughest decision: an independence from Earth. The season further shows the conflict with the Shadows and the Narn-Centauri conflict. This season shows last appearance of Jeffrey Sinclair and we'd see his important role in the overall picture.

The Season 4 begins the year 2261 (""No Surrender, No Retreat"") and is my favorite season. It takes place after the supposed ""death"" of Cap. Sheridan on the Shadows homeworld and his miraculous return. It is a year of wars and their ends. Not only Babylon 5 command staff is fighting the Shadows, they turn to face the Vorlons as well. Top of that, they are fighting the war with the Earth Alliance while Delenn is struggling with the sudden civil war between the Warrior and Religious castes on Minbar.

This season begins the credit of each episode with several characters speaking one line at a time:

""It was the year of fire...the year of destruction...the year we took back what was ours. It was the year of rebirth...the year of great sadness...the year of pain...and the year of joy. It was a new age. It was the end of history. It was the year everything changed. The year is 2261. The place: Babylon 5.""

They were pretty powerful words.

The last season is the year 2262 with a new commander of the station, Captain Elizabeth Lochley, while Sheridan is the new President of the Interstellar Alliance. I see this season as an ""aftermath"" of the previous season and more dealings with the main recurring characters than the new people. This season focuses on the conflict with the rogue telepaths as the station serving as a sanctuary for them. We meet the new darkness, called The Drakh, former allies of the Shadows who remained in the galaxy and working ""behind the scenes"" on Centauri Prime. The end of this season would show each of the characters' next journeys.

""Sleeping in Light"" is the final episode of this season, which is one of my favorites and the most saddest.

There are a lot of themes and stories that I found interesting, especially free will in regards to the Shadows and the Vorlons. Also, sacrifices, dreams, war and peace, and struggles for normalcy/peace. Not only that, I actually admired the consistency of times and events that connected together throughout the show as I felt the plots are remarkably strong and cohesive.

My favorite characters are Sheridan and G'Kar. Sheridan is something of a rising star and a legend as he has what it takes to do what needs to be done. After the Earth-Minbari War, he commanded the ship ""Agamemnon"" as its captain on a number of missions over the years until he was re-assigned as a governor of Babylon 5. From that, he became the first President of the Interstellar Alliance before turning his focus to leading the Anla'Shok in his final years. I often found myself admiring him and Bruce Boxleitner did an excellent job in this portrayal. And, G'Kar is equally interesting and holds such a powerful influence. He begins as an angry warrior and later turned to being religious, from hating to befriending an enemy. Throughout the show, one can see a great deal of changes in G'Kar on the most primitive level and that is something that interested me as well the relationship between him and Londo. Andreas Katsulas did an admirably remarkable job portraying G'Kar. I was saddened to hear about his death (along with the death of Richard Biggs, who played Dr. Stephen Franklin, the death of Jeff Conaway, who played Zack Allan, and the recent death of Michael O'Hare (2012), who played Jeffrey Sinclair).

Overall, I truly loved the show and the stories as I often felt that there's wisdom involved (I admit to frequently quoting G'Kar from time to time). Comparing it to other sci-fi shows, I felt this is to be one of the best shows, hands down.",1364169600,,7052,4.930075821398484

3913456,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"I'm a devoted sci-fi fan, but when Babylon 5 first came out I was uninterested, being a Trekkie. My stepson, however, convinced me to watch a few shows in succession and I became hooked. Never has there been a show with so few stand-alone episodes. Any little detail in any show can mean a lot later. The show's nuance and subplots add to the fascination. The B5 movies and novels offer enjoyable side trips in the story. There are a few places where I would have written a line differently but who care's? B5 became a family event in our house because the show's continuity, character arcs and themes of love, sacrifice, honesty, bravery and forgiveness left us all feeling uplifted. Of particular significance to me was the way loss was portayed and dealt with. B5 will make you laugh and cry. When a show is good enough to speak to me on a spiritual level it becomes part of my collection. The CGI and sound are wonderful and trend-setting. I can't say enough about the cast! Suffice it to say that they're an easy bunch to fall in love with. B5 is a work of art from beginning to end and I would reccommend it to anyone with an open mind and well developed attention span. Hopefully one day this show will be remastered and offered on blue ray.",1356480000,2,1248,4.430434782608696
3913457,3,B002DUJ9Q6,"I'm glad the show ran for as long as it did, but honestly I don't understand why. It's not a bad show, especially considering that we don't get a lot of good Sci-Fi on TV, but it wasn't great.

There wasn't a single plot in Babylon 5 that didn't look like Swiss cheese with huge holes in it. The writing wasn't that good either and neither was the acting. The only character that I really-really liked was Londo Mollari and maybe Vir and G'Kar. All the other regulars were just OK at best. If it wasn't for Londo and the remarkable performance of Peter Jurasik, I probably wouldn't watch it at all.

On the other hand, if they removed some characters (namely Delenn, who was annoying to the extremes) early in the series, the show would become much more watchable. All the ""philosophy"" needed lots of trimming too. It became very repetitive and very predictable very soon. ""I fight with a sword, you fight with a heart"" -- come on, we got it! You didn't have to say the same thing over and over and over again! Argh.

And also, what's with all those irrelevant and extremely annoying subplots in almost every episode? At least they should've made them funny or somehow interesting. Instead, they were shallow and plain horrible. I fast-forwarded all of them, because I quickly realized that they added nothing to the storyline and they were absolutely painful to watch. I should probably mention the Minbari designed uniforms too, but I don't really care about that, even though they were a complete fashion disaster.

It is still an OK show, but I doubt I'll be watching it again.",1355184000,,1581,4.615658362989324

3913463,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Babylon 5 is an outstanding series, one of the best among all groups, not just Sci-Fi.

Compared to other Sci-Fi TV series I believe it to be the best.

I have watched just about every real Sci-Fi series, except the some of the newer ones that are actually in the horror category.

I was a great fan of the original Star Trek series, I fell in love with the actors - the ""special effects"" were simply a very thin layer of icing on the cake. I probably enjoyed the last of the series line, Star Trek Enterprise, the most.  I know that series got bad press, it did not help that the first episode was on the same night as the Super Bowl, however, the studio executives ignored this - for some reason, and it seems they wanted Enterprise to fail, may be a little subversive actions among the studio execs?

The story arc of Babylon 5 is massive.  With the budget constrictions handed to J. Michael Straczynski, the music and special effects felt some impact, however, the special effects were very good for the time and are still compelling to this day.  Within those budget limits, acting, arcing story line, wardrobe, number of extras, and environment were and are all very good to outstanding.  Regarding acting roles, there is everything from love to hate, including misunderstanding, confusion, sprinkled with just enough subverting to make you want to choke an actor.

I have told my wife that if a good actor can create strong emotions within me [the audience], then they are doing a great job.

My few words compiled with the rest of the reviews here should provide a great understanding of Babylon 5 to just about anyone.

Only a few years ago this series brought almost 3 times the amount of money to purchase as it does today.  If you watch this series four hours a day it will take you many days to get through it, and, because they are linked, once you get started, you will not want to miss a single episode.",1344211200,,1919,4.498559077809798

3913465,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Back when this shows first season came,I thought it was a DS 9 rip-off. I was a Trek loyalist who thought only TREK could give good SI-Fi. Thank goodness for my neighbor,whom I grew up with , who lived across the street. He told me to watch the beginning of the seocnd seasona dn give it a try for a few weeks. During that time, I was sorta warming up to it until we got to the episode about the Shawods. After that episode I was sold. Not only did B5 have TORN as its main lead actor, I had a new type of ""badguy"" . Those who watched the series will understand by the middle of series 4 what I mean .

Each week after I was indoctrinated deeper and deeper into the series. I was there to the last episode and like other reveiwers ahve said small things come back later on to have meaning. That is truly good writing.

Besides Doctor Who, Babylon 5 is my favorite Si-fi handsdown. Stargate was fun to watch and exciting , so was Atlantis , but B5 man B5 was a experience to behold.

For those watching this series the frist time, I would say this. Series 1 is sorta painful . Going back to it after all these years, and knowing what I know is to come, I will say its fffffffaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrr better than my first watching. It really is when you watch it a second time around. But the first time your gonna grin your teeth and  shake your head a lot. Just be patient ... Things will get better.. MUCH MUCH better. Once you hit series 5 ""Sleeping in the Light"" have a hankie ready as you will see old friends returning for one last goodbye and even a old enity :). Along the way you will see folks who at first were ""badguys"" become ""goodguys"" . You will even ahve sympathy for a person who makes all the wrong decisions for the what that character believes is the right reason. You know what, you will still lvoe the character also.

Just give the show a try. Remember its from the 1990's ok. Some CGI won't look that great. But its the story that counts and this show could hold up against almost anything out there today. Oh hell after writing this review, Im going home tonight just to rewatch the show again.",1343260800,,2111,4.2024691358024695

Simply the best science fiction series of its time if not the best SF series of all time. Special effects may be getting better, but not acting. B5 had superb acting, three-dimensional characters, intricate plots, and surprises galore.  You really got to love some of these characters and what they believed in.  Yes, it's space opera, but it was also great science fiction in its own right.  Why buy the DVDs?  I have watched this series multiple times, in sequence, and you pick up plot details that you miss the first time around.  This is truly a very rich and textured series.

3913470,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"When I read the basis for B5 I thought it sounded like a ripoff of Deep Space 9. So I didn't watch it for the first several years. When I did, I was stunned by the great characters and awesome visual effects. I wanted to see the story from the beginning. This set gave me the chance and I've watched it through twice. Still love and think this is  the all-time best series ever on television. The obvious reason is that the complete story was written before filming ever began. That's why the first year ties in so well with what follows. Those who thought it was disjointed should have seen it all the way through and then watched it again to pick up all the minor details they missed.

The acting and storyline became more sophisticated as the series progressed. I would say that the greatest value of having the series is not having to wait a week to see what happens next. If you watch 1 or more episodes a day, the story moves very quickly and the suspense is greater.",1332460800,3,973,4.311475409836065

3913474,4,B002DUJ9Q6,"Fascinating, sometimes maddening mix of wonderful and silly, intelligent and dumb, insightful and obvious.

At it's best it's the 'Wire' of science fiction, challenging 'Battlestar Galactica' for intelligence and emotional depth. At it's worst, it's like an OK episode of 'Lost in Space'.

Generally far more intelligent than most TV sci-fi (or recent sci-fi films for that matter), with stories based more on ideas than laser
battles. In that, it's a little reminiscent of the original 'Star Trek' series.

The most interesting thing; this was an early case of a series having a pre-planned multi-year arc, so throughout there are sometimes intentionally confusing or mysterious details that return to be finally explained as having great importance a season or two or three later.

On the other hand, because this preceded the acceptance of truly serial cable shows, each episode is more self contained than more recent shows in a sometimes annoyingly neat way.

The show is also full of allusions; Shakespeare, the Bible, Buddhism, King Arthur, the Koran. Certainly the writing is grounded in pretty heady stuff. Of course, sometimes it's dealt with in a pretty heavy handed way.

The setting is a space station that's sort of an intergalactic United Nations. In season 1, some of the acting is so stiff, that it brings the series down. Also, the effects, production design, etc. all reflect a budget that's clearly way too low, giving it all an amateurish air. None-the-less, I found myself caught up in a number of the episodes, both emotionally and intellectually. One even brought tears to my eyes. And the layering in of deep mysteries to be only slowly solved gives it a sense of deeper meaning and arc.

Season 2 brought in some stronger cast, and somewhat better effects. The stories in season 2 continued to be a mix, mostly quite good, a few great, and some subplots that were to be honest, dopey. But overall it remained pretty riveting, with lots of interesting allusions to history
and philosophy.  And it was great to see characters that seriously evolve as the show goes on.

Season 3 was a roller coaster of good and bad episodes, with the best --suddenly making sense of obscure things from season 1 -- simply
brilliant, and other episodes just acting as filler.  And that may be the series' biggest problem. If this show could have been 12 episodes
a year instead of 22, as is the case with most current serialized series, there would be a lot fewer episodes that felt lacking in substance, as if the show were just marking time.

Season 4 pulled off the neat trick of having the series feel like it answered it's whole core question that gave it a reason for being, only to replace it with new story lines just as rich and strong. Again, it was episode to episode how interesting and germane the stories were.

One running problem of the series, the villains tended to be a little 'Snidely Whiplash', complete with black costumes and deep scary voices.
It got a little better as the series went along, but I wish the 'bad guys' were a little less cartoony.

Season 5 also bumps up and down, but in the end I was quite moved by it all, and will miss this series, with it's willingness to allow tragedy
to befall characters we like, and a sense of the complexities of politics and life.

I wish it was even more consistently great, but - in the end - it was more than good enough.

P.S. To echo what others have written here, be careful with the special features.  They sometimes have a nasty habit of acting as spoilers and giving away plot twists to come.",1313193600,3,3577,4.717495987158909
3913475,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Babylon 5... This series is a life-changing artwork, it's scope, majesty, beauty, optimism, spirituality, it's just stunning..

The CGI art is no longer up to date now in 2011, in the 90-ties however it was state of the art CGI, and more important the storyline, the acting, the towering scope of the epic science-fiction. Babylon-5 is -and will remain- unique and setting the standard how a really great science-fiction series is to be made. Today there is a dangerous pessimistic view of the future, due to the global crisis, 9-11, global warming etc. This is why B-5 is so precious, so important, to show a future of hope, of greatness, of beauty and glory. Micheal Straczynski has added all the elements, technology, spirituality, hope and glory, and warmth. This is how the future should be... It's wonderful to see how subtle and intelligent this epic series is made, and how surprising, the Shadows seems evil, the Vorlons good, but in the end the evil has good aspects the good has evil aspects, the clash between the cosmic giants is a towering culmination of the 5 years... And finally, closing the 5 year epic.. the death of captain Sheridan, his wife Delenn filled in tears watching the sun coming up in Tuzenor at the planet Minbari.. Sleeping in Light, a hint there is Light beyond death visualized by this incredible scenes.. It's hard to describe in words, but ANYONE who wants a great future, hope, and opposes the negative """"Zeitgeist"""" of today should buy the entire series. Let's hope and pray a sequel is coming, series like these are urgently needed in this dark, gloomy decade...My warmest thanks to the visionary director of B-5 Micheal Straczynski , and all the people involved in this magnificent sci-fi artwork living in your imagination for the rest of your life..

3913476,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"The central theme of the show was that a galactic United Nations for the purpose of keeping the peace between aliens and between aliens and humans was set up by Earth, known as Babylon 5. In actuality, the theme, or perhaps I shold say a subsidiary theme, was a religious one in so far as each alien race's religion is presented; the creator of the series did not promote any one religion, human or alien, but seemed to state that religion---in whatever form---is good. Each race, it becomes very evident throughout the series, has both its good and evil citizens. The special effects, acting, and plots were excellent and things really pick up when the Shadows appear, which serve as a catalyst for all the other aliens and humans to band together to defeat them (as in the Nazis during WW II). In the background hover the Vorlons, just as evil as the Shadows, but much more subtle.",1306281600,,883,4.594936708860759

3913478,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Two space opera's have made it into my affections in different ways. The Traveller RPG speaks to my desire for a baroque, and labyrinthine setting. Babylon 5 is detailed enough, as detailed as TV can get. But what it really speaks to is the desire for the mythic.

Babylon 5 is a truce city in space, similar to Istanbul or Geneva during World War II. There multiple factions compete for power until a great danger forces them to cooperate for survival.

The characters are splendid, from the regal Delenn, to the cultured and devious Lando, to the loud and obnoxious G'kar. Most of them have a touch of nobility and almost all have a dark side as well. I think Delenn was my favorite character. Outwardly she seems a fairy queen, but one can tell that she is in many ways hiding beneath the mask of Duty and Honor. She has an intense desire for romance but her desire to do her job well keeps that in check. She has a mystical and charismatic air to her and is something of a Space Joan of Arc. Lennier was also well done; a meek servant trying to live up to the demands of an honor culture.

The human characters are not so striking but they are good enough. Marcus Cole was the best of the humans.

As for the villains, the Shadows were the creepiest alien race ever to enter tv sci-fi. The Vorlons give their own special chill by their pretended benevolence.  Mr Morden is a character one loves to hate.

The concept, of writing a long serial epic for tv was a good one and the advent of DVDs made it work better. Korean TV had several historical epics. Babylon 5 takes this concept into the Space Opera genre. It has a mythic style of cosmic struggle tied in with ominous prophecy and foreboding. It is not so much SCIENCE fiction; science plays a minor part in it. It is epic that happens to take place in space. This was tried by star wars but star wars never quite got it right, Babylon 5 did.

It's biggest weakness was the Deu ex Machina that solved the Shadow War. Of course it is hard to defeat ""gods""(or Sufficiently Advanced Aliens) without a ""machine of the gods"" but it was rather a disappointment. I don't know how I could have done better though.

Babylon 5 is a splendid work and well worth getting.",1297382400,,2218,4.366504854368932
3913479,4,B002DUJ9Q6,"I was(am) a fan of DS9, but the more I watched B5, the more I like it better. Many times DS9 seemed stiff. By this I mean the interactions between the characters, it didn't flow. When you watch B5, it seems to flow, the character interactions much smoother, more natural. also, B5 is quite funny, DS9 was never that way, the characters way too serious. B5 reminds me of Star Trek the original series. It was humorous. The interactions between the characters was natural. (I was more moved when Sheridan and Delenn said goodbye in the end than when Dax died. Even my wife got a little teary eyed watching the episode with me, and it was the only episode she ever saw.) They had funny moments between Kirk, Spock , and McCoy, and always the same tune played during those moments. None of the other ST series ever had any of those qualities. I can only conclude that like TOS, B5 was the underdog of sci-fi shows, so they had fun with it, they enjoyed themselves in the production of the show. None of the other ST series other than the original ever seemed to come across has having fun.

Eventually I noticed that the format was not that of a movie or a novel (as the author and many fans tend to suggest), but rather of an epic (or rather as close to that of an epic that we get in these modern times).  It's not ""Casablanca in Space,"" but rather ""The Mahabharata in Space"" or maybe ""The Illiad in Space.""

The basic premise of the series is that a space station which has been built to be essentially a futuristic version of the UN and has a mission to prevent war becomes in essence a nexus for the coordination in the greatest war in a thousand years.  The series lasts five seasons and (like the Mahabharata) includes a prolonged prologue and a prolonged epilogue.  The ""extended miniseries"" format requires the audience to watch small stories suited to a single sitting but also connected and interwoven in a complex way, following a greater arc.  Some have compared it to a soap opera but that's not a very apt description.

The acting does not start off as well as it might, although some characters do very very well from the beginning.  As the characters settle into their roles, things become much, much better.

The series is full of mythological elements, and includes great commentaries on religious faith and sacrifice, as well as heroism, as much as these are generally lacking from sci-fi series generally.  Each race has their own sets of religions:  the Narn follow a system of prophets which reminds me of Islam, while the Minbari follow a religion that reminds me of modern Hinduism, and the Cenauri follow a sort of henotheistic paganism based seemingly on Roman models.

In any event, the series leaves one to think about many of these things.  Yet in the final analysis what makes a mark is the heroism that leads to undying fame on the part of several of the characters.  In this regard it strikes me much more as an Indo-European epic, than it does a modern tale despite the setting.

Most people I have shared the series with have greatly enjoyed it.  A few have not.  YMMV.  However, I believe that the word ""great"" hardly begins to cover this series.",1293494400,,3426,6.394793926247289

3913492,1,B002DUJ9Q6,"I am the sort of science fiction viewer who liked the original Star Trek, but recognized that plenty of its episodes were dumb, dull, or pointless filler.  I disliked The Next Generation era, which aside from several stellar episodes (like ""The Inner Light"", ""Tapestry"", ""Best of Both Worlds"", etcetera) was largely more of the same, with a heaping dose of insufferable smugness for the first two seasons.  I believe Deep Space Nine was the best overall Star Trek series, and that Voyager was atrocious on virtually every level, and that while the first two seasons of Enterprise matched Voyager's worst moments, the last two seasons were phenomenal, given the caliber that had just preceded it in the first two seasons.

I am also the sort of science fiction viewer who has fallen in love with Battlestar Galactica, the reimagined series.

I initially had no interest in Babylon 5, but I've heard things about it.  Great things.  I've heard compliments about the writing, the storyarcs, and the fact that it was largely all pre-written before even the TV pilot began.

In my review for the TV movie pilot, I said that it was a failure on virtually every level; the dialogue was stale and cliche, the writing plodding and incoherent, the characterization virtually nonexistant, the CGI atrocious even for the early 90s, and the acting as bad as a 50s B Sci-Fi movie.

Unfortunately as I am half-way through season 4 (with there being 5 seasons), very little has improved.  The acting varies, with people like Peter Jurasik (Londo Mollari) and Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar) putting on stellar and dependable performances all the time.

The others, though, simply get worse with age.  Susan Ivanova is insufferably horrible, trashy cliche lines matched with middle-school level projection and acting.  Mira Furlan gets a lot better from the TV Pilot, but she's still a one-note, one-dimensional mopey softheart.  Sheridan, Doctor Franklin, Marcus Cole, Michael Garibaldi, virtually all the human characters are one-dimensional, less characters than archetypes.

In fact, I'm reminded of Ronald D. Moore's ""manifesto"" written that was published with the scripts of the Battlestar Galactica miniseries:

""We take as a given the idea that the traditional space opera, with its stock characters, techno-double-talk, bumpy-headed aliens, thespian histrionics, and empty heroics has run its course and a new approach is required.""

This was written far after Babylon 5 ended, but every time I notice that the aliens are well-rounded, fleshed out characters and the humans remain one-note archetypes, I'm reminded of something relating to the above mentioned in a documentary or a commentary for Battlestar Galactica---something about how it was commonplace in science fiction for the aliens to essentially steal the show, becoming the well-rounded, beloved breakout characters, and the humans being the stale, boring, yet necessary straight characters.

That is exactly how Babylon 5 is.  The aliens in the form of Londo Mollari, G'Kar, Vir Cotto, even dorkhead Lennier, constitute the greatest and most fun parts of the series, and the humans constitute the exact opposite, sucking all the fun and interest out of the series.  The worst, by far, being Marcus Cole, a ""ranger"" added in season 3 who has thus far served no purpose beyond being an insufferable nuisance.

For the vast majority of season 1, I sat through filler episode after filler episode, wondering when the story arcs began.  Then towards the end of the season, the story picked up and I was introduced to highly intriguing bits, including a possible explanation for the mysterious surrender by the Minbari in the Earth-Minbari War, which they were winning.

Then season 2 began, and it was back to filler episodes and mediocrity.

I noticed this was a trend, as season 3 and season 4 often began with loads of filler episodes, or else episodes that contributed little or nothing to the overall storyarcs.  It seems rather clear that the big story that had been written couldn't fill more than 2 full seasons in a taut manner, and so it was spread over five, and stuffed full of filler and nonstop bad writing and even worse dialogue.

As for the stories themselves, they don't come anywhere close to being in any way innovative or original or even particularly compelling.  I was told that the aliens were going to seem at times truly ALIEN compared to humans, and yet again and again I see aliens behaving like humans.  In fact, given the horribly cliche and cartoonish way the humans behave, its actually hte ALIENS who are very human, and the humans who are alien to us real people.

But the absolute lowest point in the series regarding aliens came when Commander Ivanova was sent to find some of the First Ones, an ancient alien species that had lived for billions of years before, and is supposedly advanced in all ways and unbelievably complicated beings, and when she finds one, and it refuses to help her because she's working for the Vorlons.... she successfully converts it by using CHILDISH reverse psychology and prodding at its machismo.  She claims ""The Vorlons knew you'd never help them.  After all, they helped you in the last war and you took all the credit"" etcetera.  It was unbelievable that so childish and cliche a gesture would work perfectly.

The Shadow storyline overall is a colossal letdown.  Mass Effect's Reapers this ain't, as the Babylon 5 crew and the Vorlons and the Minbari and all their allies prepare to battle this race that is EVIL.  EVIL EVIL EVIL.  Straight and simple.  They're given no motivation or characterization beyond ""BLATANTLY EVIL"".  Given that the strict dichotomy of explicit good and explicit evil is already cliche (as well as virtually nonexistant in reality), it takes some skillful writing and storytelling to pull off the story of ""Good versus Evil"", and that is writing caliber that Babylon 5 has none of.

At some point, the motivation of the Shadows is revealed... and it's rather nonsensical.  They try to tempt Sheridan to join them, with the promise of... unending violence and war and death.  NICE PITCH, LOSERS!

Then it just ends.  The entire huge, epic war between LIGHT and SHADOW, that was A THOUSAND YEARS IN THE MAKING... ends because Sheridan tells them to GET THE HELL OUT OF OUR GALAXY.

Oh that's right.  It turns out that the Vorlons are just as evil as the Shadows, and that the entire reason they're fighting is... well, I don't quite remember, but it had something to do with trying to get lesser races to join their causes.  The analogy given is that of two angry parents squabbling with each other and trying to force their children to side with one of them against the other.  HOW ""ALIEN"" OF THEM!

In another overarching storyline, Earth takes a hideous turn for the ""1984""-ish, with the vice president working with these Shadows to have the president murdered, then he becomes president, and begins enacting all the stereotypical signs of oppressive, brutal, tyrannic dictatorship.  Cue Hitler, cue Stalin, cue Castro, cue Pol Pot, cue whoever you want, it's exactly the same.

But it's not treated the same.  It's treated almost COMICALLY by the people on Babylon 5 at first.  When the B5 equivalent of the SS, NKVD, Spartan Krypteia, any secret police starts to exert itself, cracking down and oppressing merchants and civilians, arresting people who criticize the government or ask questions, it's given a token ""Baahhh those dang Night Watchers!"" response by the Captain and Commander and others, as if they were Scooby Doo villains.

None of this changes until VERY late in the story, when finally they break away from Earth.  After the Shadow War just sort of ends, they turn to dealing with Earth more seriously.

I suffered through Star Trek Voyager, I can suffer through the rest of this, but as to the totality of this series, I summarize:

-Atrocious, cliche-ridden, painful, childish dialogue
-Stale, mediocre writing
-Overall below average acting
-Hideous visual effects, even as far in as 1997, season 4
-Tons of boring filler episodes
-One-dimensional, unlikeable human characters
-Ridiculous individual episode stories
-Unbelievable, unrealistic behavior and responses from characters in certain situations",1288828800,15,8267,5.0434142752023545
3913493,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"I just finished the fifth season last night. The characters were wonderful and the show was well written. Many of the characters grew and changed over time both in themselves and their relationship with others. In addition, there was plenty to show what real life might be like even in the fantastic world of Babylon 5. The aliens looked so different but within these great differences we found similarities to ourselves especially in the struggle to see beyond ourselves to what's best for all. So within the scripts we were not only entertained, we were also shown the best and worst of man, with hopes that we could emulate the one and avoid the other. I do believe that once the Vorlons and the Shadows left that some of the mystery and tension was gone, but the show remained solid and well presented throughout the five year run, and I loved that it actual came to a end that satisfied.

I loved the show and began to wonder where it placed on my all-time list of favorites. Looking at my DVD shelf I see one of the grand parents of modern sci-fi shows, the original Star Trek. The sets were simple but the stories were great and the iconic characters resonated with a whole generation of fans, leaving a permanent mark still fondly remember today. Next to that I see Firefly which though it died young showed great promise and ended with many untapped possibilities for story lines. But even in its short life span expressed a perfect blend of adventure, drama, humor, and tension. Then add great characters and a reluctant hero and you have the beginnings of a masterpiece. Next to that I see Farscape, which is on my list partially because it surprised me by showing I could actual bond with characters that were played by puppets. But mostly because the main character came from earth during a time near my own which made the show feel like I had been pulled into a very alien environment which I needed to make sense of to stay alive. Finally, I see X-files (the mythology) which is a darker, more dramatic presentation of a conspiracy that threatens everyone, but remains hidden from all but the one that wants to believe and his loyal partner. The stories definitely create emotions, but what makes this stand out to me is the connection between the characters. The main characters of this show are connected way beyond being partners but different then being lovers. Their relationship throughout the show is mesmerizing, unequaled in any other sci-fi show I know, and maybe in any show.

So with these as the heights of my sci-fi show experience where does Babylon 5 rise? Pretty near the top. To be fair I need to wait to let it settle into position since several of these other shows I watched a while ago and Babylon 5 I just finished, but I think it is safe to say that if not the top of my list it will comfortably fit somewhere in the top five, and doesn't that somehow seem appropriate.",1287100800,,2908,4.568965517241379

3913496,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"This set of the complete 5 year run of Babylon 5 is an excellent bargain. It is also a prime example of the kind of quality shows (sci-fi, comedy, drama, etc. ensemble shows of ALL genres) that have basically disappeared from TV since the influx of ""reality shows"" and the morons who are desperate to get their face on tv for minimal wages (as well as the morons who watch them) have made it easy to make big bucks with no quality of writing or production values. (I strongly feel that the ""reality shows"" are the most UNreal shows on tv.)

This 5 year arc of an amazingly written show that has intricate plot lines (and needs attention to the many details that seem minor, but become important in later episodes) is best seen with ALL the discs (I also purchased ""In the Beginning"" and ""The Gathering"" -- prequel and pilot) and an orgy of watching B5 all in a row, all at once -- to completely see the artistry of the show, from writing (the MOST important part of ANY show), SFX, acting and all-over quality of the production.

Episode 1 - Midnight on the Firing Line - great episode, you meet the main characters and get an overview of the station and several species.

Episode 2 - Soul Hunter - I have no idea. I am so disappointed. The DVD STOPS and returns to the episode screen halfway thru the 5th chapter.

I can view nothing on this DVD after this glitch ... I want to see this series in order so I don't want to contnue to the next disk and nor should I have to.

... right now ... my review is not good ... have to go with ... SUCKS!

Of course the story is awesome so far ... if I were to give stars based on the show alone so far, I would give it 5 stars .. but I would be leery of purchasing an expensive collection like this if you are only going to be able to see 25% of just the first disk ...

There are no marks on the disk, I have cleaned it, I have tried it in 3 DVD players and a laptop. It stops in the same place every time.

I AM SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!

I will come back and make an addition if anything changes ...

ADDENDUM - June 10, 2010

Amazon replaced the 5 seasons. I got them today. GUESS WHAT, SAME PROBLEM, SAME PLACE! In the middle of chapter five of the second episode of season one the screen freezes and you are returned to the episode screen (I have no idea what the main screen looks like because the DVD won't start - blank TV screen - until you hit PLAY and then it jumps right into the first episode) ... well NO other episodes work on the DVD after that. Disk Two - same problem.

I am really upset about this. Not one of the disks plays correctly as far as I can see. I don't want my money back, I WANT THE 5 SEASONS - WITH NO DEFECTS! SO disappointed!!",1275955200,2,1710,3.941860465116279

3913504,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"To compact the distant future of the cosmic universe into five or six years is a prodigy of ingenuity. We have to go beyond this time line, or rather short segment, and accept to put duration in what is seen as an accelerated reading of some crazy DVD. If we get beyond that shortened time line, we can then enjoy the whole story. Enjoy the action, the creativity of all kinds of intelligent species and their technologies, including the advanced DNA manipulations by the Shadows and the Vorlons to produce more advanced ""human"" brains. We can enjoy the human relations between the main characters, be they human or not. We can also enjoy the great creativity of the cosmic world, Babylon 5 itself, this five mile long cosmic station, the various spacecrafts, and many other creations, including of course the most obscure, dark and shadowy predators if not vampires who use other species to achieve their objectives. Then we can concentrate on some of the main characters. Captain Sinclair does not last much more than the first season, with a fugitive apparition later on. Captain Sheridan is not always the humane man and authority we would like him to be, especially when he becomes a politician. The ambassadors, Mombary De Lenn, Santori Lando or Nan G-Kar, become indispensable fixtures in the big saga and their evolution is funny in a way. De Lenn becomes the wife of Terrian President Sheridan when he takes the head of the Coalition. Lando becomes the prisoner of a shadowy spider that makes him the slave of a predator species, in spite of his being the Emperor of the Santori Republic. The funnier transformation is that of G-Kar who shifts from a real stubborn pain in the ass to a victimized refugee and finally to a seer, a guru, a prophet of peace for his own people and among the various species. Doctor Franklin is attractive in his doubts and certitudes to be the servant of human ethics in his own profession generalized to the whole universe. Garibaldi the reformed alcoholic who relapses, the head of security used as a weapon by the Psy Corps, the fascist mental police of the Earth, against Sheridan himself, and then ending as a corporation CEO on Mars, is in a way funny ah ah and humane. But beyond you have two axioms that reveal an ideology. The first axiom is that the cosmos produces many intelligent species but that all the present and rather recent species are humanoids in a way or another. Only two older species that live beyond the rim of hyperspace have developed a higher level of intelligence, the Shadows and the Vorlons. They represent two visions of cosmic history. The Shadows are beings of darkness in the shape of some multi-legged black spiders and they believe the species must fight one against the others to enable progress through natural selection, and the Vorlons who are aerial beings of light consider progress can only come through a political treatment of the objective of bringing the various species together. That's of course nave. The liberals versus the neo-conservatives. Clinton versus Bush. Primitive thinking. But the second characteristic emerges from the whole series. The history of all these intelligent species can only be written through wars, either coming from their own wickedness or from the enslavement to some fundamentally bellicose incompatible species. That's even more than pessimistic. That's the belief nothing can come from peace, understanding, cooperation. In that vision there is no real collective future and peace can only be the peace one feels and cultivates in one's own mind in the middle of a deeply disrupted and aggressive world. Peace in one's mind in the middle of a suicide bombing attack, but apparently for the suicide bomber's own mind. That's the worst part of that saga. And the Terrian humans cut a particularly vicious and hypocritical role in that deeply grotesque warmongering discourse.

3913506,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"If you're hesitating over whether to spend the money and buy the whole 5 seasons, wait no more! This show is simply brilliant no matter how many times you've seen it! Although I have seen the complete series several times, including when it originally aired, watching it again has been a revelation. Babylon 5 is a remarkable and under-rated achievement. If you've never seen it and love good, well-written, believable Sci Fi - this is the show for you. If it's been a while since you've seen it, you've got a treat in store, because so many things are revealed than are easy to miss when watching it ""live"". Unlike Star Trek, which I've watched and loved since it's original airing, B5 is a complete and complex story, where everything and everyONE are connected. If you're a fan, you know almost everything the happens on the series is important and many seemingly insignificant things turn out to have great importance later on. All the characters are delightfully rich and complex and watching the series again on DVD is like finding some old family home movies you haven't seen in years.

I was delighted to discover hidden depths to the first season's Captain Sinclair, who I never particularly liked, but have now learned to appreciate. He's a sensitive and unexpectedly diplomatic man, finding unique solutions to a host of problems. And he's a prime example of things or people turning out to be of great importance later on - no spoilers but don't discount him. He will definitely surprise you!

Why this series has never received the acclaim it so richly deserves I will never know, but believe me, this is no late-night cult classic, but a brilliant epic spanning time and space and replete with every emotion found in the human heart. Don't worry guys - there are plenty of explosions, mayhem, battle scenes, space ships and shoot outs to counter any emotional overtones.

Babylon 5 may be the best Sci Fi series ever made. Don't miss it - for the first or fifteenth time. Owning it will only make it better!",1263945600,10,2021,4.735795454545454

It certainly was, and even by today's standards which, in my opinion, are far lower than they used to be the show still stands as a towering champion of story telling.  The characters are developed like in a well written novel.  The story unfolds in a masterpiece of suspense and foreshadowing.  The philosophical points are well made, and the unique respect the show gives to religion in general and the concept of individual belief is unsurpassed in science fiction.  The sub plots are a perfect fit.  The side stories are a perfect fit.  The entire series is a perfect fit.  Admittedly, the series starts off with some episodes that are not to the quality level that the show obtains.  However, even the ""stinkers"" are watchable and fun.  Every episode contributes to the overall story arc.  By the time the series got to season 2-4, it managed to produce some of the finest stories ever developed in a TV series.  The whole plot proceeds at a level of quality that is rarely seen.  However, the show drops off a bit in quality in season 5 but still maintains an excellence that surpasses all of it contemporaries and 99% of the shows that exist today.

3913512,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"I have been a fan of Babylon 5 since it's beginnings. It is the first Sci-Fi TV series that had a realistic look and feel. Most other shows make the future look comfortable and super high tech. Babylon 5 looked more believable. The characters were not genius perfect people. The humans and aliens alike made mistakes.

Babylon 5 was a brilliant novel for TV with a beginning, a middle, and an end before the first episode was ever aired.  This gave the series it's direction and strength. Every question was always answered with detail.  Many of the characters were little known actors that you grew to know and either love or love to hate. But they all became memorable for life.  Londo is a good example of this. He was just an alien ambassador in the beginning. You couldn't help but like the guy, even when he showed us his darkest side. Delen and Sheridan showed us that we really can all get along if we try. And the CGI special effects were stunning and realistic.

When Amazon cut the price in half for the complete series, I couldn't resist getting it. Being able to watch the entire series back to back without interruption gave me a new insight to the series. I feel I got more depth from the story and enjoyed it like I was seeing it for the first time, even though I had seen every episode many times in reruns on TV. I also own the 5 B5 movie set and the Ranger and Lost episodes. If you love Sci-Fi, you will be thrilled beyond your imagination with the entire Babylon 5 saga.

3913518,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Babylon 5 is truly one of the most enjoyable and intelligent Sci-Fi series. We missed the series when it aired on TV but, at the urging of my NASA Engineer sister, picked it up on DVD. We (my wife and two teens) watched the entire series (and all of the movies,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Babylon-5-The-Movie-Collection/dp/B0002B15UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Babylon 5 - The Movie Collection</a>) straight through over a two month period.

The first season of Babylon 5 is, by almost all accounts, the weakest of the five. The second season really is much better than season one, and fortunately we were warned that this was the case by my sister so we stuck it out. Season one did get much better in the last few episodes as the characters started to gel and the back stories came to light.

The biggest problem with season one (besides the clunky dialog) was the character Commander Jeffery Sinclair (Michael O'Hare). He really just didn't fill the role well, had very bad lines, and was played like one of puppets from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thunderbirds-Megaset-Complete-12-Volume-Set/dp/B000068M9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thunderbirds Megaset (Complete 12 Volume Set)</a>. I am happy that this really is only a first season issue as this problem is resolved at the start of season two.

Babylon 5 really hits its stride in Season 2, with much better acting, great story lines, and seriously strong character development. The biggest improvement was in the casting change, replacing Commander Jeffery Sinclair with Captain John Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner) in the first episode of this season.

I really like the way the way the show runs sub-plots through multiple episodes and, like real life, events in past episodes effect events in future episodes. We also see the groundwork being laid for the upcoming Shadow War and for several side plot lines.

The special effects were still somewhat weak, but considering that this show was made in the '90s, they are passable.

Season 3 was perhaps the best one of Babylon 5. There is very good acting, great story lines, and strong characters.

There are very few ""stand alone"" episodes as many of the plots lines now span the entire season. There are serious issues to be addresses with EarthGov, Psi-Cops, Alien Alliances, The Shadows, and the occasional freelancer. We also see romantic relationships, friendships form, and a new major character is added. Marcus Cole (Jason Carter) joins the station as a ""Ranger"", he is a good addition and brings a lot to the series.

There is plenty of drama, action and the occasional surprise to keep the viewer engaged in the story. As with the previous seasons, the special effects are still somewhat weak.

Season 4 of Babylon 5 was very good and brought most of the outstanding plot lines from the previous seasons to a close. It seemed that things were very rushed to wrap up the Shadow War and the conflict with EarthGov, but as I understand it this was going to be the final season before it was unexpectedly extended for an additional season.

This season follows the excellent season 3 and only falls a little short because of the rushed pace. There are some great (and frustrating) character developments that has the B5 command staff and the various Ambassadors split up a lot of the time performing various missions. There are also a lot of well thought out ship-to-ship battles that work to show how much thought went into making this series believable.

The fifth season of Babylon 5 was the final in the series. While not as strong as seasons 3 and 4, it was still very watchable.

There were lot of good episodes but the final one, ""Sleeping in Light"", was very good, does a nice job wrapping the series up, and is somewhat of a ""Tear Jerker"". It was bittersweet as it was good to finally get to the end (we watched all 5 season and all of the movies over a two month period), but we didn't really want the show to be over.

This was a great way to see the entire series and it was well worth the investment in both time and money!

3913519,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"I bought this DVD pack because I had positive brief memories of B5 (it was never on), I liked other scifi, and other people seemed to rate B5 very highly. When I started watching season 1 I was a bit heartbroken... it seemed not very good, very cheesy. I almost returned it to amazon upon looking up their return policies.

By the time I got to episode 5 I was hooked. The storyline is simply excellent, spanning several empires, several wars, empires at various stages of development, et cetera. Unlike in Star Trek the humans are *not* the most advanced species around, which is refreshing. The physics was sound... the station actually has to rotate for articial gravity to take place, a refreshing change. There are few clear good guys and bad guys, and a broad spectrum in between, it's easy to see all sides. The story is cohesive in my opinion.

One complaint: the DVDs were of low quality. I got a lot of hiccups and missed chapters on mine.

I recommend watching the pilot after watching season 1 (because it is cheesy and one needs to get past that to get around the series) and I recommend watching the prequel early on.

Things really pick up in the second season when a complex, ongoing story starts.  The series creator wrote the whole story out before even starting production or script writing and intended it to be told from start to finish in five seasons (120 episodes).  He succeeded.

(Though I do recommend watching the original pilot.  It does a great setup for everything.)  Even though Babylon 5 is labeled sci-fi, it is like no other sci-fi series.  Babylon 5 does not live by ""monster-of-the-week"" episodes.  Straczynski has a grand story, and every episode contributes something to that story.  The fact that the story is not confined by the episode time is fantastic.  Since the series is on DVD now, you can watch a complete story arc back to back, if you want.  And unlike some other series I've watched, B5 does not get repetitive if you watch it back to back.  Again, everything is progressing the larger story.

Some people may think that B5 is slow to get to the crux of the story.  This is completely untrue.  B5 has to build up the characters first.  How can you see where the characters change when you don't know where they started from?  Like any good author, Straczynski shows us the players of the story before he rocks their world with the plot.  And these are some of the most memorable characters I have ever watched.  My friends and I still quote lines from some of the more memorable encounters even though it's been a long time since I've seen the series (mainly because I didn't have my own copy.)

3913534,4,B002DUJ9Q6,"Babylon 5--known as B5 to its fans--is an iconic science-fiction series, and a strong antidote to the often sappy, idealistic universe of the Star Trek shows, as well as Star Wars.

Strengths:
1. Very satisfying if you have an engineer streak in your DNA--for example, human spaceships have gravity because they have centrifuge sections, and they're rectangular because, duh, they're in space.
2. Equally satisfying if you follow international politics and know how murky right/wrong turn out to be in the real world. One of the actors came from the former Yugoslavia, and her friends would ask her why all the plots were (to them) based on Balkan politics.
3. A five year plot arc really uses the many individual episodes to tell a complex, compelling, overall story, sometimes with characters you thought were good or evil turning out to be otherwise or somewhere in between.
4. A scientific and anthropological perspective portraying us humans as interstellar newcomers who only got there with borrowed technology, and by no means the top dogs.
5. Individual characters you can relate to in all their noble and not so noble traits.

Weaknesses:
1. screenwriting that falls short of brilliance. Workmanlike, serviceable, nothing annoyingly flowery--but you aren't going to see its scripts examined in English departments like Buffy the Vampire Slayers scripts are.

2. special effects that fall far short of what is achievable today. Not funky as Red Dwarf or laughable like the original Dr. Who, but nothing like, for example, ""WALL-E."" Again, they're workmanlike, they aren't annoying, but they won't thrill you either.

3. Acting like the screenwriting--serviceable but not sublime. One of the main characters is a poor man's Bruce Willis--that's fun. And two of the aliens are played with great gusto (G'Kar and Londo Molari). A secondary character--a commercial telepath--was also a stunt double on Star Trek. But by far the biggest shortcoming came from the show's creator firing Claudia Christian and replacing her in the last year with a new character who lacked Christian's flair.

If you come at it with the right expectations you'll be happy you got this series. There's still nothing like it on TV or in the movies.",1230595200,2,2229,5.129476584022038
3913535,4,B002DUJ9Q6,"Finally!  I've gotten the entire series (minus the movies and the spinoffs).  I enjoyed watching them all over again.  At some point I had missed many of the final episodes so it was a pleasure to get completely caught up.

From my understanding J. Michael charted out the main plot lines for ONLY the first four seasons.  The network(s) approached him for another season, causing him to improvise and create a 5th season, when his entire concept was wrapped around four seasons' worth of episodes.  This explains some of the ""unevenness"" of the 5th season.  Nevertheless I was happy to skim through season 5.

We have the advantage of time to step back a bit and look at how influential Babylon 5 was to Science Fiction screenwriting.  Up until B5 showed up other shows just wrote from episode to episode with little regard for longer, more involved plots that spanned multiple episodes, entire seasons, even multiple seasons!  The rich writing of the series is what stands out when experiencing the series.  The writing of the shows was so compelling that even the Star Trek franchise had to take notice and alter their writing.

It goes almost without saying that the Battlestar Galactica writers were directly influenced by this new approach to a Science Fiction TV series.

After reading some of the other reviews the one thing that strikes me is how picky the criticisms are in B5's ""perceived"" flaws.  Take the Trek series and see how many flaws are there!  More than B5, obviously.

I waited a long time before plunking down the money for the entire series, glad I did, and you can bet I'll be watching them again and again.",1229299200,,1632,4.73404255319149

3913540,4,B002DUJ9Q6,"Had I watched the pilot movie ""The Gathering"" before starting the series, I would never have started the series. Had I not been assured by a friend that the first few episodes were not on a par with the rest of the series, I wouldn't have made it past those first episodes. The opening of Babylon 5, I must say, is terrible. Everything from the writing to the acting to the music is truly second rate.

HOWEVER:

It plants the seeds of a story that was so well planned that throughout its entire run, everything remains consistent with the plot-points and characterizations that are established from the beginning.

Babylon 5 does what all the best science fiction (its rival DS9, the updated Battlestar Galactica) does: it lets the characters and emotions drive the story, even when the overall plot gets rather intricate. Stories play out over long stretches of time, characters grow and develop, relationships form and develop or dissolve. It is a testament to the strength of the characters that the final episode of the series is perhaps the finest of its whole run, built upon the powerful emotions that come with saying goodbye.

I have more criticisms of Babylon 5 than I do of any other show that I would consider top-tier. Like The West Wing, it is nearly entirely written by one man, and his voice - though it is of course the genius behind the series - can lead to a lack of diversity in conversational style. The acting ranges from excellent (the actors playing aliens are uniformly excellent, as is Bruce Boxleitner) to mediocre, to terrible (Michael O'Hare is one of the worst actors EVER; Jerry Doyle and Patricia Tallman are the primary offenders by the end). The show was forced to wrap things up in the 4th season, then was surprisingly renewed for a 5th season - had they known they had this season available, the Shadow War would have been brought to a more satisfying conclusion.

But the show survives my criticisms because of its strengths. The rise of G'Kar and the fall of Londo Mollarri is one of the most impressive pieces of storytelling ever committed to film. The flaws of the characters feel real and logical. The truly deep and original plotting sustains a very complicated story over five years.

The dvd set is well put together, with each disc well protected, and some very interesting commentaries from series creator J. Michael Straczynski. A word of advice: wait until after you've seen the whole series to view some of the featurettes, as there are occasional spoilers in the commentaries and special features.",1210982400,4,2550,4.770975056689342

I had seen 4 of the 5 seasons on TV so it was great to watch it without ads. This set of series blew Deep Space Nine out of the Galaxie.

If there were any short comings, it was the quality of the picture. The special effects shots out side of the station were awesomely clear but the shots in the station with the phony back drops was a little phony. This was a little annoying at times, but as I've said it was easily forgotten due to the intense story line.

3913543,4,B002DUJ9Q6,"Getting into the BABYLON 5 universe can be confusing for newcomers.  To see everything you really need the DVDs in this box as well as all of the individual B5 movies and the single-season series CRUSADE.  I'm going to give a simplified chronology.  You can make it even more precise by putting one movie in between two episodes of a single season, but I don't think you gain too much by doing that.  Except for THE GATHERING and A CALL TO ARMS, none of the movies rigidly require to be viewed at a particular point.

First watch BABYLON 5: THE GATHERING from this boxed set.  To be blunt, it is not very good at all.  It is basically a pilot and not an especially compelling one.  We meet some -- but by no means all -- of the important characters of forthcoming seasons, and get a taste of the B5 universe, but this is just a dull, chatty, uninteresting debut.  And the make up for G'Kar looked like it was in planning stages!  Very, very different from how he looked on the subsequent series.

Next, watch Seasons One through Four of BABYLON 5 the series.  The first season is slightly more interesting than the pilot, but not by much.  Season Two gets slightly more interesting, especially near the end of the season when the Shadows plot really kicks into gear.  From this point to the end of Season Four B5 is incredibly compelling.  Just be patient watching the first two seasons.  You'll start getting hints in Season Two of how good it will eventually get, but there will still be plenty of dullish episodes instead.  The series is not terribly balanced because the network changed its plans a couple of times, first telling Straczynski that the series was going to wrap up at the end of Season Four and then, after he had collapsed two season's worth of stories into one, telling him that the show would be renewed for one more season.  So much for planning.

Next, before watching Season Five, watch another movie in this set, IN THE BEGINNING.  This is far and away the best of the B5 movies and is fully as good and as entertaining as Seasons Three and Four.  It goes back before the beginning of the series, giving the details of the Minbari was.  But the narrative assumes you've seen the first four seasons.

Next, watch Season Five of BABYLON 5.  Because he really had a different story arc planned for Season Five one had to be created pretty quickly.  The whole telepath arc simply never caught fire and it does not represent the best of B5.  The last third of the season focuses on the decline and fall of Centauri Prime and this is B5 at its best.  There are a string of very, very good episodes as well as a very beautiful series finale.  Mention must also be made of a lovely episode in the first half of the season written by the great Neil Gaiman.

Season Five was actually broadcast in split seasons and a couple of the movies -- THIRDSPACE and RIVER OF SOULS -- were broadcast before the series actually finished.  Your call.  Neither is all that great and neither really requires to be seen at a certain point.

The next movie, however, BABYLON 5: A CALL TO ARMS, should be viewed after the end of the series and the previously mentioned movies, and before the series CRUSADE.  This episode features Bruce Boxleitner very prominently as Sheridan and is probably his last great hurrah in the series.  The movie introduces the new and highly advanced space ship Excalibur and deals with a Drakh attack on earth, infecting it with a slow-acting virus that will kill all life on earth if a cure is not found (but since B5 the TV series gave us multiple glimpses into the future, we know that doesn't happen).  This required the need for a search for a cure for the virus, a search that was continued on the quickly cancelled CRUSADE.  The show never really got off the ground, but it had some interesting characters (especially Galen, played by Peter Woodward, who also appeared in the films A CALL TO ARMS and LOST TALES).  I do recommend that fans of B5 see CRUSADE.

The next movie was THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS: TO LIVE AND DIE IN STARLIGHT.  Horrible.  This is the worst of all the B5 movies, the worst thing ever done in the entire run of the show.  I honestly don't even recommend this for fans of the show.  The most I can say in support of it is that it is one's last chance to see Andreas Katsulas as G'Kar.  He died a couple of years later of lung cancer.

Last, and not quite least, there is 2007's THE LOST TALES.  It is definitely not as bad as THE LEGEND OF THE RANGERS, but not as good as IN THE BEGINNING.  My reaction was that it was nice to see some familiar characters again (mainly just Tracy Scoggins's Captain Lochley, Bruce Boxleitner's Sheridan, and Peter Woodward's Galen).  But definitely not B5 at its best.  Most fans describe it as ""chatty.""  There are entire scenes devoted to nothing but talk, and not terribly good talk at that.

A lot to see.  For me the heart consists of the end of Season Two, all of Seasons Three and Four, the movie IN THE BEGINNING, and the last third of Season Five.  My advice to anyone newly approaching B5 is to stick it out through it all.  Much of it is dull, some of it even downright bad, but the best is very good indeed.

3913545,4,B002DUJ9Q6,"I didn't watch this series when it came out. I tried but I just couldn't get into it. Here is the problem:

B5 was like nothing else on TV. I expected something episodic. Just like everything else. I expected all conflicts raised in one episode to be resolved in one episode. Just like everything else. I expected a big finale and maybe one new question to leave it open for another season. Just like everything else.

Instead, what I got in the first season was a bunch of interesting characters in a colorful setting raising more questions than they answered every episode and leaving me with an extremely soap opera feeling. I became frustrated and gave up watching it.

Then I got married and got talked into watching it beginning to end. And I was totally blown away.

The first time you watch it, you wonder why the heck are all these details presented as Chekov's guns never resolved. Then they are. often 4 or 5 years later. The second time you watch it, you notice more details which predict what you know is coming and plot holes in other series start becoming distracting. The third time you watch it, you notice headlines in the newspapers held by extras do the same and there are Pak'Ma'Ra EVERYWHERE and plot holes in other series are downright annoying. The fourth time, you may nearly fully realize how tightly woven the storyline is. The fifth time, well, no other series is nearly as satisfying since they don't seem to know where they are going. Babylon 5 knows where it is going from the pilot.

Eventually I stopped watching TV. The buzz for a few series seemed promising, like Alias and Lost, so I bought some of their DVDs, but they eventually descended into a meandering ridiculousness. I am probably better off.

There are no cookie-cutter good guys. In fact, everybody has a bad side that gets exploited at some point. And the plot twists are realistic. At first they may seem to come out of nowhere but if you look back at details you dismissed they make perfect sense. There are quite a few terrible casting jobs for bit parts in the first and second seasons (which explain how they were able to remain under budget), but appearances by Michael York, Jonathan Pryce, Penn and Teller, Majel Barrett Roddenberry, Walter Koenig and gems like Marshall Teague, Wayne Alexander and William Forward more than make up the difference.

I marked this set down a star for the bad packaging that falls apart and because the first season is really, really grainy. I don't have an HD capable TV (as I said, I no longer watch TV-- and besides, who wants to see blemishes and scars in high-def? Yuck.) so I don't know how they look on one of those. The ""outdoor shots"" still look great on a regular TV. In fact, the effects look better in TOS than they do in Crusade.",1204934400,,2779,4.568273092369478

It's operatic,Iliadic,Shakespearean...in fact it draws on every piece of classic literature ever written to weave its' own wonderful and original 110 epsiode story arc. Its' themes are universal ones;struggle,resistance,life,death,good,evil,love,hate,war,peace,patience,intolerance, frustration,and on and on. The stories engage us at every turn. You find yourself scrambling for answers to some of the tough questions and situations that the characters ask of themselves and are forced to endure.
Furthermore the Babylon 5 universes' perspective is always in flux. That is we are not just given a one sided view of things but several,frequently at the same time. In the fifth season ep ""A view from the gallery"",for example,while there are multiple story lines both major and minor playing themselves out we get a dominant view of things from two lowly maintenance workers:They a)are ordinary folks like you and me(immediate audience empathy),b)we get their perspective on station operations,c)they become involved in station ""situations""(invasion by alien race) d)they interact with Delenn and Pres. Sheridan briefly which gives us further confirmation of the ""righteousness"" of the whole cause and of the leading characters themselves and d)you realize that big or small in the grand scheme of B-5 ops,that these guys are as every bit as important as the command staff is.
These are things that are not touched upon too often in many shows today nor in the past and it is just one of the many facets of the show I admire. It is just one example of a multitude of the quality of the writing of Mr. Straczynski.
Babylon 5 was certainly a big gamble and we can all be grateful that Mr. Straczynski and friends had the persistence and guts to push as hard as they could to get this series not only put on the air but to find an audience,maintain the high quality it did and endure for five seasons. And as you breeze through the special features on these discs you realize just how fragile its' hold on being aired at all was.
And speaking of special features these discs contain many such items throughout each season. There are many looks at the series from its' prop department to its' creation of music. Seasons four and five contain some gag reels which I found to be really welcome additions. It is just too bad reels for the previous seasons could not have been included. Also there are just too few interviews with the cast members;most are just short question/responses on a few of the featurettes(which are far too short in length in and of themselves).I would have liked more lengthy one on ones.
Barring these ""issues"" I still have to rate this series as high as I do. The quality of work that these seasons embody demand no less.
Mr. Straczynski has said on more than one occasion that while at a speaking engagement at the illustrious M.I.T. that some there considered B-5 along with ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""Star Trek""(both the original series) to be the best Sci-Fi series ever put on TV.A high honour indeed. All broke new ground in their day and all still stand the test of time in writing and originality.
Another side angle I always get a kick out of(when viewing the series) is the connection of the shows' actors and the writing(in jokes),to past shows like Star Trek,The Prisoner,Nightmare on Elm Street,among others, along with the original actors from these same shows/movies. I always go back and find more that I have previously missed. A pleasant little diversion you might want to try.
In conclusion I highly recommend this series to everyone,but I know it will find a special place in the hearts of fans of good Sci-Fi. The series was intelligently written(MS)and ably executed by the marvellous acting staff. This series(the cake)coupled with ""Babylon-5-The Movie Collection""(the icing-see my review of that) is all you'll ever need to appreciate the depth and scope of this classic TV series.",1191542400,2,4149,4.945558739255015

3913556,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"An excellent series, Babylon 5, brings to the screen the ongoing adventures and parallel stories of prominent people aboard a major station under Human control in neutral space.

The setting is the Babylon 5 space station orbiting Epsilon 3.  The year is 2258, ten years after the Earth-Minbari War, and representatives from the five major space-faring races, the Centauri, Humans, Minbari, Narns, and the Vorlons, as well as numerous minor races have all gathered at B5 in a last effort at maintaining galactic peace.  The complications, however, have only just begun...

Michael O'Hare, Bruce Boxleitner, Mira Furlan, Jerry Doyle, Andrea Thompson (who is HOT!!!), Andreas Katsulas, Peter Jurasik, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.

In a nutshell, the show's strong points have to be:

1) The OUTSTANDING plot and subplots that keep getting better and better!

2) The GREAT character development, and

3) The wonderful feeling of being ADDICTED to the show and wanting more!

Hopefully more novels will be written and more shows/episodes will be filmed based on the B5 universe.  KEEP'EM COMING JMS!

In short, Babylon 5 is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!",1180742400,,1565,5.191235059760956

It doesn't break through all the barriers to make it better than either my old favorite Space epic (Star Trek - Deep Space Nine) or my new favorite (Battlestar Galactica) but who needs to compare?  This stands on its own merits as a 5 season epic that held my attention from start to finish.  I remember a few Saturday's spent watching 10 or more episodes straight through.  I was that caught up in it.  When it was over, there were a couple spin offs to check out, but nothing as good as this series.  I do have high hopes for the upcoming straight to DVD movie though.

In my opinion the complex and creative plot line, along with indepth character development of Babylon 5 makes this series stand out. It a TRUE Saga, with each episode slowly unraveling a new part of a greater picture. Don't worry however, while the plot is quite captivating, you don't need to be a hard core sci-fi nerd to appreciate it!

3913564,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"The Babylon 5 Sci-Fi TV series is for intelligent people.  Michael Stravinsky's master five-year plan ensured that the series was coherent and intelligent from beginning to end.  The intricacies of the plot and character development were wonderful to watch.  Bab 5's state-of-the-art  computer graphics set the benchmark for realism in its space scenes, a plateau many current programs fail to match.  The characters were finely drawn and the casting was perfect.  The action and plot twists make this a GREAT series, and viewers are sucked in immediately.

I bought this CD set for Christmas and absolutely love it. Battlestar Galactica fans:  you have been watching the wrong series!  One cannot seriously compare Cattlecar Salipatica to Bab 5!",1173571200,3,746,5.3076923076923075

3913566,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Forget the new Battlestar or the Star Trek franchise, this five year novel puts all other science fiction on tv to shame.  Every episode, no matter how episodic in style in initial viewing, fits into the larger plots of the series like a masterfully crafted novel.  The beauty: B5 watches well both ways.  Unlike Angel and other sci-operas, you can enjoy every episode no matter what order you watch them in.  But watch them carefully and with a careful eye and ear for the larger plots, and you see how wonderfully even the most obscure detail in the most episodic of episodes fits into the larger whole of the five year novel.

This is definitely where B5 beats all other science fiction series!

Of course to fully catch the artestry of this masterpiece, you do need to watch the entire series at least twice.  Which of course is why you want this DVD collection!  It comes to you in book format and honestly a couple of my sections with disks did get dislodged from the binding of the season binder.  However this is a minor thing; it doesn't impair you in any way from getting the disks out or from keeping them organized and in pristine condition.  In fact the packaging is the nicest of any movie or series I own--I wished they'd used the same book style on B5 Crusade!

If you love a great epic, THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT.  Even if you don't like sci-fi, it's worth buying and watching.  This is fine writing unmatched in tv history--though The Wire does come close!!",1173312000,5,1474,4.47565543071161
3913567,4,B002DUJ9Q6,"I just recently acquired this set of all five seasons of Babylon 5. In my opinion, that's the only way to do it. Because of how the show was designed, with story arcs lasting five years, you need to have the whole thing so that once you get started you can go for the ride right till the end. Because the show really is a ride!

But first the bad stuff. There are a LOT of truly awful things about this show. Things that I don't normally even notice in movies or TV shows stuck out like sore thumbs to me in this production. Horrible makeup, like red circles with noticeable lines around eyes to indicate illness and other things of the sort that just pop right off the screen and scream, ""I don't know how to do makeup!"" Some of the set dressings made me think, ""What in hell were they thinking?!"" Most of the fight scenes with people were very poorly choreographed. I even noticed poor direction of extras! Extras shouldn't even be noticed. Commander Sinclair in the first season is also really hard to stomach with such poor acting.

I mostly am mentioning the above to put everything in perspective. Babylon 5 had a lot of technical flaws. And people who are teetering trying to decide if they should invest, especially if they are like me and only caught part of the show when it ran on TV, need to have honest reviews to read so they know what they are getting.

The special effects are also hard to take at times. The guns they used had atrocious wave ripples that didn't look at all realistic and most of the space scenes are obviously computer generated. On the other hand, the show did take good advantage of the emergent CGI available at the time and it couldn't really have been done properly without going in that direction, so in my mind, that's a highly forgiveable flaw.

My last negative comment is about the packaging. It was horrible. I've never purchased a set so poorly put together. The plastic ""pages"" fall out of their container and many of the disks came loose during shipping. Two of them were scratched because of this, which interfered with playback and was quite frustrating. But it's too difficult to return them so I lived with it.

So with all that, why in heck would I recommend people buy the entire series? Because, aside from a few stand alone episodes that were real duds, the story of Babylon 5 is extremely compelling. What the show lacked in technical categories it more than made up for in storytelling and charactarization. I stayed up much later than I intended several nights because I had to watch ""just one more episode"" to see what would happen.

The idea of doing a TV series that was designed more as an extended novel was a hard sell, but Babylon 5 demonstrates that when done right, it's a brilliant one. One of my favorite things about the show is how little things mentioned in earlier episodes re-emerge later on, sometimes as much as a year or two later. These little mystery nuggets are relatively unique to Babylon 5 and really help to propell the stories along and make things interesting in a many-layered manner. I also liked how there were about 4-5 main stories that played out during the series.

The other thing that Babylon 5 did extremely well was portray unique and distinctive races and characters. The writer created them and then a cast of fabulous actors breathed life into them. What was even better was that the characters were very complex. The good guys were sometimes bad and the bad guys were sometimes good and sometimes they traded places completely. Some of the characters can't really be pegged as either, and often the viewer is left in a moral quandry about what they think of the decisions the characters have made. Such multi-dimensional characters and situations are a rarity in television. Not to mention that Morden has to be one of the most smug and creepy evil guys to ever appear on either the small or large screen. At times the events and the acting were so intense or poignant that it brought tears to my eyes.

So if you are interested in great science fiction storytelling and complex characters, and can overlook poor production values, then Babylon 5 is for you. And if Babylon 5 is for you, then you need to buy all 5 seasons at once so you can strap in for the entire rollercoaster ride.

My last comment is on the five Babylon 5 movies. If you really want the full set, then they are a nice add-on and I appreciate the reviewer who posted the suggested viewing order. I found it extremely helpful. But I felt the movies were not at all needed in order to make the most of the series itself. (And in fact, the first movie was very poorly done. So if you see it first, don't let it turn you off because the best is yet to come!)",1172793600,7,4727,4.4872093023255815

I often look at a major purchase as a comparison between the number of hours I enjoy the product against the number of hours I must work to pay for it.  So far, Babylon 5 has been worth every second as well as penny.

I watched the majority of the show when it aired live in the late 90s.  I can recall being very sad while watching the final episode, knowing that one of my favorite shows was leaving the air.  Through this DVD set, I now can remember why it was one of my favorites.  The writing of the Babylon 5 crew, JMS in particular, has very few peers, if any.

3913578,3,B002DUJ9Q6,"I'm of huge respect for this series.  I remember watching the pilot and a few episodes back when it first aired in the mid-90s and thinking highly of it.  I lost touch w/ it as I didn't really follow any television show religiously for many of those years.  With DVD and TVs embracing of it as a re-release medium, it's my golden chance to catch up.  With an HDTV, DVDs look great and I figured it would be a fabulous way to experience such a pronounced 'Epic' (cap E) of a show.

Well, I've watched the pilot and a third of the first season and color me unabashedly and let me say very regrettably disappointed.  The series hasn't picked up yet, so I give it that...the initial lot of episodes of any long-run show tend to feel a bit awkward.  The plots of many of the first few episodes are not in line w/ the larger stories for the most part, are fairly light and may I say, cheesy.  They just feel very very dated and simplistic.  We're several years removed and after frenetic, hyper-stylized and exotic fare such as 'Lost', '24', and the new 'Battlestar Galactica', I find these old shows to be sort of plodding and thinly soap opera-esque, i.e. predictable in their melodramatics and plot 'twists'.  Again, I am a huge fan of giving shows time to get their footing, so I'm willing to give it a break on that angle.  But as to the PQ quaility...

Here's my huge gripe.  The decade-old CGI looks absolutely horrible on a big screen.  The mastering is at fault.  The re-transferred 'effect-free' scenes all look just fine, in full 480p HD-mastered glory, they look quite nice.  But they obviously couldn't (by way of techical or budgetary challenges in this release) up-rez or anamorphic re-master the effects/CGI scenes properly.  They show video tearing and tons of jaggies.  I could cut the dated CGI a break, as it looks very amateurish in comparison to the optical/model effects of shows done in that time period that hold up much better today (ST:NG, ST:DSN).  Those shows were remastered in 4:3 and the effects don't break apart like the Babylon 5 effects sequences do, however.  That's where the problem really lies.

So, color me quite frustrated w/ this DVD set.  The ghastly issues w/ the show's CGI totally takes me out of the potentially cinematic seamless viewing experience.  Again, I REALLY want to enjoy this show/set of discs.  Please be warned.  I wasn't.",1167782400,12,2378,4.631578947368421

Picture Quality: I own several other Warner TV series on DVD and have always found them to have high picture quality. This series has fuzzy and out of focus scenes throughout and the prints used to master the DVD have scratches in virtually every episode.

3913583,3,B002DUJ9Q6,"Like a typical television soap opera, this series drags on and on through dozens of plots and sub-plots featuring at least as many characters. A situation is introduced in one episode and eventually concluded ten to fifteen episodes, or maybe even entire seasons, later. In the ensuing episodes, one is introduced to even more plots and sub-plots, many with seemingly no purpose whatsoever other than to fill time.

For example of all this, the idea of the ""Shadows,"" a race of powerful evil aliens threatening the universe, is introduced in the first season and mentioned repeatedly in the following episodes. However, the first real confrontation with those ""Shadows"" doesn't take place until well into the third season, with the first major battle at the very end of that season (the overall ""Shadow"" confrontation doesn't end until the forth season). But even that very long-awaited first battle is side-tracked by distracting sub-plots, the most irritating being a doctor on the space station, not even involved in the battle, dealing with his own petty drug addiction. Who cares!! In my opinion, this doctor (his girlfriends and his problems) could have been written out of the entire series without any loss whatsoever. Instead, sub-plots featuring this doctor, and others, also side-track several other intense moments in the series.

I just don't see how the fans, watching this series on television, sat around for weeks, or even entire seasons, waiting for some particular event to happen. This is frustrating enough when one can fast forward through the boring parts while watching this DVD collection. But even then, it's irritating. An episode ends with a cliff-hanger, only to have the next episode focus on some alien's love life or whatever. The series may not get back to the cliff-hanger for several episodes (you really have to hunt if you want to skip to it). I would discuss the other characters, plots, sub-plots, and so on, but there are just way too many of each to cover.

In reality, this would have been terrific entertainment if the entire Babylon 5 series had been compressed down to about a single season, with many of the sub-plots, filler episodes, filler content, and lesser characters, written out entirely. It could have then focused much more strongly on the two main themes - the conflict with the ""Shadows"" and the political events on Earth. After all, those are the two areas where the most interesting aspects of this series reside - the most intense moments, the most impressive special effects, the most thought-provoking situations, and so on.

Regardless, the Babylon 5 series does at least have that, if one has the patience to sit through all the other nonsense - wacky aliens, endless conspiracies, preachers, rabbis, monks, gospel singers, absurd creatures, incessant pretences of grander, often infantile humor, the boring romance between the overblown captain Sheridan and somewhat homely ambassador Delenn, the ever-present liberal political discourse, and so on. But those comparatively rare good moments do at least make Babylon 5 worth watching.

However, do remember this is a soap opera. Each season ends at a decisive moment, a cliff-hanger, with several stories from that season left unresolved until the next season or perhaps several seasons after that. Therefore, to follow each story to it's ultimate conclusion, one would have to purchase the entire series instead of a single season. Since that is a very expensive proposition only a truly devoted fan would even consider, I simply cannot give this series a high rating.",1159833600,8,3585,5.131849315068493

1) The story was put together whole before the first episode was filmed.

2) The writer i.e. JMS kept a tight rein on the production and made it true to his story.

3) The story was greater than any actor, and therefore able to survive the loss of any actor intact.

4) There are lots of mysteries which are revealed piece by piece over the course of the story.

There are other promising films which were made at the same time. X-Files is a perfect example. X-File however, fails where Babylon-5 succeeds. The main reason being that B5 is a complete story, while X-Files just presents mysteries that are never resolved.

The only real drawback is that B5 was meant to be done over the course of 5 years, perhaps that is why it is named B5! Alas, JMS was forced to bring the story to end in 4 years fearing its premature cancellation by the network. This made season 4 a bit rushed. Once season 5 did get funded JMS had to look for material to fill it in. In my opinion he missed the best ""filler"" which was: the story of Centuari. This story has since been written up in a trilogy of books. It would have made a wonderful 6 parter in the 5th season!

Nevertheless it is as close to perfection as any TV series has got to. Therefore it deserves a 5. Since then JMS has produced material that while good, do not reach this level.

I bought this 5 season set years ago and am now starting the series for the fourth time. It is that good. I seem to need to watch it about one every two years. Hence, despite it's priciness (especially then!) I have received great value.
I STILL recommend this and even more than I did in my original review 6 years or so ago.
*******************************************************

I first watched B5 beginning in the middle of it's 4th season when it was on TNT.

I liked it then but I don't remember loving it.  Then a friend recommended this 5 season box set.  Although it's price sort of scared me I bought it anyway (also with the movie pack) and I am so happy I did.  Having begun watching the series ""late"", I was unaware of the rich character development that made their later actions so spectacular.

Yes, this is science fiction but you do not need to be a fan of science fiction to enjoy this series.  My wife is no fan at all (she dislikes ST), but as she sat down by me while I watched, she got ""sucked into"" its plot, just like I did.  And like others have stated, we began to care so much about the characters as the episodes and seasons progressed.

If you appreciate great writing, characters, passionate philosophical speeches, this box set containg the entire televised seasons is for you.

For instance, consider this moving oratory from Delenn (sort of the conscience of the show):
""There are moments when we all become someone else, something other than what we are. It takes only a moment. But we spend the rest of our lives looking back at that moment in shame.""
Delenn

IMO this is the best show in television history.  Not Sci-Fi television history, but television in general.  It is not in the least bit shallow and is not for those who dislike thinking, or who merely want something visual to fold their socks in front of.  This is serious philosophical writing with serious philosophical characters whose choices force serious philosophical examinations of right and wrong, good and evil, and happiness and misery.  There are many analogies to modern  religion and politics and in this regard the show is most relevant given current world events.

Lastly, if you also buy the ""movie set"" at the same time, I HIGHLY recommend you follow the order Andreas Cohen in his gratious review suggested.  In this regard I thank him for his kind sharing in this regard. (I have a print of his review tucked inside the box set for reference).

In summary, if you are a serious ""thinking"" person who enjoys fun yet meaningful entertainment, these six box sets (5 seasons and the movie pack) are a wise investment in your human capital.

I am a significantly better person as a result of watching these DVD's.  I have no buyer's remorse what-so-ever.

3913596,4,B002DUJ9Q6,"I'm with everyone else who says B5 is a great series.  The series is fantastic, watching them on DVD without interruptions is terrific, yada yada yada.  If you didn't think so, you probably wouldn't be buying all 5 seasons.

The only issue I have with each season pack is the relatively poor way that the DVD holders themselves are put together.  The plastic disk holders are simply glued in (and not very well or securely IMO) to the cardboard covers.  It doesn't take much opening/closing/dropping from short distances onto carpet to get the disk holders to come unglued.  I've already had two disk holders come unglued from their covers.

For the price, I would have liked to see a little more secure binding, or maybe fold-out style packaging similiar to the way the LoTR extended edition DVDs were put together.  With 6 disks in each season, it might have made the package a little big, but at least everything would stay together.",1113264000,6,936,4.734567901234568
3913597,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Well, where does one start in describing babylon 5? This is not just a great science-fiction series, but  also a fantastically written and acted long epic. The series reads like an old fashioned novel. It is deep , it is rich, the carachters are extremely well drawn out and interesting , filled with flaws but also greatness in equal measure. It is a story that involves not only into the adventure but into the process of growth of the people and the worlds it describes. What I really like about babylon 5 is that it touches on so many important topics, such as the connection between one's actions and the consequences of those actions, the need to sometimes stand alone and firm with one's truth even when inconvenient, the nature of light and dark, the meaning of the struggle between good and evil, the meaning of true courage, the consequences of cowardice and self-interest, the dynamics of power and corruption in governments and the role of the individual in creating change at a collective level. JMS, the writer of this series, is a smart, sensitive and deep man that obviously had something very important to say through this series that he wrote almost singlehandedly - something that apparently is very unusual in television. And it is my feeling that he got his message across very well, helped by a superb cast of amazing actors that brought to life these very unique carachters in a way that , after a while, you really belive that they are real. Londo Molari, G'kar, Delenn, Ivanova...how could these carachters, so full and complex, be just the creation of somebody's mind? JMS and his team really created something special with this series, a universe that is consistent and real and exciting in which a magnificent story unfolds. Watch this series without skipping one episode as you will loose some of the story if you don't. Even in the first series there are elements that are important for things that happen in seasons four or five. The story is that well crafted. And if you are like me and my boyfriend, by the end of the series, you will get to care so much about these carachters, that you will weep true tears by the time you get to its closing. A very moving, fun and thought provoking work.",1112400000,9,2225,4.661577608142494
3913598,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"First, let me say that I think Babylon 5 is probably one of the greatest sci-fi series there has ever been.  EVER.  That should give you a glimpse where my review is going.  I don't plan on trying to change anyone's opinion, but I do hope to explain why this series has been a favorite of mine ever since I first saw it.

For one thing, it has an epic storyline.  When I say storyline, I mean how it was planned as a 5 season journey.  The series main attraction to me was that it was connected throughout all its seasons, weaving a tale reminiscent of the old space operas.

I've been tired of the generic sci-fi at that time (Star Trek, I'm looking at you) that while good, it never really made me want to watch every single episode.  I mean, did it matter that I missed one episode of ST:TNG? Not really, unless it was a two parter, becasue most episodes were self contained and had nothing to do with each other.  Babylon 5 changed that.

It was like a book, made into a TV show.  For anyone who has read a long book series, such as The Wheel of Time, Lord of the Rings, and even Harry Potter, you will understand why one has to keep reading the next book, and the next, and so on.  It's the story, the wanting to know what happens to the characters that drives one to keep on reading.  That's the feeling Babylon 5 gave to me.

Some people might complain that Babylon 5 was a lot of dialogue and not enough explosions.  To me, that was the best part, the interaction between the characters, their motivations, their fears, and their failures.

To me, Babylon 5 is almost like a love story.  Literally, and figuratively.  For one thing, it was a labor of love from its creator and producers that the series was able to complete its five year run.  The actors certainly loved working on that show as well.  It was a matter of love to the series that kept the fans watching, and it was the love in the Babylon 5 story itself that makes it magic. It was the love of Earth that forces the actions of our main characters, it was the love of each other that brings them together, and it was the love of peace that drives them to fight.

So much one can say about this series......but now, I'm going to put in my two cents about this Amazon.com deal.  I believe it's actually quite a smart move for you to buy it this way.  I made the mistake of buying my copies retail and at different places; some places charge up to $100 dollars for each season, while the lowest retail I've seen is around $79.  There also comes the problem of finding them all at the same time.  Most stores don't carry all seasons, so to find them all, you'll need to go store to store.  By using the Amazon.com way (which I wish I could have done myself) you get all the seasons at once, and the price is quite low.

Of course, the price is still steep, but consider this - you are looking at about 22 episodes per season, clocking about 45+ minutes each. That means you are looking at about 1000+ minutes per season, times 5, that's roughly about 5000+ minutes of great TV watching.  Now, think about the price of one movie (most of which are around 98 minutes, on average) and then think to yourself how many times you've kicked yourself for wasting 20 bucks on a movie you didn't like? In the end, if you do a numbers game, your are getting more out of one season, than you would out of 4 movies (1 1/2 hours each, 20 bucks each, about 6 hours and $80 dollars) while Babylon 5 (1 season is about 1000+ which is around 15 hours of so, for only $74 at amazon.com).",1108339200,11,3536,4.221726190476191
3913599,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"As a lover of sci-fi series, it's great to see such a saga sold as a set. The reality for the B5 connoisseur is that this isn't the Full Monty. You should also purchase ""Babylon 5 - The Movie Collection"" and the B5 spin-offs ""Crusade - The Complete Series"" and ""The Legend of the Rangers"". The reasons are indicated below in my recommended viewing order.

1. Watch the B5 movie ""The Gathering""
The Babylon 5 pilot movie The Gathering was originally broadcast in 1993 a full year ahead of the regular show.
2.  Season 1
3.  Season 2
4.  Season 3
5. Watch Season 4 up to episode ""The illusion of truth""
6. Watch the B5 movie ""Thirdspace""
7. Season 4: continue with episodes 9-22
8. Watch Season 5 through to and including episode ""Objects at Rest""
9. Watch the B5 movie ""River of Souls""
10. Watch the B5 movie ""In the Beginning""
This is a prelude set 10 years before Babylon 5. Against the logic of the title, I would strongly recommend seeing it at this stage. Should one see it before Season 1, much of the suspense in the main series would be ruined.
11. Watch the B5 movie ""A Call to Arms""
This movie lays the groundwork for the spin-off TV series ""Crusade"".
12. Watch the B5 movie ""The Lost Tales"" [Thanks to Eric Pregosin for his comments to build on the original list]
13. Watch the B5 movie ""The Legend of the Rangers"" [Thanks to Lisa for her recommendation]
14. Watch Crusade Series
15. Season 5: watch final episode ""Sleeping in light""

The question which is debated in several other reviews is: Despite the release dates of the material produced, in what order should it be seen? In particular, if the viewer is a total new comer to the series. The above is an attempt to give some structure to great content so it is more enjoyable as a complete work.

PS - It is astounding that the Warner marketing dept. gives no official recommendation on how these products should be best enjoyed.",1103846400,"1,177",1895,4.446685878962536
3913600,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"So if you don't know Babylon 5, then nothing I say in this review can clue you into it fully. ""B5"" is a novel made for television over five seasons, with characters that really evolve and change and stories that don't return to the ""ground state"" at the end of the hour. It broke new ground in many areas, while tipping its hat to film, TV, and print sci-fi in others.

Watching B5 is amazing in a lot of ways. For example, little bits, even stray remarks, from one episode will affect the outcome of something else in another episode. There are role reversals and there are different perceptions of the same event in different episodes.

Plus a nifty musical score, the first all-CGI special effects, adequate acting, and a big intricate plot.

And you can own it. In one box.

The DVD set is beautifully produced. The episodes are in wide-screen and beautifully sharp. The Dolby surround sound is crystal clear. The ""extras"" in each season are nice.

There is a small nit, which is that you don't get the pilot episode (The Gathering) and you'll want that. Owning B5 frees us at last from the vagaries of repeats on the Sci-Fi channel (when there are any) or decaying video tape.

If you know B5, you'll want to own this collection. Note: there are plenty of bad Chinese knockoffs on the 'net. The quality doesn't compare to the US product.",1103068800,10,1342,4.547717842323651
3913601,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"When I was in college I made good friends with this guy who lived off campus, and I'd go over to his house to watch TV.  Well, He had recorded **EVERY** episode on VHS as they aired.

My friend was convinced that I needed to watch this show, and so played the pilot movie for me.  I was intrigued so we continued on to the first episode.  Let's just say that the hook was sunk after that!

I found reasons to come over and watch the next episodes, and then came New Years! (Or some other holiday, I can't remember now)  Anyway, we watched something on the order of 10 episodes in one day.

The plot is intriguing and twisting, and is great for those of you who like to engage your brain while watching.  There is some interplay between the episodes that causes some of the relationships to become clear, and to enable you to figure out *some* of what is going on before you are blatantly told.  At the same time, the interplay is not necessarily overt and readily seen, because my friend (who later became roommate) kept being amazed at some of the things I was picking up on.  He hadn't noticed them until his second or third time through.  There were even a couple of things I was able to point out to him (after I understood the universe a little better.)

That parenthesis brings up a good point.  This universe is not like any other you've come across.  You can't make assumptions about the characters simply because you've watched Star Trek since you were nursing.

*****Final Thoughts*****

This is sitting in my hot little hands to give as a Christmas gift.  (To my wife, so it's not completely selfless!!!) I look forward to seeing the DVD's where the video won't be as grainy, and there will be no competetion to see who can zip through the commercial break and land closest to the scene return without going over!

As my friend knows, this is a great series to watch with someone who has never seen it, and I look forward to remembering things as my wife watches through the series for the first time.  The new viewer's interest helps keep yours going.

This is definately and intriguing and fun show!

*****Price Thoughts*****

You COULD buy each of the individual ones:

I recommend buying this set:

.....Because it is discounted from the individual price

3913603,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"I'll admit that I never really got into B5 during its televised run. I only really liked it for the opening credits music. And after I sat through the entire first season after my buddy begged be to, I still wasn't all that interested. But I continued watching, and there came a point where I didn't stop saying ""Holy crap OMGWTF they did NOT just do that!!!"" until the series ended. It's just stunning, it really is. Somehow, I never got tired of Sheridan's neverending melodramatic rants and speeches, or of Ivanova's bottomless well of Russian cynicism, or of Delenn's infinite Minbari wisdom. Nor did I get tired of the amazingly crappy-looking, almost Tron-like space battles. I mean, for the love of Buddah, the space battles in War Planets looked better than this. But none of that really mattered, because it was a five-year story arc all planned out from the beginning. JMS played an entire hand of trump cards, entire civilizations rose and fell, wars were waged and major characters got waxed. There were enough revelations to make a person dizzy. Star Trek and Farscape are ""good,"" but Babylon 5 showed its viewers what it takes for a show to truly be called ""Great""

Unfortunately, there was fear that the show would not get a fifth season, so the story arc was heavily abbreviated in the fourth season, with the ""Shadow War"" being comprised of a whopping two battles, and then stretched too thin in the fifth. The ""Telepath War"" that had been built up to for 4 seasons was a huge disappointment, and the evil, personality-deprived skank hoe that took over the station was a very poor substitute for Susan Ivanova. The void left by Ivanova was partially filled by Lyta Alexander's newfound kinkiness and power-tripping, which are a lot of fun to watch.

So while B5 is certainly not without its flaws, and while Andromeda is easily the best overall space show to date, I believe that this show, by virtue of the ambition behind it and the decent execution thereof, should be mandatory viewing for anyone who has ever watched television. It's just that awesome.",1092528000,14,2073,4.77158774373259
3913604,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"The TV series ""Babylon 5""(1994 - 1999), a  Warner and TNT production created by J. Michel Straczynski, was inspired in hindu-asiatics religions and explore Arcthurians legends.

The first season opening summarizes very well the series essence: ""It was the dawn of the third age of mankind, ten years after the Earth/Minbari war. The Babylon Project was a dream given form. Its goal, to prevent another war by creating a place where humans and aliens could work out their differences peacefully. It's a port of call - home away from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs, and wanderers. Humans and aliens wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons of spinning metal, all alone in the night. It can be a dangerous place, but it's our last best hope for peace. This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place is Babylon 5"".
An unforgettable cult series. (...)",1089417600,6,1703,4.930313588850174
3913605,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"J. Michael Straczynski (jms) created the space station Babylon 5 and spent years getting it produced and on the air. It premiered about the same time ST: Deep Space Nine did, and for a while, fans compared the two. It was almost ""apples & oranges"" time, but it was tried.
As a long-time Trek fan, I was surprised when I first saw the pilot (""The Gathering"") in 1993. I was absolutely stunned. Why Babylon 5, not just Babylon Station? Well, #s 1 - 4 were sabotaged & destroyed; # 4 disappeared after going on-line. (Disappeared? It's 5 MILES LONG, for crying out loud!) Word was that this would be an on-going, progressive five year story arc, the likes of which hadn't been done before on US television. Risky.  Okay, jms had my attention.  I couldn't wait for the series.  When it finally did air, I (being cynical of tv production in general) figured it wasn't going to stay as good. It didn't. It steadily got better.
I repeat, I speak as a long time Trek fan (beginning with the original series - skip Voyager, I did). B5 is one of the best televison series ever produced. Note I did not say ""science fiction series."" (It is THE best s/f series ever put up to the audience.) I introduced several non s/f fans to the series, as a dramatic series and they all loved it. (So much for ""only for space opera hounds."")  The story arc freed Straczynski (he wrote 90% of the scripts) from having to make everything ""come right"" in a 45 minute time slot, and off it went.
Crowd scenes were, well, crowded, with humans of all types and aliens as extras wandering through scenes. (The aliens, by the way, are much more than odd skin colours, strange noses and ""hair."") The station wasn't pristeen, the population wasn't always picture perfect. We have shysters, homeless, personal problems, espionage, humour, betrayal, relationships, and deaths (being in the opening credits did not guarantee survival, and it didn't always happen at the end of a season). Opening credits and theme music changed every year.  One character's very appearance even changed dramatically.  The plotlines are tight, and the threads are woven into five years of shows. The special effects are believable. (Yes, you could ""hear"" space battles, but hey, cut them some slack - NASA asked for plans of the Starfuries for reference for future space station repair vehicles.) B5 was the first show to rely on CGI effects, born out of budget necessity. More than once, watching the show, I found myself pounding the furniture with excitement - and we won't go into (here) what I did during series finale ""Sleeping in Light.""
Sinclair, Sheridan, Ivanova, Garibaldi, G'Kar, Londo, Lennier, Vir, Na'Toth, Talia, and Lyta came into our home as people with problems. The characters grew and changed and made choices and dealt with the consequences of those choices for good or bad. G'Kar (Andreas Katsulas) put it best: no one on Babylon 5 is exactly what they appear.  Keep a score card handy:  this week's ally may be next month's enemy.  There is no clear deliniation of good guys and bad guys - mostly it's all shades of grey. Acting (with the exception of one season five regular) is superb.
Action, yes.  Yet one of the most moving episodes is a one-on-one battle of wits and nerve between two characters in a single room.  Wars - some with aliens, some between alien races, and some with just us humans - start & end.  There are four ambassadors from alien races on board, with a League of Non-Aligned Worlds to complete the roster.  Telepaths of all races (except the Narns) add more colour.  Intrigue, smuggling, dealing, double-dealing, romance, all leavened with humourous touches throughout - what more could you ask!
For the first four years, the hardest part of being a B5 fan was FINDING it. (Our local station played ping-pong with its time slot.) To own uncut, widescreen versions on DVD of the whole story arc was a dream we had. Thank heavens, it's one dream which became reality.
If you have seen B5, welcome back.  If  you haven't, welcome aboard.  However, Babylon 5 is a whole complete story, with a beginning, a middle, and an end.  View it that way.  Start with the pilot (""The Gathering,"" not included in this set but available) and then move to Season One.  Enjoy.  This is a unique series.",1088985600,178,4276,4.705093833780161
3913606,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Unlike most other television series, where you know the main characters will be the same at the end of each show, B5 has episodes that move the show along a huge ""arc"" of a story. Although it may be nice to pick the best bits out of other science fiction series like Star Trek for your home, there is a lot of value in having the COMPLETE collection of Babylon 5 (or more!).  Not *just* for the sake of having the ""whole story"" though: this is one of the consistently best written and thoughtful television series ever, sci-fi perfection; even the ""worst"" episodes are clever.
Along with ""The Prisoner"", this is one of the ""must have"" TV series for any collector, a thought-provoking brilliant work of art.  As with Blake's 7 you don't know who will be left at the end of each episode. Like Quinn Martin (Invaders, Fugitive, 12 O'Clock High), JMS keeps it all perfectly-paced exciting entertainment. As with the Onedin Line and serious British sagas, the overall story and character development is what makes tv worth watching for me.  Pay special attention to Vir's development - I think his character is in many ways a metaphor for the show and mankind in general. Also be prepared to find more in the details of shows even after rewatching episodes, and tributes to others (and even LOTR) in names and ship designs.
The Amazon pricing for the 5-series collection is noticeably less than the individual series or any combination of other multi-season collections (which seem to be more than buying the individual series). You will probably want to also get the pilot episode too.",1087171200,13,1581,4.741818181818182
3913607,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"All the wonderful writing, all the beautifully realized effects, all the real-world physics, and all the satisfyingly three-dimensional characters can now be had in one easy to purchase box set.  Lucky you!  Those of us who count ourselves B5 fans waited breathlessly for each year to come out, hoping that WB would see fit to bring them all out (like the series itself, there were often such questions).  We sent off our $70-$90 for each year, and hoped the product would be worth the hard-earned bucks.  They were.  I don't know from 16:9 this or anisotropic that, I only know that these fill the screen with beautiful, vibrant color, and exceptional sound quality.  And to top it all off, the boxes for each year are quite attractive in their own right.  And now, you can get the entire treasure trove for a one time price that's less than I paid for all five over the years, and you get the joy of getting them all at once!  If I didn't have them already, I'd be feverishly poking in credit card digits right now.  You should, too.  This is a wonderful opportunity to see TV done right; this may well be the best show ever, of any type, period.  Buy now, and avoid the rush.  You'll be glad you did.",1086825600,8,1203,4.442922374429224
3913608,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Babylon 5 is, by far, the best television series made.  The main reason is that JMS envisioned his story in a five-year story arc, and it was completed despite problems.  As much as I'd love to see more of the Babylon 5 universe, the spin-off wasn't so great, and I would hate to see the 5 year story arc be ruined by attempts to lengthen the story anymore.
For anyone who enjoys science fiction, a great story with continuity, and dark humor, this is a good series for you.",1084579200,7,474,4.314606741573034
3913609,5,B002DUJ9Q6,It reads like a good novel.  This is a good as TV gets.  If you are at all into sci-fi I strongly urge you to see this series and then read the books.  Especially the Psi Corps and Technomage trilogies.,1083542400,4,202,4.0
3913610,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"...if you can't deal with not having plotlines neatly tied up at the end of each episode!
This overlying continuity is what hooked me to the B5 series - story arcs that weren't resolved on a per-episode basis!  A bit different from the typical (at the time) sci-fi format of ""end of episode, everything's tidy again, all back to normal!""  Personally, I liked the idea of wanting to watch the next week because I wanted to see how the *story* (as opposed to just the characters and the universe in general) continued to be told.
Bottom line here is that I wouldn't recommend anyone spend hundreds of dollars on a DVD set of ANY series they're not already somewhat familiar with - be it B5, Star Trek, or whatever.",1081382400,,712,4.511627906976744
3913611,5,B002DUJ9Q6,"Babylon 5 is a five mile long space station. Located deep in neutral territory, it is designed to prevent intergalactic war by providing a place where peace can be worked out between the races. Run by Earth, it was built with help from the Minbari after our war with them when we were almost wiped out. Since it is also a trade station, it attracts aliens of all kinds on a daily basis.
Unfortunately, it also attracts trouble. There are raiders in the area, the Narn and Centauri have at best a fragile peace, and someone is always trying to smuggle something on board. Even worse, an ancient enemy is rebuilding forces, and the effects of this will reach all the way back to Earth.
Babylon 5 is still unique in television. It set out to tell a single story that had been mapped out beforehand over five years. Now you can own the entire story on DVD, minus a few movies and the spin off series.  Season 1 is the most uneven and hardest to get into, but the beginnings of the story are there, and it lays the background on the races and cultures we will be dealing with over the course of the show. Season 2 brings a new captain and a storyline that is gaining speed, season 3 brings surprises and increasing tension, and season 4 is full steam ahead as most of the plot lines are resolved.  Season 5 was a last minute reprieve, so it starts slow since it has little previous story to immediately resolve like the previous years have.  By the half way point, however, you are once again hooked.  If you stick with season 1, you will get hooked and need to watch all five seasons to find out how the story ends.  I certainly did, and I continue to watch.  It's one of my favorite TV shows of all time.
Of course, if you are looking at this page, odds are you are already a fan and looking for information on the sets. The picture, presented in widescreen, is hit and miss, with some dust popping up occasionally. It is clear and sharp most of the time, however. Sound is presented in full surround and has never sounded better. Each set contains two audio commentaries by series creator J. Michael Straczynski and a season intro by cast and crew. They also have some behind the scenes documentaries and encyclopedia entries introducing you to the world of Babylon 5. All the sets but season 1 have one audio commentary each by various cast members and great blooper reels hidden in the data files area as Easter eggs.
Whether you buy the seasons bundled like this or individually, don't miss your chance to own this fantastic TV series.  Bought here, all you'll be missing are the original pilot (""The Gathering""), the later made for TV movies, and the spin off series Crusade.",1081209600,119,2677,4.451020408163266
