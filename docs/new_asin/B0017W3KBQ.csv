3176103,5,B0017W3KBQ,I have passed this documentary on to several military men who are amazed at what's on this tape.  When you look at the way things have gone down you realize that terrorism begins at home.  Our government is corrupt so no need in criticizing anyone else.  The rich have made a ton of money faking reasons for having wars.  I never believed that we didn't know exactly where Osama is.  That's why we're not looking for him.  Same reason why OJ didn't look for the real killers.  You don't look for someone when you know where they are.,1229040000,10,533,4.377551020408164

8267588,5,B0017W3KBQ,"Loose Change:  2nd Edition Recut is a must see.  This documentary methodically and scientifically presents and exceedingly strong case of why 9/11 events could not have occurred as reported to us by the government and media.  I strongly recommend that everyone see this movie.  It can be seen free on the internet, but some people just won't sit down and watch an internet documentary.  After seeing this documentary which lays a good foundation, I recommend seeing Zero:  An Investigation into 9/11.  This documentary is not a repeat of Loose Change, but presents additional extremely convincing evidence.  Both documentaries are a must.  ""Make the lie big, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it"" by Hitler.  ""Think of the press as the great keyboard on which the government can play""  by Joseph Goebbels.  We've been played.",1313020800,4,840,5.095588235294118
8267589,4,B0017W3KBQ,"I purchased the DVD version of this documentary. I was intrigued by the claims of the three young producers of this film. Their primary purpose was clearly that of raising questions about the tragedies of September 11, 2001.

The Pentagon building explosion is the first section. The information presented in the first part is thought provoking and leads to the viewers' wondering if then Sec. Rumsfeld was truthful (he certainly was not on other matters) on the crash and expolsion.

The second section detailing descrepencies of the collapse of the Twin Towers (separate events) raises the idea that explosives, placed earlier, brought the buildings down. I thought this section cohered, is unified, and more strongly researched.

The section dealing with Flight 93 was weak. The weakness centers around the claim that the passengers were taken off the plane at another airport in Ohio, perhaps a NASA facility adjacent to that airport and Flight 93 sent back into the air to crash in Pennsylvania. The producers do raise the lack of a debris field for the downed jetliner. Only a mere crater is to be seen where the plane is supposed to have crashed.

Despite the weakness of the third section, I do strongly recommend that persons buy and view this DVD as an alternative to the official version.",1286928000,3,1299,4.944954128440367
8267590,5,B0017W3KBQ,"I'm a believer for sure, that the events of 9/11 weren't as claimed by our government. This is just one of a 'collection' of DVDs I had acquired on the events of 9/11. And all raise questions and doubts of what the American public was told about the so-called truth of those events.

I have to recommend not only this title, but the numerous others available on the market that raises unanswered questions of the real truths behind that event.

It's so hard to believe so much of the American public still believes what the government had stated about this, when so much of it is so easily discredited.

I hope that one day, these truths will come out, and those 'really' responsible will be brought to justice. Then again, we're all still waiting for the truths about the JFK assassination, and the aliens and spacecraft being held at area 51, going back to the 1947 crash at Rosewell NM...

I know this, and other similar documentaries will 'never' air on television, and not because of any rights, monentary compensation or other such issues, but because the government still controls the media, and would never allow such documentaries to air for the majority to see.

It's only those select few that have purchased, rented, borrowed, or viewed over the Internet, such documentaries that holds to their beliefs that we were 'not' told the truth about what transpired, or who was really responsible for 9/11.

If more people watched this, and other similar documentaries, there would be more of a demand among the public for a 'true' investigation of these events.",1285027200,3,1567,4.785185185185185
8267591,5,B0017W3KBQ,"If you're suspicious about the activities of the US Government and the underlying truths that drive its behavior, you want to see this movie... OR, maybe you SHOULDN'T... Please read on...

Many of us have long been ...SUSPICIOUS about the Government since ...SOME personal particular point in time... For me, it was the Kennedy assassination (and don't forget our involvement in Vietnam, Watergate, and OTHER controversies too numerous to mention-everybody has a different ""place in time""), so when I saw THIS, I had to watch- at least ONCE...

In my opinion, however, you actually should watch this TWICE (I waited about a week), so all the facts can be logged into one's memory... I said earlier ""maybe you SHOULDN'T""- The facts presented here are, once again, in my opinion, earthshaking... I dare say AFTER seeing it twice, you'll have a hard time watching the news without wondering what you are REALLY seeing... So, if that sort of thing bothers you, move on, dear reader... OTHERWISE, I would heartily recommend you BUY this movie.

The production is somewhat lacking when compared to some other documentaries, but I think if you take into consideration that these filmmakers had a noticeably smaller budget, you'll find they did an excellent job. The editing puts a lot of startling information in front of you in a relatively short amount of time... Hence, the ""watch it two times"" observation...

All in all, a 5-star effort worthy of your consideration.",1265760000,23,1465,5.016460905349795
8267592,5,B0017W3KBQ,"Wow!  This DVD is only for ""Intelligent Minds"" who want to take a closer look at that fateful date & event that changed the perception of worldviews for many of us. Just a straight-forward, look at the actual facts surrounding the event itself, and the answers...or lack thereof, of how this could have occurred, and the lies that were told to the public nationally within a mere few hours of the event. Yes, most of us were just in plain shock... but we don't have to stay in denial. When events occur, there is a pattern or a design in which answers should be somewhat clear and concise. Not 'evidence' of buildings having 'holes made from planes that are much larger than the hole itself!"" If you're interested in REALLY taking a look at evidence that has been collected before, during and after the attacks, seeing and hearing from people who were not only there, but who also have first-hand evidence and experience that is contrary to what we have been lead to believe, which certain entities have tried to 'suppress,' then this video is one to see. Check out the contents, view the evidence and then... COME TO A CONCLUSION FOR YOURSELF!",1260662400,3,1144,4.635467980295567
8267593,2,B0017W3KBQ,"I am suspicious of the U.S. Government as any thinking person should be.  Everyone should know that government
exists primarily to forward it's own interest which is to preserve and increase it's own power.  Loose change points out several troubling details about the event of 9/11 maintaining that the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and on the World Trade Center were in fact perpetrated by the U.S. Government in order to justify another war among other reasons.
  I enjoyed the show and was very disturbed by the segment about the crash into the Pentagon actually being a missile attack.  I found the segment very convincing.
  I do not wish to give away too much, so just let me conclude by saying that this documentary is definitely worth another look.",1257292800,4,760,4.844961240310077
8267594,5,B0017W3KBQ,"This is an extremely well-documented study of the events on and before 9/11/01.  I am not a conspiracy nut, and generally dismiss most ""sensational"" documentaries, but this one is different. Its producers go to great lengths to give historical, empircal data to support their assertions.  The viewer is left to connect-the-dots.  What an amazing video!  Why isn't this on prime-time TV?  Seems the mainstream media is part of a conspiracy of silence on this material.  I highly recommend this video for any person capable of exercising critical thought.",1247529600,4,553,5.2272727272727275
8267595,5,B0017W3KBQ,This is an excellent (I think the best) introduction to the events surrounding the events on 9/11.  The producers encourage everyone to make free copies and distribute the film to everyone.  A refreshing concept and I think very important as the best electorate is a well educated one. Give it a try.  Believe what you will but you will certainly be impressed with the research and the very comprehensive filming.  A high quality work with a very important message.,1246147200,4,465,4.848101265822785
8267596,5,B0017W3KBQ,"This is one of those movies that everyone needs to see, hands down.  Highly recommended!",1242086400,4,88,4.866666666666666
8267597,5,B0017W3KBQ,"This version is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better than the Final Cut. The Final Cut is more watered down to appeal to a larger audience, and while they introduce more 'facts' and data, the overall product is kind of blas compared with the primary editions. Would definately recommend this product to anyone; spread the word!

Great seller, fast service, would buy from again.",1237075200,5,364,5.066666666666666
