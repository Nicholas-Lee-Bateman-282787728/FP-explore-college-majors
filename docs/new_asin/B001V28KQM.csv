8345428,4,B001V28KQM,"I orginally purchased this dvd for the segments on extensions. The parts on the extensions were skimpy, but it helped with placement. I would say the dvd is more geared toward the makeup and how to pull together a look. I purchased it for roughly $10 not including s/h and I feel it is only worth that. If it cost $40 or $50 I would be highly disappointed.  Overall, its a good buy for the price and the tips.",1258070400,,409,4.177215189873418
