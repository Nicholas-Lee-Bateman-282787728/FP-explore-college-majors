6600362,5,B00MRDW4H0,"I have been waiting for this movie forever! Love, Love Love it!  Miss Jon-Erik Hexum so much!",1454457600,,93,4.470588235294118
6600363,5,B00MRDW4H0,Jon-Erik Hexum! What else do I have to say?,1452988800,,43,3.888888888888889
6600364,5,B00MRDW4H0,"Why 5 stars? I really do miss Jon-Erik Hexum, such a tragedy. If I could go back in time....I would find a way to stop it. Anyway, 5 stars for him. The movie is high camp fun. No doubt about it, take a cowboy from Nevada and make him a Model in 1983 in the big city of NYC and voila...CAMPY fun. For those of us from that time you will see a lot of familiar faces. for the movie Jon-Erik faces trials and tribulations, crushes and heartbreak and tragedy. Needless to say the only real serious drawback in this movie has to be Joan Collins, NEVER was, has been or ever will be an actress, all she does is pout, shake her head in very odd ways and huff and puff! Who was the genius who ever put her in her first movie? Awful. But Jon-Erik, he does fine (first role?) he is missed very much by me. Rest in peace, Jon.",1447977600,,814,4.0

6600366,4,B00MRDW4H0,The only tv movie made by late Jon-Erik Hexum. It is a sad and wonderful look of what could have been.,1438128000,,102,3.9047619047619047
6600367,5,B00MRDW4H0,"It was pretty good. At first, I just wanted to see Jon-Erik Hexum shirtless as I remembered this movie when I saw it when I was 13 but there is a story. He had a dream and modelling gave him the money to achieve it so it was a happy ending. I liked it a lot.",1433462400,,258,3.625
6600368,5,B00MRDW4H0,"The picture quality is excellent!  They must have used the original film elements for the DVD.  There is NO menu, although there are chapters to which you can advance or back up using your remote keys, but you're sort of flying blind until you get used to where they are.  There is also no closed captioning or subtitles, a minor quibble for an otherwise superb disc.",1428105600,2,367,4.53030303030303
6600369,5,B00MRDW4H0,Been waitng a long time for this movie to come out on DVD.  The quality is real good.,1426550400,,85,3.7222222222222223
6600370,5,B00MRDW4H0,"I've had a copy I made from a VHS tape to CD; and, when I saw this was finally available decided to invest the money and see if it looked as good as the reviewers had said.  All I have to say about the picture quality is WOW!!!!!  An excellent video transfer.  Anyone who is a  die hard Jon-Erik Hexum fan must get this!  It's fun to look back at the television shows we used to watch and enjoy the differences time has brought about.  Sad to see such a young talented actor pass, but it makes you feel good seeing his work being incorporated again into a new DVD, and serve as a remembrance to such a deserving actor.  I only hope the last television action series he was involved with will become a DVD set. (HINT, HINT)",1426032000,3,722,4.151079136690647
6600371,5,B00MRDW4H0,This is a great movie. Once again Jon-Erik Hexum had his roll down to an art. We really miss him and I believe with out a doubt he would have been bigger the Tom Cruise and Brad Pit. Jon-Erik Hexum was one of a kind.,1425772800,,216,3.8222222222222224
6600372,5,B00MRDW4H0,"Amazing made for TV movie now on DVD! I couldn't be happier, although I am still not parting with my original VHS tape, So yeah now I own both formats!",1424995200,,151,4.066666666666666
6600373,5,B00MRDW4H0,"My wide absolutely adored and continues to adore Jon-Eric Hexum . We're both 51 . Until I met my wife a couple of decades ago , I'd never heard of the guy . It doesn't sound like his ""Christian"" birth name now does it ? It is though . Beside the point . Like none other , save perhaps Brad Pitt and Ron Ely , my lady worshiped (worships) Jon . Shortly after getting to know my Mrs. , i became aware of this film but was never able to witness it myself . My wife had seen and would laugh and regale me with the memory of it's network showing . I always vowed that if this ridiculous film ever became available on DVD or Blu , I'd get her a copy and surprise her . She beat me to it .
It's an excellent print to my eyes . I'm not a ""visualphile"" like many here at Amazon and can't speak knowingly to it's ""grain"" or ""darks"" , etc...lol . The film itself is a hoot though . Totally . I've seen it twice now and it doubled me over with laughter both times . Get your wife or girl a copy and enjoy it together . It's priceless . I promise you . And she'll thank you .",1423872000,,1062,3.8099547511312215
6600374,5,B00MRDW4H0,Joan Collins if youlike her it's good,1423612800,,37,4.428571428571429
6600375,5,B00MRDW4H0,"Jon-Erik is so gorgeous in this movie that you almost don't care about the story because you are so focused on his incredible good looks.  Watching the movie I couldn't help thinking how sad it is that he passed away so young because it is hard to imagine that he wouldn't have become a ""Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt.""  The story is actually pretty good and the film entertaining.  It is sad to see Jeff Conaway's character, a model whose career is on the decline, also be a heavy drug user.  Sort of like life imitating art since he was an admitted drug and alcohol abuser in his later years.  Joan Collins is at her best, as the driven business woman.  My only fault with the plot is that I found it a little difficult to believe Jon-Erik's character would fall in love with a woman twice his age.  If you are a Jon-Erik Hexum fan I recommend you buy this as he unfortunately did not leave behind a large body of work.",1421452800,6,915,4.254335260115607
6600376,4,B00MRDW4H0,"I enjoyed this movie when it first aired on television and had it on VHS, but lost it several years ago. I've always wished it would be made available. The quality of the DVD is excellent from a visual and audio perspective. The only disappointment is that the movie is not 1.77:1 aspect ratio as advertised, it is 1.33:1. That said, I am thrilled to have it in my collection, and anyone who remembers it, or appreciates Jon-Erik Hexum, would be well-advised to purchase it!",1421280000,,474,4.588235294117647

6600378,4,B00MRDW4H0,"This movie came two yrs before I was born and I always heard some of my family members talk about the flim & how good it was. So when I seen it being sold on amazon , I will half order this movie and watch it to see what all fuss is about. This is great tv movie folks with whole lot life lessons and truth , hey guys don't let title steer you away from this hidden gem. Dvd has crisp picture and sound. I think this movie with knockout performances by Joan Collins, Jeff Conway & Jon Erik Hexum would make a great gift for most anybody. Order your copy today.",1418342400,2,560,3.9646017699115044
6600379,5,B00MRDW4H0,"This iconic, classic TV movie was filmed in 1983, but the dvd has such a stunning and exquisite picture quality that the movie looks like it was filmed yesterday! I never thought I'd see this movie looking so flawlessly beautiful!

The movie stars the legendary Joan Collins as a NYC executive at a modeling agency. Joan finds a beefy young stud (Jon-Erik) and she turns him into a top male model. After Joan and Jon-Erik attend a costume party together, she begins having sex with him, even though she is literally twice his age (Joan was 50 when she made this movie.)

Another part of the story involves Joan helping Jon-Erik adapt to working with gay men all the time. He also has a gay male roommate (Jeff Conaway) who is also a male model, but he has turned to drug addiction, since he is considered ""past his prime"" at 35 years old.

Ted McGinley also has a supporting role as another male model who is Jon-Erik's main competition for getting modeling jobs.

I HIGHLY recommend this campy, cult classic TV movie! It is so much fun and it's a real time capsule of the 1980's!",1417478400,8,1080,4.494897959183674
6600380,5,B00MRDW4H0,"This t.v. movie n its on way is as good as Gia with Jolie. It teaches good morals and is a excuse to look at beefcake. Voyagers is more educational. The Bear has awesome acting
by Gary Busey. Cover-Up was (in my humble opinion ) the worst of the scripts Hexum chose
but it had great stunts. Hexum was barely in ""The Bear"" yet that he was chosen to be in that says much. Hexum was brawn with brains as they say. I like watching him dive even now though Louganis is number one at that. Maybe someday springboard diving will further improve.",1415318400,,538,4.233009708737864
