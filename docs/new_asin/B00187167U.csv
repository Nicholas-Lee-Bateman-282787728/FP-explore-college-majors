3411948,3,B00187167U,I think this will be a good discussion video.  I'm not sure just how to frame this bible study as there may be some controversial subject matter included in this video.  That is going to make for good discussion sessions if I can frame the subject matter acccordingly.,1359936000,,268,4.5625

3411950,4,B00187167U,"Jesus - The Missing History presents the inquiry of one man to discover if the faith of his childhood is true.

The DVD is enjoyable to watch because of the interesting information presented.  For example, I did not know that the Roman census described in the Gospel of Luke (for which Jesus' parents had to travel to Bethlehem) is problematic for conservative Biblical scholars.  Apparently, Roman census regulations from that time told everyone - as would be expected - to stay home.  Furthermore, the date of that census was 6 A.D. which is ten years after Herod the Great Died.  According to the Gospel of Matthew Herod the Great was alive when Jesus was born and so the date between the birth of Jesus in Matthew and in Luke is likely off by ten years.

Another fact I didn't know involved the increased tax on fisherman in 24 A.D. - right around the time when Jesus' ministry began.  Half of Jesus' disciples were fisherman and this tax may help describe why fisherman were receptive to Jesus' message.

The DVD is not Earth shattering or comprehensive.  However, it is a decent introduction to some tough questions that thoughtful Christians should consider.",1289088000,9,1165,4.785

8268590,2,B00187167U,"Too much worldly view.  Nothing backed by scripture.  And the man hosting, really spent a lot of time, basically saying, ""I have serious doubts and I am an expert - so listen to me.""  I was disappointed.",1480377600,,203,4.4324324324324325

8268595,2,B00187167U,"It really never answered any questions, only left you with more.  Touched on things I've known forever about the Essenes.  Honestly I could have provided more insight and opinion on this subject than this one gave.  Hey, I'm open to do it if there is a producer reading this.  There are much better documentaries out there.",1404950400,5,323,4.714285714285714

8268598,4,B00187167U,I saw this documentary on TV.  It is a good entry to the long list of recent documentaries about Jesus and his life and message.  The researcher asks good questions and has good interviews with various experts (the best of them is will Dominic Crossan).  My only complaint is that it is too short (less than an hour).  It should have been expanded to two or three hours to thoroughly explore the questions raised in the film.,1372636800,3,425,4.48051948051948
8268599,4,B00187167U,I liked this dvd because Kent Dobson was passionate in his quest to learn more about the life of Jesus and presented some thoughtful ideas.,1371600000,,139,4.6
