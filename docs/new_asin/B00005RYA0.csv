This movie can very well fit in some of today's issues,approach and action by authorites. Pedro J. Gonzalez was my grandfather.",1316131200,3,300,5.270833333333333

Thanks for having a copy of it.  It's hard to find anymore!",1245196800,2,205,4.230769230769231
7952992,4,B00005RYA0,"I heard about this movie many years ago, my friend living in a college town saw it at an art type movie theater. I finally found it on Amazon and I am so glad I did! This movie is a moving story of Pedro Hernandez, a Mexican immigrant who can count inventing the car radio as one of his many accomplishments. He fought against a racist and evil system that cost him many years of his life in prison. I absolutely recommend this movie to anyone interested in unknown history and especially those who are interested in Mexican American culture.",1132444800,4,542,4.43
