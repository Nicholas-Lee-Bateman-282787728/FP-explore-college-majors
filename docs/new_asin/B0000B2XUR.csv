7998033,4,B0000B2XUR,"This is an obscure, relatively unknown masterpiece
of martial arts cinema.
I was lucky to stumble upon it and gave it a chance.

All the elements come together.
The settings are great.
The music is great: funky and jazzy and over-the-top dramatic
The plot is more than adequate for this type of film.
The dubbing is mostly respectable.
The cinematography is excellent.
And the action and fighting is plentiful and first rate:
lots of great chase scenes and fighting everywhere and anywhere,
often very brutal and very good.

The full screen image is annoyingly deficient.
Much of the original film image is missing.
This DVD would have been so much better if
it had been a widescreen version.
I don't think that there is a widescreen version
out there, so this is it.

5 star film, 4 star DVD.
A must have for martial arts cinema fans.

note bene: if you are reading this
review for the VHS tape of the film
""Chinese Tiger"",
the information provided by Amazon
for the VHS is not for the same film
on DVD that I have reviewed here.",1265846400,,1030,4.551351351351351

I'm not saying it was a totally bad movie, but it sure wasn't that great either. I guess for the 6-7 bucks it cost, not that bad. I don't think i'd buy it again though.",1179100800,,270,3.8392857142857144
