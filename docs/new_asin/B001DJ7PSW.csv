8293796,5,B001DJ7PSW,This series is GREAT for all ages but especially for kids.  It does not push Global warming in the videos or focus on dying animals.  It instead is lighthearted and fun and exposes kids to Nigel's artic adventures.  My kindergarten class loves it!,1489449600,,247,4.6976744186046515
8293797,5,B001DJ7PSW,"I have a five year old who has been obsessed with arctic animals for well over six months now.  This is the longest obsession of her short life.  We've gotten just about every non-fiction, age appropriate book on arctic animals that is available (which, granted, isn't that many), as well as a few for adults that we've gone through too. For instance, we read ""Arctic Fox: Life at the Top of the World,"" a 232 page book, piece by piece, night after night, for her bedtime stories. Naturally, we've also gotten arctic themed movies and/or story-telling documentaries like ""Arctic Tale, ""Knut & Friends,"" and (this one I didn't like) ""The Great Polar Bear Adventure."" When I saw ""Arctic Exposure,"" I thought we'd give it a try, and I have to say that it's probably my favorite book or movie about the arctic of all the ones we own.

For one, you get to see just about every arctic animal, and not just the always glamorous polar bear. You see arctic foxes, lemmings (!), walruses, harbor seals, beluga whales, arctic wolves, musk oxen, ptarmigans, arctic terns, snowy owls, you name it. You can also see them in both their winter and summer coats when applicable (some don't change). And as much as I like nature documentaries, sometimes I could do without all the slow-motion shots of one animal (a polar bear, let's say) killing another (a ringed seal).  ""Arctic Exposure"" shows a few animals eating others, but it's certainly not the focal point, and the movie doesn't linger over this.  Because of the lack of violence, I found ""Arctic Exposure"" to definitely be kid-friendly, while at the same time, it was interesting to me as an adult.

Also, I found Nigel Marven to be very warm (especially considering his surroundings!) and charming. He seemed like he was just so happy to be in the arctic seeing all these animals and explaining how life works there.  His friendly narration was excellent.

Overall, if you or your child is interested in the arctic, this was a great DVD, and I highly recommend it.",1297123200,2,2007,4.714285714285714
