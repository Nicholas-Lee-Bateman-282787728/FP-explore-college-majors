8713723,4,B00WL33C9U,"Set in So Paulo this is the story of a group of gay men / boys. Mauro is as camp as Bloomingdales at Christmas and is friends with Rodrigo, they attend the Gay Parade with Mauro's uncle (who is also gay) and there they rescue Roger - married with kids and still in the closet. He is attacked by some homophobes and they intervene along with some lesbian activists.

Well after the wake up call they all agree to come out a year later and this is their story.

Now this is fairly lightweight as a comedy, the laughs tend to rely on the stereotyped reactions of Mauro and the lies and evasions of not having come out. The acting is all pretty solid. There is even a drag queen playing the mother of one of the characters. Also this is far from a sexathon, this is done for laughs and despite some serious issues coming into play, they are not really expanded upon.

Having said all of the above I did like this; it has not been universally received, but then what ever is. The ending may leave a bit to be desired too but I do not want to reveal the plot. I do like World cinema so was predisposed to watching this, but there are better Brazilian films out there `The Way He Looks' being a case in point but I think this is still worth a punt.",1437004800,6,1241,4.141078838174274
8713724,2,B00WL33C9U,"This is a nearly excruciating movie, contrived, artificial, and dull.  Its characters are nearly all caricatures, exaggerated and, with maybe a couple of exceptions, unconvincing as real, thinking, feeling human beings.  (One man's mother in law acts like a parody of a drag queen, if there can be such a thing.  This is a film where people behave as they do for certain effects, not out of any awareness of or attention to how people actually behave.)  Time after time, watching it, I found myself wincing, embarrassed by scene after scene in which people say and do things as people act and talk only in bad movies, false and almost painfully inauthentic.

  A few moments in it rise above the worst of it, allowing for a glimpse of what might be almost genuine emotional expression and convincing human behavior.  Two or three of the actors manage to find some depth in roles otherwise shallowly created, but one is so over the top that he is very hard to watch.  One wonders how his friends put up with his incessant self-attention and nonstop chatter.  But they seem mostly charmed or amused.  Perhaps the director believes that they thereby demonstrate their generosity.  But he is so extreme that he becomes quickly annoying, especially since he's on screen more than anyone else.  This movie has nothing to do with art.  It is instead a soap opera, trying for a more or less happy ending, though for it to be thought of as happy one must ignore a great deal of what has occurred in it.  That is, however, the nature of soap operas.  They have nothing to do with reality.  Superficiality and exaggeration are its inspiration, so to speak, allowing for a strange freedom to be as mindless as one likes just to keep the effects running and the plot spinning.

  Occasionally the movie attempts to probe deeper, to give its people something like real lives and feelings.  But such moments do not last long.  If it had looked further into them, it would not have been possible to resolve it as the director apparently thought the film ought to be resolved, though a better film, one more worth watching, might have emerged if it had allowed for genuine human complexity.  But that would require a different movie, better plotted and written, more truly observant of what it attempts to confront.  Boys in Brazil is rather a combination of comedy and melodrama, like a foolish soap opera mixed into a prolonged, unfunny sit com.  I watched it once with increasing discomfort.  I certainly wouldn't ever want to see it again.",1434067200,10,2526,4.723112128146453
8713725,4,B00WL33C9U,"This is a wonderful comical/drama. Very sexy and mixes a bold reality of coming to terms with yourself. Accepting yourself, and not caring what others say. This is a mix of dramatic drama with a relationship, and sexual exploration storyline. You the viewer become a part of each character. Each individual in this film stands out. Each one is sexy, beautiful, passionate, and is able to create their character in a memorable way that expresses the emotional appeal to their character, and plight taking place. Simply put, they own the role of the character, and create it as a real reality.

The storyline is touching and simple at the same time. A group of friends. A group of gay men, each one hiding who they are. Each abused in some homophobic fashion. Each one tired of hiding. Each one coming to terms, and expressing that they will come out by the next gay parade.

Directed passionately by Alexandre Carvalho. Loved the dramatic appeal and the overall emotional undertaking of the story written by Andre Colazzi. Something that also stands out is the beautiful and amazing cinematography, absolutely loved this reality to the film.

Yes the plot sounds simple, and yes it seems like, ""oh yeah I just come out of the closet"". But what people don't realize is how difficult, trying, emotional, and draining it is for an individual to accept who they are, and to come out to a society that still ridicules, abuses and faults homosexuals. What I like about this movie is it displays that reality of that struggle, and ultimate choice, but most of all this is a wonderful comedy. It's a friendship film. It's a compelling piece of cinema. It has an atmosphere of love and passion.

Now don't get me wrong, there are moments of a reality with the underlying themes that are very serious, such as I have mentioned, abuse against gay people, and those sad individuals who feel they have to create violence through actions, or through the Internet. Homophobic people are no better or different than the racist bigots during the Civil Rights movement. Homophobia should have no place in the world.
