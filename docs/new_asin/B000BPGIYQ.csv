2435734,5,B000BPGIYQ,"5.  Great.

Well done.  Its nice to see a movie that is timeless.  Show the kids.  Great movie to keep them occupied When cooking the Holiday Meal.",1385942400,3,147,4.296296296296297
2435735,5,B000BPGIYQ,This movie is great for the whole family. This movie is shows how comedy can be great without all the vulgarity of todays comedies.,1384214400,,131,4.5
2435736,5,B000BPGIYQ,Jerry Lewis was very funny in this movie.  The plot was good as well as the acting.  I would reccomend this one.,1361836800,,112,4.045454545454546
2435737,4,B000BPGIYQ,"I truly like Lewis films when he can mix seriousness with comedy, he can be a capable fighter are deep sea diver and at the same time make it funny. Filling a film with nothing but slap stick gets old fast, but Lewis pulled off just the right amount of silly in this one. I won't reveal any spoilers other than the fact that the story of him getting off the Island and not being awarded a metal for capturing all the Japanize on the island was never really addressed and the only let down of the film.",1358380800,,501,4.122448979591836
2435738,4,B000BPGIYQ,"Looking back on the sans-Dino body of work of Jerry Lewis. it's easy to sieze upon the ""little boy"" schtick he frequently used and call it clich&eacute;. But that's a cop-out because some form of it has always been a legitimate comedy trick in film. And it's been done more recently, from Mad TV's ""Stewart"" sketches as done by Michael McDonald to the SNL classic ""Simon"" as done by Mike Myers. And Lewis never fails to satisfy here as an immature and inept Naval officer, Lieutenant John Paul Steckler, heir of a long family tradition of nautical bumblers. But the latest Steckler has topped 'em all--try commanding a destroyer escort but, when it's time to muster out at the end of the war, losing track of the ship. It shows up on the inventory of ""equipment not returned"". Now he's going to have to pay for it. But the Navy does have a heart after all and assigns to Steckler a psychologist, Ensign Rita Benson (Dina Merrill) to help him remember what might have happened to the ship. The first attempt is hilarious when she puts him under hypnosis and takes him all the way back to what happened to a toy boat he was playing with in the bathtub when he was little. Another dilemma they have to deal with is when Benson meets Steckler's wife Prudence (Diana Spencer), who's just as childish as he is and immediately jealous of her husband's lovely therapist. Geez, and modern-day HBO viewers think Tony Soprano's shrink is a babe! But Benson, having no designs on Steckler, knows how to deal with her gently. And, since this is after all a comedy, the main problem works out well in the end. I'm not giving the ending away, but today's viewer, cynical enough about Government to imply that it's a four-letter word (GOVT), will appreciate the irony involved.",1151366400,7,1761,4.611464968152866
2435769,5,B000BPGIYQ,"""Don't Give Up the Ship"" is another Jerry Lewis golden oldie. This film seemed to be one of the more mellow Lewis classics, but it fit his style perfectly. I was able to feel his anxiety and frustration in most, if not all, of the scenes as his ability shined through.  Besides the content, the new mastering of the film in HD from a 4K scan was excellent- an extremely clear black and white picture. This is a keeper for Jerry Lewis fans.",1510531200,,439,4.289156626506024

2435777,1,B000BPGIYQ,"I hate it, but it is for just one reason, it hasn't yet edited in spanish. I've been looking for it even on dvd, just for collectors reasons or just to see it no matter the quality, but nothing and the fact is i don't understand that if is avaible in USA at least for a couple of years why it takes tooooo long to do it in spanish??? Maybe its clear that i can see it in english without problem but i want it for my son, and if its someone thinking about the idea of trying to get it in any other ways... i tried ""google"" to but nothing this is one of those movies thats seems to be swallowed by the time or just everyone forget about it.",1497916800,,638,3.877862595419847
2435778,5,B000BPGIYQ,There are funnier films with Jerry Lewis.  My husband is ex-military so he enjoys it alot.,1497830400,,90,4.625
2435799,1,B000BPGIYQ,"Unlike The Nutty Professor, considered by many to be Jerry's best film, this movie has a considerably weaker plot, with just married naval officer Jerry flipping back and forth between his attempt at having a honeymoon and his efforts to locate a WWII ship that disappeared under his command. Joke lines are extremely corny, even for Jerry Lewis, perhaps suited to Jerry's audiences in 1959, but boring and silly today. Die hard Jerry Lewis fans may like this movie, but doubtful that it would hold the interest of the average classic comedy movie aficionado.",1497484800,,559,4.957446808510638
2435800,5,B000BPGIYQ,"One of Jerry's first movies on his own and has a good story line. Funny in places, B&W came out great.",1497225600,,102,3.9047619047619047
2435801,4,B000BPGIYQ,"This black and white 1959  film, allegedly based on a true incident, takes a humorous look at the Navy. The story line is about a ship that has been ""lost"" and the officer responsible for it before it went missing. An inquiry is scheduled and the hunt begins; I won't spoil the story for those who haven't seen it, but if you decide to purchase it, you will find it entertaining. Notable supporting actors are Dina Merrill, Robert Middleton, Gale Gordon, Claude Akins, Mabel Albertson, Diana Spencer, and Mickey Shaughnessy.  It is a typical Jerry Lewis vehicle, leaving nothing out as far as comedic situations, dialog and stunts are concerned.  While I am not a Jerry Lewis fan, I enjoyed this and I did laugh a lot; Lewis is a master at his craft and I think this is one of his all over best comedies.

The DVD has simply designed front and back covers with all the right information; no frills on the inside. The film runs 99 minutes and is extremely  clear; good b/w tonal differentiation and no imperfections.  It is mastered in HD from a 4K scan. Sound is Dolby Digital.  There is no theatrical rating, but it is really viewable by everyone.  It is (1.85:1) anamorphic(fills the entire screen).  There are subtitles in English and chapter breaks to facilitate going to select parts of the film. The bonus material contains trailers from other films in the KL collection (licensed under Paramount Home Entertainment, Inc. as documented on the back of the case). I gave this a 4 star rating because, although the sound was crisp and clear, the instrumental music was set at much higher volume than the recorded dialog (typical of TV-style broadcasting that tries to draw you and keep your attention on the ads by making the ads louder than the show); a minor inconvenience that you can adjust yourself.  Have fun.  I did.",1496016000,2,1826,4.675

It's a RARE video, a RARE concert... but buy knowing what you are buying. OK?",1420156800,,281,4.109090909090909

2436018,4,B000BPGIYQ,"I remember watching this as a kid, at that time it was already a classic movie. Jerry delivered his usual innocent self caught in a myriad of piling problems and challenges. The story is simple but very good. It doesn't have the complicated visual effects and the script as earlier mentioned is simple",1418947200,,301,4.69811320754717

2436020,5,B000BPGIYQ,"Excellent movie with a great performance by Jerry Lewis, tender with his new bride (Diana Spencer, who does a marvelous job herself, and has great chemistry with Lewis), bumbling with the military, but always good-hearted and trying to do the right thing.

Still, if you have nothing better to do and might enjoy a Jerry Lewis film with slightly less schtick than others, this one is reasonably funny and has some interesting aspects of post-WW2 included in too.",1388707200,2,262,4.479166666666667

8090713,5,B000BPGIYQ,"Surprised me, and reminded me of just how funny Lewis could be. Looks great on Blu-Ray, the black and white gives a good impression of how these films looked when released in theaters. The mugging which turns off some folks to Lewis's work only pops up briefly, and he manages for most of the film to underplay and let the comedy happen unforced. Quite a few laugh-out-loud moments here. Enjoyed it and will go on my list to re-watch.",1517356800,,434,4.506329113924051

Jerry Lewis is a naval lieutenant who just got married but has to spend his honey-moon trying to find a battle ready navy war ship that he lost, misplaced???  Warning, 50's humor, may not be that funny today.",1510790400,,258,4.48936170212766
