66161,5,078322947X,"Mired in debt and also the jungles of South America, this movie is an outstanding example of what an action movie can ever hope to be. I consider this a benchmark to measure all others. What we are looking at is a lost treasure from the 70s era.  And proof that you do not need to rely on CGI to make an awesome action film. That being said, it had to be so dangerous on the set for everyone involved during the production of the film.  I'm actually surprised that nobody died during production.  The stunt work was incredible. I notice something new every time I watch it.  The acting and the story plot was right on point.  Roy Schieder gives us an outstanding performance like you've never seen before.  All the supporting actors were awesome as well. Even that terrorist guy became ""likeable"" by the end of the movie.  I would say ""keep up the good work!"", but I'm sure the insurance companies would never allow them to make a sequel...

Good sound, crisp visuals, and a first-rate cast make for an unforgettable film experience. Once the story gets rolling, the nerve-jangling tension does let up until the final moments. Roy Scheider was never better, and Friedkin's direction proves him to be a talented director at the peak of his form. Tangerine Dream's soundtrack is classic and adds greatly to the tense atmosphere. Too bad this film flopped in its first release; it's a classic that deserves a wider audience. Although it's a remake, it stands on its own as a classic.",1510531200,,631,4.962264150943396

The movie itself is a real classic and the transfer was made absolutely gorgeous! Almost to colorful picture, good contrast and a 5.1 Sound that satisfies me, considering the age of the film! There are no extras at all but the movie itself and I guess it's the the same disc you will find in the way more expensive edition with the printed booklet.

66219,5,078322947X,"William Friedkin's lost masterpiece. A great film about men fighting all odds and not fighting each other towards the goal of self preservation and escaping hell. A must see. Four men dangerously driving two trucks with nitroglycerin to put out a fire 200 miles away in the hills and deserts of South America.
Friedkin showed genius directing The French Connection. He followed that up with the original The Exorcist, the horror masterpiece. Next was this film Sorcerer.
It was not a pop culture smash like the previous two films, but it should have been. It is now a Revived Classic.
Afterwards Friedkin directed another film that struggled during its release but has since found its audience on DVD. The film Cruising showcases Al Pacino in one of his best performances. Luckily in 1985 Friedkin's film To Live and Die in LA received high praise and continues to find new audiences. In the 2000s Friedkin directed two intense versions of plays based on the writings of Tracy Letts.
I can't wait for his new documentary on a real life priest who performed exorcisms. William Friedkin's career and post success speaks for itself.",1497657600,,1129,4.9162303664921465

66223,5,078322947X,"Sorcerer is one of the most overlooked movies of 1970's that can be rightfully considered an ""undiscovered gem. The introductory credits appear onscreen in the same font used in The Exorcist, until the word ""Sorcerer"" appears, accompanied by orchestral high notes. The title then fades to reveal a demonic stone face, most likely of Mayan, Aztec, or Incan origin (inserted by director William Friedkin to mirror Exorcists Pazuzu effigy). Whats ironic is that Sorcerer is not about sorcery, wizards, or magic of any kindits entirely grounded in reality. The movie is named after a truck central to the plot, with Sorcerer scrawled across its hood in red paint.

If the bizarre mistitling was not enough to turn off a lot of potential viewers, Friedkin filmed Act 1 in several foreign languages, including French, Spanish, and German. This creates a cryptic, foreign language barrier that makes it hard to discern that Sorcerer is an English-language picture by a mainstream American director. Fifteen minutes into the film, Roy Scheider makes his screen debut, and his character arc introduces the first instance of English dialogue which continues for the rest of the movie.

Act 2 takes place in a remote Latin American slum, filled with social outcasts like Scheiders Jackie Scanlon, who assumes the alias Juan Dominguez. The riff-raff here live like cockroaches, in a sweaty, hot, stinking squalor. Its at the end of Act 2 that Sorcerers main storyline kicks in, when four of the shantytowns denizens are offered an escape: transport several live crates filled with nitroglycerin through the jungle to extinguish a blazing oil well located 200 miles away. The job pays $10K a head.

Sorcerer is more or less Friedkins allegorical vision of Purgatory. Four bad men make the cut to transport nitroglycerin in trucks over mud-filled roads that zigzag up and down mountains and through impenetrable walls of thick jungle foliage. An assassin, a terrorist, a fraud, and a gangster man two trucks cobbled together from junk parts. The trucks are named Sorcerer and Lazaro (a reference to the biblical Lazarus). Friedkin stated that the Sorcerer in this instance is no tangible character but fate"" itself, which is cruel and unpredictable like an evil wizard. Both trucks are forced through numerous obstacles, the most heart-pounding being a decaying rope bridge positioned over a flooding river during a torrential downpour.

Overall, Sorcerer is a solid four-star film, but Friedkins new 2014 Blu-Ray remaster adds on another star. The cinematography here is excellent, the picture crisp and clear. The excellent score composed by Tangerine Dream easily tops similar soundtrack composers of the era that made heavy use of synth and bass. I would rank this version a close second to The Exorcist as William Friedkin's best work.",1496620800,,2826,5.177242888402626
66224,5,078322947X,excellent transfer. The movie is ahead of its time. The look and feel of the entire story is so authentic. A must watch for any movie fan.,1495324800,,138,4.148148148148148
66225,3,078322947X,"There's a reason this movie never stood the test of time - it's a movie OF its time.  It has a great grungy look of the 1970's, but if you are looking for truly disciplined suspense sequences, go back to Clouzot's ""Wages of Fear"", the film which inspired Friedkin to do this thriller.  ""Sorcerer"" has some wonderful set-pieces, like the hair-raising bridge crossing scene, but in comparison to Clouzot's masterpiece isn't nearly as tight and is sloppier in shot composition and editing.  However, it's always a pleasure to watch Roy Scheider, whose wise guy humanity is a thing we could use more of today.",1494633600,,605,4.798076923076923
66226,4,078322947X,The movie seems to take a while to get going.  I watched this knowing it was a failed big budget movie.  Enjoyed Friedkin's style which is familiar from his more well known movies.  Some extraordinary scenes with the trucks in difficult terrain.  This came with no extras at all or in the packaging either.  Completely unavailable in Australia which is why I bought it.,1493164800,,369,4.703125
66227,5,078322947X,"Sorcerer (1977) is, for the most part, a forgotten classic. First the forgotten: this film got kicked around by moviegoers  when first released, probably because the title is misleading (nothing to do with fantasy), and they probably weren't in the mood for this film due to the sudden stratospheric success of another film that debuted at the same time (Star Wars). With Star Wars cementing the advent of the summer blockbuster, suddenly moviegoers wanted stuff more on the surface and eye candy for good measure. As a result, Sorcerer never got its footing, and was a major box office failure. If this film had debuted just a few years earlier, it would've done well, because it would've fit in with the other films of the time. The truth is that Sorcerer is an adaptation (not a remake) of The Wages of Fear from 1953. Now the classic: Sorcerer has since generated the respect it deserves, and is one of the best films of the 1970's. This film has it all: action, suspense, breathtaking and iconic scenes (the bridge scene being one), organic acting and a sort of 'raw' feel in terms of a lot of the settings; dwellings are dilapidated, and the machinery rusty.  Even the actors are dirty, sweaty, and have visible wounds throughout the film. I particularly like the restraint on the dialogue, as Friedkin chooses to tell the story more in a visual sense. I also like the uniqueness of the characters being kept at a distance from the audience; this makes them sort of mysterious and seems to work in this film. This film was a very ambitious project, one that has been rewarded with the passage of time (thankfully). The care that went into many scenes and accompanying special effects are obvious, and first rate. Overall, Sorcerer is a must-see. This blu ray has excellent picture and sound quality, so it was worth the wait in that regard. One last thing: it's extremely rare for a blu ray disc to not include any special features; in the case of Sorcerer, it's unfortunately true. Perhaps this fact tells us just how much of a beating this film took over the years. I guess we should feel grateful that it has even made it onto blu ray.",1490313600,,2144,4.639473684210526
66238,5,078322947X,"If you haven't seen this movie.... A pity. Sorry for your loss. This is a classic thriller -- far more riveting than The Exorcist -- and without a doubt Friedkin's best movie. It deserves to be seen in BluRay format, too.",1489536000,,221,4.414634146341464

66240,4,078322947X,"Saw this movie as a kid on the Air Force base in San Vito, Italy sometime back in the mid-70's.  Thought about it often over the years, as it left some kind of impression on me. I couldn't even remember it's name. I read a random article about it a few months before it was released on DVD talking about the story behind the movie, it's ill timing in theaters and how it was overlooked but now finally coming out on Blu-ray.  I was super surprised to learn that I had the Tangerine Dream soundtrack to it already and just never realized it even though the cover of the soundtrack is a shot of the famous scene of the bus crossing the bridge.  The article was right in that the name Sorcerer didn't really connect with the movie itself.

66246,5,078322947X,"After winning the Oscar for directing The French Connection and terrifying audiences with his follow up The Exorcist, William Friedkin was on a hot streak and intended Sorcerer to be a small film he could put out quickly before undertaking his next big film The Devils Triangle. Sorcerer gets a bad rap from film snobs who hate the idea of someone trying to remake a classic like The Wages of Fear. But having never seen that film I cant vouch for its sin, I see this as an incredibly tense thriller whose only mistake was being released just a week after Star Wars took over cinemas worldwide. In Sorcerer, 4 men from different parts of the world, all facing certain death back home, are stranded in a South American country ruled by an oil company whose refinery has exploded and can only be extinguished by blowing out its main well. But the explosives to be used have become highly unstable and can only be transported by truck over treacherous mountain roads, in other words, a suicide mission whose pay would guarantee safe passage out of the country. In a part originally intended for Steve McQueen, Roy Schieder plays the lone American leading the team of drivers who must have nerves of steel to undertake the mission. Not to mention be resourceful especially in one scene when an enormous fallen tree blocks the road. This is a remarkable film noted for the image of a multi-ton truck swaying at what has to be a 45 degree angle on a rickety rope bridge as it navigates a swollen river in a torrential rainstorm. Remember, this is before CGI and no miniatures were used. How this was done, I have no idea. Definitely a lost classic of the 70s with some incredible and hypnotic music by Tangerine Dream. Give this film a look, but be sure to stay for the twist at the end!",1484092800,,1781,4.5514018691588785

66339,4,078322947X,"SORCERER
William friedkin most underrated film, Roy scheider taking the lead role gives an amazing performance
who should've won an academy award for his acting performance in my opinion
a very confusing film there's no straight forward storyline
very different from Billy friedkin's other films
the film is made up of 6 stories, 1st is filmed in Mexico, 2nd is filmed in Jerusalem Israel, 3rd is filmed in Paris France
the 4th is filmed in New Jersey U.S. where we as an audience finally meet Roy scheider's character
the 5th story is filmed in a village in Latin america where roy is taken prisoner there
and the 6th is about Roy scheider's character and the credits come up
so no idea how the 2nd half of the film is connected with the previous 3 stories of the film it makes no sense to me
anyway Warner bros have the rights to the film & released it on blu-ray about 2 years ago for the first time ever
WB released it as Digi-book packaging where the pages explain the making of the film with interviews with William friedkin
tragically Roy scheider died about 6 years ago
well WB have reissued it again on blu-ray this time as standard blu-ray case, but no new extras just the usual Theatrical trailer
the HD transfer is excellent actually no Grain or dirt & the sound mix is 5.1 master audio mix
so whether you buy the 2014 Digi-book or this new blu-ray reissue the HD transfer is the same
about 4 stars based on excellent HD transfer & 5.1 mix",1469664000,,1451,4.458646616541353

Gorgeously filmed on actual film enhances this lost work of art all the more by adding richness to the surroundings. As a 3D animator, photographer and movie buff I found myself wondering in disbelief how on earth some of this footage was captured.

He's famous for the chase scene in ""The French Connection"", but to me he surpassed himself with the chase from ""To Live and Die in LA"".  At any rate, while there are no chases in Sorcerer, the same type of action crossed with suspense is present.  I don't know of a more gripping scene than two men in an old truck with a load of unstable dynamite,slowly,slowly inching across a rope and wood bridge as it falls apart.  That sounds - what's the phrase? - NOT exciting, but honestly it will have you holding your breath thru every tortured lurch and pause.  Above all, I guess, it is the story of men with nothing else to lose but their lives, but they *do* have their lives, so far...",1456617600,,805,4.369127516778524
66407,4,078322947X,"Depending on your perspective, Sorcerer is either a remake of the classic Henri-Georges Clouzot film Wages of Fear, or uses that film as a launching point for its own story.  William Friedkin argues the latter.  I was excited to see the film, both to see what an English-language update would look like and because many had reviewed Sorcerer as equal to or superior to Wages of Fear.  While I was disappointed and do not believe it a match for the original, it is still a good film.

To its credit, Sorcerer provides the outcasts' backstories, providing a context to each character that is only hinted at in the original.  Roy Scheider turns in a typically strong performance as the protagonist Scanlon, and he is well-suited to his role.  The production values are high, and Friedkin spared no expense to achieve the sense of grinding tension and foreboding that permeates this film.

Unfortunately, this is one of the areas where the film falls short.  In Wages of Fear the continuous fear of instant death throughout the film was a new cinematic experience.  Friedkin's version carried some punch, but not as much as the original -- and anyone who had seen the original couldn't avoid seeing it as recycled.  For someone seeing the film for the first time without the frame of reference of the original, I believe it would be an enjoyable suspense film.

Where Friedkin most sought to distinguish Sorcerer from Wages of Fear, however, is in his introduction of the supernatural.  Fresh from his success with The Exorcist, he was continuing on the theme of the demonic with other films such as The Devil's Triangle.  ""Sorcerer"" is the name of the truck Scanlon drives, and the headlights and grille make it look like a monster.  The hallucination sequence (not found in Wages of Fear) reveal a spiritual darkness not shown in the original.  In this, I believe Friedkin misses the mark and for me, it reduced the film.

Wages of Fear's end was needlessly nihilistic -- while it was the European fashion of the day, I found the closing sequence pointless and unsatisfying.  In this, Sorcerer was better -- it leaves the moviegoer with no less a sense of futility, but with more reason.",1455926400,,2185,4.784

THE STORY: Four shady criminals from various countries are on the run from trouble. Each eventually ends up in the desolate backwards village of Vera Cruz, deep in the South American jungle. Arriving there illegally, none of the strangers possess proper documentation with which to leave once the heat is off. They are trapped, and the only work in the village is at a nearby oil drilling site. When saboteurs blow the rig up the oil company must quickly put it out & recap the well, to maintain its profitability. The explosives needed to blow out the raging fire are stored at the company headquarters - some 200 miles away. Complicating matters further, the TNT has become dangerously unstable due to improper storage conditions, so it cannot be flown to the site but must instead be delivered overland by truck. Knowing the danger, the company agrees to pay $10,000 each for drivers willing to tackle the high risk job. Desperate to earn the much-needed money with which to buy their way to freedom, all four criminals volunteer. Though in essence a suicide mission, each man has no choice if he hopes to leave the village and get on with his life. Who will make it?

THOUGHTS: Released a week after the first STAR WARS, and sadly lost in the shuffle, SORCERER is a terrific film. Maybe director William Friedkin's very best. Yes, it is a thinly-veiled re-working of the classic French thriller THE WAGES OF FEAR but don't let that deter you. In many ways Friedkin's adaption is superior. JAWS alumni Roy Scheider is terrific here as a seedy driver for a mob hit gone terribly wrong and the other actors are equally adept in their roles. SORCERER is beautifully photographed and tightly edited for maximum tension. Completely done practically and on actual locations, (being shot back before the advent of CGI and wirework), the action set pieces are among THE MOST intense & nerve-wracking I have EVER seen on film. Period. The rope bridge scene? Two words: Holy crap. I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout the entire sequence, my heart thumping and my hands clutching the arms of my chair in a death grip. If this scene doesn't make you break out in a cold sweat and get your pulse pounding then you might want to check with your doctor because you're probably dead. This sequence alone makes the purchase of SORCERER completely justified. I feel the first half of the film could have been tightened up some, as it spends the first 45 minutes or so setting everything up, but taking it for what it is it's worth the wait because the last half will have you gasping in disbelief, jumping in your seat and chewing your nails right down to the first knuckle. Simply great stuff. I only regret that I hadn't discovered SORCERER before now, but what a fantastic find.

THE BLU-RAY: In a word... magnificent. The remaster for SORCERER is an audio & visual triumph. This is THE version to own. While sadly lacking in extras, the hi-def film transfer looks so impressive that I am more than willing to overlook the bonus shortcomings. The Blu comes packaged in a sort of mini book binding that sports a brief excerpt from William Friedkin's autobiography, detailing his work on the film and his feelings about its new lease on life with this Blu-ray. I've never been much of a fan of the director himself because he's always come across like a snobby, pompous, egotistical ass. Surprisingly, he acknowledges this fault and describes how it lead to his eventual downfall in Hollywood. But I cannot deny that he's made a few really good films during his career.",1454112000,2,3795,4.712349397590361

That's the option several desperate men find themselves in having fled to a hell hole oil drilling camp in a sweltering jungle filled with poverty, corruption, and lethal dangers - of both the man made and natural varieties.

Friedkin's best film, I think. Unfortunately overshadowed in 1977 by opening at the same time as ""Star Wars."" Amazing scenes filled with suspense and physical danger filmed on location and in conditions perhaps only a little less miserable for the cast and crew than for the characters portrayed on-screen. 70's pacing, so don't expect much to happen during the first hour. There's action there too, but it's all about describing who the major characters are and how they got stuck in the middle of hell. But after that, it's a white knuckle ride to the end of the film.

Also, ""Sorcerer"" is just the name of one of the trucks they drive in the movie. There's nothing mystical about the plot - it's just a story of desperate men in a desperate situation. If you like ""Papillon,"" then you'd probably also like this film.",1436054400,,1104,4.715025906735751

66549,5,078322947X,"Le Salaire De La Peur (The Wages of Fear) , based on the 1950 novel by Georges Arnaud,  was a 1953 French/Italian thriller, directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot.  The story tells about four desperate men, hiding out in a cesspool of a town in South America,  who are hired to drive 2 rickety trucks, loaded with nitroglycerin, over some hazardous terrain and deliver the explosives to a remote location to put out an oil well fire. The movie delivered on both character development and suspense, and was successful enough to allow the director to go on to do more movies.
24 years later, in 1977,  director William Friedkin came out with his own version, SORCERER. ( the title refers to a name painted on one of the trucks.) Although initially panned by critics at its release, the film has since been critically  re-evaluated and considered an overlooked masterpiece. I agree, wholeheartedly.  With superb cinematography, editing and a dynamic score by Tangerine Dream. I was so glad to finally see this film released in its proper ratio.

66608,5,078322947X,"Based on the French film of the 1950's, The Wages Of Fear, Director Friedkin takes this tale to a higher level with engaging back stories of the four men who wind up driving two nitro-filled trucks to put out an oil well fire in South America. Everything about this exceeds the original. You can see, feel, and taste the degradation of the poor village they've all been exiled to for one reason or another. You can sense the palpable desperation each man fills to get away. But to where and to what? The deeds that brought them here seem to seal their fate. Given a chance to get away, even a probable suicide mission is worthwhile.

Well directed, well acted, and intense, Sorcerer should be listed among Friedkin's best.  And his best were the likes of The French Connection and The Exorcist. A flop when it came out, Sorcerer is now more highly regarded as the classic it is. Go for a ride. But hang on for dear life.",1429660800,,920,4.437869822485207

I mean you'll become genuinely uncomfortable at every single bump on those roads and so called ""bridges"" a goat couldn't get across. I suppose I should mention we'll be traveling 218 miles through a Central American jungle on two crappy old trucks hauling ancient and highly unstable Dynamite. If you've watched enough movies, you'll know that old Dynamite sweats pure Nitroglycerin, so have fun with that. There's an oil well on fire and the owner's offering a lot of money to entice volunteers suicidal enough or desperate enough to deliver the TNT in time to save the well. The only roads up there were meant for donkeys and the aforementioned goats, definitely not for trucks. As for finding the right men to drive them, well it'll take someone with nothing to lose. ROY SCHEIDER leads the list in one of his BEST ROLES, worthy of an Oscar. He robbed a bank back in the USA where all the cash belong to the MAFIA and then wrecked the getaway car, so you understand why he's doing odd jobs in a jungle where a monkey would get lost. The other three men are similarly inclined to risk their lives as they face certain imprisonment for their own crimes if ever caught. The whole cast is outstanding, the cinematography is beautiful and the suspense is extraordinary. Director WILLIAM FRIEDKIN never lets you catch your breath. I think SPIELBERG got some of his motivation for RAIDERS from this movie, particularly the production design.

For all the sensory excesses of this long neglected marvel of cinema, I was left with a sense of perfect economy, of simplicity even. Contrast this with the current vogue for less-as-more taken to plodding extremes. More CAN indeed be less, leaving one with the feeling of a vibrant and fecund void.

SORCERER: Once the proper adjectives are in placeharrowing, grim, suspensefultheres really little more to say. The film knows this: Theres very little dialog, and very little needed. What does stand out in this story of a desperate attempt by desperate men is the nightmarish imagery: A truck with a grill like a grinning skull or death mask mocking them, for instance. The creepy, driving, electronic score by Tangerine Dream also adds an electric charge to the thick atmosphere of menace.

Scheider is excellent (as always) as the half-hardened small-time hood who understands the value of life far better than any of his companions on this wild ridewhich makes the final irony of the film all the more pointed. If possible, watch this as the second half of a double feature with the original, The Wages of Fear.

66659,4,078322947X,"More than anything this was a fascinating watch, coupled with reading the IMDB trivia afterwards as well as the letter from William Friedkin that came with the Warner digibook.

Definitely a bit of a time capsule action/suspense movie, much more drawn out and methodical than anything you'd see today. One to struggle with exposition that doesn't slap me in the face with explicit clarity I found the first act a slog, even if theatrically beautiful.

In keeping with the '70s fascination with the anti-hero, not one character in Sorcerer is remotely likable, which works for the gritty, existential, survivalist tone of the film. The Tangerine Dream score was so far ahead of its time; I thought it was an early '80s film rather than one made in 1976. It might have seemed jarringly misplaced for the film's visuals and geographic setting but hey, it's Tangerine flipping Dream.

Warner's restoration of the print and the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, the latter mainly evident in the numerous explosions and storm-drenched bridge crossing scenes.

66716,4,078322947X,"Ive had the soundtrack of Sorcerer by Tangerine Dream for decades, but for whatever reason had never seen the movie itself. Imagine my surprise when I was browsing the DVD section of my local library the other day, and there it was! I couldn't resist the urge and picked it up right away.

Sorcerer (originally released in 1977; 121 min.) brings the story of 4 men brought together in Central America through different fates. As the movie opens we see 4 separate short scenes from Vera Cruz, Jerusalem, Paris and New Jersey, where we see what our 4 main protagonists did that made them flee and end up in Central American. They eventually accept a dangerous job (against high pay) to transport sensitive explosives to a location 200 miles away over perilous terrain in a couple of trucks. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: imagine you are director William Friedkin, and you make the hit movie The French Connection, and then the mega-blockbuster The Exorcist, so what do you do for an encore? You make this, an adventure-thriller about moving explosives over rough terrain in a couple of trucks (one of which named Sorcerer, hence the movies title). The 15 min. key sequence (when the trucks must pass over an old wooden suspension bridge that appears completely unstable) will have you on the edge of your set. I couldn't help but think back of Werner Herzogs Fitzcarraldo some 5 years later, which has similar themes and moods. Now almost 40 years later, we know that the movies production was plagued with difficulties, making the end result all the more impressive. It is so strange that upon its release, this movie completely tanked. Now it is viewed as a cult classic, a lost masterpiece from among the 1970s American auteur-directors (Friedkin, Coppola, etc.). The movie now also plays like a time piece of what life was like in the remote villages of Central America (it wasn't a pretty picture). In the DVD liner notes, Friedkin sings the praises of Tangerine Dreams soundtrack, saying that had he known of them earlier, he wouldve asked them to score The Exorcist (what? then no Mike Oldfield score?). I mention this as I was quite surprised, when all was said and done, how little of Tangerine Dreams score we actually hear in the movie.

Bottom line: I have no idea why I waited so long to see this movie. It must certainly qualifies as a cult classic, and Id love to get the opportunity to see it once on the big screen, in perfect visual and audio circumstances Sorcerer is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1415664000,,2607,4.725274725274725

66737,5,078322947X,"In 1956 when legendary film director William Friedkin saw the classic 1953 Henri-Georges Clouzot French movie
""Wages of Fear"" about four reckless men hauling nitroglycerine in two trucks over crater-filled dirt roads to put
out an oil-well fire, it stuck with him. In 1976, he decided to update the story to the present era (then 70's) with
different characters but same premise. Freidkin acquired the rights from the author of the original story, Georges
Arnaud, since Clouzot didn't own them and so began his first picture for Universal Studios who gave a green light.
I remember when I FIRST saw William Friedkin's extraordinary 1976 action film ""Sorcerer"" after it was released in
theaters in its brief run before it was pulled due in large part to its inability to compete with the blockbuster ""Star
Wars"" released a month earlier and obliterating the market. I saw it at an evening showing with about five other
people in the theater that night. It was Friedkin's first movie since his own landmark blockbuster fright fest ""The
Exorcist"" four years earlier. Many people had the misconception that the title ""Sorcerer"" meant this picture was
going to be another horror shocker from Freidkin. It couldn't have been farther from the truth and word-of-mouth
along with undeserved bad reviews (and the previously mentioned ""Star Wars"") pretty much killed it. But when I
left the theater that night, I found it brilliant, refreshing, and STUNNING. I loved it. At long last, this magnificent
film is now being properly presented in a glorious HD widescreen blu-ray with remastered sound the way it should
be. Over the years, I've owned the VHS, laserdisc, and washed-out god-awful standard full-frame dvd of ""Sorcerer""
that were all simply adequate, but really didn't capture the jungle beauty and marvelous soundtrack Friedkin used
by the techno band Tangerine Dream and incredible pipe organ work from jazz legend Keith Jarrett (from his 1976
ECM album ""Hymns/Spheres""). Friedkin knows a thing or two about using unusual music for the scores in his films
and ""Sorcerer"" is no exception. According to him, the title ""Sorcerer"" originated from the classic Miles Davis album
of the same name, but he did intend it (regretfully) as a reference to ""The Exorcist"". The original title was going to
be ""Ballbreaker"", which didn't go over too well with studio executives. Along with Tangerine Dream & Keith Jarrett,
Miles' tune ""So What"" can be heard as well as Charlie Parker with strings. To watch this movie, one wouldn't have
a clue as to the chaos, turmoil, dissension, frustration, and difficulties in its making. With ""Sorcerer"", it's legendary.
So many workers were fired by Friedkin during filming that star Roy Scheider joked, ""I was the only guy he couldn't
fire, because I was the leading man. I said to Billy, 'You gotta stop firing these people, 'cause I'm getting tired of
going to the airport and saying goodbye to them.'"" Scheider was already somewhat bitter with Friedkin, as he had
been turned down for the major role of Father Karras in ""The Exorcist"" after co-starring in ""The French Connection""
with Gene Hackman. Cost overruns & delays blew the original $2.5 million budget up to a staggering $22.5 million.
Friedkin called ""The Bridge"" sequence in the movie, which took months to film, the most difficult thing he had ever
attempted. It lasts only 12 minutes in the picture, and it's considered the key, pivotal showcase in the story. At a
cost of over $3 million ALONE (most not budgeted), it has to be seen to be believed. Even now, it's still one of the
most astounding things I've ever seen in a film. Friedkin was totally hell-bent on getting this done his way, and he
pulled it off. In the introductory note that comes with the blu-ray book, Friedkin writes, ""Despite all the problems
and setbacks, the cost overruns, bruised egos, and shattered friendships, I felt then and still do that ""Sorcerer"" is
the best film I've made."" Quite a statement from the man who brought us ""The French Connection"" & ""The Exorcist"".
Like alot of his pictures, ""Sorcerer"" is in-your-face, relentless, brutal, and uncompromising without a happy ending.
He remains one of my favorite directors, living or dead. Kudos to Warner Bros. and those responsible for the great
restoration & presentation of this new blu-ray of ""Sorcerer"", which is housed in a marvelous book containing photo
stills, a letter from Mr. Friedkin, and notes adapted from his fascinating memoir, ""The Friedkin Connection"", which
is highly recommended, as well. It looks and sounds better than ever. Welcome back.",1412467200,5,4586,5.011795543905635

Big disappointment: the colors are rendered extremely artificial, with washed-out blues and tress that look like they have been painted a lurid green.

 The story behind the cinematography explains how so much time and effort was wasted on a few small scenes, and it shows: great set pieces cobbled together with almost ""found footage"" makes for a very uneven scrapbook of a film.

As a Tangerine Dream fan, I was hoping to hear more of that music in the movie, but except for brief excerpts, you get very little.

The Blu-Ray version is all that it is cracked up to be in terms of widescreen picture quality and sound, in fact it is probably better than when I saw it in a theatre when originally released.  My only gripe is that I wish there were extra features to go along with this new release, but the booklet will have to do.

The story line parallels ""Wages of Fear"", but creates its own backstory which results in a more fullfilling overall film.  The photography is stunning and gritty.  The title is taken from the name of one of the sinister looking beast of a truck used for the harrowing journey through the jungle and mountains.  There are no ""special effects,"" which adds even more excitement and realism to the trek.

66746,4,078322947X,"I love both film versions of this story. Friedkin's take falls in line with his ""French Connection"" grittiness and an almost horrific setting. I think what might have hindered this film on it's initial release was the public were expecting a horror film from Friedkin after his classic ""The Exorcist"" and might have been let down finding it to be a suspenseful action film. The title fooled 'em. Nevertheless, ""Sorcerer"" deserves a rightful place in Friedkin's filmography and is one of Roy Scheider's best films. The film is worth watching alone for ""the bridge"" sequence which holds up against any new film's CGI or action.

This film also boasts one of the greatest soundtracks of the seventies by Tangerine Dream and easily one of their best works. I rank it next to Goblin's ""Suspiria"" soundtrack as an essential addition to a filmusic library.",1410134400,,849,4.937062937062937
66767,4,078322947X,"Stephen King cited William Friedkin's ""Sorcerer"" as his favorite bad movie in his non-fiction dissertation on horror, ""Danse Macabre"", and, although I do agree this movie isn't an outright classic, I don't think the film is quite as bad as King makes it sound. Yes, there's a lot of scenes with guys grimacing as they wrench gears, tighten bolts, and swear grouchily under their breath, yet, for all it's faults, Friedkin successfully imbues his film with a sense of impending dread and hopelessness that makes the film into a sort of divine tragedy.

Most of the film is handled well on the production side of things, but there are some obvious editing gaffs that take away from the story. The soundtrack by Tangerine dream and the dirty, aggressive camera work are the film's main assets; the scenes where the trucks careen through the thick jungle are perfectly orchestrated to ratchet up the tension. A few key scenes could've used some extra exposition, such as the scenes where the characters take their driving test or when they have move a fallen tree using explosives. These scenes are well explained in the Novelization, so I was hoping to see the same in the movie.

Despite many mistakes, Friedkin got a lot right with this bust of a movie, and it's worth a watch if you like your movies gritty, depressing and tense.",1410134400,,1329,4.773913043478261

I was blown away by the intensity of the movie which was propelled by the soundtrack. It was the first time I could recall a soundtrack having such a prominent impact on a movie. Of course, like some of my favorite CD's, this movie was panned by critics and for someone to list this as an all time favorite is an indication of diminished mental abilities.

Roy Scheider delivers another great performance as a two-bit crook seeking asylum from the mob after a botched robbery, and escapes to a Latin American country where he meets up with several unfortunate souls, none of which are without fault.  They band together seeking their own salvation only by the means of volunteering on a dangerous, near suicidal mission to transport two truckloads of nitroglycerin across the jungle.

Suspense remakes are hard to pull, millions have seen Psycho and The Wages of Fear is a well known classic, and since the whole genre is built on not knowing what's going to happen next, it takes a special talent to make it work when the original is so celebrated and famous.

Luckily, Sorcerer was directed by an incredibly driven director hell bent on achieving his vision, and the results are finally available on Blu Ray after decades of obscurity. This is one of those movies that aged amazingly well after being ignored upon their original release.

Fortunately, also like Heaven's Gate, it has finally been given a proper release with a fantastic Blu-Ray transfer.

I realize the studios are trying to get all of us to upgrade our libraries, but that ship has sailed:  streaming is clearly the future of home video, except for those of us for whom the digital artifacts of streaming remain bothersome.  You'd think Warner would want to sell to the large audience who have standardized on DVD a pristine 16:9 encode of the film, but weirdly they seem to think it's smarter to pass on the opportunity for a sale... unless the customer wants to transition to Blu-ray.

It was hard to find a clean print of this film; however, this blu ray is one of the best digital restorations I have seen. Director William Fredkin worked hard on trying to bring this film to blu ray, and the effort shows. The quality of this blu ray to the quality of trailers of the film that can be found on the internet is day and night.

The blu ray packaging itself is also nice and simple. The packaging looks like a small book, including a short excerpt for from his autobiography, The Fredkin Connection, which chronicles some of the struggles this film had.

Packaging and quality aside, the film is amazing. It is a product of a bygone era. This is a hardcore 70's film with amoral characters in dangerous situations. Fredkin has called this his magnum opus, and I cannot disagree. If I had to choose to watch this or another of Fredkin's great work, The French Connection, I would pick this every time.

My only problem with the blu ray is the lack of special features; there are none. Granted, this is a small price to pay for the high picture and sound quality of the film, but some special features would have made this a home run for me.

If you check out such examples of his work as this disc and the Blu Ray of ""Ben-Hur"", I suspect that you will join me in the belief that this ""critic"" couldn't be more mistaken.  As one who worked with film for many years and became all too familiar with the many ways that the images become degraded with use and the passage of time, I can't get over the magic that the great restoration technicians are achieving in cleaning up and, in countless ways, bringing back the rich, brilliant look of first-run prints.  Too bad William Wyler couldn't have lived to witness the miracle of his fifty-plus-year-old movie looking brand-new again.

I'm quite a big Tangerine Dream fan, so when Sorcerer finally came out on BluRay I decided to check it out....... and I really rather enjoyed it! I was a bit baffled as to what was going on at first, but the atmosphere of the piece is huge and tangible, and the story coalesces from a mish mash of disconnected incidents into an amazingly tense and focussed action thriller. The twist at the end is very apt and believable too.
This is a film that totally transports you somewhere, incredibly atmospheric and cinematic in scope. It looks sumptuous and the effects are hugely more dramatic for all having been done ""in camera"" rather than the computer gloop we get on screen these days.

But the few tense set pieces of action that do happen are a sight to behold considering that it's obviously real people in very dangerous situations.

66914,5,078322947X,"Before viewing ""Sorcerer"" I took it upon myself to see the highly acclaimed 1953 French-Italian thriller film directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot entitled ""The Wages Of Fear"". I was completely blown away by the film, the story, characters, and above all the suspense contributed to a absolutely mesmerizing film.

Being familiar myself with director William Friedkin's work, and also the wonderful acting talent of Roy Scheider I knew this was one film I must not miss.

Of course seeing how masterful the original Clouzot film is, I had my doubts as to if this film could really surpass or improve upon the original material. But I must say this film does not disappoint!!!

Friedkin has a real talent of making you feel as if you are actually experiencing what happens in the film, his ""documentary"" like  style thrusts you into the perils and hardships the 4 main characters are suffering through. Visually striking scenes one after another leave you breathless and exhausted.... yet still wanting more.

To decide between ""The Wages Of Fear"" and ""Sorcerer"" would be a very difficult decision to make.

I really enjoy both films, but each for different reasons, I feel ""The Wages Of Fear"" has more character development, but it still falls into old Hollywood cliches at times.

As for ""Sorcerer"" I only have minor dislikes which I really won't go into deeply.

All you need to know is that ""Sorcerer"" is a truly wonderful film, a forgotten classic that everyone should see!!!

The Blu-ray looks fantastic and the DigiBook has great insights to the production of the film.

Well, I saw it way back then and thought it was terrific.  I've eagerly awaited the long-delayed Blu-ray release.  I like it just as much now.  In fact, even though it's sacrilege to say it, I like it more than Wages of Fear.

The cast is solid, the writing is good, and the cinematography is superb.  The scene where the explosive-laden truck perilously crosses the rickety bridge is reason enough to see the film.  But there's much, much more.  In short, this is a timeless adventure story.

66945,4,078322947X,"I was doubly skeptical about this movie before watching it. I absolutely hated the original Wages of Fear. I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Criterion-DVD/dp/B000AQKUH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Criterion DVD</a>&nbsp;way back in 2000 after hearing many good things about it but the tension just wasn't there. I thought I was missing something. When I heard about Sorcerer (thanks to a brief parody in the Mr. Plow episode of the Simpsons) I looked it up and learned about its terrible release history and assumed it was a stinker. Now, all these years later, William Friedkin has fully restored his lost treasure and presents it to us once more without the threat of George Lucas stealing his audience.

It's a slow-burn movie that initially feels a lot like the Exorcist in that several plot threads in different parts of the world are established first before being tied together in the second act. Four desperate men stuck in a South American peasant village agree to drive trucks filled with volatile nitro-glycerine to an oil fire 218 miles away. It's a suicide mission fraught with danger and peril. Leader Jackie Scanlon/Juan Dominguez (played by the ever-vulnerable and haunted Roy Scheider) is a lowlife from Queens hiding from a mob boss, and his comrades are a French stock swindler, a Palestinian bomber, and a rodent-like assassin. Together they make for a quartet as nervous and unstable as the explosives they are transporting.

William Friedkin's jungle is full of lush darkness and menace. One bump in the dirt road could lead to disaster. The rivers rage, the wind and rain batters the windshields, and every other corner disintegrates beneath them. One standout scene involves the trucks slowly inching across a derelict rope bridge as the wooden boards splinter to pieces under the wheels.

It's better than Wages of Fear, but what is up with that title? No matter how much Friedkin argues that it was a good choice...it's not. Sorcerer is a title that kills this movie as it has virtually nothing to do with anything. So it's the name of one of the trucks, so what? That's like calling Speed ""2525"" or calling First Blood ""That Army Truck He Drives For A Bit"". The word Sorcerer has absolutely nothing to do with anything and if you look for a deeper reason you are not going to find it. Friedkin is wrong about this title. It's a stupid, stupid choice and no doubt one of the many reasons why this film was a box office bomb. They should have just called it Wages of Fear. Friedkin doesn't really consider it to be a remake, more of a loose reinterpretation, and it's not like American audiences would have even been aware back in those days at the French original was something of an obscure flick in 1977.

That's not to say that there isn't anything deeper to be found in the film, it's just that the title has nothing to do with it. Sorcerer is an existentialist nightmare that's about as close to Cronenberg as Friedkin will ever get. The huge close-ups of sweaty tormented faces, the slowly-building mental breakdowns, the hostile, creeping jungle surrounding and containing us - it's not the exotic adventure that Thomas Cook promise, it's a place you don't want to be.

Friedkin made Sorcerer at the height of his creative freedom and stands as a perfect example, and as a warning, of how good and of how expensive a talented director's vision can be. Is it indulgent? Sure. But it's also a labor of love, this wage of fear.

The Blu-ray presents the film in 1.78:1 1080p that looks excellent after being painstakingly restored over the course of a year. The sound is fully remixed DTS HD-MA 5.1 and it's also great.

66962,1,078322947X,"I was so excited that Sorcerer was finally going to receive the respect it has deserved for decades that I pre-ordered this DVD a month ago.  (I have been checking Amazon every couple of months for a decade waiting for this as, slowly, Friedkin's great films have been re-issued over the past ten years).  The movie is an undisputed masterpiece, IMO Friedkin's greatest film and one of the truly daring films of the Seventies.  And I am happy to see that the Blu-Ray is apparently a proper restoration.

This DVD, however, is a mutilated disgrace.  It is not letterboxed but is pan-and-scan so the viewer is missing enormous portions of the frame.  This is akin to a pan-and-scan of something like Titanic or Lawrence of Arabia.  I didn't even know that in this day and age studios still engaged in this practice.  It is my fault for not even checking the aspect ratio, but it is inconceivable and unthinkable that anyone would even contemplate modifying an epic like this to fit a TV screen.  The scratches begin to appear even before the opening titles are complete.  The image is shaky.  It looks quite frankly like someone withdrawing from alcohol pointed an 8mm camera at a circa-1980 TV screen and filmed it straight off of network television. JUMBO sized, inappropriately punctuated and stupidly fonted subtitles obliterate the images during the sequences that are filmed in a foreign language.  Lint, specks and hairs periodically dot the top of the frame.  So sad.

Warner Bros went to the trouble and expense of restoring and remastering this film--why couldn't they simply transfer it to DVD as well, or at least be honest enough not the release this DVD in concert with the big release of the Blu-Ray because it obviously was intended to suggest that this new DVD release was remastered as well?  It is worth noting the new cover art for the Blu-Ray is the same art as appears on the new DVD; this is intentionally misleading.  Warner Bros should bury its head in shame for this egregious con job.

If you want to see a truly mesmerizing work of art, DO SEE SORCERER--but please do yourself a favor and find some way other than this cynical farce of a DVD.",1398902400,45,2168,4.693121693121693
66963,5,078322947X,"It has been a long time since I have been so surprised by a film; I can remember hearing about it when I was a kid, but like so many others at the time, 'Star Wars' was my childhood obsession. That a being said, I also have to say that this movie is generally timeless; with the exception of the cars and the music sometimes(still an excellent score by Tangerine Dream...), there is nothing that falls to the side as 'dated'. The country the 4 men flee to is just miserable, and probably looks the same now as it did then...just behind the times in so many ways.

The set up of the 4 men starts things off with bang--literally. The scenarios are very different for each individual, but each equally satisfying. There is an excellent church robbery scenario that rounds things off with Roy Scheider, which includes a trademark Friedkin vehicle sequence(which--like many other scenes in this film--comes with a surprising jolt and a direction you didn't see coming...). Each backdrop story could pretty much provide for a film of it's own. Scheider is excellent, and this film reminds me why I was always a big fan of his. That being said, the other acting is all just right on the money as well; you can feel both their desperation and sweat, and sympathize with every stumbling block they encounter along the way. From the corrupt cops to the bandits they meet on the road(a favorite scene of mine in any movie...), you are thrown generally everything in the book as far as a crime/thriller movie go. And in this case it is all successful.  There were more than a dozen scenes that hold up to or outshine anything that has been put out in the last 10 years to me. It is a reminder of the skill behind this project across the board, and the booklet with the blu-ray is really enjoyable to read, especially after seeing the film, as it fills in some curious questions about how certain things were done, and the difficulties the production encountered.

The look of the film is breathtaking at times; all of the camera shots of the landscapes, kids, animals, elderly soda vendors, and crowded village streets are very candid and realistic. While the plot is somewhat simple, the intensity and driving force behind the 4 men is unforgettable; and while they are all different in their ideals, beliefs, and character, they all manage to somehow come together by fate to carry out the one thing that could save them from a life of poverty or consequence by law. And everyone meets some kind of fate you don't see coming.

I have always loved Friedkin's work, especially when he delves into the darker side of mankind; However, this is the 1st movie in quite some time that has jumped into my top 5 favorite movies. It again reminds me how people w/talent to burn make timeless work, period. I am so happy that Friedkin was able to get this released as he saw fit, and it truly is a gift to those who like him, the genre, the actors, and the feel of such a film...

There is humor and philosophy throughout the film here and there as well; the screenplay is top notch, and the dialog is fascinating; it is one of the films you watch where you are never reminded it's a film. You get wrapped up in it, and do a lot of replaying certain sequences over and over. While the 'bridge scene' is the most famously known sequence in the film, there are countless others that are certainly equal, although the bridge scene is a pure nail biter(not to mention technical feat, as further explained in the booklet...).

The use of sound is also pretty incredible, especially coupled with the visuals; from the sounds of several surprise explosions, to the sound of the knife blade being flipped out, this film uses sound as a performance of it's own; it supplies a huge/equal part of the overall canvass and to feeling like you are there in particular a situation, not to mention hearing things as they actually probably would be heard; the sound is never overdone for the situation, and always effective. The creaking wood and rushing water of the bridge scene is a great example. Also, while the dialog is considerably less than in most movies, it is always very well written, realistic, and just another positive strength; but even when there is no dialog, and just simply sound and the expressions on the characters faces, it more than serves the point trying to be made. The character hit-man Nilo has very few lines, yet his character and performance are equally strong as anyone's here. The small visual details work in the same way the sounds ones do, such as the soldier accepting a bribe by scraping the money to himself with a fly swatter, the bar tender wiping off Roy Schieder's silverwear on his own shirt before passing them to him, to the cop popping open a Coke bottle with the cocked barrel of his gun...all small examples of going that little extra bit to make something potentially average something more. And these types of moments and details are throughout the film. A favorite to me is in the church scene in the beginning of the film where the priest mentions to the happy couple something to the effect of 'not being obsessed with material things', and you can see the groom roll his eyes, all while his bride with the black eye stands next to him(they show a close-up of her when the priest say he hopes their marriage is filled with blessings, but she still didn't look too happy to be there...).

Mr. Friedkin wanted this to be his 'magnum opus', and I think he well succeeded. It really does still outshine so many films and the people involved that exist nowadays; Like Stanley Kubrick and John Huston, I can see the obsessive side Friedkin had to create something unforgettable no matter how much time or money it took; it is quite a risk, and sadly one that doesn't always pay off; but it is an effort that is well appreciated, and something not as many filmmakers take on nowadays.

As far as it being considered a remake, I would have to say this is no more a remake than something like Herzog's 'Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call, New Orleans' was of the original 'Bad Lieutenant' film; some of the story elements are similar, but a lot of those elements are taken to new and different places with all the people involved with the production; and while 'Sorcerer' gets it's story foundation from both a novel and a film, you can see them much more as an influence, and not the basis. It is more the taking of a loose idea and making it to all your own, not an imitation of it.

I have watched this 6 times since it came out, and it still seems to expose a new layer or understanding each time, not to mention the brilliance of so many scenes that capture the moment spot-on. This film is pure genius to me, and the surprise release on blu-ray has made my month.  It is a piece of work that warrants all the 5 star reviews it has gotten, and Mr. Friedkin should be more than proud of this piece of work.

I hope it reaches the full audience it deserves now, esp in the blu-ray format. I think it will.",1398816000,5,7012,4.509047993705743

66965,4,078322947X,"I watched this back-to-back with The Wages of Fear viewed first.  Both films have their strengths.  In terms of image quality and sound, Sorcerer clearly trumps TWoF in both categories.  The colors in Sorcerer are lustrous.  The sound enveloping.  But in terms of story line and character development, I found TWoF more satisfying.  Even though we don't know how the characters in TWoF wound up in their stolid surroundings, Clouzot invested more time in letting us get to know what made the men tick.  And how could anyone compare the endings?  The ultimate anti-Hollywood ending in the TWoF juxtaposed against the mysterious ""ending"" in Sorcerer clearly favored Clouzot's choice of how to add delicious, almost laughable, irony to an incredibly somber, riveting drama.  I felt a similar sensation at the end of Sorcerer that I experienced when The Sopranos concluded:  That's it?  Clouzot's decision to have Mario drive off a cliff after showing expert control of his truck during the arduous drive to the fire is a twist for the ages.  Sorcerer's ending lacked that intellectual punch to the gut Clouzot masterfully captured.

Both films are eminently satisfying.  Final tally:  Sorcerer for video and audio performance and that mind-numbing bridge crossing and TWoF for a more cleanly developed and concluded story from start to finish. And Vera Clouzot brought an infectiously adorable character to TWoF that did not exist in Sorcerer.  Bottom line:  Neither will disappoint; but I give the overall edge to TWoF.",1398643200,2,1517,5.151639344262295

66989,5,078322947X,"Director William Friedkin's 1977 thriller ""Sorcerer"" has become something of a cult classic despite a so-so performance in its initial theater run.  The plot follows four men, an American, an Arab, a Frenchmen, and a Mexican, all refugees from the law, who are trapped in a remote village somewhere in South America.  The dramatic blowout of an oil well may offer an opportunity for escape; the oil company is willing to pay big money to men who can drive an unstable cargo of nitroglycerin explosives 200 miles by truck on dangerous roads to the oil well site.

The movie opens with a series of vignettes that establish the situation and character of each of the four men.  The story moves to their precarious status in the small South American village and the decision to undertake the dangerous drive.  Their journey is accompanied by a sense of foreboding, as the men face a series of challenges, each more deadly than the last, including the iconic crossing of a swaying bridge.  The taut direction keeps the story tense while offering no guarantees of the fates of the men.

66990,5,078322947X,"I've counted Sorcerer among my absolute favorites for over 20 years, so I'm ecstatic at this release. Expect no objectivity here.  For years, I've seen small screenings of Sorcerer at revival houses and college auditoriums; been downright evangelical in my praise of it, making converts even with the dreadful pan-and-scan DVD version that's all that was available; and writing mad-dog fan letters and e-mails to everyone from Criterion to The New York Times to People Magazine. This new BR release, supervised by Friedkin, is gorgeous with terrific sound; the film never looked better.

Despite its miserable box-office when it debuted in 1977, it's an astonishing movie, all the more impressive when you consider what Friedkin and crew accomplished decades before CGI ""revolutionized"" the movie business. Yes, Sorcerer is based on Henri-Georges Clouzot's classic 1953 film The Wages of Fear (Friedkin's film is dedicated to Clouzot) and has the same premise--four desperate, ruthless men take on a suicide job driving trucks loaded with rotting, fragile cases of dynamite to extinguish a furious oil-well fire (mountains in Wages, jungle here)--but the film is a powerful, original, agonizingly suspenseful vision of its own.  The legendary bridge sequence alone is worth the price, but there are many more breathtaking scenes.  Over the years, I've met a number of people who have airily dismissed Sorcerer as ""just another remake.""  As is so often the case, most of them have either not seen it in years or have never seen it at all, or belong to the same club as those who arrogantly dismiss every film, play, novel, or song since 1956 as ""derivative"" of somebody. I could rhapsodize about it at greater length, but the best thing I can say is that Sorcerer really is the best movie you've never seen, a long-neglected masterpiece.  The cover blurb is taken from Newsweek's original review (one of the few good ones): ""The toughest, most relentless American film in a long time.""  As true today as it ever was.

The film restoration and it's Blu-ray transfer is absolutely stunning. Because most of the film takes place in a poor, backward South American country governed by a corrupt dictator, and the plot deals with still contemporary issues such as upper-level financial fraud, terrorism, revolution, and the exploitation of the poor and the environment by ""Big Oil"" and their own government, it doesn't seem dated one whit. I saw this in the theater when it was first released knowing about the general bad reviews, although there were some good ones as well. Maybe STAR WARS mania overshadowed it at the time, maybe the title did deceive some people who had no idea about the plot in advance, but all I know is when it was over it had instantly become one of my favorite movies. Another complaint was/is that's it's basically a remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-WAGES-OF-FEAR/dp/B001PYD0KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE WAGES OF FEAR</a>...so what? STAR WARS was basically a modern take on the old cliffhanger adventure serials. THE WAGES OF FEAR is a great film in it's own context, but it just can't match the cinematography, pacing and intensity of SORCERER. It still probably wouldn't be a ""blockbuster"" if it was released today, the movie-going public's idea of entertainment these days are either ""event"" extravagances full of computer graphics, or the same old cliches, ""all-star"" celebrity casts, simple plots, the obligatory sex or nudity scene, and lots of explosions...just like STAR WARS (although there is a terrific explosion in SORCERER). STAR WARS is OK, I've seen it twice, the original and the special edition, where I've watched SORCERER every year since I purchased it on LaserDisc.  Everyone that I've shown this movie to ""cold"" couldn't believe it's not well known. It's just like people's experience with gay people, once they actually KNOW a gay person, or if a friend or relative comes out, 99% of the time they change their attitude and find they are not godless degenerates but real people like them.

66994,4,078322947X,"It's hard to believe it's been nearly four decades since director William Friedkin's  commercially disappointing follow-up to his blockbuster hits THE FRENCH CONNECTION and THE EXORCIST.  It's equally hard to believe there's never been a properly formatted home theater release of this intense reboot of Henri-Georges Clouzot's undisputedly great, and magnificently titled, 1953 film THE WAGES OF FEAR based on the novel by George Arnaud.  (Friedkin's film is dedicated to Clouzot, who died shortly before the film was released.)

The desperate story about four outcasts, led by Roy Scheider, who must transport two trucks carrying six crates of decaying, volatile dynamite across 200 miles of treacherous mountain and jungle roads in order to stop a South American oil fire is probably more visceral and memorable in Clouzot's stark, black and white, original.  But the jungle action sequences, especially crossing a rope bridge over a flooding river during a storm, remain a standout, nail-biting set piece in Friedkin's film.  Even more so when we recognize it was created without the help of computer graphics!  The film also stars Francisco Rabal, Bruno Cremer, Ramon Bieri and Joe Spinell.  The once fresh sound of Tangerine Dream's terrific score seems at times a tad dated today, but is still highly effective.

The two-hour film takes more than half its time in setting up the drama and introducing us to the protagonists who are trapped by the whims of existential fate into a collective act of redemption and an opportunity to buy their way out of the hellish place in which they find themselves  But they must first survive and the odds of not getting blown up in the process are not on their side.

Much time is spent getting to know the four men who will soon be thrown together in a squalid SA oil company town.  Cremer, the most relatable of the four, is a French banker fleeing the collapse of his dirty business dealings; Amadou is a Palestinian terrorist, not a generic Muslim, running from the Mossad after a Jerusalem bombing; Scheider is the sole surviving New Jersey mobster hiding out after a church robbery in a powerful gangster's parish; and then there's Francisco Rabal's hit man whom we assume is in this Latin American hell-hole to knock off one of the other three.  But Rabal kills a fourth man, a German, in order to make himself a part of the truck driving team.  But it is this elaborate conceit that lessens the emotional impact of the drama it is supposed to enhance.

The long delay in getting this restored print to home video has been blamed on ""complicated licensing"" issues as well as finding the best source material.

On it's initial Hollywood release, the film followed a two-week run of STAR WARS at Grauman's Chinese Theater (as it was then called).  But after a week or so of poor attendance and weak reviews, STAR WARS was brought back for it's historic, mostly sold-out, tenure.

Most people who saw the posters and ads for Friedkin's film naturally assumed it was some kind of follow-up or sequel to the supernatural hit THE EXORCIST.  The poorly conceived and misunderstood title (it's one of the dilapidated truck's names) was probably the main reason the film failed to find traction with the movie-going public.  The often sparse audiences who sat through the film generally liked it and there grew a kind of cult following in spite of the cropped and bad looking VHS transfer.  So the new, vivid Blu-ray release is hugely anticipated and welcome.  Once again, the evocative production design by the brilliant John Box can be fully appreciated.

The restoration is sometimes ultra vivid and very controlled -- the sunlight in Jerusalem burns bright and the lush jungle greens quiver with a neon glow.  There's a strong grainy feel to the texture of the canvas that does not detract from the coarse, noir story of men fighting their dark destiny in a doomed, meaningless existential wasteland.  The last image of Scheider stumbling into a raging inferno carrying a box of unstable nitro is not the most upbeat of endings but is somehow satisfying in this fatalistic fable.

For interested technophiles, the surprisingly low bit rate for this long anticipated film averages 17.99.  But I saw no compression problems on a 60"" screen.  I was startled to find the disc to be bare bones.  It's devoid of the most basic extras including a Friedkin commentary.  (Perhaps a response to the harsh criticism of his initial THE EXORCIST commentary that is merely a description of the action on screen as if intended for the blind!)  To make up for this loss, the disc book case is a 40-page pamphlet that is sometimes revealing.  SORCERER is a visually rich and often thrilling adventure that deserves to be seen anew.  Fighting fate is a dangerous business.",1398297600,2,4800,4.900990099009901

I was made aware of the movie in 1985 at 16 years old when I was a usher at a neighborhood theater. A lot of film buffs there. ""Yeah but did you see the Sorcerer?"" they would say to me. At times I thought it was a bad joke on their part. But in reality very few people new about this film and even less had seen it. This was back when video stores only had one copy of a movie. You would have to wait for months sometimes. But the real kicker was that it wasn't on VHS. I a not sure that it ever was. My first viewing of it was on laser disc. Which I purchased at $45.00 dollars at the time in the early '90's. I was amazed! There was no doubt it was worth the money. I had built this movie up so much and was surprised that it was beyond my  expectations. It is William Friedkin best movie! It is nice to know that the few that new about this movie for years are letting the many know about it. It is finely just beginning to be recognized for what it should have been.

In a film where there is only about 40% dialogue, it keeps you glued from start to finish. There has never been a more thrilling action sequence than the trucks crossing the bridge from this film, especially because it is entirely CGI free and scary as crap.

I never saw Sorcerer during its initial theatrical release in 1977 but I saw it on HBO in 1978 and was blown away and been a big fan ever since.  In the mid-nineties I purchased the pan-and-scan VHS version after the price dropped down from its initial $99 new released price.  I never saw the DVD version even though my local library has it.  I even bought the 12"" vinyl soundtrack back in the 70's.  Some comments were made about the cover art for the Blu-ray.

Skin tones are perfect.  And the dirt and grime that lies on everything in this South American hell-hole place that we saw on our previous DVDs is now, truly, hell on earth, on our Blu-Rays.

I watched this on a 55"" Sony Bravia with no compression problems, even though I'm told this was restored at a low bit-rate, i.e. not BD50 (which makes no difference to me).

I think you will be very pleased with the extensive restoration reportedly done on this movie.  And the Blu-Ray was given Director William Friedkins own approval.

One final note on price.  I pre-ordered this 4 months ago on Amazon about the time it was first announced (along with the Big Red One).  For $19.59.  The Big Red One for $13 something.  Now the prices have gone up a few dollars.  I find that if you can pre-order some of these Blu's months before release, you can usually get them at a lower price.

It was a misunderstood and brilliant film by Friedkin , following the Exorcist and has been quite a cult object.  WHY only a 4 star rating?  Because WB hasn't included anything in the way of bonus features for an admitted cult classic that has been terribly misunderstood, reviled, and with time revealed to be a missed masterpiece.  Friedkin appears on seemingly any documentary about any film the studios ask him to participate in and has contributed large features to NARC and The Manchurian Candidate as well as commentary for Vertigo.... so where is he on this BR?  Oh, the new DVD is just a repeat of the full screen Universal edition (WOW WB are cheap and nasty aren't they?).  Back to this edition... we get a very high priced BR (nearly a 30 buck list) with NO commentary, NO Making of and just an excerpt from Friedkins brilliant autobiography as a bonus feature and I guess in exchange for that WB gave the publisher the back cover of the BR as a free AD because when you remove the paper what you have on the back of your BR case is just that a full page ad for the book!  Friedkin was just in town this week for the showing of this film at a local theater and Is making dates for signings of the BR at local venues.... he loves this film... and I can't figure out why WB missed this opportunity to ad value to the movie in their presentation , but they sure didn't mind adding price.  I'm sure they correctly figured all us fans would be suckers and not wait for them to discount these to Costco in a year like they have their other overpriced BR sets. 5 Stars for the film , and the transfer , but I have to deduct a star for the price point and lack of extras on a movie that screams for them!",1397865600,5,1895,4.259052924791086

WHY then did WB reissue the DVD full screen and basically just duplicate the crappy Universal edition that has been out forever?  I picked them both up, because I have a friend I've been telling about this magnificent movie  for decades and sadly he's an older fellow with no desire for a BR player... and I can't believe they just duped over the old Universal DVD without even changing the menus..... just lazy and greedy.... they obviously have the master as the BR is widescreen and stunning!  The reason I can't rate the BR higher than 4 stars is that it is a 5 star movie for me, but at nearly a $30 list price and NO extras? No making of, no Friedkin commentary?  Friedkin doesn't seem to be a hard guy to get to comment on .... ANYTHING... goodness he even has done commentaries on other peoples film like Vertigo and made special feature interviews for others movies like NARC, and Franhenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate... but WB couldn't get him to do anything for perhaps his most misunderstood classic and a film he loves?

This is just plain sad, people.  What we have here is one of the great films of the '70's, the last period of great film making in Hollywood.  The reasons why it vanished into obscurity are better described on Wikipedia and elsewhere; what it boils down to is that it came out at the same time as the original STAR WARS in 1977, and it's title was somewhat misleading to people expecting to see a supernatural follow-up to director William Friedkin's previous film, THE EXORCIST.  The title instead refers to the name given to the truck driven by actor Roy Scheider, a truck filled with unstable nitroglycerin that he has to drive over mountainous jungle terrain on unpaved roads.  Why?  Because the nitro is needed to put out a fire at an oil refinery in an unnamed South American country, and he has to deliver it safe and sound if he wants a legal visa to live in the country, because he can't go back home.  Neither can the other men in the other truck following the same route.  They are desperate men with nothing to lose, and willing to take on a suicidal job like this to save their lives.  If this sounds familiar to older film fans it's because SORCEROR is a remake of the classic French film THE WAGES OF FEAR.  And to my mind it's a better film.  If it takes a while to rev up, remember that films from the 70's are much less afraid to devote early screen time to character development.  But once it gets going - my GOD.... The first time I saw this my hands were sore 2 days later from clenching the seat cushions.

67094,5,078322947X,"Throughout the early seventies, William Friedkin was flying high in Hollywood, having won a Best Director Oscar for the huge hit, ""The French Connection"", and then making the terrifying and enormously successful ""The Exorcist"".  Then, to the surprise (and disgust) of many critics, Friedkin had the hubris to announce a remake of a classic French film, The Wages of Fear.  He had an enormous budget, the backing of two studios, and near complete creative control. Unfortunately, this film was an expensive flop when it was released in 1977. The fact that it came out the weekend before ""Star Wars"" was released was a large part of the reason why, perhaps. It was nearly universally (and somewhat gleefully) panned by critics, and quickly disappeared from theater screens. It was nearly forgotten about, except by a few fans (like me).

I saw this when it was released, and was absolutely riveted by it. The acting, direction, screenplay, editing, and sound were all incredible (with a stunning soundtrack by Tangerine Dream). The famous Bridge sequence is one of the most gut-wrenchingly suspenseful scenes you will ever see. The darkly existential ending is perfect. This will strike some as heresy, but not only is this film superior to the 1953 Clouzot  original, it is one of the best films of the 1970s. Sadly, the only DVD release has been in the dreaded pan and scan 4:3 aspect ratio, which makes the film unbearable to watch. This edition is fully authorized by the Director, and will no doubt be a spectacular transfer.

The journey out of limbo this film has taken over the last five or so years, with frustrating legal issues and a major lawsuit by Friedkin, are well documented in Wikipedia. Lately, the restored film has been showing at film events around the world to great acclaim. Critics are beginning to realize the importance of this film, which unfortunately nearly destroyed Friedkins career, but now is starting to be recognized as a key film of its decade. It has been reported that this is Friedkins personal favorite of his films.

67116,4,078322947X,"Upon its theatrical release many critics were pretty ticked off that William Friedkin (or any director for that matter) would dare attempt a remake of ""The Wages of Fear."" As result, they weren't very kind to it. Well....time has proven them wrong.

Here's the scoop. Four men from different countries have all committed grievous crimes including murder and terrorism. They all end  up in the same South American rat hole to avoid death and or arrest. When a local oil well is blown up by terrorists these four are recruited to move several cases of leaky dynamite over 120 miles of nasty terrain to blow out the well. The payoff, if they make it, will be enough to get them back to the real world.

""The Wages of Fear"" is an outstanding movie and about as intense as they come, But ""Sorcerer"" is of equal intensity and benefits from a great look. The two D.P.s capture an immediacy in the opening scenes that draw you into the action. And when things move to South America it makes you want to take a shower. Things are so hot, sweaty and grimy it sticks to your skin. Then, when they hit the road with the dynamite, things shift into white knuckle, nail biting mayhem. I saw this three times at the theater. The third time I took my folks. During a certain key scene my dad leaned over to me and asked: ""how could you sit through this again?"" It was that intense.

This didn't do really well at the box office partly due to the fact there was only one American actor (Roy Scheider) and three unknown foreign actors. They later imposed Scheider's face on the original poster to try and boost video sales. But Friedkin considered this one of his best films and most of those who saw it loved it. It has become a cult hit over the years and I hope someone steps up and gives it a video release worthy of its stature.

67121,4,078322947X,"Hot on the heels of his success with ""The Exorcist"" (1973), William Friedkin decided to do a remake of the 1953 French film ""The Wages of Fear"". The project took years of preparation and almost a year to film, mostly in the jungles of the Dominican Republic. The production was so hampered by problems that just getting it shot was a huge accomplishment.

Unfortunately ""Sorcerer"" was released one month after ""Star Wars"" in 1977 and it couldn't compete with the mass hysteria of that film, which signified the debut of blockbuster-oriented cinema and the demise of the New Hollywood movement that more or less started with ""Bonnie and Clyde"" in 1967.

Aside from the competition of ""Star Wars"", there were two other factors that prevented ""Sorcerer"" from appealing to movie-goers at large: The first fifteen minutes featured foreign languages with English subtitles and North Americans were turned-off by what they thought was a foreign film. Secondly, the title was misleading. This was the next film by the maker of the popular ""The Exorcist"" and it was called ""Sorcerer"", but there's nothing conventionally supernatural about the film at all; it's a gritty adventure-suspense flick, not horror. (We'll look at why the film's called ""Sorcerer"" below).

THE PLOT: Four men from around the world -- a Latin assassin, an Arab terrorist, a French extortionist and a New Jersey gangster -- are exiled in a poverty-stricken remote village in South American who's economy is reliant on an American oil company. After an explosion at the oil well, the company enlists the four outcasts to transfer nitroglycerin to the well in order to put out the fire. It's a suicide mission because the nitro is unstable, the jungle terrain is rough and it's a 218 mile journey, but they're so desperate for the the high wages (of fear) they have no choice but to take it.

""Apocalypse Now"" was being shot when ""Sorcerer"" was released in '77 so it obviously didn't rip ""Sorcerer"" off, but there are similarities: Both films had long, expensive and troubled shoots deep in the jungle and their plots deal with long jungle journeys, the former takes place on a boat up a river and the latter on two trucks over wild frontier ""roads"". Also, coming from the same era and the same cinematic movement -- the aforementioned New Hollywood -- they have the same gritty, surreal feel.

""Apocalypse Now"" is the superior film only because it focused on character development and was more epic in nature. The main problem with ""Sorcerer"" is that the first act establishes the four main characters as criminal dirtbags and so it's hard to care about them later on. The fact that you do start to root for the gangster, the extortionist and the Arab is testimony to the film's quality. These are desperate men forced into a extremely hazardous situation.

The best part of the movie, of course, is the second half, which focuses on the long journey. It's rough & wild and hampered by one serious obstacle after another. How they got those two piece-of-junk trucks across that hanging rope/wood bridge I'll never know.

The surreal score by Tangerine Dream is very effective in establishing the film's desperate ambiance.

There's a funny scene in the second act where Roy Scheider's character gazes at a billboard in a saloon. It features a hot babe on the beach with a bottle of Coke, but that's the closest he's gonna get to either in that Latin s***hole.

About the name of the movie, ""Sorcerer"" is actually the name of one of the two trucks, which is painted on the hood in French. But this only reflects the surface meaning. I used to interpret the deeper meaning as a reference to the miracle (or magic) that the men figuratively concoct in delivering the dynamite on a suicide mission. This interpretation is legitimate, but Friedkin said he actually named it ""Sorcerer"" in reference to the evil wizard of fate, which people supposedly have no control over. The grotesque idol-like face we see at the opening of the film and later along the jungle road presumably represents this sorcerer of fate.

My wife objected to one aspect of the ending, but it ties into the whole ""evil wizard of fate"" theme, as well as the biblical ""your sin shall find you out"", ""you reap what you sow"" and ""he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword"".

We all know the four men are allegorically in hell, is it possible that they're in literal hell or purgatory, at least Roy Scheider's character? After the car wreck some strange man appears and tells him, ""They're gone."" As he stumbles away from the wreckage it's odd that the police don't see him. Did he die in the car wreck? Is he a ghost at this point?

After his hellish experiences delivering the nitro he thinks he's free, but it's clear that his past has caught up with him. This could be an endless tormenting cycle (hell) or perhaps purgatorial in nature.

Friedkin may insist that ""Sorcerer"" is a straight adventure thriller, but the supernatural undertones -- including the title -- point to a metaphysical interpretation. It may have been a subconscious thing.

The film runs 121 minutes.

67142,5,078322947X,"Why this incredible film gets lumped in with HEAVEN'S GATE, 1941 and other films that are held up as examples of all the ""excesses"" of Seventies filmmaking gone wrong is beyond me. Certainly director William Friedkin was plagued by problems in making SORCERER right from the start, compounded by the bad luck of having it open in theaters the same week in 1977 that some movie called STAR WARS opened. More than that, though, I think Friedkin was pilloried by critics and cineastes for having (by their lights) the unmitigated chutzpah to remake Henri-Georges Clouzot's THE WAGES OF FEAR, often considered to be a classic of French cinema. My goodness, it's like remaking CITIZEN KANE. The horror, the horror!

Classics are as classics are. I've watched SORCERER at least 5 times over the course of the last 35 years, and find that, if anything, it only gets better each time, while I've managed THE WAGES OF FEAR a couple of times and own that Clouzot might have had a classic if the dialogue in that movie wasn't so hackneyed and the desolated South American setting where this is all supposed to take place didn't look like a movie back-lot. By contrast, SORCERER rubs the grime and the tension into the viewers face, makes you wonder if these four hapless low-lifes really are going to come out okay, plays with one's expectations and, more to the point, doesn't make ANY of this even remotely attractive while at the same time drawing you in, or at least it's never failed to draw me in.

The best news, of course, is that FINALLY there's a great HD transfer of this video available to viewers, both as a Blu-Ray disc and as a first-rate digital download. It only adds to the power that this film already has, and makes this timeless epic even more of an evergreen.

Thing is, there's room for both THE WAGES OF FEAR and SORCERER in ones personal movie library. Hopefully someday there will be recognition that the latter is as classic as the former...for me personally, it's even more so.",1371168000,,1994,4.6752136752136755

67144,4,078322947X,"One of Bill Friedkins lesser remember gems. While not s memorable as many of his other films like The Exorcist, The French Connection or To live in Die In LA, its till a tense and memorable thriller. A remake of another film on the same subject, Roy Schieder leads a cast of unknowns in this story about 4 criminals, all in hiding in south america to avoid extradition back to thier countries of origin for the crimes they commited. One is a terrorist. One is a small time crook hiding from the mob. One s a german assassin, and the last is on the lam for misapropriated funds from his successful business in France. These four men are hired to transport extremely explosive nitro glycerin across rough terrain, old bridges and rocky mountains, determined to deliver it for use 200 miles away. The film is filled with some nail biting edge of your seat moments, and it has a raw authentic feel much like the classic realism of Friedkins French connection.

The story setting is Nicaragua (two men refer to Managua), but the jungle filming was in the Dominican Republic.  The whole sense of the film appeals to danger, violence, and the male persona.  The musical score by Tangerine Dream grabs hold and will not let go.  William Friedkin did a wonderful job of building tension in showing the background of each man on the run. Three of the four protagonists sought easy illegal gains in deals that went wrong; the fourth is a terrorist.  They come from New Jersey, Paris, the Caribbean, and Israel.  Their paths cross after escaping to this poverty-stricken 3rd world backwater.  Now they lunge at the chance to make $10,000 fast; but they are doubling down and betting with their lives.  This is the devil's bargain and there is hell to pay. The first bad deal put them in purgatory in the jungle, now they risk total obliteration. The name Sorcerer seems appropriate to the foreboding difficulty of transporting nitroglycerin across 200 miles of jungle.

67183,5,078322947X,"I have never seen a movie quite like Sorcerer, William Friedkin's fantastic story of four men challenged to deliver two truckloads of dynamite to a remote site in an unidentified South American country.  The dynamite is old, leaking, and volatile.  Any hard shaking will set it off.  Each box of the explosive is set in sand in the bed of each truck to keep it safe.  Unfortunately for the drivers of the trucks, the road to their destination is perilous.  Rocky roads, broken down bridges, impassable forests, are a few of the obstacles they must navigate, complicated by torrential rains that would make normal driving hazardous.

Each of the truck drivers is running away from something that has gone bad in his native country.  I'll focus only on Roy Scheider, an Irish American gangster who has made the mistake of robbing the mafia in New York City.  The mafia don swears vengeance against the Irishman, which results in Roy's escape to South America.  A payment of $10,000. is enough incentive for Roy to attempt to deliver the dynamite to its destination.

Scheider is an excellent actor, perhaps best known for his work in The French Connection and Jaws.  He is equally good in Sorcerer.  I marveled at the physical challenges of his role in this film.  Friedkin shows us every dangerous encounter the men faced on route to their destination, some of the most exciting scenes I have ever seen in the movies, and without help from computers!

Any readers of this review will have to see for themselves what happens to the four men and their dangerous cargo.  Director Friedkin, of Exorcist fame, has outdone himself with this much less famous film.  He is master over the enormous challenges of bringing this perilous adventure to life.  Frankly, I was astonished by the realism of this film.  I can only imagine the impact created on a big screen with surround sound.

Sorcerer is one good reason for going to the movies.  We are taken to a far away place and then put front and center into an adventure that often has us holding our breath as we sit on the edge of our seat wondering if the four men will escape one more time from dangers I have poorly described in this review - they must be seen to be believed.

I would warn potential buyers to know what they are getting, though. The transfer isn't bad, really, considering the time the movie was made, but this dvd is pan and scan, which is a travesty. An even larger travesty is that this is the only dvd available, to my knowledge. It kills me that so many worthless movies have been released on bluray (and not just recent movies), when stuff like this has barely been released at all.

This is an intelligent action/ adventure film that cries out for, at the least, widescreen release, if not bluray, and all we have is this pan and scan version.

Still worth buying for those who wish to see the film. It made Ebert's list of most unappreciated films of the '70s.

I bought it just to show support for a better version.

Edit: Since I cannot apparently review the recently released bluray since I reviewed the dvd, I will add the bluray review here. Finally, a great transfer of this movie to home video.

Unlike those films, however, Sorcerer seems to have been crippled by focus on stunts and production, over plot and pacing. The original Wages of Fear lagged needlessly in the first hour, and Sorcerer only extends that part of the story to no particular purpose besides a sort of self-indulgent wallowing. Extra time is spent on giving additional background to the protagonists, but we get to know them in less depth psychologically as individuals than in the original.

The framing of shots is painfully dated, distinctly 80s in style. The synthesizer score, praised in some quarters, only adds to the limited 80s vibe of the piece. It's never a good sign when the 50s version feels more modern than the more recent remake.

Roy Scheider is as good as ever, which is to say excellent. Unfortunately, the editing gives little visibility to the best aspects of his performance potential. Bruno Cremer brings little to the table. The other leads are forgettable/inadvertently comical.

I would recommend purchasing and viewing the movie, but read up on its production history first [...]. It'll make the stodgy pacing more bearable, and allow you to enjoy the stunt set pieces in their full, blinkered glory.",1302912000,,1457,5.109243697478991

Like many fans, I've found the pan-and-scan DVD that's been around for over a decade underwhelming, but as it's the only way to watch this overlooked masterpiece, I've put up with it.

Great news for fans: William Friedkin is currently supervising a new Blu-ray edition of his film, which should be ready for release at the end of this year, or early next. Stay tuned for Amazon pre-ordering when the official release date is announced!",1297296000,16,537,4.836956521739131
67213,3,078322947X,"I've been a fan of this movie since I saw it in the theatres back in 1977.  It would be many, many years later before I could watch it again -- this time on DVD in 4:3 aspect ratio.  But it really didn't diminish the experience for me.  The lack of a widescreen presentation was disappointing but you get over that about 5 minutes into the film.

Was delighted to learn in 2013 of the upcoming film restoration and eventual Blu-ray release, and I picked it up the day the Blu-ray came out.  Almost immediately it was unsettling to watch.

Whoever did the color enhancement went WAY overboard with the greens.  The grass, plants, tree leaves, etc are so vibrantly green that they practically glow.  It is very distracting.  In some cases the ""greening effect"" bleeds into other things in the shot and you can detect a slight green hue in things that shouldn't have one.

I've watched this DVD on two separate players and on two separate hi-def televisions but the effect is the same.  In their attempt to brighten up the colors they went a bit overboard for my tastes.

The setting and story in ""Sorcerer"" is meant to be a bit gritty and dirty.  I think it works better when it doesn't look like Ted Turner colorized it.

I'm glad I got to see it in widescreen again.  But for future viewings I'll go back to my DVD copy that is a little grainier and less brightly colored.  For me that version just looks right.

For the record, here's my initial review from several years ago that I had to delete in order to add the updates above:

""Sorcerer"" had the misfortune of being released in the theaters around the same time as ""Star Wars"". Woe unto any other film that hoped to find any real press attention during that time. I put ""Sorcerer"" up there with ""The Exorcist"" and ""The French Connection"" as one of William Friedkin's best films.

Much has already been written about how and why it wasn't a box-office success, so I will dispense with that discussion here. But don't fall into the trap of believing that because a film wasn't a hit that it wasn't any good. If you do that you will miss out on some of the best films ever made.

I can remember going to see ""Star Wars"" at the theater back in '77 and seeing the trailer for ""Sorcerer"" and the poster in the lobby. I remember thinking at the time that ""Sorcerer"" looked rather unappealing but only because it was juxtaposed against ""Star Wars"". Timing is everything in the movie business.

Of particular interest in this film is the scene where Scheider and company attempt to drive trucks laden with unstable nitroglycerin across a dilapidated rope-supported bridge during a rainstorm and in high wind. Everyone who discusses this movie seems to refer to that scene. It's a good one. It's very tense and exciting. I knew how it ended and I was still on the edge of my seat.

I'm not thrilled that the DVD release is in 4:3 asect ratio. But after a few minutes one forgets what aspect ratio the film is in and just settles in to enjoy it.

The DVD picture is pretty clean and sharp. There are a few bonus features and a theatrical trailer.

This is an American movie but it has a European feel to it, especially in the first half. By that I mean we watch the events unfold without a lot of exposition or immediate explanation. The thrust of the film doesn't really begin until the midway point.

Roy Scheider plays the lead, but Steve McQueen and Nick Nolte were also considered for the role.",1297209600,,3445,4.456140350877193

67236,5,078322947X,"I just watched THE WAGES OF FEAR on BLU-RAY and must admit though it was very good, I still don't see how people can say it was better than William Friedkin's 1977 SORCERER. Friedkin added all of the elements of WAGES into his film and more, such as: The dubius backgrounds of the four men who are trapped in the God-forsaken South American country, how they ended up there, and how they must now find a way out by any means possible, even if it's driving two broken-down trucks filled with unstable nitroglycerine across 218 miles of rugged terrain, not knowing who they can trust.

Their desperation leads us to understand why they would volunteer and accept this suicide mission; If they want their lives and loved ones back, THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO, a plot point that is lacking from THE WAGES OF FEAR.

Both films boast a great international cast, great location shooting, and tough, no-nonsense, tight, gritty direction from two great film directors who are themselves the stars of their films.

With THE WAGES OF FEAR you get:
A great intense original story, filmed in glorious black and white and presented in it's original  aspect ratio of 1.37:1, the standard at the time(1953), and presented by Criterion in pristine condition with plenty of extra's. You get real explosions (no special effects here), a white knuckle ride, Spectacular cleavage shots of the lovely Vera Clouzot, a shock ending, and you get to see Yves Montand go from French singing star, to leading man status all in one film due to Henri-Georges Clouzet's guidence and masterfull direction.

With SORCERER you get:
A great re-telling of a great story, told coldly, harshly, with real explosions (no special effects here), more intensity, more scope, more violence, color, Roy Scheider, Tangerine Dream, Mafia, Bandido's, a haunting ending, all by the man who brought you THE EXORCIST, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, and TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A.. What's not to like?

Roger Ebert named SORCERER one of the ten best movies of 1977.

A BUDGET OF 22 MILLION, IT EARNED AN ESTIMATED 12 MILLION
This film had the unfortunate luck of being released less than one month after the first STAR WARS movie was released, while the country was still buzzing over ROCKY, which may have led to SORCERER's  box office disappointment.  Another reason was that many critics unfairly panned SORCERER probably because of Friedkin's audacity to recreate a classic (apparently a no-no at the time), which is funny in this day and age of remakes and re-imaginings. At any rate, this film is now much more accepted and appreciated among critics, garnering an 80 percent approval rating at ROTTENTOMATOES.COM.

WIDESCREEN/ FULLSCREEN
My problem is that SORCERER was filmed (according to the Internet Movie Database) in the aspect ratio of 1.85:1 and NOT the 1.33:1 pan & scan DVD version available today. As of this date (June of 2010) HIGH-DEF DIGEST has listed SORCERER on their docket of films to be released on Blu-Ray, however, they give no date, or even year, so, I will continue to wait patiently for the Blu-ray.

FYI; 2012 marks the 35 anniversary of SORCERER.

But if you want my opinion on which to buy; collect both. They're both great films. The Criterion edition of THE WAGES OF FEAR on Blu-Ray is excellent, but definatly wait for SORCERER to be released on Blu-Ray.

Finaly I just want to suggest, as of rule of thumb to ALL filmmakers who are seeing their films re-released in Blu-Ray, Do what you will to update your film, whether it be cropping, changing the aspect ratio, adding or deleting scenes, etc..., but alway's alway's ALWAY'S give us the original theatrical release as well. Yes it's that important, and I don't mind paying extra for a classic.

67241,5,078322947X,"If you are considering this film, no doubt you know that it is a remake (or hommage to) the classic French thriller Wages of Fear. Chances are everyone is also familiar with the outlines of the plot--a group desparate men agree to transport cargoes of unstable dynamite through 200 miles of South American jungle to put out an oilfield fire. Of course the drivers know they have voluneered for a suicidal job and the odds are against the survival of any of the truck drivers. That alone puts Sorcerer (along with Runaway Train & Sam Peckinpaw's The Wild Bunch) into the rarest category of films: the big-budget Hollywood existential! My view, a distinct minority view, is that William Friedkin's remake surpasses the orginal as an exercise in suspense and harrowing, relentless action. Like many other fans of this movie, my introduction came during the 1980s on cable movie channels. Few people saw Sorcerer on the big screen. The film was initally panned by critics and cited as a prime example of a young director with too much ego, power and money creating yet another Hollywood box-office disaster. Gradually, the film acquired an audience and a legacy through word of mouth. Today many critics see Sorcerer as the last great product of the seventies generation of young Hollywood film-makers. It is no accident that Sorcerer and Star Wars opened the same day! In many ways, the film marks the transition from the courageous experimental Hollywood of the seventies to the family blockbusters and action franchises of today.  Fans of Sorceror appreciate the director's  commitment to the story of desperate men risking everything to escape a very realistic, modern version of hell on earth. The opening backstory sequences show us how a small-time New Jersey criminal, a disgraced French banker, a Mexican assassin, and an Arab terrorist find themselves driving old trucks that can (and will) explode at any moment. The film has a hypnotic, dreamlike feel and the viewer will be drawn into a dark journey that can only end one way. The score by the German band Tangerine Dream is at once seductive and chilling and contributes to the growing atmosphere of susense and dread. If you like stylish action and relentless story-telling, you should not miss this film. The DVD quality is OK but perhaps we might hope for a remastered director's cut with better special features at some point.",1271376000,,2390,4.957605985037406
67242,3,078322947X,"I saw this on the ""big screen"" when it was first released. I had seen Clouzot's Wages of Fear and loved it, and wanted to see what The Exorcist's Billy Friedkin could do with it. Pardon the pun, but ""Sorcerer"" blew me away! I thought it was--and, forty+ years later, still is--one of the greatest action movies ever made.

I could not figure out why more people didn't see it, why it didn't win awards, why it wasn't praised by the critics, why the studio didn't push it, etc.. Very unfair. I once read that for many people, the title was a problem. They thought it was a fantasy/horror movie about the occult or witchcraft or demons, which is logical, considering the impact of The Exorcist. I also heard Friedkin, basking in the well-deserved accolades from that film, thought of himself as the next Francis Ford Coppola, became a huge pain in the patoot, and so the studio wanted to teach him a lesson by not promoting the movie. Well, Sorcerer came and went faster than a popsicle on a NYC sidewalk in July. And that has continued to this day. The movie is almost completely unknown. It's really so unjust, because of how great an adventure movie it is.

By the way, ""Sorcerer"" is the nickname painted on one of the key transport vehicles in the movie. The scene of the truck trying to cross the wooden bridge during the raging storm is an exercise in pure cinematic terror and suspense.

Yes, the other folks who complained about the poor transfer and aspect ratio in the DVD are absolutely correct, but, until we have something better--Criterion, are you listening?--this edition will have to do. It's better than nothing. The inferior presentation and transfer is the reason I give it but 3 stars. Five stars will go to the DVD when it is finally issued properly.

According to the labeling on the old lazer disc, it was released under the transfer supervision of Wm. Friedkin at the 1.66:1 original camera negative.  I am reading this off my personal LD copy.  I have compared the picture of the LD to the DVD for cropping and P&S alterations.  There is no change or loss of picture between the two formats!  What the studio did on the DVD was to anamorphically ""squeeze"" the whole 1.66:1 picture into the old academy 1.33:1 format.  The DVD is not P&S.  It has been altered to fit most standard size TV's without any loss of image.  Anybody with a modern digital TV can play the DVD and select one of the TV's various zoom modes and stretch the image back to its proper ratio for viewing.

67244,5,078322947X,"""The Sorcerer"" (1977) directed by William Friedkin is a remake of the French film from 1953 ""The Wages of Fear"". The story relates the tale of four European's who are down on their luck that drive two trucks over treacherous mountain roads carrying nitroglycerine in order to extinguish a oil well explosion. This version differs from the original in several ways, including the beginning, which focuses on the lives of the four men before they came to South America. We learn what drove the men to seek refuge in this outpost of civilization that hugs the edges of a jungle. What follows from this initial sequence of introductions is some of the most harrowing action episodes, including the arduous journey through the jungle with the trucks trespassing over a swollen river by route of a rickety bridge during a tempest. I'm reminded of some of the extremes a director will go to in order to make a film, such as Werner Herzog in ""Aguirre, the Wrath of God"", or in ""Fitzcarraldo"", or in Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"". Friedkin had insisted that the film be filmed in the Domincan Republic, and this lends the film an authenticity, and heightened drama. The film gradually becomes ever more like a hallucination as this perilous heart of darkness journey takes Scanlon (Roy Scheider) to the edge of his wits. One of the most horrific and jarring scenes is that of the spent Scanlon stumbling like a zombie carrying the nitroglycerine. It is a frightening depiction of a man barely hanging on to life. The title comes from the name painted on one of the trucks.

The film is notable for its electronic score by the German band Tangerine Dream. With this blu-ray release we finally get the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1, as opposed to the 1.33:1 ratio seen on the original dvd. One feels immersed within the jungle with the excellent HD Master Audio Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. The film has been wonderfully remastered so all of the dirt seen on the original dvd is gone.

67278,5,078322947X,"A truly great movie.

Just in case you haven't read the other reviews, a partial summary of the plot: the movie revolves around 4 losers who have committed some kind of major mistake in their life.  These mistakes are shown by what are essentially 4 separate opening vignettes. Then in order to escape the consequences of their actions, they have ran away and end up in HELL!  Hell is a small really crappy South American town from which they have almost no chance of escape. It is in this hell that the four losers are brought together.  Then if they brave almost certain death, they are offered a slim chance of redemption and an escape from this self made hell.  Watch the movie to learn the rest.

The other reviews may talk about comparison to the original classic french film.  Others may discuss the director and the production problems.  What they all miss and don't discuss is the realism of this movie.  All you have to do is watch this movie and you'll be convinced that they are truly in hell.  The prettiest looking woman in town next to a toothless used up prostitute is the drawing of a woman on an old coca-cola tray.  Even then when these losers stare at the tray it is open to question as to whether they lust more for this imaginary woman or the ice cold coke next to her. The hopelessness of their initial situation is made quite clear as is the fact that unless presented with a miracle this is a self created hell from which there is no escape.

This is not a movie for people who go to the cinema for escape and good feelings.  This is not a chick flick where you cry twice and rejoice in a happy ending.  This is a movie for those of us who are tired of such films and enjoy the total realism of this movie.

And the best thing of all is that the stark realism never lets up.  Even when you think the hero(?) of the movie has escaped from his self made hell, there is one last surprise.

One of the few that does is Sorcerer, a 1977 remake of The Wages of Fear.  The movie begins with introductions of four characters, all of them running for their lives as something goes wrong, one is a terrorist, another a banker, one a getaway driver, and the fourth a hitman on the run.  On the run from their pasts, these four men find themselves in a desolate, rundown Nicaraguan village.  When it seems all hope is lost, a solution presents itself, a very dangerous one.  A local oil company needs nitroglycerin transported to one of their wells.  Driving two trucks, the foursome heads out through the jungle where the slighest disrpution might set off the nitro.  The movie creates a sense of doom and dread like few others.  With every bump, your stomach drops.  The last hour is nerve-wracking all the way until the twist ending that caught me off-guard completely, and hopefully will surprise you too. It's a very real movie, almost like a documentary, putting you in the driver's seat with the characters.

Leading the four main characters, Roy Scheider plays Jackie Scanlon, a getaway driver of a robbery gone horrifically wrong.  Scanlon is on the run, a mafioso on his tail looking for revenge. Scheider is very strong here in an incredibly physical part.  Bruno Cremer is Victor Manzon, a French banker who discovers $15 million francs are missing from his bank, completely unaccounted for.  Manzon may be the most sympathetic character, a man who just wants to see his wife again.  Franciso Rabal is the most mysterious as Nilo, a hitman hiding out in the village, but we never find out why.  Amidou stars as Kassem, the lone survivor of a terrorist bombing, the rest of his men being arrested or killed.  These characters all have their faults, but the actors do such a good job you find yourself rooting for them.  Ramon Bieri has a good supporting role as Corlette, the man who sends these men on a suicide mission.

The DVD is a dissappointment unfortunately, but it's not expensive so that's good.  The movie's shown in a grainy fullscreen presentation that does make the movie look grittier, more realistic if nothing else.  Special features include a trailer and cast and crew info.

Now, I haven't seen the original (Cruezot's Wages of Fear, 1955) and I'm sure it's magnificent, but if anything I think that our reviewer is so affected by his loyalty to the original film that he is unable to watch Sorcerer with an impartial eye. Too bad for him, because he missed an unforgettable experience.
  I saw Sorcerer late one night on a cable channel, at least sixteen or seventeen years ago. I was immediately struck by the palpable terror and tension of this film. The performances of the four leads are all superb, though even with Scheider's character standing out as it did, it was the character of the Frenchman, Serrano, that I found most compelling. His ability to handle any situation with a cool head and intense inner strength was fascinating to watch.

  But of course, the real treats of this movie are the scenes that highlight the tension that simmers throughout: the crawl of the huge nitro-laden trucks across the disintegrating rope bridge in a sheeting rain storm...well, I won't mention any more or it will ruin the film.

67351,5,078322947X,"I first saw ""Sorcerer"" when 14, and I thought it was terrible.  In my 40s, I see it differently as a mirror on reality and as a great movie.

Whatever your current problems, they aren't as bad as those of the principal characters in this movie.  They are four men who are refugees from greater society (a terrorist, a man wanted for high-stakes financial malfeasance, a petty criminal wanted by the Mob, and a professional assassin).  They all flee to a nasty South American back water town, and then the sabotage of an industrial facility 200 miles distant causes an oil well fire.  Dynamite to put out the fire is located near the back water town, but it is very old and copiously leaching nitroglycerine.  It has to be driven the 200 miles over truly bad third-world mountain-and-jungle roads, and the only available vehicles are a scrap heap of ancient trucks.  The company asks for volunteers, and the four get selected.  They cobble together two working trucks, and then the road trip begins.

What's great about the movie is watching how the men react to the enormous stress placed on them by the task they've accepted and how it tears them apart.  They are beset by truly awful conditions (old and rotten rope-and-wood bridges, giant trees across the road, endless rain, crumbling mountainside roads, bandits, etc.) that take an enormous toll on the participants.  It ends with the Roy Scheider character, clearly insane, hand-carrying the dynamite to the fire fighters.  There is no happy ending here for anyone.

This was the movie William Freidkin made after ""The Exorcist.""  Called, ""The toughest, most relentless film in a long time"" by a contemporary Newsweek review, it lives up to that and more.  The score by synthesizer band Tangerine Dream helps propel the story along.

It is a great adventure movie.",1200528000,,1820,4.8603896103896105

I hate to say that I first saw it on cable not knowing anything about the movie and really loved it.
After multiple viewings the Roxie theatre in San Francisco showed both 'Wages of Fear' & 'Sorcerer' w/ William Freidkin in attendance.
I went figuring he would talk for about 5 minutes and split.
After both movies were shown he spoke for about 45 minutes taking questions from the audience.
What an amazing evening as he went into detail about the genesis of Sorcerer...
- when he arrived into the town as they were preparing to shoot the movies 1000's of people were leaving in fear because the Director of the Excorcist was coming to town, and how a river in it's own history had never dried up did just that costing another 100K to rebuild the bridge that you see in the movie earning him the name 'Freddie the Bridge Builder'.
 - his chance meeting w/ a band member of Tangerine Dream at a party and that person taking him to an abandoned church in the middle of the night where they lived and rehearsed  waking up the other band members and performing till sunrise.
 Friedkin told them that he was interested in them scoring the music for his next movie.
He sent them the script during movie production and every few weeks he would get these cassette tapes w/ bits and pieces of what ended up being the soundtrack for Sorcerer.
He had a ton of stories and my biggest regret was not videotaping this event as I brought a camera but chickened out at the last minute!

67355,5,078322947X,"""Sorcerer"" is a 1977 adaptation of the French 1952 classic ""The Wages of Fear"" which curiously neither improves upon the original, nor denigrates it.

The ""sorcerer"" of this film is fate, which gathers four outcast men of four different countries together. These have nothing in common but are obligated to collaborate for the same reasons, money and redemption of honour and place in their low-rent society. Their impossible task: take unstable nitro glycerine over the jungle in shabby trucks (not comfy Defender 90s and Land Cruisers) with busted shocks and fractured springs.

This version is very faithful to the novel, which clearly presented a challenge for filming and likely busted the budget. Roy Scheider is excellent, coming off his work in ""Marathon Man"" and ""Jaws.""

This is a guys and beer movie: pessimistic, ironic, wor-out tools, tired souls, Sisyphean, and an unhappy ending.

The weird score by Tangerine Dream's score actually works and the colors and soft focus used throughout create a hallucinogenic dream-like state that speaks of the sweat and exhaustion the characters go through.",1188518400,,1107,5.2727272727272725

67421,5,078322947X,"I saw this film in theater in when it was first released in 1977 and knew right away it was something special.  The first part of the film is a bit disconnected but sets the context for the story.  Four men have run afoul of either the law or powerful people and must flee--by some quirk of fate they all end up broke and desperate in the same godforsaken tropical hell-hole.  Their only of chance escape is to undertake a well-paid but extremely dangerous, almost suicidal, driving mission--they must transport unstable dynamite over primitive mountain roads to blow out an oil well fire deep in the jungle.  They are driving rehabbed 2 1/2 -ton army-surplus trucks, one of which is named Sorcerer (hence the title of the film).  The actual journey, filled with all sorts of obstacles and risks, is the heart of the film.  A camera mounted near the front wheel gives you a view into the canyon as the tire skirts the edge of a sheer drop-off, knocking rocks into the void.  The scene where they have to cross a raging river in a torrential rainstorm on a flimsy rope and wood bridge is one of the most riveting and suspenseful I've seen in any film.  Roy Scheider does a great job portraying the driven energy of his character and is clearly the star here.

The dark quality of the film is greatly enhanced by Tangerine Dream's ominous and menacing soundtrack.  I'd never heard of Tangerine Dream before seing this film but became an instant fan.  Definitely consider getting the soundtrack CD also.

67424,3,078322947X,"You have to admire Friedkin for the way he tackled this project. He was in awe of the French thriller ""The Wages of Fear"" (1953) and challenged himself to do an original retelling of the story. He refused to borrow the best elements of that classic and just took the basic storyline; totally altering its film-making style and carefully excising the very elements he most admired in the original-substituting his own ideas and avoiding any hint of taking the easy way out. Even insisting on a title that reflected not the film but the process of transforming the original into something very different; and it was a two year $22 million process. This was his masterpiece (he had earned the chance with two big hits-""The French Connection"" and ""The Exorcist"") and he wanted ""The Wages of Fear"" to be his inspiration, not his blueprint.

So instead of a subtle off-camera explosion, ""Sorcerer"" graphically illustrates the event. Instead of a languid first half character study he shows short action-oriented background segments. Instead of an undefined location (filmed in the south of France it could be anywhere from the Middle East to South America) he titles his locations and sets the main story in Venezuela (filmed in the jungles of the Dominican Republic).

And on the most fundamental level the claustrophobic closeness of ""The Wages of Fear"" (its most unique and pervasive element) is replaced with a distanced perspective. Tight shots become wide shots, interior scenes are brought outside, a bigger budget transforms intimacy into scale. While you especially admire Friedkin for taking this risk, it is unfortunately the film's fatal flaw (at least comparatively). Without the tight shots in the truck cabs and the evolving relationships between the characters, there is little to identify with and no real point of view established. Because the motivations are superficial, the reactions are unconvincing and the suspense less involving.

What is left is a good action picture without the basic themes and extreme dimensionality of the original.

Four desperate men lack the funds to escape Porvenir, a backwater village in South America. Nilo (Francisco Rabal) is an assassin from a Central American city, Kassen (Amidou) is a Palestinian bomber, Victor (Bruno Cremer) is a white collar criminal from Paris, and Jackie (Roy Scheider) is a small time American hood fleeing a mob contract. When a revolutionary group sets fire to an oil rig, the company offers big bucks to anyone who will drive a load of very unstable explosives 200 miles to the wellhead; where they will be used to blow out the fire.

Amidou was Friedkin's only first choice for a part, the other three parts were offered to actors who turned them down and he was forced to settle for this cast.  Which could  be one reason that Friedkin pulled back his camera and minimized the acting component of the film.

For some reason a great deal of time is spent filming the men repairing two junked trucks, getting them ready for the expedition. Then they are off and the superiority of ""The Wages of Sin"" begins to really show. In that film an early obstacle is a hairpin turn that requires the trucks to back up. What happens to the first truck sets the viewer up for the difficulties that the second truck will have. In ""Sorcerer"" Friedkin substitutes a more elaborate bridge, but the sequential technique does not work nearly as well.

There is some astonishing cinematography in this part of the film, and a gripping musical score by Tangerine Dream.  It would be nice to have it available in the original widescreen format.

67468,3,078322947X,"The much maligned Sorcerer is in fact a good well crafted thriller that if seen without refrence to the Original Wages of Fear would have faired far better at the hands of the critics. That's not to say the film is perfect. The opening scenes that fill the viewer in on the charecters back stories, are pointless and actually work against the tension that is built up later in the film. Knowing exactly why the characters are desperate makes their reasons for taking on the deadly task seem a bit lame and looses the exestential angst that creates such a hopeless atmosphere.

Once in South America the oppresive nature of their stay in the village is also diminshed by knowing too much about them. Having said all that there is still an air of desperation and mounting frustration, it's just not as clausterphobic as it could have been. Once the journey begins the tension is turned on, the only problem is that by knowing the original so well there is not quite the frisson of that classic. This is an unfortunate by-product of re-making any well respected film. Friedkin however has a fair go and if this is the film you see first you will wonder why it was so slated on original release.

The film moves at a well constructed pace that is aided by a cracking score from Tangerine Dream. The cast perform well and Roy Scheider is reasonably well cast but does not deliver the subtly nuanced performance he is capable of, for this you need to look towards (obviously) Jaws and to a lesser extent the minor role he playes in Naked Lunch.

All in all a good film, though not great, and as the review starts by saying, not Wages Of Fear, but it deserves a better reputation than it so unfortunatly has and will be a good addition to anyones collection of interesting 70's films (the best decade for American Filmaking by a long long way).",1127952000,3,1837,4.52710843373494
67469,4,078322947X,"A group of four desperate men, from all corners of the Earth, escape to a decrepit South American oil mining village. A fire breaks out at the company's new oil well, burning out of control. The only option to get production back on track is to blow the fire out, using dynamite. The only dynamite available is highly unstable and the only means of transportation is by truck, 200 miles through the jungle. The oil company offers a large reward, enough for each of the four men to escape the living hell.

""Sorcerer"", produced in 1977, and directed by William Friedkin, is a remake of the French classic ""Wages of Fear"". Usually, I can't stand remakes, but in the case of ""Sorcerer"", Friedkin reinterprets parts of the film, while retaining the white-knuckle suspense sequences. He doesn't create a new film, but when compared to ""Wages of Fear"", really one of the best films ever made, ""Sorcerer"" is really very good.

""Sorcerer"" was one of the many International productions studios created in the 70s. These films were filled with international casts in an attempt to secure an audience in the various countries. Now, American movie stars are so big oversees, they really don't have to worry about it.

""Sorcerer"" begins with the story of why each of these men found it necessary to live in this South American hell hole. I am not certain, but I think that ""Sorcerer"" did not make a lot of money. Perhaps one of the reasons for this is that each and every character has many, many faults. Personally, I like this. No one is perfect and these characters are more interesting to me. Roy Scheider plays Scanlon, a New Jersey hood who participates in the wrong job. Bruno Cremer plays Serrano, a French investment banker. Francisco Rabal plays Nilo, a South American hitman. Amidou plays Kassem, a bomber on the run from Tel Aviv. Each of these characters makes a decision to escape to the little South American town, but then desperately wants to escape. The town is in the Rain Forest and they quickly become tired of the poverty, disease, mud and rain surrounding them. Their willingness to accept such a high risk mission is very believable.

The cinematography is lush and waterlogged, adding to the realism of the film. Once they begin their journey, they traverse land in just about every climate and the viewer feels as though he is along for the ride.

Scheider has never been one of my favorite actors, but in this film, he is very believable. He and the other three members of the team all seem very desperate to escape, very determined to make it through the obstacle course they have embarked upon, and very determined to make it home.

Much like ""Wages of Fear"", the first half of the film sets up the circumstances of the four characters and then life in the village. This is a very necessary part of the process. They hate living there and we, the viewer, have to see why. The second half involves the trek to get the dynamite to the oil drilling site. It is a harrowing journey, one that had me on the edge of my seat, even though I watched the journey in `Wages of Fear"" a few months ago.

There are two problems with ""Sorcerer"". The first is the score by Tangerine Dream. I didn't think it added anything to the suspense scenes and would have preferred to watch the scenes with no score. To me, this is so much more effective. Let us determine when we should get excited. If you don't cue us, we will be that much more excited when something happens.

The second is Roy Scheider's performance is ruined in the last few moments. Cheesy graphics and voice overs are used to tell us the state of his character. Again, unneeded and it simply provides an opportunity for Scheider to chew the scenery.

Overall, ""Sorcerer"" is a very good film and a really good example of superb action filmmaking. Rent ""Wages of Fear"" first and then watch this film. You won't be bored for a second.",1113264000,2,3895,4.600864553314121
67470,5,078322947X,"REVISED FOR THE BLU-RAY RELEASE AND INFORMATION ON THE DVD REISSUE AS WELL.

William Friedkin's remake of ""The Wages of Fear"" brought a more contemporary, edgy slant to a classic French film. The scale is bigger but the plot remains the same; Roy Scheider plays Jackie Scanlan a member of a crew who accepts what appears to be a suicidal mission; transport nitroglycerin across the treacherous landscape of South America to put out a massive oil fire. All four members of the driving crew have shady pasts making this an ideal chance to escape from the events haunting them at home.

In my humble opinion, this is a five star movie and superior to the film that inspired Friedkin to make this.

The remastered, restored blu-ray release of this classic film looks terrific--colors pop and depth is exceptionally good even considering that this is on a single layer blu-ray disc.

The new remastered widescreen DVD uses the same new transfer supervised by the director.

The 5.1 HD master audio sounds marvelous adding to the suspense of a terrific film.

The blu-ray, beyond the booklet included as part of the package (this may receive a regular blu release later in a standard keep case as is often the case with these Warner book-style releases)is truly the only ""extra"" included here which is unfortunate--a commentary track by Friedkin would be welcome discussing the difficult making of the film. I'm not sure if a vintage featurette (these often appeared on TV to promote films)exists for the film or not but if it did it would be nice to include that as well.

Still, the booklet is very good with Friedkin discussing the making of the film and plenty of photos. I'm sure that the booklet is excerpted from Friedkin's new memior The Friedkin Connection which is (curiously) adverised on the back of the hardbound book that houses the blu-ray.

Friedkin's vision and the shooting ran out of control contributing to the unforgettable atmosphere of tension that lingers in the finished film. During shooting Friedkin routinely fired crew members forcing the production company to fly them out of the remote location jungle in the Dominican Republic adding to the film's budget. The replacement members had to be flown in as well. Tensions ran high and tempers flared due to illness, production screw ups and the location which, ironically, created a sense of claustrophobia and isolation. While many prefer the original classic French film, Friedkin's remake creates its own unique signature with the outrageous stunts and dangerous conditions that dogged the crew at every turn.

Nominated for an Oscar for Best Sound, ""Sorcerer"" remains a taunt, flawed classic that sound be seen. It stands apart from its source film and on its own. While I love ""The Wages of Fear"", Friedkin's film captured my imagination when I first saw it in theaters. The blu-ray looks marvelous with a sharp, beautifully rendered restoration.

67473,4,078322947X,"Sorcerer showed up in the mail via NetFlix and for the life of me I couldn't remember why I ordered it. One theory is that I thought it was a fantasy flick. The title has little to do with the movie itself and it's certainly not about fantasy sorcerers casting spells. Another possibility, and more likely, is that I was writing a review of Vertical Limit and someone mentioned that Sorcerer did it first.
It doesn't matter, I watched the movie anyway. And what I saw was alternately painful and enthralling.
Sorcerer is about four men down on their luck. Actually, that's an understatement. They're not just down on their luck; they're at the very rock bottom of their lives. They are each one step away from complete oblivion, be it at an assassin's hand or their own.
The movie starts out with little apology tracking these four independent threads. The first half hour of the film makes no sense because we don't know what we're seeing: one Frenchman businessman is ruined and flees the country; a New York wheelman crosses the wrong gang; a Middle Eastern terrorist bombs a dwelling; one is an assassin. They are all on the run from their respective countries.
They all end up in Vera Cruz, in South America, a stinking fissure in the earth. Naked children and dogs wander the streets. Everything is encrusted in dirt and the slime of sweat, rain, mud, and oil. The only place a man can find work is at the oil company upon which Vera Cruz depends for its survival.
An explosion sabotages the well. The oil burns and will burn forever unless it is covered - and that requires explosives. Of course, in the South American jungles the nearest cache of nitroglycerine has been festering for years and become highly unstable. It can't be lifted by helicopter, so trucks must carry it. One strong bump and the nitroglycerine explodes.
Finally, the movie gets interesting. We have four unlikable characters forced to work together. They must battle the elements, bandits, and human stupidity to ensure their cargo and their lives make it to the oil well intact.
If you recall Vertical Limit, the concepts were the same: different groups armed with nitroglycerine must brave nature and the elements for some noble cause. While not as gut wrenching as Vertical Limit, Sorcerer manages to inject pathos into the characters. They weep, they take desperate measures, and they become more noble as they rise to each crushing challenge.
Ultimately, all of them came to Vera Cruz to flee something else. Now that they have come to Hell, like Orpheus and Dante they must descend to its bowels to escape it. The journey with the nitroglycerine is their purgatory.
It's no surprise that few of the characters survive, but the movie goes one step further. The sole survivor finds solace in the dirt and horror of the town itself. In short, his journey to get enough money to escape was about selfish ends until he realizes that his struggles had purpose - he saved the town's fate, at least for a little while. His own life is precious. And so, he uses his last moments before leaving to dance with a haggard woman rather than make his escape. His redemption will not be satisfied with anything but his death.
And the name of the movie? Sorcerer is the name of the truck.",1079913600,8,3258,4.6975524475524475

The third man, a Middle Eastern terrorist flees his captors after being caught participating in a bombing, and the fourth man is a shady assassin type apparently on the run from repercussion from his last hit.
The key is all four men end up in a South American rat-infested stink hole of a town called Vera Cruz.  After awhile, they find their sanctuary has become more of a prison and all begin a desperate search for a way out, but that involves money, a commodity that's in short supply, with the only work available in the area is provided by an oil company that runs a well and is building a pipeline for the bubbling crude.  Dangerous work, and the pay is so low that it would take years to earn enough to leave.  Salvation for the men comes in a catastrophic disaster, an explosion damaging the well and causing the oil to burn.
The only way to close the well proper for repairs is to blow it up, and the only explosives available are 200 miles away.  Turns out the explosives, sticks of nitro, haven't been tended very well, and, in turn, are highly unstable.  The company decides to hire four men to drive two trucks to carry the dangerous materials through 200 miles of dangerous jungle, including prehistoric rope and wood bridges, treacherous mountain passes, deadly bandits and swampy roads laden with fallen trees.  The suicide mission draws the four men, as the money would allow them to escape the oppressive town.  The most intense scenes for me involved the men trying to traverse a rickety, rotting wooden rope suspension bridge over a raging river during a heavy rainstorm.  There were times when the truck on the bridge was at such an angle, I thought it would flip right off.  And all the actors performed most all their own stunts, adding to the realism of the movie.  Do they make it?  See the movie and find out.  I especially liked the very end.  A very nice touch that reminded me of an ending of a certain Alfred Hitchcock movie.  Which one?  I won't say, as it would give it away.
The movie runs just under two hours, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.  Friedkin and the actors do a wonderful job in developing tensions between the characters and the environment and the between the characters themselves.  The pacing is a bit slow, but it's deliberate, cranking the suspense up, notch by grueling notch.
There are sparse special features, including pretty thorough productions notes and a trailer.  If you enjoy thrilling adventure, you will most likely like this movie.  I would have happily given this movie five stars but it is only available in the full screen format.  Something I didn't understand is the title for the movie.  I wasn't able to figure out what it had to do with the movie....

67551,5,078322947X,"Yes, 5 stars is for the film itself. It is arguably THE MOST nerve-wracking cinematic experience ever filmed. Now with that said, here is the proof that ""Sorcerer"" was shot in widescreen:

1. Look at the picture of all five men on the back of the DVD cover. You can see only a trim of the German's face on the right side, and the man to the far left side has his head in full view. Now watch that sequence on this full-frame DVD and you cannot see the German at all, and you can only see half of the man's head on the left. Then after the man tells the others that they leave in four hours, it cuts back to them again, AND YOU CANNOT SEE THE MAN ON THE LEFT SIDE ANYMORE, AND THE GERMAN MAN IS IN FULL VIEW.

2. When you watch the original theatrical trailer, there is a shot from the sequence when the hitman and Domiguez are being questioned about the contents of their truck at gunpoint by a terrorist group. When the two first see the group, there is a shot where you see three men pointing automatic guns at the screen. BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY ONLY SEEN AS TWO MEN IN THE FULL-FRAME FILM. THE MAN YOU SEE TO THE RIGHT IN THE THEATRICAL TRAILER IS CUT OFF.

3. Supposedly, there was a Laserdisc version of ""Sorcerer"" presented in it's original 1.66:1 ratio.

So please, don't gimmie any bull about this film being shot in full-frame. Friedkin may have his wishes to keep this movie in a 1.33:1 ratio, but I say that Universal Pictures is just being lazy in keeping the movie this way.

67553,5,078322947X,"Long before I went to the public library and read ""The Wages of Fear""-- a fantastic book-- I became intrigued with ""Scorcerer"".
  It had an edgy soundtrack and an edgy look.  Much of the tension and suspense was understated... and being plugged in to a more international view of the cinema, I loved the grit.
  The characters are rock-hard and chisled tough.  You feel their intensity with a look or a phrase.  The setting is the stuff only B. Traven, and the guys from ""Treasure of Sierra Madre"" would be proud of... I could see Bogart playing Scanlon,the New York hood, Belmondo, Omar Sharif, and many other fantastic international actors in these parts.
  The way the jungle [stinks] you in might seem, outwardly hokey, but Frankenheimer is masterful at using incliment weather and 3rd world rotting structures (like the rope bridge) to heighten the effect of man versus nature... and man is small in this.
  How greed and ambition overcomes seemingly hopeless odds is amazing.  You root for the main characters, despite the fact that they are seedy criminals.  Amazingly enough... a great sense of humanity is defined, and you are transported into another world.
  ""Scorcerer"" does not have the aires of ""Agguire, Wrath of God"" or its presumption.  These men are not fools or blustering dreamers... just desperate souls seeking some sense of practical salvation.
  What a stroke of genius to have ""Tangerine Dream"" modulate the soundtrack... the mix of electronic moog musak and a dark, hungry jungle are magnetic.

They are all in big trouble and are facing prison or death.  Their escape is to a place where no one wants to look for them.  This place of exile is nearly as bad as what they ran away from though.  There is nothing to do but sweat and live in squalor.  They get a chance to make enough money to escape this hell but it is a dangerous drive through the jungle on poorly maintained roads to say the least.  They are carrying nitro and have to travel something like 200 miles to reach their destination.  But these are desperate men willing to gamble with their lives because their lives have become hopeless anyway.  The soundtrack by Tangerine Dream is as intense as the movie.

Why the studio has decided to release a shoddy version on DVD is beyond me-- perhaps Friedkin's personality (not unlike that of James Cameron) has made him too many enemies.  Nevertheless, this is a gritty grimy film with some outstanding sequences that could never be equalled by computer generated imagery (the suspension bridge crossing is definitely one of the most suspenseful scenes in all of cinema) and a truly stand-out score by Tangerine Dream (which turned me into a life-long fan of the group).  Performances and editing are superb, though the film does have its rough edges (some awkward camerawork, too-obvious details like the bride with the black eye).  Still, it is a memorable viewing experience.  They just don't make 'em like this anymore.
Trivia footnote: Friedkin put a portrait of Charles Bludhorn, chairman of Gulf + Western (parent company of Paramount) on the wall of the oil company.  G+W had many investments in South America, and Bludhorn was not pleased (to say the least) when he saw his picture in the film.",1039132800,,1324,4.914798206278027

67634,4,078322947X,"It's kind of neat to see so many rave reviews of this film that I was afraid was becoming forgotten. Initially, I simply knew this film to be one that scared the [heck] out of me as a kid. Later, on cable, after finally getting used to the scenes with graphic gore, I wistfully lamented that they truly don't make films like they used to. This film is echt-70's in its ruggedly authentic portrayal of working men and third-world environments. It's really too bad we don't see any of this ""celebrated"" in film anymore. Even the films inspired by the 70s genre of auto race and chase films make a garage look like an MTV video, as if there's only money, and no work, going into the labors. By contrast, Sorcerer is at once artistically elegant, beautifully filmed, and yet extremely true to the class of man it portrays. It is similarly impressive in portraying its third-world environments. The only drawback for me is that one of the critical action scenes (which most viewers consider outstanding) strikes me as stretching and stretching the bounds of credibility. It's intense, yes, but some shots make me think that the laws of physics had been temporarily adjusted. I wonder if the filmmakers lost a truck or two on that bridge... Another little drawback was that a minor character from early in the film needs to be recognized in order to identify how the film ends. Those who aren't strong at memorizing faces may have a problem here, but this is a minor complaint since the film is worth watching at least two times anyway so as to better place everything into the overall direction of the story, once you've identified it. What was the rule? At least 3 good scenes and no bad ones to make a great movie? The existential sequence at the end certainly qualifies. It is weird! I'm also a fan of the truck-repair sequence in the middle. Unfortunately, the key truck-driving scene later on seems to me to stretch credibility and interfere with the otherwise pervasive realism. Maybe it's not quite a great film... I couldn't say that the oil explosion and charred bodies scenes that so horrified me in my youth deserve to be called great.  Effective, anyway...

67637,5,078322947X,"Inspired in part by the many Strangers-brought-together-by-a- mastermind type of heist film that was quite popular in the seventies and came back as Quentin Terentino's Reservoir Dogs in the nineties, this is the angle which Friedkin adopted for the retelling of the Wages of Fear, a novel made into a French film which achieved world wide renown.
The film is short on dialogue because Friedkin chooses to tell the story cinematically, and what dialogue is included, is there as part of natural surroundings. The characters are not acting on the stage for the audience, they are dealing with and are reacting to each other.
Among this films's many strengths is that it is shot on location and does not have the feel of a stage production. Sorcerer is a naturalistic filming at its best that shows both, how man can triumph over the environment through endurance and inventiveness, and it also shows how trials can rehabilitate and beautify character. Friedkin does a marvelous job illustrating this point with Scheider's moral transformation in the end, when he helps the cleaning woman off the floor. The film's abrupt ending isjarring, unrealistic, an afterthought and no doubt an influence of Friedkin's past horror films.
Friedkin focuses on off the road driving as his dramatic stage, at a time when SUV's were not yet invented and such driving was not a form of rugged recreation, but dangerous necessity. In the real world it could have been life saving medicines for an isolated tropical region for valuable cargo, as to the road hazards, it could have been anything from flash floods and avalanches in mountainous regions to the attack aircraft on the Ho Chi Mihn trail.
The trucks are represented quite poetically in this film, almost like the sentinent beings in their quiet menace and restrained power. Men driving them are mere bugs by comparison as they try tricking each other and grovel over as yet unattained spoils, even as the trials of the journey are about to transform and destroy them.
This spiritual dimension of the film is added to by the ultra modern for its day music score by Tangerine Dream, a CD that holds its ground even today as solidly original electronic music. If this film was a commercial failure, then it must have been a marketing failure, because this is one great film however you look at it.",1021334400,2,2335,4.8841309823677586

While it is true that Friedkin may have FILMED ""Sorcerer"" ""full screen"", it certainly was not presented that way in theaters. If he did film it at 1.33:1, then it was matted at the top and bottem when screened in theaters, creating a widescreen look. This is a fairly common way for filmmakers even today to get a widescreen look without having to use the cumbersom and expensive anamorphic cameras and lenses that produce a real widescreen image. I can imagine that Freiedkin chose this mainly because he was working in the jungle. Smaller equipment is better equipment in such a situation.

William Friedkin was a television director before turning to film and he kept the 1:1.33 ratio used in television for this movie. What that means is, no widescreen version will ever be released because it doesn't exist. I am a huge fan of widescreen movies and I always check to see if a DVD or video I purchase is in widescreen or fullscreen format, UNLESS I read that the director wanted the film to be fullscreen (as with the later Kubrick movies, for example).
It is often assumed that a director's original vision for a film is always widescreen, or that all movies are automatically filmed in widescreen, and this simply isn't the case.  So please, before giving the thumbs up or down to a purchase based on its aspect ratio, make sure the disc or tape represents the director's desired version.

It contains almost 40 minutes of additional  material on the front of the main action, providing explanatory background  material for each of the film's main protagonists. It also contains a final  twist at the end, which was cut from the other version, released under the  story's original title of ""Wages of Fear"". The later (""Wages  of Fear"") cut was an altogether grittier version than this earlier  (""Sorcerer"") one, with all scenes shorter and tighter than their  equivalents here and with some reordered to keep the story moving along  faster.

Sadly, the other version suffers heavily from  over-sanitisation (all of the political terrorist connotations have been  expunged, for example) and has truly dreadful over-dubbing of all  non-English dialogue: a great pity as otherwise the remade ""Wages of  Fear"" would have been an altogether better film than this is. That  said, this version has some truly gripping moments, wonderfully enhanced by  the haunting Tangerine Dream soundtrack and it is well worth a watch.

67700,1,078322947X,"If you look at all the other reviews, you'll rarely see anything less than five stars and the film deserves it.  ""SORCERER"" falls into that category sometimes referred to as an ""undiscovered gem"".  My  reason for giving this DVD one star is technical.  Rather than creating a  new master from film elements, this DVD was created from an existing  full-screen SMPTE television broadcast master.  As a result, you miss all  of screen left, all of screen right, and a portion of both north and south.  ""SORCERER"" is one of my all-time favorite action films and I can  only hope that Friedkin and company release the original, theatrical  wide-screen version of this thriller.  I am so disappointed by the  technical failings of this DVD that I won't buy it unless/until it's  re-released in the theatrical format.",954288000,193,810,4.9037037037037035
67701,5,078322947X,"Sorcerer is a genuine masterpiece, especially during its first hour, when Friedkin describes the origins of the 4 characters. According to me, it is far superior from the original movie by Clouzot , and Scheider and Cremer  deliver sublime performances. this movie has a very strange atmosphere,  almost fantastic, and it stucks in your mind long after you've watched it.  The Exorcist remains Friedkin's best movie but this one comes close  second...",954288000,7,451,5.222222222222222
67702,5,078322947X,"Sorcerer is a damn good remake of Wages Of Fear. Friedkin's direction delivers killer suspense and a feeling of desperation while watching this classic. Roy Scheider delivers a great performance and the music by  Tangerine Dream fits the film perfectly. If the first half doesn't make  your toes sweat, the second half sure as hell will. Much like Friedkin  himself, this film is terribly underrated.",950918400,2,400,5.123076923076923

67775,5,078322947X,"This intensely realistic 'amoral' tale of human desperation  says more about the political and  socioeconomics of humanity in the 20th century than any film I can think of. The story, the acting, the incredible music,  and the mesmerizing cinematography 'deserved' a ton of academy award  nominations. But apparently Hollywood just couldn't deal with a film where  there were no good guys, or bad guys, or even a happy ending.  I can name  dozens of movies that have won 'best picture' awards that don't even  approach the excellence of this film! Its a movie that is entertaining in  both its stark realism-- and in its inevitable ironies. And the bridge  scenes were some of the greatest cinematic moments in motion picture  history, IMO.",945475200,2,740,4.983606557377049

Well, both films are very good. I know ""Sorcerer""  isn't the most popular nor valued but each one has his preferences and the  theme of the man which has to figth with all chances against  ever was my  preferred and in this film these is very clearly put in the screen. Both  films have very good players, but I think  in this, is one of these rare  cases when color and modern making better the final result, because in  general, remakes are poor and low the dramatism, but undoubtly  ""Sorcerer"" is an exception and has something ever impress me.  There's not adventures for children and cinema of today  almost never  attains this.",945129600,,851,4.4480519480519485
67777,5,078322947X,"William Friedkin's remake of ""Wages of Fear,"" a story about four anonymous fugitives who transport dangerously unstable explosives across the treacherous roads of a third-world south American country to pay for their escape to a better life.  ""Sorcerer"" is a very good film (though the original version is now a Criterion edition) and deserves more recognition than it received when originally released in 1977.  Friedkin's previous movie was the well-known ""The Exorcist,"" and the title ""Sorcerer"" may have misled audiences' expectations of what this film was about; de-railing Friedkin's success for a quality remake of a classic.  Nonetheless, the story is gritty as four criminals come together in an ad hoc team to accomplish a near-suicidal job, transporting ancient TNT, dripping nitro-glycerin, across impossible roads and jungle terrain.  The study of the four men and their ability to overcome stacked odds will keep you on the edge of your seat and the musical score by Tangerine Dream adds an eerie atmosphere to the setting.  While ""Wages of Fear"" broke ground on this type of genre, ""Sorcerer"" is equally as good and I think it has a better ending.  I own both on DVD and enjoy them despite the same storyline.",944784000,,1224,5.095

Roy Scheider is perfect as an American gangster on the run from the mob, who finds himself in a hell on earth with other criminals  from around the world.  The international cast and foreign locations help  make this a compelling film.  Director Friedkin reportedly wanted Steve  McQueen for the lead, but Scheider delivers.
