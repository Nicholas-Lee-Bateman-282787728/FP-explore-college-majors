8135377,5,B000GYI32W,What can I say I love The OC and if you do too this is the best way to get all 3 seasons! I also have the 4th season on pre-order!,1176163200,,130,3.225806451612903
8135378,4,B000GYI32W,"Bought this for my family who love the OC. At the time, it was the best price by far so it was a good value",1170720000,,107,3.32
8135379,4,B000GYI32W,"I was pleased with my original order.  The problem started when I received another of the same order in the mail days later.  I went on line to review my account and it showed only one order ordered of the OC.  I didn't appreciate having my credit card billed twice and having to go through all the hasstle of figuring out what to do with this additional order.  I have sent it back and registered on line to Amazon that it is returned.  I am not sure if I will be able to count on Amazon again.  I was pleased in the past, but this second shipment of the OC was over $100.00.  That is a big mistake. I sent the second OC back with the return label from your web site, be sure to re-imburse my American Express asap.

Thanks",1169251200,,724,4.085106382978723
8135380,5,B000GYI32W,Great buy.  Locally I couldn't find all three seasons in a set and individually they were expensive.  For $40.00 more I got the complete set as oppposed to getting one season. It was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.,1169164800,,221,4.641025641025641

8135382,3,B000GYI32W,I rate The O.C.: The Complete First Season 5 stars. I rate The O.C.: The Complete Second Season 3 stars. I rate The O.C.: The Complete Third Season 1 star. I'm sorry but this show has gone downhill. I don't think that it will make a comeback during the fourth season. It already lost its audience and it is very hard to bring them back. I'm predicting that it will get cancelled during this fourth season...,1162252800,2,407,4.368421052631579
