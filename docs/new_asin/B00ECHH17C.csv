5903083,4,B00ECHH17C,"This PPV is part of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) which each one having a special theme.  This edition revolved around the X-Division as we have past & current wrestlers from the division compete in matches while also showcasing matches & re-living feuds that the division has been known for.  Mike Tenay & Taz did commentary on this show (and took plenty of shots at their then-commentary partner Todd Kenneley) while also showing highlight videos throughout the night of the Top 10 X-Division Moments along with looking at the Ultimate X Match & the most unique moves in the history of the division.

Xscape Match: Christian York vs. Matt Bentley vs. Alex Silva vs. Sam Shaw vs. Lance Dorado vs. Puma vs. Jimmy Rave - For those who have never seen an Xscape Match before (it's been a few years since TNA did one), it's a multi-man steel cage match held under elimination rules (pinfall or submission) until it comes down to the final two participants where then the only way to win is escaping the cage.  This was pretty much a match that remained one on one with the legal men in the ring with some occasional double teaming with everyone getting involved at one point & the steel cage not coming into play until it was down the final two with multiple fights at the top of the cage.  This was a fun match to kick off the show.

Tony Nese & Rashad Cameron vs. Douglas Williams & Kid Kash - ""New School vs. Old School"" was the tag line here with two veterans of the division against two of the newer competitors as Williams started off with mat wrestling working over the ankle & applying moves like the grounded surfboard while Kash was delivering kicks but their opponents decided to go aerial as Cameron did a flip dive to the outside followed by Nese doing one of his own along with also delivering a springboard crossbody as both teams traded momentum back & forth with Kash doing his stiff chops & kicks including tossing Cameron by his afro while he responded with some power of his own like a pumphandle powerbomb & high risk like a springboard moonsault & dive over the top rope resulting in a solid match.

Chavo Guerrero vs. Robbie E - We had a verbal exchange before the match where Chavo made the point of how the X-Division style evolved from lucha libre style that his family is known with the special referee being the brother of a former X-Division champion in Joseph Park.  This was pretty much just an entertaining comedy match as Robbie E was more focused on Park throughout the match making for such moments as going for a running crossbody only for Chavo to move & Joseph to catch & drop him.

Ultimate X Match: Kenny King vs. Mason Andrews vs. Rubix vs. Zema Ion - The signature match of the X-Division was full of various highlights such as Andrews' twisting crossbody, one man being falling off the cables into an atomic drop, one man being superplexed off another man's back, a franensteiner coming down from the cables, a twisting corkscrew off the top to the floor, a crossbody onto everyone on the floor, one man sacrificing himself, and a very unique ending.  Ultimate X is usually an atheltic contest & this was no exception.

Sonjay Dutt & Petey Williams vs. Bad Influence - This started out with Sonjay & Petey taking control with double teaming including dual sharpshooter & octopus submissions along with various head scissors coming off the top rope & over the top but Daniels & Kaz took control by isolating one member of a team & working him over with double teaming while distracting the referee as both teams went back & forth trading momentum in what was a good tag match.

No Disqualification Match: Rob Van Dam vs. Jerry Lynn - This was setup to be the final encounter between these two as part of Jerry Lynn's retirement tour with both men showcasing their knowledge of each other early with various stalemates before each man caught the other with a move that sent the other to the outside such as Lynn's clothesline or RVD's twisting leg kick.  Both men traded momentum such as RVD catching Lynn attempting a suicide dive with a kick & spinning legdrop off the guardrail, Lynn delivering a legdrop to RVD's head through the ropes & a crossbody sending both men over the top ropes, and a top rope frankensteiner & running dropkick by Lynn before RVD responded with a spin kick.  Weapons from their past encounters came heavily into play as the match went on such as a monkeyflip countered into a powerbomb launching one across the ring onto a chair, a surfboard chair attempt ending with a spear through a table, a suplex onto the chair, a top rope splash missed onto a chair, a missed spin kick countered into a legdrop onto the chair only for the spin kick to be hit later on causing a fall off the top rope through an outside table.  You can't expect the same standard of matches they delivered 15 years ago today but this came close as this was fun with them revisiting some of the more classic spots & moments from their ECW series but stay tuned afterwords as Lynn received a respectful farewell from the TNA roster afterwords.

Samoa Joe vs. Austin Aries - Two of the most dominate wrestlers in the history of the division met up here with Mike Tenay mentioning the fact that Joe's run as the longest reigning ROH Champion in company history was ended by Aries.  Both men were evenly matched early on before Joe caught the advantage with a splash & kick in the corner followed by a series of slaps & chops until Aries was in the front row but Aries was able to catch Joe off guard attacking his leg with dropkicks, dropping his weight across the leg in various ways, dragon screw leg whip, and a figure four which effected Joe throughout the match.  they traded momentum back & forth with such offense as a clothesline that turned the other inside out, a powerbomb into an STF, and crifix drop.  This was a very competitive match between both men.

This event was very similar to the Destination X events of the past where the younger & more athletic competitors took center stage here providing such a good wrestling show from top to bottom that I recommend checking out.",1376265600,2,6250,4.568364611260054

8603845,2,B00ECHH17C,"While I absolutely love the X-Division and X-Division themed shows sadly this one does not deliver. The concept is a TNA guy vs. a Non-TNA guy, and for every Non-TNA guy that wins advances into an Ultimate X main event. It's just puzzling promoting wrestlers that are not in the company. There's also a couple matches that look fantastic on paper but failed to impress. The Wolves vs. Bad Influence Ladder Match couls have been good but the crowd was dead for this match (and most of this show) and killed a lackluster ladder match. Aries vs. Sanada is a basic 10-minute match that wasn't anything special. I suggest watching their match on the Global Impact Japan 2014 DVD instead. Don't even bother with this one, XTravaganza 2013 was a million times better.",1428105600,,760,4.7218045112781954
8603846,3,B00ECHH17C,"The Low Ki-Chris Sabin match was fine but better off on Xplosion then on PPV. The Rashad Cameron-DJ Zema match was not great but solid. The Jigsaw-Kenny King match was so-so at best. The Ace Vedder-Manik match was also solid at best. The Sonjay Dutt-Rockstar Spud match was a bad comedy bout. The Petey Williams-Tigre Uno match was not good with a odd finish to boot. The The Wolves (Davey Richards & Eddie Eddie Edwards Edwards)-Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels & Kazarian)-Ladder Match while still good,they shouldn't have play it safe. The 2/3 falls match for the X-Division title between Sanada & Austin Aries was also good but I wish they could have gone longer. The Ultimate X Match(Low Ki vs. Ace Vedder vs. Rashad Cameron vs. Sonjay Dutt) was like the ladder,good but they shouldn't have play it safe too. I give this PPV 6 out of 10.",1426377600,,844,4.70945945945946
8603847,3,B00ECHH17C,"This PPV is part of the second season of the ""TNA: One Night Only"" series which are just stand alone PPV events (shows that occur outside the current storylines & happenings on IMPACT Wrestling) with each one having a special theme with this season being more recently taped than the previous season so it reflects the talents current gimmicks & feuds.  The second edition of ""X-Division Xtrazaganza"" was the theme of this event based around six independent X Division wrestlers (at the time of this taping) facing off against members of the X Division roster with the stipulation that they would advance to the Ultimate X match later in the night where the winner of that match receiving a future X Division Championship match as Mike Tenay & Jeremy Borash did commentary on this show & various past X Division highlights were shown throughout the event.  This would be a rare appearance for some of these wrestlers for TNA wrestling so had their names changed for copyright reasons but I'll reference the names they are better known as well in other promotions.

Low-Ki vs. Chris Sabin - Sabin attempted to avoid Low-Ki early & kept going to the floor whenever Ki was able to get a hit on him before Ki was able to catch & work him over in the corners only for Sabin to work over the midsection in various ways using the ropes or an abdominal stretch or grounding him with Ki continuing to come back using his various style of kicks.  Good back & forth match in what ultimately turned out to be the final TNA performance of Chris Sabin.

Rashad Cameron (BLK Jeez/Sabian) vs. DJ Zema Ion - Both men tried to take advantage of their opponents unique hair style along with mocking each other in other ways causing Mike Tenay of all people to do a reference to Questlove of The Roots as DJZ was able to gain the advantage working over the throat area using the ring ropes & grounding him on the mat while Rashad worked a more athletic style going over the top rope & other offense like a running head scissors takeover in a short but solid match.

Rubix (Jigsaw) vs. Kenny King - This match started very fast with Rubix constantly catching & reversing King's offense into various pin & submission attempts before King was able to slow the pace down working over Rubix in & outside of the ring as Rubix continued to attempt past face high risk maneuvers as the match eventually came down to one man using his opponents strategy again him.

Ace Vetter (Trent Barretta) vs. Manic - Manic was very dominate early on with head scissor takeovers & offense from a springboard position while Ace was more focused on grounding him with stretches & impactful offense focusing on the head & neck area in a short match that went back & forth between both men.

Sonjay Dutt vs. Rockstar Spud - Dutt was very dominate in the beginning catching Spud off guard with his fast pace offense causing Spud to lose his temper & take it out on the referee on more than one occassion before Spud was able to catch Dutt but not able to follow up on so many occasions leaving an opening for Dutt to recover & regain momentum with some aerial offense.

Petey Williams vs. Tigre Uno - Both men started out intense causing one man's nose to bleed within the opening minute as Tigre went fast pace with his offense along with going aerial while Petey focused on Tigre's leg with stretches along with his own strength to ground Tigre.

EC3 $20,000 Invitational Ladder Match: The Wolves vs. Bad Influence - Ethan Carter III put up his own money to the winner of this match as both teams started out double teaming each other in the opening moments along with using the steps on the outside before the ladders came into play leading to some highlights such as a double suicide dive blocked with a ladder, all four climbing up & knocked off the ladders together, dives onto their opponents laying on the ladder, dropkicks & double foot stomps onto the ladder, and some unique double team offense knocking their opponents off the ladder in a match that lived up to the expectations of both teams with a special presentation afterwords as it should also be noted as well that this was Daniels' last match with TNA (again).

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: X Division Champion Sanada vs. Austin Aries - This was Aries rematch from the previous ""One Night Only"" event from Japan as both of them were evenly match starting out outsmarting each other before Sanada was able to get ahead catching Aries & staying a step ahead before Aries was able to take advantage of an opening working over Sanada with various submissions as they traded momentum picking up the pace showcasing their athleticism & aerial offense in an evenly matched encounter from start to finish.

Ultimate X Match: Low-Ki vs. Sonjay Dutt vs. Rashad Cameron vs. Ace Vetter - All of the non-roster stars who won their matches earlier met here with the winner getting a future X-Division Championship match as the signature match of the X-Division was full of various highlights such as one man trying to grab the X off a backdrop, another being tossed inside out from the top rope, an innovative head scissors takeover piledriver, a full force dropkick that launched his opponent back into the corner, and a fight on the structure above the Ultimate X ropes that included a camel clutch submission in what was wasn't the ""highspots/car crash/highlight reel"" type of match that this is known for but still a good four way match.

I always enjoy the events where X-Division is allowed to be heavily showcased & this is no exception as it was an overall good show but with only few matches coming off as fillers & underwhelming but in the end, I still recommend for fans of his concept.",1424390400,,5702,4.605911330049261
8603848,5,B00ECHH17C,"The ""One Night Only"" series doesn't have title matches and are not in continuity with TNA's storylines, these events I'd say are more for fun, and this is one of them. X-Travaganza is another X-Division themed show. If you're looking for another good All X-Division show to watch, this will give you your fix.

A lot of these matches really deliver. Xscape and Ultimate X is great, and has a great RVD/Jerry Lynn match (which was the last time they wrestled each other in TNA). And the main event isn't bad. Try to get these One Night Only dvds a lil cheaper but this dvd is pretty good",1404432000,,586,4.425925925925926
8603849,4,B00ECHH17C,"The 7 way Xsacpe Cage match(Christian York vs Matt Bentley vs Alex Silva vs Sam Shaw vs Lince Dorado vs Puma vs Jimmy Rave) while not bad,it suffered from too many people in the ring at the same time and didn't flow well because of it. The Tony Nese/Rasad Cameron-Douglas Williams/Kid Kash tag team match was solid and more entertaining then the opener. The Robbie E-Chavo Guerrero match was not good. The 4 way Ultimate X match(Mason Andrews vs Rubix vs Zema Ino vs Kenny King) was a high-flying fun-fest. The Bad Influence(Kazarian & Christopher Daniels)-Petey Williams/Sonjay Dutt tag team match was not great but still fun to watch. The NO-DQ match between Rob Van Dam & Jerry Lynn was slow and sloppy but still a good bout none the less. The Samoa Joe-Austin Aries match was a high-flying,hard-hitting,entertaining main event. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1378512000,,862,4.753333333333333
