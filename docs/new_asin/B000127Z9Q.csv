1966498,4,B000127Z9Q,"Killer Abs and Back is a program which focuses on strengthening the core area of the body, namely your abdominals and back.  Instructor Michael Olajide begins with a few minutes of some simple stretches (these days, it is usually considered a no-no to stretch the muscles without first warming them up).  The cardio warm-up comes next, which consists of several minutes of high-impact moves wuch as jogs, knee-ups, and jumping jacks; I found myself modifying with marches here.  Michael then moves into the core cardio work, which was thankfully low-impact.  The moves are deceptively easy-looking:  there are a lot of kickboxing-type moves such as twists, knee lifts, and punches, but they are performed at such a fast past as to make them quite challenging.  Furthermore, Michael adds light dumbbells to some of the twists, which further increases the difficulty level; I found myself doing some of the moves at a slower pace rather than trying to keep up with Michael's double and triple time.  At one point, a body bar is used for balance, but you could easily go without.  This section of the standing work was about 18 minutes long, and the time went by very quickly.  To finish off the cardio, there is a short (4 minutes) but intense jumprope segment.  I did this section without the rope, but I still really felt it, especially because you're again doing high-impact moves.  Before moving to the floor, I liked that Michael took just a few minutes to allow the heart rate to slowly lower back to normal.

In the 13-minute floor segment, Michael continues to combine traditional exercises with more unique moves.  He begins with some basic crunches but does several variations with a high number of repetitions (usually 32, but he sometimes cheats and adds extra!).  Michael adds ankle weights for just a single exercise (which I found to be a bit cumbersome):  it's sort of like a Pilates teaser move in which you raise and lower one leg and then come up into a v-sit position; he then does a full v-sit move similar to a full Pilates teaser.  The floor work finishes with a particularly difficult move in which you lie flat (supporting yourself with your hands under your buttocks), raise your head and shoulders, lower your legs to close to the floor, and then move your legs up and down in small range of motion.  This was VERY challenging, especially since Michael performs MANY repetitions; I had to take breaks and substitute Pilates toe taps instead.  Michael ends the program with a few minutes of seated stretches, bringing the entire workout in at about 40 minutes.

Overall, I really enjoyed this workout:  I thought it was a nice blend of cardio and toning work, and at just 40 minutes, I know I'll be able to fit it in often.  Although there didn't seem to be much work specific to the back, I felt it in my lats the next day as well as deep in my abdominal area.  One thing I did not like is the way that Michael kept taking breaks from doing the exercises himself in order to instruct his two female background exercisers; he makes jokes about doing this, but I would have preferred to be able to watch him working the entire time.  However, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this video to anyone looking for some unique core work.",1116460800,27,3254,4.690140845070423

1966500,5,B000127Z9Q,"My only complaint (a compliment in disguise) is that the standing boxing session is not long enough. But I guarantee you, your whole body will feel the workout afterward. I tell you, there is no drug like adrenaline -- and this video will deliver the perfect dosage to get the day started or to help shrug off the unwanted stress in life at night time. Thank you Michael -- I look forward to a more challenging sequel to your series.",1109030400,11,433,4.425
1966501,2,B000127Z9Q,"seems like this video could be useful, but the trainer is terrible at working the camera and makes you feel uncomfortable watching it, yet alone trying to work out to it....some of the moves were cool, but all in all i will trade this in for something else.",1094688000,4,257,4.375
1966502,4,B000127Z9Q,"I bought this DVD thinking this was finally the workout I needed to get rid of my potbelly.  I have tried ALL THE AB workout DVD's.  Although I thought it was somewhat effective, it is not the best.  Swiss Ball ABs is a much better DVD with very difficult exercises... that will give you killer abs.  I don't believe I could get killer abs doing this DVD.  The cardio part of this video will raise your heart rate, and I thought it was actually better than the floor work routine.  You need a body bar and such for this part (but you can definitely just do without it--it's just for stability).  ALso, I didn't have a jump rope but you only use it for like a minute or so.  Ankle weights are optional on one of the ab exercises.  Overall, not a bad purchase.",1087430400,13,758,4.208333333333333
1966503,5,B000127Z9Q,"I have all of your workouts and love them all.  I have to be honest.  I think this one is your best. I think it was mainly due to the standing ab work and the music.  Good music is really important to me.  It keeps me pumped to continue a particularly tough workout.  I'd love to see you come out with a circuit routine that has intervals of boxing, jumprope, and standing ab exercises.  I can't wait to see what you come up with next.",1082851200,6,435,4.0588235294117645
1966504,5,B000127Z9Q,"I won't deny, this is a great workout, great abs sections and aerobics/jumping sections.
What I like about this workout is that it mixes tae bo type moves (such as twists and knee lifts) with some pilates moves, which makes the abs sections even tougher! and it is what I usually do: tae bo and pilates!
Overall a great workout for the abs!!
I would also encourage people to check out the Tae Bo  ""ultimate abs"" video and the mtv pilates dvd. Both amazing abs workouts!!",1081382400,20,470,4.465116279069767
1966505,4,B000127Z9Q,"Michael is a total sweetheart (and gorgeous, which never hurts!), very motivating and as a previous reviewer pointed out, not at all irritating; it is a great pity, therefore, that the sound quality used on his voice occasionally muffled his instructions.  The music gets you pumped, though, including the amusing line, ""I can't make the eight count"" - and we all know how THAT feels!  This tough programme is NOT for beginners; apart from anything else, you absolutely need to know something of form (and preferably of Pilates) to do this safely, as very little is explained, especially in the standing sections.  But I'm not a beginner, and I loved it, especially the fact that it contained some really different moves, which - as a daily home exerciser - I need to keep me interested.  The box tells you that you will need very light handweights (2-3 pounds), a body bar, a jump rope; it sneakily doesn't tell you that you will need ankle weights, although you will.  In my opinion, you could easily do this without a body bar; I have one and used it, but it was really just for balance and you could use a chair.  It's the skipping rope I have a problem with: unless you are lucky enough to have a basement or garage to work out in, or you live in a house with enormously high ceilings and no carpet or furniture, I can't see how you could use one indoors.  What I did was to do the exercises miming the rope, aerobic style; probably some of the benefit is lost doing that, but not I think a significant amount.  A similar modification ought to have been shown.  Overall, I liked this product a lot, and believe it will be a useful addition to my training programme, but I would say approach with some care.",1081382400,11,1711,4.47588424437299

1966507,5,B000127Z9Q,Killer Abs and Back is a very professional workout dvd which I recommend very much indeed.,1236988800,,90,4.6875
1966508,5,B000127Z9Q,I have a bad back that only feels better when I excersize it. This was the BEST workout routine I've ever done. It was just enough excersize to make things feel right but not too much to do any damage. (I was really dissapointed to not find more stuff from Michael Olajide),1235692800,,273,4.269230769230769
1966509,5,B000127Z9Q,i bought this dvd and i love it.  in a matter of two weeks i saw results.  my friends even noticed. yes you need a few extra things with the dvd. but is well worth the money. i am a marathon runner and i found that this dvd even improved my endurance. give it a try.,1228867200,2,266,3.732142857142857
1966510,4,B000127Z9Q,"This is truly an effective abs and entire body workout. Unlike the popular boxing workout videos currently circulating with the incredibly in your face and militant instructor howling out instructions at you, Michael Olajide is gentle and soft-spoken when giving direction.

This workout, as well as the one Michael Olajide did with Kathy Smith, also gave me an entirely new respect for boxing. With the amount of coordination, cardiovascular strength, and agility required for these exercises, boxing must be one of the toughest, if not the most tough, sport out there. His gentle voice also made me realize that you do not have to be angry in order to work at boxing as a sport. It requires a focussed type of training to participate in this sport.",1225324800,5,750,4.905511811023622
1966511,5,B000127Z9Q,"I have a lot of home workout DVD's.  I own the Michael Olajide Everlast series but did not realize that this killer abs and back routine existed.  I did not hesitate to buy this when I found it and I am not sorry I did.  I am shocked that there are any negative reviews about this workout.  I love that in only 45 minutes I can work all aspects of my core without only doing crunches.  Michael takes you through some more unconventional moves that really target all aspects of the core.  If you think your not working your core-which includes your lower back you'd be wrong.  This is an ab circut training workout in disguise.  You start off with a traditional warm up and then move on to some kick box moves with light hand weights (Michael does not disclose how heavy his weights are but they look like 3 lbs-the gal behind him looks like she's using 1 lbs).  The weight needs to be light so you don't compromise form.  Then there is some standing ab work and then a jump rope cardio burst.  If you want the full effect of the cardio burst I suggest you buy the $10 jump rope and start jumping.  There is a reason that boxers use jump rope as a major excerise for cardio.  It works EVERYTHING and gets your heart pumping.  It is NOT the same thing to just jump in place but you will still get a workout doing that.  Then he takes you to the floor for some ab work.  Get ready to work that lower ab problem area.  They get NO down time.  He then concludes with a stretch.  As far as his teaching style for someone with such an impressive resume I have to say I love it.  It is no nonsense and very personable.  He portrays himself as just someone working out to have a good time.  To the reviewer who preferred Billy Blanks, well, comparing the two are like apples and oranges.  I do not like Billy Blanks workouts, and yes I have a few.  The constant counting and the constant stopping to put his face in the camera is extremely annoying.  Michael does stop to talk about form but it is not to the point of annoyance.  For the most part he finishes the workout with you and his form is just like perfection.  I can't say enough positive things about this DVD.  If you really concentrate, hold your core in and work hard you will strengthen your abs doing non conventional fun excerises that can keep you motivated.  I am so pleased with this workout!!!  I really hope that he comes out with more!!!",1221004800,7,2400,4.25720620842572
1966512,4,B000127Z9Q,"When I bought this, I wanted something specifically designed to stregthen my abs (as a wannabe dancer, this is the most important muscle group to keep strong) and I wanted slightly different moves that the traditional cruches you see in so many DVDs.

The DVDs greatest strength is in the first half, when powerful, quick moves tone my ""core"" in a way that traditional crunches can't. While crunches and isometric exercises will definitely get me strong, adding quick, powerful boxing-based moves add necessary variety to my workout. The combination of cardio and strenth based manuevers are fun and can be very intense!

The second half is somewhat more traditional, yet I learned some new moves I had never seen before.

Another strenght is the length of the DVD. 40 minutes is enough time to achieve a burn, but not so much time that I need to carve out an incredible chunk of time to do it. The DVD has achieved longevity in my collection; after a couple of years I still like to do it once a week or so along with my other workouts.

Simply put, this workout is practical. It may not be as innovative as other creative workouts, but it achieves what it sets out to do with a bit of creativity. The cueing may be off in some parts due to the fact that the audio is added to the DVD in post-production (come on! you should know that!) which isn't the instructor's fault. It's really easy to make up for on your own if you can count to 8 with relative ease.

I definitely reccomend this video if you need a solid, challenging workout for your abs that is different from just doing a set of crunches and works out your abs in a variety of ways.",1202774400,8,1645,4.433774834437086
1966513,4,B000127Z9Q,"Committing to this work out produces results in 2 weeks ( 3-4x/wk).  It burns! I like most of the segments except the jump rope section.

The routines feels very long because Michael's  repetitions and he often extends the last count.

The core ingredients are :core twists, cardio and mat exercises. It's nice to use this to guide you. I don't mind his flirting with one his back ups. The music is also pumping. Sure, killer but not so much of back.

Still effective anyway.

Bonus: Finish off 10 minute of butt work. Donkey kicks that will make you collapse.

1966514,5,B000127Z9Q,"I disagree with reviewers who claim that the back is not exercised in this video. I am in very good shape, but my lower back muscles were soar from all of the twists. This is great, because these are precisely the muscles I need to strengthen to prevent lower back injuries.

This was well-cued. I wore a heart rate monitor and my numbers were consistently between 120 and 150 during the first part, which is a kind of cardio-circuit training.

There's no need to purchase equipment, but having at least a three pound weight is useful for the side twists.

Fun workout. I also enjoyed Michael on Kathy's Aerobox workout, which is only available on VHS. I'm glad to see this new workout on DVD.",1148688000,9,693,4.528
1966515,1,B000127Z9Q,"I purchased this DVD assuming there would be exercises for both the back and abs areas.  The focus is on the abs, where the back comes into play.  But there are no exercises designed just to targot the back.  In fact, Michael barely mentions much about the back except when talking about good form.  A good cardio workout, alot of jumping in the first segment- you will feel your calves burn.  A good abs and waist workout as well.  There are alot of twisting moves.  The exercises are very similar to tae-bo, and I would recommend a tae-bo video over this one.  Michael only performs half of the exercises himself.  He also seems to favor one girl over the other through his attention.  I wouldn't go through this workout though, and think that it was designed by somebody who had years of boxing experience.

He also uses handweights, a jump-rope, and a body bar during the workout.  But its easy to manage without them.",1146528000,11,922,4.554878048780488

8005404,5,B000127Z9Q,"I love boxing and wanted to add some boxing DVDs to my collection so I don't have to go to class all the time. I don't have a heavy bag at home, so I wanted something that didn't require a lot of space and equipment (speed bag, heavy bag, etc.). So far I've been doing 10 Minute Solution Kickboxing with weighted gloves which has been great.

I bought this DVD and a Guillermo Gomez one about a week or so ago and they arrived yesterday. I was surprised to see Alicia Marie as one of the girls demonstrating the exercises! She is one of my favorite fitness models and it was awesome to see her in this DVD. The workout is exactly what I was looking for and a pretty traditional boxing workout - lots of punching, jumping rope, and ab work. The punching combos were simple, which is great for me because I am choreographically challenged. The counting is a little lax, but I didn't care because in boxing you don't really count anyway - you go by 3 minute rounds and you just go-go-go during that time. You don't count, nor do you have the breath to do it. ;P

Equipment used:
Hand weights
Body bar (something I've never seen before - it's a black pipe that looks about 2"" in diameter and about 4' tall)
Exercise mat
Jump rope

You could manage without this equipment if you had to. For hand weights, you can use filled water bottles, or wear weighted gloves. For the body bar, get a rigid, sturdy 4' pipe at the hardware store. You can use a towel instead of an exercise mat, or nothing at all. For the jump rope, just move your forearms and hands like you're using a jump rope (plus, you can wear hand weights for more resistance).

8005405,5,B000127Z9Q,"I really enjoyed this workout--in that love/hate sort of way. Michael has an incredible vibe throughout the video, very informative and upbeat but not corny (we've all witnessed corny when it comes to workout dvd's). The exercises were certainly affective and you didn't need anything outside of a pair of ankle weights (most wrist weights are also ankle weights) however, the video could have been completed just the same w/o them. Also, and a very big plus, the women in the workout video did not have those cheesy smiles while working out! This really gives the feel of actually working out and a much needed feeling of cohesion as opposed to most all other videos where you're wondering ""how in the hell are they smiling...and more importantly, why?"" The music was good too which is a big plus, and the background was likely in some sort of gymnasium. I thought it was great, authentic, and it didn't feel marketed.

It has been difficult to find something that I can really get into since I stopped running.  I therefore allowed myself to become overweight and flabby.  I exercise intermittently without passion.
