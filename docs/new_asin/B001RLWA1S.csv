8338206,5,B001RLWA1S,"My son was saying (now 3) Bakugon before any of us ever heard of it, he was the first to fall in love with it.  Although, it took us about a month to figure out what he was saying (whats Ba-U-On?).  He isn't the type to get hooked on cartoons and is easily board of the same one, but we have watched Bakugan many times and he still enjoys it at times.  Bakugon is a card game where the kids throw down gate cards and activate Dragons (or other beings) and have them brawl.  The loser loses their Bakugon for the rest of the game, until a bad player comes along and sends the Bakugons to the Doom Dimension (remember the glass/realm superman was sent too?) forever.",1253145600,,664,4.2047244094488185
