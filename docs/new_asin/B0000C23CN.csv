Nor is it simply a matter of good writing, acting or illustration, although there is plenty of that.  Instead it comes from the unique interpersonal relationships that the four characters have with each other, and the internal aspects that makes this a story about some very human demons.
The first story developed on this DVD is a single episode in which Sanzo, Goku, Gojyo and Hakai find themselves in a painful conflict with a group of women who have been seized by a parasite demon.  The only release is death, and the tragedy has a strong effect on all of them, especially Goku.
The second story takes up the three remaining episodes.  Sanzo discovers that a Scorpion demon has eaten another priest and is terrorizing a village sets out for the desert to settle the problem.  Even though the initial problem is cleared up, it leaves Sanzo dying of poison and the rest of the team frantic to find a way to help him.  When Kougaji shows up intending to take one of the holy scriptures, a battle breaks out, and we finally see Goku's underlying personality.  The endless banter between him and Gojyo has kept us from understanding what the Monkey God really is about, and this story reminds us that circumstances are rarely what they seem.
Both of these episodes crystallize the deep friendship that exists between these men.  Why this is unusual is that anime has traditionally fallen into a `pretty boy' model when examining male relationships, and Saiyuki does nothing of the sort.  What happens here is male bonding without any overtones, and it provides an excellent backdrop against which their individual stories and adventures can take place.  This makes the series much more than a series of legendary tales with comic overtones.  If you take the time to view a few episodes I'm confident you will agree.",1069027200,10,1993,4.744927536231884
