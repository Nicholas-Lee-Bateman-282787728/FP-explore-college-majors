2725079,5,B000M53GNQ,"This is a great movie, but if you are averse to full frontal nudity of both sexes not in sexual acts or homosexual relationships also not in sexual acts it is not for you.

It is hilarious the basic plot is about 2 wedding planners who have to arrange weddings for 3 couples who win a magazine contest for a theme wedding on a budget.

Addendum. I did not mean in any way that gay relationships are funny.  The relationship is touching and sweet.  The funny part is trying to plan the weddings .",1394064000,,495,4.23404255319149

2725095,4,B000M53GNQ,Stumbled upon this midway through on cable and couldn't find a re-run so I rented it.  Hilarious!!  And so many people that you know now but probably didn't when the movie was originally released (unless you're from the UK).,1378598400,,224,4.717948717948718
2725096,4,B000M53GNQ,"I laughed and cringed throughout the movie. I had many favorite scenes and some of them even had people in them! But the best bit was with the dvd, you can pick the winner. And I chose the broadway musical ending. Because it was the least tacky and the love those two had for each other was sincere. The other two couples seemed to ignore love and the reason for getting married in the first place. The diamond in this rough, uncut glass is Martin Freeman singing and dancing. You can't miss that!",1376438400,,497,4.354838709677419
2725097,4,B000M53GNQ,"""Confetti"" is a charming romp - as light as spun sugar! This film is an absolute delight and I recommend it most highly - its sweet enough to thrill - but it's humor possesses a dry and sometimes dark edge.",1369094400,,206,4.175
2725098,4,B000M53GNQ,"If you are a fan of the Christopher Guest movies this film will be right up your alley! It takes place in Britain and is filmed in that mockumentary style like ""Best in Show"" or ""This is Spinal Tap"". The whole thing is funny from beginning to end and will have you invested in the characters by the end of the film. The great thing about this movie is it has a little something for everyone in it; some nudity, some rock and roll, love stories, a big musical number and even a fight scene which was so funny it took me and my husband 10 minutes to continue watching the film because we were rolling on the floor laughing that whole time. The plot of the film is about a ""most original"" wedding contest, because of this there's the awkward situations that arise between family, friends, and in-laws which are so true to life you'll probably see a little of your own family and friends reflected in the characters. the whole thing is written in such a clever and amusing way and I know I'll watch it many more times.",1365897600,,1014,4.31413612565445

2725101,3,B000M53GNQ,"This movie is about a magazine contest that will throw a wedding for the three best ideas for your not so average wedding. Basically themed weddings. The wedding themes that win are a tennis themed wedding, a nudist themed wedding,and a musical wedding.

I liked the three themes that were picked, that is why we purchased this film. I also found it interesting that you can view the wedding that you would have liked to see win, instead of the default ending.

I am not sure if you would call this a romance film or a comedy, but I think most film buffs will enjoy the movie, especially the ability to choose the winner. There is some nudity, but this was a UK made film and they do not seemed to be as hung up on nudity like the U.S.",1361404800,,735,4.242857142857143

2725104,3,B000M53GNQ,"A silly British mockumentary about a reality-TVish competition by a bridal magazine for the Most Inventive Wedding of the Year. It doesn't take advantage of all of its opportunities, but it creates some great characters and is entertaining to the end.",1303516800,,251,5.146341463414634
2725105,4,B000M53GNQ,"I just finished watching the British film, ""Confetti"" and my sides and cheeks are still aching from the laughter and smiles it produced.

The film's style is ""mockumentary"" similar to Best in Show, A Mighty Wind, etc. - and cleverly done.

The premise:  a British bridal magazine selects three couples to have their ""dream"" wedding performed as part of a contest/live reality show, the winning couple getting a new, halfl million pound house.

Couple One:  Josef and Isabelle.  Professional tennis players, he on the way out and she with a flaring nostril problem.  He's an abusive, royal ass with a chip on his shoulder bigger than his brain, and she, the poor dear, a complete disaster.  They want to have a tennis themed wedding with dancing ball boys, giant tennis balls, vows done as serves and volleys and . . . you get the picture.

Couple Two:  Michael and Joanna.  Naturists who want to celebrate their nuptials with their dangly bits on display.  The magazine deeply regrets this selection.  (Note:  there is buttloads of nudity with these two and their naturist community - all nonsexual, but prudish types be forewarned!)

Couple Three:  Matt and Samantha.  A sweet, nudgey-pair wanting an elaborate, 30's Hollywood musical number a la Busby Berkley. She is tone deaf, but loves to sing.  Neither can dance.

All three couples have the same pair of coordinators to make their dreams come true, an exhuberant gay couple who are tested to their limits.

The film goes through the seven weeks (each announced with a nice title card) leading up to the Big Event, culminating in the three weddings and the announcement of the winner.  The ride is bumpy, dark, emotional, hilarious and ultimately, kind of sweet.",1270080000,4,1718,4.895833333333333
2725106,1,B000M53GNQ,"This movie is a  mockumentary like the hit comedy ""Best in Show,"" but that's where the similarity ends.  Creating a truly funny farcical romp is VERY difficult.  It requires walking a fine line between reality and the ridiculous.  ""Confetti"" fails spectacularly in this regard.  The script is often obvious and predictable.  Several of the characters are stereotypical, but the actors don't commit to the stereotype strongly enough.  Instead they come off as lame caricatures.

At times, this movie is painfully boring, dull, or just downright stupid.  The only thing that kept me watching through to the end was a morbid curiosity to see if the whole thing was that bad.  Fortunately, there were a few moments of hilarity, but only enough to prevent me from burning the CD when I took it out of the machine.  Instead, I promptly placed placed it back in the box and took it to the used movie store to sell.

Perhaps my disappointment was due to my expectations based on some of the reviews I read on the Amazon website prior to purchasing this movie.  Please be advised, ""Confetti"" is NOT comparable to ""Best in Show,"" ""Love, Actually"" or any ""Monty Python"" production.  I love a GOOD British comedy and, in my opinion, this film's shortcomings have nothing to do with it being ""British.""  ""Confetti"" is a great concept that failed to deliver.

Some of the blame goes to the director and film editor, but the ""reality"" aspect of this show is the primary culprit.  This is the fault of either allowing the actors to ""ad lib,"" or simply a poor screenplay.  Often the film just drags as characters yammer about nothing in particular.  This film lacks the comedic timing needed to achieve anything beyond ""cute but dumb.""",1246838400,2,1718,4.782312925170068
2725107,5,B000M53GNQ,"One of the most clever comedies in recent years and at the same time, one of the most genuine romantic movies (it is both real and lacks unnaturally sappy sentiment).

Very funny movie, hugely enjoyable!",1221523200,,203,4.8
2725108,2,B000M53GNQ,"I watched this movie on television and am very happy I didn't spend money to see it.  While I enjoy some British humor, its not my favorite.  If you enjoy Monte Python and modern British humor I'm betting that you'll enjoy the humor in this movie.  However, be aware that there is full-frontal nudity of men and women.  The wedding capers remind me of the show ""Who's Wedding Is It Anyway?"", with all the melodrama of families who want a nice wedding for their child, trying to forget that the wedding is a competition for the most unusual.",1201910400,,540,4.479591836734694
2725109,4,B000M53GNQ,"Saw this in the cinema - had no idea what it was about, and went with no expectations - but it really made me laugh! The premise is that a wedding magazine are running a competition for the most original wedding, and this mockumentary focuses on three very different couples in the run-up to their big day. Characters are excellent and dialogue very natural - probably because most of the script was ad-libbed by the actors, based around a general outline for each scene. Light-hearted and fun, perfect for an evening when you want entertainment without too much thought involved!",1196294400,,580,4.81
2725110,5,B000M53GNQ,"This British-made and very comic mockumentary portrays the conflicts and potential mayhem inherent in the run-up to any wedding and multiplies it by not three but about ten, as a wedding magazine launches a self-promoting competition among three couples for the most unusual marriage ceremony.

Here everyone is at loggerheads, including the editors of the magazine, and the pair of wedding planners who attempt to pull it all off with a paltry budget and the less than enthusiastic cooperation of all involved. Very much in the spirit of Christopher Guest's ""Waiting for Guffman,"" which helped create the genre, this hugely enjoyable film eventually sweeps all promise of disaster aside and ends triumphantly with all the excitement of - well, a Busby Berkeley musical.

The DVD has at least a half hour of additional scenes as entertaining as the rest of the movie. There are also three alternative endings, plus filmographies of much of the cast. Look for Martin Freeman, from BBC's ""The Office,"" as one of the beleaguered bridegrooms.",1182211200,7,1038,5.136094674556213

You could call us ""Guesties"" (Best in Show is my all time pick-me-up) and after the disappointment of ""For Your Consideration"" I have been looking for a mockumentary that I could really get a belly laugh from. ""Confetti"" delivered and then some. I love the british accents and enjoy listening to the words in a movie...not just being played down to by cheap jokes.
