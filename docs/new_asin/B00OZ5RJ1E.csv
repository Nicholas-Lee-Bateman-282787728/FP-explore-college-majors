6777341,5,B00OZ5RJ1E,"This film ranks in my top 10 films of all time.  Maybe I'm bias because I have been waiting long and quietly for this story to come to light, maybe it's because Alix Lambert is a wonderful director who saw something for what it was, and didn't get caught up in the facade that is the city of Mentor Ohio.
I grew up in this town... graduated from Mentor High School in 2005, and ran as fast as I could to escape that place.  NOW - I will mention this because I love my family and I love my friends, there ARE good people in Mentor Ohio, they are just really hard to find.  Usually the good people in Mentor are driven out or treated poorly by the community because they do not follow the ""norms"".  I don't know if you could say there are ""bad"" people in Mentor, because I believe that everyone has good inside them.  BUT - I will say there are people in Mentor, families who are teaching their kids to be actively racist, not accepting of things that are ""unchristian"", and most importantly ignorant to the entire world around them.  These morons are less than 10 miles from the inner city of Cleveland and believe that 10 miles makes so much of a difference that they are ""better"" than any other town.  Most kids in mentor aren't even allowed to GO downtown to enjoy the nightlife... because their parents don't want them interacting with other races or classes.
Class warfare is a serious problem in Mentor.  Most people who bully do it for monetary reasons... they tease kids who can't afford to shop at the high end clothing stores and wear hand-me-downs, or the kids who drive used cars, or the kids who have to work for their money.  No one in Mentor is ""Rich"" but you would never know that talking to their children.  Most of those kids are delusional... and it's evident because if you look at census records - you will see that certain families never leave because their nonsensical bulls*** doesn't work anywhere else but Mentor Ohio.
Every community should do what it can to support the youth and teach right from wrong.  Mentor School Systems were 100% negligent... put it this way... they couldn't even handle 911 properly... The day it happened I was in middle school, in my 8th grade home economics class when they made an announcement that a plane had just hit the WTC.  Within 20 minutes almost 70% of the students had been picked up by their parents and those of us left (those of us who's parents couldn't leave work or felt we were safer there than at home alone) were sent into the cafeteria to do homework... while the teachers sat there and watched A LIVE FEED OF THE NEWS.... when I came up to ask if i could call my dad, i saw the LIVE FOOTAGE  of the second plane hitting the building... a teacher actually ""sushed"" me so she could watch it.... now... they all knew i was standing there (at age 13) and not a single teacher turned around to comfort me, or explain what i had just seen... i will probably remember that FOREVER...
The point of the matter is that Mentor Ohio is a terrible place... half the houses are sinking back into the ground because the damn city was built on top of a marsh, and the city is doing NOTHING... my dad is a cancer patient and was forced to clean sewage water and waste out of his basement because of this issue... which could have killed him since he has no immune system...
ANYWAYS - This film is difficult to watch because all of it is TRUTH.... from the words of the families to the words of the victims themselves.... this film is heart wrenching but so important... for the same reasons that movies about slavery and the holocaust are important... because they show us the reality we don't WANT to see and make us understand and change for the better.  I hope that Alix Lambert wins all kinds of awards for this film... she tackled a serious and important subject and to this day is getting a lot of hate mail from the morons of Mentor about her film, but as a former resident of Mentor, I support Alix Lambert in her quest to show us the truth.",1426032000,15,4009,4.3781965006729475

I hope you are able to leave MENTOR an get your education elsewhere, I know this happens in all schools but the educators hopefully are better.  How can they get such high ratings? Everyone lies there!!  People thinking of moving there plz watch this movie...all These people in charge of these kids literally helped kill these kids. I don't know how anyone sleeps well at night!  Funding needs to be cut off until all adults at school are gone an professionals come in an have the school run the right way!  The judges were way wrong!

6777346,5,B00OZ5RJ1E,"Not sure where to begin.  First let me tell you I am wiping my tears after having just read the young lady from Croatia's suicide note.  FIRST and FOREMOST I am utterly DUMBFOUNDED that the JUDGE dismissed this case!!!!  As for the school counselor not having a copy of all of the times this young lady went to her office pleading for help- for this ""creature"" to say that :she did not have copies of the incidents because she shredded them is complete and TOTAL BS.  For all of the cowardly administrators and counselors that declined to be interviewed, I hope all of you have been terminated from your positions.  I also hope - YES I WILL SAY THIS- that either a child of yours or a grandchild of yours commits suicide due to bullying.  ONLY THEN WILL YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THESE POOR PARENTS FEEL.  UGH.  Mentor, Ohio.  Armpit of America.  ""Upper Middle Class""?  I think not.  I grew up in Bethesda, MD.  One of the most expensive suburbs in America.  The students at this ""MONSTER MENTOR HIGH"" would not know what hit them if they had walked into a ""REAL"" upper middle class existence.  I have never heard of this SATANIC AREA until watching this documentary this evening.  I am going to tell everyone I know about this.  I am utterly dumbfounded STILL that the judge ""dismissed and the counselor got away with saying she threw all of the many documented incident reports away.  May all of the adults involved that did not help experience the suicide of someone close to you.  May all of the then children that bullied these poor teenagers to suicide also experience losing a child to suicide.  May sound harsh but I hope this 110%.  ONLY THEN, After experiencing what these poor parents experienced will you ""get it"" and understand the depth of their grief.  Mentor, Ohio- ""Upper Middle Class""...  I'm still chuckling about this.  SATONIC, EVIL, ARMPIT OF AMERICA.  SHAME ON ALL OF YOU THAT THESE POOR CHILDREN WENT TO FOR HELP.  Hopefully you will be able to come back and leave a comment regarding this documentary.  Something like ""I get it now, I buried my grandchild this morning.  He was bullied to death""  .",1514851200,3,2116,4.612903225806452

6777348,4,B00OZ5RJ1E,I really liked this documentary especially as someone who advocates for suicide prevention. We often think of dying by suicide only with mental illness but there are other causes just like bullying. I felt for the families and kids there. I can not believe that students got away with that type of behavior and staff did nothing...I have an undergrad in teaching and will be teaching this year. I can assure you that I will make sure to the best of my ability that this will not take place where I work. I truly hope the families can get justice. I was wondering if a petition for the families could be set up to send to the Dept. of Education on this issue.,1510444800,,658,4.357723577235772

This needs to be shown everywhere, and the faculty of that school should be required to watch it again and again and again.
Most bullies grow up to be selfish adults.  The school did a dis service to the bullies as well, by not correcting them.  The harm that Mentor and schools like it are creating in the world very much outweighs the good....that much is obvious.  Shame on them.
I hope Mentor gets what it deserves.

6777352,5,B00OZ5RJ1E,This is as infuriating as it is heartbreaking.  My heart goes out to these parents.  And to think that even their court cases were dismissed?  Ridiculous.  How about taking the parents of the evil little brats that did the bullying to court?  That would be my next move. This just makes me want to do something!  I think it's a great idea that this should be shown to every middle/high school in the country so they can see the pain and misery that is left behind for these families.  I sincerely hope these bullies are haunted by their actions every night for the rest of their lives!,1506124800,,585,4.411214953271028
6777353,5,B00OZ5RJ1E,"My heart goes to the parents and family of these two kids and all kids that constantly suffer this kind of abuse. Having lived in the states for five years I think the problem is more profound than just some kids that have parents that don't teach good values. Values are being taught all the time by media, games, social media, and the values I see most often portrayed is the importance of winning at all costs, hence the Winner/Looser syndrome, the huge importance given to looks, image and being cool; and finally the free speech at all costs, in other words, the right to say whatever comes to mind with disregard to other people's feelings. I see it all the time in the news, in youtube, so why would we expect a different behavior since the roles models are most often the ladies that blast horrible comments on twitter and the like.",1505520000,,840,4.496732026143791
6777354,4,B00OZ5RJ1E,"I grew up in 30 miles west of Mentor in a small town.  I graduated in 1972.  And the bullying was always there.
In fact a classmate's mother told me of the systematic bullying of their whole family in the 20's and 30's because they were Polish.  The bullying seemed to be the established families against anyone different. Nothing seems to have changed.

I would get off the bus crying so that story in this film was so brought back memories even though I am a senior citizen, successful, happy and living 1200 miles away. And other kids got in my class got it much much worse.
The thing that saved me and others in the 70's, it wasn't as organized as it appears to be now.

You want to know why Ohio has such a drug problem, you could start here.

The reason I gave it only four stars was not for content but for the film technique, too many out of focus shots.  Quartet singing scene is a good example.",1505520000,2,904,4.22093023255814

They may not be held accountable now, however, I do know they will pay a price for the lack of caring, leadership and back bone.

Our special needs daughter has been verbally and physically bullied.  The school was informed and did nothing.  The district won't let her transfer out.  They even told us it was because of the money they'd lose.  There is no help.  There is no empathy.  Our daughter has been called ugly and weird.  She has been spit on, robbed and shoved into lockers - by BOYS.  There is a sickness in this country.

I find it incredulous that the school  system was not taken to task because a person, a so-called judge, denied these families their rights. I hope there is another court that they can try. This school is responsible for the suicides and I have no idea how the school nurse, the security officers, the teachers, the principal, the superintendent, the school board, etc. even sleep at night.",1499558400,4,519,4.831460674157303

6777361,5,B00OZ5RJ1E,"First of all, may these poor victims and families find comfort in their souls. I pray for them and everyone in a situation like this.
Thank you for making and streaming these kinds of materials that shine a light on these horrible issues that exist in our society.

I feel Anger because the town and school officials valued more their ""perfect status"" than the lives of young people in it, which they are vowed to protect. I wonder how many more crimes go under the radar just to protect the reputation of their community. It's so Scary!!!

This film is a great piece of information, even though they share a few good points of action here and there, it doesn't show you how to prevent it. One can't prevent these terrible deaths if the community leaders don't implement laws or actions against bullies. prosecutions are not happening, no one is accounted for it; the bullies and their parents, the authorities and staff that just ignore the constant issues. Is so sad that schools are a matter of survival rather than a place for growing one's mind.

*SPOILERS BELLOW*
The film is about the lives of the kids and the hardships that drove them to end their lives.
The fact that no one other than family and friends of the victims wanted to give interviews is just so irritating!! I think the main suspects are from influential families, only that justifies all the cover ups.
My heart broke reading the letter at the end.

Please, try to help a teen, a tween or a kid. give them hope and show that you care and love them.
Correct those ""mean kids"" you may know, teach them values, be an example.
Be an active SJW, get involved!

I don't know if something like this exists, but I just thought about having a website with a database listing the amount of students suicides on each school. like those sex predators maps. I think that could be a way to hold the communities responsible and I assure you they will try to prevent every single loss.",1498176000,5,1942,4.521367521367521
6777362,5,B00OZ5RJ1E,"Personally, I think this documentary should be shown in EVERY junior high school and high school in America, public and private.  This story is so raw and shows how being unkind to our fellow man is RAMPANT in all aspects of human interaction in the United States and possibly the world.  What I thought was so important in this film, was how the tragedy of these children's deaths affected everyone, especially the families involved. A major wake up call for parents of young adults and teens.  It also exposes how incredibly useless the school was in prevention and disciplining the perpetrators of these bullying characteristics.  It was shocking to hear the immigrant family describe how he and his family survived a war torn country... only to have his child die in the midst of middle class America.  A mandatory must watch film for all over the age of 9 years old.",1493510400,9,871,4.741721854304636

6777364,5,B00OZ5RJ1E,"I grew up in Madison, Ohio about 30 minutes east of Mentor. From the time I was very small it was always very clear that the majority of Mentor residents think they're above everyone else. Whether it's because they tend to have more money or just because they live in a so called affluent area. That was the closest shopping mall so we went there fairly often. Very snooty, rude, condescending people. God help you if you're at all different (poor, foreign, awkward, anything besides caucasian). Their annual carnival is even called ""Better In Mentor Days"". In high school I went to it with a fellow male student who had lived in mentor when he was younger and even so we were harassed by the local ""kids"". It was not a pleasant experience. Definitely not one I ever attempted to repeat. Even their local law enforcement treat ""outsiders"" poorly. Nothing in this documentary really surprised me if I really think about it and dig deep into my memories about Mentor. It did however break my heart into a million pieces, sicken and enrage me. What's even more disgusting and infuriating is that since this documentary was released, yet another judge has dismissed the lawsuits saying there's no evidence that the school district did anything wrong or neglectful!!! SERIOUSLY?!? I'm just going to quit typing while I'm ahead....I have the utmost sympathy for these families who've lost their children and then been slapped in the face and let down by yet another system. I sincerely hope they end up getting justice for themselves and their children. If nothing else, Karma will catch up to those responsible.",1492473600,18,1606,4.843636363636364
6777365,5,B00OZ5RJ1E,"Empathy is nonexistent in Mentor. And I'm sure there are other places like that around America. Places that appear perfect, but with so much darkness below the surface. I can't comprehend how children can choose to be so unbelievably cruel and evil to each other. I don't even want to imagine what kind of kids these bullies will raise! Children need to feel safe at school - yet for those two it was pure hell. God only knows how they must have felt being forced to face that psychological torture every day...
Probably the most shocking thing for me was the reaction of the bullies after the girl died. I was expecting them to be remorseful, to finally realize what they've done...Instead they were looking at her lifeless body lying in the coffin and mocking her!!! HOW CAN A HUMAN BEING DO THAT??! Children are usually considered ""innocent"" - these kids behaved like pure monsters! Shame on them and on their parents! Shame on EVERYONE in the school and the community who knew about this and did nothing. I'm sure some of the other students witnessed what happened, yet barely anyone stood up for those kids. Maybe they, too, were afraid... The parents of the bullies had a responsibility to know what their kids where up to - and I'm sure other parents would've heard about what was going on from their kids. Yet it looks like no one tried to help. I thought that at least after these parents lost their children, that other parents would reach out to them, that they would show some empathy and be supportive - yet they ostracized them further!
You, People of Mentor, who could have done something about this and chose not to: I hope by now you've taken a hard look at yourselves and realized that you're responsible for these kids taking their own lives and for destroying their families. You've got to live with this for the rest of your lives. Judges: you refused to bring justice to these  families who have already been through hell. I don't know how you can sleep at night. My only comfort is in my belief that nothing goes unpunished - whether you're directly responsible or just chose to turn a blind eye, I'm certain that sooner or later each and every person will receive their fair retribution.",1490659200,9,2211,4.611675126903553

I think this is an extremely important topic as it seems there is a growing epidemic of bullying in the US and elsewhere which isn't being dealt with because of favoritism. My heart breaks for the parents of the children in this movie. But I was left with so many questions. Why didn't they give more detail about the bullying? The girl was pushed down stairs by a football player - she went to the school nurse. What were her injuries? Did any other students try to help her when she was pushed? I'm interested in the dynamics of the other students. She repeatedly went to school counselor and school nurse for help but we're only shown documents that we can't read. I think describing in detail what happened to these children is a vital part of telling their story. Second big question: where were the parents of the bullies in all this?? Did anyone try to talk to the bullies' parents? If so, why wasn't this discussed in the movie? If not, then WHY not? Why does the burden always fall on the school to solve behavioral problems and police children? It's not a max security prison. It's a school. The PARENTS should be brought forward to answer for their kids' horrible behavior. I understand the school was complicit in the actions of the bullies by repeatedly doing nothing and treating these upper-middle class brats as a protected group. But MORE MORE MORE could have been done to put pressure on the school and the parents of the bullies. I just can't wrap by head around how a child could get to the point of suicide because no one could protect them. My parents would never, ever, ever have let a bully mess with me. Beyond a normal level of teasing and crap-talking that is par for the course among the youth - they would have encouraged me to sort that out myself. But no way would my parents have allowed anyone to get away with hurting their kids in the manner described in this movie and in other incidences you hear about on the news. The parents of those bullies would absolutely have had a visit from my parents. My parents would go to the police every single day, they would go to the governors mansion, they would go to the local news station, they would make videos and get them going viral, they would create a Facebook page to shame the school and the bullies' parents every single day. They would push and push until the bullying STOPPED. Why aren't parents today fighting for their children? ""The school won't do anything"" seems to be the mantra.

To mtc, that gave this a one star: I will guess that YOU live in Mentor, and this documentary DOES represent your town!  This is NOT saying that bullying just happens in Mentor...It's the shocking FACT how many students in your town have taken their own lives, BECAUSE of your town! Bullies are everywhere, in every state, town, and community. I can't say what I would do, if I were one of those parents, because my comment would be deleted. We shouldn't have to teach our precious children how to ""deal with"" horrific, constant bullying. PARENTS need to teach their children NOT to be a bully. How can the parents of these little terrorists not know? That town is so indifferent, and apathetic, it is beyond disgusting. Is YOUR child a bully? Find out...check their phones, and computers, go on their social media pages....they DON'T have a right to privacy, but as a parent, YOU have the right to find out what is going on in their lives!

6777397,4,B00OZ5RJ1E,"The documentary, itself, was quite simply composed, and it did not rise to the level of a cinematographic masterpiece - as documentaries can.  I don't think that was the story's ambition.  Nonetheless, there were many touching moments where the belated children are shown in home videos, which crystalize the inexplicable nature of their abuse.
As a former teacher, working in some really rough city schools, I'd like to offer three insights, which this film did not drive but underscore its value:
1. Mental health is fragile, and a person of 'sound' mind can become mentally ill depending on what happens to them in the course of their lives.  Not all mental illness is the result of genetics/dna/predisposition. A person need not be particularly fragile; under the improper circumstances, anyone can lose perspective.
2. Educators, just like their students, are prone to bullies -- by parents, by other educators, and by children.  Lots of educators long to be loved,  so it is sometimes difficult to side against those by whom they long to be accepted.
3.  An apellate court has upheld the position that there is insufficient evidence to prosecute the Mentor school system in the case of Sladjana.  I hate that, but for the courts, imagine the overwhelming burden of such a precedent: that courts would need to be responsible for making a determination about whether a school has failed to protect one child from another.  Even if it is not a legal matter, which I question, it is a massive moral failing on the part of all of these educators with the legal obligation of loco parenti.
It is unfortunate that Mentor does not respond in this documentary because I am intensely curious about their position.  My heart breaks for the families in this movie.  It can be hard to determine when to intervene on behalf of a student, but students cannot learn if they are afraid.  Life is not fair, and you cannot change that, but at least you can try to make your classroom a fair place.  A lot of times that means that you, as an educator, have to stand down your own bullies.",1482537600,5,2074,4.762569832402234

6777399,4,B00OZ5RJ1E,"How ironic the city is named Mentor, when it appears that mentors are an endangered, if not extinct, species there.  It also appears that because of the lawsuit, the adults started ostracizing the parents as well, so perhaps the apples are just falling very close to the trees in Mentor.  Of course, Mentor is not the only place where this type of behavior happens, but it is a good example and portrayal of the type of city and environment in which such problems are allowed to develop and fester.  The apathy of the school system was appalling, and it is clear that nothing would shake them out of that except for a lawsuit.  Money talks, and kids don't matter.  The Judge made a bad call, but it is not surprising given that they would have had to file the suit in the same county as the school system.  I hope they find grounds to file a federal suit for violation of civil rights.  At the very least, I hope they yank the license of the counselor and prosecute her for destroying evidence.  It is sickening when you think that every facet of that school system -- administration, counselors, teachers, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, etc. -- had to notice what was going on and did nothing, probably just to keep things comfortable and easy for themselves.  The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.  Edmund Burke.",1481414400,21,1357,4.5473251028806585

8685684,3,B00OZ5RJ1E,"I am so so sorry for their loss, I think it should have shown the entire issue not just theirs if it was meant to make a difference.  That the tragedy is worse because they made it seem unique to a immigrant family, which is far from the truth.  I think it's important to get your kid out first, then work on change t if you want, you aren't going to ever fix the public school system with just your loss, the word public says it all.  Mentor is not special or any worse than any other public school solely by a community by economics, religion, race, origin or location around the world.  Hell most private schools, secondary and boarding schools all have these issues. Children that don't conform to the norm should be treated different they are the stifled and hurt by fear, jealousy and stupidity of so called peers and the adults who raise them.  They do need to have a different form of education,  we don't send our kid to poverty stricken dangerous school when we don't have to, we seperate our families to have our class, prefered community or other  better, we as parents owe a better life to them not the government.  A prom or even friends are not human rights issues, it's a dance,  a like minded person to bond with..  I am not justifying the schools behavior, someone should have helped them get her safe by any means.  I am disappointed no student or their ethic community group stepped up either, or the mental health community.  I think the failure was across the board for Slanjana.  I am saying that we are expecting a underfunded over burdened system to feed our kids, provide day care before and after, provide books and supplies, allow for every religious and cultural craziness, language, interest group, , technology, teach sports and the arts, teach life skills and family planning, monitor drugs, weapons, child abuse, bullies, sexual preference, emotional neglect, provide for the learning disabled, therapy for disenfranchised, entertain them, keep them physically fit, vocationally train, deal with mental health issues, behavior issues, the craziness they learn at home, violence, oh and squeeze in prep for college, and bus your kids around all in an 12-16 hour day for less daily 1/4 the cost of housing a prisoner.  Sounds like a parents job doesn't it.  I would never be in a public school system or recommend it for a primary level, kids are scary parents are horrible.  You have zero to a few kids at home, you don't try to raise 40 with special needs do you? They have more like 100 to 1 ratios, each child with a unique set of issues.  The ""public"" run world is not fair, equal or bully free, what are we teaching our kids that for? We need to teach them how to exist and thrive in an unfair world.  There is never going to be enough done to stop bullying, just look at bullying adults, it is called robbery, stalking, assault, murder, fraud, terrorists, cults, cons, hate crime, racism, classicism, sexism, people are ugly, mean and evil sometimes. Sue the parents of the offending kids, if you are doing it to make a change by making a point, not the system because that only affects those who pay into the system.  I lost two siblings to suicide, many friends and acquaintances too and dealt with children with depression and bullies with kids so I do understand.  I was bullied from elementary school to high school, the only time it stopped was when I was with my sister or cousin to protect me, I quit school because I hated school, complaining about it only made it  worse.  Making a point at the expense of your child's safety is not how we affect change,  not knowing there is a problem yourself doesn't mean lay the blame more on someone else, especially a person who virtually a stranger.  There are more effective ways of changing the system then just a lawsuit which seems to be the first place everyone goes and no one seems to sue the actual offenders!  Oh that's right, they won't pay you as many zero or anything at all.  Protest, lobby, speak to the other parents, volunteer at the school, community involvement, PTA's, School Boards and speaking out raise awareness with your time and effort. And honestly did these or most parents even help other parents of kids being bullied before it affected them so brutally? The truth is no probably.  I found it odd, not to be mean, just odd that Eric's parents did the quartet show thing on the film, it showed me why they didn't notice he was having issues.

There was no confrontation with the actual bullies with names or their parents names.  Just saying a group of girls or a star football player doesnt really tell the story.  Also they are trying to make Mentor out to be an upper middle class wealthy suburb that is mean to poor people when in reality the downtown was run down and full of empty dilipidated buildings and the neighborhoods were homes that were obviously built in the 60s and 70s with no curbs or gutter systems in place.

8685688,5,B00OZ5RJ1E,"First of all, many thanks to the creators of this documentary for having the courage to tackle a very difficult subject. Very well done indeed. Now I get to lash out on the anger that I feel after watching this documentary through to the end. Mentor is a very insecure insignificant suburb on the east side of Cleveland, Ohio built to provide a community for families who held jobs in the once thriving beautiful city of Cleveland. It is to bad that people can't accept people that are somewhat different from the mainstream, but that seemed to be the theme throughout. I found it very interesting when they showed the yearbook that all of the girls on the sports teams looked the same. Same hair, same features. And then you get a beautiful Croatian girl in town who is somewhat different from them and the crowd smells the difference almost like a pack of dog s and do what animals do when they sense a pack member who may be marked or more timid. THis is how I look at the town of Mentor, no better than a pack of inbred mongrel dogs. When I was raising my kids, I saw how parents acted at the various school functions that went on, most of them never grew up themselves, and still acted like they did in high school whispering behind each other's backs, making fun of any child or  family that was different. When I was in High School the only place I felt like I belonged was the Theatre department. The schools make such a big deal out of their sports kids so the sports kids think they can do what they want. Well guess what, all kids do not come from the same mold. If you are a school administrator please use this documentary as a wake up call. Shame on you Mentor for letting such beautiful children down. If you move to the Cleveland area, be careful, you may want to stay on the west side, but even then, there may be some of the same kind d's of issues.",1519689600,4,1867,4.288951841359774

8685690,4,B00OZ5RJ1E,"A sobering recollection of how bullying in public schools can escalate to tragedy outside the walls of the classrooms. These were needless deaths of AMERICAN youth right before their adult lives were going to begin. These families came here to escape the violence in another part of the world, only to lose their children to an American HS experience that turned deadly.

The school system and the state government should be ashamed of how they treated these families and their kids. That is a catch 22 if you recommend the student do home schooling only so the school system can wash their hands of all responsibility. It seems like these days that is all anyone is ever doing, avoiding taking responsibility. One of the most backwards parts of our justice system is the fact that the state has to allow you to even ATTEMPT to sue them. I believe this is the same across all 50 states and it applies to the suing the Feds too.

One thing I feel needs to be pointed out at least once, is the way these athletes are protected from the consequences of their own actions. Perhaps in this part of Ohio big name and up and coming athletes can get away with assaulting a female (sounds crazy), but it's not even close to the norm across the country if we are talking about sports in public schools. I have seen starting quarterbacks kicked from teams due to a single positive drug test. My football team has won the State Championship twice and been at least 5 times. I was an all conference outside linebacker and if anything, the football players were held to a higher standard that the other students (by our coaches). This is not to say that I don't believe it happened, I am sure it did with this much documentation.
