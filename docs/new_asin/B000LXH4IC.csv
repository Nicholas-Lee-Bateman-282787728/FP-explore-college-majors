8164919,4,B000LXH4IC,"Well made, fun, good photography, and Asha Gill, the narrator, is charming. Alas while the video is good, the disc is faulty, it keeps stopping here and there. Or it might have been my own bum luck. Recommended.",1272240000,,211,4.578947368421052
8164920,3,B000LXH4IC,"Clocking in at 52 minutes this DVD is part of the Lonely Planet 6ix Degrees series that attempts to show the sort of quirky cultural and physical experiences you can have in a city outside the mainstream tourist path if you have the right contacts. This episodes host is Asha Gill who scoots around the Taiwanese capital bouncing from off the cuff encounter to off the cuff encounter all based on joining the dots between people she meets. As such it's not really intended as a genuine how to guide. For that you would need one of the more mainstream country or city guides. However if you have read that sort of stuff and want something a little more light hearted, perhaps a touch more enjoyably pointless then this series isn't a bad thing to tap into. They often come up very cheap and if you are lucky enough to be Johny on the spot I'd recommend grabbing one or two just to see if the style suits your style, if you take my meaning.

In reference to this episode, Asha talks to people such a professional funeral mourner to the mayor, from a singer to a 'puppetry connoisseur and in between gets to know some Chinese Civil War veterans squatting in a run down village. So you can't complain about the variety!

As I said, be aware that the formats of these shows are not standard, they really are meant to be something different. I'd watch this to get a fun flavour of a place and pick up a proper city guide to really work out my own trip.",1256774400,,1446,4.351851851851852
8164921,4,B000LXH4IC,"If you can ignore the irritating 'ive grown up as an expat child' presenter this dvd offers a varied and glamourous overview of modern day cosmopolitan istanbul....from a cashed up perspective. The absence perhaps of exposing the contrasting reality of everyday extreme poverty in Istanbul is perhaps a bit misguiding  but hey, don't let that put you off purchasing this DVD if you are thinking of visiting istanbul ...most taxi drivers  in my experience  do not speak english .. nor dance like loonies....and having  relocated to istanbul recently as a single western female I would not suggest a night out with the boys drinking arac is a good or safe idea as innocently purveyed in this DVD ....360 restaurant is a nice venue but not to eat so I've heard - Cevahir shopping mall is horrendously spectacular and claustraphobic at the same time...however I was impressed with the emergency services/earthquake rescue drill  as apparently the next major one is due anytime soon! Oh and fine turkish wine Doluca isnt.....",1189123200,3,1020,5.011834319526627
8164922,5,B000LXH4IC,"Even though so much of what is accessible to the guide depended on her relationship to people or people who knew interesting people, the DVD was very interesting in terms of upper crust Instanbul and various ""in"" spots (which could be visited by any tourist, some a bit pricey). If you're not one of the vegan groupie hiker-hostel types, but prefer good hotels, food and your own pursuits, I highly recommend this as informative and entertaining.",1174521600,5,446,4.881578947368421
8164923,5,B000LXH4IC,"I enjoyed the relaxed style of the DVD a great deal.  Taking vidio snapshots of various people's lives in Taipei appealed to me.  The scenes and neighborhoods contributed to my excitement for my upcoming trip.  This isn't a ""museum"" or ""monument"" guide but instead gives a bit of flavor for the culture and experience opportunities that can be had.  I didn't feel that I couldn't recreate the experiences for myself and I am looking forward to the trip.",1173312000,3,453,4.769230769230769
