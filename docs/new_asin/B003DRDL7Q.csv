8394903,5,B003DRDL7Q,"My husband and I did this series of classes in 1996 when our children were babies and toddlers.  It was vital for our marriage and for the moral development of our children.  It helped my husband and I, who come from polar opposites as far as child rearing, get on the same page with parenting and find complete harmony.  I HIGHLY recommend it to anybody who wants to raise godly children in this day and age.",1461456000,,409,4.355263157894737

GROWING KIDS GOD'S WAY:
BIBLICAL ETHICS FOR PARENTING
(5th EDITION)
(8th PRINTING - JANUARY 2001
*............As was the case with the previous editions, this curriculum is not intended to give all the answers or provide the reader with all he or she will ever need to know about the process of raising a child.
Therefore, parents guided by their own convictions have the ultimate responsibility available today and then make an informed decision as to what is best for their family.

* Growing Kids God's Way is JUST ONE RESOURCE OUT OF MANY AVAILABLE TO GUIDE PARENTS ALONG THE WAY.
