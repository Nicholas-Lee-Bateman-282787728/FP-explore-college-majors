4505346,4,B004Z2ECX0,"Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, has been portrayed on film more than any other historical figure in American history. From the silent films of 1911, to the upcoming Spielberg movie with Daniel Day-Lewis, Lincoln has been on film well over two-hundred and sixty times. There have been many great actors in the role, including Sam Waterston (in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gore-Vidal-s-Lincoln/dp/B00028G75C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gore Vidal's Lincoln</a>, which I feel presents the definitive screen Lincoln), and Gregory Peck (in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blue-and-the-Gray/dp/B00005OSJP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blue and the Gray</a>). One of the few actors to portray him in more than one different film or miniseries has been Hal Holbrook. I first saw him portray Lincoln in Books One and two of the Miniseries&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-and-South/dp/B0002MFGDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North and South</a>. There, Holbrook gave a warm and wonderful portrayal of Honest Abe. But I did not know that those two miniseries were not his first time portraying the character. That came eleven years before in this six-part miniseries from 1974, the first of its kind at the time.

Based on the Pulitzer Prize winning book by Carl Sandburg, this miniseries presents a really strong portrayal of Lincoln. From his time as a Prairie Lawyer, to his last days as President of the United States, Holbrook shows a wonderful range as Lincoln, capturing his sense of funny storytelling, his strong emotions when confronted with death, and his strong determination to win the war at all costs. The supporting cast does a fantastic job as well. But when one approaches this series, be aware that it is not a straightforward story being told chronologically. The story shifts from various points of Lincoln's life and Presidency from one episode to the other. It is best to be viewed as a series of ""vignettes"" that take a look at certain aspects of the story of Lincoln. And it does seem that trying to view it in any sort of chronological order will be nearly impossible. Nevertheless, this is a fine look at the life and Presidency of one of America's greatest leaders. If you enjoy American History, then you will enjoy ""Sandburg's Lincoln.""

It has been a favorite of ours through the years and our VHS tape is unplayable now.

but we are mainly buying it for our 16 year old son who loves it!  Sada Thompson is
incredible as well!  You will not be able to stop watching this mini-series!

4505364,5,B004Z2ECX0,Wonderful adaption of Carl Sandburg's poetic biography on Lincoln.  I remember watching this in college many years ago and was glad to find it transferred to DVD.  The picture and sound was very good.  I didn't find any real issues with the transfer. Hal Holbrook did a wonderful job at portraying our 14th President.  He is tall enough and with the makeup looked very authentic. The historical order of the episodes on the DVD doesn't follow Lincoln's history so if you want to follow in order you'll need to change that around and not just follow the DVD.  That is something that I guess was overlooked in the transfer but nonetheless the production is well acted and directed .  It is easy to see why Hal Holbrook won an Emmy for his work.  He has to rank at the top of all of the Lincoln actors to date.  Well worth adding to the DVD collection.,1410998400,,849,4.432258064516129
4505365,4,B004Z2ECX0,this mini- series was done rather well and Hal Holbrook did an excellent job portraying Lincoln but the story jumped around alot. The other actors also performed very well.,1409788800,,172,4.9655172413793105
4505366,5,B004Z2ECX0,"I saw Sandburg's Lincoln (originally just called Lincoln) when it first came out in the 70's and it burned itself into my brain because it was just such a well done Lincoln biography. Since then however I've only seen it repeated once, and I always hoped it would come out so I could buy it. It certainly took long enough but is well worth the wait.

Holbrook gives a masterful performance as Lincoln, with all the riveting countrified genius history says he had. This Lincoln is as utterly convincing stretched out whittling and telling stories, as he is delivering his 2nd inaugural or debating Stephen Douglas. He totally inhabits the part, a job made easier I'd think by the wonderful actors he's surrounded with. In particular, Sada Thompson is quite his equal as Mary Lincoln. Their portrayal of the relationship that existed between Mr. & Mrs. Lincoln is the best I know of. Sure Mary is a difficult woman, and Thompson covers the tantrums and squabbles, but these are one of the most loving Lincoln couples ever shown. You see how Lincoln gave strength to Mary through her troubles, but you also see how she gave strength (and good advice) to the President. What comes out is a 3-dimensional couple, not just the cardboard cutouts of Mary as a witch and Lincoln as the patient saint.

Another great actor in this is Beulah Bondi. She only appears in the first episode playing Lincoln's step mother Sara Bush Lincoln, but her scenes with Holbrook frankly just break your heart. I tear up whenever I see it. Sandburg's Lincoln was one of Bondi's final roles (she just did 2 episodes of the Waltons after this) and it is a fitting crown to her career.

A few drawbacks: Some people are put off by the fact that Holbrook was heavily made up to more closely resemble Lincoln. Some other actors (like Sam Waterson in Gore Vidal's Lincoln) prefer to play the part with virtually no make up. But Holbrook's make up is very well done and as I say he completely inhabits his role. I find that after a few minutes I entirely forget that this is Hal Holbrook in make up and after that adjustment Lincoln's face looks absolutely authentic to me.

Some viewers say that this presentation of Lincoln seems episodic. And they're right, because Sandburg's Lincoln was originally presented sporadically from 1974 to 1976. Each episode covers a particular theme in Lincoln's life and they were not presented in chronological order. This resulted in some unavoidable anomalies: for instance, 2 different men (Lloyd Nolan in 1975, Whit Bissell in 76) played Secretary of State Seward. And you see 2 episodes with Lincoln in the White House before you get to see him as a young prairie lawyer. This set has rearranged the episodes into a more chronological order.

One other point: As the title suggests, this miniseries was based on Carl Sandburg's biography of Lincoln, which is no doubt the best written biography, but not necessarily the most accurate. Mr. Sandburg included several ""facts"" and events in his books that are great for dramatic purposes, but a Lincoln scholar will tell you didn't really happen. One of them has a major effect on one of the episodes in Sandburg's Lincoln.

In the ""Mrs. Lincoln's Husband"" episode, Mary is accused of having confederate-leaning sympathies and perhaps even of being a traitor. Lincoln's political enemies conspire to use this accusation against him. And Mary Lincoln's loyalty was actually questioned during the war, making difficulties for her husband. In Sandburg's biography and in the miniseries Lincoln eventually defuses the whole thing by appearing unannounced to vouch for his wife before a congressional hearing called to examine the question, something that Presidents never, ever do (separation of powers and all that). It's a very dramatic story that sounds Lincoln-ish and has been popular for a long time. But, regrettably, it never really happened.

Despite these slight reservations though, this miniseries is well worth being added to any Lincoln fan's collection. The performances are wonderful, it shows things usually skipped over by Lincoln films, and gives you a good feel for what it was like to be with Lincoln. Personally, I believe this is one of the best -- if not *the* best -- depictions of him in film.",1408579200,,4269,4.888121546961326

...I must say this one's terribly flawed.
Every minute of my copy has good sound and color, no film damage, but for some unknown reason any motion at all beyond mouth movement is terribly spastic, jerky like the image you'd see from a cheap webcam.

4505401,5,B004Z2ECX0,"Hal Holbrook is an amazing Lincoln and Sada Thompson shines as Mary Todd Lincoln in this classic mini-series.  Even though this is an older production, it still captures what many of the other films have left out including his early years before his presidency.  Lincoln's wit and charm are masterfully captured by Holbrook's performance like none of the other films I have seen.

The only problem, which has already been noted by others, is the episodes are out of order on the two discs.  I was confused when ""Mrs. Lincoln's Husband"" had them in the White House then the episode following it, ""Prairie Lawyer"" shows Lincoln prior to moving to the White House.  Sometimes Lincoln will be seen with or without the beard so it's a little puzzling.

Overall, I believe this is one of the best films depicting Lincoln.  I didn't experience severe color problems as others reported.  The film showed its age, but nothing significant.  I did discover that the discs do not play well in Analog DVD Dual Layer recorders which I own.  After finally purchasing a new Blue Ray DVD player, it played perfectly with no problems.

It had me in tears, then laughter, then awe as I watched this humble man. Is it any wonder why he is so loved and admired?

I did have problem playing this DVD on my Blu Ray player (even though it is supposed to play regular DVDs and does, except for this one), it never worked, so I ended up viewing on my laptop.",1362268800,4,626,4.1735537190082646

4505406,4,B004Z2ECX0,"I usually avoid dramatic representations of historical persons and events since so much of it is necessarily fictional, and I'm talking about the conversations.  Face it, nobody who is alive today ever spoke to Lincoln or heard him speak.  We have a certain amount of information from his contemporaries, along with a massive amount of his writings, but as to dialogue, the record does not stand up to an awful lot of conversation in the five hours of drama presented in this two disk set.

Having said that, let me qualify the criticism by saying that I didn't see much in this presentation that seemed unreal or unlikely to me.  We know a lot about Lincoln and the people who were around him during his presidency, and I found this dramatic presentation quite enjoyable.  I'll have to say that I think the appearance of most of the supporting actors was very poorly done.  The only one I recognized without hearing his name spoken by one of the other characters was Edwin Stanton.

For those who have not bought or seen this portrayal of Lincoln's years in the White House, the 2 disk set is definitely worth the price.  It focuses much more on the emancipation proclamation than on the Civil War, and demonstrates as well as it can both the support for, and the resistance to, Lincoln's determination to both hold the Union together and also honor the belief that ""all men are created equal.""

From a personal standpoint, having read much about Lincoln, the Civil War and other persons involved in both the war and government of that time, this is probably as close as we're going to get to sharing the events of those turbulent years.",1358726400,4,1638,4.659722222222222

4505412,5,B004Z2ECX0,"I had never seen the mini-series Sandburg's Lincoln. It first aired in 1974. I'm 38 years overdue on this! Just recently, it became available on DVD. I don't even own a VHS player anymore. Anyway, I had heard over the years how good Hal Holbrook played Lincoln. Many said his is the best of all portrayals of Lincoln. When I saw the picture on the cover of the DVD set I had my doubts. The picture doesn't do justice to Holbrook as Lincoln. Holbrook's face looks too fat to me. However, once I started watching the movie I was blown away! If ever any actor nailed the looks of Abraham Lincoln-it has got to be Holbrook!

While watching Hal Holbrook as Lincoln it struck me in a way that I had not realized before-just how homely Abraham Lincoln really was! This has been talked about before. We have gotten used to seeing images of Lincoln and don't give his looks much thought. However, when watching Holbrook as Lincoln move about as he does in the film-it brings the looks out in a way a still picture doesn't. The make-up people did a masterful job in creating Lincoln out of Holbrook. I couldn't believe how large Lincoln's ears were. Forgive me I love Lincoln-but I can see why McClellan called him a gorilla. Lincoln, himself, knew he was not a handsome man.

More than that, Holbrook captures Lincoln in other ways. No wonder his performance earned him an Emmy. He is brilliant. I just watched the movie with my eyes glued to Holbrook studying his moves, mannerisms, and reactions to things. The deathbed scene of Willie Lincoln is very moving. Silently, Lincoln walks out of the room where Willie has died. Lincoln says nothing. He is barely holding back from crying out in emotional pain. A tear is noticed streaking down his cheek. Other scenes are just as powerful. There's also Lincoln the husband. It is plain the Abraham and Mary love each other very much. Lincoln expresses guilt that he has brought pain into Mary's life by bringing her to Washington. Their affection is often warm and wonderful to watch. By all means, purchase this set!",1354752000,5,2055,4.612021857923497
4505413,5,B004Z2ECX0,"Oh my gosh is this good!  It reminds me of what quality television production used to look and sound like.

I don't watch television very much anymore because it is a veritable wasteland of bad writing and pathetic acting by personalities, not accomplished artists who know their craft.  When my kids try to get me to watch the junk they think is so great and the ""newscasters"" they now worship for their witty charm and feckless, biased observations, I confess I get crotchety and tell them that they wouldn't know good acting and writing if they saw it and heard it and that Cronkite, Huntley, Sevareid, Reasoner, Brinkley and Reynolds must all be having a good laugh at their news anchor assessment.

Here is a history replay based on Carl Sandburg's book that is beautifully done and played by first-rate actors in the sunset years of outstanding TV.  Sorry kids....these were the good old days.  So if you want to see what it looked like and sounded like before CGI glitz and shallow storylines, rent or buy this.  You will see a tour de force performance by one of our greatest treasures, Hal Holbrook and strong supporting cast including Sada Thompson, Michael Christopher, John Dysart and the wonderful John Randolph. This is right up there with the recent miniseries on John Adams albeit it lacks the production qualities of Adams.

One of the best scenes in the series is a vignette between Lincoln's stepmother, Sally Bush Johnson and Lincoln when he returns to visit her in the old log cabin on the Kentucky border.  Played by Beulah Bondi, this is a scene of true craft as these two masters massage every emotion out of the scene with virtuoso performances.  I watched it three times, it was so enthralling in its simplicity and purity.  Thank God this is preserved on film.

So yes...grab your digital kids and make them sit (without their Blackberries, Galaxies and iPhones) and see what good television production used to look like and what real political leaders act like, even when surrounded by charlatans and sharks and war.",1354320000,4,2044,4.7920227920227925

Holbrook plays him as a shrewd country lawyer, without the usual Christ-like aspects, which were common in the early film versions.  The series is limited by budget and does not show the true scope of the war.  Holbrook and Sada Tompson are magnificent, although Lincolns makeup is sometimes rather obvious.  Holbrook also used the voice that was described in the historys, not the rich baritone that is usually part of the role.
We see the shrewd politician and leader and come to respect the intellect of the man.  We also see the skills that allowed him to hold together a cabinet of enemies.  The resolution could  be a lot better and remastering would be a great help but considering the age, it is not unreasonable.  The supporting cast is excellent.

4505429,4,B004Z2ECX0,"This work is not as comprehensive presentation as HBO's presentation of John Adams by David McCullough.  Both presentations try to depict American historic figures as individuals with the individual's personality and human fragility. The Adam's mini-series is a collection of stories presented about John Adams as narratives that follow one event follows another event. Not so in this 1970's TV Mini-series, the six stories about Lincoln do not build upon each other. The Lincoln presentations are vignettes. Some of the historic events depicting in the stories overlap each other. Each is like a snapshot of Lincoln as the central character.  I have never read either book that these mini-series are based, but I speculate the TV biography of Adams more closely follows the book. This does not mean the Sandburg's work adapted to film is not an excellent use of story telling in depicting historic event and what Lincoln may have been like. The Lincoln presentations are vignettes: simple stories.

Hal Holbrook portrays Abraham Lincoln as a thoughtful individual with strength of purpose, dealing with individuals, dealing with vagaries of life and the war situation. The characterization of Lincoln could be nitpicking as to idealistic and not as nuanced, but I think no work could have made that perfect balanced.

If one wants to see a series of short stories about the sixteenth President of the United States that gives you vignettes of a legal case he defended, his courtship of someone who decides not to marry him, his relationship with his children, how he coped with office seekers, the Washington elite, struggles with his cabinet, his victory- triumph and plans for the future-but not his death and his struggle for a victorious plan and General. Six presentations in all and need not be seen in any particular order for your understanding. Each drama equips the viewer a glimpse what type of man he might have been.",1328659200,10,1930,5.078864353312303

Pressing play started the audio only.  I have watched hundreds of DVD's and have  never have had this problem before or after this disc.  To get two bad ones in a row says something for the manufacture of the disc.  It actually should get zero stars in my rating but was not sure reveiw would accept that.",1327622400,7,483,4.241758241758242
4505431,5,B004Z2ECX0,"This is a must-see for anyone interested in Abraham Lincoln's presidential term in office.  Hal Holbrook can be seen employing the impressive acting skills that would lead him to future character roles such as Mark Twain.  One-half star deduction for video transfer to DVD, but it's fully acceptable if you have decent equipment for reproduction.  I agree with other's assessment that this is probably the best that could be done under the circumstances.",1327449600,2,454,5.191780821917808

I guess it's always true you get what you pay for in this case nothing. For those of who might think it was my DVD player it wasn't because all the other dvds in the order worked well. I've been asked many times by amazon to review my orders. I only do that if something is wrong.,1323648000,7,427,3.808988764044944

Well acted, some classic lines, and good cinematography.  Shows the culture then well.
Do see this portrayal of Lincoln.",1320364800,2,153,5.375
4505435,3,B004Z2ECX0,"I bought this DVD based on the meager four reviews posted on Amazon and was disappointed when I received it, put it in my DVD player and began to watch it.  The video quality is extremely poor.  I have VHS tapes with a better picture than you get with this and, considering it was just released this year, I'm appalled at the treatment.  Why even bother to put this out with the picture quality as it is?  Oh, I'll still watch it because I love Holbrook's characterization of Lincoln but throughout I'll be lamenting the quality (or lack thereof)of the picture.",1319328000,8,561,4.524752475247524
4505436,4,B004Z2ECX0,"I was impressed with the quality of this package, altho the films from which the transfers were made are slightly pink, from age.  There are only two problems with it:  The discs will not play on my new bluray machine.  These are the only non-bluray DVD's I have bought that won't play on it.  I only get the menu, but when I click to play any episodes, there is no response.  SO I had to watch it elsewhere, on a regular DVD player. The other problem is more of a puzzlement; these episodes are not in chronological order, as originally aired!  They are not in sequence with Lincoln's life.  There must have been a reason for doing this, but it is beyond me.",1313884800,8,659,4.308943089430894
4505437,5,B004Z2ECX0,"This is one Lincoln-fan who is literally ECSTATIC that this wonderful series is finally coming out on DVD.  Having loved Lincoln my entire life, and having been totally familiar with all the other movie/TV depictions of him that have been done over the years, Hal Holbrook's depiction of Lincoln is, was, and remains, in my opinion, the very very best ever done.  Better than Raymond Masseys's, better than Henry Fonda's  The absolute gold standard.  While Holbrook may not be as tall as Lincoln actually was, contemporary accounts tell us that Lincoln actually spoke not with the deep-base baritone of a Massey, but with a countrified ""twang.""  He would say ""Mr. Cheerman"" for ""Mr. Chairman,"" for example.  Holbrook totally nails this - giving us, what I think, is probably the closest to the ""real"" sounding Lincoln that has ever been portrayed.

Note that this series does not present a straight linear forward time-line of Lincoln's life and career.  But it is possible, if you watch the episodes in a certain order, to follow along his life in a fairly accurate manner.  Let me suggest this order to view the series:

1)Start with ""Prairie Lawyer"" - which shows him as a young lawyer, having just moved to Springfield, a short time after his New Salem days.  Incidentally, while movies have depicted his romance with Ann Rutledge, this episode is, to the best of my knowledge, the only cinematic depiction ever done of his relationship with ""another Mary"" - a young woman named Mary Owens, whom Lincoln courted after Ann Rutledge died, before he met Mary Todd.  Wonderfully presented, as is the prairie court room, with a case that Lincoln is trying against his current (and perennial future) opponent, Stephen A. Douglas.

2)Then catch ""Crossing Fox River"" - showing the campaign for the Presidency in 1860, and the transition period during which, as Present-Elect, he names his cabinet (covering the story told by Doris Kearns Goodwin in her book, Team of Rivals). A very wonderful scene is where Lincoln says good bye to his elderly stepmother, Sarah Bush Johnson, never to see her again...

3)Then see ""Mrs. Lincoln's Husband"" - depicting the heartbreak the Lincolns faced, as a couple in the White House, and the accusations of treason made against Mrs. Lincoln by political opponents of her husband.

4)Next, catch ""Unwilling Warrior"" - which shows us Lincoln the War President. Very episodic, it jumps from the ""Baltimore Plot"" - the attempt to assassinate Lincoln while travelling to Washington to assume the Presidency in 1861; to his grappling with military strategy; his relationship with Gen. McClellan, with Gen Grant, and, in one of the very best scenes involving Lincoln in any medium that I have ever seen - TV or cinema - the story of Lincoln's journey into Richmond, shortly after it fell to Union troops in April 1865, and only a few short days before his death.

5)""Sad Figure Laughing"" - this is the interesting tale of the relationship with another member of that ""Team Of Rivals"" - the Secretary of the Treasury, Salmon P. Chase, and Chase's efforts aimed at replacing Lincoln as Republican Party Presidential nominee in 1864.

6) Finally, ""The Final Days,"" tells of Lincoln's last few days in office - very hauntingly done.  The opening scene, depicting Lincoln's speech from a White House balcony to a crowd on the lawn, celebrating the surrender of Lee to Grant at Appomatix (and where Lincoln asks the band to play ""Dixie"") is particularly effective.

Again, I cannot praise this series enough. ANYONE at all interested in Lincoln, ANYONE who enjoys reading about him, will find this series both moving and rewarding.  My only regret is that there are no ""extras"" on it - behind the scenes ""making of"" documentaries, and that sort of thing.  Oh well...when one is served lobster, I suppose he should not complain that there is no steak on the plate as well.  I am so thrilled to finally have Sandburg's Lincoln on DVD.

Late Addition Re Transfer Issue: I have read the comments regarding the transfer quality.  You should know that this David Wolper production, produced in the mid 1970s, was originally filmed, unfortunately, not on high grade 35 mm film, but lower grade 16 mm.  The stock deteriorated until, a few years ago, the only source material found was decaying and brown.  So, frankly, Lincoln fans should be grateful that ANY fairly viewable source material remained to make this transfer.  I will say that I think some of the comments about the absolute ""awfulness"" of the transfer quality are a little overblown.  It is not a 21st century fully digital, pristine, transfer.  But, again, this was a TV SERIES IN THE 1970s!  Please, please, please - try and get past the fact that this is not a new transfer of a fully digitalized ""Avatar,"" and just enjoy the series - the story, the writing, the characters, and Holbrook's WONDERFUL depiction of Lincoln!

Late Late Addition Re Daniel-Day Lewis Issue:  Yes, it is amusing to watch Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" movie, with D-D-Lewis as Mr. Lincoln, and see him holding conversations with Hal Holbrook (as Maryland politico Preston Blair).  Frankly, these scenes make me a little sad - because I know that most of the world - and, in fact, even probably 99% of the audience watching the Spielberg movie - have no idea that Holbrook himself ever played Lincoln!  And that makes me feel bad for Holbrook - makes me wish how some sort of time-warp movie meld could take place momentarily during these scenes, and transport a nearly 40 year-younger Holbrook into the Lincoln role, right there into the movie, in front of us.  Now, I think DD Lewis was GREAT as Lincoln.  Well-deserved Academy Award for his performance!  But I still must give highest honors to Holbrook. Something about HH's mannerisms, his laughter, his expressions, and, yes, his voice (""like a barn owl caught in a bear trap"") that still gives Holbrook the title - in my book - of ""GREATEST Lincoln Ever Done On Film Or TV.""",1310860800,99,5976,4.8753709198813056
