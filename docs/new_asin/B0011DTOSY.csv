8241451,5,B0011DTOSY,"Along with Jia Zhangke's Platform, Unknown Pleasures, and Still Life, Jian Wen's 2007 The Sun Also Rises is now one of my favorite Chinese films.  This film is really beautiful, witty, gutsy and, for lack of a better word, COOL.  This film is so cool that when compare to Jian's own Let the Bullets Fly, the latter becomes pale and pretentious. Highly recommended!!!",1368403200,,366,4.7936507936507935
