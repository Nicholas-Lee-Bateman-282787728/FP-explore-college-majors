8178524,4,B000NJMJM0,"Concert is great however I noticed that the video is missing several songs that are available on the audio CD.  I wouldn't have noticed unless I hadn't bought the audio CD too, if this DVD had the extra footage it would have been excellent!

The only con for me is that the video quality is sub-par for even DVD standards, although the audio quality is great.  Only if it was recorded in HD video & audio and on Bluray!

1. Introduction
2. Que Me Lleven Canciones
3. Calla
4. Porque Dios Mio?
5. Amor Con Amor
6. Ayer Y Hoy
