8422845,5,B004C6SI7A,"Great Classic with Kirk Douglas. There is a sequence where he does a Clown Act. I was so impressed. Anyone who  had done clowning will know how difficult this it and he did it with the greatest of ease, like a professional. He must have practiced for hours.",1448582400,,257,4.354166666666667

8422847,4,B004C6SI7A,"One might as well get right to the root of the big question about this release, the movie itself, as relatively few people have ever seen this picture. The Juggler is a better idea for a movie than it is a movie -- it has what they sometimes refer to in the theater world as ""second act problems."" The latter mostly concern the script and tone in the middle section, and Kirk Douglas's performance, which break the tension in what was a superb opening 45 minutes, though the movie does almost redeem itself in the third act. It's also enjoyable to see something as unusual as this movie, in terms of its subject matter and its location shooting -- the early days of the State of Israel, and the waves of immigrants, all of them refugees from Europe and many of them direct Holocaust survivors, arriving by the thousands, with such familiar players as Paul Stewart, John Banner, Richard Benedict, Jay Adler, and Charles Lane aboard, in such unfamiliar roles; and even Kirk Douglas, for all of the flaws in his performance, is fascinating as the tormented protagonist, mentally unhinged at his own guilt over the loss of his family.

As to the Sony Pictures Home Entertainment DVD at hand, it's a solidly professional DVD-R (manufactured on demand), mastered from a clean source for the movie -- obviously a 35mm print -- which looks good on the small screen. There are no extras, which is sort of unfortunate, since the production itself, regardless of the movie's flaws, as the first major Hollywood feature to be made in Israel, has some intrinsic historical interest and (obviously) an interesting back story -- one sort of wishes the picture had been more successful, so that it would have been on Sony Pictures' radar screen a bit more prominently, and there could have been the possibility of getting commentary before his stroke from Kirk Douglas, as well as surviving cast members Joey Walsh and Beverly Washburn. Given the fact that the movie never even showed up on VHS, however, it's difficult to complain too loudly about this release.",1352764800,7,2046,4.779661016949152
8422848,4,B004C6SI7A,"interesting story about the refuge provided to outcast Jews from the world and what it was like to begin a new country in hostile environment, enjoyed the young girl reciting her geography lesson on what country is located where with respect to Israel.... perhaps one too many Shaloms and american blondes but a perspective of holocaust survivor effects rarely seen especially in this timeframe ... kept wondering what happened to all the Arabs who used to live there as they mentioned abandoned Arab camps, were they forced out or chose to leave, and how relevant this is today and to bring home the reality of Syrian refugees and the horror of war, but leaving a bright ray of hope for those who live in such simplicity to create strength, enjoyed the juggling immensely!!",1346803200,,774,4.827067669172933
8422849,5,B004C6SI7A,Excellent condition. Wrapped well and you could tell it was new! I like that? Movie was interesting. Holocaust survivor in Israel suffers from PTSD before this illness became popularized. Kirk is great as is Senta Berger,1339286400,,220,5.138888888888889
