3513125,5,B001CIOCRQ,"This is a DVD that no Marty Robbins fan should be without. Having said that, any lover of any kind of music can appreciate what a unique and gifted talent Marty was. The beauty of his voice allied to his super songwriting, combined with a charismatic appeal that makes it hard for anyone not to like him even if you are not a fan of Country and Western Music. There are 15 songs here from the mid 50's up to the late 70's taken from various shows which showcase many of his biggest hits that usually have Marty smiling his head off while he delivers the songs even if they are sad ones! The 'extras' include his induction to the Country Music Hall of Fame and a previously unseen interview by Marty which makes him come across as a thoroughly warm human being which he no doubt was. Well, what are you waiting for?! Just order it; you won't regret it.",1222905600,38,851,4.291925465838509

3513133,5,B001CIOCRQ,"I also bought Marty Robbins Music Anthology. No one past or present can sing as good as Marty. The singers today have electronic enhancements to make them sound good and these were not developed yet in the 50's, 60's, and 70's like ""auto tune"" to name one. He loved performing and sharing his music and that is plain to see when he performs. All the performances were taped live there are no recordings with him just moving his lips. He always had a smile on his face and was clowning around. I regret not going to see a live performance but at least I have these dvd's that I really enjoy. He could sing any kind of music to perfection and he did sing all kinds even Hawaiian. The interview with how he got into the music business is also interesting. You will love these dvd's and any other dvd's or cd's of Marty Robbins. Amazon shipping is fast!",1417824000,7,849,4.345911949685535
3513134,5,B001CIOCRQ,"Marty Robbins is truly an ""All Around Cowboy."" I love this music on my DVD ""Legendary Performances."" On this Disc Marty explains what inspired him to sit down and write these songs. In his song ""El Paso City"" I can see myself flying over the city of El Paso and seeing the things that Marty sang about. It feels good for me to see the things that brings this music to life!!! Marty will live forever..",1417392000,2,401,4.2894736842105265

3513139,5,B001CIOCRQ,Marty Robbins is a great singer. Lots of great songs that provide enjoyment no matter how many times you listen to them.,1389830400,,120,4.5
3513140,5,B001CIOCRQ,Marty Robbins was a favorite singer of mine and my husband's.  We listened to him a lot in years past.  We were saddened by his death.  But now with this product we can enjoy listening to him once again.,1380931200,,203,4.153846153846154

3513142,5,B001CIOCRQ,"Marty Robbins was one of the 'Greats',  and having seen him in concert back some 30 years ago, I have to say that this DVD is just wondrous.  Do yourself a favor and include it in your library.",1379462400,,193,4.052631578947368

3513144,5,B001CIOCRQ,"Marty could take you to the desert of Arizona ,or the shores of the South Seas , or to a high school night out .He could sing songs right across the spectrum .As as boy he transported me to all those wonderful places in my mind when listening to radio in Ireland .A singer , a storyteller ,a bard. Heaven is richer now for his passing.",1362182400,5,335,4.090909090909091
3513145,5,B001CIOCRQ,"Ok, so I am reviewing the content more than the DVD production itself. My only complaint is that it is too short. It's not that it isn't worth the money, I just can never get enough of Marty. On the production, it seems good to me, especially considering that this was all taken from film clips, and possibly some taped performances, but this was 1982 and before, so I am satisfied with the quality of the clips. The sound was good and the entire presentation was very enjoyable. Between the songs, there are comments by Ronnie Robbins, Merle Haggard, and others. I would definitely recommend it, and it will be watched often in my house.

I also ordered the Marty Robbins Anthology, which I also recommend.",1362182400,7,707,4.611111111111111
3513146,5,B001CIOCRQ,One of my favorite singer from the past. So glad to have anything with Marty Robbins beautiful voice. Nothing better than finding old videos from the past. They keep your favorite singers alive forever. Great video and I will look for more oldies and keep music alive. Great video and I hope I find more of the same. Thanks to Amazon and the seller.,1357948800,,349,4.46875
3513147,4,B001CIOCRQ,"I really like Marty Robbins and own many of his music CDs and old record albums.  But I suppose I had a preconceived idea of what this DVD was going to be like, because I was really disappointed in it.  But I am rating the DVD, not Marty Robbins or his music.

The DVD contains 15 of his performances done at different stages of his career and the sixth song was El Paso, which was in B/W, done without his band.  Marty simply sat in an old western store setting and sang the song, accompanying himself with his guitar.  Now El Paso is a great piece, but that lead guitar in his band that accompanies his singing is what really gives me a thrill and it was not included here!  Need I say more?  The 15th song was El Paso City, which was done with his band.

The interview at the end of the DVD was really good, probably the best part of the DVD.  For example, I had heard that Marty raced cars but I had not realized that he was a experienced NASCAR driver with multiple top 10 finishes.",1351468800,6,987,4.12565445026178
3513148,5,B001CIOCRQ,"CLASSIC MARTY--SO GOOD TO HAVE THESE, GIVEN HIS EARLY DEATH--HE HAD A GREAT VOICE, SENSE OF HUMOR.  ALWAYS GOOD SONGS.  WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THE TAPES OF HIS SHOWS WHEN HE WOULD ""RUN OVER ON THE TIME""--LOVE IT",1338768000,,214,4.325

3513150,5,B001CIOCRQ,"It's a great pleasure to own this DVD of Marty Robbins so I can hear him and see him perform.  He had many great hits during his short life and It's wonderful to see his best put in this collection to watch for a lifetime.  His signature songs leave you watching a top performer leaving the audiance wishing he would have been with us longer.

3513152,5,B001CIOCRQ,"I bought this a few months ago, and have watched it umpteen times! It includes
a lot of his very early performances, which are so interesting.  It includes
all his famous songs, and the dates on the box when they were performed.

But it is the ""Extra"" at the end of the tape that is so fantastic.
There is a long 45 minute interview with Marty.  He was so quiet-spoken, and
just so humble.  I loved seeing how excited he got speaking of his Nascar
races !!!  The interview is a lot of fun!!  Marty ends the interview with
a joke, it is so good !!!
Then after the interview they tacked on the tape of him accepting his Induction
into the Country Music Hall of Fame. His short speech was so cute !  This dvd is very enjoyable.",1308268800,15,724,4.16546762589928
