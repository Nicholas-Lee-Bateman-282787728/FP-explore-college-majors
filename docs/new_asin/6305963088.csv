1095060,5,6305963088,"Here on Earth is a wonderful movie. This movie, while watching it makes you realize just how precious your life can be. The movie is about a girl who works at a diner, and her long time friend who is always there for her.  Enter a high school boy who comes from a highly sophisticated world of  money and likeliness. An accident forces the wealthy kid(played by Chris  Klien) to stay and help repair the accident, along with Sams best friend  Jasper(played by Josh Hartnett). Both are attracted to Sam(played by Leelee  Sobieski), but during the halfway point of the movie, Sam realizes that her  time on earth is but short. Her parents watch out for her, and Jasper does  too. Sam has an instant attraction to Kelley(Chris Klien), and so does he  for her. Drama ensues between the two boys and Sam is trying to cope with  her illness she is facing while not giving up so easily as others do. She  lives her life to the fullest and the line that can get to you is when she  says ""some people live their whole life and never fall in love. And  i've lived my life, and I fell in love"". In the end, when all is said  and done, the viewer will realize just how precious life can be and just to  enjoy your life, before your time on earth is gone forever. I recommend  watching this movie because it is a sad look at the ultimate choices we  make when we are faced with life altering choices and the strengths it  takes to live each waking moment to the fullest and appreciate what life  has to and can offer you. Thank you!",963273600,35,1519,4.270175438596492
1095061,3,6305963088,"Here on Earth starts out great, it is slow, but an easy catch-on. It all starts out when Sobieski is best friends with Harnett, although Harnett is in love with her and has been, but she is clueless. Then, big city boy  Klein comes into town and steals Sobieski's fancy. Harnett is getting  jealous, but Klein says he doesn't have anything on him, but is soon  falling in love, too. Sooner or later, love unwinds and Harnett confesses.  But you would think that Sobieski would go for the old, well-known Harnett,  but she chooses the new, Klein, and goes to Boston, bringing Sobieski and  Harnett friends again. Then they have to make the ending disappointing.  Sobieski dies of an infected cut on her knee, which leads tragedy to the  rolling credits. But the movie wasn't as bad as many thought. With the dvd  having deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes featurette, and an audio  commentary, this dvd will bring more likeness to your small screen.",961891200,2,948,4.7607361963190185

1095242,3,6305963088,"The movie started out fairly good....a little off beat and unpredictable....but, as it progressed, it turned strangely ""mushy"" (""gooey"")....and began to fall apart, IMHO.  By the time it reached the end, it felt like all they were trying to do was to ""tug at my heartstrings"", instead of tell a good story.  It's not the kind of movie I'd watch twice, sadly.",1481241600,,358,4.758064516129032

1095425,2,6305963088,"While the storyline is interesting, it was not executed well in the time format.  The film seemed like an outline for a movie and time wise it was never fully experienced by the audience.  The actors were given too brief a period of time to communicate the depth of the relationship with scenes which did not enable the audience to experience the growth of the relationship between the couple.  The script was not fully honest in that the young man who fell in love with the girl, deserted her without having a real motivation to leave and returned without having enough motivation to return.  The father/son relationship made both the father and son as shallow as the script.  The father, who was suppose to be a successful man came across as someone who was easily disliked , controlling and had little love or respect for his son and yet his son grew up obedient to all authority.  At the same time, rebelled at the first opportunity by racing and destroying the restaurant and gas station.  Most of all, the girl. who was the love interest comments on their first encounter, makes a remark, ""If you look at my ass as I am walking away, I will dump your malt in your lap.""  Pure Class.",1477699200,,1188,4.518691588785047

1095901,3,6305963088,"It was good in parts, and other parts didn't get developed enough to be fully understood.. reasoning behind motives. Ok the three actors that make this movies are Leelee Sobieski who plays Sam.. Love her!! She is a natural. ... Josh Hartnett, who plays Jasper... Really like him natural acting... And Chris Klein, who plays Kelley.  I tried to get into his character but it felt like his acting was ""trying to hard to be a good actor and deliver his lines... Those two Really it felt so natural to watch.... Just not Kleins trying so hard. It made no sense of why she would choose ""Kelley"" hen he felt disconnected from most not all scenes and the character development was NOT  there.  It said on Amazon DVD cover Klein was smolders, I laughted as it felt faking.
  What got o my nerves the most is Watching Klein act... when Josh.. aka Jasper really showed he deeply cared for her and they had more connection, and he is a better actor.",1474934400,,938,4.461988304093567

IRL you're not just going to pound on a bus' door and they're going to open it and let you ride on it for hours in the name of love). I'm sorry but they just did not convince me. Especially when the preppy boy says its clear she made her choice and she says that's not a fair thing to say. WHY NOT?? You clearly have been jerking around 2 guys who treat you pretty close to gold standard for teenage boys, and you continue to refuse to make a choice between them. Why was this an acceptable story line in someone's mind, particularly with such bad acting? Glad I didn't finish it. No way they could've salvaged this movie in the last half hour. Being a teenager does not automatically imply being indecisive and wishy washy. Scriptwriter here clearly cared squat about that and chose to reinforce the stereotype.

They attempt to redeem the lead, unfortunately Chris Klein doesn't really make you feel it. In my opinion the movie would have worked a lot better if the Josh Harnett and Chris Klein roles were reversed. That said, Harnett is brilliant as a supporting character showing multi-dimensions that the lead character lacks. He comes across as the hero of the movie even though Klein's character eventually comes around. The Leelee Sobieski character is hard to sympathise with until we fully understand the story and she is easily redeemed by it. The story was emotional. It did move me. But a weak performance from the leading male just brings the movie to being just okay. And the character's lack of connection or growth with anyone except Sobieski's character leaves him shallow.

1101234,1,6305963088,"CONTAINS SPOILERS
BUT THERE REALLY ISN'T MUCH TO TELL,
AND THERE ISN'T MUCH THAT YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT RIGHT AWAY.

This movie started out good at the very beginning, but it very quickly just kept going downhill.
This movie had a lot of potential and could have been so much better.

I will give this movie one star, only because LeeLee was in it, and I love her, which is the only reason that I watched it all the way through.

The movie was boring and unrealistic and completely unoriginal.

LeeLee plays Sam.
She has a boyfriend since childhood, Jasper.
Sam cheats on Jasper with a rich guy whom she just met, Kelley.
Sam has been keeping a secret from everyone.she is dying.and she keeps the secret until she can't hide it anymore.

The title did not fit the movie.

As soon as it was mentioned that Sam had a doctor's appointment, I knew where the story was going.

There was no depth to this movie, no plot development or character development.
I did not care about the characters or the story.
I did not care what would happen next or how it would end.
I did not think that this movie was funny or sad or romantic, although it was obviously trying to be.

The dialogue did not hold my attention.
There were little one-liners that tried to make an impact, and some talk about heaven that was meant to be deep.
I thought that it was ridiculous when Sam said, ""I have lived my life,"" as if a teenager getting to the point of graduating high school and working in a diner in a small town and cheating on her boyfriend are all that there is to experience in life.

Kelley and Jasper fought, but neither of them had any bruises.

I wondered if anyone was killed in the fire, I supposed not, because they would have made a big deal about it.
It was unrealistic that everyone got out and no one was hurt.

This movie was a pathetic rip-off of ""Love Story"" and ""Terms of Endearment"" because it was obviously copying those two amazing movies without trying at all.

This was supposed to be a love story, but I did not see any chemistry between the actors, and I did not see any reason for the characters to be together, they had nothing in common except that they both liked one particular poem, and all that they did was kiss and run off and have sex.  There was no love or romance, it was just a quick sex affair (they never even had one date) -- at one point, Kelley even said to Sam that they didn't have anything important, and she just stared at him and said nothing.

Many people (teenagers and adults) mistake sex and lust for love.
Then, later, when they find real love, then they can tell the difference.
This movie never shows whether Sam and Jasper ever had sex.
My guess is that they did not.
So, if Sam and Jasper had had sex, then Sam would probably have thought that she was in love with Jasper.

The way that Sam treated her longtime boyfriend was disgusting.  Jasper was a really nice guy who treated her well and did not deserve to be cheated on, especially to be humiliated in front of the whole town.  And yet, he was still loyal to her until the end.

I think part of the reason that Sam rushed into sex with Kelley, and believed that it was love, and didn't care about how she hurt Jasper, was because she knew that she was dying and couldn't face it, so she threw herself into something new and fast and reckless as an escape.

Sam had a fatal illness, but no one knew about it (how does a doctor give a diagnosis to a minor without telling the parents?)
The illness is not explained in the movie.
The doctor said the name of the illness quickly, and it was barely audible.
I had to look it up on Wikipedia to understand it. osteosarcoma (you all can look it up for yourself, if you care.)
Also, at the end, Sam did not look sick, she just looked like she took her makeup off.

At the end, Kelley speaks at the funeral, as if he finally got to give the valedictorian speech that he was denied - - it was all about him.
I thought that that was in really poor taste.
It was also in poor taste that no one else was shown speaking at the funeral, not Jasper nor any of Sam's family members.
I found the funeral scene very unemotional and dull.
The ending was too quick and flat.

It was never explained how Kelley got out of going away to school.
How much time passed between Sam being admitted to the hospital to her death?
Kelley just hung around the small town all that time, and his father allowed that?
How long did Sam know that she was dying -- if she just graduated high school, she had to be a minor when she was told.
Movies, in general, often do not tell how much time passes between events, which makes a lot of difference to the meaning of the story.",1452902400,15,4679,4.252536640360766

Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein square off like two young banty roosters fighting over a pullet. Chris Klein has been described as a thinking man's jock. Josh Hartnett is one of those character actors who inhabits a part to the point that he leaves one saying, oh that's who that was. The girl they lock horns over just happens to be the local sheriff's daughter. Annette O'Toole plays her mother having come a long way since Beach Blanket Bingo, she later plays Superman's mother in Smallville. Michael Rooker, Cruise's competition in Days of Thunder plays Hartnett's father though it is interaction with his mother that assumes more importance in his life. The reconstruction project at the centre of the movie seems to be a community event. This is another one of those townie vs rich spoiled private boy's school stories. The point is driven home repeatedly that Richie Rich's father treats his son just like another one of his investments whereas the local yokel has loving parents who are involved in their son's life.

There is a lot of philosophy which will make life more worth living and difficulties more worth enduring in the story.  Yes, it is a story of love; but it is also a story of growing up and accepting things as they are and taking the good as it is offered.  Losses are hard to deal with but must be endured.  Love does not always come when or how it is expected.  Respect can be earned.  The ending is sad; but the love is really there.  Decisions are made, some good and some bad; the last ones are the best ones. Though early decisions by both young men in this story are not so good; both make really good ones in the end.  Two young men love and fight over the same girl.  I wuld say they never get to really like each other; but they do really respect each other in the end. Both come to accept thier place in the girl's heart. The story is superb and the acting great.  I really loved this movie.  It was well worth seeing.",1429488000,,1091,4.172248803827751

Kelley and Jasper get into a hot rod race that results in the fire that destroyed a popular local cafe. Problem: the cafe was run by the sheriff's sister, who is also Samantha's mother.

The judge sentences Kelley and Jasper to work on the rebuilding of the cafe, and Samantha is kind to Kelley. You can probably write the romance part from there.

1101816,3,6305963088,"You know that scene in `Here on Earth' where Leelee Sobieski's character Samantha is lying in a field and the camera is looming overhead while that Tori Amos song about crying one-thousand oceans plays in the background?  Yeah, I'm thinking about that too.

For me, while this film is far from anything even remotely commendable, there is a certain otherworldliness about this film that makes me take a closer look.  The acting, outside of Sobieski, is nothing to write home about, and the script itself is just a hodgepodge of scenes from more effective love stories, but there is something in the air (the film is breathtaking to look at) that just makes me a little weak...as in, too weak to turn the channel.  Even though the ending is as contrived and unimaginative as they come (I love the parody of `Love Story' that this sites review calls to mind) it doesn't for a second make me hate this movie.  Despite the fact that the plot itself makes me angry and I find the romance between the two leads to not only be insulting (poor Josh) but highly unbelievable, this movie grabs me and makes me pay attention.

When this movie is on I have to watch it.

So, it's not a good movie by any means, but it is an entertaining and highly engrossing and beautifully shot slideshow of mediocrity that begs to be watched over and over again.

No, I don't cry (and you can believe that since I am very open about my emotional instabilities).

The film tells the story of a young girl named Samantha who finds herself torn emotionally between her longtime boyfriend Jasper (love that name) and this arrogant preppy kid named Kelley.  When Kelley hits on Sam, Jasper gets mad, they chase each other in cars and then cause Sam's parents diner to blow up and they have to work together to rebuild it.  Sam soon falls in love with Kelley.  Everyone is against it, but when Sam gets sick it becomes apparent that Kelley is all she needs and suddenly everyone is okay with that.

Kelley's transformation is highly (and I mean that with complete and total emphasis) unbelievable, but it doesn't matter.  Chris Klein may be a beefycake, but his performances are always void of any real emotion (he's such a pansy of an actor) and so he is very unappealing, but it doesn't matter.

Don't ask me why.  I mean, everything about this movie screams for me to pan it (and I kind of have) but I just can't bring myself to hate this movie.  Sobieski is beautifully used here, completely soaking in her character and selling her as a person and not a gimmick (oh, the sick girl...like we haven't seen that before), and Josh Hartnett has always been an actor I found charming and effective in almost every role.

Every impulse in my body is fighting between an A grade and an F grade.

1101818,5,6305963088,"""Here On Earth"" has always been one of my favorite youth movies. The story is a simple one in which a young man has to perform manual labour for destroying a roadside diner. It is at this diner that he meets the girl of his dreams. They fall in love but there is one catch: she has a boyfriend. The story sounds simple. However it is the superb acting by the three leads that pulls this movie way above other teen-romance films. Hunky Chris Klein, most famous for his role in the ""American Pie"" movies, stars as the boy working at the diner. Superstar Josh Hartnett plays the ""other man"", and Leelee Sobieski, who looks a lot like Helen Hunt, plays the girl cought in the middle of these two studs. I truely enjoyed this film and once watching it the viewer becomes enthralled. The DVD features the video to the song from the film called ""Where You Are' performed by Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey. The trailer is included with subtitles in English and Spanish. The audio is English 5.1 Surround, English Dolby Sound, and French Dolby Sound. ""Teen Magazine"" says ""Chris Klein smolders in every scene"".",1251849600,,1102,4.570707070707071

1101869,4,6305963088,"Perhaps I am a softie or a romantic, but I can't agree with many who pan this film. It is far from the greatest of films, but it was touching in many ways. It is rather formulaic, but the formula works here for the most part. A rich upstart teenager comes into a small town and manages to get into a fight with a local and burn down the local diner. In a made-for-television kind of Solomonic wisdom, the judge sentences them to work together to rebuild the diner, Mabel's Table, the 'hot spot' of this whistle-stop town. Rich out-of-towner and local boy fight over the local girl, who has a tragic secret she is concealing.

Leelee Sobieski, plays the lead as Samantha, the local girl track star whose knee gave out, jeopardising her chance to go to college. Chris Klein plays Kelley, the spoiled rich kid who is nonetheless intelligent and has a heart he begins to discover during his time in the small town. Josh Hartnett is Jasper, the local boy who wants nothing more than to keep things the way they are, including his relationship with Samantha. Most of these performances are servicable without being stellar; they are typical romantic B-film fare, with many long, ponderous glances overlooking scenic views, and silly situations in which everyday life is shown.

The action is slow, but then, it isn't meant to be a fast-paced film. Samantha is torn between the comfortable sameness of her life in the small town with Jasper and her family, and the attraction that rich 'bad boy' Kelley represents, particularly after she learns he does have a heart. Samantha overhears Kelley reciting the valedictory speech he was prevented from delivering because of his sentence to build the diner; Kelley in the end does get to the deliver the speech, under different circumstances.

Jasper and Kelley fight (both verbally and physically) over the affections of Samantha, but when Samantha falls ill, they are able to put this aside for her sake. The diner is rebuilt, the town is restored to wholeness, but the situation with Jasper, Kelley and Samantha enters a new dimension, as fate has a different ending in store that none of them anticipated at the beginning of the summer.

The other actors in the film are really background for the tale - few stand out, but one who does is Annette O'Toole, who plays Samantha's mother, a role very similar to the one she takes up on 'Smallville' as Clark Kent's mother.

The story is gentle, sad, poignant - not terribly original, but very understandable in human terms. Love is unpredictable, and love often hurts. Love sometimes requires a sacrifice. Love can transform you. These are all themes that come across in the film, if not always terribly successfully.

It is a film worth watching, though.",1129507200,26,2742,4.7864693446088795
1101870,4,6305963088,"I haven't read the book and I almost wish I would've before watching the movie.  It was a good movie though it's directed more to a younger audience.  Nevertheless, if you're not that young you're bound to flashback to a time when love was so good it hurt and it was sweet, innocent, and pure.

Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein are incredibly breathtaking in this movie.  They are two visually agreeable young men with whom I have no problem looking at when a scene demands that they not wear clothing.

Lee Lee Sobeiski does well in this lead role.  She's portrayed as a young unspoiled and carefree young lady who's into poetry and love.  She looks so ""innocently gorgeous"" in this movie where I could've sworn I could see a faint golden light radiate from her face and actually seep through her persona.  She's awesome.  Although, I did question her acting at times.  She seemed to mumble her lines more than actually say them with emotion.  She meets up with Klein's character almost by a tragic accident when he's forced to live in a town where his ""rich"" kind isn't welcomed.  He's got tension with Harnett's character because after all he is charming the pants off his girlfriend (Sobeiski).  I thought it was a great story! Whose heart hasn't been torn in half by the possibility of loving two people at the same time?  The ending is very sad.  But, it's clear to everyone that a love so great can never be pushed away no matter how much it hurts it's needed.

They kept mentioning a poet throughout the movie of which I would like get a hold of his poetry.  It's simply beautiful.  You'll hear his poems mentioned from beginning to end. My favorite quote said something like this ""Wouldn't you like to leave Earth for a couple of moments and then return to start all over again?"" Yes, I would.

This movie hits all of the passion that we felt and had as teenagers.  Pure innocent love hitting you directly in your heart.  Sobeiski, Hartnett, and Klein show us that ""love"" being such a difficult and confusing emotion can truly be immortalized on screen.",1129420800,2,2059,4.5710382513661205

Josh's character is Jasper (I think that is his name. I cant remember) and he is Samantha's (Lee Lee Sobeski) boyfriend. He is nice, kind, caring, and understanding. So perfect. Chris Klein plays Kelley. Kelley is a snobby, rich kid who thinks that his dad's money can get him out of anything. He thinks that he is untouchable. He is cocky. He is a jerk. And when they try to make him deep and thoughtful...to me it all felt fake. When doing a movie like this, you are supposed to make the boyfriend a jerk and the guy the girl cheats with a caring and compassionate guy. I usually like Lee Lee Sobeski but in this movie I thought her a whore. I never want her to get together with Kelley. I hated it when she went to his house and slept with him. I felt so bad for Jasper. I cried when he at the end of the movie basically said that he loves Samantha so much that he just wants her to be happy. Even if it meanst that is isn't with him.

Leelee was a great actor and did her best to make it believable but Chris Klein hardly smiled at all when onscreen. Acting is where you make it believable but he hardly did that at all. If i were on the screen with her instead of Chris Klein I would talk more and smile a hell of alot more.  I think the only reason why he got in this movie is because of his looks.  His acting skills in this movie are well okay but it sucks in this kind of movie when he shows no emotion. Makes it kind of boring.

1101906,1,6305963088,"Let me begin by giving a quick movie lesson to all of you out there. There are essentially two types of chick flicks. The first kind is very rare and is successful because of its appeal to both sexes. For an example of a chick flick that falls into this category, you may wish to read my review of 'Anywhere But Here' by clicking here.

Of course that leaves the other kind of chick flick which are the films which give the genre its name!!! Much to my dismay (being a huge fan of Leelee Sobieski), 'Here on Earth' falls into this category and is quite simply one of the most tedious and unfulfilling features I have come across in recent times.

Given my absolute disgust with this title, I shall try to keep my comments brief. In a nutshell, 'Here on Earth' is yet another film aimed at the ever-growing teen audience demographic. The problem lies in the pacing of the feature. It is so slow!!! We are forced to endure countless scenes of adolescent angst during the first two acts of this feature that by the time the third act comes around with its so-called 'surprise' twist (which even a halfwit could guess), the audience just doesn't seem to care. I know my immediate concern at that point was how many more minutes of my life were going to be wasted!!!

When I think of the cast which has been assembled by Director Mark Piznarski, I bury my head in shame for all involved. This is the epitome of a wasted opportunity, as many of the cast deserve so much better than this. Whilst Sobieski turns in another fine performance, it is evident from her subtle facial expressions that even she fell prey to boredom throughout the filming of the feature. Personally, I feel that Sobieski has already proved her worth by delivering standout performances in recent features such as 'Roadkill' and 'Uprising'. Seriously, 'Here on Earth' is the type of film which can harm a career and I hope it is the last time we see Sobieski in such a predicament.

On the other hand, Chris Klein leaves a lot to be desired. Whilst his performances in 'Election' and the 'American Pie' movies were charismatic, his performance as Kelley Morse is a dud! There is literally no expression on his face 90% of the time and the chemistry between Sobieski and him is 100% non-existent. There is one particular scene which will have you cringing in embarrassment (and which I am sure Klein will regret for the rest of his life) and that is a scene where Klein is attempting to dance in a barn.

Josh Hartnett and Bruce Greenwood also feature in 'Here on Earth' and are further examples of wasted talent. Hartnett does his best to inject some life into his character, and succeeds as best as he can given the confines of the script. Greenwood on the other hand, a screen veteran, has no business dabbling in teen cinema and it is an embaressment to see him lower his standards for this feature.

At the end of the day, I really could not find anything redeeming about 'Here on Earth' and therefore cannot recommend this DVD outside its core demographic, i.e. teenage girls.",1107129600,3,3048,4.542805100182149

So predictable, so done before a million times, corny as a cartoon, with completely predictable story lines.  How many times do we have to watch a rich, spoiled kid (Chris Klein) steal the girl (Leelee) away from the true Knight in Shining Armor (Josh Harnett).  Perfect example is A WALK TO REMEMBER with Mandy Moore as the terminally ill babe who falls for the no-no bad guy.  Same story here, just different actors... And anyone remember Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, or for that matter, any other Molly Ringwald movie back in the early 1980s??  At least Molly was quirky and a fun actress to watch.  It's all been done before, except this time the actors are very unlikeable, their performances unmemorable.

First there's Harnett playing a slack-jawed yokel.  I think the emotion he's trying to convey is his undying love for Sam (Sobieski's character), however, he just comes across as a rather dim bumpkin.  Although Chris Klien has an awesome physique, he seems to be capable of only two facial expressions. And Sam (Sobieski) is a typical Mary Sue kind of character with long luxurious blonde hair that looks great regardless of the circumstances and who is nauseatingly sweet and dewy eyed throughout the entire movie.  She is simply too good to be true.  The writers of this movie should NEVER be allowed to inflict their ""skills"" on the movie going public ever again.  The only saving grace I felt toward this movie was that I saw it on TV and did not waste money on a ticket to see it in a theater.",1096761600,,974,4.5

The  script is unbelievably bad - cliche-ridden and just generally awkward and uninspired and bland - no one talks in real life like these people do. The noteworthy thing about ""Here On Earth"" is the number of good actors trapped in it.  Two of the leads, Leelee Sobieski and especially Josh Hartnett, do the best they can, but their characters are unsympathetic (yes, even Hartnett's character, who's sweet but basically not very bright); however as the third member of the love triangle, and ostensibly the ""hero"" of the story, Chris Klein does not remotely possess either the acting skills or the good looks required to pull off his role of a spoiled preppie.  Just the first five minutes of the movie reveal what a bad actor he is here, and if you can make it past that, the scene of him watching his college graduation from afar, while reciting the boring valedictory speech (complete with a Robert Frost quote!) he was supposed to give, will have you laughing out loud at the utter lameness of it (of course this is when Leelee first starts to fall for him - yeah, right...).  On the other hand, the scene of Leelee dancing around the kitchen while making breakfast for her ""new true love"" will have you running for your barf bag.  On the up side, at least it's nice to see actors like Bruce Greenwood, Annette O'Toole and Michael Rooker, but they are completely wasted in this movie, although what little they have to do they do very well.  The three main characters are written so simplistically, they just wind up seeming self-centered, stupid, and totally unworthy of the viewers' interest.  The faux-""Footloose"" score is also annoying.  I would highly recommend NOT buying this movie - it's resemblance to real life is nonexistent, which is ironic given the title.

This is an instant classic from the profitable teen cheese factory and delivers like a charm to those who LOVE teen weepies.  (For us others, we'll just suffer in silence, or, as I did, laugh really hard.)  The requisite ingredients - love triangle, terminal disease, poor boy/rich boy - push the plot along in the most predictable way imaginable.  Sam (Lelee Sobieski) and Jasper (Josh Hartnett) are happy in love, a superstar couple in their small town until Kelley (Chris Klein), the wealthy, out-of-town snot, comes crashing into the diner owned by Sam's parents.  As a punishment, he must rebuild the diner but with the help of our buddy Jasper, who also had a hand in the crash.  Before long, Sam eyes that hunky Kelley because, hey, who wouldn't fall for a mysterious rich kid?  While the two boys wage their testosterone war, Sam discovers she has cancer.  Uh-oh!
This movie is a big disappointment because it fails to capitalize on a relatively talented cast and a pseudo-inspiring story.  Rather than developing characters instead of caricatures, the filmmakers opted for the easy, fast cash route.  As a result, the dialogue seems to be spun from a 13 year old's soap opera fantasy, befitting of the target audience I suppose.  Nothing innovative or inspiring comes about, leaving the audience with zero originality to warm to; this total lack of emotional investment keeps the movie distant and empty.

He meets Sam (LeeLee) and those 2 fall in love. But there is something in between them, Jasper (Josh Hartnett). I think its a great story because a lot of teens can relate to this movie. Except for the part that Sam gets cancer. But just about every teen has been caught up in a love triangle.

1101965,2,6305963088,"It was a sad day that I decided to sacrifice part of my day to watch Here On Earth.  The film is a replication of every other formula love story: jerk meets girl with decent boyfriend -> falls in love with girl, fights boyfriend -> loses girl forever, old boyfriend not such a bad guy afterall.  The end.
That storyline will be found in cinema till the day an asteroid destroys the earth, which in itself is not a bad theme (the lost love etc., not doomsday).  I enjoy a little pathos through mathos, enlightenment through suffering or loss.  But the screenwriters for Here On Earth hardly have the knack to tell a story like the ancient Greek tragedists (See Aeschylus).
Josh Hartnett, Lee Lee Sobieski, and Chris Klein provide able performances, but then who couldn't for roles we've all had embedded into our brains by so many other better movies (A Farewell To Arms [1932 ver.], Love Story, etc.).  The trio are trapped in a weak screenplay of cliches and melodramatic scenes that would have made Douglas Sirk proud (Written On The Wind).
For those of you who have experienced loss and love together, much of this film may hit close to home.  From this, empathy for the characters' sufferings will give a shared experience to the viewer that can enhance the melancholic enjoyment of the film.  But aside from this, there are few positive notes I can say about Here On Earth, except kudos for these (previously) upcoming actors and Sobieski's ability to imitate Helen Hunt.

1101966,2,6305963088,"I will start off by saying I LOVE Josh Hartnett. He did as good a job as he could in this movie, but the storyline was lacking in more than one place.. At times, the dialogue between Leelee Sobieski and Chris Klein were so corny and outrageous, it almost made me sick. (At one point Klein actually names Sobieski's boobs after two Northeastern states...)
I will say that recently, Klein has proven his great acting ability more than once (think ""We Were Soldiers"", ""American Pie"" 1 & 2), but in ""Here on Earth"" his acting was horrendous.
I'm sure Sobieski is truly a wonderful person in reality, but so far, I've not found a movie of her's that I've liked. Accept for maybe ""Joy Ride"" which has her in only about 30-40% of the film (great movie, by the way).
Josh Hartnett is as fabulous an actor as he's always been, but in this movie, his down to earth, humble, quiet, sensitive character is made out to be nothing more than a jealous, corruptive, possessive boyfriend.
If they expect us to believe that Sobieski's character would choose Klein's rich boy ""Kelley"" over Hartnett's small town ""Jasper"", they should have cast someone more lovable than Hartnett to take Klein's place.

It's a mildly interesting plot, and hasn't been done to death in the usually blah teen flick genre, so it has that going for it. Klein plays a preppy, wealthy, snotty Princeton freshman who hits on Hartnett's girlfriend, Sobieski, one night at Sobieski's family diner. For some reason, two mostly level headed guys start going at each other, and a testerone-filled race down dirt roads begins. To avoid hitting the pedestrians, the two boys end of hitting a gas station, which blows up the restaurant. Not sure how accurate that is, but it's not important. Funny to note, however, that although most of the blame is put on Klein's character for the fire, he was the one that managed to avoid hitting any people, buildings, or other cars. Hartnett's character escapes with very little blame, but he was the one that actually hit the gas station and caused the disaster. Hm. Leelee Sobieski is a fine actress, but this is not her movie. She goes from flirty and boring to sentimental and boring, with very little in between. That might be because she's never given any good lines in this rather mediocre script, but mostly it's just because the characters is boring. Not enough life. Chris Klein gets a lot of grief for being a lame actor that only gets by on his looks (which are oddly perfect). Not so! In this film, he proves the saving point, turning a bit of teen movie yuck into a well-acted picture. He is very, very good, downplaying his good looks and going almost entirely with his uncanny talent. Delightful and suprising pleasure to watch. Hartnett's character is a bit too perfect to be really interesting - he has no flaws! But is well acted nonetheless. A fairly good movie, maybe worth watching once or twice.

Here are some of the things we pointed out: we don't care for Leelee Sobieski's character, whatever happens to her, she is a two-timing bitch. Nor do we care for the fate of the rest of the characters. You can't just jump on a bus without a ticket and no money. You don't just leave your boyfriend there standing on the side of the road.

No, the crew has not reached their goal. This has turned out to be a cheese-ball of a film where you don't like the characters and have no sense of sympathy for what happens to them. There are also a lot of sight flaws in this film, um, hello, the guys beat up each other (yet another flaw, for the first half an hour, the 2 guys are just pounding in one and other's face, as if the script-writer's could think of anything more ""entertaining"") and within the next day their scars are gone.

Leelee Sobieski doesn't really need to act much in this movie, but she's really ugly--since she doesn't say anything of redeeming value (actually no one does), she could at least look good.
Now, what's up with the stupid plot?  Rich jerk comes into town and steals the ""nice girl"" from her low-income boyfriend AND THIS RICH JERK IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE GUY TO ROOT FOR?!  No one in their right mind could think that Klein's character is the good guy here.  In fact, I rooted for the original boyfriend who never mistreated her--if the screenwriter wanted you to root for Rich Jerk he would have made the original boyfriend a girlfriend-beating drunk...and made Rich Jerk less of a jerk.  She basically falls for the new guy in town with lots of money and a flashy Mercedes...what's the point?
My ""favorite"" scenes are the ones where the two main characters start talking eloquently--like when Klein starts reciting the graduation speech he was supposed to give.  It sounded so fake I wanted to barf.  He simply cannot act.
The fight scenes were stupid, too...don't tell me that the ex-boyfriend would merely get into little skirmishes with Rich Jerk when he knew what he was up to.  And don't tell me that the ex's best friend wouldn't have beat the daylights out of girly Rich Jerk when he caught him and his friend's girlfriend kissing.
If you have to endure this movie, watch how Klein starts moving like a robot sometimes (like in his talk with the ex-boyfriend in the barn near the end).  He's very uncomfortable.
Other than shots of a nice convertible, there is nothing good about this movie--nothing!  I am dead serious.  Even the DVD cover is ugly.  I wish I could give this movie zero stars.",988416000,4,1865,4.680981595092025

1102175,4,6305963088,"I was alone when I saw this movie in theatres last spring, and I was touched, enraged, and sad all at once. Although Here On Earth wasn't the number one tear jerker or romance of the year, I did enjoy myself, and I hope you will too.
Set in a small ruddy town off of a prestigious school campus, it's is very much a Romeo and Juliet type of story, with guy getting involved with a girl on the other, wrong side of town. The characters in the school were hard to get along with, and it makes you wonder why she even fell for the jerk, when in truth I found her own boyfriend a much more loving and sweet character. With many plot twists, and wierd sub-plots, I think the movie could have been a lot better if only they had dropped the sickness she obtains.
On a lighter note, I was on the whole touched by the film. The constant repition of my fave poem Birches set a romantic, playful tone to the story, and the lovely incongruencies kept me watching. I completely suggest this movie for a date with a sensitive guy, so crack out the popcorn and pop in the video. Enjoy!",980553600,7,1070,4.173913043478261
1102176,3,6305963088,"Here on Earth got a good cast - Chris Klein (American Pie), Leelee Sobieski (Never Been Kissed) and Josh Hartnett (The Faculty). All of them are good young actors for the young generation. The story could be good - a triangular love romance that could be very interesting. However, the movie per se is not satisfactory at all.
The worst part of the movie is that, the story is too predictable, you could know what would happen right from the beginning. There are no surprises that could attract the attention of the audience. You could imagine what comes next and next and next. This would definitely kill the interest of the audience. Also, the plot is too shallow. There is no detail description of the relationships among various characters in the movie. Also, turns of relationships are so sudden that it just made things look awkward in the story. Should there be more description of each of the major characters, and a better plot for the story, it could be a real good hit.
Chris Klein is gorgeous as always, which fits his role as the rich Kelley. However, the director has put too much emphasis on his surface beauty, putting him in different occasions of nudity to attract female fans, which is pretty bad in fact. Should there be more real acting for him, he could do a better job. Also, his poem reciting is not that convincing at the beginning but he did managed to do it much much better at the end of the movie. He has a real touching voice in that part.
Leelee Sobieski, though said to be the leading actress, was not given enough opportunity to make a good show out of it. Her character was modelled to be attitude shifting, wavering and emotional, but the worst was that they all came suddenly. Audience could predict the changes, but they director need not to be so economical about the details and the background reasonings. Leelee had worked hard in her role, but since the character creation had a natural deificiency, she could not do much about it.
Josh Hartnett, as Jasper, the boyfriend of Samantha (Leelee) was a pretty good character. He could be understood as the more reasonable character and more developed character in the movie. He had a great love for Samantha and made himself readily available whenever Samantha needed him. He was also rational enough to understand Samantha's feelings. Josh's performance is also very promising.
The movie had a lot of good scenery screening, which is a credit to the movie. But overall speaking, it could be much better than it's existing form if we have a more thorough and carefully plotted storyline.",977961600,3,2574,4.696902654867257

This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The ""hero"" of the story was a spoiled jerk who you never care about.  The ""heroine"" of the story was a stalker.  The only decent person in the movie was the ex-boyfriend who you're supposed to hate because he's standing in the way of the couple who shouldn't be together to begin with.
The writers of this movie must have been on some serious drugs to think that this plot makes any sense.
1) Guy messes up girls life. 2) Girl inexplicably stalks guy and falls in love with him while guy treats everyone like crap. 3) Girl and Guy go through some horribly contrived scenes that try to force you to like them.  They don't work. 4) Stupid ""surprise"" ending makes you want to kill the writers because it has no place in the rest of the story, and is just meant to try to make you care about the characters (by the way, the guy is still a jerk -- and you still don't care about her OR him)
Anyway, if I ever recommend this pile of steaming dung, it's because I've gone insane... please call for help.

But when I started to watch it I realized it was a pretty good movie to start.  The director does a really good job of showing the type of characters and their traits, especially in the meeting between Chris Klein's character and the Dean of his school.  I would have never guessed how the movie would end.  The reference to her having a bad knee was a slight foreshadow of the end, but her having cancer blew my mind.  I found myself sobbing at the end of this movie--yes, a guy sobbing--because I had just lost a good friend to lung cancer less than a year ago.  Overall this movie was absolutely brilliant and a very good story.  It teaches one to listen to your heart and not to outside influences.  I fell in love with my fiance the summer before I started college and was thinking about leaving her to concentrate on school.

1102259,2,6305963088,"Mainstream romance movies often get criticized for being formulaic and melodramatic, and it's easy for any intelligent person to rip them apart and make fun of them. That is not the reason why I was so bothered by this movie. The insidious and corrupted moral compass portrayed by this movie is what bothers me so much.

We have a loving, kind, and loyal boyfriend (Josh Hartnett), who gets sidelined by the female lead (Leelee Sobieski) as soon as a rich, rude, arrogant, and selfish hot guy (Chris Klein) shows up and takes off his shirt. Really? Yes, in real-life people can be very shallow, but do we need to have that kind of shallow-minded motivation as the main driving force of a movie?

While the movie tries to portray the rich kid as some kind of wounded, soulful Romeo, but simply having him losing a mother and memorizing a Robert Frost poem is not enough to excuse his on-going appalling behavior. Throughout the movie, he is arrogant and selfish and rude, flaunts his wealth and looks down on others, and then burns down the female lead's family restaurant. Not once did he apologize for it or show any remorse, yet the female lead falls for him anyway. In the meantime, the loving and loyal boyfriend who's a far better human being continues to try to get the female lead to come to her senses, but she never does.

Yes, they say love is blind, but when a movie has no moral compass, it's not only blind but also irresponsible.",967939200,3,1443,4.563706563706564
1102260,3,6305963088,"This film is a genuine five-hanky tearjerker that slathers on the schmaltz thick as marmalade.  The story begins with a rivalry between a group of  prep school boys and local townies that have a reckless car race that ends  up burning down a local diner and gas station.  The judge sentences the two  drivers to a summer of community service rebuilding the diner.  Kelley  (Chris Klein) is a spoiled rich boy with attitude.  Jasper (Josh Hartnett)  is a local hick with a good heart and a bad temper.  Needless to say, the  two boys hate each other.  To complicate matters, Jasper's girlfriend  Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) is developing a serious case of the hots for  Kelley.  They begin an affair complete with dewy looks, running through  fields, stolen glances and every other schmaltzy film technique ever  invented.
The prep/townie rivalry escalates into a love triangle with all  the foreseeable showdowns and confrontations.  Just when everyone is  working themselves into a good lather it is discovered that Samantha is  seriously ill.  Pass the Kleenex.
The film has some very sweet moments  but the story is far too formulaic and predictable.  It has the feel of a  TV movie, which is not surprising since director Mark Piznarski has mostly  TV projects on his resume.  To his credit, the cinematography was beautiful  and his choice of locations was superb.  The overlook scenes were  particularly lovely.
Chris Klein gave an adequate performance, but was  not very dynamic and a little stiff.  I felt that he was much better in  ""American Pie"" playing a more sincere character.  He seems like too nice a  guy to play this spoiled and arrogant rich kid.  Leelee Sobieski was a good  choice for Samantha.  She comes across as very vulnerable and sweet.  She  was adept at capturing the delicate teenage balance between tentativeness  and determination.  I actually liked Josh Hartnett better than I did Klein.  Perhaps he was better suited for his character, but he seemed a lot more  believable as Jasper.
This is a great chick flick.  It is sentimental,  romantic, endearing and sad.  Guys are likely to spend most of the movie  writhing in their seats.  Unfortunately, it wasn't very original and  suffered from too many clichs.  I rated it a 6/10.  Add one or two points  if you like sentimental romances and another if you like a movie that makes  you cry.  A good film for girls' night out.",967766400,,2406,4.850746268656716

I expected  it to be good, but it was so far beyond that.  From the previews  it just  seems like some lame, romantic teen flick but it's so much more.  Everyone  needs to see this movie because they need to realize what's important in  life, not how much money you have(even though I'm sure it makes life a  whole heck-of-a-lot easier), not what kind of car you drive, or how big and  fancy your house is.  It's about the who, not the what.  After seeing this  it will make you realize that you shouldn't take anything for granted, I  know it sounds really cliche but it's true. For those of you who haven't  seen it or don't remember the previews, here's a quick plot review; rich  guy walks into town, flirts with poor guys chick, poor guy gets a little  pissed and decides to race the rich guy. Well, they  crash, blow up a  restaurant and are sentenced to rebuild it that summer.  The story goes on  from there while conflict builds with the Leelee's character(I don't want  to reveal too much).

7898278,3,6305963088,"In summary, this is became a depressing movie by the time you get to the end of it.  .  The movie doesn't completely earn your sympathy for characters with the ending it comes up with, but since it gave me a strong emotional response anyway, it got an extra star.  Don't get me wrong there's only so much you can do in 1 hour and 35 minutes.  Maybe the film could have used a longer cut to make the payoff more earned?

The acting by Chris Kline et al, otherwise is competent as was the direction.
 It's really a problem with the writing.  I feel as if the writers just thought a cookie cutter tragic love story would completely be all that was needed, and that they didn't need to do anything different or special with it. I can't even make a suggestion without spoiling it.  But if you have seen a tragic love story before you know it does not usually end well for one or both of the lovers.

These kind of movies aren't even my cup of tea so you know there is a problem when even the mostly fresh viewer can see the issues.  But damned if still didn't have a tear in my eye at the end.  Maybe that's all a movie has to do, get an emotional response.  Perhaps a more competent script isn't always needed.  It would have helped for certain though.  At least in elevating this to a must watch movie.  As it stands now if you don't want to be depressed, stay away, unless you like abrubtly dour endings.",1521936000,,1402,4.17910447761194
