8031654,5,B0002TK1OO,"Love Hogan's Heroes, but these VHS has some of the best episodes IMHO. Also, all 4 episodes are ""clean"" for the whole family to watch together. (Amazing what they can slip in sometimes)",1441929600,,185,4.636363636363637
8031655,5,B0002TK1OO,This show holds up well despite its macabre setting.  Fine ensemble acting sets it apart.,1405468800,,89,4.933333333333334
8031656,4,B0002TK1OO,"We have lost that era of the funny shows worth laughing at the 60's gave us.  Thankfully we can own the re-runs and still laugh.
The first in this series was the best (included the b/w pilot).",1314144000,,192,4.1891891891891895
8031657,5,B0002TK1OO,Bought this set of vcr tapes as a gift for my dad who was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  He loves this show and just laughs and laughs while he watches it.  Worth every penny!!,1234828800,,178,4.205882352941177
8031658,5,B0002TK1OO,"I bought this set for my father, who during his lifetime was an active, busy man.  He was diagnosed with lung cancer and the shortness of breath made him stuck in the house for the winter.  He died in the spring, but these tapes of the tv series entertained and amused him and helped him pass his long, painful final days.  I've passed the set along to my family now.  It's like a trip back in time...most enjoyable.  Thanks!",1232236800,,425,4.329113924050633
