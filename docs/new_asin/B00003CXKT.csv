1302463,5,B00003CXKT,"Okay, I've got to admit, the title caught me off guard at first - sounded like a total scam (like the Episode II trailer I ended up with). Then I thought about it some more and the more I thought about it, I realized the title is going for that 1930's serial movies feeling... sorta Buck Rogers-ish.  Anyways, obviously it will have to do with the Clone Wars that were listed in the Star Wars backstory/history... Regardless, I know I will see it when it comes out, but I can't say I'm enough of a hardcore fan to go stand in line for the opening weekend.  Will there be more Jar-Jar?

1302637,5,B00003CXKT,"Regardless of what others say, Attack of the Clones is one of my favorite Star Wars movies. And yes, I know more lore than average - so don't deem me a new age fan who doesn't know what he's talking about.
That said, here are some of the things that make this movie one of my favorite:

1- Anakin & Padme romance.
People say that there was no chemistry between the two and that their romance was just silly. Well, I disagree with that. Yes, I think their romance could have been developed differently and perhaps over the course of two different movies and not just in Ep II (Ani as a kid in Ep I does not count - he's just a kid..) or maybe even push the wedding to  Ep III. However, I also think that their romance was a refreshing and much needed part of the movie. Their romantic scenes with 'Across the Stars' as a theme song always makes me feel relaxed, sad, and happy at the same time. Maybe it's just the song itself, I don't know, but I certainly love their romantic scenes - they soften me up every time.
For those Harry Potter fans out there: imagine the romance between Harry and Hermione that we never got - that's how I see Anakin and Padme's. They both have a natural attraction to each other that's circumstantially ""wrong"", but one that would make it very easy to overcome anything that gets in the way - even if it's losing your best friend or betraying everything you have been taught (in the case of Anakin and the Jedi).

2- The Clone army.
I will admit that my love for the clone army comes from The Clone Wars. This is by far one of my favorite eras in Star Wars (the Republic and its clone army fighting the separatists). I remember watching attack of the clones as soon as it came out and loving the moment when they came to Geonosis and fought for their friends and their republic. Their comradery hits some soft spots in me.

3- The acting.
Yes, you read that right: the acting.
Contrary to what many others think, I believe Anakin was played very well. He was portrayed as a confused young boy with an uncertain, yet promising future. He knew he was born for greatness, hence his overly obvious confidence - this makes him reckless, hot headed, and passionate. And I think Hayden portrayed that quite well.
Padme's calmness and adventurous nature was also very vividly portrayed. Seemingly wise beyond her years, she was depicted as the perfect companion for Anakin.
I think the other big characters were portrayed masterfully as well - especially Obi-Wan, Yoda, Windu and Dooku!

4- Yoda vs Dooku
While I would have loved to see a longer duel, I simply love their fight in this movie. I remember watching Yoda fight for the first time when this film first came out. It was such an exciting moment! Count Dooku's style is also quite awesome (watch The Clone Wars if you have not already - his character is more developed",1520208000,5,2849,4.429389312977099

1302722,5,B00003CXKT,"Great movie. The overarching plot is probably the best of the movies. I can sort of understand why some people don't like it. There were a few cringy scenes but they really weren't that bad and definitely aren't what I think of when I think of this movie. Christopher Lee played a great role, as he always does, and the foreshadowing that takes place in this movie was well done",1514851200,,378,4.414285714285715
1302803,3,B00003CXKT,"If Phantom Menace surprised you with its departure from the magic of the original series, Clones makes you feel like Lucas is digging his feet in and asking you to carry even more head scratching moments in this film. I think there is no better film that illustrates an argument between the personal vision of a director and the audience at large than Attack of the Clones.

I think Lucas underestimated the cultural impact Star Wars had made on the public when he released Phantom Menace. He even went as far as to publicly ask people to calm down and not expect more than they should from a movie just prior to its release. So I think he knew he was in trouble after he had made that first film. And to be completely fair to Lucas, no film he could have made was going to touch the magic of the original Star Wars back in 1977 (and to lesser effect the sequels). So he knew he was in a cultural corner where he would take a beating.  What is odd with Clones is how little he took away from the lessons of Phantom Menace. Yes, he reduced Jar Jar Binks to a tolerable level, but much of what bothered people about the first film only seem to jump to another level in this film.

What Clones (and the prequels overall) told me about Lucas, is that he is a great idea man, but only services the material well when others are allowed to collaborate. By the time Lucas began making the prequels, he had acquired full creative control over every aspect of these films and the end result demonstrated he was pretty bitter about that experience in the original trilogy. Like many people do in life, he overcompensated for that bitterness and ignored sound advice to make critical course corrections (even going as far as engaging with die-hard fans). So movies like Phantom Menace and Clones are very personal stories that Lucas tells from his inner eye without any regard for the wisdom of making a movie for mass audiences. I think any notion of making a compromise was something he simply wasn't going to do. And while that might have serviced him well emotionally, it created a disservice to him with the public because he took his angst too far in that process. He would dial that back some in Revenge of the Sith by seeking outside advice (but only through his personal pals like Spielberg).

So the continuation of stilted dialogue, empty deliveries, and odd moments like Yoda fighting an opponent like Daffy Duck feel very removed from the sensibilities of that original series. But the quickest answer to those decisions is to just understand Lucas liked it that way and leave it there. Like Phantom Menace there are plenty of good ideas in flux here, like the back story of Jango Fett; Anakin's ascent into conflict while assuming a position on the Jedi counsel; and the blinding effect politics has on seeing what is right in front of you while trying to cater to everyone but yourself.

Lucas covers some really valid points about that thin line between good intentions and where bad intentions can blur the lines with those less experienced. Lucas does a good job of explaining how the impatience of youth creates huge conflicts in life. He might be using the Star Wars characters as analogies for that, but the meaning is well served and spot on right. So his ideas are quite intelligent and I think he has a great story to tell. It's just the execution here that AGAIN gets in the way of expressing those ideas to optimum effect. What he is saying about human nature is insightful and welcomed here. The very best of people having only good intentions can be made to do bad things if they do not follow the discipline that keeps them from understanding the difference between good choices and emotional ones.

Clones is not a badly conceived idea. I watch this and understand how Lucas got where he's at. But it also serves as a sad irony that Lucas was not listening to his own advice in this story and letting his emotions consume him which created many of the issues in his professional life that not only derailed the critical acclaim this trilogy could have had, but also led him to sell off the franchise to Disney. That perhaps is my biggest take away from this film.",1514419200,,4182,4.539787798408488
1302804,3,B00003CXKT,"Because it's Star Wars I can tolerate most of it, but I just can't accept the actor they chose to play Anakin.

In episode 2 (this one) there are so many problems. The dialogue is so lifeless and forced. There is no character that the audience can identify with. The interactions between padme and Anakin are particularly painful to watch. The actor who plays Anakin it seems like he doesn't have much talent for acting. I know natalie portman is a good actress but i cant figure out if she does a bad job in this movie or this movie is just making her look bad. There's so much wrong, but it is a little better than episode 1. The stuff having to do with the clones is cool. The stuff having to do with the Fetts is cool.

And the rain-soaked fight between Jango Fett and Obi-Wan was flatly awesome. Later on, Yoda was incredible, if a little insane, fighting Christopher Lee. O.K. so he DID look a little bit like a tennis ball, but he was still Yoda and he was still amazing. But that action sequence in the droid factory was hands down the dullest thing I have yet seen in Star Wars. On a more somber note, the Tatooine area with Anakin dealing with his mother being tortured by the Sand People is very gritty and unpleasant. I don't mind Anakin's anger--it's very natural, although it's not great he is partially only killing because he likes killing, not to avenge his mother.

1303109,3,B00003CXKT,"I really wasn't sure what to give this movie, on a scale of one to five, but I'll just compromise with three.

OK. So, Attack of the Clones is the second installment in the prequel trilogy of Star Wars. Still quite a few years away from A New Hope, the film begins ten years after The Phantom Menace left off. Padme Amidala, now a Senator of Naboo, is fighting the Millitary Creation Act, which she believes will push the Separatists, a group of planetary nations who wish to leave the Republic, into civil war. When an attempt is made on her life, Chancellor Palpatine assigns two Jedi Knights - Obi-Wan Kenobi, and his padawan, Anakin Skywalker, to protect her. Still in love with the girl he once knew, Anakin is pushed into a dangerous place, which will make him question his abilities, cast away his duties.... and take him  one step closer to the dark side of force...

This is, admittedly, not the best film ever made (need I mention sand monologues and ""Sorry M'Lady""?), but I still very much enjoy it. While Anakin and Padme don't have much - if any - chemistry, I still feel for them, and want them to cross the stars. Maybe Count Dooku, played by the late Christopher Lee, isn't the most convincing villain, but I still get a thrill out the duel between him and Yoda. Some say the origin of Boba Fett, the galaxy's most notorious bounty hunter, is poorly handled, but my heart breaks whenever I see that boy bring his father's war helmet to his face. The soundtrack is excellent, serving the movie well, and Anakin's first steps into the dark - after his mother's murder at the hands of the Tusken Raiders - are well documented. At any rate, and I will say this a lot, it was better than The Force Awakens, which, while arguably done better, didn't have the decency to take itself and the entire franchise seriously, which, for better or for worse, Attack of the Clones did, and will as long as I pop it into my DVD player.",1489881600,5,1934,4.4576271186440675

There was so much answered in all three prequels.  The worst I think was ""The Phantom Menace"".  ""The Attack of the Clones"" I felt was a big improvement.  The Padme/Anakin relationship at first was a little awkward, but then I got used to it.  I actually think they did have chemistry.  I also thought Ewan McGregor did an excellent job as a more mature Obi-Wan.  I liked the development of Obi-Wan and Anakin's relationship.  I really didn't like the battle of machine against machine, but understood it.  I think this movie served the trilogy well in setting up the final prequel chapter.",1472342400,2,755,4.7984496124031

1305235,4,B00003CXKT,"Set ten years after ""The Phantom Menace"", Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) has grown into an accomplished Jedi apprentice of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) while Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) is now a senator in the Galactic Republic which is now threatened by a Separatist movement led by former Jedi Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). Because of this movement, the senate is voting to pass a bill for the creation of an army for the Republic. When Senator Amidala, who is opposed to the creation of this army, arrives on Coruscant, she survives an assassination attempt. Obi-Wan and Anakin are called in to protect her. They are soon caught up in trying to find the assassin and uncover part of a conspiracy that threatens to plunge the Republic into an all-out war.

Obi-Wan discovers a secret facility where they are cloning a huge army, reminiscent of the Empire's army from the original trilogy! Meanwhile, Anakin and Padme start to fall in love. When Obi-Wan is captured by Count Dooku and the Trade Federation (who are members of the Separatists), Dooku reveals to Obi-Wan that the Republic is now under control of a Sith Lord. Obi-Wan refuses to believe this. Anakin and Padme unsuccessfully attempt to rescue him and end out getting captured themselves. But just as they are about to be executed, the Jedi and the clone army arrives. And so begins the first epic battle in the Clone Wars which ends in an epic lightsaber duel between Count Dooku and Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Yoda. It is here that Yoda senses that the dark side of the force surrounds the Count. But is there any truth to what Dooku says about the Sith controlling the Republic?

This one has certainly got a lot going for it: a complex plot of conspiracy, great action sequences, we see the beginning of the Clone Wars, we see Yoda in an epic lightsaber duel for the first time, and we see the Republic start to build up a military force that would eventually become the Empire. So why is this one the weakest of the lot? Simply because of the love story between Anakin and Padme. It goes on for far too long, taking up about an hour of the movie where nothing really that exciting happens, the love story was badly written and cheesy (it could have been written a lot better), and Hayden Christensen is a terrible actor. I'm surprised considering George Lucas cast the original trilogy so well and now he for some reason thought Mr. Christensen had talent. But despite this there is still a lot to enjoy here and ""Attack of the Clones"" makes a decent entry in the Star Wars saga. Highly recommended!",1456099200,,2576,4.696902654867257

1305635,1,B00003CXKT,"After the terrible disappointment of Star Wars The Phantom Menace came the 2nd Star Wars prequel Attack of the Clones.  It was just as bad if not worse in many ways than the first prequel movie.  I consider it the poor mans version of The Empire Strikes Back.  Its like Lucas made a checklist of things he needed for the movie.  There is a floating city, Anakin gets his arm chopped off just like Luke, the main focus of the movie is on the love story which seems nonexistent, Padme falls in an industrial pit area with conveyer belts just like in Cloud City with Han going into the carbon pit  Lots of bounty hunter references etc etc

Now the primary bitching and moaning I hear about the prequel films is old Jar Jar Binks.  Well George Lucas wisely headed the call of the people to downgrade the character to just a small bit cameo instead of a lead role and the film was still awful.  Mainly what gets me is the dialog and screenplay is just god awful.  Why do I get the feeling you're going to be the death of me.  I found it trite and stupid can you image Alec Guiness ever saying a movie line like that.  Ive got a bad feeling about this clich.

What was the reason for the sand people to kidnap Anakins mother Shmi?  To me she showed little to no value to the sand people at all.  It seemed like a big plot hole in the movie left unanswered.  It would have made better sense if she died by the deeds of the Jedi or the Emperor.  That would have given Anakin motivation to be tempted by the dark side.  There is just so many ways they could have reshot those Tatooine scenes to a greater effect.

Why would the Jedi let alone with the senate accept a clone army they don't know anything about.  It seemed pretty risky and stupid to me.

I always found it strange that Obi Wan, Anakin and even Yoda could not defeat Count Dooku in a lightsaber duel.  But Anakin takes down Count Dooku so easily in the next movie Revenge of the Sith without much skill just swinging wildly like a buffoon.  It would have made better sense to show Anakin use the force to smash objects into Dooku and then cut him down with the lightsaber similar to what Vader did to Luke in The Empire Strikes Back before he gets blown out the window.

I also found it hard to believe The Emperor would let aliens in on the Death Star project.  Palpatine was very racist and did not really care for non humans according to the novels.  It is doubtful he would have let them in on the plan to build the Death Star.

Overall the movie is just really bad, I keep wanting to like this film but every time I watch the movie it  is just awful.  The movie might have been better off showing widespread dissent in the senate so we can see systems trying to break apart from the Galactic Republic.  The love story aspect of the film was like watching paint dry.  There is almost no passion at all between Anakin and Padme.  It was a stupid idea to start the first prequel with a little boy and then jump to a late teenager for the role.  They should have started with a teenager to begin with.
I would rate this film 1 to 2 stars at best.  A thought just occurred to me let us hope that Mel Brooks makes another Spaceballs sequel all about the prequel trilogy just think how hilarious that could be.",1452643200,,3264,4.212903225806452
1305636,2,B00003CXKT,"While not quite as bad as Force Awakens, there are quite a few cringe-worthy moments here, namely the unbelievably bad acting of Hayden Christensen. There are just far too many scenes to list here, but the one that really stands out the most is the highly bizarre kiss scene by the lake, followed by one of the strangest facial expressions I've ever seen in a film. It's as if the entire film is punctuated by Obi-Wan doing cool stuff then back to Anakin being awkard and creepy, leering at Padme, talking back and making a fool of himself, or mumbling out ridiculous dialog.

The rest of the film is a tidal wave of CGI, some of it so overwhelming you feel like you're watching a giant video game. The battle sequences of CG Troopers vs. CG robots are ridiculously hard to follow or, more importantly, feel any emotional connection to. Who cares about any of these things fighting... they're all just pixels in a giant mainframe in Marin county somewhere. No human element means no real connection (think Jar Jar).

John Williams' score is good, unless you're a meticulous note for note fan, and when Anakin and crew arrive at Geonosis, there's a sudden copious reusage of music from the beginning of Phantom Menace. Cue for cue, lifted from the first film. The arena battle begins and it's the same music as the Qui-Gon poison gas sequence. What gives? Why was so much music taken from the first movie?

In any case, there are enough amusing moments and colorful characters to at least merit a couple stars, but this episode was largely forgettable.",1452211200,,1551,4.673992673992674

1305642,4,B00003CXKT,"After the three year wait since the last movie I was raring to go with this one.  I didn't get to see this movie in theaters until about month after it's release, but I couldn't wait to see just how this series was going to continue.  This chapter is to further develop Anakin's continued commitment to the Jedi way in his still as yet pre-Darth Vader days as well as some further information on the Clone Wars and this time the thing with the clones themselves.  While the last chapter proved pretty light-hearted and campy for the most part, this chapter however proves light-hearted in some ways and darker in other ways.  In this review I'll not be talking about the plot to much degree as again I would assume that fans and all others already know it.  I'm going to describe the characters and then talk about this movies strengths and weaknesses.

Now we get to see Ani grown up as a teenager.  He now sports shorter hair and the same small braid on the side of his head that Obi-Wan Kenobi had in the previous movie.  Obi-Wan has now grown his trademark beard.  Padme' is older too, drop dead gorgeous, really hot, and quite composed.  As Qui-Gonn Jinn has sadly been killed by Darth Maul, Obi-Wan took an interest in becoming Anakin's new Jedi master/teacher.  Jar Jar Binks becomes a politician in their world.  R2-D2 returns.  C-3PO is still not fully built yet. Viceroy Nute Gunray and Count Duckoo are still at large.  And we meet not only the Kaminoans and their clone making factory, but also Boba Fett as a child and his malicious father Jango Fett.

This movie's high points are, for starters:  The special effects.  The special effects for the space ships, the politicians meeting room, the light sabres, the planets, the light sabre fights, the big futuristic city, the aliens, and the traffic with the flying cars, were all top notch.

The costumes were awesome here and used implemented a whole host of imagination.  Natalie Portman wore all sorts of lovely outfits including sexy ones.  The usage of pretty colors in both the costumes and in many parts of every scene were sensational overall.

The action sequences in regards to such scenes as the light sabre fights involving Anakin and Obi-Wan vs. Count Duckoo and Yoda vs. Count Duckoo, any of the fights involving blasters and/or light sabres against the Trade Confederation battle droids or the Genosians, also either riding or killing any of the random alien creatures, Obi-Wan's light sabre and martial arts moves vs. blaster and spaceship against Jango Fett, any scene where the clones get to blast the enemy, and of course my most favorite of all the entire Jedi Council stepping in to square off against Jango Fett, the battle droids, and any remaining alien creatures were all scenes of pure excitement and awesomeness.

It was touching to see Padme' and Ani try to kindle their conciliation and romance while Padme' is being protected from an assassination plot against her.

John Williams's musical score is still a work of art giving you more of his greatness with his tense and taut melodies, raw emotion, commercial notability, and more score and vocalized sanscrit.

The characters still show some charm, relatabilty, and likability.  But there's also some intensity and tensions too.

As for the not so good parts of this movie.  Well for starters, the acting wasn't as good this time.  Most of it was, but Hayden Christensen's acting as Anakin was just terrible.  He was amateurish as well as corny.  Sadly, Natalie Portman's acting was this time around, just painfully lackluster.  She seemed to speak her lines without even trying to act, much less feel her lines.  That whole conflict involving the tensions between Jedis and politicians leading to Ani and Padme's romance being forbidden was not only too melodramatic, but it was a sad shame, and it made the movie feel more like a soap opera.  The way by which Padme' is constantly playing hot and cold with Ani's feelings and emotions and coming off as uncaring towards his feelings and emotions was both just plain vexing as it was anger-inducing.  How can one say that they love someone and care more about having to hide the relationship rather than care more about their love for that person?  It wasn't even explained what the tensions and distrust between Jedis and politicians is over.  Also, if the word got out that Padme' and Anakin were together, what would've happened as a result?

I also hated how Obi-Wan of whom came off as a gentle and understanding guy in Episode IV is frequently being strict, aloof, and pushy with Ani.  Why is he acting like a drill sergeant towards him all the time?  Obi-Wan is somewhat hard to like as a result.

Overall, what this movie has to offer is lots of action of all kinds comprising of blasters, light sabre duels and fights, telekinetic force powers, visually stunning special effects, Natalie Portman making for some sensational eye-candy, getting to see more of the storyline leading up to Anakin slowly becoming Darth Vader, the clone factory, the aliens that make the clones, an intro to Boba Fett as a child, also meeting his vicious father Jango Fett, getting to see Yoda be a part of the action, beautiful and well designed costumes, the use of gorgeous colors for the costumes, shots of nature, the furniture, and any decorations in the rooms. John Williams's spectacular score and the further agenda's of the villains being more developed.  While this movie does have its flaws to say nothing of elements that were barely tolerable it's still a very entertaining movie once you look past all of that.",1451952000,2,5608,4.787941787941788

1305758,5,B00003CXKT,"My Journey Continues to watch the 'Star Wars' saga as it became intended, this the second of the 'George Lucas' prequels -
MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU -
Ten years have now past 'Anakin Skywalker' (Hayden Christensen) realizing his dream has developed into a formidable 'Jedi'
an apprentice under the guidance of 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' (Ewan McGregor) though he has become somewhat arrogant.
The Republic is in danger of being torn apart by dark forces.
Senator 'Padme') has travelled to appeal to the council to raise an army to counter the threat posed by
'Count Dooku' (Christopher Lee) a 'Jedi' that had embraced the dark-side, but, who is really pulling the strings ?
A plot to kill 'Padme' is afoot....'Anakin' and 'Obi-Wan-Kenobi' foil the plot catching the shape-shifter hired to kill her, however
before extracting the information, the hired killer is killed by a dart.
It's not safe for 'Padme' to remain, 'Anakin' is given his first lone-mission, he must take her back to Naboo and stay with her until
the threat has passed.
Meanwhile 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' investigates the threat posed to 'Padme' and is told of a distant planet, though when trying to locate
it he finds it's very existence has been wiped from the records.
As his investigation deepens he finds the existence of a clone-army he's told was being created by orders from the Republic...no
record of this exists.
Back on Naboo romance between 'Amidala' and 'Anikin' begins to surface......'Anakin' is having nightmares and becomes worried
about his mother he'd not seen for 10 years, he with 'Padme' go back to his homeland to check things out, though doing so is
against a directive given to him by 'Obi-Wan Kenobi'
Meanwhile as the threat grows Supreme Chancellor (Republic) 'Palpatine' (Ian McDiarmid) reluctantly agrees the formation of an
army to counter the threat now posed.
Meanwhile 'Obi-Wan Kenobi' now a prisoner of Count Dooku' after following 'The Bounty Hunter' to the planet where the plot
was being orchestrated from, he now needs 'Anakin's' help.
The odds are formidable, a massive force has been created, can the Republic survive the threat posed and again, who is really
in control ?
The film see's a greater and more significant role for Jedi-Master 'Yoda' (voiced by 'Frank Oz') and indeed the robots 'R2-D2' and
'Anakin's' early creation C-3PO.
'Attack of the Clones' has a stronger story-thread than 'The Phantom Menace' in truth and also embraces a greater use of Special
-Effects enhancing both the visual sets and indeed the brilliant battle and fight sequences.

1305854,3,B00003CXKT,"Coming off of the one of the most despised films of all time, George Lucas gives us this treat of boring romances, and politics..IN SPACE!! To be fair, this is a huge step up from Phantom Menace, but it's still also a huge step down from any of the original trilogy. This is a boring movie at times. The romance between Anakin and Padme is so awkward, and forced, while also being so uninvolved thanks to some delightfully wooden acting. It just doesn't work, and makes Anakin's eventual fall to the dark side, a dissapointment. He's a whiny child! He should be cocky and a bit power hungry, while having a huge emotional need. He's a Jedi, he should be trying to fight against falling in love with Padme, but when he loses his Mother, that should've been the breaking point. The point where his pain is so vast and great, that expressing his love for Padme, and she in turn also expressing her love, fills the gap left, and makes him happy again. but no, he instead slaughters the Sand people, and whines to Padme about how he'll stop everyone from dying, making me wonder, how he ever got into her pants afterwards. He's clearly a bit crazy, and sociopathic, go make out with Obi-Wan instead! Speaking of Obi-Wan, he's perhaps the most positive thing in the entire prequel trilogy. Ewan McGregor is so good as Obi-Wan, that it makes me so sad, that he couldn't have been in a better movie. He captures the spirit of Alec Guiness so well, that I  legitimately believe that he is Obi-Wan Kenobi. On other positives, the action scenes are really good, in particular the arena scene with the three beats. It's a great scene, with some really cool creature design. and to see Yoda, finally using a lightsaber is quite amazing, and awesome. Back to the negatives, this movie can be really slow at times, the previously mentioned romance stuff, and of course the majority of the acting. It can be so wooden, I believe that most of the cast members were created in a computer. And as for that, yeah this is a CG-fest. Just go with it at this point, it could be far worse than it is. In conclusion, this a better movie than Episode I, but it still lacks the charm and spectacle of the originals. Watch at your own risk.",1449705600,,2212,4.475247524752476

reasons? 1 bad CG. not only are many scenes way too busy, but the color tones used are jarring.

2 bad transitions. there was one point where I honestly didn't know if we were on Tattooine, or Geonosis.

1306539,4,B00003CXKT,"This is the 2nd installment of the Star Wars franchise- Attack of the Clones. It continues where the 1st installment, The Phantom Menace, concludes.  Anakin, now a young man (probably 17 or 18), is progressing rapidly in his Jedi training, and although he is brilliant with his lightsaber and as a pilot, is very much an arrogant, headstrong, and often argumentative pupil, much to the chagrin of Obi-Wan. Padme Amidala has grown up into a gorgeous young woman, and the former Queen of Naboo now occupies a seat in the galactic senate. All is not well in the galaxy though, as a dark shroud that is the dark side of the Force has clouded and obscured the Jedi Master's insight into the mysterious inner workings within the Republic, and the strengthening of the Separatists droid army and Trade Federation has plunged the galaxy into economic and political strife, with many star systems dissenting to join the Trade Federation. In like fashion, Anakin and Obi-Wan are tasked with protecting Senator Amidala after an assassination attempt. In a unique turn of events, Anakin is given the responsibility of protecting Padme after Obi-Wan is send on a Knight's errand by the Jedi Order to trace the suspected assassin back to Kamino, where Obi-Wan discovers a decades-old secret plan by the Republic and Jedi Order to build an army of clones to protect themselves from the Separatists.

This movie is a lot different than the first. There's more lightsaber and epic battle scene action, more drama (as in an unfolding romance between Anakin and Padme), a somewhat jumbled-up story line with Hayden Christensen (Anakin) slowly but surely coming under the influence of the dark side with his inability to control his feelings (and his preoccupation with Padme). The acting is a little stale at times, and there's a cheese-factor sometimes, but it's somewhat classic Star Wars. Overall, it's a good movie. I don't give it 5 stars simple because it didn't feel like a great movie. It's still Star Wars though! Love it.",1435449600,,2012,4.932153392330384

But all that did not help. The movie is just as terrible. Thankfully that annoying child (young Annakin) is gone, but he has been replaced by what must be the worst actor in centuries. If one were to replace him with just with a photo of David Hasselhoff, that would be better acting. And I don't consider David Hasselhoff a good actor.

#1. Obi-Wan Kenobi is trying to track a bounty-hunter (Jango Fett), who has TWICE attempted to kill Padme.

#2. His investigation deduces that Jango lives, or at least comes from, a planet called Kamino. Its location, and existence, has been SECRETLY deleted from the archive memory.

#3. While on Kamino, Obi-Wan learns that a Jedi master ordered a clone army for the Republic. However, the order was put in well AFTER said Jedi master had died.

#4. He also learns that this clone army was created by the DNA of the wanted bounty hunter who has tried to kill Padme.

Now, it's egregious enough that Obi-Wan failed to relay the information about the clone army's DNA to the Jedi council. But the mere fact that Yoda, the wisest of all Jedi, decided to personally retrieve the army himself and bring it to fight the separatists. No red flags came up, knowing that this was ordered by a dead Jedi?

They do know whose DNA was used to create the clone army, right? Obi-Wan did tell the Jedi about Jango's affiliation with the separatists, right?

Honestly it's a lot more boring than i remembered when seeing it in the theater, also the last time I saw it. Hayden's acting in this one is also much worse than i remembered. I mean wow, he must have taken a little bit of lessons before Ep III filming because he doesn't seem THAT bad in that film. Some entertaining action sequences make it a little easier to watch but at about 2 and a half hours there are not enough of them to make much of a difference. Then there's the ""romance"" scenes where we see a pretty young lady inexplicably fall in love with a wooden plank. Unfortunately this side story takes up a huge chunk of the first two thirds (maybe?) Of the film. Next, as cool as Jango Fett is I feel like his inclusion in the film is just a kind of fan service so we can see baby Boba. I mean the clones could have been made from any badass bounty hunter or skilled person. Still not as bad as the useless Chewbacca scene in Ep III. Well long review short.

Deception, comes not in the expected obvious form, nor is it represented by only those who are a little more than, 'shady'. Lust for power, a seared conscience and prideful selfishness to rule and reign, are the under currents for rebellion and the usurping of decency and the established order. Simultaneously, the Jedi Knight in-training, young Anakin Skywalker, is starting to show a little too much ambition and unnerving independence which is being noted by not only his Jedi training master Obi-Wan Kenobi, but also by various members of the discerning Jedi Counsel, as well. And to make matters worse, Anakim Skywalker finds himself increasingly attracted to a woman, that a Jedi Knight in training, should not be interested in. And, the Galactic Senate places it's ruling body in the hands of one senator, supposedly only temporarily. Meanwhile, clones are secretly being made and programmed for the utter destruction of all the good, within the now..., troubled galaxy. Lots and lots of fast paced action and adventure, in this second part of the STAR WARS saga that comes in this 2 disc, DVD set, officially entitled: STAR WARS/ATTACK OF THE CLONES.

1306812,1,B00003CXKT,"This is an awful movie, and there are no two ways around that.

My 5 year old summed it up the first time we watched this movie together.  Half way through he asks - ""who is the bad guy?""  ""where is Darth Maul/Vader?"".  Yes, half way through the prequels and there is really no ""bad guy"", not to mention no one you really care about that's good.  Ewan McGregor is clearly a great actor, but the Jedi's, as characters, are as much fun as accountants in the prequels.

Enough has been said about the painfully awkward love scenes in this movie, but just for kicks -->  try and contrast these scenes with how ESB builds Han & Leia's relationship.

I could go on and break apart how awful every aspect of this film is, but let me cut to my biggest complaint......it could have been so much more.  The gross incompetence of spending this much money to make a film this bad is overwhelming.  You have the GDP of a decent sized nation to build a film and (based on how the new Star Wars movies are coming together) every talented director and writer with pulse dying to work on these films.....and you screw it up this bad.  I've seen ""making of"" documentaries for the Star Wars prequel where people are praising Lucas for his genius, and I'm hoping psychologists and history can use these tapes to figure out how brown nosers function to destroy projects like this.  It's absolutely astounding that no one could stand up and ask the same questions my 5 year old did.

1306916,3,B00003CXKT,"After the first movie didn't live up to my expectations, I was wondering what I would think of seeing Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones again.  I am surprised to say it might be the best of the new trilogy, which isn't saying much.  It's still got issues, but it is still entertaining.

It's been ten years since we last checked into that galaxy far, far away.  Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is now a young man, the Jedi apprentice of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor).  The two have been given a new assignment, to protect Senator Padme (Natalie Portman).  This makes Anakin very happy since he still has a crush on the woman.

After two attempts on her life is rapid succession, the two Jedi split up.  Obi-Wan begins to track the assassin and discovers a project that has been building for 10 years.  Meanwhile, Anakin goes with Padme back to Naboo where she goes into hiding.  With few people around, Anakin tries to woo her.  Will he succeed?  And what will Obi-Wan uncover?

This movie has two stories running simultaneously, and it's those two stories that provide the conflicts in quality in this film.  On the one hand, there's the political intrigue as Obi-Wan tries to get to the truth behind the assassination attempts.  This part of the film is pretty good with a story that is interesting and provides a few nice surprises.  It also provides some amazing fight sequences that are thrilling even if you watch them twice in a row.  (I know; I did this last time.)  I'd even put the sub-plot about Anakin's mother into this part.  It seems a little forced into the movie, but it does provide some much needed character development.

Then there's the romance.  And here is exactly where the movie falls apart.  The writing is beyond cheesy and cliched.  You can't help but laugh at how bad some of the dialogue is.  And it's not helped by the acting.  Hayden Christensen is only adequate at best, and anything that requires much emotion from him just winds up coming across as forced.  The problem is partially the acting since even Natalie Portman has some trouble with her lines.  And, frankly, I never believe the development of the love story.  It all seems forced and rushed.  Then there's the fact that the age difference between the two established in the first movie has completely disappeared.

Honestly, the entire movie is riddled with poor writing at times, it's just most obvious in the romantic scenes.  The actors do a pretty good job of covering up for this weakness, although there are occasional cracks in all their performances.

I will say the special effects are better than in the first movie.  A couple of times, the CGI looked dated, but for the most part I bought everything I was seeing on the screen.  Amazing how far they came in those three years, isn't it?

And once again, I've got to plug the fight and action scenes.  They are completely enjoyable and very well choreographed.  You might even be on the edge of your seat a few times watching them.  It's worth watching the movie for them alone.

While I did enjoy this more than the previous movie in the series, Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is still only an average movie.  The bad romance weakens the great action too much.",1430697600,,3246,4.626315789473685

But, Anakin's whiny acting, Jar Jar, and the lack of any kind of edginess that drew me into A New Hope was long since lost before the second trilogy came out. Now, I know there are legions of fans who love anything Star wars, but this one just didn't do it for me. Frankly, I bought it because, well, I love Star Wars, and always will. So, I'm willing to yet again pony up the bucks for another version of this same old crappy Attack of the Clones I've bought a half dozen times before. All in all, I can't whine - not like I didn;t know what I was buying, but as a film, I still find myself fast-forwarding through any scene with Padme and Whiny-kin Skycrappyactor.

1307154,3,B00003CXKT,"With Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones, I have a simple motto: Every scene that doesn't include George Lucas's terrible romantic dialogue or Hayden Christensens absolutely horrible acting is a solid scene in my book.
Let me start off by saying that since Episode I, George Lucas has improved in many areas. Character development is NOT one of them. I still don't care for any of these character's. Anakin is supposed to be the compelling main protagonist that you should root for, but instead I can't stand him!
Hayden Christensens acting in this film is beyond horrible. What was Lucas thinking when he cast this kid?! Lucas choose him over Paul Walker and Leonardo DiCaprio! Is he completely incapable of casting an actor to play Anakin that doesnt completely suck!?
Hayden Christensens delivery of dialogue in this film is so horrible that most of the time I genuinely can't figure out what mood he's in. When he's not whining, he's mumbling his dialogue in the same tone, so I can't tell if he's being sarcastic or trying to make a joke or is jealous or cross. I can usually tell when he's happy because he has a smile on his face, but that's about it. It's baffling how bad he is!
Even if Lucas had cast Leo or Paul Walker in the role, it still wouldn't be that good because the dialogue, for the romantic scenes at least, is painfully bad! It makes you question if Lucas has ever had a deep conversation with another human being before in his life. He probably wrote this dialogue after a long day of sitting by the computer, working on CGI effects for The Phantom Menace(in other words, the entire movie.) Anakin openly tells Padme that he has dreamt about her every day for the last 10 years(in what is literally like their third scene together! Not that it would be any less creepy if he waited until later to tell her that.)
Now there was another screenwriter for this film, so you can argue that maybe he wrote this terrible dialogue, not Lucas. But I know thats not true because the dialogue is just like it was in Episode I(which was solely written by Lucas), only this time a lot worse!
However, when the film isn't focusing on that stuff, it's actually a good movie. The clone plot line is interesting. I really enjoyed Obi-Wan's fight with the Fett's in the asteroid field. The arena battle was also a lot of fun.
The plot in this film is a big improvement over The Phantom Menace. Lucas has a story to tell and he tells it. I know that's not high phrase, but it's a lot better then that of Episode I. Again, this might be the result of the film having a second screenwriter, but Lucas alone is credited for Story.
Although I enjoyed most of the action scenes, the lightsaber fight at the end, which don't get me wrong is a solid fight, does bring up another problem I have with the entire prequel trilogy, which is Lucas as a director. This mostly apples to lightsaber fights. During Anakin's fight at the end with Dooku, there's a part when Anakin cuts the electrical wire and the lights go out. A lightsaber fight in the dark is an amazing idea, and while Lucas does provide one awesome shot of the two holding their lightsabers up in the darkness, that shot is only like 1 or 2 seconds long. The rest is close up's of their faces while their swinging their lightsabers at each other(?!) and then 5 seconds later they go back into the light. If your going to make them fight in a very stylish way, at least TRY to make the most of this. Scenes like that were a missed opportunity and could have been done a lot better in the hands of another director.
Lightsaber fights not living up to their potential aside, Lucas does provide us with many fun scenes, including the asteroid chase and the arena battle. Anakin fighting with two lightsabers is also cool, if brief.
Then, Lucas pulls the rug from under us when Yoda takes out his lightsaber for the very first time. The shot of him simply pulling it out is every bit as epic as it should be, which makes me realize that while Episode II is still light-years away from being perfect, it's definitely a step in the right direction for Lucass story from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.",1426377600,2,4170,4.452287581699347

Directed by George Lucas

Attack of the Clones , in my most humble of opinions, is the crowning achievement of one George Walton Lucas. He took Star Wars way back to it's roots. It's the most stylized and theatrical offering in the entire saga. Hell, the title alone screams B-movie scifi flick. It's a tribute to GL's childhood and is one of my favorite movies of all-time.

Story

The movie starts off with a bang, in traditional Star Wars fashion. Senator Amidala, the former Queen is the apparent target of an assassination attempt. She's spear-heading a group of senators who are against the creation of an ""ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC"", which would induce the gears of War into turning and give the Separatist exactly what they want.

She's suspects expatriated jedi and now leader of the Sepaeratist movement; Count Dooku is the person responsible for the act, but the Jedi in their arrogance dismiss her opinion as crazy talk and offer a less grandiose explanation; Spice Miners did it!

Never the less it is apparent that Padme's life is in danger, and she is in need of protecting. The slick Palpatine realizes that this is his opportunity to play match-maker and give Anakin exactly what he wants. So he reccomends that Obi-Wan be placed in charge of her safety. Yoda gives him the evil eye, because Yoda knows that Palpatine is up to no good. Maybe the force became unclouded for a couple seconds, but Yoda knew in that instant that something was up.

Anakin is so nervous when he sees her. He doesn't really know what to say to her. He's been in love with her since he was nine, and he probably has only seen her from a distance, if at all since. This is why attachment is forbidden for a jedi.......this is why Anakin was too old to begin the training.......Jedi's can't fail. What I mean by this is that if a Jedi fails to go by the book, then he can use all the knowledge and power he or she's accumulated over time for misdeeds and invoke a lot of havoc. The Jedi should never EVER allowed Anakin to become a jedi, especially knowing he had attachment and fear issues to start with. It was too late to completely deprogram him.

Back to the story.

Anakin is trying so hard to impress Padme: ""We will catch the killer, I promise you."" And it comes through as forced and clumsy, and that's by design. He's no casanova. He's a celibate jedi, who's been thrown back into the world of the woman he adores........and he's a teenager. The internal conflict is killing him. Anakin is between a rock and a hard place.

Later that night, there's another attempt on Padme's life, but thanks to Anakin, the attempt is thwarted. Obi-Wan recklessly jumps out of a window, onto a droid that'll lead him god knows where, and Anakin is off to the races. It's an exciting sequence, that only gets more and more pulse-pounding.

Anakin grand theft autos a car and rescues Obi just as the droid he was clinging onto for dear life goes up in smoke, by its' dispatcher no less. This person, this bounty hunter was apparently hired by Jango Fett. Perhaps Jango did this, because he wanted his name being left out of it.

The Jedi are now in hot pursuit of the Bounty Hunter. Anakin let's his arrogance blind him, and he loses the Bounty Hunter's tail. So what does Anakin decide to do? Something even more arrogant and even more brash. He uses the force, or something to time his jump just perfect and lands on the BH's speeder just in the nick of time. There's a struggle, but eventually Anakin is able to cause the speeder to crash land, and now it's a foot race.

I love the next sequence to death.

Anakin and Obiwan track her to a bar. So what does Obiwan do? He goes to the bar and gets a drink. Wow. That was unexpected. Anakin is canvassing the bar, looking for any trace of the BH and Obi is livin it up. It's a moment that sort of takes you out of the film, but in a fun way. It's an obvious ploy by Obi, and it works to perfection, with the amputation of the BH's limb as she's about to strike a seemingly unsuspecting Obi-Wan Kenobi. The BH is neutralized so Anakin and Obiwan take her outside for interrogation. But just before they leave......""Jedi business, go back to your drinks."" I love it.......anywho......Before the Bounty Hunter can verbalize who hired her, she's killed by a shadowy figure in the distance sporting a jetpack.

""Toxic dart!""

The council ordain that Obi look into the matter, while Anakin continues to watch over the Senator, but in a safer environment. First, however, he must speak to the Chancellor to make it an exectutive order, practically unbreakable.........Anakin knows Padme wouldn't go along with it any other way.

The scene with Palpatine sets up so much, that I can't believe it wasn't added until post production. I'm just glad it was included. It shows that Anakin isn't pulling his dellusions of grandeur out of thin air, but is being buttered up by Palpatine. No wonder Anakin is in favor of a dictatorship.

Anakin and Padme are whisked off to Naboo, which they traveled to in clandestine fashion. Obi assumes the role of noirish detective(Attack of the Clones is very much a detective mystery movie). When droids fail him, Obi falls back on the instantly loveable Dexter Jester for help. Dexter is a cook in a diner eerily reminiscent of an earlier Lucas classic. The lines here have that snap, crackle, and pop of the original trilogy. Example:

Obi-Wan-""Are they friendly?""

Dex-""It depends.""

Obi-Wan-""Depends on what Dex?""

Dex-""How good your manners are........how big your......pocket book is.""

*smirk*

On a side-not, I think having Dex as a side-kick instead of Jar Jar would have enhanced TPM tremendously. He's got a lot of charisma.

*back on-topic*

So Obiwan learns that the dart that killed the Bounty Hunter was manufactured in a planet system called Kamino. The problem is that Kamino doesn't appear in the archive maps. *shocked*

Something isn't right here, so Obiwan seeks the services of Yoda. Yoda has a very Empire esq scene here with the younglings, and demonstrates some of his playful side we all know and love from the OT.

One of the younglings actually solves the mystery; ""Master, perhaps it was deleted from the archive memory"". Eureka! However, only a jedi can do so, and this revelation must mean that the jedi have a traitor in their midst. The mystery grows stronger...........

Meanwhile, Anakin and Padme are on Naboo, and starting to shred their professional personas, and just be themselves. The meadow scene is my personal favorite of theirs. They open up and act completely natural. Very charming sequence, with Anakin teasing Padme, but also revealing something darker about himself in the process. Anakin fakes an injury and they roll around, it's very old-fashioned in a lot of ways. I ate it up.

Obiwan finds the missing Planet, and to his amazement, is welcomed to the planet with open arms. He was an expected guest. Obiwan humors the natives of Kamino, as if he knows about a Clone Army and he's the one sent to inspect them. ""That's why I'm here."" They buy it and he goes on a tour of the facilities. He learns that a Bounty Hunter named Jango Fett is the one who's providing the DNA for the clones, and that a master Sifo-Dyas is the one who placed the order for the Clones 10 years ago. One problem........he was killed ten years ago. It wasn't him!

Back on Naboo Anakin's nightmares about his mother grow more and more intense. He knows she's in immediate danger, and yet also knows that he has an obligation to protect Padme. Padme is sympathetic though, and encourages Anakin to go to his home world to prevent his dreams from becoming a reality.

""Don't look back.....Don't look back......""

Obiwan confronts Jango Fett. The tension in the air is palpable. Obiwan knows that Jango knows that Obiwan knows, and so on. It's just a kickass scene, no other way to describe it at this ungodly hour.

""I'm just a simple man trying to make his way in the universe.""

""They'll do their job well, I'll gurantee that.""

Anakin and Padme track his mom to Lars homestead(after a fun reunion with Watto). Anakin finds out his mother was captured by Tusken Raiders, and is told she's dead. Anakin refuses to accept this and goes on a damn fool idealistic crusade to save her.

Obiwan gets down and dirty here. The gloves are off. It's just Jango and him. He needs to bring Jango in for further questioning and he's not going to take no for an answer. Jango isn't going to be taken alive. So the fight is on. Lucas as such a great eye for action, this can not be overstated. The fight is glorious and tops the lightsaber duel in the film. Jango gets the best of Obi, but Obi is able to attach a tracking device to Jango's ship, so he gets the last laugh.

Anakin finds his mom in a tent, barely clinging onto life. This is some of Hayden's best work. The scene is heart-breaking, with his mom's inability to complete the sentence ""I love you."" before dying. Anakin is sent into a irreconcilable rage. The viewer just gets a little taste of the carnage, but it's a case of telling being better than showing. His confession scene is the single greatest acting display in the entire saga. I felt such a rush watching it in theaters. Anakin is bubbling with hatred, venting all of his frustrations, and admits to killing women and children during his rampage and that's not even the worst part......he revels in it. Powerful, powerful cinema.

Obiwan tracks Jango to a planet that looks very much like Saturn. You finally see some real bona-fide dogfighting in the prequels here. Another fun little romp. Lots of shades of Empire in this film. Obiwan is able to evade a heat-seeking missle and gives Jango the false impression that he was blown to bits. Obi lands on the planet, and overhears just about everything the Separatist have up their sleave. It appears Dooku was behind everything and they are gearing up for War. Obiwan is captured once he returns to his ship and it's up to Anakin to retransmit the message to the Republic.

This developement prompts the Republic to declare War on the Separatist, but first Palpatine must be endowed with the power to make it happen. Jar Jar, the acting Senator of Naboo is an easy target to trick into ""proposing such a radical amendment"". Palpatine gets his wish and is granted Emergency Powers, which he promises to relinquish after the crisis has been resolved.

The Empire is created.

Anakin and Padme decide to defy Jedi orders and go to Geonosis to rescue Obiwan. They encounter a factory of peril along the way, and even though it was a last minute add-on, it was substantive, because it further demonstrates Anakin's jedi abilities, it's not just completely filler. C3PO's antics unnerve a lot of people, but I thought it was humorous and very much vintage 3PO. His side-adventure was another welcomed addition.

What happens next is unmitigated bliss for this Star Wars fan. I could watch it until my head exploded. The execution scene. The Clones arriving to save the day. The multiple duels. The final montage........god it's something that just has to be experienced.

Edit*

So here's the climax. Boy what a climax. The prisoners Anakin and Padme are taken into a Roman Coliseum esq building, where surprise, surprise, their ole pal Obiwan is chained to a piller waiting for them. All three parties have been targeted for termination. Oh, fun! Of course this is Star Wars and you can't just kill them by firing squad......no, that's not nearly imaginitive enough. You have to give the fans and the local Geonosians a good show. And that's exactly what they do. They release not one, not two, but THREE horrible monsters, who are so vicious and mindless that they attack their own trainers. Yee-gods!(Do have to point out something lazy on GL's part; Padme mysteriously gains possession of the key that frees her? I know she's resourceful, but come on.)

So all three of our heroes escape their chains in various forms and have their little melee. Nute Gunray kills me in this scene. He still holds a grudge against Padme for besting him 10 years ago, and he keeps going on and on about ""Can we just shoot her already?"" Probably my favorite comic relief villain in the Prequel Trilogy.

Our Heroes defeat the monsters, but of course, their fates are predetermined.......there is no escape. Droids surround them, and it looks as though their fates are sealed! Not so fast.......""This parties over"" said the Windu to the fly. The jedi are there in full force to rescue our heroes.

I have to admit I was initially disappointed by the battle that takes place in the Coliseum......but it's grown on me. It's another in a long line of fun sequences in the film. The film is just pure joy, a lot of fun moments that advance the film. Wonderful.

The Jedi are outnumbered and despite their gallant efforts, are defeated. Not so fast again my friend! Dubious Clones to the rescue!

ATTACK OF THE CLONES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The Clones take out the droid army with expert precision. The battle is over before it ever began. Truly a masterful display of military might. Also I might add that I was completely fooled in my intially viewing, and believed that some of the clones were men in suits..........they aren't.

The rest of the battle is filmed in a way that is foreign to Star Wars. It's sort of a documentary style, with a lot of zooms. It was a nice stylistic choice for the aerial battles, it really made you feel intimately involved with what was transpiring.

*has eye-candy induced seizure*

The battle is so gritty. So much dust, and smoke, and visibility is low, which is really symbolic of the ambiguity of what's going on: Are the good guys really the good guys? Are we the audience rooting for the right people to win here?

The amount of troops are overwhelming, and no battle in Star Wars past or future top the sheer scope of it.

Obiwan and Anakin find themselves fortuitously in hot pursuit of Count Dooku, who has escaped the arena.......but not with his prized body guard Jango Fett who was killed by the hands of Mace Windu. Hayden and Ewan have a great dialogue exchange after Padme falls out of their gunship.

Anakin- ""Put the ship down!""

Obiwan-""Anakin, don't let your personal feelings get in the way!""

Anakin-""Lower the ship!""

Obiwan-""I can't take Dooku alone. I need you. If we catch him we can end this war right now! We have a job to do!""

Anakin-""I don't care. Put the ship down!""

Obiwan- ""You will be expelled from the jedi order!""

Anakin-""I can't leave her!""

Obiwan-""Come to you senses. What do you think Padme would do if she were in your position.""

Anakin- *sigh* ""She would do her duty.""

Now the dialogue isn't spectacular(though it does foreshadow Anakin's waivering jedi patriotism), but the performances in this scene are.

Dooku leads Anakin and Obiwan to a hanger bay. Anakin is taken out early thanks to letting his emotions get the best of him. Those Skywalker boys have a knack for that. Obiwan is stuck to face him alone; mono a mono. He dances with the devil in the pale moonlight, and comes out on the the darkside of the moon. Anakin recovers right before Dooku is about to make the death blow on Obi, and briefly saves the day. Anakin is again schooled by Dooku, and loses his limb as evidence.

Yoda had sensed something was wrong..........

Yoda appears, and quite a wizards duel unfolds. They force-battle to a stalemate, so what options are left, but laser swords? Yoda's fighting style gets a lot of critcism, but it really makes sense logistically for someone his size wielding a lightsaber against an opponent 3 times his size. They fight and fight and fight, until they get locked up and Dooku pounces on his lone opportunity for escape. He uses the force to set up a distraction for Yoda(a distraction that would have killed Anakin and Obiwan, if not for Yoda's intervention) and blasts off into space.

In my opinion, and I've debated this a number of times, but this scene and Yoda's actions are why he warns Luke about saving his friends in Empire. Not only was Luke not ready, but Yoda knows he made a mistake by not defeating Dooku when he could have, and ended the war......instead he let his compassion get in the way and the war just escalated, and he didn't want Luke to go down the same road. That's my new interpretation of why Yoda was so insistant Luke put the cause above everything else.

So next you have the final montage. You learn Dooku is the new boy toy of Palpatine, if you will, and there's a wonderful scene of marching Clone Troopers and their ships taking off to fight battles in far off worlds. While this happens, Palpatine is watching proudly over them, knowing that the Jedi's fate is now sealed. The cherry on top is the wedding, and the music gives you a glimmer of hope that maybe somehow things will turn out alright, but we, the audience, know better.

THE END.

Characters

Anakin Skywalker- He's not mature. He's too sure of himself. He whines. He cries. All of this is perfectly fitting for a person in his unique position. He's a teenager caught up in a world where he can look, but not touch. There are so many expectations being placed upon him, that it's hard for him to keep a level head. It also doesn't help that his father-figure Palpatine, is breaking down his value system.

Hayden does a bang up job with the theatrical acting style, and he comes through as genuine and has a great command and understanding of the character he's portraying. I love his performance.

Jango Fett- He does everything you wanted Boba to do. He's the epitome of cool. Jango is a first class side-villain. Great lines and plenty of memorable moments. Lucas hit his character out of the park.

Dooku- A character cloaked in mystery, and one who doesn't set foot on-screen until the 3rd act. I thought it was wise of GL to save him until Obi-Wan stumbled upon his little summit meeting. Obi-Wan was unravelling a mystery, and the audience was seeing everything from his perspective. We were right along his side as he was connecting the dots, so it only makes sense that we mutually see the character for the first time together.

The Clones- They redeem the Storm Troopers. Jedi and A New Hope, to an extent, damaged their reputations by making them out to be a bunch of half-brained dilettantes. AOTC counterbalances this by showing them as efficient killing machines, who have no soul.

Conclusion

With the exception a few dialogue problems, and editting mistakes, the film is for all intents and purposes, perfect. It's in my top ten. It's old-school filmmaking with the body of a modern sci-fi/fantasy flick. Love the title. Love it! The best title of all the films for sure.

Lucas does make one unfortunate mistake; He takes out the scenes with Padme's parents. Those scenes may have bogged down the film some, but its value in return would have justified it. The scenes humanize Padme, and let the audience into her head a little. That's what's kind of missing, you know. Padme's feelings are less explored. We know exactly why Anakin feels the way he does, but Padme, well she's a harder nut to crack. These scenes let you get inside her head more.

Never-the-less

1307550,1,B00003CXKT,"The only reason this gets a star is because it is required. This type of putrid waste of time is almost indescribable. The best way to describe it is by saying I watched some ballet soap opera video game based in the matrix. If anyone is familiar with Mystery Science Theatre 3000, you now know the quality of this joke. I will say that Natalie Portman kept it somewhat interesting. However with her figure, she didn't need to be dressed in all of those revealing clothes. Her figure speaks for itself and all of her skin didn't need to be shown to give the movie an edge of sex appeal.

As for the movie, I'll start with the video game graphics. Lord of The Rings; The Twin Towers was released in the same year, so to say the technology wasn't available is BS. It took me a grand five seconds to realize what a joke the computer animation was. Call of Duty, from commercials on TV, has better computer graphics than this movie. Horrible. You can compare the graphics to the old N64 system and still do the N64 a dishonor with the comparison.

As for the soap opera, Star Wars isn't about some teen aged lovers lane. Its about fighting good and evil and the whole movie was based around Anakin trying to win over Padame. I love you Padame. No I LOVE you Annie. NO. I LOVE YOU!!!! And I thought high schoolers these days were a joke. Speaking of sickening plots, the actors, besides Portman, were mostly garbage. Especially Anakin. You can tell in real life he is dbag because it comes through in his ""acting"".

Yoda was another irritating spot. Yes he is a brilliant creature that speaks philosophically, but this was ridiculous. Every other word was Find him you will, or something like that. He didn't talk like that all the time in the original movies, so why is he talking like that throughout the entire movie? That isn't Yoda. The other part is, yes he is a jedi master, but come one. Hey stupid can you be to put Yoda with a cane and then suddenly adrenaline, or something, kicks in and he flying like the matrix? Give me a break.

The matrix is the last part that is the most serious joke. Hey look at me, I can twist in the air and not get hacked to pieces by my opponent that has the same power. Between the matrix and the dancing during the light saber fights, this was beyond laughable. Numerous times I saw one of the fighters do some ballerina twirl while the opponent just stood there waiting for him to finish his dance move and then they continue to fight. If there is a war going on, why would the opponent just wait for you to finish dancing? He would kill you at the first chance he got and all of those ridiculous twirls would get them killed.

Yeah this isn't the original anything and expectations were probably to high to begin with. I said from day one they would suck and never watched them until ten years later thinking I'd give them a chance. Big mistake. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time and money on this. Technology used in the 70s is infinitely greater than what they used in 2002.

You're not a Star Wars fan if you think this joke of a movie is Star Wars. It was phenomenal for the ballet and opera, but not for Star Wars.",1418774400,,3170,4.328282828282828

1307554,1,B00003CXKT,"Lucas has a brilliant imagination.  You have to give him that.  He sucks in every other aspect of filmmaking. The original trilogy was as good as it was because some of the actors (Ford, Guinness) and several of the collaborators had the courage to tell Lucas what was what and force him to listen and make necessary changes. He got by with a lot of help from his friends.  The prequels failed because Lucas was The Creator and no one felt comfortable standing up to him.  He went from being the guiding light to being the puppetmaster.  The confusion, boredom and contempt of the actors throughout the pretrilogy is palpable.  An example of everything wrong w the prequels: Its not that Christensen and Portman have no screen chemistry; it's that there was never any effort made by anyone involved to create any screen chemistry.  Lucas is like a cook who can't cook but expects you to eat his cooking with obsequious delight because he cooked it.",1418601600,,948,4.674698795180723

1307930,5,B00003CXKT,"Listen, I know there are lot of you out there who don't like AOTC and thats very well and good. However, I feel that AOTC was 1,000% better than Episode I. The CGI is a little overwhelming, I would have liked realistic locations vs. CGI backgrounds and sets but hey I didn't direct or write the fim so I guess we'll have to live with that.

Now getting to the story line, This is what Obi-Wan had told Luke about! That he and his father (Lukes dad) fought together during the Clone Wars in Episode IV! Many of us had many theories about the Clone wars and what they were about and finally we get to bare wittness to it! I am happy this War was addressed, we now understand what it was all about! Maybe it's cause I'm a woman, but I did enjoy the love story between Anakin and Padame. Lets face it, if that didn't happen we wouldn't have Luke and Leia, so I'm glad they didn't just throw them together at the of the third movie and have no build up. If you are one of those people who have to be technical about everything then you are never going to be satisfied with these movies and you might as well save your money when Episodes 7-9 come out because I'm sure you won't like those movies either.

In all honesty, this is a fine movie. If you love star wars and you just can't get enough, then watch this movie. It's better than Episode 1 in my book.",1409097600,3,1352,4.136882129277566

As always, George Lucas had the newest and truest of all the technogadgets out there.  He is, after all, the King of Innovation when it comes to camera work and gadgetry.

The movie's only true direction was Luke's quest for knowledge of his father.  As for the acting, it was okay, but nothing to write home about.

1308176,4,B00003CXKT,"My four stars are for this product, the 2-disc Widescreen DVD edition of Attack of the Clones. The cover art is attractive for a photo montage the discs themselves have great artwork. The bonus features are perfectly decent, and the additional deleted scenes from Naboo are particularly interesting, revealing a whole other minor tangent that the finished cut of the film did not really touch. All in all, a nice package.

Now, as to the film itself, of course if you are considering this purchase, you've probably already watched it and formed your own opinions. From my personal perspective, Attack of the Clones is a mixed bag. It has several visually incredible scenes, and for that alone manages to be more watchable than The Phantom Menace. Coruscant and Kamino both look fascinating, and the shot at the end with the Republic cruisers taking off in the sunset to begin the Clone Wars is one of the Star Wars saga's finest images. That being said, this film also has arguably the most cringe worthy dialog and the silliest loopy CGI spectacles of the entire film series to date. And as awesome as Jango Fett looks in his blue armor, the whole thing with this son...

So, all in all, this is a worthwhile release of a film that provides great eye candy. Even though I do not think highly of it as a work of art, I found this DVD set to be worth picking up.",1400284800,,1361,4.551020408163265

Also, the Republic continues to be undermined by insiders because they have been lulled into complacency once again, even after winning a decisive battle that seemingly brings the Republic back to the forefront.

1308420,4,B00003CXKT,"I take it from the number of reviewers who are prepared to say it is beneath contempt that not everyone was happy with this movie. Never having seen any of Star Wars previously, I am now working through the newly numbered series, with this, obviously the second I have seen. I liked it. The romantic interest was simply what one expects and Miss Portman is so good to look at that I can forgive the lovers for not being Olivier and Leigh. For the rest, I assume most come for the spectacle, at least I did, and spectacle there was, in spades. It is also interesting to see how many different body shapes, sizes, and capacities Lucas and Company can dream up and how many ways of speaking they can create to indicate differences in origin. One does have to get used to Space Speak in any of the numerous interplanetary film and television voyages that are commonplace these days. I take it in stride, as I assume do devotees.
All in all, a fine family film, with fun for everybody and no death realistic.",1380240000,2,1003,4.427027027027027
1308421,2,B00003CXKT,"The Attack of the Clones is the WORST film in the prequel trilogy of Star Wars, and that is saying something indeed. The plot is a mess, the characters are now cardboard clichs, and while it can be cool watching thousands of Stormtroopers marching out of a spaceship, it is not at all satisfying. A couple of the action sequences were fun, but it's a pity that Obi-Wan and Anakin's relationship is forced, the excellent Natalie Portman wears a new dress in every scene, doing nothing but moping, doping, and pining, and Yoda is a CGI abhorrence. Not to mention the politics, trade route discussions, federations, treaties, and delegations we have to deal with.

While Obi-Wan is a cool guy, and Christopher Lee and Samuel L. Jackson are good in anything, Attack of the Clones is a forgettable placeholder that should amuse the least demanding of little boys, but those who watch with a functioning brain are likely to come away unsatisfied and somewhat cheated.",1378166400,2,961,4.824242424242424
1308422,5,B00003CXKT,This is a great movie. I had seen it in the theater and wanted it for my home collection. It was just as good the second time around!,1377129600,3,133,3.7857142857142856
1308423,3,B00003CXKT,"In my opinion, this movie is the weakest of all 6 Star Wars movies. Sure, it looks amazing. The effects are great. But the effects are not the problem. The problem is the story. It's slow, it has way too much talking and politics, and throughout the whole movie, nothing is resolved.

This movie also contains the single worst scene in the entire Star Wars franchise, which is Anakin and Padme on the couch by the fireplace. That scene is absolutely awful. The actors are so stiff you can practically hear George Lucas yelling ""and, action!"" And was it really necessary to reduce Darth Vader to a whiny little bi***? Even Padme looks sick of his whining. Put it this way: when watching this scene, I yearn for Jar Jar. Anything's better than all this whining. Usually I just fast forward through it.

Yoda's fight scene was a decent first effort, But I prefer his fighting in Episode III. Anakin's lightsaber fight was surprisingly short. When this movie gives us action scenes, they are good ones. I liked the chasing of the bounty hunter on Coruscant, the fight between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, and the scenes in the droid factory and arena were pretty cool. Of course, the Clone War battle was good as well. Too bad there wasn't a stronger, faster paced story to back up the action scenes. I almost think that Anakin should have fallen to the Dark Side at the end of this movie, but kept it a secret, and Episode III could have dealt with more of his evil deeds before being put in the black suit and helmet.

Perhaps the Disney filmmakers will take a lesson from this movie about how to time and pace the storyline of the upcoming sequels.",1376524800,,1642,4.521885521885522

1308427,4,B00003CXKT,"While Attack of the Clones lacks the emotional depth of Revenge of the Sith,The Empire Strikes Back,and Return of the Jedi,and while it's story isn't as good as those movies,it's still a good movie and is well worth seeing. What makes this movie so worth watching is the awesome visuals. Attack of the Clones is a beautifully shot film. The special effects are beyond awesome. The settings and the scenery are also fantastic. And as is always the case with Star Wars,John Williams score is a big plus. Then the action itself is wonderfully exciting,especially during those final battles on Geonosis. The story and characters are more of a mixed bag. Anakin's flaws are presented well. Anakin's insecurity and tendency to angry are clearly observable to viewer so we get a glimpse at the weaknesses that lead to Anakin's downfall in revenge of the Sith. This is clearly in contrast to the more mature and under control Obi-Wan and Yoda. On the other hand,the Anakin-Padme love story felt forced and phony and Jar-Jar binks is just annoying. The story/plot? Well it's not that great in and of itself but it does serve as a setup for the outstanding revenge of the Sith. This movie has it's strengths and weaknesses. It's a liny 3-4 movie. However,because it was a movie I did enjoy enough to watch several times over the years,I'll go with 4 stars.",1375315200,2,1346,4.756410256410256

Then in the theater, I saw it.  It could have been better.

It was cool to see the start of the Clone Wars and to see Yoda fight.
Even seeing Obi-Wan in action was good.

Padme and Anakin. . .it felt forced and it didn't seem like they were in
love or had a torrid romance.  Every time I saw them on the screen, I wanted
to go back to the scenes with Obi-Wan.  It would have been better with some
scenes where they had met before this movie and after Episode I(maybe Padme
tried to find Anakin's mother or they have gone together on a mission; anything
besides what we saw on the screen!)

I love learning about the Clone Troopers, since it gives the origin of the Stormtroopers, and Jango Fett is one of the best characters of the Prequels (not to mention getting to see Jango's relationship with his son Boba, at least for a little bit, is pretty cool) . Now, I will admit that some of the love scenes between Anakin and Padme are corny, but the overall strength of the rest of the movie ( which includes the growing arrogance of Anakin, the epic Battle of Geonosis, and the 2 on 1 battle between Anakin and Obi Wan, against Count Dooku) overshadows these flaws. Overall, Episode 2: Attack of the Clones is a pretty great movie, it has awesome battle scenes and graphics, and is definitely worth watching more than a few times!",1366329600,4,818,4.423841059602649

1308661,5,B00003CXKT,"After The Phantom Menace many SW fans were raging about how bad it was and they expected it to be the only bad movie in the Saga, but most of them thought again when they saw ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"" but I'm not one of them. ""Attack Of The Clones"" made me fall in love with Star Wars with its themes of war and assassinations, It just felt more complex and mature than what we're used to. The special effects are beautiful, George Lucas is now able to create how CGI worlds and they all look beautiful as we get to see more Coruscant, Geonosis, and Kamino, and every single one of them looks beautiful. I know I'm the minority by saying this but I thought the acting was great, Hayden Christensen plays a confused Anakin Skywalker, Ewan McGregor plays the smart mouthed Jedi Master, Sam Jackson plays a badass jedi, Frank Oz voices the wise but badass Master Yoda, Christopher Lee plays the smart, wise Sith Lord, Temeaura Morrison plays the badass Bounty Hunter, Jango Fett, Natalie Portman plays the beautiful but strong Padme Amidala which she much improved on. The action is fantastic with some huge battle scenes such as The Battle of Geonosis, Chase Through Coruscant, and Obi Wan vs. Jango Fett once on ground and in space.

1308811,5,B00003CXKT,"George Lucas intended the Prequel Trilogy to about Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Amidala.  In many ways it was Palpatine's/Sidious's Trilogy.  A Trilogy about the Sith.  This is how the Sith caused the Clone Wars.

Between movies much has happened.  Sidious has revealed himself to a former Jedi - Count Dooku.  Dooku embittered with the republic, and the Jedi, had eagerly wished to learn the Dark Side.  Sidious had used Dooku to organize the trade federation and outer-systems into a Separatist force.

As Palpatine he used the Separatists as reason for creating a republic military.

At the beginning Amidala returns to Curruscant, and is nearly assassinated.  She'd come to oppose the creation of a republic army.

Palpatine arranges for the Jedi to guard her, specifically asking for Obi-Wan and his apprentice,Anakin.  Palpatine already knew Anakin was attached to Amidala.  By bringing them together the likely results would either be forcing Anakin to watch her die, a romance, or Anakins heart being broken from rejection.  Any of which Palpatine could use against Anakin, to drive him towards darkness.

In the course of their protection duties Anakin and Obi-Wan split up.  Obi-Wan tracks the bounty hunter who tried kill Amidala, and Anakin accompanies her back to Naboo.

Alone together Padme and Anakin can't deny their feelings for each other, but try to fight them.  Each knows that those feelings would destroy them both.

Obi-Wan's investigation leads him to none-republic called Cameno.  The inhabitants are skilled cloners.  To his shock he finds that a Jedi had, secretly, arranged for them to grow and train an army of clones for the republic, to be lead by the Jedi.

From there he tracks the bounty hunter, Jengo Fett, to a separatist world.  Where he is captured and interrogated by  Dooku, who also reveals that he has lead the separatists create an army of their own, a droid army.

Once the republic senate learns of the droid army. they panic and give Palpatine ""emergency power"", which he uses to authorize use or the clone army.

Anakin and Amidala come to rescue Obi-Wan.  Anakin and Obi-Wan duel Dooku, which ends with Anakin loosing his right arm.

Dooku escapes and returns to his master.  He informs Sidious that the War has begun.  Revealing to the audience that the Sith had manufactured both sides of the War.

Anakin and Amidala marry at the very end, which they can't reveal to anyone.  As they knew, the secret will eventually destroy them.  Sidious will use it against both of them.",1358553600,4,2517,4.959232613908873

1308931,4,B00003CXKT,"I think most people would say that Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones is a step up from Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace, but their wrong. Attack of the Clones is a step down from the Phantom Menace. Don't get me wrong I still really enjoyed the film. It's a four star film, but it has some problems including miscasting of certain characters, poor romantic chemistry and bad acting which I will be getting into in my review including the good stuff like the badass and always cool Samuel L. Jackson and the great acting by Ewan McGregor.

The plot of the film follows the events of the Phantom Menace except that ten years have passed. The former queen Padm Amidala (Natalie Portman) turned galactic senator arrives at Coruscant where there is an assassination attempt on her life. That brings in the Jedi council and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) who are charged with her protection and routing out the assassin. During this time Anakin has what I call more of a sick obsession with Padme then love, but I'll get to that later. Anakin and Obi-Wan manage to get the assassin, but is killed before she can reveal anything. That leads to the two Jedi to separate with Anakin accompanying Padme back to Naboo as her personal body guard while Obi-Wan goes to track down the assassins employer's. I have no idea what Padme saw in Anakin, but I'll get to their relationship later. Obi-Wan heads to Kamino discovering a very large clone army and runs into the bounty hunter Jango Fett the father of Boba Fett (Though technically since their clones their brothers, but it doesn't really matter.). After their fight Jango escapes with Obi-Wan following him. While Obi-Wan is following him Anakin gets a vision of his mother in pain, and heads to Tatooine with Padme. Arriving Anakin learns he is too late to save his mother and he boils over in rage killing all of the Tusken Raiders tribe that killed his mother. On Geonosis Obi-Wan learns that Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) was the man behind the assassination attempts on Padme's life, and that he is creating a new droid army, but before he can leave Obi-Wan is captured. Anakin and Padme disobey orders from the Jedi Council and go to save him followed by the Jedi Knights and the clone army. As you would suspect Anakin and Padme get captured and put in a gladiator arena with Obi-Wan. The fight to free themselves, but are outnumber and that's when Mace Windu and the rest of the Jedi Knights followed by Yoda and the clone army show up. A battle begins and rages on culminating in a fight between Anakin, Obi-Wan and Count Dooku, and then between Yoda and Count Dooku. Count Dooku manages to escape leaving a wounded Obi-Wan and Anakin.

The plot was pretty good. The problem I had was with the characters. First Anakin is annoying and unlikeable character. I guess it works if you want to know where Luke gets it from, but he's even worse than Luke. Then there is Padme what is wrong with her. I know people will say love is blind, but does anyone believe an intelligent woman like her would fall for a petulant childlike Anakin who has a borderline dangerous obsession with Padme. I mean every other part of the film she's a strong woman and a good representative for her people, but when she's around Anakin she loses any semblance of intelligence. George could have written their romance much better including the chemistry between the characters which was nonexistent. All right let's move onto Count Dooku who wasn't in my opinion real threatening. I know Yoda says there can be only one master Sith and apprentice, but I truly believe George could have fit both Darth Maul and Count Dooku into the film, and I think it would have worked better. All right that's now that I harped on what I didn't like let's move onto what I did. Obi-Wan Kenobi for one. The character shows he's growth as a leader and a Jedi, and just like I said that the previous trilogy was really about Han Solo the prequels in my opinion are really about Obi-Wans journey. Then there is the expanding role of Yoda which I thought was great and much needed. I think everyone wanted to see Yoda in action at least once. Also again how awesome is Mace Windu? I love the character. The battles were intense especially the one Geonosis. Overall the story was really good; it's just that the character and the chemistry between them didn't live up to the story.

Can Hayden Christensen act? That's what I've been asking myself before writing this review and during it. He does at best a serviceable job as Anakin, but from the films I've seen him in that include the Star Wars prequel films, Takers, Awake, Jumper and Vanishing on 7th Street he's an average actor at best. Apparently he's been nominated for some awards for Life as a House, but I don't see what they see. I would call this bad acting, but more of miscast in the name of Christopher Lee. The man is a good actor from roles in The Lord of the Rings trilogy to his great role as Dracula and the rest of his horror films. He did pretty good job with the role, but he just didn't seem like a good fit. Outside of those two major complaints with the acting and casting I was happy. Ewan McGregor was again outstanding as Obi-Wan Kenobi. Natalie Portman was good in all her scenes except for her romantic ones with Hayden. She definitely didn't seem into it, and wasn't believable. What can you say about Samuel L. Jackson except he was awesome and seems to have truly enjoyed his role as Mace Windu. Ian McDiarmid does a great job exuding intelligence and sinisterness in his limited role as Chancellor Palpatine, and so does Temuera Morrison as Jango Fett. Do I wish they could have expanded his role into The Revenge of the Sith yes, but I understand why Lucas decided not to.

The special effects by ILM were outstanding again including the climax Geonosis. The battle and effects there were great. The only problem with the action I had was the climactic lightsaber battle between Obi-Wan, Anakin and Count Dooku. It wasn't very good and isn't nearly as good as the ones in The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, The Phantom Menace or Revenge of Sith. The cool little battle between Yoda and Dooku did help make up for it a little. The directing by Lucas was again pretty good, but again he could have done a better job especially with the acting of Hayden, and the scenes between Hayden and Natalie. The music by John Williams was good, but is the worst of all the prequels. It just didn't have the same feel of his other films.

While Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones is a flawed film that includes some bad acting, miscasting, and bad chemistry between characters it is overall all a really good film with a great story, pretty good acting, excellent special effects, really good action, above average directing and music. Attack of the Clones is the fourth best of the six Star Wars films.",1356307200,,6946,4.580385852090032

Sure, the dialog is terrible (but that is the same with all the new films) but the graphics are superior to that of `Revenge of the Sith' and the film never lags, at least for me.  The action is perfectly placed and the progression of story (there is a lot to tell and little time to tell it) is nicely edited to keep us interested without cutting too much.  It isn't perfect, and I'm still behind the idea that even attempting this new trilogy (I know, expansion of the earlier so they are complete and no longer a trilogy) wasn't too smart, but I really did enjoy it (I saw it in the theaters twice and own it).  The film's climax is perfectly executed and really does offer up some savvy special effects.  The extensive cast is a disappointment, with Portman and Christensen anchoring this movie in horrible acting, but the supporting cast raises the bar slightly, with McGregor being naturally amazing and Samuel L. Jackson completely relishing the idea of himself being in a Star Wars film (you know he was eating this up).

1309118,2,B00003CXKT,"""Attack of the Clones"" did not leave much of an impression on me when I first saw in the theaters more than 10 years ago. Having watched it for the first time in ages on DVD, I found the movie less entertaining than I had remembered.

Simply put, ""Attack of the Clones"" tries to do many things. It starts off as a mystery, hints at political battles, becomes a love story and ends with a great battle. The breakneck pace and often awkward transitions undermine the film. So does the dialogue, especially on the romantic scenes.

Having been released in 2002, the film's special effects are better than they were in ""Phantom Menace"" though the CGI creations--including Jar Jar Binks and Yoda--pale in comparison to the realism that Peter Jackson had with Golumn when ""The Two Towers"" came out later that year.

There are some fine actors in this film though Hayden Christensen does a miserable job in one of the leading roles. George Lucas needed to find a young actor with brooding charm for the role of Anakin Skywalker. It was simply above Christensen who comes off as sullen and whiney. There are some solid performances from the supporting cast including fine turns by Christopher Lee and Ian McDiarmid. John Williams in excellent form with this soundtrack.  While there are some fine moments--including a  good battle scene at the end and some fun rounds of light saber combat--they are not enough to redeem the film. The movie goes off track in the middle with some dreadful romantic scenes and stumbles towards it ending. While not a total disaster, ""Attack of the Clones"" is, at best, forgettable and underwhelming.

The various documentaries included in the 2 DVD set are a mixed bag though there are some interesting ones. The deleted scenes did little to advance the movie along though there are some excellent clips from Lucas and some of the other filmmakers on why they took them out.",1347321600,,1898,4.771341463414634

How people can hate any of the movies in this series is beyond me. And I find myself relating to Anakin honestly. I always liked him as Darth Vader, but knowing his past made me realize how much I'm like him :) And I wouldnt have known without these supposed horrible first 3 movies in the Star Wars saga. Stories have to be completed, I mean, think of what would have happened if there wasn't a 5th Harry Potter book. Or if the Lord of the Rings the two towers was the final Lord of the Rings book. Either way, I loved it! And I do recommend it to others :D",1338249600,4,1157,4.034782608695652
1309213,1,B00003CXKT,"This is an older movie, released almost 10 years ago, but the bad taste it left in my mouth has not gone away. I tried mouth wash. I tried soap. I tried scraping my tongue with a razor blade. Neither of them worked. I had hope that George somehow had gotten a clue on how to competently direct and write a decent film after the atrocity that was ""The Phantom Menace."" I mean, after all the feedback from die hard fans, angered at the lack of character development, a lifeless script, and Jar Jar Binks, it seems as if he would have listened, or at least tried to improve and make a decent movie. He did get rid of(sort of) Jar Jar Binks, but that was about it.

Lets start off with the screenplay: Swill. This has to be one of the worst scripts ever for a major Hollywood release. George went from taking advice from Joseph Campbell, to Uwe Boll, it seems. How else to describe such a horrible, horrible story. I mean, Uwe Boll makes movies based on video games, but George Lucas MAKES VIDEO GAMES BASED ON MOVIES!! That's what this looked like! A massive video game! The actors aren't bad but given their lifeless script and the fact that they had to perform in front of a green screen sort of took away the magic that was episodes 4, 5, and 6.

And then the dialogue...

An STD in word form (Please kill me now I'm starting to have a seizure). It is so bad it made me laugh out loud, unintentionally. Some of those scenes are downright painful to watch. Its sad that such a creative genius who produced some of the greatest films has fallen so low.

And for such powerful possessors of a force such as, well, ""The Force"" the Jedi seem to get into a whole heap of trouble it seems like they should be able to avoid with, well, ""The Force"".

I put off watching the ""prequels"" for a few years, waited until they becam REAL cheap, then ponied up for Phantom Menace.  I expected much more from II after being pleasantly surprised with the set-up of I to the original trilogy (I guess episodes IV-VI, though I really believe that Lucas didn't have a saga in mind until the obscene success, goodness, 23 weeks heldover at my local theater, of Star Wars - yeah, I know the opening titles of the original STAR WARS did call it ""Episode IV A New Hope"" so why wasn't the movie hyped as ""A New Hope""? - and there was no subtitle on the posters, telling, don't you think?!).  I'm befuddled as to why Lucas had to begin his series with ""A New Hope"" citing technological limitations when these new ones are much less convincing with CGI than the old matte-and-miniature flicks.  Christensen is a loss, reminding me of Patrick Wayne in that he can't deliver a line convincingly for some reason.  At least the camerawork doesn't require massive doses of Dramamine to watch...

...But I'm supposed to be reviewing this package - STAR WARS II ""The Attack Of The Clones"" Widescreen Edition and it is terrific, you just lose too much information in the fullscreen version.  2 high quality discs, feature on one and extras on the second.  I would say shop around to find the lowest price on the first 3 episodes as they really don't add much to the orignial trilogy, sad to say, and look for a better deal on the original trilogy.  I really think Lucasfilm would have been just as well off to put money into some other projects (American Graffiti millenium interpretation or something) than do the prequels - there I go again, prattling on with criticism when I meant to say that this is a nice package of this film.",1329609600,,2321,4.486935866983373

1309361,4,B00003CXKT,"Okay......after the very bold CGI extravaganza that was The Phantom Menace, George Lucas comes back with a film that has CGI taking the place of actual physical locales, and the result is an infinite world of lavish technology. Let's not forget that this can be a liability as well as an asset; my opinion is that it's somewhere in between. An example of an asset would be having a physical location (such as Tunisian desert set) and the actors having a good feel for the environment that they're in, and being able to effectively act there. Another example of an asset would be the CGI Yoda taking the place of the puppet in The Phantom Menace. A liability would be the actors having to transition from a physical location to a green background, creating a dull atmosphere which challenges their acting abilities. However, this film manages to delight for the most part. With the exception of the very poor acting of Hayden Christensen (not entirely his fault) the movie delivers on many fronts, including character development, such as Mace Windu's expanded role as a Jedi Master. I particularly like the Kamino planet sequence, with its darkness and mysteriousness. I also welcomed the diner sequence as a break from the norm, and thought it was done very well. One criticism I have of the movie is the tensions between Obi-Wan and Anakin almost reaching a childish level, especially Anakin being a chronic whiner throughout the film. It's one thing to be difficult towards another person, but to have the other person feel so insecure (as Obi-Wan did) shows weakness from a character that's supposed to exhibit strength and be above such nonsense. Another thing that doesn't work very well is the sudden introduction of Count Dooku as an already established Sith Lord and former Jedi, as if he's been a household name despite never being mentioned before. Sure, George Lucas wants to create characters as he goes along (because you never know when he'll have a change of heart), but it can be a little irritating to try to get up to speed with a guy who's supposed to be formidable and a huge part of the movie. Then there's the light sabre duel between Yoda and Dooku that many dubbed as over the top, with people not liking Yoda in battle, as this may have altered his image of wholeness, wisdom and grace. Well, I happen to love the light sabre duel because it shows that even Yoda had a time when he fought the forces of evil, and did what he could, even if it was physical. Yoda isn't a teacher only; he uses the force for defense as well as knowledge. Finally, there's the love story between Anakin and Padme. This is one weak area of the film, and George portrays Padme as gullible, as if the force itself has swept her off her feet. The result is a sequence that isn't very believable. And why would she have such compassion for a guy who just slaughtered a bunch of Tusken Raiders? Hello, where's the red flag? Overall, the movie is good, and sets the tone for the final episode of the prequels.",1325894400,3,3008,4.624299065420561
1309362,5,B00003CXKT,What can I say about a Star Wars movie other than it was excellently acted and a thrill ride from beginning to end. I highly recommend this movie for all Star Wars fans.,1324598400,2,169,4.151515151515151
1309363,2,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars Episode II is perhaps the most awful of the entire prequel trilogy, simply due to the fact that we get 2 1/2 hours of completely epic boredom. This film picks us up about 10 years after Episode I, where little Anakin is all grown up, Obi-wan and him have not only developed a relationship, but also have done so much together in terms of training that we sadly as the audience never actually get to see any of it, but it is all explained very simply during a 60 second scene with Anakin and Obi-wan in an elevator. It almost makes Episode I completely senseless to have even made (even by George Lucas' mouth, he didn't like Episode I either, as he's said several times). In this film, we follow a ""darkening"" Anakin as he becomes ever so closer with the former Queen Amadala, played by Natalie Portman (who is perhaps the most appealing thing about this film considering all her very attractive and sensuously revealing outfits).
The entire movie follows a political plot struggle between the jedi and the empire, with special effects that took almost no REAL filming or manpower to create, except all being a completely endless (ENDLESS!) nausea-inducing, color confusing flashes of special effects. It's all displayed to be similar to a war movie, yet without any heart and soul whatsoever in accordance with it. What's even sadder is that these action scenes are too few and far between, and unfortunately drowned out by the endless and constant whining and head-ache eye-roll inducing ""romance love story"" between Anakin and Padmay (Natalie Portman).

Shortly put - Hayden Christianson's acting is beyond horrid, ridiculously stiff, horrifically written (which is not his own fault), and completely miscast. While Natalie Portman is far beyond a better actor, she also is dealt with not necessarily bad lines, but a character who comes off as smart in her presentation but is so oblivious to her circumstances that it's a shock she ever became Queen. Her character overall is simply terrible. While I'm glad she's not the monotone robot here she was in Episode I, she still is just borderline likable. To put it another way, George Lucas hasn't the faintest clue on how to write a romance, as this is without the doubt the most terribly awful romance love story I've ever seen unfold. But still, for the sake of the birth of Luke and Leia Skywalker, Anakin and Padmay had to get together.

By the end, this is just completely boring, you may fall asleep even watching it. Sure there are perhaps 1 or 2 (maybe just 1 actually) battle scenes that are pretty decent, but nothing that has any real foundational plot significance to really get you to care anyway. But, if you're simply curious for the continuing story of how Darth Vader came to be, you can watch this one. I mean, for any Star Wars fan, you might as well...",1324512000,,2835,4.7368421052631575
1309364,4,B00003CXKT,"***This review may contain spoilers***

After the initial advertisements and generally condescending reviews, I was ready to concede that the only reason I was going to see ""Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones"" was to fulfill a societal obligation to yield to the Lucas franchise juggernaut and keep abreast of Star Wars lore so I wouldn't be left behind. Well, I left a boring birthday party early and went to see it at Showcase Cinemas in Revere, MA at 7:15 p.m. on Sunday, May 19, 2002. To my relieved surprise, overall, I found the movie to be a well-crafted, intelligent, and worthy addition to the Star Wars canon. I think it falls somewhat short of the IV-VI first trilogy (but then the initial trilogy is beyond emulation anyway), but, as others have noted, it is better than ""Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace"". Even in its own right, as a movie disconnected from the series progression, ""Attack..."" acquits itself well.

As a brief synopsis, as others have noted, ""Attack..."" is a tad slow and ponderous for the first half and exhilaratingly frenetic and dynamic in the second. The backgrounds, CGI work, visuals, other special effects, and general cinematography are superb, especially in the coliseum and final battle sequences. Not once did I feel any artificiality or ""blue matte painting"" unreality. It seemed logically real. Despite Roger Ebert's grumblings of vague, grainy, and obscure visuals, the movie looked bright and colorful enough to me (and I didn't see the digital version). The set pieces involving the ""Fifth Element""esque chase by Obi-Wan and Anakin of the would-be assassin, Obi-Wan's battle with Jango Fett on the eternal waterworld, the conveyor belt ordeal Anakin and Amidala endure in the droid factory, and of course the ""Gladiator"" beast and droid/clone clash toward the end of the movie were pulse-pounding, energetic, and ultimately convincing.

The plot was convoluted and twisty, to be sure, but quite comprehensible if one paid sufficient attention. I agree that the dialogue and other verbal exchanges were prosaic, pedestrian, and dull, but I believe that was so because of the dreaded portent of Anakin's (Hayden Christensen's) future descent into Darth Vader's maleficence. I think neither the actors nor Lucas dared to add any levity to the movie because of this solemn main plot. I admit the lack of sprightly banter so prevalent in the first trilogy was a handicap, but not a fatal one. Also, Christensen's performance was not as horrendous, IMHO, as others had observed. Sure, he was an impudent, impatient whiner at times, but at others he eerily foreshadowed the monstrous villain he would become (as in the black cloak and sinister Darth Vader silhouette he sported on Tatooine). Also remember, although an accomplished Jedi apprentice, Anakin had not yet attained full knight status; add the fact that he is still in the throes of confused adolescence and identity, and I think one could find his willful, arrogant, conflicted behavior quite natural and expected. After all, Luke Skywalker started out as a confused adolescent himself; remember how mature and serious he became in ""Return of the Jedi"".

Aside from the relatively uninspired banter, all the actors performed admirably, nobly and competently, especially Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), Mace Windu (Samuel Jackson), and of course, the inimitable Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz). I even found Anakin's fitful romance with deposed Naboo queen/current Naboo senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) generally charming, sweet, and pleasant, if awkward, but again, first love is almost always awkward and first lovers are usually not a font of eloquence. C3-PO (voice of Anthony Daniels) had some amusing moments, especially during his mind/body switch with a droid, as did the utterly dependable R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), especially during his flight sequence in the droid factory (question: did he lose his flight capabilities in IV-VI?) Even the universally loathed Jar Jar Binks (voice of Ahmed Best) was rather tolerable and even subdued at times, of course considering he had only three scenes or so. He goes down easy in small bites, but how in the galaxy did he become a Federation senator? Count Dooku (the immortal Christopher Lee) was an imposing villain, especially in his unforgettable showdown with an animated ""whirling dervish"" Yoda. I especially found his line ""Obviously this battle will not be decided by knowledge of the Force, but by lightsabers"", humorous; shouldn't it be the other way around? Yoda, of course, is the most memorable character and by now transcends description. CGI suits him well. My favorite line in the movie comes from him (and I paraphrase): ""A planet Obi-Wan has lost, my students. Help him find it, we must!""

In conclusion, ""Attack of the Clones"" is a good movie that generally has nothing to be ashamed of. It delivers on all cinematic counts except sparkling dialogue and competently and mostly seamlessly advances the Star Wars mythos. Star Wars purists will most likely cherish it. I'm glad I saw it and bought the DVD. Good show (detractors notwithstanding)!",1324425600,,5109,5.1432009626955475

1309507,4,B00003CXKT,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

""Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" is a very, very good Star Wars movie and undoubtedly the best Star Wars prequel.  The window dressing and subtle tedium of the previous movie out of the way, director George Lucas begins telling the origins of a classic Star Wars legend:  The Clone Wars.

Returning actors Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman boast better drawn characters in this, their second Star Wars film.  Mr. McGregor steps out of the shadows of both Liam Neeson and Sir Alec Guiness to make Obi Wan Kenobi his own, and Ms. Portman gives a quietly authentic performance as Padme Amidala, the senator from and former queen of Naboo.  As Obi Wan Kenobi trails a dangerous conspiracy involving a bounty hunter known as Jango Fett, his apprentice Anakin Skywalker falls helplessly in love with the beautiful Amidala.  While the trials of Anakin are fascinating(especially a deadly confrontation with Tatooine Sand People) Hayden Christiansen's acting lacks a significant degree of menace and import.  James Franco would have been magnificent in the role of Anakin Skywalker.  The great Christopher Lee joins the Star Wars pantheon of villains as Count Dooku, a treacherous cog in the machinations to topple the peaceful Galactic Republic.  A Star Wars movie is galvanized by a strong villain, and in Count Dooku, ""Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" boasts the series' strongest villain outside of Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine.

Featuring a thrilling climactic battle involving the newly finished CloneTroopers(a striking precursor to the series' StormTroopers), ""Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" returns the entire series to its grandiose original ambition.  The screenwriting is still too pedestrian to equal or surpass any of the original three Star Wars films, but George Lucas reveals enough mature chutzpah and evocative moments that this film is easily the best of the prequels.",1316304000,,1941,5.225806451612903

1309511,3,B00003CXKT,"This episode has a more interesting plot than Episode I.  It feels more like a Star Wars movie than the first one did, but it still isn't quite up to par.  The new trilogy is still hampered by a lack of character development as well as some of the most excruciatingly corny dialogue that I've ever been subjected to.  Anakin was painfully melodramatic and elicited absolutely no sympathy from me.  I'm sitting there thinking ""THIS crybaby grows up to be Darth Vader?"" and I'm not feeling very good about that.  Still very noticeable was the lack of emotional connection with any of the characters (despite an attempt to force some ""feelings"" down the audience's throat in several scenes.)  The scant energy devoted to characterization was negated by having them toss off snappy one-liners at inappropriate times.  C3PO takes the prize away from Jar-Jar Binks as Most Annoying Character this time around.  The deleted scenes on disk 2 demonstrate that there were plans to try to make the central characters seem more human, but apparently these scenes were cut to leave time for a meaningless and hard-to-follow Droids vs Clones battle.  Seeing Yoda leaping around and fighting was almost awesome; I could have enjoyed it if it hadn't felt so WRONG...  Anyway, the plot is almost satisfying this time around, and there's plenty of action, dazzling effects and loud noises to amuse the kiddies.  Really cool monster designs in the gladiator arena sequence.  Not a bad film, but then again, not a good one.  A solid 3-star average.",1294012800,,1528,4.898832684824903

1309651,1,B00003CXKT,"George Lucas' prequels to his famous STAR WARS saga have gotten a lot of flack over the years (much of it understandable!) since they don't live up to the magic of the original trilogy. But, in viewing these films in their entirety, the TWO big things that stand out as to why the prequels are so inferior are (1) Overuse of CGI and (2) Wretched dialogue. The worst offender in the prequel trilogy of these 2 negatives is this film STAR WARS-EPSIODE II:ATTACK OF THE CLONES. From start to finish, the dialogue in this movie absolutely atrocious! And the CGI is all over the place and a lot of it has a cartoon look to it! They permeate the film to the point that it is an unbearable experience. Not to mention, this film seems like it lasts an eternity, just a bunch of scenes that go absolutely nowhere. The underrated, faster-paced PHANTOM MENACE (the first of the prequels) did a much better job of incorporating CGI within the live action and didn't bludgeon the viewer to death with it like CLONES does. Not to mention that MENACE actually had cool, keeper scenes (the exciting pod race and the Jedi-Maul light saber duel) as well as a terrific musical score.

ATTACK OF THE CLONES has none of this! Just CGI, bad dialogue, CGI, bad dialogue, CGI. And to add insult to injury, the central plot of CLONES is an overly sappy love story between Anakin Skywalker (newcomer Hayden Christensen) and Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Christensen has gotten a bit too much flack in my opinion, though, as I think also that all actors in the prequels weren't very good due to the juvenile, monotonous script. I mean, really, were Portman, Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan), Samuel L. Jackson (Mace Windu) really any better than Christensen? I don't think so. Christensen had to play THE key role in the prequels of the young man who would become Darth Vader and he wasn't given anything remotely good to work with in terms of dialogue or plot sense. One minute, Obi-Wan is like a brother to Anakin, the next minute, Anakin thinks Obi-Wan is jealous of him, the next minute, Obi-Wan is like a father, the next minute, Anakin seems like he despises Obi-Wan and all with no solid foundation to build on, just words, and bad ones at that! Not Christensen's fault.

CLONES picks up 10 years after the events of MENACE, with an 18-year old Anakin Skywalker having been trained by his mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi as a Jedi Knight. Anakin is tasked to protect Senator Amidala after an assassination attempt steered by Separatist Leader Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), while Obi-Wan investigates the secret creation of a Clone army on the rain planet Kamino. Anakin and Padme romance on Naboo, then take a detour to his home planet Tatooine to find out what happened to his mother Schmi Skywalker. The film's climax has the Jedis square off against Dooku's Droid army on Geonosis.

Everything in CLONES just looks like a CGI mess. Even the scenes that should be exciting (the climax on Geonosis) are confusing and boring and are injected with cornball dialogue that detract from the experience. Counter this with the exciting climax to MENACE on Naboo where there were literally 4 parallel action scenes going on (Gungan-Droid battle, the palace showdown, the space battle, and the lightsaber duel) and all shown with clarity and supported by a great music score and, dare I say it, ""realistic"" looking CGI!

2. Again Samuel L. Jackson, please no, no no no no.
3. ok yeah so people say, 'oh the die hards all hate it because it couldn't live up to the 10 year plus hype of waiting for another Star Wars...' well sure it can, if it were a decent film. Believe me I slept, like you, ate, pooed, breathed star wars. I had every piece in the late seventies, had every model, had huge sets I built with paper mache into my walls with scenes from Empire strikes back, i was heavy into it. My mother stood in line for 8 hours to get me the original storm troopers action figures, (now unopened which gets 100's if not thousands of dollars) ...oh dear.....oh dear my little ones, I don't believe the mommy's in 2002 stood in line at Toy's R US or slept over night to get Jenga Fett action hero's, but please correct me if I am wrong. Also well where CGI is bringing us amazing things from Skywalker North and the like for other amazing films like 2012, Avatar and the like, nothing has the heart of mini models and camera angels and bravado of creating like the first three....sorry but thats what made it so amazing. For me at least the CGI ruined the franchise.

4. Oh yeah and the Hayden bit, about Lucas telling him to be that way in the film. Um, well, isn't that nice. I didn't care about Anakin, I didn't want to care, I didn't care who he became, I didn't want to know about his wanting Portman, another horrific actress (at least in this), I really was so snoozed out by them both, I was HOPING, NO PRAYING they would both get mauled in the Gladiator type Acropolis of CGI...

1309655,3,B00003CXKT,"If the Phantom Menace had been done properly, the Clone Wars would have already begun or started early in the movie.  Only a few years would have passed and Anakin would clearly be articulated as a powerful up and coming Jedi.  More time is wasted in a needless attempt on Padme's life which puts Anakin and Padme back together again.  They should never have been apart and already had developed a solid friendship, but with some Han Solo/Princess Leia-type undertones in establishing a relationship.  A raging war could have put them in situations where they finally cross the line naturally.  Instead we are stuck with a very awkward and almost unbearable George Lucas attempt at building a romance between the two; George Lucas does not know much about romance and it shows in the cheesy dialogue and unrealistic interactions between the two.  The scene where Anakin is riding some animal out in the wild is just ridiculous.  The new Queen on Naboo looks and sounds silly.  The arena scene with the creatures was a complete waste of time, and the confrontation that ensues should have come a lot sooner.  The idea that the Clones are modeled after ""Jango Fett"" is terrible - Jango's character should have been eliminated and Boba Fett as a young man in his prime should have been showcased.  The legend of Boba Fett dates back to the Clone Wars (another contradiction to the original trilogy).  Hayden Christensen has been heavily criticized for his acting, but I don't blame him, I blame the bad script and directing.  Obi-Wan's investigation and the ""attack of the clones"" battle were pretty well done.  However, the fight between Dooku against Anakin and Obi-Wan was too short, and nothing was ever established in the entire movie to make Anakin look like the great Jedi he was supposed to become.  The fight between Dooku and Yoda was truly silly and ridiculous - that should never have happened.  The only time we see Yoda fight should have been saved for ""Revenge of the Sith"".  If done properly, Anakin should have fought Darth Maul and established his skill by defeating him (while Obi-Wan tangles with Boba Fett) and then encounters Dooku who surprises him with his more developed abilities and dismembers him in a short fight then escapes.  The secret marriage scene at the end is fine, as well as the clear shift in power and the growing war machine established by Palpatine.

Dooku's (terrible name by the way) role in establishing the Separatist movement was pretty well done, but his role in using his Jedi powers should have been minimized and saved for the fight scene that occurs in ""Revenge of the Sith"".  Ewan McGregor becomes more like the Obi-Wan that we know, and at least Natalie Portman looks hot in her costume at the end.

""Attack of the Clones"" is an improvement to ""The Phantom Menace"", but is still a failure on George Lucas' part.  I would have scrapped about 50% of the movie; without a doubt I could have written a better story.  The movie has its moments, but could have been done better.  A solid relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan was never established which would have made their battle against each other more tragic in ROTS.  The entire movie should have centered on the Clone Wars, but George Lucas wasted too much time and we end up with cartoons that sensationalize the war.",1285286400,3,3323,4.769230769230769
1309656,4,B00003CXKT,"Before I saw Episode II - Attack Of The Clones in the movie theater in May 2002, I heard that it was a big improvement over Episode I - The Phantom Menace.  It was.

For one thing, this movie's script was way better than The Phantom Menace's.  While The Phantom Menace had a loaded, complicated script that the average viewer can't memorize, Attack Of The Clones had a script that was less complicated and easier to memorize and was more typical of episodes IV, V, and VI.  C3PO is an important character in the whole Star Wars series because he's funny and over-the-top.  C3PO was ""back"" to being rather funny in Attack Of The Clones, even though he really couldn't be funny in The Phantom Menace since he was being built at the time and had limited exposure to the galaxy outside of Tatooine and didn't really have a chance to hang around his future sidekick, R2D2.  I was glad to see him back in character.

I feel this was Obi-Wan Kenobi's shining moment in all the Stars Wars films.  Ewan McGregor played the role very well.  In my opinion, Kenobi was the most adventurous and at his toughest in this movie, particularly when he visited the ocean planet of Kamino to track down Jango Fett.  I liked the performance of Temuera Morrison as Jango Fett.  Very good.  Speaking of Kamino, it's my favorite planet featured in this movie.  I like the ocean, rain, and the thunder and lightning.  However, the building where the clones are kept looks way too clean and pristine for a Star Wars movie.  George Lucas has always striven for showing, as he calls it, ""the used future"", where everything looks worn and used and dirty.  This place, however, looks like something out of Star Trek.  Maybe the reason for the cleanliness has to do with having a sterile environment because they're raising a cloned army.  I don't know.  Only George knows.

This movie introduces a new apprentice of Darth Sidious.  His name is Darth Tyrannus, better known as Count Dooku, played by Christopher Lee.  Lee plays this role very well.  Dooku is one of my favorite characters in the whole series, not far behind my favorite character of them all, Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious/Emperor Palpatine.

I like the action scenes on Coruscant.  Coruscant itself is breathtaking and very well done.  I also like the scene when Kenobi is being chased by Jango and Boba Fett through the asteroid belt.  Very cool.

My favorite scene in the movie is the light sabre fight between Yoda and Count Dooku.  I learned something - don't underestimate a 937-year-old little green thing.  Yoda kicks butt in this short but sweet sabre duel.

Thankfully, they toned down the annoying Jar-Jar Binks in this movie and didn't give him nearly as much screen time.  In my opinion, Binks completely ruined The Phantom Menace.  He has to be one of the least liked characters in the history of motion pictures.  He's definitely a first ballot Hall of Famer in the Worst Movie Characters Of All Time Hall Of Fame.

The romance between Anakin and Padme?  It's dull, awkward, unconvincing, and wooden.  This was to be the focal point of the movie and instead it was botched.  Bad lines, unconvincing chemistry between the two of them.  All of a sudden Padme falls for Anakin, and it seems to come out of nowhere.  She falls for him even though he's acting hateful and slaughtering a bunch of Tusken Raiders, including the women and children.  Prior to that, she spent 95% of the time pushing him away, mostly while dressing in revealing and seductive clothing.  I took off one star in my rating of this movie because of this alone.  Out of the hundreds of people who worked on this movie, couldn't somebody tell George Lucas that this relationship between Padme and Anakin just wasn't going to be convincing to the audience?  It seems that everybody dropped the ball.

The movie has some slow and boring parts, but things pick up with the frequent action scenes.

How is the acting in this movie?  On the whole, it's fair, that's all.  I think Hayden Christensen's acting is very wooden at times.  His acting in Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith is way better.  Natalie Portman's acting is pretty good, but could have been better.  Samuel L. Jackson does a good job as Jedi Knight Mace Windu.  The best actor in the movie was Ewan McGregor.

John Williams comes through with another amazing score, one of my favorites from the whole series.

My personal rankings of the Star Wars movies, from favorite to least favorite, are:

1. The Empire Strikes Back
2. A New Hope
3. Revenge Of The Sith
4. Attack Of The Clones
5. Return Of The Jedi
6. The Phantom Menace

1309785,2,B00003CXKT,"For some reason, many people saw this as an improvement over episode 1.  And I kind of understand why.  No Jake Lloyd, not nearly as much screen time for Jar Jar, and Obi-Wan becomes more interesting as a character.  But in my eyes, so many things were worse this time around.  Qui-Gon's gone, and he is one of my favorite Star Wars characters.  Darth Maul is dead, and we have a new villian for this movie.  Count Dooku.  He is played by Christopher Lee, and he is unbelievably bland.  I can't put my finger on what's wrong with him, but he just bugged me so much.  He does his best worst Darth Vader impression, in my opinion.  The main problem I had with this movie, and arguably the worst thing about this trilogy, is Anakin Skywalker.  He is simply the worst protagonist I have ever seen in a movie.  I couldn't stand him.  He's a whiny jerk.  Anakin Skywalker is supposed to be a good man who gradually fell to evil, not this little crybaby.  Part of this problem was the way Anakin's character was written, and part of it was Christensen's acting abilities.  Another huge problem was the love story between Anakin and Padme.  It was supposed to be a huge, passionate love story.  Instead, it was two irresponsible teenagers getting married behind everyone's back.  Their relationship was so contrived and wooden, that that alone makes this one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.

The movie starts off with the following information.  A large group of solar systems have decided to leave the Republic.  They want to start their own government.  They call themselves the Separatists, and they are led by Count Dooku, a former Jedi.  The Republic does not want to allow them to leave.  The Senate is debating whether to start a war to keep the star systems in the Republic.  In a Democracy.  Why would the Senate be trying to force the planets to stay in the Republic?  Is it ""leave the Republic and die?""  They're talking about creating an army to keep the star systems from leaving.  Are they actually talking about threatening to kill them if they leave?  In a Democracy?  Just another example of George Lucas's inept writing ability when it comes to these prequel films.  Padme, who is now the Senator of Naboo, is just returning to Coruscant.  She is against going to war.  Someone is trying to assassinate her, presumably because she is the head of the group who wants to prevent the war from happening.  After an attempt on her life, which is prevented through use of a decoy, Chancellor Palpatine suggests that an extra layer of security be added to her, in the form of a Jedi Knight.  He suggests Obi-Wan Kenobi, since Padme alreay knows him and it would be easier with someone she already knows.  Makes sense.  Oh, and of course, Obi-Wan's five-year-old son will accompany him.

So now we finally meet a grown Anakin Skywalker.  He is supposed to be a great man, at this point.  So why is he such a whiny jerk?  His first scene has him and Obi-Wan arguing about what they are there to do; protect padme, or figure out who wants to kill her.  It seems that, after not having seen Padme for ten years, Anakin still has a crush on her.  Some girl he liked when he was a little kid and hasn't seen in ten years.  This scene illustrates the two biggest problems I have with the Star Wars prequels.  Number one, Anakin, the hero and main protagonist, is a complete jerk.  Number two, the romance between Anakin and Padme makes no sense at all.  And since they actually try to use this as his primary motivation for turning to the dark side.  Hilarious, really.

A few scenes and a long, CGI-infused speeder chase later, they deduce that a bounty hunter has been hired to kill Padme.  The Jedi council orders Obi-Wan to capture the bounty hunter and discover who he is working for.  They decide, geniuses that they are, that Anakin will continue to protect Padme.  Even though Obi-Wan warns them that Anakin has an emotional attachment to her.  They don't seem to care.  The oldest and wisest of all Jedi Knights, ladies and gentlemen.  So while Obi-Wan heads to Kamino to try to find this Bounty Hunter, Anakin and Padme disguise themselves as refugees or something, and journey to Naboo.  They spend their time there flirting like a couple of immature sixteen-year-olds.  Lucas had to get these two to fall in love, so he had to constantly shove it down out throats, because it made no sense at all.  And why does she like him at all?  Anakin is a jerk to her, and he hates all his authority figures, especially his master.  He also makes a bunch of remarks about how Democracy sucks and a dictatorship would be so much better.  Later, he and Padme have an argument about how they love each other, but both of them have committed to serve the republic.  Anakin is not allowed to marry, so he wants to keep it a secret.  Padme responds that they would be living a lie, and that it would destroy them.  Later that night, Anakin has a dream about his mother.  He decides to go to Tatooine to save her.  Why didn't he do that a few years ago?  It is never stated that the council wouldn't let him go back to rescue her.  So why didn't he just go back?  Anyway, he finds out she has been freed, and married to her new slave owner.  But she was recently abducted by Tusken Raiders.  He goes to the camp, and gets to talk to her for about thirty seconds before she dies, after saying something about being complete or something.  Anakin then goes into a rage and kills all the Sand People.  The men, women, and children.  Our protagonist, ladies and gentlemen.  This would have been a good dramatic scene, if this was the first time Anakin had done something evil.  But it's not.  He's been evil throughout the whole movie.  He's not a good man who gradully fell to evil, he's already evil.  When he tells Padme about this, she responds ""to be angry is to be human.""  And then she comforts him.  I won't even go into the massive problems I have with a girl finding out her boyfriend just committed genocide and then comforting him, as if he's the one who's hurting.

While all this is happening, Obi-Wan has been tracking down the bounty hunter.  He comes to Kamino to discover that the Kaminoans have been developing a clone army over the last ten years.  They claim that it was under the orders of Sifo-Dyas, a Jedi Knight.  Obi-Wan tells them that Syfo-Dyas is dead.  They tell him that the basis for the clones is a bounty hunter called Jango Fett.  Jango Fett says that he has never heard of Sifo-Dyas, and that he was recruited by a man called Tyranus.  The Kaminoans have nothing to say to this, and this discrepancy is never really explained.  As a side note, I thought th thing with Boba Fett being a clone of Jango Fett was kind of interesting.  It ended up being kind of meaningless, since they didn't do anything with it.  But still, I'll give a compliment whenever I get the chance.  `Cause there's not a whole lot to give a compliment to where this movie is concerned.  Obi-Wan reports the situation to the Jedi council.  They assure him that they had nothing to do with the army, and that it was unauthorized.  Obi-Wan follows Fett to Geonosis, where it is revealed that he is working for the Separatist movement.  He is trying to kill Padme so that Nute Gunray will join the Separatists, not because he wants to sabotage her peace movement.  Before Obi-Wan can discover more, he is captured.  Count Dooku then TELLS HIM that the Senate is under the control of a Sith Lord.  And since the chancellor is the one who controls the senate, he is indirectly telling him that the CHANCELLOR IS A SITH LORD!!!!  Alas, it takes the Jedi one more movie to discover this.  They only discover it because the chancellor tells them.  Morons.

Anakin is ordered not to go after Obi-Wan.  And as we all know, Anakin will follow orders when the plot requires him to.  Padme says that she is going to help Obi-Wan, and that he will have to come along if he wants to continue to protect her.  What was the point of that interchange between the two of them?  Anyway, they get to Geonosis and after a big CGI video-game scene, the two of them are captured like a couple of morons.  They, along with Obi-Wan, are sentenced to death.  They have a fight with some CGI monsters for a while, until a huge army of Jedi show up.  After an even longer CGI fight, the Jedi are beaten and only about twenty or so are left.  Just as they are about to be finished off, Yoda arrives with the clone army.  The same clone army that the Jedi Council knows were made without authorization and are probably a trap.  A third CGI fight starts up, and the clones dominate the droids.  Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Padme see Count Dooku trying to escape.  They follow him.  Padme suddenly falls out of the ship, and Anakin and Obi-Wan have a long, unnecessary debate about whether to leave her.  Obi-Wan wants to pursue Dooku, and Anakin wants to go back to make sure she's okay.  The thing is, they could have easily picked her up, and then kept going.  Instead, they have a long and tedious argument.  Anakin eventually agrees to leave her, and they pursue Dooku.  The thing is, this scene was completely unnecessary.  Padme is fine, she is found by some clone troopers five minutes later.  I think the reason they had this whole scene in there was because they didn't know what to do with Padme during the lightsaber duel.  Why didn't they just have Padme get on a different ship than Anakin and Obi-Wan?  All this scene served to do was create pointless drama.
Obi-Wan and Anakin arrive at the hangar, and a crappy attempt at lightsaber dueling begins.  After about two minutes, Count Dooku defeats both of them with ease.  Then Yoda shows up.  Dooku throws some stuff at Yoda, and that doesn't work, so he shoots lightning at him and that doesn' work.  Then they start the fourth CGI action scene that has happened in the last five minutes.  When I was a kid watching this, I thought it was a good scene.  But now, it makes Yoda seem so much less interesting in my eyes.  Yoda is supposed to be a great Jedi, not because he is so good at sword-fighting, but because he is wise and in tune with the force.  This scene looks funny, but it does not do the character any justice.  Dooku escapes, and the clone war begins.  The clone army is brought to Coruscant, and the clone war begins.  Anakin and Padme get married in secret, because she loves him despite the fact that he is an evil mass murderer.

Attack of the Clones was, at the time, the worst Star Wars movie.  The protagonist was a jerk, and this alone is enough to make the movie suck.  But that's just one of many problems.  The conflict makes no sense.  Practically every plot point is silly or contrived.  As i said earlier, the good guys are complete and utter morons.  But don't worry, it gets a whole lot worse in the next movie.",1267747200,8,10877,4.456532791052364
1309786,3,B00003CXKT,"Attack Of The Clones' is better than `The Phantom Menace' in two ways:

(a) It has a stronger individual story: instead of the dull trade dispute of the first film, the assassination plot against Padme and the buildup to the Clone Wars are actually interesting.

(b) It has a stronger connection to the original trilogy: many of the events here clearly foreshadow important  plot points of Episodes IV-Vi ; the ascension of Palpatine to Republic leader, the creation of the Clone Army, the beginning of the War, Anakin's relationship with Padme, and the first hint of his descent into Darth Vader.

Overall, Episode II is a more entertaining movie than Episode I. The pacing is much better throughout, with a number of excellent set action pieces. The climactic battle and the duel between Yoda and Dooku are the highlights of the entire trilogy. And unlike the intergalactic politics of Episode I, there is a greater focus on plot and character development here.

However, problems from `The Phantom Menace' remain. Once again, the film feels quite leaden and forced, as if Lucas was trying too hard to recapture the magic of the original films. The dialogue can be a bit stilted at times, and is laughably cheesy during the so-called `romantic' scenes between Anakin and Padme. And as before, the acting is a mixed bag. Ewan McGregor is beginning to grow into the role of Obi-Wan, there is a good turn from Christopher Lee as Dooku, while Ian McDiarmid once again steals the show as the duplicitous Palpatine. The two leads, however, are let down by the script and turn in ordinary performances.

In fact, this movie's greatest achievement might be that it makes Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen look like bad actors. Portman at least had some runs on the board as an actress, but Christensen might find it hard to live down his role as Anakin. The script gives him nothing, making him come across as a selfish, whiny brat, and neither his relationship with Padme nor the emergence of his Dark Side feel very realistic. What should have been the central character in the movie becomes a black hole into which everything else is sucked.

Like Episodes I and III, it's nowhere near as good as the original movies, but I'd say `Attack Of The Clones' is the best of the new trilogy.",1263945600,2,2286,4.772151898734177
1309787,4,B00003CXKT,"In terms of acting, plot, dialogue, and special effects, Attack of the Clones is light years beyond The Phantom Menace. Much of the movie focuses on the mystery of the clone army. It ends with a spectacular battle scene - still one of the best sci-fi battles out there.

I like a lot about Attack of the Clones, but at the end of the day it just seems like the plot still needed to be worked out. There is a whole mystery about who built the clone army, but this is never fully explained. Also, it's not really clear why the Separatists were building a Death Star. I'm a Star Wars geek and it took me a while to figure these plot twists out. It's certainly not going to appeal to casual fans. Also, while the main actors are fine, the extras are sometimes a bit corny - particularly the Jedi at the end of the movie and the other Separatist leaders.

1309789,4,B00003CXKT,"This time its Hayden Christensen who ruins it for me but its not only him. The performances in the ""romantic"" scenes between him and Natalie Portman are as wooden as the government, which I blame on Lucas. The original Star Wars and episode 1  had no romantic scenes, so I'll give those some slack but when it came to the burgeoning romance between Han Solo and Princess Leia in episodes 5 and 6, someone else wrote the screenplay while Lucas developed the story. Why he felt he needed to write the whole thing for this I'll never know. But alas those are the only negative points of this film. Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan is now a Jedi Knight and teacher to Christensen's Skywalker. Christensen portrays Skywalker as a complaining brat, and it astounds me that THIS is the man who became the most feared warrior in the galaxy. I know its supposed to show that the character is impatient and wants to move ahead in his training but to me that's how this guy's acting comes across to me. McGregor is still good as Obi-Wan, starting to show some of the elements that Alec McGuinness portrayed in the original film. Portman is good as Padm (its just the romance scenes that I don't like), able to portray a woman torn between her duty and her feelings. Christopher Lee joins the franchise as Jedi turned Sith Count Dooku (a possible reference to his time as Dracula). He pulls off the charisma and charm that he's known for and I admire and he's pretty good with a lightsaber for the scenes in which he fights (I mean the REAL actor, NOT his stand-in). Yoda is now a digital character, which doesn't bother me as much, seeing as how the character finally gets to fight. Samuel L. Jackson, like Yoda, has more to do and is the first Jedi to have different colored lightsaber blade. I like the aspect of someone wanting to kill Senator Amidala in order to provoke a war between the Republic and the Sepratists. And since nobody likes Jar Jar anyway, he gets the blame for giving the Chancellor emergency powers to create the Clone Army, thus being inadvertently responsible for the creation of the Empire and the destruction of the Jedi.

1309794,2,B00003CXKT,"ATTACK OF THE CLONES is definitely not the 2nd movie that EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is.

The unraveling plot continues to deepen as we slide toward that inevitable outcome we had all been waiting 20 years for.  (And the waiting continued until REVENGE OF THE SITH -- a far better film.)  The acting is some of the absolute worst I have ever seen.  The direction of the dialogue sequences is likewise very poorly executed.  (The ""forbidden kiss"" scene by the fireplace is still painful every time I think of it.)  But in all of this, the framework of the story itself does link up the two parts of the prequel trilogy.  Is that enough reason to go out and buy it?  Probably not unless you can get it at a very, very low price (which I did).

In the area of exciting action sequences AOTC does not disappoint.  Seeing legendary British actor Christopher Lee portray the evil Sith lord Count Dooku/Darth Tyrannus and square off against Yoda is a pure delight as was the preceding duel of the aforementioned fighting with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker.  And Jango Fett provides some incredible excitement as well.  But all these things (along with a few other commendable points which I won't go into) still can't convince me to give this film more than two stars.

1309944,5,B00003CXKT,"I find it kind of weird to be writing a review of Star Wars: Episode II so long after the fact. But for what is and has always been a series of popcorn movies, it took me a surprisingly long time and large number of viewings to really appreciate the subtlety of what Attack of the Clones was doing and how well the prequel trilogy as a whole succeeded.

In a nutshell, George Lucas set himself a gargantuan task in doing the three prequels. He had to take the character of Anakin Skywalker, make him a likable and sympathetic character that viewers would enjoy watching for most of three movies, and then turn him into Darth Vader at the end in a way that was both fundamentally believable and effective, and allow the us to feel the tragedy. In short, he had to do something almost completely unlike the heroic arc he did in the original trilogy.

And you know what, for me anyway, he succeeded, and once again the middle chapter is the key one. This is where Lucas had to develop Anakin as a real, likable character, and yet give us just enough of his darker side to set up his final fall without yet making us actually dislike him. I think Anakin's romance with Padme was the linchpin and very well-done, even though many fans have criticized it for lousy dialog. You know, I had badly-written dialog when I was that age too. We've had a lot of hip teenagers in popular culture these days, like the character from Buffy: the Vampire Slayer, who talk more like what their 30-something writers would have liked to have talked like when they were that age. Anakin is an awkward, conflicted, serious yet emotional teenager who is deeply in love with Padme and doesn't know how to talk to her. And that's what he sounds like, and for me, it worked, allowing Anakin to develop both sides of his character (Padme's side of the relationship is a little sketchier; her role isn't as well drawn in my opinion, and additionally Natalie Portman, a talented actress, may have been mailing this one in).

Needless to say, the action and chase scenes are brilliant, and George Lucas is the master when it comes to framing and setting these things up. Whether it's the skillfully managed tension of the bar scene, the cleverly-shot lightsaber duel between Dooku, Anakin, and/or Obi-Wan, or fisticuffs in the rain, Lucas makes all the action scenes compelling. Crucially, they are an extension of the plot and character development and not just spectacular set pieces as they are in so many movies of this genre.

I'm not going to say the movie is perfect, or as compelling as The Empire Strikes Back; it's got its awkward moments, not all of them there for a good reason. The first time I saw Episode II, I wasn't that impressed. But what Lucas set out to do was much more ambitious than it appears on the surface, far more ambitious than most Sci-Fi action flicks, and for me he's succeeded in delivering a trilogy of both exciting action and emotional depth. It took a little while for them to grow on me, and for me to appreciate and understand what he was doing, but now that I'm there I like the second three as much as the first three.",1236297600,20,3128,4.511463844797178

After leaving the theater,I realized that although it wasn't as good as the first three ""Star Wars"" films,but was just as good as ""Star Wars:Episode I-The Phantom Menace"",I was being entertained. I like watching movies that entertain me and this film did a good job at that. I like to point out that we are living in an age where computer technology seem to be an open doorway to the art of special effects.""Star Wars:Episode II-Attack of the Clones"" is a great example of that. Some people question the idea of Yoda being recognized through CGI.After all,he began as a puppet in ""The Empire Strikes Back"".""Star Wars:Episode II-Attack of the Clones"" did prove to me that even the best ones have a downfall and even though I enjoyed this film,it seems to lack the same sort of storytelling that was evident throughout the first three ""Star Wars"" films,but that didn't bother me at all. Director George Lucas is in my opinion telling a story although some people might not see it.""Star Wars"",""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" were all about the end of the bad and the beginning of the new.""Star Wars:Episode I-The Phantom Menace"",""Star Wars:Episode II-Attack of the Clones"" and ""Star Wars:Episode III"" which will come out in Summer,2005 is more of of an explanation to how we got to the events of the first three ""Star Wars"" films. I question myself as I type this review. Would George Lucas use the CGI technolgy if it had existed when he made the first ""Star Wars"" movie.

Star Wars Is and always has been a Cultural Phenomenon.  Why has the Original Trilogy Flourished, while the Prequels have been treated less then kind to.  First off Episodes I-III are The story of Anakin Skywalker. Not the back story of the Exploits of Darth Vader. We have to know the Man before we Know the Monster.  Episode II is how Anakin and Padme fall in Love and the fall af the Republic into Civil War.  I Thought it was a Terrific Movie.  Hayden C. Can act, He is a Good (Young-Future) Vader.  Natalie Portman is Perfect as the Mother of Luke and Leia. And Ewan Mcgregor is Without a doubt the perfect young Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Yoda in action.  Jango Fett, Young Boba Fett.

1310060,3,B00003CXKT,"After the overwhelmingly disappointing presentation that was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Episode-I-The-Phantom-Menace/dp/B00076RT24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</a>, we Star Wars fans were sure that our benefactor, the wise and creative George Lucas, had simply been dealing with a very large and lengthy brain fart that had caused some of his more questionable choices regarding what was to be the prequel to end all prequels. We were sure that by ascending the director's chair again, he would be righting the wrongs of the first (or fourth) film and making us feel proud to be sci-fi junkies again. However, to put it plainly, ""Attack of the Clones"" merely rights a few of it predecessor's wrongs only to replace them with faults just as great as those that were left behind. While the sequel is a maginally better attempt, that's all it is: a blind attempt at replicating the original trilogy's greatness.

Taking place a decade after Episode I, the plot finds ex-queen and current Naboo senator Padm Amidala (Natalie Portman) the target of an assassination attempt led by a separatist movement stirring in the Galactic Senate. Sent to protect her are Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his maturing apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), who has not relented his attraction towards the beautiful politician since the last movie. The two Jedi eventually part ways, with Kenobi tracking a bounty hunter linked to the attempted murder and Skywalker escorting the senator into hiding on her homeworld...where, against the code of the Jedi, the two of them come to realize that their attraction is more than one-sided.

It's rare that I can place the majority of blame for a bad movie on a single individual, but in the case of ""Clones"", a large part of what made the movie a big disappointment was Hayden Christensen being cast as the adult Anakin Skywalker. I have no doubt that even decades from now, fans will still be debating what state of mind Lucas was in when he selected the 21-year-old star of TV's ""Higher Ground"" for what should have been one of the most defining roles in cinema history. The part of Skywalker calls for the juggling of complex emotions, but even the most basic of core expressions seem lost to Christensen, who mumbles his lines like a supporting member of a school play, and sells the most humanistic exertions as though he has something else on his mind. Luckily, Ewan McGregor has begun to grow into his role as the-man-who-would-be-Ben, and having Christopher Lee (""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) cast as the villainous Count Dooku adds a sense of legitimacy to the otherwise flawed ensemble; he nicely fills the shoes that had been left by other acclaimed performers like Alec Guiness and Liam Neeson.

If we can forget the fact that the romance angle of Anakin and Padme resembles ""Dawson's Creek"" to an embarrassing extent, we can look at ""Attack"" for what it's best left as: a powerhouse of CGI magic and action galore. While ""Phantom Menace"" was no slouch when it came to delivering the thrills, its sequel dutifully puts it to shame by showcasing what are, without a doubt, some of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring visuals ever: the Obi-Wan/Jango Fett battle, the chase in the asteroid field, the droid/Clone battle, the climatic lightsaber duel, and roughly a dozen other scenes will remind anybody of what George Lucas and his team can do with special effects and that they really know how to shoot a fight scene, in space on the ground. In addition, the environment now has a more tangible feel: not unlike Mos Eisley or Hoth in the original films, the characters traverse deeply into the locales they visit, giving the environment a very fleshed-out feel. This is a great step upwards, when remembering the indifferent atmosphere surrounding the locations of the previous film. Absolutely no expense has been spared to detail these vistas to an amazing degree: I'm sure that a viewer could occupy himself throughout the movie by just paying attention to the backgrounds, the sound effects, and the texture of Lama Su's face.

Alas, we Star Wars fans would have to wait until Episode III until we would receive general satisfaction in the prequel trilogy, and for this, Episode II is a disappointment - not as a sci-fi or action movie, but as a part of the Star Wars legacy. No doubt fans will already own it, but anybody who hasn't seen it yet shouldn't be afraid of giving it a rent on a Saturday night...just don't expect a classic.",1217894400,,4600,5.024901703800786
1310061,4,B00003CXKT,"*Contains spoilers for anyone that hasn't seen the film*

Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is the Star Wars movie that possibly divide's Star Wars fans the most. With The Phantom Menace, most fans are united in their indifference to down right loathing. With Revenge of the Sith, most fans agreed that it was a huge step up in all departments. But with 2002's Attack of the Clones opinion was varied widely between those that hated it more then Phantom Menace right through to those that thought it was a masterpiece on a par with The Empire Strikes Back. Why such a range of opinion? My feeling is that this is perhaps the movie of the series that is closest to Lucas's personal desire to be a truly experimental film maker. Indeed, there's almost something of the advant garde about the style of Attack of the Clones, but at the same time Lucas has gone out of his way to listen and respond and correct much of the criticism of The Phantom Menace.

In a story sense, Attack of the Clones is closest to The Empires Strikes Back. It's a bridging movie that must act both as pathway from Episode I to Episode III and at the same time it must be an interesting and entertaining movie in its own right. It must deepen and flesh out the characters and take the plot in new and surprising directions - Clones achieves all of these things to varying degrees of success. Clearly Lucas realized this film was in some ways connected in story terms to Empire, because he put in a couple of elements from the 1980 movie. So, we have incredibly cool looking Bounty Hunters, a very youthful Boba Fett and his father Jango Fett and a chase through an asteroid field (though the CGI asteroid chase of Attack of the Clones is not a thrilling or exciting as the asteroid chase in Empire)

Attack of the Clones is basically a love story set against the backdrop of war and this is where a lot of the complaints come from. The love story is played out as a very old fashioned, formal courtship, almost in the spirit of King Arthur or Romeo and Juliet. The dialogue is deliberately flowery and over the top. Unfortunately Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman do not have the range to pull off some of the lines they are given. The actors should have had a sense of humor about the guff they have to say, and that would have helped the audience relax into the scenes. As it is, everything is played out very seriously and on one or two occasions the scenes simply become a bore. Listen out for a stunning, melancholy love theme (Across The Stars) composed as ever by musical legend John Williams. This sad piece hints at the tragedy that will await Anakin and Padme....
Juxtaposed to the love story we get a mystery story, where Obi-Wan Kenobi goes off on his own to investigate who is trying to kill Padme. The mystery deepens when Obi-Wan stumbles across a Clone Army that is being developed for The Republic, supposedly at the behest of the Jedi Council. Soon Obi-Wan finds himself caught up in a war beat that explodes into life on the hot and dusty planet of Geonosis. This story is much more interesting than the love stuff and on a number of occasions when the movie is with Anakin and Padme, you'll find yourself wishing to get back to Obi-Wan. Ewan McGregor has a much expanded role, and he shines. This is McGregor's movie and he completely steps up to the plate. Rumor has it that Ewan wasn't particularly happy with this movie, but in my opinion he delivers his best work of the Prequel Trilogy in Attack of the Clones.

As the movie develops Anakin and Padme leave the safety of Naboo (Lake Como stands in for Naboo in this film and looks absolutely beautiful) and travel to Tatooine. This is the part of the film where Clones truly comes alive. The acting level rise's all round as we return to the Lars Homestead (the places and sets so famous in the original Star Wars movie) We meet up with C3PO and find out that Anakin's mother has been kidnapped by Tusken Raiders. As his beloved mother later dies in arms, Anakin lashes out in an uncontrollable rage (listen out for a ghostly voice crying out at this moment) and his downward spiral to his ultimate fate has begun. These scenes and a confession scene (set in the Lars garage - another famous set from Star Wars) are played out excellently. Christenson and Portman really act well in these scenes. The movie rise's to a whole new level at this moment, and the rest of the film just fly's by.

The final action scenes take place on Geonosis as Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme join up and take on monsters and Battle Droids. They are then joined by Clones Attacking (fancy that) and 500 Jedi Knights, including much expanded roles for Yoda and Mace Windu. All this is overseen by evil Count Dooku, played with great style by horror legend Christopher Lee. Indeed, the climax of the movie is an iconic face off between Dooku and Yoda. The lightsaber fight itself leaves a lot to be desired, but the build up is masterful. The roof, literally, comes down! As we go from one action scene to another in true cliffhanger/Saturday matinee style, the action becomes breathtaking and you'll be exhausted by the end. Finally people get to see why Star Wars is such a special series of movies.

The acting is generally better in Clones than Menace. I've already picked up on McGregor, but Portman and Christenson also do good work outside of some of the love scenes. Ian McDiarmid is again solid as ever as Palpatine (look out for the now Supreme Chancellor to take a further step towards Galactic Domination in a scene that actually justifies Jar Jar Binks's presense in this series) Samuel L Jackson enjoys his expanded role. Tem Morrison as Jango Fett and Christopher Lee both enjoy their villainous roles.

So, what are those experimental elements? Well, firstly the film was the first ever motion picture to be shot entirely with digital cameras. This is problematical as it adds a shiny, somehow false element to many of the scenes. Almost like everything is a little bit too clear and clear - Only when the action moves on to the grimy location of Tatooine does it finally look like a proper camera has been used.
The editing is also done in a very abstract way. This was Ben Burtts first movie as a solo editor and many of the cuts, whether deliberately or not, do stand out. There's almost something about this film that jerks you around - This is almost entirely deliberate. Right from the pan the camera motion is up rather than down (or is it just that the camera is up side down????) and from that moment on its clear that nothing is what it seems.
There's a water planet (Kamino) where the Clones are being created. Inside the building on Kamino, everything is brilliantly white and sanitized and this environment definitely evokes memories of Lucas's first film, THX-1138. That, set against the hot and mechanical world of Geonosis and the droid factories (where Anakin and Padme have a long action scene) these environments are both much more abstract than any other enviro's in the Star Wars Saga.
Lucas has always said Star Wars is a silent movie, but with Attack of the Clones he pushes that to an absolute limit. The last 40 minutes is essentially a silent movie. Yes, there is still some dialogue, but out of 40 minutes, I would guess the total amount of dialogue would come to less than 5 minutes. Instead, the story is told entirely through movement, sound and music. This is absolutely the heart and soul of George Lucas the film maker. Telling stories visually and through sound and music. NOT dialogue. There's a fabulous moment during the lightsaber duel between Anakin and Dooku, where all you see is a black background and the protagonists faces, lit up by the red and blue of their lightabers. No music, no dialogue, just the iconic sound of their sabers and the striking visuals. Almost like a little tone poem. This is surely the most advant garde scene in the whole of the Star Wars Saga?
As well as pushing the silent movie element to its limit in the last 40 minutes, George Lucas also pushes the cliffhanger style to its limit. The final 40 minutes is basically one cliffhanger ending after another after another after another and its all done in true Saturday Morning Matinee style.

So this is definitely George Lucas's most abstract Star Wars movie. And this weird blend of the abstract and the commercial makes for an odd combination. As I said at the start, some people love Attack of the Clones and it now has a cult following among a small number of fans. At the same time some people loath it. Like all the Star Wars movies it should be seen at least once and watch with an open mind.

The production is as good as ever. The costumes look great; the CGI (whilst not to everyone's tastes) is as expertly done by ILM as ever. The musical score is better than on The Phantom Menace, despite some poor editing from Burtt. The acting is better. The script is generally better (though Star Wars is NOT about dialouge and if more people understood this they would probably appreciate the Sage more)

As far as extra's go, we have the usual deleted scenes, trailers, music video, full commentary, web-docs and featurette's. The main documentary; From Puppets To Pixels is sadly NOT of the standard of The Phantom Menaces: The Beginning. Nevertheless, it's well produced and is worth a look. Look out also for mockumentary R2D2: Beneath The Dome - A very funny look at the life of R2D2.

Attack of the Clones itself is much darker than The Phantom Menace and has a melancholy feel about it. The ending is a true downer. First we have the realization that the Clone Wars have begun and the Sith are in total control of events. Then we get our first true blast the legendary Imperial March, followed by a doomed wedding set against the symbolism of a setting sun. As Anakin and Padme turn their backs to the camera, their fate is sealed. Episode III awaits....

Speaking for myself (and I can only do that) I highly recommend Attack of the Clones. The movie is better than The Phantom Menace at a very good **** whilst the extra's are slightly worse than those included with The Phantom Menace, but still a solid ***. Please note that this movie will most certainly not be to everybody's tastes.

Once again Lucas disappoints his audience with a visually stunning but lackluster and unimaginative storyline that is surpassed only by the banality of its dialogue.

I don't believe I have ever seen stiffer, more unnatural performances than I did in this film, at least not in a major, big budget project as this one. It's hard to distinguish the real life forms from the robotic. It would seem the only instruction the cast was given was walk here, or sit there and deliver your lines of dialogue without cracking a smile or displaying in the slightest hint of emotion.

Gone are the days of the highly emotional and expressive Hans Solo, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leila. Their personalities and relationships worked, their interaction rang true. Now in their stead we have Anakin Skywalker, Padme Amidala and a younger version of Obi-Wan Kenobi. They are unexpressive, restrained and lifeless, delivering somber pronouncements and one-line ""The Force"" related clichs so bland and boring it's enough to bring one to tears. Even my beloved Yoda comes across as a hollow charactiture of what he was in `The Empire Strikes Back'.

What made me a fan was the love story between Anakin and Padme. I too cannot believe all the negativity towards Hayden or Natalie Portman. There are so many hateful and mean people out there. Can you do any better? I think they both did a great job. I think that both Hayden and Natalie are the new stars of tommorow and we will see allot more of them. I pray that both of them has huge success.

I do agree that some of the lines was a bit cheesy but I also found it quite endearing. Their love was true and genuine. The only thing I hated was that there was no more mention of Padme in the last three episodes.  I would have loved for Anakin and Padme to have a reunion at the end (in death of course).I wish George Lucas would give the two lovers a true ending and not leave it at the tragedy that it currently is. For some or other reason I am having a hard time in finding closure with Padme giving up at the end.

Um.... did ANYONE like this movie? Anyone, anywhere... ever? This one seems to be ranking right up there with his ""Howard the Duck.""

But at least people had some kind of strong passion for that one. Any extreme movie (exterme in any way) is a likely candidate for the ""cult following."" But this one is just boring.

I wanted to kick it as hard as I could, not out of anger, but just to see if it's even alive.

If it is, it's flat-lining.

I remember when George Lucas announce that he was going to release the last three ""Star Wars"" movies (which ironically were the first three), the whole wide world jumped up.

When ""Episode I"" was finally released, it was met with lukewarm reviews (from critics and fans alike). From the fair-weather to the hard-core, industrial strength fans.

And everyone in between.

Many people ride Lucas and get on his case about his inability to write dialouge (myself included).

Hey, let's face it. The man couldn't write dialog for a mime. Which is why he always hires a script doctor whenever he makes a film from his own screenplay. Hey, this is just called just plain common sense.

Many filmmakers try to re-make the kinds of movies that they first fell in love with when they were young. That not only applies to Lucas, he is the very definition of that. With futuristic Orwell tales (""THX 1138""), period action-adventure summer matin&eacute;es (""Indianda Jones""), sci-fi space operas (""Star Wars,"" of course) and medieval sword-and-sorcery flicks (""Willow"").

His abilities are in composing a movie lie in production values and state-of-the-art, groundbreaking, revolutionary special effects. Bringing everything about a genre together in one film and playing it to the hilt.

So Lucas brought on Johnathan Hales (""The Scropian King"" and TV's ""Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"") as script doctor. Lucas' wise decision helped them take home the 2002 Razzie Award for Worst Screenplay. Hey, ***** the Oscars.

This was apparently the very first major-motion picture not to be shot on film, but on a special digital video movie camera that SONY designed specifically for Lucas himself.

I saw the movie on DVD, so being shot on digital video and being run on digital video disk, the movie was so sharp and so exact and so precise and so full of detail, I was amazed. When I saw ""Episode I"" in theaters, it didn't stand out this beautifully.

However, that momentary feeling eventually disintegrated and I was left with a feeling of indifference, then some boredom, then finally contempt.

The first released chapter in the ""Star Wars"" saga (Episode IV: A New Hope) showed a lot of the movie's themes came from old westerns and samurai pictures. In ""Episode II,"" I got the feeling the movie got a lot of it's inspiration from war movies. You know, ""Gettysburg"" and the like.

The could make for one hell of a little movie, except for the fact that this one is completely on Valium.

Breaktaking visual scenery and first-rate FX (the entire movie was filmed in front of a blue screen) can't compensate for performances by actors who understandably seem have to have almost no love for a script that could have been written by a coma patient and a director who's far too assured that ""it'll all be fixed and filled out in editing and special effects later.""

I know damned well Hayden Christensen is capable of acting. I've seen it. He seems to be channeling his role from ""Life As A House"" (no doubt that's why Lucas chose Christensen in the first place. It's like hiring Marlon Brando to play a powerfully-made mafioso with a speech impenement.

But the script and lack of direction seem to suck all the potential out of him. He never seems to be truly there at all.

Nor does scholar and sometimes-actress Natalie Portman. I feel kinda guilty saying this and all, but I never truly believed her as a action movie heroine in ""Episode I."" She just lacks that spunk and fire.

You know, the kind that Carrie Fisher really had for almost every second she was on screen, especially when she shared scenes with Mr. Harrison Ford.

Portman simply can't do a Bidget Fonda or Pam Grier or Karen Allen. She's too sweet and vulnerable. Well, at least she seems more at home here. Although as sweet and beautiful as she is, there is no passion. Not in what she says or anything they do together.

They never seem to be in love so much as just sitting back practicing Shakesphere-style acting and mood for a theater performance.

It's nice to know good IL' Bobby Simone, yes--Jimmy Smits (Of TV's ""L.A. Law"" and NYPD Blue"" fame) is still out there and plugging away as an actor. He gets a bit in here as a Jedi Master on the council.

The only action sequences of any interest throughout take place when a Sith and Jedi masters have a powerful duel which leads to further hate and anger.

The dark side is claiming more and more Jedi by the second.

And all this could've great for another great ""Star Wars"" classics.

But the movie is has no life or energy. It seems almost indifferent. Like Lucas didn't have his heart (or anything else in this one).

He basically just wanted to get this one out of the way. The only thing he had in this movie is his wallet.

This whole damn movie feels like something he had to just something mandatory he had to get out of the way so he could bridge episodes I and III and continue with the rest of the series.

With the others, you know the filmmakers are giving it everything they had.

Here... no one cares.

Not even Lucas.

Now that's a real tragic story.

Why do so many people have such a problem with the last four Star Wars movies? Yeah, Jar Jar is annoying, but get over it. Many people I talk to say that this movie was to slow, boring, ect. I am sorry but Episode IV for all you supposed ""Fans"" is much slower than this. The next complaint I always hear is about Hayden C. and his ""terrible acting."" Shut up please with your negative comments. Yes, Anakin is whiny in Episode II, just like Obi-wan is whiny in Episode I, and even more to my point, Luke was more whiny in Episodes IV-V then Anakin and Obi-wan put together. Lucas would not have chosen Hayden as Anakin if that is not how he wanted Anakin to be played. Understand that if you have a problem with the acting, know that it is Lucas who approves it. Episode II expands on Anakin and Padme's love and yes it is a little slow. But just like all the other Star Wars movies, it is a masterpiece.

1310297,4,B00003CXKT,"ATTACK OF THE CLONES, the second STAR WARS ""prequel,"" has been unjustly dismissed by many critics and viewers; yet of the three, it appears to me the only one that captures some of the original trilogy's spirit. While the well-deserved iconic status of the original trilogy cannot be seriously ascribed to any of the later films (hence my four-star rating rather than five), repeated viewings reveal ATTACK OF THE CLONES to be far more thoughtfully written than either its dismally weak predecessor THE PHANTOM MENACE or its pompous, chaotic successor REVENGE OF THE SITH.

PHANTOM MENACE seems largely to have been intended as a children's film; even the child actor selected to play Anakin was far too young to make the chronology believable, but the apparently intended audience could easily relate to him. With its flaccid, pointless characters and cheap-looking CGI effects done for their own sake, it plays like Saturday morning kids' TV. I note that many of the Amazon reviews read: ""My 5-year-old loved it."" So if a kids' movie was George Lucas' intent, he was almost successful, although I can't imagine how a kid would react to the traumatic image of the slave-child Anakin being torn from his slave-mother Shmi, the one heart-rending dramatic element in the film--never resolved properly.  Except for that image, adults have a very difficult time with this bloated 137-minute unfunny cartoon, its main character clearly the grating Jar Jar Binks--who is given a rather racist characterization.

Episode III--REVENGE OF THE SITH, for all its hype, simply doesn't work because Anakin's reactions are unbelievable. Lured by Palpatine's mendacious promise that Siths can ""prevent the ones they care about from dying""--playing to Anakin's obsession, he joins Palpatine/Sidious' violent galactic takeover, even *after* that pivotal promise is revealed as a bald lie by Palpatine: ""only one Sith lord has ever been able to [prevent death], but together we *may* be able to save Padme."" Anakin's capitulation *despite that revelation* destroys the viewer's belief in the drama. Anakin's seduction is a core theme of Lucas' 28-year project, and to see its key scene written so very unconvincingly is shocking.

In Episode II--ATTACK OF THE CLONES, I feel that we are given the only honestly realized glimpse of a chapter in Anakin's life. One would place his age at perhaps seventeen and Padme's at a youthful twenty-two. Neither have had experience in love, so their pain, confusion, and difficult, awkward verbal exchanges are entirely credible and even endearing. Critics seem to have missed it altogether: Hayden Christensen is accused of being ""wooden,"" but he is tapping into typical teenage experiences of first love--which were perhaps only a few years away in his own 20-year-old life. There is a rare authenticity--which the critics naturally missed. It is only in this film where we believe that Anakin is torn between the Jedi--who show him no respect, treating him both patronizingly and suspiciously, refusing to empathize with the realities of his tender age and hard past life (though ""empathy"" is supposedly critical in the Jedi credo)--and the possibility of another way, dangled before him through Palpatine's blandishments. The fact that the liberation of Anakin's enslaved mother is not even an issue for the Jedi paints them as abominably callous--and possibly sexist; her cruel death, achingly difficult to watch, and which Anakin is in no position to prevent, would embitter anyone toward the Jedi. It is only by *remembering* these points that one is able to believe in Anakin's final, tragic seduction by Palpatine in the third film, even though REVENGE itself actually sabotages this eloquent groundwork with horrendous writing that logically would have Anakin grudgingly decide to remain in the Jedi fold as the lesser evil, about 70 minutes into the film. With some humorous touches reminiscent at times of STAR WARS (1977), and the unusually careful set-up I described, ATTACK OF THE CLONES must be deemed the only successful film of the three prequels.

Filmed digitally, theatrical presentations, transferred to standard film, were said to be disappointing. Ironically, the DVD is the natural medium for ATTACK OF THE CLONES, and it looks splendid in anamorphic widescreen. Like all the later STAR WARS films, it is loaded with extras, all interesting once, and delivered with an annoying self-congratulatory tone by Lucas and company.",1198022400,2,4469,5.262272089761571

Not just that it was bad it ruined all the other episodes and what Star Wars was about.  I am very disappointed and insulted.  This was about the same as a muppets cartoon.  Lucas are you serious and have you lost your marbles?  What a stab in the back to the orginal fans.  Growing up I remember seeing Star Wars at a very young age when it first came out but it was not just for kids it was for everyone.  Attack of the clones took a good movie series and made it into a cartoon that is for non-Adults without all the great actors that the orginal films had with real roles.  Surely they could have done a better job.  It's too bad they ruined what could have been a great movie.  I don't know what kind of mentality (other than a very young child) a person would have to sit though this entire movie without getting up and walking out.  What an injustic to Star War fans.

1310299,2,B00003CXKT,"Wow, how could such a great series produce something that's just, how do I put it lightly, bad?

Every part of this movie's acting was bad, with the exception of Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson and Frank Oz is, of course, Frank Oz. Anakin's actor has now been replaced with.... (plays dark music) Prettyboy Hayden Christianson. How do I discribe this guy, well, something like this: If this guy was shot for every time he delivered a line badly, his remains would make Freddy Kruger look like an amateur. Next is Natalie Portman reprising her role as Senator (formerly Queen) Amidala, it's not that she's necessarily bad, it's just, she's just not any good.

Now let me elaborate on the rest of the painful badness of this film. Not only was the acting bad, but the lines that they spoke were bad, it felt like a very bad soap opera. Let's see, what 'highlights' (snickers) can I remember from this film? Well there was: ""I hate sand, it's so rough and course, but not like you, you're soft, and smooth"", yes, that one had me ready to throw up. Let's see, what else, oh! There was: ""Don't leave, your presence is soothing"", no joke, they actually said that (it was so bad, in fact, that the actor reminded me of Napoleon Dynamite when he said it!). One interesting thing abut the movie is that it was very political. No, not like an allogory, it just made it's own politics and took them very seriously. Now this may have been interesting in the books which expand and fill in the story, it's not interesting here, because, in this movie, nothing is interesting. I don't know why, it just felt, irrelevant, totally pointless sequences of blabbering on and on, I wouldn't so much mind this if they hadn't spent the entire half of the movie that wasn't taken over by anakin being spazmatic with it. What a drag.

I would have given this movie 1 star if it weren't for Ewan McGregor and an awesome (but corny) ending battle sequence.",1196380800,2,1931,4.543103448275862
1310300,3,B00003CXKT,"""Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace"" was one of the most hyped movies of the late 1990s, yet managed to disappoint countless Star Wars fans.  With the annoying Jar Jar Binks, a child actor who was in over his head, poor pacing, and wooden acting and dialogue, I was less than impressed, despite being a big Star Wars fan.  Apparently, so many others were let down that it somehow resulted in ""The Matrix"" being lauded as the ""new hope"" of epic sci-fi, despite that movie falling far short of the standards set by Star Wars.  When George Lucas promised (or threatened?) that Episode II would be ""Titanic in space"", my interest waned even more.  However, as the promotional media emerged, my interest picked up again as it appeared that there would at least be some good action sequences.  So how did the unfortunately named ""Attack of the Clones"" fare?

  First the bad news, and it's not pretty.  The dialogue is, for the most part, not good at all, with some terribly blatant exposition that is not needed at all.  The acting doesn't fare well either, generally speaking.  Anakin Skywalker(who is now 10 years older) is now played by Hayden Christiansen, instead of Jake Lloyd.  Unfortunately, while his efforts are commendable, Hayden obviously is ill at ease in this role, and co-star Natalie Portman exhibits zero enthusiasm during the movie.  As these two are supposed to be the ""romantic leads"", the resulting lack of chemistry cripples the emotional core of the movie.  Samuel Jackson's performance as Mace Windu is similarly off, and there is some other poor acting by various bit players.  Thus, the weight of the movie ends up having to be borne by the acting chops of Ewan McGregor, Temuera Morrison, Ian McDiarmid, and Christopher Lee, who all do manage to perform in a professional manner.  (Of particular note is the initial terse face to face meeting between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett).  Still, there are also some lingering pacing issues, most notably related to scenes surrounding Anakin and Padme in the middle of the movie.

  The good news is that the movie works on a ""macro"" level, as far as the over-arching Star Wars storyline and universe are concerned.  Helping this aspect are several dynamic action and set pieces, which include a ""car chase"" in the skies of the city planet of Coruscant, a trip to the rain-drenched water planet Kamino, complete with a faceoff between Obi-Wan and bounty hunter Jango Fett, a spaceship chase through the rings of Geonosis, a confrontation between a couple hundred Jedi and an army of droids, and a massive battle sequence between the Separatist droid army and an army of clones.  Topping off the movie is a lightsaber battle involving Christopher Lee's Count Dooku and Yoda.

  The movie's primary strength is developing the events which lead to the much stronger Episode III.  In the 10 years since the Trade Federation's blockade of Naboo was foiled, a Separatist movement has gained traction among hundreds of worlds in the Republic, fueled by the enigmatic Count Dooku.  While Chancellor Palpatine presides over a divided Senate, assassination attempts against former Queen (now Senator) Padme Amidala lead the Jedi to assign Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker to protect her.  A bounty hunter's failed attempt on Padme's life leads Obi-Wan to the distant world of Kamino, where he finds a surprising development: an army of clones is being raised for the Republic, as per the orders of a now-dead Jedi Council member.  Meanwhile, Padme and Anakin head to Naboo, where Anakin's nightmares eventually lead him to take Padme to Tattoine with him to find his mother.  Anakin's search leads him to the Lars homestead, where his mother's husband tells him that the Tusken Raiders kidnapped her.  When Anakin finds his mother dying after being tortured by the Sandpeople, his anger results in a wanton act of mass murder.  Obi-Wan's investigation leads him to the world of Geonosis, where he discovers that Count Dooku has enlisted the forces of an old foe, among others, to help the Separatists prepare for war on the Republic.  With this threat looming, the Chancellor is given emergency powers (proposed in the Senate by none other than Jar-Jar Binks, who is mercifully absent for most of the movie), and the available Jedi scramble to Geonosis to try to stop Dooku.  The final 40 or so minutes of the movie manage to make up for the shortcomings liberally sprinkled throughout the proceedings.

  Visually speaking, this movie is incredible, albeit a bit artificial looking.  The live action characters don't always seem to mesh with the computer-generated backdrops, but the color saturation is brilliant, and sets the tone well.  The transfer to DVD was done very well, apparently being a direct digital print.  The music alternates between magnificently appropriate, and ridiculously purile.  The sound effects are fairly standard Star Wars, although there are a couple of really bizarre and out of place sounds.  The DVD release itself has the typical wealth of Star Wars extras, including deleted scenes and trailers.  The commentary track is remarkably boring, to the point that a friend of mine actually said it literally puts him to sleep.

  It does pain me to give this movie only 3 stars, as I enjoyed it, especially when the Battle of Geonosis erupted.  The slow unfolding of the plot to turn the Republic into the Empire is an important arc in the Star Wars saga.  But objectively speaking, the acting and dialogue were bad enough to cripple the film in a number of ways, and I have to try to be honest with viewers.  If you're a Star Wars fan, you probably should get this, if you haven't already.  For everyone else, it will be a matter of whether they can deal with bad acting and dialogue in exchange for the excellent visuals and rich universe the film presents.",1189296000,,5848,4.899287894201424

What I did like about this is the action scenes, a definite upgrade from the first, secondly, the characters (except for Hayden Christensen) really matured with this movie.  I loved Liam Neeson in the first but the others made up for the loss.  The inclusion of shots like the Death Star and Count Dooku really made this special.

1310303,3,B00003CXKT,"I'll start off with the positive. This is a significantly better film than Phantom Menace. That's because Jar Jar is what he should have been all along: a minor character that we see very little of and hear even less.

The action sequences are as good as always. My favorite part is, like usual, the big lightsaber fight at the end. Yoda with a lightsaber may seem out of place to some but he was refered to as a ""great warrior"" in The Empire Strikes Back. Now we get to see why. And the end is enjoyable (save the stupid R2D2/C3PO ""losing my head"" skit).

Now for the bad stuff. There are parts of this film that are no where near pleasurable to watch (and these parts take up a big junk of the movie). The most painful thing to watch in this film (for all the wrong reasons) is the ""love"" story between Anakin and Padme. Hayden Kristen is, I believe, the worst actor in the Star Wars movies (old and new). There is basically no chemistry between Anakin and Padme even though they're supposed to be madly in love with each other by the end of the movie. There are some lines between these two characters that are just embarrassing to quote (""your skin is softer than sand"").

The banal dialogue, the worst supporting actor ""winner"" Hayden Kristen, CGI in basically every scene, the botched love story between Anakin and Padme, R2D2/C3PO's ""comic relief"", and on and on and on. This film is, at best, a mixed bag.

All of this would be a RiffTrax dream come true - but making it even dream come true-ier is that Mike and Kevin are joined by none other than Chad Vader, brother of Darth and star of his own colossally successful internet series. It is quite simply a RiffTacular RiffStravaganza!",1186617600,,1040,4.6521739130434785
1310429,4,B00003CXKT,"I originally wrote this review for Superman Returns, but since complaints for that movie parallel those of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones. I'll vent here as well.

Where has all the charm an chemistry gone?  Han Solo had charm.  Han and Leia had chemistry.  The special effects weren't great (good for their time, but definitely not great) so the Star Wars movies depended on its characters' charisma and chemistry to carry the story.  Aside from Jar Jar Binks the lack of the aforementioned is what killed Lucas' episode 1-3 debacle. Sure the special effects and action were great, but what of the story?  Medichlorians??

That brings me to Superman Returns.  Reeve had charm. Reeve's Clark and Kidder's Lois had real chemistry! The special effects weren't great (good for their time, but definitely not great) so the movie depended on it's characters', charisma and chemistry to carry the story. Deja Vu?  Anakin and Padme had the flame of a wet rag and the same holds true for the new Lois and Clark.  Everyone seemed lost and depressed.  I can understand Lois being upset that ""Superman"" left, but our new hero didn't put much effort into winning her back.  Oh, gee lets go for a BORING flight and see if that works.  Is this the same couple from the roof of Lois' apartment?  ""What color underwear am I wearing?""  WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOLLYWOOD?  Remember when Rock-N-Roll was fun?  Poison, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi?  The lyrics weren't deep, but they were fun.  Then along came Nirvana and the grunge days and depression and anger ruled the airwaves.  The same is happening in our movies!  Where's the fun?  ""Don't worry miss.  I've got you.  If you've got me. Who's got you?""  ""I'd rather kiss a Wookie.  I can arrange that!"" Man, I sure miss the fun!

1310433,4,B00003CXKT,"I'm not a HUGE fan of episodes 1 through 3. However, I AM a huge star wars fan so I took that into account when viewing this movie. The fact is it's a better movie than part 1, plain and simple. You get to see Anakin becoming a jedi and taking his first steps toward losing himself. You learn about an impatient side to him that will ultimately be his undoing.

The movie itself focuses on Anakin's many relationships. That with his mother, with Padme, the Jedi Council, Obi-Wan and, of course, the man that would be Emperor Palpatine. For the importance of forwarding the plot, this movie was vitally important to the series. As a movie in general, I was not entirely impressed. I felt like Anakin was portrayed as way too immature for the man that would ultimately become Darth Vader. In episodes 4, 5 and 6, Darth Vader is ultimate Evil. Are we supposed to buy that ultimate evil was borne out of a whiney teenager?

On second thought, maybe that IS the source of the ultimate evil in the universe.",1183593600,,1001,4.434782608695652
1310434,4,B00003CXKT,"It is rarely remembered that the original title to the original STAR WARS novel was STAR WARS: BEING THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF LUKE SKYWALKER. Why George Lucas failed to subtitle his prequel trilogy STAR WARS: THE ADVENTURES OF ANAKIN SKYWALKER is a mystery, since that is exactly what he's given us. In point of fact, the six films together are the biography of the rise and fall and rise of Anakin Skywalker. After stretching twenty five minutes of storyline over 125 minutes of celluloid in STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE, in STAR WARS EPISODE II: THE ATTACK OF THE CLONES Lucas has successfully returned to his original source material, Joseph Campbell's work on myths and archetypes.

Taking place ten Earth years after THE PHANTOM MENACE, CLONES gives us the late adolescent Anakin Skywalker, now a Padawan Apprentice Jedi, and his older (but still young) mentor and teacher Obi-Wan Kenobi. Mythologically, the two are not only The Mentor and Student (Merlin and Arthur), they are also The Twin Companions (Castor and Pollux, Romulus and Remus, Damon and Pythias), as well as being The Rival Brothers (Cain and Abel, Isaac and Ishmael, Esau and Jacob). Lucas's decision to present these multiply-layered characterizations reflects the complexity of the plot in CLONES, by far the most ambitious of any STAR WARS film.

Anakin (Hayden Christiansen) is the most brilliant and talented Jedi ever, but he is immature, impatient, mercurial, and given to very typical adolescent bouts of angst and anger, all of which foreshadow his looming fate. Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) is fast becoming one of the most accomplished Jedi masters. He is stolid, foursquare, reasoned and ultimately unimaginative, being, in the last analysis, unable to restrain his young apprentice.

The conflict between them is reflected on a galactic level. Separatists, led by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) are taking star systems out of the Republic by the thousand, and the Jedi are at the forefront of trying to reunite the Republic. An increasingly marginalized Senate has voted Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) vast emergency powers for the duration of the crisis. More Hitler-like than Lincoln-like, the ambitious Palpatine has no intention of relinquishing those powers.

The Separatists have massed a huge army of (less than impressive, silly-looking, easily-destroyed, duck-faced) battle-droids (where are the Stormtroopers in white?) and an even more tremendous army of clones. The outnumbered Republic forces are forced to adopt the Separatist strategy of using droids and clones as well, until the two sides are virtually indistinguishable. What no one but the leadership realizes is that the two sides ARE indistinguishable; in fact, there are no sides. Palpatine is secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, and Count Dooku is his apprentice Sith Lord, Darth Tyranus. Together, they have machinated the entire war to overthrow the Republic and establish Sith control of the galaxy.

At the center of this maelstrom (both personal and galactic) is Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Her crucial Senatorial vote is courted by the power-hungry Palpatine. Her life is threatened by Count Dooku. Her heart is in the keeping of Anakin, now assigned to protect her. At first resistant to his romantic attentions, the older Padme soon succumbs to the younger Anakin's overwhelming love for her. It is a tragic, jealous love which leaves Anakin's soul in torment and his thoughts consumed with the fear of losing her.

Despite his rigorous Jedi training, Anakin continues to be emotional and impulsive. Seeing his mother, Shmi, tortured in a vision, he returns to Tatooine to rescue her. When she dies in his arms, his rage explodes, and he kills the responsible community of Tusken Raiders down to the babies, his first true step toward the Dark Side of The Force.

Portman is the jewel of the piece as she was in THE PHANTOM MENACE, but Christiansen gives us a surprisingly powerful performance as the profoundly conflicted Anakin. Even his occasional stiffness fits the late-teenage character of Anakin, who like most adolescents does not know who he is or where he is going. Overly pressured by Jedi expectations to be ""the Chosen One who will restore balance to The Force,"" Anakin lacks the maturity and insight to cope with this role thrust upon him too soon, and uses his powers too casually, too carelessly, and even destructively. He clings to the maternal Padme obsessively, and rages that ""Obi-Wan is holding me back!"" out of jealousy, but left to his own devices, accomplishes little but to confuse himself more. ""Young Skywalker is in terrible pain,"" Yoda tells Master Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) but none of these wise and reverend Jedi seem to have the skill to help him. They can barely help themselves, needing to be rescued from Count Dooku in the end by the clones. Truly, their ""ability to use The Force is diminished.""

This, the middle, is the best installment of the second trilogy. In terms of story and action, it is on a par with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, also the middle film of the first trilogy. ATTACK OF THE CLONES is also a crucial incremental step in the PARADISE LOST-like story of Anakin, who, like Lucifer, was the brightest of the angels but doomed to fall from heaven and become Satan.

Despite the fineness of this film it was not the critical success it should have been. This reviewer felt an inexplicable, vague sense of unease while watching it. Many others have said the same thing. It was not until a fourth or fifth viewing that the reason for this uneasiness struck home. ATTACK OF THE CLONES was created almost totally with digital filmmaking techniques. Although Digital and CGI have advanced technologically far enough along to give us an appearance of reality, they cannot substitute for reality. Thus, while most of the ""inorganic"" items in the film have a very real look, and the planetary city of Coruscant is absolutely intriguing to view, many of the ""organic"" backgrounds, the alien creatures, and sometimes even the droids and the sets, have an artificial feel to them, less seen than sensed, which disturbs we human beings on some visceral level. No matter how ""natural"" a computer can make a desert rock formation look, a computer is still a binary code machine, and it can only provide a ""non-random randomness"" to the scene. The stones are just an erg-fraction too sharp-edged, the mist is just a molecule too misty, the fall of the shadows is just a bit too angular, and it all lacks the subtle aliveness of an actual location.

At the end of THE RETURN OF THE JEDI, Lucas celebrated the victory of life over technology; by relying so heavily on special effects in ATTACK OF THE CLONES he undoes that victory.",1183334400,,6751,5.014272970561998
1310435,4,B00003CXKT,"Between some of Lucas's questionable dialogue, not to mention the Geonosis C-3PO parts, and Portman's wooden performance, AOTC came way too close to being a disaster.  I'm not sure what possessed George to hold back on showing Anakin as the powerful Jedi he was supposed to be but it was a bad decision.  Anakin's duel with Dooku should've been better in content & directing.  But again, there's few movies I'd rather watch than SW because of the good stuff.

Even though I still question the wisdom of killing off Maul in TPM, I love Dooku.  He's the ultimate precise, smug second fiddle.  And can you get a better henchman than Jango Fett?  I loved the mystery surrounding him & Kamino as well as Geonosis.  I get chills everytime I watch the first appearance of the future Stormtroopers.  Anakin's first encounter with the Dark Side seemed very natural.  It was nice to hear the `Imperial March' theme twice too.  It was also a welcome scene to see Yoda go Jedi Master on somebody.",1180483200,,984,4.662790697674419
1310436,5,B00003CXKT,"Okay, I'm tired of all these people coming on here and complaining about how they hated this movie. The people who don't like the Prequel Trilogy are really missing out on the deeper and complete meaning of the Star Wars saga. They have to remember that this trilogy is set in a different era than Episodes 4, 5, and 6. This is the era of the Republic and the Jedi Order, which aren't present in 4, 5, and 6 because they were destroyed by the rise of Palpatine's Empire at the end of Episode 3. Episode 2 is very important  because here we see Anakin's character development. Crucial events occur that will lead up to him turning to the dark side. The death of Anakin's mother, his marriage to Padme, and his friendship with Obi-Wan, as well as Anakin's strained relationship with the Jedi Council are all extremely important elements in the saga. Also present is Palpatine's manipulation and deception of politics in the galaxy and the guise of his grandfatherly-like relationship with Anakin. We need to see all these things in order to understand the story better. Star Wars is the story of Anakin Skywalker told in six episodes, and each one is important, because the story would be incomplete and not make sense if one episode was missing.

1310540,1,B00003CXKT,"""The Phantom Menace"" was always a strange animal to me.  The first Star Wars movie in roughly fifteen years and the first chapter of a trilogy intended to flesh out the story of Anakin Skywalker's transformation into one of cinema's most recognizable villains, was among us.  Yet upon release, that chapter depicts him as a child who, as far as I could tell, only had a supporting role in what was essentially the movie's B-story.  That always puzzled me greatly.  That, along with the fact that, even when little Anakin did have any substantial screen time, the young Obi-Wan Kenobi was half a planet away, and the hippie-esque Qui-Gon Jinn, (granted a very likable character) came out of nowhere, and took on the role of the one who discovered and began to mentor the Skywalker child.  Not only that, but I even got the hint that this younger Obi-Wan actually opposed the idea of Anakin receiving Jedi training!  After hearing the ghostly Ben's brief description in ""Return of the Jedi"" of how things first transpired back in his day, about how impressed he was with Anakin's sensitivity with the Force and how he ""took it upon himself to train him as a Jedi,"" I found myself scratching my head upon seeing these events unfold in such a manner.

What really bothered me about this was how little it did for the relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan.  I mean sure, they met in Phantom Menace, but that was it.  There wasn't really any bonding or chance for them to grow close or anything like that.  It really did nothing for their relationship, which disappointed me a great deal.  I used to love to hear wise Ben regale Luke with tales of the times when he and Anakin fought side by side, how he was such a great warrior, and what a good friend he was.  ""Phantom Menace"" just kept them so far apart the majority of the time, and all those old tales from the original films were *still* just some far off fairy tale.  I couldn't believe it when the first new Star Wars movie in more that two and half decades just shrugged off that aspect of the backstory.

Naturally when I started to see news on Episode II, delightfully titled, ""Attack of the Clones,"" I was thrilled when I saw a bearded Obi-Wan and a young adult Anakin standing together.  I was convinced that this would be the one that would establish the close friendship of Anakin and Obi-Wan, and I'd also get to see Anakin's fabled skills in combat.  Hey, at this point in the timeline, these two characters have been side by side for a decade and Anakin's been training to be a Jedi during all that time.  Why shouldn't I expect to finally see what Ben was talking about come to life before my eyes at long last?  Unfortunately, once I actually saw the movie for myself, I realized having Anakin so far off to the side and a world away from Obi-Wan wasn't the worst idea after all.

Upon taking center stage, Anakin Skywalker makes himself out to be a surprisingly surly, ill-tempered fellow, which seems very un-Jedi-like to me.  I mean granted younger Jedi tend to go through a sort of gung-ho phase, even Luke had moments when he flared up, but this guy is just downright crabby.  He just seems to have this sense of entitlement throughout the movie, insisting he is ready to advance to Jedi Knighthood.  Yet I never got the sense he wanted to achieve such status because he wanted to do good, but because he felt it was owed to him.  Obi-Wan claims this attitude is because of Anakin's ""exceptional abilities,"" which have made him arrogant.  In fact there are several times during the movie in which characters claim Anakin possesses great Jedi skills for his young age, resulting in his uppity mood.  This would make sense, were it not for the fact that he can barely hold his own in a fight.  Just about every battle Anakin is involved with end with him either surrendering and getting captured, or just flat-out getting his butt kicked.  It's absurd.  I think my favorite example of this is how the climactic lightsaber duel with Count Dooku ends with our dashing young hero holding his arm out for a ridiculously long period of time, allowing his opponent to leisurely twirl around and lop it off.  Or maybe it's when he stumbles about a droid making factory, gets his arm riveted to the floor, then gets his lightsaber destroyed which leads to his immediate capture.  ""Exceptional abilities,"" indeed!  This was far from what I was expecting in the character after being lead to believe he was such a cunning warrior.  Having the characters simply talk of this is one thing, but to show me so much evidence to the contrary really hurt my experience.

Even more startling, it seems that Anakin clearly hates Obi-Wan's guts, and rails on and on about how utterly unbearable it is being under his tutelage.  At best he harbors a grudging respect for his teacher, but that's as good as it gets.  When it comes down to it, Anakin does not enjoy Obi-Wan's company, nor is he grateful for his lessons, and I wouldn't be surprised if one of the reasons he wants to advance to the level of Knight is to get away from his master.  I have a tough time believing this is the stuff Obi-Wan was thinking about when he told Luke about his earlier years with his former student and friend.  Again, there is some talk that these two are friends, but what I saw for myself was two guys who did not get along at all.

Obi-Wan himself is not so innocent either.  While I understand the character is younger here, and not meant to be a wizened old wizard, he is certainly not the reservoir of wisdom I generally think of him being.  This Obi-Wan is snide and sarcastic, and doesn't have much else to say to his apprentice than smarmy quips, even during the rare moment he does something well.  Case in point, during the flying car chase scene in the first act, after being rescued from plummeting to certain death by Anakin, the only thing Obi-Wan can say in response is, ""What took you so long?""  What a jerk.  Maybe he'd prefer it if Anakin tilted the vehicle off to the side and sent his ""wise"" mentor back on his way to a fatal drop.  I'm starting to think Anakin's real problem is the fact that his teacher is a total heel.  It's pretty disturbing to think that ten years of Jedi training with Obi-Wan Kenobi would do more harm to Anakin's disposition than anything Palpatine could ever do.  Or perhaps it's the other way around.  Maybe Obi-Wan became grouchy after spending a decade with the irritable Anakin.

I think what really irks me about all this is how it weakened the impact of their battle at the end of, ""Revenge of the Sith.""  How upset am I supposed to be when I see these two clash after all this effort was put into making me think they couldn't stand each other?  How can I take it seriously when Obi-Wan started bawling about Anakin, ""being like his brother?""  They were about as brotherly as Cain and Abel in this movie.  The duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan at the end of this part of the mythos is supposed to be one of, if not, *the* most pivotal moments in the Star Wars timeline.  But thanks to this movie, it didn't mean nearly as much to me as it should have, and I was really saddened by that.  Having this dear friendship torn asunder because of Anakin's fall to the Dark Side would mean a lot more had there been a more worthwhile friendship to speak of in the first place.

Now this all leads me to the issue I have with this movie, along with a lot of movies I've been seeing these days.  There's this strange trend of having characters merely talk about some major aspect about a character or the story, yet little or nothing is shown.  This movie takes it to a terrible degree.  As I stated before, there is a lot of talk about Anakin being unusually powerful for his age, yet nothing is shown.  In fact, there was vast evidence to the contrary thrown at me many times.  I also heard several times that Obi-Wan is indeed Anakin's friend, but all I saw was two guys who just don't get along.  Again, I'm told one thing, yet shown something else.  Movies are supposed to be about depicting things visually, not just talking about it.  It certainly doesn't help when I'm shown the opposite of what I'm hearing.

After all this, I at last decided I flat out did not like Anakin Skywalker, nor did I care what happened to him.  For me, that is the perfect way to totally eliminate my interest in a movie and the events within.  If I don't like the protagonist in a movie, then nothing else in the movie matters to me.  Maybe that sounds petty, but think about it; if you don't like the main character, the character who everything centers around, why would you care about the events that occur around them?  That happened to me with this movie.  I found myself overtly disliking the legendary Anakin Skywalker and I had virtually no reason to respect or admire him.  What can I say?  I guess I don't find priding oneself for being such a formidable warrior without being able to back it up to be an admirable quality.  Because of that, I just didn't respond to anything else that happened in the movie.

It's really quite a shame this movie had to yield such a reaction from me for many reasons.  First of all, I feel really bad using such harsh words towards George Lucas' works.  He has been such a huge influence on the industry for so long and in such great ways, which is nothing to turn one's nose up at.  He has also been a big inspiration to me as well.  Star Wars was one of the things that really got me interested in motion pictures, and I really love the whole universe.  Plus, I'm sure a lot of hard work went into making this picture, as with all major films.  Most of all, I'm upset that this movie had to push me away so hard because a lot of really pivotal things occur within it.  Things like the initial creation of the Clone Troopers (naturally), the advancement of Palpatine's political career, and also the demise of Anakin's loving mother at the hands of the brutish Sand People all occur in this movie.  Hey, this is really crucial stuff, and I understand that.  Well, you know what else was crucial?  Making me believe that Anakin was a mighty Jedi and force for good in the galaxy, and that he and Obi-Wan were very dear friends.  Unfortunately, this movie not only did nothing to make me believe this, but rather it convinced me of the negative to a frightful degree.

What really gets me about this is the fact that there's no payoff for any of this.  I mean I used to think this was just an overabundance of foreshadowing to Anakin's dark fate, but after seeing, ""Revenge of the Sith,"" several times, I was shocked to see all this bitterness and hostility just completely dissipate.  Instead, that chapter actually does the job of making Anakin out to be a competent warrior, and he and Obi-Wan get along just fine.  Because of that, their adventures together in that movie were much more entertaining and interesting, and their duel at the end actually did have at least some impact.  Good grief, it gets to the point where Obi-Wan is the one Jedi who Anakin is initially reluctant to eliminate after siding with the evil Emperor.  Obi-Wan himself also hesitates to confront Anakin after discovering his turn to evil, claiming that he's more willing to confront Palpatine instead.  He'd rather throw himself at a monster like Darth Sidious than risk harming his dearest friend Anakin.

Meanwhile it's revealed that it was Anakin's fear of losing his beloved Padme that contributed to his decision to turn to the Dark Side, which I found much more interesting than it being just because he has an innate bad attitude.  So what was the point of these two having such a strained relationship in this movie?  All it did was rob their friendship of value so their battle at the end of it all was nearly neutered.  Anakin's arrogance and his bickering with Obi-Wan in this movie really didn't even play a role in the events that lead to Anakin making his transition from Jedi to Sith.

Really, if there was going to be some sort of tension between Anakin and another Jedi that had any meaningful payoff, it should have been with Mace Windu.  Just think, in, ""Phantom Menace,"" it was Windu who initially denied little Anakin's lifelong dream of receiving Jedi training.  Remember that nasty look he gave Windu at that moment too?  Then, during, ""Revenge of the Sith,"" it's hard to ignore the tension between them there as well.  Once again, Windu denies Anakin the rank of Master when Palpatine appoints him a seat in the exclusive Jedi Council, and the two of them have a nasty spat as a result.  Afterwards, Obi-Wan was far more sympathetic about it, and tried to ease Anakin's wounded ego after this slight.  Then by the end, Anakin had no qualm with cutting off Windu's arm to prevent him from hurting Palpatine.  Had, ""Attack of the Clones,"" explored Anakin's tension with Windu instead of Obi-Wan, it would have made much more sense to me.

Well, as upsetting as all this is, I was at least able to enjoy Episode III to a point.  The recent Clone Wars computer animated series also does a decent job of convincing me that Anakin and Obi-Wan really are friends, and that they're both capable warriors, more so than the other two prequel films ever did.  It also touches on the interesting subject of Anakin's attachment issues, which I like.  I'm really happy that George Lucas himself is involved with the show as well. That's encouraging.  There are some aspects of the prequel mythos that'll always bother me.  The whole, ""prophecy,"" business I hear about once in a while just isn't in keeping with the concept of the Force as I see it, and I never cared for the, ""midichlorian,"" idea for the same reason.  But most of the stuff I've been seeing in the CG animated TV series, along with, ""Revenge of the Sith,"" itself really do give me a lot of the elements I've been longing for in the Skywalker/Vader story.  I just wish this movie, with its pivotal placement in the storyline, was able to do the same.",1175299200,6,14019,4.512881490289338
1310541,5,B00003CXKT,"We all love George Lucas for creating the Star Wars Universe and introducing us to some of the best characters in movie history but lets face reality here, the man cannot write dialogue to save his life.  In the OT it wasn't as noticeable because the plot was not very complicated and the scenes were very straightforward, the foundation was already there.  The PT has to lay that foundation which George Lucas fails at.

So ignoring the wooden dialouge which produced stilted acting, it is a great movie nonetheless.  The plot gives the audience an idea how the Empire was created in the first place and gives you a glimpse into the dark side of Anakin and sets the audience up very nicely for his ultimate turn from the good side.  Also for a hopeless romantic such as myself I get to watch a couple fall in love when they're not supposed to and not let rules and regulations stand in their way.  Yes, romance is where GL fails miserably but its the story that counts.

Overall, in this movie as in TPM, there is a lot story and symbolism here which makes it stand out.  So my advice is to see the movie, and pay more attention to the story being told.  If nothing else, you'll get to hear some really beautiful music, see some cool special effects and see some cool costumes that you wish you had.",1174176000,2,1300,4.405857740585774
1310542,3,B00003CXKT,"Episode II is by far the best of the 3 new Star Wars episodes.  From the desert battlefield of Geonosis to the lush greenery of Naboo, and fierce rainstorms on Kamino, the scenery and backgrounds really accent this film nicely.

Padme's lake house on Naboo is phat!  It reminds me of my parents lake house, minus the marble floors, granite counters, Jedi Apprentice, and hot Jewish actress!

The one knock against George Lucas in Clones is that he tries to use the beginning/prequel card for Boba Fett, and it just doesn't really work for me, especially since Fett did not make an appearance in Episode III.  Seeing him as a kid, just didn't spark the same excitement of seeing Fett drooling over Han Solo encased in Carbonite in the freezing chamber on Bespin!

My favorite part from Attack of the Clones is Natalie Portman in her skanky, Princess Leia hand me down uniform when the monster's come out of the Roman Empire style arena!  Natalie is one of the most beautiful actesses on screen today, and I'm glad Lucas had the common sense to hire a classy person for his film!",1171670400,,1077,4.607329842931938
1310543,2,B00003CXKT,"After seeing the travesty that was episode one in the theatre I decided to give this one a try, assuming that it couldn't possibly get any worse. Was I right? Oh man, I was worse than right. I was wrong. The weak character development that took place with Anakin Skywalker in no way led me to believe that this person could eventually become Darth Vader. The character Anakin is such an undisciplined whiney little brat that it becomes utterly unbelievable that this kid could become a dreaded supervillian. On top of that, the chemistry between him and Padame was very weak. The supposed romance between them was devastated by mediocre acting and no real interesting dialogue.

So once again the special effects department has broken their backs carrying this movie. Without a strong plotline or interesting characters, this movie becomes not a story, but just an impressive light show. It seems as if George Lucas figured that if the technology that he has now is light years ahead of what he had twenty five years ago, then the audience won't need anything else. The special effects in the three 'prequel' movies was so inconsistent with the older films that they should have been released as a completely different story alltogether.

And finally we get to Yoda. A puppet that can bounce around and defy gravity with a lightsaber, but still needs a cane to walk. In the older films, Empire Strikes Back for example, Yoda was balancing on Luke's feet during his handstand. When Luke lost his balance and fell over, wouldn't Yoda be able to just use the force and gently float to the ground instead of tumbling to the ground out of control with him? Is that because of lack of special effects technology back then, or just Yoda was getting too old to use the force anymore? Just a little food for thought. I'll let you decide.

So once again the only plus in this film is the impressive visual effects. If your expecting more however then George Lucas will once again let you down.",1171497600,2,1983,4.692528735632184

1310614,2,B00003CXKT,"Years after its release I find myself writting what I consider a completely biast review for this film (being somewhat of a Star Wars fan had made it difficult to look at it with any negative light before). Let me first start by saying that my two daughters love the film. For me, I grew up watching the original Star Wars (now titled Episode IV, A New Hope). When the original Star Wars came out, it changed the way people looked at Sci-Fi. I saw it several times just to be able to focus on the different aspects of the sets, props, costumes, etc. It was the best eye-candy of its time by far. Substance became less of an important factor and if the movie had a couple of ""holes"" in the story we forgave it and watched-on mesmerized by its visual splendor and the likability of its characters. Almost thirty years later the panorama is completely different. Star Wars movies still hold the bar for special effects but in a computer-generated world, amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial, even the lowest budget Sci-Fi television show has special effects that are somewhat convincing or at least cool to look at. Effects do not make a movie and ""Attack of the Clones"" is more about effects than story or even acting for that matter. Awfully silly dialogue doesn't help it neither. In retrospect, I wish that George Lucas would have come up with two completely different droids than C3PO and R2D2 (the latter even flies! Imagine that, more capabilities than in the future). This premise is even absurd for the world of Star Wars. According to the story, Luke Skywalker and his uncle Owen in episode four bought two droids that are about thirty to forty years old. As I'm typing this review I can imagine myself typing it with a Royal ribbon typewriter, that just wouldn't happen. It is scary to find things that are even too far-fetched for the world that Lucas created but the movie is full of them. He doesn't really give any explanation in the whole trilogy (I,II,III) as to why in the future the ships are not as cool or look and act clunkier, or why everything looks dated thirty years from now. In his world technology goes backwards and not the other way around. I, however have a solution for all these. George Lucas should keep meddling with the original trilogy until all that is left from the original films is the faces of the protagonists. Everything else should be computer re-generated in order to keep pace with a future more in sync with its past. Then, you could buy all versions of the original trilogy (IV,V,VI). As originally shot, the revised version that we all saw in re-release on the theaters, and the ""Ultimate Enhanced Version"" to better match the second trilogy (I,II,III). Maybe he could even re-edited where the actors look as if they had no personalities and change the dialog to sound more confusing. Then, you would have a whole set of six films that look fantastic but lack in every other aspect of story telling (ie., compelling characters, continuity, interesting plotlines, etc). The only reason I give the movie two stars is because the wonderful effects created by ILM still makes the film worth watching at least once. Otherwise, I rather watch ""Serenity"" which has a more Star Wars feel to it than this Star Wars film. The nickname of ""Mannequin"" to ""Annakin"" is well-deserved as it is any negatives regarding the characters of this poorly told story.",1169510400,4,3409,4.692821368948247

What Einstein thought of taking cue after cue of music from the first film and cutting and pasting into this film?  As a huge Williams film, this RUINED substantial portions of the film for me, such as the Jedi arena battle sequence.  I couldn't get into it, thinking that, ""Hey, this is the music when they tried to gas Qui-Gon in the first film...""

Shameless George.  Shameless.  You'd be NOTHING without Williams music, and you treated his music like reusable garbage in this film.",1163548800,6,702,4.604838709677419

1310621,3,B00003CXKT,"I actually liked ""Attack Of The Clones,"" but it's despite the important plot points included in it's story.

The faults of ""Phantom Menace"" are still here, don't get me wrong - Lucas's directing and dialogue writing are still too weak, showing again he benefitted by having more hands involved in the first trilogy - and yet it was nice to see the hows and whys of the Galactic Republic's ultimate collapse begin.  It was also great to see the emergence of the ""Grand Army of the Republic"" and finally get a glimpse of the heretofore hinted-at ""Clone Wars.""  And, let's not take anything away from Lucas, we do see his great strength on display in great action sequences that do drop the jaw today as they did in years past.  If only he stuck to that.....

And still I can't get over the fact that I didn't ""feel"" what I was supposed to in one of the most important events in his ""Star Wars"" universe - namely any sense of real warmth in what was supposed to be a love story that shaped galactic destinies.  Hayden Christiansen shows great potential as an actor - see one of his other works, ""Stained Glass"" for how much - and Natalie Portman is truly a main reason to see these films, but I felt no real chemistry between them.  None.  Zip.  Which makes all that purple prose Lucas has them spewing in what's supposed to be moments of smoldering passion that much more ludicrous.  Add to that the idea of Lucas casting Christiansen because he could act out the ""dark"" parts of Anakin's personality, and curiously had him hold back on it throughout this picture.  What we have left is an Anakin more petulent and whiny than simmerlingly conflicted.  The only real hint of humanity and true gravitas we get from him is when his mother dies, and when he describes how he massacred the Sand People.  We should have seen more of the brooding under the surface of Anakin trying to do the right thing.

And still, there were other things that buoyed thoe production up, as in great casting with other characters.  Ewan MacGregor was BORN to play Obi-Wan, it seems.  The aforementioned Portman gets to shine as well, because she is that damned good with anything she's given.  No china-doll heroine she, as Lucas puts her right in front of the action.  A strength in him as well, because his females - in a genre usually appreciated more by men than women - are strong and capable of wielding a blaster as much as any masculine character.

Is it ""talky""?  Yes, particularly during the ""political"" aspects of story.  This is to be expected.  Does anyone know of political claptrap that DOESN'T require talking?  I also liked the fact that the feckless Jar Jar is responsible for giving Palpatine (the most excellent Ian McDiarmid) his powers to wreck havok on the universe, but it's because, admittedly, I hate Jar Jar.

Still flawed, to be sure, but ""Attack of the Clones"" is a good movie, and much more essential to the Lucas mythology.",1160956800,6,2930,4.5796545105566215

1310623,1,B00003CXKT,"Picking up 10 years later, Anakin Skywalker is no longer an adorable if stoic little kid but now a tall, gangly, jerky young man (Hayden Christensen) with a tendency to whine and bitch about stuff for no apparent reason (takes things way too personally he does). Well, him and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are assigned to protect former queen turned senator Padme (Natalie Portman) after ten years apart from an assassin. This job eventually leads to Obi-Wan being separated from Anakin while he investigates the assassin who happens to be involved with a cloning conspiracy and this later leads him to a renegade Jedi master played by Christopher Lee. Guess what? Anakin still has the hots for Padme and whilst Obi-Wan is away Anakin would like nothing better than to strip her naked and get her in the sack. The future Darth Vader also has a nightmare about his mom's death back on Tatioone and he FINALLY goes to rescue her but by the time he gets there she's already dead so he goes and kills the cannibal Sand People who killed her.

This is one of those films that leaves you wondering ""How did this EVER get green lit?"" The answer is that it got green lit because of George Lucas's success with the original trilogy and the fact that he backed the film up with his own money and what not. This leads to another question: ""How could anyone have thought that this was a good script?"" The answer is no one, but they signed on to it anyway because they all knew they'd get paychecks and they knew people would come out in droves to see it and make it a hit regardless of whether it's good or not. I remember watching ""Phantom Menace"" and coming away feeling like ""What happened? HOW could this have happened?""

How many things are wrong with this film? Well, I think we all agree that the title sucks so I won't dwell on that for too long. One of the big things working against this movie is the fact that the character relationships, which should be the meat of the film, are never fully defined and/or explored (a similar problem afflicted 2003's ""Daredevil""). George Lucas keeps TELLING us a bunch of things in interviews, but he doesn't depict them particularly well. He TOLD us that Anakin and Obi-Wan were good friends and he TOLD us that Anakin and Padme fall in love, but the manner in which he plays it out is very forced, ersatz and unbelievable. At this point, Anakin's relationship with Obi-Wan is starting to deteriorate; this is a good thing, but it makes very little sense as depicted because the relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan, which should have been the main focus of ""Menace"", was never explored or established in PM, thanks to the continuity error of Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn character. Ultimately what we're left with is the impression that these two never liked each other much; the only hint of friendship we get is when Obi-Wan tries to comfort Anakin about his nightmares of his mother's death.

Which leads to one of the biggest problems with the film - Anakin's mother. It was hard enough to believe that Anakin actually LEFT his mom in PM, but it's even harder to believe that ten years have passed and Anakin never bothered to go back and rescue her from Tatioone. Seeing as how the Jedi Knights are supposed to be great heroes and humanitarians, it's hard to believe that the Jedi - least of all Obi-Wan Kenobi - would not allow Anakin to go back for his mom, especially when you consider how much easier it would have made training him. Or the fact that Padme was rich from being an ""elected queen"" (I can't stand that crap) and could very easily have paid the money to free the Skywalker mother. And when he's too late to save her, Anakin goes on a killing spree against the Sand People; okay, they beat his mom to a pulp, I admit that will p*** a guy off, but the circumstances surrounding it simply make no sense, dramatically or logistically.

Don't forget the poorly illustrated relationship between Anakin and the future Emperor either (Ian McDiarmid, now playing the young version of his villain from ""Return of the Jedi"").

The much hyped love story is also unpleasant, despite a nicely done love theme by John Williams. The majority of it is Anakin leering at Padme like some kind of lusty, sex starved stalker who can't wait to tear all her clothes off and rape the hell out of her and she clearly doesn't like it. Then again, I guess it's hard NOT to leer at a girl like Natalie Portman when everything she wears is either strapless, backless, or gutless. For someone who's a proponent of anti-sleaze in films, Natalie goes out on quite a limb here, even donning black leather (it's like porn for Star Wars fans). The age difference is also an annoying little factor, thus spawning the question of what the older and considerably more mature Padme sees in the future Darth Vader. Bad boy nothing, he continually goes flying off the handle for no apparent reason, even by growing pains standards, and then he goes on the aforementioned killing spree and instead of horrifying her and revolting her it only seems to get her to fall in love with him. I'm all for tragic, doomed love affairs but the truth is that there's no real reason for these two to get together except that Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia need a mom. And what was up with the line about hating sand?

Politics are not particularly well done either. Having Jar Jar Binks back and having him play a key role in the rise of the Empire - convincing the senate to okay the creation of the Clone Army thus starting the Clone Wars mentioned in the original film - is quite insulting.

The acting is a mixed bag at best. Ewan McGregor manages to make the young Obi-Wan (who now looks like Jesus Christ) a somewhat poetic and likable figure, whilst Samuel L. Jackson is a capable Jedi and Christopher Lee does his usual larger than life villain. Natalie Portman, as cute as she may be, can't make heads nor tails of her Padme, always talking in a flat, high pitched voice that makes her sound too much like a girl and not enough like a woman. Hayden Christensen tries hard but he's either too stiff as Anakin or he's just annoying and, ultimately, he comes off as a sadistic creep. It's not like Al Pacino in the Godfather, where his character was a smart, honorable, well intentioned man who was blind-sided by his own ruthless ambitions. Then again, Christensen doesn't really have much to work with, does he?

There are a few neat sequences - the hover chase after Jango Fett, the gladiator arena pitting Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme against a bunch of beasts, the sight of a bunch of Jedi lighting up their light sabers (don't miss the Jedi who looks like a cone head and the green Jedi with the dread locks), and of course, Yoda's fight with Christopher Lee (but I could have done without the Bruce Lee crowing). However, I have a hard time believing that all these Force powered Jedi could get killed by mindless robots.

Kind of makes you wonder how often George Lucas ventures out from his ranch.",1159056000,7,7029,4.567803330689928

Well, combining the inane dialog, clunky plot, unconvincing special effects, the acting on the level of a high-school play, and the cut-and-paste aliens, this was my reaction: I could buy it as a made-for-TV Star Wars ripoff, but how did it ever get into theaters? Just goes to show what a famous franchise can pull off.

In short, don't even rent it!",1157155200,5,396,4.577464788732394
1310729,3,B00003CXKT,"After the harsh words I had for Episode One (see my other reviews on Amazon.com), I must admit that I liked 'Attack of the Clones' a good deal more than I had expected to. While I still wouldn't consider it on par with the originals, this film (unlike Phantom Menace), is a good movie in its own right, and is worth a look.

The story gets much stronger here, and the characterization better. Lucas still handles exposition with his customary hippo-on-rollerskates gracefullness; telegraphing, even sky-writing, every plot move lest anyone should miss it; and the dialogue is still choppy at parts. But this time I could read (""between the lines"", as it were) the story that Lucas *intended* to tell; and though much diluted, a bit of the old Star Wars magic remains.

The gimmicks are mostly gone; except for when Dex, the fat diner cook, pulls up his pants to conceal his green, alien [...]-crack; and then there is the matter of Jango Fett's pistol-twirling business in the arena; but apart from that, Lucas pretty much ""plays it strait"". This is a most welcome improvement over the spoof-laden Episode One, which had more tongue-in-cheek moments than a Mel Brooks film. Lucas: You don't want to sell me gimmicks; you want to go home and re-think your life. I greatly appreciate your consideration on this matter.

By way of passing, it should not go unremarked that several elements from Frank Herbert's 'Dune' saga have been taken over here. ""Spice mining"" is openly spoken of on one occasion. The cloners of Kamino are all-to-obviously the analogues of Herbert's Tlilaxu, right down to the fact that both planets lie ouside the boundaries of law and order in their respective universes. The shape-shifting assassin in the beginning is nothing but a Tlilaxu face-dancer, and the Fett clones are somewhat related to the numerous ""golas"" made of Duncan Idaho. This is not so much a detraction from the story as it is an example of artistic license and reinterpretation. I understand that all storytellers borrow liberally from one another; it's just the nature of the business. I just thought I'd mention it in order to prove that I was paying attention.

The special effects were superb. While the creatures still looked a little fake, the battles and explosions were incredible. I especially liked the duel between Obi-wan and Jango Fett. Their cat-and-mouse game in the asteroid field was awesom as well. The boys at ILM sure have perfected the aesthetics of disintegrating rocks, if nothing else. I never bothered to see this movie on the big screen; Episode One being such a stinker, I figured it wasn't worth it. That's too bad; it must have been an amazing experience.

The best aspect of this film was the knock-out performance delivered by Ewen McGregor as Obi-wan Kenobi. It is rumored that Plato once referred to his student, Aristotle, as a fawn that drains his mother dry of milk and then kicks her, so insatiable was his appetite for knowledge. I couldn't help but be reminded of that story as I watched Ewen play the role of Anakin's patient but worn-out master. If there was an Academy Award given out for ""best rescue of a mediocre movie by a fine actor"", Ewen would win at least two, possibly three of them for his work on Star Wars. I would describe all the other performances as 'average'. It's just a shame that Christopher Lee didn't get the opportunity to stretch his legs a little more, and was reduced to reprising his Saruman-role as the leader of a mass-produced, evil army. Same character, different picture. I hope he doesn't end up permanently type-cast like that.

Come join Obi-Wan, Padme, Anakin, and the two droids for their most ridiculous adventure yet. In this movie you get to listen to Anakin wine like a disturbed child with ADHD and rage issues. We get to see Padme momentarily seduced by Anakin, and for whatever reason, she finally falls for him. Yes, Padme, the former queen, falls in love with Anakin, the emotionally twisted psychopath.

What were you thinking when you made this movie, George? Were you trying to appease brain-dead preteens? Or were you honestly trying to make any effort at continuity at all? Sometimes I think Lucas never cared about the direction in the Prequel Trilogy, and only wanted to experiment with hours of CGI. Yes, CGI can be amazing. But that is not the only reason I watch a Star Wars movie. I watch Star Wars for the desperate storyline, the convincing character development, and the astounding action. Lucas has failed the Prequel Trilogy. 'Attack of the Clones' might not be as bad as 'The Phantom Menace', but it is terrible nonetheless.

I would like to send my pity and regards to the actors who chose to do this. We all make mistakes. But people like Hayden Christensen, Natalie Portman, and Ewan McGregor were all neglected as true actors in this movie.

I waited for the new films like a small kid waiting for a big surprise, and right now, I can't explain how disappointed I am with these new movies, specially with EP II.

Episode I, well I think it was slow because you're beginning to tell the story, you need to start at some point, it was good, but my expectations were on the next one, EP II, like Lucas did with Empire Strikes Back (for me, the best of the star wars movies ever).

With EP II I don't know what Lucas did, I mean, this was a love movie, he focus a lot with the love scene and the romance between Anakin and Padme, bla, bla, bla. I don't know, maybe Cameron help him write the script for this one 

My point is, I already know that Anakin was going to meet this person and then the twins will come. Please Lucas, spare me the details of that, I don't want to know if Anakin talked with her parents or ask permission, etc, etc. What I really wanted to know is how the Jedi will fall, and how the Republic will fall, those are the details that I did want to know, and those were the details that you saw them in this movie, but just fragments of them.

Even the novel adaptation for this one was bad.

Another thing that I really hate, was that @$#% title, Attack of the Clones, what is that???? Was he watching attack of the killing tomatoes when he came up with the title, or watching Attack of the killing bees (I don't know if that exists, but could have been a good one).

I don't know, taking with my friends, which are big fans of star wars too, we all agree in one thing. Did Lucas write EP 4, 5 and 6? I mean, how can a guy that wrote something so good, now that he has the ability to write something even better, instead of doing that, he wrote or produce something like this.

1310734,1,B00003CXKT,"This particular installment in the series only had one good thing going for it.  The lightsaber battles.  Actually that's probably the only good thing about the prequels.  I had no emotional attachment to any characters, and the script/acting did not move me.  A good scene was the slaughtering of the sand people, and a necessary scene to establish that Anakin slowly but surely is crossing over to the dark side.  Mr. Lucas, it's the journey and not the destination I cared about.  To demonstrate the silliness of the movie, I call your attention to the scene where Anakin confesses to Padme that he's just slaughtered the men, women, children, and animals of the sand people huts.  The dialogue is not exact.

Anakin:  ""...and not just the men.  The women, and children too.  They were animals!!  And I slaughtered them like animals!""

Padme:  ""Well that's OK.  We all get angry sometimes, to err is human.""

What!?  lol.  Padme was a queen of a world, and was so good at her job that her people wanted to re-elect her.  Presumably she was of strong moral fiber, and a very strong character.  A character necessary to help keep a fiery passionate character like Anakin grounded in reality.  Script and characters were not true to themselves here.

Then to make it somewhat comical, in the third movie ""Revenge of the Sith"", Padme discovers that Anakin killed children in the Jedi temple.  Her line is ""I don't even know you!!!  I can't believe what I'm hearing"".

What, Padme?  Slaughtering a sand people village was OK, but killing children was a step too far?  What, it didn't occur to you that your husband had a capacity for violence?  Pretty dim-witted for a queen/senator.

A note to George Lucas:  I was a kid when i saw the first 3 Star Wars movies.  I went to see all of them many times in the theaters, and I still watch them today.  They have value even after so many years after they were made.  Do you not know why?  It was the journey, George.  The characters were excellent, they were likeable.  I cared what happened to them, there was chemistry between them.  You moved away from that idea, this thing called ""story telling"" with these movies and while I thought the light saber battles were cool it just wasn't enough.  Star Wars came out of your mind, but you inspired millions, and what came of it inspired an entire universe.  Because it was yours I suppose it's yours to destroy, but I'm sorry to have seen it end this way.",1153094400,7,2448,4.591647331786543
1310735,1,B00003CXKT,"What do you get when you mix a director passed his prime with an embarrassing screenplay, weak acting, and terrible direction? You get the mess that is called ""Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones"". This movie proved several things to me, that high budget computer technology cannot make a good movie without a REAL emotional attachment from the writer. This movie also proved you need a moviemaker, who truly cares about his fans and his integrity to hire someone else to do the job when his skills are no longer there. You need a director to motivate his actors to be the BEST they can be and not just show up for the paycheck or for the glory from the first trilogy. This movie is so bad; there is not one good thing to say about it. The use of computer graphics was over excessive, the characters of this movie was lame, and who believed the ""love story"" between Padme and Anakin? I actually cringed whenever they expressed their ""love"" for one another. They so lacked the passion and chemistry required for this movie, that I soon drifted off to sleep. Anakin and Padme's love affair was so dull; it made me long for Han Solo and Princess Leia, which was far more interesting and convincing. However, the biggest let down from this movie is the Jedi. In the original movies, the Jedi(s) were portrayed as larger than life heroes that stood in the face of evil. However, these Jedi(s) came off as mundane soldiers living and fighting in a cartoon world. I could not root for them because I did not feel any attachment to them and in some cases, I cheered for the villains because they were more interesting. I blame the writer of this movie, who had 30 years to polish and work on his screenplay. Nevertheless, he isolated himself and wrote a screenplay that no one over nine will find creative and strong. Lucas should have hired someone ELSE to do this movie because his legacy is hanging in the wind.",1151884800,6,1915,4.505747126436781

The miniatures in Original Trilogy looked more real. The acting in the prequels were horrible. *sigh* I don't know, the only thing I did liked in the Prequels were the Jedi/Sith sword fights scenes. That's about it.. I love the Original Trilogy and I consider them to be Masterpieces.

George, I know the Original Trilogy was not your true vision and of course you own the rights and they're your movies but once you change something that is not cool, not cool at all!! Those are the films we grew up with, which are the Originals Films. Don't do no more changes, PLEASE! They are fine the way they are. NO MORE CGI!!!

Learn from Ridley Scott, who is releasing like 4 different versions of 'Blade Runner'. Now that's how you do business! That's how you give the public to choose from. The public needs...WANTS the old classics back! PLEASE, release the Original Star Wars in Anamorphic Widescreen with 5.1 Surround Sound!! I want to make you rich! Don't you want that?!

1310830,5,B00003CXKT,"It is doubtful that any movie in the history of American Cinema faced as imposing a wall of negativity at its release as the one that loomed before Episode II. To say that a large percentage of viewers had a bad taste in their mouth because of Episode I is an extreme understatement. I defended 'Phantom' as ""not as bad as"" people were saying. Sure I wanted all 'gungans' to die horrible deaths, especially Jar-Jar, but we had all the story elements plus some ingenious characters. At the end of its run I had decided that despite errors in canon and the abominable comic relief, I liked the film and 2002 was way too far away. As we got closer to the release date, I started to worry that all the comments about the whole franchise being trashed may have some merit. What if this one was an awkward disaster, flailing even further into the swamp of failure than the first? I intentionally didn't look up any synopsis or look for any spoilers; I wanted my reaction to be raw and immediate, based on what I was taking in. So it was that I found myself in line opening night; midnight showing, of course. I didn't really have any hope in mind one way or the other aside from ""please don't let it suck"". As I was standing there, I overheard a snippet of conversation from some youths who obviously had done some advance research, and one of them said ""Oh yeah that's right! We get to see Yoda fight in this one!"". For a few seconds, I didn't hear anything after that. Hold the phone. We get to see Yoda........fight?? OK, all thoughts of gloom and disaster are jettisoned. Is that a flicker of Optimism? Maybe so. We're seated. Down go the lights. Drum roll. ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."" Fanfare. We're off. It's all urgency, action, and an overarching sense of danger and chaos. Whoa. I've seen this 'look and feel' somewhere before. Maybe it's too early to tell, but George may be back on his game. We've got crazy things happening left and right. Alliances are being forged and broken; acts of war and treason are being committed. Holy crap, there are more Jedi on the screen than I've ever seen before! And then one of the most memorable film sequences I've seen in my whole life. It's a desperate fight, and the good guys have exhausted almost all their energy. Death seems certain, and destruction is inevitable. Why are we looking at a doorway and floor? Why- hey a shadow...why is it familiar---? Holy crap. The theater erupts. I'm gripping both arms of my chair so hard it hurts, staring bug-eyed at the screen. I've got tears in my eyes. Judge him by his size does Dooku?? This is going to ROCK!!! There is a sustained explosion of whirling, twisting light onscreen. I hope the theater manager will be understanding and send me a bill, payable in installments, for whatever I might do to this chair. Whoa the pillar!-oh....my....word. It's wrapping up; we see huge ships, and battalions of white-clad soldiers stretching to the horizon. Where have we seen those before? The March swells. It's over. I'm sitting deflated in my chair as the masses file out, talking excitedly. I would like something to drink and a listing of showtimes immediately please. Well done, George. Well done.",1142812800,10,3208,4.571180555555555
1310831,3,B00003CXKT,"Episode II is a good movie, and actually exceeded my expectations, which was a surprise. It is better than Episode I, and it is somewhat of a worthy successor to the long line of legendary classic Star Wars movies.

I think most Star Wars fans will enjoy this movie, because it has some of the elements that make a movie both memorable and enjoyable, with the exception of comic relief, which was virtually non-existent, and that was disappointing. Thank God that Lucas decided to tone down Jar-Jar Binks, that alone definitely contributed a great deal to the movie's overall enjoyment value.

The high point of the film was when Yoda demonstrated his superb Jedi skills against Count Dooku, I swear that is one of the coolest fight in film history.  Yoda almost carries this film, no doubt about it, despite his minor on-screen time.

I'm more of an old-school fan of the Star Wars puppets as opposed to all these new and fancy digital animations, but I really enjoyed Yoda's fight scenes, all of his fight choreography in Episode II was highly entertaining.  Lucas said in an interview that he made a perfect clone of Yoda from the original puppet, so the looks are identical, which made him seem very real, and that made it all the more believable. There is no way they could have made the Yoda puppet do all those Jedi tricks that he did in Episode II, without losing any credibility in terms of realism, so it made perfect sense to go with the digital version of Yoda, which enabled Industrial Light & Magic to do as they pleased and go hog wild when brain storming and designing one of the coolest fight scene of all time.

CGI gave them an open playing field instead of being tied down with the limitations of a small and stiff puppet. I am in no way a fan of using digital effects for nearly every single aspect of a movie (which seems to be the fashion in the last several years), like Episode I for example, but I can appreciate when it is done well, and actually contributes something worthwhile and respectable. As long as the digital effects do not overshadow the intent or vision of the movie, I see the employment of such tools as perfectly feasable and appropriate.

However, I do think that they should have toned down the abuse of digital effects to a reasonable level, I mean there are several instances or scenes in which tangible objects would have been much more appropriate, like using alien puppets/costumes instead of digitally created ones, more specifically the creatures that are bystanders, or non-essential characters. Digital effects should only be used where traditional methods are no longer practical, that way the movie would retain a higher level of realism, and would make the overall atmosphere of the movie more enjoyable and believable.

One final note on the CGI use, just because the technology exists, that does not mean that it should be used wherever possible, it should be used within reason; a balance exists between digitalism and realism, which I do not think most film makers have quite found, although there are exceptions, such as The Matrix.

The story is fairly well developed, and is nicely paced throughout, as opposed to Episode I where the plot simply jumped from scene to scene without any continuity or coherence.

This movie is not without flaws though, far from it.  Much of the dialogue is still very wooden, much like in the first one, which makes it hard to understand why Lucas didn't hire a well-renowned screen writer to do his writing for him. Another major disappointment is the chemistry between Anakin and Senator Amidala, there was none. I'd have to agree with what many other reviewers have mentioned about the misuse of CGI, Lucas is still too reliant on digital effects to carry the film and in the process he forgot that the plot needs more emphasis, even though it was better this time around when compared to Episode I.

The acting in general was average, Christopher Lee and Ewan McGregor added a little more soul despite their limited material to work with, but Hayden Christensen's performance was terrible.  Hayden was simply the wrong actor for the part, and it would have been better suited for someone who is more intimidating, both physically and psychologically.  Anakin never displayed that powerful presence that the part called for.  I never once thought that this was the future Darth Vader that I was seeing in the making, which was one of the biggest reasons for making these prequels.  Even Natalie Portman who has been great in other films seemed like she was bored and uninspired, and the fault does not lie with her in this respect but rather with the director and screen writer who happens to be George Lucas.  He obviously is not ""an actor's director"", in other words he does not know how to elicit genuine emotion and chemistry from the actors.  The romance between Anakin and Amidala seemed force rather than natural, which hurt the movie quite a bit since that was meant to be a focal point of the story.

The setting was amazing, despite the fact that most of it wasn't real, so in that regard CGI was used effectively. Overall, the film worked for the most part despite the aforementioned problems.  Like its predecessor this sequel cannot hold a candle to the original trilogy, but it was a much needed improvement over the disappointing 'Phantom Menace'.",1142640000,,5361,4.750269106566201

1310951,3,B00003CXKT,"I enjoyed the storyline and development of characters but Christensen's acting could use polishing.

1310954,3,B00003CXKT,"Episode II continues the Star Wars saga ten years later.  Anakin has grown to a teenager and has fallen for Padme.  Padme's tenure as Queen has ended and she is now a senator.  Her life has been threatened and Obi Wan and Anakin have been assigned to protect her.  They stop an assassination attempt and find out that there is a bounty hunter.  Anakin is assigned to take Padme back to Naboo until things cool down.  Obi Wan is assigned to follow up on the bounty hunter.

Anakin and Padme make it back to Naboo.  This gives them time to spend with each other and they form an attachment to each other.  Anakin falls deeply in love with Padmen but she knows that their love cannot be and resists.  They go back to Tatooine to see Anakin's mother and find out that she has been captured by the Tusken and she dies.  They do rescue C3PO.

Obi Wan follows his leads and finds the hidden planet of Kamino.  On the planet they are building a clone army for the Jedis.  But to Obi Wan's knowledge, no such army has been authorized.  Obi Wan views the plant and sees clone army being made.  The end product is the storm troppers.  But what Obi Wan wants is the original Jango Fett.  In his chase he discovers Dooku's plot.

Back at the senate, with the information provided by Obi Wan, they give unlimited powers to the Chancellor. (Oops!)

Just like the first, the problem with the film is that special effects are main emphasis.  The scenes that are 100% CGI are great but the scenes that are mixed live action and CGI have the same problem that all movies like this have, the CGI have no weight, they seem to float there with no natural reaction to the actors around them. (This is hard to describe with words!)

Just like the first, Ewan McGregor really shows what he's got.  He gives a great performance.  Unfortunately, Hayden Christensen is absolutely terrible as Anakin.  He comes off as a petulant little kid that needs to be spanked and his way of showing emotion is to whine.

My recommendation is the same as Episode I.  If you are a Star Wars fanatic, this is a must.  If you are a Star Wars fan, then the movie is good but don't waste your time on Disc 2.  If you would prefer movies by Kubrick, Kurosawa or Truffaut, then skip this entirely.

1310958,4,B00003CXKT,"I still can't believe that people are still thinking that episodes 1 - 3 came AFTER 4 - 6.  One reason that many people have lightsabers is because before the fall of the republic, there was a JEDI council and MANY Jedi's spread out the galaxy.  After Sidious took over, most of the Jedi were killed. Anyway I don't feel like explaining this simple concept anymore so I will go ahead an review this movie.

This movie occurs about 10 years after The Phantom Menance.  Anakin pretty much grown up is still training under his master Obi-Wan.  They are sent to try to settle a dispute with the trade Federation, when the negotiations failed the Trade Federation under the control of Darth Sidious attempt to force Queen Amidala to sign a treaty that would force them into war.  Our two Jedi heroes caught in the middle and after an attempt to assasinate the queen fails, Anakin is eventually assigned to protect the Queen from further attempts, in the process the two fall in love with each other.  As the movie progresses Obi-Wan discovers that a Clone Army for the Republic that was created to fight the Droid Army has already been created, Obi Won is a little suspisicious about the army as they are cloned from Jenga Fett who he strongly suspects is behind the assasination plot on the Queen.  But in the end he is no doubt pleased that the Republic now has an army, however Master Yoda suspects that there is more to it than what is on the surface.

I guess my only compliant about this movie is that there is really no connection with this and the Phantom Menance, its hard to picture that little boy all grown up now.  I would have liked to see some scences of Obi-Wan training him will he was young.  But I suppose that would take up too much of the movie and Lucas only had 3 movies to tell the story of the fall of the Republic and emergence of Darth Vadar.

The acting was pretty good, nothing that will win any awards, but it gets the job done and more importantly the story told.

There are some pretty good action scenes in this movie, I especially like the Jedi/Droid battle and the final showdown with Count Dooku.  I woun't give away any more of the movie, but it was pretty enjoyable and left me waiting for Revenge of the Sith to come out.",1135814400,2,2255,4.402409638554217

The main issue I have with AotC is that the love story which should have been the centerpiece is given short shrift. George Lucas cut the scenes focusing on Natalie Portman's Padme Amidala character that showed why she fell in love with the more impulsive Anakin and as a result left us with plenty of questions as to why she fell in love with him. In short her character arc was far less rich than it should have been. Luckily through the magic of DVD we see now why she fell in love with him and it escalates AotC and with it RotS beyond very good and into the realm of excellence. Still I only give AotC 3 stars because while excellent it is still one of the weaker films in the series along with Return of the Jedi.",1135209600,,1059,4.247524752475248
1311060,3,B00003CXKT,"Okay, first of all, I don't hate any of the Star Wars movies. However, Episode 2 has to be the worst. Yes, it has the awesome Yoda/ Dooku fight, and Jango Fett's decapitation, but what George Lucas doesn't seem to get is that we LIKED it when the special effects were average and the acting good. Now, it's like he's saying, ""Yeah, bad acting, but it's SO PRETTY! LASERS!""

 Anyway, acting aside, the effects are awesome, and everyone beside Hayden Christensen does a fairly good job with the lines written. Ewan McGregor is a clever Obi-Wan Kenobi, and now he has a beard, so he's wise. Samuel L. Jackson kicks bootay as Mace Windu, and Frank Oz has more emotion as the voice of Yoda than most of the cast.

 Maybe it's not all Hayden's fault. The lines written are already bad, so it would take a really great actor to deliver bad lines well. Overall, a good movie for fans. Luckily, Episode 3 was much better, living proof that Star Wars can somehow still be great with bad acting.",1134518400,2,984,4.45
1311061,1,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars Episode II March of the Action Figures is a total waste of time. Basically it's a two and a half hour exercise in computer animation where George Lucas crams as many characters as he can onscreen in the hopes of making the world's longest commercial for Hasbro toys. There's no plot, no story and no reason why you should waste your time watching it. This entire movie is nothing but one big filler sequence.

What's Episode II about? I'm still trying to figure that out after TWO viewings. Basically I've come to the conclusion that there is no plot to this movie. As the movie transitions from one pointless computer generated battle scene to another, Anakin and Obi wan have car chases, space battles while Papaltine is revealed a senator and Jar Jar votes the wrong way (howsa a dummy like he win hisself an a election?) Mace Windu (absolute waste of Sam Jackson's talents) decapitates Boba Fett's Dad, Fett's dad becomes the model for clone troopers (Action Figures), Anakin and Amidala fall in love and he gets his hand cut off by Count Chocula-I mean Dooku. Yoda bounces around the screen like Q*bert for a lightsaber battle with Chocula. Somebody winds up the Action figures to attack the Trade federation droids and Chocula gets away to get decapitated another movie (cough Episode III SPOILER cough). Anakin And Amidala get married and Anakin shows off his new shiny Jarvik brand artificial hand. Roll credits and move on to the next pointless installment. Just be sure to buy those Star Wars action figures featured in the movie after you leave the theatre.

I can't fault the actors; Lucas gives them nothing to work with. Hayden Christensen is terrible as Anakin Skywalker. I've seen some bad performances, and Christensen's Skywalker is right up there with Jim Kelly's horrible turn in Black Samurai. Natalie Portman probably brought a cardboard cutout of herself to the set and tape a cell phone to it. Her acting is that bad. Ewan McGregor shrugs his shoulders and says ""I give up"" in every scene. Sam Jackson tries his best with what little he's given.

Epsiode II March of the Action Figures is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've been a Star Wars fan since 1978 and these prequel movies are a disgrace to the name Star Wars. Lucas didn't even try to make a good movie. I've seen more effort onscreen in the $100,000 Dolemite than in the $150 million dollar March of the Action Figures.

Unless you need a movie to scourge at your MST3K party, forget AOTC. As a matter of fact just write off the Sci-Fi Fantasy film genre for a while. In between Lucas' disastrous prequels, The crash of the Matrix, Star Trek's powerful franchise falling into a black hole, Sam Raimi turning Peter Parker into Spider-Girl, the idiotic Marvel hero film adaptations, and pointless three-hour Harry Potter movies that put you to sleep, these are some Dark days for Sci-Fi and fantasy fans like myself. If you need a movie to watch during this dry spell I suggest you pick up the original trilogy, Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, or Batman Begins. If you're really desperate for a sci-fi movie fix just wait a couple of months for Joss Whedon's Serenity to come out on DVD.",1134345600,4,3200,4.698752228163993

I would recommend this movie to kids or any age range as it contains nothing objectionable and I think it's a movie a family can watch together unless someone is very turned off by science fiction, like my mom. Also, let me please ask you to vote for my review PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE because I really really want to be a top 1000 reviewer on Amazon, and think how sad my life must be if I beg this much and write all these reviews. Clearly, I need this and am desperate for identity. Yes, it's true that you probably ""know"" that being a top 1000 reviewer won't heal the hole inside of me, but until I am, I will always suspect it will and so the faster I can ""hit bottom"" by getting past the illusion of the ""grandness"" of being a top 1000 reviewer, the faster I can find real healing! Thanks for your support!!!!!! (feel free to vote for all my reviews!!!)....

1311063,2,B00003CXKT,"Just a few quick questions:

1) Yeah, I know this is about the advent of the vicious, legendary 'Clone Wars'. Well, at least it's sort of about the Clone Wars, since everything pretty much happens offscreen or is told to us after the fact.

But with that in mind, whose bright idea was it to clone a vicious, relatively stupid bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison, doing what he has to do) as the prototype for the new super-secret clone army of the Republic?

2)Back in the Day, when Lucas had a 200 dollar budget for costumes, the stormtroopers had heft. They had presence. They had bulk. Remember the first big shootout on Princess Leia's doomed blockade runner that set up the first Star Wars? Remember the tension crawling over the strained faces of the Rebel fleet troopers?

Alright: the catering budget alone for ""Attack""'s digital programmers probably dwarfs the entire special effects budget for the original Star Wars. And the digital fantasyscapes Lucas spins out for us are spectacular, in a slavishly technical way.

But is there one single scene in ""Attack"" that even approximates the tension in that first hallway shootout a billion years ago in a galaxy far, far away?

Anyway, no question about it that ""Attack"" is a better movie than ""Phantom Menace"", but that's about like saying Ted Bundy was a better guy than Jeffrey Dahmer.

The dull Trade Federation war is gone, replaced by a dull hunt for a mysterious offshoring project. The dull Jake Lloyd is replaced by the dull Hayden Christensen as a pouty youngish Darth-in-training, who is equally leaden and---worse---has to carry off a cringeworthy scene in which he bumbles about on a large porcine aardvark. Darth, on his honeymoon, on a space-aardvark: who'da thunk it?

I keep hearing apologists defend ""Attack"" on the lustrous, visual feast Lucas has presented. And it's true: there are some astounding set pieces here.

But the digital desert of the unreal and the blue-screen canyons against which the flesh-and-blood must contend takes its toll; these staggering, ccomputer-generated vistas feed off the hapless humans like a vampire grabbing chow after a 200-year nap. The result: the leaden, listless acting, where actors sound like they're reading lines off a cue-card.

With that in mind, if you're depressed---and better still, considerably tipsy---I highly recommend ""Attack of the Clones"", just for the laugh relief alone. And mind you, this isn't the forced, aggressively brain-damaged humor of Phantom Menace, but instead laugh-out-loud, snort milk through your nose stupidity. C-3PO losing his head and having it swapped out with that of a battle droid, say, or the Dooku-Yoda duel, in which everybody's fave Little Green Buddy literally bounces off the walls like like a hopped-up avenging Angel of ophidian death.

Lucas, it seems, works best when he's just Cloning around.

The acting and screenplay are horrendous. All, and I mean all, of the actors read their lines one at a time. There is no fluidness connecting the lines together, giving the notion that there are feelings and emotions involved. Instead, the lines are stilted as the characters try to interact with each other. The love scenes and interactions of Padme and Anakin are the worst I have seen in I don't know how many movies. Really, can either of them act at all?

The graphics, as well, are so bad it made the movie look cartoonish. How could this be with so much money expended on it? This, I thought, would at least be one redeeming quality. But no, it is far from it as everything looks so unbelievably fake and unreal that it is hard to even suspend your imagination enough to take in the movie.

And what is with all the falling scenes? I don't know how many falling scenes were incorporated that made this film completely unbelievable. Anakin jumps from a plane and free falls, able to land on another plane unharmed and none the worse. Or how about jumping off of a cliff and nothing happening. Or Jackson's character jumping off of the balcony down to the coliseum floor? All completely unbelievable, but was none the less incorporated into the film in order to continue the movie. What about, oh so coincidentally, C3PO having the robot head conveniently blown off his body?

There are only two redeeming things that can be taken from this movie. One, the fight scene with Yoda against Dooku. This was fun and necessary, Lucas had to capitalize on Yoda's persona to breathe life into the film. And second, Padme's tight outfits and exposed midriff. Other than that, this movie is a bore and not worth your time or money. My recommendation, stay as far away as you can. Lucas is ruining his Star Wars legacy.",1132963200,6,2033,4.607734806629834

First, it takes around 80 seconds to actually get in to the move. Redundant FBI and Interpol warnings, movie ratings, intro menu movies, segue menu movies, THX ads and more make this a classic example of what is wrong with DVDs. No wonder people rip the content out--who needs all that junk? Now, how long will it take the makers of DVDs to realize that FBI warnings scare no one and that all they need is a menu item called ""Copyright Warning"" and that will legally suffice? Either that, or put all this trash at the end where they belong! Here is the way it should work, put DVD in player, movie plays. Want the menu? Press the menu button. Simple! And let's face it, taking all those sticky strips off the newly bought DVD case is a pain in the neck!

Now, the glaring errors. If you have the DVD widescreen version handy, go to minute 12 of the movie and watch. At second 12 and second 40 the frame jerks around. How did they let this go by!? I made the same observation with the Raiders of the Lost Ark DVD. With all the time and money they put into this movie title, how did they let this go by? Who is the lead in the LucasFilm quality control board. Didn't anyone even WATCH the DVD before it went to manufacturing!?

  10 years have passed since the last movie, and now that little friendly, sweet, emotional boy, from the first movie is now a selfish, inpatient, eccentric Jedi. You heard me, but how did he get this way? Well the story explains it as his being to attached to his mother, so when he dreams her suffering, he decides that he will disobey his master's orders to stay, and of course leave to save her. The result is not pleasant, leaning an already leaning Anakin closer to the Dark Side.

 Meanwhile the scheming chancellor's plans fall into place starting a galactic war with clones. Nevertheless, like Empire the movie ends with the characters pondering over what's to come.

 The story moves better then one, but still things are discovered that are never explained, and not small stuff either, big stuff. Like who ordered these clones? You can think and guess, but that is as far as you can get. As for the Forbidden Love, George tries a teenage love story, which leaves you wondering, what does she see in him?

 Hayden Christenson does a just an ok job acting, but for the rest of the actors they did well with what they had, which was not much. Silly conversations and weak dialog kill certain scenes.

 Again, the special effects keep you from falling asleep. Also as an addition to the movie, Yoda is digitized and is now able to fight in a great fight sequence unfortunately it ends bad. In addition, this movie has the best soundtrack of all the Star Wars.

1311161,1,B00003CXKT,"""Attack of the Clones"" smacks of George Lucas' hubris. The Star Wars trilogy of twenty years ago stands as good, clean, and well-crafted fun, but the second batch really took the gloss off a major talent. This installment, in particular, is just plain boring and muddled, and it even has the effrontery to steal visual cues from ""Blade Runner"" to spice up a vapid chase scene.

Special effects, Lucas' own specialty, are overdone in this movie. That's no more than the third-rate sci-fi pablum being shovelled out on cable TV. What is unforgivable is the acting; some very good names seem to be stuck in a torpor that substitutes for subtlety. By the end of this complete failure of a film, one isn't really interested in what Pardonme I'ma Dummy or Mannequin Skywalker are up to.

Lucas made a movie long ago and far away called ""THX 1138,"" a small but effective piece about a robot-like human being who ultimately found some of his humanity. Sadly, the same cannot be said for the characters and plot of ""Attack of the Clones.""",1131062400,5,1029,4.679558011049724

1311290,3,B00003CXKT,"Not so long ago, in a galaxy very near, there lived a young man who easily met the criteria for what many would call a bona fide, unabashed Star Wars geek. Large posters covered his walls, volumes of technical guides packed his bookcases, and untold thousands of dollars were invested in armadas of toys, games and collectibles that buckled the shelves of his cabinets. But that was before the dark time, before the prequels...

Yes, it was I who could never look at Star Wars the same way again after a film called ""Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" forever contaminated my vision of a wonderful fantasy world. I will not deny that I am pre-partial to the original trilogy, however, that does not mean I cannot be objective. Even when I momentarily force myself to forget that what is now known as the ""original trilogy"" ever existed, it does nothing to make me see the prequels in a different light; for my penchant for Episodes IV through VI has little to do with sentimentality. There are those who say that one must judge the prequels on their own merits, rather than measure them against the imposing shadow of the legendary initial three. Though viable arguments have been made that the prequels have few merits, the fact remains that this is allegedly the continuation of ONE story, thus it should seamlessly meld with its antecedent, not only in flavor in texture, but in quality and substance. Unfortunately, in any one of these facets, the prequels are jaggedly connected to the original by nothing more than a thin layer of cheap glue. This second installment of the prequels only further degrades any modicum of adhesive that remained when the credits rolled at the end of ""The Phantom Menace"".

Now that I have finished my rant/preface, I will take a brief respite to delineate the storyline and describe the film's few virtues.

""Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" picks up 10 years after the events of ""The Phantom Menace"" and opens with the attempted assassination of the now Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), are assigned to protect the Senator and investigate who is behind the wet work. Obviously, this sets the stage for the now adult Anakin - who looks, acts and sounds like the clichd hot-head protagonist from any piece of random sappy anime - to slide, not so gracefully, into the obligatory romance with the girl he befriended as a little boy (""Just being around her again is intoxicating""). However, before Anakin can woo the future mother of Luke and Leia with Casanova-caliber lines such as ""Your skin is smooth, not rough like sand"", he must first assist Obi-Wan to chase down Padme's would-be assassin in a protracted non-interactive video game sequence through the ""sky streets"" of Coruscant. Soon after, Obi and Ani are forced to split up - Obi plays galactic detective to get to the bottom of the assassination plot, and Ani takes the Senator to Naboo for a roll in the hay under the guise of ""protector"". A little further into the film, we learn that bounty hunter Jango Fett (who, as I'll explain later, is like a diamond in a coal mine) has not only been hired to ice Padme, but has been used as the template for a secret clone army. After Anakin (growing ever closer to the ""Dark Side"") and Padme take a quick trip down memory lane on Tatooine, the rest of the pace-less film is comprised mostly of alternately satisfying/excessive action sequences and vague and incoherent - when not predictable - plot progression.

If George Lucas betrayed his sacred credo of ""story first, special effect second"" in ""The Phantom Menace"", he has sold out to the Dark Side, wholesale, this time around. In no previous film have I witnessed such a tacky and excessive use of digital technology. No less than 90% of the exterior settings - and much of the interior settings - are comprised of CGI-looking CGI, and that's not even counting all of the cartoonish computer-animated creatures and vehicles. At least in TPM, the visual effects were used sparingly enough to maintain some vestige of believability.  But AOTC reminds me more of a sequel to ""What Dreams May Come"". However, the nadir of this veritable cyber rape has to be Yoda, who, for some bassackward reason, is a completely computer-animated character this time around and looks and acts nothing like the venerable Jedi Master from Episodes V and VI. Then again, as I pointed at earlier, little in the prequels looks or feels like it did in the OT.

And that brings me to the acting. As in the first prequel, the performances are, for the most part, wooden and give little incentive to care for the characters. Whereas Ewan McGregor's crackerjack performance is a pleasant exception (though I still can't make the Alec Guiness connection), Natalie Portman's sleepwalk through the film is the apotheosis of the rule. Not a moment of her on-camera time goes by that she does not appear that she would rather be almost anywhere else doing almost anything else. This may not be far from the truth, as she herself has admitted that Star Wars is ""not her thing."" Little wonder, then, why her lines are delivered with roughly the same sincerity as a fast-food chain's perfunctory ""Have a nice day."" I will not say that she is not a talented young actress, but I think it is apparent that Star Wars is most definitely ""not her thing.""

Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention John Williams' score, which, although not one of his best, is still one of the few palliative aspects of the film. Unfortunately, some of the score's best cues have been completely omitted from the film and tastelessly replaced by an incongruous cue cut and pasted from the Episode I score.

In spite of the film's many flaws, there is at least one element that is perfect. Though it is an irony of ironies, the fact remains that my favorite character in the entire Star Wars saga comes from perhaps its weakest installment. That character is none other than Jango Fett. Not only does he wear armor that I can only describe as ""ultra cool"", he is masterfully portrayed by New Zealander Temuera Morrison in a performance that I honestly believe is Academy Award worthy. In his all too brief on-camera time (probably less than 10 minutes total), Morrison's Jango Fett exhibits more intensity and character complexity than the sum of every other character in the film combined. The relationship between he and his cloned son (future bounty hunter Boba Fett) is completely believable and one of the few devices that actually works in the film. Though laconic with little dialogue to begin with, Jango has one of the best lines in the entire SW saga, let alone the prequels, with his ""Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi."" I only wish I could still share that sentiment.",1130371200,3,6829,4.766694843617921
1311291,3,B00003CXKT,"I didn't feel too compelled to write a Star Wars review amidst the sea of others, and for the fact that there's a seemingly infinite number of SW geeks who argue endlessly about really trivial drivel and other opinionated nonsense. The SW nerds are EVERYWHERE, especially in a few of the places I like to frequent (e.g. the comic book store).

Unlike most of the really big kids (who should probably grow up and act their age) who grew up with the original trilogy, I'm a young'n, one of those who grew up during the Internet's big bang around '92-'95 but was too young to remember any of that (heck, back then I was only 10 years old).

Therefore, I really had no burning desire to check out the older Star Wars. I mean c'mon, I've grown up with rapidly advancing technology, and when you have insane number-crunching GPUs and 3D digital graphics technology (e.g. The Matrix), who wants to see a puppeteered Yoda and aged bluescreen effects? (For most people my age, not many of us care to hurry and see that stuff.)

So while the older heads moan and complain about the newer trilogy (and ultimately something that's completely FICTIONAL), I'm glad George Lucas decided to do a second trilogy. Had he not, I would've probably never taken the time to appreciate the earlier movies, or at least it would've taken me longer to get around to checking them out. For those who didn't grow up with Star Wars but instead with movies like Jurassic Park and the Matrix, SW I and II were great ideas.

Now onto the review for Episode II: When I first saw Episode II, I thought it was really good, which I still do. When you watch it a few times, the initial grandeur of the first watch wears off. Why? Well...this one's a little flat compared to Episode I. II is basically more of an elongated (and I do mean ELONGATED) and overfluffed love story. Actually, if you took out most of the, in my opinion, bloated footage regarding the love between Anakin and Padm, Episode II would probably be about 30-45 minutes shorter than what it is.

There are a couple other things that could've been executed better. The action is spread out far and very wide in the film, which kind of makes for sporadic moments of action and partially disjointed plot -- I was looking for the storyline to be a bit more streamlined that it was. Lastly, at times the overall script leaves a lot to be desired (e.g. when Anakin expresses his feelings for Padm saying, ""Believe me, I wish that I could wish away my feelings..."" ????) and/or can be downright corny (e.g. Count Dooku to Obi-Wan, ""...Now, back down."" with Obi-Wan retorting, ""I don't think so."").

Nevertheless, we get to see tons of really cool effects (like Yoda kicking Dooku's butt!), awesome new worlds (e.g. Kamino), the origin of the clone army, and the rise of Anakin Skywalker -- really cool stuff. (I also really like the Archduke Poggle the Lesser, the weird clicking alien guy from Geonosis!)

Although it slightly pales in comparison to Episode I, SW Episode II is a good film, especially if you're trying to keep up with the current storyline. And to all the bellyaching SW goons, geez, stop complaining, whining, moaning, and babbling on and on about something that's ONLY a friggin movie! (::ahem:: It's not real guys. Boy, I bet Lucas laughs at some of the weirdos he's created out there.) Peace.",1130112000,2,3339,4.611111111111111
1311292,3,B00003CXKT,"Episode II gets a bad rap for being the sequel to Episode I more than anything else. And while it does have it's own faults, many watch it with a pre-judged disposition that it will be bad. That isn't the case.

The acting by Christensen and Portman isn't good by any means. But if you pay attention to the dialoge, and add in that Lucas really isn't that good of a director, you have to wonder how much of it is the actors fault. The performances by McGregor, Jackson and McDiarmid are refreshing compared to the two main characters, and have no awkward love scenes to get in their way.

The action scenes in the movie are good, with quite a few fights. The arena scene is very entertaining, as is the chase through Coruscant as the planet is one that piques interest all by itself. Most people want to say Episode II is a love story, but that is far from the most engulfing plot of the movie.

Probably the best aspect of this movie is that you get to see what the Jedi truly are capable of. Their powers are explored much more than in any other movie, and this is really the only time in the Star Wars universe you get to see Jedi fight en masse. After watching it, you get a much better sense of awe about the Jedi, and can see why they were such feared opponents.

You also learn more about the Old Republic, and the beginning of the events that led to the Empire's rise. It creates a good background and answers some of the questions left by the original trilogy.

My best suggestion is to go into this movie with an open mind. The love scenes are terribly done, as the viewer even feels awkward watching them. But saide from those, it is a good movie and worthy of the Star Wars universe.",1130025600,,1695,4.251552795031056

He then asked ""Why does the light from the light sabre stop and come to a point at the end?  Light can't bend like that and just stop, it should go on traveling at the speed of light from there to the end of the universe, cutting through everything in its path.""  Perhaps he was right, but I slapped him yet again.  This time for questioning the authority of the lightsabre.

The writing is miserable, ranging from Anakin's ""romance novel"" love scenes to a sequence consisting almost entirely of puns with our old friend C3P0. Lucas even managed to make Yoda sound corny. The acting is just as awful. Hayden Christiansen, the actor who plays Anakin Skywalker, is probably the worst thing that has ever happened to Star Wars, with the possible exception of Jar Jar Binks.

The only thing this movie has going for it are special effects. But, even they are not particularly impressive, compared with movies like The Matrix or Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.

Rent it if you have to see it, because, if you are a fan of the original trilogy, I guarantee you will NOT want to endure this travesty a second time.",1128384000,5,949,4.739393939393939

And I still was there on the first day for the first showing. And this time around I was not disappointed. This was more like the Star Wars that I remembered when I was a kid...almost.

Yes this film did have its flaws. Again the dialogue was a little corny and I could have done without most of the romantic scenes between Padme and Anakin. Especially the two of them rolling around in the fields spouting bad dialogue. But no one said this was supposed to be Oscar caliber dialogue either. But in the end all of that I can tolerate since in this film we are treated to a lot less of the annoying Jar Jar Binks. He delivers a few lines throughout the film and then we are able to forget about him and concentrate on the rest of the film.

Because this is the beginning of the Clone Wars we are treated to the biggest lightsaber battles ever captured on screen. My man Mace Windu finally gets a chance to step up and shows us what he is made of. And of course we get to finally see Yoda put down his can and fight with a lightsaber and it is a spectacular battle that has to be seen to be believed. Also with this film we are introduced to the newest villain Count Dooku played by the legendary Christopher Lee. I was really surprised that he did this role but after seeing him in it I am glad he chose to do it.

Yet again Lucas gives us a great 2 DVD set packed with extras. I especially love all of the various trailers included on the bonus disc and the various documentaries give us some insight (if that is humanly possible) into what Lucas was thinking as he was making the film. Also we get some deleted scenes some of which you may wonder why they were not included in the film to begin with. The film looks great and the sound is incredible. You almost feel like you are in the middle of the battles as they are happening.

Overall Attack of the Clones is a very good addition to the Star Wars films. It does have it slow parts and some of the romantic scenes tend to run on a lot longer then they should but in the end the final half hour makes up for it. While not as good as the three films in the original trilogy it does succeed in being much better than The Phantom Menace and succeeds in being fun and entertaining. This DVD is a must have for any Star Wars fan and a great addition to any DVD library.",1128038400,,2530,4.1361788617886175
1311297,1,B00003CXKT,"This movie very nearly literally put me to sleep. If it could be bottled and prescribed, it would sell as well as Valium. The acting is bad. The dialogue is even worse. The CGI animation is faker than Milli Vanilli. One great big ole  snoozefest.",1127433600,8,246,4.466666666666667
1311416,3,B00003CXKT,"When I first watched this movie I still felt stung by the disappointment I felt when I watched Episode 1. At that point no new movies could ever live up to the original trilogy. However fast forward to now, three years after the movie was released and I see it in a different light. When you compare this and the other newer movies to the original trilogy without being biased, they don't pale as much in comparison. Part of the reason a lot of us liked Star Wars so much is because it was around when we were kids. When you watch it now, you realize how cheesy some of the dialogue is and that the plot did have its holes.

Onward to the actual review:

Special Effects: Okay, they blow everything else lately out of the water because so much effort was put into them. Too much. If they had only spent so much painstaking time on the story then this would have been an awesome movie. Fortunately in this movie Yoda looks more like he did in the original trilogy. The effects for the most part were pretty believable with few things looking blatantly digitzed.

Story: This is where the movie falters. I don't have anything against movies with political intrigue, I just don't think it was what George Lucas is good at. He's also not terribly good with the romance portion of it. While the focus of the movie isn't quite as character driven as true drama movies, the lines that the actors were forced to use could have been a lot better. In the Empire Strikes Back, Lucas brough in director Irvin Kershner specifically because he wanted the movie to be more character driven, and I think he succeeded.  I wish that he would have had that idea with this one since it was supposed to be a bit darker and deeper than Phantom Menace when it basically felt the same.

Acting: McGregor makes for a pretty solid Jedi master in the form of Obi Wan Kenobi. They did a good job of making it seem like he was much older and more mature then he was in Phantom Menace. I didn't like how he pretty much always chastized Anakin because that's very one dimensional and there's no way anybody would stick with the training if their master acted like that. Christiansen defintiely is an inexperienced actor. When he would complain about being held back by Obi Wan, he sounded quite a bit younger than the 20 years old or so that he was supposed to be. His getting angry amounted more to being like temper tantrums than a dark lord in the making. He was not terribly convincing winning over Padme with his just throwing himself at her and acting how a child adores a parent rather than a man loving a woman. Portman was more solid than Christiansen, but then again she was pretty limited by having such poor lines to use.

Overall: This movie, like episode 1, does not really stand up well on it's own. All it does is continue from where episode 1 left off and lead into episode 3. It makes you want to watch episode 3 more just to finish the story rather than being so good that you want more star wars. I think it's a push between this and episode 1 as to which is better, but at least the series finished off decently well with episode 3.",1126828800,,3122,4.364888123924269
1311417,5,B00003CXKT,"I cannot see at all why the critics would call this ""a bloated, storyless spectacle.""  It is a good storyline, as good as any of the Star Wars films, and the special effects are spectacular!

My son and I enjoyed watching this movie very much.  Great action, better than the Harry Potter movies, that is FOR SURE!",1126742400,,313,4.456140350877193
1311418,3,B00003CXKT,"Having seen the real first three movies when they first came out (Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi), I just can't like Episodes I, II, and III as much.  They are good for providing background information but they're not so suspenseful or exciting.  Episode II has enough fighting and things blowing up to make it interesting to my two sons, but Anakin is not such a likable character, Obi Wan Kenobe in this movie is not nearly as well acted as it was in the other movies, and Anakin's love interest doesn't seem convincing to me.  But unfortunately, on the whole this movie has to be seen by Star Wars fans just BECAUSE.",1126569600,,643,4.478632478632479
1311419,2,B00003CXKT,"There comes at time in making sequels when using the same form of visual effects over and over to display battles no one really wants to see fails to keep the audience excited. On a whole the film represents a failure to bring in an original plot while having no hesitation to show endless scenes of battles with the latest graphic technology. This is another of the bland-plot films flowing out of the movie business at the moment. It would be nice to see a more complicated plot and a more intelligent script in future movies of this sort, otherwise we are in a dire state indeed.",1126224000,,582,4.4485981308411215
1311420,3,B00003CXKT,"""A great movie, this is not.""  Granted, Episode II looks wonderful; the scenery, the creature effects and the space sequences are all a joy to behold.  Episode II would work wonderfully if it was a picture hanging on the wall.  It isn't though, it's a movie, and in a movie I like to see quality actors, enjoyable dialogue and an engaging plot.  Does Episode II provide these?  A little.

The main thrust of the movie is that Anakin Skywalker is now a teenager.  He is assigned by the Jedi council to protect senator Amidala (uhm, wasn't the Jedi council opposed to his being trained in the force?).  Amidala and Anakin take refuge on her home planet, leaving Jar-Jar Binks as her proxy.  Now Jar-Jar had previously shown himself to be an incompetent coward.  Amidala's stupidity in choosing him pretty much drains all the sympathy from the heroes cause.

Anyway, Amidala and Anakin fall in love, and spout cringe-worthy lines to each other.  Obi-Wan warns Anakin to be careful, emphasizing that politicians cannot be trusted.  Is Obi-Wan an anarchist, or is cynicism just part of the Jedi code?

Later, Obi-Wan Kenobi discovers a clone army being grown on a lost planet.  Rather than do any serious investigation as to why this army was being grown, the Jedi decide to appropriate the army for their own use, with the blessing of the senate led by chancellor Palpatine.  One would think that there would be some outcry from the people over this, but if so we don't hear about it.  Again, it is this kind of stupidity that makes it hard to feel for the heroes.

There is also a throw-away plot involving a young Boba-Fett and his father.  This sub-plot only exists because of Lucas' insistance to work in every character from the original series, regardless of whether or not their presence makes sense.  Plus, it gives them the opportunity to work in a child actor, which they seem to think is necessary to interest child viewers, despite that fact that there were no child actors in the original series.

The movie is further hampered by Heyden Christensen (Anakin).  This man is a lousy actor.  He is painful to watch.  Yoda, by contrast, proves once again to be an exciting and intriguing character.  When the star is outdone by a special effect your movie really has problems.

My final conclusion is this; the purely visual apsects of Epsiode II are wonderful, clearly the result of careful thought and work.  Unfortunately, little thought and work were applied to the script.  Episode II does link I and III together, but has little else to recommend it in its own right.  But then, being a Lucas film, it will probably be withdrawn and reissued with ""improvements"" in a few years.  Frankly, it needs it.",1125878400,,2711,4.718550106609808
1311421,4,B00003CXKT,"This movie is one that takes a lot of heat from fans and critics alike and on some points I am not far behind.  In short, this is a movie with so much potential and destroyed by bad acting mixed with bad dialogue.

  I'll start with the good parts.  It lays the foundation for the Original Trilogy which is brought home in Revenge of the Sith.  The storyline is awesome with the beginning of the end for the Republic and the growing love between Anakin and Padme against the backdrop of a war.  (hopeless romantic me!)  The scenes at Coruscant with the Senate were great.  I loved those.  Also amazing were the action scenes.  Especially the lightaber fights.  Visuals were awesome.  You can see Anakin's insecurities and the movie lays the groundwork for his motives in ROTS.

  Now the bad parts.  Lucas should have had someone else write the dialogue for this movie especially the Anakin and Padme scenes.  Too cheesy and corny dialogue.  Add that to bad acting from Natalie Portman and you have a love story destroyed by its own creator.  I would have liked to see their love more devolped.  Their scenes are written with the assumtion that we know what is going to happen.  Not that we don't but lets keep in mind more people will see this series in the future than now.  I would've like more significant scenes between them and an more unpredictable storyline.  It's pretty easy to guess if he's protecting her they will eventually discover feelings for each other.

So there you have it.  Not great, but not completely horrible.  OK I'm done!",1125619200,,1549,4.599264705882353
1311422,3,B00003CXKT,"Let's get straight to the heart of this movie: sand. That sounds crazy, you say? Well, let me explain: the love story between Padme and Anakin is central to the progression of the plotline in the star wars universe. Anakin finally gets to Padme with the most romantic dialogue in movie history: ""I don't like sand. It's course and rough. it gets everywhere. Not like here. It's soft and warm."" Now, THAT is a romantic line. But that is not the end! Oh, no. Later, he returns to kill village of sand men, sand women and sand children. He hates sand people for good reason! THey're rough and get everywhere! So rough, they killed his mother. Now, the sandy childhood he had, where his hatred of sand began, and sands central role in the progression of the romantic relationship along with him killing sand people tells us something. Lucas is a complete idiot. Well, this is a pretty cool movie in some respects. Aside from horrible dialogue, the actors heroically deliver the lines pretty well. Also, we get to see Yoda fight and cool stuff like that. However, the movie is pretty lame as a whole. However, the sand theme may indicate why Anakin turned on the Jedi council in the third movie: they were course and rough and got everywhere. Also, in Star Wars episode IV, they destroy Leya's homeworld.. the same place where they first met Padme and Anakin... the place where his hatred of sand began! Sand in one's food and underwear will turn anyone to the dark side. He really was good inside. It's the sand that turned him.",1125360000,2,1524,4.586080586080586

They FIGHT. Well, not really. They throw some stuff at each other using the force, and it is filmed in an incredibly boring way.

Count: ""This fight can't be decided by our knowledge of the force, but surely by our ability to shout out dull lines!""

They draw their lightsabres and Yoda bounces back and forth like a green rubber ball. The audience is overwhelmed by this mind- boggling sillieness.
Count Dooku seems to dominate the fight, and even cuts off future Darth Vader's hand, but eventually FLEES!

Annie gets a new hand and marries Padme, although half an hour ago they decided that it would destroy them. Anyone else slightly irritated by Padme's love for Anakin? They haven't seen each other for ten years (which is itself a joke, considering that the Jedi temple and the senate are only miles apart), and yet she loves him, although she's busy refusing him for a good part of Episode II?
Did she fall in love with young Ani in Episode I??

Exactly like in Episode I, our characters stumble from scene to scene, without any coherent reason. Exactly like in Episode I, there's no real threat. Count Dooku summons a group of cartoons we never knew and makes them join his evil plan, whatever it might be.
Every Star Wars hero we know is turned into a fool.
Obi- Wan, in true Jedi style, runs into every trap imaginable and needs a kid to discover a whole planet.
Yoda takes the army of clones with him, although they were designed after a bounty hunter and ordered by Count Dooku himself.
Padme falls for Annie's infantile grin, and leaves Jar Jar Binks her job as a SENATOR! It`s because of HIM Palpatine/ future emperor becomes chancellor! No kidding! The Republic falls because of Jar- Jar Binks, THE worst character ever written ...
Future Darth Vader turns out to be a whiny teenager, who uses every cheap seduction method that even the screenwriters of American Pie would have turned down. Oh, and he rolls around in the grass in front of a beauuuuutiful waterfall landscape ...
In other words, Star Wars get further ruined.

The most hilarious thing about this DVD is the bonus stuff. The feature about Hayden Christensen is so incredibly pretentious; you can't help but laugh out loud when you hear people saying ""there's so much in his eyes"" or ""he's such a talented young actor"". And when Natalie Portman says that she adores his acting, you can only think of the blind who envys the one- eyed.

But the undisputed king of this hideous crap is George Lucas and his loss of reality, when he says about Episode II that all that counts is the storytelling, how skilfully you craft the story and how the effects are merely by- products of that.
Well, George, if this is your goal, you've failed miserably, more so than any other director in the history of cinema. And you've certainly come a looooong way.
And this, in a nutshell, is the problem: George Lucas is in complete control! He does everything, even though he has not the faintest clue of how to do it.
He's written this ""film"", and consequently, the story is quasi non- existential. There's an extreme gap between fluff and complex background stories. On one hand, the  plot that drives this flick forward is incredibly superficial, on the other hand there are extremely subtle background informations that only die- hard fans can fully understand. Ironically, this background story sounds far more interesting than the actual, pretty despicable, story of Attack Of The Clones.
There are numerous oddities, illogical things and contradictions, which proof that George Lucas didn't care much about the story.
Number one: Padme is supposed to be 10 years older than Anakin.
Number two: Count Dooku is Palpatine's apprentice?? Isn't he about 20 years older than his master then? Maybe Palpatine said to himself ""a young, dynamic man failed, maybe I should get an 80- year old ...""
Number three: why exactly can Anakin and Padme not be together? Aren't the jedi council and the senate supposed to work together? Wouldn't a marriage between a jedi and a senator enhance their relationship?

The best thing about the DVD features is that it tells you exactly why the prequels fail. Whether people want to accept it or not, the technical aspects of the filmmaking were in the spotlight for far too long. Rick McCallum tells us that Episode II is a completely digital film, that the actors literally stumbled from blue- screen to blue- screen. No wonder not a single person delivers in these films, when they are lost in a nothingness of blue and green wallpaper! It DOES affect the performance and therefor the quality of a film!
Then, some guy tells us that George Lucas doesn't really thinks about the question ""Is that possible to do?"" Well, he definitely SHOULD! That's why you are a director!
Alright, in order to move the industry forward, you've got to have visions and ambitious goals, but you also have to ask yourself ""does that work?""
George Lucas only cares about bringing these things onto the big screen, no matter if it works or not!
In a movie, the settings have to be convincing, that's essential. If they don't, the audience gets distracted and the story won't work. The audience is literally thrown into a complete fantasy world, and this world just has to look real in order to make the movie work.
But this isn't the case here! It's like a video game with real actors.

No matter how hard you try, you can't spot a good thing in this flick. It can neither stand completely alone, nor does it have any real ties to either Episode I or III, except for the death of Anakin's mother.

I could give Episode II two stars for the sheer badness, which is almost entertaining, but the ridiculously high average rating forbids that.
By the way, the score also participated in this deterioration process, but for deeper thoughts on that, you can read my separate review.

1311524,3,B00003CXKT,"I wasn't very impressed with this movie, to tell you the truth. The acting was plain flat, that refers to both Anakin, Padme and some others. Even Samuel L. Jackson was quite disappointing. Obi-Wan ,though,was a little bit satisfactory.

George Lucas failed to keep the magic the previous movies had. The whole movie was flat and expected. George is better than this. The whole movie generally explains the time Padme and Anakin meet and fall in love with some bad guys thrown in and there you have, a movie.

R2 did a great job in fighting. It probably was only given some powers because if it died, it wouldn't be in the next series. Ha! I was also quite disappointed of how serious it was. The mood and the feeling when watching the movie is so tensed not like the previous ones which were really fun and relaxing. There were so few scenes on C-3PO and R2D2 didn't do much but fight. The focus was more on the lovey lovey and wars.

As I watched along, I almost fell asleep and not even finishing the movie, I switched it off. Lucky, George didn't make it too bad to make people lose interest in the previous star wars films which are still masterpieces uptil today. This movie's lousy.

1311526,3,B00003CXKT,"Many many many people were disappointed by Episode I. All that build-up and anticipation ended up with people thinking that it isn't the Star Wars that they know and love. So walking into Episode II, people walk in with worry. Would this film be better on par with Empire or just as bad. Well it's no Empire but no Phantom and that's the best compliment I can give.

There's been an assasination attempt on Padme, now a Senator and trying to figure out who's behind it. In the process, they discover that there was a Clone Army that's being built and Anakin starts his descent into the Dark Side ever so slightly. This ends in a large scale battle with the Separatists, planets who broke off from the Republic called the Clone Wars.

Although more action-y than Phantom, the pacing does seem rough, especially the ""love scenes"". No Anakin and Padme don't get it on(too bad, that Natalie is quite a dish) but it's when they explore their feelings. This contains some extremely bad dialogue but they do have to start to love each other so Padme can pump out Luke and Leia right?

Dialogue again is an issue(Episode III too). After learning that Padme is safe, Yoda expresses his relief. Instead of saying thanks, the scene just continues. So much for showing compassion. There's even a ""the day we lose faith in democracy is the day we lose it"". Eek. Doesn't help that the takes Darth Flannel used seem more like rehearsal takes.

As usual, ILM is the king when it comes to creating images. However, there is an issue as always. It's the overabundance of it. Back in the old days, the team worked hard with motion control, models and soundstages. Now certain sections of the set are real while everything is CG. There's a certain easyness to the shots. ILM worked hard to create good effects for original trilogy, now it's just ""oh, I gotta change this, alright"". Almost an easyness to everything but still the images they create are still great including the freeze-frame worthy Clone Wars battle.

The extras are great. While there's nothing as awesome as Episode I's ""The Beginning"" documentary, it's still in-depth. Although it shows ILM maybe is slightly too concerned with the calculated look of things, rather than feel. There's even a part where they discuss the placement of Obi-Wan's hands when he's grabbing a lightsaber or hugging someone. Speaking of which, George Lucas needs to stop letting his kids name characters. Jar Jar? Dekkster Jettser? Argh.

I noticed a pattern after I saw Episode III in theatres: the closer the films get numerically to Episode IV, the better they are. So II's in the middle: pacing, dialogue, overabundance of CG but good action scenes and nice music as always by John Williams but their on their way to getting better, including the great Episode III.",1124582400,,2794,4.750515463917526

1311528,4,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones, like it's predecessor, The Phantom Menace, are movies that take a lot of heat. Some of the reasons are understandable, such as too much of Jar Jar Binks on Episode I, or too many love scenes on Episode II. But beyond that, and a couple of other flaws, it is an injustice to bash these movies soo much.

Episode II is an enjoyable film. Sure, it isn't on par with say, The Empire Strikes Back, but it is still a good film. In Episode II, you can start to see the potential downfall of the Republic. Everywhere you look, there is uncertainty, or as the Jedi Council says, it is ""clouded by the dark side"". The Republic is in danger of a Civil War. The Jedi are no longer enough to keep peace in the Republic, and thus, a new force (storm troopers) is needed. There is a rumor that the one dreaded Sith Lord is controlling the senate. In case you haven't seen this film, I'll leave it up to you to see the entire thing.

I love the way that Episode II is tied to the rest of the Star Wars films. I loved the part when you hear the Darth Vader theme music after Anakin goes on a rage. Another part that I thought was pretty neat was when Anakin and Padme are having a casual conversation and Anakin hints that he would support a dictatorship if it worked (i.e. the Galactic Empire).

I remember when I walked out of the movie theater after viewing Episode II. I thought it was a mediocre film at best. After viewing it a few more times, the film began to grow on me and I began to aprrectiate Attack of the Clones. Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is a good film worthy of a purchase.

1311531,4,B00003CXKT,"When George Lucas began his new `Star Wars' prequel trilogy, chronicling the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker from Jedi Knight to Dark Lord of the Sith, many fans stood in line for days just to get tickets to the first installment, ""Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"".  Then the film was released and many fans were disillusioned by the seemingly kid friendly story that didn't seem to contain the epic elements from the original trilogy that they had grown up loving.  Of course, with over 20 years of speculation it's impossible to please every fan's expectations regarding how the story of Anakin Skywalker should be told, plus the epic has to start somewhere.  I personally enjoyed `Episode 1"", yes the acting was somewhat wooden and the story was aimed at a much younger audience than previous installments from the original trilogy, yet as I stated in the review for that film the story has to start somewhere and why not show the `Star Wars' universe's greatest villain turn from a kid that is upbeat and positive to the evil despot we all love to hate from the original trilogy.  Many fans supposedly left the `Star Wars' fold after their disappointment with `Episode 1', but it was all talk.  Because when the time arrived for `Episode 2' to be released all the fans were back, acting as if `Star Wars' was yet again the greatest thing since sliced bread.  And needless to say, ""Star Wars - Episode 2: Attack of the Clones"" did not disappoint.

""Star Wars - Episode 2: Attack of the Clones"" continues approximately 10 years after the events of `Episode 1'.  The galaxy is in even greater turmoil, as galaxy after galaxy is leaving the Galactic Republic and joining a resistance known as the Separatists, led by the remnants of the Trade Federation.  Unbeknownst to all, is the fact that 2 men, Sith Lords to be exact, are causing the galactic turmoil, Darth Sidious/Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid reprising his role of Supreme Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine from `Episodes 1, 5, & 6') and Darth Tyrannus/Count Dooku (Christopher Lee).  The Jedi are trying to hold together the fragile peace that currently exists in the galaxy, but it seems that peace is not going to last much longer, as assassination attempts are being made on the former Queen of Naboo, Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman).  To protect the young Senator, the Jedi Council assigns Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), with the task of not only protecting the senator but also uncovering the mystery regarding the growing Dark Side power that the Jedi sense is overcoming the galaxy.  This assignment will take the Jedi and Senator Amidala from the deserts of Tatooine, to the lush forests of Naboo, to the advanced cloning facilities on the ocean world Kamino, and to the savage gladiatorial arenas of Geonosis, and the eventual beginning of the Clone Wars.

Without a doubt ""Star Wars - Episode 2: Attack of the Clones"" was a much better movie than ""Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"".  `Episode 2' delivered almost exactly what fans and movie audiences wanted to see, except for critics of course, they panned this movie just as bad as they did `Episode 1'.  There was romance, comedy, drama, terrific action scenes, and breathtaking special effects, basically all the necessary components for an epic sci-fi saga, that has spanned generations.  The acting was much better, still wooden in some places, but a marked improvement, especially from Ewan McGregor.  The story took a decidedly more mature tone in `Episode 2', as Anakin and Padme are beginning to fall in love, but must keep the romance a secret so that Anakin may remain in the Jedi order, and at the same time Anakin's intense anger is becoming more apparent and is beginning to cause concern among the other members of the Jedi Order, a fact Anakin is all to aware of.  `Episode 2' features several key turning points for Anakin's character that serve to propel him towards his eventual destiny of Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, which is what is so cool about this prequel trilogy.  It's interesting to see all the big and little events that would cause such a drastic transformation in a character.

All in all, ""Star Wars - Episode 2: Attack of the Clones"" is an entertaining sci-fi thrill ride that never lets up.  Perfectly propelling the story of Anakin Skywalker towards his inevitable fall from Jedi grace to the Dark Side of the Force.  If you were disappointed by `Episode 1', by all means, do not write off the entire prequel trilogy based on that one film, as `Episode 2' will easily impress you and make you forget all about the problems you had with the first installment.  A definite must see for `Star Wars' fans and those looking for an entertaining time.

1311533,1,B00003CXKT,"This movie is a complete and utter failure, and for some reason the diehard fans of this ridiculous series can't see it. The dialogue between actors is non-existant. The CGI effects are carbon copies of the last abomination, The Phantom Menace. Its terribly written, directed, and edited. George Lucas is one of the most over-rated filmakers of our time. The originals were great for their time but still lacked character development and likeliness. I have to say that I've hated Star Wars since forever and it still continues to dissapoint. Yet for some reason the diehard fans bought it, and its because they feel they have to like it because its.....STAR WARS. Get over that fact and actually try to love the movie on it's own merrits. It's a terrible movie and so are all the others. All these new creatures and boring clones have all the appeal of a brown paper bag. Even  Darth Vader was under-developed and no doubt they will try to develop him later in the series but it is far to late to consolidate this train wreck. George Lucas is an amatuer at best, and the credit should go to his effects team, if you can find any credible part of this monstroscity.",1123372800,6,1164,4.596153846153846

But after a while, it hit me, like a ton of bricks. You just can't market films without the feeling of the force, of morality, of 'this is going in the right direction'. Then when episode iii comes out, it's uncriticizable, if that's a word. But episode iii uses the force of episode i and ii. Go figure.

It literally resembles an ugly puzzle that when you put it together is full of magical thinking and problem solving, and isn't logical at all. Put together a puzzle then watch this movie and you see how episode iii is the fruit of all your labor. I don't know if people get it, but a lot of philosophy can be unconsciously garnered if you watch this in careful rhythm. Don't be too cautious to insult the movie, but notice how you keep watching...

Use the force,... yeah, right. So you can't 'use the force' because it's not always on your side! You too can be a bad guy, and that's what people completely mentally block out of their mind. That's why they hate the episodes that don't clearly show the bad guy. They require demonstration, and I think Lucas should consider his making of these first two films from that perspective. A lot of people were bored, frustrated, even frightened. Why should you feel frightened that Star Wars I and II were going to ruin IV, V, and VI?

1311644,2,B00003CXKT,"The Star Wars Trilogy is perhaps the greatest motion picture trilogy of all time. However Episode II cannot in any way shape or form measure up to any aspect of the original trilogy. The gift George Lucas once had for dialogue is now entirely gone, and the humor that marked the original trilogy is gone as well, and has been replaced by gags that in know way fit into the Star Wars universe.

  The performance of Hayden Christensen (Anakin) is not believable, there is no way that this whining, sniveling, complaining kid could ever become the calculating, powerful, and seemingly without emotion Darth Vader. Hayden Christensen's performance is dreadful, but not quite as bad as the performance of Natalie Portman (Padme). Watching the scenes with both of them interacting make you wish you were dead. Even the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi played by Ewan McGregor is bad. His acting itself isn't bad, but he just isn't the same Obi-Wan from the original. The movie is only made worse when 900 year old, decrypted, feeble, two foot tall alien Yoda, Jumps through the air doing flips, and fighting a Sith Lord with his lightsaber, and afterword limping away with his cane. Lady's and Gentlemen, I realise that this is a fantasy, but there is a line you can't cross!

  Even the special effects are worse than the original. The film relies far too heavily on digital effects, and doesn't used the tried, true, and much better looking models and puppets. If you are a fan of Star Wars you might enjoy this movie the first time, but will hate it after that. I will understand if you buy it anyway.",1121299200,3,1589,4.67741935483871
1311645,4,B00003CXKT,"""The day we stop believing in democracy is the day we lose it,"" says Jamillia (Ayesha Dharker), the current Queen of the Naboo, to her predecessor, now Galactic Republic senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), in the (chronologically) second episode of the six-part science fantasy saga.

The background to Episode II is a galaxy-wide separatist movement, led by the Trade Federation, threatening to break up the Republic. Padme, staunchly pro-Republican, returns to Coruscant to vote on the issue of the creation of an army to counter the threat. Suspecting that hostile elements might try to kill her, she therefore travels in disguise on an escorting ship rather than her own, which ends up being destroyed on the landing pad. Jedi apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are assigned to protect her, yet Anakin's headstrong personality emerges, torn as it is between his personal feelings for Padme, whom he had not seen in ten years, and questioning the real purpose of their assignment.

After a would-be assassin is killed by a poisoned dart, Coruscant has now clearly become too dangerous for Padme, so Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) orders her to return to her home world of Naboo, with Anakin in tow. Obi-Wan, in the meantime, goes looking for an old friend, Dexter Jettster (Ronald Falk), who positively identifies the dart as coming from a non-aligned world. Despite the fact that the Coruscant library archives show no trace of it, Obi-Wan actually finds the planet, where he learns, much to his surprise, that, ten years ago, another Jedi, now dead, had allegedly requested the creation of a clone army, specifically to fight on behalf of the Republic.

The original provider of the DNA for the clones was Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), a bounty hunter, who claims he was recruited by a man named Tyranus. He is suspicious of Kenobi, who, in turn, is ordered by Jedi Council leader Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) to bring him to Coruscant for questioning. Fett has other ideas and, after a fierce duel, he escapes, but not before Obi-Wan succeeds in clamping a detection probe to his ship as it launches.

In the meantime, both Padme and Anakin struggle with the realization that they are falling into ""forbidden"" love, since Jedi are prohibited from having sexual partners, yet that is eclipsed by Anakin's recurrent nightmares concerning his mother, Shmi (Pernilla August). Padme sympathizes and travels with him to his home planet of Tatooine, where they meet up with his former owner, Watto (Andrew Secombe), who is actually genuinely delighted to see him again.

The young Jedi and Padme then go to the distant home of the Lars family, where he is informed that she had been kidnapped by Tusken raiders the previous month. He is not willing to accept that she is dead and goes looking for her, only for her to die in his arms within seconds. This drives the young man to the edge, and so his degeneration to the Dark Side begins when he kills everyone in the raiders' camp, a confession he later makes - somewhat unapologetically - to a stunned Padme after he returns with his mother's body, yet her love for him causes her not to condemn him for his actions.

However, an interrupted message from Obi-Wan results in them heading towards Geonosis, the planet where the separatist leaders under Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), a former Jedi Master, are meeting to plot the conquest of the Republic. Obi-Wan had traced Jango there, but he was captured, presumably as he was sending the message. He is incensed at Dooku's claim that the allegedly corrupt senate is under the control of a Sith Lord named Sidious, counter-claiming that the Jedi would have noticed if this were the case. ""The Dark Side has clouded their vision,"" Dooku says matter-of-factly.

The crisis is such that Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), the Gungan now representing Padme in her absence in the senate, proposes that Palpatine be given emergency executive powers. The latter agrees and so the use of the cloned army is authorized. Having arrived on Geonosis, Padme and Anakin discover the automated droid army factory, but they both end up battling the machinery and the droids themselves until they are captured. Along with Obi-Wan, the lovers are condemned to death and taken to an arena reminiscent of the circuses in ancient Rome. With an audience consisting of Dooku, Jango and Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray (Silas Carson), who had been behind the attempts to kill Padme, as well as thousands of blood-thirsty creatures, the three prisoners manage to hold off being monster fodder before Windu and a host of Jedi Masters show up to rescue them. However, they are vastly outnumbered by the droid army then sent in to oppose the Jedi.

All seems lost, but, in the best Hollywood movie tradition of the U.S. Cavalry showing up on time, Master Yoda (Frank Oz) appears with whole squadrons of clone army soldiers, and so commences a massive battle between the droid and the clone armies. Dooku flees, but is pursued by Anakin and Obi-Wan, who corner him just as he is about to escape in a spaceship. Dooku downs both Jedi but his triumph is short-lived as Yoda appears, and both use their mental powers, followed by light-sabres, to fight each other. However, Dooku nearly kills the two fallen Jedi with a large metal object and Yoda has to use his mental powers to deflect it, thus buying time for Dooku to escape ... to Coruscant, where, greeted as Lord Tyranus, he meets up with his Sith Master, Lord Sidious, announcing that the clone war has begun, something that Yoda reluctantly admits to Obi-Wan and Windu later. In the meantime, Anakin, who had lost his right arm in the battle against Dooku, and Padme secretly marry on Naboo. The story continues in Episode III....

Overall, the film partly fulfils the goal of many fans' wishes to witness huge battles between opposing sides, with plenty of spaceships, droids, clones (in their tens of thousands) and, of course, firing in the tradition of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, since this was an element deemed to be sadly lacking in Episode I, the first prequel movie. Since the action here takes place a decade after that in Episode I, it is clear that something must have made Anakin develop into such a headstrong, almost disobedient young man, yet, considering that he had never shown any such personality as the young boy in Episode I, the reasons for this development remain unclear, though it would be fair to say that teenage rebellion could be a factor, even for a Jedi apprentice!

It would be fairly easy to dismiss the story from Episode I as totally unnecessary, since fans would argue that it might have been possible to have started with Episode II instead, thus laying the way for another prequel to bridge the (relatively huge) time gap between what is now Episode III and the original (1977) movie, now Episode IV.  Director George Lucas had to make a tight balance between the sub-plot of the romance between Anakin and Padme and the main plot, considering both the undoubted audience desire to ensure that the focus on the background story was not lost, and the fact that it all had to make sense relative to the four films that chronologically come next in the series.

In a way, he does succeed and it is an entertaining film to watch with more twists and turns than a Republican spaceship could make when battling huge spaceships (hint, hint), although what really helped to make this one a hit was the appearance of screen legend Christopher Lee, whose performance as Dooku is masterful and unforgettable - with over 200 films under his belt, he certainly has an unbelievable screen presence for an 80-year old actor! However, one feels that the success of the film - as well as that of the whole ""Star Wars"" series -  has come at the cost of what could have been another film, a kind of ""Episode III 1/2"", that could have provided fandom with another opportunity to see Darth Vader and, of course, his (and Padme's) two children. Hence, many fans might be forgiven for thinking that they have been ""robbed"", at least of any story on screen, if not in other media.",1121299200,,8202,4.841654778887304
1311646,4,B00003CXKT,"""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" is the second installment in the ""prequel"" trilogy to the widely successful ""Star Wars"" trilogy that was made between 1977 and 1983.  Much like watching the first prequel movie, ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"", it is going to be almost impossible not to watch the prequel trilogy and begin to try to piece together how things will eventually evolve into the original trilogy.  While I did watch ""Episode II"" and attempt to see things stand on its own, I also couldn't help see plenty of parallels between the prequel trilogy's second installment and the main trilogy's second installment - ""Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"".

There are really two themes that occur in ""Episode II"".  The first theme continues to follow the story of Luke Skywalker's father Anakin, who was seen in ""Episode I"" as a young boy.  Anakin is now seen 10 years later as a young man and now a Jedi Apprentice.  The second theme involves the origins of the ""Clone Wars"".  The ""Clone Wars"" were mentioned in the original Star Wars trilogy - and have been a story in comics, short-stories, and even a Cartoon Series.  The two stories are intertwined.

When ""Episode II"" opens up, a Separatist  movement has begun to infiltrate the Old Republic.  This revolt is being headed by Count Dooku (played by Christopher Lee).  The Jedis are increasingly having a difficult time with their ""peackeeping objectives"".  The Republic's Senate is set to vote on the creation of an army to protect the Republic and assist the Jedis.  Queen Amidala (played by Natalie Portman), now known as Senator Padme Amidala is opposed to such an army and seeks diplomatic solutions.  Amidala's opposition to the army on this vote has made her a target of assassins.  Following an initial assassination attempt on Padme, Chancellor Palpatine requests that Obi-Wan Kenobi (played by Ewan McGregor) and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (played by Hayden Christensen) protect her.  When an assassin makes a second attempt on Padme's life, the Jedi Council decides that Obi-Wan should go and track down the assassin while Anakin gets his first ""solo"" assignment to protect Padme.  The story splits to two fronts for a while.  Obi-Wan's search for the Assassin takes him to the planet Kamino where he learns there is a Clone Army being built - at the request of the Republic.  He also learns the ""original host"" of the Clone Army is a Bounty Hunter named Jango Fett - who he believes is the assassin.  Obi-Wan chases Jango Fett to the planet of Geonosis where he learns that Count Dooku is behind the Separatist emovement and has created a droid army.  Eventually Obi-Wan is captured by Dooku.  Meanwhile while Anakin is protecting Padme, the two begin to fall in love, but falling in love is something that is forbidden for Jedi Knights.  When Anakin dreams his mother is in danger, he returns to Tatooine with Padme by his side.  One Anakin resolves things with his mother, he learns Obi-Wan is in trouble and must rescue him.  The storylines involving the Obi-Wan's capture, the Clone Army, the Droid Army and Anakin and Padme's romance will then reach a climax.

While ""Episode II"" does a good job on its own at continuing the ""Star Wars"" story started in ""Episode I"", I noticed plenty of parallels with this movie and the second part of the original trilogy - ""Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"":

- Much like the ending of ""Episode V"", the movie ends with a feeling that things are unresolved.  In fact, the final scene at the end of ""Episode II"" is similar in feel to final scene in ""Episode V"".

- Anakin is going to suffer a hand injury much like Luke suffers in ""Episode V"".

- Much of ""Episode V"" was a split storyline.  The split storyline was Luke's Initial Training on Dagobah with Yoda and the following of the dynamics between Han Solo and Leia as repairs are being made to Han's ship, The Milleninum Falcon"".  The split storyline in ""Episode II"" involves Obi-Wan's search for the assassin and Anakin's guarding of Padme.

- The beginnings of a love story.  In ""Episode V"", it's Leia and Han Solo.  In ""Episode II"" it's Anakin and Padme.

- Anakin and Luke both must ""rescue"" friends.

- Boba Fett is featured in both movies.

While ""Episode II"" isn't the movie that Anakin Skywalker succumbs to the ""Dark Side of the Force"", we get a lot of clues.  We see that Anakin has become frustrated with what he considers Obi-Wan ""holding him back"".  In ""Episode I"", we heard Yoda say ""Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.""  We see this when Anakin goes back to Tatooine to rescue his mother - as well as his jealousy of Obi-Wan surface.  We hear Anakin say how he wants to be ""the most powerful Jedi ever"" - something that is also said by Chancellor Palpatine.

One big problem I had with ""Episode I"" was that the politics of this movie are difficult to follow.  While I do think ""Episode II"" isn't quite as complicated as ""Episode I"", I still think there was room for simplification.  I found the whole story of the origins on why the Clone Army was requested to be more complicated than it had to be.  The other issue I had with ""Episode II"" is that this story seemed much more drawn out.  This is a long movie - and although it is an action-packed movie, I felt at times things were going very slowly.

The storyline of the love story between Anakin and Padme gets a lot of criticism.  I happened to like it.  It isn't as humorous as Han and Leia's romance in ""Episode V"" - but I still enjoyed it.

Overall, this movie still does justice to the Star Wars legacy.  I'd definitely recommend it.",1120953600,,5666,4.630892678034102
1311647,5,B00003CXKT,"This was the film that began the redemption of the Stat Wars Prequels Trilogy and even got me seeing ""The Phantom Menace"" is a new light.

  With even more mind-blowing special effects and visual panoramas than its predecessor, and with some tremendous action (Obi-Wan Kenobi Vs. Jango Fett = one of the best one-on-one battles in movie history) scenes, ""Attack Of The Clones"" is always going to be disliked by a lot of Science Fiction/Action fans, because it is, probably even more than a science fiction action movie, an epic Against-The-Odds Love Story.  The odds it's against though, aren't from the Sith, but the Jedis, who evidently forbid love.

Okay, I've talked about the shortcomings I found in the Jedi in this trilogy compared to the original one, and I'm going to do so again here.  What kind of galactic guardians of all that is just, good and noble (supposedly) start off with a rule of 'Thou Shalt Not Love?'  And it seems that this rule may not apply exclusively to romantic love; how often do you think all those for-and-five year-old 'young Padawans' are permitted to see their families?  Annakin's certainly never been allowed to; along the lines of what I talked about in my Episode 1 review why did the Jedi just leave all the other slaves on Tattooine?  If it was against their rules to intervene forcefully couldn't they have used mind control on Watto and the other slavers to release their captives?  (They'd probably contend that indiscriminate use of mind control is unethical, but wouldn't the issue of slavery have been a glaring exception?)  Couldn't they have paid the little creep off (judging by the grand Jedi Council chambers and all the starcraft they have available to them the Jedi don't seem to be hurting for funds)?  It must sound like I'm bashing this movie, but I'm not - it's just that in the first trilogy the lines between good and evil were so clear and in the prequels they're blurred, to say the least.  And this blurring of the lines is, unexpectedly, what's propelling the series on by the time we get to Episode 2.  Annakin and Padme end up involved in spite of the Jedi rules on such matters, in a wonderfully pure love story.  Pure for a while, at least - Padme seems to bring out the best in Annakin, who at the movie's beginning has already become quite dark and bitter, but later a tragedy brings out the full darkness inside him with an explosive and shocking rage on Tattoine; a tragedy that could have been avoided if the Jedis had lived up to the perception they have of themselves as champions of the oppressed; the rage - as it turns out - only a harbinger of the maelstrom of jaw-dropping darkness that emerges in ""Revenge Of The Sith"".

The battles are awesome, but has anybody else noticed that the Jedi seem awfully indiscrimate in their killing of the Battle Droids?  The Destroyer Droids aside (they Are formidable, able to give Jedi Knights a hard time and probably requiring a good-sized squad of Clone Troopers to make it an even fight - which in of itself raises an Extremely intriguing question about events early in Episode III) but the regular droids are not that adept; it seems that in many cases the Jedis should have been able to disable or capture them without 'Wiping them Out...All Of Them' (yes, I know those were Sidious's words to the Jedi's enemies; that's my point - the Jedi themselves can be pretty ruthless).  Did this kind of acceptable total destruction of a clearly inferior enemy (that we see during partsin all 3 prequels) that the Jedis should be able to easily take alive play into the subconciousness of Annakin before the Tattoine incident?  There's only once in Episode 2 where the regular, non-enhanced Battle Droids are a powrful match for the Jedis, and that's because of their huge numbers.  And what a battle that makes!  All the action in the Genosian arena is just breath-taking.

Awesome imaginaton on the new alien creatures; some awesome battles at the end I'm not going to talk about for the benefit of those who haven't seen Episode 2 or heard everything about it; a stunning creation of a supercity on Coruscant.  I can't stop thinking though, how different things might have turned out for the whole Galaxy if Annakin had strode the middle path - leave the Jedi without joining the Dark Side and let he, Padme, Artoo and Threepio -maybe Jar-Jar too, although he isn't in this one much - hold down the fort until the 'kids' arrive to join the fight.

So many points I don't have time to talk about - the whole Seperatist thing - do they have to be violent separatists like the ones who took Naboo, or does just talking about seceding from the Republic make them a legitimate target?  This is never fully explained.  And the Wealth of new characters in here - good, bad, and in the middle - incredible.

An outstanding chapter that made me appreciate ""Phantom Menace"" a lot more, and the outstanding ""Revenge Of the Sith"" made me appreciate this one even more; of course ""Revenge..."" is a whole different tone of movie - possibly the most horrifically tragic thing I've ever seen.  Enjoy the less vicious tone, with comedy and romance amidst all the action and ethical questions, of ""Attack Of The Clones"" while you can...",1120953600,,5236,4.668117519042437
1311748,5,B00003CXKT,"This is the best of episodes 1, 2 and 3 to me.  Episode One didn't really engage me---Jar Jar was awful and so were most of the other characters.  However, this movie really thrilled me---just like Episode 4 did in 1977.  I thought the effects were great--stellar even-the acting much improved and the over all story was excellent.  I have been a Star Wars fan since the beginning and this was to me, the best since A New Hope. I really can't say enough good things about it.  And yes, I saw ROTS and I still like this one better for 3 major reasons:

1.  The Clones

2.  We finally get to see Yoda do his thing like no other Jedi can.  I mean he was like a jet fueled jumping jack--how cool was that?!

Back in the day--The Empire Strikes back was my favorite--but honestly, the Luke cave scene is now laughable--creature effects weren't so hot in that one except for the Taun-Tauns.  And if you don't know what those were, my review won't matter.  :)

1311749,3,B00003CXKT,"When I was updating my review for the Phantom Menace, I had stated that while the series seemed to be focused on the birth/death of Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker, the big picture actually involves the rise of Darth Sidious as the Emporor of the new Empire.

This involved his manipulation of the senate, the manipulation of the trade federation (whom he manipulates again in this movie), his playing at both ends of the table etc. It is more evident in this movie, even though most of the film is taken up by the growing relationship between Anakin and Padme Amidala.

This movie takes place ten years in the future and begins on the planet of Corusant. Padme, who is now a Senator, survives an assasination attempt and is assigned a bodyguard by Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. These bodyguards are the old stalwarts Obi-Wan and Anakin. While Anakin has aged, and Obi-wan has grown a beard, Padme still looks like she is 16 years old. After a second assasination attempt, the jedi capture the assassin and gain valuble information from a short order cook (!). They split, with Anakin taking Padme back to Naboo and Obi-Wan looking into a mysterious clone army being built.

The 2nd act involves the investigation of the clone army, the romantic development between Padme and Anakin and the growing storyline development of the Separatist movement. However, of this, 60% involves the Romantic development.

The final act involves the fact that the Separatist movement is found out by Obi-Wan and the Jedi and Senate are forced to give emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor. These legitimizes the need for the clone army (based off the assasin Jango Fett) and the emergency powers of the Supreme Councillor and a battle ensues.

The big picture is easily the best part of the movie, it is the cause of the big battles and provides in part an epic scope to the movie. However, this part of the movie is too transparent and was not handled well. We already know everything that the ""all knowing"" Jedi are still trying to figure out. We already know who the Emporor will be, we already know that the Republic will fall, we already know the mystery of the Sith. There is no anticipation and George Lucas is forced to rely on eye candy to substitute for the lack of tension.

And the end battle, while exhilerating in scale, seemed to be lacking, since it looks like something more out of Final Fantasy the Movie, rather than the Star Wars series. I always like the cinematics in computer games like Diablo and Warcraft and this was like it, just bigger and in better resolutions.

However, the dialogue and the acting between Anakin and Padme is the achilles heel to this movie. The lines are out of a Harlequin romance novel and the acting between the two is stiff. There were people laughing when Anakin whines about his abilities and at the same time trying to be lovey-dovey. His advances are those that get drinks poured on one's head and it seems unlikely that it would work on a sophisticated woman like Senator Padme. Lucas should have thought of smarter dialogue to win Padme's heart, especially since it did not work on the viewing audience (women and men).

However, there were scenes that got cheers like Mace Windu's purple lightsabre and Yoda fighting skills. I personally did not like the digital shenanigans used for Yoda's fight with Count Dooku (played with suave sinister-ness by legendary Christopher Lee), because it looked fake (Yoda's a sage, not a kung-fu Jedi fighter), but that is my personal feeling.

Overall, the movie gets a bare recommendation because of the way the movie ended. There's something about having stormtroopers entering pre-empirical supercruisers that brings back memories of the first series, even if the rest of the movie is not as sentimental...Rating: B-",1120694400,,3801,4.844375963020031

There's some interesting documentary stuff here on how the movie was made.  Especially interesting to me was the documentary on how the sound effects are created.  Then there's the R2D2 spoof biography that's almost worth the price of this DVD in and of itself.

Watching all these docu-shorts on how the movie was produced made me sad.  A huge amount of work by a lot of skilled people went into this movie, but the acting (or attempts at acting) at times left me wondering whether to laugh or cringe.

But enough has already been written about the shortfalls of this movie.  I have an idea.  Since nearly all the film is special effects, perhaps in twenty years the acting can be reshot with different actors, and the move can be re-released on DVD (or data crystal or whatever) as the ""enhanced acting version"".

They could also add an extra half hour of character and plot development, and explain just what the issues were between the Republic and the trade guilds (or whoever).  Then it could be sold all over again, and perhaps to even more people.",1120435200,2,1171,4.559808612440191
1311752,3,B00003CXKT,"10 years has passed since the last episode. The galaxy is a mix of chaos, anarchy and threats. The now Senator Padme Amidala is the target of various assassination attempts, and to protect her the Jedi Council assigns Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker.
When Kenobi discovers that the attempts are part of a conspiration to break the Galaxy apart, the Jedi Knight is sent to further his findings, while his apprentices is left to take care of Padme. It's just a matter of time before these two fall in love.
Tragedies and revelations occurred, while the forces of evil overwhelm the good, the fall of the republic is imminent and the political stability crumbles.
While the title of this movie was mocked all over the world, it seems apt for the Clones are an important part of the story, establishing a connection between the first trilogy and the new one.
The plot is complex and too heavy on politics, and the personal crises of the leading characters are overwhelmed by it. The movie is full of Forbidden love, passions, ambitions, adventures, and struggles for power and revelry.
AOTC is a little more deep -psychologically speaking- than TPM, for it shows us the road Anakin will take to evil. His tendency to disobey orders, his cling to feelings, his rebellious temperament, his fear to lose the ones he loves are just some proofs of why he is destined to suffer a tragic future.
What fails on AOTC? The excess of bad dialogues, the romance of Anakin and Padme, necessary for the continuity, is wooden and extremely artificial; the acting continues to be excruciating.
AOTC is a fantasy made true for all those waiting to see the Jedis at their peak. It's slightly better than his predecessor, but still, a poor attempt of George Lucas, who clearly gave us all of his genius 25 years ago.",1120003200,,1797,4.707936507936508
1311753,4,B00003CXKT,"""Why do I have the feeling your going to be the death of me?""

""I see you becoming the most powerful of all the Jedi, Anakin. Even more powerful than Master Yoda.""

""Begun, The Clone Wars, have.""

- Obi-Wan Kenobi ominously jokes around with Anakin Skywalker, while Anakin recieves the highest praise from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, & Yoda looks to the future in ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones""

The second episode in the ""Star Wars"" saga is a great sci-fi film (hey, its ""Star Wars""!) & is an improvement over ""Phantom Menace"" (the weakest film in the set), but, still can't seem to overcome its own problems (mainly the same problems that were with ""Menace"" are here also. Its a prequel to better things).

Taking place ten years after the events in ""Episode I: The Phantom Menace"", ""Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"" has Senator Padme Amidala returning to Coruscant & the Republic Senate to vote on a clone army that can aid the troubled Jedi Knights of the galaxy. The Jedi have been vehemetly fighting to keep peace in justice throughout the galaxy, even as several worlds & species have given up on the Republic & have sided with the Seperatist Cause, led by the mysterious Count Dooku.

Upon arrival on Coruscant, Amidala, the former queen of Naboo, survives a botched assasination attempt on her life. As the Jedi look into the matter, & at the bequest of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, two Jedi Knights that Padme is familiar with, Obi-Wan Kenobi & his Jedi apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, are brought in to protect her.

But, after another attempt on Padme's life, Obi-Wan is sent to investigate on who is trying to kill her & why. His investigation leads to the backwater world of Kamino, Jango Fett (I wonder who he's related to?), a massive clone army, & a Sith Lord with a past that intersects with Obi-Wan's.

Meanwhile, Anakin is ordered, by the Jedi Council, to sneak Padme back to her home planet of Naboo, keep her safe & wait for further instructions. Its here on Padme's homeworld that Anakin falls in love with her. But, Padme knows that their love is a forbidden love & denies it, even though Anakin tells her they could keep their love a secret. Destiny & fate will change her mind.

But, for Anakin his Jedi training is frustrating. He feels as if Obi-Wan is holding him back in some way. Whats worse, is the nightmares Anakin has of his mother in severe hellish pain. The images are enough to have Anakin, with Padme, travel to his homeworld of Tatooine to find his mother. What he finds is tragedy. A tragedy that will lead to his first step towards the Dark Side of ""The Force"" & his destiny as Darth Vader...

Being the bridge between I & III, ""Attack Of The Clones"" is the most talkiest of the three prequels & for that matter, the entire ""Star Wars"" saga. Action wise, the action doesn't really pick up until Obi-Wan reaches Kamino. Thats, roughly, half way through the film! The exposition is needed though, for the payoff in ""III"" (if you've seen that film you'll understand what I'm talking about).

The acting is, again, ""limited"". Lucas never could get the full range of abilities from his actors (thats always been his downfall). The romance scenes between Anakin & Padme are supposed to be epic (this is the stuff that die-hard ""Star Wars"" have been clamoring for), but, come off half-hearted.

The action sequences to ""Clones"" is what ""Star Wars"" is all about & don't dissapoint. The problem is, there is a bit of familiarity with other episodes in the saga. The Obi-wan, Jango Fett asteroid chase is similar to the asteroid chase in ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The opening to the arena battle brings images of the Rancor, Luke battle from ""Return Of The Jedi"". Its still all plain ass good, though.

The lightsabre battle is one of the few highlights of ""Clones"", especially, the battle between Yoda, & Dooku (Yoda's former apprentice).

Jar-Jar Binks has all but a few lines of dialogue, but, what he says will have repercussions throughout the ""Star Wars"" saga's future.

For me, personally, I rank ""Clones"" to be the fourth best in the saga (""Empire"" is 1st, ""Star Wars"" 2nd, a tie with ""Jedi"" & ""Revenge Of The Sith"" for 3rd, ""Clones"" as fourth, & ""Menace"" last). The talk about the Clone Wars has been fan fodder since the release of the first film in 1977. It was interesting to see what happened, but, its not what I expected (I think a lot of fans felt this way).

""Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"" is presented in the widescreen format, with Dolby Digital EX 5.1, & has enough clones to have you take out the garbage, while driving to Wal-Mart, while at the same time picking up your son from Little League practice, while making love to your wife, while grounding your other son for doing the same stupid things you did as a kid, & they 'll tell two friends, & so on & so on, & so on,....",1119830400,4,4861,4.595842956120093
1311754,4,B00003CXKT,"Following the review i did on Phantom Menace, I won't have to explain a few points i gave out to new comers to the Star Wars saga, and for those following me, let's get to Episode II. This is the weakest of the prequel trilogy and of the whole saga, and it's still good. It wasn't great, but like Episode I, the movie wasn't well received, although it was better received than Ep. I. When I first saw it on 2002, I was so excited I nearly had to change my pants. Finally I was gonna see another Star Wars in theaters, since I had seen the first three when the special edition came out. The movie was great, but after it came out on DVD I started noticing things I didn't like at all.

I am completely neutral when it comes to Jar Jar. For some people it was great to see him not do anything on this movie, while I myself didn't really care. Unlike most, I thought he was a funny character and he had his purpose in Ep. I. He has no place in this one, other than giving emergency powers to the Chancellor, which was the dumbest thing Jar Jar had ever done. Amidala should have killed him for that :)

Visually the film, in my opinion, though awesome, it was bad in comparison with Ep. 1. The colors are just too deep and unrealistic, something that was, in my opinion, fixed somewhat in Ep. 3. Now, the story. Like in Ep I, you really have to be dumb to not understand this, with all due respect. By understand I may really mean be fine with it. But, like Ep I, the problem was that it raised too many unanswered questions and thats why many didn't understand it. Sorry if I spoil anything, which I doubt will have an effect on how you view the film. The Clone wars were a diversion to set the Jedi to war, something they should never do, and in the war take the opportunity to weaken the Council. So, there is no real definition of which side is good and which is bad, other than the Jedi and the Sith, and the Separatists must be bad since Dooku leads them, right? That's correct in a way. There is a lot of complexity, which of course gets straightened out in the last film, but I still have doubts about Dooku. Probably the books will help, but movie goers needed more I think, but the rest was clear, since we know what the Clones become. Now, about the distraction of the council, this doesn't appear in the movie, but it is the theme of the third movie. This is what I like about Lucas. He leaves many things for your imagination, since the Clone Wars, much like the wars in the first movies, are only seen in key parts of the last two movies. In the first ones, the war between the Rebels and the Empire, although there was one battle in each movie, it isn't until the beginning of Ep V and the end of Ep VI where you really understand this is a deep struggle. So, the political strife was a must, and it was very engaging for me, considering what I know happened afterwards in Ep 3 and what I knew was supposed to happen in Ep 3 back when I first saw it in 2002.

Now, the things I didn't like and the ones people paid too much attention to when they shouldn't have. First, there is a matter of overall presentation, which I think didn't do the movie good. Also, it has too much new stuff to the Star Wars saga, which is not good the first time you see it, but it gets better in the context of all the movies. Ep I had many Star Wars like themes: the underworld of the galaxy, and the mystic nature of the Jedi, which if done differently, it would not have been Star Wars anyway, but I think it could have gone better, but I don't think it is necessary for me. Now, although Ep. 2 has bounty hunters, it lacks a few Star Wars stuff, adding its own which ultimately become Star Wars stuff, right? But don't be too bothered by that. The first ones didn't deal that much with politics, but if that lacked in these ones, there would be no point to it. Or did you expect to take over the galaxy by killing a few people and moving the government to your will just because? Shame on you.

Also, the battle at the end wasn't as great as it could have been. The lightsaber duel that's really fun is Yoda's fight, although story wise, it didn't have consequence in the last film. The Geonosis battle, for those who have seen it, was great, except for one detail. All the Jedi in these movies look awesome, but there are two or three Jedi on screen that battle that ruined everything, and guess what, they all human. There are these two guys that throw lightsabers to Obi Wan and Anakin when they lose theirs, which made it look as if the Jedi have this huge vault with thousands of lightsabers. Lightsabers are supposed to mean something, not be mass produced like the lightsabers we use for toys! It would have been better if Ani and his master would have taken a couple of sabers from two of their fallen comrades. It would have been better, but, my imagination justifies the scene so George won't have to go in and fix it.

Now to the romance plot! Many people complain it wasn't good and didn't make sense because Anakin this and Anakin that. Shut up. Star Wars didn't need more of the romance plot than what the movie had. Amidala had always cared for him, and you can see it Natalie Portman's acting. It's not supposed to be deaper than just two people that love each other but can't express that love because of social standing, which is pretty clear in the movie. It didn't need more, given the context of being a romance that actually destroys them. Amidala cared for him, and after goiing with him to see his mother, her feelings for him grew. It was kinda obvious, a little abstract, but kinda there.

Last issue to finish this boringly long review. I loved Anakin in Ep I and 2, although there are themes, like Anakin's dreams that I think could have been focused here. By dreams I mean the stuff he wanted to do as a kid, but of course, he a Jedi now, and they don't look for adventure and excitement, although poor Anakin was a slave and hadn't seen much of the galaxy he so desperately wanted to travel. I loved a scene where Anakin is consumed by hatred after a bad and murderous deed, but there is still regret, the real trait behind the Darth Vader we all know he will become, its no secret. Anakin is a whiner for many people, but don't be fooled. We are living in a society where angered teenagers call whiners others who don't share their problems. Anakin in this film is ambitious, he feels his master doesnt give him credit or his idealistic believes of what a Jedi should be. Their first master-apprentice dispute in Amidala's apartment made clear Anakin's personality and the view he has on the Jedi, which I think affects the events in Ep 3. He was a Padawan in this movie, and thats what Hayden portrays, a padawan. Some people wanted him to be this cool, big or whatever guy. The story is about a good person that turns bad, and villains cant be villains just because the writer wants them to, which is what I feel many fail to realize when talking about Anakin/Hayden Christensen in this film. Someone said in here, Amazon.com, that Anakin wasn't believable because Jedi wouldn't train young Jedi to be like that. Well sir, you clearly didn't understand the movies, which are about a jedi who wants to be more, a desire that both destroys him and stirs a conflict of opinion within himself, which leads to the final event in Ep VI. Also, Anakin was too old to be trained. You think ""hes too old to begin the training"" is just a cool phrase? Jedi must detatch themselves of emotion and passion, not feelings, but emotion. Teaching that to a 10 year old like Anakin was just not done, it was too risky. Of course, you know what happens to him to know what am talking about. He was trained, since Yoda holds Obi Wan in high esteem...Dooku said that.

OK, the movie has ups and downs, but overall it is good, and please take in consideration some of the things I said here. The battles and the effects are magical, too colorful, but magical, taking you for the second (or fifth) time to that galaxy far far away only we true fans know how to enjoy.

This is better than that person who gives this movie a commercial rank thinks. This is a awesome movie and a another great movie by George Lucas,I think that anyone who's seen this movie and didn't like it should give it another chance(not me though I liked it the first time)and if you don't then your missing out on a great movie. This is a great movie and if you didn't like it the first time give it a second chance. This movie is very,very cool and you should watch it if you haven't and if you are thinking about it then just watch it all you have to lose is a couple of bucks and you will probably like it but if by some phenomenon you don't then all you lost was a couple of dollars. So find your nearest movie rental place and get it for a few days I'm pretty sure that(if your a star wars fan)you won't regret it. Oh and my favorite part of the movie was the battle of Geonosis where the Clones made there debut.well that's all I've got to say about this movie.",1119225600,2,1000,4.128205128205129

However, after I saw RoTS and gave AoTC another chance, I really liked this movie.  Anakin's actions are so much easier to understand after seeing the whole trilogy.

1311844,4,B00003CXKT,"AotC was a very good movie, but had some major flaws.  First the positive stuff.  I enjoyed the father-son relationship shown between Jango Fett and his cloned son, Boba.  I actually felt sorry for little Boba Fett when he saw Mace Windu decapitate his father, even though they were bad guys.  However, like his son in RotJ, I thought Jango died too easily and too anti-climatically.

Now, the bad. I know special effects technology has improved since the first SW trilogy, but why did Lucas have to make everything look so much more high tech in the prequels?  It makes no sense.  Also, Hayden Christiensen is a terrible choice for Anakin.  He totally ruined my image of that character.  I thought that Anakin was supposed to be a great man, and that his turn to the dark side was supposed to be a surprise and a tragedy!  Instead, Anakin is portrayed as a whiny little b**ch who thinks too much with his...ahem, ""lightsaber"", especially when he's around Padme, who we now know is Luke and Leia's mother.  The love story is heartwarming, since we know Anakin has loved Padme since he was 9, but it is portrayed too much as lust.  For example, Padme tells Anakin in one scene that hes making her uncomfortable and whenever Anakin is talking to her, especially when he says ""you have grown also"" or when hes confessing his feelings to her beside a burning fire, it is obvious that he is staring directly at her chest.  There is also a nightmare scene with Anakin that looks rather suggestive.  Also, we learn that Jar Jar Binks, possibly as a final gesture of disrespect to his many haters, is responsible for the rise of the Empire because he proposes that Palpatine gets emergency powers.

Its an improvement over Episode 1, but still leaves much to be desired.",1118188800,3,1762,4.620578778135048
1311845,5,B00003CXKT,"Exciting action scenes, great special effects, witty dialogue, angst-filled romance. Ignore naysayers who say the dialogue is terrible, (I would like to know what is so bad about it. It is an adventure movie and yet the dialogue is almost corn-free, yet many pretentious ""acting"" movies are full of corn), or the acting is bad. Hayden Christensen is convincing showing his angst and sometimes being a petulant brat, (he does play a teenager, yet critics seem to have a problem with him actually playing his part)setting up his path to the darkside. The mentor-student, father-son relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin is well done, shown in the movie with the fast and sometimes witty Star Wars dialogue I love.

If it seems I am attacking the critics it is because I do see a lot of pandering to snobbishness in many of their reviews, instead of an honest assessment of the movie. Also, too much nostalgic feelings from die-hard original Star Wars trilogy fans gets in the way of some of the reviews. Many of these reviewers are TOO stuck on their nostagia, and review by constantly comparing them to the old movies (a very high-standard indeed!), and whether they fulfill their nostagia, instead of just taking in the new movies as they are. If they just don't care for the movie, fine, but there is too much going into many reviews that have nothing to actually do with the quality of the movie itself.

In Attack Of the Clones, we find that 10 years have passed since that little slave boy Ani found his calling as the ""chosen one"" who would bring balance to the Force. Here, Anakin Skywalker is played by Hayden Christensen, who broods and complains throughout about how unfair his Jedi mentor Obi Wan Kenobi (played by Ewan McGregor) is to him, and falls in love with Padme (aka Queen Amidala, played by Natalie Portman), who rebukes his advances, despite romping through sunlit fields and dining in dark firelit chambers wearing backless dresses and leathery S&M style outfits. What a test for Anakin! Personally, I think she has issues of her own.

Meanwhile, the political backstory grows and becomes needlessly confusing. Are the clones bad? No wait, its the droid army that is bad... or what??

The relationship between Anakin and Padme is never convincing, which is the pivot on which this movie hinges. Without any real emotional investment, the viewer becomes distracted.

There are a lot of cool action sequences, the FX are stellar as usual, the acting is bad (as usual, with Natalie Portman being the worst) with the exception of Ewan McGregor, who channels Alec Guinness quit admirably. And then there is Yoda... if you've seen the movie, you know what I am talking about here -- do you laugh or cheer? Or both?

And as uninteractive computer games go this is a dud. Actors talk in ridiculous bland English accents and computer pixels dance manically across the screen so that the viewer has little idea what is going on and cares even less. Yawn-fest action scene follows yawn-fest action scene and everyone longs for it to be over quickly as it looks like a rubbish computer game. This confirms that the trilogy of Stars War prequels are the most absurd ""films"" ever committed to screen. Cripplingly uninteresting characters and shambolic storytelling, but delivered with a pomposity that suggests that the production team actually believe that these are important works.

We may marvel though that technological advancement now means that films look less impressive than they did almost 30 years ago. Star Wars (Episode IV) released in 1977 looks far better than the disorienting soulless computer-generated mess now served up to represent the galaxy far far away. No super cool Han Solo sparring with feisty Princess Leia. No we're stuck Ewan McGregor highlighting how much better Alec Guinness was, and a chap called Hayden doing the most compelling study of evil since Judd Nelson in Breakfast Club.

Though he has learned many a thing about the ways of the Jedi, he is still rather mischievious and rebellious.  But one thing has been keeping him on the serious side: a strange and painful dream he has been having about his mother.  He can hardly sleep because of it.  When he reunites with the lovely (And often emotionless when emotion is needed, even if she is a senator!) Padm'e Amidala, though, Anakin is distracted by her beauty and kindness.  Lucky him, his latest assignment is to guard her from a secret enemy that plans to assisinate her.  Obi-Wan, on the other hand, is busy looking into a cloning business, where trouble is lurking.  Will Obi-Wan be able to expose the enemies, inculding the assasin tracking Padm'e?  And will Anakin be able to win over the senator with his charm and determination, while also discovering the reason for the dreams?

This was a fantastic movie!  Hayden Christensen is great as ""Anakin""!  There was one part of the movie, in particular, where his acting lacked emotion, but then it built up and overall, it was a really good performance!  Natalie Portman, on the other hand, wasn't as great as ""Padm'e"".  She had her times when she showed emotion, but adding on to what I mentioned in my quick overview of the plot of the movie, she almost looked like she was holding back a smile in some of the serious parts.  Ewan McGregor was, of course, good as ""Obi-Wan"".  He had those few lines every now and then that brought some humor to the movie.  Oh, and now that I'm on the subject, this movie had it all!

The Phantom Menace
Attack of the Clones
Revenge of the Sith
A New Hope
The Empire Strikes Back
Return of the Jedi

1311938,2,B00003CXKT,This film is rather tedious and  quite uninteresting. The cinematography gives the film a busy look lending to its mediocrity.  The actors look tired and board as is the script. Go back to Episode One and savor the moment.,1117584000,2,222,4.666666666666667
1311939,3,B00003CXKT,"Set 10 years after 1999's EPISODE I, this whiz-bang spectacle is a two-and-a-quarter hour cornucopia of aliens, monsters, hardware and deep-space derring-do: everything but the kitchen sink and credible characters. There's a great deal of plot - seceding planets, disgruntled miners, political intrigue within the vast interplanetary senate - all subtly undermined by proper names that sound like baby talk: Naboo, Jar Jar, Boba, Windu, Dooku, Shmi. But what drives this second chapter in the beloved six-film saga (or more correctly, should drive it) is the transformation of teenage Jedi-in-training Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) from an impulsive youth into the man who will be Darth Vader. Granted, Lucas is at a disadvantage: Episodes four, five and six of the saga preceded episodes one, two and three, so major plot developments have been robbed of any potential for suspense. No matter how much the dewy Padm Amidala (Natalie Portman), former democratically elected child Queen of Naboo, loves Anakin, no matter how hard Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) tries to guide him away from his worst impulses, Anakin will surrender to the Force's dark side. That his destiny is preordained is no excuse for a Cliff's Notes telling. Anakin has sweaty nightmares (which might have been better staged with Christensen's hands above the covers); Anakin gets mad at father-figure Obi-Wan and throws things; Anakin gets really mad at the desert bandits who do his mother (Pernilla August) wrong and pulls a Lt. Calley, though this scene's impact is blunted by the fact that the massacre takes place offscreen. And familiarity is also no excuse for carelessness with beloved characters. When Obi-Wan laments to Anakin, ""Why do I get the feeling you'll be the death of me?"" we should feel a portentous frisson. Instead, it's a laugh line, designed to elicit the same delight as the sight of wizened Yoda (voice of Frank Oz) picking up a lightsaber and strutting his stuff (words like ""Tasmanian Devil"" and ""whirling dervish"" come to mind). And while it was always clear that Lucas cared more about special effects than acting, here his lack of interest has produced phenomenally wooden performances from newcomers and veterans alike: Only the imperious Christopher Lee, as baleful Count Dooku, emerges unscathed. Still, fans will groove on the film's many spectacular fight sequences, and welcome the answers to such mysteries as why Boba Fett has such a bee in his helmet about the Jedi and where the imperial stormtroopers came from.",1117411200,2,2546,5.212195121951219

1311941,4,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars Episode 2 AOTC was a very good movie and much improved compared to episode 1. Overall DVD quality is excellent with picture and sound, and deleted scenes,I believe there was 8 and they weren't anything spectacular that needed to be reincorporated into the movie.

  Now to the actual story and characters,the essence of the prequels lies within three people:Anakin,Padme,and Obi-Wan. Equal to say Luke,Leia,and Han. Here's where the characters are supposed to grow into whom their destined to be,it was fine to see Obi-Wan without that long braid padawan look and sporting a beard with long hair,I felt Ewan matured with his character and did a very affable job,I could see him truly as a young Alec Guinness. An interesting role for the reason that as a Jedi knight he was separated early on from Anakin to discover the assassination mystery by himself while Anakin had to protect senator Amidala. Kamino was an exciting new world, a water world just as consistent with the other planets and moons that had just one climate and one type of terrain.

  The one thing annoying about Kamino was the Kaminoans themselves,you see when I was just a kid, Return of the Jedi was my favorite because of Jabba's palace I loved all the monsters, now that I'm older The Empire Strikes Back is truly my favorite because all the alien characters are at a minimal. The look of the cloners with their long necks and disproportioned bodies reminded me of that fool Jedi master in episode 1 yareal poof. With more human characters the movies definately take on a much more serious tone.

  Jango Fett's addition was great,it introduces us to a very serious and dangerous villian. A stirring revelation when we learn that the clones were designed after him and that Boba Fett his son is actually his clone also. That's awesome. Now it's easy to understand why Boba Fett becomes the greatest bounty hunter in the galaxy,simply by being a clone means no sexual interaction and only concentration designated for why he was created in the first place, hunting prey. And being the best at it. What's also great about this movie is wittnessing Jango's skills as a pilot,finally we get to see the Slave 1 in action and Jango as well. With Boba's limited action in the trilogy it's refreshing to observe his father in action,so it's safe to say that's what Boba would be like in action including his ship.

  Now getting back to Obi-Wan I liked the way he unraveled the mystery going to Kamino and then Geonosis, and learning of the plot by Count Dooku,played terrifically by legendary horror star Christopher Lee. His presence as an actor definately improves the prequel with his foreboding essence and magnificent and sonorous voice. He was desperately required to improve on the lack of evil characters from episode 1. The lightsaber duel at the end was great,Dooku for an old man held his own well, because  he was a Sith lord, despite one reviewer's claim that the duel was boring between Dooku and Yoda, I would ask them if they fell asleep when the fight commenced, it was nothing short of spectactular,what with Yoda and his crazy spin moves. And to let this reviewer know that the movie show's how Dooku gets away,his ship with the parasail glides all the way to Coruscant where he hands his master the schematics of the Death Star plans while telling him about the clone wars beginning. And we learn that Poggle the lesser and his geonosian warriors hide in the catacombs of there world. On Geonosis, the Jedi choreography should have been better and Padme blasting away at battalions of battle droids without being blasted herself,considering she's no Jedi makes the scene appear a little ridiculous,seeing that many Jedi die.

  Another thing I didn't like was  the alliance formed by the separatist coalition it should have been clearer for the audience just who they are and what commerce they represent. It was a brief scene that would have been cool had Lucas introduced us to all these aliens other than Nute Gunray.example what's the corporate alliance, what does the Techno Union do?

  I felt that the tusken raider scene should have been longer with the emperor's music in the background while seeing a dark silhouette chopping them down in pieces. But so be it.

  Padme and Anakin, you knew it was coming,I felt the romance was strained and forced(no pun intended)sometimes less is more. They should have both felt strongly for eachother without having to speak. Learn from looking passionately without listening. When you hear someone say I Love You because your the most serene object I've ever set my eyes upon,the only thing you'll pick up is a slap in the chops. Geore should have left it alone,let it be a love of feeling,emotion and passion and dreams of what happiness may spring, and not cheesy dialogue.""are Jedi allowed to love?"" yes you may say that we're encouraged to love""

I mean what's that?

  Christian Haydensen's acting was worse than Lloyd's. First off he looked like a wimp and secondly his voice had no passion withdrawing from deep within. Portman was better her second time around but luckily we enjoy the movie for many other interesting things.

  One note I need to mention because many neglected to say it, Padme was the Naboo Queen not by birth but by election then she becomes a senator. Who in their right mind would elect a teenager to be ruler of an entire planet not just a country but a planet mind you? That's simply idiotic.

  And now about episodes 1 and 2. In 1 Palpatine manipulates the the greedy organ of commerce the trade federation to blockade his queen's planet in order for him to become chancellor, and when he does he'll shut himself in and become the last and most powerful chancellor of the old republic. Now I had said in my PM review that the trade federation blockade was never truly explained and i'm correct from a certain point of view, from Palpatine/Sidious he gets what he wants but the federations protest is not mentioned in the movie other than hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships,what's the purpose of blockading a planet which had nothing to with the taxation problem? Yes I know that Sidious told them to do it,but when Rune Haako says in TPM ""we should not have made this bargain"" it's never explained what Sidious promised the trade federation. Specifically what were they supposed to get out of this blockade. If you say more money that's to thin. To say the taxation would stop,what do the senators care about Naboo for?

  Anyway enough about that, in AOTC we learn that Dooku is Darth Tyranus and like sidious/Palpatine he's great at playing both sides of the fence. As Dooku he's political leader of the Separatist movement and allowing the republic every reason to create an army, as Tyranus he's responsible as Sidious' Sith lord to hiring Fett and begin operations for a clone army. However, whose money is it that funds the clone operation,as well who pays for all the armor and weapons and ship manufacturing. Was it Sidious or Dooku that killed master sifa Dyas? Some things aren't explained at all but overall it is a very exciting movie that easily should have been episode 1.",1117411200,,7198,4.762670957361223
1311942,3,B00003CXKT,"I thought I would review episode II in light of the theatrical release of episode III. Let's just say it straight out, this movie is pretty poor. The visuals are amazing, but pretty much everything that happens in the foreground - the acting and the dialogue are wretched.

The plot for what it's worth involves Obi Wan & Annakin uncovering a conspiracy to create a clone army and attempts to assassinate Amidala. In the process Annakin & Amidala become close and it closes with the beginning of the clone war. There are a few set-piece scenes such as the show down between Count Dooku and Yoda, and the initial opening melee but it's a fairly pedestrian affair.

This could have all been made interesting, but the performances are so cardboard that you never believe for a second that anything is really happening. The actors say their lines in front of blue screens and the action is put in around them later by computers. The visuals are pretty good it must be said but they still look phoney.

The net result is something that feels aloof and dull. It would not surprise me in the least if Lucas re-edits the prequels to perk them up a bit. He has done this in the past, sometimes to correct his mistakes but more likely as a cynical ploy to re-sell the same movie to fans keen to own every edition. Unless you're a hardcore fan, I'd say skip this.",1117411200,3,1352,4.487804878048781
1311943,4,B00003CXKT,"And the review continues...so the hero has been chosen and it is time for Anakin to begin his legendary adventure in that galaxy far far away. It has been 10 years since he was found by the now deceased Qui-Gon Gin and began his Jedi training under Obi-Wan Kenobi. Just when things were going well who just happens to show up. Padme Amidalla the now Senator for her home planet Naboo...and the wackiness ensues!!! `Attack of the Clones' is a step up above `The Phantom Menace' as all second chapters are in the great stories. The characters have been introduced and now its time to give them a problem. Unfortunately this episode is another disappointment to the obsessed fans of this story because what is featured is the love story between Anakin and Padme the to be parents of Luke and Leia, but don't count this one out so quickly my friends there some great things to be seen.

In this movie I loved that we got to see Courosant in its grandeur after being one of the biggest teases Mr. Lucas gave his fans with the special edition of `Return Of The Jedi' I loved the night clubs, the traffic and even the dinner...I felt very proud to be a New Yorker watching that. We also get to see how the system of Jedi training works and now we understand that Yoda really did instruct Obi-Wan because he trains every single Jedi. I also loved how we finally get to see the origin of the most mysterious character in the story to date...of course I'm talking about Boba Fett and I was amazed how his role in the story was much more complex than many had thought. There are also a few other pieces that are revealed which of course we all left hanging in the air just waiting for the next 3 years to pass for the space to be filled with Episode 3.

Altogether the movie is enjoyable unless you spent all your life living in your parents' basement and downloading scripts trying to spend hours upon hours memorizing every single level of the death star. It still however lacked that one little piece which we all had to wait another 3 years to see. Not even the great signature BMF lines from Sam Jackson, or Yoda's surprising fight scene at the end couldn't keep me satiated. Otherwise...the force was still with Mr. Lucas at that point in time and once again another fun film put in the books.",1117324800,,2288,4.419431279620853
1311944,2,B00003CXKT,"I just finished watching the series before heading out to watch Episode III. I had only once seen 4, 5, and 6 when they appeared in theatres and fell asleep during Return of the Jedi. My first reaction after rewatching them all was ""how did Lucas get so famous writing this drivel?"" I have to assume the only reason Hayden kept the part was because he looked so good in his Jedi uniform and could swing a saber well because the boy couldn't act a bit. His line delivery was painful. The Visine tears were laughable.

Lucas, Amadala was always heavily covered. Even when she went out in disguise in Menance, she wore modest attire. What in the hell persuaded you to put the girl in disco lycra, sheer bare back J.Lo scarfs and belly dancing attire? You completely short circuited her character.

Although Anakin's chase of Amadala is believable (likewise Han's of Leia), Amadala's speaking of her former crush and Anakin's stepbrother's girlfriend were completely out of line. I only have episode two on VHS and the deleted scenes of the two in her bedroom and them with her family talking about whether he was her boyfriend were horrid. How could Lucas even film such Ozzie & Harriete blather to put in a Star Wars film. How out of focus could he be?

The arena fight was a mess. They just threw everything and the kitchen sink in there.

Yoda and Count Dracula. I kept yelling ""Go for the knees, go for the knees!!!""",1117152000,8,1417,4.545098039215686
1311945,2,B00003CXKT,"First off, Haydan Christiansen's acting as Anakin was horrible. Normally, I wouldn't care, but he's the central character and should at least be able to read lis lines belivably. Mark Hamill was nowhere near a great actor, but he made you feel what Luke felt, not boredom. Other than that, this movie wasn't that bad. Until the end, that is. I loved the fight between Obi-Wan and Jango. I think it's my favorite Star Wars action moment. And yes, Jar Jar Bink's role has been significantly reduced, thank god. But I began to hate this movie after Anakin and Padme touched down on Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan. The conveyer belt scene was terrible and felt like it belonged in an episode of Tom & Jerry, not a Star Wars film. When C-3P0's head was switched with the battle droid's I knew this film couldn't redeem itself. The arena scene was pretty good, but it was ruined when the Jedi arrived. Jango was killed off way to quickly, and I don't know how Dooku and the other Separatists got away. The fight between Yoda and Dooku was lame (I mean come on, he was a puppet in the original 3 films. he could barely walk!!!). The only real purpose this film served was to explain what the Clone Wars were, and give us insight into the relationship of Anakin and Padme. Speaking of which, why would Padme marry Anakin after he admitted to slaughtering dozens of innocents. I think that scene was essential to showing his darker side, but he should never have admitted it to her.",1117065600,5,1469,4.526315789473684

It really needs some life brought to the screen. The unfortunate thing is that not one actor in this film or any part of its script can give it life. Very unfortunate. Disc 2 really lacks anything of substance and is very repetative.",1117065600,3,366,4.397058823529412
1312061,5,B00003CXKT,"THE PLOT:
This is where it all began. This is where the volcano of hate and resentment inside Anakin erupts and commences his slide to the dark side.
In ""Episode II, Attack of the Clones"" the little boy we first met in ""The Phantom Menace"" has grown up to become a man and a Jedi, well almost a man and almost a Jedi. With his growing skills to pilot a cruiser and weild a lightsaber, Anakin achieves the confidence of taking on the most powerful enemies. He is put in charge of protectecting Padme, the beautiful senator from Naboo while his master, Obi Wan investigates the far reaches of the galaxy for the enemies of the Republic. Anakin's growing indicipline and impatience as he argues with Obi Wan on smallest issues is noted by Amidala and the Jedi council.
But what none of them knows is that they are all puppets in the hands of the dark lord, acting through his most powerful device, Chancellor Palpatine.
I don't want to give away too much and ruin it for you but I will say this, each character in Star Wars has an important role to play, no matter how insignificant or irritating we find him in the beginning. Jar Jar, the menace of Episode I fulfills his destiny when he represents Senator Amidala and Naboo in the Senate and foolishly puts forth a motion to grant emergency powers to Palpatine, a move that made Palpatine the dictator.
Shimi, mother of Anakin, is abducted by Sand People. Anakin goes to rescue her and when she dies in his arms, he goes overboard and kills all the sand people. ""I killed them. I killed them all. And not just the men, but the women and the children. I hate them"", he later tells Padme. This dialogue and the one where he says he will become most powerful Jedi and learn how to stop death itself are the keys to his corruption.
 The Bounty Hunter: he is the one of provides his DNA for the clones of the army.

THE DVD:
 The dvd actually contains some deleted scenes. What you will find surprising is the end. They actually showed Anakin's mechanical hand in Padme's as they kissed after their wedding. I don't remember this scene from the theatrical version.
 The 2nd DVD contains upto 8 deleted scenes. The one that I found most interesting was that of Padme adressing the senate and opposing the creation of the army.

 FINAL WORD: I didn't like Hayden Christensen when I saw the movie the first time but now I think he he played his part of a troubled youth well. Natalie Portman looks even more beautiful in this movie and Ewan McGregor makes a convincing Obi Wan.
 The DVD is definitely worth buying and adding to your collection.",1117065600,2,2585,4.475583864118896

Dialog written for (and perhaps by) the demographic aged 12 to 15, but with the film structured so it is difficult for grown-ups to follow the plot if they are not already ""fans"".

""Rubber mask"" aliens colliding with expensive ""cgi"" creations.  Not a pleasant combination.  Compare the sleek, flawless look of the long-necked ""Lamma Su"" with the ""tentacle-headed"" Jedi in the arena scene near the end.

Count Dooku on his custom ""bluescreen"" landspeeder.  Nuff said.

The ""air car"" chase in the ""ginza"" neighborhood on Coruscant.  Rips off ""Blade Runner"" on so many levels.

Other long and expensive chase scenes...I've seen enough asteroids now, Mr. Lucas, can we move along with the story?

Painful, strained romantic scenes between Padme and Anakin, complete with mini-lectures on how important democracy is.

The death of Anakin's mother to ""shape his future dark character"".  Boo, hiss.

Havoc on the droid assembly line.  What is this, Scooby Doo?

A battle in an arena with ""monsters"".  Why, exactly?  Haven't the evil ""guppy"" Trade Federationists learned that you just shoot the heroes after you capture them?  Otherwise, Jedi reinforcements are sure to arrive.

The Death Star plans (it all fits on a single CD!), designed by ""hive people"".  Ooh, don't let the Jedi find that, Mr. Bug!

The Yoda/Dooku light saber battle.  Anyone remember Miss Piggy's karate scenes?  The uncanny resemblance is probably Frank Oz's private joke on the Star Wars franchise.

This movie shows George Lucas's creativity and pure genius in this breathtaking masterpiece!!!! This movie is one of those movies that you will remember for many years!!! The movie is filled with action, adventure, romance, drama, and a little bit of comedy!!! The movie features many sheer amazing ; environments and planets!!! The movie spans out from coursant, the Galatic Capital of the Republic, to the beautiful planet of Naboo( I don't know if I spelled the planet right for those hardcore fans), to the remote desert planet of Tatooine, and to the mysterious planet of Geneoisis where the Clone Wars begin!!! Oh... and you can't forget about the planet Camino where the mysterious cloners live!!! Unlike the first movie there are more various environments and a lot more of basically everything!!! This movie blows""Phantom Menace"" out of the water!!! This movie fills in many of the missing pieces( like my title states ) and is like a little breath of fresh air. The movie shows how Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen)has matured as a jedi and shows the begging of his transformation into Darth Vader!!!!!! The Movie kicks off when Senator Padme Amidala ( Natalie Portman/ one of the hottest women of all time) is almost assinated when she comes to coursant to cast a very important vote to the Senate, by a mysterious bounty hunter!!! The Jedi Council which include: Yoda( Frank Oz) and Mace Windu (Samuel Jackson) assign Obi Wan (Ewan McGregor) to investigate the matter while Anakin is assigned to protect Padme!!! At this point the story unfolds with lots of action which involves speeder chases, adventuring to diffent worlds as the plot unfolds, showdowns with a Bounty Hunter/ Jango Fett, a fighter fight in an astroid field feat. The Slave 1 and The Jedi Starfighter which leads basically to the collesum where the Clone Wars break out!!! There are two story lines the investigation with Obi Wan and Anakin and Padme's which is filled much of Anakin dangerous emotions and basically shows the warning signs of trouble!!! The main bad guy is count Douku/Darth Tyraneous(Christopher Lee) which is a major roll in Star Wars history!!! I'm not going to give away the whole movie so you will just have to rent it or buy it to find out all the secrets!!! You also notice how the family tree of Star Wars is forming and the everlasting companionship between R2-d2 and C3-PO which give the movie a great begging and flavor the movie in general!!! The special feature are awesome also and deserve to be checked out also!!! This is a great movie for harcore Star Wars fans, action/adventure people(like me), or people looking for a good movie!!!

1312064,1,B00003CXKT,"No one doubts that George Lucas can draw beautiful pictures, but in this film he proves once and for all that he can no longer make good movies. Hopefully they'll make a ""best of Star Wars"" DVD and include a few battle scenes and sabre fights from episode II so you can see the pretty pictures but don't have to wade through the rest of this dreck.

I won't give this movie any credit for effects or imagery or even the sometimes good acting you'll find. That's because there is no good dialogue in this movie and we no longer have to take Harrison Ford's word for it (Ford reportedly changed lines which Han Solo was supposed to say causing arguments on the set of the first 3 movies). The lines in this movie are immature and embarassing, especially between Portman's and Christiansen's characters. For this reason the scenes in the love story aspect are strained at best when they don't fall flat. I couldn't remember anything a la ""Let the Wookie win"" or ""Don't get cocky, kid"" which would bring a smile to my face within a week of watching this film.

Maybe the lackluster love story in this film symbolizes the frustration of former fans of the series. Natalie Portman's increasingly complex character seems to love the future Vader character and be repulsed by him in the same way that ""Star Wars (IV)/ESB(V)"" fans will no doubt want to like this film more than they'll be able. Many will no doubt fake it, and every review I read praising it either rings hollow or makes me wonder if they can tell the difference between a great film and a mediocre one.",1116806400,9,1561,4.512367491166078

The dramatic parts lacked all authentic emotion, the story line, if you found one, was poorly progressed, and the acting, aside from Obi wan and the emperor, was down right horribal.

  Lucas did write this screen play, but after seeing the movie I am left asking myself if Lucas actually watched the original trilogy. Taking it as a hole, the movie was full of inconsistancies...

  Its a shame he returned to this world, or at the very least being foolish enough to do the work himself. He was better off going with the Timothy Zahn books. they would have wrung more true to the universe",1116460800,6,756,4.604477611940299

1312068,4,B00003CXKT,"This film still lacks the wit and style that came naturally to the original trilogy.  Much like the first film, I feel that the actions of many of the characters were forced on the audience in an attempt to create some sort of likeable character.  In ""Menace,"" we were force-fed Darth Maul in order to make him like Boba Fett.  In other words, Boba Fett had a small part in the original trilogy, but people attached themselves to the character.  Maul failed to do this in ""Menace.""  In ""Clones,"" we are given Dooku and Zam Weezel(spelling?).  Although Zam has one of the better parts in this film(the chase scene on Coruscant was fun to watch), there just isn't anything there that makes you ""feel"" for the character.  Dooku just looks silly.  I never thought that he could handle Yoda, Anakin, and Obi-Wan Kenobi.  He doesn't have the presence that Darth Vader, or even the Emperor, had in the original films.

On the plus side, we are given a pretty good amount of battle scenes with Jedi, clones, and droids.  All of these were executed with grand precision.  The lightsaber battles between Jedi and Sith were less than memorable, but they suffice.  Anakin's move to the darkside is almost too obvious in this story, probably due to the fact that Hayden Christiansen was a poor choice to portray Skywalker in this film.

The addition of Jango Fett and little Boba was good.  Jango almost manages to gain the notoriety of his clone offspring when he battles Kenobi on Camino.  As a matter of fact, Ewan McGregor seems to be the best actor in this flick.  His character seems to be the best acted and developed in all of this film.  He practically saves the movie on his own.

""Clones"" is a step up from ""Menace.""  It still lacks in many areas, but it moves with decent continuity and does manage to hold your attention better than ""Menace.""  Other than that, this story modestly served its purpose to move along the descent of Anakin Skywalker.

Actually, I think the deleted scenes with commentary shows some of George Lucas' weaknesses as a director and screen writer in terms of emotional scenes - basically it doesn't look like he is good at writing scenes for female characters or determining how to use politics for dramatic build-up to support the larger context of the action scenes.

For example, Padme is given a scene in the begining of the movie that showed her leading the opposition to the War Powers Act. In it, she basically names the main problem with the Republic creating a Grand Army during the negotiations - it would basicallyindicate build up for war and coopt the peace talks with the Separatists. Now, as a political science major, that made sense to me. What didn't make sense was the decision to cut it - G. Lucas says the politics takes away from the action scenes - but the main problem with 'Star Wars' is that the action results from the politics, and by cutting scenes like this, you remove Padme from the main action of the film. The final films, I think, did a disservice to Natalie Portman and Padme by keeping only scenes referencing her love affair with Anakin but cutting the scenes in which we see her act as a diplomat. The result is that it is never clear whether Padme is important outside of a few references, but you'll have a better opinion as to what personal qualities she has that makes others consider her the leader of the Loyalist movement after viewing some of the cut scenes. It also shows the tension between the Loyalists and the Jedi; the Loyalist oppose the creation of an army to support the Jedi peacekeepers, but such a force might be advantagetous to the Jedi. There is a scene in the theatrical release in which the War Powers are given to the Supreme Chancellor that stands in direct contrast to how Padme actively stood up to the entire Senate in the cut scene. The Jedi at this point are so busy with philosophizing that Padme and her allies seem to be carrying the entire debate forward on their own, while the Jedi Masters Yoda and Windu stand off to the side. Whereas Padme is an active force in the deleted scenes, the Jedi are entirely reactionary, and it would be nice to see how the good guys work for the same goals with different mindsets.

Basically, every scene in which Padme appears doing something other than looking uncomfortable with Anakin is cut, so the result is a bunch of Jedi missions, which look cool, but are weakened without the political motivations of Padme's anti-war stance clearly enumerated (for example, Padme says something about how a failure to adapt leads to extinction...which basically underlines the main problems of the struggling Republic and the weakened Jedi Order; however G. Lucas cut it to move the action further).

In fact, after viewing some of the deleted scenes (which clocked in at far fewer minutes than some of the overblown landscape pans or action scenes) I wanted to rate the movie as a four. Mainly for the fact that Natalie Portman breathes some life into the role of Padme that was missing from the theatrical release, and the action takes on a new context when there is a background story that shows how the Republic operates and shows exactly what was lost when the Emperor took control.",1116288000,3,3542,4.698872785829308

1312152,3,B00003CXKT,"O.K., this movie gets unfairly bashed by many, which isn't fair. People saying that this was just as bad or worse then episode 1 are completely off target. Episode 2 is a improvment from the abotion that was Phantom Menace, but that is not to say that this movie has some serious flaws,LOL, it has many, but it is still better them Menace. Like PM, i saw it when it first hit the big screen and felt sick when i left the threater, however, when it came out on disc i did give it another chance and have come to the conclusion that this is an improvment over the fairy tale episode 1. Sure, the acting might be as bad as episode 1 and probably rivals it in the horrid over useage in CGI, but this was a hell of a lot more entertaining, here is why:

If you are a STAR WARS junkie such as my self, Episode 2 does explaine alot of the back ground to the STAR WARS universe. We first heard of the Clone Wars when Obi-Wan mentions it to Luke in the first STAR WARS movie (A New Hope) and we are left with that, so for over 20 years, we were left with our imaginations as to what that war was about and what happened in it, this movie is about the beginning of that conflict. The next thing is that the origins of some of the most famous and popular SW character is explained here. The bounty hunter Boba Fett is one, as we had no idea who he was or where he came from, we just had tidbits of information about him from novels and other sources (well, if you read the Boba Fett mini story ""The Last One Standing"" which was published years before the prequils, you find out that Fett's real name was Jaster Mereel, which does not fit with episode 2's explanation of his real name being Boba Fett, lucas screwed himself there). Episode 2 also showed how the basis of the Empire was built with the clone troopers, who were the ancestors of the stormtroopers, created by DNA from Jango Fetts blood (Boba's Daddy). We also get to see Obi-Wan's character get fleshed out, i liked that alot because IMHO he is the most interesting and provokative character in the whole SW universe. Episode 2 did its job of explaining the origins for key characters that would play out in later chapters such as the beginning of Anakins decent towards darkness and the eventual build up of the imperial empire which would dominate the oringal trilogy. As a fan, those aspects of the film are what made it enjoyable and entetaining to me, however, the good points end there and here is why:

The acting is simpley horrible, and i am gonna take it easy on Chisten Haydenson, because i realize his immature portrayal was supposed to be that way; Lucas wanted his character to be a pain in the @$$ whinbag as to relfect Anakins teenage immaturity. Some of the lines are just downright rancid, ""I hate it when he does that"" retorts Obi Wan at one point in the film, or the infamous Rough/Smooth comment made by Ani. We get downright meaningless characters we could care less about with acting that most 6th grade plays could beat. When people complain about how poorly acted it was, they are right, the preformance  almost touches the atrocious acting of such classics as Steet Fighter 2 the Movie or Mortal Kombat, you think with all the money Lucas had, he could of hired a real director? I will admit this is STAR WARS, but C'mon, some of the acting could of been ALOT better. We had to endure insipid acting through out the whole movie, which was equivelnt to torture. CGI was overused as well, i can tolerate some CGI, but too much will just ruin a movie, like it did here. The next thing i really did not like was that there was no real pay off at the end off it, we suffered though insipid acting to get to a battle between two CGI armies no one could giva a flying **ck about. The Yoda VS Dooku battle made me pi$$ myself laughing, seeing a green 3 foot tall dwarf bounce around the place just made it seem like a saturday morning cartoon rather then a space epic which this movie was trying to be.

So, i think that if you are a STAR WARS fan, you can be somewhat forgiving to episode 2 because, but not too much. It is true that this is a step upfrom Episode 1, but not by much, i really did not think he should of made prequils like this, they should of been alot more serious/dark (which 3 is supposed to be) then these brainless CGI marathons and wooden acting extravaganzas.",1116201600,3,4354,4.2996345919610235

1312155,4,B00003CXKT,"Pampered Americans like to complain as a way of convincing themselves that they are fine critics and connoisseur's of art. People feel almighty when they are able to criticize the work of George Lucas himself.

In examing reviews for Episode I and II by professionals and the public, I noticed an astonishing trend. People received the prequels, in general, quite warmly (it not with high enthusiam) upon first arrival.

However, the few ""uber"" fans and those who are typically intolerant of film that is not purely ""intellectual"" managed to bitch and moan so much for so long that the attitude rubbed off on just about everyone. Reviewers who once had a good word or two for TPM and AOTC now dismiss them as obnoxious, superflous, clucky, irrelevant, etc. This is probably just another way to increase everyone's longing for the last movie... a longing not dissmilar to that a a child dreaming of cake after being spoiled with perfectly good bread.

Anyways, to the point. Star Wars Episode II is not a perfect, Oscar worthy movie. But it is Star Wars! It is continuing the Star Wars tradtion in its own shape and form.

First, of all, many people complained that the story fell to the wayside with all the emphasis on special effects. Why did they thus complain? Because they were not paying attention, that's why! The plot wasn't necessarily simple, but if one paying attention perceives that it is very well designed. Senator Palpatine's actions totally parallel Bismarck/Hitler, stirring up conflict to legally gain power. The politics/economics are actually very interesting for those who care to pay attention.

There are also the creatures. I adore the creatures. The Galactic Senate thrills me because we see all these species interacting... the prequels are far more universal than the originals in this way... we see a little more of what goes on in the outside world.

The various droids are always delightful, the wild creatures on Naboo, the multi-cultural Jedi council, the beautiful architecture. There is so much high society and artistry that goes unnoticed because people are distracted by the awkard dialogue. As for Jar Jar Binks? I think he is quite a character! People tend to vent their rage on one thing... Jar Jar was the victim. Keep in mind that these movies were supposed to be fun for the whole family, whether you like it or not. Jar Jar is great for the kids. Yeah, he's goofy, but he's charming, and you can't help but pity him when he is tricked into bringing on the Republic's demise. I really wanted him to redeem himself in AOTC.

And then there was a taste of club life, and an amazing battle between Yoda and Dooku (who I enjoy, because the fact that he seems barely evil gives him a bit of dimension). And how can one not delight in seeing the mini Boba Fett and discovering that he is actually a twin of the Storm Troopers! The cloners are so cool looking too.

The acting is another thing people rant about. Well, the original movies did not exhibit absolutely stellar performances. The dialogue was not very well written, so it would be very difficult for the actors to execute it convincingly. It was awkward and did lack fluidity, but that is all right. Besides, cheesy lines are part of the whole Star Wars package! Luke and Leia and C3PO were saying ""I have a bad feeling about this"" years before Anakin made is rough sand, smooth Naboo comment.

And as far as the love story is concerned... honestly, despite the fact that they were older and more sarcastic, were Han and Leia any better? Padme and Anakin sort of have a baby love, and I still am shocked that such a well-to-do, respected senator would go for a whiny, negative, obsessive guy like him... but maybe she wanted to ""fix him."" I totally thought she would be the type to go for Obi Wan. Anyways, the romance left much to be desired, but it wasn't godawful.

There is great action... light sabers, escape from an execution. There is also much character development. I thought the Tatooine scene was riveting. Anakin watching his mother's life slip away and his ruthless slaughter of the Tuscan raiders is very compelling. On top of that, we meet Luke's future aunt and uncle, who seem quite pleasant and sort of make you pity their grim fate.

All in all, this movie has been given a bad wrap. Episode I was playfully charming, but effective. It gave us a new look at the world of Star Wars... a mor euniversal picture that showed civilization and introduced delightful characters and great action. I actually am intrigued by the mediclorian concept... it does not entirely defeat the spiritual aspect, for humans must be in tune with the medicloreans, but they must be in tune with the Force. Episode II was darker and a little bit uncomfortable in parts, but it accomplished what it set out to do: it set the stage for the Clone Wars, brought Anakin closer to the dark side while uniting him with Padme, and again, continued the tradition of exciting creatures and an intricate, action packed story.

The critics of Episode II ought to step back and take a better look. There is more to a story than the romance and the fate of the main characters. I think it is the wide array of supporting characters and the background material that make this movie such a rich tapestry.",1115856000,9,5284,4.69438444924406
1312156,5,B00003CXKT,"I have gone back and watched all five Star Wars films out after two years of neglect in preparation for Revenge of the Sith and I must say, this one is much more fun to watch than any of them. The Empire Strikes Back might be better written, better acted, and more beautiful visually (Cloud City and Hoth are my two favorite locations out of any Star Wars film thus far), but Attack of the Clones beats it out in terms of sheer enjoyability.

Admittedly, most of this stems from what many consider errors on the part of George Lucas. Anakin and Padme are both hideously acted; the young Skywalker's termper tantrums and creepy declarations (""There hasn't been a day in the last ten years when I haven't thought of you."" Um... a little obsessive there?) are the primary ""fault."" However, seeing as the movie features zooming starships (sound does not exist in space), faster-than-light travel, aliens who are evolutionarily near-impossible, and other things that defy reality and science, the acting is the least of my concerns. It only adds to the hillarity of the film that Hayden Christiansen overdramatizes his already atrocious lines. I see it as a good move on the part of Lucas, a step back to the science fiction melodramas of his youth, which have sadly become near-obsolete. It's not as though ""bad"" (which in this case means good) acting doesn't already permeate the saga; witness Mark Hammil's godawful performance in Return of the Jedi for further proof. The intentional humor, although usually not as funny as the ""love"" sequences, is also very strong, perhaps stronger than in any Star Wars film up until this point. Am I the only one who gets a kick out of watching the overly-polite C-3PO scream out ""DIE, JEDI SCUM!"" while his head is (accidentily) attatched to a battle droid's body?

Humor is not the only thing that makes this film incredibly fun; the action sequences are the best I've seen in any Star Wars movie so far other than the duel at the end of The Phantom Menace. After several viewings, I still feel llike I'm on a rollar coaster during the Coruscant speeder chase and am in awe of Yoda's fighting prowess (although in a little over a week, the duel with Count Dooku will be quickly eclipsed by the four epic battles from Revenge of the Sith). Yes, it's all over-the-top, but it seems that Lucas is aware of it and intended it to be this way. I think this movie (and for that matter, Episode I) is disliked by so many supposed ""true fans"" because they expect it to be some kind of epic, like the science fiction version of Hamlet. Relax folks, it's just a science fiction movie. This isn't supposed to be extremely deep, thought-provoking, or even realistic... it's supposed to be fun, and Lucas delivers once again. Honestly, it's a lot better than Return of the Jedi (the epitome of a movie that takes itself more seriously than it should)... and this is coming from someone who has a slightly more balanced perspective, seeing as I did not have very much time to obsess over the original three films and develop unreasonably high expectations.

A must for the DVD collection of anyone who can still sit back, relax, and have some fun. And for the record, I am not being sarcastic at all in this review. I truly, deeply love how this movie was put together and think it's a fine addition to the Star Wars universe.",1115769600,12,3349,4.634680134680135
1312157,2,B00003CXKT,"The reason ""Star Wars"" fans reluctantly  trudge to the theaters is because they all remember that rush.  It was the rush of seeing Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo and spectacular space battles and a pop culture mythology that they could call their own.  The characters were more than endearing, the stories more than just escapist fluff.  When people thought of ""Star Wars,"" they thought of cinematic storytelling at it's zenith.  Then they all saw ""The Phantom Meanace.""  Many left tht theaters in awe of how far Lucas had fallen, how far his creative instincts had gone astray.  But, with dutiful apprehension, the faithful saw ""Attack of the Clones"" with fingers so tightly crossed they were almost in knots.  People still left the theaters in a dissappointed, gloomy mood.

Director George Lucas has one big assumption wrong,  He thinks that if he piles on the visual dazzle and F/X fireworks that audiences will overlook shortcomings in the little things like acting, dialouge and storytelling.  But Lucas should have realized that the masses adored the original trilogy  because of great acting and writing with groundbreaking visual effects a flashy but much welcome bonus.  In ""Attack of the Clones,"" Lucas does indeed pile on the visual eye candy, and it is not without merit.  Beautifully rendered worlds continue to populate Lucas fabled galaxy with many new and fascinating creatures.  But no matter how awesome the visuals may be, they cannot overcome Lucas' shortcomings as a writer and as a director.  The film opens as Padme (Natalie Portman) arrives on Courescant to voice her opposition to the creation of a Galatic Army to counter the gathering threat of a separatist movement, led by the nefarious Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and the sleazy trade federation still in business after the events of Episode I.  Throughout the film, it becomes clear that the real puppet master is Darth Sidious/Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), slowly positioning himself to take his place as a Sith Emperor.  After a failed assaination attempt of Padme, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is enlisted to protect her while Ob1-Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) goes hopping around the galaxy to find the killer.

Even with the enticing set-up of galatic conspiracy and budding romance, Lucas fails to generate any tension in the plot of any fire in the love story.  Lucas is an inferior director of actors and it shows.  The romanic interplay between Portman and Christensen is almost laughable and cloying.  It is almost impossible to be taken by their plight when they feel so pastic and distant.  Lucas also fails to show the raging anger and despair within Anakin, especially when he realizes he is powerless to stop the fate that awaits his mother.  And despite all the talent Lucas has around him elsewhere with Ewan McGregor, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee and Ian McDiarmid, none give truly memorable turns as what should have been truly remarakable characters.

And Lucas even fails to generate any genuine excitement during the signature ""Star Wars"" action sequences.  His flat-footed direction seems to translate just as easily to action set-pieces as it does to character development.  The galatic dogfights, lightsabre duels and great clashes of armies may be visually impressive, packing on digital detail (see the final battle scene) but no real tension comes of it.  Part of the problem is also that audiences don't care for or root for the characters with they take to swashbuckling derring-doo because Lucas did not develop any characters worth caring about.  One important lesson Lucas needs to learn is that strong characters are the backbone to any good story and that if you have good characters, battle scenes will be so much more impressive because audiences have characters to root for and they will allow themselves to give in to the operatic grandeur.  But none of this really matters to Lucas.  He make films the way he wants to, no matter how flawed they are.",1115683200,7,3996,5.064220183486238
1312158,2,B00003CXKT,"I watched this film with high expectations, you would expect a star wars film to be nothing less than extravagant, but this time round it was not the case.  First of all my interest started to drift from this film, when I spotted acting flaws in both hayden and Ewans performance.  However after talking to many people who have watched the film and reading other reviews, it seems i'm not the only one who spotted bad acting.  The worst performance came from Hayden Christensen, especially on the emotional scenes.  I have read that George Lucas was initially going to take on Leornardo DiCaprio to play Anakin, which in my opinion was a much better choice.  Not only DiCaprio looks like the boy in Phantom Menace, but he is a better actor and would've held a stronger screen presence.  Surprisingly, Ewan's performance wasn't as strong in this one, as it was in the Phantom Menace, I think maybe he was too relaxed in his role.  I think Lucas focused so much on special effects and the digital yoda, that he forgot what makes a good film in the first place, and thats 'performance.'  After watching the documentaries on the dvd, Christopher Lee said that despite the fact that the effects have taken over a fair bit, there is still a strong need for performance, however since Lee's character was played by a body-double in most of his scenes, I find this ironic.

Now the positive aspects of the film.  Well done ILM, for bringing digital Yoda to life.  Superb scene, with Yoda fighting with his light saber, but I don't think this was enough to save the film from its demise.  The soundtrack was the strong hold of the picture, I think John Williams scored superbly, bringing the feel of love into the story.

The film wasn't all bad, but you would expect better from a Star Wars film, and the bad acting did let the film down dramatically.  I hope Lucas can pick up on his mistakes from this one, and improve on his next film.",1115683200,5,1930,4.540462427745664

1312248,5,B00003CXKT,"The romance in Episode II was not a failure at all. It did its job perfectly.

Anakin Skywalker is a Jedi Knight, whose eventual change to the light side happens because of his emotions - not because of his skills with the ladies. Once again, he's a Jedi. In other words, the Star Wars equivalent of mix between a Cardinal and a member of the National Guard (or the like). His ""wooden"" performance was due to that fact, and other tragic factors shown clearly throughout the movie. Is Skywalker a role model for college daters? No. But he's not (supposed to be) a role model for anything, imbeciles. He's a living Faustian tragedy, if y'all haven't noticed. He's the main character in a personal tale and a religious tale - not a romantic or political tale. What happened with him made perfect sense.

Even in real life, you won't find ultra-religious people being light, funny, and cocky (in any sense of the word) around women, unless it's in an innocent, altruism-based way. Duh. And do you think ultra-religious people care? No. Not too much. Why should they place priority on diddling a few worthless whores over being a great, pure human and having eternal bliss?

He's the Christlike figure of the Star Wars universe too. That's not a sacreligious comment on my part; it's an obvious occurrence that everyone should have noticed. Christ going bad and  having a woman, any woman, would make him a bad boy and a hardcore romantic by his Heavenly standards. Again: I'm only pointing out the obvious.

It's sad to know I'm the only one who can understand that, though.

1312254,1,B00003CXKT,"This weak film features several very large plot holes rather than many small ones. The first, biggest, most serious is Anakin Skywalker's obvious unfitness for all the jobs he is given and the Jedi Order's apparent inability to see this.

Anakin is a technically precocious Jedi with almost no discipline. He is emotionally involved with Padme--as he freely tells people--and is a hothead and loose cannon. He is, in other words, not what a Jedi should be.  The Jedi Council, that collection of oh-so-sapient magi presided over by the Green Guru, rejects Obi-Wan's warning and sends Anakin to guard Padme. (""The Council is confident in its decision."") Unbelievable!

One source of Anakin's anxiety is his mother. This problem could have been solved, of course, if anyone had thought of buying her freedom and bringing her to Coruscant--the giant fly who owned her was obviously willing to sell--but nobody cares about poor Shmi. Even her son, who, with all his powers, might have thought to suggest setting her free, evidently never came up with so striking and original an idea. This too is unbelievable and utterly ridiculous. (And communications in the galaxy are apparently very limited, surprising for such technologically advanced people. There have been no messages between Luke and his mother for ten years. One might think she'd drop him a line occasionally (at least a postcard, if not a hologram) about such things as her being freed or getting married, or that he might write to her.)

Obi-Wan goes to tremendous lengths to run down Zam, the mercenary who tries to kill Padme. When Zam is shot and killed by a poison dart, however, and the two Jedi see the killer take off via rocket-pack, they just sit there looking at the dart. Why not pursue the killer?

Curious that an ex-queen and present senator should pack her own luggage, and that she and her bodyguard should carry it themselves when they arrive. Anakin can't be too intent on his job, either, to so encumber himself.

The scene in the ""diner"" is what Mr. Lucas calls a ""homage to American Graffiti"", but it is still laughably idiotic. The full resources of the Galactic Republic cannot discover where a dart comes from, but a short-order cook can (a cook who of course prospected ""on Subterrel beyond the Rim"" (but apparently without much success, considering the job he now has.)) And how humble Mr. Lucas is, to pay homage to himself.

The scenes on Kamino are preposterous. First, the Kaminians must be unbelievably stupid if they cannot figure out that Obi-Wan has not been sent to collect the clone army but is an intruder. (Jango Fett does, instantly). Second, the Kaminians, a  race of wispy, effeminate animated giraffes, hardly seem capable of slapping anyone, let alone engaging in human cloning and running an up-to-date war college. Among all the fairy-tale creatures and silly freaks with which Mr. Lucas populates his universe, the Kaminians are probably the least convincing. (One might also think that the planet Kamino would contact somebody about the 1,200,000 clones they think the Jedi ordered, rather than waiting years for somebody to show up and ask. And who paid for all this? Who's writing the checks to Kamino? Does it occur to anyone to find out?)

The comment track reinforces what I have said before. The mechanics again bloviate incessantly on how wonderfully clever they are. See how Sebulba's tentacles move! Behold him walking on his hands! Look how he adjusts his goggles! Lo! Lama Su brushes his knee! (""An extra level of acting and realism"" says the commentator).
  If you didn't know how great ILM and its clones are, they will certainly tell you.

So farewell to Star Wars II, a testimony to George Lucas's inability to write any more decent, or logical, scripts, to the poverty of his mind, to the victory of appearance over substance. But before you go, a little game for you. I was hoping to see, among all the wondrous devices shown on the bonus disk, the Alphabet Soup Generator that comes up with all those great names that decorate the end titles. From the list below, pick  the memorable names of real characters from the silly ones I invented.

1312255,5,B00003CXKT,"This movie is as perfect as Episode I. George Lucas is brilliantly making these prequels, so that Episode III will be an extremely sad Tragedy.

Everything in this movie is done perfectly. The Galaxy is falling in to darkness, and it can be seen in this movie. Buy this movie. You won't regret it. It fits with the rest of the Star Wars Saga perfectly.",1114214400,2,352,4.415384615384616
1312356,5,B00003CXKT,"Of the two ""Star Wars"" prequels, this one is the better.  The critisism of Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin is unfounded: he plays the part as a deeply troubled young man. Not brought up as most young Jedi, he has ties to his mother that he can not shake.  Hayden does a brilliant job of bringing out Anakin's dark tendencies.  It is especially evident after his mother's death when he slaughters the Tuskens.  He also does a good job in his relationship to his mentor, Obi-Wan, he looks up to him as a father figure, and yet he feels like he is being held back.  He fits the part well, I think.

Ewan McGregor has grown well in his part as Obi-Wan, I loved him in Episode I and he is even better here.  He has managed to capture the character that Alec Guiness created almost 30 years ago.

While the duel with Dooku was not nearly as good as the Obi-Wan/Darth Maul duel Episode I, it was fun to see the legendary Yoda in action and Christopher Lee played his part to a ""T"".

Those who disliked the love story angle, must understand that Anakin's love for Padme is what contributed to his downfall.  It was a necessary part of the story.

The mystery part of the plot was great.  I loved seeing Obi-Wan in action.

I have been a Star Wars fan since the very beginning. I was 18 when the first one came out, and I have been waiting for the prequel trilogy for a long time. So far I have not been disappointed.",1114214400,,1417,4.262172284644195

Hayden Christiansen was the worst actor of the bunch. The very unbelieveable""love"" story was so painful to watch it made me almost embarrassed for the poor kid.

The actors look lost and confused most of the time because they are constantly behind blue screens.  The end battle looks like a cartoon, it looked like the actors were trapped in Toy Story world.  Another problem is the script, it is really lame, with lines like "" Sand is corse, but not like you, you are everything soft.""  its corny lines like this that make some scences laughable.  George lucas is probly the laziest dirctor of all time.  This film was not directed by George lucas it was directed by the good guys ofI.L.M Cause this movie is one big special effect.  Its sad to hear John Williams legendary score over this waste of a Star Wars film.  I hope Lucas trys a little harder with episode 3. Actually i pray.",1113523200,5,815,4.422818791946309
1312359,5,B00003CXKT,"It's one thing if you don't feel the prequels are good enough but how can you be against them being made? I don't get these conservative republican fans! What SW fan compains about NEW Star Wars films??? People don't appreciate Ep 2. However, I can sympathize with haters of Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. I do believe that it should and could have been much much better. The infantile Jar Jar pratically single handedly ruins the film for me and there was room for more action and less sitting around talking. But you can understand why Lucas wanted a more lighter intro to the series to contrast the dark events of Episode 3. Because if you think about it the whole premise of the prequels is dark: A good man turning into one of the most evil villians ever. One thing I missed in Episode One was the presence of a respectable Yoda. He was very misrepresented in that movie, he didn't even look like himself. But here, in Episode II, we get to see what Yoda was like as a master Jedi, rather than just the grasshopper-like mentor he was in the orignal trilogy.  In here Yoda is just a tad too CG and lacks much of the charm and character he had in the originals but when we finally see him use his lightsaber, which was for a lot of SW fans the most anticipated thing of the prequels, it makes the whole movie.  I believe that Yoda should have been a more central character in these prequels, rather than just sit around chillin' with Samuel L.  Of course judging from the trailer, we will get our share of classic Yoda scenes in Episode 3.  Moving on to other central characters... Samuel L. Jackson as jedi legend ""Mace Windu"", it is great to see Samuel in this trilogy but his charcter gets little screen time and even less action scenes. It is also good to see C3PO and R2D2 in these prequels, not only does it give the trilogy a much needed sense of familiarity, but it provides a few more likeable characters. My question though is why R2 couldn't fly in the other films??? Padme is very likeable being that she is played by the beautiful Natalie Portman. Anakin Skywalker is the hardest for people to accept, the trick is not to look at Darth Vader and picture Anakin, but to watch these movies as the begining and THEN look at Vader.  Yeah, Hadem might not be the best actor, but he does bring a sense of arrogance and anger that Anakin needed to be believeable. Obi Wan is the hardest character for me to grasp. I just pictured him to be completely different, not this humble guy who's afraid of action.  Anyways lets get into the storyline... The best thing about the prequels is that it enhances the original trilogy by setting it up, so to speak.  It explains how the stormtroopers came about (which is the main focusof this film) It shows the transformation of Luke's father to Darth Vader, and most importantly, it shows how a peaceful world of Jedi Knights was turned into an evil dictatorship that is the Empire.  You also get the backstory of the Emperor Palpatine who is the one who orcastrated the entire corruption.  My biggest complaint with this film, is that it should have been Episode 1 and Episode 2 should have been about The Clone Wars. Think about it, The Clone Wars is the most important part of the Trilogy and it is not really shown, this movie ends with the beganing of the war and the third installment begans with the war almost over. Basically we don't get to see the classic battles that should have been in this film.  But there is plenty to see in here, we get the first battle of the Stormtroopers, before they turn into the bad guys. We get the origin of Bobba Fett.  We get a few tight chase scenes and many lightsaber duels, yet not nearly enough lightsaber action as was expected.  We also get to see new planets like the world of raging storms and vast oceans and the red desert planet Geonosis with it's inhabitants of cricket like species.

Basically Episode II, while not ideal, is a very nice addition to the Star Wars Saga. Those who complain it is not as good as the original are right but who was expecting it to be??? Those who say it is weak and storyless are very wrong and not very perceptive.  Episode III: Revenge of the Sith looks to be the best out of the prequels by far and is already being called the greatest sci fi movie ever by critics!!! but Episode II: Attack of the Clones, should be honored as a great film as well.  Star Wars movies are some of the greatest films ever, no movie experience is like these films! So enjoy this one and just chill to the next episode......... 3 that is!!! Revenge of the Sith, May ?? 2005!!! Peace!!!",1113523200,3,4603,4.4051825677267376
1312360,5,B00003CXKT,"I can't help but puke over most of the people who whine and cry about the movie having important elements for Anakins fall to the darkside, such as the love story. Anakin in episode III falls to the darkside to save his loved ones (and because of some lies of sidious) alot of people say the plot is bad. Well you can go screw yourself, because after reading the Revenge of the Sith book, its quite possibly the most genius thing I've ever read. By the way, you shouldn't fully judge the prequel series untill you've finished watching all three of them, and all you Original Trilogy whores who can't stand the new changes , which uhh, are hardly anything but better FX and a more dramatic score at the end, and you will also come to realize why you see Haydens spirit instead of Sabastian Shaw (you would also know if you watched the commentary on the OT)overall , all 6 of the films are the greatest films together I have ever seen in my life, and if you think AOTC sucks , you need to be put in a rocket and launched towards the sun.",1113523200,2,1035,4.258883248730965
1312361,2,B00003CXKT,"Come on George Lucas, I'm sure you can do much better than feed us with this bloated, over-acted pathetic excuse of a film. I mean, anyone else helming this movie, and you might think...""hmm..good attempt"" but this is Lucas we're talking about, the man who gave us such classics as Star Wars 4,5,6 and Indiana Jones movies. I am very disappointed with the outcome of this saga, honestly. What makes it more painful is the fact that I loved Star Wars 4,5 and 6. I grew up on those movies... it was the ""Lord Of The Rings"" of my generation.

Years later, we get this...totally unnecessary prequels. The script is weak, there were many plot holes...the acting was bad, especially the romantic parts of the movie...that was laughable...me and my friends had a nice laugh at those parts, totally unrealistic and no chemistry at all. And what is up with Anakin aging like 10 years and Amidala looking like she hasn't aged a day? But that's a hiccup compared to the rest of the problems plaguing this movie. The effects were good though (hence the 2-star rating) but then again, we're in the 21st century and those effects were not groundbreaking, basically we've already seen it. George really has his work cut out for Revenge Of The Sith, I hope he doesn't blow that to dust too.

Sorry if I offended anyone, it is not my intention to belittle Star Wars, and I am definitely not a Star Wars hater...I'm just giving my honest views. Anyway, Star Wars Episode III will be released soon, and I sincerely hope it is more to the standard of 4,5,6 than 1 and 2.",1113436800,,1550,4.5321428571428575
1312362,3,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones was a decent film I thought. A few flaws to say the least.  Alot of plot holes and so-so acting. Hayden Christensen was somewhat annoying as Anakin (or as the other characters call him 'Annie').  I guess that was the point, our hero needed to be self-centered & arrogant .....which leads to wanting power, which leads to the dark side of the Force. Ewan Mcgregor was decent as Obi Wan I suppose, I think he nailed the Alec Guiness persona to a 't'.  Natalie Portman on the other.....delivered the same monotone dialogue as she did in Phantom Menace...........''Anakin, I won't let you give up your career for me'' blah blah, obviously  the Anakin/Padme romance was pure cheese...........

  Frank Oz,  Ian Mcdiarmid & Temeurea Morrison were a bit underused in their supporting roles.........and as for the villain of the film, we have the legend  Christopher Lee as Count Dooku (who's also the sith lord Darth Tyranus). Mind you, during viewing the film Lucas tries to trick the audience into thinking Dooku/Tyranus are 2 separate people (much like Palpatine/Darth Sidious).....................I thought the film was solid over all (the Jango Fett vs Obi Wan rain duel ruled)  unlike the lighsaber duels involing Anakin, Obi Wan, Yoda & Count Dooku.  Also, viewers must refrain from the Jar Jar Binks bashing (he's barely in AOTC)..........the film would've been better if there was more insight into the Anakin/Obi Wan friendship.........most of the time Anakin is 'dissing' him behind his back  ''He's holding me back'' etc.......R2D2 & C3PO were likeable as always.........and Boba Fett (as a kid) was annoying.....I hope my review helps",1113091200,,1661,5.111111111111111

1312462,5,B00003CXKT,"Okay, I didn't love Episode 1, but I don't think there was a solid plot to it and Lucas was just trying to introduce the characters. However, Episode II is great.

We get to see Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala fall in love, the Clone Wars begin, Anakin become darker after the death of his mother (which I think was the best acted and most powerful part of the film), and Chancellor Palpatine slide closer and closer to ultimate power over the Republic.

Most of the complaints you'll hear are from people that grew up watching the original trilogy, not people below 18. Lucas wrote this the same way that he wrote the first three, with cheesy dialogue and ""simplistic"" characters. With Star Wars, it is a fun time with underlying deep tones, but it is NOT the Godfather, Star Trek or other movie series made especially for adults. Almost all the complaints of bad acting, cheesy dialogue and simplistic characters could be applied to the original trilogy as well.

Ultimately a very good film. It's not the best movie in the series, so it should get a 4.5, but I couldn't dare give it a 4.",1112400000,10,1132,4.544117647058823
1312463,2,B00003CXKT,"The CGI effects, the creatures and the droids, the battle scenes as well as the planetary landscapes, are incredible, and that alone earns 2 stars from me.  But the characters are painfully 1-dimensional, and the acting is unbelievably bad for such a big-name project.  Some of the supporting characters are better - the most realistic performance, ironically, coming from the CGI-generated critter in the diner who pointed Obi-Wan to the missing planet - but the 3 ""stars"" of the story are just beyond artificial.  I never once believe them in their roles, as they recite their lines and go through their motions without the slightest conviction.  Which leads me to wonder, for the thousandth time, what it is about the Star Wars universe that inspires such fandom, because these characters have all the depth and complexity of wet tissue paper.  This movie is no exception - all atmosphere and eye-candy, scant plot, and virtually zero characterization.

1312465,5,B00003CXKT,"I must say I am mystified with the criticism of the newest chapters in this amazing series.  My kids, who did not see the first trilogy (4-6) when it came out, are simply nuts about this film.  They pull me into the living room, sit in my lap, and there is laughter, suspense, and questions begin.  I have watched it 15 times, and still have never felt bored by it.

Now we see the flaws of Anakin becoming evident, yea dominant as he slaughters for the sake of revenge.  But as a sci-fi world, this immensely adds to the picture of some alternate universe and time from our own.  Everything with the earlier films is densely consistent and adding to a whole that is slowly yet relentlessly revealed.  This is, in my humble opinion, some of the finest sci-fi that has ever been done, on film or in print.  If you can ""suspend your disbelief"", this is the greatest treat that modern media can offer.  The depth truly rivals that of Dune.

In this film, Anakin has matured and is chaffing under the yoke of his master, Obi-wan.  There is a question of talent - Anakin is a budding genius - but also of character and discipline in a newly dangerous political situation.  The republic is under attack by adversaries who are revealed as a shocking lack of vision by those representing the good side of the force.  Only Yoda understands the true import of what is happening, and as in the first trilogy, every single one of his utterances is pregnant with significance.

I don't mean to sound hokey - and my wife would laugh at my writing of this - but there is wisdom in all of this for those who desire to plumb its depths.  Only a young mind, perhaps, can truly understand its import:  the influence of talent and the fight to preserve the good, which is always threatened by uncontrolled anger and implacable hatred.  This is beautiful stuff, and my children understand it better than us adults.

Then, there are the themes in this, which are unique in the series.  Anakin and Padme are falling in love, perhaps predestined in an intensity they cannot control.  The Jedi, too, appear not as brilliant (and perpetually lucky) improvisational fighters, but as an organised force in what may be their final battle.  The scale is wonderfully vaste, even breathtaking.  This battle is one of the best of the entire series.

Then there are the enemies of the good side of the Force, with mysterious facets of their plans uncovered but not yet fully comprehended.  It keeps the pulse of tension going in a truly remarkable way.  I do not think there is a better series of films anywhere, in terms of execution, technique, and devloping themes.

This is some of the best sci-fi I have ever seen, particularly in an era where special effects trump depth of theme.  I admit that it takes an unusual and child-like mind to enjoy it, but if you ""get it"", there is no better entertainment experience available anywhere.  It is first rate.  Absolutely.

If the graphics are ""adavanced"" looking, then they don't support the time in the film. Attack of the clones uses alot of computer graphics, i admit that. However, it's not obvious.

It sounds like the title of a B-list horror film, like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or something cheesy like that.  Sadly, this movie wasn't meant to be a farce.  George Lucas was being serious when he made this garbage.  The story is slow.  The plot is unengaging.  Lucas seems more concerned with his so-called ""plot"" than in actual entertaining and storytelling.  This is why the first two (and possibly the third) prequels suck.  There is too much senate crap in this episode, and too many new characters for those who aren't familiar with Star Wars.  I've been a Star Wars fan for most of my life, and even I had trouble following along.  All the evil characters have two or three different names (Count Dooku, Darth Tyrannus, etc.), and there are too many characters to care about all of them.  The acting is terrible, almost laughably bad.  Samuel L. Jackson is among the worst.  It's almost like he's playing the role of the Black Jedi, strictly for racial diversity.  And speaking of diversity, what's the deal with Jango Fett and Boba Fett being Polynesian?  That's unacceptable.  Does Lucas feel like he has to include every race in his movies?  Will the next Jedi be Hispanic?  They should never have showed either of the Fett's faces in the movie.  You just don't picture a Poly under that mask and armor.  That really annoyed me, because it's such a blatant attempt to diversify the cast.  I'm glad they both die.  Hayden Christiansen is a very bad actor.  Lucas likes to cast newcomers for some reason, probably so he can take credit for discovering the next big thing.  Sorry George, you failed with Jake Lloyd and again with Hayden.  Natalie Portman, who is usually a good actress, was really bad in AOTC.  There were a few entertaining parts in the movie (Yoda's fight with Dooku, the arena scene, the chase in the city) but I wouldn't watch the whole thing again for a long time.  I have the DVD (I got it as a gift) and have yet to watch the whole thing straight through.  That's a bad commentary.  I'm not a Star Wars hater.  I'm just being honest.

I have read the reviews on line here at Amazon.com about ""Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,"" some I agree with, others I don't. I remember when this movie was in the theaters, in fact at the theater I was at, I was the very first person in line to purchase my tickets and I purchased two tickets each for the first three showings of this movie for myself and my date. Both she and I agree that this was worthy of the title of ""Star Wars"" and we also both agree had Mr. Lucas stayed as writer & executive producer that the movie would have been even better.

George Lucas is a great storyteller, creating great characters and a great adventure to watch those characters grow within the film, but he is no director. As I have viewed many of the movies Lucas has directed, from ""THX 1138,"" ""American Graffiti,"" ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,"" and ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,"" and it became apparent to me that Lucas is no director as his camera angles are trivial and not very imaginative - much different from the collaboration between he and Steven Spielberg in the ""Indiana Jones"" movies. That collaboration really works and I bet had Lucas asked Spielberg to direct his saga he would have agreed - after all Spielberg is directing ""Indiana Jones 4"" as he did all the pervious ""Indiana Jones"" movies. Still this was a magnificent movie.

Like the film that precedes this one, ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,"" this story opens with a focus on Padm&eacute; Amidala - though this time it is not her planet Naboo that is threatened, but she herself and Obi-Wan & Anakin are assigned by Palpatine to keep her safe. The investigation leads Obi-Wan & Anakin on a futuristic police chase through metropoliptic planet of Coruscant where the whole planet is a city, which leads the duo to separate. Obi-Wan is sent to investigate the assassination attempts on Padm&eacute;, while Anakin acts as Padm&eacute;'s bodyguard. While investigating the assassination attempts, Obi-Wan is led to another Dark Jedi where he is captured. Anakin & Padm&eacute; go off to find Anakin's mother as the two grow closer and develop a romance. During the search for his mother we see Anakin drift toward the Dark Side and we see his connection to the Lars family seen in ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope."" Anakin & Padm&eacute; discover Obi-Wan is in trouble and decide to notify the Jedi Council and go off to rescue him but they too are captured, and what results is a massive battle that puts the Battle of Hoth and the Battle of Endor to shame as we see a team of Jedi take on a ""Remember the Alamo"" battle that climaxes in seeing why Yoda is ""THE"" Jedi Master of all the Jedi.

This movie was great and much darker than ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,"" as well as ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" & ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,"" and rivals ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" in its dark storyline. The acting, writing, musical score, special effects, costumes, cinematography, etc were all great and only the directing was sub-par (but than Lucas is not a director). This movie is worth paying thousands of dollars for, just to see Yoda fight alone. But like all the ""Star Wars"" movies this should be watched in widescreen mode to get the full picture and in a home theater atmosphere to take full advantage of the sound - a must for all movie fans.",1110931200,3,3426,4.503215434083601
1312559,4,B00003CXKT,"First off, only buy the DVD, because the VHS does not have commentary.  This sucks without commentary due to the awful screenplay George Lucas and Jonathan Hales concocted and Hayden Christensen's acting.  I did however think the visual effects were good.  With the commentary you have no horrible acting by Christensen and avoid Lucas and Hales' screenplay.  But, I must say I hated Christensen's acting, Lucas and Hales' screenplay more than I liked more then I liked Rob Coleman, Pablo Helman, John Knoll and Ben Snow's visual effects.  By the way, I normally do not go for commentaries.  The commentary includes interviews with Lucas [Writer/Executive Producer/Director/Editor (no credit)], Rick McCallum [Producer], Ben Burtt [Sound Designer/Supervising Sound Editor/Editor], Rob Coleman [Animation Director: ILM], Pablo Helman [Visual Effects Supervisor], John Knoll [Visual Effects Supervisor] and Ben Snow [Visual Effects Supervisor: ILM].

1312560,2,B00003CXKT,"The biggest problem with the Star Wars series is the way in which Lucas abandons his characters; not to mention his fans!  Take for instance the characters Darth Maul and Boba Fett.  Two characters that were not very established but still added a sence of mystery and enjoyment to his movies.  What does lucas do?  He destroys them in the cheepest worst possible way and leaves you flat with nothing but Jar Jar to fill your senses.  Directior/writers should know that if you are luckey enough to establish a cool character in a movie his death should also be great.  The writing was so poor in the Phantom Menance and Attack of the Clones it was hard to fathom?  Lucas's only response to the fans complaint's was ""The movies are about heroes not anti-hero's"".  Well thats fine, write a better movie then!  The Empire Strikes Back is by far the best of the Star Wars series and it is the only film Lucas didn't direct!  A new Hope is good.  Return of the Jedi and the first two arn't worth mentioning in my opinion.  How did something so good go so bad?  The battle droids arn't very cool looking/interesting ""Revenge of the Mighty Ducks""!  The arena creatures don't add anything interesting to the movie.  The love scenes are too long and in my opinion is what made the movie fail completly.  Jango's death was scripted/directed poorley!  Darth Maul was more interesting then Count Doukoo.  The fight with Yoda after he draws his lightsaber was silly to say the least.  I really hope RotS brings back the Star Wars I became a fan of!",1110412800,2,1534,4.553113553113553

If only Lucas didn't spend so much money selling out to special effects, then maybe he could have hired some decent actors. The only good actor in this movie is Ewan McGregor. Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen (or however the hell you spell this acting school dropout's name) couldn't act to save their lives, which is unfortunate since they happen to be the main characters. I give this movie credit for the lightsaber action scenes (Yoda, I'm looking at you), but even they are too few and far between. Again, maybe Lucas would have had some time to include more of what was good about the movie if he didn't waste the entire movie with scenes showing Anakin and Padme running around in a field playing grabass the whole time. In short, this movie would be good if they spent their resources in the right places (better acting and more action scenes that made the Star Wars franchise famous.) The new movies are very disappointing, to me anyway. I did actually like Episode I. Hopefully Episode III can restore the series to its former glory.

Three stars (and I'm being generous here).",1109289600,,1266,4.754545454545455
1312673,3,B00003CXKT,"Overall Grade, a 3.75.

I was one of the many Star Wars fans disapointed with Episode I and it's inconsistancies/poor acting/over-emphasis on special effects.  I went in the theatre long ago, with significantly less expectations than I went in with Episode I, and I came out quite satisfied with Episode II.

First off, and I think most fans will agree, less Jar Jar made the movie significantly more bearable.  I just wanted anyone to take a lightsabre to Jar Jar and end us of all our misery, I really hope Chewbacca eats him in Episode III.  However, Hayden Christensen's acting and cheesy lines didn't help any.  The whole Skywalker/Padme love thingy just made me sick and wished for the action scenes to quickly make their entrance... who ever thought Darth Vader was the submissive type?

It was nice to see Ewan McGregor again to return as Kenobi.  He was probably the only cool thing in Episode I.  He did fairly well in Episode II and hope he continues his faily good acting in Episode III when it comes out.  Christopher Lee was an excellent choice for Darth Tryannus, although I still think his better acting was in Lord of the Rings.

I'd have to say the plot wasn't too bad, it made things clearer, however, we still know that Chancellor Palpatine is... uh... Emperor Palpatine.  I thought the Boba Fett clone connection was somewhat cool since we all love Boba Fett.  Other than that, the action sequences were more feasible and entertaining to watch, it's not very exciting to see a battle droid fall, so it was nice to see some human bad guys for a change.

And yes, I thought the Yoda lightsabre thing was cool... I laughed the whole time... who ever thought Yoda had it in him?

All in all, not bad at all.  But Lucas better get his crap together since the original three are still 10x better than his newest editions to the SW saga.",1108944000,2,1851,4.5636363636363635

cg crapfest movies are force fed(go on eat up, it's star wars of course you'll love it) and trudge along with jagged edges.

The Big Flaw in the Movie is the Chase Scene. i thought the Chase Scene with the bounty hunter was going too far. i think some of it should had been edited out and kept for deleted Scenes. I loved all the planets, i loved the battles, and i loved Count Dooku. He truly was a great enemy and truly a wise apprentice of Sidious. He is more powerful than Maul and makes Maul look like Mary Poppins. I would say the Besides the Flaw of the Chase Scene, i did not like how Hayden protrayed Anakin Skywalker. I think he cried too much and he should had been protrayed more innocent as he was when he was a boy. I think he looked too young in this with that hair cut. I liked the fact that lucas shows the love between Padme and Anakin but i think he went overboard with the whole love aspect. I think some of the love scenes should had been written by a female writer. Nothing against Lucas, but i think women write better passionate scenes then men do. Im sorry but thats what i think. Besides those three flaws, i think the film was well receieved but i still like Episode 1 much more.

1312678,2,B00003CXKT,"IMO, this is the worst Star Wars film and I don't even think it's close. This one did not feel like a Star Wars movie - it felt like a cheap knock-off and a cross between elements of Blade Runner and any number of video games

It seems that Lucas went out of his way to make the most outrageous characters he could, just for the sake of it. The large, flying insects, who communicated with the sound of clicks or the noise you can make by maneuvering your tongue against the roof of your mouth, were a distraction at best. There was way too much action that was clearly made in front of a green screen - especially the two lead characters getting trapped in the factory. The whole clone story-line was not good. Most of the dialogue was lousy - some of it embarrassing. Anakin came up across as a whiney teenager. Natalie Portman's entire acting across the three films should come up for more scrutiny. The ""Roman Colosseum"" scenes seemed to be all about trying to see how many lightsabers we can show at the same time. And C3PO's sole role seemed to be for ""comic"" relief. ""I'm trapped and I can't get up."" Really?

Count Dooku? Sounds like a character from Sesame Street.

I haven't even mentioned Samuel L. Jackson yet. Do I need to? His acting is the same here as it is in virtually all his other films: angry, no zest, and quite unappealing. He should not have been anywhere near a Star Wars film.

I know some folks think Ep. I was worse, but I would take the many good elements of that film over Ep. II even if that did mean having a larger helping of Jar Jar Binks.

After originally giving it 1 star, I gave it 2 stars out of 5 mostly because of the Star Trek fanatics who think their franchise is better. I thought about it and even the worst Star Wars films are better than MOST Star Trek films. Have you seen Star Trek: The Motion Picture? Major snoozefest. At least the Star Wars prequels had some things to like and they were not boring. Within the Star Wars umbrella of films, this is the worst one, but when comparing it to other films, it's at least worth a look.",1105056000,2,2080,4.282442748091603
1312679,1,B00003CXKT,"Apparently there is yet another movie in this long-winded series forthcoming.  On the very, very remote chance that George Lucas will ever come across this review, I must offer him a piece of advice: don't make it.  You have already inflicted enough pain on us and enough humiliation on yourself.  There was a revival of Star Wars nerds in 1997 when Lucas greedily rereleased his dumb trilogy with 'updated effects,' and again in 2001 when Lucas started (gasp) making more Star Wars movies, on the basis that what we already had was an 'incomplete story.' It was a painful time, especially when that idiot with his face painted red and black started showing up on our magazine covers.

The second film of the post-millenial revival is nothing less than a nightmare.  The computer generated effects are completely uninteresting, the actors are bored, embarassed and poorly rehearsed (never have I seen such woodenness in a major hollywood film), the direction is sloppy and incompetent, the script is a mishmash of soap opera and half-baked pretension, and there is a distinct monotony and repetativeness to everything that takes place.  The utter lack of imagination in a science fiction film is always the kiss of death, and in this case it should be a fairly obvious signal to George Lucas: this premise has already been stretched much farther than it was ever meant to.

I will try to give you an idea of how bad this movie is.  You know that pathetic Star Wars rip-off called 'Space Mutiny' that got ruthlessly torn apart on MST3K, and is known as one of the absolute worst excuses for Science Fiction ever committed to celluloid?  The one with the spaceship that is obviously a factory, and futuristic costumes that are obviously from the 80s?  Well, I would rather watch that than 'Attack of the Clones.' The actors were more enthusiastic about their characters and the action was more exciting.  Now, Mr. Lucas, if you have read this far, take a look at 'Space Mutiny,' consider what I've written here, and weep at the monstrosity you have created.  After that, retire from the film business.",1104796800,12,2099,4.832402234636872
1312680,1,B00003CXKT,"The sequel trilogy to the original Star Wars was eagerly anticipated around the entire universe.

 Most people were sure they were about to experience another thrilling and electrifying trilogy which would be remebered for years to come.

 However, that nervous awaiting turned to disappoint when the first of the new trilogy, The Phantom Menace were in theaters in 1999. And although the movie went on to gross more than $431M in the US, it never quite possessed the ""magic"" the original films had back in the 70's and 80's.

 Time passed by and it was 2002. The second chapter in the new trilogy was to be released on May 16th, and moviegoers hoped that maybe, just maybe George Lucas would get it right.

 WRONG. Once again, the movie turned to Computer Graphics over dialogue and emotion. Huge battle scenes involving the clone army versus the droids instead of Anakin Skywalker's journey to the Dark Side. It missed the huge plot-twist that was in the Empire Strikes Back when Darth Vader reveals to Luke that he is his father. All in all, the movie just wasn't the one the fans expected.

 Now, I'm not saying the movie was horrible. Maybe our expectations were too high. Maybe George Lucas tried to hard to exceed the movies he made 30 years ago.

 The movie leaves some promising stories and things to look forward to. For example, the duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan and the rise of the empire are some to name. Also, it will be interesting to see the instinct of Anakin and his deep emotions. Does he love Padme or his mother more?

 Many hope the third time is the charm. And I certainly hope the last movie of the trilogy, The Revenge of the Sith can fulfill the dreams of die-hard Star Wars fans as well as the common moviegoers.",1104451200,6,1742,4.577419354838709
1312768,3,B00003CXKT,"I was about five or six years old when ""Star Wars"" (the movie nobody but George Lucas calls ""A New Hope"") came out. I saw it at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C., which was then (and may still be) the biggest movie house anywhere in the Metro Area, which is probably the equivalent of watching the Cubs win the World Series at Wrigley, if you're a Cubs fan. I mention this because unless you are old enough to remember seeing the original Trilogy in the theater, popcorn and all, you simply have no idea how much awe and wonder they inspired. Jackson's very well received ""Lord of the Rings"" doesn't even come close. I remember vividly how the audience hissed...yes, actually hissed, when Darth Vader strode onto the screen, and how they cheered when the Death Star blew up. You would have thought they collectively won the lottery. Hell, they applauded the ""best boy"" when the credits rolled. Simply put, ""Star Wars"" was THE movie of my generation. Which was why ""Episode I"" struck me as such a horrendous, cruel disappointment. Gut-wrenching. Mind-numbing. Skull-cracking. Or, to quote my friend Matt, ""We waited 16 years for THIS?""

Needless to say, I showed up to ""Episode II"" with considerably lowered expectations. I am relieved to say that these expectations were met, and exceeded, by ""Attack of the Clones"", which in many ways is the movie Ep I should have been.

""Clones"" has many of the faults of ""Phantom Menace."" The pacing is off, the first hour tends to drag, some of the dialogue comes out like chewed marbles, and Lucas once again bludgeons the viewer with too many special effects backdrops and overlong chase sequences, which do nothing for the plot and are simply an excuse to show off.

Still, the movie succeeds. Namely because:

1) Ewan McGregor finally gets something to do besdies look intrepid and say ""Yes, master.""

2) Natalie Portman, who got saddled with the very worst of Ep I's bad dialogue, gets better treatment here. Plus, you know, that hot outfit. Ahem.

3) We all wanted to see Boba Fett again, and we got him, times two.

4) We all wanted to see the stormtroopers again and not those silly metal duckling droids. We got millions of 'em.

5) We all wanted to see a big battle with lots of Jedi. Check.

6) We all wanted to see Yoda kick some space butt. Ditto Samuel L. Double check.

7) I really wanted to see somebody, anybody, slaughter a bunch of those raggedy-ass sandpeople. Kudos to you, young Skywalker.

In short, this movie, despite all of its flaws, delivers the goods. I would have liked to see more of Chancellor Palpatine and Lord Tyranus, and more on the burgeoning relationship between the future emperor and his future right hand man, Anakin, but you can't win 'em all.

Let's face it. This series is superficial, almost a cartoon, that puts SPFX first and everything else third, with nothing in second. But it was a great improvement over Part I. If Part III continues this curve upwards, who knows? The nerd in me is already trembling at the thought of seeing good ol' Darth Vader again. I'm ready to hiss.",1104278400,5,3068,4.661111111111111

If you've seen Episode I and you thought that was bad, you haven't seen anything yet. George Lucas's antics to try to get this movie to be worth watching can't even be laughed at; their hideousness makes you want to cry.

""I'm quite beside myself"" is another retarded line by the same droid when his head is pulled alongside his body.

Another thing (and this one really stands out) is the movie's disgustingly awful acting. Hayden Christensen was chosen to play the young version of good old Darth Vader... but WHY?!?! He is the worst actor I have ever seen in my entire lifetime (besides Jake Lloyd).

The storyline is pretty bad too, and the only part I half-like during the movie is the climactic battle that starts the Clone Wars.

2.  The story.  Padme` is being hunted by a bounty hunter, the seperatists are preparing to go to war, and Anakin falls in love with Padme`.  The first two are okay, but the last one is awful.  The love lines are so putrid I can barely hold myself back from destroying the TV.  The acing done by Hayden and Natalie in all the 'gag'..er...'love' scenes is atrocious!  Then there's more of the stupid ""chosen one"" trash about Anakin.

3.  The script.  The lines said by C-3P0 such as ""This is such a drag."" and ""I'm quite beside myself.""  While R2-D2 is dragging his head with a rope and then pulling alongside C-3P0's headless body, are without question, the STUPIDEST lines EVER written in Hollywood!!

Anyway, the film.

Acting - wooden and stilted (see Natalie Portman, and Haydn Christizzzzzzz, sorry drifted off there thinking about them)

Love interest - ridiculous, Skywalker tells Amidala he's just massacred an entire village and she just pats him on the back and goes ""there, there dear, never mind""

The payoff - an overblown battle between 2 CGI armies you really don't care about. Buy the Clone wars game. Same thing but you get to control the armies

Oh god no!!! - The deathstar plans are there. Why am I not surprised. For a secret battlestation, the plans certainly travelled round the galaxy a lot

Plot holes - Take your pick. My favourite is the clones were ordered 10 years ago by Coutn Dooku, Jango Fett is the source of all the clones and is working for the bad guys and no-one says, ""hang on a minute, shouldn't we do a bit of checking around before we use them"" Nope, they just use this conveniently placed army with no thought to how it got there. So much for the wisdom of Yoda

Battle Logic - None, why would you send 200 jedi to their death to save 2 and a senator. Nope, you'ld start with the orbital bombardment and glass the planet and then leave sipping tea and congratulating yourself on killing the leadership of the seperatists in one fell swoop, by the cost of only 3 lives.

Which leads me to the next point of mashed logic. Why are all the jedis made into Generals? Sure there is no standing army/navy in the Republic but there must be someone, somewhere in the galaxy, more qualified by having actually led men into battle, at least once.

Lightsabres - Yoda vs Dooku fighting in the dark. Glowsticks in the basement of a nightclub have given me more thrills

and why not Darth Dooku, just Count....hmmm.and don't get me started on Matrix-move Yoda (available in toystores near you soon)

and speaking of sabre fighting. The difference between the original starwars and the new starwars sabre fights. In the original they were trying to kill each other, in the new ones, they're just bashing sticks.

It has no redeeming features apart from freeing me of my love of starwars and making me sell all my old starwars toys in disgust.

And it's not because it's a starwars film, As a starwars film it's awful, as a film on it's own, it's awful. It's just plain rubbish.

1312775,1,B00003CXKT,"Lucas is on record as saying that he always envisioned Star Wars as a kid's adventure.  Fair enough. But the audience base of Star Wars grew up, and they require more substance.  I, for one, never had any great sense of what is at stake here, either from the characters or the plot.  The effects serve to almost completely overwhelm what little plot exists, and as another reviewer noted Lucas manages to coax even the most accomplished actors into having all the depth of wooden planks from the lumber store.

Just think about it for a moment.  If you grew up with Star Wars like I did, we knew long before even ""Return of the Jedi"" about all the major back-story events that Lucas told us at the time and through the movies.  Anakin Skywalker fell to the dark side and became Darth Vader (and fell into a lava pit in a battle with Obi-Wan hence the life-support black armor and helmet).  The Old Republic fell during the Clone Wars and the Jedi were all but wiped out as Vader helped hunt down and destroy them. The backstory we dreamed about was a shell waiting to be filled with more details and certainly sounded much more dramatic.

And now, what precisely has the first two films given us in terms us fleshing out the skeletal figure of what we already knew?  Jar-Jar Binks soaking up screen time solely for the sake of keeping younger kids entertained? Anakin pilots racing pods as a child?  Chase scenes galore?  Anakin falls because his mother was killed by Tusken Raiders?  Jango Fett was the template for Imperial Stormtroopers (who have the worst aim in cinematic history)?  Count Dooku is a bad man who was once Yoda's student?

It's like we still have the open-ended backstory, and we're watching all the points being connected with seriously underdeveloped filler that slathers on special effects.

It's bad enough that 3PO and R2 are in these's movies, but do we need all the stupidly obvoius one liners from 3PO?  Damn that was retarded.

I could go on and on, but I'll spare you all. This is a classic example of a perfectly good story being f'ed up to make 8 year olds laugh.

1312917,2,B00003CXKT,"This movie is ultimately better on DVD because you can skip to the parts that are good, and ignore the 1 hour and 20 minutes of drab acting and poor dialogue that this film is laced with.

This movie resembles a cartoon in many ways with real live actors often seeming out of place in the back drop of what looks like an animated frame.

The premise is simple, and I've been reading many reviews which say they're confused as to the plot.  It's easy.  Palpatine (Sideous) has taken over the clone army (soon to be main forces of the Empire).

The Chancellor also has special emergency powers, so his word is final and the Senate is now totally powerless.  The Jedi fight the Trade Federation (and other members of the Separatists Group), making their numbers more and more depleted.

Eventually, the Separatists will be destroyed, the Jedi's numbers will be minimal, and the clone army will be at it's strongest, leaving the environment perfect for Palpatine to reveal himself as Sideous, make himself the Emperor, and have Anakin at his side to polish off the Jedi, the last remaining threat to him.  Make sense?

I'm taking May 19, 2005 off to see episode III, but my hopes are not very high.  Episode I, II, and VI have been sub-par.  TESB and ANH are the best movies in this series.",1100649600,2,1286,4.547826086956522

My sincerest apologies to George Lucas, whose creativity has given me endless hours of entertainment, but even though I consider this a good film, I don't find it to be a great one.  Aside from the romance, I also found it to be a bit slow.

1312921,5,B00003CXKT,"""STAR WARS Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"" continues the saga of how Anakin Skywalker (played here by an excellent Hayden Christensen) became Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones in the upcoming and final installment ""STAR WARS Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith"" and the original trilogy and played by David Prowse, but James Earl Jones is probably the only well-known actor who plays Darth Vader). Ten years have passed since Anakin (Jake Lloyd in ""STAR WARS Episode I: The Phantom Menace"") was rescued from slavery on Tatooine by Qui Gon-Jinn (Liam Neeson, ""Schindler's List"", etc.), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor in Episodes I, II and III, Sir Alec Guiness in Episodes IV, V and VI) and Padme Amidala (a lovely and excellent Natalie Portman). Padme (aka Amidala) is threatened by a mysterious assassin, prompting Anakin and Obi-Wan to protect her. Anakin, however, is bent on protecting her himself, while Obi-Wan tries to find the would-be assassin. At a secluded spot, Anakin confesses his love for Amidala, who gently rebuffs him because she knows that they can never be together. There are other concerns for them, though: the  mysterious Count Dooku (a perfectly villainous Christopher Lee, looking better than ever) is plotting with the mysterious Sith lord Darth Sidious (actor unknown to me...yet, as you don't see his face, but it could be Ian McDiarmid, who played the evil Emperor Palpatine in Episode VI and resurfaces as a Supreme Chancellor in Episodes I and II) to...I won't spoil it. Those of you who've seen it, keep it to yourself. The action scenes are well-executed, particularly the climactic fight between Dooku and Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz, who also did it in Episodes I, IV, V and V, as well as the upcoming Episode III). The scene where Anakin breaks down completely should've been extended, but it's all right as it is. The romance scenes should have also been extended, but George knows why he didn't. Here, Anakin is starting to turn to the Dark Side, but he still has a sense of humanity. The end leaves you screaming for Episode III to be out in theaters already, but George is a master at making great movies (also see the Indiana Jones trilogy, fourth one in the works, which he wrote and produced in collaboration with Steven Spielberg, another master at making great films). Rated PG for sci-fi action violence.",1099958400,4,2353,4.897243107769423

1313057,4,B00003CXKT,"In 2002, George Lucas released his fifth installment of the ""Star Wars"" saga that began 25 years earlier.  Entitled ""Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones"", this second prequel takes up the story ten years following the events that occurred in the previous film, ""Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace"".  Having spent the past ten years as an apprentice jedi, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and his teacher Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are assigned to provide protection to the former queen, now senator from Naboo, Padm Amidala (Natalie Portman), following an attempted assassination immediately after her ship lands on the planet of Coruscant, the capitol of the Republic.  Senator Amidala has gone to Coruscant to express her opposition to the creation of an army for the Republic, which has come under threat from several break-away worlds & organizations that have organized themselves into the rival Federation.  After another attempted assassination on Senator Amidala that includes a daring chase through the densely populated Coruscant, Yoda (voice of Frank Oz) orders Obi-Wan to investigate the source of the assassination attempts and orders Anakin to escort Senator Amidala back to Naboo for her own protection.  However, her assistant, the ever-annoying Jar Jar Binks (voice of Ahmed Brett), remains behind to represent Naboo on Senator Amidala's behalf in the Republic's Senate.  There, after being easily swayed by Supreme Chancellor Cos Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), Jar Jar asks the Senate to grant Chancellor Palpatine increased powers.  In the meantime, Obi-Wan makes some starting discoveries regarding the missing planet of Kamino, where he meets Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) and his son Boba (Daniel Logan), and also on the planet of Geonosis, where he meets Count Dooku (Christopher Lee).  Also in the meantime, Anankin and Padm get to spend some private time on Naboo, but dark dreams about his mother, Shmi Skywalker (Pernilla August), drive Anakin (with Padm at his side) to return to Tattooine where they meet her husband Cliegg Lars (Jack Thompson).  However, events and fighting on Geonosis become the crux and most exciting parts of the film.

Visually entertaining thanks to great cinematography and special effects, ""Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones"" was an improvement over its most immediate predecessor, ""Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace"", but still demonstrated the same types of problems as its predecessor with script, acting and direction.  Having become distrustful of letting anyone other than himself write and direct his films, George Lucas maintained absolute control over the writing, production and direction of ""Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones"", with the small exception of obtaining screenplay writing assistance from Jonathan Hales.  Though Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin Skywalker was a vast improvement over that of Jake Lloyd in ""Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace"", Christensen's portrayal was rather wooden and not particularly engaging.  At least the still-annoying appearances of Jar Jar Binks were greatly limited from ""Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace"". The best performances in ""Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones"" were from Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid and Christopher Lee.  Temuera Morrison's portrayal of Jango Fett, though somewhat narrow, was entertaining.

The most memorable scenes in the film include the opening scenes, the chase through Coruscant buildings, Kamino, the sand people, the Obi-Wan's fight over Geonosis, the Geonosis stadium, Yoda's arrival on Geonosis, the elaborate battle and Yoda with Count Dooku.  Other memorable characters in the film include Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), Capt. Typho (Jay Laga'aia), Watto (voice of Andrew Secombe), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels).  Overall, though somewhat problematic, I rate ""Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones"" with a reluctant 4 out of 5 stars.  Hopefully the third film to be released in 2005 will be better.",1099267200,4,3982,5.426256077795786

1313061,1,B00003CXKT,"""Good call, my young padawan learner!"" Terrible, isn't it. Some of the worst dialogue ever recorded for film pollutes both Episodes I and II of the STAR WARS franchise. Most of the acting is dreadful too, even when performed by actors of note. Hmmm, what is the problem here? There's got to be a common factor. Hey I know! It's Lucas, isn't it! It's all down to Lucas, that self-styled sage of modern film-making. If George Lucas is a talented film maker, I'm Dean Martin. This film is awful, a bloated cartoon with the odd human appearance. When I was young, before I was even a teenager, I used to wonder what Anakin Skywalker would be like. He would be, I was convinced, charismatic, daredevil, reckless yes, but he would be fun. We would love Anakin Skywalker, and it would make his descent into darkness all the more heartbreaking. Well Hayden Christensen is not my idea of Anakin Skywalker. Sure, if I wanted a six foot long plank of wood to build a new shelf with, yes, I may have popped down to the local DIY store and purchased some Hayden Christensen from the timber yard. This boy is not an actor. I was embarrassed for him, watching him trying to act. But I was angry with Lucas for casting him in the first place. Tell me, how does a director take an actor with the screen presence and talent of Sam Jackson, and turn him into another plank of wood? But then, Lucas did the same with Liam Neeson, in the previous instalment of nonsense, so what should we expect. George Lucas may be various things, a brilliant marketeer, a man who knows how to make serious amounts of cash, but a film-maker of talent, he ain't. He's no director. He's certainly no screenwriter, as this film continually proves. He clearly can't coach actors properly. And his story-telling ability, and I don't care what anyone says, is utterly suspect. So what has he got? NOTHING, except he helped make the original STAR WARS films. We watch these prequel films because we loved the originals so much, (quick aside: I still can't believe Lucas f####d up the ending of ROTJ, that is unforgivable) NOT because they themselves are any good. Don't doubt that. If these films were not prequels to the other much loved films, they would be regarded as the biggest turkeys of the last 10 years. George Lucas has to be the most arrogant film maker of all time, to think he had even a quarter of the talent to bring the prequels to life. His friends such as Speilberg and Coppola must cringe when they watch Episodes I and II. George, your lack of talent make me angry and any film making ability you once had has long since atrophied. In the name of God, involve better film makers than yourself for the making of Episode III. We all know you've got Speilberg's phone number. Oh, how Peter Jackson must be laughing at you.",1098662400,38,2797,4.518737672583827
1313062,5,B00003CXKT,"Episode II, Attack of the clones is a continuation of Lucas's great story telling. Great movies today can be appreciated when they appeal to both the young and old . Films like Aladdin and Shek are great because they both on the surface appeal to children but  also contain many elements that appeal to adults. The Star Wars sagas aim to do the same with limition of live action which Lucas has tried to overcome with CG.Today the Lord of the Rings has done the same. I believe most people get so wrapped up in the exterior, intended for quick visual entertainment, that they miss out on the superior plot and twist in the film. And yes the new films do have some inner plots and political messages. Remember, Lucas is working with a film where we know the ending so the interest must be in the human  messages the movies are relaying. As we see Anakin go though his trials we parallel Lukes choices and we see where Anakin fails - Lukes overcomes and Succeeds.(sins of the fathers) Intend of looking at the inconsistances between the movies, we should be noticing its plot,the manipulation by the sith to draw Anakin to the dark side. The Sith plot the capture,torure and death of his mother to bring out the anger that as the film progress move him closer and closer to the edge.(A result shown in his murderous rampage of the sandpeople.) They bring Anakin and Armdala together to later break them apart to get the emotional responds that will later draw him to the dark side.  We will probabily learn that the Sith are manipulating his emotions and causing him to act as errational as he is acting. They are surely effecting the minds of even Master Yoda when he can not sense or see the dark side of the force operating right in front of him. Star War is a political drama that mirrors how even today goverments manipulate events to achieve their own goals. In these films we must understand that they are meant for viewing by everyone. So enjoy the sillness of Ja Ja Binks and the ewoks, marvel at the action of the Jedi and Storm Troopers , and learn and be entertained by the plot twist  and messages that George Lucas aims at the older audiences. And when the day is over remember ,they are only movies and you are hard pressed to find better story telling than this.",1098576000,12,2276,4.47710843373494

Ok, first watch Attack of the Clones.  Watch the part where Anakin and Padme show up at the Lars's residents.  If you notice, C-3PO is there.  Now, watch as C-3PO show Anakin and Padme to Owen Lars and introduces them.  Now, we all know that Lars has owned C-3PO for a couple of months so you would think that Lars would recognize C3P0 if he saw him.

Now, watch episode IV.  Fast foward to where the Jawas try to sell C-3PO to Owen Lars.  Owen has know idea who C-3PO is.  Ok kidies and adults, lets do the math now.  Yep, you guessed it.  Mr Lucas has droped the ball and do not try to make any excuses either.  Unless by some terrible accident that happens to Owen and Beru, Lucas has dropped the ball.

The movie in itself was horrible.  When I went to see Attack of the Big Boners in the theater, people were laughing at the bad dialogue, bad acting, bad everything.  You would think we were watching a comedy I tell yah.  Only people who have not been brain washed by Lucas would relise that this pile of steaming dog poo that was thrown out into oncoming traffic is horrid.

And could you please make his dark side a little more subtle, honestly, the stupid outbursts that he has are so ridiculous, and Padme would hate him for it. And all of the things that happen in the movie are forced.  Don't even get me started on the dialogue.  It really is some of the worst dialogue on screen...""Oh he's not a jedi, he's just a padawan learner""  ""I hate sand..."" This is all ridiculous.  Can we get some subtlety please!!!  Anakin should have been more of a Han Solo character...A playful but rough on the edges guy who doesn't play by the rules...And rather than having all of these outbursts, he should hold all of his emotions in until they explode.  He should be the product of extreme repression.  Also, its a beautiful movie visually, but the special effects often look cartoonish.  I have more complaints with this movie but I won't get into them...Ultimately, there is no humanity and no emotion in this movie, it is all manufactured to fill in the blanks.

 Set ten years after TMP, a now older Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is a Jedi Apprentice under Obi Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor)Summoned again to protect Senator Padme Amedala (Natalie Portman).

  The movie goes through not only an investigation to uncover an attempt on the Senator's life, but Padme and Anakin falling in love. The movie concludes with the beginning of The Clone War, as well as the seeds of Anakin's descent into the dark side of the force.

 As ambitious as the story is, the screenplay is it's weakness. The actors come off as stilted as they act against bluescreen. The movie's production values are impressive, unfortunately George Lucas direction still needs some fine tuning.

I know that the franchise is his and he can do what he wants with it but I think he owed it to us as film goers who like our Star Wars to make them the best he could which, if he looked at the reviews Empire and return of the Jedi got would imply that someone else should direct.

This flic was good but not the star wars magic that made the classics so good. First of all the plot is a little rusty. Protect a senator from assain attempts. Find out who created the clones. I mean this is Star Wars not Star Trek. The acting was ""OK"". Portman was and always have been the perfect Padme. But I'm not just saying that because she a pretty actress. Ewan was the perfect Obi Wan and protrayed the ideal jedi master. But Hayden is where I have to cross the line. Where did they find him? A weirdo with a sign saying, ""Will Act For Food""? He was a terrible to say the least.

 The new villian,Count Dooku, is a really undeveloped character that needed a little more than the title, ""Sidious's New Apprentice"". Not as developed as many of the villians in Star Wars history. The action and Special Affects were top notch but a little overdone. Seeing Boba as a kid was a treat, but Jango Fett is probably the stupidist idea since the Gungans. You should have made it Boba when he was a newer bounty hunter. Jango was a mistake. But the fight scenes were excellent, especially the duel between Yoda and Dooku.

However, Lucas' ""Star Wars"" series has been declining in acting and story quality since ""Return of the Jedi"" with his ""Muppet Show"" montage; as if each sequel had to appeal to a receding age group over the years.

 This one tops it all as being riddled with the lousiest script and acting ever: I saw it once and never returned to see nor have I rented it since. Can Lucas think of a better way of protraying Skywalker than him going through his puberty-driven tantrums? The actor was horrible! The whole love story was vapid anyway: he should have made it short and sweet. Also the technology and ships shown in Episodes 1 and 2 are so vastly different than those shown in 3-5 that there seems to be more than a generational gap.

 Altogether, a very forgettable film. I haven't even bothered renting it since the day I saw it at the theaters.",1091491200,4,1054,4.362244897959184
1313377,4,B00003CXKT,"Some spoilers included below, but surely by now, most people have probably seen the film. If not, you have been advised.

 A Star Wars fan since my childhood, it would be impossible for me not to be enthralled with Lucas' vision of the backstory to the original trilogy. While some of the wonder I experienced with the original trilogy is gone, AOTC has many reasons to recommend it, as well as a few problems.

 First, the positives. The second installment of the original trilogy features some spectacular digital work, lightsaber battles on a scale never before seen in a Star Wars film, and some important backstory that helps us better understand the events of the original trilogy.

 Now, the shortcomings of the film. First, Lucas tries to cover too much plot in two hours and fifteen minutes. As a result, some of the subtle motivations of the characters have been excised from the film purely to save time. The love story between Anakin and Padme is much better explained and developed in the novelization (based on the original script) and deleted scenes. As a result, the film never pauses long enough to allow the viewer to process before moving on to the next big effects shot.

 Secondly, Hayden Christiansen, although I have enjoyed some of his other films, is just grating as Anakin Skywalker. The voice, in particular, was difficult to endure, particularly when every other line seemed to be either ""Yes, master,"" or ""Yes, m'lady."" Ewan McGregor, however, ""ages"" perfectly into a middle-aged Obi-Wan, and the addition of Christopher Lee to the cast was a very nice touch.

 The continued use of the droids provides some comic relief throughout a darker film, but the jokes tend to be cheap puns and tend to undermine the entertainment value of the rest of the film (e.g., C-3PO's ""this is such a drag"" line in the Geonosian arena).

 My final observation is one that will probably make the real fanboys cringe, but I was somewhat disappointed in the beginning of Anakin's trip to the dark side. Sure, the death of a person's mother at the hands of Tusken Raiders would be enough to drive anyone to grief, but it is hard to extrapolate the death of his mother, even when combined with the subtle ""coaching"" of Palpatine, into Anakin's descent to the dark side. I think a lot of people subconsciously had a problem with the fact that one of the most classic screen villans in history was essentially a mama's boy. We do not like to recognize the humanity in our villans--it is much easier to cast someone as purely good or evil, and to see a good jedi go bad partially because he is grieving for his dead mother humanizes Vader beyond the comfort level of the average viewer.

 Despite all these ""faults,"" AOTC is a thoroughly entertaining movie that I have enjoyed numerous times on DVD. Especially with a good surround sound system, it is always a pleasure to immerse one's self in Lucas' universe. And we still have Revenge of the Sith to look forward to! Hopefully, Lucas will not make the same kinds of expository errors he made in AOTC, will not get excessively hung up on subplots (e.g., General Greivous), and will give Anakin's conversion to the dark side the screen time it deserves. In May 2005, I suppose we will find out!",1091145600,3,3249,4.707231040564374

1313379,2,B00003CXKT,"If I were a movie director and for some reason I decided to undertake the project of making the most grotesque parody and mockery ever made of the original Star Wars trilogy, I would do the following:

First, I would open the movie where the main character of the movie -The Jedi- freefalls some 10,000 stories in a sprawling metropolis, all the while narrowly missing multitudes of careening hovercrafts which literally filled the sky, only to finally land safely inside one of them just in the nick of time, nanoseconds before he was about to slam into the ground.

Secondly, I would include the most bland, personality-less, emotionally-uninspiring actors and actresses I could find.  Also, I would incorporate pseudo-Greek cultural and archeological elements throughout the movie (which had no relevancy to the sci-fi theme of the movie) so as to confuse the viewer as to what planet...or planets the movie was taking place in...or what universe and epoch(s) for that matter.  I'd include several pseudo-romantic scenes where there wasn't an iota of emotion or chemistry between the two love birds and whose forced, stimulated 'romantic scenes' seemed to serve no purpose, either.

I would then attempt to completely destroy...annhilate the original Star Wars's sacred notion of the force -as being stimulated and channeled by spirituality and mind over matter- (and any drama associated with it as well) by marring it with inane scientific hodgepodge:  MY notion would be that the measure of one's force can be determined by analyzing mitochondrial DNA samples to tally the number of antibodies present in the protoplasm.

Next, I would blow away the concept of the original Star Wars's wimpy 2-jedi battle scenes with an epic magnitude-12 mega battle scene which consisted of 10,000 jedis and 100,000 jedi foes engaged in flipping-through the-air somersault kung fu moves that render the likes of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and all '70s special-effects-laden Chinese kung fu flics obsolete.  You thought that Luke Skywalker jumping 10 feet out of a carbon freeze container was cool?  Could Luke Skywalker stay airborne for 10 seconds all the while throwing barrages of backroundhouse kicks and punches?  Screw that punchless Luke Skywalker single-blade lightsaber.  Behold, I introduce the double-edged light saber which all jedis are equipped with.  FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND OPERATIONAL.  Only an elite and intelligent class of human being can be a jedi?  Not anymore.  Any living, crawling, oozing intelligence-devoid parasite, wingless bat or orc -of any gender-can be a jedi.

Finally, I would end the movie with Kung Fu/Force-Master Yoda defeating the Master Evil Jedi with triple and quintuple cartwheel backroundhouse kicks and punches, while airborne, and lightning-fast Tae Kwan Do slaps and curled finger combinations  that would put Jackie Chan to shame.  The very last scene of the movie would end with the Evil Jedi Master becoming so angry, because of his defeat, that his head grew to the size of a large balloon, then exploded with the force of 20 grenades.  Maybe I'd include that scene only in the UNCUT version.

The result: The sci-fi sequel to ""Big Trouble in Little China"" -""BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE GREECE: ATTACK OF THE KUNG FU ROBOTS""- or as some people may prefer to call it -""Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones.""",1090195200,7,3352,5.160813308687615
1313380,4,B00003CXKT,"I am writing on behalf of all the Star Wars movies.  Sure the prequals aren't life changing but they still make the cut worthy of the title Star Wars. Back in the 70s/early 80s America needed a major facelift.  We had nothin to look foward to anymore and just went by living.  The movies out back then were dark and dreary.  our common mythology had faded into the closet. Then came Star Wars.  It was just supposed to be another space family film that would eventually be forgotten about.  We were decieved.  What George Lucas put on this Earth was meant to be.  He dragged us out of the gutter and gave us something to talk about.  People had a place to escape to and run away from there troubles.  It wasn't like your average cowboy movie where you know the outcome and the setting.  It was a strange galaxy with weird looking creatures and strange spaceships.  It was all so real and lifelike.  It was the total opposite of Star Trek.  It was cool.  People wanted more.  They got two more.  Each delivering there own set of memories.  The lines became legendary.  The sound of a light saber instantly recognizable.  Movies nowadays are always borrwing lines and plots of other movies.  Star Wars only borrowed one thing.  Creativity. The Star Wars story was pulled out of mid-air.  It wasn't like George Lucas said he wanted to make a space movie kind of like an old western.  He created the idea of A Space Saga Trilogy.  He's the one who threw us into this exciting new world called Star Wars.  Fans wanted more.  They got comics and books.  then Star Wars movies were no more.  They were still in the movies.  Oter movies had borrowed lines and plots for their own.  Thats why Star Wars is pop culture ICON.  That is what the prequals lack.  When someone comes up yo you with a stick in one hand and is waving it around they don't say ""Watch out Count Dooku"".  They say watch out Darth Vader.  The prequals are good movies but they aren't life changing like the Classics.  If the prequals came first people wouldn't be walking around saying Look A destroyer droid.  They don't have the trademark line like they do in the Classics.  They didn't create new famous lines, they just took them from the old ones.  As a movie I would give Phantom Menace and AOTC a 4 Star award.  As a Star Wars film I would give it 2.  The negative two is for lack of creativity.  The OT is so popular because of what it was nd what it was created as.  George didn't give us that sense of story and herics like he did with the OT.  George didn't create the OT because he wanted to tell a story for himself.  He made it for us.  For Episode one we weren't thrown into this new world with weird craetures and memorable charecters.  In a sense of story The prequals fit nicely with the OT.  But for a regular movie It gives us nothing to remember and say over and over again and to instantly recognize as Star Wars.  I know it is hard to repeat what happened in the 70s/80s but there was nothing George Lucas could do about it. The Prequals are out in a world where evereything has already happened and didn't ignite the flame as the OT did. The Phantom Menace just continued in the name of Star Wars.  The OT are just such good movies in themselves and it just doesn't matter which one you see first.  They are all memorable.  Don't get me wrong, the prequals are good movies and definantly worthy in the name of Star Wars but they are just thrown in with all the other movies which were created around one movie-Star Wars.  Other movies wouldn't be the same without there Star Wars moment.  That is why when in the movie Just Married Sarah(Brittany Murphy) asks Tom(Ashton Kutcher) if he ever dreamed of anything more glorious in his childhood than his wedding night, he flashes back to when he was playing lightsabers on the playground with other kids to the famous tune that Changed The World.

1313381,2,B00003CXKT,"This is a debate I recently had with George Lucas.  (This ""debate"" is partially inspired by the posts of other viewers, and I apologize if there's any plagiarizing.  I just thought it would be funny)
GEORGE LUCAS: With my integration of CGI and completely computer-generated characters into my films, ""Star Wars"" is now the ultimate power in the universe!
LORD TAYLOR: Do not be so impressed with these technological marvels know as the ""prequels"" that you have created.  The power to computer-generate an image and give a voice to it is insignificant compared with the power of human actors.
LUCAS: Spare me your empty talk of ""human acting"", Lord Taylor!  Your sad devotion to that ancient method of filmmaking will not stop me from completely computer-generating my films, and making millions at the box office...
(LORD TAYLOR chokes him to death with the Force)
Getting serious now, it is the level of acting and dialogue in the prequels that is killing the magic of the ""Star Wars"" franchise.  Lucas was never very good in these arenas, but he has somehow hit a new low in ""Attack of the Clones"".  In some stretches, I found this movie to be something that I have never before seen in a ""Star Wars"" film- boring.
The main problem with ""Attack of the Clones"" is that it spends a huge amount of time on a love story that is far from captivating- in fact, it's not even interesting.  The fact that a strong woman like Padme would fall in love with the whiny and unsympathetic Anakin Skywalker seems like an absurd idea from the beginning.  I initially blamed the acting for the lack of believability in the love story, but now I realize that Christensen and Portman were doing the best they could.  The problem was mainly the painful dialogue they had to mouth, which has all the absurd lines of the Han-Leia love story but none of the charm or passion.
Ewan McGregor was also doing the best he could considering the circumstances, and his storyline (a detective subplot) is slightly more interesting than the love story.  One almost wishes that he had been given more screen time over Christensen and Portman, but it probably wouldn't have affected the film's quality much.  The entire middle hour of this film is about the detective story and the love story, neither of which has much action at all.  And for a supposed action film to have such long stretches of no or little action is to risk boring the audience, which is exactly what ""Attack of the Clones"" does.
As mentioned earlier, the level of CGI here is absurd, something not seen again on this level until the equally disappointing ""Matrix Revolutions"".  Don't get me wrong, it's decent-looking CGI, but it still looks fake.  It seems that every other character is computer-animated.  It's amazing but true that the puppet Yoda from the previous ""Star Wars"" films looked more real than this CGI version.  Even our old buddy Jar Jar Binks returns.  His role in this one?  To grant emergency powers to Palpatine, thus making his rise to emperor inevitable and dooming the Republic.  Way to go, Jar Jar!
This film was not without its perks.  As mentioned before, Ewan McGregor possesses a certain charm that help to keep his scenes alive.  The action at the beginning and end of the film is pretty good, and everything especially comes alive when the reliable Christopher Lee appears.  Indeed, the film's final half hour is as impressive as some classic scenes from the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy.
However, I worry that the thrill is leaving the franchise.  I sincerely hope that Episode III repairs the damage done by I and II, but considering the history of third entries my hopes are not too high for it.  Lucas claims he can do whatever he want with ""Star Wars"" because it's his franchise, but I wish he would let go of that ego for a second and let other writers and directors step in and help him.  Because when that happens, you get ""The Empire Strikes Back""- still one of my all-time favorite films.",1089504000,4,3970,4.6940836940836945

It's effective eye candy, although I think director-writer George Lucas may have reached the point of diminishing returns.  The whole film has a very artificial, superficial look to it and the actors are like zombies.  No doubt spending their days in front of green screens and blue screens and fretting about maintaining proper eye contact with CGI creatures that wouldn't be finished for another seven months put some constraints on their spontaneity.  As for the story, there's a lot of political intrigue that I didn't care about and a romance that didn't convince me.  Wasn't anyone else bothered by the fact that Anakin Skywalker's (Hayden Christensen) aging process appeared to have overtaken Queen Amidala's (Natalie Portman)?  Wasn't he seven or eight in the last film, while she was about nineteen?  Now they seem to be the same age.

Not a horrible film, but certainly not worthy of being part of such a high-grossing franchise./",1089244800,3,1087,4.934065934065934
1313462,1,B00003CXKT,"If it were possible to give negative stars, I would. I sat for nearly five minutes at the end of the film, watching the credits, waiting for George Lucas to pop up say it was a bad joke, and then  the real movie would start. It didn't happen. George was obviously trying to prove that he can make a piece of crap film, and still make millions because it has the magical words ""Star Wars"" slapped on its title. That can be the only logical explanation for a film this bad. Now, where to begin?
The main points of irritation: the casting, and the acting. The first films each actor was perfect for his or her role. No other person alive could have played Luke's part other than Mark Hamil, or Leia than Carrie Fisher, etc. In AOTC, they went for good looks, not portrayal, or acting ability. Speaking of acting ability, where in the nine hells did they dig up Hayden Christensen? The boy can't act, and he seemed to drain away the entire cast's ability to do so. Even Ewan McGregor, one of my all time favorite actors, was at his artistic low. His performance was forced and tired sounding due to poor characterization and bad lines. Your local library has some B-rated classic Sci-Fi with a lower budget, but the same acting ability.
But, I suppose that's being unfair, you can only work with what you're given, and script-wise, the actors were not given a lot.  The lines were reminiscent of bad 80's anime. E.g.,  Obi-Wan seems to have lost the ability to say Anakin's name and can only refer to him as ""My (Young) Apprentice"". The attempts at humor were poor to say the least. Instead of employing the  typical Star Wars humor gods of irony and sarcasm, they went for the puns. And lordie above, did the puns burn. News flash, any writers out there: No one, not even small children, find puns even remotely funny. And instead of subtle foreshadowing, they went for the blatant. Such as Obi-Wan informing Anakin, ""You'll be the death of me"". In short, my 10 year old cousin could have written a better script for Episode II.
They simply went overboard with the special effects. Plain and simple. Now, some may say it was to make everything more lifelike, but the result was a world more fake looking than a lego-set. Everything had a ridiculous, plastic sheen to it. The non-human's(including Yoda's) movement were too fluid, too calculated to be real. They really should have just stuck with the muppets.
The film even managed to throw consistency with the real trilogy off-kilter. Mainly, in the technology. Now a question: If the prequels take place over 20 years before the original trilogy, how come the technology is more advanced in the prequels? Then, isn't that the way it always goes when an empire takes over.  The economy slides, and everything returns to the 70's(Especially the haircuts). Right? Wrong.
All in all, this film is a huge dissapointment. I was raised on Star Wars, the original trilogy and the Extended Universe books, and this movie crushed my belief in George Lucas's qualifications as a director. My recomendation: Watch episodes IV-VI over and over to brace yourselves for Episode III.",1089158400,29,3117,4.680656934306569

The ending battle scene was long, drawn-out and flat. A whole lot of lazer beams, light sabers, robots, clones, Jedi, space ships and I just didn't care because it was filmed so poorly that it failed to keep me interested. Also very few good guys could be seen getting hurt so there wasn't a feeling of suspense or sympathy.
In contrast is the similar battle scene layout of Two Towers. Both movies have epic battle scenes at the end. They start with a small number of doomed heroes who get temporarily saved by outnumbered allies: the elves in T.T. and the Jedis in Clones. Also the moment of the ride down the rampart is similar to the Jedis arrival as its a momentarily victory but one that is doomed because the enemy is still strong. Then comes the Cavlary in the form of clones in Clones and Gandalf with 3,000 riders in Towers. The enemy is finally defeated and the battle ends.
With Towers I actually felt something for the story and characters because of the filming, scripting, and character development that went in to it. The ride of Gandalf and the riders down the hillside into the Uruks as the sun came up behind them was stirring. I don't even remember Yoda's arrival.
I think there is a valuable lesson for filmmakers to learn on how to do huge battle scenes and how not to do them by watching the end of these two films.",1087603200,,1622,4.501694915254237

The Yoda fight scene DID rock, tho, yes, it did. (The only awesome part of the movie!)
The script is bad, and we are left, again, wondering what this whole thing is about. I was so confused at the end of the first movie as to WHY there was all these battles, and what did it really matter in the end? Well, it doesn't really matter. That's what this movie showed us. These two films are totally disconnected in plot, except the personal strain going through them. (Maybe 3 will answer questions and loose ends, but I doubt it.) The acting was weak, and Anakin was more concerned with getting his way with Padme, rather than seeming genuinely in love with her. I realise that these two felt a passionate, carefree love in comparison with the more mature Han/Leia love, but the downright lust and danger of Anakin was annoying and disturbing. She wouldn't have gone for him. Her acting wasn't any better. And who wrote those lines for her? Talk about cheese!
With a weak script and bad young actors (except, of course, Chris Lee and Frank Oz, and Ian McDiarmid) Lucas has succeeded in showing the world that movies cannot ride on CGI and fame of a name alone. Well, he'd like to think so, wouldn't he?

The only flaw is that listening to Yoda speak, it's easy to forget that you are not watching Fozzie perform one of his brilliant comedy routines.
One of the great mysteries of the original series is solved in this movie: why couldn't Imperial Stormtroopers ever hit the broadside of a barn?  In ""Clones"" it is revealed that all stormtroopers are actually clones of the slightly off-balanced Jenga Fett, the bounty hunter who can't manage to successfully shoot Obi Wan with weapons ranging from a handgun to a small starship blast cannon.
For those who wonder why Obi Wan is so poor at relating to teen-aged Anakin, just watch for the deleted scene of Obi Wan asking Yoda to explain a copy of Benjamin Spock's book.  And the less said about Miss Piggy appearing as a karate-chopping Jedi the better.
While some nitpickers may complain about a few small plot holes, the fact is that there's nothing wrong here.  All plot holes are at least slightly smaller than an imperial starcruiser, even if most are bigger than the QE II.
The ambiguous expressions on Anakin's face remain a bit of a mystery, perhaps indicating a lack of fiber in his diet.

1313556,5,B00003CXKT,"So now everyone is a critic! I'm so tired of whinning fanboys complaining about the prequel trilogy, the Special Editions of the original trilogy, the casting of Hayden and Nathalie, and so on.
This is a wonderful film. This is what film is all about. A great epic to show the magnitude of what was there before the empire we know so well from the OT. This is what we didn't know. We didn't know there were cities like Theed in Naboo. We didn't know the interior of Coruscant. What it was like to live in those planets before the dark times.
Not just that, but we also get to see the most tragic romance ever unfold. Every halfwit out there will say that it is plain stupid. But they forget something relevant: this is fiction, this is not the reality of our 21th century world, but the reality of a galaxy far, far away. In our world, maybe romantic dialogue is almost extinct, or it consists mostly of clichs. But the SW universe was created by one mind alone, and that is Lucas'. You can't judge the Anakin and Padme romance by our own reality, just like you couldn't judge a short-sized green dwarf to be the greatest swordsman of all time. Either you accept this universe as it is, or you don't.
I do not like Jar Jar very much, for instance. I didn't like some of the kiddie stuff in PM, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the movie.
This is the ESB of the PT. As with the OT, the middle proves to be a milestone film, building to new heighs over the previous one. I sure hope that episode III is better than ROTJ, anyway.
This is Lucas' epic. With the OT we got the story, now with the PT we get the myth behind that story. We get to see the golden age of the jedi, and meet new characters we didn't know (Mace Windu, Dooku, Maul, Anakin, Padme, Palpatine, Jango Fett, Qui- Gon...) and also see where is all comes from.
And this PT, if anything, makes the OT more tragic. Because now, Vader ain't just a killing machine with a heart, but is actually someone, someone who was a loving child once, someone who could passionately love a woman. That brings him closer to us, now he is not only an icon. And therefore, the tragedy of his downfall.
My advice: try to see these new films for what they are, not what you wanted them to be. Each and every one of us would have made them differently, but none of us had the vision to come up with it in the first place. So just let Lucas take you to the one place where all six SW films came from... his imagination.",1084752000,,2464,4.211416490486258

The big problem with it is ACTING.  Anakin and Obi-Wan especially were bad in this area.  Its like they were trying to hard or to little.  But I don't think they could have picked a better man for anakin.  Even thou his character in this film stank, I can see how much he is ganna kick a** in Episode III. I think this got more on track with the story of the OT, from EPI 1. Another thing that is bad, is that there is no buildup to fights. There all just rushed into, and with the dialog as well.  To rushed, they never just sat down and gave dialog to much.

In fact, they pale anything you'll find here on measly earth, or even anything you could find in our comparatively humdrum solar system, the effect of all of which gets you even more sucked into the fantastic world(s) Clones shows you, and hence even further out of your own comparatively dreary existence back in reality where, try as one might, there is no Force, there are no single pilot spaceships for adventures, there are no witty companion droids with British accents, and there certainly aren't any senators who look like the former (elected???) Queen Amidala. But then there aren't any senators who look like Jar Jar Binks either, and thankfully most are more qualified.
And speaking of counts, why was Count Doo Doo a count and not a Jedi Master? Am I supposed to care? Who'd placed the order for the clone army again? Was it someone? Isn't the film's title intentionally misleading and therefore insulting? Why doesn't Yoda just use the force to help him get around? Does the force take energy to wield? If so, sadly, Yoda looks like he couldn't wield floss. Oh, maybe none of this matters, but I think it does. Moreover, it must have seemed ground-breaking to make a spaceship go flying and spinning through a bazillion planetary ring fragments with laser bolts darting every which way and a monster red planet dominating the background, but if you're not the animator, and/or you don't have the eyes of an animator, and it's all in motion and a scene like that flashes at you for a whole .85 seconds, your brain goes kind of soupy, and not in a good way.
So even though Hayden Christensen has, maybe, 25% of Harrison Ford's charm at best, Natalie Portman's [body] show right through her costume in one whole scene, Ewan McGregor seems to have improved upon his disarming and brave Kenobi, C3PO has three or four mildly funny one-liners, and the Romanesque arena scene is kind of cool (though I still feel bad for the monsters for some reason), the flim ultimately deflates in a kind of military-industrial orgy of colossal toy machines getting blown to chunks while our heroes ride on through like action figures stuck to posts. But it helps you deal with the bloodshed when there's no blood, when light sabers cauterize the stumps they make where limbs used to be, when the twisted faces of the dead and wounded aren't just lost in storm trooper helmets but are moreover the faces of clones. And it helps you feel better about the massacre of Tuskan raider women and children when you're shown how they aren't civilized-in the ""Western"" sense-but tribal (""They're animals!"" Ani sobs it to Ami), when you see the heroine comfort the murderer and you share in that (feeling both forgiving and forgiven), when you imagine how you'd feel were your mother treated like Ani's mom, and when, really, you know, it's just there to explain/build Darth Vader's character. You see? Make no mistake: behind the light jokes and germ-free props, Attack of the Clones, like eps IV-VI and I, is actually a dismal and ugly film (they are titled ""wars"" after all), but it's a dismal and ugly film that, like the other SW eps and-while I'm at it-a lot of the dreck put out by Hollywood these days, shows a casual irreverence for consequences.

1313561,3,B00003CXKT,"While not the total disappointment Phantom Menace was, Attack of the Clones still wasn't as strong as the original trilogy.  Then again, maybe the original trilogy can't be equaled.  Regardless, while Attack of the Clones was a giant step forward, there are still some glaring problems.
For the second straight movie, Lucas created neat characters only to use them as plot devices.  In Phantom Menace there was a lot of press about Aurra Sing and Darth Maul.  I can't even remember if Sing made the final cut of the movie.  Maul, who was a nice mysterious villain, was painfully underused and dispatched rather easily.  This limited the impact he would have on the story.  In Attack of the Clones, both Zam Wessel and Jango Fett were used more to further the plot than to make them of any true significance within the Star Wars universe.  This is more so of Wessel than Jango.  Wessel was used in all of one, ultimately insignificant sequence of the movie.  Jango, while being one of the major characters in the story, was only given a limited life span.  Using these kinds of throw-away characters does little to improve the overall flow of the movie.
The other major problem to the flow of the movie was the dialogue.  Oh, boy was it ever!  At times it felt like children could write better romance scenes!  This I have an easy solution for, turn off the volume.  Seriously.  Just treat it like a silent film.  I bet the movie as a whole will seem a lot better!  Actually, a cut of the movie with the music, but no dialogue would be best.
Enough with the bad stuff.  There were some good parts.  Like with Phantom Menace, the backgrounds and scenery were beautiful.  Everything about Obi-Wan and Ewan McGregor's acting were spectacular.  The final lightsaber duel, while a bit goofy, was fun and energetic, a real pleasure to watch.  While a little forced, fans start to get a feel for Anakin's fall from grace.  Finally, there are aspects of the Republic Army that start to resemble the Empire that fans are familiar with.
While no where near perfect, the improvement in this movie over Phantom Menace gives me high hopes for Episode III.  Guess we have to wait until next year to find out.",1082505600,,2193,4.619170984455959

In the original Star Wars, there was suspence and drama because we were given a chance to know and care about the characters.  Special effects were tools of the trade, used to aid in the telling of the story.  It seems that the new trend is to come up with some really ""cool"" special effects, then string them together with bad dialogue and call it a movie.  I am really annoyed with George Lucas for making me feel old before my time; I am much to young to be complaining about the good old days and declaring that ""They don't make 'em like they used to.""

From a cinematic and linguistic point of veiw the movie was good--not great, but good--however, that was dimmed by the narcacistic and wooden performance by Hayden Christensen as the future Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker. Ewan McGregor's performance was quite good and he makes great young Obi-Wan. Natlie Portman acted very well also, but not quite as well as in the Phantom Menace, because having  Hayden Christensen to play off of is no different than a big wall.
The scenery and special effects were stunning and the costumes were also gorgeous. I found it very interesting that in the final battle scene, the domesticated monster managed to symmetrically rip off both of Natalie Portman's sleeves and bottom of her shirt, so her entire upper body, except for her chest were showing.

1313677,3,B00003CXKT,"Being a big fan of the original trilogy, I have to say this movie isn't terrible.  On it's own, its okay.  But it doesn't fit in (as ""The Phantom Menace"" didn't)  One major problem with the new trilogy is that it won't mesh well with the old one. (I know I haven't seen the 3rd one, but just keep reading) The idea of having Palpatine be an extremely important key to the downfall of the Jedi seems like a flaw, in terms of the way the films are set up.  I mean, in episode IV, he's not in it at ALL, not even mentioned.  So for future Star Wars fans who first watch Episode I and go all the way through VI, don't you think they'd be a little confused as to why Palpatine is no where to be found in A New Hope?  What, was he on vacation?  I understand that originally when A New Hope was made, George Lucas didn't plan to have the films go on, so Palpatine wasn't mentioned.  But now it's going to damage the experience for new generations.  The major thing wrong with Episode II is the TRULY AWFUL YODA LIGHTSABRE BATTLE.  Everyone thought it was great, but me it seems.  A little CG green yo-yo bouncing around the room look laughably bad.  And what's with Yoda having a lightsabre anyway?  I always imagined him being this awesome Jedi who was so powerful that he didn't need something like a lightsabre.  So I guess he just lost it when he moved to Dagobah.  I don't know. And the fact the he was completely computer generated in Episode II bothers me.  HE LOOKS FAKE.  Okay?  The muppet version masterfully performed by Frank Oz was considered great when it came out.  Talk of Oscar nomination even.  He was the Gollum of its day (Except Gollum is a CG character who looks real)  (I don't like the Episode 1 Yoda either-I know he was actually a puppet-but he looked WRONG)Anyway, Yoda fighting in while being CG is the worst thing to happen to Star Wars (besides Jar-Jar)",1081900800,,1876,4.3028571428571425
1313678,1,B00003CXKT,"Wow, what a truly awful, pathetic movie.

And here I am, speaking as an original Star Wars fan from way back in 1977.  Was that a seminal movie to remember or what?  I still remember watching that movie in college, and feeling the incredible thrill and awe and excitement.

I remember also the thrill and anticipation for ""Phantom Menace"", after such a long, long, hiatus.

Well, Phantom Menace did not exactly live up to the hype, but at least it was not a completely awful movie.  The sheer inventiveness and energy of Ray Park as Darth Maul, and the grace of Natalie Portman as Amidala/Padme, more than made up for the idiotic Jar Jar Binks and the retard boy who played the young Anakin.

But, as if we hadn't gotten enough of ONE bad child actor playing the future Darth Vader, in this movie, we get  Hayden Christensen, as a pouty teen age version of Anakin Skywalker.  A pouty teen ager who can't act either.

And what ever happened to Industrial Light and Magic's vaunted cutting edge special effects?  Almost everything in this movie looked like it was old technology.  The CGI and special effects for ""Lord of the Rings"" was ten times better and more realistic.  George Lucas made some bad decisions here - he went almost entirely with CGI to do the special effects, especially the background sets and the robots and androids, when a combination of traditional models and set design and real actors would have served him much better.  Peter Jackson realized the current limitations of CGI and ended up producing a perfect fusion of traditional and CGI techniques that was nearly indistinguishable from reality in ""Lord of the Rings"".  ""Attack of the Clones"" has  so much CGI, and the look and feel of the CGI is so flat and featureless that it looks fake and cartoon-like, not much different from one of those cheesy Saturday morning CGI cartoon shows where human actors step into a CGI cartoon world.

But it was the inane plot-lines that ultimately did this movie in.  The worst scene of all time had to to have been when Yoda started having his light-saber duel with Count Dooku.  At that point, I just had to close my eyes and sink down into my seat in the theater in utter despair (that was the only time that I have watched this movie, in the theater).  Yes, definitely, it was the sight of Master Yoda bouncing off the walls like a rubber ball, wielding a light saber, that finally nailed the coffin lid shut on this once proud and trend-setting movie franchise for me.

And let's forget about George Lucas's claim that this movie was supposed to be a love story.  Even an accomplished actress like Natalie Portman couldn't save this dog of a plot line, especially playing off of Hayden Christensen.  I mean, really, she's supposed to be six or seven years older than him.  All I could think of at that point in the story was,  love story?  What love story?  Why?  Why?  WHY?  What redeeming qualities do you see in this whiny pathetic teen age toad?  Run!  Save yourself, Princess!!!  It's just a Jedi mind trick!!!

One has to remember that George Lucas once also made ""Howard the Duck"", and that is about the only thing that explains this awful, and I mean really, really bad, just ugh, take your breath away, oooooof,  bad movie.  It isn't even on the level of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".  Now that was a bad movie that could be appreciated for its sheer badness.  ""Attack of the Clones"" is so thoroughly infused with pretensions of greatness that it has not even this one redeeming quality.

Yes, George Lucas, it's time to wake up and hear the truth.  You are a billionaire and an emperor in your own little kingdom.  You are surrounded by all these yes-men, who are afraid to tell you just how bad of a director and screenwriter you are.  You have no ability to cast the right actors for a movie part or to show the actors how to get the performance needed for a scene.  Nobody around you dares to tell you that your famously penny-pinching ways are turning ILM's special effects movie technology into yesterday's news.  You need to let go of your creation and hire better writers and directors and let them take hold of this story.  But you haven't and you won't.

Despite the movie's inadequacies, the ""Attack of the Clones"" DVD is exceptional - the extras enable this package to be one of the best on the market; everything you would expect for 6 hours worth of extras - creation of the digital Yoda and all areas of production; sound and pre-visualisation and an amazing web-based documentary series.

If you are a fan of the saga then I recommend that you wait for the Episodes 1, 2, 3 DVD package or the 6 movie package when that is eventually released. I believe the deleted scenes would service the films better by being in them (like the extended Lord of the Rings DVD's), therefore, wait for George to produce this product.

Plently of other reviewers point out how colossally terrible these movies are, but not enough have focused on how terrible an actor Hayden Christiansen is. During the ""romantic interludes"" I actually felt myself getting squemish. I can't explain why other than it appeared to be the most forced, uninspired acting and dialogue I had ever witnessed. It was not unlike watching a bus load of babies drive off a cliff. Bad beyond comprehension.
  Then, H.C.'s acting goes from intestinal revulsion to genuine unintentional hilarity. That scene where he confesses to killing all the sand people and then throws a soda can across the room, or something, who the hell was paying attention by this time? That scene was so funny, so terribly written, driected, acted, and produced I began to feel uncomfortable watching it too.
  I bought I and II and haven't watched them for over a year. I probably never will again. When III comes out I won't need to catch up on any story because there is none. The only story is how Lucas managed to get 2 consecutively God-awful actors to play Anakin.
  At no time did this incoherent rambling movie approach anything resembling a rational film. Everyone who has seen this collection of moving pictures is now dumber because of it. I award this movie no stars and may God have mercy on Lucas' soul. (adapted from Happy Gilmore)
  Oh, and that Yoda Kung-Fu crap...That scene will earn George an extra special place in hell.
  Last thing...Natalie Portman is really hot.",1080777600,9,1564,4.802238805970149
1313683,4,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones truly is the payoff for all the setup going on in The Phantom Menace! We dig deeper into not only how Anakin turns to the darkside, but also how the Empire and the Emperor in the Old Trilogy came to be! And we've also got a great dark mystery story that builds and builds that leads up to the climactic clone wars that were talked about in A New Hope! And most of all, Yoda fighting!
Like The Phantom Menace, this movie has its faults - although not as many. There were still approaches taken that didn't work for everyone, but I think the approaches taken this time worked for more people. But that always happens with any film, and all of the Star Wars movies have their faults. I'd say this film is consistant with what Star Wars films have always been - B movies with an A budget.
The picture quality is quite impressive, since this movie was filmed digitally and we're watching it on a digital source. It truly is the most crisp film to be transfered to DVD. The sound is incredible on a surround sound system too!
The special features are great. We've got a couple main documentaries, deleted scenes(some of which should've remained in the film IMHO), TV and film trailers, etc. And we have another blooper reel easter egg: Go to the options menu, type in 11[enter], 3[enter], 8[enter], and it'll play. The 1138 is from Lucas' first film ""THX 1138"", so that's why that particular number was used. And I'm sure there are other hidden features that I can't remember right now too. Overall, the special features are worth watching, and very entertaining.
Great movie, great DVD!",1080691200,2,1602,4.546712802768166
1313684,4,B00003CXKT,"A film by George Lucas
""Attack of the Clones"" takes place ten years after the events of ""The Phantom Menace"".  Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is an Apprentice in the Jedi order and is studying under Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor).  When Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) from Naboo barely survives an assassination attempt, Kenobi and Skywalker are assigned by the Jedi Council to protect her and eventually to look into who is trying to have her killed.  This sets the events of the film into motion.
Senator Amidala intended on speaking out against the Republic raising an army.  There has been unrest in the Republic and thousands of star systems have already left the Republic and have formed an Alliance under a former Jedi named Count Dooku (Christopher Lee).  The army would be to help the Jedi keep the peace in the galaxy, but many do not feel it is the role of the Republic to have a standing army.  I do not give this background information to bore, but rather because this is the set-up that the movie is presenting us with.
Anakin and Obi-Wan are able to track a subsequent attempt on Padme's life to a bounty hunter.  Obi-Wan follows the trail of the bounty hunter to a planet where he discovers there is a clone army being created, apparently at the orders of a Jedi ten years ago.  He also meets the bounty hunter who is being used as the stock for the clones: Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison).  Kenobi believes that Fett is also the Bounty Hunter who was trying to kill Padme Amidala.  We also get to see the child: Boba Fett.
While Obi-Wan is investigating the bounty hunter and now the clones, Anakin has been instructed to return Padme to Naboo for safety reasons.  It is during this trip that romance blossoms.  There is a courtship, intense on Anakin's part, and our knowledge of the original trilogy tells us how it is going to end.
This movie serves to set up several important points in the Star Wars universe.  We see the relationship between Anakin and Padme which will eventually provide us with Luke and Leia.  We see Anakin begin his descent into the Dark Side and also have him start to become as much machine as human (as Vader is in the Original Trilogy), and we also see how Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) gains so much power as well as the clone army, which is the precursor to the Imperial Stormtroopers.
Is this movie perfect?  By no means.  Much of the dialogue feels stilted and awkward, and I can only imagine how difficult it is to act against a blue screen because the creatures will only be digitally added later.  Still, this was an enjoyable movie with excellent effects and more of a feel of ""Star Wars"".  Besides, there is a certain sense of justice in Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) being indirectly responsible for the rise of the Empire.  This is a science fiction ""Star Wars"" movie.  We're not going to get classic cinema, but we will get a fun trip to the movies.",1078963200,21,2927,4.592307692307692
1313836,3,B00003CXKT,"I guess the problem with announcing you're going to make a trilogy is that you can't really back out of it once the first movie sucks.  So ""Attack of the Clones"" is the fifth and (hopefully) penultimate Star Wars movie, and in many ways it does feel like all concerned are merely churning it out.  That said, Part II is light years ahead of Phantom Menace in terms of entertainment value.  Large parts of Part I were spent listening to the Senate of the Republic debate utterly pointless stuff, about as interesting as watching the real US senate on CSpan and presumably you haven't paid money to watch CSpan.
Anyway, this movie cuts out the boring senate stuff and has a lot more links to the original trilogy.  It's really interesting to see Anakin begin to lose it, and the Emperor beginning to take control of the Republic.  The new plot, set 10 years after Phantom Menace is equally unfathomable. Instead of a trade blockade we have an impending succession over some unmentioned topic (slavery anyone?).  It's never really explained that well, and a few subplots and double-crosses muddy the water even further.  Still, it's not ""The Matrix II"" level garbage, and hopefully Episode 3 will clear some stuff up.
Overall I thought the movie was pretty good, and much better than the last one, mostly due to the lack of Jar Jar Binks and the increased amount of Ewan McGregor, however I have 3 main issues with the film (besides the convoluted plot, which I Trust the final film will elucidate).
First - Anakin and Padme. Dull dull dull!! The Anakin kid can't act and we already know what happens, why belabor a good sci-fi movie by throwing in shots of them rolling in meadows?! Puke-tastic!!!  It shocked me even more to see that the deleted scenes section had even more of the same nonsense!!  Lucas really thought we wanted to see that?? Urgh...
Secondly, the CGI is now waaaaay over the top.  It's frankly unconvincing when it's over used.  Yoda and the Clones made me feel like I was watching someone else play a computer game, and a lot of the sets in the factory looked designed to be recreated in the Video Game of the Movie.  Whatever happened to real sets and real actors?  Particularly appalling is when the clones are in the background - they all have these set ""look inconspicuous"" routines that a human actor would never do.  It's fake, it's distracting and it's unnecessary. Also, since when could R2D2 fly? That'd have come in handy later (...In the first trilogy. My head hurts...)
Finally, I'm still puzzled by the timeline here.  Anakin has to father Luke and Leah before he gets corrupted and goes over to the dark side.  Lets say Padme is 26. That gives her 10 more childbearing years.  She gets knocked up at 36, Anakin becomes Darth at 28, Luke is born, the Empire rules the galaxy for ABOUT 20 YEARS and then Luke and Leah team up to destroy the Death Star (twice).  Overthrow the Empire, kill the Emperor and save Darth.  It all seems a little bit too fast.  It also requires some rapid aging on behalf of Obi Wan, Yoda, The Emperor and Darth to leave them as old as they are in A New Hope, 30 years later.
Anyway, the movie's ok, can't wait for the next one so it'll all be over.  Then perhaps someone can invent a time machine and go back to a long long time ago, in a galaxy not so far away and stop the Phantom Menace ever being conceived...",1078876800,3,3372,4.5131578947368425
1313837,3,B00003CXKT,"One of the things that bug me here is that thigns are titled wrong.  They tell me that I shouldnt get angry about that, that I cant controll what people title thigns, but I think my titles are so much better its frustrating.  So here are my titles for the series:
Episode I: A Jedi is Born
Episode II:  The Jedi Comes of Age
Episode III:  The Fall of the Jedi (This is guessing because I haven't seen Ep III yet...but maybe George Lucas will read this and see i'm right and this will be the title...here's hoping...)

1313838,5,B00003CXKT,"Set 10 years after THE PHANTOM MENACE, Lucas again throws us into a mix that includes speeder chases, clone armies, and death arenas. Yes, it's Episode II!

The Republic is divided. Due to corruption in the Senate, many star-systems have left. Led by former Jedi Count Dooku, this Separatist movement has made it uneasy for the Jedi Council to keep the peace.

Palpatine, the new Chancellor of the Republic, proposed creating an army, to aid the Jedi, but many Senators, including Padme Amidala of Naboo, opposed such laws. Upon arrival on Coruscant - the film's opening scene - she was set to vote against this law when death threats against her life were made.

After she met with Palpatine and Yoda, the decision was made for Jedi Anakin Skywalker to escort Amidala back to Naboo to hide while Skywalker's master, Obi-Wan Kenobi was to track down Padme's assassin(s). Little does Yoda know that the Sith are still in action.

1313839,4,B00003CXKT,"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away ...
There once was a time when a Star Wars film was met with huge anticipation. The Empire Strikes Back became a huge hit three years after the original A New Hope surprised audiences across the country with amazing special effects and charming characters and story. After Return of the Jedi in 1983, the American public would be without another Star Wars film for sixteen years. It was no surprise that Episode I - The Phantom Menace had a huge opening in 1999. But it is because of that film that Episode II - Attack of the Clones is met with more doubt then anticipation. Sure, there are some things about the film to get excited about. Anakin Skywalker grows up and draws ever closer to his destiny of becoming Darth Vader, the end of the Republic and the formation of the Empire becomes more evident, and the actions that lead up to the events in A New Hope are revealed. But it was the weak dialogue and less then stellar new characters from The Phantom Menace that made fans' expectations of Clones pretty low. But will the film prove those expectations wrong or will this continue the trend of disappointment?
The story goes that it has been ten years since the events of Episode I where the planet of Naboo was attacked by the greedy Trade Federation and the training of young Anakin Skywalker began. Since that time, the young Jedi has been under the teaching of Obi-Wan Kenobi, who is still pretty young himself. Anakin soon meets an old friend, Padme, former queen of Naboo, after the two Jedi are called to protect her after a failed assassination attempt. Things go awry when Obi-Wan follows a bounty hunter named Jango Fett and Anakin falls in love with Padme during his absence, which is against the Jedi Code. The dialogue and the plot involving the romantic aspects of the film fall extremely flat but did anybody really expect it to be very good in the first place? This is Star Wars. The core audience is mainly geeks who are just waiting in anticipation to see Yodi with a light-saber. The plot does flow pretty well and doesn't contain as many cut up and forced action sequences as Episode I. Many pieces to the Star Wars puzzle are added which will lead to intriguing events in Episode III.
Much of the cast from The Phantom Menace returns in Clones but there are plenty of new members as well. It can safely be said that the acting overall is much better then was presented in Episode I but still isn't at the level of the original Star Wars Trilogy.  Hayden Christensen does an exceptional job with the crucial role as Anakin Skywalker. One can make arguments on how Anakin acts too whiny but that has to do with the script rather then Christensen's acting. Natalie Portman is much more mature in her acting then she was in the first prequel. Her constant costume changes do still seem a bit much but not like it was in Episode I. Ewan McGregor, who continues his role as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, is much surer of himself in Episode II which is better then his flat version in the previous film. Samuel L. Jackson still has the kick butt attitude he gave to his character but this time we actually get to see him wield a light-saber. Frank Oz is still memorable as the voice of Yoda even though the character has become a digital creation rather then a puppet.
Overall, Attack of the Clones continues one of the greatest sagas in Hollywood history. There is much improvement in this film from The Phantom Menace but as good as it was, there were plenty of flaws. As it was said before, the romantic aspect of the story does come off pretty flat but who really expects great romance from Star Wars? Though the action sequences involving Jango Fett were very well done, his character's death made the overall effect of the character come off as pointless. Lucas continues to astonish movie-goers with the amazing special effects from Industrial Light & Magic, though it seemed that there was too much CGI at times. The large amount of CGI made it seem more like a computer-animated film rather then a live-action feature film. Speaking of CGI, if you didn't hate him enough from the first prequel, you'll really want to tear Jar-Jar Binks apart in this installment, though his role is diminished a bit. And concerning the fight sequence between Yoda and Count Dooku, as good as it is, the sequence comes off early on as comical rather then dramatic as it is suppose to seem. Beside small mishaps, Attack of the Clones enlivens the Star Wars series with full-blown action sequences and tons of computer-graphic special effects. Episode II definitely doesn't live up to the greatness of The Empire Strikes Back but does make a close second.

1313840,1,B00003CXKT,"Unlike most people I know, I didn't hate Phantom Menace.  I enjoyed it.  It's got some sappy bits and some contrived bits but I convinced myself that it's just pretty fan-fiction and not actually canon.
Clones is a whole other ball of wax. This flick is dreadful. Apart from some cool looking space ships and a big dumb (but fun) battle at the end, there's nothing of substance here.  The writing and acting is unwatchable across the board and Lucas' refusal to use actual physical set pieces in favor of green screens and CGI is jarring and nauseating.  When the floors the characters are standing on look like cartoons, it distracts from whatever pathetic story he's trying to tell.
Can somebody explain to me please what's going on with Syfo Dias?  I truly believe Lucas has lost his mind.  Not only is he churning out these horrid films but he's now pretending that the original trilogy doesn't exist.  He's a monster.",1076803200,6,922,4.6894409937888195
1313841,4,B00003CXKT,"After watching The Phantom Menace and now Attack Of The Clones I was disappointed until I realized something very important -- I am not 8 years old anymore.  These movies are made for the imagination of children.  Let's face it, most of us have grown up.
When I watch the original trilogy now I see it as being cheesy, poorly written but very entertaining.  I didn't think that as a child just as I am sure children seeing these movies don't look at it critically.  To appreciate the Star Wars movies one must not be so cynical and look at through the eyes of a child.
I like Attack Of The Clones.  The acting is cheesy, the script poor, but the effects are amazing and it's a Star Wars movie.",1076803200,2,693,4.3
1313842,2,B00003CXKT,"It's almost incomprehensible that George Lucas wouldn't realize that his gift is in production, not directing.  He very wisely contributed only the story to Empire and Jedi, allowing Irvin Kershner to write the screenplay and direct.  But Lucas loves the series so much that he wants to be involved as possible.  And now he's ruined it.  At least, this part.
Attack of the Clones is a heartbreak to those of us who insisted that Episode II would make up for all the weaknesses in Episode I.  This movie instead draws on those weaknesses - it provides a lot of eye candy, but seems to forget what made the original trilogy so great in the first place.  A great story, lots of irony, and a sense of being somewhere we've never been before.  The main thing that resonates in this movie is, as in episode I, Lucas' love of technology.
Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) should not be a whiny jerk - throwing things at walls during temper tantrums is not proper behavior for a true child of the force.  If Anakin had been a deep character, torn by love for those around him to sacrifice himself to the dark side, we would have loved him.  But he's so weak and self-centered that I personally was glad to see him lose his ""big"" saber fight.  Another letdown - the child of the force gets taken out within approximately 30 seconds?
Padme (Portman) also appears weak, as she actually falls for the guy.  Come on - she has more class than that.
Speaking of the saber fights, those were also really disappointing.  Episode I's were fantastic - great choreography, fascinating interplay, etc.  But in this one all we have are a bunch of flashing lights, or ""too-close-ups,"" until Yoda gets on the scene.  Which was...interesting.  Theoretically, he could have taken care of Count Dooku without having to use his saber.  But oh well.
Last disappointment I'll mention - John Williams did a great job for the first four movies, but there is very little original brilliance here. It's almost like he realized the quality of this movie and spent his time on scoring Harry Potter instead, on which he was concurrently working.  The love theme ""Across the Stars"" is symbolic of the love story itself - unoriginal, apathetic, and straight off the shelf.
Kudos to Ewan McGregor, though.  He did a good job with what he was given.
Should you see this movie?  Of course you should - it's Star Wars.  But if you care about this series at all, prepare for heartbreak, in more ways than one.",1076803200,2,2462,4.629032258064516
1313843,2,B00003CXKT,"Is George Lucas trying to retroactively ruin our childhoods with the new trilogy? In all seriousness, something must change before the third film for the once great director to save face. Perhaps the best thing Lucas could do is to hand off the directing reins as he did for Empire and Jedi? It seems clear that these past two have been far too much about technology and lacking much artistic instinct.",1076457600,2,402,4.676056338028169
1313844,5,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones is, in my opinion, great. It is much better than The Phantom Menace (not that that was a bad film). Obviously not as good as any of the first ones, but it is still a blast.
The film starts of with an assasination attempt on the Senator of Naboo, Padme Amidala. Chanceller Palpatine then recomends that bodyguards should be brought in to protect the Senator. Step in Obi-Wan-Kenobi and his headstong apprentice, Anakin Skywalker (the future Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Vader).
To cut a long story short, Anakin and Padme begin to fall deeply in love, which is forbidden for a Jedi, and Obi-Wan uncovers a secret Clone Army (Clone Wars, anyone?).
This film is a lot darker than any of the other Star Wars films, as Anakin shows hints of his future self. It is also much more action packed than any of the other ones.
The direction, dispite what people say, is stylish and fast-paced. I've had enough of all these George Lucas bashers out there, it gets on my nerves. If you actually look at his films properly (I'm not just talking about the Star Wars films) you can see a great artist at work.
  The acting is nothing to brag about, but it's not that bad. Ewan Mcgregor is quite good as Obi-Wan-Kenobi. Natalie Portman is very plain. Christopher Lee is great, as he always is. Hayden Christensen is a bit hit and miss, so to speak. Sometimes he's quite good, but others he's quite laughable. I do like his brooding quality, though, and the scenes when he shows his temper. That's why I hold high hopes for him in Episode 3, because as we all know, that's the one when he really blows.
The special effects are obvioulsy superb, but you wouldn't really expect anything less from ILM (Industrial Light & Magic).
So all in all, this is a brilliant installment to the Star Wars saga. I for one, can't wait for Episode 3. You thought this one was quite sinister, you ain't seen nothing yet. Enjoy.",1076112000,4,1912,4.491379310344827
1313940,3,B00003CXKT,"Tho there are 'objective' reasons why these newer additions to Star Wars are weaker, for the most part I think I'd have been awe-struck by these too, had I seen them whilst at the age I saw the original trilogy. So I'm not in agreement about ""how much"" weaker they are to the others. But there are elements in this one, that let it down from being with the others.
1. SCRIPT- A simplistic script is fine, if you restrict it to simplistic issues. The 'enlightenment' angle is messed up. Yoda's character becomes more 'arrogant', as opposed to 'wise' (as do all the characters who say anything about anything related to the mind/spirit).Its a complex issue, so either have complex dialogue, or skip that stuff altogether.
2. ACTING- 'Anikin' isn't given depth. The anger/pain feels too superficial to create the evil of Darth Vader. He seems more 'whiny', than 'deeply disturbed'.But he's still fun to watch. Ewan McGregor does not pull-off the 'inner calmness' that the story suggests of OB1-K'nobey. None of the 'enlightened ones' seem especially peaceful ('Peace' is their apparent calling card).They seem preachy and 'forceful' of their views, instead of 'sharing' wisdom.
3. ""THE FORCE""- This 'force' representation was never supposed to be indepth, I know. But it's always been fun! But in this film, 'The Force' is so powerfull that there is no reason for the Dark Side to even try fighting back. And why should the good guys even bother turning up 'physically' to anything, when they're guarenteed to win anyway, just by ""Willing it into being"".Its like one football team winning against a team of potato-sacks. The result was never in the hands of the potato-sack team.
But with all these negatives, there are the staple positives of Star Wars. And VISUALLY- its amazing! It's always visually interesting, whether it be the costumes, camera-work, actor's movements or special-effects. So if u r patient with the negatives, its a really exciting and imaginitive film. There are plenty of positives, too.",1076112000,,2009,5.0
1313941,1,B00003CXKT,"I was absolutely appauled at the lack of story, confusing reoccuring details, and obvious lack of direction from the second installment of the pre-quel to the star wars trilogy.
I watched ATTACK OF THE CLONES with an open mind. Having been completely disappointed with THE PHANTOM SLEEPER, I thought that perhaps George Lucas may have been a bit rusty at film directing, since his last directorial debut was A NEW HOPE, but now I am convinced that Lucas is completely oblivious as to what made the original trilogy a success.
Although, STAR WARS was the premeire special effect dominator from 1977-1983, it's story was a simple one. Good against evil. Character definition was achieved, and by the end of A NEW HOPE, I was able to distinguish the good characters from the bad. While watching the pre-quels, I found it difficult to recognize who the bad characters were from the good ones. Not to focus too much on THE PHANTOM SLEEPER, but Darth Moul, and Qui-gon Jin, were killed off before any developement was established.
The original STAR WARS Trilogy dialogue was whitty, and at times funny. The interaction between Leia and Han was actually believeable, but it is hard to believe that Anikin and Pademe are in love. The love sceene in ATTACK OF THE CLONES was horrible. Pademe's dry, monotone unemotional dialogue was almost as interesting as watching paint dry. At the end of EMPIRE, when Luke, Leia and the droids were on the medical frigate, watching Lando and Chewbacca take off to try and resuce Han, I felt an overwhelming amount of empathy for the characters. At the end of ATTACK OF THE CLONES, I was glad to leave the theater.
George Lucas once said that a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing, yet that is exactly what is two pre-quels are... CGI without a story. I don't understand the whole trade federation embargo, and how this is launches the dommino effect to an insurrection to the senate, which is the only plot device that I can corollate the pre-quels to the trilogy with.
It is doubtful that the last of the pre-quels will venture any better. I find it extreamely hard to believe that this is the back story that Lucas has floating in his head when he embarked on making film-making history. If this is so, then it's a sure bet that had he started with the pre-quels in 1977, we would never had seen the A NEW HOPE, EMPIRE AND JEDI twenty five years later.
Here is a suggestion for Mr. Lucas....
Skip the prequels and just release the original trilogy on DVD. That's what us fans really want. That was your masterpiece. Since the original triology was created first, these pre-quels have proven to be the afterbirth of the greatest science fiction adventure ever created.",1075075200,12,2717,4.7100840336134455
1313942,2,B00003CXKT,"The greatest quality that this movie has are the incredible visual effects.  That's about it.  It is a feast for the eyes.  But the actors are horrible.  The CGI characters have more facial expression. Speaking of the CGI characters, the same tendencies hold true here as in ""The Phantom Menace.""  There is a serious racial tone to the characters.  Some have flat faces with Asian inflections, another has a large nose and undoubtedly sounds stereo-typically Jewish, and Jar-Jar Binks, easily the most annoying character to be created in the last ten years, is obviously a ""coon"" stereo-type character. It is truly sad. The scenes with extensive dialogue all look staged and simplistic.  Then there is the script.  Whew!  Let me take in a deep breath on this one...  The dialogue is ridiculous and tenuous, thin and contrived dribble!  The plot moves fairly well except for a couple of stupid moments.  One moment comes when Skywalker jumps from a flying speeder and falls and falls until he grabs hold of the other speeder they were chasing at the exact moment it passes. Brilliant timing, even for a Jedi. It's amazing he did not have his arms torn off when he grabbed hold. Another scene has Yoda limping onto the screen only moments later miraculously turned into a crazed Mexican jumping bean weilding a light-sabre.  There were others, with varying characters: the Princess falling from a transport at the exact moment they pass over a tall but unusually soft sand dune; Skywalker finding his mother just moments before she dies (just enough time for last goodbyes); Obi-wan clinging to a wire rope as he lurches to a sudden stop over a roiling sea (what a grip!).  His hands should have been shredded and he should have gone tumbling into the murky waters below.  The chemistry between the actors is atrocious!  I won't go into detail, but they really don't like each other.  In summation: a decent story with ridiculous plot devices, and amazing visual effects.  This is a great example of flash over substance.",1073433600,5,2019,4.853801169590644
1313943,4,B00003CXKT,"I would never have considered watching this movie if it were for some of the poor reviews on amazon alone and the first let down that was Phantom Menace.
  However I started watching it by accident while flipping channels. I have to say that I stopped flipping channels quickly and was glued to the screen till the end. And what a long movie it is...
  For someone who's watched the old star wars as a kid when they came out, it was very exciting to watch and see how DarkVader eventually came to be. I disagree with those that say there was no plot. I believe the plot was carefully crafted so as to show the sequence of events that led the young Jedi joining the dark side.
  Also the computer generated images  are quite amazing, especially the explosions that look more realistic than in some of the previous ones. The feeling of depth is also very well rendered in some of the combat scenes... I would give this movie 5 stars if anyone considered giving The Matrix reloaded 1 star. Some of the bad reviews for this movie would be appropriate for The Matrix Reloaded, especially the ones that critiscize the quick successions of scenes... This I believe was very well done and on purpose. The switching between ObiOne and the apprentice gave a sense that both were getting to the same place from different routes, but that one might end up being led astray...
  For once this is a movie that may not appeal to those that have little understanding of plot making and subtle scenes, which could explain some of the poor reviews pushed to the extreme.
My only complaint is that this movie made me miss the humour that could be found in the old episode featuring Harrison Ford at his prime. However the youthful energy of the young apprentice, his building arrogance and slight darkness was very well portrayed by this young actor. As for McGregor, he lacked sympathy and understanding for his apprentice, which would have otherwise opened some room for some interesting discussions between the two, which in turn would have given the characters more depth.. An essential element to make us care about their fate for the next episodes..",1073174400,4,2136,4.644562334217507
1313944,4,B00003CXKT,"Frankly, I think this movie gets a lot worse rap than it deserves.  People can never seem to bring it up without bringing up the LotR trilogy - you should be able to praise a movie without unnecessarily bringing up another.  AotC and The Phantom Menace are both trashed for things that exist but are excused in Episodes IV through VI: cheesy dialogue, wooden acting, stilted chemistry.  Why are people getting upset over these things now when SW films have been like this for almost 30 years?  Honestly.
 As far as the dialogue is concerned - compared to other, non-SW films, no, AotC doesn't look that great.  But look at it compared to the other SW films?  *No* SW film has ever been praised for sparkling dialogue.  It's silly to vilify AotC and TPM alone for it.  If anything, the dialogue in AotC is actually (if only by a little) better than the others; Obi-Wan himself has some classic one-liners.  Anakin's dialogue is the most trashed, and true there are some weak points (his fireplace scene monologue went about two lines two far), but really, considering the guy is totally inexperienced at picking up chicks, much less one he's loved half his life, it wouldn't be terribly in character to write him delivering smooth pick-ups.
The editing is by far the biggest problem - it's choppy and rushed, barely leaving you time to invest yourself emotionally into one scene before they move on to the next one.  In terms of character development, Padme also suffered something of a loss to the cutting-room floor, as many of the included deleted scenes show.  Ben Burtt (who helped edit the film) may be a fine sound editor, but not a film editor.  The love story in particular suffers most from the editing, but is still passable and on multiple viewings, enjoyable for me.  It's fittingly awkward for what it is - two romantically inexperienced people falling in love who know they shouldn't be.
But all else aside, it's a very rich and lush bit of filmmaking.  Almost any single shot from this movie you could take and find it filled with symbolic, mythological, and other visual nuances - homages to the myths Lucas has drawn from, as well as to the other SW films.  (Take the shot of Anakin meditating on the balcony, for example - a striking homage to his future as Vader, as well as moody and beautiful in its composition.  Or the very final shot of Anakin, Padme, and the droids facing the sunset and an uncertain future - very reminiscent of the ending shot of their children and the droids at the end of The Empire Strikes Back.)  Perhaps the most wonderful thing about the SW films, AotC included, is how richly layered they are: you could be on the 20th viewing of this film and still be discovering details you never noticed before.  It makes the films even more enjoyable.
The acting: acceptable with both good and bad moments on Natalie's part (her performance is almost *too* subtle and is almost swallowed in the sensory overload that a SW film always is), solid on Ewan's, and (albeit with a couple of small iffy patches) absolutely stunning on Hayden's.  I see criticisms of Hayden as ""wooden,"" which I'm surprised anyone can make after seeing Anakin's chilling, passioned confession of the Tusken massacre to Padme.  What others see as ""wooden"" I see as the demeanor of a Jedi (which *is* supposed to be emotionally detached), and the spot-on mannerisms of the Sith Lord to come.  Watch how he walks, listen to the inflections in his voice.  It's Vader, minus the mask.  Hints of even Jake Lloyd's Anakin are visible in moments like ""I'm good at fixing things - always was.""  I think sometimes people confuse the dialogue with the actor himself - you can't blame the actor for the dialogue he has to speak.  Far as Anakin's ""whininess,"" I don't see how that's any worse than Luke's in ANH and frankly, considering Anakin's had a lot more troubled adolescence than Luke, Anakin's is actually a bit more justified.
Really, Anakin's whole character in this film flows seamlessly from TPM - and you can see the now-even-more prominent hints of what's going to lead him to his future as Darth Vader.  Excellent character writing - which fits, as SW is his story.  There are other wonderful bits of foreshadowing in this film, such as the visit to the Lars' Homestead and the Death Star cameo - they really help to tie the films even closer together.
The FX are top-notch - the speeder chase, the backdrops of Naboo are rich and complex, and the Kaminoans and clonetroopers are stunningly lifelike in detail.  The Battle of Geonosis is also impressive (if a little lengthy), although the single shot of AotC that most wows me is looking out at the endless marching rows of clone troopers on Coruscant at the end.  It's completely computer generated, but you're no less in awe over the sheer magnitude and spectacle of it.
Also impressive is the score of John Williams, especially the perfect-for-the Anakin/Padme-relationship love theme, although you can hear on the CD soundtrack how unfortunately butchered parts of it were for the final cut, especially in the Geonosis battle, to include recycled music from TPM.
The DVD itself is a treat with the deleted scenes, razor-sharp colors and clarity of the film itself, which has a few small but well-placed additional scenes/scene bits.  I do wish they'd gone the route of multiple commentaries like the LotR DVD instead of just the one - frankly, I'd rather hear Lucas's comments on the shaping of the love pledge scene than the tech guys babbling on about how that scene is the beginning of Reel 6.  The featurettes are enjoyable, if not quite as much as ""The Beginning"" one of Episode I... but overall, the extras are definitely worth it.  As a film and a DVD, it's definitely one of the favorites of my collection.",1073001600,8,5785,4.713008937437935

1313946,5,B00003CXKT,"Whenever a new Star Wars movie comes out, it is a gigantic media event that draws responses and opinions from all over the world, online and off.  Any single review is likely to be only a drop in the ocean of thousands of opinions already written; for what it's worth, here's mine.

  Episode II had to be one of the most unfairly maligned and brutally trashed movies in recent memory.  I won't claim to be a professional movie critic (and I hope I never sink to that level...), but for me, AOTC was one of the most purely, entertainingly FUN movies to come out in the summer of 2002, and I still feel the same way some 18 months later -- even after seeing a certain other high-profile fantasy trilogy that has been dominating the headlines; though I love both movie series, I see no point in comparing them against each other.

  A major difference between the Star Wars prequel trilogy and the original trilogy is that in the original series, the good guys and bad guys, and their agendas, were clearly defined; whereas in the new series, things are a lot murkier and uncertain, with less discernable motives and more behind-the-scenes plotting and manipulating, reflecting the chaos rampant in the waning days of the Galactic Republic as it spirals towards the tragic events that lead to the classic trilogy storyline.  It is probably inevitable that some will find the films about the lead-up to the Galactic Civil War less interesting and compelling than those about the grand conflict itself.

  As for Ep. II itself, it is an enjoyable audio/visual feast for the senses, and a thrill ride that reminded me of why I liked Star Wars to begin with.  It is also, after the somewhat disappointing Phantom Menace, a return to form for Lucas & Co. that, if it doesn't quite reach the heights of the original trilogy, at least gets the saga back on track. (One thing I don't understand is why Ep. II is constantly lumped together with Ep. I as ""the terrible prequels"", when II is actually light-years beyond I.)  There will probably never be another ""Empire Strikes Back"", but so what?  AOTC is still an enjoyable picture in its own right -- it's much faster-paced, action-packed, and tighter than its immediate predecessor, and is much closer to the spirit and feel of, and ties in better with, the original series.  Ewan McGregor really comes into his own as Obi-Wan Kenobi here, and Christopher Lee's Count Dooku is a stellar addition to SW's pantheon of villains.  And the action sequences, from the speeder chase through the Coruscant skyline to the massive Battle of Geonosis, are nothing short of spectacular.  The best, though, has to be the stunning arena sequence, featuring an army of battle droids, 3 very large, ugly and nasty monsters, hundreds of light sabre-wielding Jedi Knights, and even a hapless, bumbling C-3PO, all in a giant, rousing battle scene that is one of the best to appear in ANY SW film; if this sequence doesn't get your blood going, you're either dead, or a movie critic.

  Speaking of which, the film has taken a lot of heat from critics who apparently consider George Lucas the Antichrist, from so-called ""fanboys"" who are perpetually angry that Lucas doesn't take their ""advice"" on how to make his films, and from others in the so-called ""hipster"" circles.  These people are missing the point.  No, the movie isn't perfect -- the pace drags a couple of times in the beginning, the acting in some scenes can be stiff and/or corny, and the romance between Anakin and Padme does come off as awkward at times -- as if Lucas wasn't sure how to do it without turning off action fans with all that ""mushy stuff"". (A couple of the deleted scenes from the DVD, had they been left in the film, would have made this part of the movie more convincing.)  However, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman at least look good in the romantic scenes, and despite what some say, they do NOT sink the entire movie.  As for the acting and dialogue, there is very little about it that has not been said before about the entire SW saga.  People seem to forget that Star Wars has never been a hipster's movie; despite its cutting edge special effects and production values, it has always been one of the most ""unhip"" and ""uncool"" series around.  SW has always been more pulp than literate; more about exciting the primal emotions than engaging the intellect; and more concerned with old-fashioned melodrama and fairy-tale stories than with deep, sophisticated character-driven narratives aimed at a cynical, ""hip"" audience.

  In any case, if some people must trash an entire movie on the basis of a few lines or scenes, or cannot let go of their preconceptions and enjoy a movie as entertaining as this one, well...too bad for them.  I enjoyed AOTC, and cannot wait for the next installment, when the entire story arc of Star Wars will be revealed; and hopefully Lucas, and the entire prequel trilogy, will be vindicated.",1072828800,5,4935,4.730140186915888

1313948,5,B00003CXKT,"I keep hearing a lot of bitching and moaning about how AOTC had the worst lines ever, the acting was horrible, blah blah blah... and in a sense, it is true, but NOT in the sense that you're thinking. It's not Hayden's dialog and acting that suck, it's Anakin's. Confused? Don't worry, I can explain. You see, Jedi apprentices probably don't watch much TV. As such, a guy like Anakin isn't going to be a smooth operator; he's going to come up with lame pick-up lines and fumble them horribly. Of course, Padme will be totally nervous and unsure what to make of this situation, so nothing that she responds with will sound convincing. This is exactly what happens, and the roles were done so convincingly that people thought it was Lucas and Hayden screwing up! I can say this safely, because when Hayden and Natalie aren't making googly eyes at each other, their lines and acting totally kick arse. I was particularly blown away by Anakin's search for his mother, and his subsequent massacre of the sand people and re-telling of the story to Padme. And she just sits there, staring at him and thinking ""Holy CRAP does this guy have issues!"" While the love story isn't totally perfect and the romp through the flowers was WAY over the top, George strikes a very critical truth that no one else ever does: we sometimes fall in love when we REALLY don't want to, and it flat-out SUCKS to be in love with the wrong person - but when we do, we can't hide and supress our emotions forever, and then things get REALLY messy.
While the rampant abuse of CGI is a negative, it's not exactly restricted to this movie - it's just done better here than in most movies.
Throw in a complicated and intriguing (though totally incomprehensible) plot invloving Boba Fett and an army of clones, and you have a pretty good movie - in my opinion, the best of the bunch.",1072569600,5,1847,4.516417910447761
1314071,3,B00003CXKT,I liked the bloke. How can you take this movie seriously when its science fiction. To be honest it needed someone like him to lighten up the fairytale. He certainly don't have many fans out there but I'm one. Too many people take this stuff seriously. This is OK but episode 1 is better.,1072569600,,287,4.333333333333333
1314072,5,B00003CXKT,"Ep. 2 is what Ep. 1 should have been but we must remember that Lucas had not directed a film in eons and probably the challange of a new star wars movie did create more than just a few problems for him. If we treat Ep. 1 as just a setup movie for Ep. 2 and Ep. 3 then we can forgive him but as a stand alone movie Ep. 1 blows. Ep. 2 however does everything in aces and George does here what he should have done since the start - LISTEN TO WHAT HIS FANS WANT!
So with Ep. 2 George does the impossible, he dashes all our wounds from Ep. 1 by giving us a remarkable installment in the series. Seeing Yoda command Storm Troopers into battle just makes your jaw hit the ground and when he does his *thing* fans will wet themselves in total *glee*. The end battle sequence sets new standards in CGI and the story is now MOVING in the direction that we wanted it to go. Yes, this is a great star wars prequel and is only topped by Ep. IV and Ep. V but is leaps and bounds ahead of Ep. VI and Ep. I but we have the feeling that George has left the best till last. No doubt if the curve here is anything to go by we should all feel very happy with Lucas et co in the end.",1072569600,,1162,3.8257261410788383
1314073,5,B00003CXKT,"Everyone seemed to like this movie when it first came out, and then the critics started panning it like they did episode I. All of a sudden everyone was dissing episode II. I have a different take altogether.
This is the movie we dreamed about when we heard of the heyday of the Jedi and the clone wars in A New Hope. This movie is awesome.
Yes, Anakin pouts and spouts too much, but go back and watch the original series. Star Wars has always been about B-movie dialogue blended with A-movie action and special effects. No movie in the Star Wars saga should ever be nominated for an Academy Award. The series is not about that. It is about a rag-tag band of B-actors doing something that gives all of us ordinary folks out there hope about the future. People talk about this movie as though it should have been made in the style of The English Patient. C'mon people this is Star Wars! Get real. This movie is as good as it gets. The build up to the clone wars...the mingling of the Imperial March with the music from episode I. The political intrigue...the love affair. This stuff is buliding up to the most anticipated battle between good and evil of all time.
Episode II is an awesome movie. It is a vast improvement over Episode I (which was not as bad as people now say). I'm appalled that so many die-hard Star Wars fans are falling for the bulls*&t put out by the critics.
The Bottom Line: I left the theater after Ep. II seriously questioning whether or not I could make it the three years until Ep. III. Every time I've been to a movie since, I've sat in anticipation of a preview glimpse of Ep. III. Weak movies don't create that type of anticipation. I'm sure if most of you diehard fans are honest with yourselves and listen to your hearts instead of the numbskull critics you know you agree.
Episode II was great Star Wars movie-making and on May 25, 2005 Episode III will end the saga in a way that the critics won't like, but that all of us will understand is 'just right'.",1072224000,4,1988,4.361185983827493
1314074,5,B00003CXKT,"This one's so much better than EP1. Again, the minor irritation is the nincompoop Jar Jar Binks. I don't know why they kept this bad joke. He is an awfully lame comic relief character. I was more enthralled by Master Yoda, as the movie delves more into this interesting character as he teaches the very young Jedi children. He's also in numerous scenes as the sort of main general of the old republic fighting force. Yoda's fight scene with the politician was spectacular. It should have been extended 1 or 2 minutes more. After seeing this movie, you'll have gained a more healthier respect for Yoda.",1072137600,,601,4.679245283018868
1314075,2,B00003CXKT,"Despite foisting the crime of Episode I on the public a few years ago, I was sure that George Lucas would mend the severed ties and get back into the swing of things with Episode II.  After all, the greatest goal-scorers in hockey don't stay in slumps for too long, and great filmakers are allowed a mistake here and there.

I eagerly anticipated this movie and saw it on opening night and again the next day.  Since then I have watched it DVD and cable to see if there was anything that I could have possibly missed, just for Mr. Lucas' sake.  Sadly, I can now confirm that this movie has little to no redeeming qualities.

As always the movie starts with the outer space crawl, one constant in all five films that still gets my blood pumping.  And the movie again opens with teriffic beginning scenes, first on the platform and then through the streets (?) of Coruscant.  With such a racing 20 minutes feeding me adrenaline, I was ready for the next two hours.  Then I wanted to do something else.

As soon as Anakin and the Queen break off on their own, the movie sinks like Iron Man with concrete shoes thrown into the ocean.  Obi-Wan's plotline involving Jango Fett is infinitely fascinating, but it's paid little to no regard in the film.  Etirely too much time is spent breaking away to Anakin and Amidala, but we already know what's going to happen with them so why do we need to see the drawn-out backstory?  There is no reason why that should consume so much screen time.

We have a character who we know is going to become Darth Vader through his contact with Palpatine, but they are on screen together for only a few seconds.  Why not show how his mind has been poisoned by the Senator?  That plotline, if it had been developed, might have single-handedly saved the movie.

There are many quarrels and quips that could be tacked on to this movie, but anyone who has seen the movie knows what I'm talking about.  All I am trying to do is vent my frustration about the last five years in the Star Wars universe.  If you have read this far I congratulate you, and now I will go pop in a copy of Empire to soothe the pain.  I suggest you do the same.",1072051200,3,2158,4.35
1314076,3,B00003CXKT,"With the possible exception of EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, none of the STAR WARS movies stand on their own. STAR WARS (theatrically released without the EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE subtitle because it was never meant to have a sequel) is Kurosawa-lite and loaded with cheesy dialogue and two-dimensional characters taken straight from the 1950's serial matinees that George Lucas idolized. (The swashbuckling pirate, the feisty princess, the evil ruler) and some Joseph Campbell thrown in (the boy-farmer who becomes a man-hero).
EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is perhaps the best of the original trilogy and has the lionshare of the best dialogue and acting (what did they do to Mark Hamill to make him sound so convincing in that Cloud City scene?) and really, feels like a ""serious"" movie without all the Ewoks and Gungans. Nobody is surprised that George Lucas, with his fascination for commercialism and short creatures (see Duck, Howard the), had less to do with this film than all the others.
RETURN OF THE JEDI is loaded with Muppet Show rejects and walking teddy bears but it is a satisfying conclusion to what amounts to a great saga. It was a movie that HAD to be done, with or without Ewoks!
I consider THE PHANTOM MENACE to be an abberation and not part of the STAR WARS saga. It neither adds nor detracts anything from the other movies. Darth Vader is a little boy, for goodness sake. He had lots of time to become the Dark Lord of the Sith.
And then we get to ATTACK OF THE CLONES. You've got to give Lucas and co. credit for trying to make a serious film this time around. They almost succeeded in recreating the tragic-love angle from ESB. Almost. Neither Natalie Portman or Hayden Christensen looks particularly interested in the love scenes. Hayden in particular seems to be trying to hard to be ""Anakin-Vader"".
The battle scenes are quite impressive in ATOC. The three-pronged assault in TPM was bogged down by silliness (boomers??) and an anti-climatic ending (Darth Maul had 15 minutes screen-time at best and his, err, coming apart is supposed to matter?) But there's STILL TOO MANY DAMN DROIDS IN EPISODE II!!! The producers tried feverishly to avoid the dreaded PG-13 rating in both films by cutting down on the number of human casualties. But they did so at the expense of some credibility.
All I can say is, EPISODE III better be worth the wait or EPISODES II won't stand the test of time that distinguishes a great movie from just another blockbuster.",1072051200,3,2456,4.767605633802817
1314077,3,B00003CXKT,"Episode II, while a hell of a lot better than Episode I, was nothing in terms of the original trilogy.
I think, and it seems almost everyone agrees with me, that the script was bad.  The dialogue in a lot of the scenes should have been rewritten.  Like that scene where Anakin is having the nightmare about his mother, that looks more like he's having a wet dream about Padme.
The battle scenes were good, but I just hope GL doesn't do another asteroid chase in Episode III.  Special effects were great, most of the time the CGI stuff looks real.  That's why I gave it three stars.
I have to admit that my favorite scene in the entire film was near the end when Palpatine & Co are looking off the balcony at the thousands of Clone troopers and the ships taking off for the war.
The one thing that I noticed in the film that's a discrepency, specially if you're a Star Wars nut like me, is that the Imperial emblem is painted on the side of Obi-Wan's fighter.  If you watch the original trilogy, it's painted on the uniforms of the Tie fighter pilots.

Hayden Christensen (Anakin) is by far the worst actor.  He is supposed to be Dark, a Jedi on the Edge, the future Dark Lord and all you want to do is give a swirly to this whiner!  There is no chemestry between him and Padme.  His big scene where he slaughters a sand people camp does not even shock you.  He just whines.
I would take Jar Jar over Hayden at this point!
Christopher Lee and Ewan are about the only saving parts of this wannabe film.  Padme was ok but not too exciting.
The fight between Yoda and Dooku is intresting but that is about it.
As with the last film, George creates an interesting villian(jango fett) and of course kills him off.
I have extreamly low expectations for the next installment and the sad thing is that I have read that George is talking about pasting a scared up Hayden in the Return of the Jedi.

1314156,2,B00003CXKT,"The bad parts of this movie overwhelm the good parts. The worst is the love story: Two mediocre actors reading awkward dialogue in three or four settings. None of the scenes are convincing. One or two make you cringe. Then there's the confusion of the plot, leading to a number of action scenes that aren't necessary. (Did they have to run around on the robot conveyor belt? It looks like a video game.) The actors are stiff because they appear to be reacting to CG creatures. Finally, the story takes the main characters to too many locations. By the end, you wonder which planet they are on and why they're there.
Of course, there are a few good things about the movie. The climax is amazing --- a combination of light saber duels and a science fiction war. (Somehow, Yoda is the center of both of these sequences.) The creatures, spaceships, and locations are wonderfully designed. The colosseum of the insect creatures looks like it was carved out of a hive. The three beasts the heroes fight in that scene are amazing (in their appearance and the way they move), the clone-making aliens look great, and each landscape and vehicle is unique and detailed. Ewan McGregor is also good --- every scene he's in is worth watching, simply because he's such an accomplished actor. It's a treat to see him do an impression of a rain-soaked Alec Guiness while he talks to an alien creature that wasn't even there at the moment his parts were filmed.
In the end, you can't give this movie more than two stars, because so much good will was squandered. Every sequel to a blockbuster has a built-in audience, but Star Wars was always different. The fans wanted to relive the thrill of the first two movies with a return to the saga.

The rest of the movie however should be allowed to exist only as a cautionary tale for future directors.

  To be honest, it's probably a little too colourful - sort of special effects overload.  They probably could have spent less money on spectacular effects and a little more on story development.
  This film lacks the emotional force that the first two Star Wars films had.  Those films you could really feel with the characters and care about them.  I couldn't give a toss about Anakin in this film.  In fact, I found him seriously annoying.  He is constantly whining and complaining and needs a good backhander from Obi-Wan every few minutes!  How Padme could stand a bar of him is beyond me.  He says at one point ""You are asking me to be rational, and that is something I cannot be"" - well der!!!  I don't think he was rational for a single minute during the entire film.  He is childish and egocentric.  He does not come across as any kind of real hero.  It is fine for a hero to be flawed - even endearing in the case of Han Solo, with the sort of rogueish ""I'm out for myself"" attitude.  You knew that he had a heart underneath it all. The combination of the two made him an interesting and likeable character.  Anakin is driven by his emotion.  As someone mentioned to me, if Anakin didn't have his power, he wouldn't be anything at all.
On the other hand, Ewan McGregor does very well in the role of Obi-Wan, as he did in The Phantom Menace.  You can believe in his performance - you can see it tying in quite well with the original trilogy.  He seems to do best on his own, but enough of how bad a student Anakin is.

I also found the story quite confusing.  It is not clear cut who are the good guys and who are the bad, which is one of several reasons why the film lacks the emotional power of the first two.  There are many unanswered questions by the end of the film, leaving you feeling dissatisfied.  I'm all for mystery and for puzzles to resolve in the third episode, but gaining a strong impulse to exclaim ""This doesn't make any sense!"" is probably not a good indicator of a film's success in telling a story.
The movie seemed to lack much of a story.  The same could be said for Phantom Menace as well.  I get the impression both movies are simply the preliminary for what everyone knows needs to happen in the third film.",1069891200,,2385,4.315315315315315

1314162,4,B00003CXKT,"After The Phantom Menace, I was dragged into the cinema with something less than enthusiasm to see this movie. I watched as the computer graphics dominated over the story, and I watched as the plot bounced around without knowing where it wanted to go; I watched as scenes from The Sound of Music were spliced into the narrative, and I winced as some of the worst lines of dialogue ever written were spoken by the actors as if they meant it. The love scenes between Hayden Christenson and Natalie Portman failed to ignite enough sparks to light a tanker full of petroleum - I could not believe that George Lucas had not learned from his mistakes.
But then I realised something - I was really enjoying it! And before long, I was feeling that old thrill every time someone pulled out a light saber. Loathe as I was to admit it, I loved it. The movie is filled with stand-out moments, with 'cool' bits that stick in your mind - Obi Wan jumping through a window a thousand storeys up, Anakin fighting with two light sabers, Yoda turning into a flying squirrel - Lucas has obviously given a lot of thought to what people liked about the first series and about what they wanted to see, and then gave us those things in spades. There are even laugh-out-loud moments, such as a scene in a bar in which Obi Wan repeats his brainwashing act from 'A New Hope' for comedic effect.
There are still problems, obviously, but Lucas has also taken on board many of the criticisms of the last film - Jar Jar Binks' role was kept to a blissful five minutes, there were ten times more tie-ins with the later (or earlier) films, and there are few truly 'childish' moments. Overall, it is a vast improvement over the previous movie, and certainly deserving of a much wider audience. Although one question has always irked me throughout these films - if Yoda is such a genius, why can't he structure his sentences properly?",1068422400,,1899,4.523255813953488

1314164,4,B00003CXKT,"I put off writing anything on this movie for a long time.  I have watched it numerous times and each time I come away with very mixed emotions.  It's a fun time, but there is just something....lacking.  The problem is to pin point where this movie fails.
It succeeds on many levels.  Ewan McGregor has quickly matured into the Obiwan role, making young Obiwan his own as Alex Guinness made it his in the first ones.  Christopher Lee is as powerful (Wow I hope I am that brilliant and active at 80!!).  His talents shine, even though he does not have enough screen time since he is one of the strongest forces (excuse the pun!) in the movie.  Natalie Portman - ladies, don't you want to kill her!! - she is SO BEAUTIFUL and just keeps getting more so!!  She does very well as the maturing Padm&eacute; Amidala, though her performance is often hurt by rather poor dubbing.  One would think with ILM at his beck and call that Lucas would not have settled for the poor quality of dubbing on such a costly film.  It was almost as if they did not care.  Samuel Jackson as Mace Windu is really a waste of his strong talents.  Where the move really is weak is with the central figure:  young Skywalker - and possibly that is not all his fault.  Hayden Christensen tries very hard, but over all fails to evoke the power that the rising Darth Vader would.  Somehow, when Darth uttered those famous words ""Luke, I am your father.""  the series had been in trouble!!  He fails to really convince me something as charming and gorgeous as Padm&eacute; would be entranced by this character.  And his LINES!!  I am sorry, the words he utters her to convince her of his love just sounds SO HOKEY!!
Problems, aside, I still enjoy this movie, enough to keep watching it. Ewan McGregor does super work in his fight scenes and the special effect are MARVELLOUS.  His battle with the bounty hunter in the rain was brilliant.  And hey Yoda throwing down with light sager on Chris Lee is worth the ticket - hehehee!  Sheer fun.
It's just Star Wars came along when everyone was ""young"" in the new realm of Light and Magic.  The special effects of Clones is super, but Lucian needs to learn more about his characters FLESH them out and make the audience BELIEVE and CARE for them.
So go in expecting to see old friends, wowing special effects, but come away slightly sad more attention to the actors and better writing was not employed to make this as good as the original.",1068336000,,2446,4.45945945945946
1314267,2,B00003CXKT,"I have a few things to say about this movie (and the less would be said the better), here they are:
1. Good ole Lucas completely succmbed to the mainstream of ""Dungeons & Dragons"" movie and such rubbish.
2. There are a lot of talented scriptwriters (Tracy R. Hickman (""Dragonlance"" series), Chris Metzen (""Warcraft"",""Starcraft"" storylines)),why Gl hasn't chosen them to write the script for this miserable movie?? Script grade: 0.1.
3. The love story gave a good impression of ""dark, forbidden love"" but the acting was the worse I ever seen. Acting grade:0.000000000001.
4. The only actor who actually saves the movie is Christopher Lee (cheers to Saruman and count Dracula) playing count Dooku. CHRISTOPHER LEE RULZ!!!
5. I symathize lord Sith (and Darth Maul+Count Dooku) for trying to wipe out all these pesky psychotic would be ""dark lords"" (aka Anakin Skywalker), idiotic senators who fall in love with the would be ""dark lords"" (aka Padme), stupid amphibians who even don't know to how speak proper english (Jar Jar STINKS (a lot)) and even more stupid Jedi Knights (aka Obi-Wan).
6. Give me a StarCraft movie instead.
7. The love scenes were worse than in ""Titanic"".
8. If you don't believe me that ""Attack of the Clones' is the worst movie in the world, go watch it... But beware of the psychologic trauma that might occur to you after seeing so bad a movie.",1068249600,15,1366,4.8418803418803416

A bad script can often be brought to life, as is proved over and again with actors and directors of real talent. Alas, no such people here. The leads should donate their salaries to the Actors' Home and go back to their Burger King jobs.
I don't mind being fooled -- it's part of the movie aesthetic. But deafening computer-generated effects at lightning speed are not remotely believable. Whoever invented these effects should be locked for a month in a blindingly lit room with plastic food.
It's been argued that the Star Wars films are intended not as realism but as comic books. Well, the original Alec Guinness-Harrison Ford offering was in many ways extremely realistic. For another thing, it was superbly acted. And the script, despite major weaknesses, was full of tongue-in-cheek wit.

1314270,4,B00003CXKT,"Before I wrote this review, Attack of the Clones was just finishing on Cinemax. I saw it in theatres when it first came out, and saw it on video twice after that. I don't exactly know why I watched it all those times, because I found it annoying and not as good as everyone made it out to be.
However, this year changed it around for me. I tried to find reasons to hate this movie to bring up debates with my Star Wars loving friends.  Yes there are a few indiscretions and such that I find pointless, but it is a good movie to pass the time with, something I didn't want to admit the first few times I sat through it. Sure the acting can be stiff as a board at times, and the dialogue made me burst out in laughter on many occasions, yet I stuck it out and feel partially addicted to Star Wars once again. I feel like I'm twelve again, remembering the time when the originals were remastered and put into theatres.
Along with an enjoyable way to spend a few hours in college, Star Wars ignites my imagination and I have produced so many good papers, drawings, topics, etc. all because I was willing to escape reality...in a galaxy far, far away...while eating Domino's...intoxicated.
I guess the point I am trying to make is this. Star Wars is nostalgia for me. I can't hate the series, even though I tried so very hard to hate Clones, because the series as grown on me ever since I was 2. I recommend everybody see it at least once. Give in to your guilty pleasures. A side note to those who write negative reviews or hate the movie: If I can change my perspective (and I seriously thought this was pitiful until I saw it by chance on Cinemax), I am sure you can as well.
However, if the movie is still on your s**t list, you can always sit around with a close group of friends, drink Skyy Vodka, and pretend you are on Mystery Science Theater 3000 with Tom Servo, Crow, and Mike making fun of this flick like there is no tomorrow!

Bien, empecemos esta crtica.
He ledo muchsimas crticas negativas y ultra-venenosas hacia este hermoso film. Crticas que no entiendo, of course. Un guin coherente, actuaciones decentes, otras no tanto (Hayden... aunque podra haberlo hecho peor...), efectos especiales realmente INCREBLES, y YODA PELEANDO. SSSSSSIIIIIIIII!!!!! Lo que los fans siempre quisieron ver...
Tanto Episode I, como esta que nos compete, Episode II, son dos pelculas fantsticas. Tal vez Episode I es un tanto naif, pero es entretenida. Me parece que hay cosas que la mayora no entiende: las precuelas se sitan en un contexto MUY diferente al de la Triloga Original. No vas a encontrar a Han Solo. se personaje es nico. Apuesto mi vida a que si George Lucas hubiese puesto un personaje similar, todos se hubieran quejado porque ese personaje sera un calco de Han. Estoy seguro. El contexto de las precuelas es diferente. Slo Episode III se va a acercar un poco a la OT, pero tampoco va a revivirla. No estamos ante pelculas parecidas estilsticamente, por eso se las diferencia en trilogas. La OT es mucho mas concisa en cuanto al plot: la Rebelin quiere deshacerse del Imperio, y devolverle la paz a la galaxia. Bastante simple. En cambio, las precuelas abordan muchos ms temas, y se hace un tanto ms complicado contarlas. El tema del Elegido, de los planes secretos que tiene Darth ""Palpatine"" Sidious"", las Guerras Clnicas, etc. Adems, es Star Wars. Seamos honestos. En Episode I, la pelea de Qui-Gon y Obi-Wan contra Darth Maul es una de las mejores escenas del cine de todos los tiempos. Asi que, me parece, habra que dejar de lado un poco esa comparacin con la OT (aunque, a esta altura, es un tanto intil pretender eso).

1314272,2,B00003CXKT,"My interest in Star Wars is rather casual.  I'll watch the movies in theaters, but not with the massive expectations so many people have.  Truth be told, the only film in the series to truly impress me on virtually every level was The Empire Strikes Back (Star Wars was great fun as well, though with weaker dialogue and acting than ESB).  But movies like these are rare, these big-budget slices of escapism that harken back to the old days of Saturday matinee serials, only with (much) higher production values and (in this case, marginally) better acting.  Damn, I seriously can't wait for Indiana Jones 4.
I actually looked forward to Attack of the Clones.  The premise offered more opportunities, the special effects would be slicker than ever, and surely, even George Lucas could have improved his writing skills after the results we saw in Phantom Menace.  But in the end, it's not much of an improvement over Menace, in fact, I'm not even sure it's an improvement at all.  Despite the occasional energetic effort behind the camera, Attack of the Clones is mostly lifeless, pedestrian, and boring.
It starts off quite well, with a failed assassination attempt on Senator Amidala's (Natalie Portman) life.  For protection, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan Mcgregor) and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are assigned as her bodyguards.  If you'll recall, Anakin had a bit of a crush on Amidala in Phantom Menace and nothing has changed the ten years since.  Anyway, another assassination attempt on Amidala fails yet again, with Kenobi and Anakin hot on the heels of the would-be assassin.  This leads to a spectacular speeder chase that puts the similar sequence in The Fifth Element to complete shame.  So far, so good.
But whatever hopes I had for the movie were shattered soon afterward, when the film's core plot, the love story, became the central focus.  I'm actually a sucker for a good ""forbidden love"" romance; I loved Titanic, enjoyed Sabrina, and even found myself mildly won over by Fools Rush In.  But the love story here is so dull, it bears nothing in the way of vitality or genuine chemistry.  It's like watching a brother and sister kiss (disturbing memories of Leia and Luke's kiss are all flooding back in).
Though Christensen and Portman fail to strike any sparks, it's not entirely their faults.  George Lucas and Jonathan Hales' dialogue is horribly silly, there's actually a scene where Anakin compares and contrasts Amidala with sand, of all things.  The culmination of Amidala's declaration of love for Anakin doesn't feel right, especially since it comes so soon after his murderous actions, which she apparently forgets almost immediately after he confesses to her.
Christensen is an actor with maybe a kernel of potential.  I've never seen Life as a House, but I keep hearing a lot of good things about him.  As Anakin, he displays many of the qualities we expect: he's arrogant, hot-headed, rash, and temperamental.  Christensen's delivery of the dialogue could easily lead one to assume that he's a no-talent pretty boy actor, but it's a bit more complex than that.  Lucas' dialogue almost never does him any favors, even if the script does give him the opportunity to expand his ever-growing hostile personality.  That the Jedi council doesn't pay more attention to him is a bit of a mystery, they know the kid's got potential (that's an understatement if I ever heard one), but even when he slaughters an entire tribe of Tusken raiders, he's not even berated for such actions (to be fair, it's not like he told anyone, though Yoda clearly sensed his feelings during the massacre).
Natalie Portman is a proven talent, but much like Christensen, you could never guess it from her performance.  She gives it her best try, but to no avail, coming off as one-dimensional, basically a perfectly safe role model for young girls everywhere without the slightest hint of flaw in her noble personality.  It's a portrayal of cartoonish decency, written as only George Lucas could have.
Like The Empire Strikes Back, the story splits into two narratives.  Sharing screen time with the love story is Obi-Wan Kenobi's investigation of the assassination attempts.  Hercule Poirot (or Indiana Jones, for that matter, who proved quite the clever historian at putting together clues to find his sacred artifact), he is not.  Piecing together clues is obviously not Kenobi's forte.  The script goes out of its way to make him look like an idiot (and the people he's investigating even bigger idiots!); take for instance, the scene where he finds no trace of a star system in the planetary archives, and has to inquire Yoda and a class of padewan learners why it's not on the map (duh, it was removed).
His investigation leads him to the water-logged planet of Kamino.  This is by far the most visually stimulating of the film's newly introduced worlds (too bad it's all glanced over).  The Kaminoans live on ports supported in the same way an oil rig would be, only presumably in a far more complex manner, given the size of these habitats.
Kenobi discovers a clone army that was apparently ordered by a Jedi master named Sifo-Diyas, except the guy's been dead for ten years.  The army was cloned from bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), whose New Zealand accent leads me to believe there's a planet full of Australians somewhere in that galaxy.
This converging storyline is only somewhat more interesting than the love story, but at least it sets up a couple of reasonably cool (albeit very short) action sequences, including Kenobi's hair-raising battle with Fett and an asteroid chase that'll remind many of The Empire Strikes Back.  Ewan Mcgregor is a fine actor, easily the best of the film's leads, so you at least get the joy of watching this guy emulate Alec Guinness almost perfectly.
Attack of the Clones is a much darker picture than Phantom Menace, but not necessarily any better as a result.  The pacing here is almost as weak (in both films, we have fun bookending sequences and an elongated boring middle segment) and the climactic action sequences (six of them in the last thirty-five minutes!) are something of a mixed bag.
My attention snapped back when the film suddenly came to life around the hour fifty-minute mark with a knockout battle sequence between several Jedi and hundreds of droids inside a massive coliseum.  This setpiece boasts the film's most rousing scene, a scuffle between Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson, one of my faves, but clearly acting from a script beneath his talents), Jango Fett, and a giant rhino-like creature.  The creature first charges at Windu, then charges at Fett, and finally there's a spectacularly rousing showdown between Windu and Fett that had my blood boiling.  Damn, I wish this film had more moments like that.
The succeeding action sequences don't fare as well, particularly the lightsaber duel between Anakin and evil Count Dooku (played well by Christopher Lee), which is quite a few steps backward from the climactic duel in Phantom Menace.  Without the athletic moves of Ray Park, it's basically an eighty-year old man swinging a big stick of light at a twenty-year old, pretty boy actor.
The film's silly title sparked a lot of arguments from defensive Star Wars fans (one friend of mine actually defended the title by saying it was good because it informed us what the plot would be covering) (that is, without a doubt, the lamest reasoning I've ever heard regarding the quality of a movie's title).  But Lucas said he named the movie this way as an ode to the Saturday Matinee serials the film was inspired by.  Contrasting this with Lucas' Indiana Jones trilogy, it's quite clear virtually all of that series' high quality was the result of Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford, and John Williams.  Lucas proves he can't craft a rousing adventure and not even Williams' rousing score can change that.

1314273,1,B00003CXKT,"Based on Lucas' intentions alone, this has to be the worst film I have ever endured in my entire life.
The only comfort I found in witnessing the juvenile and grossly unbelievable events of Anakin's turn to the dark side was Hayden's woeful acting, and equally cliched dialogue. ""I don't like sand - it's rough and coarse, and gets everywhere. Not like here"". What the?????
But the crux of the film, the romance between Anakin and Padme, is so, so unconvincing that it completely destroys the entire premise of the movie. Where was the attraction between these two 'lovers'? How could Padme have fallen so easily for someone who is essentially emotionally retarded? Oh sorry, I guess I missed it amongst all those overblown CGI sets and effects.
And that's really the point here. LUCAS GIVES THE ACTORS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO WORK WITH, besides a blue screen and some of the worst dialogue to invade our DVD players. The short shoot time (something like 6 weeks) shows that Lucas cared more about his special effects team than he did producing thoughtful and emotional performances from his actors. I can just imagine Hayden delivering his somewhat spasm-like performance for the scene after he killed the sand people in just one take, with Lucas exclaiming in an almost Ed Wood like glee ""Cut - that's perfect!""
I mean come on. Watch Hayden struggle with the line - ""I killed them. I killed them all. And not just the men, I killed the women, and the children!"" Don't blame Hayden, the fault lies with the director/writer, and Lucas has the dubious honor of being both.
To top it all off the CGI doesn't even look that good. When the opening scene played out, I was sure I was watching some low tech FMV from a 1995 PC CD-ROM computer game. The actors LOOK LIKE they're in front of a blue screen on a sound stage, and that my friends, is unforgivable. Why Lucas has such a fatal attraction to CGI is unfathomable considering the live action magic that occured in Episodes 4,5 and 6.
And don't for a second think that this film is better than the Phantom Menace. That film was bad, but this is far, far worse. The length of Attack of the Clones certainly underpins this.
Bottom line, this film is devoid of soul or substance - Lucas has really outdone himself on this one, in turn obliterating the legacy of a truly legendary trilogy. Attack of the Clones is 2 and a half hours of cliched utter trite.",1066867200,14,2400,4.596736596736597

1314420,3,B00003CXKT,"To me, ""Attack of the Clones"" was neither Great nor Terrible. I went expecting some pretty lights, some good fight scenes, and basically dumb, fun entertainment. Though the movie has definite flaws, I was not disappointed.
There, now you don't need to read the rest of this. I suppose I might go into at least a little more detail. Let's start with where the movie went wrong.

The dialogue is bad. Not just regular-bad, either. This dialogue is Vogon poetry-bad - painfully bad, of the sort that could be considered a form of torture were it not that we saw the film voluntarily. Attempts at humor fell flat with a wet thud, with the exception of one line - Yoda gets the only truly funny line in the film. Lucas needs to either stop writing dialogue, or stop trying to direct actors in speaking dialogue. Probably both. He's not especially good at either.

The plot is contrived to the point of absurdity. Suspension of disbelief is fine, and I'm pretty good at it... but Lucas seems to want us to set aside all sense and reason along with disbelief. Sorry, doesn't work that way. I can suspend my disbelief until Kingdom Come if it makes sense... this stuff just didn't.
The John Williams score deserves special notice... because it is one of his worst ever. I don't know what he was thinking here (or what Lucas was thinking in making the music pretty much omnipresent), but I've never heard music for a film with a good-sized budget that was so inappropriately-used, and so flat-out bad. Cues that represented characters in the wrong places, themes used in places where they really shouldn't be, music in scenes where there should be none, and (rarely) no music in scenes that should have had it. Williams' scores from the previous year (""Harry Potter"" and ""A.I."") were just sort of dull, while his music for the more recent ""Catch Me If You Can"" was some of the best of his career. The score for ""Attack of the Clones,"" however, can only be considered annoying.
Lucas' dependence upon digital effects is one of his new weaknesses as a filmmaker. Making Yoda fully-digitized was probably the biggest mistake, making the water on the cloners' planet all-digital was another. Neither came off well. Yoda, frankly, looked more convincingly lifelike as a puppet. Making him all-digital, all the time just sucked the life right out of him. Lucas and his special effects team could learn a few lessons from Peter Jackson and the ""Lord of the Rings"" crew... they used digital only when it was the best solution, and even then it was generally used only in combination with several other techniques.
And yet, there are many entertaining aspects of ""Attack of the Clones"" that mostly balance out its deficiencies.
The battle scenes are pretty much universally good. Sound design (with the exception of the score) was stunning, with new ship sounds and creature sounds that really worked. The sounds of the seismic charges in the asteroid field (if one ignores the fact that there should be no sound in space) were especially cool.
Some reviewers complained about a lull in the middle of the film, but I disagree. I can see where they are coming from, as I too could have done without Amidala and Anakin's picnic scene that just wound up stuck in the middle, but overall I felt that it actually had a pretty good balance of action and dialogue throughout, even though the dialogue was horrid. One of my favorite scenes, which nobody seems to talk about much, was the chase between Jango Fett and Obi-Wan in the asteroid field, a thrilling ride in any estimation, I should think.
The real payoffs are at the end of the film, though. Mace Windu's battle with Jango Fett was short, but perhaps the best-choreographed in the film. It's what a real Jedi should be able to do. Nice to see Samuel Jackson kick some butt, the way he's supposed to. And of course, the battle between Yoda and Tyrannus... a fight I've been waiting to see (in some form or another) for four films, since I first saw Yoda. I always suspected he could kick it, too, and I was not disappointed. His ""Force"" duel with Tyrannus was a nice buildup, the lightsaber duel afterwards simply rocked.
Then Lucas goes and almost ruins that, too, by making Yoda do something really stupid. A lame ending to an otherwise excellent fight scene. Making a ""wise"" character do something stupid like that is yet another plot contrivance, one of many. But the scene was still fun... just not believeable or consistent.
So, if you see ""Attack of the Clones"" expecting a plausible plot, consistency, good dialogue, well-rounded characters, or meaningful themes, you'll probably be disappointed. If you see it, however, expecting pretty lights, big noisy battles, new worlds, and basically a dumb but fun entertainment, then it's actually a pretty decent movie.",1065830400,,4804,4.765906362545018
1314421,5,B00003CXKT,"Let's face it - the movie's not fantastic, but it's pretty good.  Yes, the acting is extremely stiff and robot-like.  The ""love scenes"" are hard to believe, as there is almost no spark that we see on screen.
In part this stiff acting was done to match the acting of the original star wars.  Go back and watch the original star wars - Luke is annoying, whinny, and generally not a good actor (no surprise that we didn't see Mark in any other major releases).
If Lucas made the new movies as acting masterpieces, well, it just wouldn't work as a series.
So I have some sympathy for Lucas in what he was trying to do.  In the end, he went too far in this direction of trying to match the movies together.  The acting is too stiff - he could've still matched the movies and not made it this bad.
It's hard to like Anakin in this movie, and you're not sure why anyone would fall in love with him.
But, as I said earlier, the movie still gets 4 stars.  The action scenes (which is what this movie is all about) are very well done, with numerous exciting chases through a variety of environments, great sword fights, and amazing special effects.  It is leaps and bounds better than episode I.  So if you can get past the overly stiff acting, you'll enjoy this movie.
The DVD gets a 5 because of all of the interesting special features found on disk two.  In some ways, how they made the movie is almost more interesting than the movie itself.
If you are at all a fan of star wars, I would suggest purchasing this movie.  It will be something you will enjoy sharing with your kids, or grandkids someday.",1065657600,3,1595,4.304347826086956
1314422,5,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones had to be the most anticpated film of 2002. The Star Wars movies are some of the greatest movies ever made and Episode II didn't leave me disappointed.
Episode II picks up where Episode I left off. Anakin(Hayden Christensen) is a padawan to Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGreggor). They must return to Courscant to protect the former queen now Senator Amidala of Naboo(Natalie Portman). Amidala has had assasination attempts on her life and it's up to Anakin to protect her and Obi-Wan to find out who'd doing it.
That's all I'm going to tell about the story, because I don't want to spoil it for anybody else.
The only knock I had against this film is Hayden Christensen. The guy was horrible at times. Any time he had to do a scene with Natalie he stunk it up. The rest of the time he did well, but if he had to show compassion or love he couldn't do it. It was bad. He did however do a good job in his action scenes and if Portman wasn't in the scene he did well.
Ewan McGreggor was great as Obi-Wan. He really is a talented actor that can play a variety of people. He continue's to carry on Sir Alec Guisness's legacy as Obi-Won. He's great in all his scenes and was perfect in the movie except for his mullet hair cut.
Natalie Portman was great in the movie. She shined in every scene she was in. She's a great actress and she's hot. I felt bad for her in all her scenes with Hayden though. She did good with what she had to work with in the love scenes. George Lucas should really get somebody to help him, when it comes to writing love dialogue. It was pretty bad. Natalie shined despite that and I adored her in the movie.
The action scenes are fantastic. It's so hard to believe that most of them are all digital. In fact the entire movie was filmed digitally. The battle scenes in the arena and outside of it are spectacular. It's a rarity where you get to see thousands of troops go up against thousands of troops. It was great to see all those jedi in action. It was awesome to see all those lightsabers chopping away.
Yoda has an awesome fight in the movie. We he came out and pulled his lightsaber out are theater went nuts. You don't see audiences stand up and cheer a lot, but they did there. It's fantastic to see Yoda in action. Props to Lucas for giving us that.
The love melody in the movie is great. John Williams isth greatest movie composer to ever live, and he's written another beautiful song. It makes the love scenes a little more bareable.
Overall I loved Episode II. It's a great additon to the Star Wars movies, and is 10 times better than Episode I. It's a must see and a must own. It's a film that families and generations will enjoy for a long time.",1065571200,10,2715,4.284046692607004
1314423,1,B00003CXKT,"Wow, the negative reviews on here are pretty vicious.  Maybe those folks are just angry that the Star Wars series have declined into clunky stories and bad acting with great special effects.  I didn't like Episode I and blew off Episode II until it showed up on HBO.  Maybe I'd be furious if I saw it in a theatre as well--like Lucy had pulled the football away AGAIN--but then I just switch channels and look for something like STAR TREK II: WRATH OF KHAN.  Character, character, character.
The best thing I've read about ATTACK OF THE CLONES was in The Onion news: ""Most of it's like watching C-SPAN from another planet.""  Dead on, dude.
Knowing where everything is going is not enough to breath life into these movies.  It needs some twists, it needs some real live characters, and it needs story-driven action instead of just video game set-pieces.",1064966400,8,852,4.684563758389261
1314424,5,B00003CXKT,"It's interesting how the negative reviews are written in haste and contain an exorbitant number of spelling and punctuation errors.
Maybe this movie doesn't deserve five stars, but it earned at least four and if I can cancel out some of those who rush to condemn it by giving it five then I think I should do that so that people can get a fair opinion of this movie.
STAR WARS: ATTACK OF THE CLONES may not have a brilliant title, but it's certainly a brilliant movie that is worthy of a place among the other four. The film opens 10 years after THE PHANTOM MENACE and it follows our heroes Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker as they struggle to protect the Galactic Republic from a separatist movement lead by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who also happens to be the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic (his motives will certainly be revealed in the final part of the saga, EPISODE III, to be released in 2005).
EPISODE II is by far the most action-packed STAR WARS movie to date, but unfortunately it relys on CGI for most of the battle scenes, which can take some getting used to. It contains all the series' staples, including fabulous lightsaber dueling and the triumphant return of the corny (but great!) comedy of C-3PO and R2-D2. It's difficult to imagine anyone disliking this movie, because it really has something for everyone.",1064880000,7,1337,4.6455696202531644
1314425,1,B00003CXKT,"Loaded with Matrix-Reloaded-style incessant post-modern philosophical bs, sloppy unconvincing sentimental dribble and badly disguised Hollywood cliches, not to mention a showcase of the worst actors, forced body language and expressions, badly-delivered corny dialogue and loads of 3D eye-candy thrown together to make idiots drool.  As for the scene where Yoda fights?  Sure it looked good, but what the Hell was actually going on anyway?  Even for computer animation it looked entirely improvised and rushed.  If you want to see fictional Jim-Henson-looking creatures in action just grab some Muppet porn.  The storyline, or lack of, was dull, tasteless and full of holes, contradictions and quick convenient twists.  The characters are flat, conservative and pretentious.  Even the new game, 'Knights Of The Old Republic' is more faithful to the original Star Wars chronicles.  What made Star Wars unique and everlasting was that it was raw and simplistic with strong character development and smooth narration.  This movie is full of sad sorry excuses and should've been reconsidered, more organised and entirely rewritten.",1064707200,6,1127,5.621301775147929
1314426,5,B00003CXKT,"It seems as though there is no way to dispel negative atmosphere once it has been started. George Lucas's STAR WARS trilogy was well-loved by audiences (even though critics were split) but for some reason (and I can't figure it out), the first entry in the prequels, THE PHANTOM MENACE, earned a HUGE onslaught of critically divided posts just about everywhere in the world, from the press to the internet to fans in real life. While I do agree that the original trilogy is a tough act to follow, I wasn't as grossly let down by this movie as some were.

The same thing has happened to the second of the STAR WARS prequels, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, released in 2002. Many predicted that this movie would satisfy those who disliked Episode I with a vengeance, but alas, such was not the case. Once again, critics damned the movie for one reason or another, and the heated debate on whether Lucas ""trashed the original trilogy"" or not is still going on. I find it very sad that Lucas would still receive unfair critical attack, even after making a much darker, somber, and ominous movie in ATTACK OF THE CLONES. I'm guessing that such naysayers will continue to say nay to Lucas no matter what just like rabid fans of Anime would continue to slamdunk dubs... even if a lot of them have recently proven to be excellent.

This is not to say that ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a flawless film. It actually has its share of problems that THE PHANTOM MENACE didn't have. The dialogue, although nowhere nearly as bad as critics and some disgruntled fans say, lacks the spark of the original trilogy. My biggest gripe with the movie is that it moves at a leisurely pace, with lots of weak, unsatisfying sequences that last too long. Most of these scenes consist of a love subplot involving Anakin Skywalker and Amidala Padme. When not interacting with each other, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are fine in their respective roles. (Christensen's monologue about his slaughtering of not only Tusken Raiders but--horrors!--women and children is frightening.)  But there is a sense of awkwardness when they contribute to scenes which involve schmaltzy lines and screen kisses. I'm guessing that they both felt uncomfortable doing these scenes, hence why the chemistry between them isn't as interesting as, say, Han and Leia's from the original trilogy.

Only when the movie is in action does ATTACK OF THE CLONES become worthwhile--there's a dizzying chase through Coruscant on floating cars, manuevering through a dangerous asteroid field near a planet, and a half-hour long showdown that showcases a lot of amazing CG work. Actually, what also make Episode II worth watching are the fantastic set designs. Every location in the movie, from the metropolis skyscrapers of Coruscant to the water planet where prototypes of Stormtroopers are being constructed literally bursts with imagination and eye candy.

Of the performers I liked Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan) the best; his acting is still a little shaky at times, but here he seems more comfortable with the role. Christopher Lee makes a surprise appearance as the new villian, Count Dooku, and once again he delivers first-rate evil with this character. And it's great to see C-3PO and R2-D2 up to their usual banter again (although sometimes some gags occur when not necessary). Ultimately, however, the film belongs to Jedi Master Yoda, played to perfection by Frank Oz. His appearances in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI featured him as a rubber puppet (and a delightful creation), but in this movie he really comes alive, thanks to first-rate CG effects. His mouth is perfectly in sync with every word he says, and the final showdown between him and Dooku is an absolute highlight.

While ATTACK OF THE CLONES is, in some ways, a lesser entry in the STAR WARS franchise, its assets outweigh its weaknesses; most of the questions I had from the first episode seem to be addressed a little bit in this chapter, and, frustratingly enough, provides more questions for Episode III. Flawless or not, this is still a STAR WARS movie, and for what it is, it's still worth a look.

Shooting the movie entirely in digital video also provides for an even better 2.35:1 visual transfer in this DVD set, in addition to speaker-thundering sound-quality and plentiful extras.  Even if you hate the movie, this DVD release of ATTACK OF THE CLONES is, like its predecessor before it, a remarkable achievement.",1064620800,4,4448,4.874338624338624
1314427,1,B00003CXKT,"As a great fan of the previous star wars trilogy, I had great hopes for this new trilogy. It is sad to say that this second episode is worse than the first. The characters are just simply dull predictable and far too serious. A very poor performance of Skywalker...couldnt feel the ambiguity of darth vader. Rather looked like a spoilt teenager. I would also like to mention the relation ship between skywalker and padme and that passage where they jump about the fields, and have boring conversations at the fireside. Rather makes me think of a ""young and restless"" episode. HEAVY DUTY. Even the flaming saber battles were disapointing : it rather looked like a bunch of green and red flashlights moving accross the screen. Lucas also felt the need to bring r2d2 and cpo back to give the movie a touch of humour after jar jar binks failure, a desperate move.
this movie definitely lacks the naive, charming atmosphere of the previous trilogy and its charismatic characters such as princess leia and han solo. Ok Great special fx but that's just not enough to make a good movie. Probably, I was expecting too much ... and maybe I could only be Disapointed... but in my opinion Star Wars is dead.",1064534400,5,1195,4.668246445497631

1314547,5,B00003CXKT,"I saw ATTACK OF THE CLONES five times in the theater, and have since seen it many more.  I've heard some people bash the film from almost every angle, but I am not so sure the thinking is exactly clear from these reviewers.
First of all, the title is just as cool as THE EMPIRE STRIKES back, utilizing the same sense of adventure serial dramatics that appeared in the original trilogy.  Modern titles like ""Star Wars: Reloaded"" or ""2TAR WAR2"" would be out of place.  Get over it.
With its plot being almost an American folk legend, the Star Wars prequel trilogy is about story (you'll hear Lucas talk about it over and over again on the DVD).  In my opinion, not every line of dialogue has to be stand-alone poetry in order to be effective, or to serve the story, as it does here.  Each scene is about finding new points, and establishing details upon details of information for the entire saga.
Add to the story some of the nuances of talented actors- Portman's frigid-to-soft Padme, who struggles with her work and her first real romance (feelings that are indeed childish to her)- Christensen's Anakin, an agrier version of Episode IV's Luke with whiney-ness and headstrong action leading toward the ultimate fate of the Dark Side- McGregor's Obi-wan, who has a witty sense of humor about him.  Take all of these plus the rest of the ensemble, and look at the moments, tiny nuances that say ""love"", ""anger"", and ""friendship"".  It's with them all the time.
Remember your youth with the original trilogy.  During ATTACK OF THE CLONES, some kids near me cheered and named off characters just like I did as a young fan.  The Force was with them, and it should be with us too.  An excellent movie!",1064275200,5,1695,4.601328903654485
1314548,4,B00003CXKT,"the second installment in the star wars prequel tends to be darker than other star wars movies. I found the plot line hard to follw. Basically it started out with the attempted assination of princess Amidala. Obi wan goes to investigates the attempt. And finds that the Sith was behind the attack. He finds that the sith are creating a clone army to attack the republic. when obi wan visits the cloners they think he is there to inspect the clones. he in turns uses the clone army to attack the Sith army. The clones look like predicessors to the storm troopers in the original trilogy.
Anakin meanwhile is ordered to watch the princess. They begin to fall in love with each other. You begin to see the dark side welling up inside anikin especially when he tries to rescue his mother from the sand people and ends up killing all of them. Attack of the clones pretty much serves as a bridge between the phantom menace and the third movie in the prequel. The story was dark and moody and hard to follow at times.",1063843200,,1010,4.435483870967742

I must say that I loved AOTC but would have liked to see alot of things done differently.  The love affair between Padme and Anakin was cheesy.  I could have written better dialogue in my sleep.  In fact much of the dialoge was no good and much of it did not flow properly.  The love scenes were not believable at all.  It all looked very forced and could have been written in a very different manner.  I loved the Corsucant scenes but disliked the whole Geonosis stuff.  There was way too much computer animation.  I think that some computer animation is ok, such as the fight with Yoda.  But when the background and everything in the shot is computer animated, that takes so much away from the believability of the movie.  Also scenes, such as the dinner scene with Padme and Anakin was much too much fake.  They could have made it very believable, but they went a step too far and allowed things to look false.  Such as the fruit falling into Padmes mouth.  I mean come on.  The editing was very bad if they cannot tell that is looks totally fake.  In fact, I could safely say that the editing of the film was done in a very bad way.  When I sat in the movies on opening day, I was so excitied about this movie.  The SW movies take you into another universe, but when the shots look fake or the dialouge sounds forced it takes you back into reality very abruptly.  I believe that the true fans like SW because it can seem so real that it is another reality.

1314551,5,B00003CXKT,"I always thought Star wars as a Space Opera or aMythological Tale with Politics, not a sci fi. Star wars has become a much bigger tale than good vs evil. It has become about Destiny, Return, How to treat your fellow man, Rise and Fall of a democracy contrasting with the Rise and fall of a human Being,to keep sanity and compassion from the chaos of the world, living together for mututal advantage,ican go on. The Story is so captivating in episode 2 The Poltical side of star wars is great. The rise of Palpatine and the fall of the republic a lot like the fall of the roman republic, Lucas has read his Julius Caesar. The Love story which is beautifully photgraphed and told visually andmusically. The Obi wan investigation almost feels like a Noir and in the end all hell breaks loose. Why i call this the best star wars film. Lucas Direction and Photgraphy is beautiful. And the soundtrack beautifully accompinies the story. People forget i think that Films are a Visual Medium, not a literary medium. People complain about dialogue,but the dialouge is just like music, it hits certain notes and those notes can be repeated. It is truly not the most important aspect to cinema,the PURE Cinema. I think Society now lives on Dialogue Driven Movies.
Star wars never ever about Dialogue and IMO, the dialogue isn't so trashfully bad, sometimes people overexxagerate, watch the classic trilogy. Star wars acting is much more Operatic, if you have ever seen an opera, you would know what i meant. It's not Schindlers List. The way Lucas uses his colors, his enviroments, his  depth of field and the shots really TELL the story. And the music  accompinies it beautifully. The Love Story which is everyone thinks is so increddibly bad, and which i dont. Again, the way lucas shoots this visually, the way he uses colors, the way he cuts it is beautifully. Where they go to open grassy fields where they feel open and cleansed by the water. Her attraction grows, she takes his fruit, the sweetness of life. The Love Story is beautifully told, they both have different persona's. But they have an attraction to each other, they feel open with each other. Anakin thinks of her like Water, shes very soothing, she wears a lot of blues and white. People Complain about how many Outfits shes wearing, its a MOVIE, its an Illusion, she expresses herself thrugh clothing, the color, the way she is dressed. In the begnin gof hte movie, she feels very clausterphobi with a bar around her neck, she cant give her emotions out, once it comes to the fire place seen, she has 2 sides, personal side and her political side, and again she has a chain aroun dher neck, cna she be selfish and give in emotionally or just she have to stay as a political intellectual. I wish i could go on but i cant, and this love story is much more operatic and Courtly. The enviroments like Kamino, Coruscant, Tattoine, Naboo and Geonosis fill this Episode with Visual Beauty. The Intercutting from a very quiet, Sterile, and stormy planet Kamino to Naboo really shows what is Beauty and what is NOT. Naboo is that Paradise. We have Coruscant which is very clausterphobic and a labryinth, it's a RED hell at the end of the movie. And the Red Geonosis couldn't be more perfect, the start of bloodshed and WAR. This Movie is so underrated. And people still complain about CGI, Film is ART, do you go to a Van Gogh  paiting and go, THAT LOOKS FAKE, many of these shots feel like the Romantic Period, Art deco Periods.

That aside, I watched Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones in the theaters because of all the hype surrounding the movies. Phantom Menace was good, but this movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. I just watched the original trilogy, and was mesmerized by the effects and plots in the first 3 movies. I really wonder what George Lucas was thinking when this movie was made.
This movie is nothing but a love story with some minor side plots. The last 30 minutes (where the Jedis fight) is the best scene in the movie, but the rest of the movie falls flat on its face.

1314554,2,B00003CXKT,"I'm sitting here reading these Amazon reviews (which makes me some sort of a dork already!) and this is what I see;

On one side: The viewers who wished the new ""trilogy"" could live up to the first one and are understandably disappointed.
The other side:  Basement dwelling, light saber wielding Star Wars geeks who worship Lucas as their Messiah.

It's pretty clear where I stand. The one point I think most agree on is that Jarr Jarr ""Stinks"" was an unfortunate addition to the Star Wars ""family"".  Given this, how can anyone ignore the one single point that makes this whole series (including the first three) an absolute tragedy?

JARR JARR STARTED THE WAR!!!

That's right.  In his limited 5 minutes of ""Clone"" film time, he managed to fill in for Padme at the senate and, in her stead (and against her judgment) supported the future emperor's building of an army!!!!  This is THE PIVOTAL MOMENT in Star Wars History!!  It was key to the creation of the Empire.  And His majesty, George Lucas, in his infinite wisdom, sends Jarr Jarr Binks to the Senate.

THAT'S JUST STUPID!!!!

I guess it really is a moot point since the story telling is so bad anyway.

Lucas came up with a very detailed ""history"" for everything that happened in the first 3 films.  He wanted to validate this universe he had created.  Unfortunately, he got so lost in the details that he forgot to tell an interesting story or make an enjoyable film.

I did enjoy seeing a real Jedi army fight (and lose rather badly).  Many of the visuals are stunning.  That does not change the fact that this film is nothing more than a bunch of events (interesting and otherwise) put together to wrap up the history of the first series.  How many of you would sit through 3 hours of a film about the history of the United States?  I don't care anymore about who Thomas Jefferson caroused with as I do how Darth Vader conceived Luke and Lea!  American History is actually more compelling stuff.

Since renting this DVD and viewing it, I've had to seriously consider if I ever wanted to own the entire Star Wars saga.  I'm leaning away from that right now.

First, it brings fans what they've been waiting for:Yoda fighting, what Boba Fett looks like under the mask, the Clone War, tons o' Jedi action, Anakin's dark side manifesting, and him and Padme falling in love. Lucas has created a tragic love tale meshed with a action-packed adventure that preludes to galactic war. The result is a truly amazing film that shows what STAR WARS is really all about. The acting is first rate, especially Christopher Lee as the villainous Count Dooku (Darth Tyrannus). Hayden is great as Anakin, because he really makes you feel sorry for him.

Better casting next time around - I hope! I bought this so I could have all the Star Wars movies, but I probably won't watch it very often.",1062201600,2,580,4.035087719298246
1314681,2,B00003CXKT,"i understand that once something magical is done, like the first three star wars movies, or the first matrix, it's difficult, if not nearly impossible, to duplicate or create the same kind of sense of magic. But I guess my expectations for this movie was a little higher than the payoff. The Phantom Menace was also a disappointment, but this one really bothered me. for some reason i feel like this should have worked. you had a great set up, story wise. but for some reason, whenever a character would say, ""this MUST be done,"" or that MUST be done"" the question would come, ""what's the big hurry?"" or ""what makes that the only choice available?"" The urgency in the script did not present itself in the movie. The movie did get better as it went along, finally getting a bit of its old magic towards the end, but that was too late.
Plus, why would you have Count Dookoo (however you spell his name) as only a two-dimensional character? Would it not have worked better, added more depth to Lucas's universe had Dookoo truly been fighting both sides instead of secretly being with Darth Sidius? What I mean is, would he not have been better as a rogue Jedi who did not agree with the Jedi Council but also truly was against Sidius? That would have been cool. Instead, he's just a pawn that Sidius uses and he remains two dimensional.
Plus I hope Hayden Christensen takes more acting lessons. He really wasn't that good.",1061596800,,1419,4.546875

1314683,2,B00003CXKT,"I really dislike tearing into movies that are so treasured by some people, but ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" cannot be regarded as anything more than a failure. There a just so many things wrong with this movie!! I'll try to keep it brief.
As many, many people have said already, and I will say again, the script is absolutely HORRIBLE!! Ridiculous, laughter-inducing dialogue, loaded with phrases that were cliche before the 20th century, that falls completely flat and makes the movie seem like four hours instead of two. With the exception of Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan, none of the characters are even remotely interesting, including Yoda, whose charm is starting to wear thin. Thankfully, Jar-Jar Binks is pretty much ignored, which is a huge plus. The acting of the two leads, Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman, is absolutely terrible. Yet these two people are wonderful actors, so something is terribly wrong. My guess is that the script was so bad that they had a hard time taking it seriously. There is a lot more wrong with this movie that I haven't mentioned, but I'll highlight a few good points.
The first thing that must be pointed out is that this movie is far better than the horrible ""Episode I"". That's a good start. The special effects are quite good and are interesting to watch, especially during Jedi battles. The music is, of course, one of the best musical scores ever created for a film. Ewan McGregor is very charismatic on screen, and Hayden Christiansen, despite the poor acting, very much looks the part of the young soon-to-be Darth Vader fighting his dark side. And, of course, Natalie Portman is as lovely and fetching as ever, despite the fact that she seems so unhappy.
In conclusion, if you go in with low expectations and a love for DVD extras, you may enjoy this movie. Otherwise, you will end up shaking your head at the end, wondering how the legendary ""Star Wars"" series has fallen on such hard times.",1061164800,4,1960,4.750733137829912
1314789,3,B00003CXKT,"I've now seen this movie many times.  Initially, I loved it, and thought it was so much better than Ep. I.  Now that I've really thought it through, I'm not so happy with it.  The acting is almost universally horrible, but a lot of that can be attributed to two things:  Poorly written dialogue and spending most of the time acting in front of blue screens.
My main objection to this movie is really the effects work.  Lucas has just gone CG happy.  The movies have become more about showing off fancy (and a lot of times bad) CG effects rather than telling the story.  For example, what purpose does Anakin riding on that cow-like thing serve?  None.  None whatsoever.  It's showing off CG work, and bad CG work at that.  I'm not sure what it is about ILM CG, but it just looks bad to me.  It never looks convincing, like Gollum from the Two Towers does.  I think it may be that it just looks TOO polished.  I just know that even their best stuff (Yoda) just doesn't quite cut it.
The high points of the movie:  The last 45 minutes or so are, in my mind, as good as anything in the Star Wars series, right up to the ominous ending.  Again, I question the need for some of the CG generated factory scene, but it was at least entertaining and fairly convincing.  The battle scenes were great, but I cannot help thinking I'm basically watching an animation at this point.  Oh well, it was pretty enjoyable overall, and who the hell I'm I to tell George Lucas how to make his movies?",1061164800,,1480,4.300724637681159
1314790,5,B00003CXKT,"As a Star Wars fan, I loved this film, and while it might not be as intense as episodes IV-VI, it's still very good.  George Lucas made the plot line to include the fan favorites Jango and Boba Fett, clad in Mandalorian armor, which I thought was pretty cool.  The fight scene between Jango and Obi-Wan Kenobi was the best of the movie.  Anakin Skywalker is starting to show signs of what he will ultimately turn into, a force of evil, and his master, Kenobi, is powerless to change him.  Of course, Natalie Portman was great...All in all, AotC was even better than episode I.",1061164800,,576,4.457142857142857
1314791,1,B00003CXKT,"George...You have one chance left. Read this...ONE chance left to redeem your prequel trilogy. Ep1 and Ep2 are non starters. They do NOT belong near the ""Classic"" trilogy. In fact they don't even resemble them remotely.
If you thought Ep1 was bad and my god was it bad, then wait til you see this mish mash of absolute nonsense. The script, direction, casting and acting are all below the standard of a B movie like ""Zombie Flesheaters"" never mind a multi-million dollar production. Everyone concerned should be ashamed of themselves. Some people in the film actually look bored to tears in the film.
The story is just non existent, its simply not there. Its one set piece after another and they are handled awfully. The Characters are insipid sketches, rather than people of reality. Christiansen should NEVER be allowed to act again. I mean that. At least Hammil's young Luke Skywalker in Ep4 is a realistic character and this trilogy really needs a gritty character like Han Solo, everyone is so black and white its cringe-worthy. The best moment from Portman is when she gets a strategically precise tear on her uniform. Well, it gave me a laugh. McGregor just looks like his wonderment at the first trilogy has been utterly destroyed, but he can enjoy his millions. Jackson can forget it. Even poor old Chris Lee looks irritated by this rubbish. Count Dooku (Or Count Dookula), god almighty, could they not even be bothered to give him a decent name? The ONLY character in this dross who was visually engaging was Palpatine.
The action is boring....BORING. Battle scenes where nobody dies are ""A-team"" nonsense. George, watch ""Saving Pvt Ryan"" and take note.
The Jedi's. Yes I know the trilogy is essentially about them, but they are such a boring bunch of semi-mystical hippies its just too annoying to let it go. Thank god they dropped the mediclorian nonsense though, who came up with that? In the next film I want to see them killed in their droves.
The ""love"" story doesn't gel even once in the whole film. I have more of a relationship with Natilie Portman, than Christiansen does. George, you cannot write or direct, please give the reigns to a serious director. When you handed over the the direction to Irvin Kirshner for Empire, he created the masterpiece of the Star Wars saga. Take note.
The effects, while numerous, are lifeless. They lack the reality needed to be convincing. Everything in the film is shiny and new. Theres no weathering or anything aproaching a ""used"" look on any of the vehicles or equipment. In fact, one ship is so shiny its silver!!!! They must have artoo out every morning, with his special polishing equipment. He's able to reach all areas too, because some genius gave him the ability to fly.....yeah fly........WTF? He can fly 30 years before Ep4, but cannot after Ep4.
I'll say this again...
George.....you have one chance left. If Ep3 turns out to be good, then at least fans can view the saga from Ep3 onwards. If not, do the world a favor and never direct or write ANYTHING ever again........oh and fire Rick McCallum.",1060819200,20,3067,4.777777777777778
1314792,2,B00003CXKT,"When George Lucas started writing Star Wars in the 70's,he wrote a fully developed epic in three parts(New Hope,Empire,Jedi) with a short back story(told in the Star Wars novel by Princess Leia)about the deterioration of the Republic,The Clone Wars,and the rise of the Empire. The result:THE GREATEST SCI-FI EPIC EVER PUT ON FILM!Fans were so enthralled by those movies that when die hard fans learned that there may be more to that little back story than anyone thought(Obi-Wan and Anikan fight and the horribly dis-figured Anikan dons the Vader outfit and truly turns evil,for example)that ever since 1983,when Jedi was released,they've been screaming for the full story. George Lucas,the all-powerful guru of Industrial Light and Magic(which provides the SFX for nearly every movie),THX sound(Remeber those deafening ads before each movie just to get the point across that you could hear everything...even though you lost your hearing!),and Lucasfilm,LTD(which produced the Indiana Jones movies),said that he would make those movies when the technology for SFX was better. Unfourtunately,he forogt the fact that while the SFX for the Trilogy was mesmerizing,it was the story that kept the audiance glued to their seats. When he finally announced that he was doing a new trilogy that would go back and tell how it all began,my question was this:""How are you gonna stretch this story out over three films?"" Now I'm sorry I asked. The Phantom Menace was a little slow,but it was okay. My only real complaint(besides Jar-Jar) was how he virtually mimicked the space battle from A New Hope.(Did anyone else find it disconserting that the Trade Federation's ships looked like mini-Death Stars?)When I left the theater,I thought ""Well...it's only part one. The next one will be better."" Boy...was I wrong. This one was even slower. Hayden Christenson's acting was really bad(I wasn't the only one walking out of the theater thinking that!),he drew out the relationship of Anikan and Ameldala too long,and the plot was too convoluted. The only cool thing about the movie was Samuel L. Jackson(just for a joke,it would've been cool if he spouted ""Ezekel 25:17"" when he was in that balcony.)The fact is,Lucas is trying way too hard to show off the special affects and CGI characters that he can create,that he could've spent more time tightening the plot to manage-able and entertaining proportions. You know....it's sad when the DVD extras are more interesting than the movie itself. We can only pray that Episode Three is better. After all....how could he possibly screw up the transformation of Anikan into Darth Vader. Oh....just you watch!",1060646400,3,2637,5.207058823529412
1314793,2,B00003CXKT,"I miss Empire Strikes Back so much.  Where in any of the new films is there a moment even approaching the intensity of the scene where Lord Vader both talks smack to Luke and then lops his freakin' arm off?  I think anyone who saw that movie remembers how shocking that instant was, as well as how well-framed.. the sweep of the light saber, the shortened, mangled limb held aloft in a moment of pure shock for both Luke and the audience itself.
Now, it turns out that actually ol' Hayden ""Mini-Vader"" Christensen loses his hand in this film too.  Does anyone even remember it?  It's before the Yoda/Doku fight, and thrown in almost as if someone smacked themselves on the forehead and ""Oh yeah, Vader here has to somehow transition from a golden-haired diety into a half-machine terror of the entire universe.  Uh, have him lose a hand or something, that was a hit last time.  Now where's my latte?""
I think that comparison alone reveals the fundamental flaw in Attack of the Clones.  It is far too timid for its own good.  It is concerned solely with checking off the box for each ""Star Wars Moment"" that it believes the audience demands, without creating anything new.
Attack of the Clones _is_ better than the Phantom Menace, mostly because Jar Jar is held to about 3 lines, and there is no tow-headed moppet spouting inane dialogue.  Moreover much of the other silliness was appropriately shelved:  Midichlorians (aka Force cooties), Anakin's ""immaculate conception"" and other wackiness are, thankfully, never ever mentioned again.  Unfortunately, others are kept:  Again, nearly all the combat takes place against robots, which I believe actually makes the combat more desensitizing than less.  Blasters and light sabers are now practically antiseptic in their use, meaning that there is no grittiness (read: adult content) what so ever.  There are many thermometers one can use to read the health of the films, but I find the transition from gritty realism to CGI cartoonism the most telling.  Let's review:
A New Hope:  Burning Jawa bodies, rebel troopers gunned down in ship, gory demonstration of de-arming ability of light saber in Mos Eisley cantina, Leia menaced by interrogation droids
Empire Strikes Back:  Luke mauled by snowbeast, loses hand to Vader, Han tortured (!) by red hot thingies, several good-natured Wookie stranglings
Return of the Jedi:  Leia gets shot, Luke electrocuted for quite some time, Admiral Ackbar's chin tendrils quiver with outrage at operability of Death Star II
Phantom Menace:  Bunch of zany robots lopped apart, a few Gungans presumably die somehow off camera, Darth Maul ungraphically bifurcated and falls down hole (achilles heel of all Sith)
Attack of the Clones:  Padme clawed by a big cat, Obi-Wan gets a cut on his leg, Vader inadvertantly loses a hand (whoops!) and then sorta takes a nap or something, bunch of sand people killed off screen, many robots sent to trash heap in the sky, one Jedi shot by Jango Fett
All in all, what little realism one could expect from a sci fi epic has been leached out and replaced with CGI and confectioner's sugar.  Attack of the Clones is better than Phantom Menace, but that sure doesn't mean it's good.",1060041600,3,3194,4.888682745825603

I didn't find the acting too stiff, and I thought that Hayden and Natalie played their roles quite well.  An apprentice Jedi and a politician aren't exactly supposed to be the most exciting of roles, people!  The special effects were okay, albeit a bit overused at times.  My main complaint with this movie is about the atmosphere.  The original Star Wars movies were dark (for the most part) and industrial feeling.  These new movies seem bright, happy and futuristic, in the cheesy 1950's sense.  I won't even elaborate on how blue-screened everything looks.  The major redeeming point of this movie is Count Dooku/Darth Tyrannus.  Christopher Lee has proven that he IS the master of evil, in this movie and in the LoTR series!  Amazing performance!  The re-appearance of Jar-Jar and his responsibility for the forming of the Empire do nothing but irritate me though.  I wish Jar-Jar's ship would have exploded on his way back home, a la Poochy The Dog from The Simpsons.  All you people who criticize the love story going on in the movie seem to forget that Luke and Leia needed to come from somewhere!  'Nuff said!  I'm still undecided on this movie, but my best advice to you is to just watch it and take it with a grain of salt and the wonder of a child.",1058918400,2,1407,4.658536585365853
1314796,1,B00003CXKT,"To use one of the great movie quotes about movies: I have seen better film on teeth. (Delroy Lindo in Get Shorty).
Oh boy! This one really hurt me physically. It was so incredibly boring... I blame Mr. Beard himself for flinging this atrocity at us. George, you just cannot be serious, man! I thought Episode I was the worst, but you could even get lower than that.
A few of the 'high'lights:
1. The dialogue
There is not one single line in this movie that real people would ever utter. Not one. It is stilted beyond belief.
2. The acting
With the possible exception of Christopher Lee, nobody here could build a career on what is presented here. The mighty Sam Jackson, whom I greatly admire, is just rubbish here. I do not blame the actors. They just were not allowed or given the opportunity to emote.
3. The CGI
Too much of a good thing... Was it just me or did this movie run like a video game? Nothing looked real to me, and the screen was way too crowded to give anything a chance to stick out.
4. The love story
Oh my... where to begin? What was that 'Von Trapp' moment doing there? How can someone make up such dialogue? How contrived can a love story be? This was very bad indeed.
5. The jokes
I cannot remember having been exposed to so many lame jokes in one movie by one character ever before. Somebody destroy this droid NOW! Rip it apart! The guy who is responsible for this ""humor"" (cough, cough) should never be allowed to touch a pen ever again. The word corny does not remotely begin to describe it.
6. The final attack
OK, so I skip some parts. Please forgive me, as I have missed generous parts of this movie by having fallen asleep in the theatre. The final attack... Well, what can one say about it? That it went on forever? That it was as exciting as watching the grass grow? That it was utterly boring? Yep, that is what one can say about it. It was terrible. But it did give you a good idea of what action figures would be on sale.
7. Yoda and Dooku
It was very, very hard not to laugh out loud when this scene was on the screen. VERY hard. This was so bad that I could not believe my eyes. Couldn't dear old George have held back and at least shown some respect to one of his most beloved characters? Amazon will never allow me to write down what I really think of this scene, and rightly so. It would not be fit to print, let me keep it at that.
In short, I hated this movie. I sure hope that Lucas will have the decency to let someone else direct, write and produce the last movie in this franchise.",1058832000,8,2528,4.193018480492813
1314797,1,B00003CXKT,I was wrong about this movie. All the good reviews I wrote were written under a bad influence. I was the one who lost the truth. I hate this movie because it is bad.

George Lucas must be stopped!! Worst movie since Hope Floats!!!,1058745600,5,417,4.428571428571429
1314914,1,B00003CXKT,"I have a feeling that if George Lucas could replace actors entirely, he would. There is so much digital stuff going on in this movie that  parts of the battle scenes actually end up looking more like a video game than anything else.
The acting is downright terrible. I mean, high-school play bad, probably owing to a horrible script. If Natalie Portman and that guy who plays Annakin were any more wooden you could carve your initials in them. For all his special effects wizardry, what Lucas has essentially done is created a work where it is impossible to care one bit about what happens to the characters. I can remember watching this in the theater, and feeling totally aloof as to whether or not the two main characters got crushed to death while running around in the mechanisms of a huge factory. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention Yoda's ridiculous lightsaber duel with Christopher Lee (set up by some of the worst dialogue in film history), which only could have been included to pander to Lucas' hopelessly devoted (of which I was one before this movie).",1058745600,5,1064,4.659574468085107
1314915,1,B00003CXKT,"Somewhere, somebody might like this movie. Not me. While not as stale and shallow as Phantom Menace, it reaches points only slightly higher. Lucas has allowed digital computer animation to overrun this film, and while we certainly expected some of the special effects magic, the movie relies on these scenes to carry the rest of the film. The acting is simply that bad. Natalie Portman is certainly attractive, but since when did a Star Wars film rely on outfits to embellish a figure and sell the film? Jackson & Christenson are horrible in this film; Lee gives probably the best performance. All in all, a poor film.

I barely agreed to go see the first one, as it were, seeing as how I had pretty much guessed that they would completely mutilate the heart of this series with unexperienced actors and ""mind-blowing"" special effects. The thing is, the effects are okay, but there's so much boring dialouge that I was driven to do something I have never done before: fall asleep in the movie theater. That's right everyone - I fell right asleep during some sensationally repetitive scene about Jar Jar Binks and never bothered to see the rest of the film. And when I saw that the lead for the second movie was given to Hayden I scoffed, spit and engaged in other acts of disgust in the general direction of the new ""movie"".

I mean of course Harrison Ford is always Harrison Ford. But how about the terribly bad acting of Mark Hamill and mediocre Carrie Fisher. Still, the old trilogy is among my favorites of all time, but I have to admit that Ep. II was not that bad at all. The plot, the special effects, the music were incredible. The only thing that this movie is lacking is a HAN SOLO. For me what makes the old trilogy really great is Han Solo and millenium Falcon.
COnsequently, I'll say that Ep. II was thousand times better than the Ep. I, not as good as the old trilogy but still a great sci-fi.",1058400000,3,840,4.159509202453988

I just can't understand what was George Lucas thinking when making this movie, I just can't.

1314920,5,B00003CXKT,"Others have noted that the best way to view this movie is to ""turn off the adult portion of your brain"" and let the child inside do the watching, and I would agree entirely.  In my experience, the best way to accomplish this is through the use of certain - ahem - botanicals, the use of which focus the mind on the special effects and the mythical feel of the movie, creating a simply beautiful experience.
That being said, I really really like this movie.  Much (though not all) of the acting is rather horrid, but if you go back and watch the original Star Wars you'll find yourself not particularly impressed with some of the performances there either.  The only big complaint I have in this regard is that as far as I can tell Natilie Portman and Hayden Christensen must hate - ""deeply, truly"" HATE - each other in real life.  Nothing else can account for the absolute woodenness of their romantic scenes.  Even the kiss at the end looks like the two participants are forcing themselves to do it.
But other than that, I think this movie is fantastic.  I like the script, no matter what you say, I really like the plot, Camino is among my favorite planets, Coruscant is beautiful, the Geonosians are neat-o, C-3PO is simply horrific (and if those droids don't get their memories wiped in Star Wars 3 I'm going to throw all these stupid movies out the window and be done with it).  I actually like Jar-Jar's role in the film:  The big, annoying, stupid idiot is the individual responsible for the Empire.  I think it's cool.  I also like how the end of this film takes place outside at sundown, whereas  Episode 1 ended outside at what seems like midday.  If ep 3 ends at night, I'll know George Lucas isn't a complete idiot.
One last comment would be that I agree that in many ways (all of which are Jar-Jar Binks) these new Star Wars movies are inferior to the originals.  But after watching all 5 currently available in a row, I can say that there are two ways in which they are superior:  The characterization in Attack of the Clones and The Phantom Menace is very good, whereas in A New Hope (if not the following 2 movies) it is, at best, lacking.  Also, I appreciate that in Episodes I and II I have a much, much better sense of the setting and the political climate than in the original trilogy.  In Episodes IV through VI the only understanding of the galaxy at large I recieve comes from Grand Moff Tarken's offhand reference to the Emperor disolving the Senate, and the brief celebration scene on Coruscant at the end of Return of the Jedi (special edition).  That always bugged me.
It may not seem that way now, but I really think that Star Wars saga as a whole is going to be remembered as one of the greatest achievements in the history of American cinema.  Thank you, and good night.",1058140800,4,2800,4.435546875

Some people say this film is boring, well next time don't take sleeping pills while watching the movie because a big explosion is right in the first five minutes of the film, then following shortly is the chase through Coroscant, that was like ""The French Connection"" with flight! Then we get to see Obi-Wan play detective and fight Jango Fett and chase him through an asteriod feald and almost get blown up. Meanwhile we see Anikan look for his mother which gets really engrossing. Then we go back to Obi-Wan and see him spying on the trade federation which gets heart pounding. And the last half hour of the film is breath taking, fireworks going off in the droid factory, then we see our heros battle it with three monsters, then we see jedi at there best with lightsabers and lazors going all over the place, and we get to see the first storm troopers, then Obi-Wan battle it out with the Dookster, then see Aniken use two lightsabers, and then Yoda use his which is the best part.
And what about Hayden Christensons acting? I'll admitt that he wasn't to happy with him at the beginning but when you got into the film he really had his moments.
The love scenes weren't that bad either, the love scenes came just at the right time.
It's the best time watching a movie that you will ever have.
Oh and another thing for all you one star reviewers, if you think the film is so bad then why are you even waisting your time bad-mouthing a good movie, I mean it's one thing to write down what you think about a film one time even if you think it is bad, but to keep on repeating it hoping every one will go with you on your review is just pointless that's just saying you one star revewers just got nothing better to do (this includes the guy who thinks he's Jonathin Taylor).

Christopher Lee and Ewan McGregor were the two bright spots in the movie, but Hayden Christensen was horrible.  I know that he's portraying the downfall of the main character, but I was very disappointed.  As far as Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson, I feel that they could have replaced them both with cardboard cutouts.  The acting on both parts was just plain flat.
I enjoyed the action scenes (I laughed out loud during Yoda's lightsaber battle) but I cringed everytime Anakin and Padme were on the screen.",1057881600,2,616,4.783018867924528
1315055,4,B00003CXKT,"I'm not going to go off about the cardboard acting, the bland script, the lack of any real continuity or even the over use of special effects. I'm going to tell you that the best way to view this is to turn off the adult portion of your brain and let that kid inside you come out and take over. If you don't, you'll go insane.
  This is the most action packed Star Wars yet. Tons of Jedi lightsaber action. Cool space battles and if you haven't heard yet, Yoda kicks some serious butt. The beginning is a little thrown together. And it takes a little too long to get going, but once it does, it really gets going. The action scenes are fast paced and look very cool.
  The DVD is packed with extras. The extras alone are worth the price of the DVD. If you are a die hard Star Wars fan, you already own this. If you are considering buying this, do it. You get your money's worth. But don't look for any Oscars to be awarded for acting. And don't look for deep plot.
Just sit back and enjoy the show as you would have when you were a kid!",1057795200,,1036,4.063725490196078
1315056,4,B00003CXKT,"If you're considering buying this DVD, you've probably already seen the movie.  You already know that it's a tightly plotted space opera that emphasizes action over characterization.  You've already seen the special effects that are getting so good you hardly notice that they are special effects; you've already seen the climactic battle between scores of Jedi and hundreds of robots, and the light sabre duel where Count Dooku - my favorite character - defeats both Obi Wan and Anakin before facing off against Yoda.  You've probably even formed an opinion already about whether Hayden Christensen as Anakin is really as terrible an actor as some feel.
What you haven't seen yet is the second disk of the set - the ""Special Features"" disk.  Unlike other DVDs where the extra features are mostly scraps saved from the cutting room floor, the extras for this DVD set clearly involved a lot of careful production work, and probably represent more effort and money than many films in their entirety.
Here you will find detailed descriptions of how the digital characters were created - along with stories such as the one on how the CG (computer graphics) team convinced George Lucas to go with a fully digital Yoda, or on what kinds of challenges Lucas continually threw at the team.  Those more interested in the human characters may be interested in the actors' viewpoints:  Christopher Lee's reflections on playing a swordfighter at the age of 80; Natalie Portman's discussion of how Amidala's role in this movie as Senator differs from her previous role as Queen; how Sam Jackson managed to get his character Mace Windu the only purple light saber in the galaxy.  You may even want to give Christensen a chance to explain his apparently disjointed acting:  he says he was attempting to portray the dark side of the force as an external influence that occasionally took control of his character, rather than something that came from within.  You may not think that's a valid interpretation of the role - I don't - but at least you can understand what he was trying to do, whether or not he succeeded.
Also on the extra disk are eight scenes that did not ultimately make it into the movie.  Many of these scenes are primarily characterization.  For example, the scene in the home of the Amidala family, with Padme's knowing mother and sister teasing her about her 'boyfriend' Anakin, and her father talking to him about her welfare, makes the subsequent romance between Anakin and Padme seem much more believable and natural.  For each of these scenes, George Lucas discusses why they were cut; in most cases, it boiled down to cutting them because they didn't advance the story, even if that meant losing some background information - an interesting tradeoff.
The final extra is on the main disk:  the full length narrative tracks where Lucas and others explain the hows and whys of what they were doing in the movie itself.  I found the discussion of the space chase scene between Jango Fett and Obi Wan particularly interesting:  during the movie, I hadn't noticed that there was no music for most of this scene, but once it was pointed out, it was obvious how the absence of music served to intensify the scene for me.
After spending a few hours viewing the extra features in this DVD set, I was able to view the movie itself again with a renewed sense of appreciation.  And that, I think, is the best reason to consider buying this DVD set.",1057708800,,3445,4.7841483979763915

But what you'll never hear is that the dialogue is highly stylized, based on conventions set forth by John Ford films and Flash Gordon seriels; or that the actors are from an external school of thought, and are not of the method -- which makes for a different performance.
Attack of the Clones, like The Phantom Menace, are grand, operatic sci-fi/fantasy epics. Nearly every scene in the Star Wars films is highly calculated and textured with mytholigical imagery.
And the beautiful thing about the films is that you don't have to think that deeply into them to grasp their fun. But people simply won't let themselves be taken away by the sheer excitement.
People ... it makes you look silly to bash something when you don't understand it. It's cool if you don't like it, but don't roll up onto these boards telling educated moviegoers that Star Wars is bad, because it just isn't.

1315059,3,B00003CXKT,"This film really was a let down to me. I have been a fan of all things Star Wars since I saw the first film and this film had the potential to be so much more. I think what killed it is Lucas jamming everything into one film what realistically could have been it's own trilogy. He wasted so much time on the romance between Anakin and Padme that it played out like soap opera in space!
It was also disappointing to have such a hyperkinetic lightsaber duel in Episode One between Obi-Wan and Darth Maul only to have Christopher Lee digitally masked onto a stuntman and use inset shots to make it appear as if he is fighting Hayden Christiansen. Granted Lee is upwards towards his 80's, but it could have been filmed better.
What I did like was the opportunity to see Yoda throw down! That was the payoff. My hope is that Episode Three will make me appreciate this one after the trilogy is over the same way ""The Empire Strikes Back"" seems better after watching ""Return of the Jedi""",1057622400,,980,4.360655737704918

Many critiques have been made about actors Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman's acting abilities, but to no avail.  You cannot argue that one of the best filmakers of all time would or has to allow ""bad acting"" in his films if he didn't intend for the characters he wrote himself to be portrayed the way they are in this film.  To the point, Lucas has enough money and time to make things exactly how he wants them.  And the claims that Lucas stooped to ""sex appeal"" (Amidala appears in a shoulderless, tight leather outfit) is completely untrue. Remember Return of the Jedi?  Princess Leah is in a metal outfit far more revealing than anything in this film.  Everyone has said that they hate Anakin, because he is corny, cheesy, and predictable.  I would like to argue that Anakin is meant to be hated, corny, cheesy, and predictable!  That is why he becomes Darth Vader in the first place.  I believe that Lucas made Anakin to be resented by the audience, a complete 180 from the way everyone likes Luke Skywalker.  The people who complain about this film are those who made up their own versions of what they thought it should be, and aren't letting George Lucas tell his own story.",1057622400,2,1281,4.578947368421052
1315061,5,B00003CXKT,"OMG, Star Wars Episode 2 is such an awesome movie! I saw Star Wars Episode 1, not having seen any of the other movies and liked it pretty well. But whenever I see Episode 2, I am totally intrigued the whole time. I am on the edge of my seat, and I am not kidding. The special affects are incredible and it really seems like I am traveling the galaxy with the Jedi. I also really love this movie because I am a writer and every time I see it, it spurrs me to write fantasy fiction books about traveling the universe and fighting off evil enemies. For me, it is inspiring. I know I probably can't say the same for other people. My favorite character is Yoda, by far. Everyone in the movie theater was cheering when he was battling that evil guy and preventing Obi-Wan Kanobi and Anakin from being killed by that enourmous beam.
I think the plot of these movies is so cool and I can't wait for Episode 3 to come out. Yoda rocks and so does Star Wars Episode 2!",1057536000,,957,4.150537634408602
1315062,1,B00003CXKT,"I've thought alot about this film.  I saw it twice in the theatres, for free thank god, i even published a movie review saying that it was bad.  But recently seeing it on tv....i finally understood just how bad this film is.  I can honestly say this ranks up with bad films such as armeggedon, mortal combat 2, and steel dawn.
I didn't care for episode 1, but at least that film was competent.  This seems to be a horrid case of CGI gone mad.  The fact of the matter is, the special effects aren't even that good.  If you study them they usually come across as very fake looking and superficial.  The original star wars was the first film i ever saw, and i nursed a fascination with it most of my young life.  Looking back, i see that those films stress quality of the special effects over quantity.  Episode 2 is the exact opposite.
Two scenes really hit a nerve with me.  One is where Padme and Anakin are making googly eyes at eachother at a table while Anakin plays around with fruit.  What made me mad was the fruit is clearly CGI, they don't even attempt to make it look real.  Anakin then sticks a fork and knife in it, and the fruit doesnt seem to react at all.  You can see it's a simple superimposition.  Like i'm not going to notice that george?
The second is a scene where Padme gets knocked off some kind of transport and is stranded in the desert.  If you look at the ground, it's clearly CGI sand.  I mean....it looks like some kind of cheap windows backround.  So we have to CGI sand now huh george?  You couldn't spend $100 and fill a sound stage with some sand and have it look real?  They even seemed to be shooting in Tunisia for parts of the film, you couldn't find a sand dune there?
What makes the film completely absurd is the dialog, which i'm sure many have pointed out.  At points in the theater i wanted to just stand up and growl ""UGH!  Shut the ... up!""  It really is almost painful to listen to.  At times i half expected someone to jump in the film and yell ""Stop Lord Zagnoid!  You're evil reign of terror is over!""
Then there's about a thousand other flaws in the film.  The relationship between Anakin and Obi is almost absurd.  They seem to be some kind of One-liner team, Obi says something that is suppose to sound wise but is executed as idiotic, ...  I guess the message they're trying to send is that Obi was just asking to get whacked by Vader.  I could of sworn Obi was suppose to be smarter or wiser than he's played, seeing how he's a master and all.  He couldn't even solve the laughable 10 minute sub-plot about some planet disapearing.  Then a toddler in a big hat upstages him.
One of the few parts i liked in episode one was the highly skillfull lightsaber fight at the end.  Episode two is particularly funny as all the lead characters simply wave a lightsaber around as if they're confused as to what it is they're suppose to be doing.  It looks like children playing around with their plastic lightsabers.  Then those scenes are intercut with real martial artists doing poses with lightsabers, they never really fight with them....they just strike a damn fine pose.
Which leads to yoda's little pissy-fit.  You'd think the wisest of the wise wouldnt need to raise a sword, thats a main point in most eastern philosophies; something the first films relied heavily upon.  But yoda jumping all around and whomping ...came across as a desperate attempt to inject substance into the film.
The droids are in it as well, much to my dismay.  Basically they replaced jar-jar with two droids who just act likes fools and really don't do anything at all besides get in trouble, which has no effect on the plot.  In fact, some of the stupidest scenes i've ever seen in a movie now belong to C-3PO and disembodied battle droid.  Remember when the droids actually did stuff in the first films?  You know, they hacked into stuff and translated and saved the day.  Now they're soley just a comic relief device.
All and all....what happend?  How did a script this bad get made?  Didnt anyone point out to George that it [was bad]?  You'd think you could get someone else to write one, seeing how many books and comics have been written about star wars.",1057363200,12,4188,4.405475880052151
1315063,3,B00003CXKT,"George Lucas seems to have forgotten that a story should drive a movie forward, not the special effects. This is what has plagued the Star Wars prequels, and Episode II is no exception. The movie is mediocre at best. The DVD however, is quite well done. There are plenty of extras included, including behind the scenes materials, and deleted scenes. The transfer is high quality, thanks to the all-digial production (Lucas never shot the movie on celluloid, but rather with digital cameras onto a computer, so he could do the SFX better).

1315154,2,B00003CXKT,"For months before it's release word (probably fueled by George Lucas himself) was that Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones would be a much more satisfying sequel than that mess that was Star Wars Episisode I:  The Phantom Menace.  George Lucas has no imagination left.  Can I back that claim up?  Absolutely.  One of the most exciting scenes of The Empire Strikes Back was of course the asteroid field sequence in which the Millenium Falcon dashes in and out of asteroids to escape T.I.E. fighters in pursuit.  This movie also gives a chase in an asteroid field but this time it's about as exciting as looking over the shoulder of someone playing a video game.  Another scene that plays as a video game is a scene in which Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen) and Padme (Natalie Portman) fight these over sized hornets in a droid factory.  Remeber that Activision game Pitfall?  It's like a space age version of that game.  Oh, and remember towards the end of TESB Darth Vader cuts Luke Skywalker's hand off and in the final scene Luke is scene with a mechanical hand?  This time out Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) cuts Anakin's arm off and Anakin has a mechanical arm in the final scene.  Those are minor irritations next to the main thing wrong with this movie.  Anakin.  He's a horrible character.  The child Anakin was annoying in TPM and he's even worse as a young adult.  He whines all the time.  Whether he thinks he's being treating unfairy by Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) or he's telling Padme how much he loves her, he just whines.  The movie is painful to watch whenever Hayden Christensen is on screen.  The love story between Padma and Anakin is possibly one of the worse love stories in cinema history.  It feels forced and contrived.  At first Anakin keeps telling Padme how he has thought of her every night for over ten years...he seems as one of the stalkers from There's Something About Mary.  Then he loses his mom in a ridiculous scene, and takes his revenge on those pesky Tuskin Raiders.  Afterwards in the worst scene of the film he confesses to Padma what he had done.  The guy is suppose to be a Jedi but he's turning into a psychotic.  Padme soon is totally in love with him.  That doesn't say too much for her judgement.  By the way, the scene in which Anakin murders the Tuskin Raiders is so brief it seems it was edited to get this movie a PG rating that George Lucas longs for.  Enough negative thoughts.  The movie is kind of entertaining while Ewan McGregor is on screen.  The scene at the clone factories is one of the best in the movie.  Christopher Lee gives a good turn as Count Dooki (what a stupid name for a character).  And like Phantom Menace, the special effects are terrific.  The final ground battle is also amazing.  I was not a big fan of the showdown between Dooku and Yoda.  Before Lightsabers are whipped out and Yoda is reflecting Dooku's assaults, I was thinking, this is Escape From Witch Mountain.  To sad thing is these two latest Star Wars flicks could have been decent, if someone other than George Lucas had written and directed them.",1056758400,3,3102,4.566243194192378
1315155,1,B00003CXKT,"First, as has been said many times before, Hayden Christensen is just a terrible actor. What they were thinking when they selected him for this role, I will never know. Actually, the acting across the board is generally pretty bad, but no one comes close to Hayden. The whining is out of control, and there's never a moment where I sincerely believe he's not acting (if that makes any sense).
The worst part of this movie, if it's possible to choose between so many elements that make this one a flop, is the fight scene with Yoda. I still can't believe that there are reviewers who didn't think that scene was horrific. It seemed like one big joke, with Yoda hopping around everywhere. Poor old guy. They took a highly respected and ""wise"" character and made him look absolutely ridiculous.
The other thing that was annoying was the fact that I felt like Lucas was just trying to throw in a bunch of crazy looking characters every chance he got. It was just too much. Though I didn't walk out of this movie in the theater, I wish I would have.",1056672000,7,1044,4.471204188481676

Because this not only delves more into the events which brought about the fall of the Republic, the rise of the dark side, but also sets up for a final chapter that will tie it all together with the original trilogy. If anything, I feel George has put together a piece of story telling genius.

Yoda's light-saber battle with Christopher Lee should be cut out or seriously modified.
In the DVD back-story, even George Lucas says: ""If we don't do this right, people are going to laugh...""
You're right, George.  They laughed.
Yoda swirling back his robe to expose the lightsaber and having it leap to his hand was classic western gun-fight, and had just the right touch of humour.  Having Yoda bounce around the set like a grasshopper on amphetemines was rediculous.
If it is ever re-edited, the scene could be made perfect if one of two options were taken:
  a) Yoda stands flat-footed and deflects all of Christopher Lee's assaults without effort (one-handed, slightly bored, no challenge here)
-OR-
  b) When Yoda unlimbers his lightsaber and takes a stance, Lee flees into his ship and blasts off. (Run Away!)  Still worth a snicker, but not the laughter that the eventual scene inspired.

On the plus side, we see Yoda fighting! Who would've thought that a green midget, who is hundreds of years old, was not only wise, but can also kick some arse?!
We also see Jango Fett, father of everyone's favorite bounty hunter, Boba.
The movie is darker, which helps set the stage for Episode 3, where we'll see Anakin embrace the dark side and become Darth Vader(finally).

1315241,4,B00003CXKT,"Despite the bad reviews that people have given this Title, I would have to disagree on many points. Not only because I'm a Star Wars fan but that the Galactic Empire didn't exist yet to build any ""ships"" like Tie-Fighters. In Episode 1, it was the Trade Federation and the introduction of the Sith. In Episode II, you are fed with Jango Fett and clones. The story I believe was better than the first episode and contained the needed formula to move the film a bit further up the scale (Anakin and Padme romance). That was kind of inevitable too since it's what leads to the birth of Luke and Leia. I found the visual effects very nicely done and the short battle between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett was a nice touch and actually lasted longer than even Boba Fett's little tangle with Luke in ""Return of the Jedi."" Even though the movie did lack in a few spots such as too much time wasted on romance scenes and less focused on actual ""Star Wars"", it did perhaps do its job of saving the best for the last and I guess in my mind, the best was Yoda in that much talked about lightsaber duel with Count Dooku. Also prior to that, the lightsaber fight between Anakin and Count Dooku. I picked up interest in scenes here and there and enough to convince me that this was a must in my video collection. Not ONLY cause I'm a Star Wars fan but to anyone, the Star Wars saga would never feel the same without seeing and knowing the tale that unraveled before the original trilogy. With the exception of the bad acting (although Ewen Mcgregor does a nice job of portraying Obi-Wan. Good thing Samuel L. Jackson was in this), and the lack of spaceships and a somewhat average plot, I enjoyed the movie for just its simple development and visualization.

Genius imagination. Fresh, interesting, unique, memorable characters. Fantastic music. Masterful attention to detail. Suspense. Surprises. A blend of sweet and strange, disgusting and spectacular. Good and evil were represented in human terms, authentic and rich with mythic resonance.
What makes this film so awful? Zero imagination. I suppose there were some interesting digital elements, but clever digital rendering is not a substitute for real storytelling. Characters? Who, the third rate Romeo and Juliet? R2D2 with a different number? All the nondescript aliens with flaccid tenticles hanging off their heads (what is up with that?)?

I am not disputing that it cannot hold a candle to any of the original films, and that this does not live up to our expectations--but let's give what credit is due!  First of all, let me say that the plot in this movie is as effective as ever--well, perhaps not as enthralling as it was in 1977, but very good nevertheless.  The special effects are, naturally, unmatched by pretty much any other movie.  The music is well-suited for this film (although arguably not for the Star Wars style), and ultimately, an asset.  But where Lucas went wrong, as so many critics and reviewers and moviegoers have commented, is Hayden Christensen.  There isn't a single scene in the entire movie that he acts well in.  It's horrific.  What, Lucas had 600 actors try out for this part and Christensen was the best.  That doesn't leave me too much faith in Hollywood's future.  Portman does pretty well (but she's not as good as in other films I've seen her in).  McGregor is good, as well (at one point in the movie where they are chasing Zam into the nightclub, he speaks the line ""This weapon is your life"" just like Alec Guiness would have).  Anyway, that's my take on Episode II.  It isn't a 1-star effort, but all the same it dissapoints us all.  We've had 20 years to think about how cool ep. 1-3 would be, so we gotta cut Lucas and co. some slack.  But let's hope that Episode III is better.",1056067200,,1453,4.349442379182156

Lucas must be feeling the heat from 'The Matrix' films, but even more insecure he must be from the grandeur of 'Lord of the Rings.' LOTR has all of the heart, characterization and epic qualities that SW's has lost. (If at all possible Lucas would be wise to consult with the LOTR director, Peter Jackson, and/or the LOTR's screenwriters to try to remember what good writing consists of.)
When I saw AOTC on opening night here in New York City, people were actually laughing at the lakeside ""romance"" scenes between Anakin and Padme. Lucas can at least be glad that Christopher Lee (LOTR's Saruman) was there to give the movie a desperate jolt of energy as a true bad guy, something Episode 1 sorely lacked. If we are at all lucky, Episode 3 will begin having Anakin already gone over to the dark side, and the other Jedis and Padme trying to bring him back, thus starting at a dramatically urgent moment and moving on to its resolution, instead of more interminable setup.",1056067200,,1058,4.632978723404255

1315247,2,B00003CXKT,"Some movies don't need to have profound storylines or sharp endings or twists. Some movies just need great action sequences and great visual effects. The Matrix gave us both of these, but Episode II neither. I was extremely excited when I heard about the special high definition cameras Lucas was going to use. But what is the use if the entire background is digital and looks phonier than a toupee. Billion dollar cameras to film pure (beep)! But the storyline is worse, Lucas should have created a digital Anakin, at least he would have had a better actor. Touch for Padme. I felt robbed after watching this movie. I thought this would be redemption for Lucas after Episode I, but STRIKE TWO! Let's just hope he doesn't go down swinging with Episode 3",1055808000,2,753,4.669172932330827
1315248,3,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars may have been a groundbreaking sci-fi masterpiece when George Lucas was able to scrape up just enough cash to release the epic first trilogy. Episodes IV, V and VI are milestones of cinematic achievement that not many director's can even rival. Star Wars wasn't just movies about a time long ago in a galaxy far, far away ... it also became a worldwide sensation. Books, Comics, Toys, Music, Clothes, etc., are all over the malls in America and other shops all over the world. All of the movies in the series are worldwide box office hits, and their video/DVD sales are nothing to scoff at either. When I was a kid, I enjoyed the first trilogy. It was fresh, it was cool and it had sweet special effects that even now are considered acceptable. It helped catapult a young Harrison Ford into superstardom, and Mark Hamill into a... well, he had a bit part in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.
Then in 1999, Star Wars - Episode I: The Phantom Menace was released. I was not impressed with the new Star Wars look. I thought it was slow, boring, a yawnfest with some flashy lights and loud sounds. Of course, that didn't stop it from going up onto the all time box office record holders. Darth Maul was cool, I will admit that much. But young Obi Wan seemed a little weak to me and a child Anakin just annoyed me. I was much more comfortable with the sinister Darth Vader, but what can I do, these are prequels.
  2002 brought Star Wars - Episode II: The Attack of the Clones. It came out about 2 weeks behind the juggernaut hit, Spider-Man. I had went with not very high hopes but I was pleasantly surprised that it was a better action/sci-fi flick then Episode I. I was also happy they decided to get rid of one of their main characters from Episode I. (I won't say the name, but it rhymes with Lar Lar Winks.) Episode II was a good popcorn flick but terrible acting made it hard to take seriously, especially from Hayden Christensen that portrayed a teenage Anakin Skywalker. It still wasn't up to par with Star Wars the original or Empire Strikes Back. George Lucas seems to be reaching a little bit, trying to stretch the saga to it's end. I was happy with the last battle and Yoda doing some booty whuppin, but it wasn't enough to save a sinking ship.
  The DVD came out and I rented it because I was bored and had absolutely nothing else to do. I watched the movie again, this time on my TV at home. It wasn't the same without the large screen and loud sound system. The special features were plentiful and you got a little look on the inside of this Star Wars installment. If your a die hard fan of the series, the DVD was probably pre-ordered months in advance, and you were also extremely happy with the content available on it.
All in all, it was a mediocre movie at best, but the DVD has loads of features to keep you entertained for a few hours. One of the best setups I have seen recently for a DVD feature. The menu screens were cool and it goes on and on.
3 out of 5 stars for good content and excellent quality in picture/sound.",1055635200,,3049,4.334500875656743

So what was the point in making this movie?  The magic of the first three movies is gone!  That magic came from good stories and acting and characters you could connect with.  Not so in this outing!  What a shame!  A whole generation of new audiences will have to go to the original trilogy to find the magic, because it just isn't here.

1315331,4,B00003CXKT,"That was my first thought after the house lights came up in the movie theater where I saw this. Finally, George gets us back on the ride that I was drawn into 25 years ago -- the adventure, the action, the STORY -- that I desperately found lacking in Episode I.

Lucas allows Anakin's character to come into its own as we see him struggle with the conflict between his demanding responsibilities as a Jedi apprentice and his consuming love for Padme.

The Dark Side is a nearer shadow to Anakin and to the rest of the Republic, as we begin to see the Darth Sidious's master plan come to shape. We understand how the seeds of conflict will be used to accomplish his goal of supreme power.

(I not only soundly approve of less screen time given to the annoying Jar Jar Binks, but I also found justice in that he unwittingly becomes the quisling that ushers in dictatorship over the Republic...)

Of course, the folks at ILM prove once again that they are in a league of their own with special f/x that are lightyears beyond anyone else. Worlds, droids, starships -- all culminating in the mind-blowing Clone War sequence.

The story is dull and listless, and plays like an episode of Columbo in space (with all the lines being delivered in very wooden tones) .  The original Star Wars movies (episodes 4, 5, and 6) were exciting and fun to watch.  This movie, along with episode 1 is simply dull.  Far too often the viewer is asking themselves, ""What happened to George Lucas' brain?"" I couldn't even bring myself to go to a theater to see this movie (after episode one being so bad, I wasn't going to fall for that again). I saw it when it appeared on HBO.  At this rate, it will take extreme use of force to make me watch episode three...... this poor franchise, which started out so well, is being beaten further and further into the ground... unless you are a fanatical Star Wars  fan, do not waste your time with this movie (even then, the fanatical will most likely be majorly disappointed as well).",1055548800,2,953,4.417142857142857

Just when I thought the series couldn't get any worse, here it is.  Episode II, an even more unstable, unstructured, boring, badly if edited at all, emotionless, sloppy, terrible attempt at movie genius.  The only thing that makes the movie bearable is the special effects, which is nothing in comparison when compared to all of the other movies that came out this year.  No originality, eye widening, or gasping scenes.  The plot line is as a zig zag line, or even a dotted line, which stops and goes in different directions without reaching any impacting climax at the end.  The romantic relationship between Anakin and the Princess was awkward, due to the fact that he was eight years old when they first met, and she was a teenager.  In addition it was just out right lame, forced, and both actors had no chemistry together.  (Spoilers)  The worse was the ending, which is a rushed action scene in which there is no impact at all to the audience, and in the end, Anakin's arm is chopped off with no emphasis.  Then in a pathetic attempt to awe the audience Yoda fights the bad guy.  This is just terrible, but then again, the bad guy really had no deep conflict with any of the characters, so it didn't matter who fought him.  Then the scene in addition is chopped, and we are hurled into the next scene with a horrible ceremony, with two emotionless, robotic actors getting married.  I have no idea why this movie received such high reviews, I have no idea how it could {have made more money}it's superior predecessors.  Everyone complains about Jar Jar, he was the only character that brought life and feeling to the movie.  Now that is sad.  All I can say is that it is a terrible movie, and I will not waste a penny to see the next one.

Great scene with the Jedi in the arena, as the Clone Wars kick off.  Great installment in the greatest film franchise.",1055289600,4,515,4.389473684210526
1315336,2,B00003CXKT,"Ok. To start with, we must look at the title. Attack of the Clones. Does this sound like a movie from the sixties or what? I can see an army of 'clones' closing in on a couple (boy+girl), and them screaming in terror. Problem is, that is not too far off. There is a couple, but the clones are good, for now. Next, I see the word 'clones'. This has been a contradictory theme in the news papers for a while now, and, how many movies have the been in the past six years about clones? What, about 8? Seven of which Arnold Swhateverhisnameisspelledlike has starred in. From here what would make you even think twice about stepping into the theater? The trademark characters. Duh. That's what made me see Episode one, and this.
Characters is what we get to next. I almost jumped with joy to hear about Boba Fett being in this film. I was disgusted. Some 'kid' who is so grotesque he could be a hobbit, is Boba. A kid! I expected to see him suiting up for his first bounty, but no. I had to stick to his Hispanic father, Jango. I am not racist, but if the clones were clones of Jango, shouldn't they all be Hispanic, not white. Think about it. Every trooper in Episodes 4-6 were white. How are they clones then, you might ask. Easy. George Lucas does not want to be pegged a racist for his movies starring all white men other the Lando Calrissian, the only black guy in the first 3 movies.
Now we get to the movie. Why have all of the recent SW films been based around lightsabers? They used to be space movies, with ships and everything, but now you could mistake it's sets for a futuristic Ghetto. Everything that I like about the first three films have been eliminated. I acutally bought an X-Wing action figure because it was my favorite thing in the whole trilogy. Now what to they have? One ship that Obi-Wan flies, and the Slave-One. Great. I am ecstatic. Can you not feel my joy?
Now, My review.
Sound: 3.5/5. Not much has changed in this field since Star Wars: A New Hope. Mostly redone versions of those songs. Good, but not spectacular.
Acting: .5/5. Acting? Whatchoo talkin' 'bout? There was next to no acting done in this movie. The closest thing to acting was Anakin's speech to Padm about how he liked her because she was not sandy, like sand.
Graphics: 3.75/5. Good. I have seen better, but all that was expected was fulfilled. Great saber fight in the colisseum, but not much other than that.
Script: .25/5: WHAT!?!? THIS THING HAD A SCRIPT? WAS IT EVEN REHEARSED? I have seen better scripts in school plays. Not only that, but the ones that were better were written by the students in the play.
Plot: 2/5. O could understand, but a book on micro-biology rivals this in terms of plot.
Overall: 2.0/5. Never, ever buy this, unless you are die hard and had not read the script already. Some of the characters were incoherant at best.",1055203200,11,2842,4.415238095238095

  This DVD is filled with special features like deleted scenes, documemtaries with actors and a whole bunch of other stuff. I'd recomend this DVD.
  I have to talk about the action scenes first, they're awesome. Obi-Wan fights Jango Fett, Yoda fights Dooku, Windu fights Fett, the clone army fights the new droid army, and Anakin fights a group of Tuskan Raiders. A lot of action.
  Also a lot of romance between Anakin and Padme and how they can't love each other since he's a Jedi and she's a senator.

The movie's consistancy is a big improvement over the first one, which seemed to be a big setup for the next two movies.  Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman do a fine job as young actors trying to get serious emotion from a straightforward script.  A script which shows moments of brilliance but is staggered by Lucas' lack of attention to actually DIRECT his actors.  Still, this is Star Wars, no doubt about it.  The oversized machines, the lack of handrails and the astounding number of species makes this a signature piece.  The love story gets a little overdramatic.  It seems if these two socially incompatiable souls were to come together, the chemistry would happen more naturally.  In any event, the pace and story are a little slow as we watch Padme and Anakin find each other during his stint as her bodyguard.  It picks up more as we watch Obi Wan, played with more maturity and conviction by Ewan Mcgreggor, track down the source of a weapon and discover something much, much bigger.  The special effects are incredible, Lucas is the master of turning his visions of other worlds into vast digital masterpieces.  The pace during the last 45 minutes picks up tremendously, with an arena like battle with Anakin and Obi-Wan, showing the Jedi are just as effective without their lightsabers.  There's a full blown battle between men and machines and some superior saber wielding by a little green muppet (actually, he's all CGI in this movie).  Although there is still something missing in this chapter, it's good.  It's very good.

1315464,4,B00003CXKT,"Episode 3 is not that far off.  I have but one wish.  Please, please, George Lucas, hire a decent writer!  The writing in Episode 2 is so pathetically bad that there is no way it could ever live up to it's ultimate potential.  The characters end up being completely underdeveloped as they wade through insipid lines of dialogue.  The framework of the story is more than compelling.  However, special effects alone can't carry a film.  Even one as huge as a Star wars film.
Think about what made the original trilogy so amazing.  The story combined with some great screenplays elevated the films to legendary status.  Interestingly enough, Lucas didn't direct Empire or Jedi.  He also wasn't given the credit for writing the screenplays.  He produced and created the story.  I guarantee, if he had gone back to that formula, we'd be talking about how amazing Episode 1 and 2 were.  Instead, they leave much to be desired.
The movie is still good, don't get me wrong.  It's got a lot of great qualities.  The digital effects are great.  Yoda looks amazing, far better than that silly puppet used in Episode 1.  Yoda's fight scene was heart-stopping.  That said, when you have to depend on effects to carry a film, you're in trouble.  Also, why do all the interesting characters keep getting killed off?  Darth Maul. Jango Fett.  Great characters that were underdeveloped.  Ewan MacGregor, alone, is carrying this franchise.  He is spot-on as Obi-wan Kenobi.  I am looking forward to Episode 3.

 I beg you, PLEASE let someone else write the dialogue for the final Star Wars movie!  You can give the screenwriter the story, the scenes and characters, but I'm begging you, no more ""wooden"" dialogue.  It's downright embarrassing.  I cringe when I hear some of the stuff you force the actors to say.  You wasted the talents of Portman, McGregor and Jackson.
If you can ignore the brutal dialoge (and acting from Christensen), then this movie is amazing visually.  The story is better than that of The Phantom Menace.  The acting is on par with The Menace though (thanks to Lucas).  This is a 5 star movie visually but the character dialoge drags it down to 3.  Just think how great this could've been had a real screenwriter and director got the most out of this cast.  I'm thinking Christensen might be passable as an actor if he wasn't reading ""Lucas Speak"".

1315466,1,B00003CXKT,"This film is so awful, I could write a full-length thesis paper about it. What's amazing to me is how many Amazon.com reviewers acknowledge faults in the movie, and still praise it with five stars.
Attack of the Clones is Star Wars for the Attention Deficit Disorder generation. Lucas has overstuffed sequences with frenetic visuals, hoping to distract viewers into thinking they're entertained, desperately trying to compensate for the lagging, flabby plot and woefully inadeqate characterization. It's really more of a glorified video game than an actual film. Wonder which demographic likes Attack of the Clones the most? It's mostly 12- to 21-year-old boys who grew up on Nintendo, PlayStation, and X-Box. Unfortunately, busy special effects alone do not a great movie make. Frankly, the visuals aren't even that great. There was no show of Force at the Oscars when Attack of the Clones lost the Special Effects trophy to Lord of the Rings.
The biggest flaws in this film center around the scenes between Padme and Anikan. First of all, the dialogue is atrocious, with wooden actors delivering hackneyed lines and cliches at every turn. Honestly, this stuff wouldn't even fly in soap operas. Why should we excuse it in a multi-million dollar movie? Secondly their ""love"" story has no believability, and doesn't develop naturally. Annakin is portrayed as a snotty, arrogant, obsessive boy with a violent temper and psychotic tendencies. So, what exactly draws Padme toward him? Plot contrivances are often awkward or totally head-scratching. Jango sends Zam who sends a droid who sends worms, to kill Padme? And what's with the title? Attack of the Clones? What attack? The clones don't show up until the end of the movie, when they are dispatched to *defend* the Jedi. I will grant the film one star for interesting cinematography and costumes. Also, the fight between Jango and Kenobi is well-choreographed. But give more praise, I can not.
Most disappointing of all, this film is totally devoid of the magic infused into the original trilogy films. Maybe Lucas should have enlisted Lawrence Kasdan, scripter for *two* of the original trilogy movies, including the most critically-lauded, Empire Strikes Back. Lucas is now trying to do everything himself. He wants total control of the universe, but somewhere during his 10-year-plus hiatus from movie-making he lost his edge. Someday twenty years from now, another director will remake the Episodes 1-III. But it will be awhile. Good Star Wars prequels are still ""far, far, away...""",1054252800,8,2538,5.177615571776156
1315467,1,B00003CXKT,"Every minute was boring and painful. Plot lines are nice devices for a weekly drama, but when episodes are 10 years apart viewers just want some adventure and fun.
Lucas should find a talented writer to work on the next storyline WHILE he's shooting an episode. Then they'd come closer together, and he'd end up with an interesting movie.
This movie was so boring that when a pivotal character dies in the middle, I didn't feel sorry for the character, I was envious.",1054252800,6,467,4.63855421686747
1315468,2,B00003CXKT,"Something tells me that when George Lucas was writing this latest film, one of two things happened:
1: He realized that although we are paying for his entire life and lifestyle, he has really grown embittered towards his fans. He finds that he has lost touch with his fanbase, and that he is genuinely angered by the people that tell him that his sauce is weak (as evidenced at least to me by lines such as ""I hate them! I should be all powerful!"").
2: He is living in a dreamworld in which he is still this widely respected film artist that creates films that are nominated for best picture awards.
Obviously, none of the two suppositions I have just made are true. The reality is most likely that George Lucas is simply a director that does the best films that he is capable of, and we as an audience have a far more fond view of his films than he could ever live up to.
That being said, this film was a disappointment. Not surprisingly, the film's special effects are a sight to behold. The land battle is easily as impressive as anything in any previous Star Wars effort. The obligatory lightsabre fight does FEEL obligatory, but it is impressive in the sense that I don't think that one has ever been done in near complete darkness.
But the ACTING!! AGH!! I don't think there is a SINGLE performance in here that is somewhat believable. Hayden Christiansen does not inspire ANY of the emotion that he is attempting to invoke (namely pity that we will see this ""great hero"" fall from grace to become the much more impressive Darth Vader. Instead, he comes off as a whiney little child). Natalie Portman though looking MUCH more attractive to male viewers, seems to trip and fall in love with Anakin only because it is required by the overall plot. We don't see any sort of revulsion that her new boyfriend just slaughtered an entire tribe of people(admittedly hostile, but still people). Ewan McGregor seems to be running completely on autopilot, and I can almost read his thoughts, ""When can I get done with this useless picture so I can get paid and go do something MEANINGFUL?!
DVD production values are not much better. Oh sure the picture, being a direct-digital transfer is STUNNING, and the sound is top-notch. But the deleted scenes are ho-hum, the featurettes boring, and the commentary made me dislike this film even more than I already did (example: now they're not just replacing the shots that they could not have done with model and/or actor with CG, they're using it for nearly EVERYTHING).
In the end, I can't really recommend this film for anyone other than fans of the film. MAYBE for people who want something to show off their new HD home theatre equipment. But as something to just sit and watch? No. Quite simply, it's time for George Lucas to give up his director's chair. He's a competant enough writer, but his directing skills simply are not there (as evidenced by the fact that Episode 5 & 6 are both better than 4 and neither were Lucas directed). He needs to bring someone on who knows how to get a good performance out of his actors as well as gauge what people really want to see.",1054080000,2,3115,4.554367201426025

Acting was superb, with fresh as well as familiar characters.
I was told ahead of time just that Yoda ""shows his stuff"" (As a Jedi Knight)  before the movie, and I was not sure how to take that and not sure how it could be pulled off in a way that was really exciting- but once again I was very surprised at how good this movie was.
This movie combines all the special effect surprises the original trilogy pulled, as well as combining them in a movie with a great, believable plot, with lots of action and even a touching love story for those into love stories.  But what really made this movie was a great story, great acting by all characters (even Yoda), and so much action, drama and amazing special effects it makes you glad Star Wars is back!",1053993600,2,957,4.340782122905028

1315560,4,B00003CXKT,"Well, I must say this was an improvement over the mediocre Episode 1.  It does suffer from certain weaknesses: the dreadful dialogue, a lackluster performance by Hayden Christensen, and a total absence of Darth Maul.  However, this flick is fun to watch, which is harder to say for the original.  First of all, in this one the human actors seem to triumph over the dry, sterile CGI, while in the original we saw nothing but a showcase of computer-generated nonsense.  We see solid performances by the awesome Natalie Portman, and the appearance of Boba and Jango Fett is delightful.  It's also great to see Watto, even though he's CGI.  And the scene where Yoda fights with a lightsaber is a scene Star Wars fans have awaited since 1977.  The story is not weak; indeed, it's the most complex story ever in the Star Wars legacy.  One problem, I'd say, is that with all the conspiracies, traitors, Sith lords and trade federation villains, it gets kind of muddled and boring.  However, it's a good plot.  The scene where Amidala, Anakin and Obi-Wan battle the three beasts was truly awesome--almost as good as the scene in Return of the Jedi when Luke battles the Rancor.  Sure, it's a POS compared to episodes 4, 5 and 6, but I think these prequels should be judged on their own merit and not compared to the original masterpieces.

1315562,5,B00003CXKT,"I personally was highly dissapointed with the ""Phantom Menace"" with it's hihg number of plotholes and often messy lines and childish acting coming from some of the cast on the movie. Jar Jar Binks deserves alot of the ridicule that he was bombarded with in the last Star Wars Movie. In fact ""Phantom Menace"" seemed to be geared more towards the young audience and hardly felt anything like the three classic Star Wars from 1977, 1980, & 1983. The only thing in my opinion that saved it from going down ... for me was the awesome pod-race scene, which I thought was one of the best movie scenes I've ever seen.
""Attack Of The Clones"" on the other is a grand improvement over Episode I and brings on a lot more action, and stronger plot than the other prequel and I have say that ""Attack Of The Clones"" is MORE LIKE IT! This has alot of the good dialogue and intelligence that I thought was mostly absent from Episode I and while this one still has plenty of room for improvement, I have to say that Lucas has managed to correct some of the mistakes of the previous one, especially by giving the brat Jar Jar Binks a much smaller role in this movie than the last and it was wise to do that. I also love the much darker tone of this one compared to the last one. Overall, this movie improves greatly over the last Star Wars movie on almost all fronts but still misses the heights of the original three.
Lucas may have badly misfired on the ""Phantom Menace"" but he and company have managed to get back on their feet and get back on track with ""Attack Of The Clones"". This is definately worth owning, even if just for the fun of the action sequences.",1053561600,,1645,4.326860841423948

He is barely seen in this one, except for a small pivotal scene.  Which leaves Lucas to concentrate on the more important issues of plot and charecter development.  What the Phatom Menace lacked, this is a stunning film that moves the Star Wars saga along nicely...... while having the power to be a stand alone film.

1315675,2,B00003CXKT,"Yes, it is.  Don't tell me that I'm just an unfair, overcritical Star Wars fanatic who can't be satisfied with anything because I've idolized the originals so much.  This is garbage.  Think about it.  WHY were the originals idolized so much?  Why do people buy two copies of the movies, one to watch and one to keep as a collector's item?  Because they were awesome movies.  You say I hate the new ones because I was hyped up about them and they weren't what I expected.  I say I was hyped up because the originals were strokes of mastery.  Why didn't Lucas do it again?  I know why.
Because of Star Wars, George has a ton of money.  Before Star Wars, he had no money.  And because Star Wars was a film that was suffering severely from a low budget, Lucas used the only resource available that was bountiful: his mind.  He sweated and worked for those movies, and the innovation and creativity that was poured into the project is what helped the original movies achieve their immortality.
But George doesn't need to think anymore, and it shows.  The effects in these new movies are gorgeous, but they're not practical.  They're unrealistic.  They're unnecessary.  The machines and robots have countless little details and moving parts that don't serve any purpose whatsoever, but wow, they look good, don't they?  It's all polish, people.  Polish upon polish.  Extra enhancements to make up for the lack of content.  George is simply making things up as he goes along (Hey, you know, this would be neat""), so the atmosphere of the new Star Wars is not coherent.
Whether the acting in the new movies is good or bad really is debatable.  I was very pleased with the cast for The Phantom Menace, save the annoying detestable boy.  When Qui Gon fell, my heart froze, and that's how I knew the actors were doing their job.  The second installment, however, doesn't have a cast that I really care about.  Portman never really did a good job in either movie, with her monotonous dirge of dialogue.  The young man who plays Anakin had a very, VERY tough character to play, and I think he pulled it off very well.  His anger flairs up every once in a while, revealing for only seconds the monster that will soon emerge.  Anakin gets a whole star to save this film.
Obi Won also does a great job (again), with his accent perfectly matching our beloved elderly Obi Won in the earlier/later films.  He does a fine job of portraying a man who has grown a bit since the last film, where his master was slain by the Sith Lord.  But he still retains the ambitious courage that makes him perhaps the greatest Jedi.  Obi Won also gets a whole star, the last one that I give to this film.
Because the script is awful.  I'm thinking in particular where Anakin makes his move on Padime, telling her that she's soft and smooth, unlike the grainy sands of Tatooine.  Ugh.  It's unholy.
It's late, so I'm too tired to drone on about these new Star Wars movies...  All I can say is that I really wanted these movies to be the greatest, so it's not like I'm biased against them or anything.  I enjoy watching them, and always will, but they are a significant tier below the originals.",1052438400,13,3158,4.498239436619718

In Attack Of The Clones George set up the audience for what's to happen in the third film. This flim the clones much better than Phantom,the story was better but the romance was dull and it needs better writing overall. The FX were great like always and we get Master Yoda in action finally and Mace Windo was great in the figtht scenes and it's good to have more jedis fighting.

The CGI that gains so much praise looks cheaply done in places.  The acting is garbage, but if you watch the original three more closely, they were not really about the acting either.  The intrigue of the first three was partly in character development.  The audience saw the characters grow and change together, with their relationships developing along the way.  In these films we have to skip large chunks of people's lives and see more new characters in every film.  The closeness is not there, neither between the main characters, nor with the audience.

We are like in an electronic game. The important section when the new Jedi falls in love with the Senator, when this Jedi, Skywalker, who is going to become Dearth Vader neglects his duties in the name of love and in the face of frustration (the death of his mother, the limitations imposed onto him by his master Obi-Wan,...) is not deep enough, not emotional enough, not human enough. The actor is even slightly stiff and the situation is always too prudish. And yet it is out of this passion that Leia and Luke will be born. We definitely understand that the Chancelor of the Republic, who was elected in the first episode, is the traitor who will become the emperor but we do not understand what his connection with the Force, with the power of Jedis is. How can he have apprentices, on the dark side of the force ? How can that be without the knowledge of the Jedis themselves ? It probably has to come in the third episode, but this makes this episode surreal and dehumanized. Yet a good piece of entertainment if you like computerized action and a good lesson that dictatorship is always produced by democracy, that dictatorship always emerges from democracy

1315749,3,B00003CXKT,"Understanding why Attack of the clones is bad starts with understanding why New Hope and its sequels were so good. It really starts with the very first sequence of NH, Who could ever forget the black-robed Vader emerging through the doorway and not be immediately provoked by this archetypical evil. He is our nhightmares incarnate. The original trilogy is a space opera that  is wrapped arund the most provocative truth of all - that we are the thing we hate the most. This is Freud wit a vengance. The original SW trilogy is great because of 5 words - ""Luke, I am your father."" That phrase takes a ho-hum albeit well-made space opera and turns it into one of the greats of all time. OK, the special effects are great, but its universal appeal is in the deeper stuff - self-hatred, gaia and salvation.
There is sadly no such leitmotif in SW I or II. It is kind of surprising that none is pursued, because they were there to be had. Skywalker being torn from his mother by the Jedi, and his Oedipal pursuit of her is a pretty good start. Sadly it is a line not followed. She is dead and Luke is sad, but he never turns his resentment toward the Jedi who could legitimately be blamed for her continued misery and demise. It did seem a little lame that they had to leave her behind in I. I thought that they might have pursued it after watching I because Luke really is at a vulnerable age as the psychoanalysts would see it. The big theme that could bind the trilogy together is the issue of duty vs. desire, i.e Luke having to make a choice between love and destiny. But Luke is cast as a whining child, resenting his calling, wah, wah, wah. He never learns the lesson of the pitfalls in both, because he gets the  girl. I'm afraid Luke doesn't get an A in the First Noble Truth in this one. If Lukas wants us to leave the theater feeling good that someone can have both a good time and save the universe too, he is short changing our intelligence. Oh, by the way, George, what iis the deal about Amadala giving up her crown? I thought that you were born to it. Dropping her station makes us lose the theme of unattainable perfection that was part of I, turning Amadala int a plain Jane in II.
I don't know, maybe the denoument is somewhere in the third film. The speculation might be that Senator Palpatine finally shows himself as the evil emperor, and somehow Amadala is killed in the struggle between him and the Jedi. Luke blames his Jedi buddies, turning to the dark side. Obi-Wan is exiled because of the turn of events and Amadala's two kids are separated. The one becoming a senator, the other a farmboy daydreamer. There will be no apotheosis; Mr. Lucas will have to remind us of the trilogy that he made 25 years ago.
Out of all of this, I figured out why Lucas hasn't graced us with a DVD version of the originals, though. If he took the chance and gave us NH, ESB and RotJ, we wouldn't pay money to see AotC.
There is no doubt that all 5 flms are one great shootem up, and technological marvels of special effects. AotC is a terific film if you want to duck laser blasts and see a space melodrama. Where it fails is in the absence of the infusion of genius that was transfused into the orignal trilogy and left us craving for more for a quarter of a century.",1051660800,,3271,4.3257328990228014

With the same computer generated style of Episode I, Clones has succeeded in making a very fine looking film.

Second, regarding the movie, it is very dissapointing in all sort of ways, but to make it short, episodes 1 & 2 are prequals to the most exciting and remembered sci-fi movies ever made. to create thease prequals almost 15 years later is a very hard task not to be taken lightly. there are soooo many fans out there who waited for thease episodes and most were dissapointed.
I think Lucas forgot to invest in the things that really make a movie - script/plot and acting. special effects are only second, but come very close in movies like this.he did the opposite, special effects and sound are amazing and the script and actors are awfull... he did choose good actors, but directed them not good at all... a waste of talents, he knew all the fuss that is going on about the new movies, so he should have made more effort into the script, with less (a lot less) bad jokes, less cgi, and if he isn't sure about his directing, then give it to someone else. you don't take such a good series and turn it upside down !
Still the new prequals were very successfull, becasue everybody wanted to see the new star wars.

  It's interesting to note that while the talents of Ewan MacGregor, Anthony Daniels, and other veteran actors made this movie passable, the two low points were Hayden and Natalie. George Lucas has stooped to using sex appeal to attract viewers instead of plot. I never saw Mark Hamill or Harrison Ford topless, and Carrie Fisher's outfits were always attractive, but somewhat more subtle. Here, though, we have a bare-chested Hayden, Natalie Portman wears outfits that you KNOW had to be cutting off her circulation, and we are treated to a stretch pants-wearing type bar at the bottom of Coruscant. Samuel Jackson's character lacks any CHARACTER whatsoever, being strictly one-dimensional. Christopher Lee does a fine job of playing Count Dooku, and Ewan is magnificent as Obi-Wan. Too bad the story couldn't have centered around them.

1315849,5,B00003CXKT,"I am one of the many movie-lovers who did not much love The Phantom Menace. I didn't really think Attack of the Clones would be much good either, but to my surprise, I really loved this movie. I now own the DVD and watch it a lot.
Many viewers complained about the Padme/Anakin love story. They said it was ""too cheesy!"" Well, come on, this is STAR WARS! Of course it's gonna be cheesy, that's just how it was supposed to be! I liked the love story, though at times it is very over-written, and really loved the orchestral love theme score. It was a nice romance that I hope will be developed even further in Episode 3, which I am very much anticipating.
But any Sexual Harrassment Panda is gonna pick the action over the lovely romance, and being THE SHP, I definitely decided that the action in the film was the strongest element. It takes a while to build up to the BIG action scenes but this is a lot more fast-paced than the other movies. The chase through Coruscant is cool and nicely played. The factory scene was unbelievably intense and always enjoyable. It reminded me a lot of the pie-making in Chicken Run - and I love that film. The battle in the coliseum was very impressive, intense and full of action. I found myself whooping out loud in happiness and fright! Then of course we leave the coliseum and find out there's this big other battle going on outside, and then Yoda vs. Christopher Lee, which, in my humble opinion, is the COOLEST scene of any 2002 movie! I mean how can you not adore the little powerful Jedi finally showing us what he's made of with a lightsaber! Yoda is my favourite character and he has one of the biggest parts in the film so I was VERY happy!
The acting in this film was really good I thought. Many said it was actrocius and horrible, and some of the actors where even nominated for Razzie awards. The Razzies are stupid if you ask me because they nominate the actors regardless if the film is nominated. Hayden Christensen, who WON the WORST SUPPORTING ACTOR award at the Razzies, was great in my opinion, he had a complex role and played it well. His expressions were very haunting. Ewan McGregor is becoming more and more reminiscent of the old Obi-Wan from A New Hope. Natalie Portman has a lot more to do in this movie and her character becomes more developed. She's very sexy and a good actress, and she shouldn't have been nominated or a Razzie either.
The visuals here are as impressive as in any of the Star Wars movie, but I'd be lying if I said George didn't overdo it a little bit. He just went a little over-the-top and got a big head. I hope there's some budget let over for Episode 3! =)
I loved this movie and found it disappointing that so many of fellow SW fans hated it. It's the most action-packed of the series and the second best if you ask me - right behind The Empire Strikes Back. Bring on Episode III!
--- DVD REVIEW ---
Awesome DVD! Lots and lots of special features, as well as a great, flawless picture, and digitally mastered sound that makes the battle and combat scenes even more effective and intense. The commentary on the first disk is good for all us SW fans interested in the production and effects sides of things. Of course they go into other aspects of the movie too. There are many sound options, and lots of subtitles you can have. The deleted scenes kick off the second disk and are a hoot. I think they should've kept Padme's family dinner scene in. It develops her character a lot. There is also a couple of documentaries on the disk, going deeply into the effects and puppets and such. From Puppets to Pixels is an especially interesting featurette. There is three featurettes showing different aspects of the film which is very interesting, and my personal favourite is R2-D2, Beneath the Dome, which is a mockumentary which treats R2 like a real Hollywood actor. Lots of fun is to be had on this DVD, and I've hardly mentioned any of the special features - it's best just to get out and buy this yourself!",1050451200,3,3998,4.426051560379919
1315850,3,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones is one of those movies where you just wish you had the opportunity to write the script, there is just so much wrong with the movie that at times it's really hard to watch.  I won't touch on the somewhat questionable dialog as I think everyone has more than[...]about it.
For starters Obi Wan never shows father like love for Anakin which through out the movie they like to say is there.  Then there is one seen where Obi Wan just seem like an [...], he wants to find a planet but the map does not show a planet where he thinks it should be but yet out show that there is gravitational pull there...he needs a child to tell him there is a planet there...just stupid.
But my real problem with the movie is the lost opportunity that George Lucas had with the Clone Wars, which I think should have been the main part of the movie, not the last 10-15mins. It would have been nice to see the strain of war on the Jedi...a kind of Saving Private Ryan, with maybe a little less violence.
Also I think seeing the relationship between Anakin and Padme, though necessary, could have been done better by quick one minute flashes to them and then back to the story to show that time is going by for them, that they are getting closer and to keep the story moving.
One last thing, I can't help but hope that Lucas Films stop using such overly colorful worlds which just remind you that it's all CG...they need only watch ""Lord Of The Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring"" to see how CG should be done.
Overall this is an OK movie...more so for the true Star Wars fan than the average movie watcher who might get upset with the dialog, the somewhat [weak] romantic parts and the over use of ""unrealistic"" looking eye candy.  This is a three out of five stars, no doubt about it.",1050364800,,1782,4.281899109792285

Its now hard to be intimidated by Darth Vader in the older Star Wars movies when you realize he was your whiny little sister as a youth. That being said the second 45 minutes are possibly the funniest thing ever captured on film.....err digital recording. Yoda fighting with a lightsabre hopping around , seemingly floating... One persons name is Count Dooku...come on say it..... Dooku.... its fun! People plummet out of ships  a hundred feet in the air, land, and are fine. It's truly an entertaining experience.

I had this big long complex review typed up and ready to go that would argue against all of the negative potshots people have fired at this film and it's predocessor but decided that rather than argue I should can the ego and just state what I happened to like about it.
The scale of the story is epic in the way that only Star Wars movies can be epic.  We care about the fate of the entire galaxy as much as we care about the fortunes of individual characters from Anakin's enslaved mother to the lovable droids.  I disagree with staunch puppet traditionalists, I think the digital Yoda was as moving and effective as ever.  I  really loved the depth and range of emotions he conveyed in this one and I was especially happy to see him in action.  He continues to be my favorite character and I really like the way this film took him from wisdom spouting hermit to dynamic warrior/sage.
The special effects continue to push the envelope.  And as always they are storytelling tools thaht do not (I feel) hinder the narrative but take us further into the Star Wars universe.
I love this installment and I can't wait to see where the next one takes us.",1050278400,3,1260,4.452173913043478
1315853,1,B00003CXKT,"First, let me say some positives about this DVD:
The image and sound quality are amazing.  This DVD is probably the best quality DVD to date.  Great for showing off a high quality home theater.  Since the movie was shot on digital film, there was almost no ghosting or image quality lost.
Now the negatives:
What made the original Star Wars movies so spectatular was their campy dialog, fake but realistic special effects (even though you knew it was a fake spaceship you still knew it was a picture of a real model).  The older Star Wars films were mostly a tribute to the cheesey sci-fi movies of the 50's and 60's.  A true space opera, they were classics.
Episode II relies mostly on the impressive special effects to mesmerize and entertain.  Acting and story are second to this.  The totally cardboard acting of Haeden Christianson is so bad, that it makes you wonder if he should play an emotionally repressed andriod instead of the future Darth Vader. It made me miss Jar Jar.
Oustanding special effects that circumvent the rest of the movie.  This movie seems to be made mostly just to fill a quota and to set up the clearly superior episodes 3-6.  Makes you sad to see a performer past his prime, and Star Wars is way past its prime.",1050019200,18,1242,4.533632286995516
1315854,5,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars is not just a series of films.  They are a cult legend, a culture on its own.  I know that there has been so much debate on the difference between the prequels and the original trilogy, but because I am a biased Star Wars fan, I am not one to mess with.
Phantom Menace parallels A New Hope in the fact that both films represent a beginning.  In ""Attack of the Clones"", this is very much akin to ""The Empire Strikes Back"" because of the cliffhanger ending which makes us wish that Bill Gates or some other guy can invent a real time machine so we can go to 2005 and see the last prequel.
""AOTC"" is set 10 years after ""TPM"", and the Republic is falling apart because of the mysterious Count Dooku.  You'll have to be a little blind or deaf not to see the conspiracy that is going on in this film, but a clone army has been made for the Republic to defend them from those who have proven themselves traitors to the Republic.  Anakin Skywalker is a restless, adventurous, reckless padawan Jedi who falls in love with the wise, mature, and balanced Senator Padme.  They travel because of a safety threat to the Senator, and in this process, they do fall in love and before the Clone War begins, they eventually give in to their feelings.
Hayden Christensen, I'm in love with you.  You're a brilliant actor and although your acting in this film was rather below your real level as I've seen in your other film, you make the perfect Anakin Skywalker.  Natalie Portman is equally good.
The DVD itself is a treasure.  20 years from now, this will appear on ebay auctions, so better get your copy now.  And the easter egg which features the outtake reel will make you realize how clumsy Hayden is.",1049846400,4,1697,4.375796178343949
1315855,5,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars Episode II: The Saga Continues...
In 2002, Star Wars fans celebrated the silver anniversary of the release of Episode IV: A New Hope (the first film actually released) in various ways...by going to the Cincinnati Celebration...by purchasing 25th Anniversary memorabilia (such as Hasbro's trio of Silver Anniversary ""two-pack"" mini dioramas - which I happen to own)...and by going to the local multiplex to watch Episode II - Attack of the Clones.
This movie has everything Star Wars fans love.  A good screenplay, awesome visual and sound effects, a fantastic John Williams score...and...Yoda fights in this one!
Considering the undeserved ""bad movie"" reputation of its predecessor, The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones was received by most Star Wars fans with ""This is more like it!"" I think Episode II - with its more grown up Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and its depiction of the beginning of the Clone Wars - is the film most fans wanted The Phantom Menace to be, without Jake Lloyd's ""good little Ani"" and certainly far less of the much maligned Jar Jar Binks.  Yet, the more one watches Episode II (and the DVD's existence certainly makes this possible), the more one appreciates The Phantom Menace as a necessary piece of exposition.  As some of my fellow customer reviewers have pointed out in their reviews of The Phantom Menace, all of the cornerstones and plot lines in Attack of the Clones were laid down in Episode I.
Episode II is set 10 years after the events of The Phantom Menace.  With the defeat of the Trade Federation, Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) has served her terms as Queen of Naboo and is now representing her home system in the Galactic Senate.  A firm believer in democracy and peaceful negotiations, she is committed to saving the Republic from disintegration.  It will not be an easy task, however, since a secessionist movement led by a renegade former Jedi Master has caused several thousand star systems to leave the Republic.
Meanwhile, ex-Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), now Supreme Chancellor of the Republic, is mulling over the creation of an Army of the Republic to confront the growing threat of the separatists.  Given the relatively small number of Jedi Knights in the galaxy (less than 10,000, which is tiny indeed given the fact that the Republic spans nearly an entire galaxy), this on the surface seems reasonable, even though viewers who saw the Classic Trilogy know that this is simply one more step to the transformation of the Republic to the evil Empire.
The plot of this movie revolves around a plot to assasinate Senator Amidala to prevent her from voting against the Military Creation Act now before the Senate.  It fails (otherwise there would be no Luke or Leia later), and Palpatine suggests that Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker protect Amidala from further attacks. Of course, we fans know that this is just another clever plot-within-a-plot by Palpatine/Darth Sidious .  It puts Anakin in close proximity to Padme again, which causes the young Jedi Padawan's emotional ties to the former Queen of Naboo to resurface with a vengeance.  It is a win-win scenario for Palpatine: if Padme dies either at the hands of bounty hunters or the secessionists, he removes the political opposition to the Army of the Republic.  If Obi-Wan and Anakin do manage to protect her, they are out of the way and so is Padme, which is, of course, what ensues in Attack of the Clones.
The DVD version of Episode II was made from the purely digital version of the movie, which means that some scenes (particularly the fight on Geonosis and the secret wedding on Naboo) are subtly different from some versions seen in non-digital movie theaters.  Unlike the DVD release of Episode I, no deleted scenes were restored (but are included in the Extra Features disc), and there is no complete ""Making of"" documentary feature such as ""The Beginning"" in the extra features disc of The Phantom Menace.  The audio commentary (by George Lucas, Rick McCallum, Ben Burtt, Rob Coleman, Pablo Helman, John Knoll and Ben Snow) is heavy on the production side but light on the lore side.  (The main weak point I see with the Star Wars DVDs as a whole is that unlike the Star Trek Director's and Collector's Edition re-releases, the only way you can get text commentaries is by going online.  This is fine for those of us who have Internet Service Providers, but not so great for those that don't...plus you have to remain connected to read it!) The usual assortment of trailers, John Williams music video (why don't they include JW on the text commentary? Or give him a feature documentary?) and behind the scenes material fill out the extra features supplementary disc.
The nicest, if rather unexpected, bonus was how fast Attack of the Clones was released on DVD.  Most of the time, early home video release meant (and still means) that the film did poorly at the box office. Attack of the Clones did quite well at the box office last year, outpaced only by the well-made Spider-Man feature (and it did better than Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and Star Trek: Nemesis).  Some cynics suggested it was exactly for that reason that Attack of the Clones came out in 2002 rather than 2 years later (as The Phantom Menace did): that it had done badly.  I think it was the fact that it was shot digitally (no need to transfer from film to digital video) and a further 25th Anniversary gift from Lucasfilm, 20th Century Fox, and George Lucas to us fans.",1049760000,4,5530,4.833862433862434
1315856,3,B00003CXKT,"The prequels continue to prove to be an unnecessary addition to the Star Wars Universe. ""Episode I: The Phantom Menace"" was quite a debacle for everyone except George Lucas, who laughed all the way to the bank with a huge box-office. In terms of acting, plot development, and expansion of the Star Wars mythos, it failed miserably and disappointed a legion of fans. The second prequel, ""Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" further damages the overall mystique of the original trilogy (though, it's not a half-bad stand-alone movie. Hence, it's 3-star rating). It's a shame that the magic and mystery of the original trilogy has been undermined by these prequels. It's nearly impossible to watch the original now and feel the same sense of wonder.

As with ""Phantom Menace"", there were many areas where Lucas went wrong. The first one, obviously, is with the title. ""Attack of the Clones"" is impossible to take seriously and doesn't even truly represent what the movie is about. A title like this instantly invites ridicule and derision. The number of ""It sounds like 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes'"" comments were innumerable. One of the other working titles for this movie was ""The Clone War"". That title would have made much more sense than ""Attack of the Clones"", as the Clone War was an important historical reference in the original trilogy. In addition, the plot of the movie deals primarily with the establishing the beginning of that war.

Throwing aside the dumb title, there are other glaring weaknesses in this movie. One of the worst is the alleged 'history' of legendary bounty hunter, Bobba Fett. Despite his ignoble death in ""Return of the Jedi"", Fett was one of the most popular characters in the original trilogy. The air of mystery surrounding his identity and his origins enhanced such popularity. Now, we find out that he's the child (really a clone) of another bounty hunter named Jango Fett. Not only does seeing Bobba Fett as a 10-year old kid make him seem as unthreatening as showing Darth Vader as little 8-year old brat did, this origin doesn't mesh with other past references to his history.

Another area of weakness is the arctic cold romance between Queen (now Senator) Padme Amidala and an older (compared to ""Phantom Menace"") Anakin Skywalker. Part of what made ""Empire Strikes Back"" so good was the understated budding romance between Han and Leia. It was subtle and brought along slowly, reaching a zenith with the Leia/Han classic exchange ""I love you"", ""I know"". In ""Attack..."" this comparable romance feels like it's being hammered into our skulls that these two are supposed to be in love, despite the fact there is exactly zero chemistry between them. The dialogue they share is even more atrocious. There's not a single memorable line between them and it's probably best to tune the two of them out when they are speaking to each other. Supposedly this illicit romance and other events are supposed to foreshadow Anakin's eventual turn to the Dark Side of the 'Force', but there's really no sense of that happening. Even at the end, he seems too much like a happy-go-lucky, devil-may-care teenager, not some brooding individual scarred by the events life has thrown at him.

The biggest problem with this movie, though, is its continued abuse of a realistic timeline for these events. This movie is supposed to take place 22 years before ""A New Hope"" and we're supposed to believe that characters such as Luke Skywalker's Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru, who appeared to be in their upper 50's in ""A New Hope"", were just a young (late teens, early 20's) married couple here. We are also supposed to believe that a galaxy and government that had no standing military of any kind was turned into such an overwhelming military society in such a short period of time. It's well known that George Lucas intended the rise of the Empire and Emperor Palpatine to be an allegory of the rise of the Third Reich and Hitler in Germany. The difference is that Germany had the military/industrial infrastructure in place and Hitler merely co-opted it for his own purposes. There's no such thing in this galaxy. Yet, we're supposed to buy into the fact that this all-pervasive Empire with such a menacing military could be developed in less than 20 years. Even suspension of disbelief doesn't allow one to make that kind of leap in logic. It's impossible and it's aggravating that Lucas would try to imply otherwise.

Problems aside, there are a couple of redeeming elements to ""Attack of the Clones"". The vicious battle that takes place at the end of the movie is a truly visual treat. The rain world that is home to the clone-producing facility in the first prequel world that matches fascination produced by such original trilogy worlds as Hoth and Tatooine. The character of Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus (played menacingly well by veteran Christopher Lee) is badly needed charismatic addition to this moribund group of actors. Dooku's lightsaber battle with a certain Jedi Master is quite a highlight, if a tad incongruous. There's even a great quote by Jango Fett who says, ""I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe"".

In the end, these good points balance the bad just enough to make ""Attack of the Clones"" and barely recommendable movie. As long as you're not too obsessive and analytical a Star Wars fan (like I am), you should be able to enjoy this movie as a good Saturday popcorn flick.",1049760000,4,5430,4.845905172413793
1315857,1,B00003CXKT,"Ok, seriously does George Lucas actually think he can make good movies anymore? Both Episode I&II have to be the biggest let down to anyone who is/was a fan of the originals and a let down to anyone that has taste in good cinema. It amazes me that Lucas made 3 of the best movies ever (Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi) with barely any money, but give him an unlimited budget and he makes the worst movies ever (Phantom Menace, and Attack of the Clones)...go figure!

1315943,5,B00003CXKT,"Will you people KINDLY realize what work goes into making a good movie? No plot? Balderdash!! The Federation attempts to assassinate Padme. This leads Obi Wan to Genosia and Annakin from Coruscant to Naboo and back to Tatooine.
Turns out a former Jedi is conspiring with the Federation to secede from the empire, which eventually involves a showdown with the Jedi and a battle royal by the end of the film. This is a weak plot?? And in the OTHER camp...too MUCH plot? Can you name me a movie with intrigue as a major aspect that DIDN'T have a complex, twisting plot? I can't!
Okay, I will give you wooden acting in some parts, especially the fellow playing Jango Fett. But Hayden Christiansen? The kid exudes a very good Holden Caulfield-y vibe, but with enough respect for his elders to keep you from calling him a whiny brat. Every male teen goes through this stage, some worse than others, and I think Christiansen handled this better than most young actors would.
The visuals actually OUTCLASS ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Phantom Menace"": the ""Blade Runner""-like details of planet Coruscant; the adventure in the droid factory; the battle on Tatooine...there are entirely too many great visual moments in the movie to mention. Is there something wrong with that? Need I remind you that it takes TONS of man-hours to program CGI software to get things just right to produce such visual and idiosyncratic realism, and that the actors often have to react to things that aren't even there? People like you and AMPAS ought to realize just what acting chops go into making a good sci-fi movie a good sci-fi movie. And make no mistake, this is one of the best science fiction movies ever made!
Until you bozos can produce something on this level yourself, I'll thank you not to discourage people who may have not seen it, but would probably enjoy it if it weren't for a pretentious bunch of geeks trying to sound like Ebert and Roeper in picking apart a clearly superior piece of filmmaking. I might add that Roger Ebert never produced a good movie script in his life!
It's not COMPLETELY perfect, however, as even (( I )) have some problems with some plot points, for instance:
The death of Schmi Skywalker. Why was this just tossed off like somebody walking to the corner. Why was she kidnapped? Was the Federation behind it? Dooku? Or were the Sand People working alone? Her husband seemed to be pretty offhand about it, didn't he?
Why wasn't Annakin allowed to go back for Padme after she fell out of the transport unit? She was an important part of the team and I'm sure if Obi Wan or Annakin had been in the same spot, they would have expected to be saved by the others....The other personnel tranports could have pursued and CAPTURED Dooku without them! Strange!
How in the BLOODY hell are we supposed to accept Jar Jar Binks as a senator from Naboo?? Why didn't they send Boss Nass if they wanted to recruit from the Gungans??
And somebody PLEASE tell Lucas to get rid of freaking C3PO! He adds NOTHING to the movies....NOTHING!
Anyway....buy this movie, people, and you TOO can wonder why those home scenes with Padme and Annakin weren't left in the movie! (The scene revolving around the doomed young aliens in the wall pictures is quite touching.)
Highly recommended!",1049500800,,3278,4.692708333333333
1315944,3,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones is a significantly superior film to The Phantom Menace, yet still falls short of any of the films from the first trilogy. Lucas still has this hang up with CGI and still seems to overuse it. Even in the few years between Ep 1 and Ep 2 the CGI improvements are quite startling, but he still can't do water properly, re Kimono. However...it is not the CGI, nor even its quality that makes a good movie; you still need a good story, tell it well, and have good acting and dialogue to carry and move the story along.
This is where Lucas falls down. With the help of Jonathan Hales the screenplay is superior to TPM, but dialogue still sounds contrived, especially when compared to some of the sharp, witty and clever dialogue that takes place between Han Solo and Princess Leia from the first trilogy. Anakin is rarely called by name, rather he is a Padawan learner, young apprentice, young jedi and so on. Between Obi Wan and Anakin use of first names would have endeared their relationship moreso.
Probably the greatest selling point for a three star rating is the fact the film advances the story and begins to hark back to the original trilogy. The viewer can begin to have fun with this film. So that is where the storm troopers come from! That's where the deathstar comes from! And so on.
Many critics are scathing of the clumsy romance between Anakin and Padme, but this is a young, teenage love and what young love is not like this anyway? I think these critics probably forgot just how timid and shy their very first teenage romance was like.
Critics have also been critical of Hayden Christensen's performance. I agree that he does seem awkward in the early stages of the movie, but 30-40 minutes into the film he does relax and begins to warm up to the part. Acting against green and blue screens would not be easy at the best of times, least of all when you are a young actor.
Although I have criticised some of the banter between Obi Wan and Anakin, this relationship has charm about it that gives the film a warmth that TPM lacked. It's good to see Ewan McGregor easing and relaxing into his role as Obi Wan, and hopefully by the next movie he will be completely at ease and learn to do more than just recite lines.

Not that I expected the Holy Grail but what I think Lucas needed was another perspective in this series, like another director.  Also the story is already known, it's just how it unfolds.  A story that is known doesn't surprise in the way that a new tale does.  While you may consider that good triumphing over evil in Return of the Jedi is sort of pre-destined in a plot, this whole Darth Vader thing is playing out rather badly.  There aren't any surprises but the actual action that occurs.  A lot of this film is about marketing, being large, being EVERYWHERE.

1315948,3,B00003CXKT,"I have read some really harsh reviews on Attack of the Clones.  I don't think it was such a bad movie.  I saw it in the theatres
3 times and the movie was much better on the big screen then on DVD. The real positives of the movie, a beautiful score by John Williams, one of his best. An intriguing plot that keeps you guessing.  The fight of the Jedi Knights in the arena and best of all, the ending lightsaber duel with the energetic Yoda.
Hayden Christensen is a perfect Anaking Skywalker.  He is charming, whiney and down right full of himself (like alot of young people).  Natalie Portman is rather wooden as an actress, but great acting and dialogue is not why you watch a Star Wars movie. My main complaints, the look of the movie on DVD is too bright, since most of the movie was CG created, it tends to look like your watching a video game. When the actors are shot in front of a blue screen and composited on a miniture set the background looks too unnatural. Was it necessary for Anakin to ride an ugly CG tick/armadillo creature?  Was it to show off to Padme, or was ILM trying to impress the audience with yet another CG creature. It would have been far more effective, if he had done tricks on a nice horse.  They have horses on Naboo don't they?
The CG Yoda moves better than a puppet, but the face lacks the depth and texture as in the previous movies. I feel the abundance of the CG effects took over the movie. Like an artist, Lucas tends to put too much paint on his canvas.  The simplicity of the original Star Wars will never be outdone. You can't fault Lucas though, he gave his audience everything he had and it was enjoyable and much better then episode 1. In the next movie though I hope Lucas narrows the Star Wars universe and focuses more closely on his live action characters instead of the ones made of pixels.",1049155200,,1839,4.294797687861272

Rounding out the main cast is Natalie Portman, who gives a very wooden performance, and shows no real emotion (especially to Anakin), in most of her scenes. In my opinon Portman's performance was better in episode one. And most of the scene's that she does show some emotion in, where deleted! (Check out disc 2) As for the annoying Jar Jar Binks....he is barely in the film, with only two real scenes!
The film starts out ten years after ""Phantom"" on Coruscant, the Republic's captial. After a assassin try's to kill senator Padme Amidala ( formally known as Queen Amidala), Obi-Wan and his padawan (Anakin) are sent to protect her. After a long action scene, Anakin and Padme head back to Naboo, while Obi-Wan heads to Kamino to find out some important information. Soon after landing on Naboo, Padme and Anakin share their first kiss, and Anakin decalare's his love for her. Soon they are forced to head to Tatooine, to help find his mother (Shmi from episode one). Meanwhile Obi-Wan discovers clones, of a bounty hunter (Jango Fett),  that are being made for the Republic, to serve as an army. And back in Corucsant, Jar Jar gives Chancellor Palpatine complete power over the Republic(I think we all know what happens because of Jar Jar, think Empire). At the end of the film, they all get back together, just in time for a major Jedi fight.
Over all this film is about 2 1/2 to 3 stars, but the extra features make it 4. They may not be as good as episode one's features, but the menu's and movie are!",1048032000,2,2292,4.659259259259259

The romance between Anakin and Amidala blossoms as does the resentment between Obi-wan and Anakin. Obi-wan goes on a fact finding mission, and stumbles into something that Anakin and Amidala try to get him out of. Enter the clones...
Of course I have left out a ton of specifics. The story itself is well constucted, even if a bit slow paced at times, usually during the love scenes. The feeling wasn't there and neither was the acting. Amidala seemed to be reading cue cards, not acting.
In my humble opinion this movies only saving grace is Obi-wan Kenobi's journey to discover the secrets of teh plot against Amidala and the creation of a Clone army. Here you have the action that has been lacking thus far (with the exception of the first chace scene), the mystery, and the effects. Finally, after fighting sleep on and off throught out the film you arrive at the real purpose of the film, the long and drawn out battle scene on Geonosis, but don't get me wrong, it is spectacular.
All in all I liked it, but I may be partial to George Lucas and the Star Wars series. There are a few flaws I am not used to seeing in a Lucas film, but everyone is allowed an off day.

1316091,4,B00003CXKT,"it seems more people disliked this movie worse than part I.  i liked it.  the story of the galactic empire on the verge of civil war and in the process anakin starts his road toward the dark side of the force.  special effects are great, acting is great despite some flaws (and minimal jar jar biks..thank you)
  the flaws with the actors: first was with obi wan.  there just seemed to be something flat about ewan mcgreggor's performance regarding his training of anakin.  something missing, maybe the warmth and chemistry he had with qui gon jinn?.  i was disappointed jake lloyd would not be allowed to return.  i was so so on hayden as darth vader/anakin sywalker.  some of his ""dark"" moments, although convincing seemed a bit forced.  not forced emotion but it seemed the pace of the movie was faster than the story and some things had to be sped up to keep up.
  for example, i never felt amadala'a love for anakin.  i sort of felt anakin's love for padme but not completely. ... kind of left a sour taste in my mouth.  i still loved the movie.  seeing yoda at the end, kick some butt was funnyand entertaining.  the swordfighting was amazing, some of the shots were just breathtaking.  battle scene at the end was wild.  the clone army was great and i love the story line, the ships, the whole world that is created.
  all in all a great film.  i think most people did not like it because they were expecting something.  what exactly i am not sure but this is a new generation of star wars.  to see it, after the original three(episodes iv-vi) is so drastic.  especially for people in my generation.  keep an open mind.  i loved this movie despite the flaws.  it is the star wars equivalent of star trek's next generation but, in my opinion, better.",1047513600,,1756,4.4715189873417724

1316093,2,B00003CXKT,"The deterioration of the Star Wars films finds its ultimate expression here, in a sappy and indulgent piece of filmmaking.  I was willing to buy ""The Phantom Menace""--it covered Anakin's childhood, so it was allowed to be a little sappy and cheesy.  But ""Attack of the Clones"" has problems, beginning with its title.  The title makes it sound like a medical thriller novel, or something.  The next flawed element is the casting.  Whoever decided that Hayden Christensen would be good in this movie, or any movie for that matter, is proven sorely mistaken in his first five minutes onscreen.  He seems to have two emotions: childish, pouty sulking or squinting determination.  The other supporting actors are not so bad, but they seem too aware of the third and by far worst element that is flawed in this film:  the script.  There are moments (many of them) where actors actually seem embarassed that their lines are that bad.  The romance scenes between Anakin and Padme come off seeming forced and adolescent as a result of cliched dialogue and Christensen's wooden performance.  When the dialogue is not uninspired (""We'd be living a lie.  I couldn't do that""), it is practically nonsensical (""I hate sand.  It's coarse and gritty and it gets everywhere""--and this is supposed to be romantic!).  The film has serious pacing problems; in fact, the only parts that kept me consistently entertained were the ones featuring Obi-Wan's adventures on his own.  I suppose this film is worth seeing for fans to know where Lucas is heading with the story, but I personally don't plan to see this film again.

1316096,1,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones is a movie perfectly content to be just good enough to make die-hard fans happy. Yoda fights, Anakin duels with two(!) lightsabers, and we get a glimpse of a young Boba Fett and his dad. What sounds like a classic Star Wars film to some, comes off as bad self-parody to most. It feels like an internet Star Wars fan fiction piece.
The plot of this film is centered around the political intrigue of the decaying Republic, as senators and jedi jockey for power behind the scenes. What the filmakers forgot is that this is a prequel and we know who the bad guy is, so all of the mystery around this plot is ruined from the get-go. In between the political intrigues, we get time for a truly insipid love story, acted out by two people who don't even appear to like each other off-screen and have all the charisma of two glaciers rubbing together. I've seen disney movies with more eroticism.
Then we come to Yoda fighting; the ""best star wars scene ever"" for some was the final nail in the coffin to this series for me. In desperate need to try and create something spectacular for fans to remember, George Lucas took his most beloved character, gutted any sense of the character's identity or personality, and turned Yoda into a video game character. In one short scene we got to see George Lucas' creative vapidity on display for all. Bravo, George.
While the new Star Wars franchise seems content to churn out perfectly mediocore films that appeal only to kids and extremely easy to please fanboys, other film series are actually trying to break new ground, instead of relying on thier name to keep them successful.

1316097,3,B00003CXKT,"I was quickly enamoured by Episode II when I saw it at midnight on opening night.  Although I had reservations due to the acting job done by Hayden Christensen, Anakin Skywalker, I liked the movie thoroughly.  This idea started to diminish on my second viewing of the movie.
Probably three days later, I went to see the movie again.  However, this time, I started to realize that was not as high quality as I thought it was.  The two big killers were the love story and Christensen's acting.
I may be cynical about young love, but that does not change the truth of this claim:  The love story in Episode II was absolutely terrible.  It is a long drawn out plot of Christensen asking for love and getting shot down almost every time.  It's not very novel to have an aspiring individual and someone who really shouldn't marry fall in love.  Not only that, but whoever wrote the love scenes between Christensen and Portman really must have been trying to make them corny.  That's all I can say.  It just leaves one groaning as they watch the adjective corny become substantive in a movie form.
I'm not trying to be mean so I'm not going to say that Christensen is a bad actor.  My only major qualm with his acting is that his vocal inflections leave something to be desired.  It may not even be his fault, it could be the people who were coaching his acting.  I just know that it didn't help the movie.
The only major positive aspect of the movie is that it shows how the Empire of episodes IV, V, and VI, begins to rise from the Republic.  It is probably the most interesting part of the storyline because it shows some depth.
I'll give the move 3 stars out of 5 because it is entertaining.  It is just that certain elements make you groan.  That isn't even a bad thing, but the groans stick out in my memory in many ways, which is a bad thing.",1047081600,,1842,4.342105263157895

Ewan McGregor did a fine job as Obi-Wan Kenobi, even more so in this movie than in Phantom Menace.  The story was well written, combining the various elements of romance (Anakin/Padme), mystery (Obi Wan's search for Jango Fett and what it uncovered), and political intrigue into one very enjoyable movie.

1316146,5,B00003CXKT,"If it's even possible, this chapter in the Star Wars saga had even more to live up to than it's predecessor The Phantom Menace.
While the first was lightsabered to pieces by critics, non-fans and especially the 'old school' fans, Lucas laboured away on the second installment, knowing full well that if this newest addition wasn't well received than the final episode planned would die a slow and agonising death at the box office, whether it was a Star Wars film or not, and while steadfastly declaring that reactions to his first film in over twenty two years had done nothing to alter his approach to the second installment, the mass' wishes seem to have been pandered to in the overwhelmingly intense Episode II (I refuse to call it Attack of the Clones).
This is why I go to the movies, to be blown away, and Episode II achieved this in spades. Taking the already estabilished environments, ideals, theories and character traits from Episode I and drenching each one in darker and bleaker tones and shades, Episode II is a natural and stunning progression. The set pieces triple in intensity and the plot begins to open up suggesting new and at once familiar ground linking to the original trilogy. The effects are mind blowing, the music enthralling, the mysteries intriguing and the action scenes leave you gasping. So I have one question : why is there so many people that didn't like this film?
Okay, the acting is an obvious target, I personally think Hayden Christensen did a wonderful job bringing to life a character that everybody already has formed their ideas of what should be like, hence, not the real Anakin, i.e: Lucas' Anakin, Ewan McGregor (unsurprisingly) carries the film in a remarkable performance where you can now truly see why he was cast as the young Alec Guinness and Samuel L Jackson finally gets the chance to prove what everybody thought in Episode I, that Mace Windu is THE MAN with a lightsaber!
Yes, that scene on the hill side between Anakin and Padme smacks of laziness and is cringe inducing, yes, the dialogue at times feels in need of a re-write (this is Star Wars you know. Let's not critise a point that has existed since 1977) and yes, (imitate old age/old school Star Wars pensoner) 'It still doesn't feel like the originals!'. But this is a movie that's confidence, bravado and style are it's forerunners and here, Episode II truly triumphs. The Jango/Kenobi face off on the blustery Kamino platform is Star Wars at it's most slick, the asteroid chase is pure eye (and ear) candy, the Geonosis Arena Battle is vibrantly and unrelentingly overwhelming in it's adrenaline and the Yoda fight, well, it's Yoda FIGHTING!!!! Who in their right mind anticipated Yoda's duel would be so clever, so belittling, so......utterly exhausting!???
Episode II stylishly accomplishes what it set out to do, up the stakes for all involved, darken the subject matter as the inevitable 'tragedy' of The Chosen One draws ever nearer and unlock the secrets of the saga, even managing to throw out a few new questions. A fantastical ride of limitless invention that paves more than a shiny and sturdy path for the final Episode, one that will undoubtedly also fail to please the masses.",1046908800,3,3210,4.817028985507246

This is special effects on the rampage. The way I see it, in the early eithies, when all they had to go on was stop-motion effects, the filmmakers were restrained by the limits of this technology. George Lucas himself has been known to complain about the limitations of stop-motion. But the problem here seems to be the exact oposite. The benefits of Computer animation are so great that now everything is possible. In stop-motion for instance, the creatures were a little too stiff, but in computer animation, the're almost too fluidly. That awfull Jar-Jar creature from the first one doesn't just go in the water, he has to make a tripple salto mortale and dive!
It seems to me that in these days, filmmakers have to restrain themselves!

1316149,4,B00003CXKT,"To properly review AOTC, I think, the reviewer must give some perspective.  This movie has polarized fans of the series, and to give the reader some sort of context, I've got to let you know where I'm coming from.  I'm a longtime Star Wars fan.  I've been waiting for these movies ever since I saw Return of the Jedi on opening night back in 1983 at the age of 6.  So when I say I give Lucas the benefit of the doubt on alot of things, you might not have the same opinion.  That being said, lets move on to the review.
We all know the story: Obi-Wan Kenobi and all-grown-up Anakin Skywalker are assigned to protect now-Senator Amidala(Natalie Portman, not trying very hard, unfortunately) from an assasination plot that ties the whole movie together.  We all know what happens, and where it leads to, the big showdown at the Geonosis Arena and the start of the Clone Wars, the most talked about subject amongst Star Wars fans since they were mentioned in passing in the first movie 26 years ago.
The story itself is pretty well constucted, even if it does contain a few contrivences and plot holes to get to the final scenes.  The movie actually seems more like a second part of a three part miniseries: not advancing too much of the plot, but setting enough up for a powerhouse finale.  The pace is slowed only in the scenes with Anakin and Padme, who's love scenes are so bad that even I, an apologist for Episode I, was rolling in the aisles with laughter.  Hayden Christensen comes off as a stalker and Natalie Portman might as well be reciting a recipe for meatloaf, as bad as the dialogue and acting are.  What saves the movie from collapsing in on itself is the intercut story of Obi-wan Kenobi's journey to discover the secrets of teh plot against Amidala and the creation of a Clone army.  Here, Ewan McGregor shines in scenes that are actually well-written and mysterious, and he plays well against the perfectly cast Temura Morrison, playing Jango Fett.  So while all the romantic .... is going on, there's at least something interesting put in there to keep us awake.
Eventually, the real reason for the film arrives, the giant, 20-minute plus battle scene on Geonosis, and it does not dissapoint.  Clone troopers, Jedi, Battle Droids and Christopher Lee alll do battle in what has to be a great CGI accomplishment.  Watching the film on DVD, it looks really good.  It is easily the best cut part of the film, and the animation is seemless.  The CGI Yoda looks great here, too, better than he does in earlier scenes.
Anyway, the Yoda-Count Dooku battle is fun to watch, if over far too soon, and again, as the film ends, it just seems like the movie was one big set up for the pay-off in Episode III.  What can I say, I liked the movie.  I had a good time, and the DVD is second only to the Fellowship of the Rings SE in best DVD's on 2002.  It contains deleted scenes, many facianting documentaries on all aspects of the filmmaking process, especially one particularly well done doc on sounds in the film.  That's why I give teh disc 4 stars.  The movie itself is only a 3, but the two-disc DVD is well worth owning.  The movie may only be a bridge, but it's strong enough to keep me interested in the next one, which is I guess all it should have to do, anyway.",1046649600,3,3275,4.441471571906354

1316236,4,B00003CXKT,"After taking a serious blow with The Phantom Menace, the Star Wars series takes a step in the right direction with Attack of the Clones. But is the step big enough?
Attack of the Clones definitely feels much more like a Star Wars film then Menace, which felt like a big mess of nothing. The epic battles and events feel like they carry much more weight and have more to do with the events in the original trilogy, and the plot is much more defined. One of Menace's biggest flaws was the lack of a solid plot, and Clones solves it with an investigation into a murderous plot against Senator Amidala that uncovers much bigger and sinister goings-on. Events lead to a 45-minute climax that is definitely some of the most fun in the entire series. It may not have a space battle, but it doesn't need one, there's enough action and excitement as it is. Another plus is that C-3PO and RD-D2 have more screen time together and their antics go a long way in making the film feel like Star Wars in its second half.
Still, Attack of the Clones isn't up to the quality of the original films. Most notable is the extremely weak dialogue and characterizations. Dialogue may not have been Oscar caliber in the older films, but at least it was decent enough to get by. Attack of the Clones, though, it's often down right cringe-worthy. Especially in regards to the romance between Anakin and Amidala; bad romance novels have better dialogue. Though the lack of a rogue character like Han Solo still hurts the prequel trilogy, the clichd characterizations of much the cast do much more damage. Still, this isn't Star Wars' primary goal, which is to illustrate a big, fun space adventure. And Attack of the Clones definitely delivers on that.
Though I truly wish Lucas would place more emphasis on characterizations and plot then special effects, and would have stayed true to his original envisions of the prequel trilogy (which, according to some reports, would have been simply amazing), at least Attack of the Clones brings back some of that magic I grew up with. Some may still be greatly disappointed by the latest installment, but I found a lot to love in the flawed, but fun, film.",1046131200,2,2172,4.629533678756476
1316237,5,B00003CXKT,"I bought this DVD not long after it was released, and from the moment the theme started playing I was hooked.  Attack of the Clones is a stunningly good film with everything a sci-fi nut could ask for--drama, action, romance, a set of characters that you could actually believe in and care about, decent special effects, and a great story.
The actors in AOTC are among Hollywood's best.  It was great to see Natalie Portman returning as Padme Amidala, who is now the Senator representing Naboo, Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan, the Jedi mentor of young Anakin Skywalker (played this time by Hayden Christensen), Ian McDiarmid in his dual roles of Chancellor Palpatine and Darth Sidious, and Frank Oz voicing the ever-wise Yoda.  My favorite returning actor, though, has to be Samuel L. Jackson as Jedi Council member Mace Windu.  Not only was his part expanded in this movie, but he got to fight this time.
I would also like to give a special nod here to Christopher Lee as Count Dooku/Lord Tyranus.  He took this part to pay homage to the late Peter Cushing (Tarkin in the original SW), and I thought he handled it beautifully.  Lee's character is everything a Star Wars bad guy could ever aspire to be--malevolent, menacing, and all-out EVIL.  His Dracula flicks pale in comparison.
The thing I liked the most about the AOTC DVD is the fact that they put lots of extras on a second disc instead of just a few extras and the movie on one disc.  The extras disc in AOTC is like taking a course in moviemaking because it goes into everything--the creation of the CGI characters (the CGI Yoda, btw, was just awesome--he got to see some action this time, and he was much more articulated than the original puppet), sound effects, why certain scenes were cut, and other information that someone aspiring to a career behind the scenes would want to know about.  There's also several trailers and TV spots, storyboards, and a funny little ""mockumentary"" about everyone's favorite droid, R2D2.
All in all, Attack of the Clones is a great movie that should be nominated for an Oscar, not a Razzie award.  It is a great addition to the Star Wars saga, and the DVD is definitely a keeper.",1045958400,3,2171,4.659685863874346

The plot was good and it continues well with the storylines of the other movies.  I recommend this one to have in your DVD collection....oh yea....the special features are not that bad on this collection either.  Peace folks!!!!",1045785600,,515,4.775280898876405
1316240,1,B00003CXKT,"it's easy to fall into the trap of comparing this movie to others of the star wars movies, but it's just entirely unfair to do so unless with episode one, which shares rough schematic values (like the unbelievable quality of the special effects).  that said, after seeing episode one, i was not expecting much from this movie but despite my terribly low expectations, i was greatly dissappointed all the same.
the factor i never considered was the total loss of acting skill in this second episode.  admittedly, the little kid who played anakin in the first one wasn't so good, but i would have to say that Hayden Christenson is the absolute worst actor i have ever seen (i factor in, here, even preschool dramas about proper nutrition).  this is mind-boggling.  i understand george lucas' hubris to dare to test his awful writing skills on the scripts, it's every great man's downfall, but can't he at least hire some good help? the script should be noted at this point.  it is obvious that several of the less apt thespians stumble over these awkward, contrived, and excruciating-to-witness dialogues(most unfortunate is the poor performance of natalie portman, who has, in the past, showcased a talent, but here, miserably flops).  most commendable in this movie is the performance of ewan macgregor in the role of Obi Wan Kenobi.  his lines are terrible, but he plays the part with a noble grace. in the case of the young christenson, it would be easy to give him the benefit of the doubt, that if given the right script, he might shine a little, but i warn you strongly against this hope.  for with an actor who's single emotive facial expression is the pensive squint, you will only have your hopes shattered.
if you must watch this movie, take my advice: skip over every chapter listed with anakin and amidala.  take the movie in as an extended chronicle of the adventures of old ben kenobi, and relish in the final twenty minutes where the characters finally just shut the hell up and try to kill each other.",1045699200,9,2016,4.720797720797721

1316302,2,B00003CXKT,"The first three Star wars movies where fresh, innovative, and witty. That's what made them a hit. When you saw a creature it was really there, you felt it was solid and that considerable work went into creating it. When we saw a space ship fly we knew it was a special effect but it was beautiful to look at still. Now Mr. Lucas has relied too much on computer generated images that sometimes do not impress us because they look washed out, unrealistic, like they don't have a mass. The acting was terrible in this movie, and the cliches- the old friend at the dinner, the ""I hated when he does that"" line by Obi Wan-and the total disregard of self preservation like when Obi Wan jumps out the window from Amidala's suite to grab the  floating spy robot at a hundred or plus stories...or Anaking diving into traffic to catch the assassin... Just as if they knew they where in a fictional world where no harm could come to them. It doesn't work when the hero has no fears, no worries of geting hurt, because we can't relate to that, and if we can't relate, we don't care. The movie felt like browsing a book, page by page: no heart, no momentum, no surprises like when Han Solo sees Darth Vader in the dinning room at Lando's city. AOTC seems to have been written in a rush, without much regard for content, style or form since not much happens, the action scenes are few and far between, and the story doesn't build up to the final battle. I can imagine Mr. Lucas jumping up and down behind the editor :""ok, ok, so when do cut to the final battle, when do we, when do we?"" Wanting to show his main digital work: a choreography of combined digital animation, live characters, and matte images that do not save the movie.
""More is not always better"" we learn, because a movie is not as good as the number of digital images it presents. Mr. Spielberg should get a chance to direct the next Star Wars movie in order to save the franchise. The title of this movie is misleading since the clones are used to attack the bad guys, why not use
""Defense of the clones"". ""The Empire Strikes back"" was properly used since it means what says. Here you think the clones will take over and enslave all, but that's not what happens at all.
The scene of babies being harvested in huge fields in ""The Matrix"" was far more powerfull, well done and effective than the scene where Obi Wan is shown the cloning facilities in Attack of The Clones which looks like a digital artist simply copied and pasted the same baby, and Jango at age 20, over and over...Digital manipulation, to be effective needs character, creative license, to make each images interesting. For example
since the cloning facility is so huge, maybe there are areas where the air temperature and moisture differ from others and little dropplets appear to cling from the glass cointainers holding the babies, and the lighting could vary a bit with darker backgrounds and the like. The movie is nice to look at as long as you don't expect to be awed by what you see. A few good scenes are the fight between Obi Wan and Jango Fett, the chase in the skycrapers and the final battle. Kids will like it.",1045526400,5,3145,4.422413793103448
1316303,5,B00003CXKT,"""Star Wars--Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" was unfairly trashed by film critics and even by so-called ""Star Wars"" fans alike. Respectively and understandably, the new trilogy will never be as clever or as exciting as it's original, but that's only because people expect so much from these films now that they usually end up being disappointed because they weren't ""as perfect as fans had imagined them to be"". Director and creator of ""Star Wars"", George Lucas, has at least realized that he can't please all of his fans all of the time.
PLOT SUMMARY: ""Attack of the Clones"" takes place ten years later after ""The Phantom Menace"". Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen...who did very well in his role, dispite much critizism), is now a teenage and Master Obi-Wan Kanobi's (Ewan McGregor) Jedi apprentice. Summoned by the Jedi Order, Obi-Wan and Anakin must protect Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) from danger, as the Empire is failing. After Amidala is attacked, Obi-Wan goes off to hunt down Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison), who he believes is responsible for the attacks. This leaves Anakin to protect Amidala, and they must travel to her home planet for safety. While on Naboo, Anakin and Amidala struggle with their personal feelings for each other, as a Jedi cannot fall in love and Amidala wants to concentrate on her duties. But as the film progresses, their love grows stronger, and ultimately, they realize that they cannot hide their feelings for one another. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan hunts down Jango Fett, and they get involved in a lightsaber duel, but Obi-Wan also learns that it isn't Fett who is endangering the Senator and the Empire, but it is the mysterious Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), once a Jedi Knight who went over to the Dark Side and wants power from the Empire. The end of ""Attack of the Clones"" features a spectacular lightsaber duel between Count Dooku, Anakin, Obi-Wan, and even Yoda (Frank Oz), and the introduction to Episode III.
MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: I personally think ""Attack of the Clones"" is a fantastic addition to the ""Star Wars"" series. Lots of great action/lightsaber battle sequences, good acting (for a ""Star Wars"" film, anyway), and perfectly-casted actors. The sepcial effects are superb, and I can only imagine what the special effects will be like in Episode--III. The original score by John Williams is incredible, I especially like the ""Love Theme"". The dialouge is a little weak, but c'mon--wasn't ALL ""Star Wars"" dialouge like that? If you want to see a film with superb dialouge and Oscar worthy performances, then go see a film like ""The Hours"". But if you want to relive the magic of ""Star Wars"" and see the continuation of this exciting, thrilling sci-fic masterpiece, then go see ""Attack of the Clones"".
The DVD is a masterpiece of itself. There are two discs. The second disc features hours and hours of extra bonus footage, basically that saying, there's no way you could watch all of the bonus features in one day. At least two days is needed; perhaps more. The DVD bonus features include eight deleted scenes with introductions, commentary track by the filmmakers, a documentary on the creation of the digital characters, find out more about the animatics team, a documentary on the sound, three featurettes, 12-part web documentary, a music video featuring John Williams, production photos, one-sheet posters, trailers, exclusive DVD-ROM features, and much more. The DVD is available in wide screen and full frame formats.
I highly recommend ""Star Wars--Episode II: Attack of the Clones"".

The film's weakest moments are its concentration on romance. Most of us don't go to a Star Wars movie looking for romantic storylines.
I'd recommend Episode II to anyone who enjoys the Star Wars franchise but I'd warn them that it's not up to the quality of the original trilogy. That and I'd recommend keeping your finger on the fast forward.",1045267200,8,612,4.5225225225225225

Just as thorough as Episode I expect to see almost every nook and cranny of this movie from the costumes to set designs to web interviews. Special feature fanatics will be very, very happy. As far as the movie is concerned it was great to see some of the questions answered from episodes 4,5,& 6. Why Lucas has not received an Oscar for special effects yet (conspiracy?) I don't know but he is still the pioneer of special effects storytelling no matter what the critics say. I think my only gripe is with the Anakin/Padme relationship. I know they are not Han & Leia or anything but it just wasn't as deep as I thought it was going to be. Someone please let Lucas know that not all fanboys are allergic to the mushy stuff. There just some scenes where the couple looked way to stiff, like the cardboard cutouts they sell at Starlog. I hope in the next film they take their sweet time to let things play out more naturally. Through the Harry Potters and Lord of the Rings I think we can handle a little more plot now. Major points for the guy(s) who designed the Yoda battle. It just never gets old. Not much else to say.

1316306,1,B00003CXKT,"You know that repulsive feeling you get when you imagine licking the bottom of your shoes?  That's the feeling I got when seeing Attack of the Clones.  Revealing my age, I stood in line outside the theater for three hours to see the very first Star Wars movie.  This prequel does not deserve to be part of the legacy.
The best part of the movie was watching Yoda do some damage with his light saber.  The remainder of the very long film was not worth the time to view it.  The plot was thin.  The opening special effects were comical.
But, oh, there was lots of action.  There was the animals in the pit fighting - a masterpiece of animation, pointless but very well done.  There was the dodging the asteroids scene - Atari would have been proud.  And, there was the saber fight with Jango Fett, who let us see his human side - just another day on the job.  These scenes were loosely pasted together with what seemed to be a few sentences of dialog.
This movie serves only as a transparent vehicle to sell Gameboy Advance, Star Wars Episode II (GBA).  It is nothing more than a full-length commercial backed by greedy marketers to sell kids video games and action figures.  Skip the movie.  Play the game.  Your own imagination will take you to places well beyond this pointless film.",1045094400,8,1284,4.454935622317596

The dialog was to put it mildly atrocious. I've never seen such horrid acting since Manos the Hands of Fate. It doesn't have to be Shakespere but let's try to put some heart into what we're saying. This movie felt like a two-hour long video game. Is this what Sci/Fi has been relagated to? The DVD has excellent extras though.
If you are truly a Star Wars Fan, nothing George Lucas does with the franchise will disappoint you. It's just gotten too commercial for me to stand. I'd consider renting before buying it.",1045008000,3,741,4.338129496402877
1316308,3,B00003CXKT,"The film simply leaves you salivating for more.  The CGI was a bit overused in my opinion and you almost cant tell what is real and what is fake. To compare this film to that LOTR trash, is an exercise in futility.  The LOTR is one of the most revered epics of the 20th century. Sadly, no film in the Star Wars mythos can even compare.  As far as the plot goes, it is designed to be labyrinth for a point.  All of these elements are intertwined in order to make the entire saga come together. Alas, there are still gaps in the story.  If Episode I takes place thirty years before A New Hope, then how can there be twenty years between A new Hope and Episode III?
Lets get to comparisons for a moment.  As far as this sequel goes in comparison to Empire Strikes Back, ESB is the better film.  Let me tell you why.  In ESB, the heroes and the story are constantly on the go, it never slows down except for when Luke goes to train with Yoda.  In AOTC, Lucas mixes a lot of familiar elements (detective story, love story, political intrigue and war epic) but though succeed in blending together, the audience is left salivating because the plot does not flow as fast and as beautifully as ESB. The result: you have a convoluted mix of action, romance, and political intrigue that does set up for a sequel (Episode III) but does not succeed in standing on its own.
As far as Hayden Christensen goes, we have to remember that this guy is a rookie actor.  He cannot be expected to wow us the way Harrison Ford did. Ford just has this onscreen charisma and sex appeal that you cant help but admire. Nobody can do it like Ford did it, so we can stop expecting so much from future actors in this franchise.  Hayden portrays the character as he is meant to be, brooding, confused, in love.  His line delivery needs work, though.  When he delivers his lines, we see the emotion, but with his delivery, he fails in actually getting the audience to feel as the character feels.  The romance between Amidala and Anakin is very well built in my opinion but the edge, the charisma, and the emotion is not felt in us the way it was in ESB.
Another element is the music.  In ESB, John Williams made you feel what those characters were going through with his score.  Here we see that the themes are a rehash of previous themes while they elicit emotion, it is nowhere near the caliber of ESB.
This film is not a bad film but it is not a bad film either.  Another reason this film failed critically is because of its competition. With so many purists and fanatics out to see something as monumental as Spider-Man or Two Towers or Chicago or whatever, it is hard for a film like this to be successful.  Episode II should look at as a continuing setup for the cliffhanger that will be Episode III.",1044921600,,2774,4.312138728323699

Episode 2 was again a marvel for film special effects, but sometimes even those felt overplayed.  OK, I admit, the first time I saw it (as appalled as I was by the fake emotions and horrible directing from Lucas) the last 20 or so minutes kept me excited and wanting more, but Lucas just really has to pass the torch... which he isn't doing.  As much of a chance as Episode III has of being a great movie, I thought that Episode II had just as much a chance over 1.  Sure, it was better, but not by much.  Really people, look inside yourself and ask whether you can really say that you felt as good coming out of this movie as you did when you came out of A New Hope and beyond.  If you can, then happy disillusionment to you.  All in all, I for one am glad I can take solace in the fact that everything that went wrong in the Star Wars universe can be blamed solely on Jar-Jar Binks.",1044748800,5,1004,4.16580310880829
1316310,3,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars Episode II is worth owning for the special effects sequences, but after the first viewing one might want to skip the Anakin/Padme romance scenes.
Episode II has a teen Anakin Skywalker protecting Padme Amidala from various assassination attempts, with Obi-Wan sleuthing around for clues to the clone army.  They eventually undercover a plot by the mysterious Count Dooku to build a droid army that threatens the stability of the senate members.
I liked the mystery plot with Obi-Wan, which was interesting, although Ewan MacGregor is still stiff in the role.  There were a number of spectacular action sequences, including the opening chase scene through the Coruscant cityscape, the Obi-Wan/Jango Fett fight in the rain, the droid factory and the arena battle.  The scenes with Yoda vs. Count Dooku were worth the price of admission at the theatres.
What I didn't like was the romance between Anakin and Amidala.  We're supposed to believe that they're falling in love, but Hayden Christenson's Anakin is whiny, selfish and arrogant.  Guess that's why he became Darth Vader.  I can't see her falling in love with him, except that they save each other a couple times.  The deleted scenes show a lot more character development and developing connection between them.  Perhaps the action sequences could have been shortened to enhance the characters.

It's based on the old Saturday Matinee formula so of course some of the plot, action and dialogue is kind of unlikely (an example of this is when young Anakin jumps from his flier and free falls down to the escaping hitman's vehicle)but it is an improvement over some of what The Phantom Menace had.
I loved most of the sets and locations (not sure how much of that came out of a computer), the costumes were great (so much work involved in Natalie Portman's costumes)and some of the action (the Yoda Dooku battle was really impressive). I liked learning more about the characters but just can't help feeling that something more needed to be done with the development of the story. I especially thought that the Anakin/Padme wedding scene at the end needed something added to it.

1316381,4,B00003CXKT,"For those of you who hated or were disappointed with The Phantom Menace, there's a chance that you might like this one better, but maybe not. As for me, Attack of the Clones is a visual masterpiece. It also details events mentioned in A New Hope that fans may have always wondered about. The acting and dialogue is a little better than The Phantom Menace, it's a little more OTT and not as wooden, which helps, but at the same time is played almost dead straight. Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, gets either mixed reviews or ""thumbs down"", though, we're really not meant to like him. The ""plot"", some would say very little, moves along reasonable well, as does much of the action.

But hey, I'm a huge Star Wars fan.
I love Star Wars so dearly that is wouldn't matter if the movie .... I mean, if it did ... - and it doesn't, I wouldn't even be able to tell. All I see is greatness, and that is proof of the incredibly influential power of Star Wars. Even if critics tear this movie apart, everyone will still go see it. It's critic proof. And, as I have seen, it seems like the majority of people that bash Star Wars do so just for the sake of being different. These people must have trouble feeling the force.
Attack of the Clones takes place ten years after The Phantom Menace, during a time of increasing turmoil. The former Queen of Naboo, Padme Amidala, is now a senator whose life is constantly being threatened. In response, Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, have been assigned to protect her. Furthermore, the Jedi are searching with no avail for members of the Sith: Jedi whose power flows from the dark side of the force.
A few more characters that hold important roles are Mace Windu, Jango Fett, and Count Dooku. I have given the most vague outline of Attack of the Clones, and you should be thankful. It is wise (for your own pleasure) to know as little as possible about a movie like this prior to viewing it. However, let me say that the last 45 minutes of this movie are incredibly impressive. I found it literally breathtaking.
The only big problem with the movie is the screenplay. Some of the dialogue is uncomfortably dry. There are also a few scenes with Anakin that just don't feel right, but I'm sure it's because of the screenplay.
Even though Episode II is the worst Star Wars movie yet (and that's not saying anything bad), it's still great fun. It kept me interested enough that I can't wait to see the third and final chapter in the Star Wars series.",1043884800,2,2148,4.482142857142857

I saw Star Wars: Attack of the Clones several times to get an accurate review, but you don't have to put youreself through the same experience. It seems to me that Mr. Lucas was less concerned with good acting and entertaining characters than he was with covering them up with tons of epilepsy-inducing CG.
Perhapes it isn't all George's fault, Perhapes it is rather the fault of this generation of young people (which sadly I am a part of); who's short attention spans and demand for media-garbage would make it necessary to produce a film in this fashion.
Dispite the actors' best intentions, the dialog sounded mechanical, like it was being recited. The love story between Anakin and Padme felt forced and unnatural, no amount of CG could cover up that. There wasn't a single character to identify with. just scene after scene of dry dialog leading to the next task.
The Yoda fight scene in the end was where I gave up on the film. Admittidly, it was interesting to see Yoda with a Lightsabre, but how come a flipping, fighting, martial-arts-using Yoda has to walk with a cane? It felt like an appeal to the all-american moron (""woo-hoo! duh, Yoda rocks!"").
What's that you say? ""geez, this is a negative review."" Well, you're right, so here's somthing positive: Attack of the Clones would make a fine rental, but the Star Wars trilogy was probably better without it.

Bad Acting:  Much of the acting involving Anakin and Padme was very terrible and felt ""pushed""
Bad Plot: The plot was boring in parts, and even the interesting parts of the movie seemed very rushed and glossed over, like Lucus didn't put a lot of thought into the plot. (I'm sure he did, but it doesn't seem that way)
Bad CGI: Not all of it was bad, but a good majority of it is terrible.  When I watch a movie I want to be completely immersed in the movie and not be able to pick out stuff that was done with computers.  I think that the computer is a wonderful and useful tool for movie-makers, but when it's not done correctly (And this movie is a prime example of that!) the results are horrible to watch.  For two good examples of prime CGI, check out ""A Beautiful Mind"" (In the first scene, the leaves on the trees were put in with a computer, as well as several other good touches) or the Lord of the Rings trilogy (A few of the armies that were done CGI look extremely well, and the shot of the Fellowship running down the steps of Barad-dur and across the bridge is CGI)
Good Music: The music is excellent, but not good enough to support the movie entirely.  The acting and the plot have to meet halfway!
Good Costume Design: Many of the costumes made for Amidala were very gorgeous.  I love the intricate beadwork and embroidery.
Good Hair and Makeup: I like the job the makeup artists did with Ewan MacGregor, and some of the very romantic hairstyles that Natalie Portman had.
Good Set Design: Two of the sets really stand out in my mind: the set of the ""rainy"" planet (I can't remember the name of the place) and the set on Naboo at Amidala's mansion.
The pros in this flick definitely do not outweigh the cons.  A good plot with good acting can make you not worry about expensive costumes, sets and hairstyles.
All in all, if you want to see this movie that badly, I recommend renting it.  It's not good enough to buy.",1043712000,8,2148,4.360902255639098
1316465,3,B00003CXKT,"I looked forward to this DVD for a number of reasons:
First, I do enjoy the franchise. I remember the excitement of attending the first movie as a college sophomore. My son, who wanted the DVD is now only 2 years younger than I was at that point. Next, I figured that the special effects would be stunning because of the amount of money spent on this movie.
Also, I had hoped that, like the earlier prequel, The Phantom Menace, the movie would stand on its own, while providing background for Star Wars and the rest of the original trilogy.
So why didn't I like this more?
Lack of a unified plot:
The movie couldn't decide whether it was a love story, which is the way most of the early part of the movie looked, or a war story, as the middle of the movie looked, or a video game, which is where most of the end looked as Skywalker and Amidala deal with a manufacturing conveyor sequence that advances the concept of low-tech manufacturing to video-game status. On balance, the overriding message of the movie is to develop Skywalker's character, who will eventually join the dark side of the force as Darth Vader. It succeeds at this.
Too many incongruities within the movie and with the series:
Including the robots, C3P0 and R2D2, whose involvement in this episode is hard to reconcile with their initial lack of prior knowledge in Star Wars. Yoda's fighting sequence, which was totally out of character with the wise, dedicated Jedi he represented in Star Wars and the rest of this movie. Lastly, the conveyor sequence where an obviously low tech conveyor is used to build high volume, high-tech robots. It's too bad that the robotics folks that Lucas used to put the robots together for the movie didn't tell him about how robots are really made. However, there were plenty of good set-ups for the next prequel and the series, including Palatine's turn, the Count, the Deathstar, Skywalker's romance and conflict wth the dark side (he ultimately begets Luke Skywalker) and many, many more. So it was ok, just not the perfection I expected based on the bucks involved and Lucas' commitment to the series.
Special Effects sequences:
While mostly very good, there was a brief moment in one of the final sequences where Amidala was quite obviously played by a dummy.
While I was mentally noting some of the discontinuities, I was also entertained throughout. I did not feel the length, well over 2 hours, at all.
My son told me later that ""Yoda kicked butt"". Ok. If that's what he remembered, that's fine. I'm glad he was entertained. However, having enjoyed the original trilogy, I expected better.",1043539200,2,2600,4.703947368421052
1316466,5,B00003CXKT,"Let me clear this up: the acting is almost never good in a Star Wars film. Quit complaining. Second: the movie was awesome. You who say otherwise are wrong. Now that I have that out of the way, I can get on with my review. ""Star Wars: Attack of the Clones"" is the most visually incredible film of the series. Every scene has something for the viewer to gawk at. The action is amazing, the plot is thick with detail, the only problems the movie has are the weak acting and the forced love story. Everything else is awesome. I have a personal problem with those supposed ""Star Wars"" fans who say that this one wasn't good enough, or had awful acting, or blah blah blah. I can't believe that. ""AOTC"" is one of the greatest popcorn movies in a long time. True, it's not Lord of the Rings, but for cryin out loud quit your complaining and look at the movie for what it really is: a dark, action-filled cinematic gem with all the qualities of the original trilogy. I mean, Yoda finally gets to use his lightsabre, Mace Windu kicks Jango Fett's butt, Anakin gets his arm chopped off and all you can think about is the bad acting? So suddenly Star Wars has to contain academy-award winning Shakespearian acting in order to be good? What happened to you ""hard-core"" fans who used to enjoy the cool effects sequences, funny moments, and awesome lightsabre battles? Shame on all of you who diss this movie. May you all end up as extras in the next Ewok spinoff.",1043280000,7,1450,4.414179104477612
1316467,1,B00003CXKT,"Before I incur the wrath of the hordes of Star Wars deadheads who seem to reflexively rate any negative review of this woeful movie ""Unhelpful"", consider this: I am a lifelong fan of the original Star Wars Trilogy and had as much hopeful investment as anyone in the success of the second trilogy. The sad fact is that Attack of the Clones - despite what you've heard - is even worse than The Phantom Menace (if you can bring yourself to believe that something so ghastly could actually exist). Willing this to be a better movie than it actually is (which seems to have been the response of most US critics and - it has to be said - Star Wars fans) is a pointless exercise in delusion. The sad reality is that even the weakest of the original trilogy - Return of the Jedi - is infinitely superior to anything we've seen since. The amount of times I found myself asking ""Who wrote this [stuff]?"" is matched only by the amount of times I had to hold back laughing aloud at the infantile dialogue and plotting of this utterly charmless movie. This is quite possibly the worst writing EVER in a major Hollywood production and should fast find its natural place in screenwriting classes as a case study in how NOT to write a script. The completely unmoving, unconvincing romance between a wooden Hayden Christensen and an uncharacteristically bland Natalie Portman is only the most obvious clumsiness. The [weak] fortune cookie dialogue given to Ewan McGregor finds appropriate expression in a disinterested performance (how else can any self-respecting actor work with wannabe banter that amounts to exchanges of ""Yes Master""; ""No Master""; ""I try Master"" ad infinitum?) Such puerile gems as ""The day we take democracy for granted is the day we lose it"" simply cry out for ridicule. The deterministic, completely unconvincing and unsympathetic movement of the Anakin character towards the ""Dark Side"" - a process underpinned by a cynical array of contrived situations and the worst depiction of teenage angst ever put to screen - only further raises the rubbish factor. Anakin scowls around saying things like: ""You're like a father to me master""; ""He doesn't understand me""; ""It's all his fault!""; ""He's holding me back!"" It's like the last teen movie George Lucas has seen was in 1955 (doubly strange for someone who was the director of the superior, textured teen movie, American Graffiti) - come back John Hughes, all is forgiven. It also has to be said that - in a series never characterised by great acting anyway - Hayden Christensen gives the worst-ever performance in a Star Wars movie. Possibly the most untalented actor of his generation by this evidence - his charisma-free range appears to be pouting and... pouting. When Christensen says ""I have a bad feeling about this!"" - a line most familiar to series fans courtesy of Luke and Han at various points in the original Star Wars - he only prompts reminders of the rugged charisma and naive charm of the actors - and characters - that preceded him. The comparison is fatal! As for the much vaunted digital effects - well! If the miserable CGI creations menacing our heroes in the stadium execution scene are a standard, then give me Ray Harryhausen anyday. Hopefully these will look better on the Playstation 2 - where they probably best belong. In this regard, Star Wars has aways been a commercial exercise but the ... plugging of possible videogame content is distracting (most obviously when Anakin applies platform-game timing and strategy in avoiding a series of blades and hazards). So it appears, unfortunately, that the best thing techno-merchandiser George Lucas can do for the final instalment of this truly pitiful second trilogy is hand over the directorial reigns (as he did with The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) to a journeyman director (where are you Irving Kershner?) unpressured by the burden of pop culture expectation. The man is clearly no longer capable of telling a decent, well-paced story. Lucas recently said he welcomed the competition provided by Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings series. Don't kid yourself George! There's no competition. Peter Jackson is an infinitely better director - and Attack of the Clones against Lord of the Rings is like a shopping trolley against a Ferrari. And these - fellow Star Wars fans - are the sad truths we should stop denying!",1043280000,115,4365,4.868279569892473
1316468,4,B00003CXKT,"I would definitely recommend that any Star Wars fan buy this DVD, (like they need to be told). Let's be honest all we really want with this movie is a way to relive what we all really love in the original Star Wars trilogy. It is evident to me that after seeing this movie that, despite being worlds better than Episode I, Lucas CAN NOT direct or motivate actors to save his life. Empire and Jedi were pulled off so beautifully because others directed them. If you look to the first of the series (A New Hope of which most of you simply call Star Wars) the same directing flops are present and bad acting reigns supreme. Maybe in years to come when these movies are remade we will have a director step up who can actually direct, but until then we'll have to deal with this blundering yet beloved fool called Lucas.",1043193600,2,815,4.333333333333333
1316469,3,B00003CXKT,"When I watched ""Attack of the Clones"" on DVD, I had to admit that I liked it better the second time around.  Maybe my expectations had been lowered.  Or maybe the things that annoyed me in the first showing didn't get to me.  Or maybe the esoteric nature of the politics was easier to decipher.  In any case, this film is not great, just inoffensive entertainment for the evening.  If only Lucas would rediscover the magic of a compelling plot! The opening chase scene is fantastic, if a little long, and other special effect sequences are spectacular.  (Many, though, seem like commercials for a video game.)  Unfortunately, Hayden Christenson delivers his lines with a stilted quality that seems like he was trying to take the wooden lines and make them Shakespearian.  Natalie Portman is marginally better, while Samuel Jackson and Ewan McGregor out-act everyone but Yoda in his fight scene.  That said, I still felt a thrill when Anakin's rage gave rise to the Darth Vader theme song.
The REAL reason to get this DVD is for the short ""R2D2: Beneath the Dome.""  What a hoot!  The deadpan delivery of Lucas, Spielberg, Richard Dreyfuss, Francis Ford Coppola, and Carrie Fisher demonstrates better acting than found in the entire Clone feature. Also worth watching is the montage of special effects set to music, reminding one of just how astounding the technology is.  In this feature, the stages of production are layered one over the other, demonstrating in a few seconds each how the final special effect was reached.
The deleted scene feature is less interesting, though it has some intriguing tidbits.  Most of the scenes deserved to be deleted, but because Lucas and his film editor explain WHY they were taken out, it lends a small insight into the filmmaking process.  I was astounded that an effort had originally been made to develop the characters of Padme and Anakin, in scenes that show both as more human than they come across in the movie.
A lot of people really liked the movie, and so they should not hesitate to buy the DVD.  People like me who came out of the theater saying, ""Eh . . ."" might like it better the second time around, as strange as that seems.  But if you truly hated the movie, spend your money elsewhere.  The special features alone aren't worth getting this.",1043107200,51,2296,4.7430730478589425
1316470,5,B00003CXKT,"Ok, I'm tired of people taking weak shots at Lucas.  Everyone goes into the theaters with the highest expectations that absolutely no one can match, not even Lucas.  You can't expect the prequels to surpass the origianl trilogy, that's utterly impossible.  So my advice is to have an open mind about the prequels and be receptive to new ideas... aka STOP LIVING IN THE PAST.  i think the acting was very good... Hayden Christensen played a very good Anakin - people say his dialogue was broken and poor.. i disagree.  He plays his role right - confused, angered, and head over heals in love all at the same time.  His mind is a whirlwind and it shows through Christensen's acting.  Natalie Portman did very well also, not letting feelings for Anakin get in the way until the very end when her heart overcomes her brain, and it shows.  McGregor did excellent as well, portraying a more mature and well balanced Obi-Wan than in Episode I.  Christopher Lee did excellent as well, one can almost see regret in his eyes for all he has done.  The critical, unspoken attributes of all the actors come through if you watch the movie with a critical eye.  So instead of seeing it once and rejecting it, watch it again and the unspoken acting shines through.  The film filled in critical gaps in the storyline, and did it well.  I almost view Lucas as a modern Shakespeare, in which Shakespeare was famous for his ability to tie together every lose end at the conclusion of his works.  The computer graphics were astounding, flat out.  Many don't agree, but I view it this way.  This film was during a time where there were huge armies and giant wars, unlike during the original trilogy where the Rebellion was striving to survive on any older ship they could find to fight the Empire.  Lastly, if any of the above hasn't convinced you, listen to the soundtrack.  John Williams uses his musical magic yet again and no can argue that, flat out.  Mr. Lucas, you're right on track, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  Can't wait for Episode III!",1043107200,2,2034,4.597222222222222
1316529,1,B00003CXKT,"The eyes candy was spectacular, Yoda having full freedom of movement to kick some serious booty was way cool(!!), all in all though it is the worst movie I have seen in years. The acting was pathetic (a scene or two being an exception) to the point of making Kevin Costner wooden acting look like Jack Nicholson, the script, for having some interesting ideas, was completely amateur in its construction, they couldn't even get makeup on Natalie Portman consistently correct. This movie did not appear to have a director<period> Great technology, bad movie-making, poor acting, nonexistent directing, Christopher Lee and Yoda were the only characters with any presence or animation, reminiscent of a high school play in a school without a drama teacher. No wonder it did so -relatively- poorly in the box office. If you haven't seen it, don't waste the photons.

We learn about the history of the Clone Wars, the Skywalkers, Obi Won, Yoda, the Emperor.  No Darth Vader yet, but we know he'll show up in Star Wars 3.  We meet she who will become the mother of Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker, and encounter the two droids.

1316533,2,B00003CXKT,"There's a top gun in filmmaking now, and DEFINITELY is NOT George Lucas anymore. It took only 2 movies (I prefer to not mention Episode I) to tear down a great modern mythology as Star Wars. Episode II is the secuel of what happens when you let your creativity let loose and let the special effects rule rather than what made the original Star Wars great: the STORY.
I have been a fan since the first release of the trilogy in 1977, and honestly I am not interested in watching such displays of Lucas' self indulgence by repeating himself in such pittyful ways with those ""cameos"" and ""homages"" to the classic trilogy.
For me, Star Wars was about BREAKING GROUND in every way: new planets, new situations, new shots, new music, new perils... but with the prequel trilogies, it comes about to hear stupid plotlines taken by the original ones (""You must join me, Obi-Wan...and together we will destroy the Sith""...where have I heard that before and with a better impact?), a never duplicated asteroid chase sequence in The Empire Strikes Back by having this trilogy have its own asteroid chase but with poor results.
Unfortunately, the ultimate winner wanted to replace one of the most classic love scenes in movie history with POOR results... that false ""I truly...deeply love you"" will never compare to that bittersweet ""I love you... I know"" by a single shot.
And the DVD follows the same line, poor documentaries, bloopers without fun and the deleted scenes section depict where everything goes: making money instead of delivering the goods by telling a good story instead of attracting fans by watching what was lost... sometimes the deleted scenes were better than those in the film.
Unfortunately, there's still a lot of story to tell and only 2 hours to do it... let's hope that Lucas uses that chance to its fullest, but in the meantime I am still thankful that he had the vision of filming the classic trilogy first because that vision is not there anymore.",1042761600,2,1965,4.765395894428153
1316534,4,B00003CXKT,"As lame as Phantom Menace was, I gave it the benefit of the doubt nonetheless and called it a plot beginning set up to the pivotal events that would later take place in this trilogy of Star Wars prequels.  Episode II: Attack of the Clones suceeds far beyond The Phantom Menace in terms of pacing, action, story, and acting (well, somewhat anyway).  Ewan McGregor seems to gain more and more of an Alec Guiness-esque persona in his role as the younger Obi-Wan, while Samuel L. Jackson's role of Mace Windu is given more depth than he had in his short screen time in Phantom Menace.  The biggest letdown of the film however, is the chemistry of Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, but that is no fault of the actors themselves, it is the fault of the grey bearded stocky man sitting in the director's chair.  Now I mean no disrespect to George Lucas; the man has quite an imaginitive story to tell, but his directing skills are atrocious.  Had Attack of the Clones been handled by a more competent director, this film would be an excellent sci-fi/adventure and a worthy film to carry the Star Wars banner.  Don't believe me?  Watch Empire Strikes Back or even Return of the Jedi, both of which were directed by Irvin Kirshner and Richard Marquand respectively were great films and were much better than the first installment that was directed by Lucas.  I beg Mr. Lucas to find another director for Episode III, judging by what we all know will most likely happen in that film, it should be directed by someone other than good 'ol George.  All in all, those older Star Wars fans who called Phantom Menace blasphemy should give Attack of the Clones a look (if they haven't allready), and they will find a much better film here.",1042675200,2,1728,4.602605863192182
1316535,4,B00003CXKT,"OK, the dialogue is a bit wooden, but the casting is actually very good and there are a lot of great little touches that you only notice on the second viewing.  The love story works very well, the arcane politics begins to make sense, and the new villains are fine.  The new worlds are beautifully imagined and convincingly rendered (Coruscant at night rocks!).
The main problems that I have are the aforementioned dialogue, a little bit of choppiness in moving the story forward, and too much CGI in the final battle sequence.
What I haven't seen mentioned is what a glorious setup this movie is for Episode III.  Anakin's fall is going to be much more tragic, and the plight of the Jedi much more tragic, than I'd earlier expected.  Because of the way the politics have been set up, Anakin will turn to the dark side out of LOYALTY -- the Jedi, sworn to 1) defend the Republic and 2) fight the Dark Side, will all face an impossible choice when the Republic itself goes bad.  Anakin won't have to make a dramatic choice to betray anybody -- he will continue to support Chancellor Palpatine in policies that, while they may seem risky and inadvisable, have been lawfully enacted by the Senate.  The OTHER Jedi will face the wrenching choice of recognizing that their two duties have become incompatible, and Anakin will have justification for regarding their ultimate decision as a betrayal.  All the ingredients for this are in place, and it was foreshadowed in the ""waterfall picnic"" scene.  If Lucas picks a good scriptwriter this time, the actors who play Anakin, Obi-Wan, Mace, and Amidala are up to the task and Episode III has the potential to be the best of the whole series.",1042675200,2,1684,4.66554054054054
1316536,2,B00003CXKT,"I saw the first Star Wars film in the summer of 1977 - before George Lucas knew he had a hit on his hands and started retroactively numbering the sequels - so I started in on the ground floor with Episode 4: A New Hope. I recommended the film to a relative and we saw it together. Then I saw it with a friend, then with another, and so on, until I had seen the (still-unsubtitled) film ten times. I eagerly awaited the next (fifth) episode (The Empire Strikes Back, 1980), and impatiently anticipated the ""third"" (sixth) episode (The Return of the Jedi, 1983). Afterward known as the Star Wars Trilogy, I was thrilled with the action and adventure, although the quasi-religious ""Force"" they talked about seemed irrelevant to all that, if not downright ridiculous.
Then something happened. Maybe it was a sequel too far. Maybe I got older, maybe the characters weren't as interesting, or maybe the films just got more and more ridiculous. By 1999, when Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace came along, I had had enough of that George Lucas world a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. In this latest installment of his tired series, Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, I was disappointed to find no image, no line of dialog, that didn't disappear from my memory as soon as it dissolved from the screen.
Oh, yes, Episode II is a technical marvel: here, the sets are totally computer-generated; the aliens are truly inventive and all computer-generated; the visual effects are seamless and brilliantly computer-generated. I even liked seeing tiny Yoda dancing with his light saber in battle with the evil Count Drac-, er, Count Dooku (played with CGI face by Christopher Lee!). But I felt double-crossed by the dialog and cheated by the characters. Ewan McGregor as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi - played memorably in Episodes 4-6 by the late Sir Alec Guinness - was at least entertaining to watch. But the love dance between the maturing Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and the Princess Padm Amidala (Natalie Portman, who actually has talent) was entirely bland and unconvincing. Get a clue, kids: love means passion.
The Star Wars franchise George Lucas created inhabits a godless-yet-spiritual universe, with an uneasy alliance between technology and a pop-theology. Among people made uncomfortable by human progress and the dizzying advance of technology, perhaps this is more comfortable - also more masculine, that is, more appealing to male teenagers and less intellectually demanding - than the more explicitly god-free universe of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek, however cool it is to see Jedi priests swing their light sabers. Personally, I prefer Trek to Wars, principally because I see more potential for improving the human condition with technology than with theology - even the generic, anti-intellectual, anti-technology, anti-progress variety called The Force.
That is my objection to Star Wars in general. As to Attack of the Clones in particular, I see Lucas's deep investment in Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) that might as well be cartoons for all they help the film. I am not opposed to CGI per se. But I do think it should work to elucidate, not invalidate, the story and the characters. The subtitle contains less poetry than truth.",1042675200,4,3271,4.9817184643510055
1316537,5,B00003CXKT,"This movie is far better in every way than Episode I. Episode I was more of a foundation setter, than an fan getter. Episode II has more action, better scenes, amazing saber fights, and countless special effects.
The extra ""scenes"" and Extra Features it has truly expands the value of this package beyond any other. There are hours of ""extras"" to watch between watching the feature film.
If you think this is just a Guy flick, with battle scenes, blood guts, alien villains etc... you're wrong. There is a ton here for the Women to be glued to the set. Some may venture to say this is the most love oriented Star Wars Ever.

1316538,1,B00003CXKT,"Sadly, I have to admit that I am a child of the late 70s. I was a huge fan of the original series and remember well the wonder and amazement that the first three movies held over me. I even tolerated the Ewoks despite knowing that they were written in for their cuteness and marketability.
Attack of the Clones reinforces what a pile of steaming dung this series has become. I am certain that ""Attack"" makes many reviewers list of the worst movies ever.
In some movies (ET, Close Encounters, etc) you are willing to suspend your sense of reality for entertainment sake, but this movie can't even approach that goal. Most of the acting is terrible because of poor dialog. The plot and story line are painfully unbelievable and full of holes, the visual effects mostly ineffective and the sound effects recycled.  Supposedly ""Attack"" occurs 10 years after Episode I, but McGregor, Portman and the majority of the crew haven't aged a day. You have to wonder what (if anything) the screen writers were thinking: The romantic subplot has no credibility,  in one scene Yoda can hardly walk, but seconds later he is doing back flips, and what's with Jimmy Smits? He gets about 30 seconds of screen time. Did all of his time end up on the digital cutting floor?
Published reviews indicated that this was one of the best DVD sets yet released. I found nothing redeeming in it.  Other DVDs with deleted scenes usually indicate that they were deleted for time or continuity. The ""Attack"" deleted scenes were deleted because they were even worse than the rest. In one scene it looks like McGregor is about to start laughing due to the pitiful dialog.
If I didn't know that there was going to be one more movie to complete this series I would say, ""Let this series die!""  Too bad Amazon.com does not allow 0 stars. Somewhere, I think, Portman and John Williams are crying. Either that, or laughing all the way to the bank.

The movie is based around a love that, in my opinion, isn't even believable. The only character that I felt had any depth to him was Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by Ewan McGregor. I bow down to Ewan and his superb acting skills. The other members of the cast, however, lack his talents.
While Hayden Christensen is a cute face and quite adorable to watch, he simply cannot act, in this movie, at least. Natalie Portman falls short as well.
But, hey -- if lightsaber fights and bad acting make a good movie for you, by all means, watch. If watching Ewan McGregor wield a lightsaber and get soaked in the rain makes a good movie for you (And believe me, it does!), then watch, as well. Personally, I only purchased the movie because of Ewan.

1316608,2,B00003CXKT,"Okay, I was thrilled about the whole thing at first, but that sentiment has faded considerably now. These new films were a BAD idea.
I must admit Episode II actually IS an improvement over the last film. But only marginally. And although the director seems to have taken note of a lot of the critism the last installment recieved, he also seems to be overcompensating at times.
For instance, where the last film tended to be overall pretty dull with only a bare margin of action scenes, this film is litteraly packed with them. Overly packed, in fact.
Aditionally, the acting is outright appaling. Of course, Star Wars never was about great acting, but Episode II takes it just a bit to far. Right up to the point where the wooden preformance by otherwise good actors such as MacGregor, Jackson and Portman became just plain annoying.
This is probably not the actor's fault though. The dreadfull dialogue suggests that Mr Lucas didn't really give any of these people much to work with.
Finally, the special effects were nice, but not great. They would have been perfect for an animated series or film (which episode II very nearly is, actually), but not for anything else.
In fact, they are more like ""look at those cool effects""-kind of effects, rather then ""oh no! the battledroid army is approaching""-kind of effects. They look nice, but just don't work for the story.
Nevertheless, allthough the action scenes are overly abundant, they are in themselves pretty good. They made the film fun to watch at least once, especially because the ""romance"" between two of the main characters didn't work at all.
Whcih brings us to the overall story, which was in fact potentially pretty good, but executed poorly.
So, this isn't really a good film. Which wouldn't have been so bad if it also were fun to watch.
Unfortunatly, it is fun only once or twice. Don't spend you money buying it, because the film it simply isn't worth the money. Just go watch it in the theater once or twice and move on.",1042502400,5,1990,4.70487106017192

Attack of the Clones is one of those movies. It's a truly brilliant film, and possibly even (dare I say it?) the best Star Wars movie yet. No, I'm not crazy. I can explain everything.
First, there's the acting/script. A LOT of people bitched and moaned about how Anakin's pick-up lines sucked and were delivered without flair. Well, did you ever consider the possibility that maybe he was SUPPOSED to act like that? I mean, the guy is going to be spending the next SEVERAL days ALONE with the girl of his dreams, and he has NO idea how he's supposed to handle things. I mean, the guy probably never even watches TV! Do you expect him to start acting all suave and quoting Shakespeare? Heck no! He sounds like the worst pick-up artist in the galaxy, because HE'S SUPPOSED TO, and this part of the movie was done so convincingly that people actually thought that his acting sucked. If you'll notice, whenever he's NOT trying to get into Amidala's pants, his acting and lines are really damn good (""Life seems so much simpler when you're fixing things...""). As for Amidala, well, she's a Senator being hit on by a Jedi about half her age. So of course she has to give the appearance of being as uninterested in him as possible... once she learns how he feels, of course. Before that, when she doesn't suspect him of anything, she is genuinely affectionate toward him (""You really have grown"").
The lack of chemistry between Anakin and Amidala - What are you talking about? They had great chemistry! Remember that part where he floats the fruit off his plate and she takes a bite while it's in mid-air? That's so cute! Sure, there are some parts where they don't have chemistry because they don't want to. Well, DUH! She's a Senator, and he's a Jedi. That's kind of frowned upon by the public, and they know that they can't get too close, so they try not to. They TALKED ABOUT THAT! I mean, how obvious can it be? Again, during the parts where they do not perceive this to be a problem, they have really great chemistry together. I especially like the comments about ""aggressive negotiations.""
And, of course, there's the CGI. I won't deny that George seems to have a habit of blatantly abusing CGI, but sometimes it REALLY pays off. I mean, look at Yoda. He doesn't look like some cartoon (a la Episode 1), he looks as Jim Henson's puppet came to life! And on that one really rainy planet, the CGI is so good that I can't tell what's CGI and what's not. Yeah, sometimes the CGI is painfully obvious, but it's still better than the Muppet rejects from the original trilogy.
Names. Okay, Count Dooku sounds pretty stupid, and ""Attack of the Clones"" just screams b-movie. But I think that's part of what makes the movie fun. When other people grimace every time they hear ""Dooku,"" I just grin and giggle. Okay, I'm easily amused. So sue me.
Now that I've shot down all the ""reasons"" why this movie is ""bad,"" let me explain why it is so good. First, it is the most emotionally intense of the Star Wars movies. Look at Luke Skywalker's reaction to coming home in Episode 4 to find his relatives burt to a crisp. He looks around to make sure they're dead, stares into the sunset, then calmly tells Obi-Wan that he wants to be a Jedi and kick some Imperial butt. Now, compare that to Anakin's reaction upon finding his mother. He actually WATCHES HER DIE, IN HIS ARMS! As his blinding grief turns into blinding rage, he pulls out his lightsaber and starts decapitating Jawas left and right. He doesn't even bother using the door; he's in such a rush that he makes his own. Then, he has to bring home his mom in a body bag. He doesn't say a word to anyone when he arrives, there's just an understanding silence. And there's the sunset funeral, which is just plain beautiful. Do you see the huge difference here? How about the difference between this movie's love story and that of the original trilogy? I mean, Leiah seemed to hate pretty much everyone in the first movie, then she suddenly fell in love with both Han Solo (total selfish SOB) and Luke Skywalker (her brother) at the same time for no apparent reason. Oh, and let's not forget that some actual depth was added to Boba Fett's character this time around.
Second, Clones has the most deep, thoughtful, and intriguing plot of any of the Star Wars movies. It's not just ""There's good guys and there's bad guys, the good guys blow up the bad guy's big metal ball of death, the end"" like the first Star Wars. There's a very mysterious aura about the plot, which involves a secret Clone Army that had been created for a war that would not happen for another ten years. We know that Jango Fett and some other people are involved, that it is related to an assassination attempt on Amidala, and that it may be related to Palpatine's manipulation of events to increase his own power in the Republic. The pieces fall together at a steady pace, and at the end of it all, you learn enough to make sense of most of it without leaving too little for Episode 3 to mop up.
Third, you get to see Yoda in a lightsaber duel. This is probably not too special on a TV screen, but when you're in the theater watching this movie on opening day, and you see an approaching shadow that can only belong to Yoda, suddenly EVERYONE in the theater starts laughing and clapping and cheering, and the funniest moment in Star Wars history plays before your eyes. That was a moment that I will never forget, because it will only ever happen once in my lifetime, and not everyone got to experience it the same way I did.
So all told, I think the five stars that I gave this movie are very justly deserved.",1042502400,5,6073,4.486901535682024

The acting is stiff and downright BAD.  Anakin and Amidala have no chemistry.
The storyline is convoluted and hard to follow.
The special effects are pretty but many of them are unnecessary.  I liked the cantina creatures in the original movie just fine... why did they have to computer-generate so many of the new creatures?  It's annoying.

1316612,3,B00003CXKT,"I think the largest problem with AOTC is that George favored action/CGI sequences over plot and character development. For example, the deleted scenes show lots of Padme and her family & childhood, which George cut as trivial ""backstory"" and instead included such plot-forwarding sequences as the Cloner riding a pteradactyl out of the water. The ""stuffiness"" of the script didn't bother me as much as it seems to bother other viewers; I consider it ""the language of high drama"". I just wish he had SHOWN more about the character conflicts and growth instead of TELLING us about it. (""I have grown, you said it yourself..."" and ""You are in my very soul..."").

Only the scenes with Anakin and the Sand People and the final Jedi battle come close to capturing the spirit of the original 3 films.  The rest of it is garbage.
Apparently George Lucas thought that he could distract us all from the fact that he made an extended video game cut scene instead of a movie by filming the entire thing in front of a blue screen and filling the movie with CGI.  Maybe he thought that we'd have to like it, just because it carried the Star Wars brand label.  Maybe he just didn't care because he knew he'd be raking in about $1 billion.  In any case, he continues to ruin the original three movies with these train wrecks.  Well, he was right, and we're all gonna hate ourselves when we can't stop ourselves from seeing his final installation, titled ""Star Wars: Episode III: Just Give Me Your Money"".",1042416000,5,955,4.485549132947977
1316614,3,B00003CXKT,"Yes, it is a visually stunning film and you see where some aspects are going to tie up nicely. However this simply is not the Star Wars that most of us writing these reviews grew up with. Part of the charm of the first trilogy was the chemistry between the three main characters, and the simplicity of the Star Wars universe. Now it's a special effects extravaganza trying to compete with films of the same genre that it helped create.
One thing that I was very impressed with was the score. John Williams clearly outdoes himself by blending the original theme scores of this movie, Episode I and the original trilogy. One cannot help but get goosebumps when you hear the Imperial March in the film.
The reason for the stale acting is quite clear in the featurettes on the second disk. It's already been established that McGregor, Portman, and yes even Christensen (see ""My Life as a House if only for his performance)are fine actors. But when Lucas and McCallum start bragging that there is nothing but blue screen and Obi-Wan is the only real character on the set, you can't blame the performance. While it does make for great eye-candy and the digital to digital tranfer is unparalleled, it lacks tangibility. Due to the technical constraint of the film there was no maneuverability for the actors. And if Lucas diddn't like it, as the states on more than one occasion he just erased it.
Peter Jackson and his team were on the right track by using digital as well as other techniques in LOTR. I think Lucas could stand to learn from gthe filmmakers that he influenced.
Also, if the writer of ""Batman and Robin"" can write the oscar winning ""A Beautiful Mind"". There is no excuse why George can't brush up his dialouge.
All of this said though, I and I assume a great many of us will be standing in line for hours come the summer of 2005.",1042416000,,1839,4.542168674698795
1316615,1,B00003CXKT,"Let me start of by stating:  I LIKED ""The Phantom Menace"" very much when it hit theaters in 1999.  Having been a life-long ""classic"" Star Wars fan, it did take a couple viewings to adjust to the very different look and feel of Episode One.  But ultimately I felt the pros out-weighed the cons and I was stoked for the rest of the series.
I hated Episode Two.  Upon viewing it, I realized that Mr. Lucas has no story to tell.  The prequels have turned out to be unnecessary pieces of non-sensical tripe.  Attack of the Clones is SO bad, in fact, that forced me to re-evaluate my feelings for Phantom Menace.  That's not to say that I now hate Ep. 1, but I can't watch it with any enthusiasm having seen the disaster that followed it.
Many have pointed out the weak script, the lifeless acting, the over-reliance on CG effects.  All true.  There is a bunch of very superficial razz-a-matazz in Attack of the Clones, and I believe it has tricked many people into thinking they've been entertained.  But given the foregone conclusion of this Prequel Trilogy, all I can ask is: ""Who cares?""  Who cares about Boba Fett's dad??  Who cares about Yoda's little Jedi-in-training?  Who gives a rat's you-know-what about Count Dooku?  None of this stuff adds anything to the saga.  It's a bunch of unimaginative ideas stitched into a VERY poorly told story.
The ""Clone wars""?  I would've rather kept imagining the legendary Clone Wars, mentioned to Luke by Obi-wan in Episode IV.  I would've rather kept imagining the formative years of Anakin Skywalker, and his descent into the Dark Side.  Why?  Because my IMAGINATION is better than what Mr. Lucas has offered us with these new movies.
Mr. Lucas, you are nothing more than a hack.  I wish you had never returned to the Star Wars universe.",1042329600,7,1779,4.623003194888179
1316616,2,B00003CXKT,"Blech.  This movie just gets worse everytime I see it.  I'll admit that I'm judging it from the perspective of an adult, whereas my opinions of the original were formed as a child.  I'll be interested to see how my own children think  the prequels stack up to the original movies when they are old enough to appreciate them.  That being said, I think that Attack of the Clones is at best a mediocre movie with a handful of interesting scenes, and at worst just a bad one that I would have completely disregarded had it not had the name Star Wars attached to it.  I think the biggest weakness is Lucas' obsession with his special effects (wonder if he ever hears the irony in the line ""Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed"" from Episode IV).  First of all, they don't carry a film- they're nothing more than eye candy and should only be used to further the overall story.  Lucas seems to take the opposite approach- he hangs a slim, poorly written plot on the insubstantial fraamework of his special effects.  He envisions an effect and then writes a story to go along with it.  That might work for a video game, but not for a major movie.  Second, the effects just aren't that good to begin with.  To me, they look shimmery, lacking in depth, and quite often very cartoonish.  The technology isn't as advanced as Lucas likes to believe, and the effects don't measure up when all the attention is put on them.  Look at a movie like Spiderman-  subpar effects at times, but an interesting story and likable characters hold your interest and help you suspend your disbelief with the effects.  Lucas' effects would be more than adequate if he had an interesting movie in which to display them.  Give it up, George- we know you have the technology, but most of us just don't really care about it enough to build a whole movie around it.  You can't tell the Star Wars stories without spfx, but you also can't have spfx without a story

That leads to the movie itself.  Much has been said about the poor acting, and I don't disagree.  However, I place the blame on the director/writer rather than the performers.  I've seen most of them in other movies and they are all good actors, and some even have the potential for greatness.  But they have nothing with which to work here:  wooden dialogue, flimsy story, uninteresting characterizations.  Much has also been said that the original trilogy's stars weren't that great of performers either.  That may be true, but they had chemistry, and they played interesting characters with corny but memorable dialogue.  They had energy and emotions.  Darth Vader, Chewbacca, Yoda, Han Solo, Luke, Leia, even Lando and the ewoks- all a huge part of American popular culture.  My 4 year old daughter knows many of them without ever having seen the movie.  She can tell you how Darth Vader breathes funny and how Chewie looks like a monkey and how R2 talks in beeps.  Will Count Dooku and Jar Jar and Amidala and the Genoisians be the same for future generations?  I don't think so...

Don't even get me started on the inconsistencies between these movies and the original trilogy.  Yeah, maybe they'll be addressed in Ep. Three.  Right.  Whatever.  Sure.  We'll see.

This movie just has very little substance.  It might offer some visual marvels which hold up over time, and it might be a lesser part in a stronger whole.  But overall Lucas has sadly lost what he once had.  I'll hold out for episode three, but my confidence in it is greatly reduced.  And frankly, I just don't care that much anymore (Well, obviously I do or I wouldn't have spent the time to write a review.  Hell, I loved these movies as a kid and even today at age 35.  What a disappointment! I can't believe how bad this movie turned out to be.  What a letdown, George.  To paraphrase Bruce Springsteen, an artist who HASN'T let me down over the years, you had it once but you ain't got it anymore.)",1042329600,2,3935,4.563662374821173

Duku was not all that exciting either. To tell you the truth I think The Phantom Menace was a better film. Darth Maul was awesome! Duku lacked the dred that Maul brought to the scren. No one can replace Darth Vader but, If Darth Maul had more screen time he would have been a close runner up. I will see the third film just to get some closure but, I don't have very hi hopes.

The real problem  are the computer generated special effects that end up looking to cartoonish as compared to the realistic special effects that the original star wars trilogy had. Thats probably the reason why the acting in these prequals suffer since these actors don't converse with percieved aliens but, to a green screen that is used to create the computer generated life forms. Thats also why there aren't any memorable creatures in these prequals unlike what the old star wars trilogy had such as Chubaka & Jaba the Hut. That aside, I thought the story was decent and the action sequences were done well however, as I said, the reliance on the computer generated effects takes away from the integrity of the star wars series. The original trilogies had man made sculpted models of the space ships & other futuristic facilities and elaborate costumes to simulate aliens which made the whole setting seem realistic. Unfortuantly, the computer generated models in these two prequals lack a good enough texture and detail to equal or surpass the the special effects standard set  by the Original Trilogies whos special effects had amazing realism.
I think Lucas should go back to his old formula of putting human craftsmanship into creating realistic scenery & characters and  infusing some computer effects along with that.",1042070400,4,1560,5.015444015444015
1316689,5,B00003CXKT,"PICTURE
This DVD exibits an outstanding picture quality, there is no noise, pixelation or imperfection, the picture colors are the most natural colours i ever seen on an DVD. There is no compresion artifacs whatsoever on this DVD (wich is visible on some scenes in The Phantom Menace DVD), and is very hard to say if the digital video transfer process has involved some Edge Enhancement (also visible in The Phantom Menace DVD).
This DVD is really a reference in how is supposed to be movies presented on DVD ! You can calibrate an check an Home Theater system with it, for every subsystem, video or audio.

SOUND
The 5.1 Dolby Digital EX (matrixed 6.1) sound is awsome, rich and enveloping, the surround channels is often used, creating deep involving in the action on the screen. As in The Phantom Menace, the overall sound volume in Attack of the Clones is a little low (by 4-5 dB), but that is to allow the LFE channel to thrive in full packed action scenes.

CONTENT
The movie is great, though i was a little disappointed after the first view (not the same as The Phantom Menace, who has blown me away after first view in theater). In comparasion to The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones does not have a musical score strong enough, there is a lot of incidental music and some parts of The Phantom Menace score. The Phantom Menace score was great made, as great as the musical score of the old trilogy. Still, Attack of the Clones is beautiful made, the music is flowing alongside picture, the story is good and if you think that the dialogue is stiff please check the DVD audio commentary made by George Lucas and his fellows from Lucasfilm and Industrial Light + Magic, that will put you on the right track, your bad opinion will be changed from that moment !

DVD RELATED CONTENT
The DVD system of menus is as good as in The Phantom Menace DVD, in some places are even greater, there are some scenes specialy made for the menu, that are never seen on the movie, the outtakes ar still in the same place, at the THX Optimizer, 1138 key code. The second disc has the same layout as the second disc of The Phantom Menace of course, the documentaries and featurets are good, maybe not as good as those of The Phantom Menace, the deleted scenes ar somewhat a little raw, not as finished as those from The Phantom Menace but that will do. There is only one hidden easter egg, not as many as in The Phantom Menace second disc DVD.

1316691,3,B00003CXKT,"Lucas has a penchant for poor dialogue in his script writing.  Top that off with his sappy and simplistic ideas of love and friendship and you get a pretty good idea that you shouldn't blame the fine actors in his movies for the problems at hand.
George has turned his startling technical abilities to rendering eye candy without substance...  all dessert and no meal.  If a newbie saw the Episodes in order, I doubt they'd get to 4 or 5.  If only he would write a story and let someone else write the script!  And let the actors EMOTE the lines instead of reading them with the stiffness of a dead Gungan (the only good Gungan).
Being a fan of the series, I have to give it a 3 for Yoda's triumphant (although a touch frenzied) battle, the fantastic CGI, and the Jedi resque.  Take out the weak 'midichlorians', gungans, overexplained plot points (give us some Credit George!), and add in some actual CONFLICT and it wouldn't be that bad.  Even a hero to cheer on would be nice.  Yet another Profit making movie that could have done so much more.

As for the romance of Anakin and Padme, dismissed by critics who were for some reason expecting an affair along the acting lines of ""English Patient"" it is actually quite fun, if a little goofy and awkward (most young romances are, people). The last 45 minutes is nothing short of the greatest sustained action in a movie ever, and finally gives SW fans a glimpse of the Clone Wars mentioned in the original trilogy. If you can get past the pretensions tied to the original films and the critics that made every effort to ruin the success of the film (of course the critics failed, it made over $310 million in the US alone ), you will really enjoy this movie.",1041984000,,959,4.485714285714286
1316749,3,B00003CXKT,"Um, okay, Mr. Lucas took something like a decade off filmmaking.  And in the past two Star Wars films, he proves it.  Why?  Well, we have two very good, strong stories.  These stories didn't make the film, however, instead what you have is a live action cartoon.  The movies feel like children's films in many places.  Obviously, the new movies are aimed at children...so, why are there monsters ripping Natalie Portman's clothes off?  I could say similar about Return of The Jedi...
Even in the original trilogy, Lucas only directed one film, and had co-writers for the scripts.  In this trilogy, Lucas is directing and writing the films.  The goal of the filmmakers is to take the films, and make them as fast paced as possible, cutting out anything unnecessary.  Lucas is also overobsessed with the idea of comic relief.  In this movie, he takes it to extremes (a tense chase sequence is ruined when an alien car driver shouts ""poodoo"", the alien word for dung).  The cartoon characters Jar Jar Binks and Dexter Jettster are quite sickening to look at if you are over age 10 or do not watch Nickelodeon all day.
However, all this said, I liked the film.  The acting was bad.  I remember one scene where it looks like Amidala is reading a cue card, staring off of the screen.  It felt like it was shot in one take.  The writing was clumsy, not the story, but the way it was told.  What you wind up with is a movie that is ruined if you take it seriously.  On the other hand, the movie is saved by...the writing.  This is the movie that finally reveals a lot of the story.  It makes a lot clear, and connects TPM to the originals.  The battles are intense and great to watch, and it's a nice adventure all the way through.
I don't know if Lucas reads this.  From what I could tell, all the reviews were 3 stars, all complaining about the same things.  We don't want cardboard jedis.  When the Jedi are hunted down in Ep 3, we don't want to wish for their death. Hmm, maybe Peter Jackson should direct...",1041984000,,2004,4.427397260273972

And like most young boys of that time, I wanted to be Luke Skywalker and I wanted to marry Princess Leia. Watch Return of the Jedi (arguably the weakest installment in the series) and you will see why that isn't such a good thing.
With Attack of the Clones, George Lucas has created the magic that he did with his original trilogy and combined it with the visual flair that nearly overpowered The Phantom Menace. And thankfully, the ""cute quotient"" is quite low this go around. Less Jar Jar and no Ewoks to be seen.
Attack of the Clones mimics The Empire Strikes Back (the best and darkest Star Wars film yet) in both tone and story structure. Our heroes are separated and sent out to have their own adventures and then brought back together again near the end of the film for a truly rousing and visually breathtaking climax. We even get a lightsabre battle in which our ""hero"" - Anakin Skywalker - loses his hand.
Sure, it can be said that George Lucas relies too much on technical wizardry to tell his stories now. I'm of two minds on this issue: 1) The overuse of CGI can create a stale environment where storytelling takes a back seat; 2) The modern technology can help to create creatures and alien vistas that actually look alien. I have to believe that there is a happy medium, and Attack of the Clones is inching ever closer to it. While Attack of the Clones is, for the most part, a rousing success; I do believe that Episode III should lean even more towards my second point. Episode III should be the best Star Wars film!

The situation comes to a head when an assassination of Senator Amidala (Natalie Portman), formerly Queen of Naboo and now a representative of her home planet in the Republic capital is attempted and comes very close to succeeding. Jedi knights are assigned to her as bodyguards, a situation that reunites her with her old friend Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and the previously mentioned Anakin, who has grown quite a bit since he last saw her, and now even seems to insist that he is in love with our fair heroine. Many more questions that were raised in the original Star Wars trilogy are answered here than were provided by Episode One, but most importantly the action sequences have been upped quite a bit this time, and performed extremely well, instead of the endless dialogue that left the first installment feeling far too serious for its own good. Christensen does a fair enough job with the role, but whatever shortcomings he appears to have as an actor seem unfair to point out in the face of his having probably the worst dialogue in all of grand science-fiction film history to utter; his love scenes with Portman are of mawkishly tepid design. He's much better in moments where he hints at the eventual change that his character will undergo to become one of filmdom's favourite villains of all time. McGregor, on the other hand, does a superb job in the now-lead role of Obi-Wan Kenobi. The character has blossomed to center stage in this installment, and McGregor meets every aspect of the challenge with incredible panache. It's almost a shame that Christensen is getting all the publicity for a movie that basically belongs to his co-star. The visual effects in this film series seem to get bolder and more beautiful with every attempt; one might even assume that director/creator George Lucas was miffed enough at having lost all the technical Academy Awards for The Phantom Menace to The Matrix in 1999 that this time he insisted on this film's having way more impressive effects work than ever before. Either way, the film looks fantastic, sounds great, has some stony moments, runs a bit too long, but on the whole is great entertainment worth watching again and again.",1041811200,,2738,4.877682403433476

Jackson gets to say ""The party's over."" JarJar's barely in the thing. And, to top it all off and save the movie, Yoda FIGHTS!
The hints of Anakin becoming Darth Vader are compelling. And the action in the last 45 minutes of this save the film almost entirely.

1316757,5,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones is a rich, multi-layered sci-fi film from George Lucas, director of American Graffiti and Star Wars. After a rough start with the first installment of his new trilogy, The Phantom Menace, Lucas gets back to business with a film that puts story first over technology.
The acting is clearly influenced by early films of the 20th century, especially the 1930's, 40's, and 50's. For this series, he chooses his characters to be played as charicatures of archetypes of mythological stories than the method acting applied in films since the late 60's.
Contrary to popular belief, most of the sets are actual miniatures and NOT CGI. The computer generated imagery is clearly evident on most creatures that interact with the film's stars Ewan McGregor, Hayden Christensen, and Natalie Portman.
As for the dialogue, if the film is being criticized because of dialogue, then it is not the only film that should be. Other films and entire genres such as anime, foreign films, action films and silent films should also be viewed harshly. Although it is great to have snappy dialogue between characters, it is not the be all, end all of a movie. It is a visual medium, something many film viewers in this world have forgotten.
For a film with excellent dialogue, I would suggest The Breakfast Club. For a film with breathtaking landscape, a darkening atmosphere, classically influenced score, and a mythological approach, view Attack of the Clones.
Open minded people will realize there is more than one way to tell a story, and it is not just thru dialogue.",1041811200,2,1566,4.913207547169812

now that episode 2 is out on DVD and i have the clarity and objectivity that the passage of 2002 has afforded - i can safely say that this movie is as dreadful, in almost every way, as the first. to break it down into categories such as acting, writing, special fx is pointless. the sum total of all these parts is just a shocking mess of pointless dialog, half baked attempts at politics (an elected queen?), and silly names for bad guys. ('count duku' sounds like something i left in the john)
another thing that i'll admit is that lord of the rings came out and showed the world (and me) what a fantasy/sci-fi movie could be. after seeing the two towers, i just felt sorry for george lucas. i imagined him in the theater next to me shaking his head and thinking what 6-11 year old would want to play with a gollum action figure? missing the point has become george's film legacy.
the final insult to this DVD is the 'making of' documentary - which i couldn't finish. the idea that anyone would care about the myriad details that go into an inflated, badly written, badly acted movie is just shear arrogance. then again, arrogance and gall is exactly what george lucas had in abundance back in the mid 70's. He even managed to combine it with a modicum of skill. now we're just left with the attitude. and for star wars fans, that just hurts.",1041724800,27,1552,4.373702422145329

1316857,3,B00003CXKT,"The whole problem with this movie can be attributed to an Annakin who is too weak and in no way realistic as the future Darth Vader. The young Annakin of Epsidoe 1 was annoying, but at least precocious. This Annakin is just a loser who inexplicably has a lot of powers, like he accidentally ate some magic Bubble Gum or something. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. The future Darth Vader needs to be much more intelligent, much more formidable, much more dangerous. It would have been interesting to see a blond Hugh Jackman in this role. I thought he had about the right amount of fire when he played Wolverine in the X-men movie. Intensity, darkness, brooding is good - but whining? Not so good. Yes the dialog is atrocious, but a good actor can find ways of putting enough ""under the covers"" that the quality of the dialog becomes irrelevant. The right actor can take the word ""potato"" and make it sound threatening, dark, mirthful or tragic based on what he does with the iceberg underneath. Of course, in defense of the actor, we don't know if it was really his fault or the director's.
I didn't mind the rest of it so much. I thought Natalie Portman made a reasonable choice - she was just very reserved, which would have worked fine if Annakin hadn't been such a weanie. Again, think of having a really strong Male Presence playing opposite her. In that case, having the ""ex-queen"" (how can queens be elected?) be reserved and Annakin attracting her with his vitality, vibrance, vigor and ... viagra-like manliness would have made sense. But when you put one wet noodle next to another wet noodle, all you have is limp spaghetti, laying there on the plate. This movie had way too much spaghetti.
I was also irritated more than amused by the stupid head-swapping jokes, but they didn't bother me that much because I understand they are meant to appeal to the kiddies. To fully appreciate Star Wars, you have to be willing to adopt a certain frame of mind. I was very happy to see less of Jar Jar Binks, but not as happy as I would have been if he had been blow up into many pieces. Ewan McGregor was OK, if a bit dull. And that is the biggest problem with this movie in a nut shell - you can't have An Epic that features dull, lifeless characters! It doesn't work! These people are the center of great changes in the entire universe, and they don't seem to have any sense of it or be affected by it!! They might as well all be made out of wood. Harrison Ford's swashbuckling and charisma in the original series is sorely missed.
I think the kiddies will like this movie a lot, especially the Yoda fight scene. I imagine most adults will be disappointed but many will still find ways of enjoying it. If nothing else, this is an ""unusual"" film - they don't make many films that are similar in their scale and grandeur.

But I do expect a man of George Lucas's talent to at least TRY!  This is a pathetic attempt just to cash in on the original trilogy without putting effort into the storyline.  The story doesn't hold the viewer's interest, the love story is full of horribly trite dialogue.  The battle scenes hold absolutely no interest; they are Rambo-like with the Jedi seeming so invincible that there is no reason to believe in their peril.  The characters are bland and the acting not much better.  Hollywood seems to beleive that special effects make up for a poor story so they can put any old piece of ... on the screen and get people in the theatres by spending a lot of money on effects.

1316861,4,B00003CXKT,"If you, like many, were dissapointed by Episode I, Episode II vindicates George Lucas... partly. The screenplay become a central element of the movie, as opposed to Episode I, where the story was weak, to the point of becoming empty. However, Lucas continues to be (in my book at least) a great director, but not such a great writer. After having watched the movie three times now, I find places in the story that could be vastly improved upon.
As for acting, in spite of the fact that tons of scenes are shot against blue screens totally pack the movie, performances are very well accomplished: in particular Samuel L. Jackson's (anyone surprised by this?). Also you will be delighted by some moments in the movie where C-3PO and R2-D2 bring back the best memories from Episode IV (the first Star Wars, just in case). This time around also the backgrounds are far more impressing (in Coruscant, for instance). Yoda's ""moment"" in the movie (won't disclose more, in case anyone reading this hasn't seen the movie) is definitely a moment for movie history: it got everyone off their seats in the theaters and will surely do the same with everyone's couches when you play this DVD at home.
On the downside, Hayden Christensen's performance pales when compared to almost everyone else's (although you will find lots of praise for him in the featurettes in DVD 2 of this edition). Also, some battle scenes were not rendered to the high level of quality that Lucas got us used to in Episode I, therefore looking like Video Games in the end. Finally, as for the second DVD in this set, I don't find much justification for it: as opposed to Episode I's, where there was a lot of novelty to the technical portion of the movie, this time around, there is a lot of repetition. Yes, there are some novel tech elements in the movie, such as the 100-percent-digital Yoda, which is a great accomplishment, but it does not justify hours of featurettes and documentaries, which seem to be there just to stuff the set and mark it up.
Like some other reviewer said, this is trully the Star Wars sequel that everyone had waited for, but I sure hope for an even better Episode III, with improved acting, to compensate for an otherwise too-digital movie, if you know what I mean. Plus I wouldn't mind if they only released a single DVD, as long as they end up finally releasing the first three movies in the same format.",1041379200,2,2398,4.631455399061033

Nope. This is just as bad if not worse.
Hayden Christensen is completely implausible as the young Darth Vader. The supporting cast isn't much better. Even Obi-wan played by Ewan McGregor had my eyes rolling at times. The special effects are on overload once again, making it seem more like a video game than a film. The story is just completely uninteresting and pointless, there is no character development at all, the love scenes seemed disjointed from the rest of the movie and just thrown in for the sake of it. There is just no story or point to the new trilogy. It's more like a collection of mini dramas that happened before the original Star Wars. Even worse, George Lucas is being self indulgent, he's just showing off what he can do with his special effect to get a pile of money.",1041292800,7,1034,4.564516129032258

  The story is somewhat uneven, often jumping from one event to another, with very little talk and much action. And when the characters speak, it's normally restrained-very little emotion involved. Anakin Skywalker (played by Hayden Christensen) shows the most appealing truth in his character and gives a performance that is more true to life. Padme (or Amidala) played by Natalie Portman really hides the greatness of Portman's abilities as an actress. Seeing her in other films, she is much more animated, even in serious roles. But, also, her performance in this second installment has also improved from wooden into movable. Yoda is highly commendable in his performance, and one is somewhat realived to see him in a scene as at least Yoda tells it like it is. Every other supporting actor and actress also helped improve this second installment- that including Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan McGregor (reprising their roles). The plot was even more feasable and understandable, and at least made some sense to why Anakin Skywalker may have swayed to the Dark Side.
  If not truly a great film on it's own, Episode II does a halfway job of supporting it's sequel episodes and ridding of some hard feelings over The Phantom Menace.",1041292800,,1498,4.8858267716535435
1316962,3,B00003CXKT,"To let the truth be known, I watched this movie with a mix of anticipation and fear. Being an avid Star Wars fan, I was excited to see any Star Wars movie, but I suspected this would be as disappointing as the Phantom Menace. WRONG! Although this doesn't even come close to the great casting and story lines and sheer art of the first three Star Wars series, it was WAY better than Phantom Menace for the following reasons: 1) This movie included LESS Jar-Jar, which, despite initial heavy marketing for the first movie, the character was found by the general consensus to be REALLY annoying. 2) This movie demonstrated some of the political turmoil behind the original Star Wars movies. 3) You get to see some of what led Anakin to turn over to the Dark Side. Finally, the special effects were really good!
It was not 4 or 5 stars because the actors that were cast in this movie (as well as The Phantom Menace) are all well known for other cinematic accomplishments, and it was hard to believe that they were supposed to be these other characters.  They should have casted lesser-known actors, in my opinion.  Also, the plot about the clones was weak, to me.
But, note well- the fight-scene with Yoda by itself makes the movie worth watching. It was action packed, entertaining, and even a little bit funny.  I do recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan, way way better than the Phantom Menace, but do not go into it expecting it to be as good as the first Star Wars series.",1041206400,,1477,4.483271375464684

So...while George Lucas should NEVER be allowed near a screen play EVER again...I found this movie entertaining.
I must also let you know that I am a sucker for cheesy jokes.  It comes from my mothers side of the family...I am hopeless for something corny...but not stupid.  Don't get me started on Dumb and Dumber.
So while the vast majority of people seeing this movie left it utterly dissapointed: I now own it.  And watch it on a regular basis.
Perhaps it is the fact that I am a writer that leads to my examining of character development beyond what the poor screenwriting gave us.  The development of Anakin Skywalker left me astounded.  Hayden Christensen took a poorly written part and turned it into something belivable...transforming his character's attitude in a matter of moments as he went through what I fondly call, a male mood swing.  Ewan McGregor was again excellent as Obi Wan Kenobi, a character whom I am very fond of...and created both humor...sarcasm, and complete control that IS Obi Wan.

It's not the acting at all, which reunites most of the old cast and introduces some new faces such as Christopher Lee as the evil Count Dooku (he did much better as Saruman) and Hayden Christiansen as Anakin, who did a fairly good job.  No, it was the rotten screenplay.  It made it look like Anakin wasn't geting seduced by the dark side of the Force, it made it look like he was just a hormone-driven teenager who couldn't control any of his feelings.

Episode II is chock-full of dazzling action sequences, and special effects, the likes of which have never been seen in a motion picture.  I was stunned earlier to see someone intimate that The Matrix had better CGI than this film.  The Matrix was set in the stone age compared to this film visually.  Does the film have flaws?  Certainly.  The romance would have played out much better had it been set against a backdrop of action, a chase, perhaps.  Still in all, with its mountain of intrigue, terrific action, and astounding effects, this is a fascinating film (tell me you can actually turn your brain on during the conversation between Dooku and Obi-Wan and then stop thinking about its implications, no way, you can't).
My point about the other reviewers is this:  one person gave the movie a 1-star review.  That same person gave a 5-starrating to Plan Nine from Outer Space, arguably one of the worst films ever made.  The same person gave The Mummy Returns a 5-star rating.  Explain that to me.  Yet another person tried to stack the film's overall rating by submitting 4 1-star reviews.  This is not the mark of a bad film; it's the mark of a psychotic who's inexplicably nursing a grudge.  Yet another reviewer who gave the film 1-star gave Cutthroat Island, deservedly one of the biggest flops in history, a good review.  The same reviewer slammed Live Nude Girls for not really having Nude Girls in it AND gave the Monkees' ludicrous celluloid acid-trip 5 stars.
Many of the others who have slammed the film are Star Wars fans who, somewhere down the line, jumped into Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino's beds, and when the prequels went into production, these people expected the new films to be like Kevin Smith or Tarantino films.  Um, no.  That's not Star Wars, nor has it ever been.
My point is that no film is for everyone, but when it comes to this film, consider the source of the bad reviews.  Episode II is one hell of a ride.",1041120000,2,2028,4.635854341736695
1316966,2,B00003CXKT,"A few years back, in a documentary about the making of the original Star Wars trilogy, George Lucas gave his take on the proper place of technology and effects in movies. ""A special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing,"" he said, as I recall.
Indeed, the original ""Star Wars"" films succeeded not just because they were special effects bonanzas - they were good, human stories as well. There was a heart behind all that technology.
Unfortunately, the heart stopped beating for ""Episode II - Attack of the Clones,"" a film that is at once visually sensational and emotionally numb. Its action sequences recapture much of the visual energy and fun of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, but what's missing here is the emotional punch of those classic movies.
""Attack of the Clones"" is built around the forbidden romance of Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala, and the romance is a clinker, a non-starter that is so banal that you shake your head and wonder what in the world attracts these two to each other. There's absolutely no spark between the two characters or the actors who play them (Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman), the sequences in which they fall in love play like geeky ripoffs of ""Romeo and Juliet,"" and worst of all, the whole affair is punctuated by horrid pieces of dialogue like this one from Anakin:  ""I don't like sand. It's rough and coarse. You're soft and smooth.""
And then there's the problem of Padme, who is drawn as something of an idealist and a humanist, marrying with a guy who isn't all that opposed to autocracy, and who turns out to be a mass murderer to boot. Is there such a thing as Dr. Laura in the ""Star Wars"" universe? Is Padme that stupid? She isn't drawn that way, and because of the lack of spark in the romance between her and Anakin, I didn't buy that she's all that enamored with him, either.
Of course, that's part of the risk of making romance the anchor of an effects-driven epic film like ""Attack of the Clones."" and it's the same risk taken in ""Titanic"" and ""Pearl Harbor."" If the romance works, as it did in ""Titanic,"" then the story becomes far more human and involving, and the action scenes are just sauce for the goose; if it fails, as it did in ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Attack of the Clones,"" then the characters and storyline feel like filler, a way to pass the time until the next action sequence starts.
And that's the rub: the visuals and action sequences are so brilliantly conceived and executed that the failures in the storyline, script and acting are that much more obvious. No ""Star Wars"" film, even the first one, featured great dialogue, but at least the interplay between characters was fun and energetic. Here, we get people who sound as if they're at a business meeting
There are scenes in which ""Attack of the Clones"" tries to rise above itself, chief among them being the sequence in which Anakin's mother is killed by sandpeople, and he takes his revenge by slaughtering their whole village - an effective foreshadowing of the man Anakin will eventually become.
There's also an implied philosophical idea about the nature of evil men: they're usually driven by fear and anger, as Yoda suggested in ""Episode I."" In Anakin's case, there's also a strong desire to do right, even if he's misguided - and we see Palpatine (the future Emperor) playing on that idealism.
And, of course, there's the scene in which Yoda finally gets his Jedi groove on against Count Dooku (Christopher Lee, who's obviously having a ball). When I first saw this film, I had no idea this was coming, and for me, it ranks right up there with any of the great moments from the original trilogy.
These items are laudable - you can see Lucas trying to make ""Attack of the Clones"" more than a mere piece of kiddie-oriented fluff - but they're far too little, and too late.
I'm reminded again of Lucas' platitudes about special effects being nothing without a good story. The visual splendor of ""Attack of the Clones"" is such that it's far from nothing, but imagine how good this film would have been with even a decent script to complement its visual excellence.
Hint to Lucas: the best ""Star Wars"" movie was ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" and Lawrence Kasdan wrote it. Hire him - hell, hire anyone - to write the next ""Star Wars"" movie.",1041120000,25,4282,4.64163372859025

1316968,4,B00003CXKT,"I'm sure a lot of the material I'm stating here is a recap of other reviews, but I'm writing my opinion instead of trying to repeat known facts.  As stated in the title, this film is better than the first, almost worth the wait.  The reduction of Jar-Jar footage, increase in action, and inclusion of Yoda's skill with the Force/light-saber were welcome additions to the film.  These and a few other features almost made this a Star Wars film.  ""Phantom Menace"" was Star Wars for eight-year-olds; more of a computer animation than a live-action movie.  The only character that made the movie was Darth Maul, and he was killed off.
""Attack of the Clones"" picks up the pace, detailing more of the serious aspects of the Jedi's battle with the opposers of the Senate, as well as the evolving of the Empire.  Anakin was once more a disappointment in the film; now he's a whiny little product of a boy-band who does nothing to prove his mastery of the Force as the so-called ""chosen one"".  It is hard to see a connection between this little brat and the menacing Darth Vader that effortlessly struck fear into the hearts of men.  Senator Amidala was a welcome sight in this film, and her outfits weren't nearly as radical or Japanese-based as those of the last film, but more original and elegant.  The love scenes between her and Anakin weren't at all convincing, as it would seem rather difficult for her to fall in love with a little wimp like him.
The rest of the film wasn't bad; the Jedi fight scenes were fun to watch, the chase at the beginning was decent and the colisseum battles were more reminiscient of ""Return of the Jedi"".  However, the film still lacked the feel of the original trilogy, as it seemed more like an excuse for cameos from stars such as Jimmy Smits and Sam Jackson.  The stars in the first trilogy were no-names at the time, and played the parts beautifully.  There's no Han Solo-type in the film, nor any Wookies (and thankfully, no Ewoks).  Not saying that these were necessary, but they added more to the feel of the first trilogy.  It will be nice, however, when in the next film all these half-hearted characters are killed off or banished to set up for the first trilogy.  The question is, can we wait three more years for another disappointment to fall short to another ""Matrix"" movie?",1041033600,,2317,4.576271186440678

The epic Clone Battle was definately cool , as were the light saber duals between Sidious, Anakin, ObiWan, and of course Yoda. A lot of the movie just seems like filler though. The most accomplished actor in this whole picture is ObiWan, he must get credit for trying to carry this movie with his acting, espescially when he is in an empty room talking to creatures and characters who will be added in later.
If you couldn't stand Anakin in Episode I, prepare yourself for II. He goes from an annoying little kid to an annoying big kid. A pretty boy who tries to express his inner turmoil, while falling in love (as a Jedi is a no no) through his acting just falls flat. He looks like he'd be more comfortable making a video with the BackStreet Boys.
The special effects of course are great, not surprisingly since that is LucasArt's specialty. But I think this whole movie has too much drama with wooden performances and drama that is laughable. The chemistry between Leia and Han is nowhere to be seen in any character in this whole movie.
Best scenes are ObiWan and Jango's fight, much too short though; the execution arena, the final fight, and of course Yoda. Jengo dying as easily as he did really ticked me off, but what can you do? George has no love for the bounty hunters in this series of movies.
C3PO and R2D2 round out the movie with their own brand of comic relief and it is a breath of fresh air from the somber, dreadful, and forbidden love story.
Well all we can do is wait for Part III and complain some more.",1040774400,2,1765,4.384146341463414
1317049,2,B00003CXKT,"Sigh.  After 26 years, countless words, and 5 movies, it's time for us to admit the awful truth we've been afraid to see.
George should have stopped with the first movie.  The only reason to own any of the others is to find out more about the original story.  But Lucas is like Homer:  The Iliad is unimportant without the Odyssey.
Hey, I was his most avid supporter, once.  I saw the original 5 times in the first 2 weeks it was out.  I took a very special woman to Episode 5, and my wife-to-be to Episode 6.  I was as hooked as anyone past the age of 21 could be (that means I never owned any action figures).
Alas, I was somewhat puzzled by the lack of pizzazz in Return of the Jedi.  Carrie Fisher in a bikini is just not enough for me (sorry Carrie).  Episode One sat there lifeless, and Episode 2 was just a sorry muddle.  None of them come close to the original.  I shudder to think what will happen if George lives long enough to start work on Episodes 7, 8, and 9.
Lucas' technical brilliance and daring are legendary.  I think he's as important as Spielberg to the modern movie genre;  more important if you count Lucasfilm, ILM, Skywalker Sound, etc.

The DVD master was downsampled from original elements.  It shows - the quality of the picture and sound is nothing less than astounding.  If you have a home theater system and need a disc to show off what it can do, I can think of no better one than this.
But the film itself?  Sigh.
George Lucas seems to have fallen into the same rut as his compatriot Francis Ford Coppola - only much further.  Where once was visionary talent, there is now only special effects that, dazzling though they are, cannot mask the truly insipid drivel that passes for a story.  It is not credible as science fiction, fantasy, or myth.  It's tired, illogical, pointless, dull, pretentious, poorly conceived, and badly acted (though Christoper Lee and Frank Oz are pretty good as Count Dookie - er, Dooku, and the voice of Fozzy - er, Yoda, respectively).
It is nearly impossible to imagine that the man who made THX-1138, American Grafitti, and the original Star Wars (before it was subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope) could possibly have made this film. My ten year-old nephew could have written better dialogue.  Really.

The movie, itself, has some awesome action-sequences, especially Kenobi's fight with Jango Fett, the arena battle and the climatic confrontation between Yoda and Count Dooku (It was simply incredible to watch) However, I believe the film is  weighed down by some bad acting.

The only glimps of hope was Ewan McGregor who was refreshing by dropping a couple of cynical comments here and there...other than that the acting is just hidious and you can't even blame the actors for it...GL is so busy getting all those cool effects in place that the acting and story are not really his main focus.

1317055,5,B00003CXKT,"Well, after the Phantom Menace had me slightly worried about the future Star Wars prequels, George Lucas has made me a believer again. I am happy to say that (mercifully) Jar-Jar Binks (probably the most annoying character to EVER hit the big screen) was given about 2-3 minutes of total screen time in this movie, which made watching it MUCH more like one of the classic Star Wars movies. It had a darker feel, the story moved a bit faster, Yoda kicks butt, and they captured the romance of Star Wars (i.e. Han & Leia) by bringing Anakin & Senator Amidala  together. You also get to see the dark side of the force starting to weave its way into Anakin's heart in Episode II. The battle between the Jedi & the Imperial droids is unbelievable & the introduction of Jango & son Boba Fett AND the first wave of Stormtroopers (clones). This made it worth Jar-Jar in the Episode I, which would've been much better had Jar-Jar's role been reduced to about 10 scenes less (or about 10 lines less)than he had.

1317056,3,B00003CXKT,"What can I say that hasn't been said already? Being a Star Wars fan, Episode 2 is essential to the story. Episode two is better the
Phantom Menace, but it does have problems.
The story is good but it was excecuted poorly. Lucas does not have the writing skills and directorial skills to make movies work.
It gets four stars because this movie and any other Star Wars movie are not to be taken too serious.
The love story was developed too quickly for the sake of getting Anakin and Padme together. The connection was not there. The
acting was pretting much Star Wars acting. I think that's how the actors are told to act, because Natalie Portman is actually a very
good actress and her performances in Episodes 1 & 2 are below average. So the bad is acting is part of the Star Wars universe.
The action scenes are spectacular. Lucas has always given us the best. The DVD sound and picture is great.
In short, Episode 2 has some great moments but also has a few embarrassing moments. But it's clean fun. When watching, it view
it through a kids eyes and enjoy.
Suggestion to Lucas: Don't direct Episode 3. Star Wars needs to end with a bang. IF you direct Episode 3, Episoded 1-3 will be
regarded as a major let down, which it's already regarded as a disapointment.",1040601600,,1264,4.429184549356223
1317057,2,B00003CXKT,"It's a sad day in America when a film as poorly written, edited, and acted as Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones can make over a half billion dollars.  The second installment in George Lucas' space opera left much to be desired when I watched it in theaters this summer.
One of the challenges I encountered was not being able to see the movie in a digital theater.  Watching it on DVD has made a big difference and prompted me to slightly change my opinion of the film.  The chase through Coruscant is much more engaging on a digital screen, as is Kamino and the first battle of the clone war.
I am sorry to say that the DVD (loaded with extras) does very little to save the film in its entirety. The inclusion of eight deleted scenes does nothing to breathe life into this film.  If the picture had focused more on the action and spared us the ""painfully annoying"" love scenes between Anakin and Amidala, it would have been a much better film.  The only bright spots in this film are the score composed by John Williams and the final confrontation between Yoda and Count Dooku (is it me or does Yoda bare a scary resemblance to an eldery Mickey Rooney?).
Despite making an impressive amount of money at the box office, this movie really was very disappointing, prompting me to ask the question 'Why George, Why?' After movies like Spiderman and the heroic Lord of the Rings trilogy, Star Wars is quickly becoming a thing of the past.
George Lucas should try to balance his creative ability with special effects with a well written, thought out, and enjoyable story for Episode III.  Otherwise, only the die hard fans and forty-somethings holding onto childhood will be there showing support for a franchise that is going the way of the dodo.",1040601600,,1750,4.557324840764331

Yoda doing flips and the old man taking out the ""powerful"" Anakin was so inept. Just give that man a wheelchair and call it a day. Oh yeah, the romance between Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) was the cheesiest thing since ""The Days of Our Lives.""

While almost always pleasing to the senses, the movie had absolutely no substance... especially to justify a revisitation.  Therefore, rent the DVD.

For one thing, the obnoxiously insipid Jar Jar Binks is reduced to a mere cameo, while the ever wise and popular Yoda plays a major role in the film's climax.  Now fully digital instead of a puppet, the little green guy gets to show just why he has this reputation as a Jedi master, with the usual aid of Frank Oz's voice.  Also, the main villian , Count Dooku, is played by the wonderful Christopher Lee with his usual style and grace.  Ewan McGregor is solid as an older Obi-Wan Kenobi.  As always, the special effects are captivating.  However, with all these great assets, the film still has its share of clunky moments.  The romantic sup-plot becomes tediously weak as the film goes on.  While Natalie Portman's Amidala is as lovely as ever, her performance lacks a degree of passion needed to be truely convincing.

1317172,3,B00003CXKT,"This episode was really disappointing for me for as well as for several dedicated Star Wars fans. The main reason is that the acting is so superficial! Anakin has the key  role in the film and Hayden Christensen  can't quite deliver this pivotal role. Ewan McGregor is OK but even with him and Yoda, you get a movie that you are not really satisfied with. If the acting is overall poor, no digital effect will make that movie spectacular. And here you have it. A near failure. I guess Yoda saves the film after all! At least his character is solid and real (even though he isn't).
If you can not come up with  a good movie, the commentaries make no sense.
This episode conveys a sad story, where you see (or are supposed to see) how Anakin starts giving signals of submision into the Dark Side, and it was therefore really important to  show the conversion. But you get the feeling of cheap acting and that's really disappointing. Remember the first scene of Episode IV and how Darth Vader walks through the corridors of the space shuttle. Episode II, by no means, gets any close to that level of acting and atmosphere!
Digital effects are important to Star Wars but I think it is more important to have good acting than to put state-of the art digital effects and turn the saga into a computer game.

Star Wars is as story. It is not meant to be an action mvie with a lot of stuff blowing up. Sure, there are some moments that has that, but they have to be in there, as there are some space battles, etc. Some people may think that the acting is flat in the two movies (The Phantom Menace, and Attack of the Clones) but I see it as a period where there was a lot more peace and order then the Empires reign. For example, when you go to Tatooine, all of the characters talk as they did in the first 3 movies. This is because they live in an un-orderly part of the galaxy.

However, this film was not nearly as likeable as the first of this latest George Lucas trilogy.  Jar Jar Binks barely utters a word. This film was also too long.  Scenes which would have provided smoother and a more natural transition of the story line, (not to mention much better character development), were cut in favor of having longer special effects chase scenes. This film is a good example of where the special effects dominate a film to the exclusion of a possible interesting story line. If I wasn't a biased Star Wars fan, I would have given this film a 2 star rating at the most.  This DVD version includes some of the scenes which were cut.  I think these scenes should have been left in the film to make this film more believable and understandable. These scenes could have been easily kept in the film without adding any extra length to the film just by shortening the unbelievable chase scene that seemed to go on forever.

There are a few points at which the interactions between characters seem a little off, such as Padme's initial reaction to seeing Anakin again, as well as Jar Jar's acceptance speech attempt.  But other times, such as the interaction of Anakin and Padme on the grassy hills of Naboo have some great chemistry.
As the plot builds towards the discovery of Count Dooku's separatist activities, the speed of the movie increases as well.  The action picks up from an already good pace.  The events proceed smoothely towards the epic jedi battle, an experience which should not be missed by any Star Wars fan.  Following the battle of the Jedi, the Clone Army arrives to rescue the loosing jedi.  As the battle insues, the visuals take on an awesome scale.  Leaving the battle to focus on the escape of Dooku, the duel between Yoda and Dooku takes place.  Lucas' team created a very believeable, and definately cool sequence in this duel.  It is also not to be missed.
Throughout the entire film, the visuals are excellent.  By far the most visually rewarding of the Star Wars series so far.  The effects are complex, colorful, and full of reality (for the star wars universe that is).  The imagery is rich, and yet not overpowering.
Overall, I thoroughly enjoy Episode 2.  Each time I watch it, I gain a further appreciation of the film.
The documentaries on the DVD extra's disk should not be missed either.  Very interesting.  They provide further insite, and add to the appreciation of the film.

Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen) has continued his development as a Jedi Knight under the watchful eye of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor).  However, there seems to be a change taking place in Anakin.  He has developed a rebellious side, and he doesn't always follow the advice of Obi Wan.  Also, he has developed very strong feelings for Padme (Natalie Portman).  These type of feelings are forbidden for a Jedi.
Meanwhile, Obi-Wan has discovered the forming of a massive clone army on an uncharted planet, while Dooku, a Jedi who has turned to the dark side, has developed an army of droids with the purpose of destroying the remaining Jedi.
I thought this episode was better than episode I.  The film flows along at a much faster pace than ""The Phantom Menace"", and the action scenes are much better.  The final battle between the Jedi Knights and the droids is eye-popping, and Yoda's light saber duel with Dooku is good as well.

The only thing memorable about this movie was the scene where Anakin finds his captive mother.  I can't really remember much anything else.  There should have been more of the scene where Anakin proceeds to slaughter the tribe that captured his mother.

1317266,4,B00003CXKT,"I'm not really sure how to describe this movie.  Nearly 2 minutes in to the movie and you are already in the action of another Star Wars film.  This movie is right on the mark for creating a universe that is vast and surprising.  Probably the best moment in the movie is where Yoda pulls out the mini-matching green light saber and does battle with the bad guys.  A very good addition to the movie is Jango Fett, Bobba Fett's father.  The action scenes with him are amazing.  The rocket launchers, the laser guns, and even a grappling hook are all a fantastic addition to the plot.
However, some things get old fast.  C-3P0's quirks are back, but some are lame and repetative like you have heard them a million times.  Jar Jar Binx is also back but with a much smaller part.  Other things that lowered my personal rating were the constant cries from the older Anakin Skywalker.  Some of his lines were just too unbearable which reminded me of a whining baby.  These did not render his skills as a Jedi though.  He still knows how to use the Force and kick tail when need be.
If you haven't already seen Star Wars Episode 1, then you'd better hold off on purchasing this until you have seen Star Wars Episode 1.  Most characters from Episode 1 are back in Episode 2 but if you have not seen 1 then it can be very confusing to figure out who is who.  Something else that was lacking in the movie was another evil Jedi who was a real killer. Dooku just wasn't fit for the part.
All in all, this DVD fares up nicely to other DVDs released in the same week.  Oh and if you want my opinion... this movie is much better than Spider-man.",1039824000,,1629,4.277777777777778

(they did NOT just roll together on the grassy hill)  the completely unoriginal, unconvincing (even if you tried) action sequences (seemly designed strictly for the video game)?  the gross over-use of CG?  (its 3/4 cartoon really)
I could go on, but these are the shallow reasons why Lucas has let me down.  Lost in the new episodes are the completely NATURAL and HUMAN relationships, interactions, dialogue, and behavior of the original SW characters.  Episodes 1+2 contain the most STIFFly performed, unengaging scenes, with every actor  convinced that they must act 'dignified' at all times.  Granted, they are jedis and politicians, but it just gets irritatingly fake and pretentious after a while.  Absolutely none of the relaxed/easy feel that made the original characters so charismatic and appealing.  Don't see any new stars born, in other words.",1039824000,,947,5.36734693877551

It actually looks better on DVD without the grainy movie screen situation. Episode II follows in the tradition of Lucas in the 1980s and how he and Skywalker ranch outdid A NEW HOPE with ESB and ROTJ. I thought the final battle in TPM was incredible, but this final battle sequence puts Gungans against Federation Battle Droids to shame. What could be better than a multitude of Jedi with sabres against battle droids supported by the hordes of early stormtroopers commanded by Yoda. I have always been a Boba Fett fan, and the background of Fett and how important of a part he and father play in the whole series is awesome. Christopher Lee's sinister portrayal of Count Dooku with his melodic voice(""You disapoint me Obi Wan, Master Yoda holds you in such high regard!"") chalk this one a notch higher than PHANTOM. Portman is as hot as ever(probably hotter since we can now feast our eyes on more of her beautiful flesh!!), and Hayden has some very powerful acting moments especially when he says ""I killed them, and not just the men, but the women and the children.

1317328,3,B00003CXKT,"There are several problems that I've been noticing in the newer Star Wars movies. None of these problems are amended in Attack of the Clones.
 1) First of all, I can't stand how reckless and lucky these Jedi are. Anakin in Episode 1 ACCIDENTALLY finds himself in the enemy spaceship, hits the fire button and blows it up. Here, we see Obi Wan jump suicidally out of a window and catch a droid of some sort. Shortly after, Anakin stops his flying car, and jumps over the side, without even looking below, and, wonder of wonders, just so happens to land on the roof of the vehicle with the assassin inside. Look, I understand that Jedi's are powerful and all, but in this movie, George Lucas has made them too much like gods, too much like cats that always land feet first and eight lives too many.
 2) Secondly, I've noticed that with these newer Star Wars movies, the quality of dialogue has taken a dive for the worse. We see Yoda, but Yoda doesn't say a single memorable thing for the whole movie. Gone, his wonderful wisdom is.
 3) The acting is terrible. Poker-faced Padme nearly gets assassinated twice and acts as if it were no big deal.
 For all those flaws, I like Attack of the Clones MUCH better than the Phantom Menace. FINALLY, we start to see the story coming together. You'll see the poorly acted relationship between Anakin and Padme. The death of Jango Fett and the beginning of Bobba Fett. The birth of the Stormtroopers. The birth of the Republic. The start of the Empire. Palpatine's power (thanks alot Jar Jar) and his last-second refusal to get rid of it. The creators of the Death Star. And, of course, the beginning of the Clone Wars.
 Whatever failings this movie has, you'll feel rewarded at the end. When you see several divisions of stormtroopers marching into primitive Star Destroyers, you'll feel satisfied, not to mention anxious for the next episode.",1039737600,2,1882,4.622754491017964
1317329,3,B00003CXKT,"I may be the only person who enjoyed Episode I more than Episode II.  Yes, the acting was unusually bad in Episode I, but at least there was not much of it.  The movie was packed with action scenes (pointless but fun) from beginning to end.  Those who critcized the wooden dilivery of hackneyed lines seem to forget the clunkers delivered in the original trilogy.  (""I'm Luke Skywalker.  I'm here to rescue you.""  And does anyone else remember Carrie Fisher's on-again, off-again British accent?)  Star Wars has always been more about the effects than the acting, and Episode I delivered.  Episode II, with the need to begin the slide to the ""Dark Side,"" gets bogged down with story telling and thus falls a little flat.  The acting, while not neerly as painful as Episode I, suddenly stands out a little more.  The effects, while technically more advanced than Episode I, don't always deliver the visual punch.  It only serves to remind you that all the visual wizardry in the world (or should I say ""galaxy"")can't lift a stale movie out of the dumper.  (Nothing comes close to the thrill of the final dogfight of the now technically prehistoric Episode IV.)  Even the famous Yoda-Kicks-[it] scene left me yawning.  Sure, it was well done, but it was over almost before it started and too late in the film for me to really care.  The net effect of this movie is like watching someone else play a video game -- a really long video game.  Still, it is Star Wars, it has it's fun moments, and it's fun to see the origins of all the characters.  If you have not seen the originals (like my daughter) or saw them and quickly forgot them (like my wife) you'd do just as well to save your money.",1039737600,,1689,4.521452145214521

1317333,4,B00003CXKT,"First, it should be known that I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and have been my entire life.  So bear with me if I'm a bit nit-picky.
Epsiode II is a step up from EPI, but that's to be expected.  EPI was really just a stepping-stone to EPII, which is again a stepping stone to the next movie.  The main problem I had with EPII was the love story, which was very drawn out and, to me, boring.
In the first 3 movies, there was a bond between Leia and Han Solo that everyone could see, but there was no need to essentially dedicate an entire movie to it, and in the end it worked out very well, I thought.  I think it would have worked as well here, especially seeing that he had another 3 movies to move it along in.
The next big complaint that I have is the acting.  It appears Lucas has signed on some talented young actors to play the main roles of Padm Amidala and Anakin Skywalker, but I was highly disappointed with their performances.  Whether it's chalked up to the directing, the script or just the actors themselves, I found it very distracting throughout the movie.  However, a positive, I truly love Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi.
The special effects have been talked about repeatedly, and so they should be.  The entire movie is virtually a special effect.  I'm huge on scenery, and the scenery in this movie is unbelievable.  The biggest special effects, of course, coming in the final battle scene.  The huge beginning of the clone war, with hundreds upon hundreds of clones and jedi facing off was simply amazing.  There was quite possibly more action in this one sequence then there was in the entire movie.  And Yoda..  everyone talks about Yoda.  Quite simply, Yoda was the man in this movie.
In the end, I found EPII to be a great movie.  The relationship between Padm and Anakin did drag it down a lot for me, but the way the Star Wars saga was pushed forward made up for it.  Definitely a step up from EPI, but no quite at the level the first 3 movies were at.",1039651200,,1976,4.326086956521739
1317334,2,B00003CXKT,"There's simply not much redeeming about this one.  The opening chase scene on Coruscant starts the film off well, but it's a long, steady downhill from there.
It's hard to know where to start to try to list all of the things wrong with this film, so here are the big three:  George Lucas is a bad director.  George Lucas is a bad screenwriter.  This film has no soul.  Yep, I think that about sums it up.
Lucas is a visionary, a storysmith, and a special effects mastermind.  Those are his strengths, and when he has stuck to them in the past (Empire Strikes back being the best example), the results have been stunning.  But his dialogue is ham-fisted and wooden, and his sense of humor has, if anything, become far more juvenile and immature since the original trilogy.  ...P>I liked Episode I.  I thought it was solid, if not spectacular.  It introduced a new plotline and new worlds, and set the wheels in motion for the trilogy.  My biggest complaints were, as mentioned above, the juvenile humor (Jar Jar, yes, but I thought Anakin was far worse), and the villains.  Sure, Maul was good with the lightsaber, but given that we have no idea where he came from, he has virtually no dialogue, and he's dead by the end of Episode I, it was hard for me to get too involved with his character.  In Episode 2, the situation is worse.  Palpatine remains an uninteresting background character, I have no idea why the trade federation [guys] are back, and Dooku is a model of wasted opportunity.  Arch-villain by committee?  Unsurprisingly, it fails.
Which brings me to the rest:  although we meet many more Jedi, they don't have any more personality than the trade federation robots or the clones.  Jango Fett is only mildly diverting, and although the tie to Empire/Return's Boba Fett is slightly interesting, it certainly doesn't carry the film.  Natalie Portman's outfits are nice if you want to see some skin, but not particularly flattering (especially considering what a beautiful actress they have to work with).  The love scenes are flat.  SENATOR Jar Jar is an insult.
Finally, don't get me started on Yoda.  The CGI Yoda is a mistake -- he looks bogus all the way through.  And that finale saber duel is one of the most ... Matrix (""I know kung fu"")-wannabe scenes I've seen in quite a while.
Give me a break.  George, please please please put your ego down for the next couple of years and let someone competent write and direct Episode 3.  Please.  Say no to the Dark Side.

Where exactly is the plot in these first two movies?
Sure, Annakin Skywalker is going to turn into Darth Vader, he's going to have kids with (now Senator, ex-Queen) Amadala, the ""Federation"" is going to turn into the Empire...but that appears to be it.
Just like Episode I, the plot lines are a complete and utter mess...
Who is Count Dooku? Why is masterminding a plot against the Senate?
Why does he want Amadala killed?
If the bounty hunter Fett is in league with Dooku, why was he living on that wacky clone planet, where the Federations' Clone army is being bred? And when when this army is used against Dooku's droid army, why is it such a big surprise to Dooku that such an army exists?...don't you think Fett would have told Dooku about what was going on?
And are we supposed to go along with the absurd sub-plot of Annakin going back to Tattoinne to see his mother...but oh no, she's been captured by the Sand People..now I thought that the Sand People were nothing but marauders and hunters, but amazingly, they decided to keep her literally hanging around for a month...oh, but here's Annakin to the rescue..oops sorry, she's dead now...what a disgrace
The acting is dreadful. Ewan McGregor tried so hard to act like a young Alec Guiness, Hayden Christiansen is so pedestrian and plastic that he drags down every scene that he's in. At least Natalie Portman spent some quality time parading around in a tight space suit.
There are just too much special effects, you get caught up in watching all the spaceship traffic jams on the George Jetson-like aerial freeways that you forget there is actually supposed to be a story being told.

1317388,4,B00003CXKT,"As with any movie that has several reviews, I normally avoid any additional comments unless I feel I have some unique to add. I do prefer the original movies (before they became special editions), but it's nice to see the history behind the original stories. Plus, you see ships and uniforms that look like they are a few steps away from becoming the objects so familiar in the original trilogy. ...mainly in the final scenes. You see the ships that will become the Star Destroyers and the clone uniforms look like the Stormtrooper uniforms. If you're familiar with the original trilogy, you should be able to recognize alot.
That is the only thing I like about this movie. It provides the background information. These newer films are lacking something on their own. The emotional response isn't as strong here. It's more like big special effect, action scenes. The only emotions come from scenes with corny dialogue. I happen to like some of the deleted scenes. I prefered the family dinner scene (on disc 2) for establishing the relationship between Anakin and Padme.
As for the Easter egg...
I tend to get impatient in getting to the movie. I'll hit the Menu button or the Forward Search button to try to skip past the various logos and such before the DVD's menu. The name may vary among players, but on mine, the Forward Search is used to skip through segments in a movie.
When the animated menu appears with the Star Wars logo moving backwards, hitting the Forward Search button will give you alternate menu formats. They all have the same options as the normal one based on the scene in the fighting arena. I usually get a menu based on the water planet. Once, I got another menu based on the first chase scene where Anakin and Obi-Wan are flying through the city. Those are the only other menus I've seen so far.
I do not care for Lucas' newer efforts, but I do like seeing the Star Wars history this movie presents. That is my main reason for seeing the new movies. On its own, there is too much focus on special effects.

The horrible casting and acting is alone enough to turn one away.  Add bad dialog and the boredom of 3/4 of the storyline and buying this is like burning a $20 bill in the fireplace.  Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) is the worst actor ever cast in a major picture.  ""Tormented by the dark-side"" does not mean boring emotionless bad actor.  After struggling to stay awake thru 1/2 of the movie I simply fast forwarded past any scene with him and Natalie Portman, who lowers her performance to his level.  The scene with the stupid waterfall, what a bunch of filler junk.  The action scenes are also way overboard, like when Anakin jumps out of the spaceship and grabs the back of the other.  Force or no Force, give me a break.  All technology, no true attention to story.  Wanting to know the details leading to the next movie is the only reason to watch it, other than ""well, I have all the others on DVD, i guess I need this one.""

1317390,5,B00003CXKT,"After the somewhat dissapointing THE PHANTOM MENACE, ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a much more exciting instalment in the STAR WARS saga. Set about 10 years after the events in TPM, Attack of the Clones is a more action-orientated entry, with incredible battle set pieces. Hayden Christensen is Anakin Skywalker, the troubled Padawan to Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi. McGregor's performance as the great Jedi Master is much improved, and Christensen's journey from envious apprentice to the echoes of the future Darth Vader is impressive, creating more believable characters. And thankfully, Jar Jar is a much more subdued character than in Menace.
Boasting a strong supporting cast including the brilliant Christopher Lee (Count Dooku), Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Temuera Morrison as Jango Fett, the action, this time around is bolstered by strong presences. And even if Lee is simply reprising his role as the dark Saruman the White from Lord of the Rings, he's a great character, helped with a surprisingly good quality script. In addition, Morrison makes a good impact as the father of Boba Fett, and Samuel L. Jackson gets more action as Jedi Master Mace Windu.
Moving away from the plodding politics of the first film, events in this one are all about action, with lightsaber fights aplenty. Stunning combinations of CGI and live action at once make for some incredible action scenes. The romantic story involving Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman is sometimes stilted, but the main plot line makes for a truly incredible action-fest. And what's more, the action is more emotionally-involved than Episode 1. With Padme's and Anakin's forbidden love fuelling hatred and anger, the story is more involving than CG gungans and droids in Episode 1.

John William's score is brilliant, echoing his work for THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, wih some of his best work. The CGI in this film is even more impressive, and the astonishing cities and vistas are fully realised with some incredible FX creations.
The action, characters, creatures and FX all combine to create an breath-taking experience that will leave you breathless. Star Wars fans will not be disappointed.

1317391,4,B00003CXKT,"For those of us of a certain age who remember the impression the original trilogy made on us twenty years ago, the two prequels don't quite stand up.  Taken on their own, however, the assessment is rather more optimistic, though still not stellar.  When ""Attack of the Clones"" appeared seven months ago, a fairly ordinary reaction was that at least it was better than ""The Phantom Menace"".  At first I shared that opinion but after watching the DVD I must admit that on its own it's quite an achievement.  The visuals are stunning; that almost goes without saying.  It's incredible how realistic computer-generated animation and backgrounds have become.  The story, which I found a little confusing the first time round, now makes sense.  For those who have complained that the film is mired in wordy political talk, I would offer this excuse: the prequels are about the fall of Anakin Skywalker and the rise of the Empire, the latter of which *is* a political story.  It's pretty difficult to relate the underhanded machinations of Palpatine without verbal explanation.  This particular story element takes up no more than a few minutes of dialogue and hardly disrupts the flow of the movie.
The one thing that has garnered some well-deserved criticism is the style of the dialogue itself.  It never really seems to flow naturally, though it seems to me that in some small way what Lucas was trying to do was to create a style of speech peculiar to this time and place.  The British actors are, in my opinion, better able to deal with it.  Even when the words sound strange, the British seem better able to bring off the dialogue when most of the North Americans sound uncomfortable.  In this respect, I'll give the two young leads the benefit of the doubt as far as talent goes.  (For that matter, Shakespeare can sound a little odd spoken with a North American accent even by the most talented actors.)
On the whole this is a movie worth buying.  Yes, it *is* better than ""The Phantom Menace"", but it doesn't need the comparison.",1039478400,,2032,4.732954545454546
1317392,3,B00003CXKT,"I am a moderate Star Wars Fan, and leaving all biases aside, I would only rate this DVD 2 stars if not for the last 30 minutes and the ""behind the scenes"" content. Part 2 is a very mediocre movie at best. The two stars of the movie, Portman and Christensen, seem to drag through the movie, barely lending any emotion to an already dead script. Should we be moved when Young Darth is crushed to hear his mother's dying words, only to slaughter those sand people and their children? The queen / senator's (or whatever) response is ""we all make mistakes"". I believe that Little Darth would be moved to do this, but her response is so ridiculous. Is that a simple mistake? Shouldn't she be worried that her love interest (of which she has been keeping secret all this time) can slaughter a hundred or so ""beings""? It seems as though the dialogue was rushed, which is hardly acceptable since Lucas had decades to hone a script worthy of Part 4 and Part 5 (Part 6 was good, not great). The movie didn't satisfy me until maybe the last 30 minutes when a smidgen of the epic feeling the original movies had emerges. Decent performances by Lee and McGregor somewhat make up for the other poor performances, but in no way do they make up for the rest of the film.
The feature contents of the DVDs should satisfy the avid Star Wars fan, and possibly leave the rest of us not curse the 2 hours we wasted on the movie itself. I am, however, looking forward to the third installment, given that it lives up to the last 30 or so minutes of the second.

HOWEVER, when I got the DVD for my birthday and I watched it at home, the special effects became suddenly ""regular"" and the acting became suddenly contrived and down-right bad.
Alas, with all the desire to love this movie, I can't justify it. The ""love"" scenes are unbearable, the acting laughable and the special effects OK. Thus, a 3 star movie.",1039305600,3,452,4.524390243902439

Well, it's definently an improvement over The Phantom Menace.  The love story seems a little...odd...at times?  But, it's Star Wars and it includes the big action scenes that we all love.  What I thought was very nice about the film was that, even though we know what's going to happen in the long run, it still keeps us in suspense.  Deep down you DO want to know HOW Anakin turns to the Dark Side, and HOW the Galactic Republic transforms into the Galactic Empire.  Lucas and ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) once again pull off the impossible, and create a visually stunning masterpiece.  And, oh, the wonders of DVD.  It looks and sounds absolutely great.  Now if we can just get the original trilogy...
 -SPECIAL FEATURES-
Basically the same amount of bonus material as ""The Phantom Menace"" DVD, ""Attack of the Clones"" features a variety of documentaries that I actually found to be very entertaining and insightful.  No repetitious featurettes.  By watching all of them you get the full picture and scale of the project.  But what would it be without the Deleted Scenes?  Every good filmmaker knows that you have to leave something on the cutting room floor.  Quite a bit was left out this time around.  The deleted scenes are in great quality, and fun to watch.  I'm unhappy that ""Beneath the Dome"" was only a trailer.  The whole thing (a ""mockumentary"") is being released seperately.
Overall, a stunning film, and a load of DVD stuff that Star Wars fans can dig into.",1039305600,,1481,4.72265625

1317489,5,B00003CXKT,"Lucas has improved on the movie with better editing for the DVD.  Eight or nine expensive scenes hit the floor, making a tighter faster action flow.  E II would have made another $ 100 MM domestic if it had come out like this.
One sad change is the Lucas gave in to the Whining Class and trashed Jar Jar Binks.  A brilliant comic character, God's Fool, disappears into a simpleton.  Being There is extinguished. Jar Jar on the battlefield in E I was the greatest piece of physical commedy since Chaplin.
Non-Star Wars fans will miss a good half of the story.  There's no way to understand all of what's happening.  Imagine jumping into a Shakespeare ""Henry"" with no knowledge of English history.",1039305600,,695,4.609756097560975
1317490,4,B00003CXKT,"If you do not love Star Wars: Attack of the Clones for its outstanding acting and flawless screenplay, you are not alone. It doesn't have either. Those two reasons are precisely why I knocked a star off the rating. Perhaps I should have knocked of one for each, but this movie certainly does not deserve that abuse in my mind.
The first third of this movie was enjoyable, the second third was slightly dull, and the last third was entertaining beyond belief. Sure the pacing is a little off, but I love this movie nonetheless. George Lucas has successfully taken us to that universe far far away for countless adrenaline-packed adventures and he does it again with this movie. The beginning of the Clone War in this movie was so incredibly incredible that it has to be seen to be believed!
It is so true that if Lucas had put even a shred of the effort he used for the movies' visuals into the dialogue and acting, this movie could have been much better. Sadly, Lucas doesn't seem to care much for individual performances however. Only he could waste the talents of such an all-star cast.",1039219200,,1088,4.5561224489795915
1317491,5,B00003CXKT,"Where Phantom Menace was almost wooden, predictable and even boring, Episode II breaks out with a much more engrossing plot, that actually makes sense and builds to the pivotal Episode lll (sidenote: expected out in 2005).  The special effets are dazzling, dialouge much improved, and the actors are much more comfortable with their characters (and having english horror vet Christopher Lee doesn't hurt).
The plot goes as such: the galaxy is continuing to crumble under political turmoil, a growing serparist movement and even the jedi are lessening in numbers.  To go along with this, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen) is fast becoming a great jedi, but also has a rebellious, eccentric side that makes him butt heads with his mentor, Ob1 (Ewan McGregor).  But when an assanation attempt on Senator Amidala (Natalie Portman, thank you Jack Osbourne for helping me remember that name) Anakin is assigned to protect her while Ob1 goes after Amidala's  assansins.  but he soons finds himself caught in a plot against the Galaxy that has been in the making for many years.  All the while, Anakin is falling for Amidala.
George Lucas realized his mistakes from the last film, and brings in screenwriter Johnathon Hales to help with the dialouge which isn't perfect but it is still well done.  As I said before, the special effects are unbelivable, made even better here because of its digital recording.  I don't really look at the special features, so you'll have to go somewhere else for someone to review those.  But the movie is fantastic and that is what matters.",1039219200,3,1570,5.007692307692308

This latest Star Wars movie must have been made by the merchandising department as I find it hard to believe that the George Lucas we know from his earlier works made this one. Even the early work, THX 1138 shines in comparison.",1039132800,2,288,4.538461538461538
1317493,4,B00003CXKT,"STAR WARS EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES is not out on DVD. The quality of the sound and the direct digital transfer is amazing. This movie is far superior to The Phantom Menace for two reasons; A) A tiny bit of exposure to Jar Jar Binks and B) this one has a story. Now performances not withstanding - the visuals and dynamics of the scenes, sets and stunts is absolutely amazing. George Lucas (Raiders Of The Lost Ark, American Graffiti, THX 1138) took more time on this film and really explored the characters.
As Senator Padme, Natalie Portman (Zoolander, Mars Attacks), gives the best performance. Followed by Ewen MacGregor (Moulin Rouge, Black Hawk Down, Trainspotting) who although doesn't have a lot of character acting - does some amazing performing knowing that practically every scene he has - he acting against a giant blue screen. Very well done and he is intense.
Now the star scene and performer in the whole film was a completely digital character. Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz - Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear) has the most incredible battle of Light Sabers with Counselor Dakoo played by Christopher Lee (Lord Of The Rings, The Three Musketeer). The scene is intense and shows an enormous about of wisdom, passion and power that Yoda has.
The weakest performance for me was Hayden Christensen (Life Is A House)  who performed much more believably in Life Is A House then he did in this film. Jango Fet played by Temuera Morrison (Vertical Limit, Six Days Seven Nights) gives a much more convincing performance as the bounty hunter along with Samuel Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Unbreakable, Shaft) who really portrays a wise and experienced Jedi.
The DVD extras on this one are worth every penny. The Documentaries are great and the educational value of computers and editing is worth watching. There are deleted scenes and the commentary by George himself and the filmmakers. The interviews and behind the scenes production commentaries are both interesting and funny. It also gives you a great perspective on what it takes to make a movie like this.
This is a good Scie Fi film to have in your collection and with the exception of Anakin (Haydenson) the movie is fast-paced, interesting and visual candy for the eye. Get this one! (11-26-02)",1039132800,,2250,4.8441558441558445
1317572,2,B00003CXKT,"The original Star Wars trilogy really wasn't that good, as movies go. The first installment was a B-movie dressed up in special effects that were, at the time, dazzling; it was fun, but has failed to maintain its luster with age. Watching it recently, it seemed to me little more than a long sequence of scenes of bickering. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was more ambitious, albeit pasted together from other sources and as such a trifle hackneyed. ""The Return of the Jedi"" was, to put it bluntly, a marketing ploy disguised as a film. It was disappointing, upon viewing ""The Phantom Menace,"" to find that George Lucas was still in ""Return"" mode--plot points and characters specifically designed with action figures and video games in mind, an incoherent plot, characters drawn hastily and lifelessly, dialogue to make one cringe.
The dialogue in ""Attack of the Clones"" is wretched; the characters are wooden and lifeless.  At no point was I ever particularly concerned that something bad was about to happen to someone--not because of any lack of danger (one of the main characters was killed off in ""Phantom Menace,"" after all), but because I honestly could care less about anyone in the film.  While the filmmakers may promote the ""love story"" supposedly at the heart of the film, I defy anyone to claim that they actually remember any of the lovey-dovey moments with anything resembling fondness. Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman might be decent actors, but the script they're handed here makes it impossible to tell. Similarly, George Lucas demonstrates once again that while he is capable of infinite care and attention to detail when it comes to the appearances of his aliens, the quality of his special effects and the flow of his action sequences (one need only view portions of the documentaries on the second disc of the 2-DVD set), he hasn't the time or inclination to bother telling a coherent story, or drawing up characters you want to remember even minutes afterward. This set of Star Wars films is in desperate need of a Han Solo, or anything remotely resembling a normal human being.
That said, you are probably not considering buying or viewing this movie to see great cinema. You want to get on the latest thrill ride from Lucasfilm. You want to see over a hundred Jedi Knights, light-sabers flashing, in battle against thousands of battle droids; a wild hovercar chase among the skyscrapers of Coruscant; a fierce laser-blaster battle between droids and clones; most of all, you want to see Master Yoda in action as he duels the evil Count Dooku, first with sorcerous powers, then with light-sabers. Your enthusiasm is not tempered by the fact that Yoda's battle lasts all of 30 seconds; that the effects and computer animation used to accomplish all of this are now ho-hum stock-in-trade for action films; that several scenes (particularly anything involving a caped figure flying at high speed outdoors) could just as well have been filmed with 1970s technology (they look that bad); that it is never particularly clear why Count Dooku is so evil, or why anyone wants to assassinate Senator Padme Amidala, or...oops, there I go again, expecting more than I should from my thrill rides.
Seeing the latest ""Star Wars"" installment is a ritual by now; you owe it to your childhood (or whatever memory you have of 1977-1983) to see the new flicks at some point. Why anyone would want to own this is really beyond me.",1039132800,,3437,4.893653516295026
1317573,5,B00003CXKT,"I don't understand why episode 2 got so many negative reviews, I never will. Those who bashed the film are simply NOT Star Wars fans. The fact is, the grand vision of Star Wars has been realized in Episode 2, Fans who loved all the great things about the original trilogy will be delighted with what's in store in Episode 2. You will be brought back to why you liked Star Wars in the first place: action, adventure, fantasy, heroism, a world of wonder and intrigue. Yes, in case you haven't been fortunate enough to see it yet, George Lucas has really created a spectacle with AOTC. Even if you don't like the romantic angle or the way some dialog is delivered, you can't help but sit back in awe as you are swept off to that galaxy far, far away.
Clones is overwhelming and enjoyable at the same time. The viewer is placed in the middle of this rapidly progressing storyline of galactic proportions and must hold on for the ride (much like the Matrix or the Empire Strikes Back). Anakin, now playd by Hayden Christiansen, has become a powerful jedi yet still must learn to control his emotions. Hayden does a great job portraying the character who is faced with many crucial decisions involving forbidden love and the temptations of anger, all while trying to live up to the jedi standard. You can literally see Anakin losing control and drawing strength from the dark side. It will be inevitable in the next movie, something has to break.
Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Sam Jackson, and the rest of the familiar cast are back, all stepping up their performances a notch from Ep. 1. As the plot twists and turns, several new characters are introduced. Jango Fett, a ruthless bounty hunter along with the mysterious Count Dooku (played by Christopher Lee- Saruman in Lord of the Rings) are the two main additions and we finally get to see Boba Fett as a youngster. New locations include Kamino, an ocean covered planet where the clones are created and Geonosis, a rocky location where the Separatist movement- comprised of groups who are rebelling against the republic, are staging their army. New places, vehicles, ships, aliens, droids, weapons, etc. are always cool and there are TONS of them in Ep. 2. So much detail you could never see everything.
AOTC has some of the most beautiful scenery and visuals
I have ever seen in a movie. It also has the most action of any movie I've ever seen, the final battle alone involves thousands of droids, vehicles, jedi and clone troopers. I should point out that ep. 2 is the most violent movie in the series, probably not good for little kids.
The dvd itself is a superb production, great artwork, menus, features, and extras like Ep. 1. It's a 2 disc set, with hours of documentaries, deleted scenes, and effect breakdowns to explore. I highly recommend the widescreen dvd, excellent picture and sound. The music is really outstanding too. We get to hear the imperial march for the first time in a prequel (further tying it to the original trilogy). People who say the prequels aren't as good as the first 3 have not seen AOTC with an unbiased frame of mind, void of negative reviews by the stuck up critics who had their opinions formed before they went to see it. I recently saw the movie in Imax format, and I was blown away. Don't miss your chance to see a Star Wars movie on the giant screen (w/ incredible sound).
The plot is part mystery, part love story, part gladiator, part war film. With so much going on, repeat viewings are very helpful. Lucas pulled it off so nicely. There are too many favorite scenes to describe, but the best are the speeder chase on Coruscant, lightsaber battle, Obi Wan vs. Jango/Boba Fett, the droid foundry, and the arena battle. Ep. 2 is an incredible display of how digital technology is the way of the future. Ep. 2 is the first movie ever filmed entirely digitally, a process that will allow director's to be able to create their true vision and do things that were nearly impossible before.
Lucas' plot has a lot more going on than just good vs. evil. The story deals with things like relationships and how one's actions affect those around them. How if you lose control there are consequences to face. How good can be turned to evil. Directors have messages to tell the audience. They might not be obvious, but upon repeat viewings you can get more out of it.
Well I can't say enough good things about the newest installment of Star Wars. You just have to see for yourself. Truly art of the highest quality .There is a LOT going on here, and it is all building up, many things have yet to be revealed and fully explained. This may be why people aren't getting it. Alot of the plot and symbolism might be going right over the critics' heads. The story is starting to get very interesting. Thank you George Lucas and the small army who worked so hard on it. Can't wait for Episode 3! In conclusion, AOTC is a wonderful experience, for me it has everything that makes a great movie. You will feel like a kid again watching this film.",1039132800,3,5021,4.5676274944567625

Underdeveloped characters, too much digital effects (even the sets are fake!), and a Cheese filled story all make this film one of the worst I have ever seen.  George Lucas is obviously throwing out these prequels to make money, and he has lost his devotion to the fans.  Plain and simple, this movie was a marketing ploy for Lucasfilm and ILM to show their talents(?) due to the failing of his efffects company.
The movie lacks detail, skill, and a coherent story, also the film seems to be directed by a twelve year old with ADD.

Certianly far better than Episode I.
I think some of the die hard fans are reading too much into this. The fact of the matter is expectations can never be met perfectly. From what I've been reading, it seems like the expectations of some reviewers here are insatiable.
Maybe we shouldn't expect every prequel to be identivle to the first three films.
That aside, I'll admit that some parts of the script were crumby, the romance between Anakin and Amidala was a bit cheesey at certain points but even so, I was entertained and found the characters very engaging.",1039132800,,615,4.6
1317576,2,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars-Episode II-Attack of the Clones is easily the weakest film in the Star Wars series.  The story takes place ten years after The Phantom Menace and young Anakin Skywalker has grown from a preteen into a young Jedi apprentice.  Hayden Christensen has assumed the role of Anakin and you have to wonder what the other candidates were like for Mr. Christensen to get the role.  He is supposed to portray a young man tortured by his feelings for senator Padme Amidala the senator from Naboo who he met on his home planet of Tatooine and his duty as a Jedi.  The audience is the only one tortured.  The sappy dialogue between Anakin and Padme is right out of a third rate romance novel.  Despite Mr. Christensens shortcomings, the film is not without merit.  Ms. Portman is luminous as Senator Amidala and she manages to rise above the dialogues shortcomings.  The story line showing the creation of the Clone Army is interesting and intriguing and it also introduces another character from the original trilogy, Boba Fett.  We learn that his father Jengo Fett was the host body for the clones and that Boba is actually a clone of Jengo.  Christopher Lee is solid as the evil Count Dooku adding yet another evil character to his resume and Ewan McGregor is back as Obi-Wan.  Attack Of The Clones is only really worth watching as a bridge between Episode I and the final Episode and if you are a Star Wars fan it is a must own DVD for being part of the Star Wars enterprise alone.",1039132800,,1481,4.550943396226415
1317577,1,B00003CXKT,"Okay, I'm just asking all the crazed fans of this movie to reflect on the good old days of Star Wars with our hero Han Solo.  (Go Han)  Remember Han; he was a character; he was greedy enough to pick a dead man's pocket and nice enough to even help on occasion (if he thought somebody might pay him.)  On top of all that Han had these great tendencies to charge the bad guys when he was cornered; it was the funniest thing ever.  Then there was Luke an all around likable hero with a tendency toward blasting shut his escape hatches.  And then both Han and Luke were fighting over Leia who turned out to be Luke's sister!  Oh it was great.  Here's a few more cherries on the top.  There were great characters like R2D2 (Beep-bu-bu-beep-beep beep beep).  R2 used to have a personality.  Now he just kind of rolls around and maybe beeps when the camera can't see him.  Oh and remember when the guys used to fight with their light sabers?!  Not square dance?  (these new movie things make a battle field look like a great place to settle down and take a little nap.)  AND most people like a little one liner (joke); but Star Wars used to be able to put three good one liners on top of each other; and now, about all the movies seem to get out of the actors is: ""Yeah, yeah, no, I thought so, can I shut my self in the butt now?""  The story line used to move ahead at light speed (litterally)!  Now, it trudges on like Yoda with a broken leg.  Please somebody send Anakin back to the unemployment office and give me back my man:  Three cheers for Han Solo!!",1039046400,5,1552,4.1858108108108105
1317578,3,B00003CXKT,"Infinitely better than ""Episode I"", but that's still damning it with faint praise. To be fair, there are some wonderful moments here: the thrilling chase through Coruscant; Obi-Wan and Jango's rain-soaked one-on-one; and the chillingly vicious Lightsaber Round Robin finale - Yoda's ""Matrix""-style moves notwithstanding. Jar Jar is mercifully relegated to the minor (and rather apt) role of unwitting traitor, and Christopher Lee brings some much needed gravitas to the whole affair. Though the story drags it's reasonably well-structured, balancing the action with the necessary (though limp) romance. And the motivation for Anakin's descent into evil is almost credible, even if Hayden Christensen isn't. But once again, Lucas sabotages what could have been his masterpiece with what is clearly a CGI-obsession bordering on clinical insanity.  Entire sequences, such as the droid assembly line (coming soon to a Gameboy near you) and the ""Gladiator""-inspired arena battle, seem plainly motivated by little more than the desire to do something cool with effects. But they aren't cool. They're mind-numbingly boring. The climactic battle between droids and clones is so self-consciously spectacular that the audience is left feeling more alienated than engaged. Sure, CGI played a role in every scene in this film - even the ones I loved. But that wasn't what I loved about them. For me, it was one or two of the humans who almost saved the day. In particular, the performance of Ewan McGregor, with his wryly humorous Alec Guinness impersonation and his ability to wring some semblance of credibility from even the most banal of George's lines, was almost enough to salvage the entire production. But not quite.
The documentaries on Disk 2 are revealing.  They show how this kind of film is made, and precisely why it's so uninvolving: the effort is completely misplaced.  They spend weeks deciding precisely how Yoda's ears should move, or YEARS creating two-second shots for battle sequences that never make it to the final cut.  How much better would this and the other prequel episodes have been if Lucas and his pals had given the same attention to writing the screenplay or the directing the cast?

1317631,2,B00003CXKT,"I admit, I was disappointed when I saw Phantom Menace, but I saw Attack of the Clones with a fresh outlook.  Surely, Lucas saw the problems with Menace and looked to create something magical with Clones.  Alas, I was sorely disappointed.
Attack of the Clones was 143 minutes of boredom.  Except for the gimmicks the Lucas inserted into the movie (the chase scene through Coruscant, the introduction of Jango Fett, the all-digital production, etc.) there was nothing even remotely worthwhile about this film.  I mean, the ""Attack"" wasn't until 1:45 into the movie!
There is, of course, one giant exception... Yoda's scene at the end of the movie.  That one scene was almost worth the price of admission, and is the only reason that I gave this film any stars at all.
In the end, it really just seems that Lucas has lost his touch.  The first three films were magical, showing an epic tale of good versus evil.  The new films seem contrived, unbelievable, and just plain dumb.  I honestly think that what kept the first three films fresh was the input generated by having different directors on Empire and Jedi, or at least having other people work on the story.
Lucas' ego has made this a one-man crusade, and as a result the story gets a one-dimensional feel.  Maybe he's getting too mellow in his older age.  Lucas is destroying his own franchise... Episode III is his last chance to return to the glory of the first trilogy.  I hope that he uses that opportunity wisely.",1039046400,10,1472,4.666666666666667

1317635,3,B00003CXKT,"It is ironic that the special effects that George Lucas so brilliantly pioneered are now being used so much more adroitly by other directors.  In films like ""Gladiator"", ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""Black Hawk Down"" we see those effects being used to subtly enhance the core elements of any movie: story and acting.  Unfortunately, Lucas, while undeniably a technical genius and innovator of the highest order, is a rather ham-fisted director who doesn't ask for much (and doesn't receive much) from his actors.
In ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" the viewer is treated to a visually spectacular film that is nonetheless seriously lacking heart.  It takes place ten years after the events of ""Episode I"", and follows Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and Padme Amidala, (along with a host of Jedi) as they race to subvert the convoluted plans of the mysterious Darth Sidious.  In between spectacular fight scenes, Lucas tries his hand at directing a political thriller.  Unlike some, I like the idea; had it been successfully executed, it would have firmly grounded the saga in a realistic setting.  As it actually turned out, Lucas created a Byzantine plot that is almost incomprehensible even after multiple viewings.  He doesn't focus on the correct elements to develop the plot in a larger context, which might be OK if it weren't for the fact that the relationships at the micro level are almost laughable.
The centerpiece of these relationships is the doomed love between Padme and Anakin.  The problem is, the audience already knows that they get together (from the first trilogy), so there is no suspense about the ""if"" of the relationship, and Lucas doesn't seem terribly interested about the ""why"".  Instead, he offers up extended scenes from their courtship.  Again, this isn't an inherently bad idea, but it would require far abler hands.  Hayden Christensen's acting is so leaden and over the top, you would have to be blind to not see this kid is headed for trouble.  Padme is supposed to be smart woman, she's a senator after all, yet somehow she isn't the least bit concerned about his frequent violent outbursts, or even his admission of a revenge massacre.  At the end of the movie, she's more of a lovesick puppy than a senator, and I was left wondering what possible interest she could have in a man who clearly has severe mental problems.  The only remotely interesting scene featuring the two is one in which the tension mounts and it seems that Anakin might assault Padme, which would have been a fascinating plot twist.  Instead, the tension fizzles and the whole scene comes to nothing.
In the end this is a fun film to watch, but it's also frustrating because it could be so much more.  You almost have to shut your brain off and just enjoy all the pretty pictures.  Seeing Yoda in a light saber battle makes the film worth watching, but there is absolutely no substance to it.  You won't regret watching it, but you'll also wonder what might have been.  With a different director, and some key script revisions, it could have been a much grittier, darker, more interesting film.  As it is, ""Episode II"" is a convoluted political thriller sandwiched between spectacular set scenes.  It's good for a rainy Saturday afternoon, but not much else.",1038873600,6,3286,4.853046594982079

Apples and oranges! They are simply so different from each other, that there is no comparison. Ewan McGregor comes into his own with his portrayal of Obi-Wan in this film and Hayden Christensen is fantastic, giving a nuanced portrayal of the soon to be Darth Vader.

Re: Imminent Decimation of the Jedi
Effective immediately, the Jedi Council will implement the following changes in procedure if it expects to survive one more film:
1. George Lucas will be fired as the writer of dialog. Wooden dialog is incompatible with both heroism and mystic eloquence.
2. All Jedi will receive special training in two arts: dramatic story-telling and dueling with Sith Lords.
3. Use of the parental and stuffy term ""my young apprentice"" will cease immediately. Padawan learners feel orphaned enough already by being taken away from their parents at an early age.
4. Jedi will kindly recognize that THEY are dividing the Force by all this fear of the ""dark side"" which their propaganda encourages. Simple psychology tells us that repressing one side of any experience splits it off and makes it stronger. This is why Jedi, who tend to be Republicans, so often wind up taking a walk on the Dark Side.
5. Discouraging marriage tends to mess people up. For more about this, look at other priesthoods for abundant examples.
6. Master Yoda will be given permission his sentences to construct the rest of us like.
7. Jedi will henceforth always carry an extra light saber.",1038873600,2,1212,4.917073170731707
1317699,3,B00003CXKT,"This is NOT the best Star Wars movie.  I thought the first three were great, and each one seemed to be better than the last.  I guess Lucas needed some more money, or he wanted to feel young again, but Episode I and II both fell short of the high standards set by the original three.  This Episode is much better than the Jarr Jarr Binks Blaaaaahh, but it is NOT the awe-inspiring WOWZER that you might be hoping for.  There are some fantastic action scenes (though a very well expected and routine to the Star Wars movie pattern/formula).  Most of the effects are magical by 1970's standards, but sad-to-say average by today's.  I did love the ground battle scenes, and I think we'll see more of that kind of thing in upcoming movies (Lord of the Rings:Two Towers is a good example of that trend).  The sound effects are extemely good, but I think they got lost in the drifting-sometimes plodding-plot.  If you're a Star Wars nut, you're gonna like how all the pieces of the series fit together.  If you're anything less than a Star Wars nut....well, it's still worth adding to your collection.  You might wanna rent it first and see for yourself, but just don't watch it expecting to see the best Star Wars film yet.  Poor George has to save that one for last.  After all, how would it look to have an incredible series like this one, and then have the last movie [go]out?

1317700,1,B00003CXKT,"Wow, what to say... Well, this is a very beautiful movie, but it's also  very painfully dull. I heard a quote regarding it; ""about as much fun as watching someone else play a videogame for 2 and a half hours"" and that is apt. Anyone who has a videogame system doesn't need this movie, but maybe older people or the very young will enjoy it? It's quite stupidly written and acted. I mean, it couldn't be more embarrassing, the co-writer actually compared his dialogue work on this to Shakespeare, at a convention. Christopher Lee is great, as well as Ewan  McGregor. I liked Hayden Christensen as Anakin, and Padme, but they both do terrible work here. Mace Windu is funny, especially when he says ""I don't think so"" in the arena to Chris Lee and Lee looks like he can't help but laugh. The real fun is watching this movie at the back of a theater and making fun of it with friends, while taking in the visuals. Some important, interesting scenes were cut, it's clear that Lucas is a big-picture guy and doesn't seem to 'get' the smaller, more crucial parts. The love story doesn't actually exist, it's not 'dark', it never comes within 'exciting'. I hated nearly all the additions like the space-bar and grill, the Japanese woman in the library, the dull, regurgitated music... Overall, AOTC is the first and only film I've ever seen that never redeems itself for anything but the visuals. Well maybe TPM was the first, but I will never want to waste time by seeing this ever again. I like the world created, but this was so poor. Everyone I know wonders if they made it this bad on purpose. A really young crippled kid liked it at the show, he mentioned to his dad that he loved when Yoda threw away his walking stick and fought 'Dooku', so I can't call it a complete failure.

1317702,3,B00003CXKT,"I waited months after the release of this film before actually seeing it.  I can honestly say that I don't really feel it is an improvement over E1.  Frankly, some things were improved and other things remained just as bad.  On the whole, I came away from the film with the same uneasy feeling I had after seeing episode one; the feeling that I had just watched something that aspired to be great, and contained occasional moments of brilliance, but ultimately did not satisfy my expectations.
I am NOT one of those die-hard STAR WARS fans that many speak of with such distain.  I love the original trilogy, but only had a small number of toys or action figures.  I currently do not even own the originals because I am waiting (and waiting...and waiting...) for them to be released on DVD.  That said, episode two is just plain strange.  I am able to suspend my disbelief about as good as anyone, but the over-abundance of CG work here leaves me cold.  The CG work is well done, but that's the problem; it's TOO well done.  There is just no way that the 'clean-ness' and crispness of CG can look as good and as real as models.  Everything is so shiny and smooth.  Where are the scorch marks?  Burn marks? Weathering?  Anyway, you get the point.  In a word: STERILE.
Now for the 'acting'.  I was pleasantly surprised by Christensen's performance.  After what I had read I was expecting it to be God-awful a la an Ed Wood film.  I suppose with such low expectations I was bound to be somewhat satisfied.  He did a serviceable job, at times I even thought he did a good job.  It must be very difficult to portray a character such as Anakin Skywalker, knowing that he will eventually turn to the dark side.  It is a fine line to tread and a very complicated character to accurately portray; positive, yet negative, happy but brooding, peaceful yet disturbed etc.  In the end it would have suited the picture better to have a more experienced actor with a bit more depth to his acting.  And let us not forget, the original films were not exactly bastions of great acting.  As far as the other characters are concerned, I have come to the conclusion that Natalie Portman CANNOT ACT.  She gets praise and acclaim all the time and I have always given her the benefit of the doubt.  Until now.  Yes I'm sure it's hard to act in front of blue and green screens, but that aside, she's just terrible.  She is better here than she was in E1, but there she was abyssmal.  I hate to say it but it's true.  I don't see what is so great about her acting.  Here she was merely eye-candy.  Samuel Jackson does alright, but he alone can't save this film from its' mediocrity.  Ewen M. as Obi-won walks thru his part with all the fervor of someone suffering from somnombulism.  No real emotion whatsoever.  Count Dooku was the coolest character, but he's a bad guy.  Come on George, give us SOMEONE, ANYONE to cheer for.  Yoda's light-saber battle seemed tacked on and superfluous.  It's as if Lucas realized that there wasn't any one great scene in the film and put that in at the last minute.  It was cool to see, but I was sorely disappointed when it only lasted 15-20 seconds.  I figured Yoda was going to spend ten minutes wiping out the bad guys.  And the main battle is just over the top and ultimately disengaged me from the film.
The script was VERY dry and alternated among the following adjectives: boring, tedious, long-winded, unintentionally funny, and -on rare occasions- interesting and informative.  I think I laughed twice.  If you think I'm being too harsh you should read some reviews by the fans who LIVE by these films (you know them, they go to GENCON and dress up as Darth Vader).
To the DVD.  The DVD itself is great.  Great picture (totally digital), sound.  The extras are insane.  There are tons of them, and, like the last film, they are more interesting than the main attraction itself.  Episode Two is not any better than Episode One, but not any worse either.  It's just different and that's a shame.  George Lucas has lost whatever ability he once had to direct COMPELLING film(s).

The two young actors steam up the screen with an almost teenage romance, while previews of Darth Vader begin to appear.
Although the film centers on both the love story and the mystery unfolding about the notable Clone Wars, one of the greatest and almost unbelievable and comical scenes of all was Yoda, yielding a lightsaber, and taking on a fast-paced, kick-butt, scene with Lord Daku.  It was hysterical and just realistic enough to keep it from being cheesy.

A friend of mine told me it was much better than Episode I (which made me sleep for about 1 hr), but I see Ep. II exactly the same.
What happened to the George Lucas that created the first trilogy? I personally have no clue, but something did happen.

The Star Wars universe compares very favorably with any mythologies or fantasies I know, including JRR Tolkien's.  I'd indeed argue that Lucas's double trilogy is much bigger and far more interesting than all of Tolkien's books combined.  And the movies are also one level above anything contrived by Peter Jackson (although his films are entertaining in their own right).  I'd bet that if Tolkien were alive today to see Lucas's films, he'd be swept off his feet (or fall off his seat).  To combine grand mythology, science fiction, morality tale, and psychological drama in this perfectly balanced brew is too much for anyone even with Tolkien's brilliance to beat.  And the special effects are just state-of-the-art!

1317852,1,B00003CXKT,"Well, the disheartening decline of Star Wars continues on its steady march. How could something so awesome as the first movie (now 'episode 4') spawn such god-awful progeny? The first sequel (Empire Stikes Back) was tolerable. The second (Revenge of the Jedi), got pretty ridiculous with its way-too-cutesy muppet-fest, overly melodramatic love scenes and Luke at his whiniest; but, I could watch it without too much nausea. (My biggest complaint with this 'last movie in the series' is that I was hoping for a sophisticated climax to a major galactic political/military plot and all I get is another big explosion and the lead charaters dancing around with little teddy bears. What a let down!!)
Now the 'prequels' are coming out and so must the barf bags. In 'Episode 1'  we experience the real low-point. I get the feeling that these movies are being assembled based on the results of market research projects rather than someone actually trying to tell a story. Everything seems manipulated and calculated to push a certain button, pull on a particular emotional string, or appeal to a certain demographic (Jar Jar Binks as rasta dude for example). Most of the lead actors do a creditable job with the lame script they have been handed, but the pacing is uneven and the story line is muddled. The special effects are great, but great special effects are never enough of a crutch to save a truly bad movie.
Episode 2 solves some of the the pacing and story-line problem and takes the audience along for pretty fun ride on its simplest level. Perhaps the biggest problem here is the acting of the Anikin character and the dreadfully bad love scenes between him and Natalie Portman. They are truly awful. They are so bad that the audience in the cinema I first saw it in began audibly laughing. The actor who portrays Anikin is simply not up to the part. The others aren't too bad. But Anikin is the crucial character; and he is so bad that you feel sorry for him. Whoever made this casting decision should be taken out back and beaten.
But again, the deepest problem I have with this movie is the cynical and clumsy way it tries to manipulate the audience. Each scene seems to be guided by some kind of 'hollywood movie making formula' to elicit a particular type of reaction. The irony is that the formulae are wrong! I don't sense any real story-telling here at all. It's like it was constructed out of 'movie' lego-block parts. Snap the 'love scene' block together with the 'battle scene' block and the 'cute sidekick' block and you'll make x millions of dollars.
The first movie (episode 4) was art. It was heroic, epic storytelling on a grand scale. These latest movies have moved as far away from that as I can imagine. They are pure money-making machines designed to maximize the profits for as long as possible. You get the feeling they put more time into marketing the action figures and the promotions with Burger King than they did into making the movie.
Like millions of other people, I was absolutely blown away by the first movie (Episode 4). So I kept going to the sequels and prequels hoping that they'd recapture the magic -- only to be disappointed again and again and again.

I'm now too old to have this sort of reaction anymore, to any movies.  But I'm still a Star Wars fan.  Technically speaking, the difference between the originals and the new prequels is the difference between Stone Age and Iron Age.

1317856,4,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones gets off to a slow, albeit needed start. In other words, for an Action/Fantasy movie, ""Clones"" had to have a basis to bring you up to speed from the first movie to this one. The first 20-30 minutes will leave the casual viewer in the dark because of the backstory that needs to be told. That said, here's my take on the film from then on.
Anakin Skywalker was a gifted, God-fearing and wide-eyed boy in ""Phantom Menance."" Obi-Wan Kenobi, on the other hand, just semed to shadow his master Qui-Gon Jinn until the final battle with Darth Maul. Queen Padme' Amidala is now a Senator in the Republic and Jar-Jar Binks, well, he's just a passing character in this film with little screen time. However, Jar-Jar has one scene which turns the tide of what will be in Luke's world.
Obi-Wan has matured to the point of a Jedi Master training Padewan Anakin Skywalker who has become self-indulged in his own powers and love for Senator Amidala. Some reviews have called his character a joke, but maybe they're missing the bigger picture. This is the seed which turns the story into what will be in IV, V, & VI. I don't think a hulk-type like ""The Rock"" (Scorpian King) would have been the best choice to play an arrogant teenager.
Casual space opera/fantasy fans will be lost, as I said, but not disappointed as there is plenty of action, romance, and a sense of spirituality to this movie. Surely, it's the most intimate. If you noticed, I did call this a 'Space Opera"" and ""Fantasy"" because it is. Science Fiction it borders on in remote ways, unlike its rival ""Star Trek"" which uses a lot of real theoretical and factual basis.
What this movie exceeds on is the telling of the story. All the small things add up to the bigger picture, as I keep mentioning. That's what the plotline is all about. The visuals are outstanding and we finally see the power of the Jedi, what they did in the Old Republic, and the fierce warrior of Yoda alluded to in ""The Empire Strikes Back.""

Another thing that will make people happy is LESS JAR JAR!! I'm pretty sure there is an I HATE JAR JAR web site out there because when I find it, I'm joining it. Now with less Jar Jar, there's more getting to know other characters. Obi Won gets a lot more play in this one as a Jedi and Mase Windu also gets more screen time and he uses it very well.
Now here's the bad stuff. Anakin Skywalker is a whiny, complaining 2nd grader in a 20 year old's body. I believe Ani is supposed tp come off angry in most of his scenes but instead, Hayden Christenson makes him come off as a spoiled brat who can't get his way. Um, I think all of us know by now that Anikin Skywalker is Darth Vader and let's say it, can't no one mess with Vader. BUT Ani skywalker on the other hand, is a whiny punk. If they were looking to destroy character, they did it in Star Wars II with Anikin Skywalker. For those of you who hope Hayden Christenson is not in the next one, I'm with you too.
Also, how do you go from Sith Lord Darth Maul, who's hardcore as hell, is intmidating, vicious and totally awesome to, oh, some old guy? I'm sorry but Master Dooku was not a good transition from Darth Maul (as a main enemy in the final sequences). I will admit, at least the fight scene with Yoda made up for it. Bur how a lot of other things in the end sequences happened, I'm still trying to figure out (ie: why/how did Yoda get control of the Clone Army?).
But really, from a movie point of view, YES this is a good movie. Is it a great installment of the Star Wars series? NO, I don't think so just because that Attack of the Clones felt more like ""just another movie"" instead of part of the Star Wars epic saga like it should have. That and again, Christenson's inexperience on the screen REALLY SHOWS.
You should see this movie but after you do, throw in EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, just so you can feel clean again because for all of you hardcore Star Wars fans, Attack of the Clones will make you mad. And for those of you that are just in it for the movie, you won't be as disappointed but you will be annoyed by Anikin Skywalker.",1038355200,2,2540,4.133333333333334

THIS DVD however, Episode 2 : Attack of the Clones, is one of the greatest masterpeices ever made, second only to the Extended Version of Fellowship of the Ring. The Features are well worth the time spent viewing them and the sound quality is amazing. The video quality is UNRIVALED, as it was taken directly from it's source. This is due to the fact that Ep2 was filmed totally Digitally. So no conversion was needed.",1038355200,,538,4.444444444444445

There are 2 discs, the first DVD is the movie which has available an audio track of commentary by George Lucas and other big names in the production of the movie. This is great insight into the challenges, accomplishments and motivations behind the film. On disc 2 has a wide range of specials which cover behind-the-scenes information from many viewpoints and on diverse topics. The sheer number of items to view is impressive, and I have spent a day just watching different documentaries and featurettes. Disc 2 also contains a number of deleted scenes from the film, some of which are eye-opening in terms of some character's motivations, and all of which are preceeded by a short interview with Lucas or another Lucasfilm honcho.

In the end, this DVD and its predecessor for Episode I have spoiled me; few other DVD releases right now are doing what they are doing. Step up and grab this DVD!",1038268800,,1005,4.646067415730337
1318051,2,B00003CXKT,"The interesting thing is that I walked out of the theater thinking this was a four star movie, but when I bought the DVD and watched it again, the little nagging questions I had leaving the theater got bigger and I was left wondering what happened.  I agree with what a previous reviewer said about Lucas making the movie HE wanted, not necessarily what the short attention span audience wants.  That's what happened here.  The compelling back story to the wonderful original Trilogy is waiting to be told, but instead we are given endless action sequences that completely gloss over the story.  One example is why is someone trying to kill Amidala?  Ok so the Trade Federation wants to get her.  Ooh, nice motive.  Actually, in one of the deleted scenes, Amidala actually gives a speech before the Senate urging them not to create an army of the Republic.  Lucas' comment was ""Well, we needed to move things along, so we just cut it out""  Well George, moving things along you missed developing the story.  In the scene's place we have Jar Jar proposing that they create an army.  Huh?  I'm confused.
And that's not all.  The love story between Anakin and Padme seemed forced as well. I felt like it was the stormtrooper in Episode IV telling us to ""Move along"" ""Nothing to see here, keep moving""  Also, how does someone go from being a typical teenager to being the most nasty and evil guy in the galaxy?  The transition wasn't made in this film. I personally don't see how Lucas will be able to make this transition in Episode III.
The bottom line is that I am really disappointed.  This Trilogy had the potential to be greater than the first, alas George Lucas opted to take the same route that video game makers have taken.  Provide stunning visuals with little substance.",1038268800,3,1776,4.623003194888179

I love the way George uses irony in this one like in the romance scenes. I am amased why it gets so much negetive criticism. If you live yourself into the movie like a child you will like it. I think many watch it with a negetive mind and only see negetive things.,1038268800,,380,4.08

If you love Star Wars, you have already seen this movie and you loved it. We all were pleased with the new questions and answers that appeared throughout the film and there was more than enough action to keep us happy. There was also an event in this movie that will go down as one of the most memorable moments in modern history...Yoda takes out his light saber and what happens next I still can't quite put into words.
This is a must have DVD for the real Star Wars fans and we should all thank Georgie boy for coming through big time for us. He will not let us down in Episode III either and one day we will be able to watch I through VI in a single marathon, which will be something interesting.

""This movie is not a masterpiece. This movie will not move me. I will not like every character. In fact, I will hate one. This movie is not the work of a genius. I will learn nothing from this movie.""
Now, before you watch the movie, post the reminder above and behind your television. Correctly placed, you should see the sign whenever you roll your eyes at the dialogue, the acting- pick a flaw. When you catch glimpse of the sign, read it through. Take a deep breath, and hang with the movie.
In my mind, there is enough to see to reward a few viewings. The visuals are cutting edge. Clones' Yoda is the best CG character ever drawn, and gives the best acting performance of the movie. The CG settings are equally well done. The final war scene is visually excellent.
Beyond the graphics, you'd have to reach for slight praise. Jar Jar is all but gone. Natalie Portman's out of her Phantom Menace garb and looking well. Ewan MacGregor does all he can with what he is given. There is an interesting exploding effect. It is Star Wars. There are light saber battles, and umm...
...and, well, nothing. That's it. That is what you'll enjoy.
Beyond that, it is like sand. Rough and coarse, it gets everywhere. Not like you. Youre smooth.
Youll see what I mean. The movie will give a chuckle or two if you can take a step back and remember what you're looking at.",1038182400,2,1470,4.428044280442805
1318126,5,B00003CXKT,"Now lets get all the stuff aside about Revenge Of The Sith being better than Attack of The Clones. While many are quick to say that it is, it actually isn't. Sure ROTS has the most action sequences of all the Star Wars movies. But what it lacks is well balanced out story and better acting. AOTC takes place 10 years after The Phantom Menance ( still a very underated movie ). Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect Senator Amidala while Obi-Wan Kenobi is sent to find out the mystery behind the assassination attempts at the senator. What we find out in this chapter is the origins of the Storm Troopers and Chancellor Palpatine getting more control of the senate. Attack of the Clones is filled with enough action to keep you satisfied with the speeder chase through Coruscant, Obi-Wan Vs. Jango Fett, and the arena/clone war scene with Count Dooku played by Christopher Lee stealing the show with his performance. And yes, it is also a love story. The scenes between Christensen and Portman are not as painful as the ones seen on Revenge of the Sith. At least on AOTC, they are tolerable and somewhat believable. There is also the fantastic score by composer John Williams. With AOTC, he composes some of his best work and enhances the film even more with his dramatic compositions that really bring the film to life. AOTC will be remembered as one of the darkest, most colorful chapter of the series. While Revenge of the Sith was good, I found it to be more geared towards the younger audience despite the PG-13 rating. Characters like General Greivous, the hilarious looking Emperor, and Yoda looking more childish made it lack the darkness it was really meant to portray. With Attack of the Clones, George Lucas has created a wonderfully designed piece that will definately stand out when all is said and done. This is the true gem of the Star Wars prequels. Watch it again and see for yourself.",1038182400,,1903,4.666666666666667

1318129,5,B00003CXKT,"I enjoyed this movie alot more than the Phantom Menace.  Even the much maligned love scenes were decent.  This movie had the feel of the original Star Wars movies.  Especially the battles between Obiwan and Jango Fett.  After watching this one, I can't wait for Episode III.",1038096000,,274,4.76595744680851
1318130,4,B00003CXKT,"I have to admit; when this came out in the theater I was simply blown away, yet when I bought it on DVD last week and watched it again, I just didn't enjoy it as much. All the things I loved about this movie were still there, but something was missing all the same. To be fair, we really won't be able to pass full judgment on this movie until Episode III comes out in 2005 because only then will the double trilogy be complete, with all the loose ends tied up.
OK, what did I like about Episode II? Well, the action scenes and the visuals were simply stunning, and the acting was, overall, quite good. The story's not bad, what we have here is Anakin Skywalker in a transition phase, going from the likeable, innocent tyke of Episode I to a troubled teenage Jedi prodigy in this film who eventually becomes a monster by the start of Episode 4. George Lucas did not exactly take on an enviable task in creating a central character that his audience will grow to increasingly dislike, in fact, I heard him quoted as stating that Episode III will be so dark that even diehard fans will be shocked. At any rate, I thought Hayden Christensen did a fine job in this complex role; he is quite believable as a young Jedi fully aware of both his unique skills and his lack of maturity and wisdom. Of course, what makes him vulnerable to the Dark Side are exactly these qualities along with an excess of psychological baggage from a childhood spent with his mother in slavery. Her fate, and his reaction to it, make for the most powerful scenes in this film. Also, Ewan McGregor is solid as mentor Obi Wan Kenobi, and the two have great screen chemistry. Anakin both respects and resents Obi Wan who can be by turns helpful and proud yet also domineering and overcritical. And the supporting characters are good as well, especially those played by Christopher Lee and Samuel L Jackson.
What else works? Well, it certainly is thrilling. I bet Lucas got a lot of complaints about the slow pace of The Phantom Menace, so he made sure this film was much more energized. In addition to the climactic final battle scene that runs for a full half hour, there's a extended chase at the beginning on the galactic capital planet through a metropolis so vast it makes Manhattan look like a one horse cow town, a visit to a mysterious waterworld whose even more mysterious inhabitants are breeding a secret clone army, another visit to a desert planet inhabited by strange insect people who also are building an army, only of droids, and Obi Wan meets Jango Fett and his young son, Boba. In due time, Jango gets in not one, not two, but three separate fights with the Jedi, including a spectacular dogfight set in an asteroid belt. For the first time we get to see Jedi knights fighting in force instead of just single combat, in fact, by the end even Yoda gets to strut his stuff with a light saber. All this sounds like a recipe for great entertainment and, for the most part it is. So, why did I find myself not quite as impressed as I did at first?
Well, for starters, there's a few irritating details. Jar Jar is back, and as dumb and annoying as ever. Lucas did have the good sense to give him a much smaller role, but personally I think he missed a golden opportunity to win the gratitude of Star Wars fans everywhere by not simply including Jar Jar in the group of people killed in that opening blast. Just imagine the waves of cheering and applause that would have generated in theaters around the world! That aside, there's also the matter of the star-crossed lovers, Anakin and Padme. I'm probably in the minority on this, but I actually liked Christensen's performance. He really did act like a ""real"" teenager in love, which is to say, exactly like most of us were at that age, awkward and hopelessly tongue-tied. But Natalie Portman (whose performance I loved in Episode I) just seemed flat, like she was just reading from the script and not emotionally involved in the story. Finally, there's the musical score. For whatever reason, I just didn't like it nearly as much as in other Star Wars movies.
But those are nitpicks, my real problem is, to mangle an old metaphor; this film is a case of the parts being greater than their sum. Each of the scenes, planets, battles, etc., are individually great, but added together, does it make for a great film? I'm just not sure. One problem is that, with all the fast paced action scenes hogging the screen there's just not enough room for telling the story itself. Too many issues are glossed over, crucial questions such as why are so many planets wanting to secede from the Republic or where did the powerful Count Dooku come from and what motivates him. I wanted to learn more about the Sith and their vendetta against the Jedi, and, while it was nice to see Boba Fett's origins, I would have much preferred to have seen Han Solo's and Chewbacca's instead. And, finally, this film lacks the ""epic"" quality of the others, I think Lucas overcompensated by making it too fast paced, so that, instead of feeling like a true ""Star Wars` movie it comes off more as a good action thriller like, say, ""The Rock"" or ""Independence Day"". At least, that's how it seems to me now, like I said earlier, we'll have to wait until the series is complete to pass final judgment.",1038096000,17,5301,4.5
1318131,4,B00003CXKT,"After seeing Episode 2 in the theater, I thought to my self this movie is the best.  The reason that I thought that is because all of the Special Effects wizardry.

Did Lucas say ""forget plot, lets just focus on special effects,"" or did he dumb it down because he thought nobody would understand.  You decide.",1038096000,,417,4.294871794871795

He only makes faces, oh, of course, several teenager girls were hooked on him, as they are hooked on every single pretty face that is on the spotlight, what saddens me is that George Lucas used this guy NOT because of his talent as an actor (Unless he's blind and def) but because of his potential in forming a romantic pair. I couldn't help remembering what romantic pairs wrere all about in the times of Princess Lea, who was fortunate enough to act with Mr. Harrison Ford.

1318204,5,B00003CXKT,"AOTC is a must buy movie~ Perfectly moved to DVD and VHS. I believe the dialog and acting did not effect the movie's excellency at all. It is perfectly blended in with the splendid and dazzling special effects of any STARWARS movies. I think this movie brought all the elements of a good movie to the people. It had thrill, plot, conflict, mystery, love, climax, resolution, a little humor from C-3PO and R2D2, and the famous STARWARS saber-duel. How can anyone compare AOTC with movies created about 20 years ago?! It's a different time period with a different perspective! You can compare movies in the same time period because it is based on the same people watching and thinking but you cannot compare movies in a different time! If you loved IV, V, and VI, then watch it! Don't mock another movie that was made and criticized by people with a different way of mind! I believe AOTC was a great movie to understand the mystery behind Vader and Luke, and the CLONE WARS... the Emporer's rise... and everything else that created the world's most famous and greatest movie saga of all time: STAR WARS. AOTC is a MUST watch and buy. #1 all the way!",1038009600,,1147,4.572815533980583
1318205,1,B00003CXKT,"Okay-when comparing this movie to all other movies in the world, it's not really a one-star movie (maybe two, two and a half?). However, when judging the quality of the movie based on the time, effort, money, and energy that went into its production, then one-star may actually be too generous.
You really have to wonder what has gotten into the mind of Lucas. I can't fathom how anyone could look at the final cut of this movie and think ""wow, people are going to enjoy this."" That is, unless people enjoy poor dialogue, underdeveloped plots, and action scenes that are surprisingly boring. I didn't know that it was possible to have boring action scenes with state of the art special effects, but apparently I have been mistaken.
On the other hand, perhaps even Lucas knew that his film was going in the toilet, or else how do you explain the fact that in one of the climactic battle scenes Natlie Portman's shirt gets conveniently ripped to expose a bare midriff. Although, I have seen the ""bare Natalie"" action figures in the store, so that could be an alternate explanation. When Star Wars has to engage in tactics like this to keep the attention of the young male audience, we know something is terribly wrong.",1038009600,4,1216,4.660465116279069
1318206,3,B00003CXKT,"By now it's obvious to everyone, both sci-fi fans and casual movie goers, that the new Star Wars movies just don't measure up to the original trilogy.  There's something lacking in these next generation films...call it, depth.  It's too hard for me to push aside the underdeveloped characters, dialogue and story.  However, with this said, there's no denying that the richness of Star Wars' sci-fi quality remains intact with Episode II.  If you're hoping for lots of sound and fury, Attack of the Clones will NOT disappoint.
But let's get the bad parts out of the way first.  The romance aspect of AOTC's story didn't do anything for me.  It felt like a side story, and that's not what it's supposed to be!  Average dialogue with barely passable acting didn't help to convince me of the authenticity of Anakin & Padme's relationship.  In the end, I didn't know why Anakin loved Padme and vice versa, nor did I care.  I just wanted to see the next action scene.  Unconvincing characterization stays a problem throughout the movie, but it's forgivable.
The DVD edition of Episode II contains some great features.  Among these are deleted scenes which I believe add something to the weak character development of the story.  Unfortunately the scenes are on the 2nd disk, not the 1st which has the actual movie on it.  I take away points for Lucasfilm not allowing the viewer to automatically include these scenes in a full, uncut version of the movie.
C-3PO's presence was useless in the film.  I think the writers threw him in there just to appeal to the kids, what with his slapstick antics and immature puns.  There was a fairly amusing moment concerning him and a battledroid, but that's the extent of C-3PO's value in the movie.
The sound effects and music are quite impressive throughout the film.  Man, I loved the noise those seismic charges make when deployed!  Expert composer John Williams does the soundtrack for ALL the Star Wars movies, so expect high quality in that department.  I would've preferred the battle music to be a bit more riveting, but it's acceptable.  I'm happy to say the love theme for AOTC is far more romantic than the acting!
Special effects are where the Star Wars prequels shine.  AOTC does a good job of placing the viewer in it's fictional world of ultra-technology.  The special effects aren't just realistic, they're everywhere!  I don't think there's a single scene that doesn't contain an elaborate set design, outrageous alien makeup job or computer graphic of some sort.
The last 20 minutes of the film are laden with nonstop battles.  They are mesmerizing.  And for those who still haven't watched Attack of the Clones, know this; you haven't seen Star Wars until you've seen Yoda in a lightsaber duel.
Maybe, just maybe, George Lucas and his film team will get the 3rd and final Star Wars prequel perfect, and it will have some better substance to back up the incredible action.",1038009600,,2923,4.8

1318209,2,B00003CXKT,"Virtually plotless and often pointless, this installment in the fading franchise only underscores how Lucas's storytelling skills have apparently gone on permanent holiday. Much more lavish and pleasing to the eye than part I, 'Clones' does impress with its scenery, but that's all it really is: eye candy. The directing is atrocious, the story seems hopelessly limp and not the least bit compelling. A tip, George: the story need not be complex or even 'adult,'--just compelling and engaging.  The dialogue is even worse than Part I, and I thought nothing could top that. Hayden Christiansen is a big improvement over the previous Anakin (Jake Lloyd), and he does the best with the moronic lines he's given to read. I don't think he comes across as whiny...just impatient and impulsive; typical teen, and I'll buy a little bit of that. But he's also a jedi in training, so the character could have been written with a little more mystery and control. The future Darth Vader character does not remotely come across as a rash, impatient character, so Lucas is going to have to pull some serious mojo to make the transformation believable in the next flick, and to do that will require some major story-telling skill, and judging from the last two efforts, I can't see him pulling it off in a million light years. As for Natalie Portman, these Star Wars films are the only movies in which she comes across as truly awful. Truly, it's sad when, as a filmgoer, you actually *notice* that an actress appears bored to death by her leading role. She does not look like she is even remotely enjoying herself, or that she even feels present in the character of Amidala. MacGregor is fine, but again, with no compelling dialogue or purpose other than to roll his eyes at Anakin's teen impetuousness. The beloved droids (C3p0 and r2d2) serve absolutely no purpose other than to provide a sentimental bridge with the ""future"" or the ""past,"" or however one wants to look at it. They are useless in this film. Jar Jar binks, mercifully, was given brief screen time, but should have been assassinated. Sam Jackson as Windu is another utterly great actor trapped by lines so awful that he comes across as a complete stilted amateur. The subplot of Jango & Boba Fett was a neat attempt by Lucas to interweave the storylines from the ""future,"" but the ploy falls flat because the plotline is dull as dishwater and, in the end, we don't care that Boba cares that ""dad"" is 86'ed...nor do we care what grievances he might have in the future. It just adds to the ""throw anything up on the screen and see if it sticks"" method employed here. The only touching scene is Anakin's discovery of ""mom"" Shmi, but that whole subplot could have been given much more devotion and excitement, and really laid the groundwork for making us believe this kid is going to transmogrify into a character as chilling and controlled as Darth Vader. Impressive as always is Christopher Lee, but even he comes across as starch-stiff. You could see him relishing his role as Saruman in LOTR much much more than in this faux film. What is an improvement over 'Menace', as I mentioned, is the scenery--the digital wizardry is truly outstanding. Also improved is the drive and pace of the action sequences. Even though there is no plot or point or story, the action sequences seem to have a purpose, which is more than one can say for the disaster of Part I. The Yoda sequence, while now famous, was really anticlimactic. There wasn't enough sense of built-up drama in the confrontation between Dooko and Yoda to give the scene any real goosebump power. It's special simply because, well...we get to see Yoda twirling and whirling and using powers, which is something this character has never done too much. But simply seeing a character go ""out"" of character for surprise-value is not enough. With no story and the chopped-up, patched-together pacing, 'Clones' is another baffling disappointment. For crying out loud, Lucas...just write a great tale again, some short-but-clever lines for your actors, and let the effects serve your story, not vice versa. By the way, I do not buy Lucas's recent mumblings that these films should only be of interest to ten year olds. Sorry...too many people of all ages found the myth and magic of Star Wars to be valuable--too many for him to try and pass it all off now as some kind of kiddie cartoon.

1318212,1,B00003CXKT,"First, a little background on me.  I am 28 and grew up with the classic trilogy.  I loved them, and still do.  I own a lot of the original toys and cherish them.  With that said, this movie does not deserve to have the ""Star Wars"" name attached to it in any way.  It is horrible.  I see reviewers stating that the acting is a serviceable as ""Lord of the Rings"" is.  This is not true.  Hayden Christensen has some of the worst acting chops I have ever seen.  I laughed and this was not a good thing.  I laughed out of embarrasment for those involved.  My respect for George Lucas has has taken a second disasterous nosedive in a row, and this one, I am sorry to speculate, is almost certainly fatal.  Putting digital effects before the story is what Lucas likes to do best.  I actually felt sick to my stomach after watching this film.  This is not an exaggeration and I was surprised about it myself.  It was the effect of having something I truely passionately loved at one point in my life completely torn apart and killed.  Part of the problem is the lack of chemistry between any of the actors, romantic or otherwise.  The actors are not completely to blame, as seen through Lucas' eyes, the Star Wars universe now appears lifeless in almost every aspect.  If any chemistry did exist between the actors, Lucas had them do one more take to make sure none of it showed.  I guess he doesn't want real people stealing the show from the real star in his pictures, technology.  To bad he is so moronic where this is concerned.  By the way, I watched it on DVD the night after watching the special exetended DVD edition of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.""  LOTR is a masterpiece, and is to me now what Star Wars was as a kid.  It only goes to show how good Episodes I and II could have been, had Lucas only embraced them with the passion he once had.  The lightsabre battle, and Yoda's duel in particular held promise as concept, but are too fake, uninspired and filled with aural and visual overkill to be enjoyable.  I have pledged that I will never watch the third installment, but perhaps in two years my memory will have faded, and us true fans will all feel sick to our stomachs in unison, one last time.",1037923200,4,2227,4.321256038647343
1318213,5,B00003CXKT,"With Episode II, all of Mr. Lucas's troubles with Episode I are summarily and unreservedly forgiven.  An amazing bit of backstory to the classic movie we've all come to know and love.  Rejoice: Jar Jar is reduced to a minor supporting role, and all the comedic stuff is instead handled by Artoo and Threeepio, as is only right and proper.
Anakin Skywalker has evolved into one of the most multidimensional characters in visual science fiction.  Hayden Christiansen does a superb job striking a balance between Jake Lloyd's awkward 9 year-old and David Prowse/James Earl Jones's all-powerful Sith Lord.  An especially disturbing scene revolves around Anakin's nighttime encounter with a tribe of Tusken Raiders and its disturbing consequences --may be a bit intense even for 8 or 9 year-olds.  And talking of impending evil, another character that is developing in a fascinating way is Ian McDiarmid's Chancellor-cum-Emperor Palpatine.
For a change, the visuals aren't disracting from the storyline; we're actually taking the time to get to know these characters, and to worry about where they will go from here.  Like the middle episode of the first trilogy, ""Clones"" ends on a downer (and lays the groundwork for an even greater downer for Episode III).  My only regret is that Obi-Wan and Anakin do not have a lot of screen time together --one doesn't get a sense of a deep and abiding friendship that Obi-Wan will later mourn in Episode IV.
Bring on the final installment, Mr. Lucas.  You're back in storytelling mode and all is forgiven.",1037923200,,1541,5.015686274509804
1318283,3,B00003CXKT,"The biggest problem with ""Attack of the Clones"" is not a script with dialogue that doesn't trip off the tongue, a reliance on CGI settings or the actor playing Anakin Skywalker. The problem is that the movie simply doesn't know what it wants to be, or rather its creator didn't seem certain what he wanted it to be.
For better or worse, its predecessor ""The Phantom Menace"" felt like the movie George Lucas wanted to make. Whether you loved it, hated it or fell somewhere between like myself, you have to admit that there was a consistency of tone to the movie that identified it as ""Star Wars"" (with all the baggage that comes with it). ""Attack of the Clones"" throws that graceful, stately, mood out the window, hits the ground at a sprint and (for the most part) never lets up except for some romantic interludes that, while not as bad as some would have you believe, have nothing like the sparkle of similar moments in other ""Star Wars"" movies.
While the latter element means that ""AOTC"" is more viscerally exciting than ""TPM"", there's nevertheless something lacking. The surface flash is quite impressive, but (aside from the sequences on the water-world Kamino) it seldom evoked a real sense of wonder or put me in touch with that core of emotion that animates the best aspects of the saga.
Ultimately, we're left with a film where quiet and genuinely affecting moments, like Anakin's uncharacteristically mature realization that ""Life is much simpler when you're fixing things,"" sit uncomfortably next to gimmicks like Yoda's much-hyped light-saber duel. These two elements point up the true conflict of the film. The reflective moment shows a hint of the film Lucas really felt, while the second was the director trying his hardest to give fans the movie they wanted, seemingly losing touch with the fact that, as writer and director, it's his job to make the movie he wanted. There's enough here to give me hope that the next and final film could be the real treasure of the series. In the meantime, this uneven effort will have to suffice.",1037923200,,2048,4.771830985915493
1318284,1,B00003CXKT,"STAR WARS FANS ... WE'VE BEEN HAD !!!
This film has a murkey storyline, a poor script, unbelieveably bad dialog and hopeless acting.  I see no redeeming graces.  I think Lucus has probably burnt out and no longer has the creativity or motivation to produce a believable story.  And no, the digital age offers no magic in producing such.
This kind of film makes suspension of disbelief imperative.  It is difficult to suspend disbelief when the film maker confronts us with such a shoddy job.  The special effects, abundent here, must be especially well done.  Lucus has this big problem of rooting his special effect in some aspect of current culture which jars you right out of the future back into the present. I noticed it in  Phantom.  In Attack, it was the diner scene with waitresses on wheels and four armed cooks.  This was the point where I lost all interest in anything Lucus will make in the future.  I resent the money I wasted on Phantom and Attack and only wish he would finish this confounded travesty so Episodes IV-VI can be issued on DVD.",1037923200,4,1056,4.598930481283422

This film not only blows Episode I out of the water, it blows ALL previous Star Wars films (and many other action/sci-fi/adventure) out the wate.  Oh, this film will DEFINATELY get repeat viewings and will make a TON of money.  I don't care about it breaking box office records, all I cared about is being personally entertain and I was.

Let me be the first to say, do not be surprise to see this film get nominated for best picture.  I am dead series.  Hey if they nominated Lord of the Rings, they should nominate this picture.

1318286,1,B00003CXKT,"I have a confession to make- I liked episode one.  Maybe it was because I was only 14, or maybe it was because if I had never seen Ep. 1, I would have never heard of Ewan Mcgregor, a personal favorite of mine.  I wasn't even annoyed by JarJar, until the media started screaming 'We hate JarJar!' at the top of their lungs.  It wasn't a movie that had to be made, but it was good enough.
But then came Ep. 2, attack of the clones (worst. title. ever.), a movie so bad, I was actually EMBARRASSED by what was on the screen.  I assumed things would improve after the jaw-droppingly bad first 20 minutes (a murder mystery in Star Wars?), but it just went downhill from there.  I had heard good things about Hadyn Christiansen (sp?) in ""Life as a House"", which I never saw, but he was ALMOST the worst actor on the screen. I could tell he was going for emotion, but everything sounded way off.  But let's give credit where credit is due.  Nothing was worse than Natalie Portman. Nothing. She didn't even try to show emotion.  I can't blame them completely, the dialoge was laughably bad, but at least try!
I spent most of the movie looking foward to the Obi Wan sceens, not just to see Mcgregor, but to get the embarassingly bad romantic cleshays (no clue how to spell it, went for phoneticly)as far off the screen as possible. I actually thought that the Obi Wan scenes were pretty borring.  Some of the action was fun, especially in a theatre full of Star Wars nuts, but it lacked the emotional undertones the action scenes in the other movies. Even Ep. 1 had that moment when Obi wan attacked Darth Maul in a fit of rage, avenging the death of Qui-quan-gin,  but in episode 2, Obi wan doesn't even seem phased when he sees Anikin's missing arm.  Plus, the fights look like chorigraphed fights.  Finally, on a lighter note, in the scene where Anikin has a nightmare, did anyone else MOMENTARALY think that something all together diferent was going on there?  Come on, he's sweating, his hands are under the covers, he's tossing and turning.  I actually turned to my sister and asked, 'Can they do that in a PG movie?'  Judging by the laughter, I think the whole theatre agreed with me.

1318287,2,B00003CXKT,"Try as I might, I can not come up with a compelling reason to endorse this movie. I purchased the DVD with the expectation that because the film was shot digitally, the film would even look better than it did in theaters. While the film is a remarkable achievement in special effects, it is not much more.
At the heart of this film is the complete one dimensional nature of Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen). The entire purpose of this trilogy was to tell the story of the transformation of Anakin Skywalker to Darth Vader. Episode I, while imperfect, showed promise. Young Anakin was a confident and charismatic figure. However, in Episode II we find a character who is completely unengaging.
I expected to find a suave, handsome, swashbuckling Anakin whose outward charms hid a troubled psyche. Instead, from scene one we get a sniveling, spoiled adolescent whose narcissism makes me wonder why he wasn't booted from the Jedi order long before this movie takes place. As a result, there is no way I can believe the relationship with Padme Amidala, I feel no sympathy for him after the death of his mother and I am left with little mystery about how this character will make the transition to Darth Vader.
I will wait with anticipation for Episode III, but clearly the bloom is off the rose of this story. What I will be excited about is the release of the original trilogy on DVD and will see to it that it becomes a center piece of my collection.",1037836800,,1453,4.635658914728682

Sadly the Star Wars franchise has really been going down the toilet since Return of the Jedi (can we say Ewoks, Jar jar, and now, Hayden Christiansen??)

She's that bad.  So is Hayden Christiansen, where did they find this guy?  The romance scenes between the two are terrible, I've seen animals on the Discovery channel that generate more chemistry with each other.
The movie is also terribly boring until the last half hour or so when the action begins to kick in.  And then there is the famous Yoda fight.  I am not sure what lucas wanted with this, but everyone in the theater was laughing hysterically when this happened.  Not laughing because it was cool, but laughing because it was so stupid!!  By the way, Lucas should be ashamed of himself, has anyone seen those ""who da man?"", ""yoda da man"" commercials?? ick.

I think it is definitely better then Phantom Menace though.
The acting is trite and the dialogue stilted in some scenes. (I was not impressed with the choice of actors for Anakin though I love Natalie Portman as Amidala.) But then again, George Lucas is known for his incredible effects, not written dialogue. The effects of course are phenomenal, as is to be expected. There are some fabulous fight scenes, especially the one with Yoda. He rocks! I've been dying for a Yoda fight scene since I first discovered him in the original trilogy and Lucas comes through for his fans.
I wouldn't buy this movie in the hopes of some scene-stealing performances for Anakin, (See, that shows how impressed I was with him, I can't even remember the actor's name!) but I was satisfied with the other characters.

To any StarWars fan, this is a must have.
Most of the extras of the DVD can be viewed at their offical website, but it was still cool.  The deleated sceanes were awsome, and the audio commentary is always fun to listen to.
The only ""complaints""(i truly have none) i have about this movie is that they change scenes a lot, whereas the old movies used to be mostly half on one planet, and half on another.  This was required though, in order to progress the movie along in a logical order.  Also, it seems that this movie reflected a more modern fasion style at the height of the republic, before the times of the emperor.
George added three things that were different then other StarWars movies.
1) The movie revolves around a love story, whereas the other movies contained short scenes.
2) They included a big jedi battle scene, which was cool to see them all fighting together.
And
3) This movie was the first i have seen to actually contain a little humor (Yoda!).
The detail they put into the CG yoda, was incredible.  On the second DVD, they have extras about creating the ""visual"" effects(Computer Graphics), and they show the time and detail they put into this movie.
The music is always to die for, and depicts this movie as a true epic.  Just as in all the other StarWars movies and Harry Potter movies, John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra where great.

I've heard the jokes that Mr. Lucas is making up the story as he goes, but so what, with AOTC, it is all coming together (I saw ANH 3 times in the theatre when it FIRST came out).  I was fairly disappointed with 'Phantom Menace' (too cheesey and childish with Jar Jar Binks), but was glad to see Jar Jar had only 5 to 10 minutes on screen time now.  I am a true fan of the original Star Wars movies, and have been waiting a long time to see the prequels (even if the first one was below par).  I, unlike other reviewers, am interested in how Darth Vader came to be, why Leia and Luke were seperated at birth, what the Jedi's did in their slow time, and unbeknownst to me (up until 'The Phantom Menace' or 'Attack of The Clones') why Jabba the Hut is the bad-... that he is/was.
The acting, as other reviewers have said is ""wooden"", but that's not the point.  The point is the story as a whole, from 'Star Wars I The Phantom Menace' all the way through to 'Star Wars VI Return of the Jedi' (besides, even though I liked the originals, all the acting was ""wooden"")

As bad as the acting is, the special effects are worse. Why does Lucas even pretend to make this stuff look real? Nothing looks believable, especailly Yoda. One can find better and more believable graphics on a Playstation game.
However, the bonus stuff save the DVD as a whole. There are a ton of documentries, many featuring clips and scenes from the first 3 movies in the series. Note--If the clips of the other movies are on DVD then why aren't they available to the genral public to buy??

1318366,3,B00003CXKT,"""Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones"" and its immediate predecessor, 1999's ""Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace"", provide ample proof that more is not necessarily better and that excess is no way to improve upon a concept. Each of these movies cost over $100,000,000 to make. Employed were the finest animators, set designers and computer graphics wizards that money can buy. Yet, if these talented artisans are all the king's man and all the king's men, then certainly these movies are Humpty Dumpty.
Flashback 25 years: A young George Lucas begs 20th Century-Fox for enough money to complete ""Star Wars"". He has to use all his ingenuity to cobble the movie together from reused sets and dinky miniatures. Necessity once more proves to be the mother of invention. The film goes on to become a gigantic hit. The next movie in the series, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" has a much larger budget, which Lucas uses wisely. It's not only another winner but also a better picture. Then comes ""Return of the Jedi"", which shows signs of bloated budgets and egos. It's the weakest of the three.
In many ways, ""Clones"" is an improvement over ""Phantom"". Some of the computer generated images are breathtaking. Much of the time, the actors blend in seamlessly with these images, though occasionally, the live characters obviously become computer images themselves. Yoda is given freedom of movement he did not have before. The story is more interesting and coherent than the one in ""Clones"".
The movie's big failures are in two areas. The dialog is pathetically weak, so much so that it's hard to relate to the human characters, especially when the few good lines belong to a robot. And the technological `miracles' eventually overwhelm the film. As in ""Phantom"", the filmmakers are diverted by gadgets. This makes the movie preposterously loud and filled with overly busy screen images - objects fly and whiz around only because the engineers and animators can make them do so. Things go bang just because they can. The viewer's eyes and ears go into overdrive trying to assimilate all this information.

On a film note, the sequence in which Dooku and Anakin battle in the dark, colors dancing on their faces, playing off the inner evil and weakness of both characters, bookended by their almost dance-like movements moments before Dooku ""dis-arms"" his opponent, is easily the most masterful directing in any of the Star Wars films.

This one has a long tangled story that just feels thrown together to kill time before the inevitable occurs in Episode 3. Boba Fett's (hideously wooden) father making clones of himself, the most cringeworthy love scenes commited to DVD (frollicking on a hillside with giant hamsters) and a whole host of small pointless characters (those badly dubbed trade federation Asians, Count Dooku, an army from A Bug's Life, long-necked alien cloners who live in an airbrushed world straight from a Yes! album sleeve etc.)
The action scenes seem forced too, especially the Gladiator meets Sinbad Colesseum battle with a giant crab, a bull and a Tasmanian Devil. The whole 'robot factory' scene just doesn't look or feel right, when C3-PO gets whisked away by a mechanical arm it just smacks of some late night MTV video for some French disco dance band.
Hopefully Lucas will throw Jabba into the next one. Jabba and IG-88, the mental short-circuited killer droid.
Lastly, Boba looked cool. Then he got nudged into that Carkoon pit thing. Sheesh, what a stupid way to go. Now in this one, Jango looks as cool, and then stands there like an idiot while someone lops his melon off.
I mean, let them go out in a blaze of glory!",1037577600,6,1313,4.688311688311688
1318464,5,B00003CXKT,"I'm not gonna go into the plot, Yoda, or clone armies, because there's probably enough people who do that, what I want to say is a bit different.
This movie adds something to the Star Wars story as a whole, something that was missing and that I think it needed. After I saw Episode 2 in the theatre I watched the original three again, and I found myself having a completely different reaction at the end of Return of the Jedi (I won't say what scene exactly because I wouldn't want to give anything away in case someone out there hasn't seen it, and those of you who have seen it probably know what I mean). I'll admit it, I cried. The scene itself is the same, of course, and yet it was completely different. Having the story of Episode 2 and what had happened to Anakin completely changed how I feel about Darth Vador and the ending of Return of the Jedi. This makes me wonder if when I watch Return of the Jedi again after Episode 3, will I be completely devestated?
I definitely recommend watching Episode 2 and then watching Return of the Jedi again (or, if you've not seen the original movies, watch those first, then episodes 1 and 2, then watch Return of the Jedi again).
I know people put the new Star Wars movies (episodes 1 and 2) down for various resons, but I think people fail to remember that the original Star Wars movies are far from perfect. I think people love Star Wars so much that they expect it to be more than it is, and then when it's just Star Wars (wonderful, flawed Star Wars), they're disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Star Wars and I think the originals and both of the new ones are wonderful, but they are, all of them, flawed. Wonderfully so. That sounds strange, I know, but I love Star Wars even for it's flaws. :-)",1037577600,,1756,4.308157099697885
1318465,5,B00003CXKT,"I'm a great fan of Star Wars since the first movie in 1977. Sci-Fi lovers and young viewers -at that time- has become loyal subjects to it! For them, this movie is a wonderful piece of the long galactic epic which they loved since they were young. New comers to Satr Wars might join those loyal subjects if they like the earlier movies. Aside from the visual side, which brings the BEST of visual technology in cinema industry, you may not apprteciate Episode I or Episode II, as it should be, if you haven't first seen and enjoyed the earlier triology.
For me as a Star Wars fan, Episode II is a real feast. It provides all what I expected to have in term of story build up, excitements, visuals, actions, and nostalgic link to the original triology.",1037577600,,751,4.449275362318841
1318466,4,B00003CXKT,"Ever snce I saw Episode I back in 1998, I've been a HARD-CORE Star Wars buff. Especially Jar-Jar Binks--as I had never been a Star Wars person before then, he was the first thing that got me into the movie. I just thought ""Whatever the rest of the movie is like, he's cute!"" Of course, it turned out to be one of the best things that ever happened to me, considering how much of a fan I am now.
I was ecstatic to see Episode II after waiting for two years, but I was not as satisfied as I feel I should have been. For my birthday as an early present this year, I purchased the DVD, hoping that maybe I had just been overly-critical in the theater.
Good news or bad news first? I'll start with the good.
The good parts of Attack of the Clones are GOOD parts--the arena scene (with all those rockin' Jedi), Kamino and the inhabitants (I love their eyes), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and the Yoda-Count Dooku lightsaber duel,and many others as well. I found that though I loved the puppet Yoda more profusely, the CGI one works just fine with me--he is still Yoda! And the extras on the second DVD are wonderful. Many behind-the-scenes features opened my eyes to really how MUCH work they do for Star Wars. Seeing how much they used blue-screen as well made me appreciate and look up to the actors more--it takes skill to stare at something that isn't there and talk to it and be convincing!
The bad:
I have to say, also, like countless others before me: The romance was AWFUL. I always admired Padme in Episode I--she was a spectacular leader at only 14-years-old, and she was mature and cool when put in a hard place. But now--instead of maturing as I hoped she would, it seems that Padme Amidala has digressed, becoming childish, reckless and impulsive, more of a spoiled child than a senator. But Anakin is even worse--he disobeyed Obi-Wan at every turn and says such wooden lines as 'It's not fair!"" and ""Obi-Wan is jealous!"". Frankly, I thought, the WORLD is not fair--grow up! He was overly childish and a horrible whiner, and his acting was very wooden in certain spots, entirely hard to believe. Some of the love scenes get entirely painful--the dialogue is just horrible (I've never heard worse proclaimations of love) and their actions make you want to give them a good smack.
Another thing--how did Padme suddenly turn into the Britney Spears of the Star Wars galaxy? Almost all of her clothes (except for a few choice lovely ones) are mid-riff bearing, and the black-corset thing!? Let's just say she needed it to cover a little more of her skin. I really looked down on this--whoever designed the wardrobe should have though of the effect it would have on young girls. I think it's really important for Star Wars to stay the way it was, clean and right and with no unnecessary sexual indication.
It disappointed me, to say the least, but I still think that the parts that are good are true Star Wars moments. It's quite easy to just fast-foward through the gooey love scenes anyway. ;D",1037577600,,2999,4.535055350553505
1318467,2,B00003CXKT,"OK, so this is a grown up point of view, adn it may be too much to expect that the producers can satisfy kid AND adults, even adults weaned on star trek.  BUT REALLY -- the young actors were very unskilled, Anakin mostly seemed like he was embarrased by his lines (a reasonable response) and to be fair, is probably much too young to carry a transition from good guy to bad guy at all convincingly (he could have used some help from the writers).  The plot was probably there before the left most of it on the cutting room floor. The force is hardly ever talked of or used, and Yoda at one point alludes to the diminishing power of the Jedi -- this would have made a great plot element, whay was it not developed?
Over all, too many special effects, too little story.",1037577600,4,767,4.2465753424657535
1318546,5,B00003CXKT,A must have for any Star Wars fan! I would have loved it if they added an extra DVD since they will be including a lot more features on StarWars.com which they could not fit into the 2 DVDs.,1037577600,,190,3.8974358974358974
1318547,1,B00003CXKT,"wooden. contrived. shallow. boring. embarassingly unfunny, and completely unmemorable.  C-3PO's line ""this is such a drag""  pretty much sums up my feeling about ""Clones"".  In terms of why I didn't enjoy Lucas' latest effort, there isn't much I can add to previous negative reviews.  I only bothered to write so I could pass along that I read an extremely enlightening interview with Gary Kurtz, the producer that worked closely with Lucas on ANH and ESB.  Its at [...]  The interview is fairly long (5 parts), and it doesn't deal exclusively with Star Wars, but a large part of it does.  Kurtz shed considerable light on why Epsiodes I & II - and to a lesser extent ROTJ - had a different tone than the earlier films.  He confirms what most of us already knew, that Lucas has only ""yes-men"" around him, he is not good at directing actors, and he cares very little for a compelling plot or character development - but he illuminates why, at least in part, that's the case.
George loves his digital cameras and his CG effects, but he doesn't love Star Wars anymore, and it shows.  If he could replace every breathing human in Star Wars with a CG alien he would, just to say that he did it. Here's hoping against hope that he will come to his senses and listen to someone with better instincts than he does for Episode III.  Yeah, right.  It will make money, just as I & II did, but it won't inspire the imaginations of the next generation for years to come.  Other, better films, made by passionate, more interesting people will do that for me, George.",1037577600,6,1550,4.516129032258065
1318548,4,B00003CXKT,"I love the Star Wars movies.  But in comparision between the first trilogy and this one, the first blows this one away( so far).  The reason is simple, we already know the end result of the prequal trilogy, Anakin becomes Vader.  Now it is interesting to find out how he turned but there is no mystery in it.  It is going to happen.  In the first trilogy we didn't know where it was going ,so we went along for the ride.  And were surprised along the way.  Plus the story was on a smaller scale, and yes less special effects and more story development
Now in saying all that the only thing I really found wrong with  ""Clones"", was the way Lucus treated the romance, between Padme and Anakin, it seemed rushed and fake.  Now I know why, in the DVD the have the deleted scenes that you can view.  Over Half the scenes build the relationship and romance between the two.  Which I feel is very important in the story.  But Lucus decided to streemline for time and action purposes.  In doing that he really neglected the heart of the story, Anakin's and Padme's love for each other.
Plus I think both The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter series remind us of what the Star Wars series used to be, a place we can get lost in.  But I think Eps. III will be the best and darkest of the prequals.",1037577600,,1288,4.225409836065574
1318549,4,B00003CXKT,"I was not particularly eager to see the latest installment in the Star Wars saga and it seems that my lack of enthusiasm was appropriate. Despite the ludicrous speeder chase on Coruscant, the story was rather slow moving at first, much in the same vein as ""Pearl Harbor"" (excessively sappy romance until the war finally starts). I've not seen actor performances so stilted since my high school musicals - there's better acting in pornos, quite frankly. Hayden Christensen vainly attempts to be the poor man's James Dean and should end up like Mark Hamill - a washed up icon earning rent by doing cartoon voices. The only worthy actor in the whole cast in Christopher Lee, and he's 80. And who wrote those lines? Some of them are just downright bad - cliched and lame. The editing is particularly weird - an unusual juxtaposition of brief scenes that don't always mesh together well. You don't always have time to appreciate the scenery, costumes, and sets because it changes so quickly (and not in the good, fast-paced sort of way). John William's usual musical exuberance is noticeably absent - the soundtrack's best parts are derivative of his scores for the other Star Wars films. As for the plot, it was interesting enough and not as predictable as I was expecting. But without a thorough knowledge of the whole series, the casual moviegoer might be confused and will totally miss a slew of connections and references. Of course, you're not supposed to notice any of these shortcomings because the special effects are incredible. But everyone expects that anyway, so I'd rather see better character development.
George Lucas is slowly losing it, but at least he had the good sense to cut N*Sync out of the final product. While this is better than ""The Phantom Menace"", it's still not as accomplished when compared to the original trilogy. I think it's so easy to be critical because Lucas sets himself up for it. ""Clones"" is enjoyable when all is said and done, but only because of the visual elements. Having said that, there's still more style than substance. Still, there are worse ways to spend two and a half hours (and several more with all the DVD extras).",1037577600,,2167,4.7967914438502675
1318550,2,B00003CXKT,"This movie was a big, thrashing, mess of a thing, and pretty darned boring. No, it isn't that the political intrigue is confusing -- actually that plot arc is pretty simple, with the Emperor-to-be manipulating a military crisis in order to be given emergency powers. (Anyone familiar with Roman history would ""get"" that, anyway.) The problem is that George Lucas has lost all sense of human scale, so the frenetic action has no tension to it at all. It's a spectacular thing, to make such amazing special effects dull to watch, but Lucas manages it handily.
An example: When Obi Wan zooms into an asteroid field, Jango Fett releases ""seismic charges"" that spread through the field wiping out all the asteroids. Cool visual elements, and a great sound effect. Obi Wan -- zoom -- just barely avoids each detonation. So what? We have no sense of tension, because everything in these last two movies has been like this: chaotic, obviously-impossible-to-evade problem, but the hero just barely gets away. It doesn't matter if it was the fish in Naboo's ocean, or these asteroids, or one of the enormous, impossible-to-understand battle scenes, or the flying car ""chase"" -- the good guys just escape, and the escape isn't really even understandable. You don't have the sense that Han and Chewbacca are struggling to put together their hyperdrive on the fly, or that they've got to get to a certain point before they can engage it safely, or anything like that; it's just bang, whoosh, another hair-raising getaway. The most important part in a movie like this is the anticipation, the way the audience figures out what the characters are trying to do and roots for them. In these latest Star Wars installments, we don't get any of that. We never see what the characters are trying to do, we just see them bounce around doing physically impossible things until we don't care any more. Add to that the whole ""He can't die, Alec Guinness has to play him later"" thing, and it's even duller.
Also, isn't it too bad the effects have gotten so much more gigantic that we can't even see the characters lots of the time? We end up looking at these gargantuan CGI battles, and not even knowing where the characters are. We see a Republic gunship blow up -- was that theirs? No, of course not. Oh, there they are, waving their light sabers and standing in the midst of things vaguely fighting someone or other. There are so many blaster bolts flying around that nobody can see who's shooting at whom, even. Hoop-de-doo.
When there is some personal element, some setup for dramatic tension, it's totally arbitrary. You could build a nice little cat-and-mouse chase around something like Obi Wan trying to get a warning message off to the Republic from enemy territory. Instead he just stands outside his ship, which he's parked out in the open right next to enemy headquarters (!), and he talks clearly into the mike -- oops! he got caught. How dumb is that? C'mon, you could at least try to develop some tension, you know?
Toss in maybe 50 completely idiotic actions by the characters. Here comes the climactic duel -- oh, no, Anikin is acting like a bonehead again. The Jedi, deep thinkers that they are, seem not to have figured politics out beyond the ""We shouldn't really trust politicians"" phase, so ""Let's keep a closer eye on the Senate"" amounts to a revelation for them. Wow. That's leaving alone the decision to try to rescue Obi Wan and Anikin and Amidala: Okay, so Palpatine has been appointed temporary dictator to combat this enemy army the Republic can't deal with, because the Jedi aren't an army and can't fight... so the Jedi all go off to fight the enemy army? Did that make any sense at all?? Then, during the big battle, they've supposedly cut off communications for the bad guys... only they haven't thought of having any ships above the planet to prevent people escaping, because Dooku just flies right away at the end, no questions asked. So very bad.
What a complete, utter mess. I'm giving it two stars because my kids laughed when Yoda started hopping around. Otherwise this is a waste of a lot of talent and special effects, and of two hours of my life. Well, at least I got some ironing done during, and we had some popcorn.",1037577600,19,4235,4.70121130551817
1318551,5,B00003CXKT,"Best Star Wars yet, minus the bad acting by ""Anakin"" in this movie, plus a lil ierd running by ""Mace"", but the battle between Yoda and that Sith dude, Count Dookuu, makes it all worth it for sure.",1037577600,,196,4.184210526315789
1318552,4,B00003CXKT,"I was undecided when I first saw this movie. Could be that it was midnight and I didn't go to bed until four in the morning. But after watching the DVD five times this weekend with my three year old son, I have grown quite fond of it. Like Episode I(which I saw three times within 24 hours of its theatrical release) , it took a while to grow on me. I have to say that this movie is a really fun action-packed ride. Sure, the acting was wooden and the dialog was corney, but I think too many people my age(30-something) look at the original trilogy through rose-colored glasses. When the new movies don't live up to thier unrealistic expectations, they go nuts and trash the movie. Too much vitrol in a lot of these reviews.
The DVD package is really nice. Use the OPTIONS.10+.1.1.3.8 trick to get to the bloopers on disc 1. Since this is the first straight digital DVD, it looks great. The sound is first class as well. Watching it with the sound cranked in DTS was really cool. The CG stuff is eye-poping, though some of it(C3PO in the droid factory)looked less polished. Disc 2 has all kids of documentaries and trailers. This DVD is lots of fun and well worth the price.

1318553,4,B00003CXKT,"OKAY....Honestly...All of the Star War's purist (including me) should take a seat for these first 3 episodes. Unfortunately, they are not meant for us. I have watched all of these movies repeatedly, including the ""original"" trilogy. TPM, AOTC, and up and coming Ep. III are meant for the younger generation of today.
I recently took a moment to watch Ep. IV-VI in its entirety, both in widescreen and in regular format. They encompassed the acting and the skill of the time for the format (and I do mean Sci Fi). The FX also encompassed the best of it's time. Today, there is something new. We all have to accept this. GL is on something new. If you ask me?...Which none of you will. I would like to see GL create a new Ep 1-6, including all of the CGI of today.
SW is of the past, and SW of the future is built on something entirely different. Those who judge it on past behaviour are wrong and those who judge it on new behaviours are wrong. GL is faced with something that many directors never encounter. The question of how to please the ""old"" and the ""new"". It is a tough question. I think he has accepted that none will be please, but all we be glad to see.
This movie is not the best. Aside for the FX, it will not win an academy award. GL will not win best director. SW will not win best movie. OKAY...not that it is said lets get to the movie's finer qualities.
I love the Yoda scene. SW purist have been waiting for it. Young SW fans will be glad to see it. I like the whole Bounty Hunter plot. SW purist are a little put off by it...(wanting to see more of Boba), but Young SW fans will understand. ""I"" like the Anakin & Padme marriage at the end. SW purist ""should"" love it, and SW young fans should love it too.
Basically it all boils down to this. If you love SW then there should be something that you like or love about this movie. If you dont' like SW, then you will hate this movie. All reviewers who are looking for greating plots or extreme dialouge should click other buttons. This is a SW Movie. There isn't great acting. The FX is great for the time, and the movie is about the sub culture we exist in.

1318554,1,B00003CXKT,"Since George Lucas has got the power of CGI, he tends to overuse it everywhere
and seems to forget what really drives a story: the plot and the actors.
Episode 2 suffers from the same weakness as Episode 1 - cheesy dialogs,
pathetic scenes, weak actors and FX at all cost.
Warning: Some spoilers may arise, but you can't be surprised by this movie.
Watching this movie is like playing a computer game with a fantastic
graphic. I got bored by the love scenes and angry by the silliness of
some acting of the main characters: Why the hell didn't the Jedis use
their force the open the handcuffs in the arena, but Amidala used her hairpin to open it
(what great and new idea) - just wondering why they enemies used force fields
to lock up the Jedis, but enchained them with mechanic handcuffs...
Then the sequence in the factory while they jumped around to escape
the assembly line - it reminded my of SuperMario Bros. and was totally unnecessary!
It seems to be the law of Lucas that Jedi have strong powers but can't use them
when they need them.
The biggest laugh was the scene with Anakin's mother: what a terrific
coincidence that she stayed alive for a month after being tortured -
long enough for him to find her - just to die in his arms right away...
Then he kills all the sand people, men, women, children and returns
to his beloved Amidala. He tells her his dirty deed
which makes her to love him even more...
How romantic: He: 'Darling, just found my mother dead
and killed every single person in the sand people's village'.
She: 'Oh, Any, I love you so much... you poor boy had to kill
everything there; let's make a baby for Episode 4.
But first get married at the end of Episode 2,
because this is a G-rated movie'.

Or how about Princess Leia upon getting rescued; ""Aren't you a little short for a Storm Trooper?"" and another great, masterpiece line when she confronts Darth Vader; ""Only YOU would be so bold as to attack a diplomatic star ship!"" And of course, I wouldn't really consider it fine acting, or even fine scripting, when Luke (Mark Hamille) finds his aunt and uncle who raised him as charred black skeletons and basically shrugs it off, forgetting all about them in about 5 minutes, but then freaks out when Ben Kenobi dies even though he knew him for about 15 minutes (during which time he learned all about the Force). Let's face it, dialogue and acting are no better in ANH than in Episodes II, in fact I would dare to say that AOTC dialogue and acting is actually an improvement. I take Hayden Christensen's amazing expression of anger and hatred as he carries his dead mother back home over Mark Hamille's whining any day. But nobody here complains about ANH, ranting on and on about some nonsense of the ""magic"" of the originals, when in truth the 12 year old in you is dead and now looking at the same material as a 30+ year old, you refuse to admit that what you once loved you can't, or don't, anymore. Episode II, in my opinion, was excellent. Star Wars has NEVER been about acting. It has always been about plot, action, and special effects, and it does those superbly. One critic who gave the movie 1 star complained about the clone army that the ""writer's"" conveniently tossed in to save the good guys in the end. Duh! Did this person not even understand what this movie was about? Did he not understand that both Chancellor Palpatine and Count Dooku purposely set up both the clone army AND the droid army in order to start a war so that Palpatine could gain emergency political powers, which he later manipulates to make him emperor?

I still think the jokes made that George Lucas writes these Prequels as he goes is true, and the simple fact that he is actually going to end up having to redo parts of the original three movies is irritating to say the least.  I say it's all about money plain and simple.  Did anyone actually care about the storm troopers?  Why would you, and come to think of it, why would they even need officers in a clone army, it just didn't make sense and the story dragged and dragged.

1318686,4,B00003CXKT,"I feel that this movie places its self at the # 3 spot after Empire Strikes Back! The 5th installment takes us more into the dark side of the force and introduces us to what becomes the springboard for Skywalker to dive into evil. As much as I like this film, there is a beef and I will get into it later. You are probably reading this review because you are pondering the thought of buying this DVD and you want some food for thought to help. Let me help steer you in the right direction, buy this DVD!! If you are a home theater owner, this will be one of the flicks you'll bring out to demo you system, and if you are the rainy day, cuddle up in front of the TV with a good flick type, this will also suite you. The story take us 10 years from episode 1 and young Skywalker is now a young man who is going through what most kids his age go through; he's brass, rebellious, flirtatious and curious. What makes him different is, he's one of the most gifted Jedi's to take up with the order. Like other gifted children and young adults, he needs the proper guidance to help cultivate his talents to their truest. The problem is, he has pentad up anger and deep inside the ""cocky"" Jedi, is a frightened child! As Yoda would say, ""Lead to the dark side, this will"". The obvious fact here is the special affects are mind blowing, everything from outer space to the landscapes and the aliens that reside on them! The soundtrack keeps up with Lord of the rings as reference quality and the video is amazing and benefits from a pure digital transfer. As far as a story line... The story starts to set up the events that lead us to IV; We are introduced to the clone army that seems will become the storm troopers that we knew so well from the first series of movies. Anakin is defiant to Obi-Wan, and every one of authority for that matter, and his anger builds through out the movie until the death of his mother releases it. The act of vengeance and the love for the once Queen and now Senator Amidala are defying the very rules of the Jedi order. Plus, there seems to be a war brewing between the Republic and the separatists. The Jedi are clueless to the undermining that's going on in the senate (or that's how Lucas wants you to perceive it). Anakin finding love (which will lead to children) and the Jedi order weakening, this will allow the dark side to creep in. Now to my beef... The fight scene with Yoda and how the ruined it. What they did was take the supreme Jedi whose strength goes beyond force and mystic ability and, when challenged, reduced him to show boating! They had him flipping around and bouncing off walls during the long anticipated saber battle instead of showing his superiority through offence that's a direct counter to his defense. Like in martial arts or sword fighting, the masters lay back and strike as a counter from the defense. I feel the Jedi was based on martial arts and a sword fight is a sword fight. They should have made him the superior by showing his defensive superiority and how he would do that and stay totally calm through out. I like the fact that he didn't say things like; you are no match for me or some other stupid testosterone antidote. I would of liked to have seen a different approach to the fight scene with Yoda. That aside, I thought it was a very good movie and makes me anxious for the next and last installment.",1037491200,,3376,4.326498422712934

The movie is Star-Wars, with all those great little things and massive attention to detail that makes Star Wars so awesome.  If you are a fan of Star-Wars then you will love this movie - it has heaps of lightsaber fights, tonnes of wicked action sequences, a huge war sequence, cool spaceships and a great story line that answers a lot of questions.
Highlights are the clone war, Jango Fett & Obi Wan having a cool fight, the new planets, Slave I kicking some ... in an asteroid field, and most of all seeing why Yoda is the best lightsaber wielder in the galaxy.
And to all those cynics who said this was ... in your reviews - grow up and appreciate this for what it is - Star Wars - fun, fighting, fantasy and eye-droppingly gorgeous visuals/fx (esp. Natalie Portman!).  Its a Star Wars movie for godsake - you guys can go and watch your Beautiful Minds and marvel at how great the acting is - no-one cares.  This is a Star Wars movie through and through and it is fun and takes you on a spectacular ride for 137 minutes.  The acting and directing is no worse than any of the original trilogy - so leave it alone and stop your little cry-baby whinging........  If you expected Oscar quality acting then you should've gone to see something else.  This rocks!",1037491200,,1523,4.341549295774648
1318688,2,B00003CXKT,"Hahahaha. Look at all the people clamor to the theater in order to soak in the latest piece of . . . passing itself off as a Star Wars movie. ""Why do I have the feeling you'll be the death of me someday"", says Obi-Wan to Anakin as we are supposed to laugh at the foreshadowing George Lucas sets up, except that we already know that Obi dies by Anakin. So the joke's not funny and neither is every other intended joke in this crudfest. The only funny part is the supposed ""romance"" between Padme and Anakin, which feels about as intense as a hula hoop.
The little diner that Obi-Wan visits, what the hell does it all mean? This movie has waaaaaaaay too many modern references, do yourself a favor and rent episodes four through six and skip out on ep. 3 because I'm sure it'll be as bad as the last two. George Lucas better take the next movie off and try and regain his sense of adventure because this franchise is more stale than a crouton.",1037491200,2,941,4.262569832402234

For that to be done, you must have diffrent actors as in the original ones (a new hope ect). Keep in mind that Lucus first hade the idea of Phantom Menace or AOTC way before he came up with the idea for a new hope. These are MY generations movies! So BUG OFF! All those 60 year old who hate these movies: To Bad!

1318690,5,B00003CXKT,"There is this little movie, Star Wars. You may have heard of it.  The next chapter in the Star Wars saga is ""Attack Of The Clones.""  This film takes on a noticabeley darker tone than ""The Phantom Menace,"" and is the second darkest in the Star Wars series, behind ""The Empire Strikes Back.""  There were a few flaws in this film, as with Menace, but ""Clones"" is an extremely enjoyable film and a worthy inclusion in the Star Wars saga.  Now it's coming to DVD.  All I have to say is, buy it.  Buy it now.  As with ""The Phantom Menace,"" ""Clones"" is an extremeley well done DVD with hours of features, and awesome picture and sound.
Movie:
Set 10 years after the events in ""Menace,"" an assasination attempt has been made on now Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie  Portman).  She is to be looked after by Jedi night Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and his apprentice Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christiansen). But Obi Wan is sent to Kemino is investigate and find bounty hunter Jango Fett, while Anakin hides with Padme on Naboo, where they begin to fall in love.  While on Kemino, Obi Wan discovers that the Republic is using Jango Fett to create a clone army.  Soon after, the first battle of the ""Clone Wars"" ensues.  Episode 2 is an entirely entertaining film, and a must see.  (5/5)
DVD:
Video:  Oh my god!  The picture quality presented is absolutely flawless.  Episode 2 was shot entirely digital, and the DVD was a direct ""clone"" from the original digital source.  Colors are simply outstanding, and there are absolutely no flaws.  This is why I bought DVD!  Easily one of the two best DVD's in terms of picture quality I have ever seen.  The picture quality is even BETTER than in the theater!  The DVD comes in either Widescreen 2.35:1, or a Full Screen Version.  Both versions are extremely, and equally pleasing, no matter your preference.  (5+/5)
Sound: The sound on this disc is also outstanding!  The Dolby Digital 5.1 EX soundtrack fills the room wonderfully.  The two best examples, and certainly reference quality scenes are the chase through the asteroid field, and the 30 minute clone battle sequence.  The sound is envelouping, and outstanding.  (5/5)
Features:  This disc comes with over 6 hours of features!  From a commentary, to deleted scenes, documentaries, trailers, TV spots, and much much more!  (5/5)
Overall:  (5/5)  Excellent DVD!  Highly recommended!",1037491200,,2372,4.777777777777778
1318691,2,B00003CXKT,"I'm a huge ""Star Wars"" fan, and find it hard to diss ""The Phantom Menace."" But this one isn't! Visual Effects and Action don't guarantee a winner. All my favorite films are usually character-driven. A good story is the thing, one that George Lucas misses here. The visual effects are incredible, and the action sequences are awesome (Yoda is the man!), but the story is...! The love story between Amidala and Anakin is worse than ""Pearl Harbor"" (my favorite Romantic Epic) and ""Titanic"" put together and multiplied by four. And what story there is hard to follow (I never knew where I was for the last half of the movie). Some of the performances were good (Christopher Lee's Dooku was spooky, as always), but the characters aren't the story, but rather the backstory to ""Star Wars Episode II: Visual Effects and Nothing Else!"" The DVD is also nothing to praise, since the main feature is a load of bull! Skip this one. If you want to see great epics with loads of visual effects AND a good, involving story, check out ""The Patriot,"" ""Pearl Harbor,"" ""Titanic,"" and the upcoming Civil War Epic ""Gods and Generals.""

 Yes, visually it's stunning -- and some of the scenes are interesting as well. But the film as a whole is diffuse and at times confusing.
 The original Star Wars Trilogy led one from one scene to another with a strong sense of what was going on and why. Attack of the Clones just sort of wallows around a bit and seems to take pot shots at the action.
 LucusFilms seems to be putting more emphasis on the special effects and computer generated graphics than on the story -- and there is a story to be told here.
 Thankfully, not all facets of the film are negative. We do get a view of Anakin Skywalker and see him beginning to turn to the dark side. We get to meet charactors which were first introducted in episode IV, A New Hope ... and see where the death star comes from. So for stage setting, the movie gets a thumbs up. For story line and strong characters, a thumbs down.
 Certainly a mixed bag here. I was disappointed, but not devestated. Get it if you're a fan.
Recommended with reservations...",1037491200,,1026,4.322916666666667
1318693,5,B00003CXKT,"I had heard lots of bad things about Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones, so I was not sure what to expect. I was really surprised how good it was. In Episode II,there is alot of ground to cover, Anakin and Padme falling in love, Anakin starts to turn to the dark side, the rise of the clones and the beginning of the end for the jedi. George Lucas is able to all of these things and not short change any of the story lines. The second disc has a lot extra features including deleted scenes, trailers, and more. Overall, Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones is well the money!",1037491200,,587,4.157894736842105
1318694,4,B00003CXKT,"I'm one who found the DVD presentation of the movie to be very average.  The picture isn't as sharp as Phantom Menace, and just isn't anything special.
As for the movie - well it was good.  The acting was really stiff by Christensen and Portman, but I'm one who blames that entirely on the director.  As evidenced by the first three movie, Star Wars films don't need first rate acting (though it would be nice), but the acting must at least be emotional and a little over acted rather than under acted as in Episode 2.
There were also too many digital effects, and at times I felt like I was watching something more of a cartoon than a live shot movie.
But overall, it was a pretty good Star Wars movie.",1037491200,,703,4.3106060606060606
1318774,2,B00003CXKT,"Episode 2 is the first of the ""Star Wars"" movies that I've never seen in a theater. Had I gone, the DVD would never have been purchased.
A blend of boring dialogue and overly drawn-out, difficult to follow action sequences, I found myself wondering, ""When is this going to end?"" George Lucas appears to have forgotten how to tell a story and make it interesting--he seems more absorbed with technology/special effects, and the end result is painfully obvious.
There were a few good moments--the scenes on Tatooine, a brief glimpse of a model for the yet to be constructed Deathstar, and some insight into the mind of Anakin Skywalker. But, Mr. Lucas, where is the fun in this movie? Where is the decent storytelling? 15-20 minutes at a time of very little dialogue, and senseless/frequently preposterous action sequences, does not make a film worth watching.
Unlike many others, I personally enjoyed Episode 1 after the first 20 minutes or so. I kept hoping for that same, ""Hey, this is getting good!"" feeling while looking at Episode 2 last night...sadly, that feeling surfaced only briefly, during a few sequences.
A mock documentary on the DVD, spotlighting the ""career"" of R2D2, is far superior to the movie itself, and had me doubled over in laughter. Thank goodness there's ***something*** on this disc to at least partly justify the purchase.
Commercials for Episode 2 brag about the digital transfer...small wonder, image quality is all that this movie has going for it. Personally I'll take decent storytelling on conventional film stock any day of the week.
Perhaps Mr. Lucas should collaberate with some of the creative minds at Pixar--they seem to understand the importance of a decent story.",1037491200,,1704,5.003521126760563
1318775,2,B00003CXKT,"Lucas, three words to you: ""Less is more!""
CGI now permits a director to pack every screen with so much visual detail that you go into overload - to make dazzling CGI sets with nothing real in them at all. It *allows* the director to do that. George Lucas doesn't realise that it's one thing to have the capacity to do something, and it is quite another to actually do it. Again and again Lucas has said: ""Special effects now allow us to do things that wouldn't even be possible back in the original films."" Then why do the original films look so much more realistic?
Just because you *can* stuff a screen with photorealistic spaceships is no excuse to go around doing it. I mean, animated cartoons can display what they like too, and have been around for a lot longer. An animated movie would not be so tastelessly overdone as this!
By the way, the benefit of CGI is *not* that it makes special effects look *more real* than miniatures - it only allows you to do *new things*. It's capability, not degree. In this film, you can tell what's CGI and what's not - it's just blindingly obvious. If films are so blue-screened, they suffer. Those who think the new ""digital Yoda"" is ""more real"" than the puppet, have forgotten that Yoda never existed: only the puppet existed. SO essentially, making Yoda look *more real* than the puppet was utterly pointless.
Apart from ""eye candy diabetes"", there are major problems with the film. The storyline makes no sense, and has not the structural soundness of the earlier films. The script is awful. Lucas has said: ""I rely on visuals, not dialogue"". Yet the visuals and dialogue both fail.
Actually, this review has been 4/5 on visuals and 1/5 on everything else. That's a good match for the film!",1037404800,,1737,4.588424437299035

1318780,1,B00003CXKT,"It's an old axiom in the industry that, when talking about their film, a director or stars will always parrot something like ""Yes, it has special effects, but it's really all about the characters.""  Well, this is one film I don't think even Lucas would say that about.  Forget characters -- this is all about the pixels.
Which is probably just as well, as the characters themselves aren't particularly interesting.  With the except of Ms. Portman and McGregor, there isn't any acting going on here.  In particular the actor who plays the Darth nee Anakin Skywalker Vader, is so bad he actually makes the digital characters seem polished in comparison.
And, yes, we have Jar Jar back, and while he's not quite as annoying as in the first film he certainly doesn't get killed, which is the only thing that might have made this movie watchable.  When you're praying for a movie character to be eliminated who isn't a bad guy, you know you're in for a bad time.
There is *one* great scene in this movie, at the very end, which makes renting it worthwhile (just make sure your fast forward is working, as you definiately want to skip the previous two hours).  That it also involves a digitized (and puppeted) character says a lot about where this kind of movie is nowadays.
There *is* a certain audience for this film but it's a very peculiar one.  If you love playing video games but are too inept or have too short an attention span to play them out to their higher levels, this whole movie acts like a very fancy cut scene.  I can see a certain young crowd appreciating the fact they don't have to think but just get to watch the pretty colors and loud noises.
I loved the first Star Wars films when they first came out.  Then again, they had (relatively) primative special effects and people like Harrison Ford who could actually act.  This franchise has now totally run itself into the ground.  Next step up for Lucas: digitizing the audience (otherwise he'll *have* no audience for the third and, mercifully, last, episode in the saga).",1037404800,2,2037,4.6149584487534625
1318781,3,B00003CXKT,"I was very disapointed with this movie, the story was good but the acting was its downfall, everyone I ask about this movie says that the Yoda scene was there favorite, I sadly found it very dumb how the set up the scene, the only thing this movie did better than the first one was NO JAR JAR!",1037318400,,293,4.068965517241379
1318782,3,B00003CXKT,"Before I say anything about this movie, let me clearly state for the record that I have considered myself a HUGE Star Wars fan since the very first time I saw Episode IV.  And after being somewhat disappointed by the thin plot, poor acting, boring dialogue, and irritating characters of Phantom Menace, I thought Attack of the Clones was much better when I saw it in the theater.
But now, watching it again on DVD, I found myself disappointed once again.  Just like in Phantom Menace, Lucas & Co. put all their effort into the action, visuals, and sound.  Unfortunately, they seem to have forgotten that truly good movies also require a good story, good dialogue, and good acting.  Perhaps if I had a home theater setup with surround sound, I could still get swept away in the intoxicating worlds Lucas has created.  I can't deny the brilliance and beauty of Coruscant or the eerie, stormy world of Camino (Kamino?) where the clone army is bred.
The problem is that watching Episode II on a plain ol' TV with plain ol' sound just emphasizes the movie's bad points, which are numerous.  I found myself surprisingly bored for much of the middle of the movie, especially during the scenes with Amidala and Anakin.  The growing love between the future Mr. & Mrs. Darth Vader should be one of the high points of the movie, but it falls embarassingly flat: the actors have no chemistry at all (the kid playing Anakin, in particular, conveys all the depth of a mousepad), and the dialogue sounds exactly like the half-baked afterthought that it undoubtedly was in Lucas' mind.  The plot has holes you could drive the Death Star through and no discernible logic other than to support the action/visual sequences and to explain what we already know from Episodes IV-VI.  I could go on, but I imagine you get the idea.
I should mention a couple of good things, aside from the spectacular effects.  Ewan McGregor does a fine job, giving Obi Wan the only real spark or charm among the human characters, though I suppose the guy who plays Senator Palpatine does okay as well.  Aside from Obi Wan, though, Yoda is far and away the most interesting and expressive character.  The creature in the diner, Dex, is also interesting.  Lucas should just forget about working  with human actors and focus on his light and magic tricks, since he obviously has no ability as a director to elicit good performances.
In the end, however, I give this 3 stars because the action scenes and visual landscapes are so overwhelmingly spectacular, and because there are some nice payoffs for Star Wars fans, like seeing the origin of the Stormtroopers and finally getting to see Yoda wield a lightsaber.  One great thing about DVDs: you can easily skip the lame parts.  Better yet, take a mind-altering substance, put on Pink Floyd or Radiohead, and just forget about the story entirely!",1037318400,,2854,4.735353535353536

1318873,3,B00003CXKT,"I look through the various reviews of this title, and am consistently amazed at the lengths to which a fan of this series will go to justify George Lucas and this quickly dwindling franchise. I am a Star Wars fan. I grew up watching the classic trilogy, and was as excited as anyone could be about the prequels. Unlike a lot of Star Wars fans, I enjoyed the Phantom Menace. But I cannot say for an instant that Attack of the Clones was a good motion picture.
  Let me make one thing clear, however. As a visual artist, George Lucas has no peer. The worlds that he creates are astounding, rich, and full of life. It does not take long for the viewer to become lost in Mr. Lucas' unbelievable creations. Coruscant is a bustling hive of activity, immense and claustrophobic at the same time. Tatooine is a hostile land, teeming with grit and barely perceived danger. These are just two examples of George Lucas' artful hand at work. He is a creator of wonders. A purveyor of fantasy. A genius working at the top of his game.
  Now for the problems. This may be the most poorly written movie I have ever seen. The script is laughably bad. There were several points during the film, where I had to mentally keep myself from cringing. The scenes between Padme (Natalie Portman) and Anakin (Hayden Christiansen) are painful to watch, and frankly juvenile. I especially enjoyed the ""Sound of Music"" moment once Padme had made it back to her home planet of Naboo. (Watch the film, you can't miss it)
  I had hoped that Mr. Lucas could have distanced himself from the stilted and moronic dialogue that plagued the Phantom Menace. Sadly, it has gotten worse. He had reduced the Jedi Knights to mumbling, bickering old men, and he had made Senator Amidala a whiny, petulant crone. And Anakin....this character was butchered. Hayden Christiansen is so miscast in this role it is hard to believe he made it through his screen test. Mr. Christiansen is a fine actor, see My Life as a House for proof of his skill. But in the hands of Mr. Lucas and his script, he has been relegated to skulking in the corner like a reprimanded child.
  All in all, the Attack of the Clones is a Star Wars film, and for fans of the series, that is a great thing. I own the movie, as I own them all. But, heaping undue praise upon this film just because it is THIS film is not warranted. Even the greatest stumble from time to time. With this material, I had hoped for more from Mr. Lucas and company. Sadly, my expectations for Episode III are fading.
  One piece of advice. Mr Lucas, please give Larry Kasdan a call when you start the script for the third film. Please.....he does not seem to be very busy at the moment.",1037318400,,2688,4.456211812627291
1318874,2,B00003CXKT,"I gave this 2 stars for the neat graphics.  The biggest problem ""Attack of the Clones"" faces is that of 'The Phantom Menace"" -- lack of character development.  In ""Star Wars,"" the actors and actresses were good enough to add personalities to their characters.  Harrison Ford personified Han Solo; Mark Hammill's name is synonymous with Luke Skywalker (for better or worse for his career).  Lucas hit the jackpot with some excellent actors.
In the case of ""Attack of the Clones"" and ""The Phantom Menace,"" you have bad acting, bad dialog, lack of personality and no character development.  There is absolutely no chemistry between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen.  Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford did a great job in the first three movies in that they made their relationship believable.  Is it fair to compare the movies?  I think so; they're part of the same storyline -- AND -- Fisher and Harrison were relative unknowns at the time.
It's over 20 years later and Star Wars Episodes 4, 5 and 6 are still attracting new viewings and creating faithful fans.  I don't see this happening with Espisode 1 and 2 -- the main fact is that no one cares about these characters.  How many Senator Padm&eacute; Amidala fans are out there?
""Clones"" has been praised for it's special effects (which are good), but FX should only should contribute to 50% of any movie that aspires to be a classic.  The other 50% should be the basics -- acting for one.  Granted, in the here and now, a lot of viewers really don't care about character development, it's the special effects that matter.  But give a film 20 years, let the special effects become outdated and see if you watch it for the storyline alone...  that's what separates the good movies from the bad.  This movie, just like its predecessor, while I tried to like them, falls into the later category.",1037318400,2,1847,4.746081504702194
1318875,4,B00003CXKT,"I purchased this DVD along with the new Fellowship of the Ring: Extended version on the same day.  While the Fellowship 4 DVD set is the finest, most ambitious DVD experience to date, the Star Wars came out on top in terms of video and audio superiority.  Lord of The Rings is also a better movie by far, but if I want to test my speakers, or impress my neighbors with my home theater, Episode 2 is going to be the movie I show them.
The picture is, by far the closest thing to perfection I've ever scene on my TV.  It is clear and it is beautiful.  Everything looks crisp and clear and the colors are so vibrant they make the rest of the world drab in comparison.  Granted, the DVD format obviously benefited from the digital recording, digital editing and digital everything.  In fact, it looks far better than it did on the big screen.  The digital clarity really comes through in the DVD in a way it didn't come through on film.
The sound is peerless.  Lucas owns THX and he obviously keeps a few tricks in the bag for his own movies.  At first I was a bit disappointed that he didn't release a DTS soundtrack, but after hearing the DD Ex sound, I will never scoff again.  Sounds not only go around the room, they go through the room in a way I've never heard before.  Unlike many movies, it was very difficult at times to tell exactly where the sounds were coming from i.e. what speakers.  It is 3D sound like you've never heard it.  Obviously you will benefit more from a receiver with DD EX, but the sound is incredible just the same.
The extras are decent, but after seeing the new Fellowship 4 DVD behemoth, it's hard to rave.  I will say that some of the cut scenes, while not very exciting, made the Anakin/ Padme romance slightly more tolerable.  There were even some scenes where the acting wasn't wooden and stiff and the dialogue didn't make me want to burn my eyes out (gasp!).  There were a couple of good SFX shots, like the one of Obi-Wan departing Curascant in his Jedi Star fighter, but they are few and far between.
I haven't watched all of the documentaries, but the commentary is far better than the one in Episode 1.  While a lot of it is overly self-congratulatory or toadying at the heels of Lord Lucas, there are actually some good behind the scenes nuggets hidden in there and Lucas does a decent bit of foreshadowing.  While most of Lucas' crew outside of the SFX guys come off as sycophants, Lucas himself seems to have a clearer picture of what his movies are, or at least what they should be.  And while he never admits it outright, he seems to know why Ep. 1 didn't work so well and Ep 2 did beyond the technology.  Anyway, he seems a bit more in touch with reality than he has come off in the past and it restored much of my wavering confidence in him.
Ok, I won't bore you too much with another review of the movie.  By now you love it, hate it or fall firmly in the middle.  I'll admit to liking it a lot, but droning audibly at all the tired loved scenes.  I go see Star Wars movies to see cool science fiction ... kicking, and the last 40 minutes of this movie is the greatest...kicking ever.  Every time I see Yoda come out swinging that lightsaber I giggle uncontrollably.  It is the greatest action sequence of any movie ever in my book.  Granted, the rest of the movie falls far short of Citizen Kane, but I'll take lightsaber wielding Muppets over mean, old newspaper tycoons any day.",1037318400,,3428,4.3171875
1318876,2,B00003CXKT,"But, as the old saying goes, fool me twice, shame on me.  Having almost walked out of the theater during the ""first"" movie, I vowed never to watch this movie.  However, while in the video store recently, I found myself renting this movie.  Oh, the mystery of the mind.
Plain and simple, I did not like this movie.  It just seems to lack any heart, feeling, or emotion of the Original Trilogy.  This movie seems to be only an exhibition of what special effects George Lucas can create, and plot be damned.
The scenes between Anakin and Padame are excrutiating.  Anakin comes off as a college frat boy trying to get into Padame's you-know-what.  The ""political"" scenes are dull.  Ewan McGregor might be the only redeeming actor in this movie.  The Yoda-fighting scene was laughable.
I think the best example of comparison would be ""The Shining"".  If one were to compare the Stanley Kubrick masterpiece to the made-for-TV abortion, I think you would understand my comparison of these two movies to the original Trilogy.  They just don't stack up.
Just a side note:  Please, please, please George Lucas, when you do finally release the Original Trilogy on DVD, please release the original versions, not the ""revisionist-Special Edition"" versions.  Please, please, please...",1037318400,,1269,4.957345971563981

We watched it last night and by the time Yoda said something you couldn't tell he was talking funny because EVERYBODY IN THE MOVIE IS TALKING LIKE HIM, not only using adjectives in the wrong places, but doing stiff literal translations from english... You may have heard of spanglish. Well, Yoda is the master of espangls, and has taught it to all the characters, specially for this movie.",1037232000,,485,4.586206896551724
1318878,5,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars truely began a phenomenon that gave a total piece of modern popular culture.  George Lucas has done a great job as a writer but a much better job in his storytelling.  Since May 1977 the epic Star Wars films, which consist of hardcore galactic politics, and amazing space battles, has made millions of fans worldwide.  Lucas is an artist and he uses celluloid as his medium.  We have watched as several action figures were built, novels were being published, and have seen Halloween costumes were being made.  That first groundbreaking film's commotion wouldn't be over though.  That was just one link to the chain.  Star Wars' genuis is the way it captivates you.  The series has ended but has it?  No, books are being created but the main pieces of the chain still haven't been put into place.  The beginning of what Star Wars really is, is happening still today.
  After ten years since the invasion of Naboo in Episode one (formerly queen) Senator Padme' Amidala(Natalie  Portman) had bounty on her head.  Her ship was blown up and she was almost killed, but who did it, and was Padme' safe?  Well, with Jedi Knigh Obi Wan Kenobi(Ewan Mcgregor) and his apprentice Anaking Skywalker(Hayden Christensen) she has a chance f survival.  After ten years of not seeing his love Anakin Skywalker meets Padme' for the second time.  He obviously is in love with her, which hugely impacts the behavior of Skywalker.  But the Dark Side of the forse is clouding the good.  Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz) can't even sense it.  And Mace Windu is worrying about war breaking out.  A new darkness is clouding good.  But the peacekeepers, the Jedis are becoming extinct and very few are still around.  But Anakin is  deeply becoming disturbed by the dark forces.  He is becoming the Darth VAder we used to know.  It's all impacting his way of flirting with Padme'.  But even more dark, blocking his way of the force and seducing him.
  This, of course is not the final chapter in the saga.  We have one more link to the chain, one more piece to put in place.  One more piece and we'll know the truth about what happens, and how it truely will turn out.  Lucas' way of storytelling is also another reason of why this has become such a phenomenon.  It will keep you guessing.  Yes, I believe one of the keys to this film, this very film that changed pop culture, and gave the meaning to science fiction was that he gave an heir of mystery to the films.  As simple as that.  Of course we want to know what will happen nex, we know how it all  turned out, but we want to know how it turned out that way.  Lucas' political views and imagination definetly rub on this franchises popularity.  The Star Wars films aren't only pretty battle movies but they are actually pioneering films that changed the genre forever.
  George Lucas is not only genuis but he is the true master of what science fiction should be.  If we look at these films and explore, we find out not only the lush, beautiful special effects draw us to them but the actual impact of the genre itself, the human drama, and the suspense and mystery draw us to these pioneering films.  It is amazing that one man can create such a giant universe.  George Lucas is definetly one of the great storytellers.  He not only brought us neet space battles, but he gave us amazing human drama that will lead us wondering.  These amazing films have brang top of the line computer animators, and one of the greatest imaginations of our time, and brang them together.  What do you get?  Star Wars.
  The films have also brang great actors together.  The creators of Star Wars actually introduced so many new actors.  Ewan Mcgregor gives another great job as Obi Wa Kenobi.  He captures the essense of Alec Guiness.  Christensen also does a good job in this film.  His interaction with PAdme' is amazing.
  I love the familiar Star Wars music.  The theme is great.  John Williams does a great job.
  Overall I would definetly applaud George Lucas, the genuis who created magic.  Thank you George Lucas.  You have created something that surpasses mainly any other science fiction in history.",1037232000,,4127,4.599173553719008
1318879,3,B00003CXKT,"The only way to truly enjoy this movie is if you're a child or someone who can watch the movie looking at it through a child's eyes. For the younger generation it's easy to understand why they love it, action, special effects and cool looking creatures, and really that's all that matters to them, but if you're an adult like I am and you saw the original in the theatre chances are you've changed the way you look at movies.
Me personally, I expect so much more than I did when I was a child, and obviously so do half the other reviewers here. Sure the acting is fairly wooden, the dialogue is weak, there's some really bad one liners and worst of all there's no emotion what so ever between the characters.
But what I can't understand is why the originals (especially ESB) where so well rounded in terms of a great script and effects and TPM and AOTC were not. Is it because Lucas has kids now and looks at things through their eyes? who knows? It's not that they're horrible movies, but obviously the effects were so much more important than the characters, for example why have a shape shifting bounty hunter (Zam) if the effect isn't being used for any purpose, is it just about the effect? Is Lucas telling us fans to mellow out and not read into the characters so much? thing is that's what we loved about the originals, the depth of the movies!
The bottom line is if you're strictly looking for entertainment with lots of action AOTC is it and deserves 5 stars, but for those looking for a movie with all the detail poured into the script and characters (like LOTR) you will be disappointed. I wanted to give this movie a single star, but while watching I always try to remember to watch it like I was seven all over again.
The strange thing is everything I expected in AOTC including a ""dark"" feel was delivered in LOTR, well at least I can watch Empire on lousy VHS, the Star Wars movie that really matters!",1037232000,18,1917,4.387640449438202
1318880,1,B00003CXKT,"Much has been said about the miserable story and acting elements of Star Wars Episode I, and Episode II has fallen even deeper into the spiral.
This entry is inferior even to Episode I on all fronts.  Narratively, Episode II is a complete mess, a hodgepodge of thin characters, some vague sense of a conspiracy, and logical aberrations (for example, why would Jango Fett be the basis of the clones?).  The ending, where the writers arbitrarily give the good guys a massive army to win the day, is especially ridiculous.
Visually there is nothing to match the stunning pod race of Episode I, which was a knockout even on the small screen.  Attack of the Clones is slow, ponderous, with action sequences that don't pass the mustard at all.  Part of that problem is the fact that without the gallant Liam Neeson (not to mention not a single character comparable to the cast of the original Star Wars films), there isn't a character sympathetic enough to make me interested.  Natalie Portman and Hayden Christenson give completely wretched performances; Christenson is even more annoying and shallow than Jake ""I'm so cute"" Lloyd in Episode I, succeeding in soiling the character of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader even more.  *Now* it should be easy to think of Darth Vader as a ""crusty old man"", in Kevin Smith's words.  But at least Christenson can claim inexperience -- Portman's failure is even more despicable considering she's been acting for nine years now, and she's been progressively getting worse.  Since the entire film is supposed to focus on this relationship, the atrocious performances of the two actors just sinks the film.  Ewan McGregor is even more crippled than in the first film.  Obi-Wan has become a thoroughly stoic, uninteresting character here, thus preventing McGregor from putting in the youthfulness and exuberance as in Episode I.  His turn in Episode II ranks as his stiffest, most inexpressive performance ever -- he's better than that.
I would have enjoyed this film a little more if the action sequences and visual spectacles could match up.  No luck.  Without the acrobatic wizardry of Ray Park, who as Darth Maul had been Episode I's secret weapon, Episode II's action elements are simply not interesting.  The sight of the rows of clones and droids stops being impressive awfully quickly.  In the end, there's only one scene that works -- Yoda's lightsaber duel with Count Dooku.  And even then, the idea is better than the execution.  George Lucas misses a chance to wow us here; instead of designing a lightsaber duel that mounts and builds, he's content to let Yoda flip around for about 30 seconds, then get out without any sense of conflict or tension.  It looks pretty neat, but there's no emotional impact.
Episode II is playing in New York right now in IMAX format, but I'm glad I saved my money and rented it.  There's nothing here that a bigger screen format can rescue from the junk pile.  It seems Lucas has one more shot at preventing himself from completely despoiling his Star Wars legacy, but I have a nasty feeling Episode III will once again disappoint.  A crushing, ignominious bookend to a pop-culture legend.",1037232000,69,3161,4.882022471910112
1318881,2,B00003CXKT,"I know that I will incur the wrath of many Star Wars fans by writing a negative review of the movie, but it is really nothing memorable. It seems like Star Wars just no longer has the creative gusto that made the first three films so good. Lucas himself took the reins for this one, and it has been said to death, but rightfully so, that his skill at directing actors is nebulous at best. The obvious crowd-pleasing Yoda light-saber sequence is most likely the only thing one will remember from the movie, as it contains precious little emotional, visceral, or intellectual content.
First, the abundant use of CGA and special effects. Once the beautiful special effects were in existence to enhance the telling of a story, but they have now become themselves the focus of the film and the story becomes the clothesline on which to hang stunning shots of all sorts of halls, caverns, and environments. In the first three Star Wars movies, the emphasis was on the characters and the story, with environmental shots interspersed to add to the exotic flavor of the films. In the latest film, though, Lucas becomes clearly self-indulgent by including one breathtaking panorama after another, and although the technical merit is unreproachable, there is more than just setting to a movie.
Next, the content of the film itself. The acting is shaky among the leads. Hayden Christensen is Anakin, growing more brash and arrogant by the day, despising Obi-Wan's tutelage and wanting to break off from his mentor. At the same time, Anakin is falling for Padme, even though love is not permitted in the Jedi code. One can immediately see the complex issues that could be explored here: love, duty, rebellion, and how they all play together. Instead all we get is a plodding story with Anakin reflecting on his misfortune and falling in love with Padme, but without any sort of inner anguish, conflict, or even any action that would indicate the intoxication of his love for her. He falls in love with the amount of passion that I would pay my utility bills with. Having mentioned Padme, Natalie Portman gives a decent performance reprising her role as the queen-turned-senator. Ewan McGregor is excellent as Obi-Wan, losing himself in the role. Samuel L. Jackson's character is a bit ill-defined, but he does have a killer lightsaber battle.
Ah, George. Although he has been bashed by everyone for his directing, people seem to forget that he directed the original Star Wars. He can do it. But it is strange that we get something from Lucas so shallow. Where The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars, and even Return of the Jedi (but mostly Empire) were mythical and drenched with exuberance and passion, this film feels like it is just an afterthought, fulfilling a purpose. That's a shame, because the story is good and with all that money for special effects, maybe George should have called one of his pals in the directing business. Lucas is a jack of many trades as far as films go, but directing perhaps isn't one. Film editing, certainly (Raiders of the Lost ark ending was his brainchild), as well as countless production triumphs show his knowledge of the technical aspect of the film, but as for the other aspects, like acting, he is out of his league.
Not that there is nothing at all to like about the movie. The scenery is beautiful and the lightsaber battles are intense, the story is somewhat engaging in spite of its treatment, but one watches the film with a sense of the potential all of the parts held. The first three films are delightful and profound, this one, much like Episode 1, is shallow and pretentious with too many special effects. Die Hard Star Wars fans will eat it up, but casual fans and outsiders beware, it might not be the movie you expected or wanted it to be.",1037232000,,3781,4.738998482549317
1318882,5,B00003CXKT,"Episode II is a perfect addition to the series. I loved the way certain questions from the other movies were tied into and answered in this one. I think George Lucas has a phenomenal imagination, and his depiction of Anakin as a young adult is exactly the way I thought it should be. The love scenes were awkward/wierd. It seemed like Haydon was trying too hard to act. Other than that, I thought this movie was 5-stars all the way.",1037232000,,432,4.4125
1318992,1,B00003CXKT,"Let's face it, Episode I was tolerable, though it clearly showed that Lucas had lost touch with his fans, with science fiction, and even -- sadly -- with his own story. But Episode II is just miserable. A pointless and predictable story, miserable acting, a poorly conceived and executed world -- all despite lavish special effects and some cool action sequences. If it wasn't for the Star Wars legacy, no one would watch this or give it more that two stars. Almost as bad as (the new) Planet of the Apes, and not even as good as Lost in Space (the movie).

The addition of horror-great Christopher Lee in a pivotal role livens things up considerably, as does Ben Kenobi's spectacular duel on the water planet.  Samuel L. Jackson was wisely given more to do this time around, and while the Annakin-Padme romance largely falls flat, ATTACK OF THE CLONES is the most satisfying entry in the series since THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, (while still falling well short of that film's magnificence).",1037232000,,618,5.295918367346939

That quality is also apparent in the transfer to DVD - very crisp. The cinematography of many scenes is outstanding. As for the plot, some people prefer SWE1 to SWE2, but I prefer SWE2. The romantic link is necessary, but it is not overdone. There is plenty of action and filling in the historical gaps, as well as hints into the future. The acting abilities are very good, although the fighting might not quite be up to par of Darth Maul in SWE1. However, that is realistic (as realistic as fiction can get).

1318996,4,B00003CXKT,"First and foremost, less Jar Jar and that alone is a beautiful thing.  I found Episode 2 to be much faster paced and lacking the horrible acting of the very young Anikan, his bad acting mother and Jar Jar.  Ok, so the teen Anikan isn't much better.  he does a great creepy, but is just a bad actor when it comes to romance.  Plus he is whiney, but I suppose Luke was too..
the bonus CD is great.  Enjoyed it thoroughly as an avid Star Wars fan would.  Worth the price alone.
The action in this movie was fantastic and I feel it did lay some good ground work for the next movie (and following 3 we've all seen) without interfering like it did in the first one.
Lucas needs some serious help with his dialog, but when it comes to action and special effects- he is the best.  Well worth your money and fun for the whole family.",1037232000,,824,4.144654088050315
1318997,4,B00003CXKT,This installment in the Star Wars series was another solid outing on the entertainment side of it but is in no way the quality of the original 3 (nothing really could).  The movie seemed rushed and thrown togather acting wise.  Portman is a great cast for her role but Lucas doesn't seem to be able to get a good performance out of her. She is dry and amatuerish.  McGreggor is the ideal fit for Kenobi yet in this episode he struggles withthe character immensely.  I don't blame the actors I just blame direction not doing it's job.  The stars just don't seem to be getting into their characters enough to match what is expected.  Overall though the film is action oriented and the new characters are a great addition to the Star Wars series.  Dooku is well done and I forgot the actors name but he was great.  Yoda fighting was classic!  The whole Jango/Boba Fett angle was a little weak but my bias's are probably because of a lot of 3rd party influence into Boba Fett's world via novels and comics but those have nothing to do with Lucas.  All I can really say is if you love Star Wars and tolerated Episode One then well pick this up.  it is a good addition and entertaining although it is no classic like the Empire Strikes Back.  Lets hope George gets it right with Episode 3.,1037232000,4,1283,4.389830508474576
1318998,3,B00003CXKT,"I must have seen a different movie because the one I saw on opening day with bated breath did not deserve five stars.  Like most of America, I eagerly anticipated the next installment, hearing nothing but good things about it.
Man was I disappointed.  The acting was awful; apparently Hayden Christiansen has negative talent, because no one in the scenes he was in could act, not even Ewan McGregor or Natalie Portman.  The love scenes were as badly written written as a soap opera.  (""I've been dying a little each day since you came back.""?  Come on.)  I guess I wouldn't have had so much of a problem, except these excruciating scenes took up too of the movie.  One suggestion for George Lucas when he goes to make the third installment - get off your high horse and hire a decent screenwriter!  We all know you're brilliant (You created Star Wars for heaven's sake), so no one will think less of you if you don't try and write the thing, okay?
Enough of that - there were good things about this movie - i.e. the parts that weren't focusing on Anakin and Padme.  (That's one star) This movie is called Attack of the Clones - let's see more of that!
Also, this movie did have the coolest scene in the Star Wars saga by far - Yoda.  No one can touch that guy with a light saber, and that scene was just awesome.  It almost makes the whole movie worth watching.  There's another star.
Instead of two stars like the theatrical release, this DVD gets three stars because of 1) the cool extras and 2) because it looks way better!  The theatrical release was awful - digital film onto analog reels makes for a terrible projection.  It was like watching an mpeg.  A good mpeg, but an mpeg nonetheless.  Everything was grainy, and it looked worse thant if it had just been shot with standard 35mm stock.  The DVD has no analog whatsoever, and as a result looks better than it did in the theater.
p.s. in response to another reviewer - Lord of the Rings is still a much better movie.",1037232000,,1976,4.414364640883978
1318999,4,B00003CXKT,"I think that the other reviews do a decent job on reviewing the movie, so I'll touch on what everyone seems to be leaving out.
The DVD extras are worthless.
I only watched the 'action' featurette because let's face it, you aren't watching Star Wars for a good love story or for a story that captivates you and makes you think.  So logically I watched the action featurette first.  All it did was recap the story.  Many of the films actors only stated the obvious, like 'this is the first time we get to see a whole lot of jedi fighting at one time' -- you're kidding!  How riveting!  90% of what they say in this featurette is obvious when you just watch the film.  Like I said, it's more of a movie summary than anything interesting.
Could have easily done without Dex's Diner.  Conceptual art would have been better than seeing joe-jedi eating a hamburger on the set.
One thing I began to notice was that if you watch about 3 things off of the extras you've pretty much seen all the rest.  All you need to do is arrange the clips in a new order, and presto - new featurette.  There was a lot of repetition.
The deleted scenes were not that interesting.  We'd rather have deleted action scenes that we know exist, but we got more dialogue.  Hmmm... What do fans want to see?  Is Star Wars better known for it's action, or intriguing dialogue?",1037232000,,1343,4.370967741935484
1319000,5,B00003CXKT,"People either love the Star Wars movies or they hate them. I happen to fall in the former category, so the release of Attack of the Clones was highly anticipated by me. The story of part two has been well discussed here, so I will just comment on the tape itself. I have the VHS version, and the only complaint I have is that there are slight intermittent fluctuations in the soundtrack. This happened perhaps five times during the movie but really did not spoil the watching of the film. I did not feel that I had to return the tape. Perhaps this means that the DVD is the format to buy for a digital film.
Some of the deleted scenes are included after the movie, and they are highly interesting as to their contribution to the story. I found it interesting that many of these scenes are musically scored so it must have been a close to a final cut of the film when these scenes were removed. Each clip is introduced with an explanation of the action and why the scene was not included in the film. There are one or two of these scenes that I think should have been left in the film, particularly the scene of Patme's family.",1037232000,,1126,4.291079812206573
1319101,3,B00003CXKT,"First of all, I couldn't decide whether to give three or four stars. I finally decided four just could not be justified, so it's really more like 3.5/5 from me. So, as you know by now, this is not a great movie, but it's better than Episode I by a considerable margin.  The special effects are great and seamless (moments in Episode I and especially the ones added to the 3 original SW films were quite flawed). The asteroid chase and rain planet and Yoda's lightsaber duel were all memorable. I noticed some grainy scenes in the theater, but everything looks good -- almost TOO good -- on the DVD. The plot this time around is less convoluted and more coherent and flows more naturally from scene to scene. The video and surround audio are both reference quality on this DVD, and there's enough extras to keep the most ardent fans busy for a long time. 'Nuff said about that -- no complaints at all there.
But alas, the characters and their interactions with each other, is the film's downfall, due to poor acting, directing, and screenwriting. I appreciated trying to add some romantic facets, but the dialogue is laughably bad in many scenes, and certain actors are so blandly disinterested they cannot overcome the material to convince us otherwise. Hayden Christiansen is simply awful, there is no other way to put it. The annoying, forgettable, hokey child actor in Episode I has been replaced by an annoying, forgettable, hokey teenage actor here. Natalie Portman is only slightly less wooden than in Episode I, which must be blamed on the direction, because in other places she's proved herself to be a competent actor. And although I generally like him, I never quite bought Samuel Jackson as a Jedi Knight. He goes through the entire film with an odd look on his face and I get the distinct feeling he was always on the verge of breaking into laughter reading his lines. Christopher Lee and Ewan McGregor are the only actors worthy of the roles, along, of course, with the vocal talent that gives the CG Yoda life. Thankfully the insipid Jar Jar Binks is less prominent in this film, although even after five seconds he begins to grate on you. I guess he had to put in an appearance so they could pump another action figure into Toy 'R' Us stores around the world. As for the direction, Lucas needs to just give it up and let someone who knows what they are doing handle it. He is NOT a great director. His two best films, Empire and Raiders, were directed by someone other than him. There was some great screen chemistry in the original Star Wars but it must have just been stars-aligning dumb luck, since he has never been able to reproduce it since.
Reading this you might think I hated this movie, but I actually didn't. You just need to let yourself become a kid again for a few hours and ignore the bad things. Then it just becomes fun, and if you are expecting something more from a Star Wars film then you aren't being realistic. The first three Star Wars films also had lots of bad acting, bad screenwriting, uneven direction, cheesy special effects, and a ridiculous plot but we never saw that, because we were young and unjaded and had no preconceptions or expectations for the films to live up to, and we were experiencing instead of analyzing as we watched. If you can force yourself to do the same here, you'll enjoy it.",1037232000,3,3344,4.573333333333333

Pros
1) Good action and effects
2) as always, great saber battles.
3) Love the clone troopers!
Cons
1) No character development
2) Terrible dialogue
3) weak story
Here's my theory:
1) ILM runs the show at LucasArts.
2) Lucas has had this story in his head for too long and has forgotten why any of these characters should be doing any of the things they're doing. For instance: someone tell me WHY should Amidala fall in love with Anakin?  What's to love? The sulk? The groan and moan?
3) Lucas can't direct actors.  He can direct effects guys and puppets, but not humans, and especially not children (see Ep 1 for more than enough evidence of that!)
Lucas should have done with AOTC what he did with 'Empire Strikes Back'... provide the architecture of the story to an able writer who can pen the screenplay. And hand the directing duties over to a real director.
Overall, I just think Lucas has been reading too much of his own press.

1319104,4,B00003CXKT,"The first digitally filmed live action mainstream feature film to be transferred to DVD, STAR WARS EPISODE 11: ATTACK OF THE CLONES is itself a perfect clone and even better looking on disc than on the big theater screen.
What can you say about this popular series that has not already been said? Not much. More than anything else, this episode on DVD is a technological marvel that illustrates the fact that anything imagined can now be filmed in a photo realistic style. On the other extreme, I have been told that in some parts of the world, religious groups have begun meeting regularly with a systematic theology built around elements from the Star Wars films.
The production design of Attack of the Clones, and its digital realization, is stupendous in its scope and detail. The action scenes are often staggering in their sustained intensity and cleverness. However, the formula and structure reflect all the other Star Wars episodes. Perhaps that familiarity is intentional. Seen as a whole, single story (admittedly one episode short), it is still interesting to consider the fall and redemption themes around the character we already know will become Darth Vader. And the future son, Luke Skywalker (Luke Skywalker = Luke S = Lucas?) who rescues and ""saves"" his father. Possible personal themes aside, certainly elements of world myth and even primitive Christianity are embedded on Lucas' digital canvas.
Is it meaningful or relevant? Check out the political themes sometime. There's a blatant message unfolding. Unfortunately, most if not all of the talky scenes are boringly expository or seemingly pointless. But to its credit, the flow of eye-popping images carry the film in spite of the stiff, self-conscious performance from Hayden Christianson in the central role. In several scenes Natalie Portman actually glows, but she looks uncomfortable in action sequences.
When Lucas is done with his six part epic space opera in 2005, it might be fun to see the whole thing edited down to a two-hour feature. Lucas gives great extras and unlike Spielberg, is not so full of himself that he dare not narrate a commentary lest he ""compromise"" the movie's ""integrity"" and spoil the ""purity"" of the film experience. In fact, Lucas dares to actually explains the plot points from the author's perspective. Bravo. Recommended.",1037145600,,2331,5.104712041884817
1319105,2,B00003CXKT,"I used to be a Star Wars fanatic.  But the script to Attack of Clones was incoherent, the acting - especially Hayden Christiansen - wasn't as good as what you could expect in most high school junior class plays, and the special effects were dazzling to the point of distraction.  Nothing could detract from the fact that George Lucas has lost touch with what made the original movies so good.  If you are a pre-teen to teen, the Young Miss crowd or its male equivilant, you'll love this.  But if you are a fan of the previous movies, save yourself the disappointment...",1037145600,2,569,4.549019607843137
1319106,1,B00003CXKT,"I reluctantly went to a local theatre last summer to see Star Wars ep. 2, Attack of the clones. Not that I'm a Star Wars hater. I have too much things to do to start a new career as a ""passionate-movies-hater"". Still, I went reluctantly because, I had some memories of the bad feelings I got from the previous instalment in Mr. Lucas' space opera.
You might think that someone with low expectations will be easier to please. At least, that's what I thought before I went to see this movie which is not only exceedingly too long but also pathetic in its absence of a decent storyline.
We all know the first Star Wars trilogy and the immense popularity these movie got from a nice combination of good story-telling, lovable character, interesting special effects and exotic locals.
This film has nothing to do with it. It's more like a videogame-like oriented series of episode where no tie is necessary between story elements. As long as you can show lots of action scenes (that get boring since they're way too long), there's no reason to get a plot in the way.
Still, I noticed that Lucasfilm tried to patch the problems they had with episode 1 in this one. One of the way, they thought was to bring back popular characters form the first trilogy in this one like Boba Fett. How to make Boba fit nicely into the storyline seemed like too much of a job for the scribes thought.
I noticed they also tried to give a &#8220;darker&#8221; and more &#8220;adult&#8221; tone to the film. Still, it is done so broadly that it becomes evident that this is an obligatory constraint they received. This also gets in the way of pure enjoyment. Had they tried to construct a strong story instead of showing their visual gadgetry, it could have been different.
It's sad to see such great performers as Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lee and poor puppeteer Frank Oz (who's getting reduced to a simple voice acting role here) trying to work in this mess Hollywood calls a movie.
Now, the DVD may look &#8220;cool&#8221; as a standard Star Wars aficionado would say. But it's mostly another &#8220;all bells and whistles&#8221; kind of disc. You know... the ones where you don't get any interesting facts: Just people saying how cool it was that they could do this or that with their computers, a lot of &#8220;deleted scenes&#8221; that were created especially for the DVD so you cannot really say that they were ever deleted and a lot of TV adds and movie trailers to give you the impression there's a load of stuff on the disc. Please Mr DVD producer cut on the sugar and give us more meat next time.
Another thing that annoys me is people claiming this is great because it's the first live-action movie directly transferred from digital source to digital output. So what? If the movie was at least an interesting one, I would be glad for it. Here, it looks like they did it so they would be the first ones to do it no matter what they showed.
But I wouldn't want to sound too harsh and I want to say there is a little good in this movie. Sadly, nothing comes to mind when I try to say anything nice about it.",1037145600,,3092,4.5133689839572195
1319107,1,B00003CXKT,"Jeeeeeeeese!
I am 'gob-smacked' that this was quite well received by the critics on its release.  I am even more shocked at the overall rating it has got here.
It is absolutely dreadful.  Without a shadow of a doubt the worst movie I have seen this year.  The acting is pathetic.  Ewan is a joke.  The guy who plays Anakin (????) will be lucky if he ever works again.  Even Natalie Portman, who is usually pretty decent, is woeful.  Only Dracula comes out of the farce with any hint of not having done his career too much harm.
It was just a series of special effects, most of which were just too obviously computerised.
As for the script.  What script you may ask?  At one point Ewan says to Anakin 'I have a feeling that you are going to be the death of me' ..... add to this the worst English accent the world has ever been asked to endure (again).  NOOOOOOOOOO!  Poor old Ewan must have really been thinking 'I have a feeling that this franchise is going to be the death of my career'.
It is even worse than The Phantom Menace .... purely down to the performances of the leading actors.
Lucas should pack it in now.  Chris Lee should flatly refuse if asked to reprise his role.  I tell you, its cruelty to actors. If Lucas goes ahead and makes the final 'music video' he stands the distinct possibility of being branded the Ed Wood of the modern age.
Words fail me.  It is that bad.
By all means watch it  .... at least its the best comedy of the year.",1037145600,8,1456,4.243636363636363
1319108,4,B00003CXKT,"I enjoyed ""Clones"", as it continues the interesting story of the two Jedis, Anakin, and Ben, and their trials and tribulations. Natalie Portman is breathtakingly sexy, and one cannot blame a Jedi for falling in love with her. The film is crystal clear, shot in all digital format, and the only miss I give it is there are still too many muppets and childish creatures walking around for my taste. The annoying Jar Jar had his screen time drastically cut, and it only adds to the movie. Lucas had one brilliant stroke of genius, in casting Christopher Lee as the evil Count Dooku. Peter Cushing was Grand Moff Tarkin in Episode IV, and his very presence gave the film grace and power. Lee does the same a quarter century later. The Jedi battles, and especially the sabre fights are spectacular as always. If Lucas plays his cards right in the next sequel, he will cut out Jar Jar altogether, and figure Dooku prominently, as well as the climatic sabre clash over the mouth of an active volcano between Obi wan, and Anakin Skywalker. Lucas needs to further realize that he will sell toys, and other merchandise REGARDLESS of pandering to 4 year olds. If he wants to market them, let him come up with an animated series about the adventures of Jar Jar, ect. If he concentrates on the fascinating characters and Jedi elements, and leaves out the ""Muppet Show"", the next film should be the best in the entire series.",1037145600,,1411,4.625498007968128
1319109,4,B00003CXKT,"Last fall's ""The Phantom Menace"" was one of the year's best DVDs. ""Clones"" pretty much follows its format. The centerpiece is a new 52-minute documentary, ""From Puppets to Pixels: Digital Characters in Episode II,"" made over a period of years with full access to George Lucas and his army of co-workers.
All the content helps, because repeated viewings of the film itself wear thin, emphasizing the weaknesses of the many Anakin Skywalker/Hayden Christensen scenes. What was merely slow in theaters becomes interminable upon third or fourth viewing. A telling moment comes when Lucas speaks in depth about his troubled jedi's greed, demons and thirst for power, while on sceen Christensen struggles to deliver amazingly inept dialogue.
Fortunately, the DVD's quantum leaps to other chapters provide escape to the killer action scenes, shown in breathtaking video and heard in stirring Dolby Digital 5.1 EX. Black-hole blacks anchor the visuals. The subwoofer rumbles and foreshadows and pounds away, while rear speakers swirl away. ""Clones"" is a first-rate home theater experience, at least viscerally.
Lucas talks about his series at some length, giving away a few specifics about the sixth and final film, including the death of one key character.
The docu shows how much of Lucas' direction of animated characters is done by proxy. We see artists molding specific characters, acting the part in front of mirrors to envision eye movements and facial expressions.
""They say digital actors are going to take over,"" Lucas says to a room filled with computer artists. ""I don't think so."" The director then turns to a resourceful young animator. ""When they talk about digital actors they don't know you exist.""
A fun mockumentary on R2-D2 includes Francis Ford Coppola saying he wanted the robot for ""The Godfather,"" but producer ""Bob Evans thought he was a runt.""",1037059200,,1861,5.206666666666667
1319188,3,B00003CXKT,"Despite the completely wooden performances of Samuel Jackson and Natalie Portman, Attack of the Clones is a pile of fun.  This Star Wars got lots and lots of cities with really cool flying transporters everywhere.  Plus, there are amazing new creatures like the owner of the diner, a fat four-armed monster(Computer Generated), who gives inside info to Obi Wan and is ten times a better actor than Sammy ""Poo-Doo"" Jackson.
Yet Lucas has created another epic of the future replete with gadgetry, guns, light sabers, and robots.  My boys are yelling right now that we must rush out right this moment and buy it (it's midnight of release date), and this one will be under the tree, for sure.  I was on the edge of my seat for many of the scenes, and only fell asleep once, probably during the costume changing/romantic/plot thickening scenes featuring Anikin and the Queen/Senator frolicking about in the meadow.
But I'm sure it'll be better the fourth or fifth time I watch it.
As we did for Chuck Berry, I suggest we wear t-shirts that read ""FREE Samuel Jackson"" (from his contract) so that the third prequel won't have to suffer from his deadpan performance.  I do recommend any Star Wars fan buying Clones, mainly so you won't be lost when Lucas makes the three post-quels.",1037059200,,1274,4.746606334841629

Video calibration as well in white balance, color saturation, literally a dozen different tests for video alone. It was a great idea to include it.
As for the movie, of course it's great (that is, now that I have it on DVD and can fast-forward through virtually every scene with Anakin and Padme). Deleted scenes (on disk 2) were decent and I didn't understand why they weren't in the DVD release as part of the movie, the way some were included in the release of Episode One's DVD. They would have much better than the jabberwocky between Anni and Pad. The deleted scenes have important parts of the story too (especially concerning the senate), so maybe it will be in the next release when they dub a new computer generated image (and voice) over that horrible cartoon grease cook in the diner scene.

Extras are plentiful and appreciated.  Puppets to Pixels is a must see. Own this DVD now.
P.S.- I have to comment on a complaint of Episode II that the ""fans"" complain about constantly.
The acting and dialogue is in a word horrible:  AT WHAT POINT IN TIME HAS STAR WARS ACTING BEEN GOOD?!!!  One good performance. Alec Guinness, Episode IV. Thats it. It Star Wars!! If you want great acting and dialogue, don't watch a movie for 12 YEAR OLDS!!!",1037059200,,930,4.317919075144508
1319192,5,B00003CXKT,"Usually a sequal is better than the first. For examples check out ""Scream"", ""Godfather"", ""Godzilla""- the one set in New York, and of course ""Episode 1"". There are no extra scenes like they have on DVD's but that doesn't mean it's a bad copy. This movie shows the making of the stormtroopers, imperial ships, the speeders used in ROTJ, and what else Anakin and Luke share in common, a knack for losing hands.
Rumor is that when George Lucas finishes Episode 3, he's finished for good. He's going to retire with his characters and not let anybody use them again. In other words, there won't be any more movies, books, toys, games, etc. On the bright side, these items can only go up in value if kept in mint condition. George Lucas has shown us all what can happen in space if we set our minds to anything. Who knows, it might be another 100 years before we actually launch from JFK to Pluto and back at Lightspeed.
I highly recommend you buying this movie only if you want to watch it or if you plan on keeping it for your collection. Good luck, and may the Force be with you.",1037059200,,1075,4.353233830845771
1319193,5,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones, the second installment of the Star Wars Saga (if your counting chronologically) is a brilliant piece of movie making magic and the DVD is a wonderful addition to any fans collection.
The DVD contains everythign from Trailers and Music Video to the various documentaries and deleted scenes often found in today's DVD releases.  The great thing is that all of these extra features will help to round out the story for you and fill in any gaps with which you may have come away from the theater.
The movie itself, as I said earlier is brilliant.  Where Episode 1 was somewhat slow, ATOC moves along at a brisk pace, leaving you breathless by the end.  Also unlike Episode 1, Jar-Jar is not front and center to distract from the story line.  While I enjoyed Phantom Menace I understand why many people disliked it.  Jar Jar Binks was quite distracting and took away from the seriousness of the story.  AOTC has no such problems.
As the story progresses we see the interaction between Obi-wan and Anakin and the growing tension between them.  Anakin feels his growth is being stifled and longs to break free to fulfill his destiny.
Another story line developing which will lead to Anakin's downfall (and obviously tied to the conflict between Anakin and his master) is his developing love for Padme.  As the film progresses both Anakin AND Padme must decide whether they shall respect the bonds of the Jedi or disreguard them and suffer the consequences.
The technical achievements of Episdoe 2 are amazing.  This is the first film to be photographed completely in the digital realm and is also the first digital film to be brought to DVD.  The crispness and clarity of the final product prove digital is here to stay.  Add to this the amazing special effects and you have an amazing film, one that is equal to Episdoe 5 (my favorite).

Most of you probably know Christopher Lee as Gandalf's nemesis Saruman in the Lord of the Rings movies, but in Attack of the Clones he plays the Sith Lord Count Dooku.
Well, why is Christopher Lee(Dooku) such a cool character in this movie you ask?  Because the final fight sequence between he and Kenobi is simple awesome.  Furthermore, what really makes the scene great is the odd and insane facial expressions which Lee displays during the fight!  I guarantee that if you focus on his face, you will end up laughing hysterically at his expressions.  It just goes to show you what happens when an actor has to prepare and act out a part in a short time period.  Anyways, the last twenty minutes of this movie is really the clincher and make the whole movie worth purchasing, but Christopher Lee is really the clincher!",1037059200,,971,4.583815028901734

1319196,4,B00003CXKT,"Better than Episode I. That should have been the tagline, because everyone is saying it.  Episode I was not all that bad, its just that are standards are so high from the original series being so good.  Episode II being better than Episode I, does not make it great, but hey these prequels will always come under par to are standards, no matter what Lucas cooks up.
We need more characters like Han Solo and Chewi, and what about the Ewoks.  These first two Episodes have lacked the personal level that the first series had.  We knew the characters because they had a personality.  They were not formal.  This new series brings formality as if these characters were royalty or something.  It is as if they were from Europe. We never would have heard Han Solo or Luke Skywalker talk this way. Why should we hear it now.
This movie like its predecessor gets lost in its own awareness.  The characters know that they have to fit the part because they, just like us, already know what the future holds.
That is what makes this series weak, but still we will continue to watch because George Lucas is making history with his ground breaking series.  With over the top special effects and digital sights beyond what we can grasp, this series will be treasured for lifetimes to come.  That is why we watch and that is why Episode III will surpass the original's gross because we will regretfully have to say goodbye to a masterpiece, despite its imperfections I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the series in the least bit.  It is still quite entertaining.",1037059200,,1558,4.588447653429603
1319197,4,B00003CXKT,"What can I say about Attack of the Clones?  Sure it was better than Phantom Menace, which was ultimately a kiddie flick.  But it could have been so much better.  With the exception of Ewan McGregor, the acting of the leads was just passable.  And the love story -- absurd.  The critical moment in the series: Anakin moving to the dark side?  Off screen.  Initiated by *SPOILER ALERT* a scene of zero emotional depth in which his mother dies in his arms virtually instantly after he sees her for the first time in years.  And who is it that bears the brunt of Anakin's rage?  Is it soldiers of the Republic?  The Jedi Order?  No -- just some anonymous sandpeople.  Ho hum.  If you're looking for deep psychological insight on what might turn someone from good to evil, it isn't here.  This isn't ""the Godfather.""
There are, let's face it, many problems with the plot of this series so far that diminish what should have been an epic and complex morality tale to rival the classics in the genre.  The first two and half movies in the series (let's just try to forget the Ewoks) promised as much.  These last two, Episodes I and II, have failed to live up to that promise.  Not terrible in terms of science fiction, but so disappointing in light of what could have been.  I only hope that Episode III is a much darker, complex tale told on an adult level.  Hope springs eternal.
That all being said, I can't find any fault with the presentation this movie (or Episode I) has received on DVD.  The DVD is simply breathtaking to behold.  And the action sequences and special effects, which were terrific in the theatre, lose nothing when viewed at home.  If you want to show off an expensive audio-video system, you won't do much better than this.  If only the rest of the movie were better.",1037059200,,1786,4.461300309597523
1319327,3,B00003CXKT,"Granted, ""Clones"" is better than ""Phantom Menace.""  But few things were worse than ""Phantom Menace"", so it's a loaded compliment.
The ""Clones"" DVD has a lot of the same features that saved the ""Phantom Menace"" DVD from being a waste of money:  commentaries, b-t-s effects docs, production footage, etc.  And the fact that ""Clones"" is an entirely digital production means that the picture and sound in the movie are WAY above average quality.  So from the standpoint of someone interested in how this movie was put together, this DVD is worth the purchase.
But the film itself is disappointing for a ""Star Wars"" movie, as was ""Phantom Menace"".  Like ""Phantom"", ""Clones"" is just a collection of digital effects setpieces, clunky dialogue, actors with little chemistry who look and sound bored stiff (or just plain untalented), and boring political plot exposition that will EVENTUALLY lead to the events of Episodes 4-6.  There just isn't enough captivating backstory to the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy to merit THREE prequels.  The integrity of the ""Star Wars"" franchise might have been better served by just ONE fast-paced and exciting prequel movie, rather than have Lucas spread this not-that-interesting-anyway backstory out over three films.
In the original trilogy, the special effects, groundbreaking at the time, enhanced the story.  In this new trilogy so far, the effects ARE THE ONLY REAL REASON for the films.  He's making them this way because he CAN, not because it serves to make the story any better.

I certainly don't expect the fanatical fans of Episodes 1 and 2 to agree with me on this, but a lot of older fans of the original trilogy I have spoken with sure do.  There's still time, George, to do the franchise justice with an Episode 3 that contains the elements that made 4,5,and 6 so memorable.  But effects-for-effects-sake isn't necessarily the way to go, even if it does make for a feature-loaded DVD release one day.",1037059200,2,1945,4.987616099071207
1319328,5,B00003CXKT,"First of all I didn't like how they reintroduced Anakin. They should have shown the ""aggressive negotiatios"" that he an Obe-Wan had, to prepare the audience for the semi-slow middle. The love story wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. This movie is better than Spider-Man (wich was an awesome movie as well)for two reasons: 1.) Natilie Portman and 2.) YODA!!!! I see no reason not to buy thid dvd. No, it doesn't live up to the original trilogy (what could?) but the chase scene at the beggining was awesome, and Yoda's battle with Count Dooku is a classic cinema scene that should be put in the record books as the funniest and coolest battle ever witnessed on film, and Anakin (while a little shaky in the begginning) got better with the part as the film progressed, so I think he'll be ready for the movie I've been waiting for Star Wars Episode III, wich should be a really great movie, but I don't expect it to live up to Star Wars Episode IV or Episode V, but it will surpass Episode VI I hope. My ratings for the Star Wars movies:
Episode I: 3 out of 5
Episode II: 4 out of 5
Episode III: (don't know)

Don't get me wrong, Lord of the Rings so far was awesome, but no movie as of yet has surpassed the greatness of the original Star Wars Trilogy, and I stand by that.

As a child, my happiest memories include my father coming home from work with a new Star Wars action figure for me to play with. I spent hours reenacting the movies scene-by-scene. As an adult, I have seen the trilogy more times than I can count, collected and read the books, the games, the cards, the comics, and the toys. I read everything I can about Star Wars. I even work on a Star Wars website. So, was I going to see the latest installment of the series, Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones? You bet your lightsaber I was!!
I'd seen the trailers, heard the hype, and heard the spoilers. Was I excited? You bet! Was I disappointed? NO WAY!! The grin I wore on my face began when the title lit up the screen, and didn't leave my face until the movie was over!  Now that the movie is in DVD form, I couldn't wait to check out the spectacular extras this version would provide!
The story begins 10 years after Episode I. Natalie Portman shines as Padme Amidala, who having served her 2 terms as Queen of Naboo, is now a Senator for Naboo. Now she champions the cause against the Separatists, a faction rebelling against the Republic which is led by former Jedi Count Dooku (another excellent performance by Christopher Lee). Hayden Christensen is completely believable in his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker, the padawan-who-would-be-Vader. He is joined by Ewan McGregor, who reprises his role as Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. When an assassination attempt is made on Padme's life, Chancellor Palpatine asks the Jedi Council to offer their protection, and Obi-Wan and Anakin are assigned to the case. The awesome adventure spans several worlds as we learn who has ordered the assassination attempt, watch Anakin and Padme's love grow, and watch as the Jedi and the Republic defend themselves against the Separatist army. Excellent action scenes include a fight between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, the Geonisian arena scene, and the much hyped Yoda fight scene. This movie very well may be the best of the prequel trilogy.
The DVD version contains so many extras, I couldn't manage to watch them all in the time I had to view the DVD.  However, what I did see was extremely impressive.  There are loads of deleted scenes that every Star Wars fan will enjoy seeing.  There's a portion of the mocumentary about R2D2 that is just hysterical.  There are documentaries explaining how many of the scenes were made.  Plus, the Across the Stars video, commercial clips, theatrical trailers, posters, and so much more!

I was surprised that, in spite of all the gee-wiz eye candy and dramatic action, I was bored halfway through. The movie and it's characters fail to connect with the audience. AOTC is a souless, technical excercise. The dialogue is dreadful, the pacing is, well, odd. The acting is wodden and uninspired. What a pity; I'm afraid George has lost his touch. It was like an extended cut-scene from a video game, and it looked better (the trailer, I mean) as a Quicktime video on my computer at home. I wanted to like this movie. Out of 10, I'd give it a 4. What a dissapointment.",1036713600,6,668,4.352

1319455,3,B00003CXKT,"Having just seen Attack of the clones on the big screen I felt I can now write a review, unlike some people who have seen the trailers and decided to rate this film. The fight scenes are great, no doubt about it. However the acting from some of the cast is shakey at best, Ewan is good as Obi Wan, as expected of him he delievers his character very well. The plot is better than Phantom Menace, and flows well in the film. However there is a lot of jumping to and fro from one character to another, it is almost a relief when they hooked up together. The last 30 min are the best by far, but this film is lacking an evil bad guy like the first three. Jango Fett does not live up to the hype, and Christopher Lee is only involved at the end really,there is just no Darth Vader. I think that if Mr Lucas had let someone else direct the acting would be a little better, and the heavy use of CG does not help them fit into their roles. Worth a see, but The Two Towers is still the one to wait for.",1036627200,2,993,3.97
1319456,5,B00003CXKT,"I found Episode I: The Phantom Menace to be an average movie.  And with some of the choices Lucas made (Jar Jar and Anakin) hurt the movie even a smidget more.  Episode II however, while still plagued by some corny one liners and odd dialogue I feel has recaptured the magic of Star Wars.
This movie was just fun to watch.  The first half of the movie an interesting mystery is being investigated.  And while some people would call it boring, I call it involving.  It's fun to follow the story as things are slowly unfolded.  A true sense of drama has been added to this movie compared to other Star Wars movies.  Anakin has some terrible things happening to him and you get to see how he copes with it.  The story is very moving at times.  This is helped alot by John Williams new theme for Star Wars.  It's the love song of Episode II.  And it has all of the grandeur of the original Star Wars Theme.  It really fits in with the old music, and is very beautiful and epic sounding.
By the end of the film you are really treated to a huge visual and emmotional assault on your senses.  The Good Jedi come to the rescue of Obi-Wan and friends in a rush of adrenaline and heated CGI glory.  It's truely a great moment in the Star Wars Saga and I went back to the theater 3 or 4 times to witness it.  Along with some of the films other stand out moments.  Including Anakin's Revenge, his breakdown, and ofcourse all bow down to Yoda!  Oh my God can that old guy get down with his bad self.  When did Yoda learn Jedi Kung-fu?
In conclusion.  This film, if you are at all interested in action adventures (obviously Star Wars fans already have seen the movie) then you should not pass this one up.  It has alot of memberable scenes, some great action, great drama, and moving music.  This movie, is a great Summer Blockbuster.  And truely a fun movie to watch.

1319458,5,B00003CXKT,"The fifth Star Wars movie ever, and the second prequel to the original, taking place 10 years after the events of Episode I, and would have to be considered a dark chapter in the series. The first Star Wars is IV (4) in the series, and Episode II fills in more of the blanks, and does one ... of a job doing it.
With multiple planets breaking away from the Republic to form a Confederacy of Independent Systems, among them, the Trade Federation, who were aggressors in the last episode, the idea of war seems inevitable. Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), now a senator for Naboo, now finds her life in danger. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), now a Jedi Knight, and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), his apprentice, are assigned to protect her. After a second attempt on Padme's life is made, Obi-Wan and Anakin take off after the assassin in hot pursuit, only to have the assassin killed by the person who subcontracted her in the first place. Obi-Wan then gets some info from a contact on Coruscant, and takes off to find the real assassin, leaving Anakin, already growing resentful of his master, alone to guard Padme. They go to Naboo, Padme's homeworld, to stay in seclusion. However, she doesn't count on Anakin falling for her, and even though she claims that they have their seperate worlds, she can't deny the connection she feels toward him. One thing is already clear, Anakin begins to feel the pull of the Dark Side, not realizing what will become of him, and what impact he will have in the years to come. The growing attraction between Anakin and Padme will also have a huge impact on the fate of the galaxy.
Not only that, the Dark Side has grown stronger, to the point where Yoda, a Jedi master, can't foresee the future. The Jedi connection to the Force begins to weaken as well. Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), a leader on the Jedi council, makes it clear that even though the Jedi are strong, they are not only spread too thin, but there are too few to keep control. The possibility of an Army of the Republic isn't far off, but Padme resists the idea, preferring to rely on diplomacy. What Obi-Wan discovers on the planet Kamino will have one ... of an impact on the coming conflict between the Republic and the Confederacy, and will ultimately split the galaxy. When it all comes down to it, Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Padme will find themselves on the planet Geonosis, and the real game will begin.
From another standpoint, this DVD is the first-ever truly digital DVD, with multiple extras. True movie fanatics will crave it. The story involving Anakin and Padme seems a little dry, and I think some of the dialogue should've been written differently. The movie itself has no shortage of action, even more so than Episode I. This time, Obi-Wan is given way more to do, but I think that Mace Windu should have been a more prominent character instead of just being a supporting actor.
Either way, you can't deny the genius of George Lucas, nor can you deny how much Attack of the Clones fits in to the Star Wars legacy. I assure you, get this DVD, and you won't be sorry.",1036454400,,3089,4.587703435804702

1319579,1,B00003CXKT,"but it has. Lucas has released a movie WORSE than The Phantom Menace. Let's start with the title. We knew it was gonna be bad when it was annouced as Attack of the Clones. I mean, jeez, 50s B-movies had better names. This movie is too long and poorly edited. It jumps from scene to scene in a way that just drove me nuts. Also Lucas crammed in a bunch of ""romantic"" scenes that make to movie far too log and make Anakin and Padme seem like they want eachother's bodies and not eachother's hearts. The lack of acting in this movie is amazing. In a scene Anain tells Padme he's murdered an entire village and she doesn't look phased in the slightest. The plot was utter [garbage] too. I mean, for God sakes, JAR JAR IS RESPOSIBLE FOR THE RISE OF THE EMPIRE?!?!?!? The rustraunt scene with Obi Wan and the 4 armed....thing was particularly stupid. If i want to seen. If I want to see American Graffiti, i'll rent it, i don't need to see a 50s diner in Star Wars. Jango Fett is even lamer than Darth maul. Abot as much charactr development and and even more pathertic death. Like Phantom Menae this movie relies to much on special effects, unfortunately they're not as good as they could be and many times the live action and CGI do not blend right. All in all this is a really boring movie that does not deserve to be called Star Wars. The only good to come from it was Yoda's fight scene which is truely impressive",1036281600,9,1412,4.292134831460674
1319580,3,B00003CXKT,"I feel like I keep waiting for Lucas to be BRILLIANT though, and this just isn't. Keep in mind, I say this all with the absolute understanding that I'll take a weak Star Wars movie over 99% of the rest of the garbage out there, any day of the week.
1. George Lucas needs to hire someone to redraft his script in THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY. Although Lucas's imagination is second to none (in my opinion) and he can come up with a very creative story, he just simply, try as he might, cannot write dialogue. Everyone comes off almost tripping over his or her lines, none of it sounds natural and none of it flows.
2. I think that Lucas has become WAY too obsessed with visual effects. That said, his ILM team is STAGGERINGLY good at it, but I almost get the feeling that Lucas is trying too hard to fit the script into the story-board instead of taking his story-board from the script. There has to be a balance and I think it's way lop-sided here.
3. Hayden Christensen looks like a reject from Dawson's Creek and, frankly, doesn't seem to be a very good actor.
4.  Speaking of which, Lucas is under-using Natile Portman to the point of it being criminal.  She is an OUTSTANDING young actress, and yet the only close-ups she seems to earn are pleas for help in some way or another.  I'm frustrated that we know VERY little about this young woman that Darth Vader had fallen for when there seems to be a ton of her back-story that's RIGHT THERE to be explored.
5. I also kind of get the impression Lucas is trying really hard to make these movies too kid-friendly. Not that I'm looking for flat out violence or gore, but there were a couple instances where I thought they might really be able to explore Anakin's moving to the dark-side and didn't take advantage of it. He seems to be forgetting that the audience knows that Anakin eventually winds up eventually decimating the Jedi order. It's a lot less important that we ""like"" him as it is we understand what he is going through.
That's about it; I did enjoy the movie, 3 stars out of 5. I now have all my hopes pinned to episode III. In order of the Republic to be in the state it's in by the time ep IV takes place, something really REALLY bad has to happen in the next movie.",1036108800,,2226,4.307875894988067
1319581,3,B00003CXKT,"...like the clone makers were. No questions asked, free hand and all that. No wonder they look so serene and plesant doing the work of the Dark Side.
You know the story; if you don't, there are plenty of folks who have written good synopsises of it. This is strictly for people who want my 2 cents:
Is this film better than Episode 1? Yes. We've taken care of all the introductions in the first film and can get down to business here. While I'm sure some liked the cutesy kids in the first film, I preferred all the main characters to be grown (the exception to this is of course Boba Fett; this kid has more talent than all the child actors in the first movie put together. I haven't seen such grim determination in a character since Omen 2).
One of the problems, as I see it, is that Lucas seems to have forgotten how to tie his films together. This was somewhat apparent in Return of the Jedi, and has continued to get worse in the prequels. I know you might say it's the editors, but nothing leaves Skywalker Ranch without George's stamp of approval.
The other is characters and the people hired to play them. When I took my wife to see the film, many of the audience laughed during the romance scenes. She wondered why. I explained that Christensen's acting was, to say the least, cheesy.
Add to that the continued existence of Jar-Jar and I can't in all honesty say I really enjoyed this film. Except for when Samuel L. Jackson de-headified Jango. That was very cool.
Finally, Mr. Lucas can explain away SW story/historical inconsistancies that he created saying it's not literal and that
things will be explained later, but why? Where's the benefit to the audience? Some say I should be less critical since it's HIS film and we should be grateful for such an imagination. To this I say ...!!! He doesn't make these films just for himself, or he'd be doing it with a Super 8 anf have them on his den shelves, bringing them out on holidays when he has guests. He wants us to see his vision, but let's face it: it's ours now as well. He needs to respect that to a certain extent.
3 stars is what I can honestly give this film. Hopefully, the third and last film will finally live up to my expectations (and others).",1035936000,6,2219,4.388349514563107
1319582,1,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones has none of the charm of the originals and is a truly awful movie, the one that will surely turn off many Star Wars fans to the whole series.  Essentially, it is George Lucas's ego run amok, and shows how he has surrounded himself with a bunch of sycophants not willing to tell the billionaire that he's lost his art for storytelling.  If you want to play a videogame, go ahead and play one.  But this movie is nothing but a glorified videogame, where the special effects have taken over, and all human elements have been lost.  Essentially, the empire has won: the machines rule this universe now.  Fine actors like Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman are completely wasted with ridiculous, stilted dialog.  The romance is thrust into the movie with no buildup, and no logical or believable progression.  ""Oh, you just slaughtered a bunch of sand people?  Well, that really makes me want to love you!""  Don't waste your time on this film.  Hopefully low sales will give Lucas the hint that the next movie needs to return to real acting and mythic storytelling, and lose the emphatuation with ILM.  Make it dark and fun like Empire, and close it out.  Please.",1035936000,10,1178,4.63768115942029
1319583,2,B00003CXKT,"A couple of years ago, George Lucas continued his legendary ""Star Wars"" saga by releasing ""Episode I: The Phantom Menace"", the first of three prequels to the original trilogy. To almost everyone's disappointment, ""Episode I"" was nothing more than a tech demo showcasing amazing special-effects but very little plot, characterization, or acting. Because ""Episode I"" was so forgettable, Lucas knew he had to get ""Episode II"" right or else everyone would think ""Star Wars"" would be considered dead. So he made sure ""Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" had what ""Phantom Menace"" lacked: an interesting plot and action galore. Sadly, while ""Episode II"" is unquestionably better than ""Episode I"", ""Attack of the Clones"" is still nothing more than a tech demo.
Unlike ""Episode I"", which dealt with politics, ""Episode II"" deals with Anakin Skywalker's growth, his forbidden love for Queen Amidala, and how he grows ever closer to the Dark Side of the Force. While this is going on, there are mysterious things happening, including the build-up of a clone army and a possible threat to the Alliance. Sounds interesting, right? The question is: where did it go wrong?
First things first: Hayden Christensen cannot act to save his life! He speaks in such a monotonous and flat tone that you cannot help but grind your teeth in agony. Hearing him say things like, ""I'm sorry, Master"" and ""I'm going to be the greatest Jedi"" shows just how much effort he put into his character: none. Heck, even Mark Hamil acted better in ""A New Hope"" than Christensen did in ""Attack of the Clones"".
Other than Christensen, however, the other actors gave very convincing performances. Ewan McGregor, who sounded just like Christensen in ""Phantom Menace"", has actually managed to pull of a near-perfect Alec Guiness accent and has improved upon his character remarkably. Natalie Portman sounded bored in ""Menace"", but actually appears a lot more interested in ""Clones"" and gives a lot more depth to her character. And the ever-great Christopher Lee deserves high points as yet another great bad guy.
Still, even all of this talen won't do anyone any good if the script is as bad as the one found in ""Clones""!
Seriously, the script in ""Episode II"" is horrendous. Nobody would ever say the things found in this movie. Phrases sound either completely out of place or are blatantly obvious (""A poison dart"") that it's easy to tell that George Lucas marketed this movie to 12-year old boys (which is actually true). And another thing: Lucas cannot write a love story. All of the love scenes between Christensen and Portman were cheesy, ridiculous, and just plain irritating. And with Christensen's acting (or lack thereof), phrases like ""I don't like sand"" sound horrible. Simply put, the script was possibly the biggest downfall of ""Clones"" other than Christensen's acting.
As for the special-effects...well, what's to say? They look fantastic, as is expected with Lucas, who seems to care about the CGI more than the actors. Almost every scene in ""Clones"" is filmed with a blue-screen, and because of this there are many cases of emotionless acting from the characters. How can there be emotion when actors have no background other than a blue-screen? Lucas made this mistake in ""Phantom Menace"", and now ""Clones"" has to suffer because of it as well.
But was there anything memorable here? Surprisingly, yes. There's the famous scene where Yoda fights with a lightsaber, as well as a few scenes with Jango Fett and the arena with hundreds of Jedi. Unlike ""Menace"", Lucas actually managed to craft some memorable moments from ""Clones"".
Overall, ""Attack of the Clones"" can be seen as a checklist for all of the loose ends leading up to the first movie in the original trilogy. Everything felt so forced and contrived and the memorable moments were hardly enough to offset the terrible script and Christensen's sour acting. All Lucas had to do was make ""Episode II"" better than ""Episode I"", and he succeeded, but unfortunately he didn't do anything else.",1035763200,5,4016,4.995522388059701
1319584,3,B00003CXKT,"If one word could describe the movie it would be: Forshadowing.  You know what's gonna happen, so what's the point of watching the movie?  However, it does have some nice special effects and action scenes.  ""Size Matters Not"" is a line used by Yoda and he proves it by having a lightsaber duel with a sith lord (i forgot his name)
  Anakin goes mad when his mother, captured by the Sand People, dies in his arms and he slaughters the sand people camp.  This is the first showing that Anakin has inner demons.  He gets married to Aimada (spelling?) at the end.  Something is missing here, but i don't see what. It's better than the Phantom Menace, but only just so.  Jar Jar Binks is also in it, although he's not as annoying as he was in espiode 1.",1035763200,4,748,4.323741007194244
1319585,5,B00003CXKT,"Not only is this chapter in the saga a huge improvement over Episode I, it compliments it enormously. The Phantom Menace was unfairly panned due to the overblown hype and expectation for the film. Sure it had flaws in both acting and plot, but so did the original Star Wars. Critics scoffed at that film in 1977 only to see it set box office records and attain pop culture immortality. And now, with the internet and sixteen years of waiting, every move George Lucas makes is under intense scrutiny. The man can do no right in most people's eyes. He's a victim of his own success. In Episode II, Lucas not only demonstrates are more apt hand in storytelling, but manages to deliver a dramatic punch along with all the eye-popping visuals. Anakin's first step towards the dark side is chilling and poignant. And the battle sequences are some of the finest in the Star Wars saga. Yes, the romantic storyline is clunky, and lacks the charm of Empire, but it's adequate. Overall, Clones is a fine addition to the saga and as I said before compliments Menace. A painting can't be judged solely on one portion of the canvas. Lucas is near completion of his space fantasy epic.

1319676,5,B00003CXKT,"I thought the idea of ""Star Wars"" prequels was a bad one. I couldn't have been more wrong.
""Phantom Menace"" made me think they might be pretty good after all, but it was ""Attack of the Clones"" that convinced me. Brimming over with intrigue, action, and an all-too-human love story, the second film in the Star Wars Saga is the best one yet.
Two independent plot threads weave through the film's narrative, colliding in a massive battle-royal at the picture's end. Each storyline is satisfying in its own right - whether you're watching Obi-Wan Kenobi investigate the mysterious clones, or Anakin Skywalker coming to grips with his past and present, you get a full movie within a movie!
Plus, ""Attack of the Clones"" refreshes our affection for characters from the other films in the series. See-Threepio is at his best, providing uproariously funny slapstick. Jango Fett (as a substitute for his son, Boba) provides the thrill of a mysterious, competent soldier-of-fortune, and contributes to some of the coolest action sequences in the whole Saga.
But the best surprise is how Yoda deals with the nefarious Count Dooku!
Character relationships are fleshed out, and ominous hints to the identity of the evil mastermind Darth Sidious make it almost impossible to wait for Episode !  (I used exclamation points because I'm so excited)
The special effects go beyond anything we've ever seen before, and I can't wait to watch them on a crisp DVD.
As a DVD, ""Attack of the Clones"" is sure to be as tremendous as its predecessor. I'll have to plan an entire weekend of combing through the bonus material, because I want to be an expert in every process George Lucas used to craft this incredible space fantasy!",1035504000,,1703,4.872413793103449
1319677,5,B00003CXKT,"There you have it. You know I'm biased. So is this really an objective review? Proabably not. Ahhhh, that being said I can say whatever I like - right?
I was 6 when Episode IV, A New Hope, came out in theaters, and I was instantly transported into a world that I would know for the rest of my life. I won't bore you with the details of how my entire childhood through Episode VI (Jedi) was saturated with Star Wars toys, videos, games, etc. (or did I already?).
I'm now 31, and not only did I attend the Star Wars Celebration II in Indianapolis (what a geek!!), but I also stood in line for the midnight showing of Episode II. My life pretty much revolved around the opening of yet another Star Wars movie. There was such anticipation - so much time between Episode VI and I, and now for Episode II, and then for Episode III - AGHHHH. I think most obsessed fans (like me) are like this, and I think most people who aren't as connected with these movies get sick of the hype and the fans talking about them. Add into that media coverage and promos - and you get the impression that if you don't see this 'earth-shattering' movie - you'll be less for it.
The truth is, the new Star Wars movies are still the same type/quality of movies they have always been. It's just around ten years later than the originals, and we've all changed a little. We don't get as impressed by movies the same ways we used to. Lucas compensates for this a bit with the added digital effects, but in keeping true to the originals, a lot of the style is still grounded in that original movie.
To cut to the chase: If you are an obsessed Star Wars fan - you've probably already seen this movie at least 3 or 4 times, and getting the DVD is like buying gas for your car - you just have to do it. If you 'saw' the films and remember bits and pieces of them and kinda have a good feeling about the whole thing, and aren't too critical of movies - you'll have a great time watching this new Star Wars movie. (Rent the others to watch before you see this one and it'll make more sense).
If you are an insane movie buff, and aren't connected to the Star Wars saga, and like to dissect movies in regards to dialogue, developed plot, character development, brilliant acting - you're going to be disappointed and wonder what the insane buzz is all about. Go rent Life as a House (an excellent movie by the way).
In closing, I'd like to just reiterate what George Lucas said he was originally trying to create: A new kind of fairy tale. That's exactly what these films are - fairy-tale-type stories - nothing else. With that approach in mind, I've certainly been captivated over these 25 years by this story, and hopefully my son will be too.
Enjoy, and May the Force.......ah I can't rembmer how that goes...

1319682,3,B00003CXKT,"Despite the fact I am a self admitted Star Wars nut, I am going to resist getting into a love fest over this movie simply because it is a Star Wars movie.
Whereas the cumbersome Phantom Menace was unwieldy under its own weight and really let's face facts folks - it really blew, George Lucas thankfully took the criticism to heart and corrected many of the problems with Episode One. Hopefully he paid attention to the problems people had with this episode, because let's face it the more we constructively criticize the show, the better the chances are we really will get an incredible episode three.
On with the review. I really did enjoy this show, particularly the evolving love story between Padme and Anakin. I think the presence of a romantic backstory has been a sorely missing element of the Star Wars movies since The Empire Strikes Back and although it is a truly crucial element of the overall story here it is treated with passion and care. Despite the fact that Natalie Portman has lost that ""squeeky clean"" image since this movie opened, she really turns in a great performance here.
Another improvement on TPM is a more involved role for Ewan McGregor as Ben Kenobi. It's remarkable how much McGregor really looks like a younger version of Alec Guinness and he seems to have the mannerisms down pat.
Another welcome addition to the cast is the always great Christopher Lee as Count Dooku.
Now onto the points where Attack of the Clones has problems. The obvious and easiest target is the wooden dialogue. I hope Lucas brings in a tried and tested scriptwriter into the next episode to help clean up the dialogue. The other fault (and this is purely in my opinion) is the over reliance on CGI technology. I know a lot of people where blown away by the special effects, but it seems that the newer Star Wars movies are all about special effects. What made the originals so charming was the fact that it followed the adventures of a group of characters we cared about in three movies that happened to contain some groundbreaking (for the time) effects.
I may seem harsh on this movie but for a couple of hours of entertainment you certainly can do worse than pick up a copy of Attack of the Clones.",1035331200,4,2211,4.6
1319683,3,B00003CXKT,"Ok- Let's make a few points about this movie:
1. The WHOLE Star Wars Saga is overhyped.
2. Lucas cannot write and he cannot direct. He seems to view every movie he directs in this series as a part of a sextuplet group of babies without any personalities of their own, character exploration, or cohesive plot. He doesn't care enough about the talented group of actors he accumulates to give them a script worth repeating or enough freedom to explore their characters without the hype over their heads. It's a shame because it's an ingenious concept of a series, but none of the movies stand on their own as quality works and they should be able to do so.
3. Thus, one can hardly blame the actors (too much) for their wooden performances. Although, I will say that Hayden's more emphatic (at times) performance was hurt by Natalie's tendency to be monotone and downplay her character's emotions. People criticized him, because he played it more up then she did, so they noticed it more, but Natalie shares half the blame for the lameness of the romance. Hayden, in my opinion has more than what it takes to bring this role to the screen. If you've seen him in Life As A House, you know what I'm talking about. Where's Irwin Winkler when you need him? Hayden is a young actor, who had his first starring role (this was done before LAAH, but released after it) in a Star Wars movie for goodness sake. It's too much to live up to and he had very little help from Lucas.
4. If Yoda is 900 yrs old, how does he kick booty like that?;)
5. British actors are always good to have in any movie (Ewen McGregor,etc.)
6. Jar Jar will die in the next movie. Yeah!!!
7. Overall, I think it was a so-so on the objective scale, but for some reason, I did take a liking to it. I think the broad sweeping mythology comes across very well in a general if not specific sense in this movie. By the by, I will say that no movie has as great an opening title sequence as the Star Wars movies. It makes you feel like you're about to see something important...too bad the actual experience doesn't live up to it. A good popcorn flick just like its predecessors. Nothing more. We'll see about the last (3rd) one.",1035244800,,2184,4.3817733990147785
1319684,2,B00003CXKT,"This movie is so sappy I want to throw up. It was so dumb when Yoda fought bent lightsaber-boy. I'm sure, his walking around with this stick then his jumping around the place.

1319762,5,B00003CXKT,"I've been going through some of these reviews and I can't believe what some of you are saying. This is a great film, and anyone who doesn't think so is not a true Star Wars fan. This films' got great special effects, amazing action sequences and an interesting storyline. If there wasn't a love story in this episode, where do you think Luke and Leia would come from. It wouldn't make much sense if all of the sudden Padme had babies in the next episode without us knowing how she and Anakin fell in love, that would be stupid.
Okay, maybe some of the dialogue is a little corny in some parts, but who really cares, if you come to see a Star Wars movies for its great dialogue then you are missing the point. If you are you still complaining about Jar Jar, give it a break, he's only in this movie for like 5 minutes.
I loved this movie from beginning to end, from the sky chase on Coruscant to the beginning of the Clone War. It was great seeing Lars Homestead again and Artoo and Threepio going on their first adventure together. Seeing all of those hundreds of Jedi fighting in the arena was amazing. I really liked The Phantom Menace, but I have to say this one is better. For those of you who don't like the new Star Wars movies, I can guarantee you will 20 years from now, probably even more than the original. You should really charish these movies, because they are classics and you will realize it in years from now.
I got Episode I on DVD, and I don't regret it at all, it is the greatest DVD I have ever seen, and Episode II will be just as great. This movie is going to look amazing since it was shot on digital and transfered digitally to DVD, it's going to look incredible. I am definately going to be first in line to buy this DVD on the morning of November 12th, and I recommend everyone else do the same.",1035244800,,1821,4.2206303724928365
1319763,5,B00003CXKT,"After the somewhat disappointing ""Phantom Menace"", George Lucas satisfies the intergalactic craving in all of us, with this triumphant chapter of the ""Star Wars"" saga.

Ten years have passed since we last saw Anakin Skywalker.  Anakin longs to be freed from the over-possessive Jedi grasps.  Anakin's love for Padm Amidala is growing, and with the Jedi reluctant to let the romance blossom, Anakin's frustration boils.  Yoda, and other members of the Jedi Council sense Anakin's frustration, and this worries them.

A faction of political separatists, led by Count Dooku, attempts to assassinate Padm Amidala (now Senator). Since there aren't enough Jedi to defend the Republic against the threat, Chancellor Palpatine enlists the aid of Jango Fett, who promises that his army of clones will handle the situation.

Obi-Wan is sent to the planet of Kamino where he will investigate. While Obi-Wan investigates, he discovers that there is more than meets the eye behind an assassination attempt on Senator Padm Amidala's life. Little does he know, he is investigating some of the biggest events of the Star Wars saga, as he finds out that there is a connection between the assassination attempts and a separatists movement led by a former Jedi (Christopher Lee) against the Republic. The Galactic Republic finds itself at the brink of a civil war.

As Anakin is left behind to protect Padm, his feelings for her grow into something more than friendship. From Naboo to Tatooine, it grows into love for her. But when a tragedy strikes Anakin's life, he begins slipping away from the Light Side of the Force, and perhaps from the Force itself.

""Attach of the Clones"" contains the stunning action sequences, and breath-taking special effects that we have grown to love from the ""Star Wars"" movies.

The end result?

We are left with a fantastic voyage to a galaxy far, far away.",1035244800,,1873,5.032362459546926

With out revealing any spoilers, this movies reveals things you probaly would have never thought of.  there is to much action to describe in this breif review but belive me, your jaw will drop when you watch the first battle of the clone wars, or when Yoda draws his lightsaber about to attack Datrth Tyranus, the second most powerful sith lord ever!!!!
all of the actors do a prtetty good job in character.  the special effects of this movie are amaing.  Yoda is entirly digital, no more puppet!!!  he looks so real and yet....  Lucas does a better job than i could have imagined!!!!!!
dont forget to buy the soundtrack, the very back bone of star wars is the music, after episode 1, i thought that there was nothing that john willams could have done that would be original and unique, but i was shocked when i bought the sound track.  Over all, i hope that you buy this movie and if you like love storys, action, mystery, and war in a scifi style, this is a movie for you.",1035244800,,1316,4.386831275720165

I figure that Lucas has several things he has to include in the last of the prequals to even remotely tie them to the orginals.
1.the birth of luke and Leia
2.what happens to padmie
3.the falling out with Obie-one
4.the seperation of luke and Leia
5.the turning of Anakin
and I'd like to see the orgins of Han Solo. Granted it's been some months since I seen the film and I know I had one more thing that was a "" like to see in the third film"" but I can't recall it right now. None the less I'm going to see the third film before I make a call on one triogly verse the other. I still thought this movie moved too slow for my taste. Hell, it was alot weaker than PHM outside of finally seeing Yoda with a light saber.

1319766,5,B00003CXKT,"To start off, let me say that I liked Episode 1, just not as much as any movie from the first trilogy.  However, Attack of the Clones is equal to 4, 5, and 6.  It is a thrill-a-minute adventure with two seperate stories (like Empire Strikes Back)that eventually come together.  And, for the first time, we see the Jedi doing what they've only been described to do, or in small 1-on-1 or 2-on-1 fights: a giant Jedi battle full of glowing lightsabers!  And, we finally find out how Yoda got his status as the greatest Jedi ever.  I still remember the first time I saw this, some kid yelled out ""Kick his [butt], Yoda"", right before he drew his lightsaber.  Obi-Wan's detective story is very cool, and the planet Kamino is amazingly beautiful in a strange sort of way.  Anakin and Padm's love story is a little flawed, but that's okay.  And, as usual, we have R2-D2 and C-3PO doing what they do best: acting silly.  Finally, there are many references to ""A New Hope"", ""Empire Strikes Back"", and ""Return of the Jedi"", which give us explanations as to why some things are the way the are.  If you like Star Wars, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.  Even if you don't, you may still be intrigued.",1035072000,,1198,4.4
1319767,5,B00003CXKT,"Hello everyone, can I start out by saying WAKE UP! Episode II was given an unfair amount of criticism from the very begining (thanks to all the internet spoilers). How in the world can Episode II's detractors possibly enjoy a movie when it has been preceeded by three of the greatest science-fiction films ever made? Anyway, my impression of Episode II is this: I was very happy and close to tears to have finally witnessed the clone wars that was hinted at in the introduction of the 1st novel STAR WARS (i.e. ""Journal of the whills"").  Also, how can anyone NOT be effected by seeing the 800 yr. old Jedi Master kick some Count Dooku [rear-end]? I feel the reviewers who gave it less than four stars, simply expect too much. Mr. Lucas is the visionary who gave the film industry the blue-prints of ""the Block-buster"".  It is hypocritical of the fans to ""bash"" his latest installments, saying it's not ""as good"" as such and such film... if it were not for George Lucas, chances are great that such and such film might never have been! Oh by the way, in response to the reviewer from Whitefish, MT... Owen and Beru are NOT Luke Skywalker's foster parents... He is their step-nephew.

1319768,3,B00003CXKT,"In case you were wondering, by 'Star Wars' standards, this movie wasn't that great.  No, it's not as good as the original trilogy (which by the way is slated for release on DVD after epIII comes out), but YES it is better than ep1.  Ep1 was simply too childish for me, Jar Jar Binks?? Jar Jar wasn't that bad for me, it was just ANAKIN.  ""Yippee, Whoo-hoo!"" = GAG.  I must say however, that if you HATED Jar Jar, you'll just find more reason to hate him in this movie, for he does something so incredibly stupid you'll realize he was actually an important piece of the plot.  Hayden Christensen gave a much better performance in 'Life as a House"", here he just seems wooden, although he does have his acting moments.  Obi-Wan is more fatherly and Padme Amidala mysteriously hasn't aged a day. (10 years have passed since ep1).  I read on the 'net that this was one of the best digital transfers to DVD yet seen, so i look forward to it.  The 'love' scenes in this movie were heart-stoppingly horrendous (I am haunted by the kiss you should not have given me???? My god I could write a better script)  But once Lucas drives the movie to the point where he's best at (Action, Action and more Action) this movie runs wild.  The greatest scenes in the movie mysteriously all involve Jango Fett.  From the first battle between him and Obi-Wan to (the best scene in the movie, and will KILL most subwoofers) the chase through the asteroid field.  And for those people who though that Yoda was just a mentor, think again.  He knows his stuff.  I will buy this DVD, maybe not before i buy Spider-Man and DEFINETLY not before i buy The Lord Of The Rings Extended DVD Edition, but it will eventually land in my collection, for it is Star Wars, and for no other reason.",1034985600,3,1758,4.402476780185759

The dialogue in all the Star Wars films is campy, but in 2002 it didn't work for today's more ""sophisticated"" reviewers. This film is a non-stop action adventure for every age.

The love scenes were like a page from a bad romance novel..they should have been discreet and the dialogue less sappy. Also Hayden Christenson was only ok as Anakin, he seemed unable to truly portray the passion and conflict Anakin would have experienced. Admit it..the scene where he was having a nightmare was the worst acting you have seen.
The audience would laugh at many points during the movie where you weren't supposed to laugh. The fight scene at the end barely saved it and even then it was inferior to the fight scene in Phantom Menace. We knew things were going downhill when they ""redid"" the originals and not in a good way.

There's one thing that makes the three first movies unique, and that is the care they took to make things apear real with so limited tools. But it looks better than the computer generated spaceships with little or no detail.
The music wasn't that good also.  It looks as if they didn't have time to work on it and started making a mix of every theme they had in the previous movies.
There are things that doesn't make sense in the story, like 3PO working with Anakin's mother (and Owen and Beru Lars) and they didn't remember him when they bought him a second time.
Jedi are not as great and powerful as I expected and battle sequences weren't as good as Phantom Menace ones. I'm even starting to think that Phantom Menace was better.

 To sum it all up, George Lucas and whatever creative team he assembles, will never be able to live up to the name Star Wars. He can add to it all he wants, but he'll never re-create it and could never take away from it. To hold up the new trilogy to the old trilogy is really unfair as it would be unfair to anything we hold up to it.
 Above all, he's created excitement, an overall good feeling. The excitement created could be felt when you used to pray for a toy commercial just to catch a glimpse of which toys you could use in your own intergalatic civil war. To me, the day Jedi came out in 1983, was bigger than christmas.
 I stood in line for 13 hours in 97 degree temperatures to see a midnight showing of Episode I. And all things considered was really blown away. I stood in line with a friend in Chicago for 4 hours in 32 degree temperature to buy a ticket to Monsters Inc. just to see the Trailer. THE TRAILER!!! And when I got up to walk out of Monsters Inc. We weren't alone.
 I was working at a small theater in Mo. at the time of this movie's release and I'll never forget the feeling of dread I had to have to tell small children that they would have to come back tomorrow because we had sold out. From their response, you'd think someone told them that they weren't going to have a birthday this year. But to actually see people lined up 4 and 5 hours in advance was almost a bit comforting to know that its not just me who feels this way. And these people were standing in the rain and there was no where else they'd rather be.
 ""But what about Jar Jar"" or ""Jar Jar ruined everything!"" you say? Well, ya know what? I hated Jar Jar too. Still do, but hey, the ewoks always annoyed me and I love Jedi. Heck, Empire is my favorite one and 40% of it is Mark Hamill running around with a puppet voiced by Frank Oz. There were parts of the old trilogy that all of us can do without, granted they were few and far between but there still there.
 As for episode II, Loved it. It was worth the wait from Episode I. George really outdid himself. Ewan McGregor is a [tough guy] picking up where Alec Guiness left off, I think he has raised his status as an actor entirely. Natalie Portman is stunning and Brilliant.
 So for all the would be nay sayers who think that the sky is falling. Sit down, fetch out your old Princess Leia's (If your sister didn't pull the heads off) pull up a chair,be a kid again.

And the acting of episode 2:superb. That's right, superb. Just because people relate Ewan McGregor (one of the most gifted actors of our time) to his days in Trainspotting doesn't mean he can't pull off a younger Alec Guiness so perfect that it would be impossible to be any better. And the love scenes: i think they're great and any person who thinks they're badly acted, watch ""Titanic"",one of the greatest love movies ever made, and compare it to that which is sometimes poorly acted if you're too harsh on it. quit crying and don't critique each star wars movie, but accept them all as one of the greatest sagas evr to be invented. a saga that encompass all raw emotions:love, hate, loyalty, betrayal, and coming to grips on our own destiny.",1034640000,,1463,4.652509652509653

When I watch the original Star Wars Trilogy and then think of this steaming pile of ..., I wonder how George Lucas could have fallen so hard. This movie is wretched. It is awful. It is horrible. There simply isn't an adjective that could accurately describe how gut-wrenchingly bad this movie is. I hated every simpering, whining second of it. I'm shocked that I actually sat through it all.
  I'm convinced that as George Lucas wrote this screenplay, he kept a compendium of clichs next to him to refer to (if such a thing exists). Periodically, he would stop and flip through the book just to make sure that he was using every clich known to man. My personal favorite is when Count Dooku captures Obi Wan and says, ""Join me Obi Wan and together we will destroy the Sith."" It's almost impossible to count just how many movies have a scene where the bad guy captures the good guy and says, ""Join me and we will blah blah blah [fill in your own evil goal here]."" Good job, George. That's never been done before.
  What further amazes me that George Lucas could write dialogue so inane and horrific, he actually managed to make great actors like Ewan McGregor, Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson look bad. I've heard many people criticize Hayden Christensen's performance but I don't think that's entirely fair. The script was so poorly written that Christensen didn't have a chance with it. Lawrence Olivier couldn't have looked good speaking that dialogue.
  And then there's the special effects which look like someone have Ed Wood some high-tech equipment. I figured even if the movie was terrible, the special effects would be great. After all, that was where most of the movie's hype came from. The effects were going to be stupendous, wonderful, incredible...Right? WRONG. Most of this movie looks like a cartoon. Not once do the special effects ever look real in any way. The effects in the original trilogy are far better. What made the effects look truly horrible were some of the other movies released before and after Episode II. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Lord of the Rings and Minority Report all had special effects vastly superior to the overhyped computer generated mess that was Episode II.
  I don't know how the DVD is. I don't have it and would be ashamed to own it. It looks like it's loaded with special features but considering how revolting the movie was, how good could the special features really be? Who really wants to see how a bad movie was made?

From the fight scenes to the love scenes to the special effects, every part of this episode far exceeded the accomplishments all of the other movies combined! In their genius, they have managed to take each episodes steps beyond any other movie ever made at the time.
Don't get me wrong! George has true competition for the throne with the creators of Lord of the Rings and I would not even dream of comparing the two. But within the Star Wars Universe/Genre, George delivered more in this movie than he EVER has! So if you loved any of the Star Wars episodes, you're just plain crazy if you didn't find this episode the best one yet!

EMOTION!!
Not that there isn't any, but the movie jumps around and moves so quickly that the moments that you should grow empathy and sympathy for the characters are lost in uncomfortable mood changes and poor scripting.
My opinion on special effects are that they should only be used when absolutely necessary.  The original Star Wars movies were done primarily with models and tedious work.  Yet, LOOKED REAL!!  CGI used in excess looks ridiculous.  As do these movies.
STAR WARS, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK & RETURN OF THE JEDI were such hits because the audience cared!  And they cared because at that time, Lucas seemed to realize that you had to develop a personal relationship with the audience.  The audience has to know and care for the characters.
These new movies don't have that.  Not any fault to the actors.  But, it seems that Lucas has forgotten that.  He seems to be having so much fun playing with all his High dollar gadgets, that he forgot how to tell an effective story.",1034467200,,1240,4.694444444444445

Yet, it's still a satisfying romp and, convincingly, sets up the story for the dramatic events of Episode III.  The attention to detail, both digitally and plot-wise, is superb.  The fight scenes involving the Jedi knights, both known and unknown, are a treat.  Mostly, however, you get to witness the progressing downfall of the would-be ""Chosen One,"" Anakin Skywalker, his spiral toward the Dark Side, and the unraveling of the Republic before Palpatine becomes a ruthless Emperor that only a hopeful yet outmatched Rebellion can overthrow.
Anyone who pans this movie, or the previously released ""Phantom Menace,"" is plagued by unrealistic expectations.  These stalwart pessimists wanted George Lucas to recreate the magic and intensity of the original Star Wars saga, so that they could relive the thrill of seeing, for the first time, something that had never been done before, that had never been seen before. The most interesting space flick pre-dating the original ""Star Wars"" was ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  While 2001 is a masterpiece in its own right, it was a plodding, cerebral speculation at the future of human discovery.  ""Star Wars"" had everything: action, adventure, romance.  It was the quintessential movie, followed up by awe-inspiring sequels complete with unpredictable revelations.  Episodes I and II are NOT SUPPOSED TO BE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINALS.  I don't even care that they are not even close to the quality and magic.  That's not the reason why they were made.  Episodes I-III are exactly that: prequels, exposition to the plot of Episodes IV-VI, where Luke Skywalker must redeem his father's ""soul,"" which he sacrificed to the Dark Side of the Force.  George Lucas had always said that his original intention for the ""Star Wars"" movies was to create a story with Anakin Skywalker at the center, but when no movie studio except 20th Century Fox was interested in making this risky science fiction epic, Lucas began with what he thought was the most marketable and intense chapter of the story.  ""A New Hope"" was released to the public in 1977, and was not an immediate blockbuster.  Only a few people were aware of its existence at the beginning, but their word of mouth rave reviews spread like wildfire, and a phenomenon was born.  Episodes I-III will never have that same allure, that same sense of newness.  They are merely products to entertain the true fans of Star Wars, to give a visual glimpse of the birth of Darth Vader, and a chance for George Lucas to play around with available technology.  There are annoying aspects to Episodes I and II (can anyone say, ""Jar Jar Binks?""); however, I thoroughly enjoy them.  When all six are on DVD, I plan to watch them from beginning to end, knowing that they will get better and better as they are played, one after the other, with the best--""Empire"" and ""Jedi""--for last.  Anyone who tells you that Episodes I and II are horrific because they do not live up to their predecessors misses the whole point: the predecessors are Episodes I-III.  The magic is in ""A New Hope,"" ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" and ""Return of the Jedi."" If you saw them when they were originally in theatres, then you have lived the magic once, and you have done better than anyone my age or younger.  If you want to be excited by the upcoming release of a ""Star Wars"" film, write George Lucas and tell him that he should release the originals to DVD soon.  Otherwise, let the true fans enjoy the ""Star Wars"" experience, from beginning to end.

For the most part, the acting and script were quite good, the storyline was fascinating, and every technical aspect of the film was brilliant.  My only complaint with the film was with the pacing.  There were a couple of scenes that really didn't fit, and could've been deleted.  The flow of the film as a whole would've been a lot smooter.

But I can understand while people who saw the first movies when they were only about 13 can see while this one isn't half as good as the others.

1319987,3,B00003CXKT,"I've stuck by the series til now without a word of criticism. I saw the first Star Wars in a drive-in movie theatre before it had even broken big worldwide. In fact, I think it was the last film I ever saw with both of my parents and my brother. I thought the Empire Strikes Back was a true masterpiece, and I was willing to put up with all the cutsie marketing tie-ins to get through the third installment.
With Episode I, great performances from Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor really kept things going.
But Episode II, what can I say? Well, first, someone should tell George Lucas that giving a viewer motion sickness is not usually the same thing as thrilling them. This movie was a major headache because, although it must be the most visually complex special effects film ever made, it hardly ever stays on one scene long enough for the eyes to focus.
And then there is the love story. It is boring and poorly acted. And Ewan McGregor is largely wasted as ObiWan Kenobi because he has to act as if he were a middle aged fuddy-duddy.
But the movie does offer some redemption. The final battle scenes, especially in the colluseum, were a thrill to watch. Sort of like those old stop action sequences from the 60s and 70s meets Ben Hur and Gladiator. And getting to see Yoda lay a butt wupping on Christopher Lee has to be one of the most memorable movie scenes I ever watched--and that is why it went from two to three stars.
I wish I could say better things about the film. Maybe by the third installment in the prequel series, George Lucas will figure out how to redeem the series.",1034294400,,1585,4.394557823129252
1319988,1,B00003CXKT,"Well, I loved the first 3 prequels they were just plain fun. That was then, this is now however.
I get the distinct feeling that the lack of technology during the first 3 movies, along with the need to invent so much of the effects technology as they went. Required George L. to have to do some doctoring when it came to the script. Providing humor, expanding character development. Stretching the premise out of necessity in order to compensate for a lack of viable effects that could be used for certain scenes. I feel this served him VERY well. It made the films more human.
Flash forward to SW I and II. Me thinks the opposite has taken effect here. The effects are amazing, all encompassing and brilliant. However, there has been no need or necessity to polish and develop the script. To me it seems that the techie side is developed first, so many quiet character scenes in SWII were utterly laughable. No development, no charisma. Course who could have charisma enough to give convincing interpretations of those lines in the first place. sorry George. II was better than I, but something has been lost from the original trilogy. And I think its called heart for lack of a better word. These newer films have a dentist office coldness to them. Intriguing visuals and a bit off-putting even. But still cold wet porcelain overall. Can't recommend it...",1034208000,4,1357,4.705882352941177

When watching this movie I did feel it was slow and that it wasn't all I ecpected but really when I have to think of Episode 1 and Episode 2 they really don't compare. The Phantom Menace which introduced some new characters to us giving us a different time line of the histories story was excellent with Ewan Mcgreggor as Obi-Wan and Natalie Portman playing Queen Amidala. The Villian Darth Maul was incredible looking as great as Darth Vader, but I realize in Episode 2 there was no main villian and the characters we all knew. Anakin being the adult and the Clone army being founded was the story depicted in this movie. The story to seeing how Darth Vadars future army began as soldiers of the peace was excellent and seeing the talented actress Natalie Portman playing a good role as she falls in love with the future villian played its part.

1320085,5,B00003CXKT,"Ok look, I know everyone says that these new films aren't living up to expectations... well how can they??  We started watching this spectacular odyssey 20+ years ago and everyone was enthralled by the the shear special effects and the out of this world settings in the first three films.  Everyone keeps complaining about the dialogue and some of the annoying characters in the new films, but, I saw all of the original movies when they came out.  I can remember people complaining about the clunky dialogue of Han and Leia in there love connection and chewbacca with his incesant growling and moaning just like they're complaining now about Hayden and Portman's dialogue and the exponentially annoying Jar Jar Binks.  Another problem is that all of the original teenage Star Wars fans that saw the original trilogy, so long ago, are 30 something now and aren't as easily impressed as a younger viewer would be.  But think of it this way, if the new movies had been release first, back in the 1970's, I'm positive we'd be disappointed with the release of the old movies now.  The original trilogy special effects would be underwhelming and the lightsaber battles would [not be impressive].  But enough what if's..when the dust settles and years from now we look back, we will realize what extraordinary masterpieces these new films are too.  The special effects are still astounding and cutting edge, the plot is almost, if not, as intriguing as the original trilogy.  You have to understand it's hard to make a prequel as full of suspense as the sequel, because... duh.. we already know what's going to happen (Anakin Skywalker evolves into Darth Vader, brings balance to the force, the end).  So, to all of you who don't like this movie because of it's acting... this is Star Wars.. not Shakespeare.  True Star Wars fans go to these movies to see the [cool] lightsaber battles, not a recreation of Hamlet.  I know when I go to the theatre to see this type of movie, as with all science fiction flicks, it gives me an escape from the daily [stuff] we see in our real lives.

Anakin I thought was superb, the evil in his eyes during the Tusken Raider scene is chilling.

 Lucus in my opinion is a genius. He's up there with Speilberg, Ridley Scott and Cameron to name a few!

1320178,5,B00003CXKT,"The way Lucas makes movies is an innovative and very personal way to make them. He's an independant director (not dependant from Hollywood), wich means that he doesn't make movies for the like of the people.
The critics aren't more than the fashion products, but that always changes. That's why he won't listen to them. As I said: he's an independant director.
In an interwiew published in the EPS in the April 28th this year, he ex'plains his way to make movies:
""All my movies, someway, are speechless movies and they're designed that way. The sound effects and the musical score itself are united in a sound mosaic wich merges with the picture to explain the story.
The dialogue is reasonably insignificant. I've never been a great fan of the dialogue. I use it more like a sound effect, like a hint or element to explain certain expoliation points in the plot; but, in the last term, one of the keys is that the expectant can experience these movies onlt through the picture. This is due to the way in wich the story is told through the sound band and the picture. The words, the dialogues are an added that aren't strictly necesary to make the whole thing work. I've always done that and I like to continue doing that. It's my style, tmy tendency. I've passed a long time treating the sound band as an unified all, a mix of effects, music, words... Something almost poetic. The sound is the 50% of the experience"".
So... What do you think eh? It's not bad acting... it's not that Lucas just lost it's touch... it's his style. It's a very different way to tell a story. Then don't complain if you don't even know how to write of make a movie.",1033689600,6,1646,4.49

1320181,4,B00003CXKT,"The quintessential film in both trilogies come in the middle.  Here is where Lucas develops his characters and points, as the Second Act in a stage play.  Therefore, it comes as no surprise that, in order to foreshadow events in the original Trilogy - especially ESB, Lucas borrows a bit from his earlier Second (or Fifth) Act.
The result is breathtaking.  Every major event of the Original Trilogy is foreshadowed in this one.  Although it seems to this reviewer that Lucas shouldn't have stooped to bad throwaway lines to foreshadow events such as the death of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
Since the general public knows the outcome of these movies, Lucas has chosen to allow the audience to witness the political genius of Palpatine as he moves through semi-Machiavellian schemes to move from Senator to Chancellor to Emperor.  It is only at the end of this film that his plot is completely revealed.  Lucas has done a very good job, worthy of anything in the Original Trilogy, in hiding the shadows until he casts light onto each one in this respect.  And it is good to know that Jar-Jar's idiocy actually serves some dramatic purpose.
As the theme of the Originals is ""Redemption"", the theme of the Prequels is ""Fall"".  In this film, we see the beginnings of this in Anakin Skyalker (Christenson) as he begins his journey to become Vader.  Also, note the first reference to the Imperial March in these Prequels.
The love sequences, though long and filled with cliches in dialogue, still present the conflicting emotions and the ""love vs. duty"" theme which marks this portion of the drama.
Many performances are wooden, but not enough to compare with the wooden-ness of, say, a DiCaprio.  Overall, the actors work to create memorable characters, and that is what Star Wars is really about (although sometimes it seems Lucas has forgotten that fact).
I predict this will be the masterpiece of the Prequels, just as ESB was for the Originals.  It isn't ""Richard III"", but it is the first of the Series to aspire to that dramatic height, and the first of the Prequels to show that Lucas is at least attempting to get back to his former speed after being out of writing and directing since the original Star Wars (Ep. IV).",1033603200,2,2209,4.7565445026178015
1320182,1,B00003CXKT,"As someone who has spent the better part of his life waiting for these three ""prequels"" to come out, this film was as much of a disappointment as Episode I.
The script is hackneyed and laughable, especially when it is trying to be serious.  The movie was simply boring for most of its running time.  I'm sorry, but five minutes of Yoda with a light-saber, while it was certainly a memorable and fun scene, was not nearly enough to save this film.
Much of the cyber-city-detectives content in the first half hour is a clearly lifted from ""Blade Runner"" and the flying car scenes from ""The Fifth Element.""  The monsters in the arena are NOT scary (except for my little nephew for whom this particular chapter was made) and look like they are straight out of ""Monsters Inc.""  And now we know who the aliens were in ""Close Encounters"" -- they were from Kamino!  Lucas has lost his creativity and his focus and ended up creating more plot problems and questions than he answered with his sloppy story-telling.
The acting is wooden.  The dialogue sounds like Lucas wrote it in junior high.  He should learn a great lesson from the fact that most critics think ""Empire"" is the greatest of the ""Star Wars"" saga so far--a film he neither wrote nor directed.  This saga, which he intended as an homage to the sci-fi movie serials of the 30's and 40's, has taken on a life of its own and, like a toddler learning to walk, has fallen flat on its face.
Sure, it's a cultural event and it made money (he's even released it to Imax because it didn't make nearly as much as he hoped the first time around), but surely we all can hope that American culture can rise to levels much higher than this forgettable chapter.
Move on with your lives, people... There are far greater movies out there to be seen.  Even greater books to be read!  As for Lucas and ""Star Wars,"" I'm afraid the magic is over.",1033603200,8,1880,4.454810495626822
1320183,1,B00003CXKT,"For the week leading up to its release, the word from the advanced critics screenings seemed to unanimously agree that Attack of the Clones is a significantly more adult film than the reproachable Phantom Menace.  Personally, I see the only achievement of this film is that Lucas and Co. has graduated from infantile to pre-adolescence.  Maybe by the time the last of this unfortunate trio is made, we'll have a film that I could have mildly enjoyed when I was fourteen years old.  But at present, what we seem to have in George Lucas is a director who is completely and totally in denial of a few simple truths:
1. The movie going public is not quite as taken with the mystery of why Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader as he is (and don't believe for a second that this is not a mystery to George because clearly he's making this [stuff] up as he goes along).
2.  That technological advances alone are no reason to revive a beloved series.  Allow me to explain:  I go over and over in my mind this one question - Why are these movies being made?  I can't help but think that Lucas, being essentially the founder of an effects studio more than anything else, had some tinge of regret that he made Star Wars so long ago when the effects capabilities were limited.  Clearly this is true... why else tinker with the original films and produce the remastered editions.  But that wasn't enough:  so, under the most misguided notion of all time (that papa could come and teach these whipper snappers a thing or two about making an effects driven movie) he came out of his ranch and started writing and ""directing"" this movie.
3.  Sure, Boba Fett made for a cool action figure... but I (and other star wars fans) could have lived a thousand years and never would have had an ounce of curiosity about the childhood and motivations for that character.
4.  There is a such thing as beating the audience over the head with a setup.  I'm willing to except conflict between Obi Wan and Anakin, especially provided that there's an entire film left for this conflict to hit it's peak.  Did we really need to sit through a couple of hours of whining, disobedience and scoldings for this dynamic to be present.
5.  Getting back to number 1:  Alright, so the character of Anakin Skywalker is not ready to be a Jedi... that's what we're getting at here, right?  And what are the Jedi -supposedly a terribly select order of individuals who have mastered the force (matter, mind, etc. etc.).  What would have been an interesting character (but somewhat challenging for a writer (which Lucas barely qualifies as) to do) is if Anakin were a hell of a guy, far better than most people (in maturity et al) but had some fault(s) that the vast majority of the audience share and it was that which led to his demise.  The sad thing would be if this were actually what Lucas was attempting.  As it stands we're left with a character who is not ready to make a mature 12 year old, so as an audience member over twelve, I have a hard time seeing the need for any dark side to seduce him.
Lastly...  Oh, the hell with it... why am I sitting here putting so much thought into slamming this tripe when it's creator put no thought into writing and directing it.  I guess what I want is impossible to receive and that is for the people who claim they enjoy this [stuff] to come back from the edge of sanity and try to help in the effort to make Lucas seek some professional filmmaking help before he films Episode three.  But it's too late... I'm pretty sure I already know how Episode 3 will go down... because the fence sitters have said something to the extent that ""Oh yeah, the movie sucked but the light saber fights were cool,"" we `re going to end up getting a mortal kombat style picture that is basically an overblown tournament of light saber duels.  After all, Count Dooku has to die, dido Mace Windu, the unfortunate approval for the Yoda fight scene probably means he'll pick up the saber again.  And we all know that Anakin and Obi Wan have to go at it again.  So far we're up to four and that's not including the fact that many other Jedi must perish and who knows what the Emperor will be up to.

1320184,4,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones may not be the best movie we've seen this year, but, it certainly was my favorite. It was everything a summer movie should be....fun. There are several things I liked about this movie. For instance, the whole mystery of who ordered the clone army? That's something we may never know, but it sure is intriguing. Another positive was Ewan McGregor's performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi...he played it like he was a younger Alec Guiness (the original Obi-Wan). Another thing you cannot ignore are all the classic cameos, the Berus and a young Boba Fett, just to name a few. John Williams' music and Lucas' ability to make a movie that looks gorgeous just adds to this hit. All of the detractors that say Lucas can't write or direct and his dialogue sucks...since day one, Star Wars' dialogue was never meant to be great. Lucas said himself, these movies are supposed to be visual with the dialogue only acting as a guide. Need I even mention the final 40 minutes of the movie? They speak for themselves. I look forward to Episode III and I know Lucas won't disappoint me.",1033603200,13,1105,4.642857142857143
1320255,5,B00003CXKT,George Lucas has created a cinematic masterpiece with Attack of the Clones and continues the trend established with the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones is on parrell with The Empire Strikes Back as a dark film and we see the rise of the Empire in this movie and preparations for the death star are revealed in this movie.  We also learn that Count Dooku was Yoda's apprentice at one point in time and that Dooku was Qui-Gon's instructor.  Anakin's mother is murdered by the Sand People and she dies in his arms- singling his fall to the dark side.  Who can blame for choosing the dark side- after what happened to his mother and we all know that he's redeemed in Return of the Jedi when he kills Palpatine to save Luke.  Amidala's death in the third movie will send him to the dark side and transform him into Vader.  Jango Fett's death sets the stage for the rise of Bobba Fett in Empire.  The visual effects are stunning and a true adventure at the movies.  Forget Spider-Man!! The force ruled again in 2002!!  Attack of the clones is incredible and a masterpiece. George Lucas does it again and brings back the classic storytelling formula from the 80s with improved visual effects.  A sure Oscar winner for Visual effects!!,1033603200,2,1235,4.552036199095022
1320256,2,B00003CXKT,"SOME MINOR SPOILERS!
While the classic Star Wars films (episodes IV-VI) felt exciting and full of energy, the SW prequels (epidodes I-III) are so far a huge letdown. What is missing in these prequels are humanity and humor, which has been replaced in the prequels by better special effects, but these effects completely take over the story, instead of enhancing them.
After The Phantom Menace, which is rightfully regarded not only as the WORST Star Wars film, and one of the most ridiculous science fiction films ever made, George Lucas followed up TPM with Attack of the Clones which has a better story, but one that still disappoints.
The ""romantic"" element in AOTC, between Anakin and Padme feels forced and right out of a soap opera. Not only that, but the teenage Anakin is more of a brat and feels nothing like the feared future Dark Lord of the Sith. I'm sorry, but no sane person could ever picture young Darth Vader running around grassy knowles along with his girlfriend. As for Padme, she is possibly one of the most boring written characters ever conceived, while everyone knows that she will be the mother to both Luke and Leia of the classic trilogy, Padme, has none of the qualities of her feisty and stubborn daughter. She is simply window dressing that will most likely be killed (possibly by Anakin/Darth Vader) in the final episode of the six-part saga, Episode III.
The ending felt like it was ripped out of Gladiator, with Jedis battling all sorts of droids and C-3PO making a complete fool out of himself!
Obi-Wan Kenobi is the only interesting character in both The Phantom Menace and in Attack of the Clones, and I liked his personal investigation into the assassination attempts on Padme's life along with his fight scenes with villian Jango Fett.
The real villian of the piece is Christopher Lee, who did a terrific job, with a lackluster script, as Count Dooku, a former Jedi knight who succumbs to the dark side. His lightsaber battle with Yoda is the highlight of the whole movie.
Overall, the first half of the film consists of a boring and cliched romance between Anakin and Padme, (Just to show who the parents of Luke and Leia are!) along with a few cool fight scenes, and ONE outer space battle in the entire film in an asteroid field! The last thirty minutes are non stop action that becomes repetitive very quickly!
All in all, Attack of the Clones is another overall disappointment in the SW ""prequel"" trilogy with some redeeming qualities....Here's HOPING that George Lucas can please young and old fans alike with the tragic final episode in the six-part Star Wars saga, (Sorry fans, Episode III is the final chapter) with Star Wars Episode III, due in theaters summer 2005!",1033516800,4,2714,4.764331210191083

1320258,1,B00003CXKT,"George Lucas may be a pioneer in digital filmmaking, shooting with digital video and using digital characters and sets, but can he not see that this movie looks completely FAKE. Computer effects overload; this is not a live action movie, but a cartoon with a few real actors thrown in.
Computer generated effects can work well and can inspire the imagination when used correctly, but Episode 2, like Episode 1, is definitely not a wonder in modern special effects. More like high priced Anime with weak writing and characters; a video game that in time will truly look amateurish.
Special Effects in the movies can look great when there is a mixing of real sets, costumes, actors and computer effects as in LOTR or even Spielberg's Minority Report, but George Lucas thinks he can make an entire movie with actors on blue screens and computer geeks rendering characters and sets. HE can't, this movie does not feel real in any way, even the flesh and blood actors looked blurry. The robot factory assembly line was laughably bad as were countless other scenes.
As for the lame storyline; it stole from second rate Anime films and has nothing new or fresh to offer a sci-fi loving audience. I can only hope George Lucas retires from filmmaking after Episode 3 because he's no longer gifted, but a recycler of tired material, and he tries to hide it under modern digital effects that don't hold up.",1033257600,17,1395,4.744855967078189
1320259,5,B00003CXKT,"Ok, SW  is not the best saga ever put on film; SW is not  the philosopher stone some people think; SW is a part of my generation but not the religion: All that is true but whta the hell SW is a glorious spectacle, a super kind of movie-movie experience that now is nearly lost.
Of course, I am talking of SW as a whole and now I am supose to write abour AOTC. If you make me choose, I put it on top with ANH and ESB. Yes, it is that good. It aproachs to the masterpiece level. Somebody is going to want to kill me for my affirmation but it is my opinion.
Why a masterpiece?. Because it is the only one of the saga that  tie  film generes in a unified and seamless way. It is likerwe are seeing a mini history of the movies without loosing the unity of the story. You want western?, well what could it be most western than the Tatooine part with the burial of Anakin's mother and her rescue. You want film Noir?, plenty of it in the shades and the look of the big city, the misterious assassins and the keepers of the order, the elusive paths to an investigation. Romance? Lago di Como and Spain for Padme's home world, with the gorgeous colors and the bigger than life  landscapes . Gothic Terror?, you name it, Christopher Lee and the gaudian towers. Romans?, obvious, the circus. War?, the kind of shots and movement of a good old time war movie with more new zoom like approach to a take.  Cine club film ala Citizen Kane? the big library, the contrast of light, the puzzling approach to the unfolding drama.  Comedy, drama, monsters movies with quite fantastic homenages. If you look at it closely even you could find little parts of musicals (The Sound of Music perhaps, ja,ja,ja) and a miriad of movie generes.
Let's hope that the next one is as good as this one. Lucas, you have the force with you again.
For the rest of you people that love to trash a movie like this, well you are missing the fun.

1320260,2,B00003CXKT,"Ok, I'll be honest. If you were dissapointed by Episode I then you'll no doubt be dissapointed here as well. Forget the hype. Regardless of what people say this is still leagues upon leagues below the original trilogy. Non of the myth, magic, and epic scope are present. Wow, we see 2 million troops fight each other. And why should we care? The movie has big sights and big sounds, but it forgets that these are worthless to the audience if they have nothing to care about. Wait, let me correct that. It doesn't ""forget"". Indeed, were it to forget then at least it could be corny and we could laugh at it. But instead it tries to add emotion, via a love story that could have been pulled out of a donkeys behind. In some of these scenes it's hard to tell what's worse: the script or the acting. While certainly the writers didn't provide much for the actors to work with, then again one has to wonder whether it would have made a difference.
I love George Lucas, as a person. He supports and produces many incredible independent movies. He talks fierce politics. He criticizes everything that I think is bad about the movie industry. And yet he goes out and creates these movies that are hardly above that which he so fiercely opposes. Don't get me wrong, what is bad about Episode II is not what's bad about your average Hollywood action film. But it's bad nonetheless, and the fact that it's non-cliche to a certain extent makes it even worse to sit through. At least in the bad Hollywood movies we know what garbage to expect.
Don't get me wrong: visually speaking, and aurally, this movie is incredible. The same was true for Episode I. Indeed, the movie does improve over it's predecor in one respect: technicality. The movie is much superior in the effects department, and the music is much more epic. It is almost worth watching just to see it's visual glory, though admitedly once it leaves theatres this will make it even more obsolete then it already is. But if you can catch it on the big screen it's (arguably) worth it.
Just like Star Trek fans who praise all that is Star Trek, Star Wars fans (those who still remain) have lowered themselves to the same blind worshipfulness. I have little doubt that regardless of the quality of the film released, if it is called ""Star Wars"" it will make it's money. Being a once-obssesed Star Wars fan, a certain recollection of pain and sorrow gnaw at my nostalgic conscience. It is unfortunate to see what was once a glorious epic, a myth told by a brilliant magician, loose it's prestiege. It doesn't diminish the accomplishments of the original movies, but the fact that two movies of such drasticly different quality can share the same name is testament to the ever-lowering level of quality of the epic.
Of course, into all of this comes another epic, one of such tremendous scale that it threatens to dethrone Star Wars completely, both the new and the old. We are fortunate enough to be in it's midst, though many have yet to catch onto it. I point you to ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, made by master story-teller Peter Jackson. It is darker, deeper, well written, and emotionally acted. Not to knock Lucas, but when it comes to making movies in the same epic vien the original Star Wars movies were made, Jackson has easily matched Lucas with but one of the three films yet to be released. And with bigger things coming Lucas better watch out.",1033257600,4,3406,4.557911908646004

empire strikes back had a definite change in tone, but was still very entertaining
by the time revenge of the jedi rolled around the cracks started to show, it being by far the weakest of the three movies.
well Lucas has out done himself. the 2 prequels (so far) are wretched movies. the plots are obvious to nonexsistent, stating what we already know, but providing no surpises or characters that you feel even the slightest interest in. i'm mean come on, the most compelling and passionate character of the first prequel was Darth Maul.
and this Clones flick is just plain dumb, that ham handed Hayden Whatever couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag. the ""love"" scenes were just plain embarassing, and seeing Samuel L. Jackson in a movie with out his signature M.F. line isn't even believeable.

With all that in its corner, I still only give this movie 2 stars, and that is simply because Natalie Portman as Padm&eacute; and Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker were the most tiresome, boring, and ridiculous characters to watch...AND THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS MOVIE IS TO SET UP THEIR ROMANCE SO LUKE AND LEAH CAN BE BORN!!!! I found myself enjoying the film when neither of them were present, but as soon as one of their contrived and forced romantic scenes (they literally look and sound as if they are reading names in the phone book when they are supposed to be desperately in love) I completely lost interest and hoped it would return to the Obi storyline.

1320360,5,B00003CXKT,"The only disappointment I walked with in ATTACK OF THE CLONES was
that I couldn't understand what everyone's problem was with Anakin Skywalker. I thought actor Hayden Christensen did a damn good job playing his part. I thought he was beleivable in his scenes even when the dialogue wasn't. Sure AOTC has it's share of loop holes which I hope at least some get addressed in the next episode. Like Owen not being familiar with C-3PO in A New Hope. But this film does redeem itself as being a worthy contender to anything in the original trilogy. The Phantom Menace had it's moments but fails to live up to Star Wars standards. This one however, does. The new faces like Tem. Morrison playing Jango Fett were stellar. And some older ones like Christopher Lee playing the part of a Rogue Jedi named Count Dooku. The other things to be impressed about: Obi-Wan Kenobi's character really comes to life in AOTC. Padme(Natalie Portman) is so damn cute in this movie. Anakin's hint to the dark side is awesome. (One thing that does bother me is Anakin and Padme's gooey parts weren't that interesting.) Of course let's not forget Yoda(voice of Frank Oz) and Mace Windu(Samuel L. Jackson) playing the two baddest Jedi masters ever. The areana battle and final duels were probably the coolest moments in the Star Wars sequels yet.(At least it's right up there with Vader's duel on Cloud City w/Luke) Overall- AOTC is very entertaining and will sure to satisfy any fans of lightsaber dueling and elements of the old trilogy. Lets hope that the next and last installment continues to be more like II, IV, V, and VI and less like I. From what I read III is supposed to be the darkest of them all.

1320361,2,B00003CXKT,"Let's give it two stars because I'm a Star Wars fan, because of respect for Christopher Lee (you can see he's a real master swordsman, he has style), and because the effects were ok. Except for Anakins's prosthetic hand, which is a disgrace. Come on, we make better hands now. And except for R2D2's rockets. Another disgrace. Now for the really bad parts:
1- After four Star Wars movies I grew up thinking the Jedi were wise, difficult to deceive, great warriors... now it happens some time ago somebody ordered a top notch clone army to be created in their name and they never suspected anything. So the Jedi are terribly stupid. Keystone cops were smarter, I believe. Also, all their apprentices are rotten kids, no marvel the galaxy is falling to pieces. They had it coming.
2- Anakin is supposed to be ""the One"". The One what? Why did the scriptwriter ever fall into that mesianic bull? Now he doesn't know what to do with it! Anakin acts as if he were a guest star in Beverly Hills 90210: oh, nobody loves me, I wanna be good, I want you Padme, if you don't gimme some loving I'll be mean. Come on, he's supposed to be a Jedi, I understand he can fall to the dark side, but not to the idiot side.
3- Anakin and Padme perform Mr. and Mrs. Frog video game ""jumping across the street"". No comments. Too long, too silly, too boring. Maybe a commercial add for a new video game?
4- Anakin's mother gets whacked by Tusken pirates: jeez, I hate it when only after a couple of minutes I think of a better plot: Anakin's mother should have been killed by Palpatine (because she's good and keeps sonny on the sunny side), and Palpatine should have made it apparent that Anakin could have made it on time to save her, hadn't it been for the Jedi sending him away to do something else.
5- Yoda says everything is getting dark: sure, Yoda, you had one joint too many. The worst Sith in history is a couple of blocks away from your tiny chair and you don't suspect anything.
This is one DVD I'm not going to buy. And mark I have all the other Episodes.

I agree with what many negative reviewers have already said about the boring storyline, cheesy dialogue, nauseating love story.  Every movie that comes out these days is trying to dazzle the eye with fantastic effects.  That is fine if you want to appeal to children and a brain dead audience.  I'm just not a kid anymore and it takes more than special effects to impress me.
I remember how enthusiastic I felt in 1999 when The Phantom Menace came out on May 19th, which also is my birthday.  I admit to being swept up in the hype.  It was almost like audiences wern't going to let the movie fail.  Later, on future viewings I couldn't ignore the glaring weakness it.  There is no companionship to enjoy between the characters, no intrigue or plot suspense, and I just don't care what happens to them.  Attack of the Clones was Lucas's chance to redeem and he failed miserably.  5 minutes of Yoda with a light saber isn't enough to save a shallow film.",1032912000,4,1058,4.521052631578947

1320364,2,B00003CXKT,"Wow, George Lucas has done it again, and this time, you will not be reading a glowing review of yet another great action film. ... Firstly, let me get one thing straight. I am not one of those fanatics who believe that the Star Wars triology were masterpieces with hidden genius and all that good stuff. I'm perfectly aware of the fact that even at their best, Star Wars movies are B-rated actions films, which we all watch in order to see whether or not the Millennium Falcon will yet again make it to hyper-drive just in the nick of time to save the day. However, there are certain requirements which even an action movie should have.
 Any movie should have characters that are interesting and multifaceted. Everyone loved Han Solo because he was a rebel, who occasionally surprised even himself by being a hero. In the latest Star Wars installment however, all the characters are one-dimensional and boring. We have Anakin Skywalker, who cannot decided whether or not to become a Jedi, kill everyone who annoys him, or marry his best friend. He's having a bit of an identity crisis and the fact that Christensen was not able to pull off a decent acting job, making the character come across as a spoiled and rebellious teen, doesn't help the situation. And then there is Padma, who doesn't get any good lines in the first place, and Portman is not able to do much with the few ones she's given, making her character come across as sleepwalking through most of her scenes. Needless to say, none of this helps the love story that is suposed to be developing between these two characters.
Not to mention, that Lucas treats all the digtal technology that he gets to use as toys, and he can't get enough of them.  It's okay to use digtal effects to improve the story, but it should actually do that, and help to make the story itself more interesting, not to distract from truly terrible acting.  While he makes good use of them in creating more interesting landscapes, like the city ""sky streets,"" and the planet Kamino, covered by oceans and rain, he begins to take it a little far by creating a completely digtal diner, and completely fake creatures and robots to go with it. ... Lucas has got one more film to try to redeem some of the charm of the original three, and his best bet is to put the directing in someone else's hands. The third movie will probably be dark and slightly depressing (much like Star Wars, Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.) That movie certainly did not end well, what with Luc losing an arm, and Han getting frozen, but it certainly was the best one, what with the conflict building and the romance between Han and Leia. However, for Episode V, Lucas did not choose to direct it...",1032739200,8,2711,4.562628336755647
1320365,3,B00003CXKT,"Last year there were really only three big movies for the scifi/fantasy set; EP.II, Lord of the Rings and Spiderman.
All three had great action, beautiful special effects and music, and best of all a sense of wonder that so often is lacking in today's escapism films.
What separates Ep. II from LOTR and Spidey is a lack of believable characters to empathize with.
Spiderman really sucked you into the story because Peter Parker was human and seemed vulnerable.  He had great powers but he also suffered the pain of being human.
LOTR was loaded with characters you liked and wanted to see more of.  They had humor in spite of their fears and were loyal to their fellowship.
The characters in Ep. II were never in any danger.  They were shot at and smacked around with lightsabers, even headbutted in the case of ObiWan and Jango Fett.  But I never felt any real concern for the characters.  Of course they would be okay, they have to make it to the next movie.
There was just something missing in the dialogue or acting that made the whole experience feel like cardboard.  It's probably the prettiest and most expensive cardboard in the world, but cardboard all the same.",1032739200,2,1171,4.632850241545894
1320366,1,B00003CXKT,"As a Star Wars fan I am greatly offended by these prequels. Just how much of artistic vision can he sacrifice to make money? Special effects do not have enough influence on public these days to totally disregard every other aspect of the movie. It's not very often that I have the urge to walk out of the movie 30 minutes into it.
When Episode I came out, I thought that no ""Star Wars"" episode could have been worst. I realized I was wrong after watching Episode II, which was so much worst.
George Lucas needs to find someone else to do writing for him to prevent these idiotic dialogs making way into the movie. I do believe that this movie was meant to be a computer generated extravaganza and simply had characters saying anything to get from one scene to another. In case filmmakers do not yet know this, writing is what makes a good movie. Without it you can have most advanced special effects and the entire cast can be naked and it will still be a bad movie.
In addition to bad writing whoever decided to cast Hayden Christensen should be seriously punished. If he is the best candidate after a worldwide search, person doing the searching was blind. Good looks do not make an actor. I've never seen anyone having such a hard time portraying a character. Instead of capturing a character facing a deep conflict, he does nothing but whine and complain for 2 hrs. Casting all together was badly handled. There was no chemistry between these people whatsoever. Love story was so obviously forced that it was painful to watch.
All and all, this was a pretty bad movie. Definitely on top of the list of worst movies ever. Sad part is that even had it not been Star Wars this was still a bad movie. The only reason to buy it is to complete the collection and maybe revisit total of 30 min of the entire movie.

1320492,2,B00003CXKT,"Had Attack of the Clones been the second part of a trilogy that was not connected to the Star Wars world, how many people would even bother to catch the third movie?
One of the most fundamental issues with AotC is that the acting is horrible. I presume this is, in part, because of the rigors required to put in as many effects as Lucas tries to cram into his films. But Portman and Christiensen aren't bad actors, they just act badly in this movie. Even Ewan MacGregor, who's normally mesmerising to watch, looks like he's stuck in B-movie hell, posing in front of green screens for a good half the film.
While the acting, and the god-awful writing do a lot to take away from the movie, the biggest problem with it is the haphazardness of it all. In an effort to cram in as much ""depth"" to this story as possible, we're stuck with five or six different plotlines, each ending on a minor cliffhanger every two minutes. The effect of being continually jarred by the incessant cutting from plotline to plotline is that you simply aren't able to get absorbed in any characters, or aspects of the plot for any significant length of time.
In the end, the jarring simply serves to numb you from any impact the movie tries to create.
...
Lucas, it would seem, simply isn't a good director. Put A-list actors like MacGregor and Portman in the hands of any capable director, and they'll see that what these actors bring to the table is a sense of charisma, and a life that makes their characters interesting to watch. Lucas isn't able to elicit any of that life from these great actors, and he turns Hayden Christiensen into a whiny, self-serving mannequin. The rage that twists Anakin to the Dark Side should have been palpable, but instead, we're treated to the whining selfishness of a spoiled teenage brat. This is the Dark Lord of the Sith?

1320493,5,B00003CXKT,"I saw the Phantom Menace with family, Attack of the Clones with friends, and, aside from those reasons, I adored 'Clones' much more than Menace.
The three original Star Wars are what hooked us. They were unbeatable, incomparable, and beyond compare, so asking a whole new movie audience to regard the latest prequels in the same sense as the originals is somewhat difficult; especially after 'Menace', admittedly made for an audience under the age of eleven. That movie had gut emotional appeal, but 'Clones' stars in more arenas than that particular one.
I'll be honest- the best acting in the film is probably done by Ewan McGregor, brilliant in everything he touches, from 'Emma' with Gwyneth Paltrow to 'Moulin Rouge' with Nicole Kidman to the Star Wars prequels. His portrayal of a young Obi Wan Kenobi is excellent- we are immediately endeared to Obi Wan [regardless of McGregor's excellent portrayal] because of the Obi Wan we know from the trilogy- Sir Alec Guiness (RIP).
Of course, Hayden Christensen, the star, should get a notable mention. Girls everywhere (myself included) adore his eyes and his whole demeanor, but he brought a raw emotion to Anakin- we see a troubled, misunderstood, crowded, hurting man as opposed to the innocent young boy and the evil Darth Vader. For that, we can commend Hayden.
The only thing I'd change would be Natalie Portman. She, to me, is NOT Amidala/Padme in the sense that I perceive the character as having a deeply passionate and impulsive nature. Of course, when she is in the role of the stony Senator, she does excellently, but Hayden should have been paired with an actress capable of meeting his own attributes that he brought to Anakin. Of course, see it enough times and the thoughts of 'I should be her!' or even 'someone else should be her!' fade.
And, aside from acting, the digital/special effects are BRILLIANT. I do mean brilliant. It will boggle your mind (especially Yoda's, by now, infamous fight scene), and the music is beautiful. The fight scenes steal the show though- excellently choreographed, and realistic but still unatainable.
The DVD is an excellent investment in a worthwhile trilogy- all movies American Classics.",1032393600,2,2191,4.9890710382513666
1320494,2,B00003CXKT,"Bad acting and a complete lack of apparent plot are the two biggest holes in this movie. The special effects are the only things worthwhile in this movie. I've seen almost all the actors from this movie in other films and they can all do a much better job than would be apparent to anyone who only saw them act in this movie.
The romance is extremely questionable, expecially since you would need a bucket of gasoline and a match to get any spark between the two leads.
The Jedi come off as extremely dumb, since the major plot point (if you could call it that) revolves around the fact that data is missing from the Jedi library that only a Jedi could remove but there is only one Jedi that ever left the order and the remaining Jedi just blow off the possibility that he may have erased it.
Guess what? He's the bad guy!
Some of the fight sequences are well done, but most of it has a been there, done that quality that you wonder why you haven't left your seat to sneak into another theater yet.",1032393600,3,998,4.257894736842105
1320495,1,B00003CXKT,"Yes, the universally despised Jar Jar Binks was almost entirely eliminated from Attack of the Clones, and yet this atrocious sequel still manages the seemingly impossible feat of being worse than its predecessor... He used to be a capable director, after all, he's responsible for American Graffiti, and he has to be given credit for coming up with the Star Wars franchise in the first place, but he is not a writer and this is painfully evident throughout both Episodes I and II. Acting as writer, producer and director all that the same time, he spreads himself too thin... Anakin and Amidala's love scenes are the most embarassingly bad things to be seen in theaters for a very, very long time.",1032393600,4,697,4.768595041322314

To see the suttle ways people were being manipulated. To see even

1320497,4,B00003CXKT,"A comparison is often made between the original trilogy (Star Wars: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi) and the last two prequel movies (The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones).  The main difference between these two is that the original trilogy focused on a particular character while the two latest movies lack this focus.

Really the first three movies were about Luke Skywalker and his becoming a Jedi.  Each movie focused for its climax on a pivotal moment in that development.  This ties the whole trilogy together into one magnificent whole that more people can relate to because the whole set of subplots were reflected in the personal development of Luke.

The latest two movies lack this central character.  I feel this character should be, for the prequels, Obi Wan Kenobi.  After all it is his efforts that have been central to the second movie.  In the first prequel he faces the tragedy of the death of his mentor.  How this affected him--did he succomb to the dark side and use anger to defeat Darth Maul?--was never adequately addressed.  In the second movie, his student Annakin fails to listen and they both become a burden (two bodies lying on the floor) rather than an asset at a crucial moment.  This could have been used to build the theme that Obi Wan's training of Anakin would have been blinded by his own loss and how he has developed as a Jedi (using a touch of the dark side at a crucial moment when defeating Darth Maul).

Indeed loss is the theme in the second movie where we see loss of Jedi, Anakin lose his control in a profound way (presumably killing the innocent) and Obi Wan loose control of Anakin more than once and fail to be aware of the degree of anger and pain in his young student.  These developments, while obvious, are not emphasized sufficiently in the story to see how important they are.

Otherwise, I believe Lucas has delivered a consistently compelling movie experience full of science fiction wonder, heart-pounding action and interesting characters.",1032220800,6,2027,4.737891737891738
1320563,4,B00003CXKT,"If you want the benchmark of Star Wars films you have to look at Empire Strikes back. The depth of Empire sets it apart from the rest of the Star Wars films. But to the fact. ATOC is a fun adventure which is what I expect from Star Wars nothing more and nothing less.
The special effects are par for what i expect from a visual genius of Lucas's calibur. Seeing Yoda fight is worth the price of admission alone.
The soundtrack is not up to par with Williams Id say. There is no memorable catch like all the other films. The Duel of Fates and the Imperial March are used in parts of which I love but nothing new of consequence.
Lucus is still a master but this time around he has been caught and passed by the Lord of the Rings which used a better story (written by a Professor) and equally as impressive effects to create a world deeper and more rich with history.

1320565,5,B00003CXKT,"I am a Star War fan since birth.  I have seen the original films so many times that it would be impossible to count.  I continue to watch them every other month or so.  I was disappointed with Episode 1.  Jar Jar was a little too much to handle.  But that is all old news.  The most recent installment washed away all of that.  From the start it never lets you go.  The action scenes keep coming and coming with each one out doing the one before it.  Finally, culminating in the ending battle scene that is of a scope never seen before on the Big Screen.  It all came together when Yoda unleashed the fury of force proving once again that he is the Master Jedi.  Sure the dialogue was a bit sticky in places but that added to the allure.  The relationship of Padme and Anakin was well done and set the tone for the next installment.  The third movie will be the culmination of the entire Star Wars universe when we see how things came to pass and how those that we love so much came to be and I wait in breatheless anticipation for all of it to happen in galaxy far, far away.",1032134400,5,1076,4.115384615384615
1320566,3,B00003CXKT,"What I would have to say (much to the chagrin of many fans) is that this movie is the weakest link in the series.  It is entertaining but it has lost some of the elements that made the older Star Wars movies great.
Number one is originality, which this movie had little of.  Pick a scene in the movie and most chances are you've seen it before in another movie.  That air taxi chase on Corruscant, thats the Fifth Element right there.  Anakin's sneaking into the Tuskin camp to rescue his mom, thats The Searchers.  How about Obi Wan's ""release spaceship parts"" tactic to elude Jango Fett in the asteroid field, The Romulan Villian from the Star Trek episode ""Balance of Terror"" pulled this off.  The collisium scenes were better but most gladiator movies (or better yet the movie Gladiator) have done it times before.  No scene (with the tiny exception of Planet Kamino) does this movie even reach the levels of originality such as the Death Star and it's planet destroying laser, the Sarlacc pit monster or even the podrace.  Mr. Lucas should pick up a pen and paper instead of sitting in computer labs and making everything try to look pretty.
Speaking of the writing, it couldn't be more bland then here.  You won't find the equivilant of ""I'd rather kiss a Wookie!"" or ""That's no moon, it's a space station!""  We get novice class excerpts from the book of Lucas mostly on the topic of Anakin's lovelorn for Padme which are spoken amidst the backdrops of every cliche of romance you can imagine (romping through grass fields, boat rides, dinner together and the true yawner, the romantic fireplace sequence complete with a sofa.)
Remember the plots of the Star Wars movies being simple and straight forward? (Empire finds hidden base, Rebels evacuate, Luke finds Yoda, Han Solo captured, Luke attempts rescue, Vader reveals secret, Rebels get away).  That in a nutshell was EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.  For me to sum up ATTACK, it would take much longer and I wouldn't be able to do it without making your head turn a few times.  Many people now a days complain about a lack of plot (myslef included at times) so Mr. Lucas thought that if he added enough twists to the story nobody will complain about a lack of plot.  As far as I've heard, nobody has so I suppose thats a plus.
The special effects are a hair less then what they were in PHANTOM MENACE.  I remember a critic saying once that PM, ""looks real even though most of it isn't""  that was true.  For the most part ATOC looks fake because most of it is.  Chalk this one up to the new all digital format.  On the big screen especially on Geonosis the movie at it's worst almost looks like some prolouge to some new PC shooter.  Hopefully on the small screen it will look much better.
Last but not least is the actors.  When you see him, Christopher Lee is fantastic.  Kudos to Samuel L Jackson.  Ewan McGreggor who gets the most screen time, you can joke has some big hands (he has a LOT to carry here).  He does a great job.  I remember in Ep 4 Obi Wan talking about Anakin as being ""a good friend"".  I saw NONE of that relationship here with Anakin.  Hayden Christensen is a decent actor but the way Anakin is written is as a whiny, ungratful punk crabbing about how Obi Wan is ""unfair"" and living by a philosophy of I deserve it because I want it.  Seeing Darth Vader: Scurge of the galaxy and thinking of what a pain he was as Anakin doesn't make him seem scary at all but more of a spoiled jerk who now has everything he wanted and can do anything.  When Anakin says that some day he'll be the greatest Jedi ever I imagine him finishing the speach by saying ""I'm drinking milk, and one day I'll be big and strong!""  Okay bad joke.
Finishing up, I can say that this movie was a big dissapointment when it came to delivering the bang or entertainment that the other movies in the series have done.  SPIDERMAN easily wins my choice as best movie of the summer strictly on it's entertainment value and more humorous aspects.  Mr. Lucas has got A LOT of ground to make up in order to win some of my appreciation which was lost with this one.  If Episode III doesn't deliver, I can almost gaurentee that most fans won't be looking around for an Episode VII.  Who wants to bet by that time, Luca's computers will be able to create all digital actors?",1032134400,3,4302,4.431297709923665
1320567,5,B00003CXKT,"The first time I saw Episode II I was thrilled. I've always loved Star Wars (the old trilogy) but when Episode I was released I sort of lost faith in the Star Wars Saga. However... I think Attack Of The Clones made up for it all...big time! This is the best movie I've ever seen. The story is so intense, with all the battles, the love-story (sure, it's a lot of clich, but that's what young inexperienced love is all about) and last but not least; the political struggle for power. A lot of people prefered Lord Of The Rings, but I don't. Compared to Episode II, Lord of the Rings is dull, boring and not very thrilling. There is no emotional tension between the characters in Lord of the Rings, well a little bit but not in the same way. In Lord of the Rings it's also like: ""OK, let's put all the bad guys on this side of the stage and all the good guys on that side of the stage, put a rush on that people, we don't want the audience to actually think"". In Episode II, there is corruption, lies and double-playing. Nothing is the way it originally seemed to be. I think this movie deserves 5 stars.... I've seen Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones, and I can't wait to see it again!

1320568,5,B00003CXKT,"For those of you who are bashing this movie are bashing it for the wrong reasons.  I do agree with two complaints:  Yoda was comedic when he did the Neo from the Matrix (waving his hand to tell him to bring it on), and the Tuskin camp scene was cut way too short.  Other than that there is not a huge villan because if you have read the material for the back stories and not just seen the movies then you know that the Sith do not want to expose themselves until they need to and Palpatine has to remain in the shadows because he is not finished his rise to power.  Anakin-Darth Vader is only beginning to let anger take him over.  The Republic was peaceful, hense the no great drama of villans.  The love scenes are a big complaint but let me see a jedi is not supposed to love and because the code forbids him to marry Padme' he will break away from the Good Side.  Episode III will be so much better for those who can not let go of the original series comparison because it will tie everything together.  The prequel is not supposed to be as dramatic as EPS 4,5,6 because it lacks the empire.",1032048000,,1095,4.156398104265403

The only good thing about Episode II is that you can start to connect a bridge between these new movies back to the old ones.  Hayden Christenson's dialogue is an X-Wing Fighter wreck.  The writing in these new movies is pathetic.  Totally shallow and cookie cutter and trite.
I wonder who's decision it was to sacrifice dialogue for upgraded special effects?  Speaking of special effects, these new movies have regressed from the originals.  The old skool models were perfect.  Now we get billions of tiny little ships, flying through ""futuristic"" cities.  What crap.  Whoever did this to these movies, I'd like to kick him in the pants.
Oh, and WHY NOT BE CRITICS?  I can call crap when I see it, regardless of who wrote it or what franchise it is.
Bottom line:  AOTC is a notch above Phantom Menace... However, you can't really get much worse than Phantom Menace, so that is not saying much.
Ok, Bri, so you've convinced me not to buy this, but should I rent it instead if I've never seen it?
No.  Rent Spiderman or LOTR if you want to see a recent movie where CGI was used properly or to see good writing.  If you want a great space movie, rent 2001... Sick movie.",1031875200,2,1240,4.486607142857143

He has a sister? Darth Vader did what? But how do you do that in a set of films in which we all know what's going to happen. George Lucas did his best in making 2 films(so far) that capture the fun and excitement of the original trilogy, and just because your 20 years older, doesn't mean that kids who are your age when you first saw it won't love it just as much!!! My son and daughter love the movie despite it's darker tone, and they love Jar Jar, and they love Jake Lloyd, just like we loved Ewoks and a ham of an actor named Mark Hamill. The reason the dialogue is stilted is because that's the way they talk in the star wars universe. Just listen to Harrison Ford's lines in the original movie. Or Carrie Fisher's overacting.

1320663,5,B00003CXKT,"Like many who watched it, I was not very pleased with Episode I: The Phantom Menace (my little brother loved it though, go figure).  Fortunately, Episode II: Attack of the Clones makes up for the first one with an interesting story and a fast-moving screenplay (Jar Jar Binks having only a limited role in this one was also a plus).  Attack of the Clones was obviously aimed at a broader audience this time, with better dialogue, a lot more action, and a logical progression in the storyline (I think that The Phantom Menace was just a marketing tool to interest newer viewers, I mean, come on, some of the characters were kind of lame).
Here's the situation: Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi are assigned to protect Padme Amidala (who is now a senator with the Galactic Republic), who is being threatened repeatedly by assassins that do not want her to vote on a motion preventing Chancellor Palpatine from creating a massive army.  Unbeknownst to most everyone is that someone is already producing an army, Janga Fett (Boba Fett's dad) and the evil dark lord, Count Duhku.  Of course, the Jedi Counsel finds out about it, and so begins the Clone Wars.  Meanwhile within the movie, Anakin and Padme get close, Anakin suffers a loss, he murders a lot of Tuskan Raiders and gets his hand cut off (coincidence, I think not).  The scene with Yoda and his light saber was classic!
In conclusion, this movie is a great lead-in to the as yet untitled Episode III (release date in Spring 2005), if you enjoyed The Empire Strikes Back in the original trilogy, you will really get a kick out this one.  The foreshadowing is there, you find out who Luke's mom is, and you also see the beginning of the Dark Side welling up in Anakin, what more do you need, see this movie!",1031788800,2,1765,4.584126984126984

Too much exposition, the romance segments and the dialogue is what killed this middle chapter and Hayden's acting was restrained not allowing to fulfill his character fully until Revenge of the Sith. Ewan McGregor delivers as Obi-Wan Kenobi making his portrayal as his own with a little homage to what Sir Alec Guiness has portrayed. The good parts of the film was the battle of Geonosis and Yoda's lightsaber duel with Christopher Lee which reveals the Jedi master's powerful nature. In the end, it's my least favorite among the entry over Phantom Menace (it doesn't mean that it doesn't have flaws) but was very glad that the narrative structure of the whole saga was not compromised.",1031616000,,829,4.886524822695035
1320665,3,B00003CXKT,"As a die-hard ""Star Wars"" fan, I eagerly awaited the new trilogy (actually a prequel to the original trilogy I was raised on).  I was sorely disappointed by Episode I--corny title (""The Phantom Menace""?  I know you can do better than that, George), the annoying and ubiquitous Jar Jar (who had more screen time than Obi Wan AND Darth Maul combined), Anakin's ""Yippee""s, Anakin ""accidently"" blowing up the ship (I groaned loudly in the theater), etc.  One & a half stars for Ep I; at least it had a cool saber fight in the end (except for the way Maul was offed; that was whack).
On to Episode II--well, it couldn't get worse than ""Menace"".  It was a fairly decent flick in some respects:
1. Less Jar Jar!!  It would've been better if Dooku lopped off his head, maybe in the next film...
2. It nicely showed how Palpatine continued to pit the Republic and the Trade Federation against each other, which gave him a handy reason to grant himself absolute power.  You also see that he has been planning the eventual demise of the Republic for at least ten years, as evidenced by the massive clone army--the order placed by ""Sido-Dyas"" (""Sidious""=Palpatine, heh heh).  You also see why the stormtroopers in the original trilogy couldn't nail Han Solo ten feet away.  Probably had to clone some clone troopers after Jango Fett was beheaded.
3. You see the beginning of Anakin's descent, how it stems from his arrogance and lust for power--""I will be the greatest Jedi...!""--and burning desire to get what he wants.  He wants Padme, he gets her (eventually).  He sees his mother die, he slaughters the entire Tusken Raider camp where she was held captive.  I just hope he is less whiny in Episode III.
4. You get some foreshadowing of the Jedi Order's demise.  It seems that the extended peace (before Episode I) dulled the Jedi Knights into complacency.  ""If you don't use it, you lose it.""  Seems that their Force powers atropied from lack of serious use (what was with the one Jedi who recklessly jumped in front of Jango, and quickly got shot down?).  It also explains why NO ONE sensed Palpatine's true evil intentions behind becoming Supreme Chancellor.  The battle scene between Jedi and battle droids rocked.
On the flip side, it had the WORSE romantic dialogue I ever heard.  I groaned in disbelief whenever Christenden and Portman came on the screen.  The ""I hate sand..."" bit--way corny!  And for Padme to insist (woodenly) ""I am a Senator, you are a Jedi"", and then walk around in backless, strapless outfits the next scene--pretty big MIXED message for a teen Jedi's raging hormones, isn't it?
And another thing: Threepio is seen working with Owen Lars on Tatooine.  Yet, when Owen buys Threepio in ""A New Hope"", they don't recognize each other!  You would think that at least Threepio the droid would recognize his former master.  Ditto for Ben Kenobi's first encounter with R2 in ""New Hope"".  Kenobi and R2 apparently have a LONG history together, as stated by Ep. I & II.  So why couldn't he remember the faithful droid in ""New Hope""?

It's faster and the special effects are better. Former Queen Amidala is now a matured better-looking queen. The cast of Episode I had better acting performances from everybody but the comedy and the enormous obliteration scenes make this motion picture great too. A lot of my other friends in no way ever liked Star Wars. For once (I was shocked) they loved a Star Wars flick. They are now fanatical and are also Star Wars' freaks. But Episode I gets the top Star Wars title having a better story, better acting performances, as well as better cinematography. Episode II is more a love-story and less a clone war. But then to continue the saga I guess Lucas had to add all these bits and pieces of romance in the movie.
  The action in this version was nevertheless faster than that of Episode 1's. I think the Yoda fight sequence was one of the coolest and funniest parts in the movie. Though the movie sort of stretched out in the middle, it didn't take it a long time to get back on track. Natalie Portman has a better role in this movie. Just like in Episode I, Ewan and Samuel as well as most of the cast made the movie one that will be successful due to the great group effort. Exceedingly pleasurable and faster than the eye can follow, this movie is one you should see. If you were always a Star Wars fan, an action/adventure film nut, like light humor, or silly shy romance, this is a movie you should see. Quite a few scenes that you shouldn't miss include the Yoda fight scene, Natalie Portman in action, and the city chase amongst quite a few others. The motion picture is certainly a must-see for ""Star Wars"" fans. The movie optimistically will repeat the work its predecessors have accomplished.",1031443200,10,1872,4.470760233918129

1320750,2,B00003CXKT,"Shame on you George Lucas. We STAR WARS fans waited for so long for this prequel, and what you delivered is sad, sad, sad. The weakest link is the writing. You got lucky with us 30 years ago, and the special effects of the classic Star Wars features, and the concept blinded us to their sophmoric writing. But at present, the special effects no longer knock us flat. And poor writing plus bad acting leaves us cold. Hayden Christensen is not an actor. If he is the best candidate after a world-wide search, somebody was blind and lazy. He is handsome, hollow, and his inexperience blanches every frame he inhabits. Natalie Portman struggled with her poorly written dialogue, and nearly pulled it off. Ewan McGregor is credible as Obi-Wan. The old war horse, Christopher Lee, comes off best, through sheer talent, style and grace. [ just as he held up the Trojan Horse film LORD OF THE RINGS ]. Poor Samuel L. Jackson came off even worse than he did in SW Part I. Kenny Baker & Anthony Daniels represent one of the only slender threads that drew us back to your former magnificence. Jar Jar Binks, as a character, needs to be scrapped. So, next time, George, swallow your trillionaire's pride, and hire a writer.",1031356800,12,1211,4.611111111111111

1320752,5,B00003CXKT,"Anyone who thinks this film can't measure up to the first trilogy is out of their minds.  Attack of the Clones is as good (if not better) than ""The Empire Strikes Back"".
Some people may think some of the scenes are boring. Maybe, it's because they're action fanatics who could care less about the story unfolding. That's the reason why some scenes seem to slow down, but to someone who knows the Star Wars saga, it all comes together perfect.
Yoda is absolutely amazing! One of the purposes of this film was to reveal the reason why Yoda is the master of all Jedi. Now I know! He kicks ...! Anakin's skills with the force are quite special, and Ewan McGregor should be nominated for an oscar for his role as Obi Wan. Natalie is just simply beautiful.
This movie was filmed in 100% digital.  If you haven't viewed it on a digital screen, the DVD will show you exactly how it how it should be seen.  The backgrounds will seem more realistic.  The images are more crisp, clear and focused.  Also, the musical score is simply outstanding.
If you're the type that goes for the under dog over the champ, bring home Spidey instead of Attack of the Clones. I won't!",1031097600,4,1157,4.438679245283019

To bad it was only 20 minutes into the picture, but it felt like I had been there for 2 hours.  What can I say about this movie; bad acting, bad love story, and the movie was way too long.
I think George Lucas needs to stop listening to the hype surrounding him, and find someone else to write and edit your scripts.  The dialog in this movie is terrible.
I plan on buying this just to complete my collection, and then at least I can watch bits and pieces and watch it in 20 minutes :-).

I'm a BIG Star Wars fan, and that lets me appreciate the story, but the movie itself fell flat. I remember years ago wondering why George Lucas didn't direct Empire or Jedi, and now I know. Lucas will always remain one of the best storytellers ever, but he should delegate the next movie to some other people; treat it like the first trilogy. That alone could save the three pre-quels.",1031097600,,471,4.488372093023256
1320755,4,B00003CXKT,"Yes! This is the movie Star Wars fans have been waiting for ever since that fateful year of 1977 when Mark Hamill asked Sir Alec Guiness ""You fought in the Clone Wars?""
The movie is absolutely beautiful and entertaining, much more so than its predecesor, 1999 ""The Phantom Menace"". I also liked the former, but I personally thought it was a little to slow for my taste. But my criticism never reached the level of many others, who pretty much hated the movie, for various reasons. I personally thought the movie was a decent intro for further things to come, and my major complaint was that it was too slow,which i blamed on George Lucas the director, not George Lucas the writer, but as far as the story, I thought it was good.
Why do I bring this up? Because i think that Episode II is the complete oposite: fast paced, thrilling, yet... it has a few things that bother me... were the first chapter succeeded to avoid messing with the story of the original trilogy, this one fails: a) the story of Anakin was supposed to be tragic 'cause HE was a Jedi that turned his back on his beliefs and caused all that pain and suffering. HE was the pivotal character... now however,with the inclusion of Tyrannus, the tale of Anakin loses impact, as we find out that others did the same thing HE does, which is turning their backs on the Jedi and embrassing the Dark Side... that is, as far as i'm concerned, a major blow... b) and on the same vein: the tragedy on Obi Wan (my favorite character of the entire series) was watching how he failed to save his apprentice and friend and seeing him ""die"" when he turns to the Dark Side. Obi Wan (Ben, to be precise) Kenobi is tormented by his ""failure"" with Anakin, haunted by his ""arrogance"",and yet now we discover that he wasn't the only one who ""failed"". Our revered Master Yoda failed just like him, as his ""old Padawan"" (Dooku) also turns to the Dark Side.
c) I think the character of Dooku could have been used in much more inventive and effective ways, also playing the ""Qui gon was my apprentice"" card better... I could have been a REAL  idealist, manipulated by Sidious (as opposed to him being his collaborator), and he should have been killed by Anakin, in an outburst of anger and agression of the Dark Side, forshadowing what is yet to come, but...
Anyway, I have many other complaints(that it's why i give it only 4 stars), but the bottom line is the film is absolutely magnificent as far as its entertainent value is concerned, and one can only expect that the additional footage will help improve an already extraordinaire piece of movie history. It is definitely worth the shot, whether you're a fan of the series or not. So ORDER NOW!",1031097600,2,2690,4.5010224948875255
1320756,5,B00003CXKT,"It takes alot of good acting skills to get a part in Star Wars. I've never seen better chemistry bewteen two top actors like I seen with Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portmen. Both Hayden and Natalie have been known for troubled teen like Hayden played a troubled drug user in life as a house. Natalie played a abdoned pregnant teen in where the heart is. But in both stories the ending was good for both.

In this story,Anakin Skywalker(Hayden Christensen)is back again,not like the mophead that we saw in Menace,but a strapping heartthrob. Padme' is a senator who is still representing her world in the galantic senate. The future parents of Luke and Leia have met ten yrs. later. At first it was friendship but when she id thretend,Anakin must protect her from a bounty killer. They go into hiding in Naboo. Standing on the balcony of Padme's home their love starts to bloom. There are other things about the story but the birth of Luke&Leia has not happend yet.

1320757,3,B00003CXKT,"September 2, 2002
After seeing 'Attack Of The Clones' in May, I fired off an
e-mail to my best friend, pleading with him to not see it,
calling the film ""an utter disaster."" Mostly, I think that opinion
still holds.  As a theatre experience, ""Clones"" is awful: overlong,
stiff, and rambling.  However, it rates three stars as a DVD
purchase, partly because the non-fans I know say they
enjoyed it a bit more than ""Menace"", but also because:
'Clones' is NOT a movie. It's a TELEVISION movie.
Maybe it's all the freedom permitted by video tinkering and
endless reshoots, but 'Clones' doesn't seem like a chapter
in the Star Wars saga, so much as the video game cut-scene
counterfeit of one. And the fauls of that approach (the
poor pacing, the stiff characterizations) will dwindle
significantly in home viewing. DVD owners will be left of
plenty of cool action scenes to watch, and background detail
to dissect. In this, 'Clones' seems to be following the trend,
 because the same can be said for a lot of hit movies over
the last ten years.
Still, this is the weakest of the Star Wars movie scripts
so far, with Lucas more interested in dotting his galactic
'i's and crossing his mythic 't's than in solving two
wandering first acts, a climax that seems to exist in thin
air, and characters largely incapable of charming each
other, much less us.  Lucas has always considered editing
and post-production to be his greatest strengths as a
filmmaker (and, along with his instinct for concept, they
are) but there's no post-production artist alive capable
of making a great film out of principal footage this formless
and unconvincing.
If for no other reason than its ambitious nature and
because Lucas still seems to be able to infuse his movies
with an old-fashioned charm that I find refreshing,
""Clones"" sits on the same shelf as ""Menace"" (which lacks
personality) and ""Jedi"" (which lacks energy).  Lightsabers
still go ""schwarrrp!"" and blasters go ""choo!"" and I know
I'll be watching the DVD plenty, even though it was an
awful disappointment in the theatre.",1030924800,,2060,4.824362606232294
1320758,3,B00003CXKT,"Some people saw it because they were hardcore Star Wars fans, some others saw it to see if it was any better than the disaster of the first one, and some others saw it because of the fabled Yoda vs. Duku scene. Then there are people like me - those who saw it to see Natalie Portman or Hayden Christiansen (if you're a girl).
And although this movie is definitely better than it's predecessor, it still is lacking. It has more action, more lightsabres, some familiar locations (i.e. Owen's farm on Tatooine), and [stuff] like that. So why was this movie lacking? It just didn't have that Star Wars charm that the old movies all had. And the effects in the new versions look unbelievably 'computerized'. I know you're thinking, ""well they ARE computerized!"".
This is true. But my point is that the purpose of special effects is to blend them into the movie as much as possible - these effects don't do that. They look like something that I could make on 3D Studio Max (and in fact, I did, just to prove my point). To put it bluntly, they're too simple and repetitive!
And what in the [heck] happened to Yoda's puppet?? Do they have to use computers for EVERYTHING??
The romance [stuff] was cheesy and typical. The whole 'running through the meadow on a lovely spring day' almost made me want to leave. The barely lit room with the fire, now come on! I'm surprised Anakin didn't try to feel her around a bit with that leather outfit she was wearing (we all know he would have loved that!)
Okay, I'm done nagging the effects and corny romance. The good parts of the movie, for me anyway, were seeing Amidala in some sexy looking outfits (that outfit she wore during that cheesy fireplace scene was the best)! Did any other guys out there have the urge to want to kill Anakin??
Another good aspect of this movie was that there was significantly less Jar Jar than the last movie. He's still there though, and I'm wondering at what point in the series he finally kicks it. The fact that this moron of a character was given a diplomatic role was really bewildering!",1030752000,2,2058,4.490666666666667
1320847,3,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones is the spell-binding follow-up to The Phantom Menace, worthy of the Star Wars tradition, filled with compelling characters, outstanding music along with lustrous and visceral visual effects that once again push limits of visual story telling. The master of myth and mystification has returned in his finest form creating a space opera that will hook and reward the viewer on ever-greater levels with each subsequent viewing. Lucas has recaptured his tradition of telling an elaborate mythological tale with the simplicity of a Saturday serial and some of the most stunning vistas any moviemaker has ever produced. Lucas has described his Star Wars films as silent pictures set to music and he remains true to that vision as the latest movement in George Lucas's ""symphony,"" as he has calls them, with ""recurring musical themes."" Inspired by Wagner's Ring Cycle, the Lucas' Star Wars saga takes the viewer on a hero's journey through worlds richly detailed and densely layered as a backdrop to the action. Each planet has a history and every building a story-even signs seem to have their tale to tell.
Taking place ten years after its last installment, Attack of the Clones is the teenage development of the child-like Phantom Menace with action to spare and a new mythological theme: a forbidden love that blossoms between Anakin (the doomed protagonist) and Padame, the former Queen of Naboo. This fantastic religious space epic comes equipped with modern political lessons as heroes sew the innocent seeds of their own destruction. At the peak of their prestige the Jedi, on verge of losing their grip on their (other) worldly existence, defend the Republic in the midst of growing political unrest produced by a corrupt regime trampling upon the natural rights of those they seek to protect. In preparation for these latest installments, George Lucas studied the rise of modern political dictatorships and found that all arose in relatively democratic environments as populations give up freedom to their would-be protectors. The mysterious Count Dooku, a former Jedi, emerges as a charismatic power broker and the leader of a separatist movement seeking reform. Anakin's hubris, always the down fall of mythological heroes from Icarus to Oedipus, seems destined to become the downfall the Jedi as well paving the way for the totalitarian tyranny to come (in what will probably prove to be a very dark Episode III).
The endless battles between good and evil produce a religious epic that works on a visceral level-not a humorless sermon for the ""religiously correct"" (like Left Behind) nor a fairytale unable transcend or transform as in The Lord of The Rings (the movie that draws from the Star Wars tradition leaves its hero much in the same way we first meet him by the end of that trilogy). Attack of the Clones is more like Rebel Without A Cause than The Ten Commandments and more like Metropolis than Citizen Kane. But like Orson Wells, and his equally billed cinema photographer Gregg Toland, Lucas uses every visual trick at his disposal to keep us watching the magic show and, unlike Citizen Kane, the layers run deep revealing more meaning with each subsequent viewing. As in all Star Wars sagas, the twists and turns of fate depends upon the heroic actions of a few, for it's the film's irresistible rush of action and spectacle that we have come to see.
With tongue in cheek acting and dialogue of a Saturday matinee serial, the symphonic opera's captivation begins when the music blares and the title hits the screen. As the words start crawling backwards into the darkness of star-speckled outer space, the pulp fiction fantasia begins delivering the fast and intense joy ride that Star Wars fans have come to expect from one of the great cinematic experiences of out time.
What Star Wars lacks in dialogue, it more than makes-up for with a unique sense of scale and musical story telling that rivals the best films ever made. If you want to see a good fairy tale, pick up a copy of Lord of the Rings with its superior dialogue but inferior musical score. If you want to see the masterpiece that inspired both the Lucas and Tolkein story, check out Wagner's Ring Cycle.  But if you wish to see the latest installment in one the greatest movie epics of all time, then Attack of the Clones is for you.",1030665600,,4338,4.90204081632653
1320848,4,B00003CXKT,"Following on from the disappointing and deservedly critically mauled Phantom Menace (great title awful movie) comes Attack of the Clones, lumbered with the weight of expectation of many millions of Star Wars fans who felt cheated by episode I and the baggage of having a c**p title. However, Star fans need have no fear, although not the best in this popular series of movies, it is in many departments up there with episodes IV and V levels and definitely superior to both episodes I and VI. All that said, Attack of the Clones is still a good news/bad news affair...although the good heavenly outweighs the bad.
 The bad news is that Jar Jar Binks makes an unwelcome return. Perhaps this is a somewhat muted response and stubborn refusal by George Lucas to concede that Jar Jar is the greatest mistake of the Star Wars franchise, or perhaps it is just an attempt to shift millions of unsold and unwanted Jar Jar merchandise left over from The Phantom Menace. We may never know but mercifully Monsieur Binks appears relatively briefly on this occasion, with just enough screen time to plunge the republic headlong toward disaster, in his new role as a speaker in the senate. Also on the disappointing side is the length of the movie, coming in at a mighty 142 minutes despite apparently having many deleted scenes (apparently set to appear on the DVD as extras). When will filmmakers learn the old adage that less is sometimes more? Several of the scenes were somewhat unnecessary, with the Droid factory scene being more akin to a computer game (such as Abe's Odyssey) than a movie. The Jedi lurve scenes are also substantially overplayed and in traditional Lucas style much of the dialogue is more than a little clunky and given to clich and alas, much like The Phantom Menace, there is also way too much CGI. However there is much to be thankful for in episode II...
The really really good news is that Episode II delivers in a very big way with more than 100 jawdropping action set pieces, created masterfully by ILM. Lance Christiansen as Anakin Skywalker is well cast and he perfectly captures the conflict of good and evil as the great hero destined to become the greatest villain in cinematic history. Ewan MacGregor and Samuel L. Jackson, as Obi Wan and Mace Windu are also given much bigger roles with the opportunity to flex their lightsaber wielding muscles in some juicy action scenes. There are also the additions of some great villains in the shape of Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and Jango Fett (Temeura Morrison). Christopher Lee is in particular a fantastic addition to the Star Wars cast, bringing the same credibility and intelligence to the movie as he and Ian MacKellen added to Lord of the Rings. There is also a welcome return to the darker tones of The Empire Strikes Back (perhaps this franchises greatest hour), with Anakin wreaking revenge upon a whole village of Tuskin Raiders, women and children `n all in revenge for the death of his mother. However, there is still room for some dry humour with the best lines being saved for Ewan MacGregor as Obi-Wan. ""Why do I get the feeling that you're going to be the death of me?"" asks Kenobi of his young protg.
 Although many critics will argue that in George Lucas's world CGI action and effects take precedence over dialogue and character development, most fans will resoundingly reply ""we don't care"", for Attack of the Clones is an enormous improvement on the cartoon-like childrens movie that was The Phantom Menace and for this we should be very thankful. Episode II is indeed very much a return to form; always entertaining and a great cinematic spectacle, which leaves the franchise in good health as we eagerly await the all-important episode III and the impending victory of the dark side of the force. And whilst I still cant quite totally forgive Mr Lucas for his previous indiscretion, he has given us a new hope.",1030665600,,3903,4.763663220088627

I was very disappointed when I saw The Phantom Menace. The film was too focused  on Anakin Skywalker, and it lowered its standards. I anxiously waited with anticipation for Attack Of The Clones, and aside from it being a little better, there were still alot of flaws in the film. The worst was the romance. It totally ruined the pace in the film, and talk about rehashing of certain scenes. Haven't I seen that scene with the  starship weaving through th easteroids before? Han Solo did it in the Empire Strikes Back and the ending was way too fast. I didn't know what had transpired until I read the book. And again I'm reminded of The Empire Strikes Back. The ending was the same. I just hope that with the third (and final film) that Mr. Lucas is able to tie it up nicely.",1030665600,2,902,4.331360946745562
1320850,5,B00003CXKT,"Let me start off by saying I LOVE the original trilogy.  I love all the charocters that I grew up with.  But a bunch of stubborn people who can't adapt to a new story and a new cast is really getting on my nerves.  I wish when people wrote things about the movie they would actually understand the plot first.  I defended Phantom Menace which I gave 5 star wars on the grounds which it was introducing the stories and the charocters.  Phantom Menace which was the perfect movie title, because you see how the Jedi are blinded by the dark side and their arrogance and slowly through the prequels the dark side is revealing themselves.  It was set in a time of peace.  The actors are wooden, BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPPOSE TO BE!!!  The prequels are all in peace time.  If anyone took a hint from the Attack of the Clones teaser poster which said a jedi shall not love, or hate, meaning a jedi is not suppose to let their emotions control their actions.  I love Natalie Portman and the romance she has with Anakin.  Mind you people that this is a PG rated film so they were trying to be cautious because of the child audience.  I liked Hayden Christiansen and Jake Lloyd, because Lucas is trying to portray how a young child, grown into a teenager, how certain events in one life can create the tyrant we all know and love as Darth Vader.  Also lay off Jar Jar, also Lucas is showing with him is how a clumsy uninformed goof with power can cause tragerdy by his inability to make well educated decisions.  In Ep. 4-6 Luke, Han, and Leia are fighting a rebellion of course they are going to be more emotional and hostile!  Also I am a Lord of the Rings fan, but I rate Star Wars as the greatest set of films of all time.  Spiderman was OK but not great it was just the ""flavor of the month"".  I am Star Wars fan til the day I DIE, I'm a real fan unlike the whiney other people I have to listen to!",1030665600,,1888,4.185595567867036
1320851,3,B00003CXKT,"All the hype of Star Wars Episode One was a little too much for Star Wars. The original
trilogy had basically filled the pot to the brim with water, leaving no more room for any
more. The original trilogy was a masterpiece, and because everyone loved it so much, fans
were expecting too much from the new prequels. Once you have hit the roof, the only way
to go higher is to smash through the roof. And that is what Attack Of The Clones did.
Special Effects in every scene, dialogue and jokes that were too contrived, and a few
characters that were so thin, you blow them over with a Wookiee yell. The problem with
going through the roof is you damage the building. That is what the new Star Wars
prequels have done to Star Wars.
Attack Of The Clones on the whole is not bad. It provides insight into Boba Fett's past
and we learn that his father was a great bounty hunter, we see the beginning of the Clone
Wars, and we begin to see Senator Palpatine's rise to power ... The special effects are alright, but most of them look terribly
[unreal]. For all of the clone trooper scenes, I don't know why they don't just use pictures of
an actor in a clone trooper costume, shot in different positions, and use digital rotoscoping
do make one actor look like a spaceship-full of clone troopers. I think the matte paintings
of the originals were a lot more realistic looking, but I guess it is more expensive to do
paintings-on-glass matte paintings. Yoda looks so [unrea], and should have been made with a
life-like robotic puppet that walks. I am pretty sure that is possible with our technology
today. And C-3PO climbing along the front of a hover ship (in the droid factory) to keep
himself from falling? That looks terrible! The color looks [unreal], and so do the movements
of his limbs. And quit wasting our time with unnecessary droid factory scenes. Instead, use
that time to show Palpatine turn into the Emperor. Also, watch the lightsaber fights in the
original and watch the ones in the prequels. The prequels will be a lot faster. But doesn't
faster make it more dangerous? Sure, but with fast effects shots, you can't appreciate them
and they just end up being dull.  The jokes in the movie are also terribly contrived. Then
Threepio says ""What a drag."" as his dis-connected head is dragged along by R2-D2, I
thought to myself, ""This is not Star Wars. This is not a Star Wars movie."" There is a way
to deliver a line of dialogue that is meant to be funny, in a funny way. Take Han Solo's
dialogue with a Death Star Officer over the comlink. After blasting his way into the
detention block, he is questioned by an Imperial Officer over the comlink. After Han
desperately tries to make up a story for all the blasting that went on in the detention block,
the officer gets suspicious. Han blasts the comlink and says, ""Boring conversation
anyway."" It is absolutely hilarious, but what Harrison Ford did was he purposely didn't
practice the lines so that it would seem sponataneous. That was what made it funny, and
what makes it still funny. Also, our time is wasted with dialogue attempts to tie into the
originals: ""I have a bad feeling about this"" , ""Be mindful of your feelings"". These do not
succeed in connecting to the sophistication of the originals, so they should be used less.
The rest of Attack Of The Clones is un-inspired. There is no tension in the Clone War
battle. There is no ""we better win the battle or else..."". In A New Hope, if the rebels didn't
destroy the Death Star, their base planet would be annihilated. The beginning Coruscant
chase is thrilling, and is about the only part of the movie I like. The love scenes are
terrible, and the audience never feels any emotion during the scenes.",1030492800,5,3719,4.526002971768202

This was definately the link people needed to connect the original Star Wars films to the prequels. You can really start to see all of the pieces of the Star Wars puzzle falling into place. It was a stellar hit!
I absolutely loved how Hayden Christensen portrayed Anakin Skywalker. He had enough good in him to be a jedi, yet had the right amount of defiance and edge to tell that he would easily pass over to the dark side. Also, a stellar performance was put on by Natalie Portman (Padme Amidala) and Ewan McGreggor (Obi-Wan Kenobi). They were exactly the kinds of characters you would have expected. This was definately the kind of Star Wars film many people wanted as a prequel. The love connection between Anakin and Padme: The death of Shmi Skywalker: The rage building in Anakin: The discovery of the clones: The forming of the Seperatists. It was all perfect. There were also many surprising elements in Episode II like the original movies contained, and that made this movie even better!
Attack of the Clones also left you on a cliffhanger with the unsolved mysteries of: how exactly does the republic fall? How does Anakin turn to the dark side? How did the Seperatists (the empire) obtain the clones if Yoda was the one who went and got them? I will definately see Episode III, which I expect will be even better than Episode II!

But, that's exactly the problem - the movie is nothing but visuals.  For two and a half hours, the audience is subjected to scenes after scenes of breathtaking graphics, with the actors and the plot stuck in between those scenes.  The worst part of this movie had to be the acting...or should I say the lack thereof.  Hayden C.'s portrayal of the young Darth Vader comes across as a whiner, rather than a character in deep conflict.  Oh, and the whining...did I mention that?  After watching the movie, it made me realize how good episode I was; even with the wretchedly annoying jar jar and the lack of intense battle scenes, episode I had both good acting and a fair amount of spectacular graphics.  Episode II is nothing more than an eye candy.  But I'm sure the DVD will be packed with special features and gimmicks as is a trademark of all Lucas products.

1320854,5,B00003CXKT,"I really liked this movie, even the first time I saw it.  The scope and action and story all were above the level set by Episode I.  Reminds me of Ep V in some ways, with lots of action and character development bridging the former chapter and the next (final) chapter.  At first I thought the acting was muted and originally faulted George Lucas for reigning in the talents of his stars (and substantial talent it is).
However, as I view the film more times and recall the other movies, I am coming to appreciate that this is part of the ambiance intentially planted in this series.  The first three episodes are of a society struggling to maintain composure of how things should be and remain while the original series was more swashbuckling of a renegade bunch with nothing to lose but their lives in their fight.  The moods are appropriate, and the acting (and Lucas' directing) contribute to setting those moods.
I am really looking forward to Ep III, and looking forward to seeing that one five or six times and I'm sure I will grow to appreciate it more over time as well.",1030320000,,1079,4.512820512820513

1320856,5,B00003CXKT,"I have heard a lot of people trash Episode I. I don't know why,  I liked it.  What bugs me is that they knew going in that Lucas was going back to the beginning of the Saga.  To them, I say ""STOP WHINING!""  You knew that it was going to be a neccesary evil, so why are you complaining!  Stop ruining it for those of us who actually did enjoy it!
That being out of the way, I have to say that George Lucas really outdid himself with ""Clones"".  The action and plot are great, the music is moving, and, as usual, the special effects are jaw-droppingly ground-breaking.  The arena battle, followed by the high-noon/ninja Jedi showdown between Dooku & Yoda are the highlights of the whole movie.  Adding Christopher Lee as the enigmatic Count Dooku was a brilliant casting move.
Even while using the Jar-Jar Binks character (and other things that many didn't like about Episode I), Lucas proves that he is a master story teller.  I cannot wait for Episode III.
To those who still have need to complain, I don't see any of you trying to do any better!",1030233600,,1045,4.401041666666667
1320945,5,B00003CXKT,"""Star Wars: Episode II-- Attack of the Clones"" is the fifth film in the Star Wars saga, and although loyal fans of the original trilogy will most likely love this addition to the saga, many critics detested it for lacking the vigor and flare that the first three classic films encompass.  Attack of the Clones is more or less a flawed masterpiece; focusing on the growth of Anakin as he falls closer to the dark side of the force (and his ultimate rebirth as Darth Vader), the film depicts his relationship with Padme as the downfall of the republic as well as the entire galaxy.  While one can complain that Lucas's poor writing accounts to the film's random slow and fast paced moments, the hugely rewarding ending pays off as the most exciting battle sequences of any Star Wars film- including a widely beloved lightsaber battle between the evil sith warrior Darth Tyranus and Jedi Master Yoda.  One thing that 'Clones' is missing, however, is the abundance of humor-filled Millenium Falcon sequences that made us fall in love with the Star Wars saga to begin with.  On the other hand, this is an entirely different trilogy- a much more serious, dramatic series of films than the original trilogy.  The DVD release offers several deleted scenes and documentaries that promise to keep even a casual fan of Star Wars both entertained and interested, and eagerly waiting for the final episode, scheduled for release in May of 2005.",1030147200,,1431,4.800813008130081
1320946,2,B00003CXKT,"Believe it or not, I almost didn't go see this movie.
I am a true fan of the Star Wars trilogy, and I have watched them many times over.  Needless to say, when I heard that Lucas was finally doing the rest of the movies, I hit the ceiling.  I couldn't wait for the first of the movies to come out.  I was 8th in line to see it at the new theater in town with 10 screens (8 were playing Menace).  When I left I was in a bit of a daze because of how BAD the movie was.
What really bothered me was that Star Wars is supposed to be funny, witty, and full of action. If you go back and watch the 3rd 4th and 5th movies you'll see this.  It is a major reason for their success.  Then...  George Lucas tried to direct, write and produce the movie.  I can hear the toilet flushing.
The first and second movies simply cannot stand up to the greatness of the later films.  The entire first 3/4 of the 2nd movie (aside from a few gems), to be blunt, ....  The ending almost made it worth spending money and 2.5 hours trying to stay awake.  Amidst the terrible dialog ('Every day I die a little more.') and the terribly fake love scenes (see previous line), they finally threw some action in at the end.  The last 30 mins of the movie was what we have come to love Star Wars for.
I hope that Lucas is smart enough to not have anything to do with the next movie except maybe to produce it.  He really isn't all that good at directing or screenwriting.  I really think that they have a possibility of resurrecting a good thing.
Knock on wood.",1030147200,13,1528,4.05

Anakin and Amidala did not feel awkward, as did the mother son relationship did with young Anakin and Shmi.  The action in this was beyond any of my expectations.  The second that you see the little shadow of Yoda coming around the corner, you know that it is going to be one of the greatest scenes in star wars history.  And as always the special effects go above and beyond what we could have hoped for.  This flick has it all.
The DVD is very compararable to the Episode 1 disc.  It goes without saying it is a must have.",1030147200,,708,4.407692307692308
1320948,4,B00003CXKT,"Although I was not enamoured with Ep 1, I found myself unable to condemn it, primarily because I feel it's fairly obvious it was targeting a younger audience demographic.
I often wonder if the beef over Episode 1 wasn't a tad subconsciously disingenuous - I doubt for example that the now-adult learn-edd fans of the original Star Wars were unable to recognize the film was not targeting them as they are today, but rather was targeting kids, ostensibly, them/us, as we were, when many of us were kids and saw the original Star Wars.
All one need have done is watch the kids at Star Wars (Ep 1) to see that the excitement and fervor that we felt when we saw the original trilogy was hued gold all over the new generations collective face.
So, perhaps the problem with Episode 1 was not so much within Episode 1 itself (not that there aren't legitimate gripes), as much as it might have been <gaze left><gaze right> moreso that the original Star Wars fans subcutaneously felt snubbed, as if it were ignoring us and our patronage?
^Raise-Eyebrow.
Anyway, given Episode 1 targeted a much younger audience than the one to which I belong, I am unable to critique it fairly, save to say that while it didn't necessarily function well as the contemporary Star Wars I would have preferred personally, it succeeded remarkably well in igniting the Star Wars excitement in a whole new generation.
And ultimately, I can accept living vicariously through the new kids, if I must.
Episode II conversely was far more what I was looking for,
What I liked about AOTC:
1. The Story
Episode II was appealing because it contained numerous compelling or and/or intriguing elements either in themselves or in relation to expanding on the Star Wars characters and universe.
I enjoyed the unfolding mystery and introduction of Sifo-Dyas - (whom Lucas originally nomened Sido-Dyas)
who is this ex Jedi that purportedly ordered the Clone Army? was it a pseudonym and play on words for Supreme Chancellor Palpatine aka The Emperor aka Darth Sidious? (Sido-Dyas - Sidious? - Ed)
Why did Yoda and Mace Windu exchange a surprised/disturbed look on hearing Sifo-Dyas' name?
Who altered the inter-stellar records in order to mask the location of Kamino?
is there a traitor in the Jedi-Council? could it be Mace Windu? (as a Jedi he conveniently seems to frequently be unable to feel the presence of the dark side, and often gives misleading or incorrect information)
In addition to the Space-Operatic epic traditional Science-Fantasy unfolding mystery and elements,
Other items I enjoyed:
2. The FX and the Darker Atmosphere - it's ILM top of the line, nuff said.
3. Boba Fett - the kid was very well cast - with a level of inherent cool'osity en par with Lucas' original trilogy slick casting of Solo and Lando.
4. The Rain Planet Kamino and the Kaminoans - very nicely and effectively done culminating in a satisfying Fett vs Kenobi tete-a-tete sequence.
5. Much Blade Runner influence throughout and that werks fer me.
6. Darth Tyranus - aka Count Dooku aka Christopher Lee - again, great casting, oozes menace - metaphorically felt as if lightening were flashing in the background everytime he appeared.
7 and 8. The Jedi Arena Battle and Yoda wielding a Light Saber - the former could have been better choreographed for greater impact but was none the less enjoyable, the latter was a blast.
The Less Impressive Side:
Digital film - There were several times during the film that I was taken out of the film because of the inferior grainy quality of some images.
Looking forward to seeing it in full digital glory on DVD.
I had no problems with the acting in the falling-in-love-scenes, my problem would be that it's virtually the only place that Hayden's performance is compelling.
The Future Darth Vader *whining* was probably the biggest faux-pas here, it's unacceptable, grating and (unfortunately) unforgetable/stands out.
Anakin decapitating and slaughtering the sand-people, (women, children and all) in retaliation for the death of his mother was however an impressively written and emotionally impacting sequence that fully and Star Wars resoundingly establishes the pivotal moment in his decent towards the dark side.
It foreshadows and harkens back (forward actually - Ed) to Yoda and Obi-Wan's training of Luke, ""once you give in to the dark side, forever will it dominate your destiny"" and brings things-Vader full circle.
All in all, I found Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones to be a good Star Wars, one that breaks into original trilogy ranks for me, given that I'd rank it as superior to Return of the Jedi <-- which borrowed too heavily from previous Star Wars for my liking.
Ultimately I found AOTC an enjoyable Epic Star Wars Science-Fantasy film.
Given that's what I wanted, I left pleased.

These critiques are coming from someone who enjoyed episode I except for the actor who played anakin, and jar jar binks. Now, the battle scene and the arena fight were good. But the lightsaber duel was bad. Now i did enjoy yoda's lightsaber duel, but, people in the theater were laughing. Youre not supposed to laugh at a Star Wars movie, plain and simple.",1030060800,3,534,4.572916666666667
1320950,2,B00003CXKT,"This is dull...period! Star Wars episode 2 sadly ,but truly isn't a vast improvment of the most disappoining Episode 1. Granted, George Lucas did excellent with his brilliant effects ,but he can't hide in a corner when his actors aren't doing there best. Especally the ""pritty boy"" Aniken. He ...!both him and Senator Amadalla WEREN'T BELIVABLE!!!!
This movie is filled with lazy script work and carboard charactors. The only thing that helped this movie was its ending(the ending was excellent!)and the great performances by Ewan Mcgregor,Christopher Lee, Samuel L. Jackson and especially Yoda. I think it is about time George Lucas stops directing and give it up to a better director(what about your Indiana Jones buddy, Steven!)So bottom line, not too impressed with Episode 2 ,but Dvd maybe worth it with all of the special features. And not excited to see Episode 3 if this is what you'll get. I'd rather see the rest of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings series!

1320951,5,B00003CXKT,"After the somewhat dissapointing The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones is a much more exciting instalment in the STAR WARS saga. Set about 10 years after the events in TPM, Attack of the Clones is a more action-orientated entry, with incredible battle set pieces. Hayden Christensen is Anakin Skywalker, the troubled Padawan to Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi. McGregor's performance as the great Jedi is much improved, and Christensen's journey from envious apprentice to the echoes of the future Darth Vader is impressive, creating more believable characters. And thankfully, Jar Jar is a much more subdued character than in Menace (phew!).
Boasting a strong supporting cast including Christopher Lee (Count Dooku), Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Temuera Morrison as Jango Fett, the action, this time around is bolstered by strong presences. And even if Lee is simply reprising his role as the dark Saruman the White from Lord of the Rings, he's a great character, helped with a surprisingly good quality script. In addition, Morrison makes a good impact as the father of Boba Fett.
Moving away from the plodding politics of the first film, events in this one are all about action, with lightsaber fights aplenty. Stunning combinations of CGI and live action at once make for some incredible action scenes. The romantic sub-plot involving Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman is sometimes stilted, but the main plot line makes for a truly incredible action-fest.
John William's score is brilliant, echoing his works for Superman, Hook and Jurassic Park. The CG in this film is even better, and the astonishing cities and vistas are fully realised with some incredible FX creations.
Lucas' vision of the many planets and cities are explored extensively, in particular in one scene, where we are greeted with a neon light- drenched metropolis not unlike the Rouge City in Spielberg's A.I Artificial Intelligence. Indeed, many influences have found their way into the film, including an amazing battle arena sequence reminiscent of Gladiator, albeit with lightsabers, echoes of Lord of the Rings and The Matrix-fuelled battle scenes.
The action, characters, creatures and FX all combine to create an involving experience that will leave you breathless. Star Wars fans will not be disappointed. The DVD extras are even more impressive than the special features on the Ep. 1 Disc, with a terrific Commentary, ""Making Of""s, deleted scenes, trailers, T.V spots and tons of production info.

1320952,5,B00003CXKT,"For anyone making a movie, the hardest thing in the world is making a prequel and keeping everyone happy.  I think Lucas has come through with SWII. For anyone who is a Star Wars fan or just a movie buff, once im thru, you will see what I mean. To create a prequel especially once as popular and often replayed as the SW trilogy, you have to maintain a certain aura of antiquity. Remember that this is the past you cant have vehicles and ships running around that are better than the X wing, Star destroyers and such. You can't introduce new technology or craft or weapons because a mistake like that can ruin a movie. The continuity of the SW universe has to be maintained. Another thing is that alot of people complained ""why can't he make it like Empire Strikes Back."" If you were paying attention to the movie, you would notice that he pretty much used the same formula with some upgrades here and there. Others complained that the computer graphics were horrid. Let me ask, do you really want to see claymation? If so watch Gumby!  This movie was well done.  The story line allowed you to identify, attach, or familiarize yourself with Anakin.  It gives more meaning to the character so you feel for him especially in light of whats to come.  Remember, the whole SW saga is about Anakin...his discovery, emergence as a Jedi, fall into the Dark Side and finally his redemption.

1320953,2,B00003CXKT,"I have to say that I was very disappointed with this last installment of the Star Wars Saga. I was soo looking forward to this movie and I was let down so bad. I felt that ""Clones"" was a rehash of ""Phantome Menace"", except for more elloborate fight scenes. Where do I begin ?? The beginning scenes in Coriscant reminded me of the futuristic set of Spielberg's ""AI"". If you noticed, when Obi Wan goes searching for an assassin in a bar it's full of humans !! Hold on a second, wasn't the Star Wars Universe supposed to have a multitude of aliens ?? It was such a big thing for George Lucas to have aliens that he openely stated that he felt that the original STAR WARS cantina scenes, could have benefited from MORE aliens. His dream came true when he did RETURN OF THE JEDI and the original Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition, he released much later. What a contrast from STAR WARS. Sooo what happened now ?? I felt the movie was piggy backing on other sci fi movies and didn't provide anything original. The acting and plot was shallow and lifeless, I didn't care too much about anybody. What really saved this movie was the special effects. However, we have all been in an asteriod field before, and the jedi starfighter with hyperdrive module reminded me of Deep Space Nine. What really killed it for me was how vulnerable the all powerful Jedi where. Did you see how many Jedis where laid out fighting those insect like creatures ?? And Yoda fighting with Count Dooku did it for me. Yoda flipping around making funny kung fu poses reminded me if Miss Piggy only knew how to use a lightsaber. Please !! Yoda is more than that, he's mental not physical. Christopher Lee's character was so underdeveloped, he was capable of so much more...so was Jango Fett. The only scene that was true to the Star Wars Saga was when Jango Fett and Obi Wan duke it out in the landing platform. Up to this point, from a character point of view, I don't see Anakin being of interest to the Emperor. He's reckless and stupid, plus he gets his hand chopped off and can't hold his own with Count Dooku. Not to mention the poor Tusken Raiders !! THey may look fierce, but they look so vulnerable next to a lightsaber. Is this really the person that is going to wipe out the Jedi? I think not. I wouldn't bother recruiting Anakin as a Sith Lord. The only competant soul in this whole STAR WARS Universe is Obi Wan. My advice to George Lucas is to get off the high horse and let someone else steer your franchise.

This is the time when you can definitley picture Anakin becoming darth vader,he  underwent the great loss of his mother,and he justs needs that final push to make him compleetly evil. Obi Wan seems to know this,but has not lost faith in him,yet. The jedi council has clouded visions about whats going on the galaxy,and even though it seems unlikey,only the sith could be behind it.

1321022,2,B00003CXKT,"I just don't understand why people made such a big deal out of this movie.  First of all, yes the Darth Tyranus/Yoda fight scene was great.  In fact, the last 40-something minutes of the film was very entertaining, with great special effects and thrilling action sequences.  However, before that, I found this movie to be very boring.
The beginning chase scene with Obiwon Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker was also fairly entertaining, but in all that time in between the beginning and the end (over an hour worth of film), the film fell flat on its face.  Ewan McGregor was better as Kenobi than he was in The Phantom Menace, but Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman have both seen better days- they nearly kill the film.  An immense amount of time is spent ""developing"" the romance between these two, but their acting is atrocious and there seems to be zero chemistry in between them.
Not only that, but the entire film ponders, and unlike other films, you can really feel this movie's 150-minute running time.  I can't really remember the entire film- maybe because I saw it back in May, and maybe because much of it was forgettable- but I do remember sitting in the theatre and actually feeling bored about an hour and a half into the film.  Any action in the 90-minute wasteland stretch between the chase scene and the final battle is obligatory and not well done.  For example, I personally found little to be excited about in Obiwon's battles with Jango Fett.
I realize that 0 out of 200 people will find this review helpful, but I felt I had to write it anyway.  Something has happened to the Star Wars universe in the 16-year break, because these new films just aren't as fun as the old ones.  ""Attack of the Clones"" was surprassed at the box office by both ""Spider-Man"" and ""Lord of the Rings"", and I'm afraid rightfully so because they were both far superior films.  In the mood for a ""Star Wars"" film?  Just watch ""The Empire Strikes Back"" over again.",1029801600,72,1961,4.619596541786744
1321023,5,B00003CXKT,"With the newest prequel in the magical sci-fi saga, George Lucas has created a film that is by turns thrilling, romantic, suspenseful, and powerful. Ignore the complaints the critics, like so many clones, have been throwing out against this film. Like a grand maestro orchestrating the creation of an entire galaxy, Lucas continues to add onto his dense world and powerful story with a focus and style that hasn't been this effective since The Empire Strikes Back.
Set ten years after The Phantom Menace, Episode II: Attack of the Clones follows Anakin Skywalker, future Dark Lord, as mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi is training him in the Force. They are assigned to protect Queen Padme from assassination attempts as the Republic is faced with numerous separatist factions. While this is happening, Anakin begins to fall in love with Padme, going against his strict Jedi codes, while numerous other internal and external struggles take a part in Anakin's growing dark side.
In contrast to so many other one-note plots out there, there are many simultaneous mini-stories going on in the course of this film's action - story threads that converge together wonderfully in the finale, like the assassination attempts on Padme, the romance, the rise to power of Palpatine (who will become the Emperor in the original trilogy), and the Clone Wars. All of these individual plot strands are explored in turn, and it keeps us involved. The cutting back and forth between each one gives it an exciting pace. It's a trademark of all the Star Wars movies that their plots are this rich and dense.
The last 30 to 40 minutes of the film, which show the beginning of the Clone Wars, contain some of the most frenzied, kinetic, awe inspiring battle sequences to ever be put on film, and shows how these prequels are certainly as thrilling as any of the other chapters. Imagine grand, apocalyptic shots of various soldiers, droids, lightsaber-wielding Jedi, battle tanks, attack ships, giant globe-sized transports, lasers and smoke-trailing rockets all mingling together and creating havoc. Like its predecessor, AOTC is certainly a thrilling installment with a finale that few films can best in terms of scale, visuals, and pure epic adrenaline rush.
The romance between Anakin and Padme works because it's complicated. It's passionate yet forbidden; personal yet carrying consequences for the entire galaxy. Anakin is a victim of circumstance as well as his own tragic flaws. He met Padme at an age when he was young and impulsive; the image of her has been with him all the years that he has been training to be a Jedi, the time and distance making his longing for her even stronger. The lack of a strong female figure in his life since he had to leave his mother only reinforces his impulsive and nave crush on Padme. Add to that his arrogance regarding his skill with the Force and his rebellion against Obi-Wan's ""restrictive"" teaching style, and you have all the elements for a wonderful characterization.
And make no mistake, his development throughout the movie, like Luke's in The Empire Strikes Back, is brilliant. It's the strength of the drama that it manages to make something as pure and good a feeling as love be one of the causes of his dark transformation. Not so much love as attachment. Going against the Jedi code, he develops attachments to things and people: Padme, his mother, and so on. This in turn causes him to be ruled by his emotions. When he starts to lose these things and people, he becomes afraid. To combat this fear, in order to maintain grip on things in his life, he begins to desire power, and it is this desire for power that becomes his tragic flaw. Loss leads to fear; fear leads to anger; anger leads to a desire for power. ""Someday, I'm going to become the most powerful Jedi in the galaxy,"" he tells Padme in one scene, and the scary thing is, even if we didn't know it already, we can feel the ominous truth in his words.
Hayden Christensen's multifaceted, emotional performance as Anakin might be the single best character portrayal ever seen in a SW movie, thanks to the skillful way he handles the emotionally complex role and the little improvisational details he brings to it.
The Star Wars films are organic films; they seem to live, breath and grow. Episode II has new imaginative settings - the water planet of Kamino, the hive-caves of Geonosis, the industrial wasteland on Coruscant - new appendages added onto the body of Lucas' imagination. One can see the growth of the characters introduced in Episode I as they come closer to what we know them as from the original trilogy. The film evolves visually; the designs of certain ships and soldiers begin to resemble the images in A New Hope. For example, the Clonetroopers bear a creepy resemblance to the Stormtroopers of the original films. It's like watching an entire history play out in front of our eyes.
And it's a joy to watch. At the end of the film you will have a grin on your face as wide and stupid as you will when you see those beloved words appear again for the very first time: ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...""
Like the incredible Episode I DVD, the 2-disk AOTC DVD is fully loaded: audio commentary from Lucas and the other key members of production, deleted scenes (which have their special effects restored just for the DVD), lots of featurettes and documentaries on the making of the movie, and all the trailers and TV spots. And if you weren't able to see the digitally-filmed movie on a digital projector at the theater, you will be able to get the same experience now, since the DVD format itself is digital. So knock yourself out while waiting for the originals to arrive on DVD (which won't happen until after Episode III, by the way).",1029715200,,5758,4.764764764764765

And so to the ending, it was quite refreshing. Yes, some more of the usual laser deflecting jedi skill, but with some nice twists. If this were an original movie, it would have been bigger. As far as George Lucas' intoxication, well maybe with the Star Wars ambiance, although you usually see double (Attack of the clones). HaHa! It's a good film!",1029628800,,631,4.495652173913044
1321086,5,B00003CXKT,"I've been a fan of star wars series, but this was the best of all. Great visual effects and story that makes you wonder for the next episode.",1029628800,,141,4.071428571428571
1321087,5,B00003CXKT,"First of all, this is a follow-up to the ""infamous"" The Phantom Menace(which most critics called it). Not a bad one too. TPM was ok. But this is better. In Episode II, things have become more clearer as Anakin tries to struggles with his inner feelings. And this makes the perfect moment for the Darkside to seduce Anakin, which we'll get to see his full transition to Darth Vader(I hope) in the upcoming Episode III. This is gonna be the first ""digital film"" due to it's precise digital transfer of the film, touted to be the next best thing in DVD, if I'm not mistaken. On the whole, this sequel to TPM or prequel of the Star Wars Anthology, is the best I've seen. Since you want more lightsaber fighting scenes, you got it! Double the action! Interesting plot makes this movie two thumbs up. Oh yeah, another thing is that this DVD will be anamorphic widescreen! Good for those who have a projector, widescreen plasma TV and a good home theater system to get the movie GOING. Calling all SW fans out there. This is one ""bloody-marvelous"" movie not to be missed!",1029628800,,1064,4.518134715025907
1321088,4,B00003CXKT,"Episode 1 and 2 were satisfactory in my opinion, but there was just that ""too good to be true"" aura around it and Lucas gave in to a pet peeve of mine.. the ""heroes"" were made untouchable, predictable, and the stereotypical ""good guys."" The original trilogy revealed flaws in each character, and it delved deeply in to the imperfection of the situation.. but emphasized their earnest will to live to tell the tale.
GL's true colors showed, I think, when he made the Ewoks instead of the initial Wookies. Okay, that was acceptable.. but he underlined his inclinations when he submitted to Jar Jar and that entire species. What I did like was the mystery that shrouded the species on Kamino in EP II, and all that.. true science fiction.
But I'm thinking, perhaps, that this is his plan.. after all, this IS all just one big saga and it's a common strategy for writers to make everything all nice and happy until the climax. We just shouldn't have been forced to wait through two movies and 8 years for that moment. The problem was, nothing monumental happened in Episode 1.. it was like we were just sitting around waiting for something to happen.
I believe Star Wars will truly be saved if GL executes Episode 3 properly.. I want that same atmosphere when Darth Vader enters the room, I want to see an imposing movie that strikes fear and awe, not a stifled laugh as oversized balls chase around an animated cartoon you could care less about.
What more, is how Lucas animated everything. Sure, if he wants to make the movie look ""high-tech"" - or in other words make it look like every other recent movie released. The trilogy had actual models, physical models of ships and so forth made out.. it looked real, with the classic kicked around and dirty ships, obvious wear showing, the believable effects of a seasoned fighter craft.. the attention to detail they paid.
I call this prequel a lazy attempt. As I said, it's satisfactory, in my opinion.. but it's not up to par with the obvious standards they set two decades ago. I enjoyed these movies and I don't want to be considered just another stalwart critic. I enjoyed them, but no more than I've enjoyed any other movies I've seen lately.",1029542400,3,2193,4.611253196930947

1321090,5,B00003CXKT,"I would give this movie four and a half stars. It is good, but still lacks the power of the first trilogy.
Episode I definitely made me upset. It had Jar - Jar Binks!, and the only things that really saved the movie were the Pod Race and the final battle, although I didn't like Darth Maul getting killed so easily. But now, in Episode II we have less Jar - Jar and a lot of more action, a kick as memorable and really powerful Sith Lord (Count Dooku a.k.a. Darth Tyranus, played by Christopher Lee) who will have a better mythological role in the Star Wars saga than Darth Maul, a lot of more action, an epic Jedi battle and amazing direction. Lucas finally reminded me why he is my hero. The visual composition is grate, the texture, the combination of colors, the change from scene to scene looks grate, the environment, and the special effects impressed me (something really difficult). Yango Fett was an extraordinary choice, and the movie has more plot than the last one. A lot of hints about how the Emperor's rise to power and intelligent conspiracy to take over the Galaxy are given (Perhaps what I liked more).
I agree the movie has its flaws, for example, that's not the way I imagined Dart Vader in his Anakin Skywalker days. But the formula still works, specially when Anakin starts showing ""dangerous characteristics"". The romance was a little of ""pretty boy and pretty girl meet"", but I also recognize Lucas only had little more than two hours for that and the rest of the story, which happens to be a lot of work. The Yoda fight was extraordinary, until the light sable part. Telepathy and knowledge of the Force was more than enough to prove why Yoda was ""The Master"" and a grate Warrior And R2 D2 with rocket launchers?!
But the point here is that the movie entertains and grants an amazing expectation for Episode III, which I hope will be the best of all the other movies.",1029542400,10,1892,4.502906976744186
1321091,5,B00003CXKT,"I can't wait until November when this comes out. It won't be the same experience as the theater, but now I will be able to pause and rewind. As for a review of the movie, IT'S STAR WARS!, some people get it, some don't. The critics never do. The action sequences are amazing, the effects are amazing, the music is amazing, the plot is fast-paced, and the acting, well, it is star wars, the acting/dialog is never that great. Lucas has always said that the movies are designed almost as silent films. The music is the important part.
  That being said, Ewan's Obi Wan is coming closer to Alec Guiness's and Hayden's tormented Anakin is much deeper than Anakin in Ep1. The plot twists are great. George shows us that it is impossible to anticipate where he is going with the story even though we know the end. The lightsaber battles dwell less on the technical aspects and more on mood, much like the great sequences in the originals.
  Small details are what sets Lucas apart, pay attention to the variety of characters and images in the chase scene, the bar scene, and the senate. Look how closely the Lar's house is recreated from Ep. 4. Pay attention especially to the sounds and score. Elements from the orginal movies are added to emphasize points and to create continuity.
  Overall I would rate this movie at number 2 on my Star Wars list, barely edging out episode 4. Number 1 is of course, Ep. 5. I would have liked to see more of Anakin's dark side, such as in the Tuskan raider camp, but hopefully Ep 3 will be full of that.",1029542400,,1534,4.4412811387900355
1321092,5,B00003CXKT,"In ""Clones,"" Lucas offers up the most complex story-line in the series yet, taking Star Wars beyond its traditional good v. evil roots into novel territory: good becoming evil v. evil. Though you cheer for Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Padme, you understand that they're all unwittingly serving a deceptive leader. Moreover, Anakin begins his conversion to the dark side, spurred not by innate evil impulses, but by love for both Padme and his mother, a love frustrated by his duties to the Jedi Order. Thus, the film carries with it a sense of impending tragedy in which nearly every character in the film, good or evil, is a sympathetic figure. ""Clones"" features good performances from all its principle actors, unparalleled special effects, beautiful cinematography, and Lucas' best directing of the series. Both children and adults should have a great time watching this film.",1029542400,2,871,5.140845070422535

I have seen AOTC five times at the theatres.

That was one of the most unforgettable moment of the Star Wars movies.
And the special features will be great. Making of Saga, Across the Stars Music Video, Theatrical Trailers, etc.
I will see it again for the first time.",1029542400,,452,4.6625
1321176,5,B00003CXKT,"I thought the movie was great. There are several things to remember for ppl who hated it.
1. If you are expecting it to give you the same excitement as when you were 12, you will be disappointed. A lot of fans that were 8-15 years old when the original Trilogy came out are the most disappointed. Let me give you a hint: you are not gonna get the same thrill at 35 as you did at 10.
2. Episode 1,2,and 3 are not supposed to be exactly the same as the old ones! They are companions, prequels, not CLONES. They are separate, and set in a different time period.
3. Star Wars is not Shakespeare! Don't take it so seriously! The movies are meant to be fun! Just enjoy the good, interesting parts! So it isn't going to win any acting awards. So what?
4. You people seem to have this idealistic veiw of the Old Trilogy. Like the acting was always terrific. Like the lines were never cheezy. Like there were no annoying characters (C-3PO, and the Ewoks were kind of strange) And I have heard people say Anakin is a whiny brat. What about LUKE? ""Uncle Owennnn!"" Just have fun with the movies! Stop taking it so seriously!",1029456000,2,1112,4.274881516587678

1321179,5,B00003CXKT,"I found this entry in the Star Wars saga to be the most exciting since Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. I will agree that it could have been shorter, as some scenes were not needed and at times caused this sleepy spectator to look at his watch. But I was overall very pleased, especially after the mess that became known as the Phantom Menace. The last forty-five minutes of this movie alone deserve 5-stars. It's the most breath-taking forty-five minutes ever in film. Now if Lucas could have written something better for Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman to say in their ""falling in love"" scenes.

The Phantom Menace in my opinion couldn't overcome the hype, or even close. But Attack Of The Clones is most certainly an improvement over that installment as well as a thrilling film for all ages. Now, I am no Star Wars fanatic, I like the movies, They were some of the best fantasy movies ever (Although honestly if you want to see an even better fantasy film check out Lord Of The Rings, Which I am a devoted fan of). This movie isn't epic by any standards but it's fun, Isn't that the point of Summer movies? This is a great film. A very Fun film. One that will go down as one of the better Star Wars Installments. Pay no heed to the critics, or if you do make sure they have a good track record in your opinion. This is Star Wars as it was made to be! Fun and exciting! If you want to see an epic thinking movie this summer go see Road To Perdition. This isn't that, but it is very simply put, A Fun movie!

1321182,5,B00003CXKT,"No, this movie isn't like the original trilogy.  It's not intended to be.  The whole purpose of Episodes 1-3 are to enrich the story of Episodes 4-6.  The conflict is on a much larger scale--the Empire is being organized, Palpatine is seizing control, the Jedi are waning, and Anakin is slowly giving in to the dark side of the force.
There are many things that make this movie great.  First, the story was great, and the plot intricate enough to stay interesting throughout the movie.  Second, the special effects were spectacular, yet not over-used.  Third, the fight scenes were intense and well-choreographed, and very entertaining.
Obviously, the highlight of this movie lies in the battle at the end, when we finally get to see an army of Jedi (something we die-hards have only dreamed about for years) battling the forces of evil.  I also really enjoyed the fight with Yoda and Dooku.
Attack of the Clones is a great addition to the growing Star Wars universe.  When viewed as a lone movie, it has some noticeable flaws.  When seen as part of the larger story, however, those flaws are quickly swallowed up in the epic proportion of the legend that is Star Wars.
This movie is a great entertainer the whole family will enjoy, as well as a classic chapter in the Star Wars saga (for the hard-core fans), and a great adventure for those who just like a good story.",1029456000,,1369,4.647302904564316
1321183,3,B00003CXKT,"Obviously this movie needs no introduction....and most people interested in the DVD have probably already seen it (and judging by the sales ranking- preordered it!).  The Star Wars universe holds a place in many of our hearts and I was excited to hear Lucas announce his plans for the prequels 4 years ago. ...I didn't get my hopes up for AOTC.  ...BR>I walked out AOTC pleasently surprised because it was better than the Phantom Menace, but thats not saying much.  Visually the movie was amazing and the sound was first rate- both givens coming from Lucasfilm film picture who stil do it better than anyone else.  The story was acceptable (we already know what's going to happen and who the Emperor is!) and the pacing was fine.  Of course the dialouge was lacking and the development of Anakin's and Queen Padme's relationship was overdone.  Lucas tried to capture the same magic Ford and Fisher brought to Empire, but the chemistry just wasn't there mostly due to Hayden's poor acting.  ...  The little things and the lack of annoying Jar Jar is what really helped this film.  Yoda wielding the stick, and Boba-Fett's dad getting his ... kicked were both pretty entertaining. The whole stadium showdown and Count Dooku fight were great action sequences.
Bottom line....is this a great movie-NO.
Is this movie for you if ... you're like most of America and prefer bigger, louder and faster vs. acting, story, and character development - YES

1321235,5,B00003CXKT,"First off, this movie was beyond my expectations. Though the acting was not great, it didn't need to be. The whole movie is supossed to be like a 40s or 50s saturday matine. Many critics rushed to attack this movie with all of the negative force they had but never seemed to realize that the ships, the acting, the NAME were all things of those old serial styles. 'Attack of the Clones,' the name itself is outdated...ON PURPOSE. Many people tend to forget that.
Secondly, many fans also attack this movie because it contradicted the books. This  Star Wars story is George Lucas' and not Kevin J Anderson's (Though, some of his stuff WAS good) or Timothy Zahn's. It was almost as if George Lucas purposely defied the books, which was good. It showed the authors ""This is my story and I will not change my story for your pleasure.""
Overall, you can see this movie on many levels, 1. as an uptight movie critic, 2. a fan and dive into the deeper side of the story by reading between the lines, 3. as a Loyal Expanded universe fan and not enjoy it, 4. or as someone looking for some fun.

This is probably the best film in the series since ""The Empire Strikes Back"", my favorite of the VADER Trilogy. I loved the action, the acting (this probably had the best in the saga), the visuals, and the story. Lucas knows what he's doing, folks, and he's doing this for himself. Not the thirty seven year old sci fi nerds in the wet spaces of their parent's basement, writing their own fantasy dreams of the way they see things SW related. This is Lucas' baby, its his story. And I can't wait till I see Episode III and the work he gives us later on. And I most definately can't wait for this DVD!!!",1029369600,,793,4.258278145695364
1321237,4,B00003CXKT,"First, let me speak to that timid, timorous voice of fractured expectations haunting our skulls since TPM.  Shush!  This is the movie we've coveted in the holiest of holies of dreams since millions of Ewoks (disappointingly) failed to be pulverized by a hail of superheated Death Star debris.
From the first moments after the disappearance of a crisp screen crawl, this film flies directly into its relentless quest to saturate our senses with shockingly delicious imagery. Gods below! What special FX! I can only imagine a wholesale re-staffing (or a group consciousness-raising exercise, perhaps involving some belladonna-like alkaloids) taking place at ILM!
Gone are the super-slick, lovely-but-affected `ILM grays.' This film is textured down to fractal levels of detail. It has grit. It has contrast. It has heat distortion from engine ports, glittering droplets of rain, hypnotically languid waves on a low-gravity ocean, quick, shaky photo-journalistic zooms during apocalyptic battle sequences with chips and scratches on helmets in the far background while hundreds of dust-smeared blaster bolts tear through heavy metallic hides of immense space ships and...
GAH!!
No words...should have sent a poet!
Typical. I had to start with FX. These are what immediately kicked me in the arse and convinced me that ILM had, once again, set the bar to an entirely new place!
What truly gripped me, though, was that there was actually a MOVIE attached to those blazing visuals. A damned good one. Who'd a thunk it?
This is a morally, politically, emotionally, and tactically complex film. Sure, it keeps you bouncing in  your seats and yowling like Slim Pickens riding that bomb (short cut to mushrooms? Sorry.). What it also does, though, is tell a rich, layered, sobering, authentically moving tale. It is the story of things passing away.
MILD TO MODERATE SPOILERS AHEAD
Christensen's cocky, heedless, impulsive Anakin nails the archetype of the Brash Young Man with surprising subtlety. He's drunk on his power and youth, a True Believer in his myth of personal immortality, Icarus incarnate. He is a Buddhist's (or a Jedi Master's) nightmare! He covets.  The pain of his love for Padme is palpable. We feel it in his hungry gaze. This is a boy struggling to find completion, and suffering because he seeks it always from outside himself. Obi Wan won't validate him (one wonders how a certain Middle-Eastern carpenter would have gotten along with his step-dad, Joe...), Padme won't look at him the way he looks at her, while a lost mother haunts his dreams. He yearns, and, when his longings go unmet, he rages. If he is occasionally annoying (and he is!), it is only because we KNOW him. He is an annoying PERSON, not an annoying part, or an annoying performance.  We watch as he's maneuvered to the cliff's edge by his own grasping, and feel it, as he is ultimately undone by the strategic fulfillment of his heart's desires. There is characterization here like we haven't seen since TESB.
Mad Props to Ewan McGregor! The subtle, non-verbal homages to Sir Alec, first evident in TPM, are just a bit more prominent in this installment. He manages to convey a transitional stage in the maturation of this character which is never forced, never...impersonation. That young bloke can ACT! Obi Wan is focused, authoritative, and NOT to be trifled with. But, too-soon released from his apprenticeship by a star-struck Qui-Gon Jinn, he lacks the depth and experience to appreciate what is happening to his Republic...and to his apprentice. He is troubled by trends he can sense, but can never seem to divert. His fate is foreshadowed in one bittersweet joke, but also in his nave declaration of victory at a very dark moment indeed.
As much of a disservice as it is to the many superb individual performances in this film, I need to talk about two doomed characters of a rather more abstract nature: the Republic and the Jedi Order. Their fates are joined, and the feeling of their deterioration pervades the film. They are set in their ways, confident in their power, and entirely blind to the rot growing from within. Only Yoda seems to see it. Imagine the Dalai Lama's rueful resignation as he watched the Chinese advance on his land. That's the sense you get from Yoda's surprisingly unobtrusive CGI face as he contemplates an Order grown so decadent as to declare primly that ""if it isn't in the archives, then it doesn't exist."" His gradual awakening to the fact of an end-game to whose beginning he'd been completely oblivious is a wrenching sight. He realizes that someone's manipulated the motivations and vulnerabilities of his Order, his society, and even himself, steering them toward choice point after choice point, positioning the players so that the only possible decisions are those which push them closer to their inevitable ruin. And he is sad.
(And he is one [tough] little green dude with a saber. Nuff said.)
It's been said (Plato? Frank Herbert? Thucydides?) that democracies inevitably deteriorate into oligarchies...and that dictatorship is not far behind. Lest we huff and puff too righteously against such heresy, let us pause and contemplate the French Revolution's fate. Or else, just go see AOTC. Lucas' rumored disenchantment with, and grim prognosis for,  the state of modern democracies is in full force here. The viruses which effect this fatal mutation in the Old Republic are the calcification and corruption of bureaucracy, the ruthlessly pragmatic avarice of banking and trade conglomerates, the crushing juggernaut of technocracies...all quietly subverted and maneuvered by the insidious (pardon pun) Will to Power. There is some extraordinarily mature (and eerily familiar) political commentary here, light years from the desiccated, two-dimensionally technophobic sketch of TPM. Machiavelli would be proud of the way in which, bit by bit, even the wise are enticed to give away power, ignorant -until it is too late- of how that power has been channeled into fewer and fewer hands, till the only one left is the one with the leash.",1029283200,15,6069,5.076152304609218
1321238,5,B00003CXKT,"This movie was spectacular. The new worlds (Kamino and Geonosis) are visually great and the action scenes could not have been better.
The final 30 minutes of the movie is something more amazing than anything you have ever seen before. The Geonosis battle between the Jedis and thousands of super battle droids, followed by the arrival of the clone army and the duel between Dooku, Yoda, Anakin and Obi-Wan.
This is Star Wars at its best.",1029283200,,437,4.7631578947368425
1321239,1,B00003CXKT,"I have read a few reviews and discussed this film with many. I must announce this: Lucas was so desperate that he allowed horrible acting and his own feeble writing to continue ruining one of the greatest film series in story telling history. When you concieve a story your thoughts are not complete- granted. When you write a screenplay to complete that story and bring it to fruition, you must be true to the characters and the parameters which the SAGA have been built. Lucas forgot ALL OF THIS. He tried to squeeze too much story into too litle time. If I had to sit in the theater for an extra hour so he could convey the story correctly, I would gladly have stayed.
Jango Fett- a flat, empty character. Boba Fett- a flat, empty character. Anakin Skywalker- a whining, sniviling brat. A rookie policeman with a lightsaber with no real wielding of the Force or realization or conceit of his true potential. Obi Wan- wasted! Don't do this and don't do that! He should have been a nurturing Father-like mentor- not a teed-off dad who's tripped over too many toys at the end of a hard days work. The romance was FORCED- and not by the Force either.
I could rip this film to shreds for hours. If you are a true Star Wars fan, watch it again and see what IS and not for what you hoped. It is not there. Not to mention the stolen scenes from The 5th Element and Gladiator and Monsters Inc. Just realize- not fantasize. This movie, acting, directing, cgi, monsters, dialogue, blocking- and so much more was so much wrong! I am truly saddened and disappointed. This one made Epidode I worth watching.",1029024000,9,1596,4.487972508591065
1321240,5,B00003CXKT,"All right, I see that a lot of people are like trashing Star Wars and saying that Episode II was really bad but it really did live up to my expectations.
Not many girls like Star Wars and all the guys think that the romance was cheesey and too mushy but I actually really liked it.
The special effects were awesome. The costumes and designs were also really neat too. The scenery was absolutely beautiful. My favorite parts was the chase in the beginning with Anakin and Obi-Wan and the Geonosian arena. Also, the part with Yoda was funny and cool. You finally get to see him fight with a lightsaber.
I thought that Padme was really pretty and she's much better as a galactic Senator, you get to see her on a more personal level. And Anakin definitely was on the fine line between good and evil, you can see how he's grown from a child to a man, and then to Darth Vader. He's also extremely HOT.
The tiny problem might be that Anakin and Padme got married too fast. You see them just overnight they begin to fall in love and, then just a few days later they get married. The book was better and they should have at least slowed the love down a little.
In the last episode I was bored to tears in but episode II was so much better. I really recommend it if you like action and sci-fi stuff and not to mention a little romance.",1028851200,,1325,4.2204724409448815
1321241,5,B00003CXKT,"FYI: Lucasfilm scheduled the DVD-release of Episode II for November 13th according to their newsletter.
First of all, I can clearly imagine what kind of people are considering this movie to be the worst ever:
All those authors who wrote books about the Star Wars - and claimed to be the keepers of the one and only truth.
Let's see what was changed and who would not like it:
The Clone War runs completely different (Ouch! Timothy Zahn)
The Clones do not become crazy because of the force (Zahn again)
The Death Star wasn't invented by Bevel Lemelisk and Qui Xux (Sorry, Kevin J. Anderson)
Boba Fett's real name isn't Jasper Merees (Sorry again, Mr. Anderson)
Yoda does have a lightsaber - and KNOWS how to use it (Bad Luck for Dave Wolverton)
There can be good weather on Corouscant (you see, Mr. Michael A. Stackpole)
E.T. sits in the Council Chamber (in your eye FBI, CIA, NSA,...)
and the list goes on and on and on.
To me, Episode II is one of the very few movies that not only met my expectations, but exceeded them in almost every single aspect.
The love story is being kept endureable short, the characters are much more developped that in Episode I and the Special Effects are - typical for ILM - the very best so far.
From the moment, the Naboo shuttle approaches Corouscant up to the last second before the Credits are running, this movie dishes out eye candy like nothing before.
And of course John Williams supplies the well-known soundtrack.
Mix this all together with the biggest and longest battlefield scene since Gladiator, Spartacus and Rambo III, and you do have the best Star Wars Episode so far.
Especially since Yoda - in the best scene of the movie - prooves once again that size doesn't matter ;-)",1028851200,3,1722,4.576051779935275
1321242,5,B00003CXKT,"Anyone who knows Star Wars can appreciate that this piece is more of a narrative bridge into E3 and the Original Trilogy.  It is not some mindless ""eye candy"" for the attention depraved (although the action sequences were top notch) and for those who can not tolerate a plot that involves considering this film as a piece of an overall whole.
Lucas has redeemed himself in my eyes after that travesty in 1999.  Thanks for everything.",1028764800,,433,4.684210526315789

  To be frank, The Lord of the Rings was everything I expected this movie to be-great plot, sense of evil, great effects, true emotion.  The romance in clones was pretty wooden.
  So I will not purchase this dvd, but I already bought Lord of the Rings. Call me a convert.",1028764800,3,538,4.552083333333333
1321313,5,B00003CXKT,"Ok, first of all, I would like to say that all of the people out there who went to this movie expecting it to be exactly on the same level as the older trilogy, and left feeling disappointed by the story, or the characters, or anything else.  You can't expect it to be the same at all.  The first trilogy was set during a civil war, during a dark time.  The characters were varied. You had a rogue, a princess, a wookiee co-pilot, an old war hero jedi, and a young antagonist with hidden potential, who all came together to defeat a common enemy.  Now, flash back a few decades.  It is a peaceful time, but with a stirring in the air, of a coming change.  The government is becoming stale and corrupt, and the Jedi are losing their mystique and grandeur, because they are attached to the stale government.  So, you can expect a few things.  Dense political plotlines, corrupt individuals, Jedi who aren't in touch with their powers anymore, and a more old school soceity.  You must understand this.  Han Solo would never blend in an environment such as this, he wouldn't match.  The characters in this movie were superb in my opinion, because they fit the times that they were set in.  Obi-Wan (Ewan) was much more fleshed out, and you could tell that he was scared for Anakin, and his fear would lead to failure in his training of Anakin.  Anakin ( Hayden) also came to full veiw.  No longer the child who screamed ""wizard!"", He had come into the light as a troubled young man who would become The Darth Vader we all know.  And Yoda, I know there are a few people out there who said that yoda's fight was sacrilige, I disagree.  Yoda has trained for hundreds of years, His skills would reflect that.  And add the fact that he wasn't at the end of his life like he is later.  Padme was the same, but for good reason.  Mace had more screen time, and Dooku was a good addition to the story, it's good to hear some smack talking in a fight.  I miss that. The movie exceeded my expectations in many ways.  I now have to wait a couple more years to see the empire rise to power and the climactic lightsaber battle that is inevitable, but I can make it now, thanks to the second chapter not sucking.  Now I can watch a newer Star Wars DVD without wincing, the years will pass more easily that way.",1028332800,42,2291,4.31615925058548
1321314,1,B00003CXKT,"What a waste of a perfectly good saga! I'm sorry, but I would rather have watched every single 'Never-ending story' movie than this horrid excuse of a film!
1) This ""movie"" has absolutely no Star Wars feel to it at all. It's just a bunch of flashy spaceships and robots (all CGI, of course!) flying around shooting bright red and green lasers at each other with a bunch of familiar characters thrown into
the middle of it all.
2) There's no freakin' plot for goodness sake! Wow, Obi-Wan goes hunting for some clones, and Anakin falls in love with Padme. Whoa, George! Slow down! You lost me way back when Jar-Jar was given some more screen time, what's going on again? Oh, yeah. Nothing worth remembering more than the 2 hours of torture the audience has to endure while the movie is still playing.
3) Count Dooku (whoa, George did u think of that name when watching Sesame Street or something? What kind of evil, villain name is that?) was not the menacing bad guy in the background of the plot making things harder for our heroes that every Star Wars movie so desperately needs! He just shows up half way through the movie and talks to Obi-Wan for a few seconds and chops off Anakin's arm at the end. If you're going to make a bad guy, George, give him some more life, and more things to do to disrupt the progress of the good guys!
4) George, when are you going to realize, you don't need 10 billion CGI shots in a movie to make it look real? I mean, the original dewbacks who couldn't move at all in the original Star Wars looked more real than those 'creatures' in the arena at the end of the movie!
5) The lines in this movie are quickly forgotten. Don't even get me started on the Anakin and Padme 'attraction' because there wasn't any accept in the director's head. Even the ""skills"" of the actors couldn't make the lines on the script more heartfelt. They were just horrible! Or how about when Anakin's mom dies?! PLEASE! Has there ever been a worse on-screen death in movie history? ""Oh, you've grown so much, I'm so proud of you, I love..., I love..., uggggh""! I would rather have to memorize every single meaning of every word in the dictionary than watch this scene ever again!
6) To be completely honest, the only character I felt any sort of connection to was Watto when he had his brief 30-seconds of spotlight. He was a corny, delightful addition to the movie, and I don't really know why. He's not a hero, he's not a villain, he's a middle man. You feel this sense of pity on him since he can no longer even fix a simple droid any more. It's sad to see how memorable and well-written the characters in the first trilogy were and how the second one has only supplied me with one character I actually enjoyed seeing on-screen.
7) The only good thing about this movie was the score. I admit, John Williams did a good job in conveying the real feelings of what the characters should have portrayed on the screen. I really enjoy the ""Across The Stars"" song, and all the music for every action sequence was well-written! That's at least one thing I can find enjoyable about this movie. Frankly because George Lucas had little-to-no say in what the music sounded like. Cudos, John for a wonderful score. Maybe George will make a script to go along with it next time.
I'll be honest, I was truly a die-hard fan of Star Wars 'till Episode 1 hit theatres. I'm sorry to say it, but George, you've ruined a perfectly good saga and replaced it with two consecutive hyped-up, big money, all talk, no walk movies. I hope for the sake of the fans that you take a hint from your critics instead of your yes-men for once! Maybe you will still be able to salvage what dignity and respect is left in the Star Wars universe and put together a decent film for those of us who have been let down by the last two!",1028246400,13,3807,4.3861386138613865
1321315,4,B00003CXKT,"Far, far away from the original ""Star Wars"" I saw 25 years ago, ""Episode II"" has now given a bigger scale about everything, and goes like an old 19th century novel such as ""War and Peace"" -- it's very long (exceeds 140 minutes), it has so many characters (more than 50), and it has double, or at times triple plots that go on at the same time.  But what happens to major characters, we know already, as you see.  Considering these things, ""Episode II"" did a fairly good job though it won't convert those who are not devoted fan, or who haven't experienced the sensation of the very original ""Star Wars.""
If you haven't seen or known anything about the saga (and some of you surely not), you will be just perplexed to watch part of large canvas of this epic.  In such case, go to the ""Star Wars"" page and buy DVD of the original one, where you shoud start.  Don't go to ""Episode I,"" and don't jump into this film.  I hate to say this, but Lucas fails to hold well the story about the Jedi Knights' attempt to protect Queen Amidara from assasination, and their war against insidious Count Dooku.  I, after having seen all of the franchise at theater, couldn't see  why the Jedi Knights are not allowed to love women.  Did we know that before?
If you have seen only ""Episode I"" and were once dismayed at its inept direction, don't be worry.  ""Episode II"" is much improved, probably after thorough research about audience's responce on the moviemaker's side.  Jake Lloyd has grown up to become Hayden Christensen (good!), and notoriusly noisy Jar Jar whatever is put aside, so you see so little of him (thank Heaven!).  Natalie Portman is given more substantial role, and so is Ewan McGregor.  Veteran actors are not wasted -- Christopher Lee is fantastic as Count, showing real 'menace' that lacked in the previous entry of the series, and about Yoda, you can see his fighting, which is very cool (and strong too!) indeed.  Even though the use of special effects are not original, it has been upgraded for this release, shot with 100 per-cent digital techinique.
Okay, but we got bad things, too.  Beside the clumsy storytelling, the film gives us a love story between the young lead which is too corny, as if Lucas is making a parody of old melodrama.  Some ideas should be removed from the final take, especially the unfunny one about R2D2's severed head, which inteds to be funny in vain, and Lucas again betrayed his loss of touch when he let a kid character involved in a fight scene (I mean Boba Fett), which ends up with an awkward result for family viewing.
AND for long-standing fans, what can I say?  They like it anyway, and this time again Lucas introduced sub-liminal reference that might be appreciated by fans of the series.  One exchange of dialogue predicts the fate of Obi-wan and Anakin, who gets hurt in the same way as his son would receive in ""Episode 5.""  Or, Christopher Lee's Count Dooku, which naturally reminds us of another Count Dracula he played in and after 1959, also leads us to the memory of Peter Cushing, who played Doctor Van Helsing with him, and later, of course, Grand Mos Tarkin in ""Episode 4."" And so on, and on.  Surely if you love this series, you can talk a lot about this film.
As a whole, then, this film's impression is greatly influenced by previous knowledge of the series.  It is hard to evaluate this one per se, but as a fan of the series, this is a slightly  above average one.",1028246400,2,3428,4.514563106796117
1321316,5,B00003CXKT,"This is not a true review, only a few thoughts.  As far as I'm concerned just John William's awesome soundtrack score alone is worth the admission price. Also, just the speacial effects alone portrayed in this movie is worth the admission price. And finally, just the being able to watch Yoda wield a lightsaber and kick some major ... is, by itself, worth the admission price.  And I've deffinately seen it more than 3 times.  Yeah, OK, I'm a huge Star Wars fan from my earliest childhood, but all you naysayers out there need to re-examine what it is you want in a movie.  This film is fantasy set in a sci-fi atmosphere and it's for entertainment and enjoyment.  As far as I'm concerned, It delivers -- big.  Yeah, maybe the acting won't win oscars, but I thought it was fine and fit the story perfectly.  George himself said that these movies almost play like silent movies set to music - It's true.  There is a lot of artistic beauty and imagination to appreaciate in this film. And yes I stay in the theater until the last note of the end title score is finished.  In summary I'm a musician and an artist who happens to love mythology and the classic stories of good verses evil displayed on a grand scale.  This and all the other Star Wars movies appeal to me on these levels.",1028073600,19,1283,4.421276595744681
1321317,3,B00003CXKT,"Ok first let me say that I am a BIG fan of the Phantom Menace! I don't know how any Star Wars fan coulnd not like it, in some ways it was superior to the previous (technologically speaking). With that being said, I was a little disapointed with this installment. Perhaps I was sitting too close to the screen so I missed something and now I will have to wait until its released to see it again. There were no fight scenes like in Phantom Menace (even if you didn't like the movie, you must admit the scenes with Darth Maul, Qui Gon, and Obi Wan were very cool), the fight scene with Yoda was laughable, and there were too many  jokes. This is a war we are talking about here! I didn't go to see a comedy. I did like the change you see in Anakin, as he moves toward the Dark Side, and it will be a treat to see in the final chapter of the saga. A word of advise? See it more than once. I am hoping that will spark my appreciation once again because after waiting so darn long for this one...well I'm not sure if it was worth the wait.",1027728000,,1033,4.014563106796117
1321318,4,B00003CXKT,"Folks, please try to remember that Episodes I - III are a completely different approach than IV - VI.  While IV - VI are extremely story driven, I - III are more character driven, and that may be the problem for many viewers.  Yes, folks, instead of the linear story of IV - VI, this trilogy is a bit more complicated - you have to THINK and PAY ATTENTION to what's going on.  It's not the roller-coaster ride of the second trilogy - there is a real plot going on here.
That said, Phantom Menace was not the, well, menace, so many depicted it to be.  It was flawed, but still a good movie.  Most importantly, it sets up Attack of the Clones, a combination mystery and romance, which brings us to the (granted, obligatory) climatic battle, which, interestingly, takes place in a desert, where half the battle is obscured by flying sand, instead of outer space.  We finally get to see what (probably) set Annikin on the road to the Dark Side, and what was probably the origin of the stormtroopers.  This movie answers a lot of the questions posed by the second trilogy, but ends with a cliffhanger, preparing the way for Episode III, where, presumably, we see Annikin's final descent towards the Dark Side and the birth of Luke and Leia.
To really enjoy this movie, you have to see it on its own terms.  Don't try to compare it with the second trilogy.",1027728000,15,1350,4.437246963562753
1321319,1,B00003CXKT,"okay, this movie stunk like a dead skunk. the story wouldn't have been that bad if all the scenes with anakin and padme had been cut out. for one thing, they were both there for their sex appeal and good looks. portman is supposedly a senator who wants no romantic complications with anyone, yet she flaunts herself shamelessly in overdone costumes that could be called gaudy. not to mention get her skin tight white jumper ripped off by some monster. that was completely on accident i guess. haydon whatever his name is can't act to save his life, and the script did not help that. and what was up with the so called ""romantic dialogue""? ""Gee padme, i don't like sand. sand is real annoying. you're not like sand........"" yeah, that was really great. mcgreggor was doing a better job in his subplot, but he was all alone so there was no interesting or humorous dialogue. and meanwhile the two jedi masters-who are apparently big losers-sit around trying to look like they are in the movie for a actual purpose. they fail, needless to say. lets see what else, it was really boring. not as boring as episode one, but almost. at least this one was bad in a sort of funny way. oh yeah, it had the most boring villain in the whole world. yoda fighting him looked really stupid. no one had any sense of humor. i want to call it attack of the clowns, but no one was funny enough to be called a clown. more like attack of the really boring overdone special effects and bad acting. yeah, that'll do it.",1027641600,5,1494,4.4363636363636365

But unfortunately, the characters weren't that interesting.  In the original trilogy, the characters were fresh and involving, while now they're just actors in a Star Wars film.  Not that that effects the movie badly, but would've made the movie better if the characters were more interesting (and maybe even developed).  Better than Episode I, this should leave Star Wars fans dying to see Episode III.",1027555200,,570,5.096774193548387
1321321,3,B00003CXKT,"Yes, I am a big fan. I have read most of the novelizations, know every scene of the original trilogy like I know my own life. Which, of course, involves a large amount of Star Wars. But, don't you worry.  While I am big fan, I will present to you a well-balanced, insightful, and un-biased review of ""Star Wars -Episode II, Attack of the Clones"". I hope this review helps gives you guidence with your own thoughts and opinions on this movie and Star Wars as a whole.
Three years ago, many of us went to go see Episode I, the Phantom Menace. Many of us were horrified by what we saw. Lucasfilm, Fox, and it's corporate tie-ins created a months-long hype event that gave it larger-than-life expectations.
We all remember the top stories on the local and the national news. We had millions of cans of Pepsi with characters names and faces from a movie we were still a month from seeing yet, fast food restaurants giving away Star Wars cards and trinkets when we ""super-sized"" our meals. Thousands of people were abandoning their lives to wait in line weeks on end in Darth Vader costumes. It was pure pandamonium, remember? We had to see this movie, we must see this movie, and so on and so on. Well, the big day arrives, and barring a direct act of God, this was going to be the number one movie of all time. This did not happen. It cracked the Top 3, and made over 400 million in the US alone, but it lacked the creative, one-in-a-million feel that the original movies did. Star Wars became  a victim of it's own hype, it's own success. This movie has been reviewed hundreds of times on amazon, but I wanted to give a little backround before we move on. I will only discuss minor scenes, I will  not give away big spoilers/scene to scene descriptions  since many of you may still want to see it.
Now, 2002, 25 years after A New Hope was released into theatres, we are given the second installment in George Lucas' prequel trilogy, the fifth(or should I say second?) in the series. Where The Phantom Menace suffered from lack of direction, Attack of the Clones suffers from trite and forced plot movements. To tell you the truth, I really set my expectations low for this one, I really did. I thought Phantom menace was terrible, and a disgrace for true fans of film. I made a strong effort not to read spoilers and info. about this new film for the last three years, so I could in there and be surprised. I was surprised, but not in a totally good way.
The special effects were of course excellent. To see a whole city with every detail created with computers is astounding. Many of the creatures, such as in Episode I, were generated by computers. Here lies a big part of the problem. While it looks good from a technical standpoint, it does not look ""real"" to the moviegoer. Honestly, I felt like I was watching one of Pixar's latest computer-animated films, ""A Bugs Life - Episode II, Attack of the Special Effects"".  We have what can only be described as flying bug things, making weirdo clicking sounds.
Special effects are meant to enhance a movie, add to it, not be the whole darned thing with one or two human actors tossed in now and then. How can we relate to a movie that is supposed to be live-action but instead comes across as a cartoon? Heck, the FX in Star Wars 25 years ago was used better than this. And that was stop-motion and wires with models on them. I am a human being, how can I relate to these creatures? The reason this works in cartoons is because they are metaphors for human beings. Toy Story, Disney movies, Bugs Bunny cartoons for crying out loud, can be related to better than most of the aliens in Episode II. The eye candy was too much, overdone.
Now for the bad news. We can all agree that the orginal trilogy did not have any award-winning performances(other than Alec Guiness, of course), but we connected with them on screen, we felt for Han, Luke, and Leia. Chewie, C3PO and R2D2 were given humanized traits for us to emphasize with. In Attack of the Clones, whether it's due to the actor's inability to connect with the surroundings of a blue screen, or their inability to even act, I could care less about them. They seem wooden, with no emotions for me to connect to. Why must we sit through a picnic scene with Anakin and Padme? A picnic, with them literally rolling around in the hay? There is certainly more action in this movie, but it mainly in the beginning and the last 30 minutes. It moves as a faster pace than Phantom Menace, but still drags on, especially in the middle.
What was good, however, were the action sequences. With a big battle scene with hordes of Jedi, a fight scene involving Yoda(one of the bright spots here), and a chase through the towers of a planet-sized city. Too bad George Lucas cannot recognize anymore that action and FX don't make a movie alone. He has crafted a film that is broken in many places, and seems to worry more about his 6-piece series as a whole than focus on the individual episodes and interlocking them together.
You may like this more than the Phantom Menace, but Attack of the Clones holds no candle to  A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, or Return of the Jedi. It is not a terrible movie, and may be worth seeing once if you are a big fan, but I cannot recommend it for all the casual fans and moviegoers.

1321363,4,B00003CXKT,"Three years ago I hosted a premiere of STAR WARS Episode I THE PHANTOM MENACE in my hometown.  I stood in line ten hours for tickets as I gave away free gift certificates, drinks, and food.  I then returned a week later to host the Star Wars Showtime Countdown from 10am till midnight.  It rained both days (although the meteorologist I worked with said it wouldn't), but it all seemed worth it to finally see a new STAR WARS movie after 17 years.  Then - Jar Jar Binks popped up!  For two hours I continued to wonder when the movie would actually pick up the pace and it never did.  I, like many fans, was disappointed and feared what the next two installments would bring.  One thing I never did, however, was generate the hatred toward George Lucas that I have witnessed these past three years.  In April 1999, he was considered a genius.  In May, everyone ganged up on him because they didn't like one movie!  Not every idea works and not every project goes to plan.  He made the movie the way he wanted and I only wish I had a career where no one could tell me how to do my job.  Afterall, he made the first three his way and if someone had butted in, there probably wouldn't have been more than one made in the first place.  But, nevertheless, I wasn't too sure about ATTACK OF THE CLONES.  Three years later, I am happy to say that STAR WARS is back on track.  Although there is still something missing from the days of Han and Luke, George Lucas and company have regained the feel of the original trilogy and put excitement, action, humor, and suspense back into the saga.  The love story, although drawn-out, is broken up over a series of fun chases and explosive action that help keep the pace.  And, fortunately, Obi-Wan Kenobi helps bring back much of the cocky attitude that has been missing since the departure of Han Solo.  If you jumped ship after EPISODE I, I suggest you get back on board for EPISODE II.",1027468800,12,1922,4.366197183098592
1321364,5,B00003CXKT,"Okay, I know that the hard-core Star Wars fans probably don't see the reason for this second trilogy's release, but hey, everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion.  This movie basically takes all the best aspects of Empire and Jedi, and crams it all in to one 2 and a half hr. segment.  From the lightsaber battle with the entire Jedi council versus the droid army to the arrival of the ""clone troopers,"" who will one day be called ""storm troopers,"" and the climax of the film, the duel between Dacula and Yoda, there has yet to be battle scenes of this magnitude and quality every.  The ending is a very wonderful way to end the movie, and will leave you wanting more, and not wanting to wait until May 2005 to see Episode III.  Anyway, i think that while Empire was the best Star Wars film to this point, Clones isn't that far behind.  Lucas has his work cutout for himself if he wants to outdo Episode II with Episode III.

1321366,5,B00003CXKT,"'Attack of the Clones' is not only the best movie of the summer, but the best movie of the Star Wars saga. The reasons are plain & simple: Plot progression & character development. 'The Phantom Menace' set the stage for the next five films & that means 'Clones' had to push the protagonists further along, which it did quite nicely. Since we regretably know how it all ends, it's good to see that build up & consistancy. Anakin retains his 'special gift' & quick temper & it's VERY easy to see where he's going. His conflicting emotions & very dark sense of humor reflects Vader in every scene (look at the way he's standing while watching the sunrise on Naboo). Amidala is a typical over-worked woman attracted to the bad boy, though she knows it's a mistake. She's beautiful, but she'll soon be sad, just how Leia remembers her in 'Return of the Jedi'.
 The action sequences are better than anything we've seen & the humor is a nice touch. If anyone has their doubts about 'Clones', I think they should open up the original Star Wars novel & read the prologue. It's all there. Emotional, action-packed, & visually stunning, 'Clones' is the best.",1027296000,3,1147,4.622549019607843

1321409,4,B00003CXKT,"Though not perfect, ""Star Wars:Episode II-Attack Of The Clones"" is a MAJOR improvement over the uninspired""Episode I-The Phantom Menace"". The first film to be shot entirely with digital cameras,""Clones"" is gorgeous to look at, particularly scenes of a battle between Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi(a bearded Ewan MacGregor)and bounty hunter Jango Fett on the rainy planet of Kamino.""Clones"" succeeds where ""Phantom Menace"" didn't by darkening the tone of the characters, notably the slow descent into evil by Anakin Skywalker, the Jedi who we all know will become Darth Vader in Episode III. Hayden Christensen(also seen as Kevin Kline's junkie son in the small film""Life As A House"")effectively shows how Anakin's guilt and personal loss will ultimately transform him into Vader. Where Christensen doesn't click are in the scenes with Natalie Portman, returning as Padme Amidala. She's gorgeous, but neither she nor Christensen make their love story feel all too convincing, especially since they haven't seen each other in ten years, yet fall in love almost immediately. Their relationship is secondary to the main plot of ""Clones"", in which Obi -Wan Kenobi discovers that a former Jedi turned separatist(Christopher Lee, who's great in a small role) secretly ordered the construction of a clone army ten years earlier. This army is cloned from the likeness of Jango Fett, and at least in this film, come to the aid of the Jedi in a spectacular final 45 minute climax, better than any battle sequence in the entire series. The much talked about lightsaber duel pitting Yoda(who's all CGI now and looks terrific) versus Lee's Count Dooku delivers the goods,although I wish it had lasted longer. Essentially, ""Attack Of The Clones"" ranks  third best in the ""Star Wars"" saga, but it rivals ""The Empire Strikes Back"" in it's dark mood, and you won't get better special effects in a movie ths year.

1321410,3,B00003CXKT,"STAR WARS EPISODE TWO: ATTACK OF THE CLONES didn't exactly spark the kindling of my imagination into roaring conflagration.  I still believe in the Force, of course, I am still a disciple of the Lucasian mythos, but I must generate criticism which is consistent with what I saw, not only to exercise my right to do so, but to fulfill my obligation as a moviegoer.
If one were to make an attempt at isolation of the main infectious agent responsible for the underachieving nature of the film, it is possible that one would see on the microscope slide a nasty bug of self-conscious hubris; for it seems impossible to dismiss a sense of a solipsistic attitude throughout the presentation, a sort of this-is-Star-Wars-so-people-will-like-it viewpoint.  After all, Star Wars retains an incredibly large amount of inherent brand equity to its credit.  It is therefore seeable that Mr. Lucas might have taken a nonchalant approach to the generation of the flow-sheet for not only the plot of the film, but its essential foundation in terms of ambience and characters.  But the faults within CLONES are not only due to its resting-on-laurels manner; as stated, we have the related sin of excessive pride, which made itself known mostly through the performances of the actors.  Most of it was a bludgeoning, ponderous, trying-too-hard recitation of the lines, the people involved were too aware that they were in a Star Wars movie, and thus overshot this inflection and exaggerated that enunciation, trying to sound regally dramatic when a looser tone would have been more suiting (the same thing happened with Ford and Hamil's portrayals of their respective characters in RETURN OF THE JEDI as opposed to A NEW HOPE).
There were some nicely done sequences, but I got a feeling of dj during a few instances, in particular the speeder-chase scene near the beginning- I felt this was too close to the podrace event in MENACE.  There is nothing wrong with a repetition of specific devices under different guises; but if you use the same formula, be sure to alter the variables enough to make it interesting.  And there were certain conceptual things in the film which did not rest comfortably with me.  Let me give one example which will not ruin the experience for anyone who has yet to catch the subject under discussion: Boba Fett.  Just about everyone knows that the origins of the most infamous bounty hunter is unraveled, we see the anti-hero himself as the dutiful son of Jango Fett, a loving boy who respects his dad dearly and wants to be just like him.  Only problem is, do I really want to see the ruffian loner as some sweet, innocent child?  Do I really want to delve into his familial background?  Doesn't this spoil the whole persona for the hardened fan of the jetpack-wearing, Mandolorian-armored amoral predator of Han Solo?  I have to answer yes on all counts.  It's like Darth Vader vs. Young Annikin Skywalker; many people have talked about the dubious worth of focusing on Vader as a youngster, preferring a quicker ascension- or descent, as the case may be- to the helmeted bad guy (one friend of mine pointed out that Episode II could have been Episode I, granting us the Sith Lord on a much faster time horizon; I tend to concur).
There were a couple of truly awful parts that I must make mention of.  One of the lowest points for me was the foray into Dexter Jetster's bar.  Now, for those who have seen what I am talking about: did you ever believe you'd see a Johnny Rocketts in a Star Wars film?  I know, I know, you're saying to yourself there is precedence for such indulgence, many of our current bits of culture have made it into the series already, but somehow, that set went a bit too far (I had a similar negative reaction to the ESPN-like two-headed podrace announcer in MENACE).  And I found the scene where a certain diminutive Jedi Knight's charges help Kenobi find his lost planet extraneously goofy at best.
Now, as a balance to some of my criticisms, I can direct you to the arena scene near the end, which was handled very well.  Also, the flight through the asteroid field and the journey through the mines of Geonosis were rendered with passable skill; and the explosive theater of operations at the climax was wonderful sugar for the visual receptors.  Perhaps the biggest emotional response during the viewing came when Count Dooku- played with exceptional flair by Christopher Lee- took on the digitally-updated, future-denizen-of-Dagobah Yoda himself, a spastic, kinetic fight which was as emotionally invigorating as it was completely surprising.
Unfortunately, overall, the story of CLONES failed to resonate with me.  I'm not necessarily sure why this is; all the political machinations were present, there were the requisite number of  twists and turns and forks in the road, but somehow, it didn't reach the speed where velocity of escape is possible, blowing my mind past the atmosphere of the ordinary and into the space of wonder.  I know that further inspection of the film will allow me to find more value to it (this occurred with MENACE, to a degree).  I still rate Lucas's second episode three stars, for even though I may have been disappointed, the franchise nevertheless carries on in my mind as a memorable and worthy diversion (I think the fact that it is struggling to reach the $300 million mark might offer proof of the market's agreement with such a statement).

1321411,5,B00003CXKT,"I can't tell you how sick I am of the occasional negative review that is smug and presumptuous.  Reviews that say things such as, ""you won't enjoy this"" or ""you'll be bored to tears"" are inappropriate.  Tell us your opinion, but DON'T presume to know everyone else's reaction to the film.  Especially since most people have LOVED this movie, that should be a hint that many won't agree with you.
Star Wars II shows Star Wars the way Lucas originally intended: with a scope so vast that we'd be overwhelmed and blown away.  Consider the following segment of an older review:
<START>
Even for casual moviegoers who are looking to ""just be entertained,"" the newest Star Wars film even fails to deliver on that task. Unlike the original three films, which put a simple story of good versus evil in a world formerly unseen by moviegoers, everyone involved with Attack of the Clones seems to have lost any sense that less is more. Why have two Jedis fighting when you can have 100? Why have one Jango Fett when you can have an army of them? Why have a simple good guy/bad guy story when you can create a plot much more needlessly complicated?
<END>
I'll answer all of these questions.  First of all, the original films were *never* simple stories about good versus evil.  While some fans may have appreciated them on that level, ""Empire"" in 1980 made it clear that Star Wars is about the close relationship between good and evil and the path that links them.  ""Menace"" and ""Clones"" reveal even more of that theme, and thank God they do.  The complex political backstory and Anakin's temptation *enhance* for me the appreciation of the original films.  I was never one of those fans that loved Luke just because he was cool.  Rather, I am drawn to the deeper mythological implications surrounding the true hero of Star Wars: Anakin Skywalker.  Because of the prequels, I am a bigger fan now than I ever was at six years old when ""Jedi"" came out.
Why have 100 Jedi fighting?  Because that's the story!!  That's how it happened!  Frankly, ever since the original trilogy I LONGED to see the Jedi in their heydey, fighting in throngs that would make evil-doers quake in their boots.  Finally, Lucas is showing it and I'm glad he is.  ""Attack of the Clones"" is what I'd always dreamed Star Wars could be.
I have a feeling that those complaining are the kind of fans that just liked having a simple Sci-Fi/Action story.  Well, I'm sorry Lucas has messed with your memories, but as I've already pointed out, SW never WAS a simple story.  It was always complex, but you weren't seeing it for what it was.  When you speak so highly of the OT in comparison to the prequels, you're just in love with a watered-down version of those movies in your head.",1026777600,3,2735,4.579055441478439
1321412,1,B00003CXKT,"The name ""Star Wars"" used to mean something.  Now it's a joke.  A sad joke.  The first trilogy is a classic.  Er... was.  Until the new trilogy came along and muddied it's own namesake.  ""The Phantom Menace"" was decent, and could have passed as the one not-so-classic fluke in the ""Star Wars"" saga...
But then came ""Attack of the Clones"".  Horrible.  Uninspired.  Cheesy beyond belief.  They CGIed the entire life out of anything in the movie.  It's like watching cartoons, except it's trying hard to be taken seriously, whereas cartoons are just brainless fun.  The acting is by far the worst of any ""Star Wars"" film yet (although we are still waiting on Episode III... hold your breath).  The dialogue is so poor that I want to donate to it's charity.  The story takes a backseat to the chase and fight sequences, and thus makes for a simply run-of-the-mill studio film.  A long long time ago (in a galaxy far away) ""Star Wars"" was anything but run-of-the-mill.
There is so much obvious blue-screen in practically every shot that you feel like you're watching an empty wherehouse, with performances so cardboard that you're sure the first reading of the script is what they filmed for the final product.  Half the time you can tell the actors weren't even in the same room together, it's so half-heartedly pasted together.  Production scheduling gone awry.  A good editor can only do so much, George.
What else... oh yes, though there was one improvement over ""The Phantom Menace"" (the addition of humour), ""Attack of the Clones"" simply tries too hard to make you enjoy it.  It's like pouring sugar on fat-free ice cream.  Not gonna do it for us, buddy.  ""Clones"" overcompensates for complaints received over ""Menace""'s being dull by giving us laughable action scenes (Yoda flying through the air?  Bloodless decapitation??  Big huge angry evil arena monsters that have nothing to do with anything???) as well as repetative chases moments like Anakin's flying antics on Coruscant.  It gets more dull by the minute.
The romance between Anakin and Amidala feels so forced that you almost root for their demise.  Forced also, is the angst that little Ani seems to develop for no apparent reason other than he misses his mom.  (C'mon, what did Obi Wan ever really do to deserve reprimand?)  Use the force indeed, Mr. Lucas.

The story pulls you in and makes you more eager for the next installment when you hope your questions will be answered.  Another winning aspect is the return of the bad guys to fight another day.  Don't we all love a good villain?
My favorite moments in the movie were Yoda's battle, Skywalker's rage against the sand people, Samuel Jackson's arrival and the chase for the would-be assasin through the passage ways of Coruscant.  There was a lot to like about this movie.  Sure the acting was a bit corny as was the love story, but remember this a Sci-Fi movie.  Follow the entire story and forget about how well the acting is.

You can almost rate it as 2 things, one as an individual piece, which proves somewhat hard to do and then as a piece of the bigger Star Wars epic and how it compares to the other films and their individual places in the series.
Yeah, I'm sure by now you've heard the 'wooden' acting complaints, which is kind of weird as when you compare the acting here to the other movies, it's well above Episode I (lucas learned something) and just about at the levels of the original trilogy.
The galaxy is in disarray. Systems are pulling out of the Senate and the threat of war hangs over all. Senator Padme Amidala, former queen of Naboo, is hurrying back to vote on the army creation act, which she strongly opposes. She's under a seemingly constant death threat and is assigned Jedi protectors Obi-Wan Kenobi and his padawan Anakin Skywalker to keep her safe. Needless to say, adventure spreads like wild fire and Obi-Wan is off to play Sherlock Holmes while Anakin is left to assist Padme into seclusion to keep her safe. Needless to say, romance ensues when the public servants are left to themselves and Obi-Wan finds more than he bargained for. The romance is workable at worst and Obi-Wan's run-ins with the bounty hunter Fetts are things that fanboy dreams are made of. The final half hour or so really demonstrates the vast world that digital film and effects has and will offer us in the future.
Maybe Lucas uses too much CGI, but it's his film and luckily the picture is visually breathtaking. I only wish I could see it digitally projected to get the full experience. And, to  his and his ILM team's credit, the digital characters and surroundings do become one with the real things when you don't keep telling yourself to try to find the CG additions. I think Lucas also realizes that someone had to make a film like this and almost formally kick off the digital film age.

The entire plot will be revealed in Episode III and those that claimed there was no story will be smacking their foreheads and forced to go back and watch Episode I and II. God forbid you take a hint when Episode I is titled ""The PHANTOM Menace.""
This film is executed almost without flaw. The actions sequences are the best in a film, the comedy is great, and the story is very climactic with many twists along the way. Hayden Christensen is what really makes this film a STAR WARS movie, with his quirky acting style that truly makes him a Star Wars character, something we haven't seen sine Mark Hamill.

I am a ""new"" Star Wars fan so I did not watch the old trilogy until after I watched the two new episodes (I cringed through the outdated robots and spaceships ;)). Frankly, I didn't think the old trilogy was that much better than the new one. I was especially disappointed by ""The return of the Jedi"". Darth Vader was NOT the evil villain that I had come to hate/love. He was so wishy washy, and the way he killed Palpatine was just plain ridiculous (so if I ever confront Palpatine, all I have to do is wait for him to torture another and then I just pick him up and throw him overboard despite the fact that one of my hand is cut off, eh?). There were many parts of the old trilogy I found boring and I actually prefer episode one over it. I guess it's because I didn't watch it when it first came out and didn't grow up with it?

That said, a quick run down of the plot:
As the movie opens Senator (no longer queen) Padme Amidala returns to Coruscant for an important vote in the Senate over whether or not to create an Army of the Republic to assist the increasingly overburdened Jedi Knights in their defense of the galaxy. Amidala is opposed to the move, since she feels that a standing army would invite war rather than prevent it. For her trouble, Padme receives an assasination attempt from an unknown source. Palpatine, in his usual snake-oil style, claims patriotism, and demands, against Padme's wishes, that she be protected, and that the assasin be found. The Jedi council confers, and dispatches Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker as her protectors. Anakin realizes he is in love with Padme, and tells Obi-Wan so, which is why it is so mystifying that he makes the decision to leave the two of them alone together on Naboo while he fulfills his further assignment of discovering the source of a Clone army, ready and waiting for the republic, supposedly ordered ten years previously by a Jedi Council member thought long dead. (But honestly, who didn't see *something* like this coming from the moment they kissed in Episode I?)
Enough of that, I don't want to spoil everything.
Favorite spots:
Padme--Now it makes sense why Luke can defeat Vader in Return of the Jedi (trust me, the arena scene explains a lot--Sister's doin' it for herself! Yeah!)
Yoda--again, don't look at the spoilers of other reviewers down the page...just...trust me.
Lucas has done it again, with perhaps the greatest episode yet! I know for my part I enjoyed this one better than the original trilogy. Buy it!",1026432000,8,1963,4.827893175074184
1321464,5,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars - Attack of the Clones! was SPECTACULAR! It has everything! - monsters more terrifying than the Rancor, nicely designed vehicles, magnificent action scenes, awesome characters (way to go Jango Fett!), and countless other things!
My favorite scenes are: Obi-Wan jumping out of the window & he and Anakin pursuing Zam Wessel! I also love the sound Wessel's speeder makes when it's flying. The actress who plays her is also very hot!
Many people hate Jar Jar Binks but hey, every sci-fi movie needs humour or else it would be... boring. Bink's role in Star Wars is a necessity since he's a very cheerful and funny Gungan!
I think the movie deserved 4 Stars, not 3! For those who haven't seen the movie --- GO WATCH IT! Why? 'Cause it's an experience of a lifetime! And for those who disliked the love scenes, well I can understand why. Don't worry, you guys and gals will know true deep love someday...
Overall, George Lucas did an admirable and fantastic job in this 2nd episode of the 1st trilogy! Go see it and during the action scenes --- TRY NOT TO BLINK!... Especially when the all the Jedis arrive!...",1026345600,7,1115,4.636363636363637

The fighting and action scenes at the end of the movie we just fantastic... Watching the Jedi fighting like that was just what we all dreamed of... Anakin's slide to the dark side is great. Padme looking great as usual and you have to love the white outfit!
Ewan seems to be getting better at portraying Obi-Wan. He was a little too wooden in the first move, but seems to be pulling it back together now.
The lightsabre duels with Dooku really show the difference between a Master and a standard Jedi. That is why these guys ruled. And as for Yoda, you just have to enjoy watching him fight.
I am still waiting for Mace to pull out his BMF wallet!",1026345600,2,821,4.303225806451613
1321544,4,B00003CXKT,"1. THE FILM
The best review of Attack of the Clones (no surprise) was Roger Ebert's. Ebert takes strong issue with this film's ""cloned"" dialogue and wooden acting - considering it otherwise excellent. Ebert (no surprise) is right. But Lucas' casting talents aside, his films' intended audience is children. Nevertheless, his films successfully convey not just visual pyrotechnics but truths - the Anakin-Amidala relationship being one instance of many: It is pure Petrarch and Sir Philip Sidney. Compare Christensen's ""wooden"" declarations of love with these:

A rain of bitter tears falls from my face
And a tormenting wind blows with my sighs
Whenever toward you I turn my eyes,
Whose absence cuts me from the human race.
(Petrarch, Sonnet XVII)

But I in me am chang'd, I am alive and dead :
My feete are turn'd to rootes, my hart becometh lead,
No witchcraft is so evil, as which mans mind destroyeth.
(Sidney, Astrophil and Stella, Fifth Song, 76-78)

2. THE MYTH
The Lucas films are myths made for children. Lucas always reiterates this. The myth conveyed is Good triumphs. Perhaps through storms, perhaps though disasters, but inevitably what is Good, to the degree it is good, is undefeatable, for it is what makes us what we are. Dubious animated Jar Jar Binks is the mythic fool who saves the hero. The Jedi are wonderful role models of strength, wisdom, and moral force. Children appreciate and intuitively understand the significance of such characters. Would we had more of them - something the Next Generation Star Trek movie producers might have done well to address. Lucas' flourish of children training to become Jedi is another wholesome attribute of this film.

3. ART MIRRORS LIFE
In his April 29, 2002 Times magazine interview, George Lucas spoke of how ""all democracies eventually become dictatorships"" because (roughly quoting) ""the people allow it to happen"". Given America's descent into an ethos of Precrime and militarism, this children's film is deft in its handling of the real nature of such serious issues. Palpatine's ""I love democracy"" speech, assurances of laying down emergency powers once the current crisis is passed: Trenchant. The young Anakin's ""attachment"" to others leading to his downfall: A major life lesson straight from Christianity and Buddhism. Again, who else is delivering children's entertainment conveying such strong timeless lessons? His potential casting demerits and overreliance on technical gadgetry aside, Lucas' strengths more than compensate. Ebert is right: Excellent film.",1026259200,7,2536,5.254320987654321
1321545,4,B00003CXKT,"I really liked the movie in general but some of dialogue was unnatural or too formal. So as my title says, I try to accept it, even though I believe it needs improvement.  A possible reason for Anakin and Padme having too much formal dialogue (as I would put it) is that they both grew up very fast.
We see Anakin in Ep. 1 beyond his years as a boy and taken away from his mom to start his Jedi training because he's the *Chosen One*.  Big load on anyone's shoulders.  Padme was queen and now senator.  Can you say, no personal life?  I say this because I like giving people the benefit of the doubt and I understand that movies should be watched with an open mind instead of often exagerated expectations.
Someone else critized Natalie Portman's acting when she didn't react strongly to Anakin's slaughter of the sandpeople because it was horrible and over-exaggerated justice, which took him one big step towards the dark side. It would be believeable to say that Padme would think, in light of his mom's death and Anakin's anguish, they all deserved to die because they're a menace and a threat to peaceful people. On top of that, it wouldn't be appropriate to start scolding Anakin at that moment for killing all of them. She is a skilled negotiator and knows when to hold her tongue and when to speak.
I get frustrated when people become harsh critics of decent movies because most of the time they fail to understand characters' motives, the movement of the plot, etc..  In this case, Ep. 2, we have dialogue that was stiff at times and given to young actors who did the best they could with it.  I'm sure Sir Alec Guiness would've done a better job with the same lines but he's got decades of life and job experience over Hayden. Cut the kid some slack and try to enjoy the movies people. Just assume that Anakin spends too much time with fixing machines to know how be smooth with the ladies. HAHA!
Lastly, yeah Jar Jar was annoying but that doesn't mean he shouldn't exist! The Star Wars movies aren't a perfect universe where no annoying people ever exist.  People should realize that you need to watch a movie not as a person in a theatre but as if you were a bystander in the story. Immersing yourself in the movie and not being critical allows you to enjoy the movie a lot more. Accept Jar Jar for what he is, an annoying character, but don't go wishing how the movie *should've* been. If everyone would do that you'd have a million different Star Wars movies.  Accept them for what George wanted to portray and stop whining.  :)",1026086400,9,2542,4.459051724137931
1321546,4,B00003CXKT,"After reading so much of the reviews on this and thinking back to the experiences I had when I watched the original trilogy in the theaters and Episode I, I have to really say this is the worst Star Wars to date.  I think Hayden Christensen was wrongly cast, his acting did not make me believe enough and feel enough for him, there are so many fine actors out there that could have been chosen that could have done so much better a job, I just don't know what's up with Lucas anymore, perhaps he should let others handle some of the work or move it to younger people.
Comparing this movie, I guess you can't compare it to the original ones where it was such a rollercoaster ride, because you have characters from all different backgrounds thrown together in a mix of course they won't always agree with each other and that's what made it fun and develop over time into more seriousness, but when Luke became a Jedi, he was always serious, which is the tone of these new movies.  I think these new movies are right in the tone, because the Jedi order is a very serious group of people and they hardly joke the way the first movies did, but there could have been way better acting to make it more real.
Finally, one really big point I'd like to make is that the music did not flow with the movie, this is one big part that I have to say was bad, a bad movie can be catapulted to a better position if the movie had good music that moves it, but it seems like the composer was not interested in this movie, wasn't emotionally charged like the first 3 movies.  There were some really dead spots in the movie that just didn't have any music or sound at all, I think it made it dull.  If you remember the first 3 movies, the music flowed so well and felt so good.  It wasn't even evident in these new movies.
Well, with all this bad stuff to say about this movie, you're wondering why I even gave it 4 stars right?  Since I am a Star Wars fan, growing up with it, I still have to give it justice and instead of the three stars I would have given it, I give it one more as a fan.  I know you'll hate me for that one, but what can I say.",1026000000,,2128,4.100961538461538

1321548,2,B00003CXKT,"Special Effects should be used to support an already good story/screenplay and Lucas doesn't have that to begin with. He is a horrible scriptwriter because he has no realistic sense of dialogue. In addition to this, he is not a great director. The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi were both far superior to the original and were not directed by Lucas. Because of his inability to direct, the romantic tension between Christiansen and Portman is essentially non-existent and the overall emotion in the film is about on par with the Star Wars Holiday Special. Good special effects don't make a good movie. Lucas tries to do too much himself and in the end the success of the movie is carried by the success of its predecessors and its good, but overused, special effects.",1026000000,11,779,4.735294117647059

If you thought Episode 1 was bad then get ready for [disappointment] 2! Hayden Christiansen was a bad mistake for the role of Anakin. Although he's a good actor, he just plane out STINKS in this movie. The same goes for every other actor too. It's not their fault they don't know what they're doing.

I don't believe a critic should even be allowed to critique a Star Wars movie until he's seen it at least twice. There is just to much happening to honestly catch it in one viewing. If critics took the time to learn the whole back story to the Star Wars universe it would aid them in there incompetent venture. The previous reviewer didn't like the performance by Hayden Christensen and then goes on to state that he thought HAyden would have done a better job if he had played the part. Exactly what I am talking about incompetence. If you don't even know the actors name how can you critique him. Hayden did a wonderful job with this movie showing just enought dark forshadowing.

Yoda fighting with a lightsaber, padme, a giant jedi war, great visual effects, great characters, and much more. The acting in the movie is great, especially Ewan Mcgregor as Obi-wan, and Natalie Portman as padme. I'd say that the highlights of the movie are the arena battle between the Jedi and droids, and then when Yoda comes to save obi-wan and anakin and fights Dooku. The only thing that would slow the movie down, if anything, would be the love story.

But please, you have to get someone who knows how to act.  Episode 2 plays a very important pivotal role for Anakin Skywalker turning to Darth Vader.  The audience has to be able to see that brewing change but still not strip them of their sympathy for the Dark Lord.  It centered on Anakin/Padme's love story instead.  Such a waste of time & money.  I could have just skipped this & proceed with the Episode 3.  On second thoughts, I may just skip it altogether if it comes out like this film.  Mr. Lucas, I hope you are listening!!!",1025568000,,671,4.354838709677419
1321624,3,B00003CXKT,"Episode II is kinetic and visually creative...but it's a chore to sit through sometimes. Believe me, I wanted to love this movie. I even tried to watch it like I did when I saw the original film at age 12. But I can't. The movie has no passion. And it was passion that moved my preadolescent heart in 1977.

The characters in this film are beyond unsympathetic. The words they speak are colossally awful and delivered flatly. George Lucas has a terrific cinematic imagination but he refuses to write good dialogue or properly direct actors.

But the romance is the clunkiest part. ""It causes me a great deal of pain to think of you"" is the type of line that Anakin (Christensen) employs to woo young Padme (Portman). And it's spoken like ""Being with you gives me gas."" Way to go, Ani.

The film's greatest offense is its treatment of Anakin's first walk on the Dark Side and its blithe avoidance of Padme's humanity. She simply gawks when Anakin announces he's committed a horrific act, then puts her arm around him as if to say ""There, there."" Minutes later, they're fighting bad guys again, making lame snappy banter and professing undying love. This incongruous sequence stops cold any empathy for their relationship. Wouldn't this bright, scrupulous, independent young woman have pulled (probably run) away and - at the very least! - questioned their romance for a few seconds? The story has to produce Luke and Leia, though, so it marches on inexplicably to the couple coupling in Ep. 3.

Saddest of all, C3PO and R2D2 become computer-generated slapstick cartoons that made no one laugh at the showing I attended. They're Laurel and Hardy, George, not Wyle E. Coyote and the Road Runner .

Giving due credit, this picture looks spectacular. And you've heard it (and probably seen it) right - Yoda rocks! The conversion from puppet to CGI has liberated the character and now he owns the joint. It's a little like ""Crouching Yoda, Hidden Jedi."" His scenes were the only time the audience really participated in the picture.

Bottom line - It wasn't a waste of time or money but it could have been SO much better.",1025568000,2,2115,4.733695652173913
1321625,3,B00003CXKT,"George Lucas will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the men who changed the face of entertainment. Star Wars was, in essence, the single factor which moved science fiction and fantasy from the back room, marginalized treatment they had been accustomed to and put them into the spotlight. There is no other single show or book I can recall in my lifetime which has had nearly so much influence.
 Unfortunately, that puts him on the spot when it comes to following up on his own material; it's expected that he at least tries to match his original's success.
 Monetarily, he's managed to pull it off. In terms of how good the movie is... no. The original Star Wars was a slam-bang fun action adventure film, a tribute to the old serials and a nod to other inspirations as diverse as Kurusowa's Hidden Fortress and Doc Smith's Lensman series. (the Campbellian babble that followed wasn't part of the original design -- Lucas just wisely took that thread and ran with it). The FUN derived not just from the action, but from the basic themes of good versus evil, and good triumphant over evil. The Empire Strikes Back had to  back off, of necessity, from the latter, but Return of the Jedi gave it back in spades.
 Then came The Phantom Menace. Lucas' first mistake was doing a prequel. True, there were books that dealt with the later years, but he'd always stated they weren't canon and wasn't restricted to them. And if he liked them, he could have just filmed Tim Zahn's trilogy. Instead, he gives us a prequel that focuses on Anakin Skywalker -- the Boy Who Would Be Vader -- and begins the fall of the Republic. Other egregious mistakes -- the words ""midichlorian"" and ""Jar Jar"" became curse-words for Star Wars fans -- made TPM a horrid experience.
 To its credit, Attack of the Clones avoids the worst mistakes of its immediate predecessor and offers us a few worthwhile moments (most viewers agree that watching Yoda jump around like a demented superball on crack is worth a large chunk of the admission fee). However, it can NEVER -- nor can its successor -- give audiences the real Good Triumphs Over Evil feeling, because WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S COMING. Anakin can't see that he's making a mistake, or at least won't acknowledge it. Obi-Wan can't save him. Palpatine won't get his butt whipped.

 Nor can it make up for this by providing us with better, more impressive substance. It's filled with logical holes, clumsy plot devices, and incredibly stupid characters who cause their own problems. The only REAL way to make sense of a lot of it is to assume the opposite of what we're being told -- that Yoda is one of the bad guys (or at least an exceedingly Machiavellian good guy), for instance, and that Anakin is using Jedi Mind Tricks on Amidala.
 So... it gets three stars. One for the Lucas that was, one for a few neat twists, and one for kickass action sequences. The two stars it could have gotten for actually being a good movie, or even a great movie, alas, are not to be. Nor, I fear, will they be available for the third movie. Lucas no longer has the people that helped him transform his ideas into brilliance (he did not really write the first three movies) and is reduced to pomposity, banality, and predictability.",1025395200,,3245,4.611785095320624

1321627,5,B00003CXKT,"I have studied Wagner operas for many years, I was fascinated about his mythological plots. Wagner's operas made me get interested in mythical and symbolic ways of expression in recent times (XIXth and XXth century is what I mean), for example, fantastic literature, or, in our times, sci-fi movies.
When thinking in symbolism many of us tend to think in sophisticated poetry, but the real symbolic stuff is to be understood by a majority of people. What is more, real mythical/symbolic art has always been the most spectacular form of art in any time. The impact on the public that the description of battles and heros had in Homer's Illiad, the chorus in greek tragedy, or the music in Wagner dramas, is achieved in Lucas films by digital means (and music also).
I've been a fan of Star Wars since I was a child. When I grew older I became conscious about it symbolic structure, very similar in some respects to that of 'Parsifal' by Wagner. There are many important correspondences between these two plots (Jedi knights/Grail knights, Darth Vader/Klingsor, Luke/Parsifal...), the main difference being that 'Parsifal' is more sexually oriented. Anyway, there is a strong political layer in both of them.
I enjoyed very much the first trilogy, but found a little childish, more like a tale than like a myth. It lacked the dialectical element, good and evil were clearly defined, there was no internal fight.
I have no space to justify mi opinions here, but I can say that in this film I've found a real dialectical, political and adult substrate, I've found a real tragic figure in the person of Anakin, and I've found the dark counterpart of the wagnerian 'Mittleid' (which is quoted in both Episode I and II, for my delight!) in the 'fear'.
Episode II projects its gloomy ligth to all the cicle, that gets now a completly different meaning (and seems even more onesided by comparison). Episode II is also more sensitive to every plot's nuance than its predecessors. In Episode IV a planet was banged and everyone seemed to forget the tragedy in one minute. Here, almost every detail is full of meaning and emotion; when Obi goes to ask Yoda about the missing planet, he does not just go to his 'office', he finds him teaching the children...; now that I have seen the relation that Obi had with Anakin as a teacher, I want to see a more subtle and nuanced duel between them in Episode IV (and more state-of-the-art clothes for Darth Vader, please).
Episode IV has shocked me in I way I couldn't expect. I'm still wondering about what was the reason of it, and I think that I see in the film some kind of premonition of the downfall of our own civilization, a downfall that has to do mainly with ethics. What I mean is: How does humankind behave when pressed by necessity (anothe wagnerian clich)? Doesn't it turn right to the dark side? What do we do when we feel menaced by those who live in starvation? What should it happen if petrol became extinct? (I'm not sure to have found the right words, please make an effort to understand my horrible English).
I'm anxious (and frightened) to watch Episode III.

1321628,5,B00003CXKT,"Yes, you read right. ""Attack of the Clones"" is my favorite Star Wars movie so far. ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" are just as good, but Episode II is the one I enjoy the most.
This movie had everything a die-hard fan of Star Wars could want: Action, suspense, great special effects, great story, and old trilogy forshadowing like what! And lastly, what REAL fan of Star Wars wouldn't want Yoda to fight?! That's the best part of this movie right there! I mean, what more is there to ask for?! This is Star Wars at its best!
For those who complained about the love story, the dialogue and acting didn't sound any different than what I've experienced with young love. When you're young and stupid-happy for someone, all logic fails, and you begin to say corny things, and not act like yourself. I totally saw this in Padme and Anakin. And a lot of the time in real life, young love happens fast like it did in this movie. People go off on Spring break and fall in love all the time. :) And as far as their illogical marriage, you knew this had to happen. But they didn't act illogical at first. They first decided not to fall in love. But after experiencing a life or death situation together, all logic fails. They were already in love. It's just that after that extreme situation they were put in, it lead them to act irrationally and they got married. As far as I'm concerned, there's not really anything bad about this love story. It's not unrealistic, and it's corny feel is exactly how most young couples are when they fall in love: stupid. :) It makes you cringe a little bit, but everything about young love looks stupid and silly from the perspective of the one outside of the relationship observing it. Come on! They're twiter-pated!
I thought the acting was typical Star Wars acting, and sometimes even better with some actors. Ewan McGregor did a tremendous job at portraying Obi-Wan. And he gave him a fun, witty personality. But at the same time, he came off as the wise man he really is. I really loved his character, and I can't wait until I see him in Episode III. He was a lot of fun, and totally Alec Guiness at a younger age.
Christopher Lee. What can I say? He was a great bad guy - the kind you love to hate. Darth Maul was just silent and scary looking and had cool moves. Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus wasn't scary looking, but rather a charming baddy who carries the role very naturally and convincingly. He has presence. He reminded me of someone who would come right out of the old trilogy. In fact, he reminded me of Peter Cushing's role as Grand Moff Tarkin in ""A New Hope."" And that's the idea. Christopher Lee was perfect in this role. I'm so happy Lucas got him to play the part. I just hope he doesn't die before they film his parts in Episode III!
Hayden Christensen did a good job overall as Anakin. I found him acting out some of his lines unrealistically at times - but I found a lot of this in the old trilogy of other actors too. Hayden shines when his character gets to Tatooine and his mom dies. He's real good at being angry and giving troubled looks. When he slaughtered those Tuskens, it was so apparent that he would become Vader. And also when he confessed of the incident to Padme. Gosh, I mean I could totally see that he was unstable and could explode at any second - something that resembles Vader in a big way. It was almost scary - especially with that eerie music playing in the background. And when he was carrying his mom's body, I got the same reaction. As far as his whining is concerned, I don't mind it because Luke was whiny too. In fact, now I know why Luke is so whiny in ""A New Hope""!
Natalie Portman did a good job as Padme. She's an attractive young actress who has such good presence on screen. And I liked how she was kind of witty like Leia. She delivered her lines well, and I was convinced that she would be the mother of Luke and Leia.
Ian McDiarmid is always great. I mean, I got angry when he just ACTED that he'd be concerned for Amidala's life. We all know he's Darth Sidious - the future Emperor. We all know that he and Dooku/Tyranus have this massive but yet silent politically manipulated plot to destroy the Jedi, the Republic, and to create an evil Empire for the Sith to rule. But yet, we see Palpatine act like he cares for the Republic and for the individuals who are a part of it. He's one clever bad guy. Just like in ""The Phantom Menace,"" Ian McDiarmid does it again. And this time, he's even better!
As far as the rest of the characters, they were convincing. I thought all of the actors who played Jedi Knights were well portrayed. Especially Yoda. I know he was CGI, but he was so realistic, and he was funny. The good old Yoda from ""The Empire Strikes Back"" has returned - with an attitude.
I think people downgraded this movie mostly because they grew up with the old trilogy and/or have seen it so many times that they're now too jaded by nostalgia to realize that the acting and dialogue is just as bad (or good) in the old trilogy as it is in the prequels. First off, we don't have the space pirate Han Solo type character in the prequels, so let's write him out. Obi-Wan is the closest to this character, but he can only be so cocky as a Jedi Knight. Jedi are usually stiff, wise and reserved individuals. But you've got a whiny young man with dark issues in the prequels(Anakin) and in the Old Trilogy(Luke). You've got an ambitious and witty young senator(Padme), and an ambitious and witty young princess in the Old Trilogy(Leia). You've got the bad guys with presence in the prequels(Dooku/Tyranus, and Palpatine/Sidious), and in the Old Trilogy(Darth Vader, and the Emperor/Sidious/Palpatine).
As far as the dialogue is concerned, has everyone forgotten these aspects of the Old Trilogy? :
Bickering between Han and Leia:
LEIA: Han, we need you!
HAN: We need?
LEIA: Yes.
HAN: Oh, what about you need?
LEIA: I need? I don't know what you're talking about.
(My goodness!)

HAN: Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.
LEIA: I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.
HAN: That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
LEIA: I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain. [LASER BRAIN?! UGGGH! :) ]
Chewie is amused; he laughs in his manner.
HAN: Laugh it up, fuzzball. But you didn't see us alone in the south passage.
HAN (Contd.): She expressed her true feelings for me.
LEIA: My...! Why, you stuck up, ...half-witted,...scruffy-looking...NERF-HERDER!
HAN: Who's scruffy-looking?
(gees, can it get any worse?)

The ever present repeating dialogue:
Vader: ""Obi-Wan has taught you well"" (same exact line said twice - once in The Empire Strikes Back, and once again in Return of the Jedi).
  ""It is your destiny"" ; ""If that is your destiny"" ; ""Then you will meet your destiny!""
  ""The circle is now complete"" ; ""His failure is complete"" ; ""Your skills are now complete!""
(even Emperor Palpatine gets in on it)
Emperor Palaptine: ""Your journey towards the darkside will be complete!""
  Or how about Chewbacca's tarzan yell? Or Luke whining about how he has to stay on the homestead for another year, or how he wanted to go to Toshi Station to pick up some power converters? In fact, Luke whines pretty much throughout ""A New Hope."" But somehow, all this bad dialogue seems completely natural and becomes nostaglic in our minds. Somehow, it all seems perfect. Why? I think I've already explained that.
In the end, ""Attack of the Clones"" is definitely a worthy addition to the saga. What real fan wouldn't like to see Anakin's dark side? What real fan wouldn't like to see the stormtrooper-like clone army marching off to finish the Clone Wars? What real fan wouldn't want to see Yoda fighting?! What real fan wouldn't want to see the first Death Star plans? What real fan wouldn't want to see Obi-Wan say stuff like, ""Why do I feel you're going to be the death of me?""(to Anakin), and telling Anakin that he's going to go get a drink at the bar? What real fan wouldn't want to see Boba Fett at a young age and his father? What real fan wouldn't want to see a brief and mysterious conversation between Palpatine and Anakin? What real fan wouldn't want to see the first walker-type vehicles that resemble the ones in the Hoth Battle?  What real fan wouldn't want a dark Star Wars movie? For fans anyway, I think the answer to all these questions is is NO ONE. This movie did everything it possibly could to be another great movie derived from the cheesy sci-fi serials of the 30s and 40s like Flash Gordon....",1024876800,29,8715,4.479546884833228

This movie delivers the most beautiful romance. Anakin Skywalker and Padm Amidala... *sighs* It warmed me from the inside. The scenery in almost every scene was gorgeous (especially the grassy field in Naboo with the waterfalls behind Ani and Padm. Just.. wow!)
Okay, okay... I know I may have sounded like a lovesick teenager (which I am, lol!) but really, 'Attack of the Clones' is the one of the best movies I have seen for a few years. The clone wars have begun. Decisions to make an army for the people must be decided. Ani's descent into the dark side has begun. Hayden Christensen portrays it excellently! AotC's plot is fantastic. And the CGI was really good! Didn't find it fake. Also, in my opinion, this movie is not bloated or storyless. At all. It's 'Star Wars' for crying out loud. Go see this movie!

I was very impressed by the performances in this movie.  Natalie Portman was wonderfully regal as Padme.  Hayden Christiansen, despite his critics, is a fine actor and performs well in this movie.  I loved the scene where Padme and Anakin are talking and he gives her a look that makes her ""feel uncomfortable.""  Christiansen has amazing eyes.  My favorite scene in the movie (and the novel, which was great) is the one in which Anakin tells Padme about the Tusken Raiders, where he cries, ""I hate them!"" with a lone tear running down his face.  He then sits down and cries in Padme's arms.  The scene where Shmi, Anakin's mother, dies makes me cry everytime.  Ewan McGregor does a fantastic job with the character of Obi-Wan.  Obi-Wan has grown a lot since Phantom Menace.  He is a true Jedi Master and a good teacher to Anakin.  You can see him changing from the arrogant teenager in Phantom Menace to the wise old man in A New Hope.  Yoda is awesome in this movie.  I still get chills when I see him fighting Dooku at the end of the movie.  And, as always, the special effects are truly spectacular.",1024790400,22,1177,4.490566037735849

Like many others, having grown up waiting for the next Star Wars movie to come out, I think that I really wanted these movies to be as cool and interesting as the first series. I still remember being taken to the movies as a kid and seeing Star Wars as a little boy. It was magic. We were ensorcelled. And we all had characters that we could relate to, dream about, and wanting to roleplay on the playground.
Episode One was such a let-down, such a kick in the teeth, that it was sad watching it. Depressing. Pathetic.
The fact that this second movie is only slightly better than the flatulent attempts of Episode One does not merit great reviews. It merits mediocre reviews, at best.
I do have to admit that the battle scenes were cool. The special affects are great. The choreography of the duels were fun. But with such lame characters, pointless and vapid dialogue, and forced performances, it is hard to get excited about too much.
I am certain that I will go and see the third and final obligation, er... I mean installment of this series and see how it turns out.
Too bad Darth Vader will be more ""understood"" by the audience, rather than just scary and evil like he was before he knew ""true love"".... Bleech.....",1024790400,3,1400,4.4941176470588236

Or it may be the writing.  It was pretty dull.  The music was excellent, I own the soundtrack and I loved it.  Hayden did pretty well as Anakin but he doesn't do well with sad emotions.

The costumes were wonderful and the plot was very imaginative. This is a classic battle of good vs evil. The only major complaint I would have is that Anakin's dark transformation was mostly unseen, which I found dissapointing because this is a huge part of the whole plot of Star Wars. Also, I found the romance between Amidala and Anakin was short-lived; that there was not enough spark. The fact that their romance brings about the existence of Luke and Leah is hard to believe, since the most romantic moment they shared was when Anakin was talking about sand.

It's better than Episode One ( of course ) but also better than all of the other Star Wars movies ( except for Return of the Jedi ). Yes, the acting is not good. The acting has never been good in Star Wars movies. Anything bad you could say about this movie could also be said about any of the others. It's on the same level as Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back. It has the adventure and humour of the first and the sense of ominous desperation of the second. Also, of course, it has the gleaming sense of childlike wonder. It's the childlike wonder which keeps people coming back to the Star Wars movies again and again. Anyone who's fallen in love with George Lucas' visions will fall in love all over again.

1321686,5,B00003CXKT,"The great thing about going to a film that has been out for awhile, and that many people have trashed, is that your expectation level is reduced to a normal level of expectancy, which is where it should be to begin with.
Flat out, I thought the film was terrific and that nearly all the criticisms I have read prior to seeing the flick were groundless, inane, and overblown.  First, this absurd idealization of the original films is nonsense!  They weren't that damn great.  They were new & original and breakthroughs, but the stories weren't that hot with the exception of Luke's quest & discovery of who his father has become.  There was little great dialogue, and no jaw-dropping performances. There was, thank goodness, Alec Guinness as Obi Wan. The rest of the cast just limboed in under the age limit not to be ridiculous in their awkward teen love scenes.  At least the young performers in this film are young!  Their awkwardness fits.  I always found the byplay between Carrie Fisher & Harrison Ford embarrassing.
Anyway, I'm not going to compare and contrast the two sets of films.  The old ones are what they are, the new ones are what they are.  I will just comment on all the vitriol heaped on Lucas, e.g.,  that he is too isolated & out of touch on his ranch (read empire). Well, he may be, but he's also busy inventing worlds & universes out there that I found beautifully realized, detailed, and exciting in this film.
The movie has some slow spots, but they don't last long.  There are some eye-popping, stunning and fantastic set-pieces: the chase through the nightscape of the huge city; the great fight on the water planet; the chase through the asteroids; the narrow escapes of the foundry/assembly line; the battle in the arena; the climactic battle with the clones & droids, and of course, Yoda going Postal!
All of this is done with seamless and gorgeous CGI work, with new and amusing characters, with all kinds of mean & nasty critters, with a new villain (our beloved Chris Lee) and with a drop-dead beautiful Natalie Portman (sorry Carrie) and a young Anakin who has a nasty temper and has committed a war crime already.  And Ewan McGregor makes a nice young Obi Wan.
The look of the film is fabulous (I saw it in digital) and the inventiveness and immagination throughout is phenomenal.  I ask his critics: what else can Lucas do?  He cannot make it all new & never-seen-before again.  He is presenting a complex story of how an individual and a society can turn to the ""dark side"". The groundwork for this story made Phantom Menace slow-going at times, I agree.  But the pace is accelerating.
Lucas presents us with fabulously imagined worlds & creatures, done with meticulous care. He has this film filled with mind-boggling action scenes.  He stretches the capability of the technology with each outing.  It's enough.  Works for me.",1024617600,30,2863,4.71285140562249
1321687,4,B00003CXKT,"I almost didn't want to be yet another one of the 500+ reviewers of this film, but in the end I couldn't resist putting my two cents in.  Whereas opinion on ""Star Wars"" and ""Empire"" is almost uniformly positive, and opinion on ""The Phantom Menace"" overwhelmingly negative, ""Attack Of The Clones"" has taken its place alongside ""Return Of The Jedi"" as a film where both critical and fan support can go either way.  Overall, ""Clones""
certainly improves on ""Phantom Menace"" in nearly every department: only 4 minutes of Jar Jar (who is given a scene in the Senate which is bound to make his haters jump for joy), a lot more Yoda (including the climactic fight scene), better integration of the CGI characters, a far more memorable (and talking!) villain in Christopher Lee's Dooku, a more complex plot and some of the best action sequences dished out since ""Empire"".  Whereas everything in ""Menace"" was flat and/or embarrassing (like Jar-Jar and Jake Lloyd's acting), ""Clones"" actually has some life to it.
Unfortunately, the film suffers from one main flaw: the dialogue and acting chemistry between its two leads, Anakin and Padme.  The romance that was supposed to provide the emotional backbone to the film is largely underwhelming, and both actors are about as flat as their lines are cliched (interestingly, some scenes/lines which might have given the romantic sequences some sign of intelligence were cut out of the original shooting script--why, Lucas, why?).  For the most part Anakin sounds whiny, extremely impatient and terribly irresponsible; this is the future Darth Vader?  Also, I could not believe that after admitting to the mass-murder of the Tusken raiders, Senator Amidala does nothing more than comfort Anakin when such an action should have been immediately reported to the Jedi council.
However, some reviewers have blown the romance angle out of proportion, claiming that it ruins the entire film; this is simply not the case, seeing as how it takes up
no more than 25 minutes out of a nearly 2 1/2 hour movie.  The rest of ""Clones"" is more intriguing, particularly the plot which keeps the true villain (Palpatine/Sidius) completely hidden.
The mystery of who ordered the clone army, and for what purpose,
is a highlight of the film, and that the army is finally used in service to the Republic provides the final twist and a clear indication of how the Storm Troopers/Empire will come about.
More than anything, however, it is the action sequences which delight, and ""Star Wars"" films are primarily action films.  Beginning with the high-speed chase through the city (""Blade Runner"" meets ""French Connection"", as one reviewer said), down through the Obi-Wan/Jango Fett battle, the asteroid sequence,
the ""top this"" factory segment and then the final land battle
and light-sabre duels, the film offers state-of-the-art action
segments that to these eyes are critic-proof.  To finally see
the fabled Clone Wars begin, at last, with dozens of Jedi in
action against thousands of droid soldiers was done remarkably
well (especially given the complex CGI involved); sometimes I think viewers have been spoiled over the last ten years, and that if ""Clones"" had come out only fifteen years ago it would have been considered an action-film masterpiece.  And once again, the climactic light sabre duel between Yoda and Dooku has either been praised as the icing on the cake or a disastrous debacle; I go for the former, as this is precisely how I envisioned such a small but powerful Jedi to fight--and when he reaches for his cane at the end of the battle, I was not
bewildered but rather remembered how the old aikido masters looked very frail but could deliver the goods in battle, and then return to frailty again (it was a nice tongue-in-cheek nod to the martial arts, in other words).  Add this to the return of the C3PO-R2D2 comedy duo (and yes, I hear they get their memories of Tattoine wiped by the time of Episode IV), a cameo by the Death Star, solid performances by Lee, Jackson and McGregor and an overall darker, edgier tone, and you get a great film--albeit one that is let down by the romance at its core.",1024617600,5,4137,4.912607449856734
1321757,5,B00003CXKT,"What can I say, Luca's did it again.  Episode II kicks butt, because this time you can see a lots of action, tons of lighsaber battles and romance.  Yes!, now we see young Anakin turning into the dark side; also he is involved with the now Senator Padm, starting their secret romance.  For the first time ever we can enjoy a massive jedi battle and of course master Yoda with his own lightsaber, he is the one!.  I think the performance were fine, the music also.  I don`t know what else to say, Dooku and Palpatine are planning the end of the Republic and the born of the Empire, Anakin is turning to the dark side...

I liked the fact that you get to see all of these great characters that preceded everyone in the original three.  I liked Obi-Wan's faceoff with Jenga Fett.  You also get to see Bobba Fett as a little kid - it was so cool.  The action was perhaps the best I've seen in a Star Wars movie.  It rivaled that of Return of the Jedi.  The cinematography was the best I've seen out of any star wars film.  There should have been more twists in the story though.  It was very simple and formulaic.  But there was still alot going on in the film.  There is the romance between Anakin and Padme, the fiery relationship between Anakin and his master Obi-Wan Kenobe, and also you get to see Yoda fight.  One thing that I didn't like about that was that Yoda is using a cane to help him when he walks and then all of the sudden he's doing all these flips.  It was weird to see that because they weren't consistent.  He shouldn't have had to use a cane in the first place.  Isn't he like fifty years younger than the original three episodes?  Other than these minor complaints the movie was very satisfying.  It was as close as you could get to the original three but not quite.  It was a great movie.",1024531200,,1336,4.254980079681275
1321761,1,B00003CXKT,"Perhaps in fairness to George Lucas, the Star Wars saga is played out, and it is difficult to continue to milk it. After all, you can have only so many death stars.
As for this movie, I challenge anyone to describe to me the basic story. There is no story, no characters and cetainly no clever or snappy dialouge. The original Star Wars saga was good, sometimes great because: (i) the story-line was clear and easy to follow; and (ii) it presented simply and effectively a myth-like, romantic confict between good and evil; and (iii) the script and dialogue were well done and at times clever and funny; and (iv) the foundation of the movie was not special effects but, rather, a solid story-line and good characterization. The special effects were great but not the foundation of the whole saga. Lucas seems devoted entirely to special effects and creating pointless (and stupid) alien characters to demonstrate his special effects prowess.
I will not go see another Star Wars movie, and I am ashamed of myself for going to see this last one.",1024531200,9,1043,4.736263736263736
1321762,2,B00003CXKT,"Fans of the original Star Wars trilogy hoping for a franchise revival with ""Attack of the Clones"" will be surprised to find a film that is, to be kind, badly written, badly acted and, shockingly, badly edited.  Which is fine if you're watching the Star Wars Christmas Special, but not here.
Even for casual moviegoers who are looking to ""just be entertained,"" the newest Star Wars film even fails to deliver on that task. Unlike the original three films, which put a simple story of good versus evil in a world formerly unseen by moviegoers, everyone involved with Attack of the Clones seems to have lost any sense that less is more. Why have two Jedis fighting when you can have 100? Why have one Jango Fett when you can have an army of them? Why have a simple good guy/bad guy story when you can create a plot much more needlessly complicated?
It's that mentality that hurts the film more than anything else. The film is overstuffed with effects sequences so long you feel like you're trapped watching someone else playing a videogame. In between are scenes of political dialogue so flat and dense it belongs on C-SPAN, and not in a fantasy film.
There are certain aspects to the film that are well done. Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi is, at last, allowed to be an action hero, and McGregor gives his scenes a gravitas that melts away whenever he's off screen. A chase through an asteroid field is also extremely entertaining in its use of sound design. And we finally get a two-minute glimpse at the evil emperor (which prompts a question: Does George Lucas know that we all know the emperor's true identity, or does he plan on making this a plot twist of some kind?).
But all of the good parts are such a small part of Episode II that it doesn't make watching the rest of it worthwhile. Of particular agitation is the love story between Hayden Christiansen and Natalie Portman. Portman, who is the equal of Audrey Hepburn in looks only, looks like she'd rather be anywhere else but on screen reciting her lines. And, try as Christiansen might, he can't overcome dialogue so poorly written it reduces the audience to unintentional laughter. Is real teen romance this cheesy? Of course it sometimes is. That's why it's best left out of movies altogether.  This is a romance that plays out like an extended version of the animal cracker scene in ""Armageddon.""
And even while those scenes have unquestionable camp value, the overlong action sequences in the film reduce the viewer more to boredom than anything else. Add in the return of Jar Jar Binks (who apparently learned Spanish while he was away), and a computerized Yoda, who now does his backwards-grammar thing every sentence to the point of annoyance, and the film's computer work ends up grating rather than gratifying.
Editing is also a problem. Because Episode II is basically an animated film with live actors, the challenge of the filmmakers is to have the two worlds blend seamlessly together. This is not the case here, as many scenes where people are computerized, and then are not, are handled clumsily. And for the viewer there's always a disconnect that won't allow you to get deeper into the story. There's no sense of danger, or urgency. And that's what ends up making the whole affair so dull.
Look, it's a tribute to the first three Star Wars films that fans continue to keep coming back to this series. They're looking for the magic, the excitement, they got when they saw those films the first time. But Episode II doesn't provide that, and neither will the trilogy's next installment, unless George Lucas hires a new screenwriter and a skilled director of actors. That likely won't happen. Still, Star Wars fans still have the original trilogy, and that's awfully tough to beat, as George Lucas should now be able to tell you.<P...",1024531200,5,3810,4.727819548872181

Great things about the movie:

- The army of Jedis fighting at the end. That rocked.
- Ewan McGregor. Still a great choice for young Obi Wan Kenobi.
- Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu. Very, very cool.
- The fact that it ties Episode I with the upcoming episodes, especially the origins of Boba Fett and the clones.

- I'm sorry, but Hayden Christensen just didn't cut it as Anakin. He was in desperate need for Obi Wan to make him write 50 times on the Padawan chalkboard ""I will behave like a real Jedi."" He took the teen-angst thing WAY too far. A little less jaw-clenching and a little more decent acting would have made Anakin a little more believable.
- The fact that Natalie Portman's clothes conveniently ripped and disappeared throughout the movie, ala Galaxy Quest. That was funny.
- Yoda the Hedgehog. Now in any other scene Yoda IS the Jedi Grandmaster, but I had to keep my 4-year-old (and husband) from laughing too loud during this oh-so-serious scene. I would have liked to have seen Windu take Dooku down with a little of the saber smack.
This movie is worth seeing at the theatre if just for the awesome effects on the big screen. Yes it had its downfalls but if you're at all into the Star Wars chronicles it's a must-see.",1024444800,,1676,4.534653465346534

But that's not enough.  But, if I wanted to see a great looking picture, I'd to the art museum.  I wanted to see a great film.  Sorry, but Lucas has lost it.  The writing is dreadful, the directing must have consisted of an endless repetition of the word ""Less!""  As in ""No, no, no!  You're showing some emotion!  I want less!  Act like a piece of wood!""
Poor Natalie Portman.  She's a fine actress and has done some fine performances in other work, but I don't think she's allowed to actually act in this movie.  And as for Anakin/Darth, his big dialog seems to consist of lines like ""She doesn't even know I'm here"" or ""It's not fair!"" or other petulant whinings.  This is a Jedi Knight after 10 years of training??  The Boy Scouts would have washed out this bum.
And the Amidala/Anakin relationship is insane.  Queen meets little boy.  Queen falls madly in pedophelic love with little boy.  Former-Queen finds out little boy is now a mass-murdering whining young man, so she marries him without a second thought.  Huh???  Is this universe full of morons?  Or is it the writer?
Poor Ewen McGregor is stuck with lines like ""I hate it when he does that,"" when AnakinDarth jumps out of a flier.  Holy fish-reek, Batman!
And, of course, another needless, useless chase scene.  Enough, already, George!  Whe know you love hotrods!
By the way, when AnaDarth is going through the Chompers ...did anyone wonder, ""Gee! So this is how he lost his hand.""  But noooo, he doesn't.  So what's the point of the scene?  To fill time, of course.
Visually, this a a great movie.  In any other way it is horrible.  2 stars just for the visuals.

I enjoyed both the action parts and the romantic parts, I think both were acted out quite well. For those who think that I am simply ""following the crowd"", taking everyone's opinion and giving this such a high rating because I love the trilogy, you're wrong. I had NEVER seen the trilogy before, and I even own them - I just never cared to see them. Then a friend of mine, who is an avid Star Wars fan, told me I should go see episode II, and I finally did, figuring that it's summer, I have nothing better to do, might as well.

I can't believe the line ups and the 4 star review.  Did the rest of you see a different movie than I did?  I felt like I'd been hit with a bucket of cold water.

AOTC does have problems but really any movie does, let me go back to the quote ""Anyone can find flaws with a film. From ""Gone With The Wind"" to ""Schindler's List,"" if you enter the film with skepticism you can pick any narrative apart.

The love story between Padme Amidala and Anakin Skywalker is beautifully executed, the battle scenes (in particular Obi Wan Kenobi against Jango Fett in the rain) are thrilling and beautifully shot and the fuller integration of Jedi Master Mace Windu (a superb Samuel L. Jackson) is an inspired move that I believe will stand the series is good stead for years to come. Ewan McGregor is also a bright spot, his newly mature and bearded Obi Wan is really the moral center of this film and does the work and legend of Sir Alec Guiness proud.  The newly digitized Yoda (kicking [rear]!) is a stroke of brilliance and should garner George Lucas an Oscar nod next year for special effects. The Gorgeous Natalie Portman has matured into an even lovlier Padme' and plays the role with an understated passion and dignity that makes one truly fall in love with her. The only quibble I have is the lack of rage and intensity exhibited by newcomer Hayden Christenson. While his scenes with Portman are well played, he simply lacks the anger and edge I believe is necessary to become the evil genius that we know as Darth Vader, make him cruel and dangerous!
Overall, this is a brilliant, stunning modern epic that will easily eclipse the other ""Star Wars"" films (except ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of course) and can stand alongside any sci-fi movie proudly. George Lucas should be proud.",1024358400,6,1400,4.737704918032787

The ones who see this movie for what it is, stand to be a minority but a worthy bunch.  Because at a time when the mob mentality rules, they refuse to be duped.
I gave 1-star because I am a saddened original trilogy fan.  What makes me sad is the way Lucas and Company uses the original trilogy to milk more money and to cheat the trilogy's many adoring fans with ""clones"" that have no spirit and no life.  What started out as a young man's dream about the universe and the ""force"" now is reduced to....self-denial, grandiosity, and pretension.",1024272000,13,723,4.4961832061068705
1321923,3,B00003CXKT,"As a die-hard fan of the original series and having enjoyed Episode 1 (altho after a while Jar Jar can be a little irritating) I was excited about seeing Episode 2. I had hoped it would be better than Episode 1, but sadly, it wasn't really. I would have never ever thought that I could give a Star Wars film 3/5 stars, but that's about what it's worth. By the end of it I was just depressed.
The Good - Little things, like the locations, the design of certain technologies, the odd line that worked and teeny tiny (and not so teeny tiny) references to what happens in the original trilogy. Also, the introduction of a young Owen and Beru was interesting. Plus, very little Jar Jar Binks.
The Bad - Anakin was terrible. He was just... blah. Never mind the fact that he's a central character and should have been cast better. The love story was nothing to get excited about either. Quite boring and disturbing to see in Star Wars. Also a lot of repeated scenes from the original trilogy makes it look like George Lucas couldn't think of anything new!
The Unfortunately Humorous - Any tense moments were not really that tense cause u know who's meant to die and who isn't, we have seen the original trilogy after all. Yoda's fight scene was funny because of the silly way they did him. I was horrified to find myself laughing, cause he's a powerful Jedi master and you're not really supposed to laugh at him.
Overall - Well, it's watchable, if a little boring at times. Not the best Star Wars movie by far. The effects are good, but so what? The storyline really just fills in the gap between Episode 1 and what will happen in Episode 3. The love story is weak but since it's Star Wars we're all gonna see it anyway, so what difference does it make?

1321924,4,B00003CXKT,"To say that this movie had great expectations on it would be a bit of an understatement; in fact, just about everyone who hated(and loved) the Phantom Menace was watching for this one; including myself.  And did it pay to go and see this; in a word, yes.
Possible the best so far of the prequels, AOTC seems to have a good balance of acting and Special f/x.  That's not to say that the acting is the greatest ever; more then a few parts will have you scratching your head(mostly due to how the dialoge is at times) but overall, good enough to carry you through.
Hayden Christensen's Anakin is okay but at times seems more childish at times, mature at others.  Watching him go from cool and collected to whiney is enough to get enyone who knows about Star Wars to say; ""Yep, this is Luke Skywalker's Dad alright"".  His overall performance while okay could use a little more improvement.
As for Ewan McGregor, he in my opinion was the best actor in the entire movie.  Many comparisons have been made to the late Alec Guiness' role of Obi Wan and I don't blame them at all; he got the role down pat this time around.  Always cool and collected, he pretty much kept Anakin from making a complete fool of himself.
Also no review would be complete without a quick nod to Christopher Lee.  The best sith since well, Vader.  He uses every trick in the book and at times writes a few chapters.  Without him in this movie, we probably would have gotten more Darth Maul type villan; which to say the character wasn't all that bad but Maul was more like a background thug type and not the higher ups.
I could go on and on but I don't want to bore; so I'll just finish a long story with this: Acting was good but wooden, CGI was better placed this time, final 40 minutes the best in Star Wars history, Romance parts could have been much better then they were.

1321925,3,B00003CXKT,"That's how I rated this film overall. If you can get through the first hour of this prequil, you will be pleasantly surprise by Master Yoda himself.
The movie would have been much better for me if they would have recast Anakin Skywalker. That actor had no depth, wined all the time and just couldn't act. Fortunately he had Natalie Portman next to him that gave a stellar performace and for me - she acted for both of them. More credit to her.
It was just long and slow for the first hour and fifteen minutes and then the action picked up. Once that did, Obiwan and Master Yoda rocked the screen. Very cool.
Of course the movie is filled with Merchandise opportunites, but, guess what, that's why it was made. (Be real George.) Unfortunately for Star Wars fans, my belief is that SPiderman will do much, much better. It had a much more believable teen romance/relationship in it.
I will give credit that Attack Of The Clones is much better then The Phantom Menance. Sorry again George!",1024272000,,985,4.53932584269663
1321926,5,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones is amazing. Period. Using the latest digital effects, George Lucas has created an outstanding flick.
The story opens about ten years after the Phantom Menace, with Padme Amidala arriving on Coruscant to cast a vote for a non-military movement. When she arrives, her ship is destroyed, killing her decoy and several guards. During those ten years, a Jedi named Count Dooku has created a seperatist movement from the republic, rallying systems to his cause. The republic wanted to use military force against them, but Padme was against it.
Concerned with the attack, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine has two Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, both of whom have not seen her for ten years, assigned her protectors. Anakin is still in love with her. Right off the bat, the assasin trys again, leading the Jedi on a fantastic chase through the Coruscant traffic. They find the bounty hunter, but she is killed before they can find her employer. Obi-Wan goes off to find the killer, while Anakin and Padme go to Naboo to hide.
Obi-Wan finds himself at Kemino, a planet where clones are made, and finds that a Clone Army, numbering in the millions are ready for the republic. He then finds Jango Fett, the bounty hunter whom he is seeking and engages him in an exciting battle that involve lightsabers, flying around and missiles.
Anakin has visions of his mother, and heads off to Tatooine, where he finds her, but she dies in his arms. He starts to go to the dark side of the force here.
Obi Wan tracks Jango to another planet, where he is captured, but not before sending off a message about the clone army and Jango. Anakin and Padme rush off to the rescue, only to be captured themselves.
They are put in an areana, where a furious battle takes place. The republic brings in the clone army, and the battle begins. I won't try to describe it. One, its too chaotic. Two it would ruin it. Lets just say the there are clone troopers, Jedi, battle droids (many kinds of them) and ships. The movie comes down to a wonderful lightsaber battle. Yoda fights, along with Anakin and Obi-Wan.
This movie is probably one of the best there. The action scenes are outstanding, and the overall story is pretty good. The romance in it is kind of weak, but it works out okay. This is the pivitol moment in the series, and George Lucas doesn't disapoint. Well worth seeing many times.",1024272000,2,2388,4.661137440758294
1321927,4,B00003CXKT,"Now this is more like it, this is much, but very much better than Episode 1, this is more like the original films. The movie just lacks something, I can't really say what it lacks of, but it does. But this is much better, the dialogue is pretty cheap, but the performances are quite good, Christopher Lee is the best in his short role as Count Dooku, similar to Sauruman in LOTR, but not as good. Ewan McGregor was better as Obi-Wan than last time, in this one he is more like the character Alec Guiness created. Hayden Christensen was great as pre-Darth Vader, he knew how to be, angry, vengeful, that scene in which he beheads all the Tusken Raiders that kill his mother was pure Darth Vader, and his lines are all lines that could easily come from Vader. Natalie Portman was also better, like Leia in Empire Strikes back, and also, she looked beautiful, with the more revealing outfits that made her look really sexy. Samuel L. Jackson was fairly good, but lets face it, his role was short. The best thing of the movie, also hilarious is when Yoda kicks ... against Christopher Lee, I laughed because it is just funny to see him do all the things he does. Another GREAT thing was that Jar Jar only gets like 5 minutes of screen time, thats the way it should be. The movies is very good, at the begining it looks like Blade Runner, when Obi-Wan enters the bar to get a drink. The soundtrack is not as great as the old ones, plus, Williams re-used some notes from Hook, in the Love theme, but it sounded fine, also the Imperial March has return, that was good. The lightsaber action is extremely great, I love lightsabers, I think they are the best of Star Wars in in this one there is plenty. This movie is like Episode 5, the best one, and although this one is not as good, it is the Star Wars I like, I think we should encourage Lucas to keep it up be making this one make more money than the dreadful Episode 1, because I loved this one, really loved it, and hope to see an Episode 3 similar to this one, only wiht the next improvements, better soundtrack, more mature dialogue, less or the same screen time for Jar Jar and that thing that it lacks of that was on the original films, but this one was very good, keep it up George Lucas, you are on the good side of the force.",1024185600,4,2280,4.267898383371825

OK, they obviously minimized Jar Jar's part as much as they felt they could. That's a positive thing.
No annoyingly cutesy child actors - that's another good thing.
However, a complete lack of an interesting, coherent, well-crafted plot is a BAD thing!
Anakin is given no character development - he's simly snotty and arrogant all the way through.
Why Amidala falls in love with him is a mystery - if she were portrayed as the ruthlessly ambitious polititian people keep hinting that she might be, it would make sense, but her character seems sweet as pie from start to finish.
and WHY didn't we get to see Anakin slaughter the Tuskan Raiders? That would have been the most powerful scene in the story!!
Overall, the first part of the movie (with the assassin) was best - but mainly because it borrowed an awful lot of cool ambience from Blade Runner.

Mcgregor was more believeable & intelligent as was the Obi Wan we've seen in Episode 4 but, is probably still years away from us seeing him with his new look. I kept getting distracted by my thinking about the music video & Jesus... but this has to be my most favorite character in the star wars films right now. Excellent job, Ewan! Yoda...!

What attracted you to SW in the first place? The exquisite diologe or the special effects? Now, I frist saw the original trilogy in 1997 when they brought out the special edition so i don't know how much of a difference that made to those who saw it in 1977. But i also got the last available copy of the original, origiinal trilogy and it didn't seem that much different. So anyways I think we were all attracted to the fantasy and eye popping special effects in the first place. Who cares if the diologe was a little bit corney? It was only that way in a couple times. Yeah maybe padme and anakin didn't really seem to be in love or have chemistry but did han and leia? SW would be totally setback if Lucas had to fire Hayden and go search for another actor who had great chemisty with Natalie. Anyways I just wish people would stop bashing this movie and thankfully latley, this movie is getting a lot more good reviews. I was satisfied beyond my expections because I was going to see SW and not Shakespere. The war scenes were so stunning i'm still taking it all in and i saw it twice!

1322007,4,B00003CXKT,"""Episode II"" or Star Wars is a satisfyingly exciting adventure, and it leaves me wanting to see the next installment. There is certainly no shortage of action and spectacular effects and settings (monsters and huge crowds of creatures and clones, a crowded futuristic metropolis, light sabers and laser guns galore, space chases with explosions, etc.) I loved the scene in which our heroes are forced to battle monsters in a kind of Roman Coliseum. Fans of the series will especially enjoy a scene of Yoda dueling with a light saber. In this episode we also see the budding romance between Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala. (Okay, so the acting and dialogue ain't great, but then it never was in any of the other Star Wars films either if you look at them objectively. Alec Guiness is a noted exception. And Ewan McGregor does a pretty good job here playing the young Kenobe.)What matters most here is the plot, as we begin to suspect the clever manner in which Chancelor Palpatine may soon wreak havoc on the Republic. The film does a good job of capturing the dark atmosphere of a world about to collapse. There may be a general absence of the lighthearted fun which pervaded the earliest Star Wars movie (now known as Episode 4) but the mythological tale that needs to be told here is not a funny one. As Yoda says, ""begun this clone war has,"" and it's not always a pretty sight - though it is a spectacular one, and worth seeing on the big screen.",1023926400,2,1453,4.592307692307692
1322008,2,B00003CXKT,"A long time ago in Hollywood CA...A young, considerabley brilliant writer/director named George Lucas had a vision of creating a universe all his own. Well the rest is history. His brainchild spawned arguable the greatest trilogy ever made. Now fast forward to the ""new"" Star Wars trilogy, what happened? Where is the magic, where is that brilliance, where is Han Solo? They're not around anymore, they were abandoned in the early 80's for a career in computer technology. The new Star Wars trilogy is less a man expanding his mythical legacy and more an excuse for him to display his innovations in computer graphic effects. Case in point: Episode II, Attack of the Clones.
Anyone who is reading this review has no doubt seen the film so there is no reason to plot summarize, instead, a few observations. First, this film is a joke as far as the acting is conserned. Ask any good director, casting is 90% of an effective performance. Hayden Christensen? He whines, he cries, he can't deliver the diologue (which was terrible, but hold on). As in Episode I, Anakin is not sympathetic. Aren't we suppose to care that this young man will subcome to the dark side and a life of evil? At this point it will be a relief when he becomes Darth Vader, Anakin is not interesting, as say, Luke was. Other priciples, particularly Portman, are also aweful. The relationship between Padme and Anakin is laughable. If they did not say they were in love out loud, no one would believe it, she looks repulsed by him, not seduced by him. The script, what is this? The story is there, but the screenplay is horrible. Who is Jonathan whats-his-name? One can only imagine how bad the script was before he pollished it with lines like, ""I don't like sand it's rough and coarse, but you're smooth."" Ahhhhhhhh! Where have you gone Lawerence Kasden, our galaxy turns it's desparate eyes to you.
And on another note is the computer graphics. George Lucas has made amazing strides in the industry with ILM, they are the Jedi of special effects, but come on! This looks more like a cartoon than live action. In Return of the Jedi, the dog fight between the Rebelion and the Empire looks so real, how did they do it? In Attack of the Clones (and in Episode I) it's just computer graphics and it looks as such. Did Yota have to be CG? How are the actors suppose to perform against characters and settings that aren't there? Instead they stand against a green screen, and a director who could not care less about their performances, describes to them what will be around them. It's enough to make a grown man cry.
Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola are suppose to be two of Lucas's good friends. What kind of friends are they being by letting Lucas take everything out of what made Star Wars great?  At least tell him he needs to turn it over to another director like he did before.  Give him some advice, please, there is still time to save Episode III.
Star Wars was great because it was creative, exciting, and we cared about the characters. I wonder when years from now, when there are six completed films, how many people watching them for the first time, in chronological order, starting with Episode I, will actually make to Star Wars (Episode IV). Unless Episode III is amazing, I wouldn't.  Shame on Lucas.",1023926400,3,3292,4.6239316239316235
1322009,3,B00003CXKT,"Say what you will about George Lucas, you have to give the guy credit for setting himself a difficult task in ""Star Wars: Attack of the Clones"" (and I do mean beyond trying to deliver a film that will meet the almost impossibly high standards of his millions of fanatical followers).  By choosing to place Anakin Skywalker front and center as the story's main focal point, Lucas does what few others in this business are willing to do - which is to risk making a crowd-pleasing epic without a likable central ""hero.""  After all, since this film is a prequel and not a sequel to the original trilogy, we all know that this brooding young man will end up turning into the irredeemably evil Darth Vader.  Of course, Luke Skywalker fulfilled the requirements of conventional hero for the original series and even Han Solo, though he was a bit of a rogue and a scoundrel, always allowed his virtuous side to break through when the chips were down.  Anakin, though, for all his internal struggles in this film, is predestined to go over to the Dark Side (certainly in the next installment).  The pre-knowledge the audience is privy to from our acquaintance with the later chapters gives the film a kind of poignant sadness at times - or at least it would if Lucas had done a better job as both writer and director in bringing it out.  Unfortunately, the dialogue is so poorly written that Anakin comes across as little more than a petulant, peevish, moony-eyed schoolboy most of the time - hardly either the ""greatest Jedi knight"" we keep being told he has the potential to become nor the future Hitlerian dictator we know he will one day be.  His romantic, puppy-love interludes with Senator (former Queen) Padme Amidala are embarrassing at best.  We have indeed come a long way from the fun love triangle involving Luke, Han and the feisty Princess Leia.
In fact, that seems to be the basic trouble with this film, as it was with the previous installment, ""The Phantom Menace.""  Somewhere along the way, someone drained all the FUN out of ""Star Wars.""  The first three films seemed so fresh, so adroit, so light on their feet.  The prequels, though they are not without interest, feel bloated, top heavy and devoid of any real conviction or excitement.  One cannot fault Lucas, I guess, for becoming overly fascinated with his matted backgrounds, computer graphics and special effects, but it does no one any good to have all that hardware whirling by in the background when the action in the foreground is so banal and uninteresting.  Even the set pieces here - a flying car chase through a crowded city that defies all known laws of physics, a cluttered battle scene that takes place in a gladiatorial stadium - don't get the adrenalin pumping in the same way that the space battles in the original ""Star Wars,"" the race through the forest in ""Return of the Jedi"" or even the pod race in ""The Phantom Menace"" did.  And I will reiterate a comment I made three years ago about that last film.  Why is it that, in a movie with ""Star Wars"" in its title, are there virtually no outer space battle scenes in this picture?  Is that really too much to ask?
A few other problems plague the picture.  R2D2 and C-3PO, whose one-sided bantering lent such charm to the original films, have become virtual extras in the story by this time.  And since the rest of the script is so entirely witless, the few moments they have together stick out too much as obvious (and not very effective) attempts at comic relief.  No longer do these two uniquely nonhuman characters feel like an integral part of the action.  Even worse, the once endearing Yoda, with his annoyingly inverted sentences and his never-ending string of sanctimonious pearls of wisdom, has, quite literally, become this movie's Jar-Jar Binks (who does appear but in a much more limited role).  The acting by Hayden Christensen (Anakin), Natalie Portman , Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan McGregor (a young Obi-Wan Kenobi, and who is going to believe that McGregor will mature to become the distinguished Alec Guiness?) is serviceable at best, as the performers have been put there basically to deliver the stilted dialogue and serve as foreground for the upstaging special effects.
So, after all these complaints, is ""Attack of the Clones"" worth seeing?  Surprisingly, the answer is ""yes"" and it really has nothing to do with the special effects.  The reason this film is worth seeing is because Lucas has undertaken to pull off something virtually unique and unprecedented in modern cinema.  He is attempting to tell a complete story over the span of six different movies.  Even when we can see how the film isn't coming together the way it should, we can't help but plug into the narrative development itself.  Because we know how it will all end up, we want to see how the missing pieces of the puzzle will fall in to place to give us the complete, total picture.  So even if each individual installment doesn't exactly carry us away, there's enough interest in the vision itself to keep us coming back for more.",1023840000,,5056,4.702947845804989
1322010,1,B00003CXKT,"This movie was very boring.  People began to leave at about 1/4 of the movie. People who stayed were falling asleep around my seat.  The graphic and sound was very good.  At one point I thought I was watching the cut-scenes from Grim Frimdago (in the caf&eacute;) and Abe's Oddworld (the princess jumping around in the factory).  I tried to find a reason why a ""great"" movie like this was so boring.  I came up with this conclusion.  This movie did not have any philosophical or psychological value that made my brain entertain.  Nor did this movie provided any mystery for me to solve.  Usually you have something to talk about after watching a movie but not for this one.  I didn't even like the computer graphic.  Graphic was very good but it was not real.  The feeling of ""being there"" was not in this movie.  It was missing the feeling of ""THERENESS"" if I might make out a word for it. In the old movie, when you saw a X-Wing flying by, you knew it was a model; but in a sense, it was REAL and it was THERE.  If you have nothing to do, go see why there is all the hype about digital movie.  If not, don't waste your time waiting in long line to go see this movie.",1023840000,6,1168,4.202702702702703
1322011,3,B00003CXKT,"It has been said many times that special effects and computer graphics will make acting irrelevent.  This movie is the ultimate proof that this is not true.
This movie has excellent special effects, great computer graphics, and some excellent plotting.  It has characters that we care about from the previous movie and a built in audiance.  What it is lacking is acting, and this turns what should have been a blockbuster into just an ordinary movie.
These performances were more wooden than Al Gore, Even Chrsitopher Lee could not bring order to this chaos.  This movie reeked with boredom, the big fight at the end was better, but the animated fighting Yoda, of which I have heard others rave about didn't work for me.  He looked like a bouncing tribble.
Again the plotting from the clone planet, Our young bounty hunter, the trade federation still wanting revenge on the queen etc... really had potential.  Even Ms. Portman's slowing shrinking clothing (Which my 11 year old noticed right away but I didn't, must be getting old)couldn't make this movie interesting.
It could be said that because this picture has to be shoehorned into a particular place that limitations exist, it is a crime to the other 4 movies which were all much better that they failed.
I am reminded about something Elijah Wood said in an interview.  He and some other cast member of LORD OF THE RINGS were visiting the location of this movie.  Wood commented that Portman thought them odd since they kept referring to themselves as ""hobbits"".  She made it plain she was Natalie Portman NOT Padm Amidala.  Too bad she didn't think like the Hobbits, that might have been the difference between an avg movie and a classic.",1023840000,2,1696,4.797250859106529

Plot:
This was okay. Definitely better than the first, it helps us to really understand where Anakin is coming from, and how he's going to get to be Darth Vader. Sets up for the third, in which I hear that Padme's purchasing maternity clothes.
Casting choices:
Ewan McGregor -- Obi-Wan Kenobi
*****/*****
This actor is one of the things that really helped the film. He resembles the original Obi-Wan more in this film than in the first, especially since he is older. McGregor brought the essence of the original three into this one, and helped it to bring up my rating.
Hayden Christensen -- Anakin Skywalker
****/*****
Christensen was pretty good, but not great. His use of emotions was impressive, and fits with his turning to the dark side, because the more emotional you are, the more likely you are to experience hate, anger, fear -- which, according to Yoda, lead to the Dark Side.
Natalie Portman -- Padme/Amidala
***/*****
She was okay. I think she could have been a little older, though. Of course, they needed her back from the first film . . .
Anyway, Portman pulled in a so-so performance, better than the last one, at least.

1322073,5,B00003CXKT,"I have been a Star Wars fan since I was 4. I got bored one day when I was 4 and my dad put in these movies. They were the 3 Star Wars movies and ever since, I have been in love with Lucas' work. Not many fans like The Phantom Menace but it wasn't that bad.
Then finally came the second prequel, Attack of the Clones. I had been counting down the days for this movie since TPM. But what made the wait so much better was the fact that Hayden Christensen was starring in it. I've been a fan of his for three years already, a year before he even got the role of Anakin Skywalker. When it was announced that he was going to be Anakin, I knew George made the right choice. Hayden is by far the best young actor out there and he does an amazing job with anger scenes, so he is perfect for the role of Anakin.
But when I finally got to see Attack of the Clones, I thought Hayden could have done better. Then I had to keep in mind, all the actors work with the bluescreen. Well after the first half hour of dull acting from everyone except Ewan McGregor (who is just INCREDIBLE and perfect in this movie and everything else he does) the acting was a whole lot better and perfect. Hayden did an AMAZING job as Anakin like I thought (not his best work though). I thought he did a great ""going crazy"" scene when he found his mother. I didn't believe the relationship between he and Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). George said to have picked Hayden because of his chemisty with Natalie but there was no chemistry in the movie. It was just there but it's supposed to be.
Ewan McGregor, once again, was just amazing!! I have always liked his work but he is just the perfect Obi Wan Kenobi. You can't get better than him. I have wondered why Ewan doesn't get as much credit as he deserves. He's a rare talent and it shows in Attack of the Clones. He was by far the best actor in the movie and I feel it's his best work since A Life Less Ordinary. I could go on forever about how incredible he is in AOTC.
Now, to the most talked about scene in any movie this summer...(SPOILER) ....Yoda. The best action sequence ever in a movie! It deserves an MTV Award for Best Fight. It was so incredible and everything a Star Wars fan has ever wanted.
I admit, the movie had wooden acting AT THE BEGINNING. After the first 30 minutes, it's amazing. Hayden gave a great performance, Natalie did an amazing job, Ewan is the most incredible thing to ever happen to Star Wars and show biz, and YODA KICKED [butt].
Episode III is going to be the best Star wars movie ever when it comes out. Episode II is leading up to it very well! Forget the critics on this one. Go see it because it's definitely worth the $7! (And for you girls who think Hayden is fine...he has a scene where hes not wearing a shirt and laying in bed. It's very nice.)
So go see it!! DVD comes out November 6, as far as I know.",1023667200,10,2866,4.14721723518851

1322076,1,B00003CXKT,"The title basically summarizes my feelings but let me expand on this. First of all the plot is horrible and confusing. Among the boatload of chaos was hard to figure out why the clones were created. I love how ""Count Dooku"" out of the blue becomes a major player without any real backround. Secondly the acting was terrible unconvincing. The dialogue between the characters is laughable at many points. I do not need to mention such a stupidity like the Yoda fight scene - AKA ""The Monty Python Rabbit"". How about the touching scene showing the Fett family? The whole film has a completely amateur feel about it. Even the names of the characters are hideous: Dooku, Darthsidious??? It is as if Lucas had a junior-high student write the film over a weekend. Cmon George; in this time of national crisis you did not have to add to the mess. I am glad that I did not shell out full price for this garbage. The amount of money raked in by the last 2 movies are testimony to how much goodwill he has built up based on the first 3 movies. If you take out the ""Star Wars"" name the last two movies would have the same public support as ""Dune"". I am really wondering if this is the real George Lucas or some type of clone created to torment Americans. I am just surprised that many people actually seem to have a positive view of this movie. These people need to look past the Star Wars name and actually focus on the substance of the film. Either that or we need to start drug-testing large segments of the public. You can be sure that this movie is going to be released on DVD quickly. It follows the rule that the worse a movie the quicker and with more hype it gets a video release. By this rule it should be out at home in oh about 1 month. I am glad that Lucas is showing the public so much respect by releasing the last 2 movies on DVD while not doing so for the real Star Wars (the first three). Thanks George for holding out on the good stuff and feeding us the sludge.

Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman have great chemistry.  I do not possibly see how someone could give this movie a bad review like some of those I have read at Amazon.

George Lucas has obviously forgotten how to direct or write, and the only thing that he's got going for him is ILM's special effects. I'm not Woody Allen, who ""couldn't care less for the effects"". I like seeing new special effects, but they have to serve the story, not just promote consumerism for the kids under 10.
The only point I liked in a movie was a first confrontation between Obi-Van and Count Dooku, when for a moment it seems that Jedi knights were working for the future Emperor (not knowing it, of course), and that Count Dooku was the only one who saw through the deception of the Dark side. Too bad that storyline was dropped at the end of the movie and not carried over to the Episode Three.
Also, Yoda swinging a light sabre was not bad and Amidala looks great, but that-makes-a-movie-not...

However, Episode I was very different from the originals.  It was more concerned about making a metaphor to the Roman Republic/Empire instead of being concerned about more fun and adventure - this is not a bad thing, especially if you bother to listen to the political dialogue in Ep I (which I didn't bother to do the first time I saw it.)
Episode II has much more fun and adventure although it's a pretty dark story ... but not too dark ... not nearly as dark as The Empire Strikes back.  We witness more of the ensemble cast going through a dangerous adventure TOGETHER, which is what most people loved about the originals.  The droids add more comical relief, as they did in the originals.  However, the ensemble cast doesn't have quirky or humorous lines like they used to - but, remember, this movie takes place before the Empire destroyed much of civilization - this is a much more complex time.
The action is great, and there's never a dull moment.  I didn't like the opening chase through Coruscant - the chase through between the buildings was SO not Star Wars.

1322214,3,B00003CXKT,"Watching ""Attack of the Clones"", I was struck by what is so very wrong with Lucas' latest Star Wars movies.  In the original movie, we got to experience a great adventure through the eyes of a simple, identifiable character (Luke Skywalker).  By the time the story took on greater scope in its sequels, we were already familiar with the good guys and cared for them, and already knew and detested the villian.  In the latest movies, however, it is really hard to care for (or hate) any of the characters.
In Phantom Menace, Anakin was an annoying little kid with amazing talents which made him impossible to identify with.  In the latest movie, he is suddenly older but even more annoying and self-obsessed.  The Princess (now Senator) also mostly comes off as being outside of society and is about as easy to identify with as Prince Charles.  And the relationship between the two is stiff and wooden.  Scenes of the two together completely derail the pacing of the movie.  Christopher Lee (usually excellent) is wasted as a pathetic villian.  At least, unlike Darth Maul (or however it is spelled, the WORST villian in cinematic history), he is given some lines so you do get to know some of his motivation and character.  And Jar Jar Binks, although thankfully relegated to only a few seconds, is still grating and annoying.
The reason why this film is better than Phantom Menace, however, is that (besides having more action scenes), character who are already familiar from the first trilogy play a much greater role.  Sure, Yoda and Obi Wan Kenobi are not given much character development in this film, but at least you already know them.  And Ewen McGregor's performance is very enjoyable, and you can see in him the future Obi Wan played by Alec Guinness.  The best parts involve him going up against Boba Fett's father.  In general, whenever Yoda or Obi Wan are on the screen investigating the future Emporer's conspiracy or fighting villians, the movie once again becomes more of the fun experience Star Wars used to be.
Unfortunately, you know already that all the main heroes are going to survive the film, so there is little suspense (unlike, say, with Titanic where knowing ahead of time that a disaster is coming makes you worry for the leads).  And, as noted above, Lucas still fails to give us a good villian and derails the film with an annoying (and unromantic) romantic subplot.  And I still want to strangle Jar Jar Binks even during his thankfully brief appearances.  This trilogy is still only worthwhile as a prelude to the first three.

I know Aniken is supposed to become Drath Vader but he didn't have to be so arrigrat it would of made it better and the part where he threw the the srewdriver was stupid. We didn't get to see him kill all thoughs outlaws either which dissappointed me. And the fact that he said Padma tormentmented him was stupid. Now lets talk about the characters,Aniken grew older and kindof had the same thing as he was a boy,Oby 1 looked like an old man,even Jar Jar looked a bit older,but Padma. It's been 10years and she looks exactly the same! That was not cool and that kindof brought unpleasant motions to my mind. I gave it 3stars cause all of that. I liked the movie and at the end where Yota took out his light saber...! That was cool. The aliens from Comena looked cool and the time where the 3 are stuck on the poles and Dokuu takes out the ugly aliens to go and kill them that was cool.

Following the Star Wars saga tradition, the story gets this time more solid in dramaturgy,without falling into any cheap sentimental cliches. Actors are very good.
The story is strong by its consistence, and the apparition of  clones makes it really serious,if we already know that their future lays in the dark side. Here, something lets us suspect our future too.
Sceneries and graphic works are incredible. Starting right away with this beautiful shaped airplane-spaceship, then the vertical endless cities (I remember the 'fifth element' there), passing from one world to another, all differents in shapes and moods and filling your eyes with action, colours and beauty.
The battles are amazing in speed, imagination, fantasy and great camera work.
Elements of the episode IV are starting to appear on the scene, telling us to make the link.
Costumes are beautiful,  worlds and technologies are futuristic amazing. The animals-monsters are so real that I woudn't like to meet one of them around the corner. Sounds and noises are of the best.
Finally, Christofer Lee is there again with his incredible dark-force presence.
John Williams does an excellent work  by putting music elements of Holst and Wagner at the right place. It works.  Still, I am a little puzzled to see a futurist 25th century movie with a 19th century music. No risks taken with the music there! I would have given it 5 stars.",1023235200,,1468,4.931174089068826

This is a movie that needs to be taken in context of the great, six-movie story of the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker.  In Episode I, we see a little Anakin Skywalker, full of potential...here, we see an almost grown up Anakin.  Some people have given blatent spoilers in their reviews.  Some critics have said the dialogue is flat.  There's a lot going on in this movie, and it is always interesting.  The best things about this movie are Jango Fett, Darth Tyranus, Darth Sidious, Obi-Wan, not to mention Anakin and Padme Amidala.  This movie has the turning point of Anakin...fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering (according to Yoda).  And the movie just keeps getting better as it goes along, with John Williams score thundering throughout the theater.

1322299,4,B00003CXKT,"...  First off, let me say, I saw this movie just this past weekend, and it wasn't easy but I tried to not listen to reveiews to the point where it would cloud my judgment about the movie before I even saw it.  I went in with zero-to-none expectations.
That said, yes Hayden Christensen's acting was somewhat wooden.  It is soooooo funny, though, ... say his acting was worse in the first half of the film, considering films are NOT shot in order of their scenes, but oh, well . . . for that matter, Natalie Portman wasn't much better.  However . . .
This did NOT keep me from enjoying one of the most fascinating movies I have ever watched.  Visually, the film is amazing, offering something for the eyes the entire time the movie is running.  WOW.  Was amazed, especially with the last 30-45 minutes, and yes George Lucas is a genius.
I loved the movie, but maybe that was beause all I was expecting was to be entertained.  So many people act like George Lucas is some kind of god not living up to expectations - well, he did for me.  NONE of the ""Star Wars"" films have been particularly heavy on plot or acting ability, but they've all been first-class entertainment; westerns set in space, in a way.  The love story between Padme and Anakin in this one was never annoying or too smarmy (though it got close at points).  The battle scenes and action/chase sequences were 100% believable and engrossing.  Overall, the movie was so many steps above ""Phantom Menace"" (talk about a boring movie!), it wasn't funny.  The ending was nothing short of amazing.  With this film I think Lucas has gotten MUCH closer to his original vision of the first trilogy, and I eagerly await part three of this one.",1023235200,,1697,4.485342019543974
1322300,5,B00003CXKT,"This movie is so hard to talk about without giving away the fine plot details as it's just such a beautifully constructed film in the series of Star Wars movies.
This film opens the floodgates known as the Star Wars universe. People who have seen the original trilogy, yet have never grasped the scope of the universe of this franchise will be amazed, and thrilled by this movie.
There is no doubting that Episode 2 will open the eyes of old fans, and give them much to have goosebumps about, but i must contain myself.
There is SO much to be seen in this movie that one sitting is nowhere near enough! You will need to conversate with friends, and get other views just to understand all the intentions that George Lucas had, the plot is that deep.
You may think you have a grasp on the Star Wars universe, but after viewing this film you will realize that it would be a shame to not make any more after the next one is complete.
The visuals are believable, they are like a painting come to life, and the CGI in this film ""while it can be iffy"", is quite a triumph, especially considering the scope of this film.
There are parts in this film that will have old time fans howling with glee. Did you not care for Jar Jar Binks? No worries, the Jedi are back in full force, and everything has been situated elegantly by Mr. Lucas.
C-3P0, and R2-D2 are back in full force for comic relief, and the movie has an overall tone of the previous trilogy. The action sequences in this movie are nothing short of massively well conceived pieces of art.
Many people will say the acting is not ""dead pan"", many people do not cherish the Star Wars universe as *my* generation, and will miss the many subtilties, and references. Like i said, this movie can not be critiqued from one viewing, it's much too large in scope.
Popcorn movie seekers should get joy from this film as well as it's quite an enjoyable film even if you are not well knowledged with the Star Wars universe, but fans are the ones who are truly going to benefit from this fantastic artistic vision known as Episode 2, and better yet as Star Wars.
Thank you Mr. Lucas for not letting us down, and keeping this fantastic franchise alive, and beating with more energy than all of the sellout franchises out there.
Go see this movie!",1023235200,,2283,4.39952718676123
1322301,5,B00003CXKT,"To start off, I didn't think Phantom Menace was that bad, I did when I first saw it, but on repeat viewings, I came to respect Lucas for making a kids movie and not some morbid R-rated spectacle all the grown-up Star Wars geeks want but won't admit to wanting.  With that said, Episode II is vastly different from Episode I, its darker, much more ambituous and downright intriguing and suspenseful the entire running time.  From the first explosion, this was a Star Wars movie like no other.  I think its the second best in the series behing Ep 4.  I'll start by addressing complaints other viewers had.  Obviously, the romance is going to be the sticking point for most, I thought it was actually rather well done, it was swift and to the point, I don't exactly know what people want.  Sex scenes, graphic sexual dialogue, poetry, they're not going to get it, Star Wars has never been about dialogue, its about grand sweeping gestures and getting a visual story that has dialogue, not the other way round.  Another complaint is Hayden Christensen, another thing I don't get, when he is describing how he slaughtered the Tusken Raiders, that was excellent, seriously excellent, that one scene was enough for me to see Darth Vader inside him.  Now onto the plot, the fact that Lucas fit this much info into this kind of timeframe is admirable enough, but to do it with this much flair and love for the universe is sensational.  You can tell he loves what he is doing, and so does ILM.  The Coruscant cityscape and chase are spectacles unlike any other in film, same with the Rain planet, and countless others.  There are some legitimate surprises, none as earthshattering as ""I am your father"" but they hold just as much weight for me.  The acting is also quite excellent, Ewan is falling into his role very well, and you can see the hermit he will become starting to emerge.  Natalie Portman handles the monotone duties of being Senator, and the carefree duties of being Anakins girl with equal amounts of talent.  Yoda isn't really an actor, but he is completely computer generated this time, and while I was hesitant to let go of puppet yoda, computer yoda is fabulous, and rules just as much as he always has, and the yoda fight is worth the price of admission alone.  If you hate this one, then you aren't going to like the next one either, because you'll never be happy with anything that isn't Empire Strikes back, and face it that ain't gonna happen with Episode 3.",1023148800,7,2472,4.586363636363636
1322302,5,B00003CXKT,"Six times and counting.  Yes I have seen this film six times so far and will probably see it again.  The fight scenes are breath taking and you got to love Count Doku.  This movie has it all, action, suspense, humour and yes even romance.  I love seeing Palpatine at work behind the scenes creating chaos in order to further his master plan.  If you now watched episode I and II back to back you will see how these two films are lincked.  Everything was stunning and I can't wait for episode III.  Thank the force there will be a series of books to move the story along during the next three years while fans. wait.  As for the bad reviews; folks, you do not, repeat do not go see a Star Wars film for great acting but for the action and story; its all about that.  As for the romance, was Han and Leia's much more beleivable?  Was the dialogue less wooden in the original trilogy?  I think not.  And do not forget, those films had different stories and circumstances.  This new trilogy is a whole new batch of plots and subplots and while it paves the way for the previous three films its a story that can stand on its own.  Its a pity that fans must bash a film to death because it lacked this or that; wasn't how it was done in the original trilogy.  that was a different time; this is now.  Star Wars is a six part epic and it delivers on every account.  I can't wait for the final installment to come out.  So simply go and enjoy it for waht it is; two plus hours of escape from the real world.  After all to be fair, each episode has its good and bad points.  on the whole though this saga is one hell of a story.  may it live forever.",1023148800,5,1641,4.09748427672956

If there's one thing we can all learn from these movies, is is that George Lucas cannot direct his actors. Why would the princess fall inlove with this obviously mean Anakin Skywalker? To give birth to luke of course, but that's beside the point. While the acting is still bad, there's less dialoge this time around and more action. I guess George learned something from Episode 1. Too bad he didn't learn enough because Jar-Jar is still here! sure it's only for a few scenes, but that's enough. I honestly think that the advances in CGI has destroyed the Star Wars universe, because it lets George do whatever he wants, unlike in the Original 3 which were FAR superior because he had to make do with what was around him. And for those Yoda fans, watch out! That animated frog (which is what he looks like when he fights) sure can jump!

In many respects, I was not disappointed by this latest installment in the Star Wars story.  The special effects, the non-stop action, and the all-around creativity of Lucas's characters are unsurpassed in the movie world.  You think you've seen it all when Lucas manages an even more fabulous landscape or grotesque character in a scene.  The threads of the previous 4 episodes are nicely brought together as we see Annekin's growing restlessness with the confines of the Jedi aprenticeship and his hatred of those who have wronged him.  We also see the background behind the bounty hunter Buba Fett's hatred of the Republic.  In general this was a well-done film and it sets us up nicely for the finale in Episode 3.  My main complaint is with the acting of the young lovers, who seem a bit uncomfortable with the wooden dialogue and the strange circumstances.  They do not ""carry"" the movie in the way that Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher did in Episodes 4, 5, and 6.

I remember when I was a kid seeing ""Empire"" for the first time and I felt the exact same way watching this.  When watching this movie, remember it is just a fantasy and try not to take it all too seriously.  This isn't Shakespeare what Lucas is trying to create here.

Well with Phantom we saw a great jedi in Qui-gon and a moderately interesting story.
But here we are with Clones and reading these reviews I just have to laugh! It was a very good movie for Star Wars! I went to the 12:01 showing and enjoyed it thoroughly. I thought the acting was Very good all around and Anakin especially revealed the tormented aspects of his personality.
Yes, the script had some atrocious lines and Padme changing her clothes every two minutes was REALLY annoying. But the romance was very eye opening. If only they could have left the meadow/Anakin riding a giant pig scene on the cutting room floor it would have been very tolerable. Seeing the clone wars begin was great as well as getting to see the emotional dynamics of Obi-wan and Anakin, Anakin and Padme. Really that was what was lost with Return and thank god it is finally back in the story. Hurray George for rediscovering the emotional center of Star Wars!

One just cannot compare the original Star Wars Trilogy with anything.  They were the pioneer films, they set the standard for what we see now and will always stand above the rest.  Any film compared to those are doomed to failure.  I went to see the latest installment of Star Wars with an open mind and no preconceived notions and THOROUGHLY ENJOYED it.  It had everything for everyone.  A little romance, a little adventure, a little mystery and a lot of action.  Admittedly, the love scenes were a little weak but when Jedis start whipping out their lightsabres, who cares.  The story gets very interesting and we begin to see the threads from all the previous Star Wars woven together.  Ewan McGregor is spectacular as Obiwan.  I didn't think he could live up to Sir Alec Guiness' but I was pleasantly surprised.  I was glad to see Christopher Lee cast as Count Dooku, he plays the part so elegantly.
I highly recommend this movie to everyone, except for the die-hard fanatics who are bent on criticizing everything because it doesn't fit their vision of what the movie should be.  This is George Lucas' vision and I'm glad he has shared it with us.  Go see it without preconceived ideas and expections.  It should not be compared with the original.

1322383,5,B00003CXKT,"George Lucas has completely redeemed himself from Episode I. Not that it was a bad picture, Episode I just was there to fill a void in the story. But this on the other hand, gets back to the purest form of the Star Wars saga. A truly magnificent film that ranks up there with The Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope.
Some people are bashing Episode II for its supposed 'bad and shallow' acting. Not true. Everyone in this film portrays their given roles perfectly, and if you need more evidence of this, read Episode II the book and see.
Everything about this works, and you can see the unfolding of the story before your eyes. Anakin's disobedience and favor to Chancellor Palpatine fits in perfectly with the latter movies. Padme Amidala (of course by the gorgeous Natalie Portman) shows how she will be Luke and Leia's mother and plays it perfectly.
Yes Jar-Jar is in this, but he is actually important and has no more then 5 minutes total of camera time, and most of that is not him even speaking thank goodness.
The bottom line - this is worth watching and certainly worth owning once the DVD comes out. Well acted and the last 45 mins are worth the ticket price alone. This fits in perfectly with the story and those who are bashing it don't realize everything that is going on.

1322384,2,B00003CXKT,"When all you can say to defend a Star Wars movie is that it was ""fun and entertaining"", then you've just argued against your point.  When it comes to the classic Star wars episodes, it was more than that.  There was a sense of meaning, of titanic battle and of romantisicm.  Episode 1 and 2 have none of this...essentially, they are merely vessels to set in place the events of George Lucas's original story.  Granted, both are blessed with amazing special effects (I loved the three colloseum monsters in Episode 2), but they are severely lacking in character intrigue.  The dialogue is wooden and fake, especially when the romance between Amidala and Anakin comes into play.  On the subject of Anakin, I was expecting this young  man's transformation to be quite different.  After all, he's on his way to becoming perhaps the most incredible villian in cinema history, so I'd like to think a sinisterly dark and cunning character wa forming there.  Instead, our young Padawan is just getting whinier and more annoying.
At least Episode One had an interesting and menacing, if vastly underused, villian in Darth Maul.  Episode Two doesn't even have that.  Darth Dooku is about as scary as his name implies, and Jomba Fett (or whatver the heck his name is) has ten times more action than his son Boba in the orginal Star wars but none of the menace.  Yoda was certainly the star of the film, most notabely for his impressive show with a lightsaber, but if you look closely you can see even he is dying to ask the question, ""what the hell is happening to star wars?""
Thankfully the ending of this film gives us a sliver of hope.  Darth Sideous has just gained control of the senate and The Empire is coming into it's element.  hopefully the next episode is better than this one.  Oh, who am I kidding, that's what I said after I saw Phantom menace.",1022976000,2,1847,4.605504587155964
1322385,3,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones (AOTC) is widely regarded by many to be better than The Phantom Menace (TPM), and while this may well be the case, I would only put it marginally higher than TPM in terms of entertainment value. AOTC has many more swashbuckling fights and enhanced special effects (although it is debatable if this makes the movie better), and the plot is a little tighter than TPM (not due to better directing but merely due to the fact that Episode 2 sets the big lay-up towards the Finale of the Prequels.)
As an addition to the original and unsurpassed trilogy, it still falls hopelessly short of the legend that we have come to know and love. Hayden Christensen is not ideal for the part, but is useful in portraying the arrogance and bitterness that hint towards his eventual struggle and defeat against the dark side. He never quite achieves a competent level of acting, and his accent definitely seems way off when considering his future evolution into good ol' Darthy. As for his romance with Portman, that has to rank as one of the most unappealing match of lead characters that I have seen in quite a while. Throughout the movie, he is constantly moody, dark and unfriendly, hardly ever displaying much affection nor sensitivity towards Portman, and only a blindfolded chimp could fall in love with him.
McGregor is made to look a lot older and wiser in this movie, and I tend to think he actually played his character pretty well, serving as a voice of reason and a counterbalance towards the impulsive and over-confident Anakin.
Portman is stunning as ever, and her beauty in some of the scenes shines through radiantly. She has a nice array of outfits and appearances, and was a sight for sore eyes in an otherwise average sci-fi movie.
The Jedi Knights are made to appear helpless and weak in the movie, and I can't help but feel that this does not do them justice at all. The Force seems to have left their sides, and they are no more than ordinary souls wielding light sabers. As for the fight involving Yoda, I was practically cringing because it took a revered Jedi Master and turned him into a comical bouncing Gremlin. How unfortunate.
Overall, the movie left a lot to be desired, in terms of acting, cast selection and plot. If I had it my way, I would actually wish for the Prequels to have never been created because they actually dampen the original franchise. However, that is obviously too late now, and I just hope Lucas can tie up all the loose ends in Episode III and make a movie truly worthy of all the legions of fans out there. We are your humble fans, and above all else, you owe it to us and to yourself to create a true Star Wars movie and not simply another commercial money-maker.

1322462,4,B00003CXKT,"The second installment of the new Star Wars trilogy focuses on Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and his descent into the Dark Side with the subplot of his blossoming relationship with Senator Amidala (Natalie Portman).

The movie is set years after the disappointing 'Episode I: The Phantom Menace' and the possibility of the romance between Skywalker and Amidala comes about when various assasination attempts are made against the senator, leading to the Jedi Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his apprentice Anakin being called in to foil the attempts and ultimately find out who is behind them.

'Attack Of The Clones'is a great improvement on 'The Phantom Menace' with a much better, action packed storyline and a greater use of CGI which enhances the battle scenes and gives the film an impressive and at times stunning look. However, there are a few things which let the movie down. Mainly the poor casting of relative unknown Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, his acting ability is not good enough for this huge role, seeming wooden at times, especially in his scenes of anger at Obi Wan and his love scenes with Amidala. Another sore point is the plot development rate. At times the film seems rushed, with Skywalker not being allowed to develop into as dark a character as is necessary for the audience to see that this cocky Jedi's apprentice will develop into the evil villian of the first trilogy, Darth Vader.

Overall 'Attack Of The Clones' is an enjoyable sci-fi action movie, considerably better than 'The Phantom Menace' and if director George Lucas can build on this then Episode III could be the best Star Wars movie yet.",1022976000,3,1645,4.952898550724638

There is no other reason for his apparance here...and I can 't imagine any reason why Hayden Christensen was cast in this very important role, unless he is the son of the producer or director...I wouldn't cast him as an extra...he is the worst actor I have ever seen..he talks like a dull drone..no expression whatsoever...I did not believe for one minute that he was in love with Padme..he was just reciting memorized dialogue....a couple of years ago, he co-starred with Joe Lando on a series called,  ""Higher Ground"" on the Pax Channel...I started watching it,  because Joe Lando  ( Sully on Dr Quinn, Medicine Woman ) is a major heart-throb of mine ....but as much as I love Joe Lando,  I could not continue watching this show because of Hayden Christensen 's bad acting !  He ruined the show for me,  and he almost ruined Attack of the Clones...but the film, for me, was saved by Ewan McGregor, who is fabulous as the maturing Obi Wan,  and by the Yodda - Dooku fight scene...seeing Yoda in action was awesome !

1322464,3,B00003CXKT,"George Lucas is NOT automatically the world's greatest expert on Star Wars.  This 2xTrilogy has taken on a life of its own and millions of fans around the world have strong opinions as to who these characters are and how they would respond in a given situation.  What makes or breaks a movie for me is whether or not the way the character acts is consistent with who that character is, and Darth Vader's character is as well-known as any of the Star Wars characters.
That being said, DARTH VADER would never have been a whiner.  His anger at Obi Wan would have been worked out in much more subtle ways (maybe ways that were beyond the ability of Hayden Christensen).
In addition, nobody that weak in character would have been chosen to become a Jedi Knight, nor would have Obi Wan ever chosen Anakin to train as a Jedi.
And, finally, Senator Padm Amidala, any woman of that quality, would never have fallen in love with an individual of such obviously weak character. The one scene where he blames Obi Wan and throws things is embarrassing ... how could Lucas have gotten this so wrong?",1022889600,6,1086,4.530612244897959

1322466,5,B00003CXKT,"Following the let down of Episode 1 its safe to say I was expecting more from this one. I was not disappointed.
Ok let's break this down.
Plot: The plot hung together solidly. We got to see Anakin breaking down inside, and his continuing love for Senator Amidala. (The romance was a fluke but we'll get to that later). It is ten years later and thousans of planets are separating from the Republic, and the Jedi are overwhelmed. Amidala has come to Corusant to protest against the Separatist movement. Meanwhile Sith lord Darth Sidius continues to plot, and it is growing ever more clear that Palpotine is up to something. Meanwhile Anakin must protect Padme, who is growing in love with. He is also succumbing to his dark side. Obi-Wan investigates plots to murder Amidala, and discovers that a clone army has been secretly built over a period of over ten years. (The order to build it was given by a dead Jedi Knight). With it the Republic will be prepared for war.
As said the plot was tight. The only hitch was R2D2's jets, which weren't in the original movies, but since that isn't essential to the main plot that shouldn't be a major concern.
Direction: Excellent. I was definetely held to my seat throughout.  A lot of suspense, though the romance was, for the most part, a dud. While it is annoying that Amidala must change outfits in almost every scene, (not to mention the fact that Lucas felt the need to creat the ultimate sci-fi freakshow) once again that is not a major problem. P.S. a major plus, far less Jar-Jar, though every scene he was in made me cringe
Acting: This depends on what actors we're talkingn about here of course. We have Christopher Lee (who also was the bad guy in Lord of the Rings last holiday season), who strikes again in a stirring role as Count Dooku (leader of the Separatist movement). This was a classic performance. We have Natalie Portman as a Senator Amidala who performed great as a politician and good as Anakin's love interest. I've always thought Ewan McGregor was the best actor in Episode 1 as Obi Wan, and with a more demanding role he still doesn't disappoint. Ian McDiarmind delivers another stunning performance in a long line of stunning performance as Palpotine and Darth Sidius. Frank Oz (as Yoda) is nowhere near as impressive as he was in the first four movies, but still delivers. Samuel L. Jackson has a good performance, especially considering how out of place he is in this movie. And then there's Hayden Christianson as Anakin. Like Natalie Portman he delivers in non-romance themes, but overall he could have done so much better.
Script: My god this was embarrassing. The dialogue was simply uncreative. It either used lines over and over again, or just used material that I could have written in 6th grade. Thank god for good actors, who could actually do something with this [stuff].
Special Effects: This is where the movie truly shines. The CGI is simply breathtaking with ship chases that make for wonderful eye candy. This is what George Lucas's dream was like, and no one should complain.
So in conclusion that is an excellent choice for your next movie trip. While in dialogue and a compelling romance it falls flat that is made up for in a magnificent plot of being on the brink of war and some excellent eye candy make up for those shortcomings. Far better than Phantom Menace, and should leave all Star Wars fan blown away, and we can expect Episode 3 to be even better. See it today!",1022889600,3,3463,4.640065146579804

I'm sure that a lot of people get disappointed because sequals are not like the original movie but they are not suppose to be.  I, myself, think that the original Star Wars was by far the best.  However, this movie does hold it's own.  Yes, Anakin whines in the movie and I'd like to slap him upside the head for that but that is part of the movie.  The special effects were great.  I looooved the scene of Yoda fighting with his light saber!
This movie answered some questions for me and it is part of the whole Star Wars story.
Go see it, enjoy it and have fun!!! :o)",1022889600,2,652,4.0546875
1322468,4,B00003CXKT,"This film is pretty cool.
...this one has a little more behind it.
That s not to say it does not have faults. All the Dialogue for Count Dooku was lame. He did not sound Machiavellian enough to me.
They could have done a lot more with such a good actor. Perhaps they will in the next one.
The romance sections where also lame, one minute amidala was treating anakin as if he didn't exist the next they where getting it on. They should also have been more graphic in the tusken raider camp scene and made the whole 'torment' scene afterwards more dark and less whiney. [The cut scenes to yoda frowning did add the correct poignance to the scene though]
And the Yoda fight scene. It was not as ridiculous .... ...All in all, this is a good film that will go into my DVD collection when it comes out. ...",1022889600,,801,4.241830065359477
1322469,2,B00003CXKT,"Is this boy-thing really going to grow up and be Darth Vader?  This whimsical, egotistical, vain, prone-to-emotional-outburst, vengeful, and poorly acted Anakin?  Where's the subtlety?  Would Yoda, Obi-Wan and all of the others really have allowed this child to continue to study the jedi arts, and is it possible for him to have completed 10 years of study and still be such a little menace?
The special effects were undoubtedly great, and the final fight scene with Yoda was brilliant fun, but the characters were one dimensional (if that), and there was no real emotion anywhere in the movie.  Anakin's relationship was laughable, and completely bereft of any true quality.
An entertaining movie for 10-year-old boys, but there isn't much to offer anyone else.",1022803200,,763,5.129032258064516
1322550,3,B00003CXKT,"Coming on the heels of the tremendously engaging (and unfairly maligned) Phantom Menace, this film is a letdown.  The movie has fantastic painterly backgrounds, but like most computer-generated animation they look somewhat fake.  The special effects are elaborate, but Lucas was determined to cram so much on the screen during the action sequences that it almost gives you a headache.  Note to Lucas: sometimes less is more.  I was not so much enthralled as just worn down by the barage of digital effects.
The movie does a good job filling in the back-story to the trilogy that began with Star Wars, but the script lacks heart.  The romance between Anakin and Amidala is inert, and seems even more implausible in light of the fact that he appears to have aged about 15 years since the Phantom Menace while she looks exactly the same.  The scene in which Anakin's mother dies is contrived and melodramatic, and the film's disjointed narrative never fleshes things out well enough to make us care about the characters.
Another problem is that the script often does not make sense.  For instance, who would make a massive army of clones under contract and not stay in touch with the people who placed the order for years at a time?  What's the deal with Yoda, who usually goes limping breathlessly around with a cane but can spring into action as the greatest fighter of the jedi knights?  Where did Senator Amidala's pin come from that enabled her to pick her handcuffs?  Why is Senator Amidala, as one of over a thousand senators, so important that the dark forces keep trying to assassinate her?  If Jango Fett is such a super-killer that they would want to make an entire army of his clones, then why is he killed so quickly and easily in this movie in the arena scene?
The film too often feels stale.  Almost every scene seems to have come from previous sci-fi films (like the taxicab sequence in the Fifth Element) or previous epics (like the arena scenes in Spartacus).  The large battle scenes involving strange, computer-generated creatures bear an unfortunate resemblance to the tedious battles in Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.  It even seems as if Lucas is recycling his own ideas.  The light-saber fights still have a certain pizzazz, but we first saw those over twenty years ago, and in any case the climactic light-saber fight with Darth Maul in the Phantom Menace was much more suspenseful.  The conveyer belt scene in this movie is a rehash of the famous scene in The Temple of Doom which Lucas co-produced.
The dialog is often stilted, making it hard for the actors to breathe life into the characters.  Samuel L. Jackson chewed up the scenery in Shaft, but his performance here is lifeless.  Hayden Christensen is good as Anakin (although some of his lines were too bad to be effectively delivered), showing the arrogance and rage building in the young jedi knight soon to become Darth Vader, and Christopher Lee has a nice menace as Count Dooku.  Natalie Portman is fine but doesn't sparkle as in the Phantom Menace.  As for Yoda, he remains the most annoying character in the Star Wars universe -- an ugly little toy with the voice of Marge Simpson spouting banalities wrapped as profundities -- and unfortunately he gets plenty of screen time here.
This is not a bad film.  In fact, I'd say that it is about average for a science fiction movie, but it's the worst of the Star Wars series so far.  Where's the magic?  Where's the thrill?  Where's the fun?",1022803200,,3490,4.71169686985173
1322551,4,B00003CXKT,"""Star Wars Episode II"" Wasn't bad, I really like all the parts with Obi-Wan, but all the ""romance"" got pretty boring and repetitive. Christensen can't really portray any emotions very well except anger.
Yes the special effects were a-mazing but that doesn't make a movie. The plot wasn't overly spectacular and I think Frank Dicaro described it best as ""C-Span with lasers.""
I really miss Luke Han and Leia, you know, characters you immediately like, that are intelligent and that you can relate to. There really aren't any characters like this in ""Attack of the Clones,"" except maybe... no, no not him either. Of course then there was the acting, most of it was horrible (except when Anakin gets angry, like I said before Christensen does that pretty well) the only good actors were Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee and of course Frank Oz the rest deserve a D+.
Now dispite some of the things I complained about before I will say the movie was pretty entertaining, despite the fact it lacked any kewl dialogue, you know like ""Wars not make one great."" And the villain wasn't nearly as kewl as Vader, even though it was Christopher Lee. But any way, this one was a lot closer to the original trilogy and had quite a few good scenes, I especially like the chase through Curocant (or however you spell it) even though the city seamed to be a visual copy of ""Blade Runner"" (which was a very good science fiction movie) The whole thing with Obi-Wan investigating the assassination attempts was pretty cool, I did like that part, as well as the parts with Jango Fett. And of course then there was the climactic battle. ""Eat my Force Count Dooku!""
All in all the movie wasn't TOO shabby, it was probably worthy of purchasing once it comes out on DVD, and I have a lot of respect for Mr. Lucas, but I do miss the philosophical aspects of episodes IV-VI.",1022803200,,1848,4.6030303030303035
1322552,5,B00003CXKT,"For decades the Clone Wars, first mentioned by Princess Leia in Episode IV, have been a mythical part of the Star Wars saga, integral in some ill-defined way to the story's continuity but shrouded in mystery and rumor.  At last, George Lucas has revealed how the Clone Wars began, and how perhaps they sowed the bitter seeds for the Empire itself.
Episode II:  Attack of the Clones is near-flawless escapist moviemaking.  Perhaps the most breathtaking SFX extravaganza ever (highlights include Obi-Wan's rain-cloaked duel with Jango Fett; the whole Jedi Order hopelessly surrounded and outgunned by a relentless droid army, but fighting on anyway; and a series of brilliant lightsaber duels between Darth Tyrannus, Obi-Wan, Ankakin Skywalker, and Yoda himself), Attack of the Clones is reinforced by capable performances from a solid cast.  Hayden Christensen conveys exactly the right touches of conflicting emotions as the confused and frustrated Anakin inching ever more slowly toward the Dark Side, and Natalie Portman handles the role of a sober politician turned inside-out by unexpected love with cool aplomb.  The sudden affair the two find themselves drawn into is made believable by the actors' commendable sincerity.  But the two stand-out performers are Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi and grizzled Christopher Lee as Darth Tyrannus.  McGregor clearly has a firm awareness of Alec Guiness's earlier performance and knows how to match it, while Lee's Tyrannus is perhaps the most diabolical Dark Jedi yet.  The evil he brought to the climactic lightsaber clash was nearly palpable even through the movie screen.
Long-time Star Wars devotees should have no trouble enjoying this latest entry in the great space opera, while newcomers to the ways of the Force should only find their appetites whetted for more.  A non-stop intergalactic joyride of the highest caliber, Attack of the Clones is everything anyone could have asked for...and more.",1022803200,2,1952,5.3322475570032575
1322553,5,B00003CXKT,"This was a good movie. It's that simple. I don't watch a lot of movies, and I am not a Star Wars geek, (or at least, I've never owned a Vader mask) but thanks to my older brother I've been hooked on the good-over-evil-ness and almost spirituality of the Star Wars movies since the first trilogy. Anybody who's not a demanding hard-core fan but appreciates the kind of escape and innocent appeal of the first few movies should see this one. As for its criticisms, the love story to me was satisfying, and honestly was fitting with the fairytale quality of all the Star Wars' movies. The chase scenes were cool, the fight scenes were as good as ever, the scenery badly made me want to be there, and Yoda was freaking awesome.

The book was much better at telling the story - the romantic part was explained much better, you got to see it progress, and it became much more believable.  Granted, the special effects were great, but that's a given - would only be worth mentioning if they weren't.  The movie only did a superficial job of telling what was happening.  As usual, Lucas did his normal sub-par job of writing dialogue, and the same woodenness comes across in the actors that was present in episode I.  Still a good flick, I'm a huge star wars fan, but I would've really been disappointed had I not read the book before seeing the movie.  If you're a fan of the series, and want to know what really is happening in Episode II, buy the book - you won't be disappointed.",1022803200,,811,4.373333333333333
1322556,3,B00003CXKT,"I never write reviews, ..., I just had to get my two cents in... I am 26 and I have seen all five of the Star Wars movies. I saw Attack of the Clones twice. I have enjoyed Hayden Chistianson in ""Life as a House"" and I love Natalie Portman, Christopher Lee (who doesn't) and Ewen McGregor. I find that all of the actors are quite capable of giving brillaint performances. I think the problem lies in the writing, direction, and too much CGI. Remember that this is a series. How can you stray so far from where you start without inciting mixed feelings? We all know the story by now. So why did the Romance have to be so forced? The plots were so separated that at times I felt like I was watching two movies and the Obi Wan plot was what I wanted more of. I didn't care for the characters like you are supposed to in a good movie. The scenery was fanstastic, but it left nothing to the imagination. My mind was shut down and my jaw was dropped, and yes, I was entertained, but I left feeling cheated. I believe that Mr. Lucas raised our expectations. After The Phantom Menace (which I enjoyed as I sat there but never really care to see again)we all were waiting to see what was next. It was evident that he would have to do better. We were forgiving and we will be again. But please get a better script and give the actors a little more room to actually act. Let the characters drive Episode Three instead of the CGI. CGI makes for a great cartoon or music video, but when you promise drama and a story, let the characters live it for us. And please please please stop C3P0 from saying any more of those horrible one liners ""It's a real drag"" ruined my favorite part of the movie.
So what did I like? Obi Wan was good. All of the bad guys were my favorites, though. And the Yoda scene did give me chills (brief as it was). Jengo Fett was also a great surprise. I hope that the characters become three dimensional in the next installment. You can put a one dimensional comic book down, but you still have to sit through a two and a half hour one dimensional movie.
I will always love Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi, so I hope for the best with Episode Three since it is the doorway to those movies as well as George Lucas' last chance to make this series what it has promised to be since the beginning...the best sci-fi adventure of all time.",1022716800,,2369,4.208791208791209
1322557,1,B00003CXKT,"When I heard people talking about how cool this movie was, I couldn't wait to see it. ...The plot was horrible, the actors were cardboard, and for an action movie, it had about 20 minutes of real action. After Episode 1, I didn't think it could get much worse. This movie cam dangerously close to proving me wrong.",1022716800,3,314,4.431034482758621
1322558,1,B00003CXKT,"So this is supposed to be a darker Star Wars?  The installment when Anakin Skywalker clings onto the Dark Side, and is beyond the reach of the righteous Jedi path?  If so, then Episode II: Attack of The Clones founders in ways unimaginable.  In one sentence the film can be described as snowed under stomach-turning acting, a rushed script, and being dreadfully boring and utterly predictable.  Episode II is the harbinger of the destruction of the Star Wars franchise.  I'm not a fan of the trilogy, regarding Return of the Jedi somewhat childish with the Ewoks, but embracing The Empire Strikes Back as an epic piece of Sci-Fi and Fantasy grandeur.  But as for Attack of The Clones, as unbelievable as it may sound, Episode I is exempted as the worst Star Wars, it is now --you guessed it -- Episode II.
Whereas Episode 1 supported a thrilling climax of four synchronized battles, Attack of Clones lacks even that and everything else we would expect from movies.  First off, the problem with the episodes progressing backwards is audiences already recognize the fate of the cast.  When in ominous plight, Anakin, Amidala, and Obi Won, regardless of anything, will overcome their struggles.  Because we can automatically tell their fate, the suspense level is at a zero.  Why couldn't Lucas slot in another absorbing character like Darth Maul, but make him a hero, place him in the spotlight, provide an adequate background, let the audience be attached to him, and needless to say make him sacrifice his life for the main heroes.  Incorporate something like that and the audiences who have given a damn about this derisory movie.  As 3PO, R2D2, and the rest of the hero bandwagon go off to set things right, the outcome of their grave struggles are obvious.
To say Episode II is the darker breed of the series is an overstatement.  Return of the Jedi was darker than this (Luke nearly giving in to the Dark Side as he hammers his lightsaber on his father's).  Luke was --key word-- believable.  Anakin in Episode II is terribly annoying and powerless on set.  If you can define Anakin simply getting angry at Amidala and breaking down as a  ""darker"" Star Wars, then I might as well jump off a cliff.  One of the most important scenes we should have seen was when Anakin slaughters an entire tribe of creatures who enslaved his deceased mother.  That was a vital scene, the core why Anakin gives into the Dark Side, and we aren't even allowed to see what transpired, or how he annihilated them?  We only see Anakin slay two guards after the death of his mother and then the scene ends.  Later,  Anakin reveals to Amidala what he did to the tribe, savagely killing their women and children.  That is truly sad that Lucas cannot even follow the book on how movies are to be executed.  Here is the first rule after reading a bunch of how to develop screenplays books, movies are meant to be visual, NOT RETOLD BY WORDS.
The entire cast lacks the essence of human relationship.  Emotional impact is nowhere to be found as the camera switches from person to person, and never providing deep characterizations.  As you may have already conjectured, my biggest beef with the movie is the actor who plays Anakin.  He isn't convincing and doesn't even seem like he is being drawn to the Dark Side.  All he does is bleat about how all his problems are connected to Obi Won's method of training.  In years of training as a Jedi , he acts like a rich yuppie who perceives himself as ""the best.""  Gimme a break Lucas, what's up with this movie.  Is this how yuppies react when they don't have enough money to get what their eyes are glued to?  The acting and scripting might as well have been deleted.  Episode II should have been an opera,  because that is all Episode II is, eye-candy packed with a musical score.  Simply style over substance.
And yes, only Watto bears genuine characterization.  We seem him sordid, rundown with flies buzzing around him, and he is crestfallen when he realizes his inability to fix his droid.  Most importantly the audience can relate to him, because we all failed sometime in our lifetime.  Might as well hand him the Oscar for Best Acting in Episode II, despite the fact that HE IS COMPUTER GENERATED.
The masses enjoyed it, and for those who take pleasure in a movie due to its aptitude of its writing, dialogue, and acting, then avoid paying for high-priced Episode II tickets.  Hell, even the visuals aren't even that impressive, they are so cartoony and wacky that the PS2 outperforms this million-dollar construction.  Remember the formation found in the old trilogy of Storm Troopers?  Over here, we have computer generated, Clones gearing in formation, and boy it looks so cheesy and artificial.  Lastly, when Lucas is writing his screenplays where does he get the inspiration for the names of his characters?  For instance Mr. Fisto.  Next, Count Dooku?  I cannot imagine a hero screaming his name in defiance and rushing at him with a lightsaber.  Try it, scream it as if he severed your arm like he did with Anakin, sounds pathetic, right?  Another proof of style over substance is the war scenes.  The universe of Star Wars is in a technically advance stage and who charges to meet army against army with the creation of absolute firepower?  I know this scene was strictly meant to knock out our senses and do nothing for the plot or its characters.
One good thing about Episode II: Attack of the Clones was the concluding credits.

Sure, the special effects are wonderful, but when will Hollywood learn that it's the story that impresses sci-fi fans, and the effects are just icing on the cake.
They say you can't capture lightning in a bottle twice.  That's not true, if you stick to what worked the first time.  Star Trek is a good example.  Both the old and Next Gen series are fine examples of sci-fi, despite the terrible special effects in the original series.
Episodes IV and V worked because they told a simple story of good vs. evil.  Now the story is lost among numerous plot twists and endless details.  You can have a movie that uses expository dialogue to great effect, or you can have an action movie.  You can't have both.  Star Wars doesn't need to be this complicated.

So why do does Lucas have to shove their budding relationship in our face and down our throat?  It lingers on for, what seems like, an eternity.  And the whole time it's plaqued with a horrible script and bad acting.  It reminds me of Pearl Harbor(which was worse).  The plot is almost incomprehensible.  You never really find out why someone was trying to asassinate the Queen.  It was probably Natalie Portman's acting instructor.  On the positive side, I did like Ben Kenobi, Jango Fett and Lord Tryrannus. Christopher Lee is always a great villain.  And, of course, the special effects are top of the line.  But that is not enough to save this film.  I don't know what happened to Lucas, but I think he waited too long to make his recent films.  These last two Star Wars movies just don't measure up to the originals.  It's too bad, because I believe Lucas is capable of much more. ...",1022630400,10,1315,4.575107296137339
1322634,5,B00003CXKT,"I think it's a sad statement on the state of our society that some people just don't get it. And, even worse, it's the ""die-hard"" fans that are the worst offenders. ""Star Wars Episode 2:Attack of the Clones"" is everything that I expected and more. It is a fun and engaging adventure with amazing special effects, fun, humor, and a twisting plot filled with intrigue and romance.
The problem you see here is not with the film, but with that particular faction of fandom who feels that they know the Star Wars franchise better than it's creator. Sci-fi has all of a sudden become something that must be ""serious, important, and dark"". Star Wars has NEVER been any of these things. It's a movie for teens and pre-teens...and it always has been.
What you're listening to when you read negative reviews of ""Attack of the Clones"" are people who have forgotten what these movies are meant to be. These people want to see 2 hours of constant laser battles and light saber duels with some shakespearian dialogue thrown in. It's the same kinda garbage that's ruined Star Trek fandom: selfish, immature fans that believe the shows should meet THEIR needs and THEIR expectations. I'm sorry to say, but as a crowd-pleaser...this film works! I've seen it twice and both times I heard people buzzing about how much fun it was after we got out of the theater. I took my girlfriend (who hates sci-fi type stuff) to see it and she LOVED it.
You've got to remember that this movie is made for regular PEOPLE to watch, not necessarily the hard-core Star Wars geek. It's meant to be fun, campy, and ""Buck Rogers-esque"". It's a huge budget kid's adventure / fantasy. In this sense, it succeeds and exceeds on all levels.
The Padme / Anikin romance is meant to seem a bit forced. He's more an obsessive than genuinely in love. She is confused and scared. Also, you have to remember that this is something that is destined to happen, so thier ""falling in love too quickly"" is not the case. It's not a natural event, and thus plays out as such.
Ewan McGreggor IS Obi-Wan Kenobi. It's amazing how good he is in this film. It's increadibly clear how much he's prepared for the role and he is excellent as the adventurous yet conservative Jedi Master.
Hayden Christiansen is nothing short of brilliant, despite what you've heard. He's bratty, whiny, and immature. He's NOT a hero. He's been manipulated from day one by Palpatine (see the scenes in the end of Ep 1 and in the beginning of Ep 2, with Anikin thinking the evil one for his constant ""guidance""). People expecting him to be a Luke Skywalker type are way off. Hayden does an excellent job of balancing an evil, menacing presence with the happy, generous boy he used to be before he was corrupted. I really got a sense of evil and menace from him...of tremendous power straining to be unleashed, and of absolute power corrupting absolutely. He was perfect for what he was supposed to do.
Jango and Bobba Fett are fun and it was an interesting tie-in to the original trilogy to see that this is the evolution of the fabled ""clones"". The space-chase in the asteroid belt is astonishing and the fights with Jango vs. Kenobi and vs. Mace Windu are really cool.
Count Dooku is a much more intellecutal and evil villan than we have seen. He is a fantastic manipulator, and he's obviously increadibly powerful, having been Yoda's apprentice and Qui-Gon's mentor. He is not as mysterious or menacing as Darth Maul was, nor is the lightsaber duel as engaging as the Maul fight in Ep 1, but Yoda coming out to fight was an absolute riot.
The plot is great also. I don't know if people are just missing it or what. The whole idea of lies, deceit, and treachery being the way of the Dark Side is demonstrated perfectly here. You can see that the entire Clone Wars, Separatist Movement, and Naboo blockade (from ep 1) are all carefully contrived schemes of the dark lord to gain power and take control of the republic.
It's a masterfully crafted, fun, and amazing adventure. And that's all we should ever ask of Star Wars. If everyone would just relax and remember how to be a kid again instead of having impossibly high expectations that will NEVER be met, you may all live happier lives.",1022630400,16,4207,4.595744680851064
1322635,4,B00003CXKT,"At last check, there were hundreds of reviews for this movie on Amazon.com (certain to swell to thousands), so I won't bore you with plot points. The bottom line? Steven Spielberg had it right: In my view, this is the best ""Star Wars"" movie since ""Empire Strikes Back."" Let me explain why. The action sequences are top-notch, and when I say ""top-notch,"" I absolutely mean it. Remember when you were disappointed by the special effects in ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace""? Well, this movie is visually dazzling, a true watermark for effects work. The sound is ear-popping. George Lucas's genius is not in his script-writing or directing skills, but in his extraordinary vision and creativity. Who else could craft a 2-hour-plus epic that encompasses five planets, an enormous D-Day battle between two machine armies, and more stunning visuals than the first entire ""Star Wars"" trilogy? George Lucas, that's who. Sure, the script falls short of ""Out of Africa,"" and the budding romance between Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) could use some work. But this is a ""Star Wars"" movie. Raise your hand if you saw ""Return of the Jedi"" just so that you could feel the love between Han Solo and Princess Leia? Forget about mythology and good vs. evil for a second. The ""Star Wars"" movies are memorable for many fans primarily because of their ""coolness."" There are scenes in this movie that are so hip and intense that you almost fall out of your seat. The last forty minutes of this movie present some of the best action in the entire ""Star Wars"" franchise. Okay, okay, I know I've gotten a little heated, but ""Star Wars"" is a passionate subject. Forget about what the critics are saying -- see this movie for yourself. Or, when it arrives on DVD, buy it. Watch it with your closest friends. And, by God, get those little-kid cravings out.",1022630400,3,1880,4.823529411764706
1322636,4,B00003CXKT,"A very enjoyable show.... it really gives the background for the episodes which follow.  You can see the foundation for Princess Leia and Luke, the history of the Jedis and how they work, why Darth moved to the darkside, who the Emperor was, how R2-D2 and his buddy came to Luke's family... just so much.  The film really does a good job of introducing all the episodes that follow.  The only thing I was a bit turned off by was what I thought was an excessive use of special effects... I almost had the feeling at times that I was watching a cartoon.  Even so, I'd recommend that if you liked the first three episodes, you should see this one.",1022630400,2,644,4.341666666666667
1322637,1,B00003CXKT,"I don't expect this review to be some shining gem of insight buried in a sea of frantic praise, so I'm expecting to get a high number of ""unhelpful"" votes. However, if you are a Luke fan, you may want to read on.
It's too narrow-minded to categorize people, because that often leads to problems, but there are generally two areas of Star Wars fandom: Luke fans and Yoda fans. Luke fans enjoyed the original trilogy for the likeable characters, the intriguing storylines, and the dialogue that included great wit and quotable tidbits. Yoda fans enjoyed the flashy lights and action scenes as well as the more technological aspects of the movie - Yoda fans are the ones who will learn and recite the names of the various spacecrafts and aliens in the story, because to Yoda fans, the true greatness of the original trilogy wasn't in the movies, but in the mythology behind them.
Far be it from me to criticize anybody from either school of thought, but I feel it is important to note the differences between these groups. I am a Luke fan, and that is why I couldn't stand Episode II. However, Yoda fans love it.
My criticisms all derive from the creative aspects from the movie. The dialogue, which was once so great, is now tired and bland, relying on cheap puns or dumb comments. Instead of Han Solo's pithy remarks, we get a close-up of Obi-wan stating the overly obvious ""This is not good."" This turns out to be a huge problem, as nearly every line in Episode II is poorly written, even when it seems impossible. Somehow, George Lucas even managed to mess up lines like, ""How are you?""
The poor dialogue is made worse by unbearable acting. I can only assume that Hayden Christensen was some poor orphan that Lucas felt sorry for, because I don't see any other way such an untalented, ear-piercingly bad actor could get this part. He has no chemisty with Natlie Portman, or Ewan McGregor (Who apparently had a lobotomy since Episode I and can't even match his acting from THAT movie).
Then we look at the characters in this movie. I recall a time when I was young and I saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time, and Darth Vader was such a bad-*ss villain. He was spooky, surreal, impressive. Luke was admirable, likeable, and a great hero. Han Solo, of course, was the smooth-talking space cowboy. Yoda had pearls of wisdom. Leia was beautiful, but not a wimp. Lando, despite having a brief role, still carried a sense of nobility. Yet in Episode II, we don't even get watered-down versions of these characters.
Which brings me to Yoda. There's a lot of buzz about Yoda's role in this one, and why not? Yoda fans love Yoda, obviously; he is the epitome of what they want. And in this movie, he is especially the epitome of what Yoda fans want. Of course, you'll like it if that's what you want - and feel free to watch.
However, if you aren't deceived by the action scenes and special effects (which are very good, I admit), then you will see that this is a truly bad movie at heart. Luke fans will have to just re-watch their copies of the original trilogy, I suppose...
...and please, please, PLEASE, Mr. Lucas - send your cast back to acting classes.",1022544000,37,3148,4.524561403508772
1322638,3,B00003CXKT,"This was a big disappointment for both me and my husband. We have been Star Wars fans since the beginning and were very excited about this new release. My husband was fighting to stay awake during most of the movie, and I was wondering if Kevin Costner helped edit this film. The only saving grace was the special effects at the very end of the movie.
I wish we had saved our money and gone to see Lord of the Rings at the dollar movies instead of wasting money on what should have been a wait for video movie.
This one lacked any of the coolness and heart that Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi have. Interesting that those are the two most popular Star Wars movies and George Lucas had nothing to do with directing them.
We definately won't make the same mistake again; we won't see the final prequal in the theater. Definately a wait for video movie.",1022544000,3,862,4.327160493827161

I really enyoy the film, not by the monstrous millionaire propaganda it because the movie follows very well the Lucas intentions to guide us to the most important climatic event, the transformation of Darth Vader.

1322726,4,B00003CXKT,"Where to start?  The plot?  First things first - Jar Jar returns, but his screen time is mercifully short.  Darth Maul isn't back.  And, for those who haven't heard this a thousand times already, for its flaws, it still beats ""Phantom Menace"".
The plot - it's been a decade since the events in ""Phantom"".  The fractious intergalactic republic under Chancellor Palpatine is already coming apart at the seams.  To keep the republic united, Palpatine seeks both emergency powers from the senate and its consent to form a massive army -  the Jedi Knights is stretched too thin.  On the republic's capitol of Coruscant, former Queen (now Senator) Amidala arrives to cast her vote on the subject of the grand army, but finds herself targeted.  Assigned to guard her are Obi Wan Kenobi, now a Jedi Master, and Anakin Skywalker.  A decade older, ""Ani"" is on the verge of becoming a master, but he's too arrogant and impulsive, and everybody reminds him that he's no Jedi yet.  Complicating things for Ani are fears for his mother's safety and that he's heartsick for Amidala (who is now shorter than he is).  When another assassination attempt is barely thwarted - following a high-speed chase through the flying streets of Coruscant - the Jedi council split the two up, sending Ani to guard Amidala as she returns home to Naboo while Kenobi tracks down the assassin.  While Skywalker and Amidala explore their deepening feelings for each other, Kenobi follows the trail first to the watery world of Kamino (whose buildings and inhabitants seem strangely reminiscent of those in ""The Abyss"") and then to the fiery desert world of Genosis.  On Kamino, Kenobi tangles with the armored warrior and bounty hunter Jengo Fett, and we meet the clone Fett adopts - a young boy named Boba.  We soon also meet Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), a renegade Jedi who leads the secessionist forces, but warns Kenobi of a threat even greater than himself. By then, Ani has given into temptation (no, not that temptation) he abandons Naboo and heads off to Tatooine to rescue his mom.  When the rescue doesn't turn out right, and in a painfully abbreviated scene, Ani gives into his feelings and lashes out.  Skywalker hasn't enough time to grieve or reveal the depths of his emotional torment before Amidala ""convinces"" him to help her rescue the captured Kenobi on Genosis - which is revealed to be a house a huge warrior-droid factory, seething with welding machines and conveyor belts (ala ""The Temple of Doom"".)  When the rescue attempt ends in failure, an army of Jedi materialize out of nowhere, fighting an army of warrior droids with their lightsabers.
I love Star Wars, so I'll end on a higher note, but start on ""What doesn't work"" - while fewer of the offensive stereotyped characters get meaningful screen time, Watto is back in a short scene in which his stereotype seems even more overt than in ""Phantom"".  The main characters seem more flesh & blood than they did in ""Phantom"", but not by much.  The lines seem as stilted and leaden as ever, not helped by the predominance of English accents, but the script compensates by giving the characters relationships (even Jango Fett is somebody's father figure; you can almost imagine him giving bounty-hunting lessons to the young boy who will put Harrison Ford on ice).  Too many characters do little more than appear (like Jimmy Smits as Bale Organa, or the young teens who will grow up to adopt Ani's son; the republican archivist who appears in one simple scene early on has a simple line, but she delivers it better then Dooku's allies.  I kept wishing for her to turn into a Sith Lord).  There are plenty of ""zoom scenes"" (like the podracing in ""Phantom""; here it's the car chase thruough the skies of Coruscant, which looks like Times Square, the Ginza District and LA from Blade Runner, followed up by a chase through an Asteroid belt).  Too much of ""Attack"" relies on speed - reducing the heroes to CGI cartoons played back at high speed.  Then comes the mindbending epic of climaxes - when, atlast, the Jedi Army finally reveals itself to us: if you've ever seen ""Henry the Fifth"", imagine Agincourt fought with legions of lightsabers instead of long swords.  But, just when it looks like the Jedis will have their moment - the clones appear, and the movie degenerates into another CGI battle - with the valiant Jedi's forced to give the stage over to the faceless clones who seem less animated than the Gungans.  C3P0 is back - mostly for ill-timed comic relief (during the onslaught of the Jedi army).
Still, it's Star Wars, and the script reaches for emotional depths not even imagined in ""Phantom"" with luscious effects and sounds, cluing us in that something big is on the way as ""Phantom"" never could.",1022544000,2,4750,4.782129742962057
1322727,5,B00003CXKT,"""Star Wars Episode II:  Attack of the Clones"" is exactly what the doctor ordered.  Easily ranking right up there with the original movies, Episode II has just the right amounts of everything Star Wars fans have been looking for:  TONS of action, cool weapons, cool vehicles and stunning landscapes and a strong storyline.
THE STORY:
Senator Padme Amidala's life is threatened by an assassination plot due to her role in pushing through a Senate bill to authorize the formation of a Grand Army of the Republic.  Obi-Wan Kenobi is assigned to uncover who is behind the assassination plot (which takes him throughout the universe) while Anakin Skywalker is assigned to protect the Senator (and former Queen), which leads to the love story for this particular episode.
Tons of foreshadowing of things to come as Anakin has tons of issues to deal with.  Too bad there weren't any anger management classes back in the days of the Republic.  We're also introduced to a few characters who return in the ""later"" episodes.
COOL THINGS:
Again, the foreshadowing stuff is just awesome.  The action and car space-age technology scenes drive this movie.  In no particular order, here are my favorite scenes of the movie:
1. The last half-hour or so as the massed Jedi take on the bad guys.
2. YODA IN BATTLE!!! (short scene, but WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY cool)
3. Jango Fett versus the Jedi
4. Anakin and Padme in the droid factory
5. Yoda training padwan learners.
6. Count Dooku puts Darth Maul to shame.
7. Darth Sidius' pretty ingenius, yet sinister plan.
8. The millions and millions of ""Clone Troopers.""
Overall, this is a GREAT edition to the franchise and should erase any bad taste that some may have had as a result of Phantom Menance.  The action is 10X more intense and the story, while a little confusing because of its depth is a LOT more enthralling.
Can't wait for Episode III

1322728,5,B00003CXKT,i thought this was going 2 be a dumb boy movie but it wasn't. star wars episode 2 attack of the clones was really good. I LIKE JAR JAR ...,1022544000,,138,3.6333333333333333
1322729,3,B00003CXKT,"Here we go again.
Just how much of a mess can you make of a movie with a couple of hundred million dollars?  A big one.  Thankfully, Attack of the Clones is head and shoulders above such shlock as Stargate, Independence Day, Mission to Mars, and Planet of the Apes.  In other words, it isn't idiotic.  It's also better than The Phantom Menace, which isn't much of a compliment, I know, but there you have it.
But there is a heck of a lot wrong with this movie, nonetheless.  First, it is, well, boring.  Not as boring as Phantom, but enough so that you start wondering what you're going to be doing after the film--about ten minutes into it.  You can almost feel  your wrist watch being drawn to your face.
Second, the acting is pretty poor.  The teenage Anakin is a pouty, simpering, overacter.  You just wanna slap him when he starts whining about being misunderstood and all that.  He's almost as bad as the actor who played Anakin in The Phantom Menace.  Okay.  Nobody is that bad.  But he still is a total miscast as the future Dark Lord.  He must be one of George Lucas' relatives.  Has to be.  Also making a poor showing is Natalie Portman.  There is nothing to her performance.  She phoned it in.
Third, there is the script.  God, don't they teach screenwriters how to write dialogue?  Those romantic musings between Anakin and Padme are so syrupy, so fake, so tone deaf--puke city, in other words.  It's like some geek who couldn't even get the nerve to ask a girl out, let alone romance her, came up with a geek-fantasy version of what young lovers--or soon-to-be-lovers--might say to each other.  Wait a minute!  Maybe that's it!  Have you seen pictures of George Lucas as a teen?  If he ever spoke to a girl, let alone asked one out, I'd eat my hat.
Fourth, the special effects have only a little magic.  Yoda, entirely digital, is entirely unconvincing, looking like Shrek wandering around a live action flick.  And his dialogue, the totally cliched grammatical mashings included, sound silly.  Has Frank Oz totally lost it, too?  He can barely pull off the lines he's been given, most of which are poor.
Fifth, Jar Jar Binks.  He's even worse than in the last episode.  It makes you cringe every time he speaks.  Uggh. If you didn't think he was a sick racial stereotype the first time around, just watch this film.  You'll be convinced.  I promise.  ""Ol' Massa Lucas, heesa been good to meesa.""  It's is awful, and it's unimaginable that anyone with a single thread of decency wouldn't leave those scenes on the cutting room floor.
So, there you have it.  I'm giving it a three to save room for the really awful movies.  This isn't awful, but there's not much of a story (more of a documentary), nothing to get your sense of adventure engaged, and, worst of all, it bores.  Some of the scenery is pretty, but so what?  And in an interview before the release, an NPR reporter asked Lucas if there was a danger of the digital arts supplanting true, imaginative story-telling.  He didn't get it.  He missed the point.  He started rambling about how digital is just another medium.  Did he not listen to the question?  Did he hear only what he wanted to hear?  This movie, I believe, answers a resounding, ""Yes,"" to both of those questions.",1022544000,2,3251,4.544982698961937
1322730,3,B00003CXKT,"I suppose that it could have been worse...but then, it could also have been better...A lot better.
The problem with George Lucas is that he only listens to George Lucas.  Apparently no one around him is willing (or able) to stand toe-to-toe with him and point out obvious things like:
1) You have no usable script,
2) You should hire qualified actors (ala Alec Guiness in the original)and pay them accordingly,
3) Special effects alone does not a good movie make (uh-oh I'm sounding like Yoda, or is it Jar Jar?)
4) A 2 foot tall green Keebler Elf type character looks silly as a Samurai ninja type jedi fighter
5) You have no usable script (but then I repeat myself...)
When Mr. Lucas brought in a different Director to make Star Wars IV ""The Empire Strikes Back"", he ended up with the movie most pick as the best of the 5 (to date).  But Mr. Lucas didn't like what the Director ultimately did with that movie.
George should stick to what he does best (producing, marketing, etc.) and let those more qualified do the rest.  He should have hired a qualified Script Writer, a qualified Director and a qualified Casting person to do get the right actors/actresses.  After all, he certainly has enough money to do it right.  But of course, he isn't willing to give up 'artistic control' of his flagship.  ...",1022544000,10,1305,4.555555555555555
1322731,4,B00003CXKT,"This long-awaited installment in the Star Wars saga is breathtaking, and a big improvement over Episode 1. But is the movie any good? Well, yes, and no.
Yes, the effects and visuals are breathtaking. The film looks absolutely gorgeous. The battle scenes are stunning. The art deco renderings of Coruscant, the fairy-tale sunshine of Naboo, the cathedral-like Jedi halls, and the rain-soaked water world of the cloners, and their ultra-clean city dwellings, are all brilliant. Art direction for the 21st Century, to be sure. Much of the film is smartly done.
And no, the dialogue is at times childishly written. The transition of Anakin from troubled teen to Dark Side bait is choppy, uneven, and not really believable. The romantic elements are heavy-handed, and poorly acted (by Christensen, not Portman). All of these beautiful moments and scenes, visuals, effects, and other elements were each mindblowing, pristine, gorgeous, and perfectly designed... but the way they are pieced together is not. In short, it seems the story was an afterthought, and a flimsy way to tie all of the wonderful visual elements together.
The original Star Wars broke the barriers of (then) limited special effects, introducing new thinking as well as new techniques and technologies in the field of movie magic. ""Clones"" is no different, what with the practically seamless digital animation. In fact, the only ""fake"" moments come when an actor is inserted or morphed into a scene through computer animation (most notably when Mr. Lee is riding his sky-scooter). Other than that minor quibble, the film is a breathtaking collection of jaw-dropping effects work. But let's face it; effects alone a good movie does not make.
I like Ewan McGregor as Kenobi. Some have criticized him for ""channeling"" Alec Guiness, but out of all the cast, he is the only one who has to merge his performance with the original actor from the series. More power to him, I say. He's doing just fine. I also like Natalie Portman and Ian McDiarmid. Samuel Jackson is a bit moody and broody, but he fills his role suitably.
As for the young Mr. Christensen, he needs to go back to his high school drama club. Sorry, but for every scene where his performance was perfect, there had to be at least two or three where he botched it. In the final analysis, I just couldn't buy Anakin's transformation to the Dark Side. Sure, there are moments when you see it, but then the actor throws what amounts to a teenage temper tantrum, and ruins the moment. His reading of the romantic dialogue is stilted, phony, and forced, especially when placed against Portman's far more believable romantic reading.
Now, I realize fans of the Backstreet Boys or whoever will just love this guy and his looks, and I'm sure that one day he will mature into a fine actor. I really hope this starts to happen before Episode 3, because again, looks alone a good movie actor does not make, just as effects alone cannot carry a movie. I just can't believe Lucas would let some of these scenes with young Mr. Christensen make the cut, and to be fair, the burden here falls more on Lucas than Christensen. As a director, it was his job to bring out the best performance the actor could provide, and that was just not the case with Mr. Christensen's performance.
But that's not all. What the movie really seemed to be missing was a bad guy. In the original trilogy, it was Darth Vader, hands down one of the top five movie villains ever. In ""Phantom Menace"", it was Darth Maul, again, a brooding force for evil. Here we have a bounty hunter, and Christopher Lee. The bounty hunter is the standard second tier villain in an action movie, which is just fine to provide an obstacle for the heroes until they take on the head bad guy. He and his son (the future Boba Fett), both do a great job of providing this challenge for our heroes. But the head bad guy (Lee) just wasn't all that menacing, and had very little screen time.
Now, there is no question about Christopher Lee's talent (and I like the idea of his being in the Star Wars saga, sort of picking up the torch of his long time friend and colleague Peter Cushing). His character is just fine, but came off more as another second tier villain rather than the big threat (like Vader and Maul). One fun thing is to watch the magnificent Lee, the second most famous Dracula in film history (after Lugosi), playing Count Dooku, complete with black cape and gothic setting. And the sabre duels he has with Skywalker, Kenobi, and Yoda are some serious throwing down (although a bit reminicent of ""Empire Strikes Back""). But is he as bad a dude here as Vader or Maul? As much as I love seeing Mr. Lee, I have to say, no, not really.
Some inconsistancies; C3PO and R2-D2 wander all about Tattooine without recognizing it (or Obi Wan), in the classic Star Wars. The same could be said for the future Darth Vader, who orbits the planet in the 1977 film as if it were just any old planet in the Empire instead of the one he grew up on. And lastly, if the technology of the Star Wars universe is so advanced that they can attach a cybernetic device that acts as a fully functional limb, then why can't they reattach the severed limb itself? Heck, we can do that in many cases today with our ""primitive"" medical science. Oh, well, we can chalk that one up to dramatic licence.
To be honest, I had to see this movie twice before deciding I liked it (most of it, anyway). This is not your father's Star Wars, however, and if that's what you go in expecting, you will be very disappointed. This is a teen pop, Brittany/n'Sync Star Wars, aimed at a decidedly modern, younger audience.
I give it one star for the bad romantic dialogue and the pointless, slapstick abuse of C3PO, five for the visuals, four for a young Kenobi in action, and five for the battle sequences.
Bottom line, ""Attack of the Clones"" is worth a look.",1022544000,4,5885,4.627151051625239

Most movies are not even worth the $7 or the time but Stars Wars was !,1022544000,4,401,4.025
1322733,2,B00003CXKT,"I think even the most devout Star Wars fans entering the theatre weren't expecting to worship this film. So when we were challenged by stilted dialouge, bad acting, a convoluted plot and the most spiritless cliched romance I have ever seen, we took it all in stride. We were pleased by the conspicuously limited role of Jar Jar, pleasantly amused by the (for the most part) fun banter between C-3PO and R2D2, and awed by George Lucas' undiminished ability to create freshly beautiful alien landscapes. We didn't object when Lucas lifted scenes and dialogue from Gladiator, Blade Runner and the earlier Star Wars trilogy. We even cheered during Yoda's gravity-defying lightsaber battle at the end of the film. Still, leaving the theatre, I couldn't stave off a sense of regret. Count Dooku pales in comparison to the menacing presence of Darth Vader that gave depth and power to the Dark side. Anakin and Amidala's romance falls way short of the witty banter and magnetic chemistry that characterized Han and Leia's relationship. And most of all, the Force, which used to be a fascinating, mystical synthesis of Eastern religion and Western heroic tradition, has been reduced to a side-effect of some obscure microscopic parasitism (the Medichlorians?!?--in my mind they were indisputably George Lucas' worst science fiction creation ever). The legacy of original Star Wars, an innovative, fun, compelling film of epic proportions, has been reduced to a overly-commercialized special-effects fest.",1022544000,4,1496,5.2635983263598325
1322801,3,B00003CXKT,"Okay, I have been a Star Wars fan since I was a little kid- and I'm sorry, but this film was a dissappointment compared to Lucas' other works.  The Phantom Menace was great, but didn't hold up to the previous SW movies.  The Clone Wars bites.  That's as blunt as I can be.
  Natalie Portman was AWESOME!, and Ewan McGregor was great as Obi. And the only thing that saved this movie for me was Yoda's [rear]-kicking scene at the end.  I mean- he was a bad [rear]!!
 HOWEVER, I wanted to puke at everyone of Christensen's scenes as Anakin.  I had so hoped to see Johnathan Jackson cast as Anakin, and now I wish he had for sure!  Anakin was portrayed as a sloppy, whiny brat, with no remorse, much less a brain.  I know- some people say this portrayal helps us to understand how he could slide into the dark side later on.  And, honestly, I guess so.  Because none of the Jedis would put up with his [rear] for very long.  My guess is that they TOSS him into the Dark Side with a one way ticket.
 But in all honesty, if you're a Star Wars fan, by all means - see the movie. Hell, buy it when it comes out on video.  But take it with a grain of salt.  And remember that Lucas at one point, was a brilliant director.  Now, I wonder what he's been smoking.",1022544000,,1251,4.103305785123967
1322802,3,B00003CXKT,"OK, I need to put things in perspective for you before I start this review.  I saw the original Star Wars in 1977 opening weekend and it changed my life.  I was a sci-fi geek from that day forward.  I have seen every Star Wars movie since then on the opening day.  I am a Star Wars geek who loves Star Wars.  Heck, I even liked Phantom Menace!
I waited hours for the 12:01 am showing of this movie and left the theater not sure what I felt.  I waited 25 years to see Jedi fight enmasse in the Clone Wars and I got to see it.  Lots of things like that were right there before my eyes and yet I left the theater disappointed.  Here's why...
First, there are 2 plot lines (a love story and a detective story) in this movie that merge into a final third plotline (a war story).  The detective story was good, but Lucas feel into the trap of including action at certain points for CGI sake.  In fact, there are many points in the movie where a scene would seem to have been put in there for no other reason than for the CGI folks to show off how great the CGI is.  But still, Obi-Wan as a detective hunting the Truth was a cool plot that I enjoyed overall.
The love story between Anakin and Padme, however, was nearly painful it was so bad.  Now please don't get me wrong ... the parts were very well acted ... put the lines they were given were horrible!  Also, it seems like some parts were missing in the story as if it had been over-edited.  You are watching this love story that will take 12 steps to unfold and someone skips steps 4-9 and jumps right into the ""I will die for you"" realm with no growth in the middle.  It just did not work.
Lastly, there was the opening battle of the Clone War.  Awesome.  Yes, most of the CGI was again for CGI sake, but for us hardcore geeks waiting decades to see it, it was worth the wait.  No action movie fan would be disappointed.
So, I really liked 2/3 of the movie and hated the other third.  Overall, I give the movie 3 out of 5 because the love story was so bad.  Quick frankly, I wonder if some of the long CGI scenes could have been cut down by 15 minutes or so and that screen time devoted back to the love story plot.
In summary, Attack of the Clones left me with the feeling that I had seen some awesome scenes and some horrible scenes combined within a mediocre movie.  I blame the writing, directing and editing for this failure and judge the acting to have been mostly good to awesome.
I hope that George Lucas will let Episode III be directed by someone else so that he can focus on the story and get a second opinion on the visual presentation of the story.  Steven Speilberg and Ridley Scott both come to mind as possible directors.  Unfortunately, I think that GL will direct it himself and that Ep. 3 will only move further in this unfortunate direction.",1022544000,3,2812,4.166666666666667
1322803,5,B00003CXKT,"Well.. The acting wasn't top notch, but Star Wars is in my opinion; FINALLY back. After the completely waste of a movie Star Wars 1, we get a movie with a more adult style, a bit darker, brilliant action scenes, and we actually get to see Yoda in action. But probably most importantly: Ewan McGregor does a much better job here! He was practicly sleeping the last movie. The actors do a lot better job in this movie as well. They deliver a more throughout performance. Go Samuel! hehehe
The first movie was meant for children, and while also this movie is kind to a general audience, I still think this was a more mature movie. Actually, this movie made me see IV, V, and VI all over again! I kind of miss the models and dolls technology, instead of all the computer graphics, but that is not important anymore. It is nice a grace to see them not change scene, or clip each time some bloke draws his / her lightsaber.
It's gone so many years since the first movies for christ sake! Let's celebrate that this movie was good, and pray to the light side of the force that the third movie will be as dark as George Lucas promises.
Cheers everybody, and may the force be with us!",1022544000,,1174,4.316742081447964
1322804,3,B00003CXKT,"First things first, it is an improvement on the Phantom Menace. But I was still expecting something better than this.
George Lucas be warned, this movie was supposedly aimed to intrigue viewers with the character of Anakin Skywalker - soon to become Darth Vader - and his romance with Senator Amidala. Well I'm sorry, but it miserably failed in this regard, and you have a lot of work to do in the final piece of the jigsaw to sort out the scattered storylines, patchy acting and horrendous dialogue!
Most importantly, Lucas seems to have put every effort into making the modern Star Wars an effects-driven action saga. I don't know about anyone else, but the original Star Wars meant much more to me than this.
In my opinion the movie was saved by impressive performances from Samuel L. Jackson, Ian McDiarmid and 79 year old Christopher Lee - one of the greats.
The movie to its credit includes some interesting sub-plots, in terms of the politics and settings, and you can see the storyline taking shape for Episode III. It will still capture the hearts of Star Wars fanatics, but much work is to be done for the final film, regardless of Episode II's inevitable box office success.",1022544000,6,1185,4.701923076923077
1322805,5,B00003CXKT,"I don't know from where to begin. This is the best star wars that I've watched. It was wonderful. It gives you everything what a SW fan needs. Firstly the cast is alright. Evetybody acted well in this movie. The special effects are wonderful especially the lightsaber scenes. They were organized and designed very well. The carachters are well fited. Yoda is well designed the creatures are well , the outdoor and indoor scenes are excellent designed. The scenario is well writen. I think the team realised their mistakes that they have made in the episode one and thay fixed these in this. You will face with everything that you need in this movie. Lots of lightsaber battles , the mystery of dark side , creatures ,
 different species and lots of action.
For the cast I can say that the best acting was made by Cristopher Lee .He is a legend he was amazing. I believe that no body can be so well fited as Count Dooku in this world. He was acting so royal , cool and peculiar. Besides Ewan McGregor was excellent too. He is on the right way to go his targets. For Nathalie and Hayden I can honestly say that they are above average however there is someone that we can not go quitely by unmentioning to him absolutly  Mr. Jackson. He was a great actor he has no mistake in acting , he is going to be a legend I believe.
About the story I can say that it was really good. I could not find any mistake or missing thing in. It explains everything that what is going to be happen.
For the special effects and music no body can say anything negative. Father Williams made it again. The music sounded so pure and clean to me. He makes this everytime and now he became a god of music for me. Besides as I mentioned the special effects and sounds are well designed however in some scenes some effects are disturbing your eyes and in some scenes the effects can not handle the mood of scene but thats all they were the best effects that I have watch especially the yodas behaviours and design are on top Just for the effects it worth to watch.
To sum up I can clearly say that don't miss this movie. It deserve every good and pozitive words. Thank you Mr. LUCAS . Thanks to all of the crew.
!!! MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU !!!",1022544000,5,2215,4.271428571428571
1322806,5,B00003CXKT,"As the title says, this was the best movie I have seen in my 45 years of living on this planet.  I have seen thousands of movies and it has been a passion of mine since early childhood.  So, why you ask was this the best movie I ever saw?  Well, it's quite complex on one hand and very simple on the other.  Imagine waiting 18 years upon meeting someone to actually seeing them at their finest.  That's a long drink of time to wait to see someone's potential.  I sincerely hope you've seen the movie or this will be a horrible spoiler for you, but when Yoda appears to go one on one with the story's villain the audience as though it had one voice in unison, gasped and my eyes mist up when I think back on it.  The anticipation of such a moment was truly cinematic magic and a testament to the magic George Lucas and company have blessed American cinema with.  The Disney franchise has nothing on this guy but I digress.  I was so thrilled to see Yoda strut his stuff and felt as if I knew him so well in having seen him in three other features.  The other factor that pushed this movie over the top to the number one slot of all time was how visually stunning the picture was.  Each scene was coated with so much eye candy I was pinching myself repeatedly as I watched it to remind myself this was the first of what will become many multiple viewings.  I've never watched a movie and anticipated it's arrival on dvd as much as I did this movie and I guess that's the barometer by which I judge my movies.  Sure, it wasn't without flaw and wooden acting by prepubescent children is a standard die-hard ""Star-Wars"" fans have grown accustomed to so I didn't deduct points for that but as a whole it was why the movie was invented and culminated the best of the best in the industry to show the rest of the world, ""This is how it's done when it's done right"".  May the force be with you.",1022544000,3,1885,4.185595567867036
1322807,5,B00003CXKT,"Being a Star Wars fan nearly all my life, it was heaven on earth when it was annouced that George Lucas was making the prequel trilogy of Star Wars films based on the backstory he created for the original trilogy. Although some people disliked Episode I The Phantom Menace, I thought it was an entertaining film that reminded me of the first Star Wars film (Episode IV). I was just so psyched that there was a new Star Wars film after a 16 year wait. As with the release of any new Star Wars film,I had major expectations for Attack of the Clones because it was the middle film in the trilogy and that the best Star Wars film ever, in my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back was also the middle film in the original trilogy. Naturally there would be comparisions between the two films.
I would rank Attack of the Clones as the second best Star Wars film behind only Empire. The love story between Anakin and Padme seemed like a separate film whereas the relationship between Han and Leia played out better in terms of the overall plot of the film. However, I felt, the chemistry between Anakin and Padme was convincingly portrayed on film because of one thing: Natalie Portman. If you are not totally in love with Natalie, I really don't think the love story would work, but her delicate beauty and grace compels you to really care about these two characters, especially during the execution cart scene which is reminiscent of the scene in Empire when Leia confesses her love to Han Solo just before he is put in the carbon freeze. About the only thing I can complain about the love story aspect of the film is that the Japor snipet good luck charm that young Anakin gave to Padme in Episode I is nowhere to be seen or referred to. I thought it would have been a nice touch if George Lucas shot a scene (following the scene when Padme retires for the evening after meeting Obi-Wan and Anakin in her apartment)where it shows Padme taking off her senatorial robe to reveal the lucky charm necklace and show that even after 10 years she still cares about Anakin. That would have been a nice little touch.
I'm wasn't totally sold on Hayden Christensen's portrayal of Anakin, until the scene where he reveals his anger and rage toward the Tusken Raiders just after someone very close to him dies in his arms. Very dark. Very intense. Very Darth Vader-like. It was that scene which made me believe that this kid is going to be the Dark Lord of the Sith.
I think Ewan McGregor was the absolute perfect choice to play the young Obi-Wan Kenobi. I'm glad he has a much larger role in Clones. I don't know why George Lucas did not create more of a character for Obi-Wan in the Phantom Menace? He simply served a purpose in the storyline by being, for the most part, obedient to his master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
The action sequences in Clones are by far the best in the Star Wars series. I thought the Hoth ground battle and Asteroid field chase sequences were good in Empire. The Coruscant chase, Obi-Wan vs. Jango Fett battle in the rain, asteroid field mine sequence, and the climax were some of the best action scenes in film history that rival the action scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
And finally, the final third of the film has to be regarded as one of the most exhilarating 40 or so minutes in film history. It all begins with Padme and Anakin's adventure in the droid factory, the Gladiator-like arena beast battle, the masses of Jedi Knights in combat, the Clone Troopers ground and air assault, and last but not least the lightsaber duels between Anakin, Obi-Wan, Count Dooku and Yoda. I felt the lightsaber duel in Phantom Menace was actually better, more epic in scale. It was more reminiscent of the Vader/Luke duel in Empire where they were fighting in different locations in Cloud City. Whereas the lightsaber duel in Clones was confined to one location, Count Dooku's secret hangar. Nevertheless, now I know why Yoda was referred to as a ""great warrior"".
I really don't know why some people disliked this film. Everybody has their opinions but if you watch this film simply for entertainment value, you won't find a more satisfying or enjoyable experience.
One of the best Star Wars films.",1022457600,,4188,4.563081009296149
1322808,5,B00003CXKT,"This was definitely surprising, inspite of the terrible acting by Ewan McGregor, the rest of cast was brilliant!! Natalie Portman and Samuel L. Jackson did great jobs at their parts and Natalie I was especially impressed with her ability to stand strong even at the weakest points of the movie. She really held Ewan together, to make him look not so bad!! This was definitely TWO THUMBS UP! I was impressed!!! Traitor after traitor, who's next? We all know that answer, Anakin Skywalker, this movie is where he loses his arm! AT Two points in this movie, you think the quenn(Portman) is going to die, but is she really? She is one heck of an actress!!! Samuel L. Jackson puts on another great performance, the guy who played Oby One Kenoby was good, and Jar Jar Binks was NOT ANNOYING in this movie. This one is better than the 4th movie, but not better than the 6th!! That one was the best of the series but this will be as close as you're going to get to that one!! GREAT FILM, WATCH IT!! I just watched it in the theatres tonight and I'm downloading it and watching it again this weekend it's that good!!! WATCH THIS, IT'S AWESOME!!! Sorry, not Ewan McGregor, it was the guy who played Anakin who was bad, daw!!! I was sleepy, it's good movie!!",1022457600,,1247,4.449781659388647
1322886,4,B00003CXKT,"The second installment in the Star Wars prequels sports great computer-generated effects, a stunning John Williams' score, a better use of Samuel L. Jackson and Yoda (voiced again by the Frank Oz), and a satisfying development of Anakin Skywalker (later to become the infamous Darth Vader), played by the young Hayden Christensen. Christensen is a vast improvement over the child actor in the previous film. Natalie Portman's Senator Amidala shows the mettle that she would pass on to her progeny, Luke and Leia.
However, this reviewer must tip his hat to the addition of Hammer film veteran Christopher Lee in the pivotal role of Count Dooku. It is not just coincidental that Lee's frequent co-star, the late Peter Cushing, was featured in a prominent role in the first Star Wars' film. The inclusion of both of these fine performers, as well as the late Sir Alec Guiness, adds a note of class to the movie sagas.
Lee, like Cushing, is being discovered by a new generation of filmgoers with his role in this film as well as his part in the recent ""Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring."" His towering presence and commanding voice are perfect for the part. The well-choreographed fight scene between Dooku, Anaken, Obi-Wan, and a surprisingly amble Yoda are highlights of the film's last thirty minutes.
Forget the ""clones."" It's the original Lee that makes this one a winner!",1022457600,,1385,4.872881355932203

The colors/landscapes are incredible.  Ewan and C3p0 are hilarious-listen closely to what they say.  If you are undecided after your first viewing, see it again, I loved it even more the 2nd time.

1322888,5,B00003CXKT,"Those who criticize this film for the dialogue or love story miss the whole point of the Star Wars series I think.
Star Wars is not about love or talk, it's about .... well .... War!
On that level this film more than delivers plenty of action.  If you want love scenes there are all kinds of chick flicks to choose from.  For great dialogue there are plenty of classic films there too.
Folks forget the original trilogy was not characterized by excellent dialogue or hot love scenes either.  People did not go back to see these films repeatedly for the dialogue, it was for the action and special effects.  The original trilogy has grown in the minds of some to mythic proportions but it actually was not a lot different than this film.
If great love scenes and sparkling dialogue are your criteria for an excellent film experience, perhaps this film is not for you.
However, if you want action and special effects, this film meets or exceeds all expectations.  It certainly ranks with any film in the original trilogy.",1022457600,,1019,4.607734806629834
1322889,4,B00003CXKT,"Fabulous installment in the Star Wars saga!  I really enjoyed the emotional foreshadowing, and the undercurrents of tension that make even light-hearted moments seethe with unease.
Lucus has done a wonderful job fleshing out the character of Annakin, and kudos go to Hayden C. for taking that vision and running with it.  It is clear that this is a young man driven by emotional passion in all its forms, and we see the seeds of desparation that will eventually drive him to become Darth Vader.
In Obi-Wan, we see yet another vision of the Jedi Knight -- like Qui Gon in the last installment, he walks a tightrope of wisdom and impetuosity.  These human elements -- even if they be human frailty -- infuse the story with a great deal of warmth.
The interplay between Annakin and Obi Wan is electric, and one is almost breathless with tension: when will things change?  when will we see the metamorphosis from a familial bond to a bitter rivalry?  Similarly, the scenes with Amidala and Annakin resonate with unease.  The battle between desire and duty, between love and honor -- this is the kind of epic conflict that made the Star Wars series legendary.  Bravo, Mr. Lucas!",1022457600,3,1173,4.720588235294118
1322890,1,B00003CXKT,"After reading the (genrally) good reviews here and elsewhere, I was optimistic about Attack of the Clones.  Unfortunately, I saw the movie. In a nutshell, the technical wizardry of George Lucas continues to advance (within limits), but his imagination and ability to maintain an engaging narrative ran out with the Empire Strikes Back.  I will say that the plot had potential.  An attempt was made to make this movie more of an actual epic, and they almost (almost) had a very nice Greek tragedy twist. (What if Count Dakoo's rebellion was exactly what he told Obi Wan it was, a noble attempt to thwart the increasingly powerful Seth master?  Oh, that would have been imaginative -- making the Jedis complicit in their own demise.)  Ultimately, though, there is no depth to the movie.  The actors all seem to be doing exactly what they're doing... moving from one set to another.  There is no sense that these are glimpses of another universe, where the reality of what we're being shown extends beyond the boundries of the screen.  Instead, the script is lame (at times horrible), the acting is wooden, and it's difficult to care about any of the characters.  The pace of the movie seems designed for viewers with a 15 second attention span, barreling ahead for no reason other than to keep you from focusing on the acting and the script.  Unfortunately, the action is mostly just frenetic movement, the fight scenes fail to create any sense of tension or excitment (I'm being polite, my wife found them exceptionally boring), and the 'love' scenes are painful -- well, except for Natalie Portman's leather bodice which appears to have been obtained at Frederick's of Naboo.  Ah well, another waste of some truly fine acting talent.  More Mystery Science Theater 3000 material.  Rent Galaxy Quest again instead, and wait for this to come out on video.
Pleasent surprises:  Jango Fett.  He had potential as an extremely capable, but non-Jedi, non-Seth, advisary.  Sort of an anti-Han Solo.  Unfortunately, he's now dead (yes, I know that his clone 'son' survives, but can we count on Lucas to not screw him up?).",1022457600,13,2112,4.871148459383753
1322891,4,B00003CXKT,"Star[]Wars! The series has come back into full swing with 'Attack of the Clones.' Everything that 'Phantom Menace' tried to be and more, we return to the rollicking space adventure that made the first three classics. Don't pay attention to the negitive reviews, aside from a little cheese covered romance the goods are delivered in great fashion. 'Attack..' is packed with extremely well lensed action set pieces that remind the viewer of the summer of 1980. The acting is decent and works for the material provided...I mean, this is Star Wars not Shakespere and lines are delivered with intended monotonality; lightsabers speak louder than words and emotion a Jedi does not crave. I found this film to be better than 'Return of the Jedi' due to its return to the swashbuckling action/adverture of the first two movies sans cute little talking kid friendly creatures that help generate mechandise sales for the toddler marketing target group. The special effects are outstanding of course, and the sound effects were really cool. The story was decent enough to get you to care what happens to the heroes and dislike the villians (finally, villians. That seemed to be missing from episode one save Darth Maul who was way underused). All around an excellent chapter in the saga and a great movie in itself. This film makes you look forward to the next installment and the man himself-Darth Vader. Thanks, George for reigniting the magic that was, and is, Star Wars.",1022457600,,1463,4.951219512195122
1322892,4,B00003CXKT,"To be fair I only gave this movie 4 stars because, in all honesty, it wasn't perfect.  However, having been the Star Wars nut for the last 25 years, I absolutely loved it and it chafes me to see so many people tear into it and into George Lucas! My advice is simple, if you're not a Star Wars fan don't waste your money!  Leave the seats open for fanatics like my husband and me who have had to suffer sold-out theaters to see it a second time!  For the life of me I can't understand why someone who hated the movie the first time, would go and pay to see it again!
I didn't think the acting was bad.  I didn't see any Oscar performances but it wasn't what many people are making it out to be.  I think Hayden Christensen does a great job as Anakin. Anakin after all is now a teen.. teens (especially male teens) by nature are naive, emotionally unstable, irrational and terribly cocky.  Anakin's arrogance has been fed for the last 10 years by Palpatine and constantly thwarted by Obie-wan.  Add to the boiling kettle his guilt over leaving his mother and his confusion/ frustration over Padme's seeming indifference towards him and you have the perfect recipe for a very sullen, very irrational, very childish Anakin.  I thought Christensen understood his character well.. and portrayed it very nicely.
Ok there were a couple of scenes that I could've done without.. like the diner scene.. a diner just didn't seem to fit into a Star Wars movie.. even in Coruscant.  And when yoda takes out his saber.. I thought that was a little cheesy but I just laughed it off... little Boba and his villainous laugh?.. definitely had to go.
I have to admit that after the first viewing I was left a tiny bit unsatisfied with the romance between Padme and Anakin... so I went home and read the book (I am a fanatic after all).  Anyway I was quite happy and satisfied at the end in that regard and enjoyed the second viewing so much more for having done so.  There were scenes in the book that were either left out or cut out that I felt were a bit crucial to the development of this relationship.  I can't wait until the DVD comes out to see exactly what was cut out!  It is understandable though.... Mr. Lucas can only make a movie so long before our Attention Deficit/ TV programmed Society starts squirming in their seats and losing focus.
I thought George Lucas did a wonderful job!  He had to tell the story of Anakin Skywalker and somehow tie the other 4 movies in all within the span of two and a half hours; no easy feat I am sure!  I am really excited for the next installment and have faith that Mr. Lucas will not let us down!",1022457600,2,2626,4.363449691991787

Very well done !  Getting closer to the spirit of the original trilogy, eager to stimulate our never ending quest for the fantastic !  Spellbinding special effects, only Lucas could have imagined and bring to life on screen for us !.  Better story and better acting, though with respect to characterization, I prefer the original trilogy.  <....
Christopher Lee is, as expected, good as the villain, though, perhaps less mobile and threatening then we are used to watch him in previous outings - ...I like Heyden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) in his duo with Natalie Portman's ..., and wonder, who will dub his voice once he becomes Dart Vader - there is only one James Earl Jones.!  I also feel Natalie is better in her role (she is, perhaps, more gifted) than Carrie Fisher, her counterpart in the original series.
Also, I would have offered Mace Windu plaid by Samuel L Jackson ....
The musical score is great (I have always enjoyed it)- it blends naturally (energetic, or soothing, or melancholic) with the on-screen story, but, why not adding more novelty to John William's original ?!  Star Wars Episode II is enjoyable to watch, though it is not easy to beat the original trilogy (... to generate the same enthusiasm as about a quarter of a century ago, because when Star Wars was first offered to us in 1977 it really was something new with respect to everything !",1022371200,,1375,4.7322175732217575
1322894,5,B00003CXKT,"I think this movie was excellent. The characters were well scripted, the action was enticing and the graphics were gorgeous.
1. Hayden Christensen was fabulous. So many people have been complaining that he did nothing but whine and sulk. That was the POINT. That is his character. (to any teen girls complaining about their boyfriends dragging them to this movie-Hayden is one of the most gorgeous boys I've ever seen, but that's beside the point)
2. I love Natalie Portman and she did well in this movie, and was able to portray Queen Amidala's forbidden romance.
A few things I didn't like:
1. The fighting. I suppose it's because I've been raised on television, but I didn't find any of the fighting to be that spectacular.

And just because you FINALLY get to see another head cut off, and some limbs removed,that does not make this as good as ""THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK"".To come close to that there has to be some acting going on between portman and that new guy,which is sad because portman can act very well. the two most horrible things that have happened to these films are that with digital technology, lucas sticks with the effects and nothing else. He made the big mistake of not hiring someone else for number 2. And don't try and tell me number 1 was the setup and this is the payoff,thats bull.you can watch any of the original 3 and each one works on its own.

1323004,3,B00003CXKT,"I enjoyed seeing the Jedi as elite combatants and military leaders. The massive battle was a spendid use of modern warfare elements in a sci-fi film. Yoda's scenes with the small children, commanding the Army of the Republic, and later in that duel were all very entertaining. Lucas used some great stylized close-ups during the duel between Dooku and Anakin that I found very intriguing. Samuel L. Jackson's character had a subtly developed mystique & formidability about him that worked very well. Obi Wan's investigation and subsequent discovery of the clones really drew me in. The exact nature and role of these clones was unexpected for me and shows some real creativity on Lucas' part. We finally see how Darth Sideous is orchestrating a conflict from which he'll later gain power. But of course, the Force itself is using him and Anakin for its own purposes to eventually bring balance. Very epic.
My problems with the film: Digital Video simply is devoid of the type of magical texturing that real film stock is capable of lending to an image. In fact, I suspect that this is a coalescing of textures that is impossible to reproduce using even higher resolution DV cameras than Lucas is currently using (which are already state of the art). The Matrix photographed in 35mm and tightly focused in the theater is a great example of the special quality that chemical photography creates. Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World, also a DV film, had a similar digital, void quality to the picture. All the colors, brightness, and subjects are there, but it's relatively dry and lifeless on the big screen. In addition, there were some images in this film that do not lend themselves to 24fps 35mm playback. Some scenes with huge swaths of white will flicker and strobe to the discerning eye. This film was obviously meant to be seen on a continuously lit DLP projection system. There is also an odd technique here of taking brightly lit live action DV footage (DV requires lots of light), darkening it, and then digitally matting it onto a shadowy CGI scene for a sort of faux film noir effect. I repeatedly thought one of the bulbs in the projector had gone out, only to have the next scene's brightness correct me. This effect is very disconcerting.
Lucas and his Industrial Light and Magic are too fixated on CGI. Their CGI characters simply look goofy. That caf owner's skin looked so amorphous I could barely recognize his facial features. All CGI skin has the same fake quality to it. When distant scenes show CGI human characters, their motion is often gangly and unauthentic (e.g. Anakin riding on that grazing animal, Phantom Menace's early scene of Obi Wan & Jin dropping from a ledge). Combined with the CGI backgrounds, one gets the sense they are watching a CGI video game or an animated film.
I'm getting a little annoyed at the American stereotypes being injected into the new episodes: Spaceship that looks like an SR-71 Blackbird. Anakin's speeder looks like a Harley Davidson. His former owner sounds like an Italian. A cafe and its owner strait out of American Graffiti. Jar Jar Binks, etc.
The complaints, of course, would be of minor consequence if the acting and dialog were good, which is debatable. Heck, half the time the characters don't really even appear to be looking at each other's eyes, probably because they were staring at a ping-pong ball dangling from a pole. They're all capable performers, but don't seem to have found their characters (not to mention their environment). The dialog only exacerbates this, often resorting to pop culture references and clichs. While the romance in Attack of the Clones is of course predictable, there *is* a hint of chemistry early on, but the dialog ruins this and eventually makes it feel like just a rushed plot development. What I miss most of all, though, is the sharp, endearing wit of Han, Luke, Ben, and Leia. The first three films were really character-based action-adventures. In his attempt to tie up so many loose ends and explain so much in the original films, Lucas has unfortunately become preoccupied with everything but the most important parts of moviemaking.",1022371200,,4153,4.858956276445698

1323006,3,B00003CXKT,"&#65279; Although certainly a vast improvement over the disappointment embodied by The
Phantom Menace in 1999, The Attack of the Clones is arguably worthy of its hereditary Star
Wars title. Its most redeeming feature is the minuscule number of speaking lines given to the
returning Jar Jar Binks.
 Although Christopher Lee and Samuel L. Jackson bring visible acting talent to the screen,
the wooden dialogue between Natalie Portman's Senator Amidala and Hayden Christenen's
brazen Anakin prevents any real emotion from showing through. Ewan McGregor plays a more
believable Obi-Wan Kenobi than he did in Episode I, but he is still constrained by the number
and nature of his speaking lines.
 Beyond the dialogue, there is much of interest in Attack of the Clones, from massive
automated droid-building assembly lines to fierce alien gladiatorial beasts, from aerial sky-lane
chases to enormous rooms of jar-contained baby clones. The special effects are incredible, yet
seem to dominate the movie perhaps more than they should. Nearly every shot in the movie
includes a CGI character, structure, or background, and this gets overwhelming by the end, which
features Yoda's first on-screen light sabre battle. Even Yoda is less anthropomorphic now that
the warmth and character of the puppet used in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi
has been lost to a more Shrek-like computer-generated version.
 Another great aspect of the movie was its sound: John Williams' amazing score helps to
tie events in Episode II with other installments of the series, as we hear echoes of Princess Leia's
theme in Amidala's scenes, and a variation on the Imperial March as the Republic's army takes
off from Coruscant in a fleet of Star Destroyers. The choral grandeur of Episode I's Duel of the
Fates, which accompanied the climactic battle against Darth Maul, is also reprised in the
showdown with the sinister Count Dooku. To top it off, an incredible array of sound effects
enhance the movie greatly, most notably the seismic charges deployed by Temuera Morrison's
Jango Fett against a pursuing Obi-Wan over the planet Geonosis.
 The most fun aspect of Attack of the Clones is making connections between what is
happening and what has yet to come: young Boba Fett watches his father die in front of him, clad
in the Mandalorian armour that will become Boba's trademark later on. We meet Owen and Beru
Lars for the first time, who will become Luke's foster parents. And of course, C-3PO and R2-D2
begin their escapades together.
 The bottom line is that plot, characters, and everything else take a back seat to the special
effects. Hardcore fans will be disappointed, youngsters will be wowed; but for pure escapism,
there is nothing like it.",1022371200,8,2738,5.075555555555556
1323007,4,B00003CXKT,"There are certain type of movies that are just meant for escape. Movies that help us forget our worries and merely entertain us. They do not ""teach"" us anything about our own lives. We don't find out the meaning of life or why we die, but, we are taken to a place we have never been. ""Star Wars: Attack of the Clones"" is that type of movie. Perhaps the best entry into the ""Star Wars"" series, ""Clones"" takes us on an exciting ride, that I personally enjoyed from beginning to end. It just dazzles us with it's special effects, unique characters, and of course, those lightsaber fights!
 Many people are complaining that this film doesn't have ""strong"" enough characters to hold our interest. That the dialogue is ""stiff"", full of cliches. Who on Earth honestly goes to see a ""Star Wars"" film for Oscar caliber acting? Who goes for any other reason than the simple joy of seeing the new worlds director George Lucas has created? If you go see movies like ""Star Wars"" for any other reason, honestly, don't bother. You're missing out on the whole movie experience if your only purpose in seeing it is to find loop holes. You wasting your time and your money than. Sit back and relax, go along on the adventure that Lucas has created. Put your mind in remission.
 I've been a fan of the ""Star Wars"" film since I was 13, I'm 19 now. I'm not one of those obsessed fans, who find ""Star Wars"" to be a way of life, but, I do think the films are a great escape. I find it odd for me to be saying this but ""Clones"" really is the best of the series I think, and if anything is only behind ""A New Hope"" (That's the first one that was released in 77). ""Clones"" is so action packed, that I think people who are not familiar with ""Star Wars"" may find the film to be enjoyable, and this film may create some new fans as well.
 Last year there was so much talk about Hayden Christensen's perforamnce in ""Life As A House"". I saw that film, and for the life of me, I can't understand what people saw. But, now with ""Clones"" I understand. He turns in a very good performance. And I was really suprised by Natalie Portman! She seems to be the perfect ""replacement"" for the Carrie Fisher character. With the expection of Ewan McGregor I wasn't really impressed with anyone else, acting wise. Though, it was fun seeing Pernilla August (She acted in ""Private Confessions"", by Ingmar Bergman), she has a small cameo has Shmi Skywalker, Anakin's mother.
 If you've never seen a ""Star Wars"" film, chances are you'll be very confused. I would recommend at least seeing Episode 1 before this. But, over-all, I think ""Attack of the Clones"" is a real crowd pleaser.
 Bottom-line: ""Clones"" brings back the ""fun"" of the original 3. It's action packed, and has some good performances. It's one of the year's best films!",1022371200,7,2784,4.461689587426326
1323008,3,B00003CXKT,"Not only does this movie have the worst title ever given any film in history, it isn't even accurate.  Yes, there are more clones than you can shake a lightsaber or two (hundred thousand) at, but they're really just lurking around in the background, are given a once-over in the middle of the movie, and don't do anything until the finale  -  when you don't even realize they're the clones until after you've left the theater.
There are a lot of problems with this movie, but they must be prefaced with the recognition that it is better than Episode I:  The Phantom Menace.  First and foremost  -  aside from the gross inaccuracy of the title  -  the love story between Queen Amidala and the young Annakin Skywalker is terribly wooden, doesn't develop believably, and really grinds the movie to a screeching halt whenever it crops up.  There are either plot inconsistencies with former movies, or else they haven't sufficiently been encountered or explained before this one  -  for instance, since when were Jedi Knights forbidden to marry?  (I could easily be mistaken, but I seem to recall that their new recruits were often their own offspring.)  And if they are forbidden to marry, but Annakin and Amidala intend to cherish their forbidden love, why do they marry each other in the open?  When did Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru become Annakin's family by marriage  -  and if that was always the case, isn't their later obliteration by Darth Vader a bit odd?  And  -  aside from the simple desire to create a series of comic situations  -  why does R2D2 deliberately push C3PO into almost certain doom on the trash heap...and then later put him back together as if it was all just some sort of junior high school prank?
Yes, I know, it's only a movie.  But continuity, people, continuity.
Aside from these  -  and a few other  -  complaints, the movie has a great deal to recommend it.  The scenery and effects are incomparably beautiful, easily the best of the entire series (but, then, that is where the budget goes, after all).  The opening series of sequences with Obi-Wan and Annakin tracking down an attempted assassin of Amidala are incredibly exciting, as is the slam-bang finale and the Arena sequence immediately preceding it.  The concluding battles involving Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee and everyone's favorite Little Green Man, Yoda, are great.  Obi-Wan's sleuthing-out of the clone planet and his fighting pursuit of Janga Fett are also top-notch.
In short, George Lucas needs to spend more time thinking out the continuity of his stories and not confusing his audience, but there's no denying he knows how to put on a killer show.",1022371200,,2650,4.783664459161148

1323010,5,B00003CXKT,"STAR WARS: ATTACK OF THE CLONES REVIEW:
...the best Star Wars film since Empire Strikes Back. This movie had some of my favorite moments in cinema. Honestly I did not have really high expectations of Attack Of The Clones but after watching this movie, there was no doubt in my mind that Lucas is still the king of special affects. The movie starts really well, and ends with a scintillating bang!
Yes the script is a bit cheesy at times, more so than any other Star Wars movie. But the acting is quite good. Hayden Christensen is a great Anakin Skywalker. I am telling you that his acting is more than good, it is great. There are some scenes where Anakin shows his dark side; and those are the best scenes of them all. Hayden Christensen comes off as a superb actor, and with the proper direction will surely move on to better films.
Natalie Portman is great as the former queen turned ambassador, while Obi Wan Kenobi is well played by Ewan McGregor. The movie's climax is unexpectedly charming and enjoyable. I mean if the audience applauses and cheers the last fight scene, the director must have done something right. I am telling you, the audience was dead. This was the second day the movie was showing, and there were was no one dressed up or anything. But when Yoda stepped on to protect Obi Wan and Anakin, the crowd went wild. All that everyone needed to see was the little shadow, and they started chuckling. I mean we never imagined Yoda to be so agile, right? But Yoda kicked butt, and so did the movie
The special affects are great as usual, but I can't wait for the DVD of this particular film. It was shot exclusively with digital cameras, meaning the DVD transfer will be stupendous.
The love story is also well developed and never rushed. The only problem was the fact that some of the script was cheesy. But there were enough memorable lines to make this movie very entertaining.
There are some people who felt that the acting was a bit wooden and didn't like how Amidala and Anakin were. The problems aren't with the movie, but with the viewers. Some critics are trying too hard to liken this movie's characters to the old Star Wars movies. That is a huge problem with the fans and not the movie.
Ewan McGregor is convincing as anyone can be, when it comes to trying to fill the shoes of Sir Alec Guinness. There have been some complaints that Amidala wasn't the rogue that her daughter was, and that Anakin wasn't like Luke. That's all rubbish! These are different characters and are as well developed as anyone in Star Wars. As I said, Hayden Christensen was fantastic, as was the rest of the cast including Samuel L Jackson.
They made the best of the script, and were all up to the mark of any actor, in the history of Star Wars. The last thing I want to say about the acting is this; you have to keep in mind that all these actors were acting infront of a blue screen, speaking to imaginary creatures. And with that in mind, the acting was great.
After Empire Strikes Back, this has to be my favorite Star Wars picture. And that is from the point of view of a fan who simply loved the originals. You need to go watch the movie...",1022284800,,3154,4.430292598967298
1323011,4,B00003CXKT,"Thank God that we have The Attack of the Clones to save Star Wars from that 7-12 year old type movie The Phantom Menace. No more of Jar Jar who helped destroy TPM along with terrible acting and storyline. Isn't it weird that just now people are starting to say how much the Phantom Menace [stank]? George Lucas can even start to barely admit it was not that great. Yet they will argue that it set a record for the box office and was very successful. However, after 2 days after the Phantom Menace was released, I went to see it and it was less than half full. I wonder why? After 4 days of the release of AOTC, the theaters are still packed. Maybe Lucas began to realize that special effects don't make a great movie. The
  The ending was great in AOTC. The acting was better, but a little shaky on Anakin's part sometimes. The ending was slow and the love scenes at some times quite laughable. If it weren't for the beginning, it would have been a even greater movie. The effects were amazing and also the way the did Yoda throughout the movie. The one thing that never has gone wrong is the music. John Williams is a master and will continue to do nothing but help star wars. Only one thing, don't compare it to the Trilogy especially The Empire Strikes Back. Sure you might see some polls that rate AOTC as the best star wars movie ever (starwars website)  but that is just the biggest bunch of [junk]. AOTC is a good movie but doesn't hold a candle to the Trilogy. In the Trilogy you have better acting, better story, better screenplay etc. The only thing that is better in AOTC is the special effects. Take your pick on which combination you would like to have. George Lucas is a good story writer and good directer, but if you want the ultimate movie get back Irvin Kershner (ESB) as a director.",1022284800,,1801,4.338278931750742
1323073,5,B00003CXKT,"Ever since the first theatrical run of Star Wars in 1977, the sequels have gotten more and more ""kiddified"" (sans The Empire Strikes Back, which was moderately dark).  George Lucas' ""Special Editions"" were further attempts to make the series more suitable for his young children.  Consequently, you can imagine how I was luke-warm about The Phantom Menace when I saw it theatrically.
Let me tell you right now that Attack of the Clones is NOT The Phantom Menace.  AOTC is, in my opinion, the best all around Star Wars film yet.  George Lucas really exceeded my wildest expectations.  Any film critic that gives it a poor review is merely attempting to wield the mighty ""power of the pen"" because they have the power to do so.
AOTC was visually the best film that I've ever seen.  There weren't two frames of the movie that you would think took less than 2,000 manhours to create.  I can't wait to see it again to catch the millions of details that I missed the first time.  It was the deepest plot of all of the Star Wars films.  The plot took many unexpected twists and had emotional levels that previous Star Wars films never reached (and I vividly remember seeing the first Star Wars upon its original theatrical release -- I even remember exactly where I was sitting in the theater).  Attack of the Clones was dark and very serious, but ran the gamut of love, hate, humor, and excitement.  Best of all, ... it was a GREAT story.  Go see it -- if you are in the least bit a Star Wars fan, you won't be disappointed!",1022284800,,1518,4.48

Attack of the Clones is inconsistent in tone and quality. George seems to be more concerned with the technical aspects of the movie and less concerned with making characters you get to know and remember. Some scenes, especially ones that try to evoke heavy emotion fall flat on their face. How he chose to reintroduce C-3PO in Menace and Clones is downright hokey. I mean come on! Some of the dialogue was good but alot of it makes you cringe. The soundtrack has less of a role than in 4,5&6. It seems to be more in the background and not very memorable.

1323075,5,B00003CXKT,"...Hayden Christensen was simply GREAT as the teenage Anakin Skywalker. His on-screen charisma was superb and he's the perfect example of a polished young actor with a successful acting career ahead of him. Way to go, Hayden! I can't wait to see him fall over to the Dark Side in Episode III and become Darth Vader. And if you think that all he did was whine and complain, well that's just his character--so blame it on the dialouge if you must, not on him! I can see exactly why George Lucas chose him over the thousands of other young actors wanting to play the role of Anakin Skywalker.
The chemistry between Hayden and Natalie Portman (""Senator Amidala"") was excellent, and I thought they had better chemistry than Kirsten Dunst (""Mary-Jane"") and Tobey Maguire (""Peter Parker""/""Spider-Man"") did in the film SPIDER-MAN. Natalie Portman also did a fine job in her role, but the only thing that really ticked me off was that Natalie Portman changed her clothes like, every single time she appeared on the screen. I was like, ""Okay, that's enough already...can't you just pick a...outfit?!"" Ewan McGregor (""Obi-Wan Kanobi""), Christopher Lee (""Count Dooku""), Samuel L. Jackson, and the rest of the cast did the best they could with the dialouge they were given.
The special effects were simply stunning and oustanding! The fight scenes and lightsaber battle sequences were especially outstanding. You can see just how much the technology has improved since the very first STAR WARS film was released in 1977. And I really liked the digital Yoda (he lasts longer, lol!). The part at the ending when Yoda [fought] was totally awesome--the rest of the audience in the theater with me started cheering...seriously!
The love story was great, leaving a lot of suspense for the 3rd chapter, and will eventually lead us into the birth of Luke and Princess Leia...so they HAD to have this love story, people! It's not as though Lucas just threw it into the movie just for the heck of it. The love story between Anakin and Amidala actually had a purpose.
The John Williams music score is also truly superb and feels like the original STAR WARS music. I own the soundtrack and I still can't get enough of the score's ""Love Theme"", which is haunting beautiful, as is the rest of the music.
As for Jar Jar Binks (the supposibly comical character in THE PHANTOM MENACE who everybody seemed to hate), is seen a lot less in this episode. Jar Jar has about four scenes at the most, and very little lines. The teenybopper Pop Boy Band, N Sync--who was supposed to make cameo roles in Episode II for those who didn't know, are not in this film, either. Lucas cut out their cameo when online STAR WARS fans started complaining about N Sync being in Episode II, which I totally agree...N Sync has no right to be in STAR WARS! That cameo, though, will probably show up on the DVD's deleated scenes, so that should make all N Sync fans happy.
My whole point is, go see ATTACK OF THE CLONES! Forget about what the critics say, they really don't matter, because true STAR WARS fans will be thrilled with this second prequel. And make sure you see it on a digital screen, because the picture quality is so much better--believe me, you'll notice the difference. All I can say is, George...bring on Episode III and the DVD for ATTACK OF THE CLONES! Already in my book, Episode II is the best film of the year!",1022284800,,3380,4.672818791946309
1323076,5,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars fans know the problems with Episode I: The Phantom Menance. As a 27-year-old fan, I found Episode I severely lacking. The monumental status of the ""classic"" Star Wars story had not been surpassed in action, delivery, or character depth.
  I know the next generation of kids probably loved it, but I had felt disappointed and left out of consideration as a member of the older fan audience. I watched Episode IV at the age of 3 in the theater, as well as the other films. I didn't expect Episode I to be greater than the other three, but I had expected a better story, better acting, and better emotional depth to the characters.
  I'm happy to say that Episode II: The Attack of the Clones is the movie I had hoped for after the disappointment of the first installment.
  The movie is fast-paced with much more action, battles, and heavy political manuevering. Episode II clearly shows how complacent the Republic has become, and explains why the Empire is coming like the threat of a terrible, destructive storm.
  The comic relief has been returned to the droids instead of Jar-Jar Binks. Jar-Jar's role in the film is minimal. He isn't nearly as irritating as he came off in the first installment.
  The romance between Anakin and Amidala is handled with tasteful grace and doesn't overwhelm the film. There's enough of the romance to make the plot connect to part IV, V, and VI. Unlike others, I didn't feel it was ""thrown in"" because the romance is intended to be a plot device.
  I felt Episode II showed more emotional depth in the characters than the previous film. It aptly showed how goody-goody Anakin evolved into a rebellious, argumentative, frustrated, arrogant young man. His anger is understandable and his humanity and weaknesses are believable. Hayden Christensen's performance is quite convincing (versus Jake Lloyd). He definitely has the Anakin ""brooding look"" down, and he comes off working well with Natalie Portman's Padme Amidala.
  The film does have some rather bad dialogue in some spots, though overall a great improvement over Episode I. Episode II is a lot more like Episode V in many ways, and it's worth seeing.
  I don't want to give away anything to those who haven't seen the movie, but I do recommend the novelization for a more in-depth look behind the scenes not in the movie. The book is very effective in giving the reader a look into Anakin's head, his emotions, and motivations, as well as the other characters.
  If you were disappointed by Episode I, Episode II makes up for it in a huge, heart-pounding, falling-through-the-clouds-without-a-parachute way. There's nothing like a big, exciting thrill ride and having your socks blown off-which Episode II accomplished!",1022284800,,2723,4.895424836601308

1323079,3,B00003CXKT,"If you go to the movies to sit back and watch flashy special effects, and expect nothing more, then this is the movie for you.  But when I go into the theatre, I want to be engaged.  I want the writer of the script to get me to think, to move beyond the mundane aspects of reality.  Lucas has lost that over the years.
I have read that he picked up the writer of The Adventures Of The Young Indianna Jones, and The Mummy Returns, to help him out with this script, and it shows.  It is at best, infentile.  While people say that they enjoyed the romance, I didn't really see any.  They basically put two characters with nothing in common, who argued and bickered the entire time, together, and then expected the audience to believe that they fell in love because of this.  I mean come on, the Ambasador seems most atracted to our bratty little Jedi punk after he has slaughtered a village of men women and children.  Who are they trying to fool?
Lucas fell into the same trap here that he fell into on the Phantom Menace, he tried to tell too many stories, and he created characters that the audience couldn't identify with.  Lucas doesn't have the literary prowess to pull off such a feet.  Episodes four through six were amazing because he didn't try to cram everything down your throat.  He told, and stuck with the story of Luke Skywalker, who we were able to grow with as he matured.  Here we are given a little brat who surpasses the abilities of any full grown man, at the age of ten.  Can you identify with that?
Not only that, but the witty humor of Han Solo is replaced by the digital antics of Jar Jar Binks.  The actors in these new films, despite their caliber elsewhere, lack luster here.  Poor performance, probably because of a sad script, pulls this entire movie down.  I only gave it three stars because of the amazing special effects, the plot twist, and then one simply in paying homage to the originals.",1022198400,,1923,4.389830508474576

The movie is fast paced and its a treat to the eye especially the comic relief of C3P0 and R2D2. And one of the most wonderful scenes is when Ewan goes into a class that Master Yoda is teaching, and projects the Stars! Yoda is wonderful, and so is Christopher Lee, fresh from his role in ""The Lord of the Rings."" Its a movie that serious Star Wars fanatics should not miss, and is one that adults and children will enjoy over and over. George Lucas has done it again, and yes I can't wait to stand in line to see this film again!...I give this film five stars, because of the digital effects that you see thru the film, and the wonderful work that has everyone working together as a team unit to get this film done...",1022198400,,923,4.220338983050848
1323081,5,B00003CXKT,"I know I'm being a bit nice in calling Episode 2 this, but in my opinion the only other SW movie that rivals this one is ""The Empire Strikes Back.""
Episode 2 returns to the great story telling and eye pleasing that ESB was chock-full with. The stuff that ""Return of the Jedi"" and ""The Phantom Menace"" lost. Sure the story telling in ROTJ was pretty well done but the special effect and prodution design could of been a lot better; and in Episode 1 the special effects and all technical aspects of the movie were superb, but the story came out a little, if not very, flat and dull. Episode 2 is great in both FX and production. As I guessed from my last review this movie did have ""mucho lightsabre."" I was was not let down.
The acting in Episode 2 is way better than the acting in Episode 1. Hayden Christenson plays Anakin superbly and Ewan McGregor is great as Obi-Wan. This movie has plenty of Yoda and Jedi. It does lack a lot of Jar Jar Binks which a lot of you out there will love, but it truly makes me mad because Jar Jar and Liam Neeson are the only people who held Episode 1 together. I love Jar Jar. Jar Jar is the bomb. I want more Jar Jar. Free Jar Jar!
This movie dubbed, ""Attack of the Clones,"" is really well done and enjoyable. I give it five stars. Just like I said before, as far as Star Wars movies go, the only one that can rival this one is ESB, and maybe ""A New Hope.""",1022198400,,1391,4.0989010989010985

The fx are the best, and yes, I loved the story and the acting. It was not as wooden as I thought it would be. I really loved the way Anakin was portrayed as arrogant creep,and to see his anger dealt out on Tatooine. Some people say there is no chemistry. This could be due to the conflictive nature of the story and characters. Critics are panning this film because it is trendy to bash Star Wars now. Don't listen. Sure, this movie has some flaws, but I was having too much fun to make a list. This is Star Wars, and I love it.",1022198400,,647,4.102362204724409
1323181,5,B00003CXKT,"I have seen AOTC twice now, and am about to grab a third viewing. Yes, I am a Star Wars fan. Having seen every Star Wars film (including Episode 1) far too often I think that AOTC ranks right up there with the best of them (in my view Episode 5, The Empire Strikes Back).
I'll start with the negatives -
A 45 minute, completely unbelievable, love story. There is no good reason why Padme Amidala, an accomplished senator, ex-queen of about 30, would be at all interested in a self absorbed 20 yeah old boy. In fact, almost every conversation they have until she says ""I love you"" indicates that she barely likes him. Now, that would be bad enough if it weren't compounded by romantic dialogue that makes one want to cringe.
Anakin Skywalker. With no disparaging intended to a sterling performance by Hayden Christiansen, the character Anakin Skywalker has the makings of an Imperial Stormtrooper, not a Sith Lord. Sith Lords (Sidious, Dooku, even Maul) all have intelligent, thoughtful personalities. Anakin, on the other hand, having experienced 10 years of Jedi training is still too impetuous to turn into the authoratative, brooding Darth Vader. Now an excuse may be age, but someone who is childish at 20, despite being involved in the responsibilities of settling disputes as a Jedi apprentice, is unlikely to mature by 40 or so (which, I presume, is his age in Episode 4).
Anyway, since I gave the film 5 stars, there must have been something good in it...
Well... everything else!
The story manages through artful manipulation to provoke interest in a middle episode. Thanks to Lucas' somewhat arrogant folly, we know the ending already. Yet he has managed to create interesting twists, and an (almost) cliffhanger. The way it seems to be a simple issue of the republic falling apart then just before the final sequence of battles the viewer starts to realise that something unusual is afoot, leading up to the revelations at the end... brilliant! Lucas uses plays on names, elaborate timelines, and a host of inter-relationships (maybe too many, everybody was everybody's apprentice!) to weave an intricate society the binds of which are breaking...
The Star Wars universe comes alive in a way the initial films never allowed thanks to special effects and attention to detail that is unprecedented. The special effects are the best I have ever seen, as expected, with crisp believable alien landscapes, amusing and fun aliens, and great battle scenes... a visual treat that just gets better with successive viewings. The universe they portray, with the Jedi temple and its Padawan apprentice classes, Coruscant's bars, delis and streets, and more, comes to life as never before. Okay there are a couple technical anomalies like poor medical technology that mean people wear eye patches, or metal prosthetics, despite the fact that cloning technology is perfected... But once you can ignore or not notice these, you are in for a treat.
As for the battle scenes... they are simply the best a Star Wars film has ever offered, and that is saying something.
Although I am a true fan of the originals, I think that discarding the nostalgia and revolutionary value of the original trilogy, AOTC is at least as good a film as Episodes 4 and 6. Only Episode 5 can beat it, and I may feel different after I have seen it on DVD a few times!",1022198400,2,3338,4.827225130890052
1323182,4,B00003CXKT,"Lucas certainly deserves it - the technology is outstanding, and, unlike many, I feel the story line was rich, and only bogged down a little in the middle.  Visually, this film is so exciting, it begs you to see it again and again.  I saw it with the Digital THX enhancements - and it was startling.  The sound and music, too, is amazing and uplifting.  Natalie Portman, Christopher Lee, Samuel Jackson deserve a ""well-done""!  Yoda - can't get enough of him....he's truly the star of this show.
Can't give it 5, because, let's face it, the camaraderie, humor and heart that Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill brought to Han Solo and Luke are just missing.  Completely missing.  Ewan McGregor is adequate, but he doesn't inspire any of the quiet heroism that his predecessor did.  You don't root for him in the way you did for Han Solo.  Hayden Christensen is just awful.  Yes, he needed to be tall, and yes, they over-wrote the jealousy, anger and god-complex feelings that he has, but this kid is just a dud as Anakin.  There had to be someone in Hollywood that could have made you care about what was happening to him in the way that Hamill did in the first trilogy.  And since this film and the next are really the Anakin/Darth stories, no amount of Yoda can make up for the lack of his talent.
So, four stars, but I can't wait for the next one.  I hope that the slightly older Anakin/Darth will be played by someone deserving of the role....now, if only Jimmy Smits was younger...",1022112000,,1479,4.49438202247191
1323183,1,B00003CXKT,"I'm not sure I have ever been as let down watching a movie as I was with this one.  Contrary to what everyone seems to be saying, it is NOT better than The Phantom Menace.  I have to wonder if we didn't get to see Yoda ""in action"" if people would still think Attack of the Clones was so great.  The main problem with this movie is that it completely depends on knowlege of the original trilogy.  Granted most people who see the new movies are probably fans of the original, but that doesn't make it okay to completely ignore good storytelling.  The truth is there is not much to tell.  Everyone knows what's going to happen.  We have all imagined what went on before A New Hope.  When I think about it, the new trilogy is really pointless.  The new trilogy creates holes in the original trilogy.  Why would Obi Wan hide Luke on Tatooine after everything that happened. Not to mention that Tatooine is supposed to be a desolate planet.  The new series makes it seem like the hot spot of the universe.  And what about Anakin and Obi-Wan being good friends?  There is absolutely no fondness between them.  And Anakin being a great Jedi before he turned?  Why don't we get to see any of this?  Attack of the Clones is so devoid of emotion.  We wouldn't have any idea of Anakin's and Padme's feeling for one another except that they say so (in the most expressionless way possible).  There is just no chemistry between any of the characters.
George Lucas has obviously forgotten the concept of less is more.  There was just too much digital creation, it almost felt like watching a cartoon.  To evoke Dr. Malcolm in Jurassic Park, they were so concerned with whether they could do something, they didn't stop to think if they should.  There seemed to be many elements that were only there to show off digital technology than advance the story. The overall look of the film at times was very grainy, and some of the backgrounds looked like paintings.  It seemed like so many creatures and backgrounds had to be crammed in that nothing was used to its full potential.  Like the planet of water, Kamino, barely anytime was spent there.  All of the creatures were briefly spotligted instead of focused on.  There was nothing to develop a relationship with, especially when you think of how well planets like Hoth and Endor were used in the originals.
I did like the scene between Obi-Wan, Anakin, Count Dooku and (a little later) Yoda.  It reminded me of what Star Wars really should be.  I'm not sure we actually needed to see Yoda with a light saber, but it was okay.  I actually wanted to see Anakin with the two light sabers a little longer.  Overall, however, it was probably the best scene in the movie.
I have no hope left for Episode III.  It would be good if Lucas got better help with scriptwriting.  Maybe the characters and relationships could be developed a little more, and the lame jokes left out.  I won't criticize the actors for ""bad performances"" because I truly don't think they are at fault.  They are the victims of bad screenwriting and lazy directing.  Or maybe it's that the director has become so obsessed with his special effects everything else is secondary.  Maybe he should just make Episode III fully animated.",1022112000,5,3232,4.561739130434782
1323184,1,B00003CXKT,"It's no joke.  Let me explain: at least in the Phantom Menace, new actors reading their cue cards portraying familiar roles had some novelty value. But in Attack of the Clones, novelty is gone and viewers are left only with repeated reminders of how poor Lucas' ability to direct real actors actually is.
And the story?...there isn't one. Unless you consider ""go to planet Buffoon and protect the CGI inhabitants"" - which the characters then go ahead and do - a story. But the worse bit of writing has to be the love interest that develops between the altruistic princess after Anakin Skywalker confesses to slaughtering a small community of women and children to avenge his mother!  Come again???
So all we have left is the effects to carry the movie, and these too are mundane and poorly executed at critical moments. Yoda's movement is smooth and synthetic, as are the numerous outcasts from Jurassic Park.  George: do us a favor and title the next movie ""Return of the stop-motion Puppets.""  A scene where Anakin rides a rock-like creature in the romantic sequence of the ""movie"" was as bad as any fifties giant insect cut-and-paste.
Finally, all battle sequences which involve more than two characters quickly result in chaotic direction where it's hard to tell what's going on.  Starship Troopers handled this type of situation far more effectively, and realistically for that matter.
But a few of C3P0's one liners may save the movie: when his head is being dragged through the sand, he exclaims ""what a drag"" follow by ""I'm just beside myself"" when reunited with his body.  Do yourself a favor: leave then!",1022112000,16,1614,4.850909090909091
1323185,5,B00003CXKT,"Never having seen a Star Wars film before due to my deep-deates hate of sci-fi, i went to see this cautiously. (I was bored, and friends were going, so i tagged along.) And i was definitely not disappointed.
This is a very good movie, full of all sorts of good elements. Action, intrigue, love, suspense. I was impressed with the way all these elements were handled and mixed in with one another.
In terms of visuals, this movie is only beaten by Lord of the Rings. The graphics are good, if not sometimes a little...obvious.
Lots of people have said that this film is not as good as the original trilogy. Well, if that is true then the original trilogy must be excelleny. (Which wouldn't surprise me.)
Even I, who have never seen a Star Wars movie before, do know the basic plot. (I.e. that Anakin become Vadar, who in turn is the father of Luke Skywalker, etc.) Anyway, Anakin's anguish in this film is so brilliantly displayed, and it really acts as a brilliant showcase for all the reasons why he fell to the dark side. it is shown marvellously, and the beginnings of evil in his soul are only tantalisingly glimpsed, but they are definitely very present. Excellently done.
there are some incredibly sequences in this film. The one in the arena (al la ""Gladiator"") which really knocked my socks off. The one where Obi-Wan takes his first visit to the makers of the clone army (Who were brilliant characters, and i think really deserved a much bigger part in the film. they really would make great villains, i feel...those tall white ""things"".) The final huge battle between the clone army and the droids. The light-sare (so those are what all the fuss is about!) fight between Dooku (Christopher Lee = simply marvellous) and Yoda (+ the preceeding fights). It is, at times, simply amazing.
However, it does have flaws.
Jar Jar Binks. I didn't see him in the first film. He was supposedly annoying then. He had three lines in this film and i wanted to wring his stupid neck. I cannot imagine how he must have been in the first film with a larger role.
The humour. A big no no. I didn't feel it worked, and at times it was just embarassing. Ewan McGregor really didn't deliver many of his one-liners very well. Nor, at times, was his acting very good.
The acting wasn't first-class, to be honest. At times it was plain wooden. But then, i could cope with that.
Needless to say, those few flaws are nothing at all to spoil the enjoyment of this brilliant film. I shall now definitely be watching the other four films.
Well done George.",1022112000,,2536,4.5514223194748356
1323186,4,B00003CXKT,"I just saw ""Star Wars: L'attaque des clones"" last night (in Ste-Foy, Qubec) at a sold-out show (it was playing in English at the theatre next door but I opted for the French version instead). First of all, the theatre itself was an experience: an immense screen that looked as large as an IMAX screen, intense surround THX sound, and the digital picture (even at that size) was amazingly crisp, the colours vibrant, and the sound effects were ear-splitting and exhilarating (especially the moments of silence that preceded the sonic depth charge explosions!)
I have seen the other four Star Wars movies but avoided reading publicity and reviews for ""Attack of the Clones"" in order to enjoy every moment without worrying over a particular critic's faults with the film. This film is much darker than ""The Phantom Menace"" could have ever aspired to be. Lucas has moved from stilted, juvenile scriptwriting on ""TPM"" to (still) stilted, mythological, more adult scriptwriting on ""Attack of the Clones."" Here we see Anakin as a headstrong, angry, frequently obnoxious young adult who loves backtalking, disobeying orders, and getting his way--a most dangerous thing when you are destined to become the most powerful Jedi of all time.
The dialogue is very politically minded (I had to wonder at the ""separatist"" politics of the film, being in Qubec) and the romance scenes feel wooden and awkward, but Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen definitely have onscreen chemistry. (I have since read that Hayden purposely would flash a thumbs-up at the end of his takes so Lucas would have to reshoot the kissing scenes...I did get a laugh out of that.)
Jar Jar Binks has (thankfully) been reduced to a few mere minutes of screentime, in which he manages to be (awkwardly) regal and somewhat less annoying that in Episode I. My favourite part of the ""Star Wars"" universe has always been the astonishing variety of aliens and alien languages...when I was a kid I wanted to be the one that came up with all the cool sounding languages spoken in the film (I still do as a matter of fact).
As usual, Natalie Portman's costumes are to die for, incorporating Asian and European fashion influences while still managing to be gracefully fresh and exotic. Only one I could have done without was the black leather getup ---elbow-high leather gloves and a black leather bustier, yet she's telling Anakin she's not interested in a romantic relationship...riiiight (Curiously enough, Anakin wears black leather as well...and if you listen carefully you can hear a whole lot of leather creaking onscreen). Portman certainly runs around baring her abs-of-steel midriff for much of the film (along with being very braless in a very tight white jumpsuit, which I found tasteless and unnecessary...I mean, the costumers spent the last film and part of this one coming up with these gorgeous gowns and now they're raiding Lara Croft's closet?)
The CGI imagery was breathtaking, especially the chase through Coruscant, the clone army and all of the alien landscapes. John Williams' score incorporates themes from all of the previous ""Star Wars"" soundtracks, including the addition of a new love theme, ""Across the Stars."" The fight scenes were white-knuckle intense and had me on the edge of my seat. The battle scene with all of the Jedis of all different species was *awesome,* as was Mace Windu's (Samuel L. Jackson) purple lightsaber...a first in ""Star Wars"" history. And Yoda: we finally see him in action and understand why he is the greatest living Jedi. Another first: Yoda is completely computer-animated, and is extremely lifelike.
The French translation of the film was almost an exact translation from the English...I actually found that some of the dialogue flowed more smoothly in French. Understanding some of the alien accents (especially the metallic robot ones) was a bit of a challenge for me, but it adds to the fun.
Lucas has effectively planted the seeds for the next and final chapter in the ""Star Wars"" saga, redeeming himself from the sometimes mediocre acting, wooden dialogue and annoying creatures from ""The Phantom Menace"".
Episode II is full of treachery, death, assassination attempts, massacres, and battles between good and evil where right and wrong are sometimes obscured. Unlike Jake Lloyd, the child actor who played Anakin in ""The Phantom Menace,"" in Hayden we see Anakin torn between his inner feelings and his obligations as a Jedi...his romance with Padm, the (implied) massacre of the Tusken camp, and his defiance, all pointing to his shift to the Dark Side of the Force.
The film is rated PG, but it does contain some very intense moments: onscreen kissing and sexual tension of sorts, a decapitation, mutilation, creepy space caterpillars, a gladiator-style execution arena, a massacre and other intense battle scenes and that might be disturbing to younger children. But overall it is a very worthy addition to the ""Star Wars"" universe. Can't wait until Episode III!",1022112000,,4982,5.062043795620438
1323187,4,B00003CXKT,"Going in to ""Attack of the Clones"" (hereafter, AOTC), I wanted three questions answered before I decided if it was a worthwhile entry in the Star Wars oeuvre:
1.  DOES IT WORK AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN EPISODE 1 AND THE STORY WE ALREADY KNOW?
Yes.
Freed from the need for clunky exposition that throttled the first prequel, George Lucas gets down to business and tells the story he's wanted to tell along: How does Anakin Skywalker become Darth Vader?  Anakin is now grown, a 20-year old Padawan learner, with the skills to rival Yoda, and an ego the size of Everest.  The kid's psychology, his downward spiral, rears its ugly head in moments.  Enough to send knowing signals to the audience, but not enough to ruin the heroism that he must confront in this movie.  It's a fine line, and Lucas walks it nicely.
The father-son dynamic that propelled ""Empire Strikes Back"" to the top of the Star Wars heap turns up over and over here.  There's the obvious, as in Jango and Boba Fett's relationship.  And then there's the symbolic, seen in the line of Master and Padawan learner that is fully filled-in, reaching from Yoda down to Anakin, and beyond.  The atavism of the Jedi further broadens the timeless nature of these stories.  This is also the first time we get to see a full-blown Jedi army at work, and the effect is stunning.  Dozens of sabre-clad warriors battle in hand-to-hand combat, seemingly outnumbered, but never breaking a sweat.  And along the same lines, the impending fall of the Jedi (necessitating the later ""Return of the Jedi"") is foreshadowed.  We don't know how, but just seeing the subtle fear in Yoda and Mace Windu's faces, we know it'll be a powerful moment.
There are, as is par for the course in a Star Wars film, script problems.  The dialogue, not nearly as clunky as it was in Episode 1, is problematic, but less of a problem than the handling of the story.  At times Lucas has many juggling balls in the air, and he struggles to keep them aloft.  I wish that Lawrence Kasdan had been available for re-writes.  Or better yet, he should have hired the king of snappy dialogue, logical story construction, and genre mixing (this is a ""space opera"" after all), William Goldman.  Lucas gets credit for creating this universe that has us so involved, but the way he tells this story is often confusing (most confusing is the film's title, which, besides being a bit cheesy, is also a misnomer... for now, that is).  That being said, the combustible narrative moves forward at a satisfying hyper-drive pace.
2.  DOES IT WORK AS AN ENTERTAINMENT, IN AND OF ITSELF?
Yes.
The action scenes are thrilling, set against more stunning, CGI-created architecture.  A speeder chase through the rush hour traffic on Coruscant rivals (and even trumps) the pod-racing scene from Episode 1.  The love story, while pedestrian, is handled well.  Its awkward glances, gorgeous backdrops, and cautious kisses overshadow the sappy dialogue.
All of the actors do better work here than they did in Episode 1 (where there was enough 'wooden' acting and 'tin' dialogue to make one think of Jack Haley's ""Wizard of Oz"" character).  Ewan McGregor manages to do a better Alec Guinness impression just by adopting his natural voice than the bad imitation he had in Episode 1.  Obi-Wan Kenobi, in his hands, is an intriguingly flawed character.  Ewan shows his power, and then his frustration, especially when dealing with Anakin's strong-headedness.  Natalie Portman, freed (mostly) from her awful headdresses and her automaton vocal delivery, is a beguiling young Senator.  And she even gets to kick some butt in the final battle (complete with bare midrift.  Growl!).  Hometown hero (he and I grew up in the same Toronto suburb) Hayden Christiansen does awfully well, essaying Anakin's already mature ego, and his growing anger.  It's a complex character, although not necessarily written with much complexity, and Hayden does the brooding teenager act quite well.  He makes the audience like Anakin, while they also fear what he is to become.  The scene where he finally lets out the anger within, and its self-realizing aftermath, is handled extremely well.  Christiansen play both rage and fear in equal amounts, struggling with the notion that the character is turning into something vile (akin to Henry Fonda's character from ""Once Upon a Time in the West"") but powerless to do anything about it.  A slight quibble with these scenes: John Williams' ""Vader"" theme blares from the soundtrack a little too obviously.  Eventually, this musical cue will become necessary.  But at this time, it just seems forced (no pun intended).
All of this is moot however, for there is one scene here that makes the whole enterprise worthwhile.  It features a sabre duel between evil Count Dooku (a regal Christopher Lee) and a certain green octacentenarian with pointy ears.  The duel is set up perfectly, teasing the audience, knowing that they've been dying to see this since 1980.  My only complaint is that the fight is over much too quickly.  I could have watched this whirling dervish act till the end credits rolled (full disclosure: after sneering at the geek behind me who clapped at the opening Lucasfilm logo, I found myself, not two hours later, applauding this scene unselfconsciously).
3.  DOES IT IMPROVE ON 'THE PHANTOM MENACE'?
Yes.  And how!  I'd even go so far to say that AOTC justifies the existence of Jar Jar Binks!  A feat once thought impossible. (Jar Jar has a much smaller role, but one that is actually significant to the plot.)
So, despite some sloppy storytelling, AOTC is most definitely a worthwhile Star Wars movie.  It not only makes me long for the day when Episode 3 is released, it is such an effectively executed puzzle piece that I can't wait for the time when a complete six-movie, thirteen-hour Star Wars marathon is possible.",1022112000,2,5850,4.8587285570131185
1323283,2,B00003CXKT,"When the original Star Wars came out in the 1970's it was new and refreshing.  The sets were awesome and the characters three dimensional although either good or bad.  Regardless, the movie stands the test of time and brings the viewer in to the action.
Alas, Attack of the Clones does none of these things.  Since George Lucas has LucasFilms at his disposal as well as his special effects company, he can do anything he wants to do - apparently - anything, that is, except write a script that is worth watching.  Even the most special effect laden film must have characters that the viewer cares about and a story that involves the viewer.  This doesn't.
There are tons of special effects and they're really quite great.  Hayden Christensen is model-beautiful, but lost - I would assume because most of what he is playing to is green and blue screens.  Samuel Jackson seems out of place and McGregor does his best against hackneyed scripting.
Frankly, the whole script is lacking.  When C3PO does a riff on the Medic Alert bracelet commercial by saying, ""I've fallen and I can't get up"" you know Lucas is trying to hard to make the film cute and current (two things it should not be).  Another example of bad scripting is when Amidala talks about something or someone being, ""dreamy""... That word is already dated.  The spaceships look like throwbacks to what in 1935 Popular Science envisioned cars to look like in the 21st century.
I know that this film's satisfaction level doesn't matter in the grand scheme of world events, but Lucas started something back in the 1970's that he promised to complete.  Now he says the final 3 episodes won't be made - okay that's fine - but does he have to make the ""prequel"" episodes so syrupy and silly?  It seems to me that episodes 4,5,and 6 are ""real"" films, while thus far, episodes 1 and 2 are sci-fi lite.",1022112000,54,1852,4.612804878048781

I have read reviews from people saying the actors were ""wooden"". I have to disagree. In any Star Wars film, the acting/dialogue take a back seat to the action and special effects.

1323287,3,B00003CXKT,"All you really need to know is that this one is aimed at young teens.  The last one was for little boys.  The latest is about as good or bad as the last one.
We went to see it in a non digital theater.  I don't even think they have stereo.  At any rate under those conditions it looked like the last Star Wars which was itself a new standard of special effects anyway.  It looked like Lucas used all the stuff he developed for the last one over again.  I'm sure it will be used for the next one too.
In the last film the enemy soldiers were machines.  In this film the bad guys are developing an army of clones.  The implicit message equates the killing of clones with the killing of machines.  Apparently George has done some heavy thinking on this and clones have no souls.  This film will be an interesting historical artifact if the world is someday populated by a finite variety of clones.
The main conflict in the movie is that a number of star systems want to secede from the empire.  I thought, Hmmm, a Yankee message here.  But then it turns out that it's the Unionists who have been infiltrated by the Dark Side of The Force.  So once again we are happily sympathetic to the Rebs in accordance with Hollywood tradition (see every Western ever made).
So the force has a dark side but it's not clear that the non dark side is benevolent.  It's seems neutral, sort of like a cosmic battery you can hook your favorite appliance up to.  Actually it's not clear to me that the dark side is evil.  It's followers are distinguished by dark clothing and sinister voices.  For all I know they're just blues fans.
It was incongruous to see Samuel L. Jackson as a Jedi Knight.  Being aware of him primarily from 2 Quentin Tarantino films each line of his dialogue seemed incomplete.  They lacked his trademark punctuation: ""May the force be with you... ...!

The whole Jedi schtick is a kind of dime store bastardized Zen in which the Jedi connect with the force by turning off conscious thought.  The oft repeated advice to the student knights is, Remember, don't think, learn to trust your ""feelings,"" then your actions will be guided by the force.  That's very contemporary, ""don't think.""
Don't think.
See the movie.
Don't think.
Buy the merchandise.

One thing you have to do is just simply accept that Lucas' dialogues are gonna be cheesy. me and my friends made fun of the cheesy romantic dialogue after we saw the film opening night. but making fun of the dialogue made the film more enjoyable.
I was very pleased that R2D2 and C3PO were brought back for their comedic roles, which were absolutely hillarious!
and i agree with many who have said that the last 45 minutes or so finally brought back some of the magic missing in the Phantom Menace, but sparkled throughout the first three films.
And who can say anything bad about Yoda showing up at the end and proving why he is Master Jedi.

1323289,4,B00003CXKT,"Nothing will quite equal the amazing experience of seeing the opening scenes of ""Star Wars A New Hope"" on opening night in 1977.  Sadly, far too many fans and critics who had that joyous experience long, long, ago still hope that one of the newer episodes will repeat that feeling...none of them will, or can.  And that was the beauty of that film and the challenge for the others.  Oddly enough, while the original experience cannot be recreated there have been wonderful developments in the Star Wars series; indeed, several of the later episodes have actually been better films than the original. Perhaps the best of the series was ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" but much more than ""New Hope"" it demanded other films to continue the story.  This brings us to Episode II, ""Attack of the Clones."" Much as I hoped to repeat the rush of 1977, and again hoped that ""Empire"" might be equaled, Episode II was not quite up to the task...but that would be asking quite a bit. Sadly, none of the later episodes, ""Attack"" included will ever be judged on their own merits, (this was especially true with Episode I, ""Phantam Menace"")and that is too bad.  In terms of film making, ""Attack"" is a marvel to look at.  George Lucas contiues to take great risks in this capacity.  New special effects, new digital systems, all to go with earlier contributions in visual and sound effects that have revolutionized the industry. ""Attack"" certainly continues this tradition in technical aspects to an extent that should not disappoint anyone.  This film is a feast for special effects.  The story picks up as expected.  There is no mystery here. We know what will happen...the Republic is doomed.  The fun is in watching the events unfold.  The romance of Anakin and Padme is something of a necessary distraction and is handled well enough in this episode, in fact, it must be said that it works through some deft editing, without slowing the fun too much.  John Williams' score again warrants high marks. His new love theme is wonderful and is used in various ways in the film.  But what is most interesting is Williams' use of older themes to create a growing musical tapestry. These themes are so familiar that they now help in the story telling.  When this series is finished, Williams'""Star Wars"" score will be an achievement in and of itself.  Again, the familiar characters are joined by new ones, and here there is an interesting development.  A new Sith apprentice appears with Count Dooku (Darth Tyranus)as portrayed by Christopher Lee, who appears to be having the professional time of his life (Darth Tyranus and Saruman in ""Lord of the Rings,"" all at the same time.  There have been criticisms of the acting, and the script, but one should remember an old addage about films in this general genre...relax in your seat and don't ask too many questions.  This is a significant film and will, most probably be ranked third in this series, possibly tied with ""New Hope"" but just behind ""Empire"" and that is no small achievement.  Most of all, this entry will hardly dampen expectations for Episode III, indeed, the stage is now well set.",1022112000,,3123,4.769516728624535
1323290,2,B00003CXKT,"I can't put it any other way but to say I was truly disappointed by this movie. I loved the Phantom Menace and I was really looking forward to the sequel. But after watching Attack of the Clones, the first thing which came to my mind was ""Is this it""
First of all the movies biggest problem was Anakin Skywalker played by Hayden Christensen. If you thought Jake Lloyd was obnoxious and irritating in TPM, then multiply the factor by 10 for Hayden Christensen in ATC. In TPM Anakin seemed to be a man in a child's body. In ATC Anakin seems to be a boy in a mans body. ....
And the romance. Oh my goodness, It is vrais fromage (true cheese) if I ever saw it. Never mind that the lines were silly and over the top. Christesen and Portman have no chemistry whatsoever. The romance is not believable. Are we supposed to believe that a strong, dignified and smart young woman like Padme Amidala would really fall in love with (or put up with) immature Anakin? Another instance is their scene after Anakins mothers death. Portman's behaviour towards him is totally out of character. Most of their lines to each other in the movie made me cringe. Ten year old Lloyds lines to Portman (Are you an Angel?) had more resonance than Christensens.
During a great portion of the movie I was bored to tears primarily during that battle scene inside the Roman like Coliseum. It simply seemed to be violence and mayhem for violence and mayhem sake. Yes and I agree with another reviewer, the Yoda fighting scene looked like a sight gag.
I can not bash the movie entirely. Natalie Portman was excellent once again as was Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson. The political intrigue was interesting and I thought it was really neat the way the delved into the workings of the society including The Jedi order. I also liked the sets, the artwork and the cinematography.
I was going to see this movie again just to pick up on the political intrigue but now that I've thought about it I've decided that there is no way I can sit through this travesty again. ...
I can only recommend this film to hardcore Star Wars fans. ...",1022112000,,2100,4.471354166666667
1323291,5,B00003CXKT,"I admit: I really wanted to like The Phantom Menace. Even after I had seen it a couple of times, and I had read all those bad reviews pointing out all the kiddie dialogue and humor in it (was there really any point of having that scene where the animal in front of Jar Jar on Tatooine farts?), I still couldn't come to terms with how disappointing the movie was. I walked into Episode II with the dreaded feeling that this was going to be Episode I all over again. However, as the end credits rolled, I felt satisfied.
In case you don't know, Episode II depicts the beginning of the Clone Wars, and young Anakin Skywalker's descent into evil/the Dark Side. Thankfully though, both the former and the latter are pulled off quite well. The love scenes between Anakin and Padme are not as terrible as everyone had made them out to be, and although when I saw Anakin's temper tantrum on Tatooine in the 'Clone War' trailer, I felt like laughing, when I saw it in the theater, the scene works much better when put into its context.
Hayden Christensen is great as Anakin; it's no wonder why the people over at Lucasfilm saw something special in him. I can't wait to see how he does in Episode III. Meanwhile, Natalie Portman looks absolutely exquisite in this movie. She is quite possibly the hottest girl in sci-fi. Oh yeah, her acting is good too. Seriously. As for other characters, Christopher Lee uses what little lines he has to the fullest extent. Ewan McGregor finally gets the attention he deserves after how little of a role he had in Episode I; and although I sort of missed the old puppet Yoda, the lightsaber battle between him and Count Dooku was the coolest thing I've seen in a long while.
Bottom line, if you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? I can't wait until Episode III... the excitement is building up.",1022112000,4,1833,4.491017964071856
1323292,4,B00003CXKT,"From all the ** star reviews I read I didn't expect much but after I saw Attack of the Clones I've come to realize that their must be a lot of boring people out there because this movie rocks!  Sure it has it's flaws, some bad dialogue being pretty slow and sort of uneven, other than that I really liked it. I found that Hayden Christopher and Natalie Portman's chemstry wasn't as bad as I heard either, it's not as good as the chemestry Tobey Maguire and Kirstin Dunst had in Spiderman but still it was ok. I admit their lines to each other were hard to sit through at first but I got into the whole romance thing by the end. Some people had a problem with Yoda fighting as well, saying it was out of character but who cares, it's entertaining. Plus I'm sure a lot of StarWars fans such as myself have been wanting see Yoda wielding a Lightsaber.
  None those reasons it has been given so many 2 star reviews are good ones.  I think it's an awesome movie and a StarWars fans dream come true. You got some insight into Boba Fett's past, mystery and intrigue, a lot of Jedi lightsaber action, cool creatures and not a lot of Jar-Jar. I am baffled that Clones has been called better than Phantom Menace yet it has gotten undeserved lower reviews than it. It's the best StarWars movie since The Empire Strikes Back in my book. It has all the needed StarWars qualities that Episode 1 was lacking, even has a lot of the original trilogy musical score by John Williams that the first was missing as well. Also I must mention that I enjoyed Samuel Jackson as Mace Windu this time around mostly because he gets to kick some butt at the end, he's no Yoda but he's cool, lol. Chrstopher Lee as Count Dooku is very  good as well, yes even better than Darth Maul.
  All in all I must say I was blown away and can't wait for Episode 3 but for now at least we have The Two Towers and The Return of the King to look foward to till then.",1022025600,3,1922,4.206521739130435
1323371,1,B00003CXKT,"Alright, critics, you can all kiss my honey buns, cause you don't know the half of it.  To call this movie bad is to insult truly bad movies, like Battlefield Earth.  Calling this movie bad is considered sacrilege in some places.  In fact, calling this movie anything is sacrilege.  Heck, seeing this movie should be an exercise in torture.  They could call it Chinese Clone Torture or something.
How did George go so horribly wrong?  From Worst to Worse?  Every part of this movie was awful, from the casting to the acting to the dialgoue.  Even the movies much hyped fight scenes weren't up to Phantom Menace standards (if only because Chris ""Count Dooku"" Lee is a dinosaur...ironically, his movie Sith name was Darth Tyranus).  Sure, Yoda did get to fight.  Or did he?  All I saw was some sort of furry creature on acid, a scene much reminescient of the Monty Python scene with the Killer Rabbit.  Thats right.  Awful.  As I was in a jovial mood when I saw this [junk], I was able to laugh at it.  And laugh I did.  Whenever Anakin opened his mouth to spew some new drivel, (You've grown to, grown more beautful I mean) I just had to burst out.  Whenever Padme did anything that was not a deliberate sexual act (""Are you okay?"" Im fine, lets find a ship""), out with the giggles.  Never before have I seen such horror in the movies.  Never.  Not even Samuel L. Jackson could save this sinking ship.
I reccomend Star Wars Episode II to anyone who is depressed with comedies today, as this movie will make you laugh for hours.  I'm sitting here typing this, and I'm snickering, almost five days since I saw the movie.  Yes rush out to see this, give George Lucas your money, buy his toys, obey my dog.

1323372,2,B00003CXKT,"Even after forgiving Lucas for abrupt and irritating changes in tone, in mood, in dialogue, in acting, in CGI, and in plot relevance, this is still bad. It was intended to be very political, but it's not intelligently written. It was intended to convey a character arc, but it wasn't scripted compentently. None of the characters are likeable, they are just cardboard. It's Star Wars - Disney style.

When we finally see the Clone Wars, our heroes just FLY RIGHT PAST THEM, and instead we see a conveyor belt platform game, and a goofy arena battle - none of which has anything to do with this plot. Lucas seemed to think any random idea, or movie tribute he had in mind would somehow serve the story, and it doesn't. He leans too hard on Anakin as James Dean, and we never see him as a powerful threat himself. He's a joke, and his romance is a joke. As a result of this, this entire trilogy falls apart. I'm a fan of this concept, but god, it's so long and boring!

I saw a 10 year old crippled kid w/crutches speak to his dad about the Yoda scene, the one everyone laughs at, where he drops his crutches and uses the force to be upright long enough to fight 'Count Dooku', he said he ""really liked that movie"" and that reminded me of what GL is doing right.",1022025600,4,1260,4.312236286919831
1323373,5,B00003CXKT,"OK, kids, first of all, forget all the junk you've ever heard from movie critics.  Clear your mind from those reviews written by the same people who vote on the Oscars and have never given Star Wars more than a special effects award.
Attack of the Clones seriously ROCKS!  The effects are wonderful.  Personally, I thought the script was great.  If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll get a lot of double-entendres that made the 12:01 AM crowd roll in the aisles.  The love story is beautifully tragic--John Williams' theme gives me goosebumps every time I hear it.
This makes Phantom Menace a better movie and starts to tie the story together.  The plot moves along quickly.  No one should be bored at this movie unless they have no attention span whatsoever.
In my recent experience, the reviewers who pan the film as illogical or the love story as too regretful don't understand the Star Wars saga completely or haven't watched the movie carefully.  It sounds biased, but in a sense, you really do have to love and know about SW to appreciate what Master Lucas has done with this one.
Hayden Christensen and Ewan McGregor stood out for me as far as acting.  Anakin is just how he should be: dangerously violent, attractive and vulnerable.  Obi-Wan, as the too-trusting mentor who can't see tragedy approaching adds another element of pathos to the story.
It's almost too dark for its PG rating, however.  The MPAA is pushing the envelope here, especially since certain scenes eerily recall what happened on September 11, 2001.
Please don't listen to the sticks in the mud.  This isn't Moulin Rouge, for which I am profoundly grateful, and so of course it's going to get burned critically.  Be independent!  See it yourself!

1323374,3,B00003CXKT,"I, like a lot of Star Wars fans, was waiting for this movie to blow me away after the relative disappointment of Episode One, and, frankly, I walked out of the theater feeling about as ambivalent about this one as I had with ""Phantom Menace.""  The special effects and action sequences are great, of course, but the acting is weak, even by Star Wars standards.  The romance between Anakin and Padme seems forced and unconvincing.  Hayden Christiansen makes a good Anakin Skywalker, I think, but his performance lacks the passion he displayed in ""Life as a House.""  Worse, his character comes off as really whiny, while Obi-Won comes across as kind of a jerk.
Other disappointments:
-The actress who played Anakin's mom in Episode One, and gave one of the better performances in that movie, is hardly present in this movie, and her death scene lacks drama.
-silly things like bad punning from C-3PO, the 50's style diner on Coruscant, Padme leaving her window open when she knows someone is trying to assasinate her, Obi-Won needing a kid to figure out what happened to the missing planet, Kid Boba Fett's evil laugh.
-Even sillier, the light-saber duel between Yoda and Count Dooku.  It seems to be a crowd-pleaser, but it reminds me of the fight between Mini-Me and Austin Powers in ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" more than anything.
Many people are comparing this movie with ""Empire Strikes Back,"" and it does remind me of that movie in the sense that it's a totally different experience from the last movie, and it's more a series of action sequences than a well-defined story.  I think that I'll enjoy it more on subsequent viewings, having acknowledged my disappointments from the start.  I think that other hard-core Star Wars fans who are crowing about this one now and are in denial about the weaknesses of the movie will start ripping it after they've seen it twenty-odd times, as they did with the previous movie.",1022025600,14,1916,4.770392749244713

i liked Christopher Lee and Natalie Portman...Ewan McGreggor is one of my favorite actors I just wish he was given more credit and was given some better roles...night watch was so not like him. This film is great and in comparrison to Episode 1...I think that i would definatly have to see this again to remind myself it is the back story of the last movies (the first that came out) and I think I want to read the books that were based on the movies.

1323376,2,B00003CXKT,"Let's start with my background, I'm an admitted Star Wars geek.  I camped out overnight for tickets to see Episode I in my Maul facepaint, and I've lost track of the number of times I've seen the original trilogy.  So watching Episode II I was as open-minded and enthusiastic to enjoy this movie as I could be, complete in my Vader outfit with lightsaber.  I was sorrofully wrong.
Let's start with the basics:  THE JEDI.  In ""Empire"" Yoda tells us that the Force unites us, binds us, and what luminous beings we are.  Well, in Episode II the Jedi seem to have forgotten this.  They're police officers with lightsabers.  Nothing more.  The ""religious"" aspect is erased as if it never were.
The mythology is also gone.  I guess Joseph Campbell's teachings were lost on Lucas when writing this.  It's just a series of random event after random event.  Anakin getting his arm stapled to a conveyer belt.. WHY?
But let's get to the juicy details, shall we?
DIALOGUE: Whoever said the dialogue in this movie sounds like Shakespeare should be slapped silly.  It's HORRIBLE!  Tacking on ""m'lady"" at the end of a horrible sentence maketh not Shakespeare!  The fact that most lines are delivered with no emotion and gives you a recipe for corny atrocities and a lot of painful watching.  The classic lines such as ""Your thoughts betray you"" and ""Be mindful of your feelings"" are delivered over and over and OVER again.
ROMANCE: This movie has romance?  It's more like Al Gore and Michael Dukhakis reading bad poetry.  NO emotion whatsoever.  I'll grant Hayden that he tries so hard to make these horrible lines work.  ""I've been dying every day since you came here."" *YAWN*  ""My heart is a black hole of torture with foul robots kicking me in the ...""  Yea, George, great dialogue.  Atrocious.
ANAKIN:  I was hoping we would see his descent into madness with this film.  Do we?  NO.  We see him whine.  Again and again.  ""You're holding me back!"" ""I want my mommy!"" ""It's all your fault!""  on and on and on.
PACING: Is this movie paced?  I would have never known from watching it.  The first hour or so is pure drama, and the last half is one nonstop torture session in how ridiculous things get.  Episode I had pacing. The finale, for example.  Excellently switching between the Maul fight and the space battle.  Episode II just pours it on, and the result is so horrible.
Let's look at some really bad action sequences:
R2 with Jets.  WHY?  He doesn't have them in Episodes 4-6.  Why did Lucas think it would be so cool to have them now?
The big fight.  Is it just me, or do all the Jedi forget how to use the Force?  and I'm supposed to believe that the dumb droids from Episode I can kill Jedi in a tight circle formation?  No wonder Palpatine wants them dead.  They stink!
The vehicles completely lack heart, and the big ship fighting sequence is so emotionally empty I was actually BORED.  I went to this film pumped up in my Darth Vader garb, and I was actually BORED!  and Lucas's attempt to keep my attention by having Natalie bare her tummy was a feeble mind trick that didn't make me forget the movie stunk.
YODA: He went from Ghandi-esque Guru to ... Matrix spinoff character.  His big scene is so absurd I was laughing AT it, not with it.  Episode V's Yoda is NOT the Yoda we see now.
Conclusion: Ewan, Ian, and Shaft do an admirable job trying to salvage this movie from George's insanity, but ultimately fail.  Spiderman and Fellowship of the Ring are two films that blow this one away in terms of completeness...  They prove a movie can have heart, action, romance, comedy, and special effects.  Star Wars has 1 or 2 of these at most.  And if you don't believe me, watch Spider-man right after you see Clones.  You'll realize Episode II is a clone, alright.  Just not of Star Wars.",1022025600,66,3787,4.5266272189349115
1323377,1,B00003CXKT,"This movie was horrible!
Is there more I could say? Yes. Does it deserve more? No, not really. A more thorough review would begin with...
I tried not to get my hopes up for this one, but I was at least expecting a better movie than ""Scorpion King."" Boy was I wrong. Then all the reviewers said this was a lot better than Episode 1....boy were they wrong too. Episode 1 was far more exciting, fun, suspenseful, better paced, better acted, and even better animated. Now that last one might seem surprising. ""Better animated? Are you crazy?"" you might say. I will concede that the animation itself in Episode 2 is better than Episode 1, however it's alignment with the real actors, sets, and props is far worse than Episode 1. I don't know if Amidala or Yoda (or both) need their eyes checked, but they sure weren't looking at each other as they spoke together. And it seemed that half of the time, the Jedi in the arena scene were swinging their light sabers around defending and attacking against thin air. And the battle scenes at the end seemed ill paced, ill directed, and ill conceived.
Sure there are some good scenes. Anakin, the partly evil jedi, was the best part of the movie. The best sequence was Anakin finding his mother and going medieval, but this scene, which should have been a central part of the movie, was far too short and almost seemed like an after thought.
The light saber dueling at the end was also disappointedly short, and almost seemed like it was a spoof of itself. The factory scene was, by contrast, FAR too long and completely needless. Oh, but it is fitting that Jar Jar is used as a patsy to destroy the Republic. That was cool.
And I always assumed there were, like, a LOT of Jedi. This movie implies that there are about 20 active Jedi. In fact, you have to be a pretty lame Jedi to be active and NOT be a member of the Council. After this movie, I guess the ""Great Jedi Purge"" will only involve killing about 5-10 Jedi.
Overall, I was never felt ""invested"" in the story or any of the characters. I never felt excited, happy, or sad. I was only rarely and briefly entertained. And it is not the case that I had read spoilers before seeing it, because I knew about the same amount about Episode 1; and heck, I read the entire novel for Return of the Jedi before seeing that movie, and those movies still connected to me on an emotional level that this movie never reached. It is sad, but true, that the most exciting part of this movie was watching the end credits to see the name of an acquaintance as one of the programmers.
In my opinion, Lucas peaked as a director with Star Wars and has gone down hill since then. There is a reason he was the Producer of Indiana Jones movies and not the director. Same with Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If he was smart, he would produce and write the story for Episode 3, and let screenplay writer and director jobs go to other individuals.
Was it the worst move ever? No. Not that bad. Is it the worst of the 5 star wars movies thus far? Definitely.",1022025600,13,3039,4.361552028218695
1323378,3,B00003CXKT,"For a series of films that owe a bit to the western (especially the original movie), it seems appropriate to use the title of a classic western to run down the pluses and minuses of this work.
The good:  Attack of the Clones is a vast improvement over Phantom Menace, with a better story, better villains and less cuteness.  The special effects are spectacular as always, and the comic relief is where it belongs, with C3PO and R2-D2, not with the repulsive Jar-Jar Binks (who is fortunately limited to a few painful minutes).  My favorite thing, however, is a trip to Tatooine which brings us back to the original movie and its settings.
The bad:  The story itself is imperfect and not always well-paced.  There are some moments, especially a chase scene early in the movie, which are not overly exciting and look more like commercials for games (at least they are better than the interminable pod racer scene in Phantom Menace).
The ugly:  The romance between Amadala and Anakin is rather painful to watch, and I could never figure out what she sees in him (my guess is he is somehow using the Dark Side of the Force to subconsciously control her).  Besides the age difference, she is a sophisticated politican and he is a pouty warrior with principles in direct conflict with hers.  Besides the poor dialogue in these scenes, this romance is more than a little Oedipal, in that Amadala has filled the surrogate mother role in the past and as we know from the other movies, Anakin is destined to kill his two surrogate fathers (Obi-Wan and the Emperor).
Overall, this is an okay movie, probably three-and-a-half stars.  For fans of the Star Wars movies, it is worthwhile watching, but as a standalone movie, it is a bit weak.",1022025600,,1727,4.673267326732673

1323380,4,B00003CXKT,"This was a really good film but to me one scene should have been edited out and put on DVD for a great deleted scene.
  (spoiler) alert!
The scene with yoda using a lightsaber! No! No! it did not work for me. He is such a good mentor and intellectual character that he didn't really need to get into a lightsaber duel at all. The scene is great looking and exciting but far feched, If you ask me. I know most people liked it, but I felt that if George Lucas would have thought this out more he would have seen what I see.
  I think George is way better than anyone could be for these films and not downing him at all. If he would have stopped it with the force neutral scene between Dooku and Yoda it would have been enough. You don't need to see Yoda sport a saber even to prove his power!!!!
  I do think that it was way better than It could have been and it looked cool but was just too much.
  I also thought Hayden was very good as Anakin and my favorite seen was on Tatooine when he is telling Padme' why he did what he did with the SANDPEOPLE it was a VERY VERY GOOD scene and George should be PROUD! Obiwan was great and his battle with Jango was excellent! The arena scenes also excellent!
Droid factory scenes great and exciting. Air Taxi scene also good and the love story good. The C-3PO comic relief was very funny and made me laugh aloud!! The parts with his mother heart felt and well done.
  To wrap things up Samuel L Jackson was GREAT! as Mace and kicked tail.
  The lightsaber duel at the end was excellent and interesting
  and exciting, one of the best!

  I think the Yoda with a lightsaber thing will set in later and I will accept it, but for now GREAT MOVIE!
  With that single editing flaw!
  and maybe a little too slow for kids first half.
  Other than that Excellent Movie! Awesome action and effects!
  GOOD JOB LUCAS!

  I would also like to add I loved The Phantom Menace and liked Jar Jar Binks. I don't know what the big deal is with him.
  He worked better in TPM than AOTC though.",1022025600,,2016,4.134366925064599
1323485,3,B00003CXKT,"I must admit, I was a bit disappointed by Attack of the Clones.  The cast is great (especially Hayden Christensen as a wrathful and pugnacious Anakin Skywalker) and some of the special affects are phenomenal.  I especially enjoyed the early chase scene, which takes us on a dizzying ride through the streets of a galactic metropolis.  While the multiplicity of subplots keep the audience interested in the first half, many of the movies flaws become apparent by the half-way mark. The romantic scenes between Anakin and Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) are corny, and the dialog throughout the movie is cliched.  (Oh, that monotonous mishmash about the force and the dark side!) Some of the man-to-man fight scenes are so out of sync that one wonders if the shots were seized from an '80s video game. Some other fight scenes are just over the top.  For example, at one point, Yoda pulls out his lightsaber and incredulously metamorphoses from a cane-carrying, hard-breathing, furry ancient to a high school gymnast with more hop (and pop) than an energizer bunny running on steroids (or nuclear power!).
Take a look at The Hidden Fortress (Star Wars inspiration) by Akira Kurosawa.  The Japanese original is vastly superior even after 50 years. It puts Lucas and his special affects happy capering to shame.",1021939200,,1306,4.9953917050691246
1323486,4,B00003CXKT,"""Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" is FINALLY the film ""Star Wars"" fans have been waiting - 19 years now - to see! Though by no means perfect, and not quite at the level of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" or ""A New Hope"", it's damn close; it far surpasses the leaden (though strangely still watchable) ""Phantom Menace"" and the truly disappointing ""Return of the Jedi"". (Ewoks, anyone? Ugh.) Lucas' penchant for stiff dialog is of course present (compounded by the fact that, once again, normally very good actors are cast adrift having to perform against the blue and green screen backgrounds, essentially forced to direct themselves - Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, and the excellent Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson) but all the actors seem at least a bit more alive here, and are given much more to do. McGregor channels Alec Guiness with finesse, and Christopher Lee is a blast for his presence alone. (This marks a nice circle for the ""Star Wars"" series, as Lee's long-time Hammer Films co-star Peter Cushing appeared in ""A New Hope""). The quietly sexy Christensen does the best he can with little direction, and in fairness manages to give hints of the darkness to come, and Portman is blessedly freed of her Kabuki makeup and is allowed to show some humanity. Temuera Morrison, as Jango Fett, also scores nicely, bringing menace to both some great dialog and fight scenes. And thankfully, Jar Jar is limited to what amounts to a cameo. Without question, though, the best is saved for last; Yoda, lovably crabby as ever, is finally given a chance to rock and roll as the Jedi Master he is. This scene alone is worth the price of admission!
Lucas finally seems to have regained his sea-legs and, along with the very welcome addition of co-writer Johnathan Hales (who has, for the most part, successfully stripped out most of Lucas' more insipid dialog and ideas), delivered a terrific ""Star Wars"" movie. I'm sure I'm not alone in looking forward to ""Episode III""!",1021939200,2,1982,4.81524926686217
1323487,4,B00003CXKT,"The wait was finally over and Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones finally hit theatres.  And wow, did it surely not disappoint!  Comparing this movie to the Phantom Menace does not seem fair, but it is justifiable (because they are all part of the same saga, of course).  I won't reveal any of the plot.  I do not wish to spoil it for anyone, but if you want a plot synopsis...check some of the previous reviews.
First off - And I think almost everyone who enjoys Star Wars will agree with me on this one: Not too many scenes involving Jar Jar Binks!  True, he does appear but his role is very minimal.  So Lucas got it right on that one, right off the bat!
Second - The movie came together better than the Phantom Menace.  One of the things we want from these newer Star Wars film is the feeling of the old ones.  That is the reason why we love them so much, they give us this indescribable feeling.  Attack of the Clones had the feeling and the fluidity of the old trilogy.  You were not bored.  You were, in fact, enthralled.  The characters were wonderful and more lively than the first movie.  It had better and more mature humor than the first filmed attempted and failed at having.  The fight scenes were unbelievable.  And there was even a ""love"" and ""lover's quarrel"" type feel to it between Anakin and Padame (comparable to Han Solo and the Princess).
Third - Finally!  They are letting us in on the significance of Boba Fett and his father, Jango.  I, as many others, have been wondering the real significance of him.  Other than him being a bounty hunter for the empire.  So that was a well-welcomed edition to the movie.
Four - More Jedi action.  (I won't spoil it for the people who haven't seen it, but it was very entertaining to see two Jedis we haven't seen fight before, fighting.
To wrap it up, the movie was very pleasing.  The direction was great and not as showy as the Phantom Menace.  It was well-written and well-acted.  George Lucas regained the old Star Wars feel with this one.",1021939200,,2005,4.388586956521739
1323488,4,B00003CXKT,"This was a very good movie for those who like the Star Wars series, and there are many (how many movies warrant 5 in their series?).  It fills in many of the blanks, for instance how Darth Vadar lost his hand.  Where people that you have come to know in the past came from.  How the galaxies got to where they are.
This movie was long on plot (or filler for the confusion of previous movies) and shorter on action, but not very short of action.  The final battle scenes, the 'execution' scenes (very similar to ancient Rome) and the fabulous fight scene between 'Obi-Juan Kanobe', 'Anikan' and the current leader of the ""dark side"" of the force.
We find in this movie that Yoda is the man!  A great swordsman who I look for more from in the next movie.  Yoda is not only the most knowledgeable of all the Jedi but, almost certainly, the most accomplished warrior among the ""light saber"" swordsman.
The movie at times, will drag, for those who have not seen the previous Star Wars movies, but for those that have seen them, this movie will help connect the missing pieces.
View this movie - and enjoy!",1021939200,,1100,4.420792079207921
1323489,3,B00003CXKT,"I was disappointed in this move in a similar way to Phantom Menace. I felt a big strength of the original movie was the lack of dialogue. There was times when Obi-Wan and Luke were reflective, and The Force was a mystical thing that was not taken lightly.
The whole bar scene was a waste to me. The flying to chace down the assassin was a waste. I would have liked something more sinister, trying to show the ""dark side"" of the Capital city.
I felt the ""romance"" angle did not work at all for me. Very unbelievable with these actors. The rescue of Ani's mom was too contrived. Also, the ""picnic"" in the hills could have been cut (big waste of money). Also, the Yoda light saber battle was just too fake.
What did I want? I would like to have seen a guest ""ghost"" appearance my Obi-Wan's master. I would liked to have seen the young Obi-Wan learn from his mistakes. I think Ani's just too arrogant. The whole archive's plot was too childish. A typical librarian, with a plot that was similar to Logan's Run, Rollerball, and others. I expected something ""new"" from Lucas.
The plot is followed, and plodding along. Was there anything that was really a surprise to people? Anything that really made a difference? Okay, the source for the clones is a bounty hunter, and I was waiting to see where that was going to be a major element in the movie...it wasn't. Why did the hair style for Amadala move towards the Kerry Fisher look towards the ""romance"" scenes? With everything available in the advanced civilization, and they still used Tourister luggage? How did she get all those outfits in those small bags?
Okay you say, he's being way too negative for a 3-star movie. Well, I did like the story lines in places. I just felt like Lucas tried to commit too much on the ILM angle, and sacrificed the script to make it work. The characters are all 2-D, and the characters did not move me. I watched Star Wars 15-20 times. I do not feel compelled to see Clones again. I have only watch Phantom twice. I watch Empire 10 times, and Return of the Jedi about the same. I know Lucas has the ability to make something that is fantastic. He has the vision, the talent, and ILM. He was dealing with actors in Star Wars that could make you feel something with just the raise of an eyebrow. Is the actors trying to ""make"" something happen, or to ""be"" something? Harrison Ford showed us a rogue, a romantic, and explored multiple facets of the Han Solo character through out even the first Star Wars movie. Luke Skywalker grew from a naive farm boy, to take on a Sith Lord. Should we expect less from the characters on the screen today?
Watch the movie and you judge. Did Lucas surpass the industry, or is he just ""putting out movies""? He has more characters, more plots, more spaceships, more types of creatures, but are you getting more? Do you expect more? I do. I want to come out of the movie shocked by the surprise ending (""I'm your father Luke"").",1021939200,2,2937,4.440740740740741
1323490,3,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the clones is a very enjoyable movie but still abit of a let down..
The action scenes are brilliant but the downside is that there is just no real chemistry between the characters and that sense of bonding that the originals had just isn't there..
In the original trilogy everybody wanted to be Luke Skywaylker, Han Solo or Princess Leia but in this film the chracters just don't gel the same way..
Also the bad guys just arnt bad enough,
Darth Vader was just perfect and when you saw him you felt fear and his attempts at humor such as in Return of the Jedi he warns the commander of the Death Star that the Empror is not as forgiving as him..
Unfortuntaly neither Darth Maul or Count Dooku ( Darth Tyranus )even come close and when you see Chancelor Palpatine you just cant really think of him as the future evil emperor who shoots lightning from his fingers..
It seems that in Both Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones George Lucas seems to have concentrated to much on action rather the strengh of characters..
Its a defainantly better than Phantom Menace but its nowhere near as good as Empire Strikes Back..
George Lucas is going to have to do alot of work on eppisode 3 if he wants to equal the originals..
It is still a very enjoyable film though and defainlty worth watching even if its just for the fight sequences especialy final battle between Yoda and Count Dooku .. if you are expecting the little cheeky Yoda from Dagobah you are in for a shock this little guy really prooves why he is the most powerfull Jedi..
Basicly its a very good film but its still not good enough..",1021939200,2,1600,4.4271186440677965
1323491,2,B00003CXKT,"I'm not one to normally rate movies, but it seems like every movie that comes out now gets a positive endorsement from the critics no matter how good it really is.  Perhaps the same people that recommended Enron stock to the masses rate movies too.
Anyway, in spite of all the hype, I have to say that I really expected a bit more from this movie.  I like Lucas. I enjoyed all of the original Star Wars Trilogy, but this movie was not at all as entertaining as the first three. It seemed to be ""cloned"" parts of the originals with minor twists that were added for a feeble attempt at creating continuity, but it doesn't work.
While I have to admit that the special effects were quite good at times, the acting and storyline were predictable and well below par in my opinion.  Perhaps the novelty of Star Wars has faded for me now that I am in my late thirties.  My kids (ages 6 to 10 yrs) seemed to generally enjoy this movie, but I wish I would have spent my money on something else.  I guess I'm just thankful I didn't stand in long lines waiting for it like some other people did.",1021939200,,1083,4.237864077669903
1323492,5,B00003CXKT,"Quite possibly the best one yet.

All I can say is I am going back asap.",1021939200,7,394,4.430555555555555
1323493,5,B00003CXKT,"Episode 2 is everything I hoped it would be and more. The story shows us the turmoil in the senate, the believable relationship between Anakin and Padme, Anakin's conflict with the Jedi and it also has many subtle and prominent connections to episodes 4-6.
  This episode also has a lot of treats for fans. Namely Jedi and Bounty Hunting action. We see more of the Jedi temple, we see a spectacular battle involving more than a dozen Jedi in a small area (something we've never seen until now) and the pinnacle of it all is of course, Yoda. Yoda looks great. His character is very well done in this outing. Plus, we get to see him fight, which is a real treat and great fun to watch. Seeing Jango Fett in action is like fulfilling every Star Wars fan's fantasies about what Boba would've/should've been doing in 4-6. We never really saw Boba do much. But Jango goes all out. We see him fly, shoot and use all kinds of gadgets. His space battle with Obi-Wan in the debris ring is spectacular (this is where THX sound really pays off) Episode 2 leaves Star Wars fans satisfied in many areas.
  I was lucky enough to be able to see Episode 2 the way it's meant to be seen, on a digital screen. Digital projection is absolutely wonderful. The picture is crisp, no scratches, dots or dust. It's like watching a DVD on a huge screen only 10 times better. Digital projection combined with THX sound makes for the ultimate experience. It is my advice that you make the extra effort/time to find and get to a digital theatre near you. If you really care about seeing this movie in the best way possible, it's certainly worth the trouble.",1021939200,10,1628,4.453020134228188
1323494,5,B00003CXKT,"As with so many others, I was not significantly impressed by Phantom Menace.  While Episode I was meant to be an introduction to the fall of Anakin Skywalker, it was entirely too cutesy for my taste.  But enough about that and on to the present.  Episode II starts off with a bang and ends with so many questions to be addressed in Episode III (which only makes me wish for the next three years to fly by).  The action, plot, romance, and acting were all supurb.  I have always wanted to see Yoda be more than the wise philosopher that he has always been.  Only now as a totally computer generated character (unlike the puppet figure of the past) can his full range of potential be realized.  Watching Hayden Christensen begin to show the darkness and apprehension of Anakin was tremendous.  The chemistry between him and Natalie Portman was incredible.  The battle in the arena on Geonosis was amazing.  Seeing so many Jedi do battle was breath-taking.  Christopher Lee as Count Dooku harkens back to Darth Vader himself.  Just the voice reminded me of James Earl Jones.  You can almost hear the deep, dark, menacing breathing as Dooku urges Obi-Wan to join him.  All of this will undoubtedly lead to the climactic episode of the trilogy.  Will we see the birth of the twins?  Will we see the slaughter of thousands of Jedi?  Will Anakin be seen in total blackness of Vader?  And will we see a magnificent battle between Anakin and Obi-Wan?  I guess we will all find out in 2005.",1021939200,6,1480,4.580152671755725
1323564,5,B00003CXKT,"This movie is not only a more than worthy entry into the Star Wars saga, it represents nothing less than the very future of Cinema.
This is a movie that you MUST see as Lucas intended; on a massive screen with digital sound... but even more importantly, in a theatre that is projecting it digitally.
The visual images in Attack Of The Clones, when projected digitally, are awe inspiring.  The colors are so incredibly rich and the detail is breathtaking.  It's like watching real events through a window, almost like being there.  With digital projection there is no juddery movement when the camera pans, and there are none of the imperfections that come with film such as dust and scratches on the print etc.  All that is there is a crystal clean, amazingly vibrant image.
As for the movie itself. It pretty much rocks.  Sure some of the acting is wooden, and the script is a little lifeless sometimes but that really doesn't detract from the story itself, plus there are so many things that make up for the ""minuses"" that you almost don't notice the so called flaws.
This is a dark movie, far darker than Empire Strikes Back and it's actually quite chilling to see Anakin begin his descent into the dark side.
ATOC is thrilling, exciting and stunning to watch and the action scenes are easily the best ever in the series.  This is just what Star Wars should be.  Fantastic Entertainment!",1021939200,22,1390,4.648979591836735
1323565,5,B00003CXKT,"I was dreading this one after that wretched episode 1, but thankfully I was very wrong. I think from now on Starwars will be regarded as only 5 episodes.

1323566,5,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars Episode II can be described in two words, ""IT'S GREAT"". I've already seen it quite a few times and everyone loves it. I always loved Star Wars so my best friend and I personally preferred Episode I but this is great too. It's faster and the special effects are better. Former Queen Amidala is now a matured better-looking queen. The cast of Episode I had better acting performances from everyone but the humor and the massive destruction scenes make this movie great too. A lot of my other friends never ever liked Star Wars. For once (I was shocked) they loved a Star Wars flick. They are now crazy and are also Star Wars' [lovers]. It's thrilling, massive, faster and cooler than ever before! But Episode I gets the top Star Wars title having a better story, better acting performances, as well as better cinematography. Episode II is more a love-story and less a clone war. But then to continue the saga I guess Lucas had to add all these bits and pieces of romance in the movie.
  The action in this version was however faster than that of Episode 1's. I think the Yoda fight sequence was one of the coolest and funniest parts in the movie. Though the movie sort of stretched out in the middle, it didn't take it a long time to get back on track. Natalie Portman has a better role in this movie. Just like in Episode I, Ewan and Samuel as well as most of the cast made the movie one that will be successful due to the great collaboration. It's good to see a sequel so good that it would almost match up to Episode I just like Rush Hour 2 did except that Rush hour 2 made part 1 (Rush hour) look like the doldrums.

  Highly entertaining and faster than the eye can follow, this movie is one you should see. If you were always a Star Wars fan, an action/adventure film nut, like light humor, or silly shy romance, this is a movie you should see. Quite a few scenes that you shouldn't miss include the Yoda fight scene, Natalie Portman in action, and the city chase amongst quite a few others.
  The movie is definitely a must-see for ""Lord of the rings"", ""Star Wars Episode I"", and for ""The wedding planner"" fans. The movie hopefully will repeat the work it's predecessors have accomplished becoming (hopefully) 2002's biggest success. Although a lot of things I've said may make it look bad, it should still be watched on the big screen because it is a movie that you probably would love.",1021939200,2,2402,4.420814479638009

1323568,4,B00003CXKT,"I just went to see Episode II and I must say that I am very pleased.  The film has far surpassed my expectations, being an excellent epic action film.  The story spans a huge part of the galaxy, and things seem to tie together quite well.  This is the redemption of Star Wars that we have truly been waiting for since Empire.  Unfortunately, it is still missing some of the magic of the first two films, but it does manage to pull off a great performance.  Now for the criticism, which is what I do best:
Over-used CGI:
It looks like George Lucas discovered computer graphics and went overboard in including them into the film.  Every other scene has some CGI element in it.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of things in the film that seem to have CGI just because Lucas can.  While we don't have the 20 minute fiasco that was the pod race, we still have a few scenes that do no more than show off the pretty graphics of Lucas's computers.  Again, this is not nearly as bad as Episode 1, but it still feels annoying.
BAD CGI:
One of the most important elements of doing CGI graphics is making sure that your final result looks real.  The first step in this is to get great artists to design the characters in 3D and put textures on them.  This was done fairly effectively.  The next step is to get a crack team of animators to put realistic motion into the 3D models so as to make the motion look fluid and realistic.  To get an example of this, just check out Toy Story, Shrek, or Jurassic Park.  Unfortunately, it seems that Lucas ran out of cash and bought a bunch of high school animators to do the work here.  The motion is completely unrealistic and unbelievable time and again.  We're talking Greedo shooting first at Han Solo with his neck snapping off bad.  When Jurassic Park did their dinosaurs in CGI, they had the guys who used to do the physical clay models move them.  This is because they knew what real motion looks like.  The characters here look ridiculous.  In fact, they look like poorly made video game cutscenes.  The same problem happened with Final Fantasy: The Spirit's Within.  When are these people going to learn that you need to mimic the static look AND the motion of 3D characters.  Ugh.
PLOT HOLES:
Lucas has his work cut out for him in the next movie.  He didn't remove any of the plotholes from Episode 1, but added more plot holes into the series, most of which revolve around C3PO and Anakin Skywalker.  <SPOILERS FOLLOW> From Episode 1, we have C3PO knowing Anakin Skywalker but not knowing Darth Vader; and C3PO being built on Tatooine, but not recognizing it when he lands there later.  Now we have C3PO working on the Owen and Beru Lars's farm but not recognizing it when he works there later, as well as Owen and Beru not recognizing C3PO when they buy him in Episode IV.  We also have the issue of R2D2 having rocket packs to let him fly, Darth Vader knowing about Luke but not about Leia, Obi-Wan getting involves with Counciler Organa of Alderaan, and much else.  These are fixable, mostly, but will require a lot of work in episode three.",1021939200,5,3083,4.428063943161634

1323571,2,B00003CXKT,"Just saw it yesterday, and as a part of the saga, the plot developments and nostalgia warranted that I see this in the cinema -- however as a film it is as medicore as episode 1. This proved those who admired Lucas' desire for making a modern mythology were mistaken. The story ironically parallels Anakin's plight, Lucas wanted so badly for the saga to ""grow up"", that it ended up with doing just that, badly.
Stilted ensemble acting might be excusable for a novice crew, but for a veteran crew with great track record?
The ""post-modern"" quotation from the original trilogy's dialogue and visuals also falls flat. One of the freshest thing about the original trilogy was its innocence which departed from the self conscious cinema of the late 60s and 70s. But here, with Anakin ""quoting"" Han Solo's line, and the parallel of Anakin/Luke's lightsabre amputation seems contrived and cheese drenched.
HIs ability as a ""visual"" film director is called into question. Most of the effects setpieces are impressive esp. the car chase, fett vs obi wan. BUT I am still unconvinced by the CGI, esp. during the large scale battle, I felt that the CG were no more convincing than those in Final Fantasy, sure they are ""somewhat realistic"", but yet remain sure what is real and what is CG. It becomes quite distracing when ILM attempts to use digital stunts for Chris Lee and the Gladiator sendup, CG avatars DO NOT MOVE like people and the image mapping was unconvincing to say the least.
Lucas really tested my endurance as the ""visionary"" filmaker with more than 30 years of filmmaking experience ask us to sit through the cheesiest of pre-adolescent courtship scene in the last 50 years!
The Watefall / Sound of Music scene.
Chemistry = 0
Dialogue = -5
Delivery: Portman = 4, Christensen = 0, John Williams = 2.5
The CG background which seem to resemble those generic painted faux-art in cheap hotels or bad D&D fan art rendered in Bryce = -
That scene probably took what i considered to be a 3 star movie down by one star, as it is inexcusable for anyone but the hardest of the hardcore Lucas apologists.
The reasons for not making this a 1 star rating are Ewan McGregor and Christopher Lee.
2 down, one to go. May be Episode 1 was meant to be a bad movie so that Lucas would make the saga's fans rave with joy even if he come up with anything as medicore as this effort.

As a child, my happiest memories include my father coming home from work with a new Star Wars action figure for me to play with.  I spent hours reenacting the movies scene-by-scene.  As an adult, I have seen the trilogy more times than I can count, collected and read the books, the games, the cards, the comics, and the toys.  I read everything I can about Star Wars.  I even work on a Star Wars website.  So, was I going to see the latest installment of the series, Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones?  You bet your lightsaber I was!!
I'd seen the trailers, heard the hype, and heard the spoilers.  Was I excited?  You bet!  Was I disappointed?  NO WAY!!  The grin I wore on my face began when the title lit up the screen, and didn't leave my face until the movie was over!
The story begins 10 years after Episode I.  Natali Portman shines as Padme Amidala, who having served her 2 terms as Queen of Naboo, is now a Senator for Naboo.  Now she champions the cause against the Separatists, a faction rebelling against the Republic which is led by former Jedi Count Dooku (another excellent performance by Christopher Lee).  Hayden Christensen is completely believable in his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker, the padawan-who-would-be-Vader.  He is joined by Ewan McGregor, who reprises his role as Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.  When an assassination attempt is made on Padme's life, Chancellor Palpatine asks the Jedi Council to offer their protection, and Obi-Wan and Anakin are assigned to the case.  The awesome adventure spans several worlds as we learn who has ordered the assassination attempt, watch Anakin and Padme's love grow, and watch as the Jedi and the Republic defend themselves against the Separatist army.  Excellent action scenes include a fight between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, the Geonisian arena scene, and the much hyped Yoda fight scene.  This movie very well may be the best of the prequel trilogy.  With movie prices being what they are nowadays, I'm usually hesitant to view a movie more than once at the theater.  Suffice it to say, that I'm running, not walking to the theater to see Attack of the Clones again and again!  I can't get enough!!",1021852800,3,2337,4.6601466992665035
1323654,3,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones is supposedly the Empire Strikes Back of the new trilogy of Star Wars movies. It's supposed to be where we really get into the nitty gritty of what's going on with the universe and the characters. It even copies the basic structure of ESB: heroes start together, split up on their own adventures, come back together at the end. But let me tell you, this ain't no Empire.
I'll cut to the chase. Obi-Wan's half: good. Anakin and Padme's half: nothing short of horrific. Obi-Wan goes to mysterious locations, chats it up in a 50's diner (no, I'm not making that up), gets his Jedi kung fu on with Jango Fett, sneaks around in dangerous places, gets into tense situations, uncovers the machinations of the Sith, shows off that Ewan McGregor *is* Obi-Wan. Need I go on?
Anakin and Padme. Spout cringe inducing lines at each other and after a while Anakin gets into a hissy fit while you wait with growing impatience to get back to Obi-Wan's quest. Repeat for each scene. Anakin gets *one* good scene and it's the only real bit of darkness that's revealed in his character. Sadly, the scene is cut short. You see a brief hint of what he does, but then it's cut off and you have to settle for a description of what happened. It would have been nice to at least see the aftermath of Anakin's dark side moment, but sadly, no.
Oh yeah, pretty effects, blah blah blah. Mace Windu doesn't do jack once again. He gets an alright line and wastes one of the major baddies, but he doesn't have a lot to do. And honestly, the battle in the end just seemed to drag on forever. I'm not sure what it is, but I didn't feel any sense of urgency, any idea that this battle even mattered one way or the other.
One final saving grace I'll mention: Yoda is the [best]en you see him approach and you know that it's time for him to do battle, it's little girl squeal time.",1021852800,6,1865,4.362068965517241
1323655,5,B00003CXKT,"All I can say is that this movie was a complete turn around from Episode I.  The computer graphics were beautifully done, the battle scenes were amazing and the plot twisted enough to keep me interested and flowed so that it all made sense.
Lucas did a wonderful job of foreshadowing for the original three movies.  This movie seemed to run parallel to the design of the original three.  I was completely blown away.
  Regarding the storyline, plot, foreshadowing, character
  development, computer graphics, humor (not the Jar Jar

1323659,4,B00003CXKT,"This was one of two movies I was eagerly waiting for several months now. The movie was very good but not perfect. The best part was the special effects (unreal vistas that you have to see in the big screen) and the final battle scenes (think Gladiator meet Jedi). I especially enjoyed all the light saber fighting that occured between Anakin, Obi-Wan, Count Dooku, and Yoda. To talk more about Yoda he can kick butt in hand to hand and even directing an army.
The love story was for me a little rushed and to be honest seemed forced. But it works for me since most of my relationships seem to mirror Anakin! :)
Anakin is definately heading for the dark side and that was to me pretty interesting and something I look forward to checking out in more details in the next film.
The acting was alright (Ewan McGregor is Obi-Wan) the plot a little convulted but a lot better than Phantom Menace. The film for me seem to cater for die-hard fans of the franchise. My sister is a casual fan and she had no problm following it but she was bored in the first part of the film. It switched a lot from locale to locale which she didn't like but I found to be no problem at all.
The film overall was pretty good but I definately would not recommend it to little kiddies, there is no blood shown but a lot of heads are seen flying around in quick flashes but once scene though last longer and is a little disturbing. Now I have to wait three years for the next film. :)",1021852800,2,1455,4.237410071942446

1323661,3,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones
 A long time ago a great director named George Lucas created a groundbreaking trilogy in the sci-fi/fantasy genre.  He called it Star Wars and told it as the second trilogy.  Now he is creating the first trilogy and since we are at the mid-way point of the story arc it is easy to see that George has forgotten what made the magic of the first series.
 The Phantom Menace introduced the audience to Anakin Skywalker, better known as Darth Vader, as a child.  We also were given glimpses of a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and Princess Amidala.  Attack of the Clones brings us Anakin and the other characters 10 years in the future.  Amidala has become a Senator from her planet and Anakin is firmly entrenched as a student of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  They meet up again when Anakin and Kenobi are called back by the Jedi Council after a failed attempt on Amidala's life.
 Kenobi decides to follow up on evidence concerning a clone army being built while tracking the bounty hunter, Jango Fett, who launched the attack.  He reluctantly assigns his student to follow Amidala back to her home planet as a bodyguard.  Anakin is initially against this but realizes that his childhood crush on Amidala is becoming a more adult love so he complies.
 As Anakin and Amidala grow closer, Kenobi discovers all the information concerning the clone army and tracks the bounty hunter to his meeting with his boss Darth Tyrannous.  After Kenobi is captured, Anakin and Amidala decide to launch a rescue ahead of the Jedi Council team led by Mace Windu.
 We then see the might of the Jedi unleashed against an army of Droids and the arrival of Master Yoda at the head of an army of clones beginning the Clone Wars mentioned in the original Star Wars movie.
 This seemed to be very much two different movies.  The first half is a love story between Anakin and Amidala and the second half is a Star Wars movie.  The thing that worked so well in the original trilogy is the chemistry between the characters.  The three principals carried the movie and made you want to see each additional episode.  There is nothing like that in this movie.  The only characters that exhibit any chemistry at all together are C-3PO and R2-D2, which is a bad thing to say since they are DROIDS and contrary to popular rumor, this wasn't a love story about them.  Natalie Portman again plays Amidala and, while Natalie is a good actress, she has no chemistry whatsoever with her co-star.
Hayden Christensen is cast as Anakin.  In the future Vader was an imposing figure.  Right now, Anakin is played as a talented brat.  True, the seeds have been planted which will facilitate Vader's fall to the dark side but right now he seems more like someone who just needs his behind pattled.  Hayden Christensen has absolutely no concept of the character and can't play any type of menace.  He sulks but that is about it.
Perhaps it would be best to throw the blame also at Lucas as Hayden is mouthing the lines written and in that matter, Lucas has made major mistakes as the dialogue is atrocious.  It was almost agony to sit through some of the discussions between the characters, as everything seemed false and flat.
While the dialogue was absolutely awful and the actors need some serious re-casting, this was a visually exciting movie.  The space scenes, the battles, and the backgrounds are all breathtaking on the big screen.  Unfortunately the special effects didn't carry the first trilogy and Lucas really needs to remember that.
 The last portion of the movie does save things somewhat as we have an all out Jedi battle, which is entertaining to watch.  Finally Lucas has released Master Yoda and, like the Droids, Yoda steals the show from the human actors.  Lucas has a lot to make up for in the final movie and hopefully he will be able to do so.  Right now things don't look too good for the trilogy though.",1021852800,3,3902,4.625
1323662,5,B00003CXKT,"I will admit that when I went in to see Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, I was extremely nervous. Would my hopes of a darker, more intelligent Star Wars be crushed? Or would George Lucas succeed and gain me back as a fan of the Star Wars series?
  Short answer: George Lucas succeeded and gained me back as a fan of Star Wars.
  Long answer: Star Wars Episode II is what we've been waiting for- it gives you a feeling more like the one you got from THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK than from THE PHANTOM MENACE. For the whole 2 hour 20 minute movie, I was thrilled by the action, mystery, and romance the newest Star Wars gave.
  Jonathan Hales' contribution to the script brought the dialogue up a BIG notch from The Phantom Menace, although it still wasn't perfect(""The day we stop believing in democracy is the day it stops working""? Come on).
  All the performances were good, although Ewan McGregor's REALLY stood out. The special effects weren't greatly improved from The Phantom Menace's if you ask me, but, hey, they were still the best I've ever seen.
  One of the highlights of the film for me(besides seeing Anakin's arm get cut off, the arrogant apprentice deserved it)was seeing Yoda battle with a lightsaber. Last fall, when I heard this was going to happen, I started laughing uncontrollably. But, to my amamazement and pleasure, ILM pulled it off- Yoda rocked!
  If you haven't seen it yet, run to your nearest theater and see Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones- you will not even come CLOSE to being disappointed!",1021852800,,1540,4.58029197080292
1323755,1,B00003CXKT,"I agree with every mediocre to horrible review I've read so far.  I was extremely disappointed on opening day, and still feel a bit depressed by the whole thing.  The ""love story"" aspect was the least of its problems.  And for those of you who fault the acting, I do agree; remember though that Mark Hamill and Carrie Fischer had their moments of less than stellar performances. I'll try to summarize the reasons why I hated it (WARNING, SPOILER ALERT):
1. There is such a thing as CGI overkill. Many scenes were WAAY too busy to be comfortable for my eyes, and the scenes on Coruscant made me feel like I was watching Blade Runner, The Fifth Element, or Total Recall -- and dammit, I think Yoda looked better as a Muppet!
2. I thought that the scene on the conveyor belt in the droid factory was one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen --  I could almost hear the Bugs Bunny factory music (also used in Rush's ""La Villa Strangiato"")!
3. I can't picture ANY Jedi hanging out in a 50s-style diner.
4. Since when do Tusken Raiders kidnap, instead of burn & pillage?
5. ""Hi mom, you're alive!  Oops, wait, no you're not.""  Could we have maybe done a *little* more with that scene to make it believable?  The way it was handled, I didn't even CARE what happened to Shmi.
6. I have a hard time with the fact that all stormtroopers are actually clones of Boba Fett's father -- the only reason Jango was written into this script in the first place was because of Boba's unexpected cult following from episodes V & VI.  Ultimately no reason for the dude to be there at all.
7. Hmmmm... suddenly R2D2 has jets... could have helped him out of some jams in Episodes IV, V & VI....
8. Can you say ""Gladiator""?  Stupid.
9. Samuel L. Jackson *STILL* doesn't belong in a Star Wars movie.
10. What was the reason for having Jimmy Smits in this movie again?  The brain aneurysm his presence caused me has made me forget.
11. Finally, five words: COUNT DOOKU?  NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT.
I have many more gripes, but space is limited.  All in all, I feel that Episode Two was very confused and didn't know what it wanted to be.  The  script was very disjointed and overall not edited well.  It just didn't have that ""Star Wars"" feel.  Say what you want about Phantom Menace, but even with all it's CGI enhancements, Gungans and two-headed announcers, at least it FELT like a Star Wars movie.",1021852800,30,2381,4.439080459770115
1323756,5,B00003CXKT,"At first, I went to Famous Players theatre thinking I was gonna see Spider-Man, but to my surprise, I was sitting in the theatre of where Star Wars was gonna be played. Oh my gosh! I was so disappointed! I almost started to cry! I actually thought I was gonna hate this movie, but I ended up getting right into it, as if I was a Star Wars fan all along!! This movie was incredible!! The special effects, the costumes, just.. WOW!!! I would really recommend this movie to anyone who likes that kind of stuff. The only downside to this movie is its length. It's like 2 and a half hours, almost 3...no joke!! I actually wanted it to be longer! The movie ended pretty strangly (is that a word.. who cares?!)",1021852800,,703,4.293233082706767
1323757,4,B00003CXKT,"With Star Wars, it's always a love-hate thing for me.  I love it now that more of the story George Lucas has envisioned is revealed.  It's more complicated and sinister than I thought.  I watched Episodes IV, V and VI when I was a kid, and haven't had a chance to review them.  There were a lot of scathing reviews for Episode I: The Phantom Menace, yet it still did phenominally well in the box office.  I believe Episode II will follow the same trend.
Off the bat, I will say that the story of Episode II is an improvement over Episode I.  The graphics were no-doubt state-of-the-art and just as stunning, if not more so, than the first episode.  (Since this film was shot entirely on digital cameras, they had more flexibility and control over the non-human characters.  For instance, Yoda used to be a puppet, but is now entirely digital.  All the mecha fight scenes in Episodes IV, V and VI used to be stop-frame photography, not anymore.  And I can't imagine filling up a colloseum with thousands of insect-costume-clad extras.  Shows you how far technology has come.)  Unfortunately, the acting was horrendous.
(Usually, when I make comments like these, Star Wars fans dismiss me as missing the point.  People also tend to think less of my review.  But it is still a movie, isn't it?  And if these reviews are supposed to be a candid forum where I can voice what I truly think about something, then I just have to grit my teeth and spit it out.  So here goes.)
Regardless of how pretty Natalie Portman is, her role as Padme was less than convincing.  As was her ""relationship"" with Anakin.  The last kiss scene was absolutely passionless and insipid.  Her character smells of a bad soap opera star.  (I did find her peck-on-the-cheek kiss to Anakin in the colosseum cute.  But seriously, isn't she supposed to be this grown-up senator who doesn't show her emotions in public?)  I'm even more disappointed with what Hayden Christensen did to Anakin.  OMG, I can't believe that's acting!  He could've atleast tried harder.  (Maybe they decided to put him behind a mask and a robotic voice and call him Darth Vader to coverup for his acting.  Just a thought ;).)  As usual, Yoda is there to provide some comic relief.  As I was lining up at a book store holding a copy of the book version of Episode II, some guy asked me ""Did Yoda really kick some [rear]?""  I had to tell him that he did, but it was a short 20 second scene and it didn't really overwhelmingly prove Yoda's prowess in swordfighting.  The enemy ended the stalemated fight by running away.
I think die-hard Star Wars fans will love this movie regardless of what I say.  I believe adults will appreciate the plot of this episode more than the first one.  I think kids below 13 will find a large segment of this film boring and the last half hour spellbinding.  I would still recommend this film to people for continuity and something to talk about by the watercooler.
LEAP rating (each out of 5):

L (Language) - 0 (This is a harsh rating to give, but someone should've proofread the dialogue, and passed it to a script doctor.)
E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a - sorely disappointed by this rating)
A (Action) - 5 (You can't beat the graphics, state-of-the-art.)

1323759,4,B00003CXKT,"After viewing the Attack of the Clones at my local Cinema, I neither felt elated nor dissappointed. The movie was enjoyable, but the poor actors really struggle to perform with the awful stilted Star Wars dialogue. In the original three movies we had at least Han Solo with his sarcasm and wit, but now everyone is so serious. Hayden Christiansen, does a excellent job allowing us to see his slide to the ""Dark Side"". Ewan McGregor does the best he can with his lines. Thank fully they are not as bad as the ""Yes, master"", ""No master"" stuff he had in Episode One. The special effects however are so good that when viewing, you just accept what you see, and you just take them for granted. There is however a few exceptions. The scenes where our heroes are riding on the back of various beasts, are really quite poor. They move and look like rag dolls.
There are some wonderful action sequences, but they seem to be either too long, or not long enough. Yodas fight with Dooku was over too soon, where I felt the gladiator type scene was too long.
I may be being too critical, but I expected more. Still its Star Wars, and I enjoyed it. Its better that Episode One, and I hope that Episode 3 is better still.",1021852800,2,1206,4.388392857142857
1323760,4,B00003CXKT,"I don't understand all the negative reviews of this movie by the film critics.  It is better than the ""Phantom Menace"" in the sense that there is less Jar-Jar and more action.  The acting could have been a little better, but the same could be said of all the Star Wars movies.  The special effects are much better in the last two movies than in the previous trilogy.  In fact, I have a hard time watching the original movies now because the effects look so poor in comparison.  The plot is a little slow in the middle, but I think the rabid fans want as long a movie as possible so they won't complain.  Overall, I would say this is the best installment yet, which is high praise since sequels usually are not as good as the original.",1021852800,,734,4.282608695652174
1323761,4,B00003CXKT,"Let me preface this review by saying that I am an old school Star Wars fan who had ""issues"" with Episode I. With that said, I loved Attack of the Clones!  The movie easily exceeded my expectations and, in my humble opinion, blew the Phantom Menance out of the water (it is also more entertaining than Return of the Jedi).
The charm and humor that was missing from Episode I is back in this movie.  I was pleased to see C3P0 providing the slap stick humor instead of the annoying Jar Jar Binks.  I loved the digitally created Yoda, whose roll in the dramatic climax blew me away.  Yoda rules!  There are so many things that I liked about the movie including the story, the landscapes, character development, the file makers attention to details and veiled references of to the original triolgy (and the foreboding of things to come).  The bottom line is this:  this move is FUN to watch.
With the exeception of a few of the romantic scenes where the dialogue reminded me of a bad day-time soap opera,  the movie flows very well and moves at a good pace.  It lives up to the action/adventure standards that Lucas set in the first three films.  If you liked the original trilogy, I think you will be thrilled with this film.
I read at least 20 reviews before seeing this movie.  It was split down the middle:  half of the critics liked the movie and the other half panned it on the level of Phantom Menace (Although all agreed that this movie is better than Menace).  I can't comprehend critics.  After all, this is Star Wars not ""On Golden Pond"" or ""The English Patient"".  Movies like the English Paitient make me sick.  Although I'm no spring chicken (I was around for the original Star Wars in 1977) I'm still  young at heart, unlike many of the critics who lost their youthful exuberance 20 years ago. Poor dialogue, stiff acting?  You must be referring to the Phantom Menace not this film. If you are looking for picture of the year you are not going to find it in a science fiction movie.
Although I rarley see movies more than once at the theater,  I will make an exception this time and see Attack of the Clones again. Enjoy!",1021852800,2,2130,4.443298969072165
1323762,4,B00003CXKT,"No this memorable line is not in Attack of the Clones, but the quote from Jedi Master Yoda, certainly suites it! Episode II, Attack of The Clones, was an amazing Star Wars film. We start to see a lot more of Anakin's ""Dark side"", the love of Padme, and Anakin, Luke Skywalker's Uncle Owen, and Aunt...whatever the hell her name is, from A NEW HOPE. And lastly, something I always dreamed for, we got to see Yoda kick some [behind]! The guy is a Jedi master, 3 feet tall, hell that guy gives me a reason to live! The acting is probably pretty much what you'd expect from Phantom Menace, at least that little kid wasn't in it, poor kid. Oh yeah sorry to disapoint, but that ""thing"" Jar Jar Binks is back, but luckily he only had 2 scenes or something. I thought the acting from the new Anakin was good, except a couple of lines that he said, sholdn't of been in there, can't blame the actor, blame the Screenplay writer's. Natalie Portman was good as usual, that outfit at the end was Spec-tac-u-lar!! Ewan McGregor was okay, he was the same in Phantom Menace, which I wasn't to fond of. I just can't see him being the same character as Obi ""Ben"" Kenobi. Samuel Jackson was good, only if Star wars aloud him to say MF, he would of been awsome! Overall the movie was great, special effects burned by eyes in the theater, it will be more better when it comes out on DVD. The reason why this movie didn't get the full five stars was simply because of the screenplay, they didn't give a full character, like the original's. It's a good movie, go see it, it will keep you counting down the days to Episode III.

A lot darker film, great acting,l great story line with great links to past present and future lineage. Effects are better that before. Great pacing, mixing in obi wans detective subplot with the tamer romance scenes.
What I didn't like was all the incredibly silly c3po parts, Unfortunatley George couldn't resist putting silly jokes inbetween the great arena battle scenes, bad move. Also the diner scene was rediculous, it made a mockery of all the hard work that went into the rest of the universe being believable.
I place it after empire and new hope {not special editions}. But I think it may be the most watchable film of them all even though it is not as solid. If the afore mentioned scenes were cut out it would be the best yet i think.

For long time fans this is an important installment in the overall Star Wars saga/story.  From a movie-goer perspective the special effects are near flawless and quite believable.  I have read many reviews critical of the acting of the main characters but my thought was that the main characters' acting was right on the money.  Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christiansen are excellent, Hayden showing alternately the child, the impatient adolescent and the coming dark-side.  Natalie Portman is much more free in her dialouge this time around not being constrained by the comportment expected of a queen, and her action scenes are great.  But one character steals the show (I won't say why, but you'll see).  Yoda is the absolute best.

1323832,5,B00003CXKT,"I am fully prepared to stand by the heading of my review. This is a 2 1/2 hour (or close enough that it makes no difference) film that for me flew by. Not once was I bored. Instead I was vastly entertained, and in the ""slower"" parts of the film I was intrigued by the political stuff going on.
The love story- To me this worked very well. I really did not expect Anakin or Padme to act any differently than they did. We all know, whether we are teenagers or not, that if and when we fall in love with a person that that love often over-rides our common sense and dominates our thoughts and feelings.  It had just enough ""spice""  it it to work. (No hanky-panky, this is FAMILY entertainment). But more important than spice it had heart I really believed these two loved each other and felt their care. If you love someone or they love you, often you can see it in thir eyes and their actions toward you. Words are not always necessary. Bravo.
The dialogue- NO Star Wars movie in the history of the series is known for Shakespearean words. After watching this and listening to the lines delivered I found them more than satisfying to me. The actors did fine with it. They were NOWHERE near as stiff as some critics would have you think. I enjoyed this very much.
The effects- These were breathtaking and NOT ""cartoonish"" again as some critics would have you think. The sights from planet to planet and city to city were breathtaking, beautiful, and sometimes dark and appropriately gloomy. I really felt transported into the middle of these worlds. The creatures were also done very well.
The acting- See my dialogue comments. EVERYBODY in my view did a great job. Even Jar Jar did not sound as silly this time. He was more serious a bit and wasn't in the film long enough anyway for me to pay him much notice. But even he did fine. I actually liked him more this time around for his slightly more serious nature and sincerity. McGregor, Portman, Christensen, Jackson, Lee, and the others all did great jobs with their roles.
The action- More of it in this film than in any of the Star Wars movies to date. Stunning, dizzying, and awe-inspiring. Very enjoyable.
The Music- A perfect blend of exciting and beautiful new music with snippets of tunes from the other Star Wars movies weaves together a very nice and effective tapestry to tell this epic story in music that perfectly compliment the visuals of this awesome film. Across The Stars (the love theme) alone was a great joy to hear and real candy for the ears. John Williams really is a musical genius.
Overall- I liked the original Star Wars trilogy more than any movie series in history. I liked the Phantom Menace a lot. I LOVED Star Wars Episode II Attack Of The Clones. I laughed, I cheered, and yes I did even cry.  I did not go into this film to find things to nit-pick at, I went to enjoy it and have a great time with it. This turned out to be a good thing because as I watched and listened I found, saw, and heard NOTHING to nit-pick at anyway. I went to enjoy this film and take another trip into a galaxy  far far away. I LOVED this film, and so can you, I hope. :) Take that trip too, back to a galaxy far far away. You just might fall in love with this film like I did. Peace. :)",1021766400,2,3247,4.3355263157894735

1323834,5,B00003CXKT,"Episode II Attack of the Clones just blew me away! The action was superb and the special effects were fantastic. Unlike The Phantom Menace, Episode II is a much darker story. Boba Fett's father is after Senator Amidala (former queen of Naboo) with an army full of clones. Fortunately, the good side makes the clones tun to the good side. On the way, Padme (Natalie Portman) and Anakin (Hayden Christiansen) form a chemistry and fall in love. I do not want to ruin the story for the people who have not seen this great movie yet, so I will go no further.
The scenery in the movie was just spectacular. The scenery ranged from beatiful mountains and ocean to gigantic towers of the planets. Yoda did a great job in this film fighting against the emperor's apprentice. I thought it was quite funny, yet neat at the same time. The movie was pretty long, but it helped build the story for the following episodes. The acting was pretty good, maybe could have been a tiny bit better, but  still very good. In the movie you also get to know more about some of the characters which also appear in Episodes 4, 5, and 6.
Whatever you do, do NOT listen to the critics out there, who are trying to persuade you not to see this movie. This movie is absolutely great and definetely deserves 5 stars.  Great work Mr. Jucas! Go ahead and see it for yourself!

1323837,5,B00003CXKT,"Well, the waiting is over and the highly anticipated second chapter in the set of prequels in the Star Wars series is here.  Episode II is a faced paced ride that gives the fans some of the pieces of the puzzle that will eventually fall into place in the origin of Darth Vader.  In ""Attack of the Clones"", Obi-wan Kenobi is now a Jedi master training his apprentice, Anakin.  Amidala, now a senator, has survived an attempted assassination and the story follows the two Jedi knights as one tries to solve the mystery of Amidala's attacker and the other protects the former Queen of Naboo.  This story incorporates the romance of Amidala and Anakin and the sinister plot involving the building of a Clone army to serve the dark, evil Lord Sidius.  I won't give away any more plot points but there is plenty of action and amazing special effects that are a pleasure for the eye.  The fight with Yoda and Count Dooku is a reward for the legion of fans that adore the little green one.  The last 50 minutes or so will blow you away with the amount of special effects.  It is well worth seeing---worth seeing more than once.  I liked Episode I but I do think this one was faster paced and a better movie.  I think Star Wars fans will most definitely be pleased and other movie goers, as well, will enjoy this film.  Whets the appetite for the final film!",1021766400,2,1349,4.421052631578948

1323893,2,B00003CXKT,"Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman star in the next episode of the epic Star Wars saga. This portion shows us a young and headstrong (And whiny!) Anakin Skywalker, bent on proving his worth as a Jedi Knight of the Republic. The peace in the universe is shattered at the abrupt assasination attempt on Senator Amidala, played by Portman. While The Jedi Council senses that there is trouble brewing somewhere in the universe, Anakin is assigned to protect Amidala on her home planet of Naboo. Obi-Wan also sets out to an unknown system only to discover a mysterious Clone army has been assembled under the orders of an unknown member of the Jedi Council. A terrible snore all in all, with breif comic releif from Jar Jar and C3PO to lighten the overwhelmingly boring dialogue. Who wrote this script? The characters are terribly bland, with acting as bad as some of the earlier Star Trek episodes. Not only that, but the script is littered with terribly bad cliches and puns that would make even your grandmother throw up. Even the hard core Star Wars fans may have trouble staying awake for this one. There is gross amounts of incoherently bad acting from Anakin, with a never ending amount of whining like ""Obi-Wan never lets me do anything"" and other similar types of ranting. Could someone buy this kid a toy already? Just get him to shut up ( I mean, c'mon, he already has a lightsaber). Then there are the clones. Wow.. Attack of the Clones... but just what do they attack??? There are brief instances in which they are actually seen in the entire film, and they are not even that exciting. And to make it worse, feeble attempts to make the film more interesting account for a good majority of the running time. Okay, Yoda with a lightsaber, that's pretty cool (Although Kermit the Frog with a pitchfork would be just as cool),it just can't pull the film from the dirt. The entire purpose of the film seems to get lost for a while as we traipse around the universe, and it is only in the conclusion that we realize why we sat here for a little more than two hours.",1021766400,,2066,4.556451612903226

The Jedi battles are better than in A New Hope,The Battle is bigger than the Empire Strikes Back and,well,it's just better than Return of the Jedi(And I won't mention ther Phantom Menace).This is a must see film. I've seen it twice already, and I enjoyed it both times. Surely it can beat Harry Potter and Spiderman. Still, I love this film and keep asking whether I can see it again some other time.

  And Yoda is hilarious when he fights!!!",1021766400,,676,4.4
1323895,4,B00003CXKT,"Wow! What a thrill-ride! Where to begin!?
There's quite a bit to enjoy in Episode II. First, if the guys who attended the ""Fan Force"" convention or whatever it's called in Indy recently and dressed up to get in line Wednesday night of the 12:01 showing are a 10.. and the saps who hate the whole saga are a 0... I'm probably an 8 or 9! I love what all of Star Wars has given us in entertainment since I was 9 years old.
First.. the movie is thoroughly packed with enjoyable action set-pieces. The best moments for me were 1) The Jango/Boba chase of ObiWan through the Asteroids... that scene is probably the most sophisticated sounding and looking star wars scene I've ever seen.. breathtaking and beautiful.  2) The 4-character saber fight at the end.  3) The Jango-ObiWan Kamino landing platform fight  4) Zam Assassin chase through Coruscent (forgive my mispellings here).  5) The arena battle pre-clones arrival  6) Arena battle post clones arrival too! Some other details worth mentioning... the gun ship blowing up behind our heroes.. and goes down sounding like a WW2 big plane... nice touch. Also.. the ""field camera sudden shakey zoom"" effect.. that was used at least 2 times.  Hard to explain.. but I'm sure the folks at Lucasfilm know what I'm talking about. The use of missles was new and fun. The contrails coming off the tips of the Naboo Queen's ship at the beginning as it approaches the city... HOLY MOMMA! THAT WAS INCREDIBLE!
To be sure, there are some things I'd played out in my head that I would have like to have seen (in a way George can never win with folks like me dreaming the movie before I see it!).. like perhaps a more drawn-out telling of his attempt to rescue his mom.. maybe she and he start to escape but are then captured.. and he witnesses her being tortured.. to death.. and THEN he goes nutz and kills them all. I know George wants to keep the thing PG so I understand the short length of that dark scene.
I would have enjoyed more true chemistry and better more normal dialogue between Hayden and Natalie. But I know in the movies.. that's a total crapshoot. Getting Billy Crystal/Meg Ryan ""couple chemistry"" (or H.Ford/C. Fisher for that matter) is a rare achievement and I don't fault George for picking his leads. They certainly have the talent to pull it off ultimately in Ep. 3 and I'd bet they will.  Some of the dialogue was just great actually... like the scene where Anakin reveals his Tuscan Raider massacre to Padme and sort of unravels... and the scene on the gunship after Padme falls out onto the sand dune... between ObiWan and Anakin. I liked the detail that the ship and wind noise were loud and they had to yell loud at each other to be heard.. It had a realism to it. The inclusion of little razzes and taunts/dialogue in the light saber battle at the end... THANK THE MAKER for that.
So yeah.. there was some weak dialogue in some spots. But no biggie! The casting choices continue to be great. After watching Michael Collins and Rob Roy.. who could blame Lucas for casting Liam Neeson. The same can be said of Episode 2 with Christopher Lee and Hayden Christenson. Much CGI work out there in the world of movies has well.. cheapened the art of CGI. It's nice to see the A-team of ILM in action here and what they accomplish is breathtaking in design, movement and sound.
I'm hoping Rick McCallum and George are reading through all of these reviews.. and I'd like to add my $0.02 about getting writing help for the dialogue and plot-flow from old masters Lawrence Kasdan (co Scr.writer on The Empire Strikes Back) and even Irvin Kershner (director of Empire) if he's still able (he's probably around 80 by now)... or perhaps director David Fincher's camp... and maybe the folks who were behind X-Men.  Pay them a fee each!  Why not?! Even if you only pick one of those sources and have them assist on Ep. 3 it can only improve the quality. You can certainly afford to do this!
Criticism aside, I feel like I've been given so many gifts with Episode 2.. I don't want to get greedy!  Thanks for everything you did George! Nice job! Keep up the good work.
P.S. I've seen the movie digitally projected and regularly projected.. and WHOA.. the digital projection is just incredible! I looks like I could go to the front-row Clockwork Orange Malcolm McDowel seats and dive into the movie! I highly suggest making the extra effort to see it digitally projected - you will thank me!",1021766400,3,4434,4.566037735849057

We get to hear Darth Vader's theme music, as well as the Emperor's, and all the great Star Wars music that was not in TPM.

1323897,4,B00003CXKT,"I saw it yesterday in a half-full theater (third day after release).  This film delivers a spectacle worthy of the price of admission.  The story takes place on several planets, all of which are depicted with rich background detail.  New and interesting characters are introduced, such as a four-armed chef in a diner and a mercenary soldier who seems to possess Jedi-class fighting skills.  The love story is distracting, but at least it allows Padme (formerly a queen, now a senator) to pick up a blaster and join the Jedi in fighting the bad guys -- Natalie Portman finally showed some spirit.  The computer effects are even better than before, and the humor works better than in Episode I.  Jar Jar Binks is relegated to a minor role.
There are a few shortcomings.  The action scenes are sometimes shown so close-up and so fast that you can't tell what is happening.  I plan to buy the DVD in order to slow down many of the scenes.  Also, some of the computer-generated creatures are too anthropomorphic -- the head of a crab-like creature shows an evil and toothy smile.  But these are small quibbles.  If you are a Star Wars fan, or if you just like Sci-Fi-action movies, forget the small flaws.  Just go see it.  You will enjoy it.",1021766400,,1238,4.598173515981735
1323898,5,B00003CXKT,"Since May of 1977, when the original Star Wars premiered, George Lucas has been assembling the biggest cinematic jigsaw puzzle ever to hit the realm of fantasy and science fiction; a monumental undertaking that has forever altered the celluloid landscapes of the universe while propelling the art of filmmaking ahead at light speed.  His epic saga is the ultimate tale of Good against Evil-- pure in every sense--  and with the fifth installment, Star Wars:  Episode II, Attack of the Clones, Lucas carefully inserts more of the integral pieces into that puzzle, leading us ever closer to the full and complete picture that will be revealed in Episode III, the sixth and final chapter that will at last bring the story full circle.
 It has been ten years since the events depicted in Star Wars:  Episode I, The Phantom Menace unfolded, and the ramifications of galactic politics has brought the galaxy to the brink of war; the life of Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman)-- now a member of the Senate-- has been threatened, and Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his young apprentice, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), have been called upon to protect her.  Not an easy task, however, as the dark side of the force has grown in strength, clouding the future to such an extent that not even Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz) can discern what may be in the offing.  Jedi Council Leader Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) is concerned with the threat of the impending war and the possible outcome, for he realizes that the Jedi, though strong, are too few; they are the peace keepers of the galaxy, but there is simply not enough of them to fight a war.  But the one who is perhaps the most troubled of all is Anakin Skywalker, who in his zeal to cling to his autonomy is beginning to feel the pull of the dark side, that part of the force that will eventually seduce him, and to which he will ultimately dedicate himself.  And when it happens, it will drastically affect not only Anakin, but Obi-Wan, as well; and most especially, the young woman with whom Anakin has been in love since the first day they met, Padme Amidala.
 George Lucas is a visionary filmmaker; he is to film what Jules Verne, H.G. Wells and J.R.R. Tolkien are to literature, with a touch of Aesop and The Brothers Grimm thrown in as well.  If you take a step back, pause and reflect upon what Lucas has done, its awe-inspiring.  Not only did Star Wars spring from his fertile imagination, but he managed to translate it all vividly to the screen, with all of the myriad plot twists and turns, characters and intricacies, in a cohesive, accessible way that makes it riveting entertainment that has been embraced by audiences around the world and from one generation to the next.  And with Episode II, he does not merely give you more of the same-- the forte of most sequels, especially beyond a second installment-- but develops the story and characters with meticulous detail that takes you one step closer to that moment when all is revealed and the final link is established, tying it all together.
 Beginning with the original, and right on through the (now) five films, Lucas demonstrates what a master craftsman he is, delivering an engrossing story that is visually astounding, as well.  And throughout the series, he maintains a continuity and consistency in the presentation; in the storyline, the way it is acted and the overall look of the finished product, and with a pace that it always perfectly attuned to the moment-- accelerated for the heart-pounding action sequences, more deliberate when needed, to effect the personal drama that lies at the core of the story.  In the final analysis, George Lucas is one of the few artists to whom the title filmmaker, in the absolute purest and truest sense, can be attributed.  He is a brilliant storyteller; a genius who has perfected and advanced his chosen medium perhaps more than anyone else before or since.  And, inexplicably-- like Chaplin and Welles during their respective lifetimes-- Lucas has never been truly or properly recognized for his many accomplishments; recognition that is deserved and overdue.  Its time to stand up and acknowledge him as the gifted artist he is.
 In his second outing as Obi-Wan, Ewan McGregor continues to amaze.  Creating the younger version of the character already established so indelibly by Alec Guinness-- and making him convincing-- had to be a tremendous challenge; and McGregor comes through with banners raised high.  He does not merely imitate, but truly captures the essence of the character established by Guinness, almost as if channeling Guinness spirit through his performance.  He has the mannerisms, the speech patterns, expressions and body language, all of which leads to a seamless transition from McGregor to Guinness in Episode IV.  And its all done in a subtle, unassuming and quite natural way by McGregor, which makes his Obi-Wan believable and real.  Its a studied, discriminating portrayal, and a real accomplishment for this talented young actor.
 Another of the strengths of the film is the performance by Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker.  Knowing that the engaging young Anakin will one day become the evil Darth Vader, it is pivotal that the actor playing the role at this stage of the characters development is able to capture and convey what it is in his personality-- and deeper, in his heart-- that allows him to be turned to the dark side.  And that is exactly what Christensen accomplishes with his portrayal.  Perfectly cast, he is believably the older version of the character created by Jake Lloyd in Episode I, and most importantly, he displays the dark, inner rumblings and angst that will ultimately be his undoing.  Finally, the chemistry between Christensen and Portman makes the inevitable romance viable, and Attack of the Clones, another triumph for George Lucas.",1021766400,60,5888,4.90625
1323899,2,B00003CXKT,"Having seen this long awaited chapter of Star Wars i must say i am disappointed. Some reviewers in here have stated that this installment is superior to the original three....statements whiich are scarcely credible. Neither this movie,or The Phantom Menace hold a candle to the original three and heres why
The dialogue in Star Wars has never been exceptional but in this new movie i found it excruciating. The romance scenes were stilted,sterile and severely lacking in chemistry. The special effects are good but it is sensory overload right from the start...the film isn't allowed to breathe as in the originals. The story seems ill  conceived and the characters two dimensional...you just don't care what happens to them(even though you already know!!!)i could go on all day but there is no need. If you are a star wars fan and not blinded by the hype then youll see what i mean. I must say however that seeing Natalie Portman in a wraparound top is worth admission alone so thats one star for effort and one for girly eye candy",1021766400,13,1032,4.76536312849162
1323900,2,B00003CXKT,"After being decidedly underwhelmed by ""The Phantom Menace,"" I was really looking forward to ""Star Wars, Episode II: Attack of the Clones,"" the latest film in the venerable sci-fi franchise. Alas, I found this film even more disappointing than Episode I. Much of Episode II feels like (1) an excuse to show off the latest special effects technology, and/or (2) an extended commercial for forthcoming video games.
The film is hurt by unbelievably bad dialogue: much of it sounds like a bad soap opera. Also annoying was the barely comprehensible plot.
Watching Episode II, I realized how much the success of the original trilogy (Episodes IV through VI) depended on the superb chemistry of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. In contrast, there is zero chemistry among the principals in Episode II. The weak love story is totally unbelievable.
After seeing Hayden Christensen's fine performance in ""Life As a House,"" I was really looking forward to his performance as Anakin Skywalker in Episode II. But his performance in this pivotal role just never worked for me. Maybe it was the bad dialogue; maybe he was let down by poor direction and editing. Other characters in the film are wasted.
And ultimately, Episode II is a tremendously violent film. But unlike a war movie like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" which treats battle carnage with sensitivity and moral awareness, ""Attack of the Clones"" is a film which seems to be saying that violence is fun. Part of the problem is that so many of the victims of Episode II violence are robots and nonhumans about whom, the filmmakers must assume, we just don't care.
Sure, there is a lot of stunning eye candy in ""Attack"": the costumes, starships, sets, and alien creatures are packed with intricate detail. But with the emotional and moral emptiness at the heart of Episode II, it all doesn't amount to much. ""Attack"" is currently my pick for the biggest artistic disaster of 2002.",1021766400,,1931,4.92638036809816

relation starts to bond between the soon to be Darth Vadar, and
Padme. The film itself, is dark leading to nothing postive. Episode III is expected to be even darker. Episode II was very
action packed and for the fans that were dissapointed with the episode I, Epsiode II seems to make up for the loss. The film

1323902,5,B00003CXKT,"... It was much better than I anticipated. Unlike the Phantom Menace, this film  was not made for kids. and Jar Jar Brinks has only about 5 minutes of screen time for the whole movie. He does play a very important scene however, even though he still is the same Jar Jar. This film is well over 2 hours long. it is the longest Star Wars movie by far.
But the most important thing of this movie is that the film is more focused on the story, not visual effects.
the draw back however is that the diolouge is still a bit flawed (nothing serious though).
A more serious draw back is that the music near the end of the film was taken out from the Phantom Menace soundtrack. Which had a cut and paste quality to it which is not good (though only about 5 minutes of music from the TPM was taken out all together)
In conclusion, go see this movie, it is getting back on the right track, big time",1021766400,,887,4.127167630057803
1323981,2,B00003CXKT,"It's a shame that these new movies are sold as continuing the Star Wars enterprise. In fact the spirit of `Star Wars' is long gone. `Attack of the Clones', like its predecessor, is just another mildly entertaining big-budget CGI-sludger. By `CGI-sludger' I mean a film swamped in effects at the expense of atmosphere and clarity (visual or otherwise). Major problems with the movie are exactly those that afflicted `Menace' - (1) way too much CGI-sludge; (2) bad characterisation; (3) plot deficiencies; and (4) redundant slapstick. However, on top there is a more worrying development. This episode does a volte-face on the essential Star Wars pacifism. Lucas has gone macho. Examples:
(1) CGI overload/problems
Current CGI movies will look very, very dated in a couple of decades' time. The main problem is that CGI-scapes have very little atmosphere, making them, in the end, unmemorable. There is one nice idea which is a landscape with - appropriately - cloned waterfalls: simple and effective. But elsewhere things are just visually confusing and messy. Surprisingly, some of the effects look amateurish. Both Anakin and Padme do a bit of bucking bronco stuff on CGI creatures that is badly sync'd (the riders and the creatures are moving differently) with non-uniform lighting - a real clunker if this is supposed to be state-of-the-art. Most problematically of all, the CGI is derivative. The `execution scene' has creatures that escaped from `Starship Troopers', and the Verhoeven influence doesn't end there: the `big war' sequences attempt some `news footage' effects with rapid, search-for-the-target pans and zooms, glitchy refocussing etc. This makes these scenes way too bombastic and heavy, as if Lucas were going for a Black Hawk Down or even Private Ryan-type effect. This shoot-things-up obsession looks all-too current and is a weird and unwelcome turn where Star Wars used to be about pacifism. [Another derivative bit: the cloners have been nicked wholesale from the last scene of 'AI'.]
(2) Bad characterisation
Yoda kicking [rear] just does not work - the Buddha never went postal; nor should he. Again, this is Star Wars going military. His Jet-Li moves, tho', are very funny indeed and the best part of the entire movie. I don't think this was intentional, however.
(3) Plot deficiencies
This film alarms more than `Menace' on this front. The clone army is pretty important to this movie - central not only to the plot but also the title. However, the development of this army when its commissioner has died without the developers' knowledge seems extremely far-fetched. Added to this it is not clear why this army was commissioned in the first place unless it was already known that Darths Sidious and Tyranus (aka Count Dooku) were already up to no good. If so, why was this knowledge not available to the Jedi in general? I guess the explanation must be that the Jedi were going for deterrence just in case. Again, this is evidence that Lucas has lost his way with Jedi motivation. Everyone's suddenly dropped the force and got tooled up instead. But would spiritual leaders really go for arms as a solution? This just does not work, and confuses Anakin's 'turn'. When he trashes his mother's tormentors, it just looks like Jedi business-as-usual in the context of this movie.
(4) Irritating slapstick
While this film wisely dispenses with the breathtakingly naff Jar-Jar Binks, the rubbish-for-laffs effect remains. C3PO's `football head' slapstick is extremely irritating. Surely Lucas does not need to depend on this sort of nonsense for audience response. It suggests a confidence problem.
Oh well, there you go. Fluff being taken way too seriously - including by me, who usually prefers stuff by Godard or Tarkovsky. However, that these new episodes ARE being taken so seriously is testament to the brilliance of the original trilogy, which got us all hooked bigtime on little (as well as big) muppets, spaceships, blokes in tupperware, and hokey mysticism as if these were the greatest, most important cinematic ideas ever. That the fantasy is so enduring is, perhaps, Lucas's real achievement. I can't imagine any of us bothering much with this badly-conceived, macho codswallop otherwise.",1021766400,3,4225,5.151382823871907

Now apparantly, this movie is better if you haven't seen the recent SW1. Everyone was complaining that it took too long to get started, but I hadn't, so all of the initial time was very informative.  I got to know the characters and understand the plot. Afterwards, it leaves you begging for more.  So now, I'm going to have to see Episode 3.

Episode II:  Attack of the Clones is not  encumbered with the task of plot and character establishment as was Phantom Menace (which was problematic but still unfairly criticized in many ways-but that's another review.)  In AOTC, Lucas fires the plot forward, fleshing out the characters (especially Anakin and Obi-Wan) and drawing us in by morbid fascination, ie: how did things go so horribly wrong?
And things are going horribly wrong, as that classic opening crawl text tells us.  The Republic, rife with dissatisfaction and corrupton, is literally breaking apart under it's own weight-with a little help from the dark side.
This is what makes AOTC inherently intriguing.  Our heroes work desperately to make sense of the darkening situation. Along the way, they confront their own shortcomings in trying to figure out the right course of action.  Indeed, for Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Padme, the conflict is not simply with their enemies, its with their own passions and confusion as well.  In the Luke trilogy (IV, V, and VI), things were relativley cut and dry:  the Emperor and Darth Vader are the enemy; the Death Stars are horrific weapons of genocide; they must be stopped.  AOTC, by contrast, presents a fuzzy situation.
In this light, the Star Wars fan should be easily drawn in within the first two thirds of the film.  The final third is an [smorgusboard] of action that will leave fans wanting more (kind of like Episode V).  The saber duels, the chase through the asteroids, and the new creatures and ships will spark memories of the Luke trilogy, while at the same time establishing memorable moments for the Anakin trilogy.
The dialogue?  Yes, it could have been better.  A few lines really clunk.  There as not as much chemistry between Padme and Anakin as one would expect.  The acting?  It's good overall.  The one flaw that I can point out is that the characters need to relax a little.  Padme and Anakin are played in a manner that's a little stiff and wooden.  Even in the darkest hours of Episodes IV-VI, Leia and  Solo always managed to keep the swagger and the abilty to wisecrack.
A shining performance is turned in by Ewan McGregor, who must have really studied hard to portray a young Obi Wan.
Overall, this is a great movie, a fan's movie.  The Star Wars universe is braodened and deepened by this film.  Enjoy.",1021766400,2,2398,4.781021897810219
1323984,2,B00003CXKT,"I was disappointed with Attack of the Clones. It was barely better than Phantom Menace. Once again the movie relied heavily on special effects and the plot was weak. In the 2nd edition of the trilogy, the Republic is faced with a new separatist movement. Amidala once a queen is now a senator and has become a target of assassins. Both Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin are called to protect her. It has been 10 years since both Amidala and Anakin have seen each other. Once they see each other the romance begins. I found the chemistry between Amidala and Anakin was poor at best. The movie moves along at a slow pace. The special effects are once again incredible, but I fear Lucas has relied on them too much. The only bright spot in the movie was that Jar Jar Binks was reduced to cameo performance.",1021680000,2,795,4.4520547945205475
1323985,5,B00003CXKT,"I've been a SW fan ever since my parents took me to see Jedi twice when I was 5 and i've be a fan ever since, collecting anything Star Wars and watching the movies hundreds of times. Star Wars movies have never been favorites of the critics but this total backlash by some of the so-called fans of the original trilogy has surprised me. Let's remember people...THESE MOVIES ARE PG AND FAMILY FILMS AND IF YOU WANT A MORE ADULT SC-FI SERIES GO WATCH SOMETHING FROM THE OVERRATED STAR TREK SERIES! Most of the people who are complaining about story and dialoge didn't care about that 20-25 years ago when the originals came out mainly because we were all too damn young to care and loved the movies for what they were. Expectations have been set way to high for these new movies and that's where the problem lies. If you enjoy them for what they are and stop whining about how they are not CLONES of the original trilogy you'll enjoy them a hell of alot more.
If it's not the plot or the wooden acting it's the child like feel of the films...DUH! Once again these films ARE directed towards the kids and the kid in all of us and that's what makes them so speical. They're not making toys for 30 year olds they are making them for KIDS and that's the main target audience of the films and always has been. Little kids don't care if Hayden's acting isn't good (even though it was brilliant and BETTER than Mark Hamil's acting)and they don't care if the dialoge is cheesy (which it has been throughout the series)they care about how fun it is and enjoy it for what it is.
AOTC is everything anyone could want in a Star Wars movie and since day one of production we were promised a Empire like film and we got that. The romance between Anakin and Padme was great and worked well. This is the first SW film where the acting and the dialoge comes before the action and it makes it that much better. I know for a fact people are going to HATE EP.3 because it's too dark and not like the originals but like many huge Star Wars fan I will love it for what it is and may I recomend if you liked Clones to try and go back and re-watch Menace because Clones makes it alot better. The originals in my opinion will NEVER be topped because they were something special but the new trilogy is something special on it's own and when it's all said and done I think the naysayer and critics will be able to get into all of them when they can watch them all together as Lucas has intended them to be seen....one big 12 hour movie! Remember...all of these movies set up the final 3 films and it's not like Lucas has just came up with these stories in the past few years! These ideas have been around since the 70's and come from the same brilliant mind as the 1st 3. I'm sorry if anyone's childhood has been robbed but GROW UP!!!! These films aren't a part of your childhood and maybe that's why you can't enjoy them...because you've lost the kid in you!",1021680000,2,2930,4.2715827338129495
1323986,5,B00003CXKT,"Like everyone else with a pulse, I was psyched to see the new Star Wars.  However, after the Phantom Menace, which I would consdier to be an ok movie, but a disgrace to the Star Wars name, I was a bit nervous about Attack of the Clones.  Well, I have seen Star Wars twice already and I can lay those fears to rest.  While I don't think it was good as Star Wars (i refuse to call it A New Hope or Episode IV or anything-it'll always be Star Wars) or The Empire Strikes Back, I actually did find it better than Return of the Jedi.  I won't mention the plot because any Star Wars fan knows it already anyway.  What I will say, though, is that the first half may have been to soap-operish.  Had the movie ended there, I would have given it 4 stars but the second half is all classic Star Wars fighting.  It more than made up for the first half and warrants Episode II a 5-star movie.",1021680000,2,879,4.046242774566474
1323987,1,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars - the original trilogy - has been one of my favourite stories ever since I saw it on the 1997 re-release.  When I first saw The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, my jaw dropped to the floor in amazement, I was excited, scared, I laughed, I almost cried.  Of course, I waited impatiently for the arrival of The Phantom Menace, which turned out to be a halfhearted, fart-joke-riddled flick.  However, I shrugged off the disappointment and prepared for Episode II, expecting it to be much better, perhaps on par with TESB (maybe the title should have tipped me off...)
And so I sat down in the theater, the lights dimmed, the Star Wars fanfare blazed, and the Star Wars logo soared through space, just like five years ago... It was an exhilarating moment.
It all went downhill from there.
Yes, it hurts me to say it, but Attack of the Clones [stinks]...I first saw the problem while reading the yellow text-crawl.  ""Separatist movement ... unstable Republic ... Senate going to vote ... blah, blah, blah"" - what's this, the galactic CNN Headline News?  I was hoping for an improvement once the action started for good, but no such luck.  I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it, but basically, whereas in the first three movies the story took off into hyperspace from the word go, here it putters around in circles and goes nowhere. Despite the fact that we see two assassination attempts in the first ten minutes or so, there is no sense of urgency, no gripping struggle between good and evil.  I guess Lucas was going for a sense of ""ominous danger in the background"", and that's fine in theory, but for some reason he could not pull it off.  Maybe it's because of the stiff and artificial dialogue; maybe it's the acting, although I think the actors were trying to do their best with shlocky scripts and nonexistent directing.  Anakin was overacting, and his lady, Padme Amidala, while not as stiff as in Episode I (which isn't saying much), still has a long way to go.  My favourite character was Obi-Wan Kenobi, who at least had a personality, although he was too cynical at times (for example, when he says ""Good work"" to Anakin - if you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about).
The main problem with the movie, aside from the acting/script thing, is that both too much and too little happens.  Too much - because there's a whole bunch of plots and subplots and alliances and conflicts to keep track of:  there's the Republic vs. the Trade Federation vs. the Clones vs. the separatists vs. the Jedi vs. the Sith vs. the ... oh, never mind, who cares.  Too little - because none of the said plots feels in any way engaging.  The romance between Anakin and Amidala had potential, but got bogged down with cheesy lines.  (""I've been dying a little each day since I met you."" Groan.)
By the end of the movie, I found myself poking fun at the action on screen (when a character said, ""This does not look good,"" I said to myself, ""No duh"").  In the original trilogy, when Luke and Vader were fighting, I was on the edge of my seat, biting my fingernails off; here, my reaction at the ""climactic"" lightsaber swashbuckling was somewhere between resigned boredom and disbelief at how hokey it was.  And don't get me started on the special effects; seems the reason Lucas did many scenes in the movie was to show off how clever his ILM people are with their l'il CGI programs.  The only good thing about the movie was the music (you can always count on John Williams) and the hope that someday Lucas will release the original and still the BEST Star Wars trilogy on DVD.",1021680000,19,3602,4.532407407407407

I have never got up from a Star Wars movie to get a drink, but I got up twice during this one. I wanted to see some of those great galatic battels. The whole movie seems to centered about love. The battle at the end between the Colnes and the Robots does not save the Movie. Yoda can hardly walk and he fight with his Light Saber like he from the Matrix. Technology does not help this movie.

I have never been so bored in my life. The movie skipps around letting each actor get in a few sceanes. Someone in Star Wars always gets in trouble and has to be bailed out. The robot factory scene kept me from going to by a ticket for Spider Man. I had lost all faith in the movie up till thin. The movie did explain alot about the last three in the series. Don't forget the Gladiator battle. I think McFarlen has had all these creatures in a comic book once or twice. And talk about a cheap ending.

1324054,5,B00003CXKT,"Great movie. The dialogue doesn't fit all of the time and is not up to par of the quips that make the trilogy so enjoyable. But the effects are incredible and Christopher Lee was a great Count Dooku (also Saruman in Fellowship of the Ring). Hayden Christensen wasa good choice as Anakin, you can see him going to the dark side. He was also very good at whining throughout the movie. Obi Wan has begun to morph into the wise man we see in Tatooine in Episode 4- very nice (so anytime now the Scottish actor Ewan McGregor will trasnform to British Alec Guinness!) Padme is very different in this film. She isn't the queen anymore, so she can be herself. Threepio and Artoo, always the dynamic dou were fabulous. Threepio especially, we see more of him in this film (but less of his ""parts"") and he was so hilarious.
But it was little, hobbling, green Jedi Master Yoda that stole the show. He was absolutely amazing. I've never seen such an incredible scene in my entire life. Go Pointy Ears!!!
George did a good job. The movie pulls you in from the beginning. Action throughout the entire thing. Very nice. Some funny moments, and lots of twists that will keep you guessing.

1324055,4,B00003CXKT,"Although I was not as anxious to see this movie as I was Episode I, I found it to be one of the most satisfying theater experiences this year.  There simply is no better an entity for visual extravagance than ILM.  The action is marvelous, and the pay-offs for Star Wars fans are plenty.  As with the last movie, I particularly enjoyed McGregor and Portman.  To praise Yoda would be stating the obvious, he stole the show.
Sadly, I had one major disappoinment:  the portrayal of Anakin Skywalker (a complaint I submit to both actor and director.)  I base my opinion on my perception of the Anakin character that started with ""Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"".  The redemption of Darth Vader lead me to believe that Anakin was once a wise and noble Jedi, whose connection with the force went beyond a technical mastery of it.  We assume that the qualities of compassion and nobility, essential to the Jedi, stirred within the Sith Lord as he confronts his son in front of the Emperor, and that in the end the Light Side prevails.
I saw little of those qualities in the young Anakin.  His raw power is obvious, and his turbulent psyche is appropriate... both things are indeed central to thew Anakin character.  However, before Anakin falls into darkness, I would like to see him come into his rights as a true Jedi.  Then, when he submits to the Dark Side, it will be all the more tragedy.
His portrayal in this movie made him seem too disconnected with the Jedi role.  So much so that when he protests the idea of running off to save Obi-Wan in favor of obeying the council, it seems conradictory to the character that Lucas and Christensen had built up until then.  Indeed, when Amidala pointed out that he had already disobeyed the concil's directive when he secretly stole away to take care of his own business on Tatiooine, I found myself asking the same question.  His love for Amildala seemed obsessive and selfish.  I found myself wishing that Amidala would come to her senses and dump him for Obi-Wan.
Ultimately my complaint is this:  I want to admire and respect Anakin before I fear and loath him as Darth Vader.  Episode II doesn't give me much opporunity to do that.  I want more good in him to offset the turbulence, which would, I believe, create a  more substantial conflict.
My apologies to Anakin/Christensen fans.  If you enjoyed him, then more power to you.  I just hope I get to like the character more in III than in I or II.  Fortunately for me, this one element could not ruin the movie.",1021680000,2,2510,4.543429844097996

Summary:
Simply, another great hit for star wars fans!  Filled with great movie technologies, great action, good script-writing, good acting, very good directing, and all those symbolic and instructive details that requires you to watch the movie 20 times to catch the story's subtle underlying themes.
 Truly another Star Wars movie that changes Hollywood and its technology!
Review:
While darker than Episode I, it continues to fill in the questions that are left in our minds, including how someone with the promise to do so much good (Anakin Skywalker - Hayden Christensen) can become trapped by evil.  (How many times do we fall prey to these same issues?)
One aspect of Lucas' genius is that we have waited almost 25 years to learn many of the underlying story drivers from the first movie.  Our curiosity drags us back searching for little details of the ""force"", Skywalker's beginning, Yoda, Jedi Knight' motives,
Lucas's digital film making and THX are dramatic, eye catching, enthralling, and bring the movie to new levels of entertainment.  (Where would Hollywood be today without George Lucas and his technology?)
The script has been attacked by many critics, but is a sure winner with the fans!
Story:

Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader-to-be (Hayden Christiansen) is sent investigate attacks and protect Senator Padm Amidala's (Natalie Portman) who struggles against the creation of an army by the Galactic Republic.  The Anakin's relationship with Amidala blossoms while it sours with his domineering Master Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGreggor).

Negatives:
Ok, there are some dialogue weaknesses within Skywalker and Padm Amidala's (Portman) love story.
And, the movie is darker than some movie goers probably want.
Scare Factor:
Don't bring your younger children to this one: Episode I was made for younger children, this one is darker and therefore more fierce-some for the little ones.",1021680000,23,2100,5.217261904761905
1324057,5,B00003CXKT,"This movie is great! I could have wept it was so good. The action is truly and literally - non-stop. Right from the beginning when something goes wrong to when you're brought towards the end where you are able to witness the Jedi at their best as well as animation technology (by the by - Yoda truly does kick some dark guy a$$). However the lightsaber duels weren't quite as fast and intricate as TPM; Anakin doesn't appear to have an extraordinary amount of skills and powers as he is thought to have (although he is a clever dude).
While the romance is a little clichd and Anakin sucks up to Padm way too much, it is still quite captivating. They look cute together, but their personalities obviously collide - perhaps this is intentional?  Padme's outfits were absolutely GORGEOUS! In my opinion, she doesn't wear each one enough for us to truly take in their beauty. So the romance bit is a little dissappointing, but the end TOTALLY makes up for it!
The sound effects are also excellent! When the ships pass by the characters, you can feel the engines roaring, the lightsabers power, and the moment's intensity. In this movie we also get a good and close look into Coruscant, the Galactic Republic's Capital with its awesome cultures and mystery.
A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I admit that I was a little worried when entering into the theatre, but I was blown off of my feet!

1324058,1,B00003CXKT,"'Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones' is a really silly movie.  Since there is no interesting story, Lucas spends so much time on silly car chases and light saber battles.  Its basically like watching a blank screen for two hours.  The dialogue is laughablly bad, and I've seen better acting on soap operas.  I'm not kiddding.  The charactes may be the same from the originals, but they do not bring the passion or excitement they once did.  Yoda is now just a computer-generated graphic.  The mysteriousness of Darth Vader has now been destroyed too, thanks to bad acting by a child and a teenager.  And thanks to some pitiful dialogue and clumsy storytelling.
The ""plot"" is about assasinations attemps on Queen Amidila, who spends the entire movie looking pretty and saying cornball dialogue.  After some political babble about the Republic, which really doesn't go anywhere, Obi-won-Konobi goes out on a hunt to find who is behind the scheme.  He finds out it was Jango Fett, father of Boba Fett.  Then he finds out a planet is making a army of clones.  On the other side of the story, Annakin and Amidila are falling in love.  Annakin then tries to find his mother.  His mother is killed and he then kills an entire village of people.  He is slowly going into the ""dark"" side.  I would have cared if the acting wasn't so bad and the screenplay wasn't so wooden.
There is no heart in the story.  It looked like it was put together without any effort or passion.  It is slightly better than 'Episode I', but nowhere near as good as the originals.  I fear these three movie will destroy the legend of one of the most famous villians in screen history...If it hasn't done that already.",1021680000,25,1694,4.586666666666667
1324059,4,B00003CXKT,"I saw this movie on Thursday, and I had mixed feelings about it.
First I will give you the bad. The acting was horrible. I do not know what it is with being Anakin Skywalker (kid from Episode one was even worse), but Hayden Christenson was awful. He had his moments, but they did not come very often. Natalie Portman was also pretty bad, but she looked hot. So, for me, that made up for it. Even Samuel Jackson, when not fighting, wasn't very good. The horrible acting probably has to do with the horrible dialogue. The love scenes were like watching a Michael Bay directed movie(Pearl Harbor's and Armageddon's love scenes were cheesy) George Lucas should probably just write an outline for the moive and have someone else write the script. But I do not remember the other movies in the series being known for having stellar acting (aside from the original obi won kenobi) or great writing. So I do not know if the real stars wars fans care.
The good. The special effects were amazing. Ewan McGregor was good. The thing that really made the movie, and the reason I gave the movie an extra star was Yoda. The last minutes with Yoda were amazing. If you haven't seen Spider-Man yet, see it. Then see this movie.",1021680000,,1210,4.504545454545455
1324132,2,B00003CXKT,"While most seem to feel that this was an improvement over The Phantom Menace, I found AOTC to be much more flawed overall. Granted, there were some real highs, what I call ""fanboy moments"" such as the visuals, the battles, Yoda, the Fetts, and Ewan's much-improved performance as Obi-Wan. Unfortunately, the movie is filled with terrible dialogue, uneven pacing, unforgiveably bad edits, and a horribly hacked edit of a wonderful music score (make that two, since they re-used so much music from TPM).
The romance element is unconvincing, almost creepy, due to inept performances by Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen. I can only assume that the director himself is to blame, considering that both performers have done so much better in other films, and Christensen as Anakin does have one brief shining moment late in the film.
Of course, one doesn't come to Star Wars looking for fine art. But even as a ""summer blockbuster"" and ""come to be entertained"" kind of film, sitting through the bad bits makes it hard to enjoy the great bits when they come. Nothing in the original trilogy was this bad, and even the vilified ""Phantom Menace"" had a fraction of the clunkers to be found in ""Clones"". Although there are classic moments that rank amongst the highest in the Star Wars series in AOTC, the uneven elements ultimately make it the most disappointing entry in the series.",1021680000,4,1378,4.8931623931623935
1324133,4,B00003CXKT,"From the beginning in Episode One, I thought that there were no outstanding, extraordinary actors in it. All of them did decently, but the outstanding part came in Episode Two in the form of Hayden Christensen. The entire plot revolves around him; his character is the perfect blend of talent and immaturity. He is frank and very teenagery, but I will admit that a boy wouldn't be quite as swept away with his overly romantic language. His transition to evil made me want to be evil, and Hayden Christensen is one of the most amazing actors I've ever seen. (Background: and I'm not a girl who calls Ben Affleck or Josh Hartnett amazing because they look good) The best scenes, in my opinion, are on Tatooine, where his pain is almost tangible from his eyebrows to his actions.
One of the best parts of this movie besides the outstanding actor was the way he and Padm Amidala both had teenager flaws or characteristics. Last movie, Anakin was a cutesy little kid who was forced to give some dialogue insinuating an attraction to Padm for purposes of later movies. Padm was a political leader forced to drop her character to baby a little boy. This movie, each projects a hard, adult front but are still possessed by some teenage tendencies that make the characters more than one-diminsional.
C-3PO is very punny (oh haha) and R2-D2 seems to want his own action movie (Superdroid? Batrobot?) with his lift-off rockets. Obi-Wan's character is slightly annoying but at least he doesn't seem to be reading off a script in a school play anymore. I loved Ewan McGregor in Moulin Rouge, but he and Obi-Wan have some issues. He claims the worst line in this movie because of which I (blushes) burst out in laughter: ""Good call, my young Padowan!"" Then there are the lines that would-be ironic but are really just planned: Obi Wan--""You'll be the death of me, Anakin.""
Call me crazy, I can't wait for Anakin to be bad. One of the most powerful scenes was the scene in which he's mourning his mother and talking about power. The dictatorship scene and that scene both are incredibly acted and amazing. He will be a wonderful villain and I loved each and every dark scene, including the Anakin/Palpatine scenes, better than any others. The death star is also introduced in this movie, but it seems forced in rather than naturally flowing with it.
I saw this movie two times in a row and I'm glad I did. I will see it again. It is mainly for those with passion and feeling; if you are overly responsible or organized, this movie won't do anything for you. It is romantic, dark, funny at times, and thrilling. It is Star Wars.",1021680000,,2612,4.619354838709677
1324134,5,B00003CXKT,"Spectacular is a word that comes to mind after seeing Attack of the Clones.  Superb, brillant and best yet are others.  George Lucas takes the audience on a maginificent ride through Jedi Councils, the Senate, across the Galaxy, a beautiful romance and the building of a clone army.  We begin to see that Annakin, although a talented and powerful young Jedi, has some traits that will one day turn him to the dark side of the Force.  However for now Annakin and the stunning Amildada are destined for each other.  Their relationship is complicated by Annakin being a Jedi and Amildada a Senator but love does conquer all.  The scenery, costumes and characters are in my opinion, the best yet out of all the Star Wars series, actually I would say this is one of the best films I have ever seen.  Yoda is an all time personal favourite of mine and I was delighted to see his presence throughout the film.  He truly is, and always will be, the grand Master of all Jedis...",1021680000,,969,4.497142857142857
1324135,5,B00003CXKT,"Episode 1 [wasn't bad]. Jar Jar Binks [was really bad]. The kid who played anakin [was really bad]. But the rest of the movie was still pretty enjoyable. It wasn't the best in the series, but it had to set up five movies, so it's difficult to do that and make it good. Attack of the Clones, the next chapter in the Star Wars saga, tells the tale of Anakin as he's older, now learning to be a jedi. He falls in love with Padme Amidala, now a senator for the plante Naboo. Now, the love story isn't great, but it's not terrible. The romance between Leia and Han was much more interesting in Empire Strikes Back, which is the best of the series. Still, Hayden Christenson, who portrays Anakin in this film, really pulls it off. He's fantastic. There is a scene where you can look into his eyes, see all the hatred, and you know this man will become Darth Vader. That scene gave me chills.
This film also has Jedi's coming out the wazzoo. We get to see them in full swing, using force powers and swinging those lightsabers around. The best scene in the whole movie, as you've probably heard, is when yoda gets his game face on. Him and Count Dooku go at it with the force and later with lightsabers. Thsi scene made the entire audience erupt with cheers.
that's all I'm gonna say aobut the story, but I can guarantee if you disliked Episode 1, you will love this one alot. It feels alot more like the other films in the series, with better writing and better action scenes, this movie just all out kicks... Go see it now.",1021680000,,1517,4.3076923076923075

The acting is solid.  Contrary to critcs, I feel that Hayden Christianson performs very admirably as Anakin Skywalker, a well-meaning but obsessive Jedi who has trouble controlling his impulses. The rest of the cast also very good.
The romance is much more believable than Han and Leia's romance of the original trilogy.  While some of the dialogue during these scenes is admittedly cheesy, it is no worse lines from other films like ""You complete me"" (Jerry Mcquire)or ""I'll never let go"" (Titanic).  And those films won best picture!

The storyline is very entertaining and intriguing.  While Anakin and Padme are discovering their feelings, Obi-Wan Kenobi is tracking down a bounty hunter.  These coexisting storylines allow director George Lucas to do a much better job of pacing the film than he did in the previous installment (The Phantom Menace).  He also does a masterful job of bringing the story together at the end (very similar in style to the end of Empire).
Attack of the Clones may not be better than the original Star Wars or its sequel The Empire Strikes Back, but it is definitely their equal.
So sit back, relax, and enjoy Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.  Great fun for the whole family!",1021680000,,1433,4.788617886178862

Because he is brilliant.  Go find out what happened BEFORE and what events led up to the ""trilogy"" that we all learned to love when we were growing up.

John Williams' masterful music returns for the fifth time in the Star Wars galaxy without missing a beat. The enchanting battle sequences and special effects will not let you down. Even Master Yoda has gotten into the act by stealing the show with an array of lightsaber swings and blasts.

I was very impressed with the way that the movie developed the characters towards their imminent fates.  The casting was well done, the battles were exciting, and the plot was multi-forked and emotional.  Over all, my expectations were exceeded with this film, and we finally get to see Yoda fight!  At this rate, it's going to be hard to watch the original three movies.",1021593600,,544,4.56701030927835
1324140,4,B00003CXKT,"This movie was very good.  I'm not willing to declare it ""great"" at this point, but it was certainly worthy, and certainly far above my expectations based on my disappointment with The Phantom Menace.
Attack of the Clones has many of the same characters or their relatives as the other Star Wars movies, but it doesn't have the same feel, at least of the first two.  There is an irony in this based on the name of the movie.  This is not a clone.  The original Star Wars had no children, no overt romance, and the political implications of the Empire-rebel struggle were not well developed.  All that has changed, but Clones also gets away from being too heavily reliant on characters designed to appeal exclusively to children, like the hideous Jar Jar Binks, who makes a brief appearance in this movie only to be responsible for making a decision that essentially empowers the evil emperor.
This movie has two main story lines, the first having to do with Anakin Skywalker's raging hormones and the other having to do with the unfolding mystery that we all know leads to the rise of the Empire.  Both are predictable to the point that action scenes, while visually stunning, lack suspense.  The fall of Anakin is the less engaging of the two story lines, but it is not nearly as bad as it could have been.  Anakin gives in to love, rage, and every other teenage emotional impulse.  But what's the message?  That trying to save your mother necessarily leads to evil?  That falling in love has dire consequences?  To the extent that there is a message, it is about as developed as the politics of the original Star Wars, which is to say not very developed.
The second story line is very much a political thriller.  Though the ultimate outcome of the plot is known, the unfolding is engaging.  I especially dreaded the introduction of Jango Fett as an active villain as well as progenitor of the clones and father of Boba, however all of this was handled remarkably well.
The battle scenes in this movie are truly spectacular, and even Yoda's duel with Christopher Lee's character (Lee being almost as old as Yoda in real life, but still getting the job done as a villain) was carried off well.  On the whole I was very happy with Attack of the Clones and now look forward to the sixth and final movie much more than I looked forward to this one.",1021593600,,2345,4.563245823389021

He made this film for himself, great, why make us suffer with it? I saw it opening nite in full Digital form at Universal Studios Hollywood. The audience was very, very excited. But tragically, we all laughed at the wrong moments, see what I mean? Sometimes a film is so bad that it's almost good in the campy funny sense (think Zoolander). Anyway... I speak as a MAJOR Star Wars fan, someone wake up Lucas (maybe pal Spielberg?) and let someone else direct episode III lest the whole thing be a major, major waste.",1021593600,16,635,4.482758620689655
1324217,5,B00003CXKT,"Believe it or not, ""Attack of the Clones"" is the first ""Star Wars"" movie that I've ever seen and I must say that I was thrilled. From the opening scenes where Senator Padame Amidala arrives in the capital of the Republic, I was drawn into this science fiction epic.
 There is trouble brewing in the Republic and Senator Amidala has come to the capital to help in peace processes and somebody wants this young beauty dead. Anakin Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobe have been assigned the task of protecting Padame. After a short stay, Padame is sent back to her home planet and Anakin goes with her so he can protect her. Meanwhile, Obi Wan goes to a planet that is not listed in the archives of planets in the galaxy to search for a bounty hunter that tried to kill Senator Amidala. Dark forces are rising and the Republic is on the brink of war in this exciting film and you'll be entertained throughout the whole entire film.
 The imagary that is in this film is fantastic. The capital city is amazing to look at on screen and it is cool to see all of the spaceships flying in the air. Padame's home planet is beautiful as well. This is the first movie that has ever been shot on digital film and this change in the shooting makes a huge difference in what you see on the screen.
 The plot of this film is great and you will be immersed in a wonderful tale of good versus evil. The action sequences in this movie are great, especially the battle at the end. It is very cool to see a little guy like Yoda fight a in a duel with a lightsaber, as well. Everything about this movie was great. This is a must for any ""Star Wars"" fan and for novices like me this can be enjoyed without feeling like you have no clue what is going on. As a matter of fact, new people will be able to pick up what's going on. This is a non-stop action science fiction movie that will be enjoyed by any fan of science fiction movies. This is a definitely a must see film.

(hey im sorry I didn't email u I just got out of starwars. well since I wasn't dead this time watching it I will say it was better the second time around not much but better. the reason I didn't like it was because it didn't get anything done the very begining and the very end was totally different and at the end u asked yourself how did the beginning lead me here? the script was also bad and so was the lingo I mean I love you do you  love me just aint going to cut it. the movies goal was too hit important places it did that and with excellence but between that it rushed it and blobbed it. on the plus side the acting wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be the grown up anikin is so much more mature and is a better actor. Natalie portman was of course amazing and yoda stole the show. another wonderful aspect of this movie was the effects this movie was definitely the best looking movie ive ever seen it was shot on digital tape and it showed! Amazing! best look ive ever seen!!!! see it just for that. the foreshadowing of anakin was what really soled me on this movie the way u could see his emotions bobble in and out of rebellion was brilliant. ( the shadow on the wall is a gift too us from Lucas). the movie is also merely a setup it is getting us ready for episode 3 which Lucas can not AFORD TO SCREW UP. ok im sorry back too the negs the movie accomplished nothing it was like a huge theatrical trailer as soon as you saw the credits u were just now ready to start the movie. still its starwars and starwars has its own genre nothing will ever capture the heart and soul of the original serious. however episode 2 has now showed us to not totally give up on Lucas and that he still has magic up his sleeve. when the movie hit its high points which were only about three I could feel my self thinking ok now this is starwars but at the instant u thought that....... BOOM u would be pulled back under and u could just hear that jive from jar jar. that is why I give episode 2 a B.),1021593600,,2165,3.9770114942528734
1324220,4,B00003CXKT,"The hype of the Attack of the Clones though is less than that of the Phantom Menace, in fact it turns out to be a better production than its counterpart.
The story is a continuation of the Phantom Menace, in whcih Anakin Skywalker is now a grown up looking for a reunited love with his ""Angel"" Padme Amidela. Frankly, the performance of Hayden Christensen is not as promising as we saw in his audition clip. He has his moments and styles in certain scenes, but when it comes to talking about love with his ""Angel"", there is a lack of communicaiton between him and Natalie Portman. Natalie Portman is now easier to be appraoched for she is no longer a queen but a politician fighting for the diplomatic resolution with the separatist of the Republic. Nonetheless, her perfromance is in fact just average, despite there are lots of chances for her to perform. The best bit is her first denial of her feelings towards Anakin, and then she is more like a supporting role for Anakin. For Ewan McGregor, he has turned into a more sideline role with a big name as Obi-wen Kenobi again. He is more mature but somehow down played by his apprentice. He is strict to principles and actions with the Jedi Council but that in fact lead to a jealousy conspiracy of his apprentice. The care and tension between him and Anakin was well played. After all Ewan McGregor is an actor who can do more than just that, so there should be no difficulty for him.
A very common practice of EP II is that we have great expectations about different characters being advertised but at the end they are nothing more than very sideline plots. Probably because there are too many characters to talk about and time is running out, so ended up stories were not fully plotted and told when the movie ended.
The coolest part of the whole movie is the lightsaber fight of Yoda, in which it becomes the climax of the whole movie. It is sad that the glory of the movies was stolen by a digital creation, but he is Yoda, who can compete against him? The worst part is the young Boba Fett in which, the kid playing him is not cool and neither good at all. Could have found a better choice to play that part.
Overall speaking, Attack of the Clones is a much better production out of no expectation after the disappointing hype of the Phantom Menace. Nonetheless, better poster design should be applied next time as it is too unmatch with the whole movie. The same design works for Phantom Menace doesn't mean that it will work for other movies, for every movie has its own character.",1021593600,3,2541,4.478448275862069

1324224,3,B00003CXKT,"After seeing it last night, I left the theatre unsatisfied...
Yes the movie did have its pros, but cons were more than evident in the latest tale of the Star Wars saga.
First, Jar Jar is nowhere to be found... except for the five minutes he is in the picture.
Hayden did an excellent job of portraying Anakin... no complaints... he did great.
The special effects were great... In fact the whole movie was flooded with them.
The Bad...
I understand that the focus of the movie is to explain the romance between Anakin and Padme, but did they have to do it so corny?
I liked Jango Fett, but in typical Lucas style, the villian takes a back seat, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. However, more origin and screen time would have been more appropriate (especially considering that Jango is who the enitre clone army is based from).
And the worst thing about Episode 2, What did they do to Yoda? (I won't spoil the ending battle, but it is a disgrace. I have no idea why Lucas did this... I couldn't help myself but laugh at the stupidity of it. Its a shame it came to this...

I am a Star Wars fanatic and I have to say this is probably the best Episode yet, and ""Star Wars Episode III:(rumored title) Fall of the Jedi"" should be even better!!!

Yes, the special effects were first rate, state-of-the-art and many other superlatives. That, however, is as much as I can give the two stars I've rated. It appears film makers have lost touch with the ability to simply tell a story and George Lucas, sorry to say, is the latest victim. Sorry, George, space ships and flying Jedi alone won't make it! This movie fails horribly to convey a cogent story line. The love interest, let alone marriage, between ""Anakin"" and ""Amidala"" is far from believable. The movie quickly jumps from one fight scene to battle to fight scene without any reason. It's so fragmented and choppy in its editing it becomes difficult to follow. Like him or not, ""Jar Jar"" is back and as irritating as ever. This is a movie which exalts special effects leaving room for little else and a script which seldom allows the actors to ply their trade. The acting did convince me of one thing, though.

(my opinion of course) Obi Wan seemed no more skilled than he did in the Phantom Menace (which was a let down 'cause I'm a fan)despite the fact that he had a lot more action in this film. I felt like slapping Hayden's character, Anikan, a few times. He was a nagging, whinning,'you're not the boss of me' disrespectful little teen who's emotions got the better of more than twice in this movie. I guess that's the character though. (Loved the fight scenes.) My eyes widened and I readjusted my booty in the seat as the pace started picking up near the end of the movie. The tie breaker and highlight in this movie, and I think a lot of people will agree, was the master himself, Yoda. *how'd they get the puppet's hand to stay in there? *<blinks> hehe. j/k.

I went and saw ""Attack of the Clones"" not nine hours ago, and have this to report of the movie:
Whilst it is in parts an action bonanza, Episode Two is not really BETTER than the movies from the original trilogy.  Some of the scenes in episode two are far, far superior to those witnessed in episodes four, five and six.  However, the movie fails to gel as a viewing experience - the initial scenes, whilst quite enthralling, quickly digress into an insipid love affair between Anakin and Amidala.  This part of the film, which truly made me want to fall asleep, persists for well over an hour and makes up the bulk of the film.
However, despite the laborious love sub-plot, Star Wars episode two contains within its busty innards some of the most scintillating scenes yet viewed in a Star Wars movie.
The opening scenes, involving a speeder chase through Coruscant are both highly detailed and very entertaining.  Obi-Wan's confrontation with Jango-Fett is superb, and the penultimate lightsaber scene is perhaps by itself worth the price of admission.
Overall, I believe this movie is worth seeing.  If you are a Star Wars fan, you will probably marvel at quite a few of the genuinely entertaining- and yes, sometimes amusing- scenes in Attack of the Clones, and probably forgive the many cloying, unimaginative romantic moments.
Be prepared to see both the good and the dark sides of George Lucas' creative powers.  But, overall, be secure in the knowledge that this film is far superior to 'The Phantom Menace' and definitely NOT a waste of your money.",1021593600,,1560,4.802238805970149
1324287,1,B00003CXKT,"Why does a picture like Star Wars: Episode Whatever make so much money?  Why do people see it?  I did not get the idea until I saw that piece of trash last night.  Judging from the moronic clapping and shouting that came of 2/3 of the audience when scenes like Yoda's light saber battle were shown, I am guessing the emotional maturity of the crowd ceased it's progression at age four.  The actors were horrid.  Probably the worst performances in the last decade of film.  George Lucas is the absolute worst director in the history of cinema.  A director like Harmony Korine could take a [price] hand-held camera and make something that relates to human emotions in a new way.  George Lucas spends millions and... ugh.  People I have talked to use the argument: ""You just don't like sci-fi.""  Does sci-fi have to include terrible acting, terrible direction, and no emotional involvement from the viewer?  Tarkovsky's Solaris was the closest a sci-fi film came to being intellectual.  Star Wars is garbage.  And this ""epic saga"" changes people's lives?  When someone tells me a movie has changed their life, I assume that it has some relevence with their own life.

1324289,4,B00003CXKT,"Here we go again with absolutely the best special and visual effects, costumes and characters the sci-fi film world has ever seen, and thank the Maker these forgive the atrocious acting of most of the characters.
Sitting with an opening night audience of over 1200 people, the majority of us were laughing out loud at the stilted, stiff, soap-opera quality level of dialog and delivery of Anakin and Amidala, as well as others who sounded like they were reciting cue cards, including Samuel Jackson and another person I won't reveal.  Lucas gave adult love banter to teenagers, and it fails miserably.  They are no better, if not worse, than Calvin Klein Obsession commercials.
Worse, the development of their relationship and their characters is not only unbelievable, it's almost unbearable.  These are 2 of the worst actors I've ever seen, but the action and plot make up for them.  Christopher Lee as Count Dooku (of all names), however, is the ultimate bad guy and never fails to deliver with every scene and word.  The droids, as always, are hilarious and charming.
On a positive note, Lucas has expanded his plot to cover considerably more ground than the last episode, as well as be far more understandable to a broader mainstream of viewers.  We are taken to many new visually stunning worlds, as well as familiar ones, given more insight to existing characters, and best of all, given a tantalizing taste of what is still to come.
Clones also takes scenery and battle scenes beyond the next level, with unparalleled sound that will shake your fillings and visuals that will delight your eyes.  The chase and fight scenes alone are worth the ticket (too bad that's all that's notable).  It's also a lot of fun to see how the story continues to wind up to the beginning of A New Hope.

1324290,5,B00003CXKT,"Man, this was Hayden Christensen's movie.  Here's the good and the bad.
THE GOOD:
Anakin:
Hayden Christensen was absolutely marvelous as Anakin.  Everything he did was right on the mark.  Everything from teenage rebellion, to rage, to angst, to love.  Everything a teenager hits for the first time growing up.  He nailed it all.
Obi-Wan:
Anakin didn't like Obi-Wan always ripping on him.  And you could tell that Obi-Wan didn't want to be the nagging parent, always ripping on the kid.  But, the kid was being stupid, and Obi-Wan just did what he had to do, like it or not.
The scene where Obi-Wan gets a drink at the bar was priceless.  That will be a classic.
Amidala:
Beautiful, but I've always been a pushover for long dark hair and big brown eyes.
Getting stripped down to a bare midrif for the entire final battle: Yummy!  Almost as good as Leah in Jabba's court.
Most of her scenes were right on, but some of the love scenes kind-of dragged on, but that was more of a script problem.  Plus she was definitely more stuffy than Anakin was about showing her feelings, but that was in character as Amidala, she actually did loosen up from her Queen days.
THE BAD:
Yoda:
The CG Yoda just didn't work at all.  He looked flat and cartoonish through every scene he was in.
Yoda, the commanding general, seemed very out of character for the mischievous yet serious Yoda we saw in Empire.  Why does Yode have to be the best at everything?
Yoda getting jiggy with his light saber.  Sorry that didn't do anything for me.  I would have skiped the Yoda duel in favor of Dooku fighting Anakin with a light saber in each hand for a full 4 minutes instead.
Jar-Jar:
That was quite a stretch to go from a clumsy, bumbling idiot of the first movie, to the somber, noble, and elegant Jar-Jar of the second movie.  Every scene he was in, I was expecting him to trip over his own robes.  The fact that he didn't was strangely out of charater for him.
R2D2 & C3PO:
R2 flying, that was a stretch.  Why hasn't he done it before?
R2D2 & C3PO doing an Abott and Costello routine during the final battle was just annoying.
The Clappers:
How did that scene from Galaxy Quest get in a Star Wars movie?  I was expecting Segorny Weaver to come out and say ""whoever wrote that episode should be shot"".
CONCLUSION:
Basically this was Hayden Chistensen's movie, he carried the show, everyone else was just along for the ride.  Every scene he was in worked, and every scene he wasn't in fell flat.  Fortunately he was in most of the scenes of the movie.",1021593600,7,2524,4.445652173913044
1324291,3,B00003CXKT,"...  First off, prior to Episode I, George hadn't been behind the camera as a director since the mid-70's to direct the original Star Wars movie......while his time was well spent in doing more for sound and visual effects than any other individual, and dragging the movie theaters into the next millenium via digital projection.....well, he has fallen short in the other aspects of his filmmaking.  While the effects in this film were stunning, they rather took over the film, and made it difficult to focus on the elements we were supposed to be watching (battle scenes mostly), additionally, everything looked *too* darn good!  Remember the slightly gritty realism of the first three movies?  I felt more like I was watching a video game or a cartoon than a film.  The worst, however (and it pains me to say it almost as much as it hurts to think back on it) was the truly flat dialogue, and almost unanimously poor acting performances.  With the exception of Anakin (who needs to take some lessons and go back to soaps), I don't believe this was really the fault of the actors, but of the director.  When Liam Neeson (from Ep I), Samuel L. Jackson, Natalie Portman, and Ewan McGregor, all actors of notable talent, can come across so stale....well, I'm afraid there's a reason for it.  The two baddies ""Senator Palpatine"" and ""Count Dooku"" were able to come out a bit better as they are both veteran actors who could likely do the parts with nearly no direction at all.  The love story was just darned uncomfortable and annoying to watch, Anakin needed a good kick in the pants and sure didn't come across as someone who had just spent 10 YEARS training as a Jedi.  More like 10 minutes.  Natalie would have been able to do better with a better leading man, cause all I felt up there was hormones...not heat or passion.  I felt like I was watching a teen TV show, not a blockbuster movie.  Yeesh....  About the only thing that saved this from being a complete disappointment was the decision to have Yoda kick some serious tail!  It got the best cheer out of the whole film.....and I think everybody walked out knowing that Yoda is *indeed* a Jedi Master.  The music was excellent.....John Williams can do no wrong.  The costumes, creature and ships were all impressive.....but all was overshadowed by the fact that half of the fans in that theater could have written a better script than we saw.  George, some people simply need to play to their strengths, and yours is apparently *not* directing anymore.  Collaborate with a strong  director and writer, and then just step aside and handle the effects that you are so good at.  I adore Star Wars as much as anyone, but have seen enough good and bad films to recognize each when I see them.",1021593600,,2745,4.630165289256198
1324292,5,B00003CXKT,"Truly one of the greatest sci-fi epics to grace the screen, AOTC succeeds in every way a Star Wars film should and beyond.  Honestly, pay no mind to the jaded and vitriolic critics or those so-called fans who endlessly nitpick and spew empty vitriol, this film is an incredible must-see experience that builds upon itself to its stunning and breathtaking conclusion! You will want to see this film again and again!
Without giving away too many spoilers, the plot is both complex, yet not difficult to follow (especially if you've been paying attention over the years), expanding the machiavellian theme of the rise of the ultimate dictator to power.  Here the tragedy grows and begins to unfold, weaving everyone in its fatal web.  Events that take place in this film aid in understanding several events from 1999's Phantom Menace while at the same time building enormous anticipation for the final and darkest installment.  While never a Jar Jar hater myself, his character's purpose in this film demonstrates that Lucas knew what he was doing all along.  Indeed the satiric, yet subtle social and political commentary he makes is both relevant and accurate.  Nevertheless, make no mistake, this is first and foremost an action film!
If there's anything negative I could say, it's that the action and sheer spectacular and riveting scenes may tend to make the old trilogy seem a trifle slow!  But this is a good fault, after all!
The other main plot is of course Anakin and his relationships -- both with Obi Wan and Padme Amidala.  These are handled perfectly.  The acting is superb from everyone involved and the love story works on a level different from what you might expect.  I kept hearing from the critics that the dialogue was cheesy, blah, blah, blah...  The fact remains that the dialogue is NO different from any other Star Wars film.  It works for this kind of film.  If you're looking for Shakespeare or have an inability to relate to anyone beside post-modern, ultra-hip, anti-hero Gen-Xrs, then go elsewhere -- Star Wars is just not for you.
In conclusion, if you are a fan of Star Wars, or simply a fan of great movies, you will absolutely love this film!  I can't wait to go see it again!  It is witty and intense and a wild ride through an amazing universe filled with exotic new planets, fearsome creatures, an array of fantastic ships, lightsaber battles, Sith Lords and powerful Jedi.  It's got R2 and 3PO (who are just hysterical!), Christopher Lee (if you loved him in LOTR, you'll love him here!), Jango and Boba Fett and so much more!  Oh and did I mention Yoda!  You'll just have to wait and see!",1021593600,,2624,4.742290748898679
1324293,3,B00003CXKT,"Does an excellent job of showing how the Imperial Empire came into power... a much clearer picture of the conspiracy of the ""Emporor"" to gain power, and control a vast army. The story was good... very slow for the first 1/3 of the movie, but picked up steam and ended with lots of action. The special effects were good, but not outstanding. Thankfully the role of that annoying Jar-Jar was very limited. Some good laughs in there too including C3PO getting his head swapped with another droid. We also get to see Yoda in combat which is cool... though I still don't get how he could stagger in to the room with a cane one minute, then turn into Jackie Chan the next.
PEEVE #1: Firstly, I expected a smooth transition from the sweet little ""Annie"" to the evil tyrant ""Vader"". But right from the beginning, Anakin comes off as this know-it-all teenager with an attitude, acting like a 5-year old who pouts at anything that doesn't go his way. I found him just plain annoying and wished that he would shut up with his whining. Surely any Jedi training him would have noticed that this kid needs a serious boot to the head. It would have been better if his change to the dark side was the result of bitterness towards some major wrong-doing that he sustained... perhaps a betrayal of some sort. Lucas tried to induce that bitterness with the death of Anakin's mother, but honestly his downfall started with his ""head up the..."" attitude right from the beginning of the movie. We are left to assume that during the 10 years that have elapsed since the Phantom Menace, something has hardened him... but we have no idea what.
PEEVE #2: Some of the lines were just plain bad, and the acting didn't help. They acted like robots and the dialog was very artificial.
Conclusion? Well, if you are a Star Wars fan, then you gotta see it... regardless of how bad the reviews are. Otherwise, wait until it comes out on video.",1021593600,,1909,4.536231884057971
1324294,4,B00003CXKT,"I loved A NEW HOPE (BOOK IV). I liked THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (BOOK V). I loved RETURN OF THE JEDI (BOOK VI). I adored THE PHANTOM MENACE (BOOK I-EVEN THOUGH SOME PANNED IT; I SAW IT 11 TIMES). I was fairly disappointed and even bored with ATTACK OF THE CLONES.
First the good stuff. The story I would give 4.5 stars out of 5. I thought it was an excellent and subtle transition into the future of Anakin, the empire and the Jedi. The visual/special effects I would give 5 stars. Once again top notch Lucas. The cinematography/camera work was 4.5 stars. Good scenery and nice placement. As for art and set work= 5 stars. I love that Italian palace they use for the Queen's residence. As for Ewan, Natalie and Samuel= they each get 4 stars out of 5. I love Ewan. He was wonderful as the Jedi master turned teacher turned frustrated educator. Natalie was beautiful and once again had those soft and sexy eyes. The costumes were standard to this story and world. I give them 4 stars.
Now for the others. Hayden (teen Anakin) was awful. He was a worse choice than the very young Anakin. He was too stiff and acted as those this was his first time in front of the camera. He was unrelaxed, over zealous and reminded me of Wesley Crusher from STTNG. There could have been a better choice. Christopher Lee as Count Dooku was weird. I can't explain it better than that.
The best thing about the entire movie was not until approximately 30 minutes near the ending, when every single Jedi member fought the Trade Federation's army. Awesome fight scene. Even better than the Gungans versus the Droids from PHANTOM.
I will probably go see this about 1 or 2 more times just to get more comfortable with the film. It is worth seeing, if you are a fan.",1021593600,,1737,4.414330218068536
1324355,2,B00003CXKT,"Flat out, Episode II is not great. In fact, it's not even that good. There is NO action for the first hour and a half except for a brief chase scene in the beginning of the film. As Homer Simpson would say: SOOOOOOOO BORING. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge Star Wars fan who grew up on the original franchise which makes Attack of the Clones even more of a disappointment. Besides the aforementioned lack of action, the acting especially Hayden Christiansen is terrible. Yoda who was touted as having an expanded role in Episode II is scattered throughout the film at best. Although easily the best scene in Episode II is seeing Yoda get some swordplay against a rogue jedi, the scene only lasts about five minutes. The last hour of Clones does pick up in intensity, fighting, and action but it still can't save the film. The fighting, while entertaining leads to no ultimate payoff. Leaving the theater I felt no satisfaction whatsoever and I can honestly say that I enjoyed Episode I: The Phantom Menace much more. The FX are amazing in Clones but the story is too much to fit into a 2 1/2 hour film. Which leads to Episode III and as Yoda would say: ""Clouded this films future is, indeed."" Lucas has lost the pulse of the Star Wars films.",1021593600,3,1241,4.447368421052632
1324356,5,B00003CXKT,"I was 6 when I watched Empire Strikes Back with my parents in Pasadena, CA.  The buzz around that movie, the weeks of anticipation before the movie release, the wait in line, the experience of a great audience and the feeling of walking out of that theatre culminated into one of the best memories of my childhood.  Admittedly, I had no expectations for this second SW Prequel movie.  In fact, I was prepared to HATE this movie as I did EP1.  Lo and behold, I was proven wrong from beginning to end.  While the dialogue (particularly the love scenes) were below par, the entire movie itself was pure Star Wars magic.  I was thoroughly entertained and my faith in Lucas restored.
Anakin, played by Hayden Christiansen, was perfect as a stretched out, tormented and lost youth, despite his guidance by Master Obi Wan (Ewan MacGregor).  Senator Amidala, played by the beautiful Natalie Portman was perfect as one of the primary foci of Anakin's angst.  Count Dooku played by the Legendary Christopher Lee has become one of my favorite bad guys (for reasons which I will leave to you to find out 8D ).  And Master Yoda proves why he is one of the Greatest Jedi to have lived.  Temeura Morrison plays great as Jango Fett and his father and son team with a young Boba Fett (___ Logan) was great.
I can go on and on with the characters, but it's the overall feel of the movie that just took me away to a place I haven't been to in quite a while.  While EP1 is still inexcusable in my book; I, like many others, would like my prequel to start with this movie.  I'm quite saddened to think that just when Lucas got the formula right, there will be only one (Ep3) prequel left to film.  All in all, the last six months and the next 3 years has me ecstatic.  Lord of the Rings : FOTR was a dream come true as was this chapter in the Star Wars Saga.  For the critics who have shot down EP2, feel free to ally yourself with the Darkside.  This film is not perfect, but to me, the soul of the film and the heart of George Lucas really stood out.  There are definitely flaws in EP2, but to nitpick and to compare this film as a disaster like TPM would be criminal.  In my humble opinion, this party has just begun.

1324359,3,B00003CXKT,"... Ive really seen it now though :) and its AVERAGE. Its a long film, and in order to fit into the future we already know about, it does have a lot of ground to cover. It does this very well indeed - the introduction of Boba Fett, an insight of the power of the Jedis and yoda in particular, the emotional turmoil and unstable mind of Anakin Skywalker. The plot to fit into the Star Wars timeline basically works well, but the film itself is a bit of a letdown. The dialogue is often stilted, the acting wooden and some scenes are very cheesey indeed. The acting though isn't THAT bad - i often felt that it was good actors struggling with bad lines rather than bad actors ruining what they had. Ewan McGregor does well, he seems to be turning into Alec Guiness and his manner is perfect for a jedi, with his often rude and arrogant apprentice providing a nice intro into tensions to come.
The action is certainly spectacular, but relationships between characters are fairly weak, unlike the original trilogy. No one is as annoying in this as Jar Jar and Anakin were in Episode I, but the film just seems to be trying too hard to get to a particular point in a pre arranged history and feels less than natural. Overall, a slight improvement over Episode One and a film I will certainly see again, but ultimately not as good as it could have been. My vote is for a different director for the next one - look at Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi - different directors meant Mark Hamil and a muppet had believable and genuinly moving scenes on a gloomy swamp set. Bring it back George, special effects are a compliment to the actors not a replacement.",1021593600,,1658,4.386363636363637
1324360,4,B00003CXKT,"...and now we have to wait for another three years to see its conclusion. WOW. Episode II is definitely MUCH better than Episode I. I would even say it's better that Return of the Jedi. If Lucas keeps up the good work then Episode III will be on a par with A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back.
You can see the plot elsewhere so I'll just try to summarize what was good about it and what was bad about it.
Good:
1. The characters. Almost every one of them (with the notable exception of Amidala - I'll get to that below) delivers a superb performance. I was especially pleasantly surprised by Hayden (Anakin). He fits the role perfectly: the impetuos young Jedi padawan, reckless, impulsive, ambitious, overly confident of himself, lacking patience, determined to be the greatest Jedi ever. But we see as well his occasional bursts of fury, his inner torments and demons, which predict his eventual fall to the Dark Side. We see as well all temptations and trials he is subjected to - his forbidden attraction to Amidala, his love for his mother and how what happens to her affects him - and we can understand how his fall to the Dark Side begins. All the others are good as well: Obi-Wan, Yoda, Mace Windu, Count Dooku.
2. The plot. There are actually two epic lines: Obi-Wan discovering the hidden clone army and dealing with the conspiration and Padme vs. Anakin. The first one is VERY good. The enemy (Sidious) is almost unseen, he doesn't have more than a couple of lines in the entire movie, yet you can feel his presence everywhere, see the shadow of his actions begging to take shape. His is a masterful plan to take over the Republic which nobody sees; he fools all with intelligence. This is the kind of bad guy I love. Also great are all the scenes on the planet where Obi-Wan discoveres the clones and his confrontations with Jango Fett. Suspense, adrenaline and an eerie feeling of outworldliness.
3. The special effects - settings. Each planet has its own distinctive individuality and is created in such detail you cannot believe it is not real. Coruscant: high towers, lights, traffic, agitation. Naboo: beautiful landscapes, waterfalls, pastorality. Clone planet: water, white, rain. Conspiration planet: red, volcanoes, machinery, inhabitans which resemble giant flies. Absolutely stunning.
4. All the small tidbits which are SW trademark, which give us old-timers a feeling of home coming: movie opens with a ship in space, somebody has a bad feeling, Artoo saves the day, Threepio gets into trouble, Obi-Wan jests to Anakin ""I've got a feeling you're going to be the end of me"" - how true...
5. Lightsaber duels. They are PERFECT. They are shot continuously (not like in TPM where they were always interrupted by other epic threads) and are suspenseful. They even manage to make Yoda duel without him becoming hilarious - he's great, in fact.
Now for the bad parts:
1. Except for the race between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett in the asteroid field, there isn't any space battle at all. All battles take place on the ground.
2. The love-story between Anakin and Padme is clumsily done, rushed and forced. I kept comparing it to Han/Leia and it doesn't stand a chance. Also, Padme was the greatest disappointment in the movie. She is downgraded from the stately royal presence and aloofness to a good-looking young woman who does nothing but get herself into trouble. There were some plot holes here as well: she keeps telling Anakin how they shouldn't be together but keeps provoking him by wearing the most revealing outfits. She is supposed to be travelling undercover in order to avoid her enemies but keeps wearing the most shining costumes.
Oh, but you can skip over the bad parts and enjoy the movie. It is really something.
P.S. In case you were wondering: Jar Jar has less than 5 minutes screen time.",1021593600,,3819,4.753012048192771
1324361,3,B00003CXKT,"I recently saw Episode II.  I was one of the many lemmings that decided that it was a good idea to go see this much anticapted movie.  Let me tell you that I was very disapointed in Episode I I was one of the many who was let down big time on that film.  But that was okay, not every director can live up to there expectations.  I decided to forget about that movie which most people would like to (please everyone get off of cloud nine, even Lucas said that Episode I wasn't very well written, even though he had what 20 years...anyway).  And go into this movie with some of the highest expectations.  My mistake.  THe movie was agian a bore.  But it was well written.  But still a bore.  Maybe i lay the blame to the acting but Portman, Jackson, and McGregor did a great job so who does that leave.  Oh let me see the guy who played ANIKIN.

1324362,5,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones
Review by Thomas Medford
Grade: A-
SUMMARY:
George Lucas tells a beautifully crafted story rich with fine acting, witty dialogue, and amazing special effects.
WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS
Despite what critics have said, ""Star Wars: Episode II-Attack of the Clones"" is a wonderful, fun filled adventure in a galaxy far, far away. There are a few problems with the script, the pacing, and the acting is a little stiff in places, but George Lucas has, for the most part, succeeded with creating a visually compelling, dramatically focused, and very emotional film. Much like ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Lucas has dwelled into darker territory with ""Clones"", as we begin to see Anakin Skywalker's inevitable descent to the Dark Side. We also get to see the beginning of the end for the Galactic Republic, and its transformation into the Empire.
First of all, the movie is way too short. Sure, it has the longest running time of all of the SW films, but, even at 142 minutes, it isn't nearly enough to completely tell the story to its full capacity. The film moves as a ferocious pace, and not enough time was given to a lot of scenes. The love story, for example, feels extremely rushed. Likewise with the scenes on Tatooine. Not enough screen time was given to Owen Lars, and Beru Whitesun. Owen has maybe 2 lines of dialogue, while Beru had none. I felt that the scenes with them had the potential to be something great, but they did little more than stand around, and their exsistence was rather pointless. This was a big disappointment for me. Another thing that let me down was the fact that Jar Jar's role was little more than a cameo. I enjoyed him in EPISODE I, and I was hoping he would have a bigger part in this movie, but he didn't. As subtle as it is, though, his actions that set the rise of the Empire in motion are priceless. People might laugh at the fact that he was partly responsible for the fall of the Republic, but, it really made me feel sorry for him. He was doing what he thought was in the best interest of the galaxy, and it makes his character a tragic one. As small as they are, those are the only complaints I had about the movie. Everything else was great. I found the acting to be very enjoyable. Ewan MgGregor does a fine job as Obi Wan Kenobi, and he offers some pretty good laughs during the movie. My favorite line: ""...You're going to be the death of me."" Hayden Christensen is terrific as Anakin Skywalker. He brings a lot of intensity and emotion to the role, and, at times, you can't help but feel sorry for him. Natalie Portman also does a good job as Senator Amidala. Some of her lines fall flat, but, for the most part, she's pulls the role off nicely. Her and Hayden had pretty good chemisty, and you really felt as those these 2 were in love. The rest of the cast is excellent, expecially Ian McDirmid, Samuel L. Jackson, and, of course, Christopher Lee.
What can I say about the special effects? Incredible, awe-inspiring, jaw-dropping. Those are just a few select words that only begin to describe the visuals in ""Attack of the Clones"". Everything, from the mesmerizing metropolis of Courascant, to the breathtaking final battle on Geonosis, is a wonder. The action scenes are spectacular, especially the high octane chase through Courascant. The sound effects are just as awesome. My favorite would have to the sonic chargers in the asteroid field. You'll have to hear it to believe it.
The score, by John Williams, is great, as always. Like the movie itself, the music is dark, with some haunting themes, and adrenaline pumping action pieces. The love theme is remarkably beautiful, and is arguably the best theme from all of the SW movies. The use of The Imperial March in ""Clones"" is excellent. The scene after the Tuskin slaughter where Anakin breaks down is one of the most dramatic scenes in the entire movie, and when The Imperial March begins to play, I felt chills all over.
Even with all of these great aspects, the one that truly hits home is the range of storytelling. This is where George really nails it. The way everything starts to fall in place is abolutely masterful, as Anakin slowly begins his transformation into the evil Darth Vader, the beginning of the Clone Wars, the fall of the Republic, and the rise of the Empire. The final sequence of the movie will no doubt send chills down your spine, as it gives you the feeling of the impending doom that's about to be unleashed upon the galaxy.
Even with its faults, ""Attack of the Clones"" proves that George Lucas still has it in him to create an epic story that not only offers a huge treat for the ears and eyes, but a film rich with exhilarating emotions, raw intensity, and beautifully crafted drama.",1021507200,,4756,4.603062426383981
1324363,5,B00003CXKT,"If you, like many, were dissapointed by Episode I, Episode II vindicates George Lucas. The screenplay again become a central element of the movie, as opposed to Episode I, where the story was weak, to the point of becoming empty. In spite of the fact that tons of scenes are shot against blue screens totally pack the movie, performances are very well accomplished: in particular Natalie Portman's and Samuel L. Jackson's (anyone surprised by this?). Also you will be delighted by some moments in the movie where C-3PO and R2-D2 bring back the best memories from Episode IV (the first Star Wars, just in case). This time around also the backgrounds are far more impressing (in Coruscant, for instance). John William's music, as usual, plays a huge role.
On the downside, Hayden Christensen's performance pales when compared to almost everyone else's. Also, some battle scenes were not rendered to the high level of quality that Lucas got us used to in Episode I, therefore looking like Video Games in the end. However, these two negative elements are not enough to take away the five star condition of the movie...this is trully the Star Wars sequel that everyone had waited for.",1021507200,,1179,4.9
1324364,2,B00003CXKT,"Just saw Episode II.  Let your fears be dissuaded...it's a lot better than Episode I.  That said, there's a lot to hate about this movie.  While the story is great, perhaps one of the best to date, the screenplay is awful, with dialog that's painful to listen to, and scenes which are totally unnecessary to the plot and bog down the action.  The special effects, while extremely impressive, do nothing to hide the fact that they are special effects.  It feels like you are watching a cartoon with live actors thrown in.  Nothing looks real.  The acting is good in parts, but only parts.  Mostly it's the dialog's fault--the actors just can't do anything with these bad, bad lines.  Hadden is great as Anakin and should be interesting to watch in the third film.  Portman, however, is horrible and proves once and for all that Episode One was not a fluke.  Ewan is pretty good most of the time, which is nice, and he's given the more interesting story of the two.  Sam Jackson's got nothing.  Yoda...Yoda's fantastic.  Unfortunately the droids, however, have some of the most painful puns in the entire movie.  Script doctor, please!  Help!  The score is one of William's most redundant.  Other than the notable Love Theme and some other original music you probably won't be humming when you leave the theater, most of the film's music is just ripped off from other Star Wars movies, most notably Episode One, where it seems Williams is just recycling music in favor of actually doing something original.
Anyway, if you want to see this movie, I can't stop you.  Go see it.  I'm going to see it at least one more time.  But don't say I didn't warn you.  This is going to end up being one of the worst films of the year, just watch.  And what makes me so angry is that there is so much in the movie to love, and Lucas just ruins is through his own arrogance.  (I would tell you the good parts, but that would involve spoilers, which I'll spare you from).",1021507200,2,1953,4.498575498575499
1324431,2,B00003CXKT,"Slow, tedious prequel to Lucas's megahit saga, has young Anakin traveling back to Naboo with Senator Amidala as her protector while Obi-Wan pursues the bloodthirsty bounty hunter Jango Fett, and stumbles across a seemingly endless army of clones in the process. Like its predecessor THE PHANTOM MENACE, this contains enough exhausting visual effects to sink a boat, but they don't pack any of the punch they should. This, along with laughable politics, cardboard-thin characters, ridiculous sexual chemistry between the two leads and a monotonous battle at the end make this pitiful instalment easily the worst of the entire saga yet. EPISODE 1 actually looks good by comparison. One of the first films to be shot of HD Video, but who cares?",1021507200,2,741,5.132231404958677
1324432,3,B00003CXKT,"but....there's still a lot left to be desired. The potential for a great story line is there, but hiring Natalie Portman and Haydn Christensen to play the star-crossed lovers Amidala and Anakin was a mistake too big to ignore. Their performances are wooden, stilted, and made me wish that they'd just get on with it and stop shilly-shallying. The emotions that should be there simply weren't.
Portman and Christensen are not entirely to blame for their lack of expressiveness in their dialogue: Lucas is definitely the author of most of the dialogue in this film, and it shows - painfully. However, there are bright moments to this film: Threepio and R2-D2 are back (and Threepio's even fully-garbed this time!) in classic form, and are a brilliant, if all-too-necessary, comic relief.
The special effects are dazzling, if at times overwhelming. Especially fascinating was the planet Camino, composed entirely of water, with unceasing rain. There are, of course, the requisite bizarre creatures and wild new locales, and these are done in the height of Star Wars creativity - you've NEVER seen anything like some of these before!
Amidala's costumes are as peculiar, and for the most part, astoundingly UGLY, as ever - what would happen if one combined the contents of a Goth's closet with Britney Spears', with a little Navaho Indian and Japanese Geisha thrown in for good measure. Apparently Anakin likes them, though - for the duration of the film he gazes at her alternately with a puppy-like longing and a mysterious stare which I take (and hope) to be passionate conflict. It's hard to tell, with Christensen, whether he'd like to kill one or kiss one, going strictly by his looks. He acts more like James Dean than a proper Padawan.
The film has its moments of redemption: apart from the 'droid humour afore mentioned, we get to actually SEE Jedi in action, and it's visually stunning. Even Yoda gets to have his moment. The long-enigmatic tale of Jango and Boba Fett is also further related, with a surprising twist to it.
A final word of warning - this film is 2 hrs. 20 mins. long, and feels every minute (perhaps more) of its length. But I'd still recommend it: to see Star Wars (any Star Wars) in the theatre, with a box of popcorn in your hands and your eyes fixed on the glowing images before you, is an experience to remember. So go, settle into your seat, and watch as the lights dim, and the oh-so-familiar-but-still-magical yellow letters begin to roll, and forget about critics - ""Feel the Force!""",1021507200,,2515,4.824074074074074
1324433,4,B00003CXKT,"I was hoping episode II would not be as bad as episode I. I was not disappointed. Other than some flat acting and clich-ridden dialogue, the movie was pretty good. In a plot neatly lifted from ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""The Gladiator"", ""We Were Soldiers"", plus a few scenes borrowed from several Maxfield Parrish paintings, and we are off for the ride of our lives.
Anny Skywalker and Queen, now Senator, Amidala find love on the eve of a major galactic war. I had an attack of the groans when Jar Jar Binks appeared in the opening scenes and spoke a few lines. Fortunately, he disappeared early on and I settled back to enjoy what I enjoy most about the Star Wars saga; the creatures, the costumes, and the special effects.
Late in the epic Christopher Lee, a villain's villain, encounters Obi and Anny. After quickly dispatching the two Jedi he goes mano a green-midget with Master Yoda in what proves to be the best scene in the movie, and probably the most excellent sword fight, light-saber, sequence I have ever seen.

1324434,3,B00003CXKT,"Having just seen Attack of the clones on the big screen I felt I can now write a review, unlike some people who have seen the trailers and decided to rate this film. The fight scenes are great, no doubt about it. However the acting from some of the cast is shakey at best, Ewan is good as Obi Wan, as expected of him he delievers his character very well. The plot is better than Phantom Menace, and flows well in the film. However there is a lot of jumping to and fro from one character to another, it is almost a relief when they hooked up together. The last 30 min are the best by far, but this film is lacking an evil bad guy like the first three. Jango Fett does not live up to the hype, and Christopher Lee is only involved at the end really,there is just no Darth Vader. I think that if Mr Lucas had let someone else direct the acting would be a little better, and the heavy use of CG does not help them fit into their roles. Worth a see, but The Two Towers is still the one to wait for.",1021507200,,993,3.97

Sure, this one still has some poorly-written dialogue, and some cheesy scenes. But, it makes up for it with the MOST FUN ending sequence I've ever seen in a movie. I've never had more fun in a movie than in this one. Don't pay any attention to the critics that don't like it - they never liked the first 3 anyway. This is 10x better than Spiderman, and will surely stand well against the original trilogy throughout the test of time.",1021507200,,546,4.525252525252525
1324437,3,B00003CXKT,"I just had the pleasure of seeing this movie, and while it is not as good as the original trilogy (or at least not as good as A New Hope and Empire Strikes Back) it is a far superior movie to Phantom Menace.  In Attack of the Clones there are no parts where I think to myself, ""That scene was just STUPID!"" for two reasons: Jar Jar's character is minimal, and a decent actor has finally taken the role of Anakin.
The action sequences, also, are very well done.  Yoda's fight scene could either have been really laughable or really cool, and it is luckily the latter--he is simply amazing with the lightsaber.  The other action sequences are also well-done, though the action scene on Coruscant took a little longer than was probably necessary, and the scene on the Kamino landing platform didn't feel long enough.  There are also a lot of nice parallels to Empire Strikes Back.
However, the reason this movie doesn't compare very well to Empire Strikes Back or A New Hope is a result of two things: lack of plot flow, and poor dialogue.  When watching this movie, as in Phantom Menace, I felt that George Lucas in his mind wanted certain things to happen but wasn't sure how to have them happen.  The result, unfortunately, is a movie that is somewhat difficult to get in the mood of.  The same goes for the dialogue, especially most of Anakin's lines and the love scenes between Anakin and Padme.  Christensen and Portman don't have a whole lot of chemistry (certainly not the chemistry of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher), but this is probably partly a result of the poor dialogue.
Overall, like Phantom Menace, I felt there were a lot of good ideas in this movie, but that they weren't executed to their full potential.  Attack of the Clones could have been fantastic, but in the end it was the essence of mediocre.  I left feeling like I could have written a better movie.  It's worth a watch, but don't feel like you have to rush to see it.",1021507200,21,1945,4.497159090909091
1324438,5,B00003CXKT,"Last night, after waiting 7 hours in line to get the primo spot in the theater (I was on the news too), I watched the film I had been waiting for ever since Episode I, three years ago.  I set my expectations at a reasonable level, and I expected to be pleased with the movie.
Was I pleased? No: I WAS BLOWN AWAY
I can honestly say that AOTC has managed to surpass all the other movies I have seen in my life to provide the best film experience I've ever had.
Believe me, my expectations were starting to be lowered after reading all the bad reviews.  But after seeing the movie, I can't even understand one damn complaint from the critics in those reviews!
Now I'm going to adress each aspect of the film and my opinion on it:
PLOT: One big complaint amoung the critics was that the movie was very slow in the beginning.  I totally disagree.  The beginning is wonderfully interesting and was done very well.  George really knows how to pace his movies.  He managed to fit plenty of character development in with different action sequences.  The movie becomes extremely haunting once you get to Tatooine (more about the Tusken scene later) and Geonosis, very creepy environments.  Of course, it leads to the huge, full blown Clone War, which basically blows every other film climax away.  There is nothing I would have changed at all in the plot and pacing department.
ROMANCE: I didn't expect much from George in this department (I thought it would be massively cheesily delivered), but I tell you, in certain scenes I felt that the love dialogue reminded me of Shakespear's Romeo and Juliet - it is that good!  There was not one line of cheesy romance dialogue in that movie, it was all very poetic and you felt that the characters are really pouring their hearts out to each other.  It was great!
ACTING: I can't believe that people said Hayden and Natalie's acting was bad.  THEY WERE FANTASTIC!  Their acting was superb through the entire movie and completely believable.  Ewan McGregor is so remenicent of Alec Guiness but manages to show us a new side of Obi-Wan, this guy is such a great actor!  I thought Chris Lee played Dooku well (he's very creepy) and Sam Jackson was great as well.  I thought Daniel Logan (who plays Boba Fett) would be like Jake Lloyd, but surprisingly he was very good at it, and so was Temuara Morrison as Jango Fett.
DIOLOGUE: As I've said, the romance diologue was great, but so was alot of others.  In particular, the words exchanged between Anakin and Obi-Wan are so expertly done, showing that they have a friendship, but they still conflict often with each other in a very strong manner.  Also, the audenince cheered loudly in several places when either Dooku, Mace Windu, Yoda, Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Padme said some great lines in the end battle.
SPECIAL EFFECTS: So many times throughout the movie I thought I was looking at something that was real instead of just CGI creation.  The technology has become fantastic!  The FX are the best in any movie and looked great in nearly all the scenes.  The ONLY shot I'd complain about it a single shot of battle droids on a conveyor belt being moved backwards jerkily, and them a claw whipping forward and putting a head on each.  For some reason, I thought that one shot looked like something out of Toy Story.  But I assure you, that is the only shot that looked fake.  The FX are excellent.
FAVORITE SCENES: I'd have to say that I'd like the scene of Anakin an Padme's first kiss.  It was done very well because the love theme builds up and up as Anakin moves in for the kiss, staring into Padme's eyes and then the lovetheme goes full blown when he give her smooched on the lips.  But then Padme pulls away and goes, ""No!"" and the music stops very quick and Anakin is all taken aback.  Everyone in the theater thought it was great.
Another of my favorite scenes was the part where Anakin goes to find his mother.  I don't want to spoil the scene for you, but I almost cried during it.  It was heart-wrenching to see the entire thing.  And then Hayden gives these fantastic looks of pure rage and hatred.  The scene is extremely powerful and dark and was done perfectly.  You can totally see the formation of Darth Vader taking place.
And then pretty much the entire end battle was great.  Yoda's fight was SOOO cool!  Everyone was completely insane with cheers when you see him beginning to come up behind Dooku from the hallway, they all knew what was coming.  :D  And the Anakin/Obi/Dooku fight was great.  The lighting was very dark during their battle, making it very haunting and forboding.
FINAL WORD: This is the first movie I have ever seen that I don't have one complaint about.  The movie was completely fulfilling, has fantastic character development and relationships, the acting was some of the best I've seen, the scenes were very powerful.  I can't praise Lucas enough for this masterpiece.  It has truely become my favorite movie I've ever scene and has risen aboove The Empire Strikes Back in my book.

1324439,3,B00003CXKT,"I recall that prior to Episode I, Lucasfilm released a brief teaser sheet-- mocking the over-hyped, and then much-talked about GODZILLA-- that read ""Plot Does Matter"".
Somewhere along the line, George Lucas has forgotten this.
Of course, anyone with any objective view of the original trilogy will see that those films didn't always have a glorious, or even above average plot.  However, the stories were kept quite simple, straight-forward-- without playing down to the audience.
Episode Two, however, does.
All in all, this movie was one big foreshadowing of things we already know.
But it had, and possibly HAS the potential to be a spectacular film (we'll wait to see what deleted scenes may add to the story on the DVD).  The first half certainly could have been a thrilling political drama-- but instead, we are treated to boring, often senses-tiring sequences that serve little to no purpose, and are included only to simulate  the political thriller feel.
To me it seems that EPISODE II suffers from the same flaws that plagued FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (although it appears I am the only person alive to have noticed ANYTHING wrong with THAT film!); if anything, this incredibly long and drawn out story would have been better served if it were even longer.
There are portions of the movie that would have almost certainly enhanced  the movie had they been explored further.  The scene in the Jedi archives comes to mind:
According to the EPISODE II GUIDE, there have only been 20 Jedi to ever leave the Order.  Dooku is the most recent.  The jedi keep statues of ""The Lost 20"" in the Archive chambers to remind themselves of these fallen jedi (how biblical!).  In fact, when the librarian first meets Obi-Wan, a bronze bust of Count Dooku himself can be seen directly behind her!
Other parts of the film are simply unnecessary, like the chase through the Droid Factory, or even the albeit exciting chase through Coruscant.
And what could have, SHOULD have been a very important, monumental turning point in the story--the rescue of Shmi Skywalker-- is turned into an anti-climactic footnote.  Again, it seems that much like LOTR, George Lucas is trying to cram far too much into one single story.  Of course no one complains about LOTR because it is adapted from a book...
 The inclusion of the Death Star, Uncle Owen, the Tusken Raiders, heck, even Boba Fett, are included for the sole purpose of connecting this movie to the original three.  I've heard numerous reviews that applaud Boba's scenes, but I have to admit they did nothing for me.  So what if he becomes the bounty hunter we all know and love?  Ooooh, the origin of Boba Fett-- how banal it actually was.
Don't get me wrong, the movie is exciting, thrilling and sometimes, SOMETIMES very enjoyable. But at times, only on a ""coolness"" level.  The last half or so was plenty entertaining, as were intermitant parts of the first.  The scenes on Kamino were especially enjoyable. Not because of the clones, but because of Obi Wan and the Kaminoans.  Again, like LOTR, the first and second halves of the film could have been two separate movies, and perhaps would have been better off if they were.
And the performances? The highlights are Ewan MacGregor and Chris Lee. Unfortunately, the usually great Sam Jackson is only good when NOT acting (ie: fighting).
Hayden Christensen is only slightly better than Jake Lloyd. Nothing against either of them-- certainly Lloyd is just a kid, and kid actors ALWAYS [stink] (I don't care what u say about Sixth Sense).  But Christiansen is simply unorganized and unable to portray such a complex character.  His performance made me wonder how this Amidala character could ever be attracted to him (or at least his personality-- but is Luke's mother that shallow?).  His tantrums, which should have been very disturbing and emotionally draining, made me laugh out loud.  They seemed to come COMPLETELY out of left field, with almost no explanation or motivation.  I was under the impression that Vader/Anakin was a tormented soul, halfway between dark and light. Only a little of that came through.  And when it did, it was not all that interested. A good drama should make the viewer care; Yes, even if we know that he becomes Vader.  After all, everyone knew how Apollo 13 would end, yet it still kept you on the edge of your seat.  If they had tried doing anything even remotely similar, the viewer would have, SHOULD HAVE thought ""no anakin! Don't give in to hate!"" even though you KNOW he eventually does.  So many ""would have/should have's"".
And Natalie Portman, a fine, possibly over-qualified actress has very little to do here. She is convincing as the love interest, but not at all as the military leader/diplomat.  And she is FAR too pretty for this role.
One could argue that EPISODE III just HAS to be good, because now all the little stuff is out of the way, and they can focus on Anakin's turn to the dark side.  But there is still a lot to cover in addition to the debut of the universe's baddest baddy: the decay of the Republic/Rise of the Empire, which surprisingly was only partially touched on here, the emergence of the Rebel Alliance (the only reason for including Jimmy Smits was as a foreshadowing), the birth & hiding of the twins, the slaughter of the Jedi, the Clone Wars (Yoda mentions that this is just the beginning)-- not all of the aforementioned can be covered in the opening scroll of part III!
I sincerely hope that George Lucas actually READS the negative reviews, so he can work harder on the next one.  But I consider my hopes dashed.",1021507200,8,5578,4.769230769230769
1324440,5,B00003CXKT,"Attack of the Clones in my opinion is the best of all four movies in the Star Wars saga.

Many questions are answered that we all had from seeing episode IV, V, and VI.  Attack of the Clones, unlike Phantom Menace, is not bright and cheerful, but a great preview of the dark side and what is to come in Episode III.  Episode II is also more adult oriented unlike Phantom Menace was.  You see Anakin grow ALOT during this one movie and understand what makes him go to the dark side.

The acting is superb, there is great chemistry between Amadala and Anakin which makes the movie more believable, although the love story between them does not interfere with the main idea of the movie. You have to remember that if there was no love story, there would be no A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, or Return Of The Jedi.  The best part of the whole movie is seeing the great warrior Yoda finally kick some tail and show off his supreme jedi skills in an out-and-out battle with one of the main ""dark-side"" characters.

Contrary to the many negative reviews out that have been given about Attack of the Clones, I saw no proof of anything they brought against the movie as being true. There was good acting, memorable quotes, and the computer graphics were necessary to make the story seem real.  Many scenes did not look CG'd when they were because of George's access to great software. It seems to me that so many critics automatically have a grudge against Star Wars simply because they are made by George Lucas, who doesn't care what the media thinks. He doesn't take many suggestions because these are his stories that he's bringing to life for us.  In my opinion that makes his movies better! If you remember, there have never been raving reviews for any of the Star Wars movies, and that didn't stop them from making history. DO NOT let the negative reviews keep you from seeing Attack of the Clones, if you do, you will be missing out on the best movie of the year 2002.",1021507200,,1968,4.444444444444445

Some critics didn't give it the best reviews, but if they had been at the same theatre i was in they would have definately rated it differently.  The crowd was cheering and going crazy at some parts of the movie.  Not to give too much away, but Anakin going crazy after his mother's death showing the dark-side within, and Yoda's opening up a whole barrel of whoop-... on Count Dooku, completely made everyone in the theatre go insane.  The last hour of this movie is just too intense, with a ""Gladiator"" type fighting scene, then an all out war with the Jedi, droids, and an army of clone soldiers, and then followed by Yoda showing why he is the head Jedi.  This movie just has everything, you gotta go out and see this movie, it's just incredible, oh yeah they also kept Jar Jar out of almost all the scenes, who could ask for anything more.",1021507200,,995,4.375
1324531,5,B00003CXKT,"The day: May 15th, 2002.
The time: 5:30 am
My good friend and I, both Star Wars geeks, got into the car, drove to the mall, and waited until the boxoffice opened its holy doors at 10:30 to get tickets to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones.  That night at 11, we entered the theatre for the first midnight showing of the film.  The buzz had been fantastic, the trailers mindblowing, and the last movie horrible, but from the trademark Fox logo to the end credits, our backs were glued to our seatbacks, and the adrenalin was pumping.
Seeing Attack of the Clones that night was my favorite theatre experience ever.  The movie DID NOT dissapoint, but rose to the level (maybe above?) of the original 1970s trilogy.  Here's why.
The movie tells the story of 18-year-old Anakin Skywalker, returning with mentor Obi-Wan to Naboo after 10 years to protect Senator Padme Amidala's life after recent assassination attempts.  After rescuing her from deadly slugs, a chase ensues, that in classic Star Wars fashion, sets the stage for the rest of the movie.  The information ascertained by the Jedi duo 10 minutes in sets events in action that fall into place beautifully, and allows for Anakin and Padme to be alone (and fall in love) while Obi-Wan investigates and finds farely suprising things out.
The first part of the movie does this, it develops relationships and plot, going back and forth between characters and plot.  But after Anakin's nightmare (see the movie), everything gets up to pace.  Anakin then commits a major no-no and disobeys Obi-Wan in a way I won't reveal.  This betrayal sets the scene for one of the most moving and disturbing sequences since Vader saved Luke, and provides real fodder for the gradual damnation of arrogant Anakin.
Via his nosiness, Obi-Wan gets into trouble and requires Anakin to save him.  At this point, about halfway through the movie, the greatest action scenes ever put to film come alive, securing Star Wars as the reigning king of action.
There is more than meets the eye, however...
While the movie is a ""kid's movie"" (George Lucas, PREMIERE, May 2002), there is an underlying political backbone that's probably too complicated for most children to catch onto.  A growing separatist movement, led by (suprise, suprise) the Sith, is present.  And any Star Wars fan is sure to feel rivers of nostalgia and peace as they watch the movie and feel everything begin to fall into place.
In summary, George Lucas has come back to the Light Side.  The characters are developing, the Empire is growing, familiar faces are showing (think Owen Lars), and Yoda shows why he is the Jedi Master.  To boot, the special effects are possibly the best ever made, the sound is riveting, the visuals are crisp, and I actually got pushed back in my chair a few times by the sheer experience.  Anyone who hated Episode I, get ready.  You're going on one [heckuva] ride.",1021507200,4,2898,4.766
1324532,1,B00003CXKT,"I want to say first that I am a fan of the Star Wars movies, specifically the original films, and have seen 'A New Hope' more times than I should have.
I thought this movie was awful for a number of reasons (in the order that they occur to me) :
1 : The dialogue was awful and delivered flatly by actors who are generally very good, but not in this instance.
2: What happened to the John Williams soundtrack?  The scores for the original movies are superb and memorable.  I know and love every note in them.  The music for the prequels was barely noticable and left us cold.
3:  The film was undercut.  Several sequences should have been left on the cutting room floor - particularly the romatic scenes between Anakin and Amadala.  There is a deeply funny moment when Amadala runs up a hill.  It reminded me of 'Sound of Music.'
4: There was no real heavy villain until the very end.  Every mythological tale needs a great villain and this was lacking.
5: An over reliance on creatures and effects.  If you use too much of something, you lose the element of wonder and it becomes really dull to watch.  The creatures should be used more sparingly for greater effect.
6: We are robbed of a potentially great scene as Anakin destroys the Tusken Raiders.  This is a major point for his character development and we were denied it.  Instead we got the romance which would have been nice had it actually worked.
7 : This is a personal thing, but the Tusken dogs were obviously taken from the same program that created the Beast in 'Brotherhood of the Wolf' with minor modifications.  This is nothing new to Lucas, who used some of the Dinosaurs from Jurassic Park in SWSE - namely the Brachiosaurs became 'Rontos.'  We thought that this was unimaginative and cheap of Lucas.
8 : The mythological themes seemed to be completely lacking here unfortunately.  Star Wars without the mythology isn't much good.
9 : The jokes were not funny.
10 : Yoda is a great character.  He is one of the greatest characters in the original trilogy.  But in this he comes across as ridiculous - particularly in the fight scene.  Obi Wan's character seemed once again to be undermined, and still not the Kenobi we know from the classic trilogy.
This had the potential to be a really great story, but Lucas has proved that with a little effort and a lot of CGI, he can make a film that is even worse than Phantom Menace.
Avoid this film.  Watch the original, classic trilogy instead.",1021507200,73,2456,4.490990990990991
1324533,4,B00003CXKT,"Well, now we`re in the fifth (or should I say ""second"") chapter in the Star Wars saga. Yet again, we`re in the middle of a trilogy.
Ten years has passed since the events of ""Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace"". Anakin is now a 19 year old Jedi padawan, and Amidala has left her position as the queen of Naboo to serve the senate. We`re also facing a cooler, less annoying Jar-Jar Binks (but don`t worry. He`s just on screen for 5-10 minutes!). Obi-Wan Kenobi is the same person as always, a worried man with a tough sense of humour. The Republic is still in crisis. Many solar systems is trying to separate from the republic. Under the lead of the mysterious count Dooku (yeah, right , COUNT Dooku, played by legendary horror veteran Christopher Lee), the separatists plan to kill senator Amidala. Anakin and Obi Wan are now sent out by the Jedi council to protect her, and this leads into many fearsome events, especially as Anakin is more and more on his way to the Dark Side.
I think that ""Attack of The Clones"" is a lot better than ""The Phantom Menace"". After having seen the first film I was worried. I was thinking ""Well, it`s Ok to have one bad Star Wars film. But if the second appears to be [bad], I don`t think the prequel trilogy will ever reach up to the standards of the old one""
Fortunatley, Lucas hasn`t written the script himself this time. He`s co-written it with Jonathan Hales (who also wrote the action flick ""The Scorpion King""). This film is more in the spirit of the original trilogy than ""The Phantom Menace"", and it`s full of memorable action sequences and has lots of fun lines, which comes close to ""The Empire Strikes Back"" which is may be the best Star Wars film in my opinion.
This movie is much more matured and serious than ""The Phantom Menace"" - for example, there is much more love and serious drama this time.
This could very well be the darkest and most serious Star Wars movie so far.
Finally, we are also given the answers of questions that has previously been hidden. For example - why don`t the jedi discover the dark lord of the sith is controlling the republic, what did the Storm Troopers came from and how did Anakin`s enormous hate really began?
While the last movie felt more like an adventure film, this one feels more like a typical Star Wars movie.
I also think that the actors are well chosen - the newcomer Hayden Christensen is excellent as the grown-up Anakin Skywalker (while Jake Lloyd [was not]!)In fact, he`s one of the best actors since Harrison Ford to appear in a Star Wars film!
Ewan McGregor is great as the always skeptical and carefull Obi-Wan Kenobi and Christopher Lee is a fun surprise as the new villain ( I think this is funny : he`s playing a real bad guy in both Star Wars II and Lord of the Rings II this year!) and Samuel L. Jackson swings his lightsaber with the same coolness as when he played ""Shaft"".
Something which I have noticed recently is that the Star Wars characters never changes. They always have the same personality. This is making a typical film analysis  of Star Wars impossible!
Anyhow, this isn`t the best Star Wars movie out there. I think that there is simply TOO MUCH action to make it as memorable as the original trilogy.
The 30-minute final battle sequence sometimes seems more like  marketing for action figures than a real movie!
And the sequence where Yoda swings his lightsaber for the first time is fun, but it`s sometimes feels made just for the fans to have someone laughing at. To sum it up : the action sequences are too many and too long!
They should have taken even more feelsome and serious moments and cut away may be 15 minutes or so of the action sequences.
But except for that, I`m actually quite happy with this movie. This movie simply brings us a new hope for the Star Wars saga - Lucas is definitly on the right way, but he`s not really there yet. It feels like a pity you have to wait for another three years to see what the final chapter of the saga is like. I hope Lucas is taking all of his best ideas and use them to give us the greatest film ever made with Episode III!!",1021507200,,4100,4.414795244385733

There is a scene near the end where Anikin and Obe Won and senator (former queen) Amadala are going to be killed, naturally the bad guys fail to simply kill them, instead they set up an elaborate ritual where by the three are chained with there hands above there heads in front of a coliseum crowd, various CGI animals are brought in.  As one approaches the Senator (Natalie Portman) it swipes at here, ripping off just part of her attire exposing her lovely midriff and her right arm and shoulder, I like that creature, it understood what kind of movie it was in, a Saturday mourning adventure, complete with heroes, villains, cute girls in ripped midriff outfits and lots and lots of swordfights, just what we wanted and just what we got.  The CGI and fact that no film was harmed in the making of this picture mattered little, as usual we have far too many CGI characters supposedly interacting with flesh and blood characters, this is doomed from the start, the flesh and blood characters are talking to a blue screen and everyone knows it, but that's the way Mr. Lucas wanted it and that's what he got, so be it.  The only real drawback was the agonizing love story between Anikin and Amadala, the dialogue must be heard to be believed ""I have died a little bit every day since you came back""  AAAARGHHHHH!! I will spare you, gentle reader, from any more quotes, at least Darth Vador wasn't in love he never had to say anything  like that.  All in all a good time at the movies, not a religious experience not something to change the world, just good old fashioned entertainment, I will see the next one.

Just turn on CSPAN and you will get the gist of Clones, it is one meeting after another where everyone uses the word ""politics"" but no one actually discusses anything political.  Everything you've heard about how terrible the script and acting are, is right on.  And the visual effects are only engaging about half of the time, the other half you feel like you are watching a cartoon because everything is so obviously computer generated.  I saw the movie on opening night and everyone in my theater was very upset.  Had George Lucas been present, I am certain we would have stuck a light saber right up his ...

A friend of mine told me the film reel would be flawless because we went to a midnight showing and it was horrible. I thought it was going to melt on the reel. The crowd who attended this midnight showing pretty muched laughed out loud every single time anakin and padme did anything romantic....I felt embarassed for all the people involved with this movie. I was also told ...that we would see lots of Jedi die in this movie.....we see one, and we don't even know or care about the one who does die. this is by far the worst movie on the installment and thats saying a lot with Phantom menace out there to compare it too. Here's hoping (praying) that Lucas gives the reigns of the movie to someone else for the final movie...someone who can actually DIRECT.",1021507200,19,866,4.522292993630574
1324537,4,B00003CXKT,"On a diplomatic mission to Coruscant, Senator Amidala is attacked by an unknown force.  The Jedi council calls for Master Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and his young apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, to solve this mystery and protect the senator respectively.  As Anakin and Padme Amidala fall deeply in love for each other, Obi-Wan discovers the creation of a vast clone army, supposedly ordered upon ten years ago by a Jedi Master thought to have been dead.
The film's greatest strength is the focus on Anakin's emotions, and how he handles his aggression.  It's apparent as the story progresses that he starts to realize something isn't right in his world, and the beginnings of his journey to the Dark Side start to take shape.
I was a huge fan of The Phantom Menace, and needless to say, Episode II made leaps and bounds, having more focus on the story, better writing and a load of surprises.  The only general complaint I have for it is that it is unlike any of the past films to date.  The atmosphere, character relationships, and the psychological feeling in Anakin make this a unique experience, but sometimes go outside the usual restraints of a Star Wars film.  Also, the emphasis is definitely on action, and some of the characters' relationships aren't fully developed.
I waited in line for two hours to get in to the first midnight showing, and while there were a few disappointments along the way, it was ultimately worth the wait.",1021507200,,1433,4.781376518218623

1324539,2,B00003CXKT,"25 years ago George Lucas began a phenomena called Star Wars. The 1977 movie spawned two quick sequels and moved Lucas' ILM(Industrial Light and Magic) into the movie effects forefront. 16 years pass and Lucas takes another stab at the Star Wars mythos with Phantom Menace. Gone are the characters you cheered for in the first films replaced by flat, boring, and nondescript rags of characters. The enthralling plots and endearing characters were gone so Lucas decided to overcompensate by giving us a chunk of eyecandy without the things that truly make a good movie.
  ATOC is a step ahead of the ramshackle film that was PHANTOM but the plot is still sketchy and the actors are worse. The lightheartedness of the first trilogy is replaced with cheesy dialog. Hayden Christiansen is gawd-awful babbeling like Forrest Gump at times. Lucas himself seems to be caught up in making the movie digitally as opposed to true content. ILM has enough clients already George you don't have to put together a 2 and 1/2 hour ad for your company.
The epic storyline/space opera from the original trilogy is gone what remains is an undeveloped endless wave of characters and a mish mosh of tidbits to suck in old school fans. Don't get me wrong I loved the effects in the movie,as always ILM is top notch. The movie is just too slow no REAL action occurs until the last 1/2 hour of the movie.

My biggest disappointment is YODA. ATOC has the dislexic little green man speaking eloquently and jumping around like a extra for a kung-fu scene in the new MATRIX film. UhGGHHHH! Bring back the Yoda puppet!",1021507200,3,1588,4.725631768953068
1324598,5,B00003CXKT,"The familiarity of seeing a Star Wars film in the cinema is a unique experience. The lights dim, the famous logo appears accompanied by that blasting theme tune by the great John Williams, and then the audience knows that they're in for a treat. After the somewhat disappointing Phantom Menace, Episode 2 takes a step towards the dark side and subsequently is much more exciting and enjoyable. George Lucas knows what audiences want, and this one succeeds admirably.
Set about 10 years after the events in TPM, Attack of the Clones is a more action-orientated entry, with incredible battle set pieces. Hayden Christensen is Anakin Skywalker, the troubled Padawan to Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi. McGregor's performance as the great Jedi is much improved, and Christensen's journey from envious apprentice to the echoes of the future Darth Vader is impressive, creating more believable characters. And thankfully, Jar Jar is a much more subdued character than in Menace (phew!).
Boasting a strong supporting cast including Christopher Lee (Count Dooku), Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Cos and Temuera Morrison as Jango Fett, the action, this time around is bolstered by strong presences. And even if Lee is simply reprising his role as the dark Saruman the White from Lord of the Rings, he's a great character, helped with a surprisingly good quality script. In addition, Morrison makes a good impact as the father of Boba Fett.
Moving away from the plodding politics of the first film, events in this one are all about action, with lightsaber fights aplenty. And yes, Yoda DOES have a really awesome lightsaber duel (hear the audience cheer!) Stunning combinations of CGI and live action at once make for some incredible action scenes. The romantic sub-plot involving Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman is sometimes stilted, but the main plot line makes for a truly incredible action-fest.
John William's score is brilliant, echoing his works for Superman, Hook and Jurassic Park. The CG in this film is even better, and the astonishing cities and vistas are fully realised with some incredible FX creations.
Lucas' vision of the many planets and cities are explored extensively, in particular in one scene, where we are greeted with a neon light- drenched metropolis not unlike the Rouge City in Spielberg's A.I Artificial Intelligence. Indeed, many influences have found their way into the film, including an amazing battle arena sequence reminiscent of Gladiator, albeit with lightsabers, echoes of Lord of the Rings and The Matrix-fuelled battle scenes. The action, characters, creatures and FX all combine to create an involving experience that will leave you breathless. Star Wars fans will not be disappointed.
Building up the action quota to a blistering last half hour (I was cheering at the screen at this point accompanied by many friends), the lightsaber battle near the finale is quite simply, the best lightsaber battle EVER. Amazing. Simply amazing. Forget what you thought about Phantom Menace. This one is absolutely astounding.",1021507200,,3056,5.226069246435845
1324599,4,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars was the first movie that I ever saw, needless to say I am a Star Wars fan always have been, probably always will be. I have seen Episode II twice now and I must say it was better the second time around. The first time you see it you have all of these expectations from the past three years and if something does not live up to them then you are disappointed. I must say that there were some aspects of the film that I was disappointed in. The action at times seemed slow and a bit forced, especially during the final big battle. The jedi seem to be moving in slow motion. Also, I feel that they took the character of Anakin a bit far, he acted more like a 15 year old teenager than a 20 year old jedi apprentice. I was also disappointed with the relationship between obi-wan and anakin, the chemistry just was not there I felt like it was the last Batman movie with Batman & Robin basically at each others throats all over again.
The CGI and digital enhancements are what makes this movie great. Going from a puppet Yoda to totally CGI went smoothly. By Episode III they should have it close to perfected. Also the storyline is more mature than anything we have seen in any of the previous films. All in all I would have to give it 4 stars, I feel that with all the anticipation and hype that George Lucas did a good job, not everyone is going to be happy with it because we have all formed our opionions on how it should be, but in the end we just need to sit back and enjoy the ride.",1021507200,7,1495,4.123287671232877
1324600,4,B00003CXKT,"Just watched the Attack of the clones and it is well worth the effort to go and see. The fight scenes have a very nice plausability until you get to the free for all near the end. Anakin is slightly too mad all the time. A little unrealistic for the first half of the film. That said the movie is A+. Very nice duck and weave story telling with a few unexpected suprises. The biggest laugh in the theater was about Yoda. You have to see the movie to understand. Good use of the force skills throughout the film. Too bad Lucas decided the force was green blobs in your blood rather than spiritual. That was the worst let down of Phantom meanace. I went to a theater that claimed it was digital. If it was they should abandon any further attempts at digital presentation. The upper half of the screen was slightly out of focus. In total, nothing will ever beat seeing Star Wars in the theater in 1977 as the total change in movie making and the boldest attempt up until that time for a movie going science fiction experience...but Clones is my best of the series. I would like to see it in the theater again, but will wait for the DVD since no theater near me can do it justice.",1021507200,,1176,4.254464285714286
1324601,4,B00003CXKT,"This movie is FULL of special effeects and action. Th acting is adequate, but Lucas needs to work on his dialogue. I feel like the story is rushed much more than the original movies, and the lack of strong characters like Chewbacka and Han Solo are what's lacking. I am looking forward to seeing how Anakin finally turns, but it seems like it will be difficult to do in only one movie. He still seems so far away from evil in this episode.
See the movie, It's fun. Don't expect Empire Strikes Back and you'll be OK. It's a great SF movie.",1021507200,,538,4.284313725490196
1324602,5,B00003CXKT,"OK - Just got back from the premiere of AOTC in CT on the digital screen.  I am still spinning.  First of all - the clarity of digital is unbeleivable.  There were a few times it looked 3D.  Absolutely astounding and kudos to Lucas for trying to demand that we could all see the movie this way.  If you can get to a digital theater - DO IT!!!  You WILL notice the difference.
OK - so the movie...I read the reviews over the last few days and I read a lot about flat acting, fake digital charactors, and no chemistry between Padme and Anakin.  SO I have to say that, after the many flaws of Phantom Menace, I was prepared to be a little disappointed in this movie - and I doubted that the great George Lucas could still write and direct a STAR WARS quality film.  But tonight I saw a much different movie than what those reviews were describing.  I was chilled, I cried, I sat on the edge of my seat for 2+ hours and left in a whirlwind frenzy from all the excitement.  Anxiously waiting for when I will go see it again tomorrow.
What on earth are those critics talking about?  Did they not see the same movie I did?  The dialogue and interaction between Padme and Anakin was very typical of the way an 18 year old boy might express himself when trying to explain feelings he has never felt before.  Their chemistry warmed me - and Anakin's frequent nudges toward the darkside disturbed me.  His performance was fantastic, as was Natalie Portman's.  The digital charectors were amazing and the fight scenes (yoda in particular) were astounding.  If you see 1 movie this year - SEE THIS MOVIE.

1324604,5,B00003CXKT,"Make no mistake; Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is phenomenal. Like Episode I, it takes a little while to get started, but then things really take off. Believe me, this movie raises the bar for special effects in a way that I had not thought possible. It feels far ahead of its time. And the story is great; don't believe the stuck-up highbrow reviewers. George Lucas has really found the magic again.
Like many people, I feared for the outcome of this movie. I truly doubted if a fully animated Yoda would work at all, if Hayden Christensen was worth anything and if the reputed love story would be too much. But my doubts were literally blown away. Speaking of which, there is an awful lot of blowing away going on. But it never gets repetitive, first of all due to the sheer beauty of every single little detail of it, secondly due to its ingenuity and thirdly due to the occasional comic relief provided by new and old friends alike. The battles are truly epic here, both the large-scale ones and the one-on-one duels. Everything is executed with an immense sense of visual style that never wavers from the true Star Wars, but expands upon it.
Almost every second of the movie you are treated to scenery of truly unbelievable beauty. Even if you care nothing for Star Wars, you ought to see it. I will not hesitate a single second in calling this a masterpiece of modern art. Albeit a very explosive and commercial one at that.
Yes, I'm aware that I'm being laudatory and panegyrical now. But I can't help it. This is praise coming directly from the heart.
The actors do a good job, although this movie will probably not win any Academy Awards for acting. This is not meant in a negative way, though. Hayden Christensen deserves credit for his portrayal of the young and passionate, yet rather troubled Anakin Skywalker. Sam Jackson delivers a convincing Master Windu, and Natalie Portman makes an excellent return as Amidala. Our old friends Frank Oz and Ian McDiarmid are as brilliant as ever in the roles of Yoda (or rather, his voice) and Senator Palpatine. And the list goes on and on. Even Jar Jar Binks is well played by Ahmed Best. But my personal favorite is Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi. His performance is truly stellar (no pun intended), ranging from serious, through sly to humorous. He alone carries much of the movie.
And lastly, the music is just spot on. Well-known themes follow every single shift of mood with uncanny precision, mingling effortlessly with new material. This might just be John Williams' best piece to date.

1324606,4,B00003CXKT,"Okay, I just finished watching Episode II, and I have to tell you that it is no disappointment!  It still isn't up to par with the original trilogy, but it is definitely ALOT better than Episode I.  They did keep Jar Jar Binks, but wrote him off into a smaller role where he's not in direct contact with the main plot (yay!).  I really don't want to give too much away as to ruin the experience of watching the movie yourself.
I really went into watching it with not too high expectations (after Episode I). The best thing about Episode II is that it really captures the feel of the original trilogy. There are some parts of the movie that are real reminiscent of the original trilogy, which is what I really liked, yet there are some scenes are too reminiscent of Episode I (yuck!).
The best part of this movie is that it really connects with the original trilogy. It explains a lot about some of characters we saw in the original trilogy but never knew more about.
And, oh yes, I know you're all waiting for this, Natalie Portman is still hot! There is definitely one scene that you'll definitely love, trust me! Samuel L. Jackson did an excellent job in this movie, his signature glaring eye, he's one BMF! (I heard he had BMF carved in his lightsaber, in reference to Pulp Fiction, as to what he had written on his wallet, ""Bad Mother-..."").  Jango Fett fans, I guess he's alright, I didn't really hear much about him before I watched the movie. But it does explain alot as to Boba Fett.
But the biggest suprise is Yoda... Yoda! I absolutely love Yoda after this movie! He, oh man, I don't wanna give it away, but I never really cared too much for Yoda until now! I have the greatest of respect for Yoda after seeing him in this movie!

""Attack Of The Clones"" makes up for the disappointment of ""Phatom Menace"" and thensome. This movie not only proves that the three year wait was worth it, but that film is dead, because the digital cameras they used to make ""Clones"" appear to be in no way inferior to traditional 35mm. Also, Lucas may be demanding in having this film shown only in Theaters with THX or the equivalent, but it's worth it. This is the best sounding movie I have ever heard at the theater. Whereas it seems like theaters never turn on all the speakers or leave all the good parts out, ""Attack Of The Clones"" takes advantage of every speaker, making you feel every chase scene and every lightsaber duel. It is simply awesome. The only thing to rival how good it sounds is how good it looks. Personally, I welcome the digital age and this film proves that I am not wrong in feeling so.
My personal feelings on ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"": Yoda and Mace Windu steal the show, ""Titanic"" has finally met its superior, and it's going to be a hard three years to wait for ""Episode III.""",1021075200,10,1284,4.376569037656904
1324722,5,B00003CXKT,"If Star Wars: Episode 1 was a disappointment because of cutesy kids, cutesy slapstick, mediocre acting and some poor writing, Episode 2 dispatches that ghost with one swoop of Mace Windu's purple lightsaber.  Attack of the Clones is everything Phantom Menace was not, and emerges not only as an important chapter in the Star Wars saga, but a groovy stand-alone movie as well.  There's a lot to talk about, so let's cut to the chase.
As expected, the plot involves old pal Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGreggor), now a master jedi, and his padawan learner, Anakin Skywalker, AKA The Future Darth Vader (Hayden Christiansen).  The two are dispatched to investigate a series of assassination attempts on Senator Amidala (Natalie Portman), who is attempting to lead an effort to prevent the Galactic Republic to refuse creation of an army to take care of a faction of rebels led by Count Dooku, (the incredible Christopher Lee).  This much we learn from the opening credits.  In the interest of keeping the review relatively spoiler-free, let's talk about what makes Attack of the Clones great.
First of all, lack of cutesy stuff.  Yes, there is some of the usual Star Wars banter and some slapstick, but it manages to serve more as comic relief.  Jar-Jar has a minimal (but ultimately important) role, and his total screen-time is about two minutes.  The CGI isn't distracting, most of the time.  If there is one area where Attack of the Clones could stand to really improve, it's in some of the creatures that look more like cartoons than live-action aliens and...  things.  And when characters are riding various creatures, it REALLY sticks out, but compare it with some of the scenes from Empire and Jedi, and it's quite an improvement.
The acting has improved considerably in Attack of the Clones.  The Patented Lucas Thousand-Yard Stare is still there when McGreggor has nothing to talk to but a blank blue screen, but its presence is minimal (a Phantom Menace perhaps?)  The film is a whopper - almost two and a half hours - but a good deal of that is spent in character development, another area Lucas has been criticized for.  It's not enough to drag the film down, but it is a refreshing change of pace from constant battling.  Because he gives Anakin and Padme ample time to develop, their relationship seems far more real than it could have been - and so does Anakin's decisions.  Hayden Christiansen plays Anakin exactly as he should be: a self-centered, slightly spoiled, emotionally unstable, drunk-on-power punk.  He's a mix between the kid in class who had all the answers, and the jock who always scored the touchdown and dated the head cheerleader.  The audience isn't supposed to like him, although he does have likable traits, but as the movie progresses, they are increasingly gobbled up by his surrender to emotions.
Not to give too much away, but this is really a film that deserves the title Star Wars - the others might rightly be called Star Skirmish, or Star Scuffle, or even Star Minor Exchange of Fists.  The last half-hour of the film is dominated by an enormous battle that can rightly be called a war.  Where Lord of the Rings put an army of twenty-thousand on the screen for a few minutes, Attack of the Clones puts a larger army, with airships, lasers, lightsabers, and all kinds of other stuff for a solid twenty-five minutes.  It culminates in the major Jedi showdown of the movie, where Christopher Lee shows off his stuff and Yoda proves he's the absolute best jedi ever.  This battle makes up for the short, unclimactic scrapping Darth Maul and Qui-Gon got into at the end of Menace.  Most of the time, all you see are the reflections of lightsabers, the grunts of fighting, and strangely illuminated faces, combined with distance shots of the combatants laying into each other.  It's extremely effective, and rates as the coolest Jedi battle to date.
Attack of the Clones is, finally, a worthy successor to the Star Wars title.  Although it does make some of Menace make a little more sense, and it certainly leads up to the classic trilogy, it's a great film on its own and should do very well for itself.  If you are disappointed by this film, get out of your parents basement (or your film-school Ivory Tower) and gain a little perspective.
Little Easter Eggs to watch/listen for: when Anakin first walks into the club, make sure to watch the leftmost TV monitor.  When Obi-Wan is in the diner, listen VERY CAREFULLY to the background music.
And, by all means, enjoy the movie.  It's a cinematic treat, and much more than another feather in Lucas' cap.

Everyone knows the plot by now so I won't go into it,I will say that ""Clones"" is an improvement over the Phantom Menace in the action department,unfortunately it's still plagued by some cardboard acting,amaturish dialogue,and over-used CGI.Lucas claims these movies are for adolescents,but he forgot one thing,Critics and fans alike do not need to be adolescents to be able to see the prequels so far are inferior to the originals.",1019865600,,643,5.0754716981132075

The Anakin with the Princess, was not my idea of a good Star Wars movie.  All the other trailers were spectacular.  There looks to be more Jedi Battles, and it looks to be like there will be a huge full scale war in a desert battle field which looks to have at least 12 light Jedi's fighting together, including Mace Windu.  It seems to have a more mature story with Jar Jar out of it.  Seems to be good, except for the romance.  Which is why I give it a 3.5.  (Yes, 3.5)  I wished it was more along the lines of Anakins mother dieing, which would lead him to the Dark Side.  Plus, I haven't even seen Anakin's mother in any of the previews.

The follow up, to the Classic Phantom Menace sees our familiar
heroes thrown together again,10 years after the climatic events
of Phantom,(22 years before Battle of Yavin).Padme Amidala,whos now a senator in the Republic, finds herself the victim of potential death threats from political factions anxious to kill her...enter Jedi Knights (bearded)Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, who are sent on an errand to protect her, but its not that simple for Anakin, as he starts to deal with his more instense emotions of (forbidden) love, fear and frustration
which will eventually lead to the downfall of Anakin Skywalker.
In the backdrop of this, we have a mego-lo-maniac Palpatine, whos
unethical methods have seen change since seizing power,after Valorums exit. The recruitment of a one Count Dooku or Sith Lord
Darth Tyranus as a likely replacement for Darth Maul looks exceedingly mouthwatering as we once again see Jedis fighting Sith Lords.
With new planets and new characters, and the subtle blend of Star
Wars magic..this promises to fill that dark void between chapters 1 to 4, bringing more clarity and understanding with, why things are the way we see them in A New Hope and concluding.
Watch-out for Anakins blue AND green lightsabers
Watch-out for Maces Purple lightsaber
Watch-out for The chancellors guards..familiar arnt they!!
Watch-out for The New Clone Troopers..very similar to the old stormtrooper, different headgear.
Watch-out for new planets like Geonosis,Green Plains of Alderaan, and the mystical rainy planet!!watch
Watch-out for Jango,Boba fett,Slave 1 and the Mandalorians, they
play a crucial role in the clone wars.
Watch-out for Zam Wessel, this bounty hunter looks good, for
a chic.
Watch-out for 3PO..abit more familiar ay
Watch-out for Anakins temper, taste of things to come..and the final duel that will ensue between him and Obi wan(100%guaranteed)in Episode 3..in which the molten pit plays a crucial
part to the formation of Darth Vader, but not before hes done away with Mace.
Watch in 2005 when (specualting)Rise of the Empire or Dark Tide Chapter 3 goes Bigscreen, now George lucas said himself Chapter 2 is a dark film, but 3 even darker, and quoted that 3 will only
do half as well at the box office..nonsense..us avid fans love

The trailer for AOTC looks visually stunning, even more so than TPM and the action sequences look like they will be even better, however Hayden looked a bit wooden to me.  Lucas was meant to be co-writing this one, so assuming this is true and they have put together a decent script and Lucas has learnt how to direct actors (note: I did not say films) then we could be looking at a very good Film in May...

AOTC will be right up there with ESB, maybe even exceeding it.  I've read the scriptment, and it sounds like the movie is going to be an outstanding addition to the series.  The story is engaging, and the character arks of Obi-wan and Anakin are probably the most visible, profound, and interesting in cinema history.  People have had time to overcome the 're-introduction shock' that caused massive grumblings over TPM.  Now, audiences have re-adjusted to accept new Star Wars story, and will be able to simply enjoy the continuation of the saga.

this is the prequel to what happens in A new hope through Return of the Jedi.  If we are to compare episode 2 to Empire Strikes Back, they both have a love story.  Didn't Han and Lea start expressing their feelings for one another?
I think that Episode 2 is based as a love story, but so much will
go on that will pull Anakin Skywalker to the dark side and he will become Darth Vader.  What moment will bring this about?

After all the buzz going around I thought that a good number of people had lost intesrest, but as the realese inches closer I'm becoming aware that too many people still care about this movie. Now before you brand me a star wars basher, let me tell you it was quite the oppposite. I am 24. I grew up on these movies, when I went to bed at night as a kid I ahd to choose which sheets i wanted to put on my bed. I loved star wars. I still do love the origianls. And let me the stress ORIGIANLS!!!

  Even after the tragic re-releases, I was still all ready for episode I. It was the even I had waited for my whole life, so going through the hoopla to get tickets and going to see it in the middle of the night would be well worth it. That is until I saw the movie. Until I the day I die, I seriously doubt I will ever be more dissapointed in my entire life. Episode I is such a travesty to the triolgy. I can't for the life of me understand how people can still care, when it is blatantly evident in how lucas treats his work, that he has absolutly no respect for what he ahs created. Another thing I can't understand is, especially after seeing the trailer, I can't understand for the life of me how anyone thinks this looks good! Its not even shot on film for god's sake. Its all shot in front of a green screen, so they didn't have to use sets. Its look horrible, and the more interviews i read and see with Lucas it confirms every feeling i have, that he simple no longer cares about his created world, and only cares about himself. I realize most of you will brush this off as brand me as a hater... but I assure you... I wasn't until the creator betrayed his creation. have fun waiting in line for three weeks. mark my words.. it won't be worth it.",1011916800,26,2072,4.11358024691358

The trailor (coming attractions) that I saw before Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter looked like a romantic love story or a date movie.  Kind of disappointing to a die hard fan like myself.  I realize that they have to attract the kind of crowd who may have no interest in sci-fi, fantasy, or the Star Wars saga so I guess I could forgive Lucasfilm.

It looks darker, more serious in tone, perhaps more akin to 'The Empire Strikes Back', which was easily the best of the classic trilogy.

The Phantom Meanace was the best film of the twentieth century!
Attack Of The Clones will be the best film of the twentyfirst century, (until Episode III and VII, VIII, VIIII that is)!
AOTC is much darker than TPM with many more lightsaber battles and Anakin moving towards the darkside of theforce. George Lucas again shows his genius by making the sweert and good child all true Star Wars fans loved in Episode I turn into Darth Vader. Lucas's great direction shows how Christensen turns into this tragical monster in Episode II. Christensen may give the best performance of his career here. Likewise Portman and McGregor, who look even better than in TPM (a hard feat to pull off but Lucas manages it! Well done!) and Samual L Jackson was born to play Mace Windu. Here Lucas directs Samual in his best role yet, with more fighting. People should have more faith in George Lucas, especially his fans who should know better anyway than to listen to critics, after all he is the creator of Star Wars and as fans we should appreciate and like what he creates for us. A true fan will be pleased with anything Lucas is pleased with, and Lucas is a perfectionist. Just look at TPM, it pushed the limits of technology to get the effect Lucas wanted, and I know that AOTC is no different. The specatcle will be even greater!
The trailer to AOTC is also excellent, its worth going to the cinema just to see that! You'll see highlights from the awesome film.
George Lucas has created another masterpiece here which of course people who don't get star wasrs will want to slam. But this time they won't be able to. Nobody's going to want to listent o squealing critics when they vcan go and see this awesome film with great performances, a killer cast, an epic and great story and is the best cinemantic experience since film was invented. Look forward to another perfect movie from the master himself! I can't wait for Episode III, which will be the best film of 2003 and will have the same great, classic performances, script, plot, effects and action that we've all come to expect and love from George Lucas!! It's going to be the best film you can imagine and a perfect addition to the Star Wars saga. CLASSIC STAR WARS! MATFBWY! (May the force be with you!)
And all the fans saying AOTC has an ""funny title"" or will be ""better"" than TPM had better listen up, since they seem to think that TPM was imperfect in some way and that Lucas was just working out problems so AOTC could be the greatest film.

1324845,3,B00003CXKT,"Before I purge ahead I have to state that I have always been a hardcore Star Wars fan (old school style). I was lucky enough to have seen Star Wars ""A New Hope"" opening day in May 1977 in the movie theaters before it was ""The New Hope"". And since then it's opened up the way I've looked at movies, art and storytelling. Since then I've followed the Star Wars saga. Then "" The Phantom Menace"" came out last year to a lot of HYPE!! The giddiness and fervor brought everyone's expectations beyond reasonable acceptance of TPM. And unfortunately TPM was even worst than reasonable expectations of a good movie. As part of the ""old school"" Star Wars legion I was annoyed. Lucas' shallow attempt at gimmickry with Jar-Jar Binks, the stinted and staccato dialogue, and inundation of ""background"" storylines over a smooth linnear plotline threw what respect I had for the TPM in the trash bin with my discarded popcorn box.
I'm still a great Star Wars fan. But George Lucas has got to get back to roots; to what made ""American Graffiti"" and ""Star Wars"" great movies to watch. There was texture, great dialogue, and a sense of that ""documentary"" reality that was evident in both movies just mentioned. He's got to get back to storylines and character empathy over slick marketing computer graphics easily transferred to toys and marketing items. He's got to care about telling a story rather than selling a story. So beware the HYPE. I'm going to watch ATC. And I will suspend my cynicism to enjoy the movie.

The movie seems like a very mature movie compared to 'The Phantom Menace' and defintely a lot darker, I love it already!  'The Phantom Menace' was fantastic, it brought us deeper into the Star Wars world and helped us to feel more involved and knowledgable about the series.  The only problem is, there's only one more left after this (I hope I'm wrong!).  Star Wars is just such an amazing thing, it means so much to so many people around the world.
The name is a little strange, but that doesn't mean that the movie won't be good!  Have a little faith in George Lucas people!  By the way, I am so glad that he chose to direct this series instead of letting someone else take over after the first movie, which is what he did with the original Star Wars series.
Hayden Christensen is a major attraction to the movie.  He is the sexy young actor who is set to play Anakin Skywalker!!!  I just cannot wait to see him in this movie.  He is a very gifted actor and brings a lot of emotion and intensity to the screen.  It was very smart of George Lucas to chose him (a practically unknown actor) over the other stars trying for the role (Leo DiCaprio, etc).

1324905,5,B00003CXKT,"I have been an avid Star Wars fan all my life. I remember having an unquechable desire to know if Vadar was really Lukes father or was it just a ploy to seduce him to the dark side of the force. The battle on Hoth even now in my opinion was one of the best orchastrated and climatic battles filmed. You relly didn't know for certain whether or not they would escape, especially after one of the leading characters almost died in the very beginning. That left an impression on me that anything could happen. I remember being on the edge of my seat the whole time the Falcon was running from the empire.
In return of the Jedi it was cool to see Mark Hammle in his finest role yet ""a Jedi"" not yet of course he still had one obstical to face. The passion in that movie was indeed beyond any lucritive word I could come up with, and the duel between Darth and Skywalker brought me to the brink of awe. For that matter their first exchange on Cloud City was in my estimation incredible, the drama, the excitement of that fight, the acting(almost as real as it gets)DOPE!!!
Star Wars seduced you. Empire gripped you. Jedi simply said "" you and your father are now...Mine!  So were hooked there is no escape.

1324906,5,B00003CXKT,"Star Wars is one of the greatest sagas ever to be made.  The age old tale of Good vs Evil is retold with such care for detail as has never been seen.  The original Star Wars had everything: drama, action, betrayal, romance, fight scenes, suspense, and surprise.  The movies were sucesses despite their newness.  ESB was loved, even though it is recognizably the darker film.  So what is different?
  Why did people dislike The Phantom Menace so much? Perhaps because there were so many expectations for this new film.  Frankly, any film with all the hype that TPM recieved would likely be called a disapointment.  Look at the new Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings.  Those surely will dissapoint many hardcore fans, whether or not the movies are good.
  So why are people judging Attack of the Clones so harshly?  It's not even released yet.  I admit, the title is somewhat lacking in drama, but it could hardly be called anything else.  The plot promises to be darker, giving us the why for Anakin's turning, as well as his romance with Padme Amidala.  I rate this movie 5 stars because I cannot expect anythng less from s Star Wars movie.  Any true Star Wars fan would love anything Star Wars, despite what the critics say.

1324907,5,B00003CXKT,"Obviously, I cannot truly rate how many stars I give this movie since
it hasn't come out yet.  However, I've read many spoilers all over the
internet that come from very reliable sources, and so far they've
proven to be very interesting and exciting.  I'm not going to reveal
anything I've heard here...
Bascially, I
think that Episode II will have much more of what a lot of fans were
expecting from The Phantom Menace.  Those expectations were wrong in
my opinion, given that TPM was the beginning chapter of the overall
story.  And we all know that as the story progresses it gets darker
and darker, eventually leading to the darkest chapter of them all -
Episode III.  So it only proves as logical that TPM would be made as
light in tone as possible to create good contrast with the next two
episodes, therefore putting the entire six chapter saga into a
watchable series altogther.  If all of the movies were dark, that
wouldn't be good.  Episode I was meant to show us when it was
""before the dark times, before the Empire."" There was once a
more peaceful and light time in the Star Wars universe, and here it is
right in front of us(although, if you caught it, at the end of the
movie was the beginning of the end of the Old Repubilc; the bad guy
wins and no one knows it).
So to expect a dark movie out of the
first chapter of the Star Wars saga is like expecting chocolate inside
a nice piece of T-Bone steak.  Odds are it ain't gonna happen.  And
also to expect it to feel like Episodes IV-VI is the same way.  The
characters are going to be different, the locations are going to be
different, heck most everything will be different!  We have to get
used to the fact that Star Wars isn't just the same old characters and
stories from the old trilogy anymore.  It goes way beyond that, and we
should be excited about that instead of wallowing about how WE want
the SW universe to be.
Anthony Daniels has said that AOTC was his
favorite SW movie that he's been in.  It has been compared to The
Empire Strikes Back, which is hailed by many to be the best SW film in
the entire saga so far.  Lucas hired a co-writer to help polish the
script.  Hayden Christensen has been raved about as being perfect to
portray Anakin/Vader.  We know that the plot has to go deeper and get
closer to what we're familiar with in the Star Wars universe.  And
finally, we'll get to see what Ben Kenobi was talking about when he
mentioned the Clone Wars in A New Hope!
Like I said, all of the
spoilers I've read make AOTC out to be a really good film in the SW
saga, and I can't wait to see it.  I rate everything I know about
Episode II so far five stars.",1003017600,8,2642,4.260521042084168
1324908,4,B00003CXKT,"This movie will rock, definetely. I'm only worrying about two things: The acting (Natalie Portman so far is a bit wooden..the plot of this next one should be a bit more flexible for her to actually act this time), and Hayden Christiansen, whom of which we haven't seen anything yet, acting wise. I won't say much about this next movie; ... What I will say is that at least one new location in AOTC is gonna be one that incorporates the final environental element into the mix; rain..and plenty of it. We'll see the origin of many staple SW components & people, and actually, yeah, we'll go to some specific locations from ANH!
I have faith that Lucas will deliver a better film than TPM because he knows how that one was recieved...and besides bieng a storyteller, he speaks fluent in the dollar language...so...what we want, we'll see.
The main lame thing that Lucas is responsible for is making only six films. These prequels should've been more stretched out in terms of plot and character developments.
He's rushing, far too quickly.
There's one last thing about AOTC that I don't understand...and it has to do with something blue that should have changed colors due to Lucas's own iconography, but seems like it won't. I always liked Lucas' icon use and fluid use of repition, but he seems not to wanna do that here for some reason. It's somewhat annoying.",1002672000,,1361,4.698744769874477

""How does this CHAPTER fit in the context of the entire Star Wars
saga?"" From what I know about the movie (bits & pieces), it's
a pivotal chapter in why Anakin becomes Darth Vader, not
""how"".  That will be covered in Episode III.  As Lucas has
stated on many occasions, ""When we see Return of the Jedi, we are
witnessing the father's (Anakin's) vindication through Luke, his son,
without really understanding what is being vindicated.  That is what
the prequels are about."" As far as the context of the whole Star
Wars saga goes,I believe that this chapter will fit like a glove.  The
Phantom Menace, Episode I, was merely an introduction of sorts and
shouldn't be used in prejudging any of the other two prequel
installments.  As far as the title goes, ""Attack of the
Clones"", it should be viewed as a chapter heading in the saga.
It's liken to the Lord of the Rings trilogy; one of the movies is
called, ""The Twin Towers"".  If that were the only movie in
the series, it might be seen as a lame title, but it's not.  It's
merely a chapter heading and ""
Attack of the Clones""
should be seen in the same light.  Whether you like the Phantom Menace

Padme is no longer a queen and yet everyone still calls her milady for some reason, and she hasn't aged at all she looks the same as she did from the last movie. The Republic has encountered a bit of a problem, a separatist organization has been created and now the Republic is almost on the verge of war. And the separatists have tried to assassinate Padme, so she has to be guarded by Obi-Wan and Anakin, whose relationship has certainly changed in the past ten years. They are good friends but they still have the master-apprentice relationship, which cause friction as Anakin is acting very self absorbed and feels like his master is holding him back. So they figure out a bounty hunter was sent to kill Padme so they have to split up, Obi-Wan starts his search for the mysterious bounty hunter, and Anakin has to protect Padme and return her to her home planet of Naboo. Soon Obi-Wan discovers who the bounty hunter is and travels to the world of Kamino where he also discovers that a clone army has been produced for the Republic from the DNA of the bounty hunter Jango Fett the father of Boba Fett. Meanwhile on Naboo a romance starts to blossom between Anakin and Padme and really I could care less. I know it's important to the characters and the story but really it's just tedious and boring. It reminds me of Bella and Edward's romance in Twilight, and that makes me sick to my stomach, but we will get to the Twilight movies in good time! So anyway, Obi-Wan tracks Jango to the planet of Geonosis and gets captured and has a brief chat with Count Dooku played masterfully by Christopher Lee who is the saving grace of this movie! Seriously, what is with these prequel movies and the only thing I truly love about them is the secondary Sith Lord? Speaking of Sith Lords, Count Dooku reveals to Obi-Wan that the senate of the Republic is under control of a Sith Lord by the name of Darth Sidious. Yes, yes, politicians are evil. Ha ha! Moving on...Anakin has horrible visions of his mother dying so he goes to Tatooine to try and find her, but finds it's too late and she dies in his arms. They soon receive a pre-recorded message form Obi-Wan telling them of the planet Geonosis, so they travel there to save him only to be captured themselves. Meanwhile in the senate, emergency powers are given to Chancellor Palpatine to use the clone army to fight the separatists. So they quickly rush over to Geonosis to capture their leaders and save our heroes. The battle is successful but Dooku gets away so our Jedi knights track him down and fight him. The fights in this movie are really good! Even though the duel with Dooku is short, it's still very good primarily for one reason, we get to see Yoda pull out his lightsaber and fight! Are you kidding me? And he's like lightning quick, he's doing all these flips and tricks, it's unbelievable! I'd say watch the movie just for that! But the fight doesn't go good for our heroes, Anakin gets his right arm cut off, him and Obi-Wan are nearly crushed by a pillar which Yoda stops but gives enough time for Dooku to escape the planet. So Anakin gets a robot arm and even secretly marries Padme even though they've known each other for a couple of days, maybe a week at best. Seriously, they meet up after ten years, travel to Naboo, hang out and build their horribly written romance for a few days, go to Tatooine and bury Anakin's mother and then go to Geonosis to help Obi-Wan and then they are sooo deeply in love they get married. Blah, blah blah, yadda, yadda, yadda. Just wake me up when we see Yoda fight.",1526256000,,3785,4.48695652173913
