Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer would not release this movie made in 1934, and which received 1934 Film Editing Oscar, the first ever awarded.  Some of what you will see in this film will never be able to be filmed again, such as some of the hunting scenes, on land and in the Ocean.

Especially considering the Yupiks shoved real plugs down the blow hole of the whales to suffocate them.  I was on edge feeling the raw hatred of misunderstandings. It was tense. I would highly recommend it. 5 Star
