There is no plot (at least not one that I could follow), no attempt at any kind of special effects or gore, no real actors (I sincerely hope they're not real actors), and nothing scary whatsoever. I ended up falling asleep at some point, and then fast-forwarded through the end thinking that maybe you just had to wait for a spectacular ending like in Audition, but no; the movie kept going and going, the characters hanging out and talking in some warehouse until it finally ended.
I want my two hours back!!!",1237852800,2,786,4.246666666666667

The special effects, lets just say left a lot to be desired.  I think they should take their cam corder and go back to the drawing board again.",1176681600,3,292,4.160714285714286

Starring: Denice Duff, Andrew Divoff, Karen Black and John Kassir.

""So, You think you're ANGRY now !,Wait till THE DOCTOR sees YOU !""We wish they had used one of the original titles, Dr. Rage or The Last Patient, The public would have loved this `Reanimator-esque' Mad Doctor romp. Denice Duff is gorgeous and has some wonderful scenes. Andrew Divoff seems over the top, Until you are privy to whole plot. Karen Black as a lawyer, No really ! John Kassir is a rubber face henchman, Brings new meaning to the word ""Lackey"". Theasylum has a good scare here and seems to let it breath with gusto. The beginning and the middle set up a fantastic finale with multiple gore effects.",1162771200,4,691,4.655737704918033
