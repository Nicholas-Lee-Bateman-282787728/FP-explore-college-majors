4713123,5,B005JTE6CK,I have had the privilege of seeing this early. Pastor Mike Bogart takes a very honest and historical approach to understanding Islam. He shares how Islam began and the claims that Islam makes concerning its history and its doctrines. This is not political or divisive. This is a truly fair and balanced approach to Muslim beliefs and faith. I thoroughly recommend all people (regardless of faith) watch this brief DVD to be introduced to Islam and understand it in an unbiased manner.,1315353600,5,484,4.914634146341464
4713124,5,B005JTE6CK,"For well over the last decade, Western society has viewed Islam through the lenses of secular media and special interest groups which often have a predisposition on the subject.  MindCuisine stands apart from these so-called ""tour guides"" presenting a clear impartial perspective in a professional and simple format in its ""UNDERSTANDING ISLAM"".  While I have read a thorough unbiased text on this subject, this audio-visual format stimulated deeper engagement to grasp underlying truths. Some advantages to this type of tutorial are: 1)topic scene selection; 2)visuals which enhance understanding; 3)use for quick review; 4)compatible and portable; and 5)large group presentation.  Well done, MindCuisine!",1315353600,2,706,5.901960784313726
4713125,5,B005JTE6CK,"Professor Bogart really teaches the facts in easily understood English.  I very much enjoyed this work, and look forward to others like the Mormon religion.  This is a must if you want an unbiased look at Islam.  You can use this as a basis to form your own opinion as to how this religion interacts with Western society.",1315180800,10,321,4.5
4713126,5,B005JTE6CK,"Mr. Bogart has done an excellent job at holding together both truth and kindness.  Because he is a Christian pastor, we might expect him to be unfair in his portrayal of Islam.  But in my opinion he is extremely unbiased in his presentation of the facts of Islam.  From its ancient history to its current practice, Islam is described with clarity and without vilification.  Perhaps the fact that Mr. Bogart is also a professor of world religions has helped him.",1315180800,8,461,4.725
4713127,5,B005JTE6CK,With all the misunderstanding that accompanies the subject of Islam these days it is good to get someone with a balanced approached delving into the subject.  Ignorance and prejudice are never going to get us into a position to deal with the issues of the culture clash between Muslims and the West. I have read materials that overly demonize Islam and others that are simply extended efforts to whitewash any and issues that do need to be confronted.  I believe that this effort from Mike Bogart is a positive step in having an adult conversation on the subject.,1315180800,6,563,4.73469387755102
4713128,1,B005JTE6CK,"""Almost"" all of these reviews are phony or a friend/relative of Bogart's.  The first four appear legit, however, everyone else finished the DVD in the month of September, 2011, has written only 1 review - this one and were extremely impressed that it was fair and balanced.

I have been looking for a DVD that ACCURATELY gives the history of the Crusades.  I'm starting to believe there is no such accounting. I've learned from my search that any review I am interested in, I check out the ""other reviews"" that Customer had written.  What I believe I have found here is a phony story with phony reviews.",1364601600,10,603,4.607476635514018

I learned a great deal from this short video. If you are a student or just interested person, and you want a straight forward, unbiased synapses of what Islam is about, from the roots of the faith to the more current understand and practice of the religion, this is a great video to watch. If you are an instructor, this is a video I think that is worth purchasing and showing to your students.",1355097600,,529,4.353535353535354

4713136,3,B005JTE6CK,"This DVD is for those beginning a study of Islam. Our class found ""Islam Empire of Faith"" much more helpful for our review and for gaining further insight into the historical and cultural aspects of the faith.",1354665600,2,209,4.675675675675675
4713137,5,B005JTE6CK,I really loved this video. It really helps understand the origin of islam in comparison to the other religions. It also briefly and consciously touches base about the pillars of islam.,1349654400,,184,4.967741935483871
4713138,5,B005JTE6CK,"I think this DVD was outstanding. This was a thought-provoking presentation by Professor M. Bogart, which delivered equitable, factual and valuable information about Islam. This high-quality video provided a swift synopsis on the subject of Islam in an entertaining manner, which mad it easy to understand. I struggled to find free video presentations on the Internet that provided the straightforward basics about Islam and failed miserably. This presentation not only met my goals it exceeded all my expectations because it delivered the information with a clear, impartial and thorough methodology. I highly recommend this presentation to students, employers and to anyone that wants to learn the truth about Islam.",1335225600,,718,5.5963302752293576
4713139,4,B005JTE6CK,"From a Muslim point of view, I think the movie was very informative with very good information on the subject of understanding Islam.  I think that if the believer of other faiths were exposed to the information produced in the film it would change their view of Islam in a more positive light. So often today Islam is portrayed in a negative light, especially by the media, that many have formed opinions that are baseless.
  One of the strong points of this video was its ability to separate the fundamentalist or extreme view versus the orthodox or current views of the religion. I think that if this movie was shared with the public, it would offset much confusion as to the beliefs of Muslims. This film should also be incorporated into the classroom setting for students trying to learn more about the religion.
  If I could make a suggestion on how to improve this film, I would suggest more information on Abraham's other son Ishmael. The Christians of the bible would be able to relate to the history of the Muslims if they could identify with something that was familiar to them. In the book of Genesis, it details Ishmael and the blessings that he received from Allah. Although many bible scholars believe that the covenant was only for Issac, the bible clearly gives indication that Ishmael would receive blessings as well.  The circumcision was one of the covenants that tied the children of Abraham together. When Abram became Abraham at the age of 99, everyone in his household was circumcised including Ishmael. When Ishmael and his mother left Abraham's home, they eventually settled in the desert of Paran. Scholars all agree that the Desert of Paran is what is now known as modern Saudi Arabia. It should be noted that Muhammad (PBUH) is recognized as a descendant of Ishmael.  If I had to make an emphasis or correction as to the understanding of Islam, this would be the only thing required to ensure that a full understanding is required even if it is controversial in some eyes.",1332115200,5,2001,4.732758620689655
4713140,5,B005JTE6CK,This is an excellent video and I highly recommend it.  Michael Bogart does a super job in his general analysis of the Islam faith.  I'll be sharing it with all those I come in contact with who would like to know more on the subject.,1324771200,2,232,4.133333333333334
4713141,5,B005JTE6CK,This video was very instructive and detailed. I recommended it for everyone who wants to learn about the essence of Islam . This video teaches all you need to know about Islam in just 35 mins. Excellent Job Professor Michael Bogard.,1324684800,2,232,4.682926829268292
4713142,5,B005JTE6CK,"This video is excellent for someone who is interested in acquiring a basic knowledge of Islam or as a foundation before diving in to books that can sometimes be complicated in nature.

Michael's approach to informing the viewer was unbiased, respectful, and never boring.  I have checked out the Mind Cuisine website and have learned about other religions, as well.

I think the founding of Islam is especially interesting. Muhammad sounds like an interesting prophet who had some revolutionary ideas. I think this video is an excellent introduction to Islam for anyone who has little or no knowledge about Islam. I also agree that we should not judge other people because they have a different belief system. Instead of judging take the time to learn about their belief system.",1316822400,,585,4.801980198019802

4713161,5,B005JTE6CK,This movie gave me great insight about the Islam and their religion. Other movies tend to dramatize religion and don't have clear details about what the religion is about. But Michael Bogart took the time to really break down every aspect of the religion of Islam and explain it thoroughly.
