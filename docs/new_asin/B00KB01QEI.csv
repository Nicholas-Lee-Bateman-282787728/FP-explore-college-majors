6412200,3,B00KB01QEI,"This season was written like any other last season, fast and loose. They really counted on the previous seasons and the actors to carry it. Except for Becka's character. They wrote her whining little ass out of all but the end. The only reason to watch this season is because you've already seen 1-6. Otherwise it's a real waste of time.",1474156800,2,337,4.540983606557377

6412208,1,B00KB01QEI,"The reason why a lot of people watch this show is the same reason for reading a really depressing post-apocalyptic book series: once it's started, it had to be finished.  However, this season is an extreme drag.  Many people just want to see what happens with the main male and female leads: instead, the whole thing with the new kid is a ridiculous, numbing distraction.  Oh, that kid...that FREAKIN' ANNOYING kid...The characters, at this point, are not interesting.  The entire show is filled with extremely annoying moments (such as bad parenting and spoiled childen who need to be placed in a cellar to keep their whining to themselves) that reflect the notion that all the characters (including the city) are depraved, listless, irresponsible people, but the last season highlights this most brightly.  Moody conveys a most telling line in this season: ""How can I be in the doghouse with a woman I'm not even f-ing dating, and why do I even care?""  Indeed - why should anyone watching this show care?  This is a perfect line of reasoning for people who watch this train derail very, very slowly in its last moments.  That is a good way to describe the whole show actually: a train losing contact with the rail, from beginning (in the distance) to end (close up), all in slow motion.

And it's so damn depressing.  Oh, soooooo depressing.",1470787200,,1343,4.774891774891775

So many episodes were lame, especially with a son showing up that Hank did not know about.  He looked nothing like is Dad (or his beautiful mother)  It was hard to watch the kid muddle through the episodes.  And then we have Marcie and Ruggles.  Talk about gross.

6412334,4,B00KB01QEI,"On what basis can you judge the Californication series? After all, it's not like you are watching the show expecting The Wire or even Community. Californication is basically Sex & the City for writers (just like Entourage is Sex & the City for bros and Girls is Sex & the City for women under 35) where charmingly amoral people get to act like children without responsibilities and a ton of easily accessed sex and narcotics that never quite leave a lasting impact (unless it's time to write a very minor character off the show). The viewer can live vicariously through Hank Moody and his even whackier friends as long as they know that its a wish-fulfillment fantasy. So judging Californication for being trite, superficial and celebrating smug jerks is missing the point. Besides, David Duchovny is a decent actor who can make Hank Moody - a man who would be utterly reprehensible in real life - rather charming.

I wanted to give this season a 3-star review since there were several aspects that felt forced and trite, but then I remember that I rather like the show's weaknesses and I have to judge the show based on Californication standards and somehow the series never fails to entertain me. And without the ""final season"" designation, there is really no way to see this season as that much different than the rest. It again ends with a hopeful sign that he might get back with Karen but he will mess up. The reconciliation scene even has a cranky lady changing her seat on an airplane and yelling at them so we just know not to expect sentimentality no matter how much Elton John is playing.

Yet there are some definite flaws this season. While there are flaws in every season (mangina, anyone?), this season seems to be saddled with the notion that Cousin Oliver was cool so Hank gets a long lost son in Levan who is not a character so much as a series of shouts and ticks that are supposed to be funny but fall flat. Michael Imperioli and Heather Graham come in for their supporting roles and they are both funny. Mary Lynn Rajskub is wasted in a thankless role as a crazy writer who wants better representation and the tv show within the tv show is terrible.

The main weakness hits around episode 9 when Karen gets in a car accident and Hank rushes to the hospital. She's fine (of course) but now she is bringing in the rank sentimentality. Natasha McElhone can be the series MVP for spending seven seasons playing a woman who is shocked and disgusted with Hank's shenanigans even though there should be a point where she just expects them. While Karen is supposed to be the anchor that keeps Hank sane, often Becca performed that role while Karen was the killjoy who wandered into the show from the real world to remind the audience that people are not expected to behave this way (which just ruins the fantasy - see also Skylar from Breaking Bad who really should have been the only likeable character on that show).

So what happens is that we are stuck with a third of the season devoted to Karen and Hank talking about their relationship while sad music plays in the background. This material is expected in Californication but it shouldn't be too dominant.",1443744000,,3175,4.604240282685512

It was tough to sit through. They should have tried to end the show at around season five.

It really lost its charm at Season Five when they brought in annoyingly ""bada$$"" Samurai Apocalypse (RZA) and then Season Six with Atticus Fetch, the rock star. Season Seven was just another ""what are we gonna do now to continue moving this dying show forward"" kind of feel.

David Duchovny is brilliant and once again shows that he has what it takes to be listed as one of the legendary writers, directors, producers and actors of our generation. I'm very sad that after 7 seasons its now over. The introduction of a son in the very last season was premature to the ending but very enjoyable way to refresh the story and spawn a new direction of storylines. If we as the viewer had another season to see Becca with her brother Levon, or find out what's next for Hank Moody on his path to being a father and a husband, I think it would have been best to end the series with Hank finally Marrying Karen. Becca getting married was great but it was seen to me as a rush to get the happy ending.

This season added a charter that I haven't been too keen about. I think it was an attempt to add a different kind of humor, but I've only seen it as a bit too much. This character adds a different element and feel, but I don't think it was for the better. I've not completed the season, so I hope he goes away one way or another.
The 'regulars' all continue to be as awesome as all the other seasons, and I wouldn't change a thing about them, because they each add their own greatness to each episode.",1430956800,,558,4.224299065420561

I actually liked the Levon arc, more or less from the beginning, and his cluelessness was fairly amusing.  I watched the first episode of Season One right after watching this in order to see if there were any Seinfeldesque nods to the pilot, and it's amazing how much Becca grew up since then.  The best seasons were in the rearview long before Hank abandoned his Porche for the jumbo jet headed to New York, but this was enjoyable TV to watch.

The show started off great in the 1st season, and remained entertaining for a good while, and sustained a great variety of comedy with all of the actors and actresses, but after several seasons, it just became raunchier, and nastier, and just plain disgusting!  It's typical ""gross"" and disgusting ""guy"" humor; people throwing up, puking everywhere.  It's disgusting!  There's only so much of watching ""grown ups"" puke on themselves that a person can take.  I am not really sure why David Duchovny is even participating as one of the
Executive Directors now, because the show certainly seems to have gotten terribly worse since he came on board with ""Directing"".  The actor they brought on, as his ""so called"" illegitimate son is just disgusting!  That guy is gross!  He's nasty to look at, and all of the disgusting ""guy"" things he does on the show are just enough to make you want to ""puke"" for real!  The show is very ""tired"", and he needs to give it up already.  They just keep repeating the same nonsense they have been ""replaying"" season after season, (but making it worse and more disgusting), and it has really just

6412565,4,B00KB01QEI,"The final season of ""Californication"" managed to recapture the heart and soul of what made Hank Moody and his tale so much fun to watch over the years (beyond the gratuitous nudity ;-) ).  After an utterly bland and directionless sixth season, where he toured with the completely uninteresting, washed-up rock star, Atticus Fetch, Hank returned home to continue his quixotic quest to win the heart of his true love, Karen, and also get his life together.

  It would not be a Hank Moody story if there weren't several Hank-induced obstacles.  Among them include finding out about an unknown son, whom he fathered before he met Karen (and he looks like Jonah Hill); a reputation that leaves him with the only employment opportunity being a writer on tv show that is clearly going to be short-lived; and an increasingly estranged relationship with his daughter, Becca.

  This final season is enjoyable because you still understand why Hank pines for Karen so much (and why she can't 'quit' him); which is helped through a series of flashback scenes that show the two of them during the seemingly (but not exactly) happier early days, along with a still happily married Charlie Runkle and Marcy.  Seeing how Charlie and Marcy deal with finally be remarried is also entertaining.  I think Evan Handler has been vastly under-appreciated in his role as Charlie Runkle.  Evan has had to tap into a bit of fearlessness in order to play such flawed, and embarrassing, character, while still making you root for him.

  Funny, and moving, guest spots by Michael Imperioli, Heather Graham and Mary Lynn Rajskub also add to a fond farewell to Hank Moody.  It allows one to look back with good memories over the show's run.",1423526400,2,1711,4.8517241379310345
6412566,5,B00KB01QEI,I loved this ending! It reminds me of Catcher in the Rye when Holden finally grows up! This was truly a beautiful ending to such a refreshing series! I'm so happy with the symbolism of the car at the very end. This is a series that I won't soon forget!,1423526400,,252,4.06
6412567,1,B00KB01QEI,"Spoilers ahead, if you can call them that.

We begin the final season with an idea that I and I'm sure most everyone suspected might happen to someone like Hank eventually. He had a kid he never knew about. Great. Cool idea. But not for the final season. If anything, this should have been introduced in an earlier season, maybe even the sixth season. Because we're not given enough time to really care about this kid, who I never care about at all throughout the season anyway. Poor casting choice for one, and he's just an annoying little waste of life that really offers nothing for the show. Becca, as annoying as she can get at times, her absence is missed throughout until the very last two episodes. The Runkles of course are up to no good, but their storyline is actually the most interesting, and I'd even go as far as proposing a show that's all about them. I'd watch it. Heather Graham I've never liked in anything she's done, nor have I ever found attractive. And as someone who is supposed to be competing against Karen....come on. What a joke.

Basically, this entire final season was a drag from start to finish, introducing a handful of pointless characters while filling in the blanks with recycled bits of humor from passed seasons. Whoever is responsible for writing or putting together this season should be publicly lynched and shot and castrated. And just when we're given a glimmer of hope, around the time Becca reveals her engagement...we're never even shown the wedding. Tell me an episode or two or even a one hour special or hell...even a movie revolving around Becca's wedding wouldn't be the perfect way to end Hank's story.

All in all, this show really went downhill, starting with Season 5. So for me at least, the true ending to Hank's story will be him driving into the sunset at the end of Season 4. Congrats Showtime, you just pulled another Dexter.",1423180800,,1886,4.640718562874252

It's a shame that this season was allowed to be produced. Really.  They should have ended it when Hank got off the Band Bus and rode the motorcycle back to Karen.  Leaving us on the doorstep and wondering whatever may have become of them would have been far better than anything I saw in Season 7.  *SPOILER ALERT*  ""Indecent Proposal"" ripoff?

I wish that season 6 had been extended a few more episodes to bring this point to light. Then I would not have to endure the painful story line and characters brought in for season 7.

6412653,3,B00KB01QEI,"Unfortunately the last season of Californication falls a bit short in my opinion. It introduces several characters that felt ""misplaced"" or pretty much didn't even belong in the story. It felt like the writers of the show were somewhat panicking and wanted more substance in the story so they rushed to add characters. The whole point of Californication was never the story, it was the witty comedy and the lovable yet crazy characters that the viewers loved to watch. Overall I love the show as a whole but I was unfortunately disappointed with the last season of it.",1416182400,,568,4.8061224489795915

6412655,4,B00KB01QEI,"Fun Season and a great way to close out our 7 Season relationship with Hank Moodie and his family, friends, and fellow associates. I like that he spends this season debauching the television industry which I myself work in. As best as he tries to do right by his past errors it seems the karma of being Hank Moodie will not let up easy as his old habits continue to pop up albeit to a much lesser degree in this final season. I feel however that they could have done more with the last couple episodes and felt let down that they set up a really nice pay off for long time viewers that was left ignored in the end. I'm not sure if there really is any closure but it does seem like the obvious will take place for him as he has slown down quite a bit with his antics and seems to just want to settle down at long last with the love of his life as they go flying off into the sunset (to New York which actually would entail sunrise ironically of course).

6412670,1,B00KB01QEI,"This show, at first amusing and and even touching at points dissolved into a plot-armored, exhaustive and repetitive inconsequential nothing, full of ever-escalating shock value scenes that were just cringey and juvenile. The comparatively human, sincere aspects of the story lack gravity the more you see Hank go through life, wishy-washy, happening in and out of strange beds, skirting disaster.  I don't know how many times I could watch Hank trip and accidentally fall into some pussy like ""Whoops! It's not what it looks like"" before it got stale. The male characters are mostly precocious man-children and sexual deviants. The women are either manipulative, needy or one dimensional good time girls. Forgive the irony of this sentence, but nothing real ever happens in this show. Conflict is built up and then fizzles out whimpering. The last scene *spoiler* of Hank and Karen holding hands was just give-me-a-break-stupid. They dangled that one in front of the viewers face and snatched it away almost as many times as we saw Runkle jerking off. Seriously, there should be a youtube compilation of all of Charlie's O-faces. I actually think I may be enjoying writing this review more than I enjoyed watching the series. Why did I even stick around after the first two seasons? Because I watch TV while I knit sweaters, I have amazon prime, and it had that mesmerizing car crash thing going for it. I had to see it though to the tow trucks and ambulances.

The story of one Hank Moody and his desire to be with the only woman he has truly cared about and the daughter they raised in L.A. come to an end not with a bang but with a whimper and of all songs ""Rocket Man"".  Season Seven of the long running show comes to an end.  But not before they cram twelve epsidoes down the throats of its loyal viewers with plot lines that felt rushed and in many ways unended.
  What could have been a promising farwell to such characters like the Runkles, Karen, Becca and the like were rushed into new characters like Levon the son he never knew he had.  Or Julia the very woman he left to be with Karen before the series started.  Either way Showtime did no one any favors with the adition of  Levon as the spastic and possably insanse son.  Or wasting HEater Grham talent as the mom (Was it difficult to try and find someone to even look like LEvon character Mom?).  Sadly I feel this is the only season in which things were so disjointed that I wanted them to resolve this.  I've noticed with Shomwtime any show the produce with any seasons more then three they tend to either give the viewers the middle finger when it comes to and ending of any series (Dexter comes to mind when I think of this phrase) or they simple end it with some clasic song or medly that makes us wonder why we even tuned in to watch this stuff in the first place (Lost comes to mind for the latter in that case).  Either way if you are a die hard fan and hoping for some closure I hate to be the one to tell you this sin't going to happen.

6412752,1,B00KB01QEI,"I had great hopes for this series after the inaugural season. I found it witty, charming, funny, and sophisticated. But sadly, the wit and pleasure I got from the first season disappeared as season after season, the characters devolved into caricatures so unlikeable, pathetic, and redundant, that I hated myself for watching it every time. Much like the character Karen, I found myself sucked back into the juvenile drama, episode after episode, hoping against all reason that the show would return to its former glimmers of potential and relevance. I have only myself to blame for the hours wasted, desperately hoping THIS episode would be better. It never was.

I watched, depressed, as Karen's character was transformed from an intelligent, thoughtful, hopeful woman, to a pathetic shell of a pubescent schoolgirl, whose final devastation came from the ultimate tragedy that she was no longer Hank's first baby mama. Natascha McElhone is a lovely actress who exudes intelligence and depth. I felt betrayed by her character in the end.

This show is obviously written by people who hate women and think they're all idiots. Woman after woman is shown, season after season, throwing herself at men so despicable and unredeemable, that no woman in reality would ever even smile at them. Yet somehow we're supposed to be drawn into a storyline so divorced from any sense of reality as to be a complete and total farce...or would be, if it were in the least bit funny.",1411689600,8,1466,4.979591836734694

I'm not as pessemistic about it as some others, I like Levon, always down for Heather Graham and there were things I liked about how it ended but what bothered me throughout the series more than anything was their insistance that EVERYTHING was Hank's fault and I never thought that was fair. Karen blames him for everything but never takes responsibility for anything. Hank always finds himself in situations where women want him, he's single and doesnt want to be alone, then later he's scolded and repents because someone (karen or becca) is upset with him for something he likely didn't know before hand, like he slept with someone that is related to someone else they have a relationship with, more or less, but I thought it was unfair to continually put all the blame on him AND insist that he change, he is who he is, learn to deal with it or find someone new.

6412774,1,B00KB01QEI,"For the last few seasons, I've been lamenting the sense that CALIFORNICATION, a show that I initially really found hilarious, surprisingly moving, and very ascerbic, kept getting away from that initial season in favor of ridiculous plots, and basically making Hank Moody more sympathetic despite how grotesque his behavior was becoming. Showrunner Tom Kapinos and star David Duchovny seemed to want you, with each passing season, to actively like an extremely unlikable character and root for his Peter Pan complex as he went around having sex with as many women as possible, doing as many drugs as possible and hanging around with as many sordid and sleazy people as possible. With the show's final season, though, they lowered the bar for the show so low that it was flat-out impossible to be even vaguely entertained by it.

We pick up where we left off with Hank running from his rock opera job to tell baby mama Karen that he loves her and wants only her. This, of course, backfires. He's now jobless again and stuck in L.A. with Charlie (Evan Handler) and Marcy (Pamela Adlon), trying to rekindle their marriage. Meanwhile a strange young man Levon (Oliver Cooper) is looking to interview him for his college paper, and when he's actually able to confront Hank, Levon reveals he's his son from a relationship with Julie (Heather Graham) who came before Karen. Hank, reeling from this and also from being hired to work on a hacky cop TV show with a series of alternately dysfunctional writers and their volatile producer (Michael Imperioli), begins doing all the dumb things again while still trying to instill faith in Karen that they belong together. The B-story of the season revolves around Charlie and Marcy and their declining financial situation and how Marcy's ex Stu (Stephen Tobolowsky) is ready to rectify that by giving them a million dollars to have sex with Marcy one last time. Hank and Karen's daughter Becca (Madeline Martin) is barely anywhere to be found for most of the season and provides the deus ex machina that will force Hank to choose a lonely life of debauchery, or a life with Karen.

There are almost too many problems with this season to list. First and foremost is the character of Levon as played by Oliver Cooper, who seems like a very low-rent Jonah Hill. He's written as a manic, freakish, moronic, socially retarded mama's boy that somehow is supposed to be endearing to Hank. Julia is a freakishly enabling mother who sets very few limits for Levon (limits that should be set for an 11-year-old, let alone a college-age boy), but also is undeniably attracted and attractive to Hank. It doesn't help either that Heather Graham, while being beautiful, is a terrible and uninteresting actress and does nothing with her role. The most unforgivable sin, though, is how little they do with all of the characters. No one changes. No one advances or goes backwards. There's no tension. Every performer, particularly Duchovny, has become a parody of themselves. I actually skipped quite a few episodes because everything was just so frustratingly uninteresting. The series finale is just so insultingly hacky that it almost erases everything that was once good about the show. Of this season, the only performer that seems to make it relatively unscathed is Adlon, who still is capable of bringing a lot of energy to her role. Duchovny, an actor with a penchant for seeming somewhat unexpressive, seems to be utterly sleepwalking throughout this final season.

Like HBO's TRUE BLOOD, another show that started out as something cool and overstayed its welcome by about three seasons, CALIFORNICATION's final season is easily its worst, and we can all just thank our lucky stars that someone put this dying show out of its misery.",1411084800,15,3761,4.929022082018927

He OBVIOUSLY would not be the son of Hank who when he goes to church on the show picks a Catholic church.  I wonder who the little no talent fat boy is related to in Hollywood.  In no manner whatsoever did he deserve that role. He didn't look, nor could he act the part. Every time you see him on screen it takes you out of the story because of his pitiful acting and the writers pathetic story lines involving him.

That said, the episode (SPOILER ALERT) where Karen gets into an auto accident and the final episode really tugged on my heart strings.  They were two of the very best episodes of the entire series. It was good to see Becca in the final episodes as well.

I also loved the storyline involving Marcy and Charlie throughout the season.

Michael Imperioli (Tony's nephew on the Sopranos)and Heather Graham were GREAT in their roles!

Rob Lowe makes an appearance (unfortunately) instead of the cool and sexy no named surfer girl, or Trixie?  Please .....

All in all. I enjoyed the season very much.

Stayed mostly for the ostensible insights in to how Hwood works, lives of richandfamous, cetera, cetera. The seventh season is, for me, unwatchable. Duchovny is now the producer and you can tell. In character as Hank Moody, a bit of the magic dust of producerhood still settles on him as, 'I am the one who's making this show move, let's get it done."" No more simple acting. The mechanics of show production settle on his shoulders during scenes, betraying his status out side of the acting. Also, Heather Graham is not an actor, is she? Feels more like a model. And the addition of the new character, the son, seemed like a promising direction for the show. ""Let's see what it's like to climb the rungs from the bottom, the way Hank Moody did so long ago."" Instead, the character's portrayal descends in to a degenerafest of exposed genitalia and blatant manipulation of ""the younger generation's"" fascination with pornography. So this is what Hank Moody junior is like. A genuine misstep by Kapenos, interesting to witness how someone can lose their way in a narrative, or perhaps the money and duration of the whole thing just got to be too much.",1407974400,,1276,4.778280542986425
6412836,4,B00KB01QEI,i bought dvd and watched each episode back to back....enjoyed season 7 very much. Could have been a little better with more of Julia and Karen and less of Marcie and Stu. But all in all a solid 4 stars....I wish it would have ended with a wedding for Karen and Hank and a little more screen time for Becca !,1407888000,2,307,4.049180327868853
6412837,1,B00KB01QEI,". . . you are going to watch this final season anyway.

Know this: It is unbelievably stupid.  Not only does it not leave you wishing there was an 8th season, it leaves you wondering why there was a 7th season.  If this last season had been the first season, the show would have been cancelled after the first episode.

The writing, the acting, the casting, and the directing was the worst of any season, or any single episode in any of the previous seasons.

There is no logic to the behavior of any of the characters.  For example, a 21 yr old kid shows up and claims to be Hank's son.  Would not the first thing any reasonable person do is have a DNA check?  That never occurs to Hank.  Instead, this kid who is 21, but behaves like a 14 year old obnoxious child, and looks nothing like Hank (or his mother), is welcomed with open arms by Hank.  Huh?

Talk about Hank's character flaws: Through out all 7 seasons, have you noticed that if Hank is depressed (usually Karen is the source) he has to have several straight shots of whiskey and a pack of cigs, and if he is happy he has to have several straight shots of whiskey, and he can't drive his car unless he has whiskey and smokes, and he can't have sex unless it is preceded by shots of whiskey and cigs, and if he is bored, he has to sit in a bar and drink, etc.  You get the picture.  No one ever -- unless he is drunk and self-destructive, which goes hand in hand for him -- mentions his drinking problem.

This series should have ended on a high note last season, with Maggie Grace as his beautiful Muse and Hank not drinking -- and returning to his ""brilliant"" writing (which throughout the seasons, we never saw evidence of).  He supposedly had writing promise in the first season, but for the next six years it has been downhill.  He does not end as a hero, only a pathetic predictable loser.",1407801600,2,1857,4.2628571428571425

6412839,2,B00KB01QEI,"A once entertaining show that stayed around too long. Hank Moody became a self parody this final season, the charisma of David Duchovny notwithstanding. The introduction of Levin, his long lost son, seemed forced and the character was just a very annoying one. Sad to see a show such as this end on a bad note.",1407542400,3,310,4.553571428571429

Those of us who have been trying to live the straight and narrow but seem to never up-end out rambunctious proclivities can relate to what was a burning golden ended to that glorious 3rd season. What was a promising life for us all, with every available opportunity to make things right, seem to find ourselves right back where we started, hoping that with every morning we might just do something a little different to turn it all around. Thank you for allowing me to enjoy this series, looking in to see without, is what I enjoyed of CALIFORNICATION.",1531699200,,645,4.872727272727273

8657132,5,B00KB01QEI,"Amazing ending to an awesome series. This season was hilarious, but (like some other pieces of the series), it was a bit rushed. You could kind of tell in the last couple of episodes where they were rushing to build to a grand ending, and that made it feel a bit forced rather than gradual (like the previous season with Atticus Fetch). But the end of the last episode where everything ties together was incredible. I don't want to give it away, but just trust me-- watch it.",1524355200,,475,4.409090909090909
