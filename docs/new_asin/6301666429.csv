7813574,5,6301666429,"In no uncertain terms, Babyface's music is definitely the kinda stuff music is made of...; he's kinda like a modern day Stevie Wonder in terms of the genius in his music and has the kind of flair and whip appeal of Michael Jackson / Lionel Richie delivery. What Babyface has brought to music on a whole is a kind of revival of the music industry since the days of Paul McCartney and John Lennon, which one tends to not hear good music like this anymore. Definitely one of the greatest upcoming rising geniuses in the music industry and hopefully he'll remain a power to be reckoned with. Good, clean slick lyrical content combined with complimentary rythmn and style, and sexy video composition.",995328000,,695,4.704918032786885
