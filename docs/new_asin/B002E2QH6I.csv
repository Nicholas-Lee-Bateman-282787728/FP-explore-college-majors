3915539,3,B002E2QH6I,"Fascinated by snakes? You might be after watching this. Serpent caves and rituals, how the snake has been revered and done wrong over the years; a look from every angle.",1258761600,,169,4.666666666666667
8366796,4,B002E2QH6I,"Serpents are widely recognized as powerful symbols. We revere the serpent, whether it is portrayed as evil or not. Serpent worship has been going on for a very, very long time...and has been squashed by our modern religions for reasons covered in this DVD. It will change the way you see modern religion.",1374883200,,304,4.754716981132075
8366797,5,B002E2QH6I,The world can be a dark place when information s withheld. I was looking for light and I found it here. Another dimension to the world's greatest mysteries is unearthed and we bear witness to it. Priceless.,1374883200,,206,4.594594594594595
8366798,5,B002E2QH6I,"I personally have no complaints with this video, I thought it was fantastic. I am studying ancient serpent worship myself, and Mr. Gardiner has obviously done his research, and if you read his books you will know that too.  No, this isn't flashy, it's not particularly entertaining--it is factual, but I found it refreshing in its simplicity.  Mr. Gardiner is really onto something with his study of Ophiolatreia, and this film proves it.

If you wanted slick and perfect, look elsewhere. If you want astonishing facts, this is a great video.  If you want to know more on the subject, I would recommend his books, especially ""Secrets of the Serpent"" and his fictional novel ""The Brotherhood of the Snake.""",1336780800,,705,4.899159663865547
8366799,3,B002E2QH6I,"Much unknown information was presented here. It is up to you to take in what you want and leave the rest. I, personally, enjoyed it. However, the music was too loud and annoying. Music in the background should be consciously unnoticed but adds a small element of additional enjoyment when used. This music often drowned out what the man was saying. Not good. No music would have been best. It would have at least 4 stars if not for the irritating music.",1326844800,,453,4.536585365853658
8366800,1,B002E2QH6I,Better watch something for free on Youtube. This is boring. Narrator is boring and keeps mumbling throughout. His reasoning is questionable. Keeps referring to non existent practices in different places with no proof.,1315353600,,217,5.606060606060606
8366801,4,B002E2QH6I,"I thought the narration in this Documentary was well done. The writer seems to have done his research to make his convictions believable. I would recommend this documentary although I'm not sure If I completely believe all of the information that was presented to me, not because of the presentation of the information, but I would like to research the facts further. All in All the DVD was worth the money.",1306972800,,407,4.746478873239437
8366802,1,B002E2QH6I,"This is just terrible. First the production sucked. Poor graphics, poor video, the narrator drudges on with a few poor pictures, then back to a boring narrator talking in monotone. The text often goes off the screen.

And the producers of this clearly have a hatred of all things Christian. Highly bigoted documentary that blames Christians for all evil and the end of snake worship.

But although Christianity did oppose snake worship, so did many other religions that go back just as far as snake worship or further. Many cultures have legends of heroes destroying serpents, and human hatred of serpeants goes back far far beyond Christianity. But the producers ignore this and jsut goe after Christians with a definate hatred.

They have no proof or history to present, just simply their ideas and beliefs, which untested must be true because they believe them.

Before you buy or watch this, do yourself a favor and light yourself on fire isntead. Lighting yourself on fire would be more entertaining and less painful than watching this trash.

Should not even recieve one star.",1297987200,,1082,4.955801104972376
8366803,1,B002E2QH6I,"When you consider actually buying & watching a documentary, you awould assume (Knowing that assumptions can be dangerous), that the documentary would be research... research in the sense that you get to see clips of different people from different walks of life, & Different proffessions...

With the documentaries produced by ""Reality Films"" or whatever they like to go by, there is NO inteligence in production WHAT SO EVER... Dulled down, Collages of Images With voice over recordings, Or ONE SINGLE FILM SHOT, of some apparent proffessional, Talking, & discussing things.... What a BLOODY Bore... Why don't you guys just consider making them into Audio CD documentaries??? Then AT LEAST we'll have some Idea of what we're getting into, & NOT BUY them....

I won't be buying any productions from this company anymore... Kindergartners make better visuals in their drawings in grade school...

Whats EVEN more distracting is the ""background music"", that seems to take over the voice of the speaker... GOD... I can't even here myself THINK... Sorry, but this (Alonge with ANY Other production I have purchasec from ""Reality"" company), is a waste of $$$

I'd Advice you to stay away, if you want good Graphically documented, & visual descriptives... Save your Money...",1280793600,6,1268,5.200980392156863
8366804,3,B002E2QH6I,"This is a good survey/history of snake-worship.  Serpents (snakes) have been a part of religious observance for some 70,000 years, it seems.  Fortunately, the DVD sticks to the last 3,000.  It rambles a bit, and overall conclusions are a little scarce.  Basically, author Philip Gardiner is trying to convince us that snakes are a large part of religious history, both visible and hidden.

I was particularly intrigued by the short section which connected Ian Fleming to snake-worship, but again, there didn't seem to be any conclusion.

As to ""Biggest Religious Cover Up in History,"" I think that's all hype.  But certainly Gardiner has done us a favor by pointing out the various snake iconography in religious works, which may not get much attention otherwise.",1275696000,,763,5.104838709677419
8366805,3,B002E2QH6I,"This looks like a low budget documentary that discusses the origin of snake worship. Pretty good movie about this subject, but looks a bit grainy and like it was dubbed from a VHS tape. Lots of good information and better than reading a long drawn out book on the subject. All religions developed from serpent worship at some point is the main view of this documentary. Good commentary, and narration. This was not made by your normal group of alien cover up conspiracy theorist types who do not provide any background information. Very well done on researching the subject. Better quality video and showmanship would make this a better documentary.",1270512000,4,649,4.909090909090909
