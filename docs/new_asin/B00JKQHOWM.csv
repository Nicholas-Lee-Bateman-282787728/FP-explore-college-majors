6373304,4,B00JKQHOWM,"It was a good documentary but didn't really expose anything I didn't know or suspect. Women's cycling is getting the shaft. It's the catch 22 where they can't get sponsors because there is no audience and there's no audience because there's no coverage and there's no coverage because there's no sponsors. It is the vicious cycle repeated endlessly. Not all women's sports are going to work and I don't believe you should just get financing just because you have a passion. A sport has to hold its own and be as entertaining as its male counterpart to work.
For me personally, women's basketball is terrible and I don't care if some feel it's a 'purer game', I won't watch it. However, women's cycling I would watch because their technical skills are on par with the men's and I think the races are just as entertaining and them getting passed over because of some male old-guard attitude is a crime. Of course here in the states, you can't get any coverage unless you shell out bucks and TDF coverage is about all you get...or try to watch it over euro-pirate channels and risk viruses.
I think women's cycling, especially in Europe, given time and some push, would go over and become self sustaining within a reasonable period.",1473984000,2,1229,4.694444444444445

6373308,5,B00JKQHOWM,"Not just about women's cycling, far more here. Most important the film does not advocate from a ""feminist"" point of view. Or try to create a ""us"" versus ""them"", attitude. It is simply about fairness. And women cyclists are not being treated fairly, period. For me the UCI is so out of date. A last refuge of old white guys.

6373309,5,B00JKQHOWM,"ok, I read the top supposed ""positive"" review and the top negative review.  So far as the positive review goes, it was a NEGATIVE review disguised as a positive by the stars.  The male who wrote the negative review just needs to be taken out by all women cyclists and slapped senseless, oh wait, he's ALREADY senseless.  No, this film is NOT outdated!  The gross disparity CONTINUES.  Women STILL are paid much much less, there are fewer opportunities for them to compete, the races are not on par with the men's races, the prizes are much much less, and the opportunities for when they retire to remain in the sport in some fashion are non-existent since they must work full time in order to support themselves.  To be honest, it is a wonder to me that there are as many women in professional cycling as there are since most must work full time AND train full time.  Their dedication to the sport NEEDS to be supported and rewarded.  Documentaries such as this needs to be APPLAUDED not looked down on in snide, derogatory comments posing as reviews!",1469664000,,1051,4.5828877005347595

The UCI rules that reflect presumed physical inequalities are ridiculous, as are the uphill challenges for cyclists from smaller countries trying to qualify for the Olympics.  Didn't know anything about until watching this.  Also didn't know they had women's competitive cycling in Syria.

6373318,5,B00JKQHOWM,"I couldn't agree more with the premise of this film -- if the media would give women's cycling decent coverage, most cycling fans would be all in.  I only started watching professional cycling a few years ago, and of course that means watching men's professional cycling almost exclusively because that's all that's being televised.  In the last couple of years, I've noticed that the big road races seem to be giving a little token TV time to the women's events, but the way it's been done is almost insulting to the women's sport.  In the men's coverage, we get to learn all about the riders, their careers, and even a bit of their personal lives as the camera follows them along the road for hours.  You really get to know who the riders are and start to feel a connection to some or many of them (develop your favorites).  With the women's events, it seems they just break away from the men's coverage for a few moments to show you the women's finish line.  I've found that I have no idea who these women are and have had no real interest in which one wins the race because I've never had an opportunity to connect with any of them.  That has changed for me somewhat just by watching this documentary -- I've gotten to know a few of the riders, and that will make a world of difference the next time I see them in a race (even if it's just at the finish line).  Some believe things have already changed for the better, and I do agree in part that they have.  Like I said, I have noticed lately that women's events are getting very brief coverage at some of the men's events.  But it hasn't changed enough.  Women should be able to race whatever distance they want to race, and not be stifled by archaic rules that aren't based in fact.  Women are great endurance athletes.  They should also get equal coverage -- let the fans get to know who these riders are -- let there be connection.  I know I would follow the women's events as intently as I do the men's if there was enough coverage of women's events to be of substance, and I believe most or all of my cycling friends and cycling-fan friends would as well.  I think this expanding coverage would be an all-around win for women cyclists, fans, media, and sponsors.  Keep up the good fight ladies.",1465776000,,2255,4.384615384615385

This film sheds light on darkness that you didn't know existed.  You know Venus Williams, Mia Hamm, and Lindsey Vonn.  Name one female cyclist.  Why can't you?  This film will explain why, and make you angry.  The first 65% of the movie is riveting.  It gets a little slow from 65% to 85%, but the ending saves it.  A few LOL funny parts in the movie too!

I hadn't watched the trailer before watching this film and thought that it might be similar to the excellent Race Across America, which was the first cycling film I watched. If you've not seen Leo De Haan's, I strongly advise you to add it to your list. Here's the link http://amzn.to/1NHlYhb.

Going back to Half The Road, I really do feel that something needs to be done about the inequalities surround female cycling sports. This film brought it to my attention and I really do feel that it leaves a bad taste in the mouth when it comes to sporting equalities. I definitely think you should watch it.",1460073600,,689,4.548387096774194

6373341,1,B00JKQHOWM,"I'm sympathetic to anyone who wants to be a competitive athlete. I expected the documentary to be good and concerned mostly with sports. After 40 minutes, I fast forwarded to the end, and the people were still making the same weak arguments for their cause to get money and recognition from others regardless of individual achievement. Watching the remainder of the movie was even worse the next day, since it revolved around tangential concerns rather than the clear and simple need to put up good numbers in racing events. Sports existed thousands of years before radio and TV and the narcissistic phenomenon of ""inspiring"" role models seeking money and mass media attention. I doubt the UCI has any power to artificially stimulate interest in cycling events. I doubt the UCI has any incentive to dilute the history and meaning of major races by having parallel (and easier) events. I doubt women will find themselves elevated if the goal of equality in a corrupt and dirty sport is achieved. I doubt that being subjected to harsh economic reality is under the control of high ranking people in the UCI. The UCI, as I see it, is little more than a group of bloodsucking leeches crushing innovation and holding back all of cycling. Playing into its power game only reinforces its shaky and dwindling prestige.

The documentary needed independent and thoughtful arguments against the constant barrage of simplistic and dubious claims. I am very suspicious of bandwagon fallacies, and resented so much screen time being devoted to one side, as if having similar viewpoints from a large group was somehow meant to be convincing. The lack of statistics to bolster the hard to believe claims of athletic equality was bothersome. At present, the best hour distance record for a female track cyclist is 88.3% of the men's record. It seems presenting such numbers with candor would not help win supporters to the cause. Titling the movie, ""44.15% of the road,"" while accurate, would tend to undercut economic arguments based more on entitlement than athletic merit. I would have liked to know what the men's minimum wage was, and if any pro cyclists managed to live well on such pay without complaining or lowering themselves to performing actual work in demand by society. In the interest of equality, I oppose the UCI's minimum wage policy too, and would prefer all prize money to go solely to winners of events. This would narrow the field and win more respect for those cyclists capable of being professional enough to live on prize money and third party sponsorship. Speaking of sponsors, the uncritical praise heaped upon Colavita and Exergy was tantamount to logrolling and product placement.

Appealing to emotion is no substitute for logic and hard evidence. The dismissal of the concept of walking away from the discriminatory UCI was bizarre, since it seems like a good response to me in light of the sport's ugly history of corruption. I can't understand why anyone is eager to join and benefit from institutions that do not serve their needs. It's a weak position to plead for and demand change when the door is wide open to go independent and immediately establish any mandate for equal pay desired. The fact that this option isn't done speaks to the pathetically subservient and cult-like attitude of victimization that is probably holding women back far more than sexist men who just want to have races and pursue fleeting glory. Running an independent and inclusive organization would require responsibility and accountability, and I doubt, given the economic and audience preference realities in a marketplace saturated with sports coverage, that much money would come in over the long term to sustain such a bold and respectable move.

The last place rider in the 2015 Tour de France, with car crash injuries, still finished in a time 4.9% longer than the winner. If the more than 10% distance gap between male and female hour records is any guide, I predict the best female cyclists would not be able to match such a time in a truly fair and equal competition. Ratings and public interest tend to drop off after the winners finish. This, not sexism, is the essence of the problem. It also reveals the folly of lighter and lighter weight bicycle parts as performance aids, since one would think smaller and lighter women could dominate men in mountain stages, have aerodynamic advantages, and have more responsive acceleration for tactical moves on level ground. In another totally equal sporting event, the 1500 meter running race, the female champion's time is 20.4 seconds behind the 25th place men's champion. Women have to improve their athleticism to gain public interest in today's sports / show business environment. I recommend reaching inside for power rather than wasting time begging for help from outside and lecturing everyone about being held back by sexism.

The movie might work if it threw in some frank and realistic quotes from economists, biologists, and sports media executives before people yammered on about the topic. Anything to break the weird ""dissent free zone"" spell of greedy, collectivist groupthink.",1454112000,,5144,5.012865497076024

The UCI does not have enough women in leadership rolls. I do not understand how the UCI committee knows how a women works.

The entire UCI attitude toward women athletes is disappointing to say the least. Give the women cycling athletes a fair wage and fair event winnings.  And to make this even more bizarre, a pro team will rehire doping cheaters after suspension for millions of dollars instead of developing a women team. Shame on them.

In terms of content it is huge shakes, be in no doubt! Well done to Kathryn Bertine and her 'team' for having the courage to speak out about the every day inequalities they face(d) and the outrageously (in this day and age) blatant sexism of the UCI.

At the time of watching I found myself feeling hugely depressed by the relentless obstacles and and lack of support (offered to their male counter parts) faced by these women riders. But my friend found it inspiring and I can also see why, in fact over time it's the positives in the film that have stayed with me. The women in this documentary are amazing, they have fought against the odds to achieve what they have achieved. They have aimed high, trained hard and persevered with their dreams. There are a number of men too who have not been afraid to support the cause of equality - and good for them. Sadly, the officials from the UCI - quite unashamedly - show themselves to be both bigoted and ignorant.

This DVD should be of interest to all cyclists and anyone with an interest in equality - which should be everyone. And when you've watched it, read Nicole Cooke's The Breakaway. And then get on your bike!",1416700800,4,1410,4.543307086614173

8651853,5,B00JKQHOWM,"moral of the story: misogyny is alive and well in the cycling world, some men are pigs. This film does an excellent job of highlighting this inequality and of showing the women out there who are ready to crush and doing something about it.",1514160000,,239,4.454545454545454
8651854,2,B00JKQHOWM,"Well, I used to race on the USSR national level (with one of the girls that was listed as died in 2009 in the movie Zinaida Stagurskaya, thou she was a little younger). Honestly I would say women cycling would never be on the same level as the guys one. In terms of the salary and in terms of the technical level as well. First of all, you can't even see the media coverage of the men cycling in the states (unless you're paying $100 for cable TV) just because not many people are interested in cycling here, let alone women cycling. It's all about finding the sponsors. Lets just be realistic, not many guys will watch women races unless they have a  girlfriend/wife/daughter racing and women in general don't watch sport at all. But sponsors want their company's name being seen by millions not just a few people. For example, that cooking company sponsor. how they can pay a lot if they're not making a lot themselve. Who's interested in cooking? Mostly women, but most of the women don't watch sport. So from the sponsor's of view I perfectly understand that it's not worth to invest in women cycling because there's not much in return. Plus, again be honest and admit it's not fun to watch women sport events including women cycling, except maybe gymnastics or figure skating. And it says a woman who used to be a pretty high level cyclist and who loves sport in general and who watches many different sports events, but sorry to women I don't really watch women sports. That's exactly why women cycling will never be on the same level as men's one cause most of the women are not interested in sport at all let alone women cycling.",1501113600,,1637,4.511784511784512
8651855,3,B00JKQHOWM,OK documentary; doesn't really reveal anything not already known. Seems to me that professional women cyclists should create their own governing body and leave the UCI altogether. I don't really get what's keeping them there.,1500422400,,225,5.457142857142857
8651856,5,B00JKQHOWM,"I think the documentary was well done and I'm curious to know what the current conditions of women cycling are. I think the women's competitive cycling is just as good as the men's but it will take time for them to make the money they deserve. Unfortunately, with the money leaving the men's tour, I think it means that the women will still not be paid for the entertainment that they provide. It's sad, but reality.",1486339200,,416,4.4868421052631575
8651857,5,B00JKQHOWM,Great documentary. Hopefully someday soon women won't have to fight for their equal place at the table.,1485216000,,103,5.117647058823529

8651859,5,B00JKQHOWM,This documentary was very eye opening about the inequalities in women's cycling. I couldn't believe some of the things that were being said by the governing body about the sport and about the abilities of women. I ended up watching this twice. It was very inspiring.,1483920000,,266,4.804347826086956

8651861,5,B00JKQHOWM,"Unbelievable.. as a novice rider starting again, but a long time fan of the sport, I don't understand the disparity and that it still exists today...

Especially ironic considering the Lance Armstrong debacle in men's rode cycling (and the majority of the men's tours for years)...",1481155200,,281,5.108695652173913
