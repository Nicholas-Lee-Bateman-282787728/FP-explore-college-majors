2503308,4,B000E6TVSC,"Although she's had a long and wonderful career, I'm guessing that most Americans will recognize Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagal from the ""Harry Potter"" films.  A few may recall her time in films like ""The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" and the ""Sister Act"" films.  Heck, if you go back as far as I do, you might remember her from ""Clash of the Titans.""  It's no matter, because she is simply hilarious and twisted in ""Keeping Mum,"" where she plays a loving housekeeper with a very effective and final way of cleaning things up.  The film begins with a little bit of background on Smith's character and then hurtles forty-three years into modern times where we get to meet the Goodfellow family.  The head of the family is Reverend Walter Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson), a well-meaning but ultimately dull and clueless vicar of the local church in Little Wallop.  His wife, Gloria (Kristin Scott Thomas), is in search of a little more ""action"" in her life.  His daughter, Holly (Tamsin Egerton), is something of a slut and his son, Petey (Toby Parkes) is constantly harassed at school by bullies.

When Grace Hawkins (Smith) strolls into Little Wallop to take a job as the Goodfellow's housekeeper, things begin to oddly change for the better.  The vicar is suddenly inspired to write a funny keynote address for an upcoming conference.  Holly turns off the oven in the bedroom and discovers the joys of baking.  Petey becomes unafraid of his cruel schoolmates.  The only person still somewhat unaffected by the arrival of Grace is Gloria, although she does begin to sleep through the night with more ease due to some devious acts.

Gloria is still seeking out that ""something"" that's missing from her relationship with her husband.  She thinks she finds it blossoming in a secret relationship with her American golf instructor, Lance.  Lance is played to sleazy perfection by Patrick Swayze.  As Grace becomes more involved with Gloria's predicament, things get devilishly fun.  From lewd phone calls to video cameras, Grace has her hands full trying to save the Goodfellows' marriage.

Atkinson is perhaps most familiar to U.S. audiences as the bungling ""Mr. Bean"" or the devious ""Black Adder.""  Both were often featured on PBS and ""Mr. Bean"" was turned into a mildly successful theatrical release in America.  Atkinson was also the voice of ""Zazoo"" in ""The Lion King,"" as well as having bit roles in a number of other American comedies.  Thomas has been in a few films here in the U.S., but they escape my memory right now.  Swayze, of course, is Swayze.  If you grew up in the U.S. during the 80's or even 90's, you know who he is.  All of the cast do a wonderful job.

There is a bit of strong language, especially from the mouth of Thomas.  There's also a tad bit of toplessness from Holly and some sexuality (though no nudity) involving Thomas and Swayze and even Thomas and Atkinson (Mr. Bean scores!).  There's also a few moments where a sweet old lady whacks a few people, so the ""R"" rating is necessary.  Don't let your kids watch this film.  Other than that, this is a great dark comedy for folks of the suggested viewing age.

Although you'll often shake your head and declare that you shouldn't laugh, it's just too hard not to as Smith carries out her quiet, lethal plans to clean up the mess that is the Goodfellow family.  She has good reason to as well, but even though it's pretty obvious from the start of the film, I won't reveal why.  Her nanny-like precision of making sure things turn out right make for a hilarious film, and I really recommend that fans of Smith, Atkinson, or anyone else in the flick should check this movie out.

Highly recommended.",1172275200,12,3685,4.725705329153605
2503309,3,B000E6TVSC,"""Keeping Mum"" is a black comedy in the tradition of 1944's ""Arsenic and Old Lace"". Enjoying the film requires, above all, the willingness to laugh at murder. Early drafts of the screenplay were written by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Richard Russo. Niall Johnson produced the final script and directs the film. In the English village of Little Wallop, the Vicar, Reverend Walter Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson), is indeed a good fellow, attentive to his parishioners, serious about his job, but perhaps a little dull. His neglected and frustrated wife Gloria (Kristen Scott Thomas) considers turning to her obnoxious American golf instructor (Patrick Swayze) for affection and respite from the dramas of her bullied son and wanton daughter (Tamsin Egerton). But the family's problems begin to turn around with the arrival of a new housekeeper, Miss Grace Hawkins (Maggie Smith), a very proper elderly lady with an unusual sense of ethics.

It took me a while to get into this film, and my ability to do so at all is on account of the cast, not the story. ""Keeping Mum"" is a very British, straightforward black comedy, where the bodies pile up as the family comes together. Grace Hawkins' matter-of-fact social pathology has a certain gruesome charm. When she disapproves of someone, she does the obvious -to the horror of the normal folk around her. The characters are believable enough, but perhaps not quite likable enough to make this great comedy. ""Keeping Mum"" is pleasant enough entertainment -if you don't find the body count too unpleasant.

The DVD (ThinkFilms 2007): Bonus features include a theatrical trailer (2 min), 11 deleted scenes, outtakes and bloopers (6 min), an extended version of the soccer game scene (2 min), an alternative opening ""Rosie Jones"" sequence (not as interesting as the one that made the final cut) with optional director's commentary (3 min), and an audio commentary by director and co-writer Niall Johnson. This is a pretty good non-stop commentary in which Johnson talks about the 5-year history of the production, the 2 different opening sequences, production design, locations, performances, camera work, and what was left in or taken out and why. Subtitles for the film are available in Spanish.",1172102400,18,2237,5.1597796143250685
2503310,4,B000E6TVSC,"This is a delicious twist on Mary Poppins with Maggie Smith playing the

""trunk killer""...that is she was sent to an institution because she was traveling with a trunk that carried the cut up remains of her philandering husband and his mistress.

Now she's back and doing housework for a minister's family in a small English town.  Her approach to problems is to eliminate them...literally.

How can you suspect such a charming, smiling, old lady?

As for the minister, our Maggie Smith has some suggestions...lighten up your sermons with religious jokes and spice up your personal life with a little sex.  I loved the ""reading"" of the Song of Solomon in the movie...one of the best readings of King James selections that was moving and erotic.

This is good fun and a must for Maggie Smith fans.",1171929600,67,796,4.766423357664234
2503311,4,B000E6TVSC,"British comedies about murderous old people snuffing out the unwitting or the deserving are legion. My first experience was the play ""Arsenic & Old Lace."" That black comedy returns in a fairly funny script bolstered by great performances in Keeping Mum.

Smith plays new housekeeper Grace Hawkins, an evil Mary Poppins type who silences noisy animals the hard way and punishes the bullies of one of her charges, Petey, with judicious snips of important wires. The family enjoys her excellent advice and the sudden absence of annoyances in their lives. Atkinson plays an overly serious vicar who gets a chance to show off his acting skills as a kind man of God, but also fumbling as a not-too-cool or sexually vivacious husband. Scott Thomas is his dissastified wife on the verge of infidelity with an American golf instructor (Swayze). Son Petey is mostly incidental, but daughter Holly's issue is nymphomania and too many boyfriends.

The heads roll as the comedy rolls on, but so do doses of pleasant humor and plenty of ways to sympathize with the odd Grace Hawkins, who may be crazy but also seems to love her newfound home and its inhabitants.

This is nothing new, but it's old hat that will appeal to comedy fans. It's not completely family friendly, though. There's almost no grisly, despite the fact that deaths rack up, but there is some frontal nudity of the older daughter. And it may end sweetly, but the moral of the story is a bit twisted in this twisted family home.

2503312,5,B000E6TVSC,"This movie was quite a surprise. I managed to find a theater that was actually showing it several months back. I was certainly not disappointed and in fact was quite surprised how good this little film was. It is a black comedy in the best sense as only the British can concoct. What makes it stand apart from the ordinary is its witty screenplay by Richard Russo and Niall Johnson, Gavin Finney's beautiful cinematography and very good performances from Rowan Atkinson, Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas and an unlikely Patrick Swayze. This film is a wonderful and curious melding of the dark side of human emotions with expressions of true and meaningful love and the potential we all have to love and be loved but find so difficult to express or accept. The beautiful and colorful photography is unusually exquisite and quite moving giving one moments of exhilaration and reflection on what beautiful wonders the world beholds for those that can grasp it and become one with it.  Maggie Smith's Mary Poppins-like character is the answer to Rowan Atkinson's uninspired but well intentioned local vicar who cannot really clearly express his theological virtues or the love and passion he has for his wife Kristin Scott Thomas. Maggie Smith takes things into her own hands and helps his family who has more issues than can be imagined. And there it is.",1171324800,5,1353,4.8826086956521735
2503313,5,B000E6TVSC,"I have to agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer, so this is essentially a 'ditto' comment.  The actors were the draw for me to see this movie, all having excellent reputations.  Unfortunately I had to go to another state to see it, raved about it to friends and co-workers, and then it was gone within a week!  Too bad, people missed a good thing.

Since my only knowledge of Rowan Atkinson was through his TV series, ""Thin Blue Line,"" and ""Blackadder,"" I was surprised and intrigued to see the depth he gave his character, the beleagured, bewildered, and somewhat otherworldly husband. Loved Maggie Smith as Grace and Kristin Scott Thomas as the edgy wife.  Patrick Swayze is a hoot as a sleazey golf pro.",1168560000,10,716,4.741935483870968
2503314,5,B000E6TVSC,"This is probably the most touching film about homicidal old ladies I have ever seen. Grace (Maggie Smith) is not your ordinary homicidal grandmother - she has a heart of gold. When she comes into the life of the Reverend of Little Wallop (Rowan Atkinson) she immediately takes a proprietorial interest in his family's wellbeing. Before long Grace is proactively sorting out a lot of family problems - the son's bullies, the daughter's awful boyfriends, the Reverend's lack of confidence and his wife's marital woes. At the same time, a number of people and animals that get in the way of Grace's plans start disappearing. She is so charmingly innocent and so completely well-intentioned that it is hard to hold her methods against her. In fact, I spent most of the film cheering for her. Grace is a very rare character indeed (the closest approximate I can think of is Angela from ""Sleepaway Camp II & III"" - possibly a younger variation of the same creature) and we need more like her.

The film is undoubtedly aided by an excellent cast. The central character, the reverend's frustrated wife Gloria, is played by the very convincing (not to mention attractive) Kristin Scott Thomas who effectively carries most of the film. Maggie Smith is adorable as the innocently-menacing Grace. Patrick Swayze is perfect as the hunky lothario/sleazoid pursuing both Gloria and her daughter. Jeez, he aged well, and I think he was perfect for this part (which is sort of a compliment). Given first billing despite performing in what was essentially a supporting role,is Rowan Atkinson in probably his most subdued role ever as the Reverend of Little Wallop. Don't let that deter you if you're a fan. He still manages to be hilarious without having to lift a finger and when he does go into full comedy mode he is marvellous. However, it is his performance as the absent-minded workaholic vicar who seems helpless in the face of his unravelling marriage that is both touching and believable and demonstrates acting capabilities I would not have expected of him.

In short, this is a very funny and sweet film that should not be missed.",1167004800,258,2123,4.861878453038674
2503315,5,B000E6TVSC,"Let's see... the vicar of Little Wallop is so immersed in his work that his lack of physical attention has his wife falling into the arms of her golf instructor.  And then there is the new housekeeper, a delightfully charming older woman who clearly has a few secrets.  That's okay, because the vicar's hormonally-charged daughter would do well to keep at least a few of her activities secret; and his son, well his son could just do with a little more protection from the school bullies.  Other than that, the tiny parish is just a typical English village, where the biggest controversies are the algae in the pond and the intrigue of the church flower decoration committee.  Right!

To be honest, there aren't that many genuine surprises in the plot, but that doesn't detract from all the fun.  Let's just say that the Grace, the housekeeper has her own way of making the Goodfellow home a more quiet and pleasant place.

Maggie Smith makes the whole thing work, as kind of a Mary Poppins from the dark side.  Her coy smile, belies her darker nature and Ms. Smith is one of the few actresses capable of successfully selling a line like ""you know, my therapist and I were always discussing that and we just couldn't come to an understanding.""

As the beleaguered wife of the vicar, Kristin Scott Thomas makes for a very believable character who loves her husband deeply but whose frustrations have made her vulnerable to the lascivious attentions from her American horn-toad golf pro.  Patrick Swayze as the would-be home wrecker won't do a lot for the image of American men, but he does make a comic pervert (no easy trick, I'm sure).  And Rowan Atkinson gives a wonderfully understated performance as Walter Goodfellow, the overly absorbed vicar.  Now think about that, when was the last time you saw the words ""Rowan Atkinson"" and ""understated performance"" in the same sentence?",1162425600,3,1882,4.792569659442725

Things take a turn for the better when the new housekeeper arrives...

It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

Maggie Smith, Rowan Atkinson, Kristin Scott Thomas, Patrick Swayze and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over.

I am not a Roan fan, but after this movie, i wonder why he has not done more serious roles.  And I was never a fan of Thomas, but was of Patrick Swayze.

2503390,4,B000E6TVSC,"The family of the retiring and oblivious Reverend Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson) is falling apart: his wife (Kristin Scott Thomas) is lonely and looking for solace with the golf instructor (Patrick Swayze), his daughter is running wild, and his son is being bullied at school.

What they don't realize is that 43 years ago, Grace was responsible for clearing up a problem of her own in a most interesting way.

In this disturbingly entertaining black comedy, the veteran cast display their excellent acting skills. Atkinson is particularly great, and it's hard to find a better actress than Dame Maggie Smith.  The story line was engaging from the beginning and flowed with good timing. The humor is not going to be for everyone, but I often found it laugh-out-loud funny.

2503547,5,B000E6TVSC,"It turns out that I had seen this movie a couple of times before, but that did not stop me from enjoying it again. If you are looking for Atkinson to do his goofy stuff, forget it. Here he plays your average husband who happens to be a vicar. The story begins many decades in the past where a woman on a train is found in possession of a trunk that is leaking blood. She is locked away in an asylum for the criminally insane. Moving to the present time, a family with a lot on its plate decides that they need a maid to help take up some of the slack in their complicated lives. Enter Maggie Smith. That is all I am saying. Have fun !",1475020800,18,634,3.9609375

2503977,5,B000E6TVSC,"Wasn't expecting much from this old 2006 movie, but something to pass the time.  I am happy to say though, that time was one of the most enjoyable movie watching experiences I've had in a long time.  Keeping Mum is a very clever dark comedy movie.  If you've enjoyed films such as Heathers, Fargo, Hot Fuzz, Death at a Funeral and the like, then you'll love this combination of The Hand the Rocked the Cradle and Mrs Doubtfire (without anyone dressing up as the opposite gender).  Maggie Smith plays a preacher's (Rowan Atkinson's) family's new housekeeper, who is determined to make sure her employer family members are not bothered by school bullies or and have unsavoury influences threaten the sanctity of marriage.  Also annoying barking dogs and meddlesome gossipy old church ladies who think every second of the day should revolve around them are going to have to change their ways one way or another.  ""Keeping Mum"" is an English saying for keeping quiet (""Mum's the Word"" is another), and the film plays this concept out beautifully with its brilliant silencing those who wish to disturb the family elderly housekeeper.

Patrick Swayze does a good job as an older golf pro, who is also an escape her boring existence love interest for the preacher's wife (Kristen Scott Thomas). I can't remember seeing too many of his as an older actor movies, Swayze delivers this role very well.  Tasmin Egerton does a good job as the rebellious teen daughter who unlike her brother isn't your stereotypical preacher's kid.",1427500800,,1518,4.879377431906615

2504047,4,B000E6TVSC,"If you get the joke in the above lyrics you may be able to get the joke in Keeping Mum. This is an essentially light movie but very dark humor. How dark? One of the sight gags consists of an otherwise innocent elderly person being prematurely handed over to the choir celestial by being whacked on the head by a second severely non-innocent elderly person. Like I said dark humor and if it works for you this movie should work for you.

In the opening scenes of this movie a rather sweet looking pregnant young lady boards a train with a very large steamer trunk. The unfortunate part of this scene is that her steamer trunk is leaking blood. We next see the still sweet looking pregnant young lady moving into a very small cell in a mental facility where her number one concern is her prospects of getting a nice cup of tea. The scene shifts forward in time where we meet the family of the local pastor and overworked man with time management problems ( Rowan Atkinson) his increasingly frustrated wife (Kristin Scott Thomas) their libidinous teenage daughter and shy bullied son. This is a family in need of a nanny. And who shortly arrives? A sweet looking not so young lady in  possession of a very familiar looking steamer trunk.
Ms. Grace (Dame Maggie Smith) is the now released and no longer pregnant by many years lady with the embarrassing steamer trunk. It will fall to her hands to do what must be done to solve the myriad problems and the struggling modern family. A large numbers of movies feature a parent claiming she will readily kill for the sake of her family. Ms. Grace is clearly a woman who was taken this concept to heart. Although-she will never really solve the problem of the fishpond.

Keeping Mum is a rather subtle somewhat slow-paced comedy but comedy it is. As the put upon and tempted wife, Kristin Scott Thomas is actually to pivot to this movie. Her character-Gloria Goodfellow carries all of the pressures of what is going wrong in her family seeing all and hearing all and noticing first when things suddenly get too quiet. Ms Thomas performs her role beautifully. I tend to be somewhat leery of Rowan Atkinson movies. His bumbling incompetent Mr. Bean can sometimes be overwhelming. Here the actor understands his is a secondary role and therefore provides a far more subtle and effective performance. His sudden realization that God can make things better by granting a little grace is a very winning and well-timed chuckle. It is axiomatic that Maggie Smith as Grace Hawkins is spot on flawless. This lady who will unfortunately be known primarily for her skills with a wand and cauldron is just as deadly if the dual is with an iron skillet.

Be advised, the language and a few visuals are not appropriate for all audiences. Once again there are those who have no problem with bloodshed that will turn away in disgust at the sight of a bared breast. There is not much of either but both occur in this movie. There is also some crude language more than one would like to think occurs in the home of the well-meaning and kindly pastor. Consider yourself warned: dark humor glimpses of a topless female and several of the harsher four letter Anglo-Saxon terms. Other than that you were invited to enjoy murder most humorous, as a little grace is applied to bring together a loving family.",1420329600,12,3324,4.628813559322034

2504231,5,B000E6TVSC,"When was the last time you saw a REALLY black-humored British comedy? This one is a dandy! Recommended by the Swedish branch of JayFlix, I finally got a look at it a couple of days ago.

First of all, the cast:
  * Maggie Smith (""Ladies in Lavender"" and ""Harry Potter"") a just-paroled murderer, now hired as a housekeeper
  * Kristen Scott Thomas (""The English Patient"" and ""The Horse Whisperer"") a frustrated minister's wife
  * Rowan Atkinson (""Four Weddings..."" and ""The Black Adder"") the frustrating minister
  * Patrick Swayze (""Dirty Dancing"" and ""Ghost"") a smarmy golf pro
  * Tamsin Egerton (I think she's new) a gorgeous young actress who is the minister's precocious daughter!

The minister's family lives next door to an annoying neighbor who has a constantly yapping dog, Clarence. The minister is such an excruciatingly boring speaker, his wife stays in bed; she can't bear to sit through his sermons any more. He is totally oblivious to the catastrophe looming in his own family. An elderly member of the congregation has a chronic problem with the flower arranging committee...AND she's snoopy! The daughter is not only beautiful, she's promiscuous. The son is bullied by his classmates simply because he is the minister's son. The golf pro is on the make...all the time...

Enter Grace, the newly hired housekeeper. In no time at all, she assesses the situation and starts to rectify things. Watching her kick into action is a treat, even though you will probably recoil from some of her methods.

I will emphasize: This is a BLACK comedy, but it's fun just the same. These are great actors who play characters who run true to form and you can't help but cheer them on. Just remember to suspend disbelief! (...and blood will tell...)

I got my DVD from Amazon long before they started keeping track.",1389484800,,1815,4.866449511400652

2504319,5,B000E6TVSC,"Although it would seem the least likely of films, because of its religious over-tones, that a very broad general audience could laugh heartily throughout, the story and actors both make this movie an exquisitely sly comedy that is not dark at all. Dame Maggie Smith is understatedly hilarious as Grace, the housekeeping, babysitting, master chef one-woman-does-it-all for a minister's slightly dysfunctional family. Without spoiling this motion picture for anyone, it must be noted that there's a little bit of murder that frames the lives of this British family. The murderous part of the plot is both the conflict with the religious part, as well as, the best of the comical parts.

The script is very tight, to the point that is, with one-liner quips that only an actor of the stature of Maggie Smith can deliver with such acumen. This time, Dame Maggie packs a hilarious punch for those of us who have often thought about doing what several of the cast actually do. This is one of the best reasons why I'm such a fan of British comedy. There's a whole lot of truth-telling in the fiction that so many of the masses can well relate to. For that reason, this is an exceptional film that somehow slid under the public's radar screen.",1375228800,7,1234,4.766355140186916

The wife craves attention, which has her playing more than golf with her instructor.  The daughter has a different boy for each day of the week.  The son is afraid of his own shadow.

I say this without being a real fan of Rowan Atkinson's 'Mr. Bean' series, Monty Python and the televised mini-series version of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy were more my style. All the performances and characters in the film are well played but Atkinson is magnificent in the role of the shy retiring pastor and Maggie Smith's performance is probably one of the best I've seen. I wish I had a 'grandmotherly' person like her in my household - well, maybe not given how the story unfolds but no spoilers here; you owe it to yourself to check this film out. Even our adult son who typically has a much different sense of humor than we do could not stop laughing throughout this film; it deserves to become a classic like Bringing Up Baby or Young Frankenstein.",1356220800,,995,4.533333333333333

2504492,5,B000E6TVSC,"I first saw this movie at the behest of my mother-in-law, whose taste in books and films tends openly toward the classical and, dare I say it, the socially provocative side. She'll smile wistfully at Monty Python, but thinks ""Fawlty Towers"" is brilliant (True, John Cleese does seem to have the Midas touch when it comes to comedy). So when she recommended this film I have to admit I raised an eyebrow. I mean, come on. Rowan Atkinson? The impish, voiceless, tragically stupid and mostly unfunny Mr. Bean?  How could she?

Well, let me just say that this may be the sleeper movie in my entire collection and maybe in my entire movie-going experience. Nevermind that Patrick Swayze plays the best villain this side of Anton Chugur in ""No Country For Old Men"" (his name could easily be changed to Patrick ""Sleazy""), or that the supporting cast are brilliant, one and all. It's Atkinson who steals the show.

Playing a mild-mannered-- no, strike that: a sheepish, wimpy --vicar in a sleepy little English village, Atkinson brings the perfect subtlety to a part that demands an actor who can at once evoke responses of repudiation, sympathy, condescension, and utter love from the audience. He is, in a word, genius. You won't find a trace, not a hint, of Mr. Bean here. What you will find is a kind, gentle, but mind-numbingly naive man of the cloth who has lost his own way. Not with respect to virtue or the Word, but to the ways of marriage and its, shall we say, carnal attractions. Meanwhile, his long-suffering and insatiably horny wife has lost her way too, but absolutely to the virtues of marriage and its carnal attractions.  And that is where the scum bucket golf instructor (Swayze) comes in.  Enter the sweet little old lady, a yapping little dog next door, some mysteriously disappearing neighbors, and a shallow pond behind the vicar's house, and . . . well, I can't give it away now, can I?

Look for the scene where Atkinson's vicar and his wife prepare to go to bed at night, just as they always do. Only this time, he sees her in a new and beautiful way, through new eyes, thanks to the The Song of Soloman and a gorgeous score underneath the close-ups. Perhaps one of the most touching cinematic scenes I have ever watched . . . and a must, in my humble opinion, for every married couple to see.",1313798400,3,2313,4.588377723970944

Along comes a new nanny one day named Grace. Grace, despite her soft and gentle ways holds a dark past and a family secret.

Nanny Grace sets about bringing the family back together, rescuing the wife from embarking on an affair with the golf pro, the son from the hands of school bullies, the father from losing his family and the daughter from one after another bad attitude boyfriends. Problem is, the nanny's methods are, at best, a little unorthodox.

It's wonderful dark comedy that has you smirking when you really shouldn't be but hey, it's funny. The setting is perfect, the rolling country side of rural England where lies the small village of ""Little Wallop"".

Kristin Scott Thomas is awesome as the mother of the family. Rowan Atkinson plays his part so well as the father and vicar and Maggie Smith's acting is, as always, timeless. Patrick Swayze pulls off a great role as the golf pro and it's sad to think of him now gone.

2504540,5,B000E6TVSC,"The tiny English hamlet of Little Wallop (Pop. 57) has its problems. Deaf Mr. Brown's dog never stops barking. Ancient Mrs. Parker suspects there is a conspiracy afoot  in the church Flower Arranging Committee to overturn her leadership. The local football club is so desperate to field a team to compete with the neighboring village that it has placed the entirely unathletic church vicar between the goal posts. Nasty algae have invaded the pond behind the vicar's house that have baffled local health authorities and turned the pond, like Little Wallop itself, into a murky uninviting stew whose continued existence is questionable.
  The swirling tensions in the tired little town are lost on earnest, well-meaning and distracted Reverend Goodfellow whose serious mind is absorbed by the challenge of composing the speech he must deliver to a convention of religious colleagues on the subject of ""God's Mysterious Ways"". He is unaware that his exasperated, sex-starved wife, exhausted by the sleepless nights caused by Mr. Brown's dog, is about to run away to Mexico with a panting American golf pro, or that his over-ripe daughter is a nympho who will couple with any boy registering a pulse, or that his adolescent son is daily tormented by school bullies.
  The situation looks hopelessly clogged until the arrival of Grace, the Goodfellows' new housekeeper, a protective, practical, problem-solving, paroled murderer.
  ""Keeping Mum"" puts the lie to the lament that there are few good film roles for women or elderly actors. The British seem to have no trouble finding supple scripts to keep their seniors in front of the camera. Octogenarian Liz Smith is the paranoid Mrs. Parker and septuagenarian Maggie Smith is sharp and clear-eyed as the homicidal housekeeper who keeps finding uses for the dark pond behind the house. A buttoned-down Rowan Atkinson and a feverish Kristin Scott Thomas are the preoccupied reverend and his at-wit's-end wife. Patrick Swayze is suitably creepy as the lecherous American.

I didn't know what to expect from this movie and was puzzled in the beginning but ended up liking it.  It's a dark comedy that's exceedingly dry and subtle, more sinister than comedic, and very British in tone.

The infantile fantasy of resolving troubling characters by killing them is carried off by the goggle-eyed Maggie Smith. Rowan Atkinson is the subdued and uninspired vicar, rendered all the more potently comic by limited opportunities for 'Beanerismic' behaviour; once with gangling limbs akimbo as goalie in a local soccer match. Again, with a brain fade in the 'pulpit' at a theological convention. Patrick Swayze is the randy sleeze setting upon the vicar's wife and daughter.

2504583,4,B000E6TVSC,"Keeping Mum is a 2005 comedy/crime/thriller/family drama/mystery but first and foremost, a British black comedy at its finest, subtle and the bizarre that stars Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, Rowan Atkinson, and Patrick Swayze. It is full of surprises, twists, and un-expected revelations. It's got sex, murders, and violence but they are handled in such hilariously proper way that I was amused and entertained all along. Among plenty of surprises, I'd love to mention two first. Rowan Atkinson has turned by the other side of his talent. His vicar Walter Goodfellow is a true good fellow, a nice quiet man who is so overwhelmed by demands of his job that and he fails to recognize some troubling realities in his own family. His wife Gloria (Kristin Scott Thomas) is sexually frustrated, and starts an affair with her American golf instructor (Patrick Swayze) who is also drooling over Gloria and Walter's stunningly beautiful teenage daughter Holy ( In 2007, Tamsin Egerton was voted tenth of the one hundred most beautiful faces in the world, by IndependentCritics.com. - I can't agree more. She was another surprise in the movie). Holy is a bit too eager to explore her sexuality with a new boyfriend every week. The couple's pre-teen son Petye is a target of a group of bullies at school. Enters new housekeeper, amazing Grace Hawkins (Dame Maggie Smith), efficient, charming, and extraordinary loyal to Goodfellows and their wellbeing. She brings with her a huge trunk full of memories and some clothes, and the life in Goodfellow household will never be the same. Grace certainly knows how to take care of the persistent annoying problems and these who cause them.

Maggie Smith is delightful in every single role I've seen her. Her incomparable ability to bring very unique humor, depth, and mannerism into her performances make her deservingly one of the best British actresses in history. Just watch Smith delivering the lines that she makes devilishly funny and incredibly amusing. Smith has been supported by very able cast. The story combines several genres interestingly enough for me to recommend this movie highly. But you have to be a fan of British comedies and British dry black humor and not to be offended by murders and adulteries as the subjects of a comedy.

I did not know anything about the movie until my mom rented it from our local library (I love our library - the source of little known but often very enjoyable movies free of charge) and recommended it to me. It was a very nice surprise - just as it was for the viewers at 2006 U.S. Comedy Arts Festival where Keeping Mum received Film Discovery Jury Award.",1241481600,3,2646,4.904017857142857

2504650,4,B000E6TVSC,"If you shy away from this movie because it has Rowen Atkins in it, and you're afraid it's a stupid, slapstick comedy, think again!  His role in this movie is very sedate, and very charming.  I think he's the best (though perhaps not the most interesting) character in the movie.

It's hard to sum up this movie succinctly - it has a lot of little quirks and interesting side-bits that keep you very entertained.  Very much a black comedy, those of a very sensitive nature may be offended by the flippant attitude towards murder and the adultery (I know many people who are very offended by this portrayed as anything but evil and punishable by death, and if you're one of those this movie is not for you!).  It's also not for those who need prat falls and physical humor - I wouldn't call this a 'laugh-out-loud' movie, more of a quiet chuckle and an 'oh-ho!' type.

Everything about this movie is subtle and subdued, and many may find it boring and slow.  But if you like a good, somewhat offbeat character study, I think you'll enjoy this movie quite a bit.  There's a twist at the end that is a bit predictable, but I'm not so sure it's meant to be as much a surprise and the logical conclusion the plot has led you to.

It's not gory or gratuitous in any fashion (seeing Swayze in a shiny pair of underwear notwithstanding) and reminds me of Ballykissangel with a dollop of Dexter.  I recommend it to people who like British comedy, subtly, and the bizarre.",1225238400,3,1461,4.458646616541353

2504654,4,B000E6TVSC,"Keeping Mum is the nice quiet story of Reverend Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson) and his totally dysfunctional family.  Reverend Goodfellow is absorbed in the community, sacrificing his family for the community.  Gloria Goodfellow (Kristin Scott Thomas) is the reverends wife and is totally frustrated that her husband is absorbed in his work; so much that she's taking up golf and has a sleazy golf instructor (Patrick Swayze).  Reverend Goodfellow's kids, Holly and Petey are almost cut from the Kelly and Bud Bundy mold; the young tramp and the young dweb whom everyone picks on.  To help this family correct itself a housekeeper is brought in (Grace, played by Maggie Smith) with a little bit of a background, she kind of murdered her husband and his lover when she a young twenty something bride.

My Likes:
The characters are so strong in this one and how couldn't they be with this cast.  Rowan Atkinson is on top of his game.  This is no Mr. Bean or Blackadder.  Instead this is more like an older Father Gerald (Four Weddings and a Funeral) who's married and settled in the country.  Rowan Atkinson sells the reverend who's forgotten his family for his job so well.  Equally of interest is how well we see Reverend Goodfellow learn about his family and religion with humor from Grace.
Maggie Smith is outstanding as Grace.  She enables family see their problems and come together so well.  Of particular interest is the length's she'll go to keep the family together.  After all, it's hard to get over old habits...
Patrick Swayze sells the greasy American golf pro that's trying to take advantage of his female students so well!  He uses sexual innuendos, pressure, promises, and a humorous male G-string.  It's almost as if he was born for the role.
Kristin Scott Thomas does and excellent job playing the wife who's tired of her husband ignoring her for work.  She doesn't want to have an affair, but it seems to be the only way she'll have attention paid to her and maybe get rid of the annoying neighbors and the dog that yaps.

My Dislikes:
  The movie is generally very strong.  Two slight weaknesses are that Kristin doesn't seem fully engaged in parts of the movie and Petey is sort of cleaned up and left out of the back half.  In Kristin's case I interrupt the lack of engagement to be because she's bored with her husband and wants some spice.

The Rating:
A very solid 4 star movie (going toward 5 stars!).  The plot is fun and engrossing.  The humor is a chuckler, not a belly-roarer.  Things have been nicely cut together to make this a nice cosy for people to enjoy on a quiet night.  The actors come across as real people, no one person totally dominating the scene; however the two main ones are Gloria learning about her family and Grace helping her and the family.  There are several nice surprises that are pulled out of the steamer trunk that make for an excellent show that's entertaining.  Sexual content is medium; there are several scenes' where sex is implied and/or a body part is seen.  No matter, this is an excellent black comedy.",1219536000,6,3065,4.676635514018692

2504679,4,B000E6TVSC,"This is the question raised by the film KEEPING MUM.  Amazingly, this is a wonderful, sweet, romantic and funny film. We are treated to Rowan Atkinson in a surprising and sensitive lead performance.  He is so much more than Edmund Blackadder, Inspector Raymond Fowler or Mr. Bean here. As much as we may love those other characters, his performance here can make us forget they ever existed. He plays the Reverend Walter Goodfellow who is a tad on the dull, passionless side. That is until the arrival of the mysterious and charming Grace who is the families' new housekeeper. Grace hunkers down and works to repair this family who's lost it's way.

Richard Russo and Niall Johnson have crafted a completely captivating script. It's fascinating that a film with so many murders can be so gentle. Maggie Smith is a pure delight as Grace, a woman who has an interesting past, could there be a connection here?

Clarence, the little dog next door has been yelling nonstop for days and the deaf old man who owns him, can't hear and doesn't seem to care.  Walter (Atkinson) her vicar husband, has forgotten there's romance in the ""Bible"" and he's so lost in his tending his congregation, he's even lost his sense of humor.

Grace quickly sets to work setting things to rights.  On the surface, she's quite an endearing old lady who soothes with a cup of tea and a magic word, but her methods run far deeper than that--just don't look in the nearby pond!

Some other reviews did a great job of describing it.  It's like Mary Poppins kicked up a notch (a naughty notch, but a notch none the less).

Normally, I find British comedy to be a bit on the on the slow side, but this movie seemed to flow okay.  I enjoyed all the actors and actresses (I'm even interested in seeing a ""Mr Bean"" film now).  I was surprised to see Patrick Swayze, though, since he is American.

2504686,4,B000E6TVSC,"It took me a while to discover this little gem of a dark comedy but it was a truly worthwhile wait. The movie begins with a young pregnant woman aboard a train in some part of England who also happens to be hiding something else in the trunk she brings along on the journey. Well, not to give too much away, she ends up incarcerated in an institution and fast forward years later to the tiny village of Little Wallop [population 57]. There's a steadfast vicar [played by Rowan Atkinson], his unsatisfied wife Gloria Goodfellow[Kristin Scott Thomas playing an uncharacteristic frumpy housewife], his teen nymphomaniac daughter Holly [Tamsin Egerton], and his young son Petey [Toby Parkes] who is prone to being bullied at school. There's also a golf instructor [Patrick Swayze] who is only too willing to provide 'comfort' to Gloria.

Enter housekeeper Grace Hawkins [Dame Maggie Smith] who literally appears out of the blue but very quickly charms her way into the family and very efficiently takes care of each family member's problems, literally 'dispatching' the annoyances in a quick manner.

The standout performance here is definitely Dame Maggie Smith's homicidal housekeeper. She is so lovable in her role that you actually empathise with her and find her victims the true annoyances that they are! Kristin Scott Thomas' jaded and sexually unsatisfied housewife is also very credible as she indulges in little sexual escapades with her golf instructor whilst still finding herself in love with her humorless husband. Patrick Swayze's Lance the sleaze is very much in character as he not only lusts after the viacr's wife, but has lecherous intentions towards young Holly as well. Rowan Atkinson, though in a minor role here, plays the hapless and boring vicar very well, with his reading of the Song of Solomon being the highlight of his performance here [it even got me a bit hot under the collar!].

2504688,4,B000E6TVSC,"The 2005 dark British comedy ""Keeping Mum"", directed by Niall Johnson, is the strange tale indeed: the wife of Vicar Walter Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson), named Gloria Goodfellow (Kristin Scott Thomas), is not particularly happy with her marriage.  Being swooned by her professional, American golf instructor, the sleezy Lance (Patrick Swayze), Gloria considers running away with him while her teenage daughter Holly (Tamsin Egerton) has more temporary boyfriends than she or her husband can remember and her son Peter (Toby Parkes) is being tormented by a group of bullies at school.  Things begin to change, though, with the arrival of their new nanny, Grace Hawkins (the incomparable Maggie Smith), who travels with a large, old trunk.  The contents of the mysterious trunk has little in common with the belongings that Mary Poppins or Nanny McPhee traveled with, but Grace does have some unusual abilities that (unlike Mary Poppins or Nanny McPhee) don't involve any magic.  One day, the old neighbor's dog and its annoying & incessant barking mysteriously disappear; the bullies at school receive an unhappy surprise; and Lance stops answering his phone.  How can this be?  Grace helps the Vicar find his lost humor and get an entirely new view of the ""Song of Solomon"".  Everything seems to be going quite well until, one evening, Holly sees a bizarre story on the news about a recently released convict named Rosie Jones (Emilia Fox) who served 40 years in prison for two brutal murders and an old trunk.

With excellent acting, an intriguing story and engaging characters, ""Keeping Mum"" is very entertaining and well-done film. No doubt Maggie Smith very much enjoyed portraying Grace after playing Professor McGonagall in five (to date) Harry Potter films and many may remember Kristin Scott Thomas from her role in the 1996 film ""The English Patient"" that earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.

2504723,3,B000E6TVSC,"The housekeeper who shows up at the home of this British clergyman's family has a mysterious ability to put everything right. She puts a spring in everyone's step. She lightens the way for the clergyman to inject some humor into his sermons. She erases the sullen rebelliousness of the teenage daughter. Her presence averts a flirtation that was on the verge of turning into an actual adultery that would have destroyed the family. She awakens husband and wife to each other again romantically.

But all these good things come at what price? The body count begins to climb, and other people get in on the act - doing good by doing bad.

I didn't get any real guffaws from this movie. The British do have a fine tradition of making light of a little judicious homicide. Classic examples of this genre include the hilarious ""Naked Truth"" starring Peter Sellers and Terry-Thomas, and  ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" starring Alec Guinness. This film isn't in that class. Perhaps part of the problem here is that some of the deaths are undeserved and almost incidental. It's hard to laugh at the deaths of virtual passersby.

Still, this movie will bring a glow and a smile. Rowan Atkinson is wonderful as the clergyman who is opened up to life's possibilities. He has a few scenes that evoke his old Mr. Bean buffoonery. But for the most part, he displays a broad range of subtle, very human longings. His rekindled interest in his wife is reminiscent of the magic that transforms the couples in ""Enchanted April,"" the memorable romance starring Joan Plowright and Jim Broadbent.

So the nature of the mayhem here might muffle some of the potential laughs. Still, this film does leave us with a hopefulness that things may yet be set right in our worlds, and that we can live the essential decency of a green and rosy English village.",1192233600,4,1827,4.732704402515723

With the possible exception of Rowan Atkinson's character, the viewer is not inspired to care much about the main players of the story. I was more concerned about the unwitting neighbor and his dog. Animal lovers such as myself will not be pleased with the outcome. I can take a joke but this one is pretty lame.

2504762,4,B000E6TVSC,"Keeping Mum is a charmingly sweet story cleverly wrapped in a black comedy, with a dark plot about murder and strong undertones of family love and responsibility. Director and screenwriter Niall Johnson manages to pull it all together in a delightful way that will leave most audience members glad they watched, especially once they realize the pun in the title.
The film starts out 43 years ago on a train. We're introduced to Rosie Jones (a charming Emilia Fox), a smiling, gentle, very pregnant young lady... with a trunk in the train's storage compartment that is seeping blood. When she's turned in to the by the police by a suspicious porter she freely admits that her husband and his lover, or at least the remaining pieces of them, are in the trunk. When one officer asks why she did it, she casually responds ""Well, I couldn't very well sit idly by, could I?"" Cut to a courtroom where a judge locks her away in an insane asylum.

The audience is then introduced to the Goodfellow family (present day) and the rural English village of Little Wallop. Walter Goodfellow, the town vicar (subtly played by Rowan Atkinson of Mr. Bean fame), is so caught up in his sermons and the nagging members of his congregation that his home life is slipping away from him. His wife Gloria (the brilliant Kristin Scott Thomas) is having an affair with her golf instructor (Patrick Swayze in a hilarious role that feels like it was written just for him), his daughter Holly is coming home with a different boyfriend every other day, and his son is getting bullied at school. Enter Grace Hawkins.

Maggie Smith enters the scene as a renamed, aged Rosie Jones, who believes the best way to solve your problems is to get rid of them, literally. In a slightly twisted, darkly hilarious version of Mary Poppins, Maggie Smith comes to the Goodfellow family as a maid and nanny and in her own way starts to straighten things up. Her antics may be a tad outlandish, but in their own strange way, they're just what the Goodfellow family needs: a touch of Grace.

The acting is top knotch, the humor is decidedly British and dark, and every joke delivers. Patrick Swayze really stands out in a cast of Brits as the libidinized Texas golf instructor trying to seduce the vicar's wife and spy on the vicar's daughter. Throwing himself into the role with reckless abandon shows Swayze's comedic timing and adds an extra layer to the British humor.

The DVD includes several special features, including feature commentary by the director, a rather dry blooper reel, quite a few deleted scenes (I mean ""bonus"" scenes), and an extended scene of Rowan Atkinson as a soccer goalie that may be the funniest part of the DVD. Keeping Mum is an all around great experience.",1180483200,2,2741,4.704166666666667
2504763,4,B000E6TVSC,"I happen to be a big fan of British comedies, even though I'm American.  I rented ""Keeping Mum"" because I enjoy Rowan Atkinson's performances, and even though he's not really the central character in this movie, he does a fine job -- as do all the actors.  Indeed, the casting is just about perfect.

The movie manages to make light of a number of basically grim topics - most notably murder - and it's definitely not for the kiddies. But if you like wry humor, and aren't put off by swearing, partial nudity, and a lot of violence (mostly off-screen) then ""Keeping Mum"" will tickle your fancy.",1180224000,3,594,4.5327102803738315

Lucky for everyone, into this mix there comes a new housekeeper aptly named Grace. Grace sees and understands all. She takes drastic measures to fix everyone, partly because in a nice plot twist she has some baggage of her own to unburden.

Grace the new housekeeper, that is. However, this housekeeper's methods of cleaning house isn't exactly what the pastor, or the law, would approve of. Their elderly savior, who seems very sweet and harmless on the outside, has more than a few secrets in her past...and present.

Not that Dame Maggie has ever taken a part and let it rest on her well-deserve laurels, even at Hogwart's she manages to hold her own with Alan Rickman, a notorius scene stealer.

Rowan Atkinson is for a change pleasent. The Stooge-like slapstick of his other performances is gone and a well measured thoughtful character is there in its place.

He was egged on by the nanny character, Grace, played by Maggie Smith (unbeknownst to him, his mother-in-law). And don't we all need a cheerful maniacal killer to straighten out the everyday dilemmas of life?

""Keeping Mum"" is more than a play on words. It is an old-fashioned farce, a 'romp' . . .  or black comedy:  your choice.  A parsonage family is tying itself in knots when Maggie Smith arrives & brings order to the bullied son, the sex-crazed daughter, tongue-tied preacher and his straying wife.  Patrick Swayze, who looks somewhat 'over the hill' following his lively dancing career (in ""Dirty Dancing"") plays a peeping Tom-golf instructor, and Grace manages to stick it to him, also.

Maggie Smith is Reviewer mcHAIKU's reason for watching (perhaps in this instance carrying loyalty to an extreme).  On the other hand we know that even Maggie Smith (Order of the British Empire) must pay her bills, and the husband of THIS household raised the laugh meter to more than four stars.

2504816,5,B000E6TVSC,"Regrettably this was the last film appearance of James Booth, very memorable as Private Henry Hook in 1964's ZULU. Yet un-regrettably KEEPING MUM was quite a surprise in more ways than one. I managed to find a theater that was actually showing it several months back. I was certainly not disappointed and in fact was quite surprised how good this little film was. It is a black comedy in the best sense as only the British can concoct. What makes it stand apart from the ordinary is its witty screenplay by Richard Russo and Niall Johnson, Gavin Finney's beautiful cinematography and very good performances from Rowan Atkinson, Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas and an unlikely Patrick Swayze. This film is a wonderful and curious melding of the dark side of human emotions with expressions of true and meaningful love and the potential we all have to love and be loved but find so difficult to express or accept. The beautiful and colorful photography is unusually exquisite and quite moving giving one moments of exhilaration and reflection on what beautiful wonders the world beholds for those that can grasp it and become one with it. Maggie Smith's Mary Poppins-like character is the answer to Rowan Atkinson's uninspired but well intentioned local vicar who cannot really clearly express his theological virtues or the love and passion he has for his wife Kristin Scott Thomas. Maggie Smith takes things into her own hands and helps his family who has more issues than can be imagined. And there it is.",1173052800,3,1509,4.8984375
2504817,4,B000E6TVSC,"KEEPING MUM is a little British pastiche of a film based on a story by Richard Russo and adapted for the screen by Niall Johnson who also directs.  It is one of those little 'comedies' Sir Alec Guinness made endearing, comedy touched with the morbid, but allowing the completed meal to be wholly palatable.

Opening with a note '43 years earlier' we see a charming and attractive young pregnant woman (Emilia Fox) boarding a train somewhere in England, her only odd characteristic is her large trunk which is seeping blood: the trunk contains the bodies of the girl's husband and mistress and she is carted off to detention.

Jump to the present (or 43 years later) and in a little English village the Vicar, Reverend Walter Goodfellow (Rowan Atkinson) tends to his flock and is frustrated with writing a speech for a convention, paying more attention to his clerical duties than to his frustrated wife Gloria (Kristin Scott Thomas), his philandering daughter Holly (the beautiful Tamsin Egerton) and his bullied son Petey (Toby Parkes).  Holly is having an affair with her lothario golf pro Lance (Patrick Swayze) and in general the family is disheveled - until they hire Grace Hawkins (the inimitable Maggie Smith) who takes up residence with them, her only possession being her 'trunk'.

Grace has her own manner of taking care of distasteful issues: she simply eliminates them and throws them in a pond growing algae.  She gradually breaks the news that Holly, an orphan as a child, is the progeny of Grace's pregnancy when she was imprisoned and proceeds to correct the various messes the Goodfellow family has been facing: she peppers the Vicar's sermons with jokes, increasing his congregation and dispenses with the vicar's headache parishioner Mrs. Parker (Liz Smith); she renews the marital fidelity to Gloria and the Vicar, disposing of Lance; she handles the school problems of Petey and the boy problems of Holly. Her trunk ends up being a Pandora's Box for the village and the family!

With a thoroughly delightful cast of pros, settings that are picture perfect, a script that always retains humor even in the most odd circumstances, and a musical score that underlines the flavor of the tale, KEEPING MUM  is a delight to watch. Deep it is not, but it is a warmly funny though strange little movie that is a crowd pleaser.  Grady Harp, February 07",1172361600,8,2363,4.8875
2504818,5,B000E6TVSC,"I absolutely adored this rather understated and very engaging British film.  Everything was just so fun considering it's about a sweet little elderly lady who applies a slightly twisted sense of morality to help a family with domestic problems.  The family is a bit of a mess. Kristin Scott Thomas is the backbone of the story.  She's frustrated with her life, her daughter is a bit of wayward teenager, her son is being bullied and her husband played by Rowan Atkinson is a little boring and a little self-absorbed.  In comes Maggie Smith who plays Grace Hawkins a grandmotherly type who exudes understanding and warmth with her own special brand of helpfulness.  But then again, the way she deals with life's problems is questionable although effective - ""You can't just kill people because you disapprove of them"" to which Grace replies, ""That's what my doctors kept saying. It was the one thing we could never agree on.""

Everything from the dream cast to the clever writing to the charming music sets an overall tone of gentleness with a hint of the sinister.  I particularly enjoyed the music and the locations.  The music is soft and tender but at times, it also has an edge - exactly like the story.  The film is beautifully shot with locations in Cornwall and the Isle of Man.  I really liked the village - its normal and sweet setting is a perfect backdrop to Grace's not normal but still sweet mentality.

Black comedy is a tricky genre of film and the British do it well.  If it's handled with too heavy a hand it can teeter between the uncomfortable and the painful.  Here, the director, writers and actors handled it with just enough of a touch that this film is brilliantly endearing and you just can't help laughing at something you really shouldn't be laughing at.",1172275200,44,1781,4.688102893890675
