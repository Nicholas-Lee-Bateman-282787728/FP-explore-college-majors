8603271,1,B0020MMSFQ,"I'm a huge Lebron James fan and I just purchased this DVD thinking that it would be a classic highlight reel of his plays and dunks. Instead all I received was the first 12 minutes of an actual ""60 Minutes"" show featuring Lebron. The picture on the DVD case looks like someone printed it off of their printer. The actual footage was good but it was just a small portion of a pre-recorded show. I feel hustled because I paid 15.99 just to watch 12 minutes of ""60 Minutes"". I could've recorded this on my DVR machine and saved me the money. Whoever is selling this DVD ought to be ashamed of themselves. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD or you'll pay the price just like I did.",1269907200,4,662,4.2204724409448815
