7920292,5,B00004CMEF,"Story of a young girl who grows up and falls in love with a Mafia hitman who she doesn't know is the one who had accidently murdered her father during a botched hit.  She marries him after becoming pregnant only to shoot him at the wedding when a jealous son of the mafia boss tells her that her new husband had murdered her father.  If you loved this miniseries as much as I did and want it on DVD, look for it under the titles Bride of Violence 1 & Bride of Violence 2.  It has only been released full length on DVD in the Netherlands under the alternate title.  Keep in mind that this is a region 2 DVD (PAL) and will only play on a region 2 dvd player or a multi-region dvd player.  I got one here on amazon for less than $40.",1284940800,4,730,3.9726027397260273
