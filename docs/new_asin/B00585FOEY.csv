8461280,5,B00585FOEY,"I was introduced to Chris Everard's films about 2 years ago and ever since I've been addicted. I've watched every film he has made so far. Superstate covers a lot of topics, some of the most interesting being military robotic technologies. Chris has managed to dig up video of some machines I had only heard talked about such as the robot that picks up dead bodies on the battle field and uses them for energy. There is definitely some fascinating and crazy things covered in this film.

For those that don't know, Chris makes films that, to a large extent, deal with the the Illuminati and their plan for global domination, hence the title Superstate. Another point I would like to make about Mr. Everard's films is that they are always very well presented using great imagery and soundtracks. Also a note to Chris if he happens to read this; I would really love it if you contacted Alex Jones about doing an interview. It would be great to hear and also great for opening your work up to many who know nothing about you yet.",1319673600,,1026,4.516129032258065
8461281,5,B00585FOEY,I've seen the European edition of this film. This movie completely explains the New World Order and the Great Work of Ages. This film also explains what is happening with robots and their use in warfare. This film should be important to anyone who is concerned with the state of the world right now. A very important film!!!!!!,1308960000,,327,4.655172413793103
