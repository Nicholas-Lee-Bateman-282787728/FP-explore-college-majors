3744215,2,B001P9N9BM,"Interesting for an adult, although I bought it for our Grandson. The pace was slow although interesting to watch. I suggest it for a fun gift not for a young child.",1389052800,,164,4.32258064516129
3744216,5,B001P9N9BM,"I am a longtime heavy equipment junkie and I have been a HARD CORE fan of Fred Levine's series. This is a MUST HAVE for ANY Fred Levine fan who have been dying to see something that follows up to an original program and I for one really ENJOY this. It never gets old to see heavy equipment, call you blasting, and interesting narration from a friendly host.",1386547200,,357,4.264705882352941
3744217,5,B001P9N9BM,"Any time you can keep a 1 1/2 year old entertained for more than 5 minutes, it is an accomplishment.  This video does that and it is also interesting for the adults as well.  We usually watch it with him and enjoy his ohs an ahas as he watches the big equipment do their work.  Especially interesting is the big tree cutter/stacker.",1364774400,,332,4.32258064516129

8332635,5,B001P9N9BM,"My 5-year-old grandson learned so much from this video that I ordered the entire set of 10 videos! He watched it over and over--and it even helped with his vocabulary! One day he asked me what ""mesmerized"" meant, because that word was used in the video. He now uses that word frequently!",1509062400,,287,4.538461538461538
8332636,5,B001P9N9BM,"Great show for the child who loves construction equipment, though not as good as the first one, in my humble opinion.",1503446400,,117,4.619047619047619

8332639,2,B001P9N9BM,"We have all of the Little Hard Hats videos, and my boys love them.  This one I am not a fan of, mostly because the ""musical score"" that is playing throughout the video is practically heavy metal.  The other videos have tolerable music in the background, but who wants to have their kid listen to 40 minutes of some guy wailing away on the electric guitar?  I think I'll erase this one from my video library.",1445385600,,407,4.328947368421052

8332642,3,B001P9N9BM,"I have watched this video with my 4 year old son. It does have a lot of information from start to finish. The video is a little slower and a little more low key then something like mighty machines. It is a good bedtime video because it is not that long, and is actually calming to watch.",1441756800,,287,4.052631578947368
