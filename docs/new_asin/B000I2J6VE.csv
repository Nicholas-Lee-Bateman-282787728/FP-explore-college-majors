2651729,4,B000I2J6VE,"The first five seasons of ""The Golden Girls"" were as good as it gets. The show had great writing, solid directing, and (most importantly) terrific comic acting by its quartet of veteran actresses. After the original writing team left after Season Four, a new writing team came on for Season Five to keep the laughs coming. For the most part they succeeded in keeping ""The Golden Girls"" a very funny show throughout the fifth season, although it wasn't quite up there with seasons 1 thru 4. Still Season Five was close to matching the greatness of the first four seasons. The show's main director, Terry Hughes, was still on board directing almost all the episodes for the fifth season, which I think continued to help keep it a first rate sitcom. But Hughes decided to leave after Season Five, and that eventually hurt ""The Golden Girls"" a little bit afterwards. Season Six is proof.

SEASON SIX (1990-91)

There's no doubt, Season Six of ""The Golden Girls"" is still pretty funny. Many of the episodes have a lot of big laughs, they're for the most part well written, and all four actresses continued to do a great job as they have done since the show first went on the air in 1985. But as I watched the episodes throughout the sixth season when they first aired, I could feel that the show was starting to get a little tiresome. This is common with most shows that run for a long time. I imagine that it's hard to keep a long-running show (whether it's comedy or drama) fresh for its entire run. While the sixth season of ""The Golden Girls"" made me laugh quite often, it didn't make me laugh nearly as much as the first five seasons did. There were a couple of episodes in Season Six that (at least for me) fell flat and weren't as funny as they should have been. The departure of director Terry Hughes was a huge bump in the road for the show. Beatrice Arthur, Betty White, Rue McClanahan, and Estelle Getty worked closely with Hughes while he was at the helm during its first five seasons, and for Season Six (as well as Season Seven) the actresses had to go on with life without him. It was a big loss for ""The Golden Girls"", because Hughes was a great TV sitcom director, one of the best in television. ""The Golden Girls"" directors for Season Six were not up there in the same league as Hughes, and in several episodes it showed. They did a good job directing the episodes, though nowhere near as good of a job as Hughes did.

On the bright side, there are many episodes from the sixth season of ""The Golden Girls"" that are top-notch and well worth watching again. Some of these include: Blanche's daughter coming to Miami to have her baby; Dorothy coming under fire at school when she refuses to pass a star football player who's failing her class, while at the same time Rose thinks that her dentist might be making sexual advances towards her; Sophia becoming a nun and the Mother Superior wanting desperately to get rid of her; Sophia coping with the death of her son while at the same time goes into a war of words with his widow; Blanche's gay brother coming to visit and bringing along with him a big surprise; Dorothy going out on a date with a man she agreed to go out with back in high school and whom at the time she thought dumped her, only to her shock when she finds out that Sophia played a role in driving the guy away; and Blanche dating a disabled man confined to a wheelchair. In addition there were two memorable storylines that played out during Season Six. One storyline involved the continuing relationship between Rose and Miles, and things getting wild when Miles reveals his actual identity. The other storyline revolved around Dorothy's steamy relationship with her ex-husband Stan and then agreeing to marry him again, this after he proposes to her by putting the engagement ring in her baked potato! (Now that's original!)

Even though the sixth season of ""The Golden Girls"" wasn't up to the level of the five previous seasons, the show continued to get Emmy recognition. For Season Six, it received six Emmy nominations, including its sixth straight nomination for Best Comedy Series, while Betty White and Estelle Getty were once again nominated for Best Lead Actress and Best Supporting Actress. Getty should have won for this season, especially for her performance in the episode ""Ebbtide's Revenge"". This is the one where Sophia deals with the death of her son Phil, and Getty's performance in this episode was powerful. Not only is Getty funny (as usual), she also gets to show off a serious side that was rarely seen from her on ""The Golden Girls"". Watch how this episode ends and you'll see what I mean. Another Emmy nomination for Season Six went to Brenda Vaccaro, for her guest appearance in this same episode as Sophia's daughter-in-law (and Phil's wife) Angela, who was also coping with the sudden loss as well as trying to make peace with Sophia.

Other memorable guest stars from Season Six include: Hal Linden (""Barney Miller"") as the man Dorothy goes out with, with whom she thought had dumped her back in high school; Cesar Romero (""Batman"" - The TV series) as Sophia's new love interest; the late comedian Alan King as Mel Bushman, Blanche's on and off lover; Sonny Bono (""The Sony and Cher Show"") and Lyle Waggoner (""The Carol Burnett Show"") as themselves who both vie for the affection of Dorothy; Debbie Reynolds (""Mother"") as a potential new roommate; Alan Rachins (""L.A. Law"") as a man Blanche tries to land by making him think that her new granddaughter is actually her own child; Martin Mull (""Roseanne"") as an aging hippie shut-in that Dorothy tries to persuade to come out of his apartment and go out into the real world; and the late great Oscar winner Don Ameche (""Cocoon"") as Rose's biological father.

There's still a lot to like about ""The Golden Girls"": The Complete Sixth Season, and it'll be worth seeing these episodes again.

NOTE: Marc Cherry, creator of the smash series ""Desperate Housewives"", was a writer and story editor of the sixth season of ""The Golden Girls"". Cherry got his writing start with this show midway through the fifth season, and would stay on until the end of the show's run in 1992 (he was promoted to producer for the seventh season). He continued as a writer/producer for ""The Golden Girls"" sequel show ""The Golden Palace"", which lasted one season.",1158710400,20,6345,4.644701691896706

Luckily officer Barbara Weston has a gun and is able to apprehend a gory predicament the girls have gotten themselves into.

2652111,5,B000I2J6VE,The Golden Girls was and still is a wonderful TV show. The dialog is the thing that stands out the most. Some TV shows have dumb things happen just to get a laugh that is only funny once and you never care to see the episode again. The Golden Girls don't need someone tripping and falling and some lame physical comedy to sell the show. 20 years later the jokes and writing is still fresh. The jokes are still funny!

2652129,5,B000I2J6VE,"After five seasons, the pattern remains the same, but rather than becoming formulaic, ""The Golden Girls"" continue to delight viewers thanks to the excellent writing and the brilliant comedic ensemble. Dorothy, Sophia, Blanche and Rose have weathered many a storm, and by Season 6, they - and we - are ready for whatever life throws their way, from Blanche's dating crises, to Dorothy's on-again, off-again relationship with Stan. The girls continue to be dumbfounded by Rose's quirky life in St. Olaf's, and Sophia (and some of her relatives from Sicily) provide a zany dose of sound advice wrapped up in hilarity. The stand-out actress in this penultimate season is Bea Arthur, whose husky voice, slow double-take and deadpan delivery is the foundation that makes the over-the-top antics of Betty White, Estelle Getty and Rue McLanahan sparkle. Highly recommended for devotees of great casting and classic TV comedy.",1396396800,,917,5.244897959183674

2652286,5,B000I2J6VE,"Some Golden Girls fans consider the fifth season (1989-90) the last of the good seasons because things became jumbled with new production teams being brought in for the last seasons but season six more than holds it's own with the proceeding five. With such great moments as Blanche delivering her granddaughter and then using said granddaughter to try and land a man who mistakenly thinks Blanche is its mother. Martin Mull playing a reclusive man Dorothy reaches out to while helping Sophia with her Meals on Wheels program with hilarious results. Also Blanche finds out her long lost Mammy had an affair with her deceased father in ""Wham Bam Thank You Mammy."" Rose meets her father who much to everyone's surprise is in fact an earthling in the episode ""Once in Saint Olaf"" and his choice to remain with god instead of having a relationship with his child causes confliction and some anger for Rose.

Midseason contains one of Sophia's rare emotional moments in the episode entitled Ebbtide's Revenge in which Sophia's son Phil passes away and Sophia goes through a myriad of emotions and anger over Phil deciding to live life as a cross-dresser, which has led Sophia to face much guilt and potential shame over the years. Sophia has many golden comedy moments highlighted by Sophia joining a convent following the death of her nun friend and Stand by Your Man where Sophia plays Blanche's grandmother on a date with a disabled man including a hilarious southern accent.",1276041600,,1473,4.892

2652310,5,B000I2J6VE,"To many ardent ""Golden Girls"" fans the sixth season is the one in which the series ""jumped the shark"" in that the show changed both in story content and direction. Gone since the end of the fourth season were the show's wonderful writers and at the end of the fifth season beloved director Terry Hughes decided to hang up his dirctor's hat and do feature films. The absence of those two important ingredients are evident in this 26 episode boxset. The stories just weren't as funny as in previous years and the cast, most notably Bea Arthur, seemed to be running through their scenes. The sixth season is alright in terms of good sitcom work, but after viewing these shows the shine was off the gold so to speak. Buy this season to finish off your ""Golden Girls"" collection, but if your looking to purchase excellent ""Golden Girls"" shows pick up the first four seasons. The only bonus in this set is a minor interview with Betty white, Rue McClanahan, and others discussing the series. The series finished at #10 for the year.",1249948800,3,1026,4.612021857923497

With this television show you can't tell one season from the next because of the great acting from these women and the story lines.  I definitely love season 1-5, the sixth season was just as good.  My favorite one is when Blanche is dating a guy who is verbally abusive towards her and with the help of Dorothy friendship. She finds a way out. and the rest of the shows are just as great.

2652317,4,B000I2J6VE,This show has comedy but also handles many issues in society. It is superior to most of the current situation comedies because it often presents a problem and then has the characters attempt to solve it. I am sick and tired of the totally disfunctional characters and families of current shows.  There has been  a constant deterioration of television for years. This is quality comedy and worth viewing by young people as well as those of us who viewed it when it was first aired. Some of these shows really make you think.,1231632000,2,523,4.612903225806452

There are very few TV shows today that I bother with. Most of them deal with getting others before they can get you, so called reality shows, and/or are just plain filthy.

My fave episodes from this season are Snap Out of It, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun...Before They Die!, and Sister of the Bride.

Their timing is great, as are the storylines (especially Phil's death.  I WISH that we could have seen Phil during the ""GG's"" run!  Oh well.  I just imagine DIVINE in the role!).

2652339,5,B000I2J6VE,"Back in about 1993--after the series had ended, I started watching this show in reruns. I very quickly became an addict of the ""Girls"". After dreadful attempts to tape them all, I gave up and was thrilled when it came out on DVD. Perfect chemistry between the cast members and the best writing of any TV series ever. To put it simply--it is perfect. I have seen them all many, many times--and still enjoy watching them, and I now have all 7 seasons on DVD. Four dynamic roles, each very different and at the same time very compatible. There are a handfull of serious topics, tossed in from time to time that work well. The wit and it's delivery is spot-on every time. ""Try it--You'll LIKE it!!""",1175990400,5,694,4.47244094488189

Blanche was just hilarious at helping Sophia and Rose with their lovelives. Sophia dressed in red with big hooters was priceless!!! Dorothy made me laugh out loud in the episode when she is reunited with the guy that stood her up on prom night! Hal Linden looked so handsome, which made me think about his classic tv show Barney Miller. I bought the first season as soon as it came out and have been waiting in vain for the remaining seasons!!!

2652379,5,B000I2J6VE,"Broadcast before sitcoms became love-lorn soap operas padded with goofball blowoffs, and often dismissed as a safe and cosy filler of daytime TV schedules The Golden Girls may surprise the unfamiliar viewer. There's a laugh about every twelve seconds and we're not talking wry smiles here - this is genuinely hysterical, with some of the greatest comebacks ever spoken in a three-walled set. The wit is relentlessly savage, the sarcasm is merciless, and the actresses deliver what could be considered a masterclass in comedic timing. It's hard to imagine Rachel calling Monica a 'human mattress' or 'shore leave'. Which is strange because something like that happened to me once, back in St Olaf...",1168473600,,698,5.185840707964601

I recommend this entire 7 (SEVEN) Season set most excitedly and cannot wait for the final seventh Season set to be released.

...then there's the ""GOLDEN PALACE"" to enjoy ... sadly there's only one season of that, but at least we'll always have that to remember three of the ""girls"" by.",1168387200,,526,4.898876404494382

2652396,5,B000I2J6VE,"If you are a Golden Girl's Fan, you cannot go wrong with this DVD.

This particular season's DVD has a Bonus Feature that is far better than the prior DVD's.  At the end of the DVD is a nice conversation with Betty White, Rue McLanahan and some of their genius writers. This was particularly interesting to see how they act ""outside of the character"".

Interestingly enough, Estelle Ghetty was not included. I think she must be in progressively bad health according to Lifetime. Bea Arthur is not included either. She must be in bad shape lately.

Anyway, sone of my favorite episodes included in this Season Six DVD were:

The one where Blanche's Mammy comes back, the one where the girls put on ""Henny Penny"" for the kids, and finally the episode where Blanche helps Sofia with a makeover and some advice to spark her dating life.

I would reccommend the DVD to any GG Fan.",1168300800,,875,4.576923076923077

Season 6 is no different.  From the first episode to the last it's hilarious.  I'm not going to break down each and every episode as some of the reviews did.  If you have seen any of the other seasons or episodes then you will certinately enjoy this season.  I can't wait until February until the 7th and final season comes out.
