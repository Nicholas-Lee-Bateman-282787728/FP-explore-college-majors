8473560,5,B00008V6YA,"A fantastic piece of cinema, very rare in your stereotypical Bollywood offerings. The plot is quite simplified, film starts off at a normal pace with normal situations around but then takes on a real wild ride that will grab the attention of your entire soul to the film. Kamal Hassan at his very best indeed, his performance as the father-son duo that is something which is unforgettable. A brilliant direction from Shankar and a truely strong cast performance makes this film worth watching. Trust me, it's a film that comes once in a lifetime.",1318723200,,546,4.819148936170213
8473561,5,B00008V6YA,"The movie is an epic that covers many genres, stories and issues like many Indian entertainment films, but far more ambitious than any other movie did before. It's about the historical and very blood-shedding War of the Indians against the Whites (no Gandhi-refuses-to-eat-and-everybody-puts-his-gun-down-silliness, sadly!), the moving love of a Father to his daughter, the big issue of corruption throughout the country, the conflict between a righteous father and a corrupt son and some subplots like a sweet ""triangle"" romance, moments of comedy and more, all mixed up in a big crime investigation full of action and suspense.
In the end, INDIAN isn't a great film, but very good entertainment with elements that make it something special in the flood of Indian exploitation films.",1302220800,,784,5.382113821138211
