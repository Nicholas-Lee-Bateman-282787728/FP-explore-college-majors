1828505,4,B000087F7J,"I recently became a big fan of X-Men from the movie and when Evolution started i thought it was better than the film. I have been a collector of the figures for nearly a year and find some of the reviews on this DVD rubbish.
Episode 1: Growing Pains, this episode is where the Brotherhood try to reveal the identities of the X-Men at the soccer tournament.
Episode 2: Power Surge, this is one of the main stages in Jean's life. Her powers increase rapidly and she can't hold them so the X-Men are left to save the day and a fellow student's future.
Episode 3: Bad-a-bing Bada-Boom:
Another good story line featuring a new recruit's father who attempts to steal the carnival money. Surprisingly stopped by the brotherhood who want Boom-Boom as a new member.
Episode 4:Fun& Games  Mystique returns luring the proffessro out to repair Juggernaut's prison and encourages the X-Men to hold a party giving her and a computer geek access to cerebro whilst she escape's with some mutant data on DVD.
 Episode 4 being the best as the whole action extravaganza except for the cliff hanger ending. What will Mystique do to Boom-Boom when she finds her living in her room. This DVD has extra's such as detail's of X-Men and the brotherhood.",1053734400,16,1228,4.654377880184332
1828506,1,B000087F7J,"X-Men Evolution rocks, dvd rocks, I think that these four episodes are the begining of the second season.
1-Growing pains
2-Bada-bing bada-boom
3-Power surge
4-Fun and games
yes, these are great episodes, but why can't i get ahold of the
ones from the first season? as you can tell I'm very disapointed.",1051056000,5,303,4.846153846153846
1828507,4,B000087F7J,"includes the first four eps of season 2:
ep 201 growing pains -- season opener, first appearance of the younger class (jubilee, cannonball, etc.), avalanche exposes the mutants to the school, but the professor wipes their minds
ep 202 badda bing badda boom -- boom boom's father forces her to steal money
ep 203 power surge -- jean grey's powers threaten to overwhelm her
ep 204 fun and games -- the x-men throw a party while the professor is away, but a student named arcade accidentally stumbles into the danger room
extras inc: language features, episode intros by the director frank paur, and a few other things that i haven't checked yet, prob. just bios on the characters. all in all sort of disappointing, since the rest of the episodes from season 1 haven't been put out and the first 4 eps of season 2 were def. not the best of the season. still, it's better than nothing.",1050969600,15,881,4.582278481012659
1828508,4,B000087F7J,"Sure, there's controversy-a-brewin over this show because it turns some of the classic ""X-Men"" characters into high school kids, but I think it helps make the message of Stan Lee's original book come across to a younger crowd -- a lesson of tolerance and acceptance.  It's a perfect fit to have these ""mutants"" discovering these new powers as their bodies change into adulthood.
That having been said, Warner Bros. is getting us again with a no-frills disc that boasts a selection of languages as a Special Feature.",1050192000,4,515,4.919540229885057
1828529,4,B000087F7J,"thats right they are back. XXXXX MEN. awesome new series, just now kids this will spin a new direction of characters and story lines. it's pretty good.",1208217600,,151,4.62962962962963
1828530,4,B000087F7J,"This series is a ""teenified"" version of the familiar X-Men stories and characters in the comics of the last 30 years or so. I won't say anything that spoils any surprises (This was a series that actually followed a progression over all, Season-to-Season) but if certain adjustments; like Scott Summers and Jean Grey being way younger than Wolverine in appearance, all the X-men going to a regular high school in addition to being ""students"" at the Xavier school, ""the brotherhood"" being all comprised of teens, bother you, then you probably won't be able to stomach this series which can at times feel like ""Saved By The Bell"" cast with Marvel Mutants. They play fast and loose with the continuity borrowed from the comic books. If you're a purist, you won't like any of this --Which would be too bad, because the action sequences are dynamic and beautifully animated, the voice characterizations are spot on. In general, the stories are pretty light in tone, not like the adult tone of the ""Justice League Unlimited"" Series or the ""Ultimate Avengers"" DVD movies for example. They tend to raise the stakes near the end of the seasons across this series.

As a media product Season 2 Volume 1 is a good quality DVD in my opinion. These DVDs are however a little short on extras and behind the scenes material. They should do away with all the trailers and promotion and save that space for featurettes and ""making of"" shorts.",1163030400,3,1424,4.765182186234818
1828531,5,B000087F7J,"This series doesn't mince words with the comic.  If you are looking for cheesy characters and the same old story line as the comics go for the 90's episodes.  If your going for something new and a revitilized x-men than watch this.  This is a new day for mutants and shows the trouble of high school teenage mutants.  My son and I watch it and both enjoy it, so it is good from 4 yr's old to 27.  Those of us who have been reading for a while will recognize and be amazed by how many chaaracters are brought to the new generation that we remember from our youth.  really a great show and worthwile buy.",1082246400,4,602,4.146551724137931
1828532,4,B000087F7J,The first season of this show was where it started. The sceond season was when it started to get reall good. All of these episodes are good but i'm kinda getting bored with Badda-Bing Badda-Boom. Tabitha is a good charcter and she comes back to the institute in the third season. She leaves the brotherhood house when Mystique came back. She wasn't happy to learn that Avalanche had tried to join the X-men but she soon straightens them out. Power Surge focuses on Jean and her teleapthy problem. The team helps her get under control soon. This is a great bunch of episodes and i'm sad that the series was cancelled. It's still on Cartoon Network though.,1078012800,2,654,4.598290598290598
1828533,5,B000087F7J,"Unfortunately, the WB is very poor at marketing DVDs for their animated series. This show is best viewed as a series, and it would have made more sense to simply come out with the entire second season on 1 DVD than simply throw a few episodes on a disc. That being said, if you can't wait for them to do that, I recommend grabbing this DVD. No extra features are included, but the show is one of the best comic book adapatations I've seen.",1070755200,,439,4.238095238095238
1828534,5,B000087F7J,"X-men Evolution is simply the best animated series in years, better than the 90's series, and will be enjoyed by people who may never have read the comic but liked the movies, whatever age you are (I'm 26). It is Xtremely well animated, the characters have depth, and you do care what happens to them. Good storylines, good voice acting, good humour for young and old to appreciate. Overall a very mature animated series and not kiddy-ish or comicbook-ish - just like the movies! Long may it run!",1062547200,4,496,4.6477272727272725
1828535,2,B000087F7J,I liked the 90s X-Men series.  This has some of the characters from the comics but it's mostly all a bunch of characters who arn't in the comics.  It doesn't have Gambit in it and it doesn't have Jubilee.  If you're an X-Men fan don't get this.,1060128000,4,244,4.148936170212766
1828536,5,B000087F7J,"Great DVD with some never before seen animation included.  I think the DVDs for the first season are supposed to come out some time in September this year.  There are only four episodes on the DVD, but I'm used to buying anime (at the most four episodes per DVD, usually fewer), so it seems like a pretty good deal to me.",1054339200,,321,4.245901639344262
1828537,4,B000087F7J,"Having grown up on the older FOX X-Men cartoon I started watching this series a little taken aback at the idea of changing nearly all the X-Men into teenagers. I found however that Evolution has done a nice job with the whole plot. These episodes were some of the better ones of the series, adding Boom-Boom to the story was a great idea (she is one of the lesser known very overlooked teen characters in the X-Men comic world) and her moments with Nightcrawler were priceless. I was also very happy to be able to find out  Wolfsbane (remade to look more human and less wolfish than she has been in the past) was one of the newest members of the evolution team.",1054166400,,661,4.373983739837398

7979644,5,B000087F7J,Again I am a major nerd - used to watch this show on KIDS WB on Saturday mornings with a big bowl of cereal and the box and jug of milk by my legs. LOL! Its toned down due to it was geared towards kids - only draw back: it wasn't all packaged together like S3 which was all one set and they STILL have not realeased S4 on DVD! I love X-Men anyways!,1386288000,,348,3.7162162162162162
7979645,5,B000087F7J,Purchased was made for my son's birthday who loves the early 2000 series.  Looked for this copy at stores and couldn't find it.  Only could get it thru Amazon. Product is in excellent condition and arrived in time for his birthday.,1379462400,,231,4.609756097560975
7979646,4,B000087F7J,"After re-experiencing the first season of this show, I decided to go ahead and buy the second one.  I was pleased to find that the animation, lip-synching, and voice acting had improved a bit.  Kurt/Nightcrawler remains my favorite element of the series; I also enjoy the high school setting, the anime style of the drawings, and the interesting situations that arise.  The humor can be lame sometimes, but at other times it's effective.  There's a surprising revelation about Rogue's friend Risty in one of the episodes on this DVD.

Overall, X-Men: Evolution definitely is not the best kids' show out there, but it's got some redeeming qualities.",1297555200,,648,5.018691588785047
7979647,4,B000087F7J,"A pretty good start to the second season.  Have to remember not to expect the story to match up with the older X-Men stories, but it is a fun series for any Marvel or just X-Men fan.",1256256000,,182,3.918918918918919
