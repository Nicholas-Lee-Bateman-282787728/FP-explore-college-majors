7865564,5,6304247621,"My rating is biased because I'm a big fan of the Sharpe series, having read all the books and seen all the episodes.  Sharpe is an extraordinary warrior hero.  He has high intelligence, common sense, loyalty and combat skill.  The acting is very credible, the scripts are superlative and the production values are lavish.  When I'm watching, it's as though I'm actually there.
This genre is not for everyone's taste, and the battle scenes can be a little graphic for some.  However, if you have an interest in the subject matter, you should be well pleased with these stories.  As a character in one of these episodes states a few times, ""That's soldiering!"".",1335571200,,659,4.787610619469026

7865566,5,6304247621,"Three more chances to see our hero Richard Sharpe proceed into France with some of the best and one of the worst of the series.
In SHARPE'S REGIMENT we get my favorite episode of the series and Sharpe and Harper travel back to England to try to find the missing 2nd regiment of the South Essex.  The return of Sir Henry Simmerson, and the introduction of both Jane and Lady Anne Camoynes make the episode good, but the totally different setting and the look at the making of a British soldier makes it great.  Sharpe is out of his element here, but luckly for him he gains allies to help save the day.  *****
In SHARPE'S SIEGE  we get a pretty good story as Sharpe is saddled with a young Col Bampfylde and a French Royalist to try to start and encourage revolt in France.  The return of Ducos and Fredrickson add greatly to the plot as does the introduction of General Calvet and his lackey.  The subplot concerning fever does nor, nor does the Royalist's sister, a strong supporter of Boney.  Look for a good subplot conerning one of Fredrickson's men.  ****3/4
SHARPE'S MISSION would easily be the worst of the series if it wasn't for SHARPE'S GOLD.  The basic plot is weak and the lead villian is just flat, but the subplots save the day.  Piecroft is a facinating character, Harper's problems with Ramona are very interesting, Calvet is well done, and the scene's between Harris and the English Reporter are priceless.  All these subplots and good acting despite a bad script by the usual crowd bails this episode out.
***3/4

7865567,5,6304247621,"This collection three of the Sharpe series is more adventrous and suspenseful as the other Shapre series before it.  In Sharpe's Regiment, both Sharpe and Harper find themselves being hunted down in London, while they try to crack down on a mysterious recruit shortage.  In Sharpe's Siege, the rope tightens around Sharpe's neck, when he's surrounded in a castle with a small force against a large French force.  In Sharpe's Mission, Sharpe risks his life to bring down a British officer, who kills the British and French.  Great series and enjoy!",987724800,9,547,4.978021978021978
