8054046,5,B0007YJGO0,"in this street boxing/ street savate videos they go over defensive methods (blocks, parries, etc.) and guards, but most of it involves prearranged but fast and rough defenses against various attacks. by fast and rough I mean that they are wearing shoes, they are on hard ground (not indoors on mats) and so on. the primary techniques used are boxing type strikes and street savate kicks and sweeps. they don't go over the basics of how to punch or kick but assume that you know a thing or two. the extras even include some bloopers as well as Robert Paturel in sport competition. If I remember right, this is one of a few videos by the company that won't play on some dvd players but it worked fine on my xbox and you could transfer it over.",1394755200,,741,4.416058394160584
8054047,1,B0007YJGO0,This may be a terrific video...gosh knows the previews I saw were excellent...Too bad I can't watch it.  Despite the Format saying US and Canada only...its in PAL (like THREE other DVD's I've ordered now) so I have a flat fly swatter I can use.  This really ticks me OFF!!!!!!,1252022400,,276,4.5
