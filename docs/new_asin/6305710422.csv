1059519,5,6305710422,"This PPV was pretty cool. It opened up with a great 6-Man Tag with Too Cool & Rikishi vs. Edge, Christian, and Kurt Angle. Former friends face off as Eddie Guerrero faces Dean Malenko and Perry saturn in a Triple  Threat Match for the European Title. Shane McMahon faces The Big Show in a  No Holds Barred, Falls Count Anywhere Match. Chris Benoit faces Chris  Jericho in a Submission Match for the IC Title. DX (Road Dogg and X-Pac)  face the Dudley Boyz in a Table Match. And the main event, Triple H vs. The  Rock for the WWF Championship in an Iron Man Match, with HBK Shawn Micheals  as the Special Referee. Not having been seen since September, The  Undertaker makes his long-awaited return, accidently costing The Rock the  title. The card was pretty good, and I'd recommend this PPV to anyone.",963100800,3,801,4.5524475524475525
1059520,4,6305710422,"Judgment Day 2000 was an very good show with solid action throughout. The Iron Man bout between Triple H and The Rock was well-booked and entertaining provided you can concentrate on the match for an hour. The  Undertaker's return was tremendous! Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit provided  an excellent bout. The table match between DX and the Dudley Boyz was solid  as was the opening six-man tag with Edge, Christian and Kurt Angle versus  Too Cool and Rikishi. The Big Show-Shane McMahon match wasn't the greatest  but at least it served a purpose with the Big Show legitimately needing  time off for a knee injury. (He had one coming in, he didn't suffer one  during the bout. In other words - for those who couldn't figure it out -  the injury during the bout was a work.) Overall, I would recommend watching  Judgment Day.",962582400,,826,4.680555555555555
1059521,4,6305710422,This was a wicked event from the WWF and it will stay in mymind when The Undertaker came down to ringside on his motor bike andkicked all over the arena and clearing the ring of everybody.

1059522,4,6305710422,"Going into JD, I was a bit miffed.  It was my first PPV I was going to get to see live.  I had paid $190 for 2 great seats in Freedom Hall and I was going to have to watch Triple H and the Rock stumble through an hour match.  what a surprise though!
As with any Iron match you have to pace your  spots and Hunter and Rocky did it and did it well.  The match was pretty  entertaining and despite a few slow moments the two really managed to carry  the match and make it good.  The end was a little confusing, with the clock  running out before the 'Taker got his spots in, but it was great return for  the ""Phenom.""
The card was also supported by a great Six Man  Tag between Too Cool and Rikishi v.s Edge/Christian/Kurt Angle.  Great  match.  Perfect way to start the show.
Jericho/Benoit submission was a  little slow, and the finish was even odder.  But there were some great  spots.

Undertakers return was almost as good as Austin 3:16 and The Rock having a beer together at Backlash.  I give it a 4  only because the Iron Man match got meccer-boring.,959817600,,275,4.46

1. 2 cool and rikishi vs. angle edge and Chritian- pretty funny watching edge and christian mock hilbillys- match was very good with amazing crowd participation(they used all the energy on this match). nice match i enjoyed it- ***

2. triple threat for the european title- Malenko vs. SAturn vs. Guerrero- good match but i cannot watch it anymore because the crowd is completly out pf it. still pretty good match- **1/2

3. NO DQ- BIG show vs. Shane o mac. decent match but somewhat undrwhelming you will see what i mean. a very fake ending- **

4. Ic title submission match Y2J vs. Benoit- there great feud continues as benoit proves yet again that he is the third best there is the third best there ever was and the third best there will ever be(behind Bret hart and Owen Hart) Jericho does great too- **** not a classic but a beautiful display by both wariors

5. tag team tables DX vs. dudleys- i liked this match a lot. there really isn't much else to say bout this one other than why didn't bubba pin brisco at the end?- ***

6. IRON MAN!60 min. wwf titlee rock vs. HHH- well actually this match is almost 45 minutes because they stall a lot at the begining still this is a great athletic display but its not even in the same league as the iron man from wrestlemania 12(HBK vs. Bret Hart) even though the cover of the vhs gives away the ending it is still kinda cool to hear the crowds reaction when they see the badass for the first time ever- ****1/2 not five because of the long periods of stalling still ****1/2 stars though

At the Judgment Day pay-per-view, Triple h defeated The Rock in a WWE Iron Man Match to capture his fourth WWE Championship.  The victory, however, was not without controversy.  A returning Undertaker took to the ring towards the end of the match.  The Deadman destroyed almost everybody at ringside, which also included Shane, Stephanie and Mr. McMahon.

1059657,5,6305710422,"This (along with Fully Loaded 2000) was the closest to a perfect wrestling card as one can get!
First, we start off with 2 Cool & Rikishi Vs. Kurt Angle/Edge & Christian. This was more of a good comedy with athleticism mixed in! Edge & Christian were still just getting their ring legs under them when this took place and this match was one of Kurt's more embarrasing moments. He would more than make up for that later on! As for 2 Cool/Rikishi, this was the height of popularity for that trio.
Perry Saturn Vs. Dean Malenko Vs. Eddie Gurrerro (WWF European Title) - This three was very impressive. Could've been a little longer but considering there was an Iron Man match on the card, I can understand why it was cut short.
Shane McMahon Vs. The Big Show - Big Show, as expected, dominated most of this bout but Shane as proven to be an impressive in-ring performer despite only being part time! Even the outside interference from Trish Stratus, Bull Buchanan, Test, Albert and others almost didn't get the job done! Despite losing, this was one of TBS' more impressive performances. Great bout overall.
The Dudley Boyz Vs. X-Pac/Road Dogg (Table's Match) - Surprise finish in this one!
Chris Benoit Vs. Chris Jericho (Submission Match) - They got the right two for this one! A classic bout in their storied rivarly!
The Rock Vs. HHH (IronMan Match) - Have to admit while I am still partial to Bret Hart/Shawn Michaels from WrestleMania 12 and Ricky Steamboat Vs. the late Rick Rude back in 1992, these two impressed me! Triple H, have to give him his due, was the man in 2000 and I figured he could go one hour but The Rock I wasn't so sure about but he did prove me wrong! Plus, unlike Bret/Shawn, there were actual falls in this one which added to the drama in my view. Also, I agree with other reviewers that this should've been left one on one. If there was going to be cheating, let it be by HHH or The Rock. Still, seeing the Undertaker return to break things up from DX was a nice touch though he inadvertaly cost The Rock the WWF title because of it! Still, was a great match and this whole card is a great addition to your wrestling collection!",1088553600,2,2155,4.444444444444445
1059677,5,6305710422,"This is up there with the best ppv's of all time, and certainly makes my top ten and that is having seen all wwe ppv's scince 1997. It had the right mix of wrestling and entertainment. I will now give my opinons on all the matchs
1) too cool and rakishi vs kurt angle, edge and christian- this match did what it was suppose to do get the crowd hot. it was an entertaining match throughout and the crowd were well into it; ***1/4
2) eddie guerrro vs perry saturn vs dean malenko- a very good example of technechily sound wrestling. It was good if not spectacular, a little too short for my liking, another 5-10 mins would of made it much better but still very good; ***1/2
3) Shane o mac v the big show- this was a no holds barred and falls count anywhere match and it was an entertaining brawl with a few good spots; **
4)Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit- no amount of praise can be high enough for these two and this match like all their other encounters was a technichel masterclass, great match with an unusal ending;; ****1/2
5) table match- the dudleyz v DX- a nicly worked tables match with good crowd reactions; **1/2
6) the 60 minute long iron man match- i never thought that these two could go 60 mins but damm they proved me wrong and how!! The match was mostly carried by HHH although the rock performed to the best of his wrestling ability. Great psychology from both and the match was made better by there being no interference (for 57 minutes anyway!) Overall great match, i was going to go ****3/4 on this one but i feel for 60 minutes a very good wrestling they deserve the full whammy *****",1066694400,,1604,4.314569536423841
1059678,4,6305710422,"Judgment Day 2000 was a great event. Not only did it have a good undercard but the main event was totally excellent!
1. Too Cool & Rikishi vs. Edge, Christian, & Kurt Angle. This match was surprisingly entertaining and fun to watch. The wrestling wasn't top-notch but this match will definetly keep you entertained threw it. (2.5/5)
2. Triple Threat WWF European Title Match: Eddie Guerrero with Chyna (c) vs. Dean Malenko vs. Perry Saturn. Match was good but not nearly as great as it could have been with Perry Saturn out of the title picture. We probably would have witnessed another Dean Malenko/Eddie Guerrero classic if they were the only ones in this match, but then again if it was booked with the same ending this one had, I wouldn't have liked it anyway. I hate cheap wins at the very end of a good match. (3/5)
3. Shane-O-Mac vs. The Big Show. One question - Which way did he go? This match was a fine display of decent hardcore spots but they didn't do nearly as much damage as I thought they would. Big Show got injured in this match, at least at the very ending of the match though! The cinderblock against the head to pick up the victory? Way to think WWE! I mean they know we are stupid enough to believe that it was an actual cinderblock! (2/5)
4. Chris Benoit (c) vs. Chris Jericho for the Intercontinental Title in a submission match. This match was pretty good but not that memorable as I can't even remember who won. I don't even know if Chris Benoit was the champion before this title bout. From what I remember - 4/5 - Good but not as great as it could have been!
5. Dudley Boyz vs. DX's Road Dogg and X-Pac w/. Tori in a tag team table match. This match was real really boring! I fast-forwarded threw it because it just took so damn long to put the bodies threw the tables! After the match Gerald Briscoe comes out and gets put threw a table for trying to protect another women, which he did but was sent threw the table. This was not Briscoe's first appearance on the pay per view... More like his 6 or 7th - Yeah, that is how horrendous the booking for the PPV segments were. Have Briscoe in every segment, smart McMahon!
6. The Iron Man Match: The Rock (c) vs. Triple H with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee. This was the match that made me buy the tape and did this make it all worth while! Wow, tremendous match between WWF's finest around this time. They entertained every minute of this match and the psycology by both men made the match more heart-felt. With about 5 minutes left, DX come out and try to screw The Rock but as the score was tied at the time BUT The Undertaker returned to a tremendous ovation and cleared house but in the process Chokeslamed Triple H. This caused a DQ for The Rock and Triple H wins the title. I would have liked it to have been a clean finish but this ending was pretty thought-out and they did a great job with it! One of the best matches of the year and to date still both wrestler's longest match.
I would recommend anyone to get this tape because the Iron Man match is just one hell of a match. With all the hype that was given to it, it still did not let down!",1047513600,,3142,4.2823529411764705
1059679,3,6305710422,"I was there at Freedom Hall in Louisville when this PPV took place and I couldn't wait for the show to get started.  Overall, I was pleased with a few matches, but the rest just didn't deliver.  The iron man match and the submission match was the only highlights of the whole entire show, everything else was kinda boring and predictable.  In the match between Big Show and Shane O Mac, you know Shane would have a army full of people coming to his aid while Big Show was wiping the floor out with him.  There match at Backlash a year later was way better than this one!  The six man tag was boring as well as the dudleys vs x-Pac and road dogg.  The only highlight to that match was seeing Gerald Brisco get the 3-D thru the table.  The iron match was hands down the best match of the night and I think it is their best match thru out their feud which has gone on ever since Rock debuted back in late 1996.  If you seen the ppv or heard about it, you know what happened at the end of the match.  I thought it was pretty cool seeing Undertaker come out on a bike and beat the [stuff] out of DX and the McMahons.  I think this gimmick is way better than the ministry of darkness thing that he did before he had to sit down due to injuries.  Anyway, I only give this 3 stars because of the main event and the submission match, everything else is really not worth your time!",1045008000,,1371,4.097378277153558
1059680,5,6305710422,"To put it in one word, Judgment Day 2000 was awesome. A compelling mix of good angles, exciting storylines and fantastic wrestling, this is one of the best wrestling wise shows I have ever seen. The blinding submission match between Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho, which was a classic battle, and a definate match of the year contender. There is lots of other good stuff to fill up the card too. I will review each match and rate it out of five (*****)
Overall, well worth checking out. Awesome tape worth the cash. Everything on it is good, there are few, if any glitches and overall just well worth checking out.

1059681,4,6305710422,"Overall, Judgment Day 2000 is a good ppv. Some of the matches could have been better. Like the tag team table match. Most of the match is all tagging. The end of it is where all the Table breaks take place. Also the No DQ match between Shane'O'Mac and the Bigshow. There were some nice spots, but it was too short. A real good match was the Submission match between Chris Benoit and Y2J. Very technical. The Main event was alright. It was no Bret Hart/Shawn Micheals, but it was cool. The best part about it is the Undertaker's return.
So, like I said, Judgment Day was a good ppv.",1022457600,,581,4.290909090909091
1059682,4,6305710422,"The WWF hot streak of 2000 continued through the end of this PPV.  After that the creativity declined along with the ratings.
Rikishi and Too Cool vs. Edge, Christian, and Kurt Angle - Edge, Christian and Angle do an absolutely hilarious pre-match promo to get heel heath.  Good formula tag match.  Everyone hits their spots.  Great way to get the crowd into it. ***3/4
European Title Triple-Threat Match - Eddy Guerrero vs. Dean Malenko vs. Perry Saturn - Nothing against Saturn, but if he wasn't in this match it could have been awesome.  Guerrero and Malenko have had some mind-blowing matches in the past (check out ECW Path of Destruction for their 2 out of 3 falls classic).
As it is, it is just very good.  Great spot with the triple German Suplex. ***1/2
Submission Match for IC Title - Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho - The feud continues.  Jericho was disqualified in a title match at Backlash 2000.  This is what wrestling is about.  Great psychology as both men work each other over in set up for their respective submission moves.  Jericho even gets the Liontamer in the ropes!  Great match with a clean finish this time. ****3/4
Tag Team Table Match - X-Pac and Road Dogg vs. Dudleyz - Dudleyz had been putting women through tables leading up to this.  They want to get to Tori who is with D-X at this point.  Solid, but unspectacular match. **
Falls Count Anywhere - Shane McMahon vs. Big Show - Shane was upset because Big Show was the first man eliminated at Wrestlemania.  Big Show was just a fun-loving giant at this point.  Shane tries a PLANCHA~! but gets caught.  Some stuff happens and there is interference. *1/2
60-Minute Iron Match - WWF Title - The Rock vs. Triple H - Shawn Michaels is the special guest referee.  This is important because the last time these two met for the title Shawn Michaels was the referee and cost The Rock the title.  This is an awesome old-school match with moves countered to other moves and moves set up by moves and working an opponent's body part over.  Rock with La Majestral cradle!  A sleeper gets one of the falls!  Triple H tries a Rock Bottom!  Rock tries a Pedigree!  Undertaker returns!  This one is certainly on par with the Iron Match between Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart.  They are different, don't get me wrong, but they are very much the same in terms of quality.  Incredible match with a bad finish, but that doesn't ruin the first 59 minutes. ****3/4
In the End: This is the last really awesome show before King of the Ring stunk up PPV.  If Benoit or Jericho had been elevated to main event level to take on the winner of Rock/HHH it could have continued, but it was not to be.  As it is Judgment Day 2000 is a reminder of what could have been for the WWF.  Strong recommendation here.",1017792000,,2758,4.504032258064516
1059683,5,6305710422,"All I have to say Judgement Day is one of the best PPVs I have seen in the year 2000. The best matches on that tape that interest me the most was the Triple threat European Championship
match between Eddie Gurrereo, Dean Malenko, & Perry Saturn. And of the Course the Iron Man match stole the whole show especially The Return of The Undertaker when he destroyed any one that got in his way. In my opinion I think Triple H was the better man in the match because he thought of so many ways to out smart Shawn Micheals & The Rock.

1059754,5,6305710422,"I dunno about you, but it seems that with the absence of one Stone Cold Steve Austin, the quality of WWF pay-per-views increased tenfold.  Maybe it was because there were some genuine wrestlers at the top of the card.  Maybe it was because people were actually selling their opponents moves.  Or maybe Austin is just plain dull.
Whatever the reason, the WWF took the bull by the horns in putting The Rock and Triple H in a 60 minute Iron Man Match (which insiders call ""The Hour"", as Jim Ross insists on telling us, as if we didn't know what 60 minutes equates to).  The question was not could they pull together a decent match, but whether they could stretch it over 60 minutes.  Chuck into the mix the spectre of former Iron Man Match winner, former WWF Champion, egomaniac and HHH buddy Shawn Michaels as guest referee for the match, and you've got a nice little setup, with few having any sure clue of how it would turn out.  I thought that Rock and Triple H would struggle to 30 mins, as they did at Fully Loaded 1998, and that the match would become a plodding waste of time.
I was wrong.
In a match that could be considered the best of the half-year, these two excelled themselves in putting together an excellent outing, justifying their positions at the top of the WWF, and especially over Mr. Austin.  It certainly helped the credibility of the WWF title, proving that you have to be on your best day, every day, to hold onto the gold, and also helped morale in the WWF, that the quality of Backlash the previous month was no fluke.  Okay, so the ending is spoiled by advertising the return of the Undertaker on the cover of the video, but one minor blip does not tarnish this excellent match.
On the undercard, Chrises Benoit and Jericho put together another contender for match of the half year in a stunning submissions match.  My advice is to watch out for an excellent Walls Of Jericho, using the ropes for leverage.  Elsewhere, Shane McMahon bumps like a true pro in his match with the Big Show, and Radicalz Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn and Dean Malenko put on a wrestling tour-de-force in their European Title match.  Edge, Christian and Kurt Angle get the Louisville, Kentucky crowd irate with their antics before the opening bout, and if you don't laugh at it, you must be from Louisville.
If you buy only one WWF video a year, make sure it's this one.  It takes the mediocre WrestleMania 2000 and slaps it around bigstyle.  Possible the best wrestling pay-per-view of the year, as everything started to go slightly pear-shaped around the return of JR's good friend (as he so often tells us), Stone Cold Steve Austin.",978480000,,2637,4.561440677966102

That night i was expecting the taker to come back in an incredible fasion but not this way i mean come on i loved the match but even better he came down and tore mr vince apart and it was fun to watch and see these two great superstars go at it in one of the most brutal matches in my time the iron man match 60 minutes of hard battling in and out of the ring. But the best part of the match was when the rock came out of the ring and gave triple h a pedigree on the annouce table and the table collapesed and JR and the King didn't know what to do King was sucking up as usual he wanted to make sure hunter was okay.  We all knew that Triple h was hurt just how bad was he hurt.  I was mad at the end when taker showed up but i was happy when he went after vince and not anyone else but he did go after someone else but i will not tell you who you just have to see for yourself the rest of the tape is awesome and you will enjoy this tape from the wwf it is one of there better ppv and get it if you haven't seen it you will miss out on one of the better ironman matches,977097600,,1253,3.6333333333333333

1059757,5,6305710422,"I'll admit that I was one of the skeptics who groaned when HHH issued the challenge of a 60 Minute Iron Man Match to The Rock for JUDGMENT DAY 2000.  Now I have enormous admiration and hell, even favoritism, towards HHH and reserve just as much praise for The Rock.  In terms of athleticism, stamina, and ability to entertain the fans, they never fail to disappoint.  Yet was this a match they were ready to handle?  More importantly, was this a match that could hold the audience's attention?  I'm glad to say that the night of JUDGMENT DAY, I was left in about as much awestruck as I have been ever left in this whole year after any PPV.  I said this the second the Pay-Per-View finished, and I'll say it again: THIS PAY-PER-VIEW KICKED MAJOR @$$.
As we know, Stone Cold Steve Austin was instrumental in costing HHH the WWF title to The Rock at Backlash.  About a week later, a pissed off HHH challenges The Rock to the match everybody in the locker room is afraid to do, and while most people are thinking of the Hell in a Cell, we're all in for a surprise when he reveals that it's a 60 Minute Iron Man Match.  So the match is set, right, and we have about two weeks left til the Pay Per View.  But wait ... in another shocker, the Heartbreak Kid Shawn Michaels comes back the week or so after HHH's announcement and declares that he is retiring from his position as WWF Commissioner, but not before guest refereeing the Iron Man Match.  On a personal note, I thought if the writers were going to bring HBK back at a certain point following his anti-climactic appearance at the first ever Smackdown!, this was an excellent time to do it.  And if you don't know the significance of HBK and him refeering the Iron Man Match, then you need to brush up on your WWF knowledge.  And no, it has nothing to do with HBK and HHH being two of the original D-Generation X members.  But anyhow, the match is set.... and whether or not the match is anybody's cup of tea, it's gonna happen ....
The Pay-Per-View's opener of Kurt Angle and Edge & Christian vs. Too Cool and Rikishi is some awesome entertainment, not to mention some hilarity from the heels before the match starts as they crack on the Kentucky folks.  The European Title Match between Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn, and Dean Malenko is also enjoyable, in terms of wrestling.  Dudleys vs. DX in a Tables Match was surprisingly good, too, even though I wonder just why in the hell DX had to go over, seeing as how they were on life support as it is.  X-Pac and Road Dogg are seriously awful heels, and their lack of crowd heat, not to mention overshadowing from the new major talent, would nil the future of these two men.  Shane McMahon vs. The Big Slow isn't really much of anything, but hey, Shane O Mac got to win over The Big Slow, and this kept the no-talent Slow out of the WWF scene for a couple months!  Yeah, Shane O!  The Benoit/Jericho submission match is not WrestleMania XIII's Austin/Bret, but hey, Canadian wrestlers kick @$$ and while HHH and The Rock headline the Pay-Per-View, I wouldn't be surprised if these two were the next superstars to helm the Iron Man Match.  Bravo for that match.
Now the main event.  In a match where the number of falls have to be measured, and spots have to be made in strong accordance with the time, this one pulls all those with attitude.  The Rock and HHH pull off what is, in my opinion, their strongest match together ever.  I was completely on the edge of my seat that night, and remember with fondness how these guys just DESTROYED each other.  While many argue that this Iron Man Match can't touch the original, I heartily disagree.  The Rock and HHH proved why they were the top performers in the business, and did it with style.  This match had just as much intensity and excitement as the original, with an expected WWF Attitude sort of ending, which I might add features the return of the Undertaker.  And he has a new gimmick, too.
As with WRESTLEMANIA XII's Iron Man Match, I'd say that if you didn't have the attention span or patience to see wrestlers at it for 60 minutes, I doubt you'll find much more interest in this.  However, I still maintain that this is one of the best Pay-Per-Views the WWF has ever pulled off, and hope that they have shows like this all the time.",974764800,2,4291,4.404309252217997
1059758,5,6305710422,"Judgement Day 2000 had all the great qualities of a WWF PPV.  A good undercard, a fabulous main event, and the Lord of Darkness himself, the Dead Man, the Phenom, he Buries Them Alive!, The American Badass, The UNDERTAKER.
The mid and undercard featured a slow submission match.  Although it did have some entertaining spots, for, Jericho and Benoit just cant put on a boring match.  It could have been around 5 minutes slower though.  Overall, a decent match!
It also featured a table match with the dudleys v DX.  This match was very predictable, although i like all 4 wrestlers and the ending of the match, this bout just didn't have the electricity.
The Main Event- Most definately a candidate for match of the year.  Rocky and HHH were able to go the distance.  Both wrestlers saved themselves so they had some energy for the final minutes. JR had some great play-by-play on this match, and Shawn Michaels did a fine job as the special ref. This match has the most surprising, controversial, and best ending of the year.  As it gives away on the cover, The Undertaker makes a long awaited return.  And let me say that the crowd went absolutely bananas.
Overall, a great PPV, and a total STEAL. The Main event could have easily main evented a Wrestlemania. Click away and own it today!",971740800,,1289,4.618421052631579

7892962,5,6305710422,"The WWF fans of Louisville, Kentucky prepare themselves because Judgment Day has hit their city hard with an All Star PPV! Not one match on this card is a sleeper or lacks in entertainment. Not one! And because this PPV is so awesome I will describe it in its fullest!

The PPV starts off with a backstage segment of the McMahom-Helmsley faction planning a pre-celebration for Triple H's win against The Rock before sending Hardcore Champion, Gerald Brisco on an errand to get everyone coffee, which leads to him being attacked backstage by the Headbangers

1.) 6 Man Tag Team Match: Kurt Angle, Edge, and Christian vs Too Cool and Rikishi

- This was an exciting and fun match to kick off the PPV but before it began, E&C performed one of their 5 second poses for the fans of Louisville, mocking their stereotypical culture. Must watch to see Edge looking absolutely hilarious with fake teeth haha! Getting to the match though, it was fun and went back and forth. Several nearfalls and nice bumps with both teams taking full advantage of the tagging. The ending comes with Rikishi getting the pinfall on Edge after Grandmaster Sexay came off the top rope on Edge with a leg drop. Too Cool and Kish go on to treat the Louisville fans to a post-match dance

2.) European Championship Match: Eddie Guerrero w/Chyna (c) vs Perry Saturn vs Dean Malenko

- This match all sort of came about when problems arose with the Radicalz, supposedly caused by Chyna. What you get here is a fairly fast paced match with a nice mix of submission, brawling, technical, and high flying arsenals used here. 3 former WCW superstars at their finest! Chyna trips Malenko causing him to fall face first on a set of roses, supposedly knocking him unconscious, allowing Eddie to win and retain his title. After the match, Eddie and Chyna reveal that there was a lead pipe in the roses, which caused Malenko to go unconscious

They show a video of Gerald Brisco on the previous Smackdown winning the Hardcore Championship from Crash Holly by pinning him while he was napping. It then leads to a funny backstage segment of a paranoid Gerald Brisco sneaking his way out of the bathroom and scaring himself lolol

3.) No Disqualifications Match: Shane McMahon vs Big Show

- This feud all began after Wrestlemania when Big Show had a change in heart by becoming an ""entertainer"" and began mimicking other superstar's gimmicks. This led to Show's then manager, Shane McMahon berating him, reminding him of his loss at Wrestlemania and claiming he was pathetic. It lead to weeks of Shane getting the upperhand on Show, with the help of the McMahon-Helmsley faction, which lead to this match. This match sees interferences from many different people on Shane's behalf. From Big Bossman to T&A and Trish Stratus, and Bull Buchanan. The match ends up going towards the entrance ramp, where Buchanan tackles Big Show down and Shane pushes a large speaker on to Show's left leg, followed by breaking a cinder block over his head to get the win.

Another comedy segment with Gerald Brisco sees him trying to find comfort in the referee's locker room until the end of the show but as soon as he falls asleep for a second, the refs try to pin him but Brisco wakes up and leaves, flustered

4.) Intercontinental Championship Match: After a DQ ending occcured in their last IC Title match at Backlash, Jericho and Benoit locked horns again for the prestigious title. These 2 know how to put on a great match! Everything you could ever want in a match, you'll find here. Each have a technical, high flying, and submission move set and go back and forth taking each other down with all sorts of moves. Benoit wins the match after making Jericho pass out in the Crossface to retain the title, but ultimately both of these men are winners for putting on a hell of a match! Jericho/Benoit was definitely a top feud of the Attitude Era and this would not be the last time they battled on PPV for the Intercontinental Title

There's yet another backstage segment with Brisco! This time he's being interviewed by Michael Cole when 2 backstage crew workers start looking at him and plotting but he sees them and attacks them before running off. And people today say that there were no oomedy segments back in the Attitude Era lol

5.) Tag Team Table Elimination Match: Road Dogg and X-Pac w/Tori vs The Dudley Boyz

- This was another fun match to watch and even though things started out slow, they picked up as the match went on. Towards the end the match gets really hectic and crazy as Bubba and Dogg both throw the referee though the table for being in the way! Tori ends up getting involved, causing her to almost get put through a table by Bubba but gets saved by X-Pac and a interfering Gerald Brisco. The interference allows X-Pac to give Bubba the X-Factor though the table to win the match. After the bout, Gerald Brisco taunts the Dudleyz and receives a 3D through a table for his actions

6.) 60 Minute Iron Man WWF Championship Match: Triple H vs The Rock (c) w/Shawn Michaels as the Special Referee

- For 60 minutes, 2 of the greatest superstars of the Attitude Era will face Judgment Day early as they put each other through hell to ensure they walk out with the WWF Title. With Shawn Michaels appointed the Special Referee, a question that was constantly buzzing throughout the night was whether or not Shawn Michaels would show favoritism towards Triple H or The Rock or call it down the middle. This was the second Iron Man match the WWF had and boy was this a historical one. Throughout this match, both Rock and HHH pulled out all the stops and even did things many of them had rarely if ever done in the past (ex. Rock using a Figure 4 Leg Lock on HHH). Throughout points in the match Triple H and Michaels would get into arguments, which would ultimately give The Rock the advantage. Towards the last 20-15 minutes of the match, it begins getting bloody. Triple H's desperation comes into play when he busts The Rock open with a steel chair, getting himself DQ'd but earning back the fall with a sleeper hold. Around the last 2 minutes of the match, all hell breaks loose and the arena explodes as we see the entire McMahon-Helmsley faction interfere, leading to the return of The Undertaker! With every fan on their feet, Taker cleaned house, disposing of every member of the McMahon-Helmsley faction, which ends up playing a factor in the final outcome of the match.

Overall: I recommend you adding Judgment Day 2000 to your collection if you do not have it already as it's way too much of a great PPV from 2000 to not own.",1359676800,,6600,4.609028960817717

7892965,4,6305710422,"Thanks to finding another old WWF tape in my collection being Judgment Day 2000. This event picked up the pieces from the previous event, Backlash, as The Rock finally regained the WWF Championship with help from Stone Cold Steve Austin but as Triple H stated, ""this game was not over"" as he issued the challenge for an Iron Man Match. However, a bit of controversy entered the match as the week prior on RAW, Shawn Michaels had made his return to the WWF to announce that he was handing over his Commissioner status but also stating that he was going to be the special guest referee for this match which instantly sparked the question; Whose side will Shawn be on? or will he call it right down the middle?

Rikishi & Too Cool vs Edge, Christian & Kurt Angle. Before the match, there was a hilarious five second pose in which Angle, Edge & Christian made fun of the Kentucky fans that I just thought was priceless. Once that got out of the way, this was a fun opening contest with everyone getting a moment to shine & getting the crowd worked up for the rest of the night.

WWF European Champion Eddie Guerrero vs Dean Malenko vs Perry Saturn. The former ""Radicals"" battled here with the added fact that Chyna was carrying a lead pipe in her flowers that would end up playing a factor in the end. This was one of those triple threat matches where there was just constant action throughout with each man gaining some momentum along with Malenko & Saturn teaming up on Guerrero at various times before turning on each other in a very good contest.

No Holds Barred: Shane McMahon vs Big Show. Big Show dominated this match from the opening stages as he just did whatever he wanted with Shane including throwing Shane on top of the Judgment Day sign at the staging area. From there though, the match turned as there was various run-ins from Big Bossman, Bull Buchanan, Test & Albert including Trish Stratus before Shane would use a speaker & a ""cinderblock"" to get the win.

Submission Match: Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit vs Chris Jericho. Benoit came into this match with a bad knee based off an attack from Hardcore Holly on the previous SmackDown to the point that he even had to wear a brace on the knee. Anytime that you have Jericho & Benoit in a match, you know that you are almost guaranteed a quality match & this was no exception. Both men were aggressive as Benoit worked over the arm including applying an armbar along with Jericho being vicious on the knee by using steel steps, the brace itself & even applying a modified verision of the ""Walls Of Jericho"" in the ropes that was similar to Tajiri's ""tarantula"" move. As I said, both men were aggressive to the point where Benoit was ruthless when he applied the crossface & choked Jericho out conscious to get the win even though Jericho didn't submit. Again, a high quality match between these two.

Tables Match: X-Pac & Road Dogg vs Dudley Boyz. The story surrounding this match was Bubba Ray being obsessed with putting Tori through a table with the first blood being drawn by DX when Tori splashed Bubba through a table a week prior on RAW. This was an average match that went back & forth between both teams with moments such as Road Dogg putting D-Von through a table, Bubba Ray's sick powerbomb on X-Pac, Gerald Brisco getting involved in the finish with X-Pac doing a top rope ""X-Factor"" through a table before Brisco payed for getting involved in the match at the hands of the Dudleys.

Iron Man Match: WWF Champion The Rock vs Triple H w/Shawn Michaels as special guest referee. The second Iron Man match in WWF history here which had a similar backstory that the first one had in which the two men battling had such a long history between the two of them. Both men talked trash in the early stages along with trying to ""one-up"" the other with various test of strengths including Rock showing his athleticism at one point from being in the bridge position for the test of strength. They went high impact in the ring with both men using offense that we had rarely seen from them in the past such as Rock using a figure four leglock at one point while Triple H even had problems with HBK various times that ended up breaking his momentum at times. They had an out of control brawl various times with both men hitting the stage set various times, going through the crowd, suplexing each other off the ground & even Rock delivering a pedigree onto the announce table that didn't give. They told a great story throughout as Triple H was getting desperate to keep the advantage on The Rock to the point that he sacrificed a fall by hitting Rock with a chair to soften him up some more but then gained a fall back for that move while Rock was constantly trying to fight back from the assault & get closer to the scores as time went on. The last two minutes of this match was one of the most intense moments that I have ever seen in WWF history as the crowd was absolutely into every move that both men made along with cameos from DX, Shane, Vince & the return of the Undertaker that ended up playing a factor in the match from before the time expired, but even with that ending, this was a lost classic encounter, a highlight match for both men's careers & was worthy of being on both men's DVD sets.

In the end, there was only one bad match on the card & that was the Shane/Show ""match"" but other than that, this was one of the best WWF events of 2000 as the rest of the card delivered with the main event being worth the price of admission alone so I would highly recommend this one.",1223510400,,5562,4.447058823529412
7892966,4,6305710422,"Judgment Day 2000 hosted the second ever 60 minute ironman match in the modern era. I would have to say that the ironman match could possibably be the best match in 2000. The mid-card was very good as well which included a tables match and a submission match for the ic title. This is a good ppv to pick up. Judgment Day also hosted the big 10 month return of the Undertaker.

1. Six Man Tag
Kurt Angle and Edge & Christian vs. Too Cool & Rikishi
This match became a very exciting and fun opener. The crowd was very into this one from the beginning. Angle, Christian, & Edge gave a pretty entertaining 5 second pose before the match. A great opening match up, very exciting and fun. 4/5

2. European Title
Eddie Guerrero w/ Chyna vs. Dean Malenko vs. Perry Saturn
This was a solid triple threat match. The match went at a very fast and energetic pace. Malenko & Saturn would double team Eddie at some points in the match. Eddie used his lying, cheating, and stealing tactics along with chyna which helped him get the victory. Good match for the title. 4.25/5

3. No Holds Barred & Falls Count Anywhere
Big Show vs. Shane McMahon
This wasn't a bad match but it wasn't all that good either. Big Show as pictured controlled and dominated Shane in the earlier part of the match. About 4 or 5 guys would come out and beat on Big Show and give Shane the upper hand. Show would fight back at some points. Shane with help of a cinder block and a speaker box gets the victory over Show. Average match at best. 3.5/5

4. Submission Match for the IC Title
Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit
These two put on another great match and they were perfect for this type of a match. Benoit really had the advantage for a good while on Jericho and worked on the arm and shoulder of him. Jericho tryed to work on the knee and leg of Benoit. One good point in the match was when Jericho applies the walls of jericho on Benoit on the apron of the ring which looked like it really torqued the back and neck of Benoit. The match was more on the nasty side than anything else. Had a good ending with Jericho choking out to the crossface. Great competitive match for the IC belt. 5/5

5. Tables Match
Dudley Boyz vs. Road Dogg & X-Pac w/ Tori
A good tables match but not as good as the one from Royal Rumble. The only real problem this match had was where the teams had to tag in and out during the match. There was a good tag match going on unitl the tables got introduced to the match. The table spots came at good times and the moves into the tables were good as well. Gerald Brisco would interfere in the match cause of the whole protect women's right he had going on at the time. Still a good tables match. 4.5/5

6. 60 Minute Ironman Match with Shawn Michaels as the Special Referee
WWE Champion The Rock vs. Triple H
This second ironman match was totally different than from the first one between HBK & Bret Hart. HBK called the match very good and right down the middle and much better than people expected him to. I also have to give credit to the Rock, he may not be the best wrestler but he wrestled a very good match right here.

The Rock & Triple h put on a great and solid wrestling clinic. They both used smart and selective moves at the appropriate times in the match. They both brawled for a while. The brawling on the outside was very good too which had a good table spot involving the Rock pedigreeing HHH on the announce table. Both used a few submissions moves including the sleeper hold and the figure four to wear down each other. They wrestled at a good pace throughout the match. The last two minutes really got you on the edge of seat. Once the Undertaker made his return he cleaned house, chokeslamming everybody in sight. This was a classic match up between the Rock and Triple H. Possibably the best match from 2000. 5/5*****
