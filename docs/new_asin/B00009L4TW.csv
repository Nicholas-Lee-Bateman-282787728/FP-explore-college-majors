7991122,3,B00009L4TW,"Ok, so let's be real, when they were making the sequel to Unborn, they probably were going for a hit horror classic, but midway through production they realize it would probably be more of a comedy and not be taken seriously.

The movie is about a mother and her baby name Joey, who isn't quite a normal baby. They move into their new home with their their crazy next door neighbors and a guy who is also new to the neighborhood. Things seem pretty quiet and peaceful. That's until they find out that there's a crazy woman running around murdering certain babies. The mother has to protect Joey at all costs, more than ever, until this woman is caught.

Unborn 2 is not to be taken seriously but still be able to enjoy the fun. The characters are not really memorable but still hold your interest. The story can sometimes get lost, but it's not to hard to figure things out. The gore level is there and the special effects are pretty cool for it's time.

Unborn 2 has a unique idea that was very risky because it involves children. The movie is not top of the line but still in my opinion a classic. This is worth a watch if you're into horror movies or just catching up on all the horror movies from the 90's.",1473897600,,1210,4.3215859030837

The only thing I do is tell how I felt about the movie as far as how good I think it is. And this movie is by far better than the first.

7991127,2,B00009L4TW,"It's amazing that a sequel to The Unborn was ever made, considering how much it borrowed from other more popular, more successful films; although inspirations such as Child's Play and It's Alive did indeed gain multi-film franchises. The absurdity of the first film is doubled for the sequel: the plot is even more ludicrous, the acting is just as hokey, the hideous baby prop got uglier and the slayings are just as laugh-out-loud funny. The Unborn II is pure schlock, but is actually quite entertaining despite numerous flaws - it's a cheesy, obscure B-movie that lives up to the ridiculousness of its predecessor.

The opening scene is a shocking child execution at gunpoint as Linda Holt (Robin Curtis) continues on a serial killing spree, crossing off the names of her infant victims. After blowing away a baby point blank at a maternity ward (followed by an unlikely gunfight with security guards, accompanied by the screams of dozens of babies in the same nursery), Linda goes in search of Catherine Moore's child Joey.

Catherine (Michele Greene) is a writer who just moved into a new home with her super smart, horrifically deformed six-month-old baby Joey. Little does she know that Linda was also a patient of Dr. Meyerling, a crazed scientist who conducted genetic experiments with the hopes of creating a race of superior humans, and that her child Joey is an extremely intelligent, murderous mutant mastermind who has been brainwashing her into doing its bidding. Nosey neighbors, a careless babysitter, child protective services and more threaten to uncover the secrets of Joey's existence - leading to a bloodbath no one can escape.

The Joey doll has gotten even more visually disturbing than the plastic babies used in the first film; it's constantly slimy, covered in blood and emitting guttural cries. Unfortunately it's just as recognizable as an electronic puppet prop. There are a few surprises, however, even if the story is full of holes. Friendly neighbor John (Scott Valentine) presents the biggest mystery, although Catherine's survival skills are also highly questionable. Through the course of the film she falls through a ceiling, down a staircase twice, and battles the cunning baby - all while nursing a bullet wound and neck and leg injuries - and continues to get up, barely flinching, and certainly unable to waste a moment to dust herself off. Perhaps even more comical is the close-quarters shootout in Catherine's kitchen in which dozens of bullets are discharged and no one is hit.

The camera frequently spins around and quickly cuts to front angles and back shots of the characters, allowing for Joey to keep jumping out at opportune moments. The scares are rarely sincere, although suspense is hinted at a handful of times. Many segments make absolutely no sense, accommodating for struggling moments of terror - Catherine is left to clean up a bloody murder scene in her own home while waiting for Joey to reappear, and child protective services agents cautiously enter her home as if they were a bomb squad looking for explosives - surely they didn't know the child was a superhuman killer when they were called in.

Sadly The Unborn II is set up for a third part when Linda's hit list includes one more name below Catherine's - unfortunate because a third film was never made. It may sound like a complete waste of time, but there is, surprisingly, a high level of trashy fun in this wholly goofy series.

7991128,3,B00009L4TW,"One thing you can say about Roger Corman: he's consistent. ""Consistent"" meaning his films always turn a profit (supposedly). ""Consistent"" also means that a viewer sitting down to a watch a Corman flick will consistently find the film in question larded with enough cheese to clog an elephant's arteries. You will see cheesy acting, cheesy special effects, and cheesy plots. Depending on the type of genre, you'll also find plenty of gory mayhem, beautiful babes, and nudity from the aforementioned beautiful babes. That's Roger Corman in a nutshell. Oh wait, I almost forgot; he's also the biggest ripoff artist in Hollywood history. Any film that has hit the big time in the last forty years invariably sees Roger Corman making a similar flick in an effort to cash in on the more successful offering. For example, when ""Jaws"" hit the jackpot back in the 1970s, Corman followed up with several pictures capitalizing on monsters run amok. When the car movie craze swept America in the late 1970s, Roger quickly jumped aboard by releasing films focusing on cars. ""Star Wars"" saw our man releasing several science fiction films strongly resembling, well, ""Star Wars"". That's Corman for you. Love him or leave him.

""The Unborn II,"" an inferior sequel to the intriguing 1991 film ""The Unborn,"" begins with a slam-dunk scene one won't see in many American films. A woman, Linda Holt (Robin Curtis), approaches a playground overflowing with happy tykes. She coolly surveys the scene, walks up to one of the youngsters, and proceeds to pump him full of bullets. The movie could have ended right there and I probably would have given it five stars. You just don't see scenes like this in horror movies these days. It's too politically incorrect. Let's move on. Main character Catherine Moore (Michele Greene) moves into a nice neighborhood with her baby boy Joey. The film immediately treats us to scenes of domestic tranquility punctuated with encounters between Catherine and her nosy neighbors Artie and Marge Philips (Darryl Henriques and Carol Ita White). These two give a whole new meaning to the word ""intrusive"" as they pepper our protagonist with all sorts of annoying questions. They also want to see the baby, predictably enough, but Catherine won't reveal her offspring. Why? If you've seen the first film, you already know the answer to that question. Quit bothering me and just read the darn review! Sheesh!

Anyway, a few other characters arrive on the scene. We see another one of Catherine's neighbors, the overly friendly John Edson (Scott Valentine desperately looking for a career after ""Family Ties""), and the two strike up one of those friendships we the viewer recognize as having the potential for romantic interaction. The movie also introduces us to the blazingly hot Sally Anne (Brittney Powell), daughter of the aforementioned Philips and the future babysitter of the enigmatic Joey. What else? Oh, remember that dame wreaking bloody havoc at the playground in the opening scenes of the movie? We learn she's out tracking down the monstrous babies from the first film. Her mission apparently involves engaging in open gun battles with the cops in the middle of hospital maternity wards. Fun. Her goals also involve tracking down one Joey Moore. In the meantime, Catherine has other problems. Like explaining to Sally Anne why she keeps Joey locked up in his bedroom. She also must hide what happens to a couple of meddling social workers when the two nosy nellies run straight into the jaws of an angry Joey. And Joey? By the time we see him, fully revealed to the camera, we're laughing too hard to take any of this seriously.

Does a movie like ""The Unborn"" really need a sequel? Already a belated ripoff of Larry Cohen's ""It's Alive"" series, Corman obviously saw dollar signs in resurrecting the baby run amok genre. The first installment worked well. Brooke Adams did a good job, and we also got to see Kathy Griffin's character murdered with a hammer. Sadly, ""The Unborn II"" doesn't achieve these Olympian heights. For one thing, the film just looks cheap. It has that sparse look one sees in most of Corman's 1990s and early 2000s efforts, a look that's one step above camcorder filmmaking but far short of the rich tapestry of colors and textures filmmakers achieve with properly developed celluloid. The performances and dialogue also leave a lot to be desired. In other words, both elements tank badly. They really need to quit writing scripts on toilet paper over there at Corman headquarters. Lastly, the special effects look appallingly awful. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when the film unveiled Joey for the first time. The kid has a noggin that looks like a globe covered with flesh colored newspaper. It's that bad, folks. Just appalling. He looks like something I would've created in grade school--while tripping acid.

Supplements. You're kidding, right? Expect a full frame picture transfer, a trailer for this film, and a few previews for other House of Corman extravaganzas. Expect much less in the audio and picture quality department. Like I said earlier, the movie looks cheap. So why should you watch ""The Unborn II""? Well, if you saw the first one and really liked it, you should definitely check out this inferior sequel just to see how far an idea can fall in the hands of Roger Corman. You can also watch the film with a few friends and do your own MST3K treatment. That's always fun, and quite easy to do with this movie. Finally, you should watch this flick just to see the opening scenes on the playground. It's nasty stuff executed in a way that will make you flinch. Too bad the film couldn't live up to the high expectations it set for itself at the beginning. I'll give ""The Unborn II"" three stars because of that scene, Sally Anne, and the hilarious hijinks that kept me laughing throughout.",1179619200,3,5856,4.8942598187311175
7991129,5,B00009L4TW,"I ask, could ""The Unborn II"" be the greatest movie of all time?  Let me describe the opening scene and I think you can answer that question for yourself.

We open to a nice little playground in what you assume to be a pleasant suburban neighborhood.  We see children playing and loving parents watching over them.  A woman in a maroon suit walks up, slowly scanning the scene with cold eyes.

A mother nearby makes small talk but the woman in the maroon jacket barely speaks and instead concentrates on the children.  She leaves the mother and asks a small girl if she can point out Robby Brown.  The little girl points to a boy sitting alone in the sandbox.

The woman approaches and asks coldly, ""Robby Brown?""  He turns, startled, and looks up into the face of the woman towering above him.  His vacant stare seems to project his confusion and fear from being addressed in such a manner.

Without saying a word the woman in maroon reaches into her bag, pulls out a large hand gun, and shoots little Robby Brown.

In the face.

Twice.

The movie only gets better from there. Take the time to enjoy this modern masterwork.  Thank you, and god bless.",1158105600,9,1150,4.48792270531401
