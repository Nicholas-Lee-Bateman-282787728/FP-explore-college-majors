20332,5,0767811089,"One of my absolute favorites, this gem of a film is a comedy, a drama, a romance and a fantasy film all rolled into one.  Combined with the twisted & irreverent filmmaking style of Terry Gilliam (""12 Monkeys""  and ""Time Bandits"") this film is not for everyone, but for those  who like something different and maybe even a little magical, you can't go  wrong with this one. Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges are two men from two  different worlds, but both lost and in pain.  Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda  Plummer are the women in their lives.  When circumstanes bring them  together, they are able to save one another.  A sadly overlooked film  filled with wonderment and, in the end, joy.",938304000,7,684,4.616666666666666
20333,5,0767811089,"I must admit my heart did a little flip-flop when I found out I could finally own my favorite movie of all time on DVD as of Feb 16th. If you are a new owner od a DVD player and you are still at that ""Should I rent  it or buy it"" phase- I must beg you to consider this film as an  addition to your growing library. It is by and far the best film to  enrapture the Arthurian legend amid the urban squalor of everyday modern  existence, thereby folding royalty among the peasants and turning a well  known modern metropolis into a serfdom. Fisher King is brilliantly acted  and structured from beginning to end, and makes for a fantastic evening of  deep entertainment. Gilliam is a visual genuis and his thoughts and  impressions flow onto the screen with carisma and charm unsurpassed in  anything he's ever done. Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams give the  performances of their careers, and you are not let down by any type of  conventional plot. A thoroughly satisfying film. One that belongs in any  serious film fanatics' library.",919123200,,1033,4.524324324324325
20334,5,0767811089,"This is my favorite movie. It acknowledges the suffering and darkness that fills our lives because of both our personal failings and the violence others inflict upon us; at the same time it shows how the mystery of  compassion and forgiveness can bring about an experience of profound  communion with others.  The only movie I've ever seen that I would  characterize as authentically ""Eucharistic"" in spirit.",918691200,2,408,5.136363636363637
20335,1,0767811089,"The Fisher King is a disappointing myriad of chaotic film sequences, uninspiring characters, and a deliberately meaningless title.  It mixes random delusion/fantasy sequences in a pale attempt to feign creativity.  Viewers seeking a sensible, straightforward plot will be sorely  disappointed.  Viewers who prefer creative/fantasy movies will likely be  insulted by this poor attempt to fill their needs.  The Fisher King's only  value is that of a poor abstract painting; people can look at it and  pretend to each other that they ""understand the deeper meaning"".  This film is about as deep as a cookie sheet.",913075200,13,611,5.347368421052631

20429,1,0767811089,"My low rating is not for the movie, to which I had a mixed but mostly positive reaction. Rather, it is for the Amazon Video HD file. There was subtle but constant stuttering with almost all movement in this film. It is most evident with lateral motion, such as with pans and tracking shots, but it is also incredibly obvious during the final credit crawl. I even googled whether Terry Gilliam intentionally played with frame rates  in this film because it looked so strange. I reset my Roku stick, and my incredibly fast Internet connection was working perfectly. I also tested other HD content on the same app using the same device, and it looked just fine. The Fisher King images were high-definition but jittery, making me think the file itself is flawed.",1516579200,,758,4.6992481203007515

20492,5,0767811089,"This film never fades from incredible. It brings so many talents together and tells a tale that should never be forgotten. This was recognized at the onset as great, but unless it is watched, it will be forgotten. If you need to remember how great film can be, watch this film. Robin Williams...what a talent! Even before the Big Lebowski, Jeff Bridges shows he knows how to act. But without Terry Gilliam's direction, who else could bring it all alive??",1495843200,,454,4.6875

There is a lot going on in this movie and should be watched several times, at least.  Great cameo by Tom Waitts too.  Great acting overall, and great cinematography.

This is a serious, dramatic film, with humor mixed in.  This is a movie that should make you think and feel, and a must have in any film buffs collection.",1494720000,3,443,4.475

20564,5,0767811089,"The Fisher King is another great symbolic film directed by Terry Gilliam, the other I love being The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, which shares some elements with The Fisher King. ""The Fisher King"" is a reference to an Arthurian story, which has numerous versions. Essentially, the king is a seeker of truth or enlightenment (the Holy Grail stands for that) who has a wound that will not heal- until he does this and that. The same sort of healing trajectory is found in transformational/alchemical ""fairy tales"". Using my Jungian symbolic perspective, the character Parry is an inner figure of Jack's, some aspect of his psyche who was traumatized once, likely in childhood. The Red Knight is the pain, the suffering, the anger, and the fear that was born of the trauma.
Like many of these stories I call ""male enlightenment films"", Jack transforms from cruel and selfish and emotionally retarded, to a joyous, heart-connected fellow, for he has integrated the heart-centered aspects of his being which were formerly modeled by Parry and Anne. In Arthurian terms, he has vanquished the haunting aspect of his experience which the Red Knight represented. The journey from here to there is full of lots of great symbolism; those old Arthurian tales are totally symbolic, of course. Gilliam and writer LaGravenese had fun with Pinocchio, with cups and wounds, with mirrors and cosmetic face masks, and nakedness, that symbol of authenticity easily understood by all.
I did review this film in more detail in my e book here on Amazon titled Poetry in Motion: 19 Symbolic Reviews of Transformational Film by Colleen Szabo. Link below. All you need to download an e book is a computer, no other device required.

20571,4,0767811089,"Quirky movie, but very realistic portrayal of mental illness produced by personal trauma. The juxtaposition and interplay between Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams is poignant and unexpected, if not surprising. But if not for the lack of negative response to obvious stalking, the movie holds together. William's love for his beloved is as delightful as is his demons are unexpected given their source. And in the end: boy gets girl and girl gets boy is predictable, but acceptable.",1481587200,4,480,5.166666666666667

Both men acted their hearts out and their asses off, as did the entire cast and crew, by the way the movie came out. If you've never seen this, have a heart, brain, and soul, you need to see this.
Best part: While it's got religious overtones, it's NOT a religious movie which is what chased me away when it came out. Though, if you want it to be, I'm sure the religious can find something to worship in it, Williams and Bridges are pretty godlike in this one. ;)",1478649600,4,574,4.133928571428571

Upon waking from the coma he becomes a knight in search of the Holy Grail which he knows the whereabouts of. He enlists Bridges as ""Jack"" to get the Grail as he is in fear of confronting the Red Knight, but is in love with a girl he believes he will win with the Grail. A comic/tragic love story with a Happy Ending and a host of wacky characters and dangers, the movie, directed by Monty Python alum Terry Gillam, is a joy to watch.",1473897600,2,739,4.481481481481482

Performances by Williams, Jeff Bridges, Mercedes Ruehl (who won an Oscar for this film) and Annabeth (?) Gish are all wonderful. And the story and visuals are unique. The scene in Grand Central Station where Robin is following Gish as people dance around them is magnificent. And the closing scene is also fun. There are just so many ""neat"" moments in this film.

21014,5,0767811089,"I think FISHER KING may be the late Robin Williams's best performance on-screen -- which, as everyone knows, says a lot. Williams, when called upon, could be relied on to give a kick-ass dramatic performance -- as he does in the American remake of INSOMNIA, as he does in ONE HOUR PHOTO, and as he does here. From the mind of film genius Terry Gilliam (Monty Python, Brazil, Baron Munchausen, etc.) comes this tale of two men helping each other find the way out of crippling grief. At times funny, but often with the surreal images that made BRAZIL such a masterwork, this is one of the best portraits of the psyche of fear and grief that you're ever likely to see. And one of the most beautifully-shot films. And then there's Jeff Bridges! These two genius actors spark each other on and on.",1424822400,2,792,4.506944444444445

21060,5,0767811089,"If anyone prior to this doubted that either Williams or Bridges could do fully fleshed out characters with dramatic gravitas, this movie answered that question once and for all. Boy, could the two of them do it all in the movies. Bridges plays an obnoxious radio tv talk guy who makes a life altering mistake on his show. Robin Williams plays Parry, the homeless man who in the circle of life is caught in the rays of what radiates out from that mistake. They will create something positive out of this but it is coming out of the darkest of the dark to do so. Either Williams or Bridges should have won the Oscar for this, perhaps both, but they did not. It did show the movie going world though that Bridges had been consistently underestimated up to that point and he began getting parts instead worthy of his talent. The female roles were fully realized by Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer and they are beacons for coming home and out of the darkness and into the light. One of my favorite movies with favorite performance from all four actors.

21183,5,0767811089,"Another beautiful movie starring Robin Williams. Jeff Bridges plays a popular late night radio DJ/talk show host named Jack. Jeff's performance in this movie is amazing. Robin Williams plays a homeless man named Parry. Something Jack says on-air causes one of his callers to commit a fatal mass shooting in a restaurant. Jack had been on top of the world with stylish clothes, a beautiful apartment, and, obviously, a good job. Once the radio station realizes that Jack's comments instigated the mass murder, he loses his job and goes into a downward spiral. Finally, Jack is ready to jump off a bridge and who stops him from doing this? The homeless man Parry of course. Another twist is that Parry was in the restaurant the night of the shooting and his wife was killed right in front of Parry. Parry does rescue Jack and they strike up a friendship after Jack puts the pieces together that Parry was in the restaurant. Robin's performance is painful to watch because he does such a good job portraying human suffering. Robin could have won an Oscar for his performance. The Fisher King is another movie that will make people cry. Some people, including me, may feel that the movie is too heartwrenching to watch more than once.",1412553600,,1230,4.752336448598131

21235,4,0767811089,"THE FILM: While not the absolute best I've seen from Robin Williams, Jeff Bridges or Terry Gilliam, THE FISHER KING is still wonderful tale of friendship, love, and loss. Jeff Bridges plays Jack Lucas, a rather callous shock jock who makes an offhand remark that influences a listener to commit a murder-suicide. Robin Williams is Parry, a homeless man whose life was severely affected by that act. As the film progresses, the two of them come together and help each other deal with loss in their own ways. While the theme of loss, and accepting it in order to move on, is a subject that's been shown many times in film, Terry Gilliam finds a way to make it seem fresh with his wit and unmistakable cinematic style, even though it's toned down here considerably. Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams also give outstanding performances that are properly nuanced and full of emotional depth. There is also several really funny scenes which showcase Robin Williams gift for humor, despite not being as manic as he can be. Here, his ""insanity"" is a cover for some deeply held emotion regarding his past (not unlike many comics in real life whose gift for humor masks very real pain). Jeff Bridges also has pain of his own, in the form of guilt over that incident which resulted from his on-air comment. The journey on which these two go, represented in Parry's mind by a quest for a holy grail (Monty Python?) was fascinating and gripping. Gilliam also gets to indulge in some fantastical imagery, as Parry imagines himself a knight with an evil, fiery Red Knight in pursuit of him. However, despite whatever trappings the story might come in, the performances are what make the film. Also of note is Mercedes Ruehl, who also turns in an outstanding showing as Jack's live-in girlfriend (technically, he's her live-in boyfriend). I read online that she won a Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance, and from what I witnessed she definitely deserved it. If there's one issue I take with the story, it's that it perpetuates the movie stereotype of the wise and wacky homeless man, even though Robin Williams plays it so well. There were also a few scenes that could have been trimmed. But overall, it was a pleasantly satisfying experience that spoke to me on a personal level, and that I enjoyed watching.

THE DISC: This Blu-ray release from Image Entertainment has superb image and audio quality, but no extra material outside of a theatrical trailer. Could be better, but I'm not complaining too much.

OVERALL: This is yet another excellent film with a wonderfully moving performance by Robin Williams and the auteur sensibility of visionary director Terry Gilliam. While sorely lacking in bonus features, the film is still good enough to stand on its own. Recommended purchase.",1410480000,4,2778,4.858649789029536

21258,5,0767811089,"Ever since Robin Williams passing, I have revisited his older, more dramatic, often over looked roles. I have since watched Insomnia, One Hour Photo, What Dreams May Come and I think the strongest of all his dramatic performances, The Fisher King. Much like Jim Carrey, Williams understands the darker side of human emotion, but often times chose more comedic, uplifting roles probably to escape from his personal demons. But never was there a more personal, more touching, more emotionally ravaging performance by Williams than that of Parry in Terry Gilliam's secondary masterpiece to Brazil. I will spare the summary of the films story, as it is described above and if you are here reading reviews I'm sure you have read it. All I really want to say is that you really should purchase this film if you ever were, still are or have recently become a fan of Robin's more dramatic roles. He gets lost in this film, you forget for a while that this is the man who ever donned drag to play a British housekeeper, or created slapstick out of green flying rubber, or outran stampedes of CGI animals.

21298,5,0767811089,"Ive been finding myself reflecting on Robin Williams since the news of his tragic suicide broke a few days ago.  Its always moments like this when you start to appreciate what is lost, and when you seriously examine Williamss work, its instantly apparent what tremendous talent the man had.  As an improvisational comic, Williams was without equal.  The man was lighting fast, and could instantaneously invent comedic routines far superior to the ones other established comics refined and revised for years.  I imagine Williamss mind started to run hot as he hit the full stride of his stream-of-consciousness mania; his words came out so loud and fast that it got almost to the point of being intimidating.  However, no matter how crazy his commentary became it was always clear that there was a sincere humanitarian at the controls  and he never descended into insulting individuals or generalized groups.  Williams found enough absurdity in the human condition, and though that does seem like an eternal wellspring of inspiration, its surprising how many comedians have to cheat to get attention.

In many ways, Williamss talent didn't exactly mesh with the silver screen, but he had so much obvious ability that you had to find a way to use him or you weren't being true to the concept of art.  In some films he gives tremendous reserved performances such as in Good Will Hunting, but I think that unless directors can utilize the mania, they really aren't taking full advantage of what Williams can do.

The Fisher King turned out to be a pitch perfect project for a guy like Williams.  In it, he plays a regular man who has his life torn apart by tragedy.  The tragedy transforms him from a mild-mannered professor to an indigent who lives in a junkyard, dresses in rags, and claims to hear the voices of fairies.  The characters name is Parry, and he seems to constantly be in the throes of a desperate good mood which his obviously nothing more than a cracked mask intended to cover up his spiritual torment (you can see why Williams would be convincing in a part like this).

Parry thinks of himself as a knight, and he patrols the city streets in a personal quest to help those in need.  As long as he is able to live in his illusion, he is more or less a functional person.  However, if something happens which allows him to settle down and remember how regular people behave (falling in love for example), he is tormented by a vision of a red knight which chases him back to insanity.

The Fisher King is a lovely story of redemption and healing.  The title is from Arthurian legend and Parry (his name should evoke Percivalor Parcival depending on the translation you read) tells the story of the Fisher King in one of his moments of lucidity.  Parry inherently knows that he needs the grail to be healed, so the film becomes a grail quest narrative.

The Fisher King was directed by Terry Gilliam, himself the most manic member of Monty Python, and I think he was the perfect director to work with Williams.  The performance Gilliam gets out of Williams is manic, but restrained, and hits all the right notes.  I could see how other directors might be intimidated by Williams and not give him a safe environment in which to create  but Gilliam clearly knew what he was getting with Williams, and the pairing is inspired.

It really is a beautiful film, and I especially love the urban fantasy element.  Theres a reason that fantasy remains such a popular genre in the age of cell phones, the internet, and laptop computers.  The image of an armored man riding a horse in defense of good or as an emissary of evil is powerful, and Gilliam manages to explore the impact those images have on our collective psyche.  The visual side of the film is stunning, but The Fisher King achieves its power thanks to Robin Williams through whom the audience perceives terrible torment inflicted upon tremendous humanity  just like in real life.  Go watch The Fisher King or watch it again if youve already seen it.  Its a fitting tribute to a great talent, and it will make you happy...a little sad too...but mostly happy, which is good.

Robin Williams will be missed.",1407974400,9,4169,4.68543956043956
21299,5,0767811089,"I have always loved this movie, and am glad so many others - Amazon reviewers - do also.
Still coming to terms with Robin William's death (it's hard even to type that) I reflect that The Fisher King tells us more about the man himself than we ever knew.
His (Parry's) struggle throughout the movie to find meaning, to find a place in the world, to find friendship and to find love seem to add an autobiographical dimension to the movie at a level that I have not before known.
So I will be watching it, when I can bear to, and reflecting on the life and genius of this fragile man.
As an aside, I will also watch ""Moscow on the Hudson,"" another of his lesser-known movies. It is much lighter than The Fisher King, and I will need that.

21331,3,0767811089,"It's been some years since I've seen this film, and my feelings about it have changed.

Richard LeGravenese's rich script (which rightly received an Oscar nomination) is ultimately undone by an ending that's sentimental to the point of being maudlin. We do not need to see Robin Williams directing his fellow patients singing ""How About You?"", nor do we need to see him and Jeff Bridges lying in Central Park watching fireworks.

The ending is so /excessively/ upbeat that it makes the darkness that preceded it seem a dream -- but it wasn't. The question of how Williams feels about Bridges' indirect responsibility for his wife's murder isn't addressed, nor is Bridge's need to ask for Williams' forgiveness. The ""happy-happy joy-joy"" ending seems designed to cover up these things.

It has a quirky story filled with eccentric characters that centers around the power of friendship and redemption.

21423,5,0767811089,"I won't attempt to repeat what most of the five-star reviews have said (often, most eloquently) about this film.

I wholeheartedly agree with those reviewers who have pointed out that the real depths of this film come from its archetypal and mythological undercurrents.

With this in mind, let me just add one more twist which none of the film's professional critics seems to have noticed. (It is possible that one of the Amazon reviewers has already flagged this up, but to check this would require me to read scores of reviews, so if someone's already pointed this out then - in the immortal words of Jack Lucas ..... ""forgive me!"")

When I first saw the film I couldn't fathom why Parry was chasing after the gawky, clumsy, nerdy Lydia. OK, so the guy has gone crazy, but surely it's more likely that he would be obsessed with a lady who reminded him of his murdered wife.

Then I watched the film again. I spotted something in the news report about the deranged killer, Edwin Malnick. Not only was he described as ""a quiet man who lived alone .... you hardly knew he was there"", but the mugshot shows him wearing - if you look carefully - a hairstyle that looks suspiciously like a wig. Almost as if the writer, or director, wanted us to notice it. Mousy-coloured hair, heavily flopping to one side. Who did that remind me of?

Suddenly I ""got it"". While Jack Lucas is on his quest to forgive himself, Parry is on a quest to forgive his wife's killer. Now, he can't do that in person, because Edwin Malnick is also dead. But he CAN choose another solitary, nerdy loser - Lydia, she of the mousy hair flopping to one side - and give her the unconditional love that the lonely Malnick never had.

So - here's yet another piece of symbolism in this highly psychological/mythological work of cinematic art.

Having said all the above, ""The Fisher King"" also works beautifully as a love story, but hardly the typical ""handsome guy meets gorgeous girl"" variety. Here it's streetwise gal + drunken has-been; homeless nutcase + gawky loser.

And it's this that makes the romantic scenes so powerful. Parry's declaration of love to Lydia is the only love scene in any movie that always brings a tear to my eye and a lump to my throat. (And it's Plummer's acting, more than Williams', that moves me - she brilliantly conveys the emotions of a socially awkward woman who, having convinced herself that she is to be denied love forever, suddenly and unexpectedly finds it. A beautiful moment.)",1368316800,5,2485,4.631818181818182

I watched it again for the first time in 20 years the other night and turned it off after 45 minutes. It was a dire, pretentious, shallow misfiring mess and in hindsight looks like little more than a vehicle for Williams to put in yet another one of his overly energetic ""Look at me look at me!"" performances and use lots of different voices and irritating facial expressions.

From this point on Bridges character is having a battle with his inner demons and his rough personality and it all ends up becoming a quest for the grail and to do what is right.

Terry Gilliam's THE FISHER KING (1991) stars Jeff Bridges, Robin Williams, Mercedes Ruel and Amanda Plummer (with a major assist from Michael Jeter). Although there's some genuine belly laughs in it, the story is primarily a melancholy one of two men tortured by a tragedy that affected both their lives in very different ways.

Bridges is a popular NYC radio show host whose denunciation of yuppies to a regular caller pushes the man to kill people at an upscale eatery. As a result, Bridges loses his job, his GF and a fabulous Manhattan apartment, is alcoholic and now lives with (and preys on the affections of) the owner of a video rental store (Ruehl).

Williams, in perhaps his greatest screen role, is a college professor who saw his wife murdered by a shotgun blast from the crazy talk show caller. After some months of hospitalization for catatonia, he becomes a delusional street person, and a self-appointed do-gooder knight named Parry (for Parsifal) who hallucinates that little people tell him where the Holy Grail may be found.

These two meet by accident when a suicidal Bridges is being attacked by street thugs and Williams rescues him. They become unlikely friends. Thus, the former celebrity learns first hand about homeless people and mental illness. He also discovers why his new friend is often so deranged, and feels he caused the death of this unfortunate fellow's wife.

Plummer, who's always great at playing quirky characters, is a klutzy working gal that Williams admires from afar. Bridges believes that if he can bring Williams and Plummer together, somehow he can also help himself. He tries ""awarding"" a skeptical Plummer some free rentals at Ruehl's video store, plus the use of a VCR. To convince her to accept this prize, Bridges enlists the help of Jeter, another street person who was once a stock theater actor.

This leads to a great elevator scene with Bridges and Jeter, who's all decked out like a showgirl. He warms up to sing for mousey Plummer at the office where she works by hitting these impossibly squeaky high notes, which annoys Bridges, who tells Jeter to stop. Instead, he responds with a line and some behavior that is so funny, you just may continue laughing through the rest of the scene. Leaving the elevator, Jeter triumphantly exclaims ""I made you laugh!""

He surely did. I really miss Michael Jeter.

Despite an often dark plot, THE FISHER KING is ultimately a story of hope, redemption and second chances. I so love this movie. It's one of my favorites.",1355788800,,2733,4.9004329004329

21471,5,0767811089,"Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges) is one of those outrageous disc jockeys and radio talk guys who says crude things for the effect, without figuring what it might do. One of his callers is pretty clearly on the edge of a breakdown, and Jack heartlessly pushes him over. The guy gets a rifle and goes into a disco and shoots it up, killing several people and injuring several more before killing himself.

Fast forward a few years. Jack has been wallowing in self-pity and depression, guilt, and his girlfriend Anne's (Mercedes Ruehl) apartment. He gets stinking drunk one night and gets attacked by bashers who pour gasoline all over him and are about to light him on fire when he is rescued by a band of crazed homeless people led by a self-appointed knight named Parry (Robin Williams). Parry takes the injured Jack back to his digs in the boiler room of the apartment building where he used to live with his beautiful wife before the tragedy. Turns out Parry's wife was one of those killed in the shoot-up by the radio listener.

Thus begins a very, very strange friendship, where Jack figures if he can help Parry in some way, he will be able to put his guilt behind him and get on with his life. But of course it's not as simple as his first idea, which was to stuff some money in Parry's hand. He promptly gives it to another homeless person, and Jack objects. But Parry has no real use for money. He has, however, plenty of use for a friend.

It's a heart-warming and also heart-breaking story. I will say only that it has a happy ending, but the fun is getting there. Williams, as always, has some great comic lines, and Jeff Bridges makes a great straight man for him.

If you want to ""feel good"" on a substantive level, if the depth of human experience has meaning to you, please, do yourself a favor and buy this to watch it time and time again and to share it with friends and relatives.  Yes, it is filled with pain, but the ""happy ending"" is well worth paying for the privilege of watching truly gifted actors creating a world in which we all live at one time or another.....and some of us actually learn and appreciate the lessons life teaches despite our desire to be self-important and self-centered.

It's after Baron Muchhausen & before (my favorite) 12 Monkeys.  I am a Terry Gilliam film fan, but not that I think all of his work is good. [The Brothers Grimm is just plain terrible]

PROs:
Outstanding direction by Terry Gilliam adapting a story he did not write
Robin Williams & Jeff Bridges give excellent performances & have on-screen chemistry
Robin Williams naked in Central Park, rubbing his butt on the ground:  ""You know why dogs do this?  Because it feels good!""
Decent side love stories
Gilliam's continuing themes of fantasy & redemption
Drunken Jeff Bridges recommending a porno to a woman while working at a VHS video store (reminds me of Clerks a little)
Gilliam does a good job of roping in Williams' antics in the second half so he doesn't overwhelm the story

CONs:
Ok image transfer to Blu Ray, but pretty bare bones.  (two stars removed).

21501,5,0767811089,"Terry Gilliam's THE FISHER KING (1991) stars Jeff Bridges, Robin Williams, Mercedes Ruel and Amanda Plummer (with a major assist from Michael Jeter). Although there's some genuine belly laughs in it, the story is primarily a melancholy one of two men tortured by a tragedy that affected both their lives in very different ways.

Bridges is a popular NYC radio show host whose denunciation of yuppies to a regular caller pushes the man to kill people at an upscale eatery. As a result, Bridges loses his job, his GF and a fabulous Manhattan apartment, is alcoholic and now lives with (and preys on the affections of) the owner of a video rental store (Ruehl).

Williams, in perhaps his greatest screen role, is a college professor who saw his wife murdered by a shotgun blast from the crazy talk show caller. After some months of hospitalization for catatonia, he becomes a delusional street person, and a self-appointed do-gooder knight named Parry (for Parsifal) who hallucinates that little people tell him where the Holy Grail may be found.

These two meet by accident when a suicidal Bridges is being attacked by street thugs and Williams rescues him. They become unlikely friends. Thus, the former celebrity learns first hand about homeless people and mental illness. He also discovers why his new friend is often so deranged, and feels he caused the death of this unfortunate fellow's wife.

Plummer, who's always great at playing quirky characters, is a klutzy working gal that Williams admires from afar. Bridges believes that if he can bring Williams and Plummer together, somehow he can also help himself. He tries ""awarding"" a skeptical Plummer some free rentals at Ruehl's video store, plus the use of a VCR. To convince her to accept this prize, Bridges enlists the help of Jeter, another street person who was once a stock theater actor.

This leads to a great elevator scene with Bridges and Jeter, who's all decked out like a showgirl. He warms up to sing for mousey Plummer at the office where she works by hitting these impossibly squeaky high notes, which annoys Bridges, who tells Jeter to stop. Instead, he responds with a line and some behavior that is so funny, you just may continue laughing through the rest of the scene. Leaving the elevator, Jeter triumphantly exclaims ""I made you laugh!""

He surely did. I really miss Michael Jeter.

21527,5,0767811089,"There are few films that feel as layered as `The Fisher King'.  There is a lot here to process, and sometimes it can feel as though you've got it all and then it hits you that you haven't even begun to scratch the surface yet.  The film is simply stunning, and certainly one of a kind.  In ways it reminds me of `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.  It is unique, visual and deeply moving, and like that '04 masterpiece, `The Fisher King' is a film that stays with you, a film that unveils itself to you slowly; bit by bit.

The film opens with shock jock Jack Lucas verbally attacking a man to the point where he takes a loaded shotgun into a bar, opens fire and then kills himself.  Emotionally devastated by the act, Jack turns into a reclusive shell of a man, resorting to alcohol and basically living off of his girlfriend, Anne.  After a night of drinking, Jack finds himself at the mercy of some thugs who think he is homeless only to have his life saved by a crazy man named Parry who happens to think he is a knight on a mission from God to find the Holy Grail.  Jack soon learns that Parry is the widower of one of the victims in the bar shooting.  Feeling almost obligated to make things right, Jack follows Parry around, looking for ways to help restore his sanity.

As it turns out, Jack is the one who needs saving.

Tackling the weighty subjects of loss, guilt, insanity, alcoholism, redemption, selfishness, selflessness and love, `The Fisher King' does a major juggling act, and it pulls it off flawlessly.  With the right touches of comedic timing, the film flourishes with emotional longevity and comes across relatable and poignant.

And the acting is a goldmine.

I have friends, who feel that Robin Williams is over-the-top here, and for the first half of the film I understand where they are coming from, but he completely pulls everything in towards the end and fully develops this heartbreaking character.  The way he shifts from crazed lunatic to seemingly stable (the scene where he attempts to mate with Anne) to tragically haunted is just mesmerizing.  Williams certainly has his own comedic style, and some find it blatantly irritating, but he really makes this character his own.  His more emotional and dramatic scenes are simply flawless.  His two big monologues (the `Fisher King' story and his ""I love you"" scene with Plummer) are two of the films big highlights.  Just as good, if not even better, is Jeff Bridges.  I actually feel that Bridges gives the better performance here because he doesn't have any gimmicks to rely on.  He doesn't have the `crazy' to draw attention his way.  He simply has to construct this man's unrelenting guilt from scratch and convince us that he is emotionally crippled because of his failure as a human being.  He does that effortlessly.

That scene, in the hospital, tears in his eyes...UGH.

Now, Oscar hardly gets things right in my book, and this year was not an exception (Foster for Best Actress?  Palance for Supporting Actor?) but one thing that they got SO right was Mercedes Ruehl for Supporting Actress.  Her performance here is simply stunning.  She has so much attitude and charisma, but it isn't just a showy gimmick with her.  She has embodied Anne with so much heart and soul and emotional complexity.  Her breakdown towards the films end is the single greatest scene of the entire year.

In the end, I totally recommend this amazing film.  This is a stunning and thought provoking film that will break and then mend your heart.  There is depth here that is a rarity in this day and age.  The moral of this film certainly lies within Jack's shift from selfish to selfless, and that statement is strong and unforgettable.

With stunning performances, sharp direction and a one-of-a-kind script, `The Fisher King' is easily one of the best films of the 90's.",1269388800,3,3845,4.6711309523809526

 Superb, 30 Dec 2007

 Superb. There have been very few movies that I can say, hand on heart, that have ever touched a nerve with me, but this is  did. If anyone but Williams and Bridges had played these roles, the film would have dragged on and on. Bridges is excellent as the ex shock jock, trying to make some restitution for the consequences of his 'actions'. Williams should be given some kind of Knighthood - the man is flawless as he tries to claw his way out of his personal madness, his grief and guilt. The support cast are pretty fine, too. Excuisite.

Williams should have played his part with some degree of complexity, but all that comes out is tics and showiness.  What a shame.  The script is uneven, in parts very insightful and in other places simply stupid (the dinner with the four main characters is just awful).

The movie floats over a lot of ground and is overly long, but it's a showcase for Williams's looniness.

21576,5,0767811089,"The only reason this movie doesn't get five stars is because of the occasional over-acting of Robin Williams.  Williams, who so often gets out of control and overshadows the other actors, does exercise enough restraint in this film to make his character sufficiently rounded and believable as an ex-professor tormented by the tragedy that took his wife's life.

Jeff Bridges portrays the darkness in his character, Jack, magnificently.  Jack, a radio ""shock jock"" sets into motion a tragic event that destroys his career and sends him hurtling toward self-destruction.  ""Do you ever get the feeling,"" he asks, ""you're being punished for your sins?""

In this sense, THE FISHER KING is like the dark underbelly of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  Jack doesn't discover he's done good in the world, but realizes his own capacity for evil.  He wants to atone, but he wants to do it the easy way.  As he tearfully relates to his energetic and devoted lover (Mercedes Reuhl), ""I wish I could just pay my ticket and go home.""  And he does try various means of atonement until at last he realizes he must give his all in order to find grace.  Bridges is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood.  His acting in both STAR MAN and THE FISHER KING is amazing; he brings out just the right balance of humor and tragedy in his characters.

I've seen THE FISHER KING many times.  Each time I reflect on how much our actions matter.  In a now famous speech, Bobby Kennedy once spoke of sending out a tiny ""ripple of hope,"" of how that ripple would spread and grow.  THE FISHER KING warns us that negative energy acts the same way, spreading, growing.

And, the movie warns us, what goes around comes around.  I can't express the theme of the movie any more simply than that.",1146355200,11,1756,4.631067961165049
21577,5,0767811089,"This film is Director Terry Gilliam's best for one simple reason: it is his most successful marriage of modern story to mythic content.  Just as the first three Star Wars movies (Episodes IV-VI) succeeded in captivating the hearts and minds of its viewers on a deep, spiritual level amidst the revolutionary special effects, Gilliam has taken a segment of New York city's extremes and has recasted the Holy Grail adventure in modern, well-tailored clothes.  This movie serves as, perhaps, the best motion picture example of the Jungian theory of individuation I have seen.  The main characters map nicely to the ego-shadow-anima trio with Jack (Jeff Bridges) playing an ego maniac who suffers a Icarian fall and is brought to face his shadow, Perry (Robin Williams), who is anything but egotistical and selfish.  Providing both support and unintentionally inhibiting his progress is his anima/mother figure of a girlfriend Anne (Mercedes Ruehl) whom he must grow both toward and away from as any immature young man must do as he learns to see his significant other as not a replacement mother but soulmate.  But Perry and Anne are also not just projections, but characters with their own depth and complexity each developing a relationship with the other in significant, plot building ways.  Moreso than in any of Gilliam's other films is the stories' plot capable of producing a successful vehicle for Gilliam's well-known propensity for complexity that normally tends to muddy the focus of his efforts to the detriment of the film.

Simultaneous to the achievement of the Grail is Jack's rescuing of his shadow Perry (through his final, willing ego sacrifice) and his readiness to unite on an equal level with his beloved anima Anne.  Truly the Grail represents the achievement of the individuated personality, one that has reconciled ego to shadow to anima all while developing a successful interface (persona) with society that allows the individual to be both successful and moral.  These truths, as elucidated by C.G. Jung, underlie what most draws us to stories and speak to our deepest spiritual needs.  The Fisher King provides a concise outline of this complex process just as clear as the first Star Wars movie presented us with a concise example of Joseph Campbell's hero's journey.  With the obvious mythological references found in most of the content of his other works, this movie must represent an ideal match of story form and content to Gilliam's personal interests.  And could it be (as with Stephen King and his literal monsters that end up detracting from the story) that when Gilliam makes a movie about a basically non-(literally)mythical-magical world, his tendency to overdue his scenes with fantasical, but finally, distracting wonderment is suitably restrained?",1135900800,5,2789,5.173333333333333

The crucial encounter with a dream maker, a lonely person who undertakes an absurd search of the Holy Grail in New York city will be the premise for Terry Gilliam, who consolidated still more his personal status as one of the most prolific and innovative filmmakers of the world.

Outstanding tour de force performances of all the cast: Mercedes Ruehl is superb; Robin Williams delirious as always and Jeff Bridges in the best role of his career until this date.

In my personal list of the top fifty films of the decade there are two works of Gilliam; this one and naturally, 12 Monkees.

A majuscule work that allows not only to reconcile us with the Great Cinema but besides and perhaps most important yet,  with the life, an additional proof the Cinema is an Art by itself, but only when the camera is an eye in the mind of a poet, and this is, precisely the case.

A golden gem!",1132531200,,1106,4.4504950495049505
21580,4,0767811089,"This is a very good DVD with a story that remains fresh. The story is built on the armature of the ancient story of the Fisher King.  The Fisher King is played here by Robin Williams, a former college professor at Hunter College, who's wife is murdered. From this point on he is mentally wounded and appears to much of the world as a homeless mentally ill man.

But we know from the ancient myth that only a Knight who has been cleansed of sin can retreive the Holy Grail and cure the wounded Fisher King. Jeff Bridges plays this part. He is an extremely successful radio personality who is filled with arrogance, contempt for his fellow man, and self absorption. Yet he provokes a listener to commit a violent crime, a mass killing in a dinner club, and this links Jack to to Parry, who lost his wife in the massacre.

Jack is hard-headed however, and he has to sink very low before he can become honest with himself. He loses his job, his sophisticated girl-friend, his wealth, and becomes an alcoholic. At the depths of his fall, he meets Parry, who rescues him from young punks. Jack soon learns that Parry is mentally ill since the death of his wife and Jack decides to move out of his own self pity and attempt to give Parry back his life. Jack is living with a woman, played by Mercedes Ruehl, but he will not open himself to love her since despite her big heart, she is far from the sophisticated women he once courted.

This leads to the most humorous part of the film where Jack tries to fix Parry up with a strange young woman, played by Amanda Plummer, whom Parry has grown to love from a distance. Jack does finally move out of himself and help someone else and sure enough he gets a job opportunity.

The strength of the film is that Jack regresses to his old arrogant self and denies the homeless folks he has befriended and even denies, Mercedes Ruehl, the woman who is devoted to him and helped him arrange the date between Parry and Amanda Plummer's character.

However as sneering Jack rises, Parry falls. He fears rejection and loss (symbolized in the film by the Red Knight)and after being beaten by punks, he goes into a catatonic state. Jack knows that only by obtaining the Holy Grail will the Fisher King be cured.

Much more action occurs and eventually Jack realizes the mistakes he made and the loss of Mercedes Ruehl. He returns to her after obtaining the Grail and we realize he is the Knight that has sought redemption and thus can obtain the Grail to cure the Fisher King.

The drag show performed by Michael Jeter in Amanda Plummer's quite office is worth the price of the video. It is the most over the top scene in this over the top film.

The strength of this really excellent film is that it brings to life an ancient myth that through redemption we become better people and as better people, we can move out of our own self interest and move toward the heroic act of helping another and as we heal, the kingdom becomes a better place for us all.",1127001600,10,2983,4.409090909090909
21581,5,0767811089,"I thought Gilliam's previous movies were just eclectic and I didn't really get them, but ""The Fisher King"" really hit home for me. If you like a movie to have deeper dimensions and allusions than just the central storyline, then this one is for you. I would compare it to what I experienced when reading Shakespeare's works. There is usually a very straightforward story, but the delicious ""a-ha"" moments usually only occur after several reads and serious reflections.

If you don't want depth in a movie, then this movie is fairly entertaining just to see Robin Williams (Parry) rub his toosh across the grass in Central park like you see dogs do from time to time. I've never seen that in a movie before. Not that I look for that, but it clearly demonstrates the sincerity and vulnerability of the characters portrayed.

""The Fisher King"" is not for everyone, but I really like this movie.",1126051200,3,891,4.741935483870968
21582,5,0767811089,"This is a beautifully directed film, as Terry Gilliam exacts bravura performances from the entire cast. This film is a cinematic masterpiece which the viewer will not easily forget.

Jeff Bridges plays Jack, a radio shock jock whose unthinking tirade provokes a caller into a senseless act of violence that culminates in tragedy for a number of faceless New Yorkers. The tragedy derails Jack's career and ends his glitteratti lifestyle. Gone is the fabulous hi-rise apartment, model type girl friend, and high paying media career.

Three years later, Jack finds himself living over a video store in a run down part of town with the video store owner, a blue collar ex-beautician, consummately played by Mercedes Ruehl, in a bravura performance that won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, and deservedly so. Despairing of his life and looking like the bum he believes himself to be, Jack goes down by the water front and toys with the idea of killing himself.

The issue is taken out of his hands when he is accosted by two youths who are sick of ""his kind"", as they apparently mistake him for part of the great unwashed horde of humanity of which they are heartedly sick. They beat him with a baseball bat and douse him from head to toe with gasoline, but just before they ignite him, a knight errant named Parry, touchingly played by Robin Williams, comes to his rescue and saves him from an untimely and excruciating death.

Parry takes Jack to his refuge, and there Parry tells him of his quest for the Holy Grail. A curious bond between the two men begins to form. After Jack leaves, he later returns, curious to know more about this strange, but kindly individual who saved his life. Jack discovers that Parry was a former college professor whose own life drastically changed three years ago, when a caller to a shock jock's show went on a shooting rampage and killed Parry's beloved wife, one of the faceless New Yorkers who for Jack is faceless no more.

Jack, realizing that their lives are intertwined by that tragedy, seeks redemption by trying to help Parry resume a normal life. Clearly mentally ill, Parry's battle with his inner demons is seen through his eyes. The viewer is made to feel the heartbreak and pathos of his fears which are brought to life in the fearsome visage of the Red Knight, a figment of Parry's imagination who appears intermittently throughout the film, until it gives way to Parry's fragmented recollection of that fatal night three years ago. Robin Williams portrayal of Parry is one of the most beautifully nuanced performances ever. That he did not win the Best Actor Oscar for which he was nominated was truly a major faux pas on the part of the Academy.

Jack wades through Parry's fantasies of knights, quests, and the holy grail and discovers that Parry has fallen in love with an unlikely lady, the plainly hapless Lydia, played to perfection by Amanda Plummer. He engineers an unlikely meeting and sets in motion a dazzling sequence of events that ultimately results in his redemption as a human being, and an appreciation of his own lady love.

21584,5,0767811089,"The Fisher King is a movie that I greatly enjoyed rewatching a couple of nights ago. The movie is in my opinion a masterpiece but I'm sure that a lot of people disslike it. It's a very deep movie, and you have to open your mind to it. You have to think about the themes in the movie and think about each character and their personalities in order to enjoy it to the fullest.

Also, if someone tells you that it's a comedy.. Beware!!!! It's not... It's a drama with comedic moments. I guess you could call it a tragicomedy. The movie has some of the best acting that I have ever see.

Robin William's performance is in my opinion probably the best performance EVER in a movie. By an actor or actress. Period.

He will make you laugh, cry and fell terrible pity for him. How he didn't win an academy award or oscar for this is ridiculous.

Jeff Bridges is also amazing and also captivates you. These two leading actors did a fantastic job. And all of the other actors and actresses were also great.

The movie is about Jack Lucas (Jeff Bridges), who's THE MAN. He's a rich radio station guy who's a snob, arrogant, and quite frankly, a character that you don't like. But when he causes an awful tragedy, he is let go and is at the bottom of his ship.

3 years later, he's an alcoholic, and doesn't even work.

He's suicidal and is about to kill himself when some punks grab him and are about to kill him when... Parry (Robin Williams) arrives and saves him. And then Jack finds out about Parry. He's a homeless guy who thinks he's a knight on a quest to find the holy grail. Jack thinks that he's insane. And then he finds out the awful tragedy that happened to Parry. And that tragedy occured becuase of Jack 3 years ago when he was let go.

Jack feels awful and befriends Parry and tries to help him.

The movie is so beautiful because it shows how one homeless man changes a once rich man. Parry transforms Jack into a kind and loving man, whereas at the start, he was a mean, arrogant, snob. The movie is quite frankly absolutely amazing.

The acting and the actual movie are perfect and this deserves to be owned by everyone. The story of the Fisher King in the movie is probably the most interesting and captivating.

Sit back and enjoy this original masterpiece.",1120953600,8,2267,4.348341232227488
21585,5,0767811089,"I hadn't seen this film since it's release in 1991. I borrowed it from a friend's bookcase and watched it last night. I had forgotten how funny, surreal, and moving this film is. Along with FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, this is one of Terry Gilliam's best films. Although, the themes of these two films couldn't be farther apart.

Jeff Bridges is Jack Lucas. A rich radio shock jock who has unwittingly prompted one of his lonely and psychotic listeners to commit a heinous massacre of innocents with a shotgun in a New York cafe. Media attention has caused Jack to become a broke self-loathing alcoholic full of guilt. Robin Williams plays Parry. (Not his real name.) Parry rescues a suicidal Jack from two youths who attempt to burn him alive, believing he's a homeless drunk. Coincidentally, after witnessing the horrifying murder of his fiancee at the hands of the psychotic listener, Parry has become a broken homeless schizophrenic knight-errant in search of the Holy Grail. Is he schizophrenic? It seems God and some small floating fat people are very specific about proving their reality to Parry. They also insist that Jack is the ""ONE"" who can save Parry from the flaming Red Knight; a presence that symbolizes evil and haunts Parry's every waking nightmare. Parry tells Jack that only HE can defeat the Red Knight by stealing the Holy Grail. Jack starts to believe that maybe God is speaking through Parry, but ultimately remains unconvinced of the truth until Jack forces himself to perform an act of love for Parry. And thus begins Jack's redemption through Parry.

What prompted this review are comments made by viewers below. One who falsely claims this film to be meaningless and another who goes on about T.S. Eliot's Wasteland and how there's no ""wisdom or morality"" to be found here. Whatever. The search for the Holy Grail was a mythic quest to find the chalice that Christ used to figuratively share his blood, love, or life force with his disciples during the Last Supper. This film is a wonderful metaphor for the Blood of Christ which signifies to me, redemption through the sacrifice of love. The screenwriter, Richard LaGravenese, does this brilliantly through the symbolism of the Grail. Halfway through the film Parry, who's completely nude, and Jack are lying in Central Park looking up at the stars in the night sky. Parry tells Jack a story, or Zen parable, about a depressed King who is redeemed by the act of a Fool. The Fool doesn't see a king, but only a lonely and troubled man. The King tells the Fool he is thirsty. The Fool offers the King a chalice of cool water that makes the King whole again through his simple act of kindness. At the end, Jack must perform a similar act of kindness and sacrifice to make Parry whole again. THIS IS A BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN MODERN FABLE ABOUT SACRIFICE AND REDEMPTION OF TWO SOULS THROUGH AN UNCONDITIONAL ACT OF LOVE, as it may destroy the beginning of Jack's radio and TV comeback and a return to his old prosperous life.

I do agree with some of the reviewers who claim that even though Mercedes Ruehl won an Oscar for her role as Jack's girlfriend, everyone should have been nominated for a Golden Boy. It also should have won Best Picture. Jeff Bridges is remarkable. Michael Jeter is funny as hell. Amanda Plummer is perfect. And next to AWAKENINGS and THE DEAD POETS SOCIETY, this is truely one of Robin Williams' greatest dramatic roles.

You'll laugh, you'll cry, and if you're thoughtful, you'll be thoroughly moved by this amazing piece of film. Don't listen to the few negative reviews about this film. How can anyone not see the beauty of this story. It's one of the most surreal, uncynical films about THE POWER OF LOVE to ever hit the silver screen. Big budget Hollywood films like this are a rarity. SEE IT NOW and you'll be singing, ""I like New York in June, how about you? I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?""

I really have not seen a movie that I enjoyed on this level in awhile. The performances of both Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams were so fun to watch. It was like they were dancing. I began to think about just how underappreciated I think Jeff Bridges is by most people. I think he does a great job, especially in The Fisher King. I do not feel as though I need to justify Robin Williams' career to any of you...

It was a truly unique film that I enjoyed very much.

Understand that in my euphoric state of review for this movie I am not saying it was otherworldly. It was not the best movie I have ever seen. I do not mean to rave about it. It was simply very good.

Have you ever had a movie that just tapped something loose inside you and gave you that ""hmmm, this is a really good movie"" feeling?

One prime example of why I liked the movie was when Parry sees Lydia come walking through the crowd and all of a sudden all of the hustling and bustling commuters are waltzing around the room. The only two people not caught in dance are Parry and Lydia. Once she is out of his sight, the dancing was no more. It was this little detail set among others of the sort that show that maybe there was a little extra effort put into direction of The Fisher King. I have to say it was appreciated.",1110240000,6,1523,4.066889632107023
21597,1,0767811089,"Yes, I do like art films, non-mainstream films, thought-provoking films - and for those who are still wondering, I am no fan of action or classic hollywood formulas etc. Thus what I have to say is not based on any heartbreak over lack of action or cheesy romance or a simple linear storyline.

No, the real problem is that this movie takes on a number of contemporary topics (such as homelessness, urban isolation, depression, existential ennui, inflammatory talk-radio, ... yes the list is lo..ng) mixes them up with a dash of (obviously labored) enigma and a generous serving of shock-value items (violence, language, nudity, meaningless scenes - Robin Williams obliges competently here) and serves them up with the suggestive lure of slightly non-traditional cinematography (odd angles and extreme close-ups of faces, lips - also overdone) - with the hope that perhaps the pseudo-artsy segment will fall for these gimmicks (and forget that there is really no depth, no original thoughts or insights whatsoever) and hail it as another great, maverick production. (And judging from the nominations, the ploy worked!)

Yes, I like Robin Williams and that is why I fell for it - yet that couldn't alter a fundamentally flawed movie that's trying to exploit our interest in these ""deeper human topics/issues"". Great acting (even if I were to concede that) cannot cover-up for a pointless, phony script.

In summary, DO NOT waste your money (and more importantly TIME) on this one - even if you can see it for free!

Regards all.

21598,5,0767811089,"After reading the first few of these reviews, most of these people are ignorant of what this movie is really about. It does have underlying wisdom and morality, but what you have to remember as you watch this movie is that it is based on a poem by T.S. Eliot: ""The Waste Land."" This is a difficult, obscure poem, but it is about broken lives, selflishness, being a prisoner inside oneself (in ""The Fisher King,"" there are ""prison bars"" everywhere - Jack's studio, Jack's shirt, the building Jack goes into for his interview for the sitcom, etc.), and trying to find meaning in life by doing something for someone else. The movie is named such because ""The Fisher King"" is mentioned in the poem.

There are poignant scenes as well as scenes where Robin Williams it let loose to let his comedic mania shine.

There is 'good wierd' (BRAZIL) and then '[bad] wierd' of which this film is one example.  The story seems tied together in only the loosest meaning of the word. The relationships and coincidences just had me saying ""COME ON!"". The film seems rambling and disjointed-maddeningly so.

The Fisher King is one of the most perfectly executed movies of all time, from the stunning and highly imaginative screenplay to the haunting quality of the direction and the sheer genius of Williams and Bridges, who both turned in the performance of a lifetime. Add to that a supporting cast made in heaven and you basically can't go wrong.
While the film succeeds brilliantly even as a basic story of star-crossed individuals working out their joint karma, it is the concept of the soul's journey homeward that drives the deeper levels of The Fisher King.
As Barbara G. Walker and others have pointed out, the Grail is actually a representation of the Womb of the Great Mother, from which we all came, and to which we shall all return. Like Finnegan and Bloom/Ulysses, The Fisher King's two heroes find salvation in the simplicity of surrender and in the almost Faustian embracing of the Sacred Feminine, as embodied by the two female leads. Carrie Moss's Trinity (The Triple Goddess) also provides this transcendent nurturing to Keanu Reeves's character in The Matrix.

21605,5,0767811089,"In my humble opinion, Terry Gilliam is a genius -- without question one of the most talented and imaginative direcors working in film today.  All of his work -- BRAZIL, TIME BANDITS, 12 MONKEYS, &c -- stands up head and shoulders above almost everything else the motion picture industry spews out, but THE FISHER KING is, I believe, his greatest achievement.
All of the actors are superbly cast -- and each of them throws themselves completely into their assigned roles, to the point of BECOMING their character, which, unless I miss my guess, is what acting is about.  Robin Williams couldn't be more perfect as Perry, the heartsick man with a shattered heart, who has lost his beloved wife in an act of senseless violence.  Jeff Bridges, as the radio 'shock-jock' whose flippant comment to a disturbed listener triggered the shooting, is utterly convincing as the guilt-ridden Jack, locked into a downward spiral, despite the love and care vested on him by his girlfriend (Mercedes Reuhl).  Then there's Amanda Plummer, portraying the hapless, mousy Lydia -- with whom, as soon as he sees her, Williams falls head over heels in love.
There are four characters here in a great deal of pain, each trying in their own way to deal with it -- with varying degrees of succcess.  The way in which their paths cross, and merge, in this story, and the impact they have on each other's lives, makes for one of the most moving tales of love/pain/healing that has ever been brought to the screen.  Gilliam's own unique vision guides it along nicely -- you can see his most obvious touch in the visions experience by Williams of the Red Knight, one of the most frightening apparitions you'll ever run across.
The film vividly shows the torturing, deep pain of utter loss, as well as our vital need to be loved -- and our need to perform acts of kindness, and to seek forgiveness for the wrongs that we have done.  The love story between Williams and Plummer is one of the sweetest -- and most convincing -- ever in a film.  It's enough to give us hope that, truly, anything is possible.  Jack's road to redemption is a rocky one -- as is his own love story, which is bound up with that of Perry and Lydia.  The lengths to which he ultimately will go in order to help his friend are stunning, inspiring, and, most importantly, believable.
THE FISHER KING is a modern masterpiece -- and one that will, I think, continue to move viewers for many, many years.  It's story is a timeless one, skillfully brought to the screen by a modern master.  If you want to show someone how good film can be, show them THE FISHER KING.",1025481600,17,2606,4.592672413793103

Then there is The Fisher King.
No, you won't find King Arthur here.  You won't find Camelot or Guenivere or the Questing Beast.  What you WILL find is the essence of the Grail story.

Neither faces his problems head on.  Each needs another to pave the way to forgiveness, acceptance, and redemption.  The ultimate physical object that leads to this may be a swimming trophy, but it is also the Holy Grail itself.  Why?  Because it truly is, if you only believe.
Along the way you meet the not-so-in-distress damsels (Mercedes Ruehl won an Oscar for best supporting actress; Amanda Plummer, who deserved one as well), the company of knights-errant (the homeless of New York City), an evil Red Knight, two even more evil local toughs, and the false-prophets from the land of television.  Each of these is a person, or a type, from our own world.  They also happen to fit the tales of the Holy Grail rather well.  Forced comparisons?  I leave that to the individual viewer to decide, but I found the characterizations marvelous.  This is not a film about Real Life, but it is a film about something truer, something closer to the soul.
This is a film that deserves multiple veiwings.  If nothing else you are going to want to see the scene in Grand Central Station more than once (if you know the movie, you know what I'm talking about; if not, you are in for a beautiful treat).

The year 2003 will bring us his ""Good Omens"". But in 1991, he gave us the mystical, magical gem ""The Fisher King"", a tremendous saga about the triumph of the human spirit. ""The Fisher King"" stars Jeff Bridges as another wounded, lost victim of the psychosis we call the modern world. He's a former talk radio star who destroys his life and many others' with a mean-spirited, thoughtless on-the-air remark. Fractured with guilt, he meets a demented homeless man(Robin Williams), and becomes enlisted in the unlikely quest for the Holy Grail. Robin Williams performance as Parry, the lost and wounded street person, is the genesis for his future demonic destitute crystalized 11 years later in ""Death to Smoochy"". Academy Award winning Mercedes Ruehl co-stars. This widescreen DVD(with trailer) is yet another terrific transfer from Columbia Tristar. And Sony gives it the anamorphic treatment. ""The Fisher King"" is a complete film; funny, compelling, innocent, and irrational. And like an old Howard Hawks epic, it's a street-level expose about the real relationship between two men. Love, Sanity, Redemption, and Ethel Merman. ""The Fisher King"" is a bountiful fantasy brimming with wonder and escapism....and isn't that what cinema is really all about?",1019088000,24,1442,5.328947368421052
21629,5,0767811089,"Terry Gilliam's post-Python oeuvre usually strikes me as rather cold and overly intellectualized.  I 'like' his movies very much, but can rarely get close enough to 'love' them.  ""Brazil"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"" being chief offenders in this complaint.  I enjoyed their visions of futuristic dystopias, but never felt involved on an emotional level.  Sure, ""Baron Munchausen"" tickled my whimsy-bone, and ""Time Bandits"" gave me kid-sized guffaws, but both those films also had a good dose of textbook thinking behind them, enough to keep the audience always an arm's length away.
""The Fisher King"", like no other film in Gilliam's catalog, hits me on an emotional level.  It is a visceral experience, unlike anything else I've seen from this offbeat director.  Layered with tangible romance and pathos, Gilliam has created a film that will stand the test of time, even when its highbrow ideas become irrelevant.
Two scenes in particular illustrate the human beauty that this film is so adept at conveying.  The first involves Parry (Robin Williams) and his daily routine: watching and following Lydia (Amanda Plummer), his from-afar crush, on her morning commute to work.  Camped out in Grand Central Station, all we see are the throngs of people crowding and pushing their way to their trains.  But when Parry sees Lydia, all that stops.  Or rather, it changes.  The music starts, tasteful glowing light emanates from the ceiling, and all the commuters take partners for a waltz.  It's a ridiculously sublime moment, beautiful in all ways.  It goes on until Parry suddenly loses Lydia in the crowd, and the dancing abruptly stops.
The other scene also involves Parry and Lydia, who are this time joined by Jack (Jeff Bridges) and Anne (Mercedes Ruehl).  After scheming to get Lydia to come to dinner with them, Jack and Anne sit back to watch Parry try and woo her.  His does so in the most childlike and endearing way: by imitating her clumsiness, her awkwardness, and her shyness.  It's a mostly wordless scene, punctuated by the sight of dropped dumplings, Parry's stirring rendition of ""Lydia the Tattooed Lady"", and Jack and Anne themselves getting caught up in the romance.
But don't get me wrong.  The whole movie isn't sweetness and light.  There are actually some terribly horrific scenes, most of them psychological in nature.
Jack is a former radio shock-jock, whose off-handed remark drove a listener to spray a yuppie restaurant with bullets.  He's now down on his luck, drunk, and of the belief that he's eternally doomed, his karma forever destroyed by that one moment.  Bridges gets both sides of Jack's persona right.  He's slimy and selfish when on top of the world.  Dirty, dreary, and dead inside when stuck in the gutter (a side curiosity: I count eight times Bridges has played a character named Jack, and that doesn't even include the surname of his character in the ""Last Picture Show"" movies).
Parry, even more so than Jack, is tormented by psychological demons.  He is connected to Jack in a horrific way, one that I am loath to divulge here.  A former university professor, Parry has taken on the insane alter ego of a homeless knight.  Williams shines in this role, his boundless energy and improvisational spirit giving some much needed light to what could have been a dark character.  Not that the darkness doesn't shine through.  Parry, stalked by a mysterious Red Knight riding an unholy steed, has a series of near breakdowns.  Williams has to show both the unbalanced side of Parry, and the one that used to exist, functioning within society.  He does well on both counts.  (N.B., the movie takes on greater meaning when you realize that Parry is short of Parsifal, an important character in another story about the search for the Holy Grail; recommended reading)
Plummer and Ruehl do important work as the women driving the men to great deeds.  Plummer, an unconventional beauty, makes you believe Lydia's shyness and sadness, while also understanding why Parry has become so smitten with her.  Ruehl, dressed her in her tackiest Erin Brockovich clothes, doesn't get as much as she gives from Bridges' Jack.  But she plays Anne as a strong but wounded woman, caught between a need to love and nurture Jack, and a desire to get away from his harmful nature.
This is Gilliam's second quest-for-the-Holy-Grail picture.  Although off-centre at times, this might be his most cohesive movie, utilizing a fairly standard three-act structure to go along with it's quest theme.  Don't worry, Gilliam fans, the director's trademark esoteric visuals survive intact.  Manhattan is captured as a gorgeous, but dangerously labyrinthine, wonderland.  The screenplay, by Richard LaGravenese, throws in literary and historical allusions, weaving themes and motifs effortlessly throughout.  It saddens me that, except for the marvelous ""The Ref"", LaGravenese has wasted the considerable talent he shows here, turning out schlock after schlock during the years following this, his initial triumph.
""The Fisher King"", billed as a modern Arthurian fable, lives up to that description.  Crass commercial culture, shock radio, homelessness, and even a sly reference to the nascent AIDS epidemic form the backdrop for this remarkable story, which mixes the entire range of human emotions in a very satisfying and entertaining stew.",1009411200,9,5339,5.1001150747986195

Joseph Campbell's ""Hero With a Thousand Faces"" also describes these characters with unparralled accuracy and definition.  Not even ""Star Wars"" (the original Episode IV) can compare with the intricate psychological spectacular that is ""The Fisher King.""  Oh, did I mention that I loved this movie???",1005177600,3,574,5.540229885057471
21632,5,0767811089,"The Fisher King is a representational movie. It makes use of Arthurian legend, and parallels the legend of the Fisher King with the lives of the two main protagonists - Parry (Robin Williams) and Jack (Jeff Bridges). Symbolism and metaphorical techniques are utilisied extensively throughout the film, which makes it an extremely visual experience to watch. However, the symbolism extends beyond the visual plane, to a very psychological one. For example, Parry's creation of a fantastical world full of 'little fat people' and the 'Red Knight', is very much representative of his own mental condition; the fantasy world, minus the Red Knight, represents Parry's acceptance/ignorance of his mental trauma. At the same time the Red Knight is symbolic of the pain and suffering as caused by the trauma itself.
Whenever Parry shows glimpes of sanity (lucid speech, dating, feeling love again, etc.), the Red Knight always appears in his life. While the Red Knight is at bay Parry is not catatonic or overwrought by his trauma. To overcome/accept the trauma of seeing his wife murdered before his eyes, ultimately Parry has to confront the Red Knight and vanguish him. However, he lacks the insight and strength to do this on his own. Enter Jack - who ultimately feels responsible for Parry's condition! Jack is the equivalent of the fool or simpleton from the story of the Fisher King. Jack's intent is one of redemption, while he is absorbed into Parry's world. Eventually Jack begins to understand Parry's need for the Holy Grail, which represents Acceptance of Loss. If Parry is able to possess the Holy Grail, then he shall be able to vanguish Insanity as represented by the Red Knight.
While there are elements of fantasy and Arthurian legend woven into this story, there is also a theme of Christianity. Originally Jack is driven by a need to regain the former glory of his life when he was a successful talkback radio host. He wants that life back and believes that by helping Parry, he will overcome his guilt, and thus be able to resume his former life. Jack feels a false resolution in his life when he regains his former life. However, ultimately, when Jack agrees to undertake the quest for the Holy Grail, only then do his motives become self-less. He helps Parry because he wants to, not because he needs to drive away his own guilt - this is very much part of the Christian Doctrine.
On the whole, The Fisher King is an intricate weaving of comedy, drama and tragedy. The direction by Gilliam is faultless, his attention to detail evident especially in the Chinese Restaurant scene, where he borrows from Chinese film-making techniques, using the vertical black bar wipe technique.
This is the type of movie which, on a superficial level, is only somewhat satisfying. However, it is on the psychological level where its real impact is felt - tragic, hopeful and uplifting. It is not the type of movie to watch if you are expecting to be entertained!",999043200,73,2961,4.876984126984127

21646,5,0767811089,"This is a beautifully directed film, as Terry Gilliam exacts bravura performances from the entire cast. This film is a cinematic masterpiece which the viewer will not easily forget.

Jeff Bridges plays Jack, a radio shock jock whose unthinking tirade provokes a caller into a senseless act of violence that culminates in tragedy for a number of faceless New Yorkers. The tragedy derails Jack's career and ends his glitteratti lifestyle. Gone is the fabulous hi-rise apartment, model type girl friend, and high paying media career.

Three years later, Jack finds himself living over a video store in a run down part of town with the video store owner, a blue collar ex-beautician, consummately played by Mercedes Ruehl, in a bravura performance that won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, and deservedly so. Despairing of his life and looking like the bum he believes himself to be, Jack goes down by the water front and toys with the idea of killing himself.

The issue is taken out of his hands when he is accosted by two youths who are sick of ""his kind"", as they apparently mistake him for part of the great unwashed horde of humanity of which they are heartedly sick. They beat him with a baseball bat and douse him from head to toe with gasoline, but just before they ignite him, a knight errant named Parry, touchingly played by Robin Williams, comes to his rescue and saves him from an untimely and excruciating death.

Parry takes Jack to his refuge, and there Parry tells him of his quest for the Holy Grail. A curious bond between the two men begins to form. After Jack leaves, he later returns, curious to know more about this strange, but kindly individual who saved his life.  Jack discovers that Parry was a former college professor whose own life drastically changed three years ago, when a caller to a shock jock's show went on a shooting rampage and killed Parry's beloved wife, one of the faceless New Yorkers who for Jack is faceless no more.

Jack, realizing that their lives are intertwined by that tragedy, seeks redemption by trying to help Parry resume a normal life. Clearly mentally ill, Parry's battle with his inner demons is seen through his eyes. The viewer is made to feel the heartbreak and pathos of his fears which are brought to life in the fearsome visage of the Red Knight, a figment of Parry's imagination who appears intermittently throughout the film, until it gives way to Parry's fragmented recollection of that fatal night three years ago. Robin Williams portrayal of Parry is one of the most beautifully nuanced performances ever. That he did not win the Best Actor Oscar for which he was nominated was truly a major faux pas on the part of the Academy.

Jack wades through Parry's fantasies of knights, quests, and the holy grail and discovers that Parry has fallen in love with an unlikely lady, the plainly hapless Lydia, played to perfection by Amanda Plummer. He engineers an unlikely meeting and sets in motion a dazzling sequence of events that ultimately results in his redemption as a human being, and an appreciation of his own lady love.

This is a wonderful film that no movie lover should be without.  While the DVD is notable for its dearth of extras, do not let that deter you from adding it to your collection. The film alone should suffice.",980640000,10,3303,4.730434782608696
21647,5,0767811089,"Not many movies have stayed with me as strongly as this one has. I watched it again last night and found it just as enthralling as when I first saw it at the cinema. My companions, who hadn't seen it before, loved it, and I had the opportunity to savour again some of the great set pieces - the naked romp in Central Park, the ballroom scene in Grand Central Station, the most over-the-top singing telegram in film history, and more. A feature of the film not mentioned by other reviewers is the way in which Manhatten is not only the backdrop to the action, but almost a character in its own right. I love the way Terry Gilliam has mythologised the city. When I visited Central Park, for example, I couldn't help imagining the red knight charging through the undergrowth, couldn't help seeing the skyscrapers as medieval fortresses. Another thing I noticed on a second viewing was simply how superlative the acting is. Despite the tone of melodrama throughout the film, each and every performance is utterly convincing. First time round I loved Robin Williams's performance. This time I was particularly struck by the dynamic between Jeff Bridges and oscar-winner Mercedes Ruehl.  The only complaint I heard after last night's viewing was that the start was a bit slow. In all, though, this film ought to have made everyone involved with its making very proud. I hope they are.",971654400,6,1378,4.741666666666666
21648,5,0767811089,"This is the one for which Robin Williams should have received an Oscar; for as Parry, the victim of a senseless tragedy, he is nothing short of brilliant in ""The Fisher King,"" directed by Terry Gilliam and co-starring  Jeff Bridges (who also gives an Oscar-worthy performance here).  Gilliam  has created the perfect mood and atmosphere to tell the story of successful  radio talk-show host Jack Lucas (Bridges), and the homeless and mentally  unhinged Parry, whose lives intersect in the wake of an act of  unconscionable violence that leaves them both barely clinging to the memory  of a reality that no longer exists for either of them.  With this movie,  Gilliam has deftly crafted a study of the symbiotic existence of mankind  and the impact of human nature upon the space we all must share in a world  growing smaller day by day.  Through Jack's eyes, Gilliam examines the  nature of cause and effect, and the results thereof, and Jack's story  ultimately becomes Parry's story, and aptly illustrates how the needs of  one become the necessity of another, and what it means to finally be able  to look beyond ourselves and delve beneath those layers of contemporary  frivolity we all manage to build, which in the end are nothing more than  pretentious insulations that keep us from the things in life that really  matter.  Even as Jack's own act of irresponsibility comes back to haunt him  and make him question his own values to the very core of his being, Parry  receives the brunt of it all from the other end of the spectrum, with  consequences even more dire, though for both the result of their shared  circumstance is life-altering.  Williams gives a masterful performance  here that illuminates so well how thin the line between comedy and drama  really is.  He brings the complex, tragic figure of Parry to the screen  flawlessly, with attitude, expression and even body language that is  impeccable, and all without a single false moment to be found anywhere  throughout (by comparison, even as good as he was in ""Good Will Hunting,""  for which he received the B.S.A. Oscar, under close scrutiny you'll find a  moment or two there that do not ring true).  This is quite simply the best  work he's ever done, before or since, and he's given the cinematic world an  unforgettable character that will undoubtedly make a lasting impression on  anyone who sees this film.  And, though Williams grabs the lion's share of  the spotlight here, he by no means overshadows Jeff Bridges, who has also  created a memorable character in Jack.  He brings a depth to this role  through which he readily displays the many different levels upon which Jack  works and lives, from the egotistical, self-centered to the compassionate;  it's like watching a struggle for domination going on within him, and  waiting to find out which side will ultimately emerge triumphant.  It's an  exemplary performance, and it's a gross miscarriage of justice that Bridges  didn't at least receive a nomination for Best Actor for this one.  Proving, however, that justice does, at times, get it's due, Mercedes Ruehl  was awarded the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her personable portrayal  of Anne, the fulcrum upon which Jack and Parry dramatically balance their  tender and tentative psyches.  Like Bridges and Williams, she gives a  performance here that is totally credible, and she's a delight to watch.  One of the strengths of this movie, in fact, is the incredible  performances; and it's so gratifying to see such a good story brought to  life and made so real through artistic endeavor.  In a supporting role,  Michael Jeter demands to be singled out for his part as the homeless  Cabaret Singer, and also Amanda Plummer, as the hapless and endearing  Lydia, both of whom are just additional parts of the aggregate that make  this such a great movie.  With ""The Fisher King,"" Gilliam has given us a  wonderfully textured morality tale, both entertaining and engaging and rich  with metaphor and substance that will endure the test of time, because it  is, in the end, a story for the ages.  This is definitely one you do not  want to let pass you by.",964915200,181,4149,4.864942528735632

Like when Robin Williams tells the wonderfully touching story of the Fisher King, he and Jeff Bridges are  lying naked in Central Park. It takes the issues it deals with  seriously--but at the same time doesn't beat you over the head with its  ideological agenda. The actors all perform extremely well--especially Jeff  Bridges. In the scene(s) where he's stumbling around the city drunk and  confused, his acting combined with Terry Gilliam's excellent camera work  really capture the essence of what that feeling is like. So I'd definitely  recommend stepping into the minds of the characters in this movie--the  diversity of viewpoints and priorities that they each have is both  thought-provoking and refreshing.",956707200,4,813,5.1923076923076925

This is a story of crass disregard for one's fellow human  being, consequences, madness, homelessness, and ultimately of redemption.
The most interesting parts of this movie are Gilliam's attempts to see  the world through Parry's crazed eyes.  Brief moments of Parry's world are  both disturbing and wonderful.

21653,5,0767811089,"This is one of my favorite films.  For the most part it is solid but does take some thought and knowledge about how people deal with trauma.  Although it falters at times and has a few artistic distractions it does  teach several good lessons.  To understand the meaning of the title one  must know the story of the Fisher King.  There are many variations of the  legend and one very simplistic version is sort of given in the film and  will not be repeated here.  The Legend of the Fisher King deals with a man  who was injured as a young man (again many variations of how) and suffered  from these wounds throughout his life.  His only respite was to be taken  fishing.  He eventually became the penultimate master of the Grail Castle.  Every evening the Grail, Platen and spear would be brought out and those  suffering would be healed.  That is, all except for the Fisher King.  The  Fisher King could not be healed until someone asked him a specific  question.  The Fisher King did not need to know the answer to the question.  As the years passed, nobody ever asked the question until one day, on his  second visit to the Grail Castle, Percival, asked the question, ""Whom  does the Grail serve?""  The Fisher king realized that the Grail did  not serve to make him great but that it served those in need.  He was  humbled and his wounds healed.  (He died several days later and Percival  became the last master of the Grail Castle.)  The film deals with this  dilemma in Jack.  Jack can not be healed until he understands ""whom  the Grail serves."" Jack tries to help Parry so that Jack will be  healed so Jack can get on with Jack's life.  It is only at the end of the  film that Jack does the first unselfish thing that he has ever done in his  life.  Jack is the only character that grows emotionally.  Of course, this  act has nothing to do with Parry's condition improving.  Parry is not  crazy and Parry is not demented.  Parry was a high functioning person until  he witnesses his wife's head taking a shotgun blast.  Parry regresses into  a fugue state and takes on an alternate identity.  He takes on a character  that will, in metaphor, deal with what he witnessed.  What Parry lost was  intimacy and in his psychological struggle to cope with that loss he is  both chased by and chases the last image of intimacy he recalls. Any  emotional closeness, even with Jack, triggers these flashbacks although the  image is distorted through the metaphor of his fugue state and becomes the  red knight/ (representing his wife's violent death.)  Parry does not  become psychotic until Jack replaces Parry's fantasized intimacy with real  intimacy and gets him ""the date"".  The distortion is shattered;  the metaphor no longer replaces the reality of Parry's last memory of his  wife because the intimacy is psychologically too close to what Parry had  lost. His Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder  (PTSD) flashback is no longer the  Red knight but the reliving of the actual trauma.  Parry's psyche is forced  to regress further and he become catatonic.  This is the mind's way of  calling a time-out.  With time he eventually returns to his previous fugue  state and that is where the film leaves him.  Although not for everyone  and not always consistent, it is an excellent film if you are willing to  pay attention and not get distracted by Hollywood smarm.",951350400,17,3363,4.635273972602739
