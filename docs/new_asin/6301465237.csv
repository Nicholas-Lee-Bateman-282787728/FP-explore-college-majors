7813548,4,6301465237,"THE MIGHTY HEROES: FRITZ THE CAT creator RALPH BAKSHI's super hero spoof for the long defunct TERRYTOONS studio (home of MIGHTY MOUSE, HECKYL & JECKYL and DEPUTY DAWG) has never seen an official DVD release, but is still fondly remembered by large pockets of the sixties Saturday-morning-cartoon-and-cereal-set. Character actor HERSCHEL BERNARDI (CHARLIE THE TUNA, JOLLY GREEN GIANT) provided the deep, gravelly voice of sensible team leader DIAPER MAN (a baby wielding a lethal milk bottle), aided by his less competent allies...good natured STRONG MAN, windy-voiced TORNADO MAN, stout hearted ROPE MAN and klutzy CUCKOO MAN. TERRYTOONS mainstay LIONEL WILSON provided  most of the other characters' voices, including ghoulishly grinning, self descriptive villains such as THE SHOCKER, THE STRETCHER and THE FROG. Loaded with heroic (if repetitive) foul ups, elaborate cliffhanger traps ala ADAM WEST era BATMAN and a general sense of chaotic camaraderie, THE MIGHTY HEROES is one heck of a ""lost classic"" deserving of a much wider audience.

7813550,1,6301465237,It's a mediocre cartoon at best. The heroes are 1D and have no real defining character outside their powers. They are also very accident prone. The villians are also 1D and forgettable because the show only uses them only 1 time. The animation is not great but pretty good. Every episode is predictable and has no real surprises. The jokes are kind-of funny but none of them came from the leads. There are no life lessons or any messages for that matter. I give this tape a 1 out of 10.,1321056000,,486,4.351648351648351
7813551,3,6301465237,"The picture on the Amazon site says ""The Complete Series""' but the VHS tape I received contains only six episodes. I guess I should have looked closer at the picture, which actually says DVD on the cover.

As of this date (01/2010) The Mighty Heroes have not been officially released on DVD. The picture is from an ""unauthorized"" collection not available on Amazon. A Google search will probably pull up the place to get the DVD. But come on, TerryToons, give us an official DVD of The Mighty Heroes! It would be great to see a fully restored version of these historically significant* cartoons!

I'm not disappointed, as I only paid $1.99, but that picture of the DVD cover should be removed to avoid any further consumer confusion.

*(This series was conceived on the spot at a TerryToons - CBS story pitch meeting by a junior-animator, after CBS had rejected all the other pitch ideas. The execs liked the idea, and the junior-animator was put in charge of the project. His name was Ralph Bakshi.)",1263859200,5,1000,4.702857142857143
