aka Claro de Luna en Hawaii

(Comedy, Black & White, 1 hr, 1 min)

Universal, U.S.A.

DIRECTOR:

Charles Lamont

CAST:

Johnny Downs (Pete), Jane Frazee (Toby), Maria Montez (As: Ilani)

COMMENTS:

Set in Hawaii, this sour musical casts Downs as an escort for the wealthy Gateson and her band of tourists. Errol and Carle are a pair of crooked Hawaiian pineapple juice manufacturers who want to reap the fruits of Gateson's fortune.

With blonde hair by the second and last time (the guys of Universal forced her to dye her hair because they thought red hair was not good for a black and white film), Maria Montez plays the role of Ilani, the excentric hostess of a hotel, she does not appear much, but she have a couple of comic scenes.",1344470400,,765,4.6
