I have seen Cry Blood Apache, which is a great movie, but is also on almost every single Mill Creek Western collection out there.

This has two Sartana films, and is a much better collection, IMO. I almost forced myself to watch The Gunfighters, but I got sick of it within the first five minutes, maybe I can give it another shot, but the thought that i speant $4 on movies I already own is not appetizing. I watched Django Kill instead, and it was amazing!

CONTENTS of THE GUNFIGHTERS 4 Movie Pack:

CRY BLOOD, APACHE-- A cowboy gang slaughters an Apache group, but spare the life of a squaw who promises to lead them to a treasure in gold. One brave was away from camp during the attack, and he stalks the gang, picking them off one at a time. A fine premise squandered.

FISTFUL OF LEAD-- Another installment in the ""Sartana"" series. A gunslinging bounty hunter (Sartana) witnesses the robbery of a gold shipment. He's hired to protect the next shipment and encounters several villains as a result. In the cast of this well-made flick is horror specialist Erika Blanc.

THE GUNFIGHTERS-- Canadian-made TV movie. A Kansas ranching family is dogged by a man who wants to see them fail. The youngest of them kills in self-defense but their enemy makes it look like the murder of an unarmed man. The boy runs, is captured and jailed. His brother and cousin help him escape; all three are labelled as outlaws, so they decide to take revenge on their nemesis by robbing him. Character actor George Kennedy plays a decent bad guy here.

TERRITORIAL MEN-- The pilot episode of a short-lived series called ""Sara."" Family-style story of a Colorado Territory schoolteacher who wishes to tame the west. She falls for a newcomer to town, a wealthy businessman from the big city.

For more western action,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-OUTLAWS-4-Movie-Pack/dp/B0000AKY6D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE OUTLAWS 4 Movie Pack</a>&nbsp;(also from BCI / Eclipse) is surefire.

BRENTWOOD's 4-fers are nicely priced movie bundles. Video and sound quality of these digitally unrestored public domain films is generally fine. Discs are dual-side recorded.
