8272094,1,B00106XX8Y,"The slapstick is more exaggerated, but the charm is lessened, and there's actually less nudity, which really seems like the whole reason for any of these movies existing.",1400371200,4,170,5.107142857142857
8272095,5,B00106XX8Y,"Another classic sex comedy shown on Cinemax many times.  Several naked cuties and a good amount of slapstick make for a good show.  The rugby game with several shots to the ""groonies"" and use of an early sex enhancer is the funniest scene.  Well worth watching.  Hopefully the remaining two movies in this series comes out.",1399766400,4,323,4.714285714285714
8272096,5,B00106XX8Y,"If you've never ever seen any of the ""Confessions of..."" flix,then do yourselves a favour,go out & buy a multiregional player,then sit back,and bellyroll laugh,until your stomach hurts,literally?! There's just something about ""swinging London"" era shows/films,as they capture that period perfectly,to a tee?

I was raised on that kind of sensiblity,being a lovechild of the 60's,I was way too young to partake in the festivities,but the voyeurism was absolutely astonishing,let me tell ya,ooh?! Benny Hill & the confessions series was my coming of age puberty,basically(which could be viewed as rather frightening,depending on your views,OK)?

My little brother and I would sneakliy watch "" the Benny Hill Show"",as it was practically seen as porn,in the conservative middle states? So at 10:00 pm,we'd see the thames production logo on the telly,and we knew that it was time to cut the tv on low,and laugh our heads off at the sheer comedic brilliance that exuded all throughout the broadcast. Then a few years later,we got the chance to see all of the confessions series on late night cable,during its glorified heyday.

It's nowhere near where it used to be,as early cable really rocked,you could basically get a healthy dose of sex ed,w/no hangups at all,it didn't make ya wanna run out and do it,it was just fun to watch,and learn as well? Seeing the main character(who resembled mick jagger/brian jones and peter noone of herman's hermits combined)get into all kind of silly hijinks was some of the funniest stuff that I have ever seen on film,to this day?

Plus,he was usually compleatly naked somehow,which made it all the funnier. The states still have a thing against nudity,yet on free tv,one can watch someone being slaughtered in a million different ways,yet the adult film industry rakes in over a billion,in the U.S. alone,hypocrisy,anyone? Now,I'm not one to run to a nudist colony,not at all? But I find nothing wrong with the natural beauty of nudity.

The violence really needs to cease,as these kiddies weaned on dark video games/television are turning into these little savage monsters,totally? They could use a confessions movie or two,ya know? Even though they are geared towards adults,mature teens could view them,with the right adult supervision. But in this day & age,that would be considered exploitation,even though it wouldn't be. The kids could ask questions,you could answer them,then laugh uncontrollably together?

Sex ed should be taught with a ribald sense of humour,and the confessions series have that in spades,really? I have asked people about them,and no one seems to remember them,at all? I used to tell people in high school,and I do believe that I got a few people to sneak & watch them,then we'd laugh together,talking about what went down?

Whilst I was in the UK,I searched for the series,but to no avail. I do believe that only one bloke knew of what I was talking about,hum? I guess that those who were of age then,were too busy getting down,to actually be bothered with watching it,I guess? So it must have gotten by those much younger,and they quickly stopped showing softcore on cable. Well, they still do,but the new stuff is god awful,in a very bad way,OK? It's nothing like the glory days of the confessions series,as I will always have a soft for those silly yet lovable curmudgeons.

The main character(whose name I cannot recall)had a partner-in-crime,he was a few years older,and he was like the straight man,who kept it all together. But he had his moments of silliness as well. They were like the softcore version of Laurel & Hardy/Abbott & Costello,pure comedic geniuses,indeed(but where are they now,I often wonder)?

Actually,they spoiled me,as far as madcap comedy goes,'cos I really don't find too many so-called ""comedies"" really funny,nowadays? Well,unless it's british(simon pegg,anyone)? I purposely didn't reveal any of the actual details of the films,because it's a must that you view them for yourselves,truly? Hey,I haven't even seen them,since the early 80's,so I'm in for a real treat as well?

Happy hunting?!",1225152000,,4085,5.1478129713423835
