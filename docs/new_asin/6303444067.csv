7847042,5,6303444067,"'The Butter Battle Book' is one of the most interesting youth

political satires I've ever seen. The story has to due with two powers battling eachother over who butters ones bread on which side. Each tries to outwit the other until both are evenly matched-with a weapon of mass destruction. Done in Suess's classic style this telling story of the nuclear arms race was to have applied to the cold war but also says alot about todays conflicts on the world front. With an adult or not all children of all ages should see this but so should the adults-especially any contemplating military service. The message presented here is clear-the reasons for war's are sometimes very trivial-usually it's the weapons that are the frightening part.",1137715200,3,738,4.904

7847044,5,6303444067,i absolutely love this movie. as a child i watched it and thought it was very educational and fundemental...still it is sad and funny and cute at the same time. a very exciting story for young children. my brother however taped over my version of this movie and have been determined to eventually buy it ever since...has lasted in my mind and heart for many year and is very sentimental to me,991180800,,392,4.458333333333333
7847045,5,6303444067,I recently watched this video and found it disurbing andrealistic.  It truly has a cold war feeling about it.  I think this isone Dr. Suess story that parents should watch with the children if not alone.,942710400,7,203,4.611111111111111
