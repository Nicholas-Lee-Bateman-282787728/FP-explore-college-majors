417457,4,6302038324,"The movie ""Gothic"" is not nearly as awful as some reviewers here have represented.  Russel more or less puts the viewer in the minds of the  characters as they experience drug induced hallucinations and whip  themselves into a climactic frenzy.  If you can accept this frame of  reference, you can enjoy the disjointedness and wierdness of this film.  Both Byrne and Sands are excellent as the two poets, although Richardson is  fairly wooden in her role.  There is some poor editing, particularly  towards the end, and some unexplained shots that require knowledge about  the actual characters (especially Lord Byron). However, the film does a  good job of conveying the goings-on of a crazy night at Byron's swiss  chalet.  In short, Gothic is a fairly wild (and short) ride that has to be  approached with an open mind in order to enjoy.",965952000,4,840,4.865248226950355
417458,5,6302038324,"I was intrigued the first time I saw this strange film.  I have always been fascinated by the life of Mary Shelley and that is what drew me to see it.  I was impressed by all of the symbolism, forshadowing and how the  concepts of the story parallel the works of these famous people.  I have  watched it many times and I still keep finding things I didn't quite  understand the time before.  I believe the problem most people have with  this movie is they do not understand most of the symbolism.  It is a bit  overwhelming at times, and I have never found anyone of my friends who has  actually admitted to liking it, but I think it is an erotic and powerful  movie that truely captures the essence of that time and shows a darker side  of the romantic era.",960768000,7,758,4.253521126760563

If you enjoy  gratuitously lush visuals supported by a weak script and embarassed actors,  go ahead and rent this movie somewhere.

During this terrible night in geneva, the most inspired gothic spirits of Europe will challenge themselves to the writing of an horror story. The  winner will be the one who would create a story so frightening that it will  become true in the others' minds. In essence, it will give birth to two  major works of English litterature, Mary sheley's Frankenstein an  Polidori's VAMPYRE (which seemed to be very much taken from Lord Byron's  life). The atmosphere is heavy and the prestation of each of the actors  remarkable. You would believe to be back in the old days, in the presence  of Lord Byron and the Shelleys. I would like to make a point escpecially on  Gabriel Byrne's play as a dandy and, perhaps, vampyre. There are lots of  hints at Frankenstein (with shelley naked under the rain shouting  ""Lightning is the force of the universe""), at the vampyre myth,  and at shelley's obsession about worms, and so on...

417462,4,6302038324,"If history were kind at all to Mary Shelly they would not try to say that she only wrote""Frankenstein"" after spending a drug induced haullucinatory night with Byron Shelly et.all. Despite the obvious liberties  that hollywood has taken with this lady's life story this is a very well made  movie. The acting is very good-with the inter-personal relationships filling  in very well when the special effects are not keeping your undivided  attention. An extremely dark and physcolog-ically disturbing story line-it  is definately not a movie to be watched late at night by one's self unless you are  firmly grounded in reality. It is a movie that just wants todraw you  in and does so in such a way that you don't realize how deeply  until it's  almost too late and i found myself having to jerk  myself mentally back  to reality. As other reviewers have so well put-this is not a movie for  the faint of heart or physic.

If one is interested in the house party that spawned Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"", a better movie choice is ""Rowing With the Wind"" (I THINK that was the title), which at least attempted to make some sense of the question:  How is a literary classic brought forth from a bunch of spoiled hippies?

417488,5,6302038324,"There is nothing like a Ken Russell film to excite the senses and challenge the mind. He is sadly no longer with us, but his gallery of unique and eclectic films are his brilliant legacy to cinema...""Gothic"" not withstanding. Russell didn't like telling his biographical films' story from beginning to end loaded with ""facts"" that you could just read about in a biographical book on the subject or subjects. He took the essence of their lives and their art, then he would create visuals with his camera and a music score that would convey the emotions of the person and how their ""art"" could move the viewer. In ""Gothic"" Russell takes the viewer on a phantasmagorical journey into the minds of the people attending Lord Byron's estate on that fateful night from which Mary Shelley would inevitably conjure up her horror classic ""Frankenstein."" The imagery Russell creates from his subject's lives (past, present and future) are some of the most haunting, disturbing, and all-out-gothic visuals to ever grace the cinema screen. The whole movie has a drive to it as it rushes from scene to scene, a madness that increases with every minute and builds to a glorious finale of horror, sadness, fear and pain. The viewer truly feels these character's fears along with them. Ken Russell's ""Gothic"" is a gut-wrenching, visceral thriller of a movie. If you have an open mind and just go with Russell's vision, then you will have a wonderful, frightening experience watching this demented, artful film.",1490832000,3,1493,4.952191235059761

417495,4,6302038324,"Perverse, intense, sensual, and just plain weird, this fictionalized historical horror about Mary Shelley and Lord Byron makes for an interesting watch loaded with before-they-were-stars.

This tells the fascinating story of how a modern horror legend came to bein a heavily fictionalized sense, anyway.  As we are introduced to our characters, we find their extravagant lifestyles are punctuated by hedonism, male sexual dominance and the entitlements of severe classist elitism.  They are most extreme in pleasure, manor stricture, and delights.

Lord Byron (Gabriel Byrne; End of Days, Stigmata) hosts his guests Shelley (Julian Sands; Warlock, Arachnophobia), the future Mary Shelley (Natasha Richardson; Big Trouble in Little China) and Clair (Myriam Cyr; Species II) along with Byron's doctor Polidori (Timothy Spall; Sweeney Todd, The Bride).  The cast alone is reason enough to see this perverse film.

Like a vampire, Lord Byron breeds emotional and social intensity, drawing more than an occasional discomfort from his controlled guests.  What's more is their collective sexual nature.  It's not homoerotic nor bisexual really, but rather a sort of pansexuality; a pervasive general sensuality.  Think Interview with a Vampire (1994) while being less polite about it.

They gather together and tell ghost stories with perverse tones, speak in poetic seduction of the mind and body, engage in voyeurism and orgy, and lead one another into deep creativity and hysteria.  All manner of nightmare fuel accosts their minds from the ghastly nocturnal homunculus to the blinking eye-nippled woman, perhaps the most iconic scene of the film.  It's strikingly weird; even other-worldly.

Our guests descend into madness as they mesh polyamory and paranoia, erring on the side of madness.  They envision everything from dead fetuses to animated disembodied heads.

Director Ken Russell (Altered States, The Lair of the White Worm) has a flair for melodrama.  But it is deliberate and perhaps appropriate given his aims to paint our storytellers as creators; creators of their horrors within.

This film tiptoes the line separating ludicrous bad horror and brilliant mania.  I recommend it to general horror fans whose taste spans all manner of quality and style, since this film is a bit hard to classify.",1469404800,5,2305,5.445070422535212

417525,1,6302038324,"In the summer of 1816, the poet Percy Shelley, his lover Mary Godwin and her stepsister Claire Clairmont spent some time at the Villa Diodati, which was being rented by Lord Byron. They were the rock stars of their era, immersed in art, sex and drugs.

And you would THINK that it would make a spellbinding movie, especially since this summer spawned the gothic classic ""Frankenstein"" and the more obscure novella ""The Vampyre."" But not so much in Ken Russell's hallucinatory ""Gothic,"" a mesmerizing, acid-soaked, baffling movie populated by well-respected, talented actors who are doing some of the worst work of their entire careers.

Shelley (Julian Sands), Mary (Natasha Richardson) and Claire (Myriam Cyr) arrive at the Villa Diodati, where Lord Byron (Gabriel Byrne) and his fawning physician Dr. Polidori (Timothy Spall) are living. Byron warmly welcomes Shelley and Claire (who wants to resume their torrid sexual affair), but is somewhat less welcoming to Mary. Mary, for her part, is worried that the sexually-rapacious Byron is going to hurt her sister, who claims to be pregnant with his child.

That night, the group amuses themselves with a volume of ghost stories, hide-and-seek, opiates and an impromptu orgy, which climaxes with Shelley climbing naked on the rooftop because he believes it is ""the spark of creation."" They decide that they have the godlike power to bring forth a new creation by resurrecting the dead -- only for Claire to collapse in a seizure.

As the night goes on, the five of them are haunted by the ghosts their little ritual has conjured up -- Polidori's sexual guilt, Mary's past miscarriage, and the feelings simmering between the two brilliant poets. Strange sex and grotesque visions plague the people in the villa, as they become convinced that they did indeed call something forth -- and that if they don't send it back, it will drive them all mad.

Some of the weirdest aspects of ""Gothic"" are actually rooted in fact -- for instance, the seemingly random scene where Shelley start rambling about a woman with eyes in her nipples is actually based on something that happened. But a lot of the weirdness is purely Ken Russell's doing -- the whole movie has an overheated, sweaty, hallucinatory quality, like something you might dream of when you were really sick and feverish.

Furthermore, Russell drapes the story in past cinema (a heavy influence from Italian giallo) and art (Fuseli's ""Nightmare"" is very explicitly referenced when Mary dreams of an imp perching on her sleeping body), and name-drops quite a few works of actual gothic literature and/or Romantic poetry. It adds a sheen of respectability to the goings-on.

Unfortunately, the movie ends up collapsing under the weight of its own artistic pretensions, becoming a grotesquely silly, overwrought experience that is just trying to build up to the ""shocking"" moment when Byron finally kisses Shelley. Male bisexuality among artists -- how shocking. Until then, Russell just peppers the feverish story with all sorts of random moments, mostly filled with phallic symbolism (a snake on a suit of armor -- WHAT DOES IT MEAN?) and some truly baffling scenes that lead nowhere (a confused-looking Shelley watching a robotic belly-dancer).

Russell also had a glorious cast to work with -- Byrne, Richardson, Sands, Spall, all respected actors who have done excellent work elsewhere. Unfortunately, they are all MESMERIZINGLY bad here. Byrne seems checked out and listless throughout most of the movie, Richardson looks baffled by whatever she's doing, and Sands manages to give a performance both flat and manic, scenery-chewing through speeches about galvanometers and narcolepsy.

It also is painfully misrepresentational of the real-life people at the villa. Shelley is perhaps the only one written well, as you can see why this golden-haired, strangely childlike poet would enchant any man or woman. But Byron is almost exclusively depicted as a sadistic manipulator. Claire is just a goggle-eyed, giggling nymphomaniacal goblin who fantasizes about being raped by suits of armor, and spends the movie's climax slithering around the wine cellar covered in filth, like a pornographic Gollum.

And Mary is depicted as -- of all things -- a flat, prim, dull woman who would be completely unremarkable if we didn't know what she would later write. There's not a spark of genius or even charisma in this portrayal, just of a weepy, prissy woman who barely tolerates her lover's infidelity.

But the worst depiction is of Polidori. I don't know why Russell apparently loathed Polidori so much, but almost every aspect of him is misrepresented here. In real life, he was a young, stunningly beautiful, hotheaded, bisexual genius who probably had a crush on Mary Shelley. In this movie, he's a simpering, sweaty, unattractive, middle-aged gay man who is tormented by religious guilt over his sexuality -- which seems unlikely in circles where bisexuality and free love were common. Russell even goes so far as to suggest that he committed suicide because he must have been gay (depicted with a face-full of grotesque makeup), even though the motives for his suicide are pretty well-known.

""Gothic"" was clearly meant to be a trippy grotesquerie, and in that it was successful. But it also has mesmerizingly bad acting, pretensions of art, and horrifically twisted personalities that it's almost impossible to care about.",1425945600,,5424,5.151136363636364

417550,3,6302038324,"GOTHIC, directed by Ken Russell, is a rather interesting film that deals with, among other things, the dark side of creativity and imagination. More specifically, it's about the night when Mary Shelley came up with the idea that she would later turn into the novel ""Frankenstein."" By and large, the performances are quite good, although I didn't really care for Julian Sands. However, the story was almost non-existent and ephemeral, existing merely to have a bunch of people go around saying stuffy lines and get scared out of their wits by creatures borne of their imaginations. Granted, some of these sequences and images were haunting and surreal, but it all added up to a lot of style with very little substance. As far as the score is concerned, I thought that the work Thomas Dolby did was impeccable as far as its musical quality, but some of the cues didn't really fit (to me) with this kind of period piece. The story takes place in the early 19th century, but a lot of the music sounded very 1980's with synthesizers and programmed drums. It's a score that I'd buy, but I'm not too sure that it completely fit the film. From a technical standpoint, I thought it was very well-made, i.e., it was well-lit and the shot composition was varied. There were also some Dutch angles that accentuated the disorienting feel the filmmakers seemed to be going for. Overall, if you're looking for a well-told story that has characters you care about and identify with, this might not be the best choice for you. However, if you like heavily stylized and surreal horror, this will probably suit your fancy.",1419465600,6,1603,4.749103942652329

and finally screened this one tonight, the trouble is the lackluster quality of this Artisan edition
of the DVD which is not too great and has zero extras and the transfer, as has been noted
elsewhere on here, is not great.  it's not in 5.1 and it looks ok but is clearly not in the correct
aspect ratio.  At least I do hope it's not, not that I'm pining for a restored letterboxed blu ray
after kind of suffering through this mess tonight!

This movie is also sooooo dated as I feared it would be, soundtrack by Thomas Dolby, good lord!
Anyway, it's the usual good campy over the top Ken Russell fun, but yeah,
he made some better films that's for darned sure.  The Devils which I just screened for the first time ever a few months ago, for example, is light years better than this that it's unbelievable.  TOMMY I like ok but never really loved (the album I do though).
Altered States was cool for its time but is also probably now utterly dated and nearly unwatchable.
I think even Lair of the White Worm is almost starting to seem good compared to GOTHIC.
I hate to say it. And that's a pretty bad film, also based as it is on one of Bram Stoker's worst
pieces of writing, in any case.

Even with all the acting talent here, it's so over the top and hammy it just ends up being
kind of bludgeoning where it should be creepy or scary, instead mostly it just comes off
as cheezy now.  Ah well.  I recommend just going and reading Byron, Shelley, Frankenstein any
good critical or annotated edition if you can find one, Polidori's The Vampyre is ok but no
great classic of the gothic horror novel like Stoker's Dracula.  Just don't read Varney the
Vampire.....you have been warned!  Also, if you also suffer the same sleep malady as
Julian Sands in this film you can go even further back and read the original gothics
as rattled off by Lord Byron herein: any of those should put you instantly in a boredom
coma that you shall never awaken from until buried alive!!!  Especially Melmoth The
Wanderer.  Vathek.  Castle of Otranto. Mysteries of Udolpho.  Dr. Faustus. Snore.

My real recommendation is to watch a real horror film like The Shining, The Innocents, ALIEN,
Herzog's decently watchable remake of Nosferatu (or better yet the original Nosferatu as a coda), or The Exorcist and go read Arthur Machen, Lovecraft or Algernon Blackwood and forget this rather dreadful film ever existed!  Enjoy your laudanum cocktail too.....goodnight.  Usually when something said Vestron Video on it in the 80s it was a sign to be afraid.....very afraid.....

417578,4,6302038324,"I saw this movie when it was in theatrical release.  I liked it then, I like it now.  The acting of Julian Sands, Myriam Cyr, and Timothy Spall doesn't really hold up for the length of the picture but that's probably the fault of the script more than the innate ability of the actors themselves.  Still it was a distraction.
  It was something of a surprise to see a young Gabriel Byrne again since I wasn't really aware of him as an actor more than 30 years ago.  IMDB gives the release date as 1986 but it was in theaters long before that.  I remember because I saw it by myself before I got married and moved to another town in 1985.
  Anyway, the thing that I find so attractive about this movie is that it depicts real, historic, literary events that have otherwise been ignored.  These were the incidents that inspired Mary Shelly to write ""Frankenstein.""  The sets are beautiful, the effects are interesting, The Movies lost quite an asset with the accidental death of Natasha Richardson.",1406505600,,995,4.533707865168539

417580,3,6302038324,"Wow, this is quite an interesting movie.

It began intriguingly enough.  In fact, I loved the beginning and the possibilites.  I am a fan of horror, fantasy, beautiful historical costumes and gorgeous/macabre imagery, so when I heard about this film I was eager to check it out.

The film begins with a group of friends/occasional threesome participants including poet Percy Shelley, his lover/future wife Mary (Godwin)Shelley and her stepsister Claire all visiting the poet Lord Byron on his estate.  He has self-exhiled himself there due to his scandalous life, and it was Claire's idea to visit him as they had been lovers before and she is a bit obsessed with him.  Also at Byron's home is the biographer Polidori, called Poli for short. The plot is that this is an interpretation of the famous night that Mary Shelley conceived the idea of her masterpiece ""Frankenstein.""

At the film's beginning, you know it's going to be a party, as they are all a very open, child-like (especially Claire, whom you could say is actually childish), free-spirited and artistic bunch.  Mary is presented as the most grounded of the group.  There are games, pranks, sexual situations, strange rooms...and oh yeah, drug use. Bring on the opiates!  And then it gets weird.  :-)  Core themes are Mary's lose of her child to death (she longs to bring it back to life); Mary's love for Shelley but undeniable sexual attraction to Byron; the complications of the Shelley/Mary/Claire menage-a-trois lifestyle (and actually, call it a menage-a-quatre, now that Byron's involved!);  and then poor Poli who looks like he just wants some action, either way is good, but no one's really paying him any attention.

I did enjoy this film.  It contains some memorable hallucinogenic imagery, often horrific, or erotic, or very often both.  That being said, it was still a little too abstract and vague for me to love it.  In style, this film kind of reminded me of Rob Zombie's recent film ""The Lords of Salem,"" where you get all these hallucinogenic (beautiful, horrific, sexy, cool) images that are enjoyable to watch, but you're still tilting your head to the side, like ""What the...?"" Through trial-and-error I've found that I like my films to walk a middle path between free-spirited and grounded in plot.  The Point of It All that I came away with, is that to create something great, TRULY great, you've got to completely let go and lose your mind.  Really walk on the mad side.  :-)  I'm not sure if that's what Russell and the writers intended!

If you are a fan of horror, the gothic/macabre, sex (who isn't?  :-) or films that make you think, you should at least check this out, especially if it's free!

417618,5,6302038324,"I've not watched this film in many years so I thought I'd give it another watch to see if it stands up and I'm pleased to say that it does. It's an unusual horror film that says more about the imagination and its ability to conjure terror, especially when helped by copious indulgence in opiates!

The film tells the story of a night hosted by Lord Byron when he is visited by his friend the poet Shelley and his mistress (later to become Mary Shelley), from this party two classics of the horror genre are spawned Polidori's 'The Vampire' and Shelley's 'Frankenstein'. The party starts with a sceance to create a ghost built from all of their personal fears. Their creation then haunts them through a horror filled night.

The characters are a joy to watch and are a mixed bunch, I always enjoy watching Gabriel Byrne in action and his ability to play dark characters works well with his portrayal of Lord Byron. The other charcters are fun as well, especially Shelley (although he does come across as a little overdramatic at times, but that does fit with the story and the role) and the Doctor is excellent as the weak link in the group.

The two female characters are less impressive, but still do their jobs well. The horror in the film touches on the metaphysical as well as the psychological and even better does not rely on gore or shock to get the message across. There's a definite sense of dread as the film gets going.

The one reall off note for me was the music, for some of the scenes (such as the barn) it's a little unimaginitive and seems at odds with style of the film. Still that's not a major issue and overall this is an excellent horror film.",1384646400,,1665,4.449180327868852

What really makes this a great film is that nothing seems too over the top. The horror that each of these people experience is something we can almost all relate to. It's humans being reduced to utter madness by their own unrelenting terror that they themselves have created!

This movie is defiantly one you'll want/need to see over and over to catch things the next go around. It's often incoherent, hard to follow and confusing but in a way that makes it all the more horrifying and real. Its play on shadows and light work and bumps in the night all hit home with those of us who find ourselves scared in the dark and of the unknown. What is horrifying at first is often found to be just our imagination or a play on the lighting but this film plays on that and goes further.

417625,3,6302038324,A friend recommended this film to me (based on my current tastes in Cinema) and I must say I am kind of one the fence with this one. The core story I thought was fascinating with it trying to convey the heavy concepts of how some Victorian horror novelists (in this case Mary Shelley) approached writing her next novel like some method actors prepare for their next role. Their are moments of brilliance particularly when Lord Byrone and his acquaintences read allowed from a book that seems to make their darkest fear come alive but only after ingesting hallucinogenic laced wine and praying to a skull (supposedly that once belonged to a monk gone deranged). From this point on we are emerged into a world which seems to give explinations for all the underlying themes in Mary Shellys most famous work Frankenstein.

Though I'm genuinely interested in the film's subject matter, I had to constantly suppress the urge to fast-forward. To borrow the line once used about Poulenc, Ken Russell had absolutely nothing to say about this subject...and he said it.

Mary Shelley and others gather at Lord Byron's country estate, where they indulge in sexual fantasies, drugs, and ghastly storytelling. Their fun and games turn into lurid nightmares when they are overcome by visual manifestations of their twisted tales. GOTHIC is strictly over the top from start to finish, with outrageous characters and dialog that are stretched far beyond their limit. It is a circus act of sexual debauchery and dark Gothic imagery trapped in a lavish mansion setting. Russell carries over many of the strange and twisted visuals that he popularized in ALTERED STATES and would carry into LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM the following year, but it is impossible to derive much more meaning out of the overt psycho-sexual metaphors than the obvious in this overstated film. Still, it is a visually stimulating and visceral viewing experience, and many fans will revel in the flamboyant performances of its frilly characters. If you can find a decent copy, GOTHIC is definitely worth checking out, but avoid the inaudible and worn public domain copies that make it nearly impossible to watch.

These five come together this night to conjure up their true fears for fun by way of sance with a skull, but as it turns out, backfires considerably as the evening descends into a hell of bizarre and nightmarish images.

Claire is stalking the manipulative, selfish and sadistic Byron who has previously rejected her; the free-loving Shelley, who lives his life like he writes ""I'm too restrained by narrative prose"" is simply trying to escape the responsibilities of his mundane every day life it seems; Mary mourns the loss of her dead child and we learn, her fear is that she would give anything to bring it back to life (sound familiar?), and as for Byron and Poli (Byron's pet name for him), it's hard to tell what, if anything, they are seeking, except maybe some entertainment and opportunities for new sexual conquests.

I finally sat down to watch it (just finished it actually) and was somewhat dissapointed and pleased at the same time. There are a lot of things in this movie that I'm sure are not historically accurate (other than the ones that obviously can't be verified), but it's obvious that the director did his research when he was making this movie. The actors are all well chosen, especially Gabriel Byrne.

The movie's appeal is that it's horror is more of the psychological aspect than the ghoul & ghost variety. Just like the title, the tale is very gothic and dark, which may not appeal to everyone. Some who are expecting a movie full of shocks and gore will be very dissapointed. There are shocks, but again... they are of the psychological variety.

The movie surrounds Percy Byce Shelley, Mary Godwin (who would later marry Shelley), Claire (Mary's step-sister), Lord Byron, & his personal physician Polidori. After a few too many drinks of laudnum (a very potent drug) and a botched seance, the group begins to see various frightening images. As to whether these images are fake or real, the decision is left up to the viewer. The ending is rather interesting, but I won't reveal it here. Unfortunately for us viewers, the film wasn't retouched when they transferred the film so it's very obvious that the film was dubbed directly from a VHS copy of the film. That's a pity, since there's some GORGEOUS imagery in this movie.

For the most part I'd recommend this movie to people who are willing to sit through a slow movie for some good payoff. There are some tedious moments to the film, but they're worth watching. I'd recommend renting this first to make sure that you like it. One thing is for sure, though- it's something you should watch twice so you can catch the things you missed the first go round.

Is that a branch scraping the window, or something much more sinister trying to gain access? Russell's anti-thriller gives no answers, even in a rather disquieting epilogue, where the excesses of the previous night are 'explained'
Briefly; Don Boyd at Virgin Vision had a literate script on his hands. The core plot had Percy and Mary Shelley, Lord Byron, his pregnant lover Claire, and a snide, repressed biographer, Dr. Polidori all spending a Saturday night at a mansion in Geneva.
Now, thought Don, let's see what happens if we give 'em loads of drugs, vats of wine, throw in a thunder-storm, a haunting, some scene-stealing goats, and let 'em go.

Now who do we get to direct? Hmm...

Russell doesn't disappoint, (he NEVER does, all his films, good or bad, have got something of interest in them) his imagination is at full throttle here.
It's frequently a furious and upsetting picture.
You can feel that creepiness as the protagonists decide to hold a s&eacute;ance, to call their darkest fears to exist in this world. Russell has a field day illustrating in detail what a houseful of stoned, tortured geniuses are afraid of in the depths of their debasement, with their guard temporarily down.

One grotesque tableau follows another but Russell never makes it easy for the rattled viewer. As to what's real and what's not, that's left open, as is the interpretation at the end.
Was it all suggestion and hallucination?  This reviewer isn't convinced, and Russell's leaving only the vaguest of clues.

It also works on a madcap comedy level. If you sit and think about what you've just seen, you WILL laugh, as with many of Russell's movies.

There are many redolent Russell repulses to rejoice in. A gory stigmata, a make-your-own-mind-up abortion, leeches, rats, incest, slime... In fact, if you can think of it, it's probably here, dowsed in Thomas Dolby's vivid score and competing like crazy with all the other fierce imagery.

There's an attractive funeral pyre sequence, filmed in the lake district involving Shelley. In his autobiography, Russell indicates this is how he would ultimately like to be 'disposed' of.
Good idea, better than cold earth, hope the weather's good so the 40 piece orchestra - assembled by Melvyn Bragg - don't get sodden, as they play Liszt or the Who at full blast!

Performances are good; particularly Gabriel Byrne as 'mad' Lord Byron and Natasha Richardson as proto-feminist Mary Shelley (and I'd love to hear the advice mum Vanessa Redgrave gave her about working with Russell. She may proclaim 'the Devils' to be her best film but she never worked with him again!), and I don't think Julian Sands performance as Shelley is as bad as reported either.
It's not great by any stretch but I've seen worse, and he IS playing a highly strung (out!?), self-suffering waif-in-a-storm, zonked out of his literary brains.

'Gothic' isn't Russell's best film but it is a good one. Compared to the output of most modern Hollywood directors, it's a masterpiece. It has wild imagery, some very tender and moving moments but most of all it has an atmosphere of utter dread, created masterfully by a visionary who knows instinctively how to use light and dark, sound and shadow and Richard Branson's money to make a looney entertainment about some of the worlds most respected and austere literary figures, verbally and physically abusing each other, raising the dead, ripping off their clothes and writhing round in slime.

A Ken Russell film, could it be anything else?",1204329600,11,3859,4.9306625577812015

It is a very particular vision of the famous night when Lord Byron, Percy Shelley and Mary Shelley spent a night in a country estate in Switzerland and decided to see who wrote the scariest story. Mary Shelley, of course, wrote Frankenstein out of that night. There are other movies on this subject - I think Roger Corman made one. Gothic is what one expects from Ken Russell - lurid, grotesque, hallucinatory, over the top. It hasn't been seen a lot since then, it hasn't become one of his classics, but it is a good film for those who like this sort of thing. And there is the addition of seeing the then young and upcoming English actors playing this - Natasha Richardson (as Mary Shelley), Gabriel Byrne (Lord Byron), Julian Sands (Percy Shelley), Timothy Spall.

417685,3,6302038324,"I have been fascinated by this film ever since its release in the 1980s, coincidentally at the same time I began a career as a high school literature teacher. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's nightmarish tale of a modern Prometheus, ""Frankenstein,"" is ostensibly the subject of this psychosexual romp by visionary Ken Russel. The viewer is invited along to a risque slumber party with a coven of the Romantic Era's most self-indulgent experimenters in free love, drugs, and the occult. The all-nighter takes place at Gordon Lord Byron's gothic mansion on Lake Geneva (actual location), and features his protege, the gifted and tragic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary, Percy's bride, and a few other messed up friends. According to Mary Shelley's own notes of introduction to her novel, considered by many to be the first and still the best gothic horror story ever written, her motivation to write Frankenstein came as a challenge from these very friends. This group set out during the course of one night to pen the most horrifying tale each could imagine, with the intention of outdoing one another. Mary's inspiration, she later claimed, came in the form of a nightmare, possibly drug-induced. This extended nightmare, and the long night that gave it birth, are the subject of Russel's movie. Strange, disturbing, at times revolting, but ultimately well worth viewing. If only it were less raunchy, I would recommend it to my high school students. But alas, it makes for great college dorm fare.",1200096000,4,1494,5.0772357723577235
417706,4,6302038324,"In its eighty-eight quicksilver-fast minutes of existence, Gothic packs in a lot of sheer frickin' sex-oozing  brain bashing madness among the literati of the Regency era. Forget for a moment their contemporary Jane Austen with her hoity-toity prim and proper tales of eye-batting heiresses and manner-infused country gentlemen, no, this is Ken Russell's take on how the age's reigning rock star poet, George Gordon, Lord Byron, spent one memorable, acid trip like weekend in a rented Swiss castle along with some ""unexpected visitors.""

The events that followed left Byron's friend, physician, and sexual admirer Doctor John Polidori suicidal, Byron's sometimes bedmate Claire Clairmont insane and pregnant, saw the radical Romantic poet Percy Shelley scampering naked, crab-like along the castle's rooftop during a thunderstorm babbling about electricity being the germ of life, and overwhelmed Percy's teenaged wife Mary with visions of death and tragedy to the point where she saw her own demise as the only escape. And oh yeah, the weekend also inspired Mary to produce an oft-misunderstood little novel you've probably heard of: it's called Frankenstein.

When things are done in Gothic, Byron has his way with just about everybody, no one is spared a bad acid trip's worth of crazed visions, and for those of us sitting back watching it all unfold, it's pretty interesting, particularly  if you come to the movie pre-loaded with the background story on the main characters and the legendary weekend about which Russell unabashedly speculates.

Gothic stands as the perfect antidote to all those saccharine-esque Hollywood feel-good movies you've been seeing lately. It gives the soul a good old-fashioned leech-bleeding.",1192665600,6,1727,5.453183520599251

Other than the cinematography and brilliant sets/costumes, Gothic is by no means a brilliant peice of cinema. The script is very muddy and you can tell Ken Russell took  A LOT of liberties with it for shock value! The eyes/breasts scene for example as well as the electronic harem stripper. But hey, wine mixed with opium could probably make you see these things. The difference is that most people would laugh out loud instead of being horrified.

The cast is first rate. Natasha Richardson, always the lady, makes this film her own. You empathise with her fears most of all because of Mary's tragic backstory. Sadly, Julian Sands and Gabriel Byrne although accomplished actors, are wasted here...especially Sands. He plays Percy Shelley like a little boy who has been told there's no such thing as Santa Clause. Byrne is great but his Lord Byron is shoved too far into the background for his performance to actually further the plot.

Overall the film is sufficient entertainment. Something to pop into the old DVD player on a boring weeknight when you need to take your mind off of the days worries.

Staged for an exercise in humanistic logic, scientific philosophy and creative writing, he gathers an odd assembly of thrill seeking Bohemian characters. Among the notables, are poet Percy Shelly, his author wife Mary, his personal physician, and of course their host, Lord Byron. Beginning with a blasphemous premise that they are imbued with the power to create life itself, Byron suggests they abandon their earthly inhibitions of morality and civil conviction and drink a concentrated draft of Laudium laced wine. The terrifying after effects manifest themselves in the literal passages later found in the poetic works of Percy Shelley or his wife's most famous novel Frankenstine. With a storm raging high above them, the group evokes sacred beliefs, sacrilegious rites and amoral concepts which create a frightening spectral atmosphere that nearly consumes them. Anyone seeking the foundation of the most popular Gothic monster ever created, should view this film. ****",1130371200,5,1159,5.4804469273743015
417711,1,6302038324,"First of all, the only reason I started watching this movie was because my roommate got it and we're both lovers of the Romantics. The only reason I kept watching this movie after the first 5 minutes was because I could already tell it was going to be completely and totally awful and would make for a few good laughs between the two of us.

Beyond some very basic facts about the party of writers, this movie is not grounded anywhere in reality. The acting is way overdone and quickly becomes grating. There is no plot whatsoever to speak of and the movie lacks any sense of clear direction or purpose -- it is simply a collection of random, inexplicable, and nonsensical events filled with frenzied sexuality, animalism, and vaguely-defined hallucinations. While I'm sure the actual experience was not entirely tame and prudish, I find it hard to believe that this is anywhere close to being accurate. Even when it tries to delve into pseudo-philosophical discussion about the nature of love, fear, poetry etc., that you would expect to emerge among these great literary figures (which, strangely, does not happen often)it utterly fails to make any understandable conclusions or statements and their real views, beliefs, and visions become hysterical ravings rather than the passionate philosophies that they were.

The film does not deal fully at all with Mary's creation of the Frankenstein story, nor do any of the other characters write ghost stories as Byron challenges them and as really took place. The idea that the story was born out of Mary's personal fears is an interesting one but this too spirals out of control and has almost nothing to do with Frankenstein.

The premise behind this disaster of a movie is a good one and I think with the right script, actors, and director it could be an amazing exploration of authorship, literary exploration and exchange, and this fascinating group of writers. That is not, however, what this film is.

P.S. If you do get seduced by the other reviews, pay particular attention to the scenes in the billiard room...I didn't know they had light bulbs in 1816!",1130284800,8,2111,4.871866295264624

Considering that I love horror movies and also the fact that I'm a big fan of Mary Shelly's writings, I decided to pick this one up. The story tells of one night when her and her friends get together to tell ghost stories, a night that resulted in Mary writing the novel ""Frankenstein"" and inspired Polidori to write the short novel ""The Vampyre"". Getting increasingly hysterical and hallucinatory as the night progresses, her and her friends achieve a creepy state of disorientation by the end of the film that only a true fan of this kind of film could appreciate. I'll admit, I was a little put-off by the film and its' weirdness at the start but, once I got into more, it turned out to be a pretty good one. Dealing with the psychology of dealing with your own inherent fears was what this movie was about, and, in that respect, that's what made this movie a creepy and haunting thriller. Sure, the acting is a bit terrible at times...even downright horrible but that's what makes this movie so likable. It's, definitely, a trip to watch. This movie will appeal to those who like the weird, strange, and extreme. I agree, this movie is one that should have accolades of appreciation shown to it.

I must say I never took the time to see it until I happened to come across Another film about the same thing HAUNTED SUMMER.I liked that little movie and became very interested in this situation about the Byrons and the shelleys getting together for Ghost story telling so I wanted more. I found GOTHIC On VHS finaly in a video store ,I was actualy dissapointed by GOTHIC at first because I had expected something realy much more shocking because by 21's century standards it is not so shocking now. However it is a fun film to whatch .I prefer haunted house stories and psycological horror to alot of the computer generated crap made now that isn't scary anyway. As this film says imagination is what creates the best monsters and ghosts. The historical background of this account helps make it more interesting ,it is simply a speculation loosly based on what may or may not have happened that summer in Villa Diodati, Switzerland. I believe that the actors are good except for the fact that the real Historical figures may have been slightly younger than this crew ,Gabrielle burn as Byron is so horribly out of shape and flabby he  would have been a total turn off to the ladies and the Historical Byron was always very cadaverously thin,the best mistake though is the actress who plays Mary Shelley is Kind of Hot  as the realy Mary was very plain looking atleast in her portraits. This is a fun film to whatch just to kick back with or it could make a nice backdrop when looking for your own inspiration if your into Horror writing or any creative venture[I don't however recommend most of the pethetic decadent behavior depicted by the characters in the GOTHIC of course]Contrast this film with EMMA with Gwyneth Paltrow set about the same time period.",1114646400,3,2140,4.493573264781491

Even without the fictional aspects being mixed in, the historical accounts of Percy and Mary, Claire, Polidori, and Byron are quite fascinating as well as entertaining in the movies, as evidenced by Haunted Summer.  But it was Coleridge who once coined the term ""suspension of disbelief"", and taking a compelling real-life account of how Mary Shelley came to write Frankenstein and mixing in generous elements of the fictitious in order to turn reality into a horror story can be fun indeed, especially when the story is capable of allowing you to suspend your disbelief.  And that's what this story does so wonderfully.  I remember loaning a copy of this movie to a friend many years ago, and then several days later she called me to express her disbelief that Polidori had drank a beeker filled with water and leeches.

417762,5,6302038324,"Gothic is one of Ken Russell's best films. Of course his work isn't for everyone, and I know some people just hate his movies, and complain about their content and self indulgence. But for me, these are some of his strong points, being prepared to experiment with his subject matter, and produce his own unique vision. Gothic tells of a meeting, in Switzerland, between: Byron (Gabriel Byrne), Shelly, Mary Shelly (Natasha Richardson), and two lesser known figures: Clair Clairmont and Dr Polidori.  The beginning and end of the film both look like period piece dramas. What comes in between is Ken Russell's unique vision. The characters, during a stormy knight, invent stories and create a monster of their own imaginations. These involve all of Ken Russell's favorite images for film (and hence the self indulgent criticism): Religion, vampirism, sumptuously films sets, a plot that verges on the fantastical, and nudity. Of interest though is the way the narrative deals with death, as there is an interesting sequence where Mary Shelly has visions of the demise of all the principles in the film. Of course it all ties in with the Birth of one of English literature's most memorable books: Frankenstein (by Mary Shelly).  Gothic is a Master Piece from Ken Russell, one of his most interesting films that challenges the viewer immensely. Sadly, however, not all will get it.",1083456000,31,1378,5.013100436681222

The format is pan-and-scan, and I do not believe any attempt was made to restore the print.  In fact, I would venture so far as to say this is simply the earlier VHS-formatted movie transferred directly onto DVD.  If, like me, you no longer own or use a VCR, or your VHS version is worn out, this DVD is worthwhile.

417764,4,6302038324,"Sometimes what is real is much more disturbing than what is make - believe.  This movie is a good illustration of this point.  Viewing ""Gothic"" with no foreknowledge of the history and background of the story is like watching a blood fetish porno with a plot.  What makes it a great movie though is that, although it seems too fantastical to be real, there is little make - believe.  The night when the Shelleys, Byron, his physician and his mistress (a relation of M. Shelley I believe) got together was more than just a gathering of writers.  It was a laudanum soaked Carnival.  Although a great amount of the story is melodramatic and fictional - especially toward the end - many more elements of the plot are real or are based on actual accounts of the writers' character.  Byron's aversion to blood and his fetish for the women in his wife's death mask for example are rumored to be true, so is Polidori's extreme Catholic persuasion, Shelley's hysterical laudanum fits, and Byron's skull.  Watch the movie, read in detail what happened that night, study the characteristics of each writer, than watch the movie again.  I guarantee a lot of the things which originally seemed ridiculous and out of place will be horrific and make for a great thriller when you realize they are not just bad screenwriting.  When you realize that some of the characters are acting strange and almost inappropriately (such as Percy's ever wide eyed look) it also helps to remember too that these people were all on a handful of different drug combinations including opium, liquor, and probably hash  so they are naturally not going to be acting normal, per se.  As a viewer you are also meant to see the events in this film as an onlooker to the party which includes watching them hallucinate and at times be drawn into their hallucinations (it should be noted though that some thing which appear like poor acting probably are).",1039046400,10,1913,4.728915662650603

417766,5,6302038324,"Ken Russell is one of the few directors who really brings a love of literature to his movies. His 1970 film of D.H. Lawrence's Women In Love remains one of the best filmed novels. But Ken Russell's tastes got wilder as he moved from film to film in the seventies and many of his seventies movies are a strange mix of high brow and low brow which pleases neither group really(Lisztomania, Mahler).  Then in 1979 he did a great horror film called Altered States which had him (ironically as it was a horror film) returning to the more controlled and coherent directorial style he exhibited before the period of excess. In the eighties he kept making horror films but they are very literate horror films, with a tongue in cheek kind of subversiveness which has fun with the material while not taking it too seriously. Gothic was made in 87.  I think its his best work of the horror genre and perhaps his best work since the D.H. Lawrence picture. Gothic has horror elements, in fact it is about the night that genre as we know it today was born. It is also very literate and its literary history is for the most part accurate. Julian Sands as Shelley and Gabriel Byrne as Byron make it seem like it was a lot of fun being a poet. They really act more like rock stars.... sex, drugs, and imagination is their daily regimen however. But the movie has a serious side too and a frightening side. Mary Shelley(Natasha Richardson) had a stillborn child and that is the impetus for her to write her famous Frankenstien. Everyone has deliriums but her deliriums which Ken Russell captures most poignantly keep the film from being just a romantic poet exploitation film. Her nightmares are based in real life horrors. She is really the center of this movie even though the male poets get to have all the fun and they do have a lot of bawdy and gaudy fun in that castle on the Swiss lake in view of Mont Blanc. This movie is visually stunning and at the end leaves you with an emotional resonance of having been through an unforgettable experience. Some people say Lair of the White Worm(Russells next film) is better than this but I don't see how. Gothic is a great looking film that takes a great story and adds to it all the visual delights the cinema has to offer but it is the story that remains with you. Lair of the White Worm is visually fun but there is no story to give those images a power or life beyond their momentary appeal. Gothic will appeal to those who know a bit about the romantic poets and painters and like their movies to have at least some redeeming value but can also have a purely visual and sensual appetite as well.",1008115200,4,2631,4.433884297520661

The ""Haunted Summer"" that Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron spent together doing drugs and engaging in whatever their hearts desired led them all to the very edge of madness. It's an incredible story. The movie however, is not the best tribute to these legends that I have ever seen. The cast is completely mis-matched Gabriel Byrne, Julian Sands, and Natasha Richardson head up the cast and they just don't work well together. Julian Sands, although a better actor now, was still quite a novice and his performance is simply unbelievable. Gabriel Byrne although physically matching for the part of Lord Byron doesn't put as much passion as he should've playing the mad poet. Natasha Richardson spends most of the movie trying to rationalize everything and doesn't reveal Mary's passion. It's a very dry movie that lacks the emotion needed to bring in the viewer.

The plot of the movie was actually a sparse skeleton on which the director attempted to hang every cliche that can be created about the world of Romantic literature.  The cast was fully packed with whining, egotistical self-innebriates.  I hope that the real people were not so annoying as their pretenders were.  Lord Byron (as portrayed in full hystrionic glory by Gabriel Byrne) makes (usually succesful) sexual advances on every other individual in the house; his wife Clara was as nutty as a fruitcake, finally ending up crawling in the mud with rats; his ""friend"" (no one treats him very well)the doctor tries to bleed himself dry by piercing his hands with a broken crucifix; Percy Bysshe Shelley sees ""something"" in the barn which drives him to the brink of sanity, and his wife Mary is inexplicably terrified of something that is never fully clarified. I try to always find something positive in a film.  Unfortunately in this case, the most positive thing that can be said about this trainwreck of a film is that the cinematography was appropriately moody--even if that meant that you could rarely see what was going on. Perhaps that was for the best.  If the sound had made it difficult to hear the dialogue, we would have had a much better movie.",973036800,,1758,4.753289473684211

7820052,5,6302038324,THIS film is worth the exuberant charges that Vestron charges. It is one of the few. I pass on most of their releases as they SHOULD be priced at about $15 max. Great film thats os better than ever. Great extras.,1519084800,,212,4.195121951219512

7820054,5,6302038324,"The Vestron Blu-ray is the ultimate & only version to watch! The film has been digitally restored: the transfer is unbelievable, the colors are vibrant, the dialogue is quick & witty. The film itself is nothing short of a surreal experience: you are immersed in the sheer excess of the moment! The character development is great, & basically, its all true! It gets rather bizarre in the second half, but it relates a drug-induced night which led to Mary Shelleys inspiration for her Frankenstein novel. You won't be disappointed!",1517270400,6,529,4.955056179775281
7820055,5,6302038324,"I was overjoyed when I heard that Vestron would be releasing this.  Gothic is one of those rare horror films that caught me off guard.  I remember seeing it on paid cable a few times and always taking the time to watch it.  It has this thing that many horror films lack today, atmosphere and true terror.
The story begins with the Shelly's (played by Natasha Richardson and Julian Sands) accompanied by Claire (Myriam Cyr) whom all pay a surprise visit to the enigmatic Lord Byron (played devilishly by Gabriel Bryne) .  On a dark and stormy night, the four decide to come up with a ghost story of their own which results in a sort of group hysteria in which their fears may have come to life.  The other standout actor in the film is Timothy Spall who plays the sexually repressed butler, he almost steals the show.  Bryne is in his top form here, oozing sexuality and charm with a touch of sadism on the side.  Everyone else plays their parts well.

The film is more of a fever dream than anything else.  Director Ken Russel has always been more about show than tell.  But you really feel immersed in this mansion of the macabre.  Many films always show the monster at some point, whether its a ghoul, demon, or guy with a mask.  Here we have a different kind of horror, fear itself.  We've all let our minds wander in the night, we wonder whats out there in the unknown.  A sound outside or in the closet makes our hair on the back of our necks go right up.  Is it a monster, or our imagination?

Vestron provides a great new 1080p transfer and as slew of special features, perfect for collectors
This film may not be to everyones tastes, but for lovers of weird and cult cinema, I'd highly recommend it.",1517270400,3,1707,4.371428571428571

Made very little sense, did not have any veracity as far as the behavior of the characters, don't have any idea if the characters had any relationship to their real-life counterparts (Shelly, Byron, etc.) If you are a horror fan, avoid this film.",1508630400,,362,4.417910447761194
