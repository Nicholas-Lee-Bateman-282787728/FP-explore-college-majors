8744618,2,B019C6X2I4,"I bought this because of Joe Flanigan. It's a kid's movie. Cute, but dumb. Bad guys are stereotypically stupid, so the dog outsmarts them. Not too funny.",1533600000,,153,4.703703703703703

8744621,4,B019C6X2I4,"The Bandit Hound is low budget movie, but this isn't a story that needs a big budget to be pulled off. No special effects, CGI or anything like that. All you basically need is a trained dog, that can pick up objects (in this case money in the form of notes or a sack), carry it around for a while and then bring it to an actor.  The canine actor, an Australian shepherd playing a dog named Bandit, does a brilliant job in this.  The main screen time roles belong to kid characters, but there's plenty of recognisable faces in the minor parts played by adult actors from TV shows that went of air long ago.  Catherine Bell (JAG) plays a single mother moving to town with her son. Lou Ferrigno (The Incredible Hulk) plays the mentally challenged muscle that is always in kids movies, his partner and Bandit's owner is played by Judd Nelson (The Breakfast Club).  None of the adult actors have meaty roles or anything, the dog and Owen a kid with no friends (Nicholas Alexander) who still plays with an action figure outside even though he's obviously older than the usual age kids play with these are the main screen time takers.  Basically due to some bank robbers stupidity, their dog Bandit is captured by police and sent to the pound.  Now you'd think the dog would be evidence, but somehow the pound puts it up for adoption and since Owen got decent grades in his previous school in Ohio, along with the obvious fact that he has no friends, his mother gives in to his wish for a dog.  Of course they get Bandit.  Bandit helps Owen to get somewhere with neighbourhood hot chick, who previously had her own dog save him from bullies outside her house. But Bandit hasn't given up his stealing cash ways.  Owen isn't too bright when it comes to proceeds of crime either using Bandit's loot to become the most popular kid amongst the female kids his own age, and some of the guys too.  Meanwhile Bandit's original criminal owners want him back so they can rob banks again.

It's not the greatest movie you'll ever see, but it is entertaining enough to pass an hour and a half your time.  It's a kids movie so at no time do you ever think Owen is any danger from bullies, bad guys or anything like that. Bombs have large digital countdown clocks on them and things like this. A tracking device the dog finds in the initial heist one of the bad guys tells the other ""Would you have seen it?""  Well it's pretty big so I would think the answer to that would be yes.  When there's injuries there's no blood.  Somehow old ladies are inside a bank when the bank is closed. I thought Owen was batting way out of his league with the first girl, and it became just a bit ridiculous when his he was getting compared to Zac Effron and was basically a chick magnet for every girl in the neighbourhood.  But perhaps since the majority of male kid viewers more likely look like Owen than Zac Effron this will be some sort of inspirational film for the masses.

The region 4 DVD has no special features, although there are bloopers that play during the credits.",1522886400,,3043,4.4053571428571425

8744626,4,B019C6X2I4,"Nice Movie.  The Dogs are Australian Shepherds.  The Adult Actors are some of my favorites.  While not heavily into a Christmas Theme, the background is Holiday Decorations and it is December if you like to watch Holidayish movies.",1489363200,,231,5.026315789473684
