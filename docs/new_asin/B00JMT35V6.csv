8652499,5,B00JMT35V6,"This was an interesting movie about a courageous woman who worked in a primarily men's occupation with bravery, brains and muscle to save lives. Inspiring!",1490832000,,155,5.24
8652500,5,B00JMT35V6,"I just wish there were more films like this. That looked at real heroines, successful women that the girls in our world today can look up to for their actions and brain rather than their possessions and or looks. Talent is something to be admired, but not idolized. This women and so many others have been lost in out history books. thank you Amazon for making this film available for the short time we have to watch it. I hope to see more like it on here.",1490572800,,456,4.252873563218391
8652501,5,B00JMT35V6,I had Marian Gagnon as a professor at Johnson & Wales University where I took many of her classes because I enjoyed her so much. She had talked about working on this several times but not in great detail but from what she had said I was already interested in learning more about this woman. The documentary was very enjoyable to watch and made me want to learn more about Ida Lewis. It was very nice to learn about another woman who has such an important place in history but has not been talked about enough.,1464048000,7,509,4.3125
8652502,4,B00JMT35V6,"This documentary provides us with a satisfying look at this woman lighthouse keeper's strengths and interface with Newport's culture and the larger American scene as it changed through her life. It focuses on Ida Lewis' heroics--the best publicized aspects of her life. It also uses animation in an interesting way to depict the drama of her rescues. I would like to know more about her relationships with her friends, like the Vanderbilt wife mentioned, and more about her marriage and reaction to it--stuff that might take extensive research and of which there might not be a record. Very nicely done.",1407801600,,603,5.04
