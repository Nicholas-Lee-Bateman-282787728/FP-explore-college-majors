1228361,4,B00000IQVS,Both Nick Nolte and James Coburn gives a performance of their career. And with co-star Dafoe and Spacek nearly as good this movie is a craftmanship in acting. One of the best movies of the last decade.,954374400,2,201,4.45945945945946
1228362,5,B00000IQVS,"Paul Schrander(Taxi Driver, Bringing Out The Dead) is a well-written and directed film.
Nick Nolte in a Powerful Performance as a screwed-up man, has a lot of problems in his head. He all mixed-up with a possible murder case, his daughter and his abused father(Extremely Well-Acted Performance By James Corbun in his Oscar Winning Role).
This film doesn`t always work, when a possible murder case involved. An uneven ending, you will feel sorry for Wade Whitehouse(Notle), his life was finish with his girlfriend leave him(Sissy Spacek) and all hell broke loose, he try to get along with his suffer daughter and his abused father.
Is the powerful performances makes the film strong. Grade:A.",954028800,3,691,5.123893805309734
1228363,4,B00000IQVS,"I don't see Nick Nolte movies. He does not do much for me, but he was so convincing in this role that it was scary. I got the uncomfortable feeling that I was evesdropping into someone's personal life. In this case, we are  privy to Nolte's frustrations and disintegration. One aspect that was  covered very well was Nolte's inability to take action and stand up for  himself. He's a big and frustrated guy who knows that he falls over too  easily and he hates that about himself. You won't see this kind of stuff in  movies and I doubt you will ever see it executed as well as this.",953769600,5,583,4.3119266055045875
1228364,4,B00000IQVS,"This film is a little gem. It is slow, sad, uncompromising and contains exceptional acting!  Nick Nolte is such a powerful actor.  His and James Coburn's performances are the heart of the movie.  Coburn won the Oscar,  but Nolte's part of an abused child who's now a loser of an adult is sooo  good that I can't see how HE didn't get the gold instead of Our Man Flint!  The final scenes with the final confrontation of father and son are  extremely powerful and some may find sort ofhard to take but they are worth  waiting for!  Willem DaFoe gives a good uncharacteristic gentle performance  too.  It's good to see Paul Schrader behind the camera in top form.",949968000,8,660,4.508474576271187
1228365,3,B00000IQVS,"A sad, slow and hard movie to like:Affliction, the film that restaured James Coburn's career and earned him an Academy Award, is a difficult drama. Directed with coldness and distance by Schrader, Affliction is about  a problematic sheriff who is scared of become like his old man, a violent  and full-of-rage person (Coburn, in a complex part- he does a great job).  After a so-called hunt accident, that ended up in the death of a powerful  man, Nolte's character decides to seek for the truth as a way in which he  may finnally find redemption. This is a Schrader film, so don't expect  happy endings, but is exactly this aspect that makes Affliction such a  vigorous psychological drama. There are very similar points between Copland  and Affliction, but Copland is more likable, once it has a redeemer ending,  and Affliction is a punch in the stomach. Nolte is perfect as a man who is  about to have a nervous breakdown, there is a particularly memorable scene,  in which Nick's  character is looking at himself in the mirror,  confused. This film is closely to a masterpiece, but the slow rythm and the  lack of basic action and emotion turns this drama into a good, but not  excelent, film.",944611200,5,1198,4.719806763285024
1228366,3,B00000IQVS,"Nolte is truly at his form here, and finds an equal in Coburne. The darkness of this film reveals itself early as we see an eager, but notably annoyed Nolte argueing with his (10-11?) year old daughter. She wants to go  home to her mother, as she does in every scene she is in. He wants her to  ""lighten up"" and have some fun. She can't obviously, because he  is a man on the edge. He is exceedingly paranoid, and we see this aspect  played out in spades between him and his brother, cameoed by Willum Defoe.  It's a dark road ahead for Wade Whitehouse, and he drags us along kicking  and screaming. I would have liked this movie much better if it had a point.  It all goes along by the numbers, Wade alienating himself from everyone  around him. Then at the end it seemed as though they cut out 15 or 20  minutes. It had no ""final confrontation"", no ""moment of  enlightenment"" that would justify what we had just witnessed.  Apparently the screenwriter thought that the burning of the garage was the  climax, and there was no point in going on. If that's true, then he should  have made up an ending. I don't know if a stand off would have worked  because that's not really what this movie is about. Maybe if he went after  his ex and got shot or something. I don't know, some kind of finality. The  voice over at the end just leaves you hanging, and I hate that! It's worth  renting if you are a movie buff and the shelves of the local video store  are looking pretty bare of original material.",932342400,,1496,4.2821428571428575
1228397,5,B00000IQVS,"As a recovering alcoholic this movie caused a tremendous sense of gratitude in me, because of my program I can't judge anyone but I can say 'but for the grace given me, there go I' .

1228399,4,B00000IQVS,"We are all bombarded from all sides by life. Too many hits from the wrong direction, the accumulation of many small bruises, could send any of us in Wade's direction. Many of us start life encumbered by the bruises of and from our parents and it is surprising that more people don't end up like Wade. It was at times painful to watch this film, especially when he gets rejected by his daughter, who he clearly loves, but can't connect with. Nolte brilliantly portrays a very troubled soul and gives us insight into why some people go off the rails. He engendered my empathy as he spun out of control. This is not a feel good movie, but a tour through the school of hard knocks.",1491436800,5,677,4.380952380952381
1228400,5,B00000IQVS,"This film forces you to go back and think about everything you have seen and heard.  If you weren't paying close attention it might seem to fall as flat as a pancake.  Everyone who is expecting a cookie cutter crime conspiracy with a happy Scooby Doo unmasking of the villain will be surprised.  The one slight weakness I will confess is that the voice over narrations at the opening and closing credits spell out things that likely would have been filmed if there had been another million dollars in the budget.  However, in a sleepy small town story like this, every extra minute may tax the audience's attention span.  It's unusual to see Nick Nolte as the victim of bullying but he pulls it off.  A story like this would not get made in 2017 because the third act pulls so far against audience expectations and doesn't telegraph exactly what kind of man the protagonist turns out to be.",1485993600,,890,4.566037735849057

1228402,5,B00000IQVS,"This is an amazingly accurate portrayal of how the damage of acoholism and abuse travels from one generation to the next - how horrors imbedded in the unconcious mind will eventually surface if they are not dealt with in therapy.

I teach psychology, and I still find this movie difficult to watch. I've seen families that look just this family (minus the Hollywood flare) with the alcoholism, violence, terror, and sadness moving from one generation to the next like some kind of horrific legacy.

This story will hit the victims of alcoholism very hard, but don't expect alcoholics to be changed by it; they can't see themselves.

1228501,3,B00000IQVS,It's really a simply story about a man who has an anger management problem which he inherited from his father as shown in flashbacks  that gets progressively worse as the movie goes on destroying the people around him with a side story involving a shooting of a local.

1228502,3,B00000IQVS,The acting was powerful and the story showed promise. But half way through it sort of petered out.

Having lived through this; the only thing that saved me was God and a Grandmother who sacrificed her whole life to give me a home and a saner and safer environment for shelter.  It is an all too common drama and I think a lot of it has to do with the ravages of War.  I am sure ""Wades"" father was a vet, and so was Wade,a Nam Vet who endured the hardness of life overseas and at home until he exploded!

1228534,5,B00000IQVS,"""Affliction"" portrays the nuanced small moments and the glaringly obvious stabs of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, in excruciating clarity. The devolution of Nick Nolte's character, Wade, as the son of a verbally and physically abusive father (James Coburn) is rigidly en point.

We are first aghast, to see Wade disappoint his young daughter  and find himself disappointed in his actions. From that point, there is the continuing spiraling downward into drink, upset, and chaos, as Wade loses control over perceptions of his closest friends, his coworkers, his boss, his lover, and possibly even his family members. He's uncertain whom he's become, as his anger and sadness heightens.

Throughout the film, the audience is given clues, as to the truth of the matters  yet we remain substantially unclear as to whether Wade's version of events is correct. Only the brother's voiceover leads the viewer to some sense of true events.

In the end, the sad truth is that Wade has been more burdened than the audience may have suspected. This truth cost him more than he could bear.

The looks of his face portray the abused and shamed boy who is never able to leave it all behind. James Coburn is so real he gives you goosebumps.

1228591,4,B00000IQVS,"James Coburn won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in this 1998 movie, and the movie wouldn't work at all unless he dominated it, as he, in the role of Glen Whitehouse, dominates the life of his son Wade (Nick Nolte), and he is in effect the source of the ""affliction"" of the title.  An abusive, decisive, alcoholic, misogynistic man, he drives one son, Rolfe (Willem Dafoe), to extremes of detachment and Wade, who is less reflective and more emotional, to the hard task of both trying to be a better man and father than his dad and at the same time convincing himself and his dad that there are other models of masculinity than Glen's -- but Glen is the only model he has, and when Wade feels put-upon and under-rated, as he feels in his work for the slimy Gordon LaRiviere (Holmes Osborne), and in his custody battles with his ex-wife (Mary Berth Hurt), he reacts pretty much as his father would react, hard as he tries to resist such behavior.  For most of the movie, Wade is suffering from toothache, and the point is that consciousness of pain blots out everything but the consciousness of one's pain.  The tooth comes out eventually, and it's no surprise that Wade's pain doesn't disappear -- his real affliction goes far deeper, as we've known pretty much from the start.  He wants to be good, but he doesn't know how -- and the movie, and Willem Dafoe's performance, makes clear that Rolfe's path of detachment is far from a satisfying response to his situation.  You might be tempted to say that at least Rolfe does no harm -- but (trying to avoid spoilers here) by the end of the movie, it's not clear that that is the case.  From the apparently safe haven of Boston, where he teaches, Rolfe displays questionable judgment about his brother's judgment upin New Hampshire -- which he is too remote to appreciate and evaluate first-hand.

There's plenty of intensity, then, and the director and screenwriter Paul Schrader builds it up to a climax that's consistent with what has gone before.  If I have a reservation about the movie, it is that the set-up is a bit too neatly schematic -- ""Those to whom evil is done/Do evil in return,"" says Auden, and the family dynamic is just about that simple.  But thanks to the acting, the audience buys in, and the effect is, to use the familiar cliche, like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  Coburn is superb, and Nolte gives a performance that is raw and touching, even as one deplores his decisions and his life becomes ever more chaotic.  The cinematography is great too -- the movie is in color, but the snowy bleakness of small-town, rural New Hampshire captures the sense of entrapment and isolation that are part of Wade's affliction.  One could complain that the music cues for ""ominous"" a little too obviously, but still -- the movie will draw you in.",1435017600,,2839,4.6

1228618,5,B00000IQVS,"AFFLICTION is a devastating film. Childhood abuse brought on by one father and all the destruction it brings to so many is at the center here. Layers of family ties and layers of destruction centered around a father's abuse even though he is now old and weary, yet still abrasive and never letting go of his capacity to abuse and hurt those he finds weak continues into the abyss of those caught up in his world. Nick Nolte is the son, now the adult, who's life and behavior has been forever affected at the hands of his abusive father, James Coburn.

The film is seen mainly through the eyes of the main character played by Nick Nolte, but his every action action, every his word we eventually is an affliction caused by his father James Coburn. Nolte's younger brother is the narrator who does show up in the film and he too has an effect on Nolte.

Nick Nolte's Brother's closing words sum it up, ""The historical facts are known by everyone. All of Lawford, all of New Hampshire, some of Massachusetts. Facts do not make history. Our stories, Wade's and mine, describe the lives of the boys and men for thousands of years: boys who were beaten by their fathers, whose capacity for love and trust was crippled almost at birth, men whose best hope for connection with other human beings lay in detachment, as if life were over. It's how we keep from destroying in turn our own children and terrorizing the women who have the misfortune to love us; how we absent ourselves from the tradition of male violence; how we decline the seduction of revenge. Jack's truck turned up three days later in a shopping mall in Toronto. Wade killed Jack, just as surely as Jack did not kill Evan Twombley, even accidentally. The link between Jack and Twombley, LaRiviere and Mel Gordon existed only in Wade's wild imaginings. And briefly, I admit, in mine as well. LaRiviere and Mel Gordon were indeed in business. The Parker Mountain Ski Resort is now advertised across the country. The community of Lawford, as such, no longer exists. It is an economic zone between Littleton and Catamount. The house is still in Wade's name, and I keep paying taxes on it. It remains empty. Now and then, I drive out there and sit in my car, and wonder, why not let it go? Why not let LaRiviere buy it and build the condominiums he wants there? We want to believe Wade died that same November, froze to death on a bench or a sidewalk. You cannot understand how a man, a normal man, a man like you and me, could do such a terrible thing. Unless the police happen to arrest a vagrant who turns out to be Wade Whitehouse, there will be no more mention of him. Or his friend, Jack Hewitt. Or our father. The story will be over, except that I continue.""",1419984000,,2719,4.479838709677419

But the title of the film tells you everything you need to know about the film and the character Nolte plays. I've seen all of Paul Schrader's films. And I have to say it's one of his best.

1228684,3,B00000IQVS,"I've always been a big Nick Nolte fan. He's a great actor and has proven it time and time again. In this film, he keeps it going, giving a great performance. Watching him as Wade Whitehouse is fun, because he's so good. But in this film, he's also hard to watch. Well, the character is. At first, you feel bad for him, as his daughter clearly doesn't want to spend time with him. However, about three minutes into the film, you discover what a piece of crap this guy is. He's the local cop, but he smokes weed, drives drunk, attacks his ex-wife's new husband for no reason, has no control over his emotions, and without giving it all way, does a lot more idiotic and rude things. Usually, the main character is the person you root for, but in this film, it's simply impossible. They made this character go too far and not retain any qualities worth admiring. A Simple Plan got it right with Bill Paxton's character, who is a good enough man that the audience can forgive him for the bad things he sometimes does. Not the case with Wade Whitehouse. Another aspect about this character that was annoying was his bluntness. Usually, a person (especially a police officer) that is becoming suspicious of a situation and the people involved will keep their suspicions at bay. Wade can't keep his stupid mouth shut and blurts them out in front of everyone, even the people he is suspicious of. Moving on to other aspects, the dialogue, acting, and direction are good, as is the story. I just think it could have been better if they took some other turns. Sure, the end explains it all quite well, but it just doesn't seem very satisfying for some reason. Sissy Spacek, Willem Dafore, and James Coburn are also great, but they can't save this from being a three-star picture. It runs a tad long, as there are some unnecessary scenes that really don't help the story in any clear way. Would I watch it again? No. Am I upset that I did watch it? No. It was worth checking out, at least just to see Nolte's awesome performance. I'm still shocked he hasn't keeled over.

While the acting was good, the plot was horrible.  Not really a murder mystery at all, but about a dysfunctional family (who doesn't have one??) and a man spiraling out of control, blaming it all on his upbringing.  I do agree that parents can sometimes inflict horrific pain on children, emotionally and physically.  I grew up with an alcoholic father and an angry, out-of-control, physically and emotionally abusive mother, much like the father in this movie.  I did not, however, end up a failure in life and blame my parents, or kill them.  If I could have given this a negative rating, I would have.  I don't understand all the high ratings.

1228784,5,B00000IQVS,"I must say that watching the ""Affliction"" was a depressing experience, although not beacuse of the quality of the movie - it is simply that the story is so unbearably sad. The movie starts in gray and ends in black, without virtually any brighter momenent.

Nick Nolte's performance as Wade, a man who wasted his life and is unable to save anything from the wreckage is one of the saddest things I saw on the screen those last years. James Coburn gives a GREAT performance as Wade's old father, a violent, bad mouthed and bad tempered drunk without anything good in him. Sissy Spacek plays Wade's girlfriend, his last chance to save something from the catastrophy that was his life, a chance he will finally not seize.

Willem Dafoe plays a little but significant role, as Wade's younger brother, who without even really wanting it actually will push him over the edge, to the abyss... Finally Jim True-Frost (credited as Jim True), who later landed a big role as detective Roland Pryzbylewski in HBO's series ""The Wire"", plays the role of Jack Hewitt, Wade's best friend, who has the bad luck to be in the wrong place at a wrong time during a hunt...

This is the kind of movie I didn't really realise was made in USA anymore - it shows the poor, rural, mostly white America (here the New Hampshire), where a local businessman and mayor can really rule as a feudal lord in the Dark Ages and where there is so much misery (social as well as economical) that one of characters actually freezes to death in her house in winter, because there is no money to repair the heating - and her relatives have all but forgotten about her...

In a way this film was more horrifying to watch than most of the horrors I saw. Seeing the total destruction of a man, who already was down, is a horrible vision - but it can make a really good movie. You will not have fun watching it, but I think you can like it anyway.",1355184000,3,1902,4.441260744985673
1228785,1,B00000IQVS,"I saw that this movie had a four star rating and given that it was one that I had never heard of (let alone seen) coupled with the fact that it was free on Amazon Prime, I thought I would give it a whirl.  That was an unfortunate mistake that cost me two hours of my life.

I don't really understand what people think is so great about this movie.  If you like rambling, surreal and nearly incomprehensible dialogue from Nick Nolte mixed in with copious quantities of gratuitous domestic abuse fueled by raging alcoholism, then you will love this movie.  If, however, you're looking for a plot that centers around a murder mystery you will be sorely disappointed as the story takes 30 minutes of rambling to finally make its way to the death and then gives it about 10 minutes of treatment throughout the ensuing 85 minutes, only to be wrapped up in a completely unsatisfying denouement at the end.

I have never rated a movie before but this one was so bad that I felt it incumbent upon me to warn others away from this train wreck of a film (in very slow motion, I might add).  The only reason I gave it one star is because you're not allowed to give it no stars, but even that would be generous because I think it deserves a negative star or two.  The fact that an actor won an Academy Award for his part in this movie just goes to show how out-of-touch the film cognoscenti are with movies that are actually entertaining to those of us that didn't get a degree in Film.",1354492800,2,1473,4.315217391304348

1228811,5,B00000IQVS,"Some films are just escapist fun and make us laugh, sometimes cry, just so that we can forget our daily realities.  Some films are full of fleshy textures that grab our psyche in some hidden recess of the mind and we are transfixed, unable to turn our eyes away, like we often do when passing a terrible road accident or taking notice of a long convoy of mourners on their way to a burial.  The title of this film ""Affliction"" is so perfectly apt and descriptive and sets the tone immediately.  Throughout the film there is a relentless, twisting anxiety that disturbs and sets our nerves on edge.  The premise of the film vibrates on a scale larger than most lives and it takes on a slightly metaphorical and almost dream like quality.  Which is not to say that some lives don't unravel as badly as Nick Nolte's character.  His characters decline is like a slow-motion avalanche, cascading down a very large mountain, picking up mass and momentum with each new twist and turn.  When the end finally comes to the character it is not anticlimatic but feels inevitable.

This film can be very disturbing to those who have suffered brutality from the hands of a close family member, especially when they were young.  It is passing strange that another of Nolte's famous characterizations, in ""The Prince of Tides"" also touches on exactly the same nightmarish childhood traumas.  Nolte's acting techniques, as much as they are often explosive on the outside, with rapid body gestures and movements, with that strained smokers voice....they are here. But the substantial power is all internalized; one look at that face and we know how much pain is registered at the moment it penetrates, deep inside.  He is a very open and emotive actor who makes room in himself for the story to work its alchemy.  James Coburn's leering, sickly, dangerous, almost psychopathic character makes everyone on edge when he is awake.  That one scene where Nolte and girlfriend (Cissy Spacek) go to visit his parents and they can't help but notice that the house is freezing cold....and they find his dad drunk asleep but unharmed....and we just know that something terrible has happened upstairs.  This type of gut wrenching drama drives the story into the despair that lies at the core of the family.  Nolte's brother (in the film: Willem Dafoe) portrays the calm and detached spirit of someone who long ago removed himself from the family quicksand.  However, in a telling scene where he tells his brother (Nolte) that at least he didn't grow up suffering from the brutality of his father, Nolte laughs, asking him ""is that what you think,eh?""  One wonders which one of the brothers were more fully engaged with the family traumas?

This a very powerful and unsettling film, with a tense angst shot through from the beginning to the end.  The cast is strong throughout.  Many have commented that this might be Nolte's finest performance.  His role in ""The Thin Red Line"" is equally moving and gut wrenching.  This is an adult drama that lingers in the mind and is worthy of a good film library.  Highly recommended....and shot up in Quebec, of all places.",1302566400,3,3133,4.793296089385475

The subject matter is very dark about child abuse and alcoholism and how they are passed down generation to generation and how victim of it are not given the life skills to deal with life, much less difficulties in life. An excellent movie.",1295395200,2,452,4.6625
1228813,3,B00000IQVS,"Affliction has snow scenes going for it. I love snow. What it doesn't have is bleakness. It's too busy--in a muddled kind of way--for bleakness. Which makes me wonder what went wrong. The film boasts great location work, actors who are up to the task, and a functional script. So what makes it just an average film?

The only thing I can think of is the pacing--the rhythm of the drama unfolding and the space surrounding the performances. Schrader and his editor just don't seem to feel the weight of incidents. They don't understand actors' reactions and the importance of pauses. They seem to think verisimilitude requires abstaining from manipulation (art!).

I also have problem with the all-bad father, the petulant daughter, and the general sense that we are dealing with stock-characters. Spacek seems wasted, Cobburn a caricature. Nolte does fine, but would make a stronger impression under the guidance of a better director (an actor's director?). Schrader seems almost uninterested in his characters individuality, as opposed to their narrative positions.

The transfer itself is mediocre. To some extent its hum-drum quality reflects the intended dull look of the film. I'm all for mat finish, but not at the expense of detail and presence.

If I had to sum it all up, I would say the film lacks PRESENCE, without being able to say with certainty how that's possible. An intriguing failure, given the medium.",1294444800,2,1420,5.029787234042553
1228814,3,B00000IQVS,"This is a well made film and I really wanted to like it.  Nick Nolte is a favorite and he certainly delivers a powerfull, deeply human performance here.  James Coburn is perfect as his truly odious abusive father.  Nolte has a way of making his characters sympathetic even when they are doing horrible things.  We can see from the opening scene, a Halloween party where he tries to amuse his daughter, that the guy is trying to do the right thing but that he's never going to make it.  He has the ""affliction"" and nothing he does works out.

From this unhappy start things only get worse.  That's the problem with the film--there's no contrast between light and dark, tragedy and happiness.  No one grows, develops, changes.  I'm not saying that every film has to have a happy ending but just watching someone go down and down before your eyes isn't worth watching.  Yes, it makes the point---that abusive fathers breed flawed children--but this is hardly news.

Some good actors are wasted.  Sissy Spacek didn't seem right for the part.  I kept wondering what such a nice girl saw in this train wreck of a guy.  Willem Dafoe, who has done a lot of good work, just seems creepy  here and his role as the omnipotent teller of the tale doesn't quite work for me.

Nolte's rivetting performance kept me watching.  Maybe that was the problem; he's such an innately likable guy that it was too horrible to see his character just go down the tubes.  Like the Sissy Spacek character, I wanted to believe in him.

It's visually stunning but that's because most of it is shot in the snow and snow scenes are almost always gorgeous.

I give it three stars just for Nolte's performance. Don't expect to be inspired, uplifted, entertained or to learn anything.",1283126400,13,1748,4.613636363636363

Nolte, the central character, was never better:  a tormented man, he has lost his family, his job is in jeopardy, and he must take on the caring for his alcoholic and abusive father.

The plot turns on a suspicious death, which Nolte wants to investigate as sheriff.  However, as he enters a terrible downward spiral, he begins to burn all of his bridges and eventually loses his grip.

1228842,4,B00000IQVS,"I want to start by saying that on paper, `Affliction' is one of the most impressive character studies I've ever had the privilege of reading.  The novel, written by Russell Banks (that author I keep touting as the greatest American writer of all time), is an outstanding piece of literature; a marvelous study of the slow progression of anger, pain, misery and ultimate insanity.  On paper, `Affliction' is a masterpiece; on the screen, `Affliction' is merely a good movie.

It is a good movie, don't get me wrong, but this is not a great movie.

The problem lies in the pacing, so honestly I guess I can heap all the blame on director Paul Schrader.  The thing about the novel is that Banks has this beautiful way of allowing his characters to stew in their own predicaments.  There are long passages that seem to just build more tension and cast more darkness over the story and the characters within it.  I think back to what Atom Egoyan did with `The Sweet Hereafter', allowing the sweeping views of the snow covered town to bring to life the `stillness' of Banks novel.  He complemented the script with his expert direction.  `Affliction' seems a little too rushed.  The script is impeccable, much like `The Sweet Hereafter', changing very little in adaptation and staying very true to what Banks originally penned.

I can't help but think that this film would have been perfect had it added about thirty minutes of silence; interjecting random scenes of serene camera movement throughout the bustle of the story to establish the mood needed to elevate this film and bring it to the novel's level.

The film tells the story of Wade Whitehouse, a man pushed to the edge of his very sanity thanks to the people all around him.  He lives in the same small town in which he grew up.  He works the same dead end thankless job he's worked almost all his life.  He's tormented by memories of an abusive childhood and he's struggling to win the war against his ex-wife over the affections of their daughter Jill.  A series of events (an accidental death of a well respected man and the death of Wade's mother) start a domino effect almost, causing Wade to drift rapidly into the depths of insanity.

The film lacks the emotional impact the novel did, for the novel allowed us time to appreciate the mental deterioration overtaking Wade, and it gave us enough background in order to understand it.  Here, his freefall seems almost too sudden at times.

Performance wise though, this is a goldmine.  I am not a fan of Nick Nolte.  I find his breed of overacting to be a hindrance to the films he inhabits.  In fact, aside from his rather surprisingly controlled performance in `Cape Fear' I have hated everything he's done.  This though, is a masterclass.  Honestly, the fact that this is Nolte floors me.  He has such deep understanding of Wade's character (maybe even more so than Schrader) and he exhibits that knowledge in every movement he makes.  He delivers such a grounded and emotionally rich performance here; I'm stunned.  James Coburn won the Oscar for his sadistic portrayal of Wade's abusive father, and while I'm not sure I'd hand him the Oscar I do believe he is marvelous here.  Sissy Spacek is not the face I pictured when reading the novel, and so casting her as Margie seemed a bit off, but she works wonders with the part.  These performances feel so small yet hit you very hard.  They work far better than the film itself.

In the end I have to say that this is a very good movie, and if you have not read the novel you may even consider this a great movie.  I was expecting a little more time invested in establishing the dark serenity that comes from reading Banks' work, so I was disappointed with Schrader direction.

Still, the film is a solid B, but the novel is an A+.",1228780800,4,3792,4.603576751117735

1228846,5,B00000IQVS,"I never watched Affliction until a few days ago, and was pleasantly surprised. The story centers around Nick Nolte, who plays a small town cop going through a rough patch, with a failed marriage, and a young daughter who seems to be growing apart from him. He pursues a shooting case that he suspects is a murder conspiracy, and things get more complicated when his mother dies, forcing him to take responsibility for an aging dad who is also violent &abusive [played convincingly by James Coburn].

There are frequent flashbacks by Nolte to his violent childhood [the make-up people did a great job in portraying a youngish looking James Coburn], and Coburn does a great job playing the abusive, alcoholic father who rages at his family [wife, and two sons].

There are good supporting roles here besides James Coburn...there is Sissy Spacek who plays Margie, the supportive lover to Nolte's character. There is Willem Dafoe, who though has limited screen time, provides the voice-over narration for the movie & also plays the younger son, Rolfe, who distances himself from the domestic tragedy that is his past by pursuing a scholarly life.

The story is not really anything new: a violent and abusive legacy that torments Nolte's character, begging the question: is the cycle of violence & abuse something that is cyclical, doomed to be repeated through successive generations? Yet, despite the predictable storyline, the acting is excellent, and the story moves along at a steady pace, as we slowly witness Nolte's cop character being driven slowly but surely towards the brink... a dark and tragic story that makes for compelling viewing.",1183593600,4,1643,5.055350553505535

1228848,5,B00000IQVS,"I saw this outstanding yet very disturbing movie shortly after it came out.  It staid with me and, as I had a chance to see it again tonight, it still makes a very strong impression.

The premise of the movie sounds like the old Biblical proverb that the sins of the fathers are visited upon the sons.  Most of us have seen a lot of truth in that adage.  Likewise most of us never had a father like Wade did in ""Affliction"".  This is an extreme lesson in that Wade's father (played excellently by James Coburn) is an alcoholic, abusive, #%@**&$.

The movie develops the theme extremely well.  We start out with seemingly but tellingly innocent glimpses of Wade's incompetance as a father.  He is divorced, his young daughter is with him for Halloween, he can't think of much to say to her and keeps finding ways to leave her to go out and gab with the guys.  The movie gets our attention with the emergance of a somewhat interesting plot.  However, all along we become a bit more uncomfortable with the character of Wade.  Yet, if we think Wade is weird, we KNOW that his father is psychotic.  Coburn won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant and haunting preformance an the evil father.  Events create the need for Wade to move back home with his father and that's when things really go downhill for him.  Enough about the plot!  The power of ""Affliction"" is in the characters of the father and son.  This movie will disturb you and some may want to challenge the message.  Fair enough.  I certainly can't complain about my upbringing so I don't have a point of comparison.  However, I have noticed, over the years, little picadillos that confuse me until I remember their origen im my childhood.  I believe that the basic premise is true and the auther, to make a point, picked a extreme example.

Now, don't get me wrong, the film is a compelling, well-made portrait of man's descent into madness, but the tone and subject matter are designed to disturb, and that's exactly what they do.

Nick Nolte stars as Wade Whitehouse, the only policeman in the kind of small New Hampshire town where a lone policeman has enough time on his hands to also act as a school crossing guard and plow the snow off the streets. A hunting accident leaves a rich man visiting town dead, but the man who was with him - Wade's best friend Jack - didn't see it happen, so he assumes that the man accidentally shot himself. Wade thinks there is more to it than that, and that Jack may have killed him for money.

As Wade continues to think about the crime, he gradually loses more and more touch with reality. It doesn't help that since his mother's death, he's been spending more time with the abusive father (James Coburn in a brilliant performance) who has had more influence on him than he'd like to think. Wade never even sees it coming that he's turning into his old man. As Wade's delusion increases, his relationships with his daughter and his girlfriend (Sissy Spacek) deteriorate.

Nolte delivers powerfully in the lead role. It's a terribly difficult part to pull off, but he plays it with the exact amount of nuance that few actors can deliver. He makes us truly feel for Wade, especially during the scenes with his daughter, where he's just trying to be a good father, but he has no blueprint for good fatherhood because his own was so awful.

James Coburn plays the constantly-drunk father who has no need for anybody or anything except himself and his alcohol. The first time we meet the distant old man in the present day, he doesn't even need heat in his house - even if it kills his wife. Only as we learn more about the father do we learn more about Wade's affliction.

There is what I feel is unnecessary narration at a few points throughout the film. This is done by Willem Dafoe as Wade's brother Rolfe. Despite this, I know that this is what critics would describe as a ""good"" film, but I feel I can only recommend it to those who would like to trek into highly unconventional territory - the kind that digs under your skin and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.",1110153600,6,2358,4.474418604651163

It's bleak-just like life.  Nolte and Coburn have never been and probably never will be better.  The writing is superb.  There are so many lines that ring true.

Two steps forward but three steps back many times and it was hard to watch the disintegtration of Wade.  His father was not very effective in helping him deal with tough life challenges.

1228882,4,B00000IQVS,"A film about the impossible relations between a father and a son, with a second younger son in the background. The father is an alcoholic. He is violent and brutal. He educates his sons, always under the influence, with the most tyrannical hand he can manage in that state. He terrorizes his wife and he blocks his sons in defensive attitudes. The elder son will turn aggressive and paranoid. The younger son will remain aloof and protect his sanity by this distance. The mother will suffer and eventually die. The elder son reproduces his father's domineering attitude with his wife and daughter and gets into a divorce that he negociates wrongly, accepting everything from his wife not to appear like his father, but to appear like a good father. This leads to impossible relations with his daughter that reacts defensively at once, keeping her distance with this father of hers she probably loves, because she needs him, and hates because she cannot communicate with him. He tries to do good but imposes it so harshly at times that a treat at a restaurant becomes an ordeal. Then he has to take care of his widowed father and that makes him jump over the edge of the abyss. A hunting accident becomes for him the core of a plot against him and teh community, and he becomes Jesus Christ the justice maker in his village. He sees some speculation but misses the point, which is the development of a skiing resort in the village, promoting it into a rich community. He does not want any change : he wants his explosive self to keep the environment that produced that explosive nature of his, which is morbid. This leads to his justice trip, killing the cause of his paranoia, killing a presumed assassin that is no assassin at all, and disappearing in the limbos of anonimity with two deaths on his conscience. This film could have been a masterpiece if it had not been told from the point of view of the younger son, but from the point of view of the elder son, which means from these limbos of society where he has finally recovered some distanciation that could produce a perspective, a vista back over his life. In other words we only have a thriller and we never come to a human tragedy.

Rated R for language and mild child abuse.
Director Paul Schrader's account of the troubles that child abuse can bring to those afflicted much later in life--the everlasting affect that the criminality and brutality of the fear it can cause.  ""Affliction"" is not an uplifting film and it tends to drag throughout, but it can at times be very powerful and depressing.  Small-town New Hampshire constable Nick Nolte investigates an accidental shooting that he believes to be murder; meanwhile, his personal life deteriorates as he is haunted by a horrific childhood terrorized by a drunken, abusive father (played brilliantly by James Coburn, who would earn an Oscar for the role).
The story twists and turns between two themes, but mainly gets tangled and disjointed by the end of the film.  Schrader does not seem confident in choosing to focus more on the murder conspiracy or the father-son relationship between Nolte and Coburn.  While Coburn's performance was celebrated, Sissy Spacek is very good as Nolte's wife and William Dafoe is perfectly casted as the concerned, loving brother.  The final result of ""Affliction"" is melodramatic, slightly bleak, and overall implausible; however, the excellent roles carry this motion picture from the gutter and heighten it as a moderately effective drama.",1085529600,3,1442,5.293859649122807
1228885,4,B00000IQVS,"""Affliction"" is a rare peephole into the abyss of our weaknesses - then a downward spiral into desolation and fear, or, as one character puts it: ""Man's seduction into revenge.""
Paul Schrader, who wrote ""Raging Bull"" ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The Mosquito Coast,"" works here from Russell Banks' novel. Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte) is a second-rate sheriff in wintry, upstate New Hampshire who doubles as a worker for a landscaping contractor (Holmes Osborne) to make ends meet. He lives in a trailer. He wears flannel sweatshirts and raggedy coats. He smokes marijuana, drinks incessantly. Wade's  pushed by almost everyone, his mind is half-clogged by his ex-wife (Mary Beth Hurt), a distant, cold woman who took Wade's equally distant, cold daughter with her when they divorced.
Nolte, in the best work of his long career, has a chewed-up face, bad haircut, slouchy demeanor. But his presence looms larger in ""Affliction"" than it ever has before. His outbursts of anger are matched solely by his father, Glen (James Coburn). Through flashbacks Glen's character is fleshed out as less a man than a force of hatred, tainting all those around him.
Rarely has been a performance so wickedly effective. Coburn, who won the Academy Award for this role, snarls, growls, cackles; he's a derivative of evil, a man who's been allowed to rule by fear and intimidation, a man who, when his wife dies, is still taken in by the son who truly hates him.
Their toxic kinship is surrounded by a curious murder investigation that serves as a catalyst to Wade's descent. It seems a town bigshot (Sean McCann) accidentally shot himself with a rifle in a hunting accident. Wade thinks otherwise. Possibly it was a murder. There is some evidence to support it, though ""Affliction is no whodunit. Wade perceives the murder as a chance to finally best his detractors; we know it will only sink him further.

By the end, all of Wade's problems sink into one, and they all lead to one place: dad's house.",1069891200,4,1973,4.886567164179104
1228886,5,B00000IQVS,"The movie starts with Wade Whitehouse bringing his daughter to a small town Halloween party. The distance between the two is apparent and about to get worse. They arrive, daughter dressed as a tiger, Wade dressed as a cop. He is a child dressed as a man. The daughter is out of place and unhappy, making this known to Wade. Facing a challenge that is beyond him, he steps outside where he is pulled into the life of some younger people, driving around town, getting stoned and being generally small-town.
Why does Wade shy away from being a man? Because his definition of a man is his father, an abusive and alcoholic ogre. Wade has found peace in being a parody of an adult. He can hang with kids just shy of high school because he has not permitted himself to grow any older than just-short-of-manhood. He is pathetic, but he is also very amiable. He could live his whole life this way. That is, he could if he hadn't already committed to fatherhood and if the new love of his life didn't expect a bit more.
His new love, Marge, is a small town woman through and through. Perhaps she has been passed around a bit, but she has a good heart. She seems barely content with drifting through life, staying just short of ambitious. Perhaps she'll marry her bear-cub boyfriend Wade and have a family while she can. Perhaps not. She is smarter than Wade, but he is fun and harmless, it seems.
Wade's brother, Rolfe, is the kid who managed to avoid the blows of his father. He is the smart one. Smart enough to stay far enough away from his father, smart enough to distract himself from the ruins of abuse with intellectual pursuits. His intelligence bought him a way out. He is committed only to himself.
Exposing his own aggression, Rolfe plants seeds in Wade that will soon be Wade's undoing. To Rolfe, it's all a bit fun. When he's back in his home-town, he returns to a role. He and Wade are kids up to no good. They are sleuths, unlocking the truth of the grown-ups. There is no risk to Rolfe since his brother has and will be the shield.
Wade's role is stressed in a series of events. He has been powerless in keeping his family together. His ex-wife outgrew him and has moved on. He is powerless against even the will of his daughter. He has not seemed to even notice that she is not 6 anymore, and that she has begun to recognize his shortcomings. All this, he must change.
He had been handed the role of a cop, not for merit, but for obedience to the town's owners. This must change.
His father has become incompetent and might have even let his mother die from exposure. Wade becomes the head of the household and thus launches his new interest in a commanding role. But a commanding role requires a man. For Wade, a man is a monster. Needless to say, it doesn't go well for Wade and all who surround him.",1038096000,17,2809,4.383141762452107

It's a testament to both Nolte and Holmes Osborne that they pull off the scene; the two younger actors look rattled.
The same spontaneous violence happens in other places. Nolte pulls off the contradictions well; he's good-hearted but powerless, violent and contrite. ""I'm like a kicked dog,"" he says, ""and one day I'm gonna bite."" And it's easy to believe.
Unfortunately, his performance doesn't carry the film. Jim True, as Jack, is unconvincing. The grainy flashbacks, intended to be powerful, are cliched (though Coburn as the father in old age is mostly excellent). Spacek is underused. Dafoe's narration is grating and unnecessary.

Paul Schrader and Nick Nolte have both had, at best,
inconsistent careers. Putting the two of them
together, one would assume that the resulting film had
an above-average chance of being godawful. And yet
somehow, what they ended up with was Affliction, a
movie that garnered Best Actor noms for Nolte from
everyone who matters and most who don't, and actually
garnered a Best Supporting academy award for James
Coburn. The Academy, of course, have never been the
world's best judges of taste, but they hit the mark
this time.

Wade Whitehouse (Nolte) is a part-time cop and city
worker in a small town in upstate New Hampshire. He's
burderned with a pain-in-the-ass ex-wife (Mary Beth
Hurt), a new girlfriend (Sissy Spacek), a boss who's a
bit too slick for his own good (Homes Osborne), and an
alcoholic father (Coburn) whose path he's dangerously
close to treading himself. When deer season begins
with a suspicious hunting accident, both Whitehouse
and his boss resent the State Police horning in
immediately, and Whitehouse starts investigating.

Ultimately, the movie is a character study of
Whitehouse and his relationship to his father, and the
mystery of the dead deer hunter takes, or should take,
second stage to this. And this is the film's only
major failing; Schrader and Russell Banks (adapting
his own short story) feel the need, after sublimating
the mystery in the film's climax, to tie up the loose
ends the script has spent two hours demanding be left
at the end. Losing the last two minutes of narration
would have done this film a world of good. But those
last two minutes aren't enough to undercut the first
hundred sixteen, which are excellent through and
through. I'm not normally a fan of Nick Nolte in any
way, shape, or form, but he's excellent in here, as is
Coburn. Sissy Spacek shows us why she never should
have fallen into obscurity after an all-too-short
stint on the A-list, and Willem Dafoe, who plays
Wade's brother Rolf, does his usual excellent job
despite having very little screen time. Aside from the
wealth of starpower, the cinematography is grand.
Well, as long as you like snow, snow, and more snow.
Nice to see someone using something other than
darkness to give a feeling of claustrophobia.

The climax, in this Oprah-infested age, is
predictable, especially to anyone who's even vaguely
familiar with Russell Banks. That, however, is as
irrelevant as who actually killed the deer hunter. ***

1228953,3,B00000IQVS,"""Affliction"", like ""The Sweet Hereafter"" (also adapted Banks) or ""Fargo"", seeks to both have & feed upon its Northern Gothic heart, something old/new/borrowed/blue. The movie is a fairly straight/monotonic adaptation of an interesting, if exceedingly harsh, Russell Banks novel. It's semi-bulletproof, safely within a current critical comfort zone. Call it snow + Snopes = horror? Those who dislike complication can conveniently duck (&/or complain about) a twisted closing voiceover, immerse themselves in cinema horror. Coburn/Nolte play Snopes father/son without hitches, glitches, or complications. Both performances are excellent, fine single-note acting. Nolte's constable/laborer character & a sensibly estranged ex-wife have a daughter old enough to do miner's canary duty. Her increasing fear of Daddy combines with the ambiguously accidental death of a weekend fatcat/developer/sportsfop hunter to accelerate impending doom. What Sissy Spacek, good at projecting shy but not nearly so good at projecting high specific density, is doing within conversing distance of the bomb seems mysterious, but small town choices ARE limited.
Zero suspense (gothics are inexorably predictable), but the closing deconstruction, by a son/brother who has escaped (detached from) the violence, become a Boston academic, is effectively dissonant, indirectly asks questions strictly implicit in slicker variations on the theme. Nolte plays a son who remains, steadfast, bearing/carrying affliction, becoming LIKE his proudly ignorant self-absorbed/reliant toughguy drunk father, but the tale is framed by a prodigal son/brother who MAY too blithely gloss over, in closing, his own known (& better understood than he claims, for his record?) contribution to the chain of events. Yes the rich DO get richer, not to mention more corrupt/arrogant/careless, but what are the costs/wages of trying to normalize, become LIKE the rich? Wherever one sets gothic scene, New Hampshire or Maine or Minnesota or Iowa or Mississippibama or Arkansas or Louisiana or Texas or Montana or Muskogee, Oklahoma, USA, interactions between effete/respectable/normal businesspeople (some criminal) & regular working stiffs (some criminal) can be dangerous. As ""Affliction"" events transpired, brother academic perhaps carelessly encouraged a complex speculative righteousness in brother constable/plowman/victim[izer] suffering from HORRIFIC toothache. He mentions personal complicity as he sums up the tale, intellectually. Expresses regret/sorrow (feels genuine debt to a brother who sometimes shielded him from the rage of the patriarch?), dismisses a shady landgrab by local yokel smart money as business as usual, strictly officially legal, but will NOT sell the family farm for ski resort development. Just stubborn? Think about this? Don't take everything every academic character voices over at you TOO straightly? Note well that the village itself has disappeared (been consumed) by the time of the telling (or re-telling/spinning) of the tale?
Derated for currently standard/trite refusal to risk/develop any character(s) with balancing grace/power/force.

Wade Whitehouse, sheriif of  Lawford, New Hampshire, is afflicted by more than mere toothache. An  upstanding pillar of the local community, the cop is having trouble with  his estranged daughter, ex-wife and the utter monotony of his job. With  nary a mugging in recent memory, Wade has content himself with serving as a  crossing guard at the local school and running errands for the town's  bigwig. It's enough to sap a law enforcer's self-esteem. Yet there are  other darker, worries at the sheriff's psyche.  Adapted from the 1989 novel  by Russell Banks (whose emontionally analogous The Sweet Hereafter was  successfully opened out by Atom Egoyan over two years ago), Affliction is a  complex character study posing as a conventional murder mystery. It's  strengths, beside it's appeal as a straight-forward narrative drama, are  many. And writer-director Schrader, whose obsession with innate human  violence has previously been explored in his films Blue Collar, Mishima and  Light Sleeper, has allowed collaborators to excel. Nolte has already won  glittering prizes from both the New York and National Society of Film  Critics for his variegated performance. Here is Wade as a seemingly amiable  bear of a man, quick to please and eager to fit in with the citizens he  serves. But, fuelled by the visible dis-comfort of his troublesome molars,  Wade's humour is stoked by deeper demons. The power of Nolte's delivery is  where he bestows his character with a dignity and gruff charm that draws us  to the man, in spite of his obvious faults and quick temper. Nolte is well  supported, too, by Spacek as his long-suffering girlfriend, Coburn has his  blunt, arrogant father and Dafoe as his level-headed brother. But,  ultimately it is Schrader's authoritive grip on the narrative that makes  this such a mastery, satisfactory work. Gently easing his story forward -  in which the suspectful shooting of a reputable visitor sets in motion a  murder investigation - the director drops in clues to the character that  colours the path to the film's dramatic conclusion. And even when nothing  much seems to be happening, Paul Sarossy's crisp lighting of snowbound's  New Hamspire beguiles the eye.",967852800,5,2386,5.224867724867725

Nick Nolte stars in this dark story of a the  lone policeman in a small New Hampshire town investigating a hunting  accident. He is divorced and trying and to get custody of his young  daughter who rejects his fumbling efforts to be nice to her.

Like  pregnant mother using heroin, in a way voilent fathers pass a drug to the  children they beat, one that like its chemical counterpart requires rehab.  Wade (Nick Nolte) the tragic center of Paul Shrader's film tries and fails  to fight his upringing or as it is referred to here Affliction. In one of  the film's most harrowing scenes when Wade finally beats up those who are  close to him, his father (James Coburn) looks at him and says ""There's  my boy."" Later Nolte hits him on the head with a log of wood and says  ""I love you"" and MEANS IT.  Nick Nolte's performance is perhaps  one of the decade's finest. He roams through the streets of this little  town, gradually losing control, nursing a vicious toothache, begging for  dignity and respect of the townfolk. He acts childish, paranoid, vicious  and angry all in one monumental performance. By the end of the film he is  almost literally possesed by the old man's spirit, with those face  contortions he starts to look like what he has become, his father.  If the  film has one flaw, it is the character of Rolf (Willem Defoe) who was the  protected brother that the father wouldn't touch. He seems a tad  hipocritical when in the voice-over narration he acuses his brother of  chasing fantasies about a murder plot, when at the time he suggested it, it  made sense to him and to us as an audience. Still this is a minor  contrivance to make a thematic point about Wade's decent.  Don't be put  off by this film's early slow pace, because its performances alone make it  a brutal, thought provacative journey into a diseased soul.",954806400,6,2504,4.548314606741573

7911455,5,B00000IQVS,"Affliction is a 1998 murder mystery and family drama from Lionsgate Studios, which examines several very disturbing and uncomfortable themes. Its story line centers around the sheriff of a small New Hampshire town, whose entire life is dysfunctional, as demonstrated by his multiple failed relationships, his mediocre job performance, and his inevitable alcohol and substance abuse. He becomes completely consumed by the investigation of a purportedly accidental hunting death, which he believes is actually a premeditated murder, rather than an unfortunate shooting mishap. The film tracks his inexorable deterioration, as he succumbs to PTSD from a miserable childhood in which he was terrorized by a verbally and physically abusive father, as well as succumbing to his hereditary alcohol and substance abuse. The scenes in which this downtrodden sheriff and his vicious and hateful alcoholic father appear together, are especially haunting and powerful. The performances by the lead actors, Nick Nolte and James Coburn, are absolutely spectacular, with Nick Nolte being honored by a 1998 Academy Award Nomination for Best Actor, and James Coburn actually winning the 1998 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The performances of supporting actors Willem Dafoe, Jim True-Frost, Mary Beth Hurt, Sissy Spacek, and Brigid Tierney, are also stellar. Affliction is an exceedingly gripping and powerful film, featuring superb plot and character development, as well as outstanding acting performances, and it merits a five-star rating, along with a strong recommendation.",1498089600,5,1571,5.717948717948718

7911457,5,B00000IQVS,"This movie is fascinating. For some viewers it many be terribly depressing, but i was riveted by it. Nick Nolte is an acquired taste I think, but his performance was one of the best portrayals of a lost and disturbed man I've ever seen. And James Coburn! I never thought of him as a good actor until this film at the end of his career, but he was wonderful. I only wished Willem Defoe had a bigger part but he was excellent too. I can't write anything as moving as the epilogue delivered by Defoe at the end of the film. Its touching and true and tragic. Just don't watch this film if you're having a bad day. Its not going to improve it. Great movie though.",1494115200,4,658,4.188976377952756
7911458,5,B00000IQVS,"Any movie that has Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Sissy Spacek, and James Coburn is automatically 4 stars. Sissy is always so perfect as the girl next door, which she kind of is - I live in Central Texas and she's from somewhere around Central Texas - and Nick Nolte gave a great performance, and James Coburn won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. This was good. I like movies with a lot of snow, it gets so hot where I live and watching an hour and a half movie filmed in the snow was so refreshing! The temp here has already reached 90 and it's just the beginning of May. Anyway, this movie may not be for everyones taste but I am a big fan of British mysteries with relatively little action but lots of conversation and character development that moves the plot along. This movie is like that. Not too much action, lots of conversation, and watching the characters tell the story.",1493856000,3,880,4.404907975460123

7911460,1,B00000IQVS,"The story line is interesting; we can imagine that the novel it was taken from was good, and had a message.  But the screenplay is poor; the direction, filming and editing are erratic; and Nick Nolte is awful, unbelievable throughout.  We wondered why Sissy Spacek would stoop so low as to be in this film (which Nolte produced); she is better than that.  If you feel that you must watch this, do yourself a favor and just skip through to the last five minutes; that way you will spare yourself the pain of watching the whole thing while still getting the message of the movie (which seems to be the main reason that other folks have rated it higher).",1493424000,,651,4.453781512605042

My story was closer to Pat Conroy's book made into a movie called ""The Great Santini"" .However there were strong parallels here as well. The description of this movie is erroneous. While the movie is worth watching and therapeutic it's Willem Dafoe's narration at the end that truly gives insight into the real plot here.
