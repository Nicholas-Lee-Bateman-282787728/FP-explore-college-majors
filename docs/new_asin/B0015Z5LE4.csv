8260550,4,B0015Z5LE4,"Continuation of DVD ""Tahitian Dance Part !"". Quality of DVD hasn't improved, but style of instruction still the same as in disk 1.
Slow tempo to show how to do dance movement, then repeated at regular speed. If you are not a self learner, this DVD and
Disk 1 will be of no value to you.",1434412800,,286,4.125
8260551,4,B0015Z5LE4,Nice photography - like the front and back views.  Clear instructions.  Good practice.  Not many steps or motions included.  Should have combined Vol. 1 & Vol 2.  Great for beginners.,1428192000,,183,4.966666666666667
8260552,3,B0015Z5LE4,"This is the second series of the Tahitian dance beginners by Kehau.
The main menu it -Tahitian dance for beginners play lesson.
* Kehau starts off by giving an overview of what is in the dvd, as well as encouragement to keep practicing. The dvd goes  over 4 new moves-The hip bump shimmy, hip sway,box pattern and traveling with the hip bump. After going through the four moves with some practice the dvd goes into a full practice session with the new movements. Then the dvd goes into practice with movements from dvd 1&2 combined-there is no cuing you just watch and follow and you Practice again for the final time. The dvd ends with a final written note about practice and you getting better over time. If you have worked with dvd one then the movements should not be too hard to get. Although this is definitely movement wise a step up from Disk 1.

*This time there is no demonstration of Kehau dancing. I actually think she should have added a performance that would have added more value to the dvd. She does not go over arm movements, traveling movements,exercises to help strengthen,music theory, movement meaning, history of any sort, and again there is no performance to put these movements into context. There is no warm-up or cool down. At the price she is charging that is a problem especially if you are a beginner looking for instruction. At her site the price is $19.99 plus shipping and handling. I got this dvd from amazon it totaled $16.99. You get about 19 usable minutes on the dvd. I understand that you get to use the dvd as much as possible and maybe that is why it is priced the way it is.

*I do not own many tahitian dvd's and so its hard for me to compare the value with those, but I do own many bellydance, samba and fitness dvd's at the price the company wants for the material it is not worth it. The production quality it not high, the content value is low and it is not comprehensive. If you can get the dvd for around $8.00 your good.

With all of that said, I do like certain parts of this dvd, because I don't feel like I am overloaded with movements and I get a killer 19minute workout. I enjoy the fact that the dvd is mostly practice time. She demonstrates for a bit but has you jumping right in and doing the movements. Again the production quality is not high but it gets the job done. The picture was clear, the sound was good. The camera held decent angles to see the teacher. She herself is a decent instructor, you can see her movements clearly, and she gives you pointers while dancing throughout the video.

I would say if you have the first dvd and want this as extra practice by all means get it. Like I said it a decent dvd with a decent practice session especially for people just beginning who may not be able to physically hold an hour practice session at a time. Again If you bellydance or do similar dance that involve hipwork you might catch on to this fast. As a bellydancer myself I have seen the majority of these movements and the execution was usually a variation of movements. I picked them up pretty fast although getting them to look as good as Kehau's is another matter. ;)If you have any of Kili's hula dvd's and can work with them then this dvd might be for you. This will definitely help you clean up some of the technique you learned from Kili. Still I think this one is overpriced.

I will not give this dvd a super low rating simply because all of the material on the disk is useful and I adore drilling, so the practice sessions were extremely helpful.",1335571200,2,3526,4.37557251908397
