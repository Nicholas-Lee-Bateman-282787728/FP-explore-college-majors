The DVDs play fine on my DVD player - the one-star review originally made me hesitate from purchasing.

3961654,5,B001PKZB8U,"This series was my introduction to the tragedy of Pompeii as a kid in the 80s and Roman history has fascinated me ever since.  After finally visiting the ancient site recently, I recalled the series and later searched for the dvd on a whim - and haven't been able to stop watching it ever since!  It definitely has an 80s prime-time soap opera style (remember Dynasty, Dallas, etc) and it doesn't have the gritty authenticity most present day historical dramas strive for (see HBO's Rome for that), but if you can get past that it is an epic production with thoughtful characters arcs and a moving musical score.

Ok, it is a bit absurd how all the characters seem to know each other whether they are nobles or slaves - definitely some unique intersections that are not all explained or likely, even if in a smallish city everyone probably knows everyone anyway.  But it seems an intentional way to show how all fates were intertwined, and the producers do a thorough job of showing you how each character ended up in the end.  The cast is diverse with legendary talent - but the story of Nydia and Lydon is definitely my favorite.  Even thou the gladiator with a heart of gold may be the most far fetched plotline of all time, it is very touching.  Duncan Regehr does an incredible job humanizing his character juxtaposed against his alter ego in the arena.

I can't fully explain why I am so captivated by this series, other than it makes a valiant attempt at bringing to life the mysteries of an ancient civilization, where you can't help but wondered who the people were, how they lived, loved, suffered and ultimately died in a cataclysm.",1481500800,,1643,4.602739726027397

3961673,5,B001PKZB8U,"Based on the epic novel by Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, this miniseries is equally epic, with an all star cast to match the spectacle written in 1834. Of course, there are changes to the source material, and normally, too many liberties taken with a novel or play or poem bug me to no end; but in this instance, the changes are all for the better. I won't say much more about it, other than first read the novel and then watch this magnificent television adaptation, where REAL extras and locations were used; none of the awful-looking computer generated imagery that is saturating films like Gladiator (with its fake looking computer generated imagery of the Coliseum and other locations in the film), etc. The score is impressive, and should be released on compact disc. The acting is very impressive, and the drama never lets up for a moment.

Not Rated.

This IS the complete miniseries, as it aired in 1984. The running time Amazon has listed for this DVD is incorrect.",1438041600,2,971,4.739644970414201

3961676,4,B001PKZB8U,"Searched for quite a while before locating this movie.  Still a great old mini series, cheesy but was good for its time ('80s). I attended the same high school with Duncan back in the late '60s, he certainly came a long ways from that tall skinny kid standing in doorways watching the girls go by between class changes.  Although the series is no match for the technology today, I would much rather see something like this in favour of all the computer generated movies today that to me are just overkill in the special effects department.  I give it a good solid 4 out of 5.",1430438400,2,575,4.40566037735849

3961690,4,B001PKZB8U,"A nicely done, if somewhat overblown, costume drama. More or less, a multifaceted soap opera built around an actual catastrophic event. 'The Last Days of Pompeii' came at the end of the miniseries craze that had been kicked off by the likes of 'Rich Man, Poor Man' and 'Roots' in the 70's. The TV networks quickly realized not only the profit potential, but also a clever way to win the 'sweeps' period, as well as pulling viewers away from the nasty old nemesis, cable TV.

Based on the 1834 book by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, there are a number of various interlocking stories. Too much to go into here, but the most touching is the on-again, off-again love affair between gladiator Lydon (Duncan Regehr) and the blind slave girl Lydia, aptly played by Linda Purl. The film winds it way through the lives of many characters, some more memorable than others. Stand-outs for me included Ned Beatty as Diomed, a self-centered merchant. Beatty has a natural talent for playing jerkish characters and he literally sails through this role. Nicholas Clay as Glaucus....he was impressive as Lancelot in John Boorman's 'Excalibur'. Here, he seems a bit more subdued. And I was totally blown away by the number of familiar faces I had seen on the 'Space:1999' TV series, including Tony Anholt, Gerry Sundquist, Brian Blessed, and Willoughby Goddard. And poor, poor Laurence Olivier. By this point, the grand legend of British cinema was in very poor health, so much so that you have to strain to hear him speak his lines. But his role, although small, was memorable. Veteran actor Ernest Borgnine, a favorite of mine since I was a kid, very nearly gets lost in the shuffle. His character, Marcus, in charge of the gladiators, should have been larger and longer.

Visually, this production is stunning at times, even though the story tends to drag. For both males and females, there's ample visual treats. Plenty of muscular, well oiled man candy for the ladies, headlined by the aforementioned Duncan Regehr. Even from a straight guy's point of view, the man is impressive. For the guys, Linda Purl (never did much for me, but some think she's hot), Olivia Hussey (yummy!) and the gorgeous Lesley Anne-Down (double yummy!) as a wayward prostitute. The costumes are striking, and more than just a bit revealing at times...for the men and women. The final 20 to 30 minutes of this lovelorn melodrama shows the cataclysmic eruption  of Pompeii, and it holds up nicely, even now. The effects, done 'old school' (no CGI) adequately portrayed the fire-and-brimstone destruction of the city. I won't tell you who lives and who dies, but be forewarned, many of the film's characters don't make it. ABC-TV put some serious money into this project, and it shows, even having on-location filming in Italy.

For me, this is one of those 'guilty pleasures', something you pop into the DVD player on a rainy day when there's nothing better to watch. But it fills that role very nicely. 'The Last Days of Pompeii' has been brought to life on the silver screen no less than 6 times, including the a 1935 version starring Preston Foster and Basil Rathbone. But this just may be the best version, even though it was done for TV. The 2014 movie 'Pompeii' was not based on the book and although technically superior, had a super-crappy ending....

All in all, a good show and well worth watching. For all the pomp and pageantry, it seems a shame that the only notable award for this miniseries went to Lesley Anne-Down (Golden Globe) for her portrayal of Chloe, the prostitute. Yes, she deserved it, but I would have thought a production this slick would have won more accolades.",1422576000,6,3646,4.817891373801917

It was apparently a television series about thirty years ago or so, and has all the obligatory pauses for station break.  Frankly, even with Sir Laurence Olivier present, it is not, I think, very well acted.  But the production values are tremendous.  No expense was spared on the costumes and sets, and much of the story is nicely ""synchronized' with the  locations and ruins  of Pompeii.  Unfortunately the meat of the story is based on Bulwer-Lytton's novel of almost two hundred years ago, and it is full of anachonistic sanctimony (I sincerely doubt that Christians were ""thrown to the lions' in Pompeii in 79 A.D., or indeed that they were very much of presence at all there at that time.

3961741,4,B001PKZB8U,"I just finished watching this 1984 version of the POMPEII movies.  Previously I watched and reviewed the latest POMPEII film which
I thought was awful.  This was better, though most of the movie was a soapy soap opera of plottings, more plottings, Christians being
munched by several MGM lions and evil Isis priest mischief.  Again, those nasty Romans, as if it was their fault that the volcano blew.
At the end of the film, a grungy looking Christian who was the Bird King from Flash Gordon movie, gave a speech blaming all evil
on the Romans and stating the Christians will bring down the Empire.  The Christians did eventually take over the empire, but they
did not get rid of slavery or gladiators; in fact the Chirstian emporers made Nero look sane.  Yes, the Romans had faults as did the
Greeks and other ancients, but they did build libraries and public baths and sewers (for ALL the people, not just the rich) created
modern law, imaginative architecture and a legal system passed down to us.  Being a Romanophile I take umbridge at the constant
bashing of Rome by the Hollyweird Left.  Still, this film was better than the new one; a more accurate portrayal of the volcano
sequences I think, and better actors.  I wish someone would have freed that poor dog that was tied to a stake.  The sets were
really first rate and the  special effects fine.  I just wish more time was spent on the volcano sequence and less on the silly romantic
interludes.  Still I give this film four stars and rate it a enjoyable.  But I would like to drop Dr. Sweets into the volcano with Daisy
and Martha.  yea!!  I got this from Amazon and though it is only in 4 by 3 display, the picture quality was very good.  enjoy!",1405036800,2,1708,4.514657980456026

3961749,1,B001PKZB8U,"With such a great story, full of drama, romance, history and tragedy...why is each re-telling of this story more laughable than the one before it?

I stumbled upon this one while I was looking for Pompeii docs.  I never saw it in the 80's.  Despite the presence of Sir Laurence Olivier, Anthony Quayle and Ernest Borgnine (all must have really needed the $$), this mini-series falls into the truly sophomoric, but misses being camp and falls into the ""just plain embarrassing"" category.

The script is banal and the acting is full of grimaces, eyebrow raising and nary a smile or laugh.  Pompeii was the playground of the rich, with an easy lifestyle and lots of revelry (according to the frescoes).  In THIS Pompeii, everyone seems to be angry or just plain barking mad.  Despite being about 160 years old at its destruction, the sets depict the city as brand spanking new - not a scuff anywhere to be seen.  In the big ""games"" scene, Ned Beatty appears to be wearing gold lame - really.  Everyone else is wearing bright, new clothes  - always. I could not tell who was meant to be a servant and who was a citizen. The make up is very strange as well.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, appears to have been treated to some type of spray tan type of foundation.  I guess the director figured they must have had tans since they lived near the coastline of Italy.

I could get past all of that if the story had been better.  There were SO many needless peripheral plotlines and since the acting was so stinky, it was hard to care what happened to any of the characters.  It was like all of the actors knew just three expressions: surprise, anger and frown-face.  What a disappointment!

Because of the eruption of Vesuvius, Pompeii is the most preserved city in antiquity.  We know how the people lived and because of the plaster casts from Pompeii and the skeletons of Herculaneum and Stabiai,we know how they died.  Admittedly, more information has come to light since the making of this miniseries, but jeez, we knew the basics in 1984.

The other reviewers left such glowing remarks, I ordered a copy of this Pompeii.  The only explanation for this is like the experience I had with Rich Man Poor Man.  I was very young and tv was very unsophisticated when that series first aired.  My friends and I just LOVED RMPM.  Last year, when the whole miniseries played on Encore, it wasn't as good as I had remembered it.  It wasn't as terrible as this crap, but it wasn't the blockbuster tv event I had remembered.

The real riddle of Pompeii is why can't this story be told properly in a motion picture?  Each retelling is even WORSE than the one before it.

As for this version, get ready to cringe, yawn and daydream about stuff you need to be doing around the house.  Stinkorama!",1400371200,6,2777,4.542338709677419

3961768,2,B001PKZB8U,"The set is beautiful.

The costumes are attractive.

The editing is terrible. It makes the fighting scenes look stiff and fake.  I see scenes that are clumsily cut and pasted together. For example, in the first fighting scene of the gladiators, the standing guy thrust his weapon downward toward the ground, supposedly into the body of the guy lying there. I can see his weapon was far away from the defeated guy, it did not touch him. Then, it shows the next scene where the winning guy raised his weapon and his other hand to the sky to celebrate his victory. Yuk! It is too much for action.

Yes, it has dramatic plot but the acting does not engage me.",1393545600,2,655,4.433333333333334

If you are a Roman scholar, however, or NOT a Christian, it does get tiresome to see, as in many such movies, most of the non-Christian characters presented as wicked, and all the Christian characters as wholly good.

3961775,5,B001PKZB8U,"I watched The Last Days of Pompeii (TV series 1984) yesterday & what a grand spectacle it is. I hope the wardrobe department got something for this one. They deserved it. The intertwining personal lives created for the show are wonderful except for a couple of incidents that are classic CODE creations. The champion gladiator's character is 180 degrees out. The eruption of Mount Vesuvius scene is perhaps the worst part of the movie & it is still very good but the part about a blind woman walking upstream against a mob desperate to escape an erupting volcano is too much to swallow, even though it is to rescue a baby from the arms of a dying woman. That's just too far-fetched too swallow, too much sugar & ridiculous. It is no coincidence that her love interest is the goody-goody gladiator.

Those three things aside though this a bona-fide Hollywood epic even though it comes off of TV & it deserves to be called such regardless of source. The cast is stellar portraying politics, competing religious ideas, the life of the privileged & the life of the down-trodden. Crime & selfless sacrifice as well as oppression & over weaning ambition all appear in a clear & understandable story form for over 4 hours in this TV series. Ned Beatty, Brian Blessed (what a great actor he is), Ernest Borgnine, Lesley-Anne Down, Olivia Hussey (Romeo & Juliet), Franco Nero, Linda Purl, Anthony Quayle, Lawrence Olivier & a host of great supporting roles by others make this a great viewing. Perhaps there are few surprises in the storyline once you've been introduced to the characters but it matters not at all. There are few even small false steps.

It may not always appeal to the masses who are mostly impressed by drama, and opulence, or need intricate stories to enjoy a fil; nonetheless a refined mind will understand well the beauty behind this non-extravagant produccion. The simplicity of it, yet the powerful meaning that it entails. This production is non-religious in nature even though it explores it.

What I hope anyone takes into consideration when they watch this movie, is that it was made in 1984 - those extras? Real people. The eruption- real material. Yes, the background was painted; and yes, you could tell but there was very little (if any) CGI used.

I cannot imagine the time, effort and expense it took just to clothe and make up the people in the public scenes. And I thought the eruption and the ensuing fallout was very well done.
