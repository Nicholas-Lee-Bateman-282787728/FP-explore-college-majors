I know I am biased because his movies give me a warm, fuzzy feeling, but I loved this movie. Might have something to do with his shirtless rendition of the manly, brute werewolf. Or his dark and brooding, misunderstood character.  Either way, it's pure camp and classic 70's horror that I highly recommend to any old school horror fan.",1381622400,,428,4.3375
2975758,2,B000WHU5CO,For many years I have been looking for a movie I once watched where a Spanish werewolf battled a female vampire but I didn't remember the title. This wasn't it but it isn't too bad if you are a fan of Spanish werewolf movies and have a few dozen brewskies.,1381449600,,256,4.14

The darkness is so black on the screen I'm afraid it's going to swallow my soul. The colors are still faded, the audio is decent I will give it that (has a very strange quasi-echo to it). Apart from that; shame on you Amazon...if you want a great transfer with good clarity and visuals and a Paul Naschy fan - pick up Frankenstein's Bloody Terror (I own it).

2975760,3,B000WHU5CO,"""The Werewolf vs. The Vampire Woman"" is one of those movies that had the potential to be really enjoyable, and for about half the movie it is. However this movie unfortunately suffers a ""halfway hex"" that other movies have also suffered. Here's why I feel this way...

Containing interesting and somewhat mysterious characters, amazing location, dark and enticing atmosphere and a solid plot, ""The Werewolf vs. The Vampire Woman"" has all the cues to be a great gothic-horror movie. Although it is indeed a low-budget movie, which is apparent in the first five minutes or so, it sets itself out to be one of those guilty-pleasure sort of B-movie gems.

Had this style been kept consistent throughout the whole film, I would have loved it twice as much. Unfortunately, it seems that after about 45 minutes in, things slowly start to become less consistent. The series of events becomes weaker in the second half than in the first half, the characters seem to act more unlike how they originally did, and the ending is one of those endings that leaves you feeling like ""What just happened?""

Before I end my review, I just want to remind all readers that I'm not saying this is a terrible movie. If you ever come across it, try to give it a view, because it is for the most part great, at least in its atmosphere and scenery, which to me, can make a movie better. And if you can, get it in time for Halloween! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1256256000,6,1438,4.565891472868217
2975761,3,B000WHU5CO,"This is another Spanish horror film starring Paul Naschy (Jacinto Molina), this time as Waldemar Daninsky, a reclusive author writing a history of gothic churches in northern France and part time werewolf. The film gets down to business in a plot similar to ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" when two women researching their thesis on ancient witches stumble upon Naschy's isolated home lost and afraid of impending nightfall. Naschy invites them to stay, and immediately the creepiness begins.

Naschy's crazy sister starts the harassment on the first night, but the coeds agree to hang around. Naschy and the girls find the ancient tomb of the vampire witch and foolishly remove the silver crucifix from her heart, which they fully understand will make her return to life. She certainly does, and when she arises she looks something like Gilda Radner in a nun's habit, only more ridiculous. Unsurprisingly, one of the coeds quickly and predictably becomes a sexy vampire, while Naschy and the remaining girl try to fight her off. Eventually the police arrive, but the policeman is largely ineffective, letting the werewolf and vampire witch fight it out with assistance from the remaining girl with a battle of evil and evil that ends well after an interesting struggle.

I don't care much for the title as it implies that the plot revolves around the battle between the monsters. As I see it, though, the plot is really about good and evil and the ability of love to overcome all (although in this case in a very surprising manner). Naschy is the best actor in the film, though the others are adequate. I thought the dubbing was substantially better than many of the other Spanish horror films from the 1970s, though the music was completely inappropriate and distracting. The werewolf effects and costume were especially wonderful: both creepy and fun at the same time, and I especially liked the introduction to the werewolf in the autopsy scene at the beginning of the film. Naschy really doesn't spend much time on camera as the werewolf, which is a bit disappointing as he is definitely the highlight of the film when in his fanged grandeur.

I liked this film more than most of the genre, and particularly liked the scenes with Naschy as a werewolf. A major detractor is the pacing of the film which is sometimes very plodding, especially after the policeman arrives an hour or so into the film: his conversations with townspeople are boring and prolonged and bring the plot to a halt leaving Naschy and company to resurrect it at the same time he is resurrecting the vampire witch. On balance this is a moody, brooding movie that is worth seeing for any fan of horror.",1220227200,5,2671,4.8402625820568925

8223494,3,B000WHU5CO,"My second Naschy werewolf viewing, after the superior Night of the Werewolf.  A very similar plot, actually (it turns out many consider Night of the Werewolf a remake). Two beautiful young women go into the French mountains to research local vampire legends.  They run across Waldemar Daninsky, the tragic werewolf.  One falls in love with him, while the other is bitten by a resurrected vampire.  Thick with gothic atmosphere, although not as lush as Night of the Werewolf.

The vampire died by a silver cross to the heart, something our man Paul can carry around with him, without any side effects.

Entertaining from a campy point of view.

This feature has been poorly transferred to DVD and on some copies, the few nude scenes have been cut. Night time shots appear to be done with natural lighting, and that is bad.",1389312000,,625,4.522123893805309
