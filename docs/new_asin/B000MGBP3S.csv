8168516,5,B000MGBP3S,"If you are a fan of Crusty Demons of Dirt and similar genre, these Travis Pastrana videos are the best and will not dissapoint.  Gruesome crashes, inane stunts by stupid kids (jumping off roof of a car driving across a bridge and diving into the river far below), mind-blowing motorcycle tricks, and general fun among really interesting delinquents at their high-budget party compound.  They never get old even after a dozen viewings.

I even show these videos to my Ivy League alumni friends who seem to also find them irresistable (although perhaps for different reasons....)",1294531200,,577,5.052631578947368
8168517,2,B000MGBP3S,"Just like the other two reviews, I bought this under the assumtion that it was what my husband fell in love with on the MTV series. Not so. I wish I would have read these reviews before I made the purchase. When I saw the MTV versions listed first on the amazon search list and then I saw the box set below, I thought I was just buying the whole set of the MTV series of Nitro circus. Please read before you buy!!!",1284595200,2,414,4.0
8168518,2,B000MGBP3S,"I purchased the boxed set for my son's 12th birthday. He had seen the MTV NC series, and I could see it was a fun mixture of the guys doing crazy stuff, travelling around etc.

I therefore purchased the boxed set on the assumption that NC1, NC2 and NC3 meant the MTV series 1, 2 and 3.

Not so!

As others have mentioned, the boxed set is really just dirt bike riding, which is OK, but it's not what attracted us to the purchase. It would have been much more helpful (and accurate..) to ensure there was a clear distinction in the description, between the MTV series, and what is shown on these DVD's in the boxed set.

I still don't know where to get the MTV series from!

So not bad, but not actually what we were after..",1253059200,14,723,4.172661870503597
8168519,5,B000MGBP3S,"I didn't realize that a lot of the footage from Mtv's Nitro Circus was older. There's a few clips that I recognized from the new show, but not many. And most of these dvd's are just music and dirt bike stunts and/or crashes. I thought it was a cool 4 disc set.",1241049600,,260,4.019230769230769
