2867034,1,B000RGULMO,"Let me start by saying that I am not a Dane Cook fan, but my girlfriend is. She is obsessed with his comedy routines and likes to quote them often. So for Christmas, I bought her this DVD. We sat and watched it and I have to say that for the first episode we were bored out of our minds. It's just stupid and goes nowhere. You know how sometimes people say that it would be funny if someone did a show about there lives. Well Seinfeld did it, and that was spectacular (we both love Seinfeld). But Dane's life is stupid and boring.
The second one had some redeeming value in that it did not focus on Dane's life, but followed more of a sitcom formula. Sam McMurray and Liz Vassey also help to make it fun. But it was still just a so-so episode. If this had been the pilot of the show, I might have watched another episode or two, but I don't think I'd really waste my time on a show like this. My girlfriend on the other hand, was throughly disappointed in both and stated that most of the jokes were geared toward people that already knew his routines (which is true as a few ""jokes"" flew past me as I didn't know the ""set up"").
If you like Dane, stick to his stand up routines. If you don't like Dane, this won't convert you, but rather re-affirm your hatred. Either way, don't buy it, and hopefully one day the man will up his game and do something funny.",1217203200,8,1357,4.143939393939394
2867035,2,B000RGULMO,"Now I love love love Dane Cook, but even I was glad these were ""lost"" pilots. A must have for loyal Dane followers, but I'm pretty sure you'll only watch them once.",1216166400,,164,4.15625
2867036,5,B000RGULMO,I bought this as a gift for my niece.  She hasn't stopped laughing since.,1214092800,,73,4.214285714285714
2867037,3,B000RGULMO,it was just good to see Dane in something else but i can see why his show never aired it was funny at times but not enough to keep me watching each week.,1209772800,,153,3.6666666666666665
2867038,5,B000RGULMO,"The seller of this product delived the CD Quickly.  Everything was in perfect condition.  Dane Cook should have burned this production, not worth watching, but the seller did a great job.",1209772800,,187,5.0
2867039,5,B000RGULMO,The lost pilot shows are AWESOME and totally hilarious. If you follow Dane Cook's comedy it's even more amusing because of the acting out of the scene with the fighting monkey! The outtakes are a blasty blast! It's an awesome buy!,1207612800,,230,4.634146341463414
2867040,3,B000RGULMO,"This DVD was Okay I thought it would be better. I love Dane Cook, but this is not his best work.",1197417600,,96,3.619047619047619
8200562,5,B000RGULMO,great,1484006400,,5,5.0
8200563,5,B000RGULMO,Item was as described.  Fast shipping.,1474070400,,38,5.333333333333333
8200564,5,B000RGULMO,I love Dane Cook!! So it's hard for me not to like anything with him in it. Lol... He is so funny!!,1419033600,,99,3.5454545454545454
8200565,4,B000RGULMO,"I had seen the 1st Cooked pilot years ago on Youtube or some such and liked it. This was the first time I saw the second Cooked pilot. This one was a little odd. What was up with the monkey? I think Dane Cook is hilarious and this will be a good thing to have for my DVD collection, but the 1st one is better than the 2nd. And I think funnier as well. The one saving grace for the second one is the inclusion of Liz Vassey. I really like her and have seen almost everything she's been in.
If you are not a Dane Cook fan I would say pass on this as this is more for his diehard fans than anyone else, but at under $4 I couldn't pass it up. I just hope they do this for his show Next Caller that NBC picked up, filmed 4 episodes of, and then cancelled before airing anything. I'm a big nerd when it comes to viewing unaired pilots/shows. I'm still trying to find a copy of the 1993 Doorways pilot to watch and I won't stop until I see it.
To sum up buy if you like Dane. Don't buy if you don't like him.",1378339200,,1001,3.8405797101449277
8200566,5,B000RGULMO,dane cook has alot of originality behind his comedy.this dvd is no different.alot of funny moments throughout the film.a great addition to any collection,1355011200,,153,5.416666666666667
8200567,3,B000RGULMO,There where only like 2 shows and that was it.  I was exspecting it to be longer and more.,1301097600,,90,3.736842105263158
8200568,1,B000RGULMO,"Sorry but after watching this mess, and also one of his movies, I think Dane Cook is simply not an actor.  Obviously, he has thousands of loyal fans who find him funny in concert (I don't think he is there either, but I'm overruled), but this guy's giant pulsating ego does not transfer well to the screen, whether large or small.

Too bad for the other actors -- who were all great (especially Justine Bateman!).",1279670400,,413,4.493333333333333
8200569,4,B000RGULMO,Something a little different from Dane. 2 episodes of his show. Wish there were more on this dvd. Still great though!,1265500800,,117,4.619047619047619
8200570,1,B000RGULMO,"This pilot dvd is a disgrace its just a way for Dane Cook to get more money. Dane has lost that really great comic edge since he seems more interested in getting into more movies and tv shows,even his looks have changed drastically whats up with this.there was a rumor that he had aids i had heard in the last couple of weeks which might account for his change and weight loss. I know alot of people have met him in person and they say he is very nasty so I guess all that likeablility on stage is an act. Buy Lisa lamponellis dvd,s instead,she is a real comic talent not this ham and egger dane Cook",1255737600,2,600,4.136752136752137
8200571,1,B000RGULMO,Im a fan of things that are so bad you almost have to laugh...these pilots are bad...just plain bad bad bad.  It is no wonder they didn't get picked up.  I'm a HUGE Dane Cook fan for the most part and do enjoy most all of his work...this is work that you'd be better served not seeing.  But I do suppose for hardcore Dane Cook fans you may as well get it...it's not going to break the bank or anything.,1253491200,,402,4.0
