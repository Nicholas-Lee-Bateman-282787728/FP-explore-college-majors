5168820,3,B008KZX806,"Shinjuro is called the ""defeated and detective"". No matter now good he has performed, there is someone that's a step ahead. He does have one thing going for him. There is a demon on his side. Inga, is his assistant. She has the power to make people tell the truth. Japan is rebuilding after a war on terrorism. There are strict and corrupt govt policies and officials crushing the freedom of the citizens. Politically motivated murders are a common occurrence. Shinjuro and Inga help to bring these murderers to justice.

This series has a whole lot going for it. The animation, voice actors and soundtrack are all great. The story in this anime is also pretty involved. If you miss 1 episode, it's easy to get lost. I just flat out didn't like it. The first 6 episodes are pretty much unrelated to the main plot. The 3 major reasons I don't like this series are: 1. The mysteries are easy to solve. 5 minutes into the episode, I already knew who the murderer was. I was ready to go on to the next episode while everyone in the show acted completely perplexed for 15 more minutes. 2. The story is very slow moving. Usually, murder mysteries have a bit of suspense and danger. Un-Go doesn't. There is no suspense or sense of danger. When the killers are confronted, they pretty much just admit that they did it, and give up instead of fighting back and trying to escape. 3. Un-Go also suffers greatly from a lack of good characters. There isn't a single interesting character in this series. There are only 5 reoccurring major characters, and none of them are interesting or have any depth.

Like I said, this anime was produced very well. It was obviously well thought out and carefully made. It's just one dimensional and boring as hell. I can't recommend it to anyone. I am amazed at all the 5 star reviews this show got. There is no way this show deserves 5 stars. The production deserves 5, but the story is 1 or 2. I fought sleep very hard to finish this series. If you are wanting to see a good mystery, I recommend Spiral. It may not have a very satisfying ending, but it's way more interesting than this show. If I were you, I would just ignore Un-Go. It has nothing to offer.",1357776000,5,2184,4.443890274314215
5168821,4,B008KZX806,"From well-known Japanese novelist Ango Sakaguchi comes an anime adaptation of his novel ""Meiji Kaika Ango Torimono-Cho"".  An 11-episode anime series produced by Studio Bones and Aired on Fuji TV's noitaminA from October through December 2011.  With a ""0 episode"" prequel shown in theaters.

The series is directed by Seiji Mizushima (""Fullmetal Alchemist"", ""Mobile Suite Gundam 00 Special Edition"", ""Slayers Next""), screenplay by Shou Aikawa (""Gad Guard"", ""Genocyber"", ""Shikabane Hime, ""Sorcerer Hunters""),  character design by pako and Yun Kouga (""Gestalt"", ""Genji"", ""Mobile Suit Gundam 00, art design by Takeshi Waki (""CANAAN"",""Geobreeders 2, ""Glass Fleet"") and music by NARASAKI (""Deadman Wodnerland"", ""Aikatsu!"", ""Aquarian Age the Movie"").

And now both the movie prequel and the eleven episode TV series will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sentai Filmworks.

VIDEO:

""Un-Go"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  Un-Go is a TV series that features a colorful, vibrant palette and well-detailed art backgrounds thanks to BONES and crew.  If anything, the series has its own style and presentation, as one can expect from a TV series, you are going to always get that hint of softness, but in terms of character design, there is a good amount of shading with the characters, from hair to clothes and good use of pinks, purples, reds and oranges throughout the series.

While the TV series looks very good, as one would expect from a film, ""Un-Go - Episode 0: Chapter of Inga"" looks fantastic in HD!

AUDIO:

""Un-Go"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  Although I would have preferred to have a more immersive 5.1 lossless soundtrack, ""Un-Go"" and its two soundtracks are crystal clear coming through the front channel and while the English has a more of a dynamic range than its Japanese counterpart, both are very close together in terms of its overall mix.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Un-Go: Complete Collection"" comes with the following special features:

  Episode 0: Chapter of Inga - The animated film is a prequel that gives answers to how Yuki met Inga and how he became stuck with her and more.
  Inga Nikki Shorts - (3:43) The omake shorts for ""Un-Go"".
  Chapter o the Inga Alternate Opening - (:31)
  Un-Go Up All Night Event - (28:09) A Q&A with the Japanese cast and crew of ""Un-Go"".
  Japanese Promotion Video ""Retake"" - (3:21) A Japanese promotional video
  A Conversation with Ango Sakaguchi - (22:13) Discussion and Q&A regarding the work of the late Ango Sakaguchi.
  Japanese Spots - (14:34) Japanese TV spots for ""Un-Go"".
  Clean Opening & Closing Animation

JUDGMENT CALL:

In Japan, there are quite a few animated series that feature a great detective.  But with the series ""Un-Go"", not only do you get a detective series but you have a detective's sidekick who eats the souls of those who cause harm to people.

A series that takes place in a future Tokyo that survived a major disaster, all is not well in the world as the ""Defeated Detective"" known as Yuuki Shinjurou and his mysterious sidekick Inga take on cases that even the police are having a hard time figuring out.

While the series features a different case that Yuuki and Inga work on, you feel that you are left in the dark on why Yuuki is with this mysterious girl who can change to a woman (who happens to eat people's souls).  And that is where I was surprised and quite happy that the prequel film ""Episode 0: Chapter of Inga"" was included with this Blu-ray release.  The film answers many questions of who Yuuki Shinjurou and what Inga is and why these two are together all the time.  In fact, I recommend watching the prequel before watching the TV series, so you won't be as confused.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Un-Go"" is an anime series that looks absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray.  Colors are vibrant, the artwork is well-detailed and Studio Bones did a magnificent job with the series overall!  While the lossless tracks, both in Japanese and English are well done, because the amount of action presented, it would have been nice to have a 5.1 lossless soundtrack.  But for the most part, dialogue is crystal clear as with the special effects which are front channel-driven.

Overall, Ango Sakaguchi's ""Un-Go"" takes a different, unique approach to the typical investigative anime series and includes a sci-fi edge with a twist.  ""Un-Go: Complete Collection"" is an entertaining anime detective series that looks incredible on Blu-ray!",1354320000,2,4513,4.973262032085562
5168822,5,B008KZX806,Good overall story and good animation. I liked the special episodes in the extras it explained how everything began in the first episode.,1353974400,,137,5.0
5168823,5,B008KZX806,"UN-GO is a detective show, something I haven't seen a whole lot of recently,The art and animation are pretty consistently good. This show does also use CGI for vehicles, but most of the time it's not noticeable.

The place where this show really shines is the story. One of the things that really glue to me is how connected this show is. little that is introduced is without purpose. Miss a couple episodes and you'll likely end up confused. Not only that, elements introduced ultimately become an important part of the conclusion. There's generally a sense that the series is going somewhere, and it doesn't disappoint. One of the things that appealed to me was it's cyberpunk tendencies. While a few of the show's core elements are supernatural, there's also a lot of really cool sci-fi concepts involved, and it all works together.

I highly recommend checking this one out",1347926400,9,877,4.84
5168824,4,B008KZX806,"Shinjr Yki is a detective living in a future Japan that suffers from the ravages of a war that ended some years before. He is known as the ""Defeated Detective"" due to the fact that credit for every case he solves ends up going to Rinroku Kaish. Despite that, Shinjuro and his very strange assistant, Inga, continue to solve crimes and expose the darkness of their world.

This series is based on the work of Ango Sakaguchi, stories that took place in post WWII era. I don't know why the setting was changed to a futuristic one, but it turned out quite well. At first I wasn't really sure if I liked the series - the first few episodes are stand lone stories with strong elements of the darkness in a human heart. But around episode 4 or 5, things start to get interesting. A sort of overall plot starts to form and you begin to wonder about the line between illusion and reality, truth and lies. The ending was fairly satisfying, though most of the big questions about Inga are left unanswered. There is a 45 minute movie released that tells the story of Shinjuro and Inga's first meeting. Sentai licensed it along with the series, but I don't know when it will be released.
All in all, I rather liked the series and I recommend giving it a shot.",1345593600,7,1246,4.393939393939394
5168825,5,B008KZX806,"I am an anime fan of many, many shows and this is one of my top 10. I also never write reviews, but I thought this called for one.
I won't go into the plot, the product description does a fine job of that, except maybe adding a lot more darkness and action then there really is in the first few episodes. I'm more concerned about the $50 price tag. This anime is ELEVEN episodes long in its entirety (eleven great episodes, mind you). I don't understand what about this one-disc DVD makes it $50 bucks. I would pay $20, and that's only because the anime is just that good.
The only reason I can think it's so pricey is because A) it has the dubs, which I've never seen before and B) it might also have the 45 minute prequel movie ""Episode 0""? Hopefully? If it does, then my buying price would go up to $35-40 if it had awesome bonus features.
This anime is awesome, but it is really short. Is $50 buck worth eleven episodes?",1343865600,12,924,4.196629213483146
5168826,5,B008KZX806,"Anime is good, I like it.  If you like detective and supernatural anime story, this is one to add to your collection.",1399161600,,117,4.318181818181818
5168827,5,B008KZX806,I enjoy watching mystery shows on regular TV. When I learn about this I had to watch. It the series was enjoyable to watch just the same as the mystery shows on TV.,1396915200,,164,4.0
5168828,5,B008KZX806,"Normally a detective/mystery genre anime is not a popular or interesting choice in the market recently. The last popular one, Case Closed, starred a 10 year old boy and had 500 odd episodes, but this one has only 11 episodes and is definitely worth the time to watch.

This show is about Shinjuurou Yuuki, a man who is labeled as the defeated detective because his rival, Rinroku Kaishou, frequently covers up the mysteries he solves to prevent important VIPs from being incarcerated because that would cause an uproar in the public's eyes, and thus prevent Japan's growth and recovery from a recent war.

The detective, Shinjuurou, is accompanied by an unusual child who has pale skin and dresses like a panda, who also provides a little comic relief in the show. The assistant, Inga, can transform into a mature, attractive woman who can force people to tell the truth by devouring their souls. Yes, this show has a supernatural element to it; after all it is anime. You may think that having an assistant who can essentially cheat and solve the crimes is uninteresting and a cheap tactic to end the case in a fashionable time. However, the crimes are so intricate and compelling that it does not detract from the show. In fact the last two cases are so involved, you may need to write down notes and names to try to solve it out on your own. I don't think that is actually necessary, but it could be fun since it is rare to find a legitimately good mystery in anime or any other medium period.

It is worth noting that there are only 11 episodes to this series, but the prequel movie is included in the collection. The movie is short at only 45 minutes long, so you could almost consider it two episodes, which then raises the count to 13 episodes, which is the length of an average anime season. It is highly advised to watch the movie first since it is the prequel, and it explains the main character's origins and how he met up with Inga.

Unlike almost any other anime series, this one actually has special features. It has a talk about the series' original author and premise, promotions for the series, the movie, an alternate opening for the movie, and the Un-go all night event. Overall, check this anime out if you like detective shows with a hint of the supernatural thrown in to keep it interesting.",1393113600,2,2313,4.566265060240964
5168829,3,B008KZX806,"Firstly let me thank Studio BONES for making another great looking, sounding, feeling show. Their attention to detail as always shine through. Now about the show. This show is a detective show focusing on Shinjuurou Yuuki and his assistant Inga and their cases to uncover the truth behind what has happened. The first episode is outstanding in how it introduces the characters, most of whom will be regular cast members throughout the show. This episode also is the pinnacle of the story telling throughout the entire show. Between the first episode and the last there are a lot of episodes that have promise but more often let you down when you figure out what happens long before the plot has moved to the point of the explanation of the current case. This is one of the reasons I rated this show a three because too often the plot is just easy to figure out in many of the episodes. The main reason I gave it a three is because of the handling of the explanation of who Shinjuurou Yuuki and Inga really are. Ideally, what is presented in the OVA would have been an even better first episode or two to the story since during the entire series it is never explained who the two main characters are. The other reason I rated it as such is because it never explains why Inga when not consuming souls is a boy but it is explained why Inga is a woman when consuming souls. The story itself had potential and shines at moments while a complete dud at other times. I only recommend this as a buy if you can stomach that most of the show is a dud but the times it does shine more than make up for the crap portions.",1388275200,2,1609,4.348837209302325

5168833,3,B008KZX806,"I'd never even heard of this, being out of collecting anime for years now I decided to just take a chance after viewing an episode uploaded to Youtube Funimation channel. Firstly there's the animation in HD, it's decent certain characters like Inga pop and are animated in movements and quirkiness... but the main character Yuuki is rather forgettable. Overall it's a pretty decent story and concept but almost no aspect of the theme as a crime sleuthing journey offer up much thought and come off completely predictable. The cast of characters is good but once again the story's plot twists don't really make much use of the cast so it's kind of a plod to get through it all. It's also very short, 11 episodes and a 00 chapter which finally shows the origins of Yuuki and Inga's relationship and crime solving mission.

I'd say if you're a fan of this anime on DVD you might obviously want to pick this up in HD, or... if you're just a fanatic of anime collecting and want to own everything lol, you might want to buy this. Otherwise you might want to avoid this altogether since there is not much humor, action or mystery enough to prove thought provoking. It does provide a backdrop of modern terrorism and government tyranny post 911 which I still don't know if I'm at odds with since I don't believe in the official 911 theory etc, but they don't go into it enough to prove as some type of propaganda one way or the other.",1360972800,3,1427,4.5096525096525095

8528755,5,B008KZX806,"I really appreciate Un-go for what it does: make a contemporary adaptation of a collection of detective stories published in the 50's by Ango Sakaguchi. It's very thought-provoking, even after you consider the fact that the anime's mysteries are usually plot devices used to make very relevant social commentary on a post-war or simply a post-huge disaster society. I'm genuinely surprised at how smart the series is, compared to 70% of today's anime which is just braindead fanservice bait. But I'm not saying Un-go is something completely unique, hell no, there are quite a few anime tropes in it, such as Inga, the obligatory character whose purpose is to be cute and funny. Yet thankfully Inga's role is more than just that and is actually one of the most interesting characters. I give it five stars since it's short and sweet, the opening and ending are godly and because it's very memorable.",1401321600,5,898,4.9144736842105265
