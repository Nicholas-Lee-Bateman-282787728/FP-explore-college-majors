4048295,5,B00316DDU4,Excellent detail of the discovery and reconstruction of ardipithicus ramidus.,1412294400,,77,6.8
4048296,5,B00316DDU4,"A+ DVD: documents the discovery of one of the earliest known hominid species: ardipithecus ramidus.
Very entertaining, educational, and spoken in laymen's terms for a general audience.
Interviews with scientists, the use of charts and graphs, archive footage from the 1990s & CGI provide additional expert analysis on the Ardi and its impact on our understanding of human evolution.",1380672000,3,382,5.491525423728813
4048297,5,B00316DDU4,"Great video that I will be using with my middle school students.  There are a couple of parts that I'm going to skip over as I don't feel comfortable showing it in the classroom setting however I still think it's worth showing and just skipping over those parts.  Overall, great DVD!",1366156800,,283,4.529411764705882
4048298,5,B00316DDU4,"What I especially enjoyed about this documentary is that besides presenting some good information on what the consensus is on some ancient hominids (especially Ardipithecus ramidus), there is also a good presentation on the immense effort the experts took to come to their conclusions. In other words, this documentary not only gives good facts, it presents how those facts were acquired.",1360713600,5,388,5.377049180327869
4048299,5,B00316DDU4,"As an evolution teacher, one really appreciates when someone takes the time to make a well thought out and presented video presentation about how scientists go about finding and uncovering secrets about the ancestral relatives of humans.  This video meticulously documents the discovery of ""Ardi"", a hominid fossil.  Students will learn how one determines where to dig for a hominid fossil and will gain appreciation for the enormous amount of work that goes into the extracting, preserving and reassembling the bones into a three dimensional form.  They then discuss how they go about determining whether a creature like this walked on two feet or four, as well as a slew of other fascinating things like gender, age, diet.  Tim White one of the lead investigators, keeps the audience interested throughout the video and really shows how the investigation into our evolutionary history is a truly international effort!  Discovery did a great job in putting together this well thought out and educational video!",1357171200,6,1011,5.216049382716049
4048300,5,B00316DDU4,"Awesome account not only of fossil discovery but how they were extracted and prepared.  Nice graphics and clear presentation.  The canine reduction was interesting to see as well as the idea the bipedalism may have been the true separation event between ""us"" and the other great apes.",1343606400,2,284,5.0212765957446805
4048301,5,B00316DDU4,"...keeps changing.  4.4 million year old skeleton, a million years older than Lucy, shows us just how far back mankind has been walking.  A wonderful peek into how science works - 17 years of work to find the clues in ""Ardi"" and to understand the world in which she lived in.  A new look at our evolution - how early did walking develop?  If Ardi was NEVER a knuckle walker who did SHE evolve from?  If she both climbed and walked, in a forest, around 4.4 million years ago how far back will we have to look to find our missing link?  The first ape to stand up and walk?  Another million?  Two million?
AMAZING!",1328572800,4,611,4.252173913043478
4048302,5,B00316DDU4,"Really love early human development doc's, and this one is superb. A must see if there ever was one. The odds of finding a skeleton from this period, this complete, was astronomical. How they do their analysis from this find beats any detective story you will ever read. Most enjoyable!",1321574400,6,286,4.74
4048303,5,B00316DDU4,"How could anyone doubt the wonders of Natural Selection after seeing this?  I bought it to show to my High School Biology classes.  They were fascinated.  Several asked is this REALLY true?  Seems to me that if we show them the science these students might just question the version they hear at church.  Wouldn't it be nice if the creationists were asked to supply really strong evidence?
I would recommend this to anyone who has an open mind and a curiosity about the origin of our species.",1273449600,28,492,4.609195402298851
8386614,5,B00316DDU4,"I love the presentation of this documentary but mostly, I love anything about Ardi. She is a fascinating creature. I got a copy for my library and one for myself.",1510790400,,162,4.433333333333334
8386615,5,B00316DDU4,Loved it.,1494979200,,9,4.0
8386616,3,B00316DDU4,"Interesting, but it could have been shortened by leaving out some of the scenes of anthropologists digging, which really weren't germane to the story.",1487030400,,150,5.291666666666667
8386617,5,B00316DDU4,Excellent DVD,1483401600,,13,6.0
8386618,5,B00316DDU4,"I have been following paleontology studies of early hominids since Mary Leakey's discovery of ""Zinjanthropus Man"" in Olduvai Gorge in the 1960's in Africa's Rift Valley. I have even attended lectures given by her son Ralph Leakey at El Camino College in California years ago. But this Ardipithecus discovery is quite revolutionary in that it shattered the widely held theory of the day that early man learned to walk on two legs on a grassy plain with a few trees here and there. To learn that early hominids became bipedal in areas with a lot of trees is amazing to me. Modern man's relentless drive to learn the truth regarding our early beginnings is fully illustrated in this film record. I was so impressed by the film that I bought copies for my son and daughter. I highly recommend this DVD.",1452643200,4,798,4.666666666666667
8386619,2,B00316DDU4,"The film itself must be superb, but in the Amazon site, in ""product details"", it is written that the DVD has subtitles in english, but there are no subtitles at all. Very bad!!",1450569600,,176,4.363636363636363
8386620,5,B00316DDU4,I really enjoyed this program when shown on TV and want to view it again in the future. Anthropology has always been a lifelong interest and new discoveries are always fascinating. My only disappointment  is these programs are rarely Bluray.,1436572800,3,241,5.025
8386621,4,B00316DDU4,not what I expected .However I am very satisfied,1417132800,,48,4.444444444444445
8386622,3,B00316DDU4,"Well done, but oddly outdated.",1416873600,,30,5.2
8386623,5,B00316DDU4,It was great.  How lucky it turned out that where the original dig was going to be was not allowed.  Ardi would probably never been found.,1412985600,,138,4.269230769230769
