8115114,5,B000EWHSJK,"Every Marx fan has a favorite movie of theirs; HORSE FEATHERS (1932) is mine.

Ably directed by Norman MacLeod, the screenplay is by S.J. Perelman and Will Johnstone, plus songwriters Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, who also contribute two of the brothers' best tunes. Groucho shines on both of these.

""Whatever It Is, I'm Against It"" is the famous number where newly appointed president Quincy Wagstaff is introduced to Huxley College, backed by a mortarboard and robe-clad faculty. It briefly segues into ""I Aways Get My Man.""

The film's musical highlight, ""Everyone Says I Love You"" is performed by all four brothers: a straight rendering from Zeppo, a harp solo, Chico's energetic vocal over piano with humorous lyrics, and a languid Groucho serenading with guitar for ""college widow"" Thelma Todd as she gently rows their small boat. His first verse suggests Miss Todd has ulterior motives in being with him. This sequence, which ends with a quacking duck, is my all-time favorite Marx moment.

Much of Prof. Wagstaff's anatomy class lecture is from ""Home Again,"" a vaudeville act written for them by Uncle Al Shean that was based on their ""Fun In Hi Skule"" skit. Another recycling of old material is Harpo's cleavering a deck of cards in half. This is from their first Broadway show, ""I'll Say She Is.""

Other famous sequences: the speakeasy ""swordfish"" password routine, a merry chase in Miss Todd's bedroom, and the comic football game. A photo taken during work on the latter appeared as a 1932 TIME magazine cover. Chico was at that time recovering from a severe knee injury; he's clearly hobbling in these scenes.

(After Duck Soup flopped, their contract with the studio was terminated.)

Highest possible recommendation for this classic comedy!",1281312000,2,2044,5.38871473354232
8115115,5,B000EWHSJK,"Horse Feathers stars the four Marx Brothers; and they carry this film like champs. Thelma Todd plays the college widow brilliantly; her sense of timing during the comedy scenes equals that of the four Marx Brothers. The plot moves along at a good pace and there are plenty of laughs.

The action begins with Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff (Groucho Marx) becoming president of Huxley College. Wagstaff disapproves of his son running around with the college widow Mrs. Bailey (Thelma Todd); and unbeknownst to anyone Mrs. Bailey is in cahoots with her real boyfriend Mr. Jennings (David Landau) and Darwin University. Jennings wants to get the football signals from Huxley University so that once again Huxley will lose a college football game; that way Jennings's bet that Darwin will win the football game will pay off handsomely.

Of course, from there on in it's anybody's guess what happens next. Watch for fine performances by Harpo Marx as Pinky and Chico Marx as Baravelli. When Pinky and Baravelli are taken hostage by two brutes from Darwin team to make sure the game is fixed, what might happen?

One thing, though, about this film: you get several song and dance numbers that push the limits; poor Wagstaff (Groucho) has to sing a song as the movie opens. It's a very funny song; but Groucho Marx couldn't truly sing. Baravelli has a short musical number with the widow Bailey at the piano and Pinky (Harpo) finds a harp sitting rather conveniently just outside the widow Bailey's window so he can serenade her. In addition, Zeppo Marx plays Wagstaff's son, even though in real life Zeppo Marx was only 11 years younger than his brother Groucho. Nevertheless, this is a very funny movie so I'll overlook it all and give the movie five stars anyway. I laughed a lot!

Overall, this movie is a must have for Marx Brothers fans; and people who enjoy screwball comedies from the 1930s will want this for their collections.",1265500800,3,1929,4.836363636363636
