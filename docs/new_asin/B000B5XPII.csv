2400407,4,B000B5XPII,"i exercise regularily, and found this dvd to be quite a challenge! what i really liked is how much was packed into a short time span. it's a tough workout though, so be prepared!",1150588800,9,178,4.264705882352941
2400408,5,B000B5XPII,"I have never actually seen the Biggest Loser show, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE Jillian Michaels' workout DVD's. I am in moderately good shape, and they are still quite challenging. Each 20-25 minute workout has a 3-5 minute warm-up, two cycles of exercises of which you do two sets, and a 2-3 minute cool-down. This means that you are constantly switching between different muscle groups, helping to burn fat by keeping an elevated heartrate. The cardio-kick boxing DVD is also great! These workouts have definitely served to get me into better shape, both cardio- and strength-wise, although I wish they had a little more ab work. I like Jillian's personality-- particularly the fact that she is not all bubble-gummy like many workout video instructors-- and the way she keeps you motivated througout the program. I highly recommend getting all five DVD's-- the four strength workouts and the cardio kick-boxing DVD.",1143676800,26,910,5.073333333333333
2400409,4,B000B5XPII,If you've just began working out I highly recommend. This is only for people who can handle being out of breath,1141689600,6,111,4.333333333333333
2400410,5,B000B5XPII,"A short workout that packs a punch and will whip you up in shape!

If you like endurance weight training with short cardio bursts then you will enjoy these workouts! I have all 4 of Jillian's endurance strength training DVDS and they are very good especially when combined with 30-45 mins. cardio. The Maximize Full Frontal DVD is a little more intense than Jillian's Shape Up Front DVD; it has more core work, more one-leg moves and the cardio segments always use dumbbells. The Maximize Back In Action DVD is also a little more intense than Jillian's Shape Up Backside DVD; it has more core work, harder exercises and additional power moves. All 4 DVDs are an excellent buy and since they are all short workouts, you can easily combine them with cardio for a well-rounded 60 minute workout. Note: You will not like Jillian's workouts if you prefer to go heavy with weights.",1135296000,44,875,4.681818181818182
2400411,5,B000B5XPII,"As a personal trainer, I recommend all her Maximize Series videos if you are already in good shape...though she does have some geared towards beginners, I have not tried them out. Jillian Rocks!",1231286400,,194,4.909090909090909
2400412,5,B000B5XPII,"get the set...although Gillian, I must admit, sometimes irritates me with what appear to be fake emotions (shoving a castmate on one of the dvds and acting fake ""tough"" and giggling for no reason) she still is a fabulout trainer and motivator and instructor of how to do the moves correctly and always comes through with great cardio and strength training to round out your program. I enjoy every dvd she has.",1228003200,3,409,4.694444444444445
2400413,5,B000B5XPII,"If you want a hard core work out, then this one is for you. My legs were killing me for days after the first time I used this, but the next time I used it felt great! It very face paced, but you catch on quickly. I love all of Jullian's work outs.",1221264000,2,247,3.6792452830188678
2400414,5,B000B5XPII,"This was an intense workout.  I wouldn't reccommend it for beginners mainly because Jillian doesn't go into much detail on form which is very important.  You will need a step and some hand weights.  I have Jillian's kickboxing workout and her 30 Day Shred which are good, but I really enjoyed this workout. I consider myself an intermediate exerciser, but lately I don't feel most workouts the next day.  Well I'm feeling this one.  I saw some reviewers complain that this workout is too short.  They must be more advanced than me because I found the length perfect.  I don't think I could take much more of that intense workout.",1219968000,,629,4.663636363636364
2400415,1,B000B5XPII,"jillian is rude and annoying to both the viewers and her class. she makes me want to turn the DVD off, not work harder. i also think she is careless about safety and proper form.

both videos are really short. it makes no sense that they are on 2 different DVDs. also, the box won't tell you that you need a long step, weights, and a matt too.",1205020800,6,343,4.044117647058823
2400416,3,B000B5XPII,You'll notice that nowhere on the packaging do they tell you it's a 25 min. workout.  Even here they don't state the DVD length!  As most DVD's are 55-75 mins. long this DVD should sell for $7.50.,1198195200,4,196,4.27027027027027
2400417,3,B000B5XPII,"this is a really good workout, but it is short and I wished there had been at least one additional workout included on the DVD for the $$.  Also the extras that were on the DVD weren't really useful to me.",1173398400,7,205,4.0
2400418,4,B000B5XPII,"This workout packs a lot of punch into 30 minutes. It is a tough workout. Jillian is a good instructor and knows her stuff, but her 'tuff but sexy' thing she's got going on gets a little annoying in places. If I was one of the people in the DVD getting harrassed by her I might sneak out of there for fear she's beat me up for leaving.",1171324800,2,335,3.9411764705882355
2400419,5,B000B5XPII,I ordered all of Jillian's videos after this intial purchase!  This is one of the few workouts I have ordered that really is as great as it sounded!,1168646400,4,148,4.285714285714286
2400420,5,B000B5XPII,"I really enjoyed doing this workout.  I felt every single muscle in my body the next day and like they say no pain no gain.  I just wish that I could meet and Jillian and be on her show with her.  I am really struggling with my weight at this time in my life.  I am 40 years old and seem to be putting it on instead of taking it off.  Please Help me out Jillian.  Sincerely, Kimberly M. Rosato",1168300800,3,393,3.85
8081686,5,B000B5XPII,Love the workouts,1476230400,,17,5.0
8081687,2,B000B5XPII,"Not the jillian I am used to, and i didn't know i would need a step (as in step aerobics) to complete this video at home. So if you don't have something you can step up on, you'll need to get one before doing this video. Plus this video is from2005 and is kinda not like the more current videos from Jillian. It's poorly created and I won't be ordering from this collection again.",1460246400,,380,4.148648648648648
8081688,4,B000B5XPII,great workout,1457654400,,13,6.0
8081689,5,B000B5XPII,Another good product,1455321600,,20,6.0
8081690,5,B000B5XPII,This like all of Jillian's workouts will get you sweating and wanting more. The warm up itself is a workout. Jillian does it again. Had to have it in my collection.,1370217600,,164,4.32258064516129
8081691,5,B000B5XPII,"Great workout.  Short, but definately not sweet.  It gets you sweating and is really intense.  It hits all major muscle groups and Jillian is really motivating.",1365552000,2,160,5.076923076923077
8081692,5,B000B5XPII,This DVD is really good. As I was working out I didn't know that the workout was less than 30 min so it came as a surprise when the streching and cool down came along. I love it. I worked out muscles I never knew I had and it is a short short work out which I loved the most!,1316476800,,275,3.6
8081693,5,B000B5XPII,This video makes you work and makes you sweat! Jillian knows which muscle groups to work for best weight loss and this video goes all out. Excellent video for working out at home,1293926400,2,178,4.424242424242424
8081694,5,B000B5XPII,Excellent DVD! Just did it and I'm dying.. which is great haha cuz thats what it should do! :),1279324800,,94,4.0
8081695,5,B000B5XPII,This is only about 20 mins long BUT it kicks my butt and makes me sweat a ton!  GREAT workout as always Jill!,1239840000,2,109,3.739130434782609
