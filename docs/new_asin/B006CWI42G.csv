4983845,5,B006CWI42G,"This movie based on another Mitchell Albom book and is vastly superior to the shallow, Tuesday's with Morrie. This movie tells the tale of teo men of faith and Mitch's interaction with each. He learns from his childhood rabbi,  ""Reb"" (Martin Landau) and Pastor Covington (Laurence Fishburne), a Christian street pastor that faith requires hope, understanding, forgiveness and brotherly love. This movie is unlike anything Albom has written because he focuses on faith and not just sentimentality. The two clergy men come from different worlds, one traditional and straight and the other from the streets but both serve God and minister to the world they live in, This is a winner of a film.",1451174400,,690,5.052631578947368

4983879,5,B006CWI42G,"This is a great flick. We have watched it a number of times this year and last since we found out about it. I will say the pressing isn't great, and won't play well on some of my players. On one, the sound cuts out and yields sharp pops. That is an aspect of how that player (Sony) deals with audio gaps, but the gaps are there. We have tried 3 different copies, and all of them had defects. Other player will just glitch the video and audio but not try and pop you out of the room.

So, movie is great. the manufacturing quality is not so great. Buy through Amazon so you can send it back if you have an issue.",1361232000,,611,3.967479674796748

4983883,5,B006CWI42G,"Have a Little Faith captures the essence of the book by Mitch Albom. It juxtaposes the lives of two men who superficially have nothing in common: an aged, revered Rabbi Albert Lewis and a former ex-con turned Pentecostal minister, Reverend Henry Covington. Laurence Fishburne, Bradley Whitford, and Martin Landau shine in their roles as the rabbi, the seeker, and the reverend. The film is honest and warm without being wanly sentimental. The cast and the director let the story share its message of love amidst despair and hope in the midst of loss without contrivances or false steps. This film warmed my soul.",1358208000,4,612,4.951456310679611
4983884,5,B006CWI42G,"I first saw this movie over a year ago. It made such an impact, I kept thinking about throughout the year. I think the source of it's power is the true story behind the screen play. Some viewers may think it comes across as being too sweet to be believable. Whether the sentimentality is realistic or not, I found it very sobering and soul-full. An excellent holiday choice to put things in proper perspective.",1356825600,,410,4.554054054054054
4983885,5,B006CWI42G,A great movie based on a fantastic book.  The movie covers many of the themes or storylines found in the book.  However the book does go into greater detail.,1356393600,,157,4.379310344827586

Touching, tear jerker.",1348704000,,117,4.85
4983888,5,B006CWI42G,I saw this movie last year in 2011 on regular television.  I will admit I am the first to cry in sad movies and indeed i did cry in this one.  I now will read the book and confirm my actions by thinking I will get into it and it will be hard to be put down.  This movie is good to watch anytime you are down and always remember to count your blessings.,1343952000,,352,3.72972972972973
4983889,4,B006CWI42G,"The movie's title is about faith, but it is more of a story about how we touch each others life and how we are interconnected. Mitch (Bradley Whitford) is a scab sports writer for the Detroit Free Press. While at home in New Jersey, Mitch is asked by his 82 year old rabbi (Martin Landau) to write his eulogy. This forces Mitch to spend time with the rabbi who touches his life.

Mitch is then inspired (or perhaps feel guilty) to do the cliche pretentious thing and sleeps in a crowded homeless shelter to know what it is like to feel poor and homeless. Mitch thinks he can do more than just write about sports. He meets Henry Covington, a preacher in a poor church trying desperately to save a dying community. Henry (Laurence Fishburne) has a past of crime and drug dealing but following an epiphany has come to God.

The film has many inspirational lines and events. In fact it had too many, as it became bogged down with goodness. Fishburne gives us a great performance as does Landau. Bradley Whitford as Mitch left me cold. Mitch has zero personality. He was a Jew with no sense of humor. He lacked decent character development although he was in nearly every scene. This is one of the problems with Hallmark productions: When in doubt go lame and drippy.

I saw the film more about determination and desire to help others as the ""faith"" aspect was light, almost to the point of being politically correct.",1343606400,6,1412,4.529411764705882
4983890,5,B006CWI42G,I loved it and will recommend to everyone I know.  I think everyone can identify itself with this movie.  Is a movie to see with the whole family.,1341792000,,146,4.178571428571429
4983891,1,B006CWI42G,"Half-way through the DVD a scene fades out, and returns to viewing.  It was some-what disappointing, because my book club (10) ladies saw the flaw as well.",1338422400,,155,4.7407407407407405

4983894,5,B006CWI42G,"This movie was awesome, Mitch has done it again.  The book was even better.  I love Mitch books, and read them all.  Have a Little Faith was great and it just touched my heart.

4983897,5,B006CWI42G,"A must see for all who understand - ""We are no better than what we do."" I was a compelling story about the greatest gift we can give each other - an act of kindness.",1325116800,3,165,3.742857142857143
4983898,5,B006CWI42G,"I originally saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel and fell in love with the story.  I was originally drawn to the story because it is about a Jewish sports writer, named Mitch, who re-connects with his faith when his childhood ""Reb"" (Rabbi) asks him to write his eulogy.  I found that this story is not as much about Mitch's Jewishness, but about how anyone can reconnect to their faith in God and life.

While learning who the Rabbi is as a man, Mitch also meets a former drug addict, drug pusher and ex-con who had turned his own life around and became a pastor at a very poor church.

Mitch learns that one man can make quite a difference in the world just by having a little faith.

I loved the movie so much on TV that I put it on my Wish List and my dear hubby bought the movie for me for Chanukah.  I'm glad I got it on DVD because it has lots of neat extras including: ""Making of"" featurette, a Behind-the-scenes interview, Biographies and Credits and production story.",1324684800,9,979,4.3224043715847

4983901,5,B006CWI42G,"Mitch Albom is a tearjerker. After he made me cried with Tuesday's with Morris, he touches me even more with this movie. Aside from faith and an easy forgiving heart, another important lesson that I learned is ""when u keep on looking at the person's bad past, you are not looking on God's miracle that made that person changed"". If the movieworld will keep on showing movies like this, I guess we'll have a better place to live in. There will be more love, more faith, more helping hands and more forgiveness in everybody's heart. This is a must see movie, whether you are a Christ Believer or not, or a backslider or whether you have a good or bad past in life..you'll never be the same again after watching this.",1322956800,22,714,4.458015267175573
