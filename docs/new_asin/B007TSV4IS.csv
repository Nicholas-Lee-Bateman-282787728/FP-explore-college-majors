great actors,
interesting to the very end. It surely holds your interest. This is a movie I have always loved and had it on vhs. But considering the VCR's are getting some what out dated. I  had to have this on dvd. I can watch this movie  anytime  I have a lot of movies I like to watch over and over. This has been in my collection since 1995.

5109850,4,B007TSV4IS,"Weren't the `70s a great time to be alive? What other decade could've given us THE KENT CHRONICLES, a trio of TV mini-series produced by Universal and syndicated to local channels shortly after America's Bicentennial celebration.

Based on John Jakes' bestsellers (the same author of ""North & South,"" whose books would be more memorably brought to TV several years later), each mini-series (roughly three hours in length) follows the journey of Frenchman Philippe Carboneau - aka Philip Kent - and his descendants, from the original Kent's (Andrew Stevens) trip to the New World and run-ins with Paul Revere (William Shatner!), George Washington (Peter Graves!) and Ben Franklin (Tom Bosley!) among others - and by others, I mean a who's who of famous and bit-part actors from Patricia Neal to a young Kim Cattrall, Buddy Ebsen, Harry Morgan, Donald Pleasance and Olivia Hussey. The story was continued in ""The Rebels"" - with Kent engaging in the American Revolution - and the less entertaining, western-set ""The Seekers,"" though a fetching, young Delta Burke, at least, makes an appearance in this final installment of the ""Kent Family Chronicles.""

Long out of print on home video, Acorn brings all three mini-series to DVD in the form of a three-disc box-set. Fans who've wanted to see these hard-to-find productions ought to be sufficiently entertained by the hokey backlot production values and actors playing themselves more than the historical figures they're supposed to embody - but, in this instance, that's also part of the charm. The 4:3 transfers and mono soundtracks are all adequate across the board.",1342051200,37,1615,5.183908045977011
5109851,5,B007TSV4IS,"US history drama. A who's who of 1970s-1980s TV. The first NYTimes triple best-sellers adapted (but not closely) to television and now it's debatable which is best, books or miniseries? John Jakes authored the novels. A stellar cast in each of the 3 adaptations, so huge it's impossible to list all. It is `70s TV filming with SUBTITLES added. The music is good, sets and locations quite believable. It's a walk through America beginning in 1771 up to and past 1814. A lot of history, pioneer life, war, political change, and more in America's beginning steps leading to world prominence. The story is all seen through the eyes and lives of the fictional Kent family.

Over 3 hours for each episode. Action, adventure, history, romance, violence, & sexual situations make it for mature youth and older. So nostalgic to see all the stars, for those who lived in the 1970s.

The BASTARDS: 1771-1772
Philip Kent started as the illegitimate son of a Duke. Troubles led him to the new world to seek his means. Andrew Stevens is a believable Philip in ""Bastards"" & ""Rebels."" Through the encouragement of Ben Franklin (Tom Bosley), Kent seeks a printer's job and ultimately gets involved in early Boston activity (yes, tea involved) and men that forge a revolution toward liberty. The series was considered low-budget, but how could it be with the star-power.
Kim Cattrall (Philip's wife), Buddy Ebsen, Lorne Greene, Harry Morgan, Patricia Neal, Donald Pleasence, William Shatner (P. Revere), Noah Beery Jr., for starters.

The REBELS: 1775-1781
Philip plays a large role in the Revolution, working closely with Gen. Washington (Peter Graves), John Adams (William Daniels), Tom Jefferson (Kevin Tighe), John Hancock (Jim Backus) and soldier friend Judson (Don Johnson) is back from `Bastards.' Also returning was Cattrall, Bosley, & Neal. You see some war skirmishes but most of the action is away from guns, and the womenfolk are involved too.
You visit Virginia, Boston, Ticonderoga, Philly, Cambridge, Valley Forge and parts betwixt. You'll run into stars: Doug McClure, Robt Vaughn, Wm Conrad (Narrator), Tanya & Forrest Tucker, plus.
It's different from the book, so sit back and enjoy a TV action adventure Revolution.

The SEEKERS: 1794-1814 and more.
In 3 hours viewers see 4 Kent generations. Abe Kent (Randolph Mantooth) is primary, son of Philip (now by Martin Milner). He rejects a Boston printer secure life for the West (Ohio) with sibling Elizabeth (young slim Delta Burke). The west is hard, emotional, and heartbreaking, for the Kents and the viewers.
Serious drama of the Wild West filled with TV western stars. Like Edie Adams as a cat-house madam, river boatmen John Carradine and Neville Brand, Robert Reed and Julie Gregg running a trading post, trapper Brian Keith, print editor Ross Martin, Ed Harris plays Clark with Skip Riley as Lewis. Roosevelt Grier takes a whip, Geo Hamilton is nasty, and Harriet Karr beautifully nasty. Many names left out, not to mention author John Jakes (also North and South author) playing a role himself.

Although fiction, it represents the reality of pioneer America. Although adaptations, it dramatizes the essence of the novels. Although 1979, it is timeless from an enjoyable educational historical viewpoint. If you like Americana historical drama TV, also try ""The Adams Chronicles."" You can't get too many chronicles.",1340064000,19,3373,5.136612021857924

At the end the last part, could you say empty on their own in the world as from childhood family ties to a mad mind of different personalities.

5109929,3,B007TSV4IS,"American author John Jakes is sometimes referred to as the godfather of the historical novel. During his prolific career he took time away from historical subjects to write a series of novellas for The Man From UNCLE magazine, which provided his first tenuous link to television. However, it is for period novels and the subsequent small screen adaptations of his work  namely the North & South series as well as the series under review  that he is best known.

Around 1976, during the American bicentennial, Jakes wrote a series of eight novels collectively entitled The Kent Family Chronicles. The first three novels in this series, The Bastard, The Rebels, and The Seekers were adapted for television at the height of the mini-series craze in the 1970s and 80s. These adaptations are a curious addition to the Acorn Media library.

The typical American mini-series produced at this time tended towards panoramic, epic, multi-generational stories that afforded opportunities for casting multiple stars for maximum viewer satisfaction. At best, in a series like Centennial (another frontier saga made around the same time and based on the James Michener blockbuster), or either of the Herman Wouk-penned WWII-era volumes The Winds of War and War & Remembrance, the mini-series reached the heights of artistic achievement within this popular limited format. Attracting such luminaries as Robert Mitchum (in the two Wouk works), the television mini-series is generally fun to watch just to see how many stars have been assembled under one roof.

This is both a blessing and a curse, as popularity with viewers doesnt always translate into a believable performance, particularly in a period piece. This stunt casting (or is that mis-casting) works against the overall effectiveness of THE KENT CHRONICLES. While this point might be belaboured, one has only to cite the example of Tom Bosley as Benjamin Franklin and the point is easily made. Bosley was a good actor with numerous stage credits in a variety of roles, but he will always be remembered as Mr. C on Happy Days, thus rendering his believability in a period piece, let alone as one of historys most recognizable figures, ludicrous. And then theres Don Johnson but Ive already said ludicrous, so enough about the casting.

A good mini-series stands or falls on the strength of its story and Jakes truly knows how to tell a tale. The Bastard, the first three hours of this nine hour trilogy, sets things up with the very clever metaphor of the main characters dilemma (he is a bastard, meaning an illegitimate son) and the idea that America at the time of its quest for independence was a sort of bastard child of Great Britain. As Philippe Charbonneau (Andrew Stevens)  later known as Philip Kent  seeks to understand his circumstances and purpose in life, so the burgeoning country that became the United States of America experiences its own birth pangs and subsequent self-identification.

Peppered with performances from a high-profile cast that range from brilliant to atrocious, the viewer has fun spotting the star while watching each chapter of the story unfold. It just takes a little extra effort to not lose sight of the reason the big-name actor is supposed to be there  to further the plot.

The real surprise here is that while there is considerable merit on display  it is a very entertaining story after all  it suffers by comparison to almost anything else in the mini-series market that Acorn Media has distributed. After all, Acorn specializes in British programming, and while the production standards in British programs may suffer by comparison due to budget limitations, in almost every case the standard of acting is so far superior to US-produced fare as to be pointless to even compare the two. Taken for what it is though, an epic story of Americas becoming a nation, THE KENT CHRONICLES is entertaining  albeit light  television mini-series fare.",1397433600,,3932,5.065015479876161

5109932,5,B007TSV4IS,"I read all the books back In the 70's and loved them, and wish there had been more to this mini-series than just the first 3 books of a 8-9 book series.  Great overview of revolutionary war.  Loved seeing actors who are now old or gone playing roles.  I Recommend it.",1388448000,3,267,4.196078431372549

5109938,5,B007TSV4IS,I have loved these movies for years and am so glad they finally came out on DVD.  It was a pretty good A/V transfer considering the age and original quality of the A/V to begin with.,1366588800,,182,4.055555555555555

Enjoyed it very much.  Too bad they did not conclude it with the rest of the story.",1365984000,,162,4.193548387096774
5109940,3,B007TSV4IS,Nice histroical novel. Books far exceed the mini series. Very boring production. Great stars in the series but some poor acting.,1364860800,,128,5.142857142857143

5109942,3,B007TSV4IS,The Bastard was excellent but the Chronicles started to go down hill with the Rebela and totally died with the Seekers. The Seekers had a really terrible ending. This makes this whole part of the series not worth a second look.,1360886400,,227,4.560975609756097
5109943,5,B007TSV4IS,Excellent video and fantastic history behind all the events that were shown. Great for preparing for history in various classes based on history.,1360454400,,145,5.3478260869565215
5109944,5,B007TSV4IS,I read the books a long time ago.  It was nice to see it as a movie.  Thanks so much,1360195200,,84,3.15
5109945,5,B007TSV4IS,"I remember watching this trilogy when I was just hitting puberty. One of Kim Catrall's early pieces of work and oh how good she looked. The first time I remember seeing Don Johnson and Delta Burke who I thought was perfect opposite Randolph Mantooth in The Seekers. Andrew Stevens was great as Phillip Kent but I really wish he was in the third film. I had looked for this series of films The Bastard, The Rebels and The Seekers for years and I'm so happy to see it finally made it to the digital age. I think a little attention could've been handled in regards to the detail of the prints and audio but I guess it's fine. Just happy to see them on DVD!",1358640000,,653,4.232
5109946,5,B007TSV4IS,I have been looking for this series for a long time.  Just like a remember it.  A good mini series with an all-star cast. Some of the actors went on to star in rememberable series and some have passed on but left their mark in TV.  This is a classic to have in your collection.,1357516800,4,277,4.0

5109950,5,B007TSV4IS,"Glad to see this highly underrated and relatively unknown miniseries finally brought to DVD.  I enjoyed watching it on TV back in the 80's and have been disappointed that Hollywood and the TV industry haven't shown this series more often.  It is a great snapshot of a young America being born, with the Revolution seen through the eyes of our early founding fathers and those who helped win our independence and built a nation.  Great acting by Andrew Stevens, a very young Don Johnson, and others, make this a must see!  A mixture of serious history and tongue in cheek humor make this an easy viewing and must for history buffs. Once you start watching, the hours fly by, and you can hardly stop. So, open up a good bottle of wine, get some good cheese, sit back and enjoy watching our Nation being born.  Highly recommend this series!",1356739200,11,837,4.590604026845638
