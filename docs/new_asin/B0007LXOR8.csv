8048768,4,B0007LXOR8,"i liked the video. chatter from the commentator's is a little vague sometimes, but not bad.",1204329600,,91,4.75
8048769,5,B0007LXOR8,"This is a very good 7 Muay Thai fights by legendary fighters, while in their prime.  Of course, most of these are now retired at the ripe old age of 26 or 27.  Muay Thai fights take a lot of toll on the fighters.  And these guys started fighting since they were 11 or 12.  A few of them now living and teaching in the U.S. and Europe.  If you're expecting to see just brute force, this is not a DVD for you.  Techniques, timing, and years of experience are what you will see on this DVD.  Four stars for each incredible knockout.  One extra star for the English commentation thruout the DVD.",1149120000,2,591,4.168141592920354
8048770,4,B0007LXOR8,"If you're in Muay Thai, this is a must see.  A decent follow up to the first volume.  Where else can you get to see legendary Muay Thai fighters, in their prime, fighting each others.  The best part is it's in English.  Lots of techniques and great timings by these fighters.  Some brawls, and of course, good knockouts.  Also, get the first volume.  I like that one just a bit more.",1149120000,4,383,4.309859154929577
8048771,5,B0007LXOR8,"I've seen many tapes, dvd's on Muay Thai, but I think this is the best so far. I've heard of some of the fighters, this is the first time I saw them fight. They made difficult and explosive techniques seem easy. It gives me motivation to train even harder.",1126224000,,256,4.244897959183674
8048772,1,B0007LXOR8,"This DVD has a very misleading ""Ultimate Fights"" title. It seems just like 7 random fights they slapped together to put in a DVD. It's hard to get into the fights because they do a poor job of introducing the fighters and the fights, and the commentators are horrible and barely audible. It also contains shameless self promotion of Muay Thai gyms and equipment. Very amatuer product. Not recommended.",1119052800,3,401,4.826086956521739
