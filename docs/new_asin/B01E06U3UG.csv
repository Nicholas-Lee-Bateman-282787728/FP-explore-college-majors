7728429,3,B01E06U3UG,"There are some decent segments. I like Easter particularly. Many of the vignettes cut off right at the the point they became interesting. Mother's day in particular was that way. Other segments, like Father's Day, just didn't have enough content for me to care. It would have been nice to have a wraparound segment. Otherwise these tales kind of just exist in space with no frame work.

Honestly, disappointing. I expected quite a bit more. Considering the origins of most of these holidays, coming up with some horrifying shorts doesn't seem like it should be that difficult.",1460851200,2,576,4.938144329896907
7728430,5,B01E06U3UG,"5 stars to the second half of this movie only. The first half is a waste of time. Start the movie off with Fathers day at 52min 50sec mark. Most people may not even stick around for the best parts because they are going to get fed up and turn it off before it gets good. If you are curious about any of the first half shorts watch Easter or maybe even Valentines day. If there is one down side to the second half it would be the Halloween short, not because its bad but because it looks cheap. I understand it is a low budget and most of the people working on this movie did it for free, so I can forgive that. Also I love profanity and the f word but if a sentence is mostly made up of them, then its not dialog is just cursing for the sake of cursing.",1460764800,2,753,3.896103896103896

7728432,2,B01E06U3UG,"WOW....  wow wow wow. horrible anthology  movie, just horrible.  I won't talk about each segment, I will say there were only 2 that were ok... I Was hoping at least Kevin Smiths movie would be good but it was one of the worst !!!!!  So sad I waited a while for this to come out and and thought it would be good.  It is a fail !.

Again about Kevin Smiths movie in it, it had nothing to do with Halloween...... You  barely even knew it took place on Halloween, if it were not the girls in the movie saying it was Halloween, and seeing some Halloween candy and a tiny fake pumpkin in a box.. ZERO  Halloween atmosphere.... Kevin Smiths segment was ( to me ) a joke...  I thought oh cool Smith has the Halloween segment ! He will come up with something cool, so not true !!!!!! almost like he put no effort into it at all. Kevin Smiths segment to me is like a youtube video some amateur  made.  The only 2 that I would say were fair at best is the Christmas one, and the New Years Eve one.

The Fathers day movie  started out like hey, this just might be interesting, and then all of a sudden BAM ends with a wtf ???? kind of ending..  Some people might enjoy the movies, but I am being 110% honest when I say DO NO  expect much at all.  I seen a website comparing it to Creep Show lol I had to laugh, no way at all does this mess even come close to Creep Show..... So again to wrap it up, I will give props to the Christmas segment and the New Years Eve segment,I am giving it 2 stars for those 2 segments.......All the others ? FAIL BIG TIME

. I know I have said it a few times lol but I have to one more time, KEVIN SMITH'S  IS  THE WORST !!!!!!!!!!!.",1460678400,2,1652,3.966565349544073

7728435,2,B01E06U3UG,"Below average horror anthology featuring an assortment of holiday themed horror shorts.  Valentine's Day is a colorful segment about a bullied high school girl with a crush on her swimming coach.  The segment is attractively filmed and well-acted but has a very weak payoff.  If Valentine's Day seems to have been influenced by Stephen King's Carrie, the cheeky St. Patrick's Day segment seems to take its inspiration almost equally from The Wicker Man and Ken Russell's Lair of the White Worm--although it is, unfortunately, nowhere near as good as either.  It does feature a creepy child, which is always a plus, and kind of a cute a cute payoff but it doesn't add up to much.  Easter is about a little girl who is weirdly afraid of the holiday since Jesus rose from the dead the same day the Easter Bunny comes.  There's a good idea in there somewhere, but the filmmakers never come close to finding it.  I don't really know what happened in the Mother's Day or Father's Day segments.  Both have intriguing set-ups that go nowhere and endings that made no sense to me.  Kevin Smith's Halloween segment at least has a decent punch line and it's probably the best thing that Smith has done since he has tried to reinvent himself as a horror comedy filmmaker, but it doesn't much work as horror and has virtually no connection with Halloween beyond a passing mention of the holiday.  The Christmas and New Year's Eve segments end things on an appropriately forgettable note.

Holidays is one of the weaker entries in the recent horror anthology boom that includes the V/H/S and ABC's of Death series.  Holidays doesn't have a single standout segment to its credit.  There's virtually no suspense, nothing particularly scary and only a couple of laughs.  This one definitely isn't worth the price of a rental, but if it turns up on Amazon Prime or Netflix might be a borderline decent watch for free.",1480032000,,1899,4.75

Like a perfect short story, EASTER sets up its premise and fulfills it without a moment of hesitation or waste. It has the internal logic of a nightmare, but with a dream's chaotic sense that this scenario could ""just about go anywhere.""

It would be a shame to ruin it. Best not to know ANYTHING except a cursory knowledge of the Easter holiday before seeing it. Truly weird and amazing.",1469318400,,633,4.642857142857143

7728454,3,B01E06U3UG,"Some very strong segments, but also a few boring and weak segments keep this anthology film from a better rating.

Valentine's Day: Very Creepshow-esque. Predictable as a tale of just deserts but that somehow makes it awesome. We are all along for the ride even though we know where it will end up.

St. Patrick's Day: I loved this. And so nice to see a St. Pat's horror movie with nary a leprechaun in sight.

Easter: Creepy. Horrifying. Awesome.

Mother's Day: Weak, weak, weak. An attempt to make a statement about pregnancy and women rights fails miserably due to a nonsensical plot and a weak ending. Probably the worst segment of the anthology, especially since another segment tackled a similar theme better.

Father's Day: Excellent right up to the weak non-ending. So much build-up, acting, suspense and beautiful cinematography wasted.

Halloween: Weak. Kevin Smith takes an over-the-top concept and doesn't give it the over-the-top treatment it deserves. He could have done a lot more to tie his holiday in - so many possibilities here with witches and trick-or-treating, but he pays them the barest of lip service, and the segment is lacking as a result. Many people were upset by the grossness of the subject matter. I was simply upset that he did not take the segment to 11, where it deserved.

Christmas: A strong, funny story about the horribleness of humanity.

New Year's Eve: Another strong segment. Sometimes it's better to spend NYE alone.

So, overall, a mixed bag. The weak ones were frustrating because you could see the talent there being squandered on the weak segments, all of which felt like they had the potential to be great if the director and writer had just sat down and put more thought into it. Also, no Fourth of July segment? Just felt wrong.",1467763200,4,1779,4.8256578947368425
7728455,4,B01E06U3UG,"I enjoyed the majority of this anthology Although there were a couple that ended quite abrubtly! My favorites being Valentines Day,Easter,Halloween,Christmas and New Years Eve.

(Easter) was particularly creepy to me. The Easter Bunny\ Jesus creature was very effective and creative. People have been raving about (Fathers Day) but I found it to be quite predictable. There really wasn't much gore in the entire anthology save some blood splatter and a slash or two.

I found myself entertained the entire time so there were really no weak spots except maybe (St Patrick's Day) which was unintentionally tongue in cheek. If you like Horror anthologys especially Holiday themed horror,this will hit the spot. I don't know why it got so many unfavorable reviews. Every horror film isn't going to be an instant classic.",1467417600,4,816,5.174242424242424
7728456,1,B01E06U3UG,"Bad. Just bad.

I was stoked for this anthology, but man does it miss the mark.

Most of the stories herein are extremely short and weak. The only ones worth a gander are Easter and Father's Day as they're the only two that depict something kinda-sorta-interesting before delivering crap endings (similar to the rest). The anthology also strangely picks its holidays while leaving other major ones out. Were they afraid of a longer runtime? Geez, god forbid it run into two hours...

The worst, by far, is Kevin Smith's which I want to believe was written by his daughter (as she stars in it) and it comes off like what a teenage girl would write/think is witty/funny when it's just terrible. It's not funny, it's not intense/scary, it's just embarrassing considering it came from the man behind Clerks, Mallrats and even Red Stated. Worse, it's actually just a rip-off of another horror flick except a shortened version.

Like a lot of anthologies, the filmmakers herein mistake a ""gotcha"" moment as a story. Rather than actually deliver a short narrative, all of these are the same, paint-by-numbers shorts where nothing about their mini-plots is compelling other than waiting for the WTF moment abruptly ending with nothing being accomplished storywise. All of them just present an idea (most of the time something stupid) but structurally, there's no actual beginning, middle or end. It's just an idea (like the Bunny Jesus) that makes you go ""Huh, I wonder where this will go"" before going nowhere with the concept and abruptly ending.

Typically with an anthology, you can find a couple of bad shorts, some mediocre ones and some rare great ones, but Holidays just has lazy-to-bad-to-meh.

7728465,3,B01E06U3UG,"I rented this movie anthology mostly because I noticed Kevin Smith was involved and I wanted to give it a shot. For the most part this anthology wasn't too bad but half of the stories felt underdeveloped and unfinished. It was almost as if they didn't think about the ending that much and just tried to meet the time limits for each story.

Now this anthology is only 8 stories long, so out of the eight I only really liked four. For me these four do make up for what was lacking in the other four I didn't like and that made this worthwhile as a rental.

Father's Day - A woman who thinks her father died when she was young, receives a tape recorder with a message from her father and how to find him. This story was creepy and had an ominous tone through out. It really held my attention and kept me wondering about the father.

Halloween - Which I think would have been the easiest holiday to do was taken from a different point of view. A group of girls that was tricked into being webcam girls for a real jerk take revenge on Halloween. This one was written by Kevin Smith and if you are a fan of his you would recognize the writing. It has it's moments and the dialogue (which I think is Kevin Smith's strong point) is great.

Christmas - A man is trying to get the latest virtual reality glasses for his son but doesn't make it in time to get the gift. In desperation, he does something he would never think of doing and in turn has to live with what he's done. This one is a great look at how far someone will get the latest technology and how that can backfire. Seth Green does a great job in this movie and it's well worth the watch.

New Year's - Internet dating at it's worse especially on the holidays. This was just fun in general of a date gone wrong with some gore. It plays on fears everyone has had at some point with internet dating.

Overall, I wasn't too disappointed with this rental.",1462579200,14,1906,4.208219178082191
7728466,5,B01E06U3UG,"This horror anthology features monstrous pregnancy, creepy kids, zombie Jesus, genital mutilation, pagan cults, teen bullying gone wrong, the evil Easter bunny and deadly Dating site meet-ups among other maladies.  Definitely one of the better horror anthologies of the last several years.

If you've followed my reviews for a while now then you ought to know that I love horror anthologies.  In some anthologies all of the short stories are directed by one man and written by another (e.g., Creepshow), but in this case each short story has a different writer and director (like V/H/S).
Unlike many anthologies which feature a story teller or wraparound story (e.g., Creepshow, Tales from the Darkside: The Movie) or taking the approach of linked stories in which one component of the previous story links us to the next (e.g., Southbound, Trick r Treat), this anthology simply delivers a series of horror shorts related only in that they are all holiday-themed.  The shorts are presented in their calendar order and all have delightfully twisted endings.  This anthology really was a pleasant surprise.

Valentine's Day introduces us to a quiet high school girl (Madeleine Coghlan) bullied by her diving team and teased about her crush on their coach.  The tone is uneasingly awkward and when the young girls bully it makes us uncomfortable (in a good, effective way).  Written and directed by Dennis Widmyer and Kevin Kolsch (they did Starry Eyes), this breezy short takes a hard turn when the victim gets her brutal revenge.  You'll smile.

St. Patrick's Day is tremendously effective in its awkwardness as well, and follows suit in the creepy kids department.  An Irish primary school teacher (Ruth Bradley; Grabbers) is haunted by a strange student and a stranger subsequent pregnancy.  Only, pregnant with whatand howand why?  It's funny in the darkest way.  The birth scene is interesting followed by a most dream-like celebration.  Written and directed by Gary Shore (Dracula Untold).

Easter is just plain wrong in ways that made my darkest side squeal with glee.  A young girl encounters a most sacrilegious zombie Jesus Easter Bunny that births baby chicks from its stigmata.  Wow.  Written and directed by Nicholas McCarthy (The Pact), this is something different.

Mother's Day.  All sorts of weirdness ensues after a young woman who can't stop getting pregnant joins a fertility ritual for women who can't.  I can't say I understand the ending and this was just plain odd.  Written and directed by Sarah Adina Smith, this short was among my least favorites.

Father's Day was easily the most compelling and tense of the shorts in this anthology.  A young woman (Jocelin Donahue; The House of the Devil, Insidious Chapter 2) receives a tape recorder with a message from her father--who she thought had died 20+ years ago--with instructions on how to find him.  Written and directed by Anthony Scott Burns, I desperately want this guy to do more horror!!!  Maybe even stretch this into an entire movie.

Halloween disappointingly had nothing to do with Halloween at all.  It's the only short in this anthology that fails to follow the theme of its holiday and, on top of that, it's a crass shock film that fails at being shocking.  It wasn't well acted or well written and I must say I was surprised to see this garbage was written and directed by Kevin Smith (Tusk).

Christmas stars Seth Green (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) as a man tasked with getting the latest hot tech gift for his son.  But how far will he go to get it, and what will he learn about himself when he does?  Written and directed by Scott Stewart (Dark Skies, Priest, Legion), this one is cheeky.

New Year's Eve was definitely the most fun.  A murderous man meets a quirky woman on a Dating site for a NYE date that does not go as he planned.  Directed by Adam Egypt Mortimer (Some Kind of Hate), this short gives me hope that he will make more such movies.

In general I was very pleased with this horror anthology.  I liked it even more than Southbound (2015)!  Probably the only disappointing shorts for me were Mother's Day and Kevin Smith's Halloween, which was the only short that didn't connect well with its assigned holiday and it had probably the worst acting, writing and--sorry Kevin--directing.  It just felt like amateur hour despite some mildly campy humorand it didn't match its surroundings well.  For me the best short was Father's Day--just harrowing.  But basically all of these shorts (except, Mother's Day and Halloween) were very satisfying.  Few anthologies are of such quality.",1462233600,6,4584,4.929503916449086
