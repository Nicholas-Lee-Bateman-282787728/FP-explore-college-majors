2909443,3,B000TSMOGG,"Well, lemmie begin with this: I was introduced to this fantastic series through Cartoon Network's Adult Swim (or Toonami). This is what got me into anime (Along with Cowboy Bebop), as the series (the OVA Ryo-Ohki that is)was well scripted, risque, hilarious and drama/action packed ALL AT ONCE. It ranks up as probably my favorite TV show o' all time.  So needless to say, I was ecstatic to learn they would finally be releasing the continuing story to the old series. Now, let's just say, this series doesn't suck. As a matter of opinion, it's actually rather good (though they should have payed Ryoko's original OD-er to come back); the plot can be rather twisty at points, but the comedy is still zany and laugh out loud funny. Also, as opposed to what some fans might have thought, I rather liked the new animation. That said, there was so much more potential here. Personally speaking, if they want to redeem this OVA set, they need to make another fourth one to explain this one AS WELL as the leftovers from OVAs one and two. Kinda saddening really, but that just means (I assume) that we'll be seeing more Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki in the future; just hopefully not another ten years so. Bottom line; if you really like the series, you'll overlook the flaws in this set and buy it, as it really is pretty good anyway. Hopefully though, they will continue this series and keep good ol' Tenchi alive. Cheers.",1226448000,,1410,4.64
2909444,3,B000TSMOGG,"In this series, many of Ayeka and Sasami's relatives come down to earth to share some exciting news with Tenchi.  For those of you who may have seen episodes on Cartoon Network, the series is the one where Ryo Ohki is a child-like creature instead of her usual bunny sized self.  I recomend this Tenchi series for the more die hard Tenchi fans out there; although there are humorous moments, this series is more dramatic than other series like Tenchi in Tokyo or Tenchi Universe. It is a little short also. Mihoshi fans, definately check this set out, for Kione fans, sorry, she's is not in this series.",1218844800,,603,4.574074074074074
2909445,2,B000TSMOGG,"It says on the cover that this is The Complete Series. It is in fact the last 7 episodes to a 20 episode series. AKA: You get ripped off.

The Tenchi Muyo! Ryo Ohki series is in fact the first series in the Tenchi Muyo universe. It was released in 3 OVA seasons. The first season had 7 episodes in it, and the second had 6. Both of those seasons were played on Cartoon Network back in 2000 on Toonami. OVA Season 3 is what you get if you buy this item. It is simply the last 7 episodes to the entire series, along with some bonus material.",1218672000,52,539,3.990740740740741
2909446,2,B000TSMOGG,"I am a huge Tenchi fan and waited excitedly for this next installment, but I was severely disappointed. One issue was because Petra Burchard the voice actress for Ryoko was replaced by Mona Marshall who did not in anyway do justice to Ryoko's character. Another issue is that if you have not seen the spin off Tenchi Muyo GXP (that has nothing to really do with the Tenchi Series) you will not understand several of the new characters that were added. There were too many confusing aspects to this series to actually be able to call it a sequel. I was happy that most of the main voice cast stayed but that didn't help the bad story line.

There was an episode where the red hair ties in Sasami's hair were used as weapons and that never happened in the original. Noike the new girl in Tenchi's life is supposedly his fiance and yet she's a traitor. Also there was something at the end about a female Nakago. To refresh memories Nakago was the the villain in the last series who kidnapped Ryoko. It's not really explained about this female child version or what she's about.
The only good aspect was that the animation was an improvement, but I must say as other reviewers had mentioned that if you are a hard core fan it's a disappointment.

Also if you want to be confused as to what is going on then this is the show for you. Another hint is that rewatching the original will not help to explain it. Take it as a whole new anime not an extension and it will be easier to take.",1215388800,,1479,4.335740072202166
2909447,4,B000TSMOGG,"The Tenchi series is a really good, but WHY? This series was good but there are still some loose ends to the story. The characters all somewhat the same. It seemed that their personalities were changed a little.

If the makers of the Tenchi series do read this PLEASE TIE UP THE LOOSE ENDS IN THE SERIES!!!!!!!",1209254400,2,310,4.43859649122807
2909448,3,B000TSMOGG,"I was quite eager to see this series, hoping for an ending to the fine original OAV series, which I always thought was the best out there. What I got left me more than slightly puzzled.
First, what you get is new characters, a lot of them, including one more rival for Tenchi. This results in less time for the traditional characters, and not much time for character development. The chief rivals for Tenchi's affections, Ayeka and Ryoko, are still around, but they have little to do other than react to what the new characters are doing.
Second, those who thought they knew this story had better think again, because it turns out that most of the established facts were incomplete. This means that a large portion of airtime is spent trying to explain the story, which may explain why the truly new plot twists were not fully established in my opinion.
Though I am a fan of this storyline, maybe this entry shows that it is time to take a break, and give this whole concept a rest. Let's give Tenchi some time off, and let's see if he's got something new to show us in the future.",1203292800,2,1081,4.437185929648241
2909449,3,B000TSMOGG,"You have to watch Tenchi Muyo GXP to get a better understanding of what is happening in this series although they try to explain its better if you watch GXP.
I really miss watching Tenchi especially after the last movie but this series has me scratching my head.
The animation is really cool with really great backgrounds but the writers invented some rather unusal plot points from out of way, way out there from left field which will leave us hard core fans going HUH?
Don't read past this point it has spoiler comments.
What happened to Kione, Mahoshi's more competent sidekick?
Why did they introduce Mahoshi's brother into the series?
You get a bunch of new characters but also some weirdness with Washu actually being a god of creation?
The new actress for Ryoko's voice takes a lot of adjustments they should have just paid the original actress more money or looked for someone else that sounded like the old Ryoko.
They introduce a new character that is supposed to be Tenchi's arranged marriage wife but then she's not and gets this dorky hair cut and it makes you want to shoot the plot director.
I hope they make another series or movie to help us forget this one.",1202601600,6,1175,4.6
2909450,3,B000TSMOGG,"So I waited, waited for years, and finally the new epsiodes came out. The first few episodes were great, fit nicely into the world established previously...and the characters were great.

Sadly, about halfway...things take a nose dive.

I sat through the last three or so epsiodes and while they had moments that were nice, over all they were a large disappointment.

The epic battle expected...isn't there. Its as if the writers got to the fight and realized they had nothing left. The plot suddenly falls apart, becoming disjointed and rather...confusing.

Over all I say a solid three stars, maybe 3 and a half. Still a good series over all, fans should get enough enjoyment from the good episodes to justify buying this.",1197158400,,724,4.909836065573771
2909451,3,B000TSMOGG,"i've waited for the new episodes about ten years.thank GOD they came out! i don't like unfinished things!
for the old fans i think that they will be dissapointed.the new characters don't have the charm and the originallity of the old characters.the english voices are the same from the old episodes but only ryokos voice is a little bit changed :-(
in general the new fans will find it interesting.the old fans as i said will be dissapointed but Tenchi is TENCHI!

2909487,2,B000TSMOGG,"Tenchi Muyo! Ryo Ohki is mediocre. The story line is overly complex and poorly written, making it difficult to follow along. To make matters worse, the new voice actor for Ryoko sounds nothing like Petrea Burchard. Petrea's distinct voice is what made Ryoko such an exceptional character. This part of the OVA series desperately needs to be re-dubbed with Petrea's voice or another actor that sounds similar. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two OVAs and was looking forward to this third installment However, I found Tenchi Muyo! Ryo Okhi to be quite lackluster overall.",1442448000,2,569,5.0638297872340425

2909502,1,B000TSMOGG,"Wow, where to even begin here. It's bad, really really bad. The characters make their Tenchi In Tokyo counterparts seem sane by comparison. The writing envies GXP. Few if any of the outstanding plot elements from the earlier OAVs are resolved. I'd say it's like a poorly written fan fiction, but that would be an insult to bad fan fiction. This takes every flaw in the series, the writing or it's characters, cranks it up to eleven, and rips off the knob.  Many new characters and plot elements are introduced for no particular reason.  I think everyone passes out from heat exhaustion at some point. To the point it could be a drinking game.  And someone should be flogged over that bit about Tenchi's mom, and not just for wasting the entire final episode on what amounts to one bad joke.  If you're looking to finally see the worthy completion of a great series after all these years, don't, just don't.

Also, as others have mentioned, while this is complete, it is only the recently made 7 episode conclusion to a series of OAVs from the early 90s. The earlier parts are not included.",1429315200,5,1089,4.592783505154639

2909511,3,B000TSMOGG,"I am a huge fan of Tenchi Muyo. When I first started learning about and watching anime, it was one of the first titles I indulged in. I loved the original story as seen in the OVA, but, unfortunately; it seems with each retake on the Tenchi Universe that things become more ""sterile"" and boring. This version has all the original characters, plus a few new ones such as Mihoshi's brother, and Tenchi's grandmother, plus a mystery woman who is to be Tenchi's bride to be.
  Also, what seems to be lacking is the crisp and clean artwork that was there in the Original Version of the Anime. The characters look like who they are supposed to be, but sadly they aren't drawn as well as they were in the original.
The storyline is marginal, the artwork a bit muted, and the storyline, could use a bit more work. I mean when you can pretty much tell that the voice actors are reading from their scripts in the final take...Thats a problem, Finally, did I mention how ""corny"" the story gets when it deals with Rhyo Ohki interacting with the cast members.",1416960000,,1046,4.442708333333333

2909536,1,B000TSMOGG,"Here is why I gave an unfavorable review for this product: it's false advertising, plain and simple.  I don't know if this is on Amazon's end, but advertising this as ""classic"" Tenchi Muyo (parentheses or otherwise) is extremely misleading.  This set includes only the infamous, late-coming third installment of the original OVA (the first two OVA's are what everyone considers and remembers as ""classic"" Tenchi Muyo).  I've seen this for years: Funimation (who was not behind dubbing the original series) deliberately puts ""complete series"" on the box, hoping people will confuse this lesser product for the noteworthy original.  The main point I'm stressing here isn't whether I like it or don't (though the latter is my opinion, and is also the general consensus among fans) the point is simply this: product ""x"" shouldn't be marketed as product ""y"" to try to cover a company's losses, and customers shouldn't be outright lied to.

2909539,5,B000TSMOGG,This completes the tenchi ova series and ties it into the gxp series. Despite what others have said I believe this is a good ending. Yes there are a couple a voices that have change but it doesn't deviate from the story line and the actors play the part to how the story line evolved in the first two.

2909571,5,B000TSMOGG,"It took me a while to decide whether to buy this because of some reviews saying it was only a partial product.  Technically true: this is the last 1/3 of the OVA series, and completes the story told if you bought the ""Tenchi Muyo!: OVA Series"".

I'm very happy I did buy this, because in countless ways, the OVA series (completed by this Ryo-Ohki set and continued by the GXP series) is superior to the Tenchi Universe and that is my personal opinion that I won't bore anyone with.

In any case, I had already purchased the OVA and GXP series, and would have been missing out if I hadn't found out that this Ryo-Ohki set goes in the middle.  I found it to be a lot of fun- more crazy stuff happening, more crazy aliens show up, and the art style and animation quality are improved as well.",1365379200,2,789,4.275167785234899

It has some conversation, but Tenchi Muyo was always known for the spunky hilarious banter! I recommend this to any Tenchi Muyo fan. (The action is ok)",1364256000,,425,4.2592592592592595

2909574,1,B000TSMOGG,"I enjoyed Tenchi Muyo first and second OVA series in the mid 90 which it ended on the cliffhanger until almost 10 years later Tenchi Muyo Ryo Ohki released as the third OVA series picked up where the second OVA ended. I was glad it gets third OVA series at first but after I watched the few episodes from Ryo Ohki, I was very disappointment for more than one reason. The character design is slightly worsen than previous OVA, I am not too picky about English dub but this one the dub is awful, the complete third OVA is not funny nor interesting, and previous OVA have a handful of interesting soundtracks (J-Pop) that was nicely translated into English version which you won't find any on this one. Overall I feel this third OVA lost most of the charms that I like about first OVA, second OVA, and Tenchi Universe.",1362873600,5,815,4.44
2909575,1,B000TSMOGG,"First - a disclaimer:  the DVD is in perfect working order, the box is lovely, the packaging flawless.

My unhappiness is with what has happened to my beloved childhood memories.

As other reviewers have pointed out, this is not the entirety of Tenchi Muyo.  It is more properly considered the third season, following OVA 1 and and OVA 2.  I knew this going into this purchase - but what I did not realize was that the voice actors for several main characters had been changed.  This would have only been a small problem, but adding significant insult to injury, the characters personalities have been 're-interpreted.'  I know I'm not overstating the reality here, because in a flashback on the first episode of this season an OVA 1 episode was redubbed AND rescripted.  The results were underwhelming.

In any case - unless you really want to say you have the complete Tenchi collection, think long and hard about spending money on this.  I am a huge fan of Tenchi Muyo OVA 1 and 2, and thought that I could tolerate whatever other problems this season might have, but as it stands I could not get past the bad replacement voice actors and wanton destruction of 2 seasons worth of character development.",1362441600,17,1205,4.695238095238095

2909577,1,B000TSMOGG,"This has to be one of the most disappointing finales to a series ever. Tenchi Muyo Ryo Ohki is technically OVA 3 and takes place after the original series. What unfolds is a complete and utter mess of a plot filled with way too many plot-points and characters, which most get brushed to the side and only appear briefly in a one episode or two. Without giving away spoilers, I will only say to be cautious with this series, and I would only recommend it to the true fans of the Tenchi series. Although I enjoyed the original OVA series, this will just leave you scratching your head in complete confusion with this follow-up. Preferably, I'd stick with either the original OVA series alone or the even better Tenchi Universe series.",1358380800,16,732,4.595419847328245
2909578,4,B000TSMOGG,This is the conclusion to the legendary original Tenchi Muyo series. Telling you about the story would spoil the fun for old Tenchi fans that haven't seen it. I'll just say that it takes a major plot twist in any Tenchi series to surprise me b/c it's all been done. That was what I thought before I saw this. It's got some major surprises in store. It's great. The only complaint I have is the different voice actor for Ryoko. Other than that this is a great conclusion to the original Tenchi series. Definitely give it a go.,1350691200,9,525,4.36734693877551

2909593,3,B000TSMOGG,"Okay, for those of you who are like me and have been looking for the Tenchi Muyo series played on Toonami, then listen up!

This is it...kind of.

Toonami played two different series of Tenchi Muyo!  One of them was Tenchi Universe, which runs 26 episode and is produced by Pioneer.  The second series was called Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-ohki, which is what you're looking at.  However, it was split up into three different ""seasons.""  Season one and two were released by Pioneer, and the third one (IE this disc set) was released by Funimation.  So when this box set says ""complete collection,"" it is actually only the LAST 7 EPISODES of the 20 episode series.  So you'll need to look up the first two seasons from Pioneer.

So if you're hoping that this disc set will complete your long journey, I regret to inform you that you still have two more seasons to find.  Although, for $10, it could be worse.",1310688000,108,897,4.515527950310559
2909594,5,B000TSMOGG,Tenchi Muyo was one of the first anime series to really catch on in the U.S. It has a solid story line with a lot of likeable characters. A funny like comedy that most will probably enjoy.,1308614400,,188,4.108108108108108
2909595,1,B000TSMOGG,"The original Tenchi Muyo was the reason why I started watching anime. Tenchi Muyo was the first anime to ever play with feelings and emotions. And the creators of the classic series did it so good, Tenchi Muyo still manages to connect and get loyal fans and new fans alike into an emotional roller coaster. With that said, the ""Ryo Ohki"" series is just wrong totally wrong. I didn't care for any of the characters at all! The story did not make any sense at all. And they even made Tenchi's mom seem like she was a retard for playing jokes on people (even as far as using a marker to paint on baby tenchi's face).
They went as far as to show clips from the original, but that quickly fails to connect with fans of the series due to the voice cast change and poor acting direction.

Guys and girls, please skip this series along with the GXP series. It's not worth it.

The classic Tenchi Muyo! series, Tenchi Universe series, Tenchi in Tokyo series, plus all 3 Tenchi Movies are classics and I can't recommend them enough. And of course, I'm not forgetting to recommend the Mihoshi/Pretty Sammy special.

I'm a true fan of Tenchi and I believe that if funimation wants to make a hit out of a classic Tenchi series, they should focus on getting the original English voice actors of the series and bring an English language version of Magical Project S. (Magical Girl-Pretty Sammy) If there is such a thing, I haven't seen it since I only see Jap language with Eng subtitles.",1307836800,4,1473,4.4684014869888475
2909596,1,B000TSMOGG,"Classic, complete series :( just words, I was thinking maybe they got pioneers rights OVA's to 1+2. A little searching turned up unimpressive results, this is just the viridian collection re-released under their anime classics titles.",1305849600,21,234,5.527777777777778
2909597,2,B000TSMOGG,"Tenchi Muyo! is one of those legendary anime productions that continues to live on in the minds of fans. Essentially a fairy tale and a coming-of-age story, the plot revolves around the seemingly simple Tenchi who inexplicably finds himself surrounded by a bevy of beautiful alien women. Naturally, zany adventure and epic danger quickly ensue. For many, this now common ""harem"" style of anime was their first introduction to the art form during a time when it was still a rare commodity. And for most, the series' cast of lovable, fascinating, and unforgettable characters still remain indelibly etched onto their hearts.

The franchise is also a complicated one, with various versions of the original series spanning nearly all forms of media, including television, manga, video games, and even novels. Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki - Box Set The Complete Series is the much anticipated seven episode continuation of the original OVA (original video animation, or direct-to-video) animated series, although fans expecting to find the show's earlier thirteen episodes will not find them here.

Misleading monikers aside, these newest installments to the Tenchi canon serve as perfect examples of how not to resurrect a series. After a thirteenth episode that ended on a rather inconclusive note, fans, after years of waiting, naturally imagined the new stories would contain the same heartfelt romantic intrigue, epic battles, and zany shenanigans associated with the earlier productions. Instead, they received seven boring, nearly humorless episodes that revolved around characters not even present in the earlier stories. Below are some of my more detailed complaints, but beware of spoilers:

Remember Ryoko, the awesome space pirate? She's now a weak, ineffectual whiner. Remember Noike and Misau? Of course not, because they weren't in the earlier episodes, but they dominate these. Remember the awesome battles in the climactic sixth episode? Not one is worth mentioning this time around. Remember wondering what Tenchi's mother must have been like? Well, you got your wish--she was a deluded prankster who enjoyed toying with Tenchi through trickery and gags. Remember thinking Yosho was an unmarried widower? Well, turns out he's actually married to a Jurain woman that he sees, hmmm, virtually never. Remember thinking Lady Seto, the Devil Princess of Jurai, must really be a force to be reckoned with? Nah, she's just a harmless, somewhat frail woman. Remember looking forward to a climactic showdown with the Goddess Tokimi? Never happens, turns out she just wants to be friends! Remember wondering about the identity of the Counter-Actor? Of course not, she never existed or was even hinted at in the earlier stories, nor is she well explained in these. And, of course, here's the biggest one--Which girl does Tenchi choose? Apparently, he will someday marry all of them. *sigh*

Couple all these complaints with just average animation and shaky writing, and you have what is possibly the worst continuation of a beloved series anyone could have ever conjured up. The show's only slightly redeeming quality is that certain long-held questions regarding some of the characters are finally resolved or explained (but whether anyone likes those ""answers"" is a different story).

The entire Tenchi Muyo franchise is special. Seek out the earlier episodes (known as Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki OVA 1 and 2), check out the TV series Tenchi Universe (and its excellent sequel movies, Tenchi Muyo in Love and Tenchi Forever), and seek out Hitoshi Okuda's brilliant No Need for Tenchi manga novels. But as for the episodes in this set, they will only make you cry.",1246838400,3,3655,5.27319587628866
2909598,4,B000TSMOGG,"I've been a Tenchi fan since the original OVA was released,along with the two subsequent sequels and three movies. When I heard about the new episodes,I was excited and couldn't wait! True,many of the voices from the original cast are here-except for Petrea Buchard who voiced Ryoko. The animation sticks as close to the original look as possible,but blends in the newer CG effects in several scenes. More insight to several characters and the addition of a couple of new faces made this installment refreshing. Less attention was paid to the love triangle of Tenchi,Ryoko and Ayeka than was done before. Some of the silliness is gone-which underscored the charm of Tenchi-with more emphasis on the fate of our universe with the gang stuck right in the middle! While several fans have voiced their disappointment,I found this installment fun and at times,unexpectedly tender. I'd have posted four stars if Ryoko's voice had been the same-but even her character takes a few unexpected turns as well!",1237852800,,998,5.054545454545455
2909599,4,B000TSMOGG,"I am a big Tenchi fan, and this along with the Robotech series are my most favorite of the anime series out there.  However, unlike the previous versions of Tenchi out there, this was the shortest.  After about disc two, it actually then becomes the weirdest entry in the series.  It is still worth the money, and the new character of Noike is quite charming, but this is by far the weirdest one yet.  If you are a fellow fan of Tenchi, check it out first, just to be on the safe side.  I like weird stuff, so as for myself, I didn't mind it.",1232841600,,542,4.123809523809523

An every time I hit play I noticed this little icon would show up on the screen on top of the video as I watched it.
