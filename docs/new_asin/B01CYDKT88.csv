8754347,5,B01CYDKT88,Wonderful dramatic series about the lives of the women and their friends and families who wend their way through a career in a high end prostitution business. Australian laws legalizing prostitution vary by region. Well written and engrossing. Nothing sensationalized about the subject.,1517702400,,286,5.674418604651163
8754348,5,B01CYDKT88,"I loved the series. It was on Netflix then Hulu now its on tubitv. You have to sign in and deal w the oddly timed ad breaks but if u wanna watch it in the US that's ur only choice. Same as the other reviewer I thought it very thoughtful of this trade. Sullivan Stapleton is in it so as he says ""I'm in it"" hahaha I'll watch it.",1509408000,2,327,3.753623188405797
8754349,5,B01CYDKT88,I have been trying to find this series since I first saw it streaming through Netflix in the US about 2008-9.  Why is it not available on streaming now?. It appears it can only be purchased by DVD and formatted to exclude USA DVD players. It was made in Australia in 2007. This 3 season series is exceptionally well written  and presents a different side of the  lives of sex workers which shows their caring and concern for each other and those with whom they work. I was blown away by the sensitivity this series showed towards a subject which is often thought of as sleazy.,1461283200,6,576,4.415094339622642
