8114217,2,B000ETRA9G,"Bad audio and poorly made in general. The commentary of the two experts is hard to hear; perhaps the microphone was too far away and/or the acoustics of the room in which they were interviewed is inappropriate, plus they have British accents. Their voices are significantly more quiet than that of the narrator. The same images are shown repeatedly. At one time the narrator is mentioning Galileo's discovery of the moons of Jupiter but the video is showing the earth. Some images of ""the heavens"" have nothing to do with Galileo whatsoever. There is not much information about the trial, perhaps since the show is 50 minutes long. The captions on the back of the case are reversed to appear with the wrong image. Bless their sweet hearts for tryin', but don't waste your money on this.",1421280000,,786,4.744525547445256
8114218,2,B000ETRA9G,Good overview but not balanced enough for my tastes.  The background music was a very bad choice.  It is sleep inducing and repetitive so it is not a good choice for classroom viewing.,1393200000,,184,4.545454545454546
8114219,1,B000ETRA9G,"I bought this to show my physics students. The audio is terrible, you can barely hear anything even when your volume is cranked all the way up. It's virtually inaudible in a classroom setting. I would not buy this again.",1362009600,,220,4.525
8114220,4,B000ETRA9G,"Neither glamorizing nor demonizing this important man of science, this video is a good overview of his life, his scientific contributions, and his controversy with the church.  Recommended as a serious introductory examination of his life.",1191715200,12,239,5.638888888888889
