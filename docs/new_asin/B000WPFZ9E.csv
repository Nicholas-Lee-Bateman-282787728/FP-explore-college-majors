2.  Information delivered is about only 3 types of sentiment indicators:  (1) Put/Call ratios, (2) the volatility indicators VIX & VXN, and (3) sentiment surveys such as those by Market Vane, Investor's Intelligence and the American Association of Individual Investors.  Much of this information is already available on the Web.

3.  The speaker was good, the setting was good, and the slides were mostly good; it was only the material, which was for investors/traders new to sentiment.

4.  I thought information about some effective, never-before-revealed indicator(s) would be presented and that's why they were charging the high price.  I was wrong.  I found the product description to be vague and misleading, and will not be buying their other overpriced products in the future.

5.  If you are new to sentiment and are interested in buying this DVD, I would buy it used.  If you are serious about using sentiment indicators, trading against the crowd, and are looking for a wide variety of indicator charts, then I would search for information on the subject of ""Jason Goepfert"" on the Web.",1221004800,6,1271,4.878504672897196
