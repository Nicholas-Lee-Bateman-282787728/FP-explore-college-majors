Aussies are so fond of poking fun at Kiwi speech it is a real treat to watch them laughing at themselves. These two ladies and their hunks of spunk are just the way to see this nation of over achieving sports crazy louded mouth ockers the americans of the south pacific .Sharon is the epitome of the sports mad Shelia  and plays the sad sidekick to Kims hopeless lifestyle. Great laughs and brilliant satire of themselves and their nation. This show has a huge following over the ditch and is just what is needed to counteract Dame Edna and her kiwi side kick. Get it you will not regret it",1195344000,,762,4.255172413793104

It's a touch thick on the Australian accent and jokes, but once you get the knack you will have a blast.  Family life was never this dis-functionally funny!!!",1191628800,2,242,4.355555555555555

I first saw this television show from an airline flight in 2003 from London, England and I have just purchased the second season of Kath & Kim which I love because Gina Riley and Jane Turner play Kath and Kim Day, a mother and daughter team. In the first season, Kath marries Del Knight and her daughter, Kim, who is a waste of life because she is so lazy has marital difficulties with Brett, her husband and his beloved dog, Cujo. I just feel like telling Brett to keep the dog and dump the wife who does nothing but complain, order her husband around, smoke, eat, and belittle her second best friend, Sharon, played beautifully by Magda Szubanski who is an overweight but cheerful and athletic character. Every episode starts off playing the Joker with the cast. The show does not have an audience and is filmed on location in Melbourne, Australia. The first season concludes with Kath finally remarrying to Kel Knight but it's a wedding of disastrous proportions. The second season begins with Kim trying to get pregnant (oh vey! because the girl can barely handle herself, Cujo or Brett) but I'm enjoying each episode because they are just beautifully crafted and executed. I know that I bought Region 2 and can only see it in London and Europe but I'm taking it home to America and find a way to see this show. I wished the PBS stations in America would regularly broadcast this show like they do most British shows. I keep waiting for the next season.",1186272000,7,1537,4.633699633699634
8208564,5,B000TBW5SK,"This is the smartest show to come out of Australia, much in the realm of Britain's Absolutely Fabulous and Brittas Empire.  It plays on the Sundance channel occasionally.  If you get the chance, you really should watch.  It is a mother-daughter team of misfits.  I only wish this set were available in the US format, I would buy it instantly.  I can only say that I recommend this HIGHLY.",1184544000,5,388,4.565217391304348
