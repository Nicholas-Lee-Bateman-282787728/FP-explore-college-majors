2043453,5,B0001Z3IK8,"I saw Hells Angels 69 when it came out. I was 13 and it was the first biker movie I ever saw. I have seen many since that time and there is no doubt in my mind that this is the best one made. This is a true biker flick, not some stupid poser garbage like Easy Rider. Easy Rider is just the lame story of two punks .They aren't bikers, just hippies on two wheels. Sonny Barger,former President of the Oakland chapter of the Hells Angels who was in HA 69, described Peter Fonda best when he said Fonda was a graduate of Chicken Sh_t High School. Although the acting is not great you get a feeling for how the Club actually was in those days. As a side note, Terry the Tramp and Magoo, two members of the Oakland chapter that are featured in the film, died shortly after the film was made. The Hells Angel lifestyle demands a lot and these two paid the price. The bikes and the locations make the film all the more real. The club house shown at the start of the film was the actual one for the Daly City chapter. This is the real thing. The other film in this set is so bad that it isn't worth the effort to watch it.",1055289600,24,1114,4.0225225225225225
2043454,5,B0001Z3IK8,"""The Losers"" was a great Drive-In movie from 1970. With actor William Smith leading his band of bikers into Cambodia to rescue
a CIA spy. The opening sequence is awesome, yet sad. The slow motion and special effects created by Director Joe Solemon are one of the best war sequences shot as well as the battle to rescue the CIA agent. The bikers do what bikers do best, party, drink, love and kick some ...They take there motorcycles and add some mean weapons to them. They also create a awesome 3-wheeler with cannon fire. This was the first war movie to bravely attempt to show a little of what it maybe be like in Viet Nam, as it was released in 1970 and our Armed Forces were still very much in Viet Nam. This movie is a classic. For the year 1970 it opened my eyes to the horrors of war and the bravery of our Amercian soldiers, whether they were military or just good-ole free loving, hell raising bikers.. Sit back and enjoy and remember the year this was released and you'll enjoy it alot better..",1016323200,4,1004,4.374331550802139
2043455,3,B0001Z3IK8,"I first saw this cheesey B flick back in '69 or '70, back when movies like this were en vougue. Think about it.  The CIA recruits a misfit group of Hells Angel types to rescue and return a US presidential advisor from behind enemy lines in Viet Nam.  So, here come these booze drinking, pot smoking, verile heroes to the rescue.  And what fun it is!  Keep in mind, American GI's are not allowed to step foot where this hostage advisor is being held, but bikers are.  They party hard before the battle, do lots of local women, retro-fit their choppers and off they go.  What ensues is pure fictional hocum.  Lots of slo-mo action with a cool 70's style score.  A great nostalgic fix for fans of this genre.
Don't worry about the intricasies of the plot and story-line here.  Just sit back and enjoy.  I did.",1009152000,3,806,4.385135135135135
2043456,3,B0001Z3IK8,"I know that most Americans find it hard to laugh at what happened in Vietnam but this film is so over the top, but hugely enjoyable, that it may shed things in a different light.  the film has to be taken with a huge pinch of salt, but if you can take the First Blood/Rambo films along with anything with Chuck Norris in it then this will come across as totally believable.  I first saw this film in 1970 or around that time in a cinema in Barrhead (near Glasgow) when it was a B film showing with a Dracula movie with my mate Kenny and we sat in and watched it again and again (we went to this particular cinema because they let anyone in who had long trousers on and as it was an X certificate (18)in Scotland it was the only place we could get in.  The story is about a load of Hells Angels who end up in Nam with their bikes and the stunts are brilliant so who cares about the plot.  It boasts one of the best songs I have ever heard for a sound track.  So folks buy it, suspend belief and sit back and have a laugh.",979171200,5,1020,3.9560975609756097

2043510,4,B0001Z3IK8,"Has Sonny Barger one of the best known of the Hell's Angels from the 60s & 70s.  Founding member & one time President of the Oakland chapter.  He was there all through the 60s partying with the hippies, he was at Altamont, Hunter S Thompson wrote a lot about him in his book about the Angels.  His autobiography is great, ""Hell's Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club, Freedom: Credos from the Road, Dead in 5 Heartbeats, and 6 Chambers, 1 Bullet"".  This guy lived (just look how the title of his autobiography is).  Now he's Lenny The Pimp on Sons of Anarchy.

Movie plot was good with a nice 70s ending (more real than happily ever after). I guess everyone got what they thought they wanted in the end though.  The 4 stars are for casting, settings & the plot.  Not crazy exciting or good acting or things that make a modern movie great.  But if you like biker movies...

Filming real live Hells Angels -- Sonny Barger, Terry the Tramp, Tiny, etc. -- gives this movie authenticity not found in other biker movies.

2043533,3,B0001Z3IK8,"Mind you I have no 1st hand experience with motorcycle games; so, this review is merely my opinion.  After reading a few books about infiltrations into ""outlaw"" motorcycle clubs by various law enforcement agencies and Sony Barger's own autobiography, 'Hell's Angel', I starting searching the internet for DVD's on the subject.  Most motorcycle movies were really corny, poor plot lines and little motorcycle footage.  I ordered this movie based on the information that Sonny Barger and a few of his Hell's Angels were appearing in it.  The DVD cover really gave me doubts; however, the film itself isn't bad.  There actually is a story line and some decent biking footage.  It seems to portray the Hell's Angels as a carefree, if not careless, group of free wheeling bikers and babes with no sense of responsibility for anything but themselves and their freinds.  It does not delve into the Hell's Angels organization or it's means of supporting itself.  This is fair enough since that's not part of the story.  You get some good looks at real Hell's Angels.  Although they are definitely not the kind of crowd with whom I'd care to associate, the film does imbue Sonny and his club members with a certain character and loyalty.  It is worth watching and I suspect I'll watch it a couple more times in the future.",1276992000,,1313,4.816964285714286

Hell's bloody devil's is literally one of the worst biker films ever made if you want to even call it a biker film.  the bikers in the film are hardly in it and have nothing to do with the story...It's some wanna-be James Bond rip-off only it sucks.  Hell's angels 69 was actually a good movie.  I enjoyed that one.  It had a plot and a cool ending.  I haven't seen run angel run yet so i can't say much about that one.  The stand out film on this collection is hell's angels 69 though.  I wouldn't buy this set only because hell's bloody devils cross-contaminated the other movies...Just buy hell's angels 69 it seperately.,1275091200,,678,4.325396825396825

I was hoping for a gritty film about the motorocycle life style, what I got instead was a bunch of clowns somewhere between the bowery boys and the 3 Stooges mugging for the camera and trying to act cool. Basically the Hells Angels look like a bunch of high school delinquents in this film - I was expecting one of them to put a cherry bomb in a toilet next. And Sonny Barger - what a goof ball. The movie is entertaining for a laugh at how bad it is and how juvenile the bikers behave trying to act tough.

It is a notch above the standard biker movie. The real angels are actually better actors than most of the real stars in these movies. The video image on this film is quite good and the sound isn't bad. I enjoyed the feature with Conny Van Dyke recalling her memories of the angels. It gave me a different insight to these guys.

It was a little mellow and they party much harder than this depicts.

Sonny Barger, President, Terry the Tramp, Magoo and Cisco, all of the Oakland chapter, and familiar to anyone who has read any of the books about the history of the Angels, are featured heavily here with dialogue and close ups and everything. Terry being the stand out.

The motorcycles range from rather stock late sixties Harleys to a custom built chopper reportedly built by Sonny specially for the film. But these bikes are only featured in the first two thirds of the picture- the final chase scene through the desert has almost the entire cast riding dirt bikes.

Overall an interesting if not great film, just to see the famous Angels, the basis for so many of the genres offerings, in the flesh so to speak.",1142467200,7,951,4.485549132947977

2043575,4,B0001Z3IK8,"Believe it or not, Hell's Angels 69, released at the tail end of the `biker' genre, was not the first film to feature the Angels (that credit goes to the 1967 film Hells Angels on Wheels), but, it was the first film where the boys actually got speaking parts.  Co-written by Jeremy Slade (who also co-stars) and Tom Stern (who also co-stars and produced the movie), with the screenplay by Don Tait (Chrome and Hot Leather, The Apple Dumpling Gang, Herbie Goes Bananas), and directed by Lee Madden (Angel Unchained, The Manhandlers), the movie features Conny Van Dyke (W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings), who, along with appearing on numerous television game shows throughout the 70s was also Motown's first, white recording artist,  G.D. Spradlin (The Godfather: Part II, Apocalypse Now, Ed Wood), along with a slew of real life Hell's Angels including Charles `Magoo' Tinsley, John `Terry the Tramp' Tracy, Tiny Walters, Clifford `Skip' Workman, and Ralph 'Sonny' Barger, also known as the Godfather of the Hells Angels and the most famous outlaw Biker in the world.

As the movie begins we're in Los Angeles, at a real swinging party, a happening shindig hosted by two seemingly well-to-do brothers Wes (Slate) and Chuck (Stern), in a groovy apartment complete with wall to wall pink shag carpeting...zowie!  The boys talk briefly about some plan, and then cut out early arriving at a posh house in the hills.  The next morning we see the two leaving, dressed as bikers, driving a pair of choppers (motorcycles).  They ride out into the country and stake out the Hell's Angels (the Oakland chapter, to be specific), eventually weaseling their way into hanging out with the club.  The pair participate in various club activities like drinking beer, riding around recklessly, drinking beer, terrorizing a small town, drinking beer, brawling with each other, drinking beer and so on...did I mention they drink beer?  Also, Chuck buys Betsy (Van Dyke), a tag along bimbette of the club, for a pack of smokes (I wonder what he could've gotten for a carton).  Anyway, after Wes and Chuck get a serious beat down from the bikers (I thought it was an initiation of sorts, but this wasn't the case), they hear the Angels are planning on a road trip, to which Wes and Chuck suggest Las Vegas as a destination, as that's where the action is...or, at least the action as far as their plans go.  Turns out Wes and Chuck have designs on robbing one of the casinos, and are planning on using the Angels as part of a diversionary tactic.  The group does go to Las Vegas, the brothers manage the heist and get subsequently get away, trading in their choppers for dirt bikes and fleeing across the desert.  The Angels, learning of the ruse, are hot on the heels of the deceptive duo and it's not to congratulate them for their recent successes...

Okay, first off I want to mention that there is no huge Las Vegas riot scene in this film, despite the fact that on the front of the DVD case it states ""This was the RUMBLE that ROCKED Las Vegas!"".  This was a little disappointing to me, I was really looking forward to some serious bone snapping, head cracking, blood spilling action as the cops and the bikers participated in an all out battle royale.  There is a showdown of sorts, but it ends all rather amicably, and without much fuss.  One of the most interesting aspects of the film for me was when the group was cruising the Las Vegas Strip, and seeing how relatively quaint the Las Vegas Strip was compared to today (Caesar's Palace was miniscule to its current form).  As far as the acting goes, the `professional' performers did all right (none of them broke a sweat, but the material was very simplistic), while Sonny and his club members, while not professional actors, did well enough, and besides, these aren't the kind of guys I'd think would stand around while the director took take after take after take trying to get the shot right.  As far as the story goes this wasn't the best biker movie I've ever saw, but it was far from the worst.  At the very least it was kept relatively straightforward.  Having real life Hell's Angels present certainly provided a sense of authenticity, and the film does feature a lot of what one expect in a flick like this in the four B's...bikes, boozing, brawling, broads (a bit skimpy on this last one, though).  The whole subplot with Van Dyke's character realizing there's more to life than being the property of a biker club seemed awkward at times, and near the end it really dragged on the film as her newfound outlook on life leads to complications between Wes and Chuck, but other than that, the story moved along at a decent pace.  The stunts were well done, and the fight scenes felt very real which made me wonder if any of it was staged, or if the guys were just cut loose to go at each other.  The funniest scene in the film was when Chuck and Wes changed from their biker outfits into suits and really phony looking wigs, prior to robbing the casino.  Had I been on the scene when this happened, and the police later questioned me as to if I saw anything strange or unusual, I would have responded, ""What, besides the two guys with really bad crew cut wigs?""  All in all an interesting film that plods along at times, and features an ending you might not expect, but one should keep in mind the Hell's Angels had a stipulation in that while they could be depicted as being fooled in the movie, they ultimately had to have the last word.

Media Blasters provides a good looking, fullscreen (1.33:1) picture on this DVD, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 audio comes through clean enough.  There are a number of special features including a original trailer for the film, an intro by Joe Bob Briggs, a featurette titled `Conny Van Dyke: Message to Her Fans' (9:30), a Connie Van Dyke photo gallery, liner notes and movie info print on the DVD booklet insert, and a commentary track featuring Joe Bob Briggs.  Also included are trailers for other Media Blaster DVD releases like Blood Shack (1971), Hell High (1989), Samurai Cop (1989), and The Hollywood Strangler (1979).  The movie itself rates three stars, while Joe Bob Brigg's commentary track earns this release an extra star.  That man sure knows his cinematic crud.

If I learned anything from this film it's not to cross the Hell's Angels...they seem reluctant to forgive and forget...and a pack of cigarettes goes far in biker clubs.",1131926400,18,6440,4.676705048715678
2043576,5,B0001Z3IK8,"Yes, part of this movie was filmed in old downtown Mountain View, California, as well as pre-updated Las Vegas Strip.  It is a must-have for collectors of kitschy Hells Angels paraphanalia.  Sonny's even in it!",1104192000,7,210,4.9714285714285715
2043577,4,B0001Z3IK8,"Most people with common sense know they're not watching this for groundbreaking cinema before they watch it. But anyone with a remote interest in bikes or the counter-culture will find this an enjoyable movie. It does not build character depth for every member of the Angels because its not a movie based on an AA meeting, but does focus on two protagonists, two antagonists (Sonny Barger and Terry the Tramp), and the damsel in distress. It has a plot that builds and keeps suspense, along with giving a peep-show into what the Angels scene was back in '69 (keep in mind they used the original Oakland chapter of the Hells Angels to portray themselves in this film and i doubt they spent too much time in rehearsal and in the make-up chair). The ending is esoteric in nature as was every other movie in this genre in this era (i.e Easy Rider, Vanishing Point, Two-Lane Blacktop), but it does not end with a tickle-fight. So if you're remotely interested in the genre or a mototrcycle enthusiast, this movie will not dissapoint.",1092009600,13,1028,4.685082872928176
2043578,2,B0001Z3IK8,"Hell's Angels 69 is essentially a stereotypical caper movie in which a couple of protagonists try to pull off a heist but things go seriously wrong.  Only in this case the main mistake they make is upsetting members of the Hells Angels.  Using real bikers, this film had great potential, but it fails on all counts.

Hell's Angels TRIES to be a deeply serious film, but unlike artistically good caper films (e.g. The Asphalt Jungle or The Killing) all the characters are one-dimensional and absolutely nobody is in the least bit likeable, nor are any insights provided.  And because it tries so hard to be serious and weighty, the film commits the even worse crime of being no fun at all.  It doesn't even work as an unintentional comedy.  In other words, Hell's Angels 69 is nothing more than a dreary, pretentious, existentialist film about the dangers of greed and hubris.  NOT a good adventure film or biker flick.  Get Wild Angels (which manages to be both fun and dramatic) instead.",1090540800,3,988,4.7368421052631575

To see the actual real Hells Angels instead of some lame actors playing their own parts is cool. Sonny Barger,Magoo,Terry the Tramp,Skip and Tiny and Angel pretty much play their parts well. Kind of an inside look at the club which is cool. The story is quite far fetched but fun. Sadly,Terry died soon after along with Magoo and Tiny vanished.
