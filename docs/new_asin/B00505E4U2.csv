8450690,2,B00505E4U2,"I found this to be an absolute beginner DVD. He shows a couple of the most simple chord progressions and then shows some minor scales to solo over them in the style of Carlos Santana. What I found to be the most disturbing was that the instructor is playing a Telecaster through a Fender amp. Really? Is that the best effort you could put into the ""sound"". Carlos plays a PRS through a Mesa Boogie. He used SG's in the earlier albums but always plays with humbucking pick ups for that smoother warm sound. A Telecaster is a twangy country clean sound. At a minumum he could have borrowed one. This is one of my peeves because you see others do it too. They use the master's name and then solo over a backing track in his ""style"". If you are a beginner you'll be fine, but he's not doing anything you can't find on u-tube for free.",1339372800,4,830,4.2594936708860756
8450691,5,B00505E4U2,"Max Milligan gives a great interpretation of the playing style of Santana. As a guitar teacher myself, I found the material on this DVD invaluable in conveying this style of play to my students. Max himself, who has several other ""Play In The Style Of"" instructional DVD's available, has a unique style of teaching which inspires confidence to the budding guitar student, myself included. Definitely five star rating!!",1328745600,5,418,5.161764705882353
