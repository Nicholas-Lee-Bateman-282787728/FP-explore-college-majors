8472807,5,B0028N1FHE,"This DVD really knocked me out. It's a truly behind-the secenes documentary of some of the best drummers in Guinea. Loved seeing all the instruments and legendary djembe players in it's original setting. This is great for teachers who want to learn more about the culture, the context, and the heartland of the djembe. Best thing next to hopping on a plane!",1286755200,3,357,4.774193548387097
