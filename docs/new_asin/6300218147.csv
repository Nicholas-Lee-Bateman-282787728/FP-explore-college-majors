7806331,5,6300218147,"I caught this on TV Land a while back and was quite suprised to see a  young Michael Keaton and James Balushi in a comedy series! I thought the  show was really cool! It was also good to see 2 up and comers at the start  of their careers. I would recommend this to anyone that loves comedy. I  would even show it to people that want to know about the early career of  the lead stars. Makes me think of ""Busom Buddies"" with Tom Hanks.  This show was better though. Michael Keaton was a  real cutie too!",965606400,,501,4.051020408163265
