7830073,5,6302707722,"I was surprised to see the information wrong here. Lethal Lolita, which, imo, is the best of the Amy Fisher films, stars Noelle Parker as Amy Fisher, and of the three actresses who played Amy in each of the three films, Parker gave the best depiction of a Long Island teenager (I lived on Long Island for many years, in a town not far from where the Buttafuoccos had their body shop.)
When this case was still in the news, I followed it case closely, and like a lot of other people then, saw all three films. This seemed to be the most believable. Parker is great, and so is Ed Molinaro.",1203897600,,587,4.25
