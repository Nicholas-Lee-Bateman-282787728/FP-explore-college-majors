8544246,4,B009THCK6M,"I grew up in the San Fernando Valley. I actually met Roy and his family. They were all wonderful people. I was a bullwhip champion in my younger years and some people even called me ""Cowboy Chris"". If you are looking for good clean family entertainment, then I suggest that you buy as many ""old time"" Westerns as you can before they are no longer in print. This is an old movie but it has been cleaned up rather well. I enjoyed watching it. It made a good addition to my collection.",1396051200,4,482,4.25
