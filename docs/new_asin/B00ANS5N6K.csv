He also explains that accounting plays a big part and also how to look at what the future might be for a company before you think about buying it.",1356998400,,246,4.040816326530612
8554872,5,B00ANS5N6K,"I have read many value investing books and I can't believe that Mr. Skonieczny is the first person who came up with the idea of teaching value investing by making videos. It is so nice to learn how to value companies by following someone on the computer and seeing the person use the financial statements of real companies to come up with various value calculations.
I really like the idea of valuing a company by using more than one method of valuation and then comparing your range of results to what the market is willing to sell the company for. Another neat thing I liked about this video is that the valuation templates that he uses in the video, you can download them from his website and use it yourself.",1355702400,,712,4.484615384615385
8554873,5,B00ANS5N6K,"Valuing companies is challenging to all of us.  What I really like about this video is that I learned various different valuation techniques. Sometimes one valuation method needs to be used and at other times another method is more appropriate.  Also, I heard many times how free cash flow is a better profitability measure than net income.  I think this video makes the distinction crystal clear, and I know to never forget to calculate companies' free cash flow (the video shows the calculation step by step) when making an investment decision.",1355443200,,546,4.978021978021978
