5070280,1,B0079T9CPO,"The people who did this video did a very poor job with the editing, audio, and content.

Watching this production is an extremely boring and frustrating waste of time unless you enjoy watching people dressed in cammo gear standing around trying to figure out how to operate, place, and retrieve their camera equipment. That is all this video is about, and very poorly done at that.

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!

I can't believe Amazon charges money for this.
I'm pissed that I got suckered into paying a buck 99 for this worthless production.",1353888000,2,547,4.7368421052631575
5070281,1,B0079T9CPO,"i have watched and purchased countless bigfoot documentaries.  this is by far the worst one ever.  first the audio quality was terrible.  then they offered no re-enactments or real eye witness accounts.  lastly, they showed ONE questionable photo which looked like a black blob in the woods.  no videos of the creature or suspected creature either.  the dvd basically has a few men mumbling about how they will set up cameras and use night vision.  oh they did show the same photos/video of deer and other wildlife...wow!  do not waste your money.  extremely disappointed!",1345939200,3,572,5.0
5070282,1,B0079T9CPO,"Although I believe the majority of the cast are truly trying to find Sasquatch, I thought the video as a whole was very poor. The music was so loud I had to turn the volume way down while the narrating was so faint I had to turn it way up. They spent more time explaining the equipment they were going to use then anything else. At the end, it states ""to be continued"". I wouldn't watch any continuation if you paid me. The only thing it had going for it was some of the music was kind of nice, and of course, the few actual shots of the forest were beautiful.",1345680000,10,560,4.054054054054054
8513017,3,B0079T9CPO,To me this was disappointing Just home videos of guys putting up camera traps,1502755200,,77,4.571428571428571
8513018,1,B0079T9CPO,Don't have this or watched it,1413244800,,29,4.0
8513019,1,B0079T9CPO,I hate having to even give this dvd one star.  It is horrible and is a total waste of money. I could make a more interesting dvd in the small patch of woods next to my house.  Save your money and don't buy any of these tracking or research center dvds.  I am terribly disappointed.,1406332800,,281,4.072727272727272
8513020,1,B0079T9CPO,"Very amateurish.  This shouldn't even be offered on Instant Video.  Amazon, would it be possible to get my money back?",1391817600,,118,4.85
8513021,2,B0079T9CPO,"This film wasn't what I expected.  I had problems with the DVD, so I returned it.  The return process and quick refund was processed accordingly.",1376524800,,145,4.76
8513022,1,B0079T9CPO,"The person that writes the 5 star reviews for the DVDs in the series (Western Tracker) is also the person that is in the DVDs (Andrew Peterson) and produces them. Nice that you rate your projects as 5 Stars and write them as if you are a viewer.

If you want to see aimless wandering in the forest and a showcase for the equipment used, these DVDs are for you. You will not see evidence or anything other than ""Did you hear that? It's a sasquatch"" type of scenes, then this redundant series is for you.",1375401600,,502,4.229166666666667
8513023,2,B0079T9CPO,I have dozens of Bigfoot dvd's.  This one was packaged very nicely but it is as 'homemade' as it gets.  The sound quality is very poor.  It is squatchers recording squatchers.  A lot of talking.  Nothing much  compelling.  I appreciate the work that goes into the search and hobby but it was a bit tedious to sit through.,1362268800,,321,4.431034482758621
8513024,4,B0079T9CPO,Our school has a Search for Sasquatch club. While the club is mostly in fun and for socializing the club wants to add validity to their purpose and seek out the scientific side of the club. This book was purchased to look at the possibilities of Sasquatch and this with other sources is being studied to help with our research.,1357603200,,327,4.466666666666667
8513025,3,B0079T9CPO,"It has some good points, and the scenery is great, but the pace is slower than others I have seen.",1357257600,2,98,3.95
8513026,1,B0079T9CPO,"I wish I could rate this as a quarter of a star.  It was horrible, boring, hard to watch, and non informative.  The voices are so low that you  have to turn the volume up and then the music is so loud (sounds like bad porn music) that you have to turn the volume back down.  I never give bad reviews, but this video is a waste of time, I'm glad I rented it and did not waste my hard earned money to buy this waste of a dvd.",1356998400,3,423,3.7191011235955056
