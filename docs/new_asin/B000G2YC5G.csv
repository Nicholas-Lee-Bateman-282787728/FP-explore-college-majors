8128845,5,B000G2YC5G,"And I mean that in a good way! My 16-month-old son has been watching Braincandy for a long time (on Comcast On Demand), so glad to see they finally have DVDs out! The problem with the On Demand versions are that they are only 6-10 minutes long each- so I am also thrilled to see the DVDs are much longer. My son LOVES this series, and it is not creepy at all (as someone else on here has mentioned). Yes, the special effects are not stellar, but very young children are not going to notice or care about that. We also tried Baby Einstein and my son was not interested at all. I think this is a FABULOUS series for toddlers!!!!!",1191888000,,627,4.190082644628099
8128846,5,B000G2YC5G,My 2 year old son Matt LOVES this DVD. He is constantly asking for it. It is really cute and the puppets are engaging and really keep your kid entertained. He has learned so much from watching this video and his speech development has increased dramatically since he started watching it also which is a bonus. I highly recommend this dvd.,1172620800,2,338,4.557377049180328
8128847,1,B000G2YC5G,This entire line of video are awful.  They are so poorly made and produced and the 'storyline' is so random and hard to follow.  Our daughter wsa bored with it after just a few minutes.  They movie itself is creepy too - doesn't seem appropriate for kids at all.,1171411200,,262,4.3061224489795915
8128848,5,B000G2YC5G,"My 15 month old absolutely loved the first Braincandy so it was an easy decision to let her watch this DVD.  She dances around, touches her eyes (and ours!), points to the screen and chats away, etc.  It's fun to see how engaged she gets.  I feel much better about letting her watch this than cartoons or other DVDs that she zones out to and doesn't learn from.  Bravo to the Braincandy founders - the Baby Einstein DVDs were just not working for us.  We're delighted this series is on the market and look forward to additional releases.  I highly recommend this product.",1159488000,2,571,4.495145631067961
