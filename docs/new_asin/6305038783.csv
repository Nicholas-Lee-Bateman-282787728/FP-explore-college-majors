7881441,4,6305038783,"""The Clockmaker"" turned out to be an interesting movie despite some annoying distractions.  It impressed me as the story of a man who had led a casual life and realized, almost too late, what he had missed out on.  His quiet, non-intrusive life was interupted one day when he finds that his son is accused of murder and is on the run.  The movie follows the father as he gradually becomes more and more involved with the issues surrounding the murder, the policeman who is in charge of the investigation, and the need to understand who this son of his really is.  I really enjoyed the way the subtle yet continuous changes emerged in the father.  He slowly loses his ""whatever"" outlook and apolitical attitude.  While he changes from someone we like into someone we're not sure of, we realize it's because of his need to better understand his son.  Although there really aren't any surprises, I'll leave it at that rather than risk saying too much.

My objection to ""The Clockmaker"" is that it is described as a thriller.  On a Hitchcock standard, ""The Clockmaker"" would be the equivilent of ""The Wrong Man"".  If you haven't seen that one, you may have a long wait to do so.  It, too, had the expectation of a thriller by virtue of the director and was never really appreciated as the psychological study it was.  My other objection is the attempt at involving politics in the story.  The effort was lame and the effect was a distraction.  I came away with no real understanding of the issues (other than Owner vs. Worker 101).  The issue would pop up unnecessarily and too often; all the more reason that the father is the only true focus of the movie.",1210204800,,1653,4.555932203389831

Loosely based on Georges Simenon's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-watchmaker-of-Everton/dp/0856174556/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The watchmaker of Everton</a>, THE CLOCKMAKER was co-written and directed by Bertrand Tavernier. Earned the 1973 Louis Delluc Prize and two awards during the 1974 Berlin International Film Festival. The son of an ordinary French clockmaker commits murder. His father tries to understand why. Not bad but more a social study than an investigation movie. Hence, one can be annoyed by the numerous references to the French social climate of the early seventies.",1196640000,,645,6.878048780487805
7881443,5,6305038783,"Since his son is arrested due a political murder, his father-a watchmaker who lives in Lyon is mortified to learn this awful new.

He will employ all the tools ofhis office to analyze, scrutinize and inspect all the related issues of this political murder. This was the first feature film of this famous French director.

Overwhelming acting of Noiret,as always. A slow paced film which will reward you!",1109980800,,403,4.911764705882353
7881444,3,6305038783,"i saw this film as a simple, if somewhat homoerotic love story, between a lonely father and a sympathetic police officer. reading the two other reviews up here i realize that perhaps i was wrong. the film features good acting by phillipe noiret as the father (although a cynic would argue that his sad-eyes did all the work.) the moral of the film is that that acts of violence against deserving bad guys can, if executed correctly, help repair strained father-son relationships. hey bertrand, we already saw indiana jones and the last crusade. NEXT!",1109808000,,550,4.861702127659575
7881445,5,6305038783,"Noiret is superb in the role of a (single) father who quietly works towards reconciliation with his son, after adolescence and differences in their characters have put distance between them, when the son is charged  with murder of a factory worker. Rochefort's (the cop) performance  complements Noiret's. The main theme, exquisitely developed, is the  challenge of authenticity in the love between parents and children;  political alienation of the French working class people in the last days of  DeGaulle is the (perhaps allegoric) secondary theme.",959558400,5,551,5.511904761904762
