8070638,3,B0009YVCHC,"Dark Planet: Visions of America, released in 2005 by Illuminati Pictures, portrays four music subcultures, three of which are directly interrelated, as they are lived on the streets of the contemporary United States. In the process, these subcultures - skinhead, straightedge, black metal, and zealot - are grossly exaggerated in their importance and obscured in their variety.  However, Visions of America is both informative and imaginatively compiled.  It should not be taken as an authority on these four subcultures, but as a starting point for further study.

The creators of Dark Planet: Visions of America succinctly summarize their documentary thesis in three phrases: ""12 cities. 4 armies. 1 future.""  It is their contention that these four subcultures, each of which probably has no more than a few thousand followers in the entire United States, represent four possible futures.  The documentary ends with an invitation to choose which subculture you would rather see come out on top, as though there are no other options.

I see this as the first and most glaring flaw in the documentary.  As a person who is sympathetic to the black metal subculture, I am nevertheless forced to admit that its listeners alone, not to mention those willing to go to the extremes presented in the documentary, are pitifully few in number.  I am prepared to bet that the same goes for each of the other subcultures as well.  Let's be honest; none of these represent any threat to mainstream culture at the present time.

Furthermore, Visions of America should have been more forthcoming with its biases.  For instance, the director, Jason Mitchell, is a former straightedger, and his wife, D.J. Dolce, is one of those interviewed for the zealot segment.  Both subcultures are portrayed very sympathetically.  The zealot segment even contains a dreamy music montage featuring clips of how happy and charitable its adherents are.

I also take issue with the skinhead and black metal segments.  Most of the skinhead segment is devoted to ""debunking"" the popular notion that skinheads are racist.  Instead of focusing on white power skinheads as belonging to a subset of skinheadism in general, they are simply dismissed.  Ian Stewart, if he were still alive, would probably be surprised to hear that he had to retire his Doc Martins. The black metal segment contained the only professional social critic in the entire film, who spouted the usual rhetoric about Satanism in American society, while the subculture itself was linked through associative imagery to all kinds of social destruction.  For a fairer, though more succinct treatment of black metal, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Metal-A-Headbanger-s-Journey/dp/B000EGEJIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Metal - A Headbanger's Journey</a>.

In the end, Dark Planet: Visions of America was informative and entertaining, but suffered from many flaws.",1216080000,2,2955,5.469162995594714
8070639,3,B0009YVCHC,"This movie is not a teenage celebration of these genres, but an attempt to explain why they came about, namely what they think is wrong with society and how they hope to fix it. Its strengths are its structure and clarity; its weakness is the tedious nature of most people and subgenres. The Christians come out looking the best, with the black metallers following. I like (some) black metal, (some) hardcore and am not a Christian except in the Schopenhauerian sense of spiritual ""quietude,"" however, I was impressed with the filmmaking and topic study of the independent underground documentary.",1124755200,2,597,5.040404040404041
