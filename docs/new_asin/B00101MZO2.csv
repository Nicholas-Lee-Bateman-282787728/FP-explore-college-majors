8236496,1,B00101MZO2,Was more like a shopping list than a walk through of the brewing process.  Also looked a bit like a home movie.,1444262400,,111,4.045454545454546
8236497,4,B00101MZO2,"for anyone starting out with brewing their own beer for the first time, this is a great dvd.  they walk you through the process step by step with easy to understand instructions.  i've been brewing now for almost a year and every batch has been very rewarding and tasty.",1252281600,2,270,4.489795918367347
8236498,2,B00101MZO2,"The DVD was fine, but for the same price you can get quite a bit more information for any number of books (""How to Brew"", ""Radical Brewing"", etc.). I'd strongly urge that you pass on this DVD and pick up a solid book for reference instead. Everyone involved in the making of this video is very intelligent about brewing, but isn't nearly as informing as you'd like it to be.",1250812800,,374,4.357142857142857
8236499,5,B00101MZO2,"This dvd is like having three dvds in one. You learn how to brew
with single stage, two stage and a conical. I actually found it to be a
great visual companion to a couple brewing books I picked up. I fully
recommend it.",1206403200,3,220,4.0227272727272725
8236500,5,B00101MZO2,"This video is great.  Not only does it break down all the aspects of brewing, but with it's customizable playback; I can use it as the perfect reference for the brewing equipment I have now and as well as any equipment upgrades and additions I make in the  future.  It explains as well as illustrates the brewing process from start to finish.  It provides a list of equipment that is required to brew as well as things that may make the process easier or more ""technical"".  It also provides great background information on the main ingredients of beer.  This is a great buy for anyone looking  to begin brewing beer or if you are already a brewer, it provides itself as a great reference and may help assist you in greater brewing adventures.  Excellent product!",1204329600,2,762,4.592592592592593
8236501,5,B00101MZO2,"I've dabbled in home brewing for years.  I decided on a whim to pick this up, and was pleasantly surprised.  The unique menu system and series of videos tailor the instructions to your equipment. Now I finally know what a conical fermenter really is, and how to properly use it.

I've since passed the DVD on to a friend who wanted to learn to brew.  Based on the video, he successfully created his first Ale with no prior experience.

It's a good investment for beginners and the occasional brewer.",1204156800,3,499,4.561797752808989
8236502,5,B00101MZO2,"I've been listening to the Brewium.com podcast and floating around their
website for a couple of months now and was looking forward to this DVD.
Easy to navigate the menu.  Lessons are broken down in an easy-to-follow
format.  Made a great beer and learned a lot.

Cheers.",1196294400,2,272,4.74468085106383
8236503,5,B00101MZO2,"I've listened to their podcast for a while and when I saw these guys finally put out their DVD I snatched it up.  It breaks down the home brewing process into easy to follow, step by step instruction.  The way it lets you pick your equipment is nice, by playing around with it a little I found a couple items that would really help make my beer better.",1196294400,,352,4.161764705882353
