571667,4,6303145906,"About half of the 2nd Doctor's stories are still missing so I will take basically any of his stories that are available.  The Krotons is a decent if not very original adventure.  Aliens land on planet and over time take over and rule the native people.  The Krotons take the smartest people and drain their life force.  The Doctor, Jamie and Zoe arrive and soon figure out what is going on and deal with it.  The idea of the Krotons not being carbon-based lifeforms is pretty interesting, otherwise this plotline has been done before on Who.
Other pluses about this story is that the Doctor and Zoe get to show off their intelligence.  Zoe spends the entire story in a nice miniskirt.  Jamie provides some humorous moments when he is on his own with the native humans, helping them.
The story just seems to be missing something extra to make it special.
As for the DVD itself, the picture and audio quality are excellent, and it has some nice extras.  There is an interesting documentary detailing how Troughton got the role, and the behind-the-scenes details about the producers, writers, and scripts.  It also has a short interview with Fraser Hines who played Jamie.  I have not listened to the commentary yet, but I notice that Hines and Wendy Padbury (Zoe) are not on it, a little disappointing.
I still hope the BBC tracks down the rest of Troughton's stories, especially The Power of the Daleks, The Highlanders, The Web of Fear, well basically all of them.  With renewed interest in the show since its return in 2005, hopefully this will happen.
As for The Krotons, if you like 60s Who or the 2nd Doctor, you might want to pick this one up.",1343433600,,1648,4.609589041095891
571668,4,6303145906,"Not exactly the most fondly remembered Dr Who story - by the production team, the actors or indeed the audience - one of the later Patrick Troughton stories gets it's long awaited DVD release, completing the catalogue of his complete adventures available in the archives. Only incomplete stories now remain to come. Whether or not you like the actual story is completely personal, but it's probably fair to say it's not as bad as reputation would have it. As always, the picture quality and remastering for the DVD has been improved to the point where it is probably better than the original broadcast was likely to have been, a questionable technique in itself. It's the 'extras' that usually make the Dr Who DVDs so compelling, even for the weaker adventures and this release is not an exception. There's a 50 minute retrospective of the entire Troughton era of the show, which for me is the best documentary I've seen on his tenure. It really is fascinating and reveals many things I'd never heard before, including the poor relationship between Troughton and producer Peter Bryant. For this inclusion alone, I'd highly recommend the disc. There's other stuff that's not quite so interesting, including yet another chance for Frazer Hines to trot out the same old anecdotes he's been peddling now for nearly 50 years. It's not his fault and he's an entertaining enough chap, but there comes a point where there is simply nothing left to be said that hasn't been said 100 times already. In the main documentary, Scarlet haired Deborah Watling does a stunning visual impression of Padmasambhva in her interview and again, trots out all the old anecdotes in her ridiculously theatrical manner, but likewise, if you've not seen these two go through their 'spontaneous' routine before, then you'll certainly enjoy seeing them here. For the die-hard fans, doubtless they'll be thrilled at another chance to hear it all again anyway. It's a good DVD, with excellent material and is highly recommended, despite the weak story itself. Up to you whether you want to buy it now or wait for the later ""Special Edition"" when Padmasambhva Watling will doubtless regale us all again with her stories of how Troughton was ""almost a second father"". Zzzzzzzz....",1342656000,,2247,4.962864721485412
571669,4,6303145906,"Pat Troughton is wonderful. Robert Holmes is wonderful. ""The Krotons,"" as a serial, is not. Season Six of Classic ""Who"" was notoriously uneven, even by Classic Who standards, and with dodgy monsters in mini-skirts, this 4-parter wasn't among the highlights. That said, if you give a monkey's uncle about Classic Who, or British television of the era, it's a fantastic find; The picture and sound quality are superb, given the source material, and the extras on the DVD are arguably THE best of any Troughton-era disc save for ""The War Games."" Specifically, the 52-minute documentary summarizing Troughton's era (1966-69) and some of the executive decisions that steered it, ""Second Time Around,"" is MANDATORY viewing for any Who fan -- classic or current, young or old.  And the feature on the affable Frazer Hines is, as expected, a riot -- especially the story about what he heard while hiding inside a Dalek casing during filming of ""The Evil of the Daleks.""  Sadly, the fanboy discussion of the Krotons themselves -- here titled ""The Doctor's Strange Love"" -- was a total waste of disc space; pity that segment wasn't used instead to focus on the story's author, Bob Holmes, as this was his first submission to ""Who,"" and he would, in short order, become one of the central figures that would loom over the next two decades of the program. Still, it's a minor quibble; by and large, the extras are pristine, highly re-watchable, and more than worth the purchase price.",1342224000,,1472,4.907630522088353
571670,5,6303145906,"But tin-can adversaries don't bother me - I am one of those who takes delight in cheesy sets, costumes and effects in  classic Dr. Who episodes. Of course, I love the professional effects in the new Dr. Who's, too. I guess I just love Dr. Who!

""The Krotons"", a black & white episode starring Patrick Troughton as the Doctor, first aired in 1968. The Krotons, as a race, have a complicated story. They are evolved from tellurium, a mildy toxic rare earth mineral on Earth, but common in the rest of the galaxy. [Sidebar: True fact - toxic levels of tellurium give humans garlic breath!] Kroton bodies are naturally brittle crystalline, but they can break down and reform to suit the environment. They also have the ability to transfer mental power into pure energy. In addition, they can hibernate in a crystalline slurry, which is their initial form on the unnamed planet where the action takes place.

I'll call it the Planet of the Gonds, for the Gonds are the humanoid natives of the planet on which the Doctor, Zoe and Jaime land. They leave the TARDIS to investigate; the Doctor using an umbrella to shade himself from the two suns beating down on the bleak inhospitable landscape. The travelers are dismayed by the Gond culture. The Krotons are unseen overlords, staying to their home, the Dynatrope. Gonds are kept in line by two methods. First, the Gonds are required to use the Teaching Machines, basically subliminal mind-control. Second, periodically, the two best and brightest of the Gonds must leave their families as tribute, to live in the Dynatrope as companions to the Krotons, never to be seen again.

Before they even know the whole story, the Doctor and Zoe witness the death of one of the latest tribute duo, and help the 2nd escape. Aha! The tribute has two purposes. One, the best of the Gond brains are drained of their mental powers to form energy for the Krotons, who need a massive amount of energy to reform and repair their crash-landed spaceship (the Dynatrope), and leave the planet. Secondly, by harvesting the brightest minds, it is easier to keep the Gonds in their primitive state. Or, as the Doctor says, their ""self-perpetuating slavery"".

The Doctor befriends a Gond scientist, and realizes that, in particular, the Gonds are not allowed to increase their knowledge of chemistry. Hmmm. So the Krotons are especially worried that the Gonds may put two and two chemically together. Now that gives him something to work on.

I love the back story of how the Krotons work and how they've used the Gonds for centuries. Shades of the Minotaur and Hunger Games and what else.

This is a review of the July 2012 DVD, which will be the first time ""The Krotons"" has been released on DVD. The release will be on a single disc of 91 minutes.

Extras:
1.  Audio commentary. Commentators include Philip Madoc (who played Eelek), Richard Ireson (played Axus), Gilbert Wynn (played Thara), David Tilley (assistant floor manager), Sylvia James (make-up designer), Bobi Bartlett (costume designer) and Brian Hodgson (special sounds designer). As with other recent DVD releases, the commentary is moderated by Toby Hadoke.
(Added after my DVD was received and watched:) Bobi Bartlett says that she used to go straight to the factory and buy big rolls of treated paper, which she used to make costumes. In this episode, Zoe's costume is a skirt and short jacket made of the disposable paper.
Also mentioned is that the Krotons deliberately spoke with South African accents, as a subtle political comment.
2.  ""Second Time Around: The Patrick Troughton Years"". This feature looks back on Troughton's Doctor Who.
(Added after DVD received:) This is a great feature. Commentators are Gerry Davis (story editor 1966-67), Anneke Wills (played Polly, companion), Robert Shearman (writer 2005), Innes Lloyd (producer), Gary Russell (script editor for BBC 2006-11), Christopher Barry (director ""The Power of the Daleks, the first Troughton serial), Frazer Hines (played companion Jamie), Deborah Watling (played Victoria, who replaced Polly as companion), Victor Pemberton (writer & script editor 1967-68), Derrick Sherwin (script editor & producer 1968-69), Terence Dicks (writer & scipt editor 1968-83), Wendy Padbury (played Zoe, companion after Victoria).
The feature starts with participants talking about the end of William Hartnell's Doctor. Hartnell was extremely popular, but his health wasn't that good and he needed to leave. Robert Shearman points out that nowdays, people expect the Who actor to change. But back in 1966, it was unheard of.
They didn't use the term regeneration, when they switched from Hartnell to Troughton, they just desperately had to think of something to allow the show to keep going.
Terence Dick says that ""The Krotons"" serial ""is not a bad show, except it had possibly the worst monster in the history of Dr. Who."" Though I do have other favorite lame bad guys, I have to admit that watching the Krotons move in the long shots is funny - the lower 1/3 of the costume is a fabric floor-length skirt. When the actors inside the Krotons walk, you can see their legs moving.
3.  ""Doctor Who Stories - Frazer Hines (Part One)"". This is from a 2003 interview with actor Frazer Hines, who plays the Doctor's companion Jamie McCrimmon. Hines talks about his time with Doctor Who.
(Added after DVD received:) Frazer also counts the Krotons as the worst Dr. Who monsters and says, ""We called them the Croutons, because they were square.""
Part Two of Frazer Hines appears as an extra on the 2013 DVD release of ""The Ice Warriors"".
Incidentally, the Doctor Who Stories have great shadow puppet show introductions - creative and fun to watch.
4.  ""The Doctor's Strange Love: The Krotons"". Joseph Lidster and Simon Guerrier, writers, look back on the Krotons. (They were not the writers for the episode.)

571671,4,6303145906,"The ying-yang like halves opening in the wall of the Gond people's teaching hall foreshadows a fight between good and bad.  Two students, Abu and Vana, have been given the highest honour, to become companions of the Krotons.  Yet Thara, the hot-headed son of Council leader Selris, adamantly tries to stop his girlfriend from going.  ""Why do we take their orders?  We don't even know if they exist.""
Landing on a rocky planet that ""looks dead, smells dead,"" the Doctor, Jamie, and Zoe, encounter a machine and rescue Vana from certain death from it.  Companions of the Krotons, huh?
When Selris learns the truth, the enormity of it sinks in.  ""The Krotons have been our benefactors. ... Our two best students join the Krotons.  They can't all have been murdered!""  He also fears that if other Gonds learn the truth, they will rise up against the Krotons, only to be slaughtered.  That is being planned under Selris's deputy Eelek.  Yet the Gonds' main problem is that they are dependent on the Krotons, especially the teaching machines.  Consider this exchange:
Doctor:  And everyone uses these machines?
Selris:  When they are young, yes.  That is the law.
Doctor:  Whose law, Selris?
Selris:  Our laws--the Gonds'.
Doctor:  But I thought you said all your law was given to you by the Krotons?
Selris:  Yes, all our science, all our culture, everything we have has come from the machines.
Doctor:  I see.  A sort of self-perpetuating slavery.
Things heat up, when in the course of their investigation, Zoe unwittingly submits herself to a Kroton teaching machine, reaches one of the highest scores ever, and is selected to become a companion for the Krotons.  The Doctor also takes the test to be with her.  There's humorous mention about Zoe's intelligence:  ""Yes, well, Zoe is something of a genius, of course.  It can be very irritating at times,"" to which she shows her cute smile and lets out a small laugh. In other words, a Hermione Granger nearly thirty years before Harry Potter.  Zoe later says cheekily, ""The Doctor is almost as clever as I am.""  Almost?  Well, actually, Zoe... But this is a great story for Zoe, showing off her math skills as well as a cute miniskirt.  Jamie has a good hand-to-hand combat moment in Episode 1.
Beta the controller of Science, like Selris, wants to be free, but is rational about it.  ""We only know what the Krotons tell us.  We don't think.  We obey."", and ""I'm tired of being fed information like a dog like scraps.""  The key though, as the Doctor and Zoe notice, are certain gaps in the Gonds' education, which may be significant.
There is a bit of a goof, as it's clear that the bottom of the Krotons are cloth and not metal.
Gilbery Wynne, who kind of resembles Dick Gephardt (D-NE), does a good job as Thara, as does James Copeland as Selris.  Phil Madoc plays Eelek with a menacing understatedness.  He would later appear in three Who stories: The War Games (1969), The Brain Of Morbius (1976), The Power Of Kroll (1979).  And Roy Skeleton, who did voices for the Daleks and early Cybermen, provides voices for the Krotons.
Not a bad story, considering how the sixth season of Dr. Who is the most complete Patrick Troughton season.",1057708800,8,3185,4.708333333333333
571672,5,6303145906,"I've been buying loads of Doctor Who videos and DVDs recently, most of which I have never seen.  Being a fan of the series, I knew who Patrick Troughton was, but never saw any of his episodes.  His appearance in The Five Doctors was just a glimps into what the second Doctor was like and ""Who"" he was.  Needless to say I wanted more.  Tomb of the Cybermen was my first Troughton episode...I'm convinced he is one of the best Doctors ever.  The Krotons is another excellent episode.  An interesting story, cold, creepy and truly alien aliens with bizarre technology and a solid cast.  The Kroton's accent made me laugh a few times (don't always sound so bright) but somehow that just added to the charm of this episode.  Is it just me, or does black and white seem more believable?  I pity the latter generations who may never see anything broadcasted black and white on the TV...  Another quality episode recommended for any fan of Dr Who or Sci-fi.",1037664000,13,949,4.529411764705882
571673,5,6303145906,"This is a clever Doctor Who story ostensibly about crystalline aliens who are dissolved in solvent and who can be restored by brainpower which can also drive their spaceship. The indigenous population are reared like sheep and educated in the learning halls to develop the intellect that the Krotons need whereupon they will leave the p;anet. Of course, the Doctor and his companions arrive and upset the applecart in their usual manner.
Why is this a clever story? Well the thrust of the plot is about the technologically superior aliens, crystalline based and susceptible to acid attack. However, the sub-plot revolves around the servile and passive Gonds who serve up their best and their brightest to be dispersed by the Krotons after they have been tested for brainpower. The interest lies in the revolutionary feelings of some of the younger members of the group, the staid conservatism of the leader and the almost complete disinterest in intellectual advancement. What occurs leads into revolt and betrayal, of the whole group and of the Doctor . There is a further side to this story of the intellectual arrogance of the Doctor and Zoe and the observation of the lack of common sense attached to high academic and intellectual ability.
All in all a very deep and complex story which operates on many levels. There is a comic side too of the many travels like a merry-go-round when the humanoids pass in, through and out of the Krotons ship and the surreal moment when the Kroton, travelling outside of the spaceship gets lost and cannot locate his position.
Lots of meat in this one originally broadcast 28 December 1968 through 18 January 1969.",1025481600,18,1654,4.910714285714286
571674,3,6303145906,"The existing Troughton episodes pose a dilemma for Troughton fans.  Some of the surviving Troughton serials (such as The Krotons) are below par; but we have to make do with what's available.  Much of PT's work as Dr. Who was  destroyed in the BBC's ""housecleaning"" of its video vaults in the  1970s.  Anything that still survives has to be treasured accordingly.  Thus, Troughton completists will want to acquire ""The Krotons"";  but my sense is that ""The Tomb of the Cybermen"" is still the best  memorial for Troughton.  ""Tomb"" is a little gem of a serial --  Dr. Who's dialogue with Victoria (in one of the quieter scenes) is  especially memorable.  ""Tomb"" was also very nearly destroyed.",961545600,5,689,4.844827586206897

571890,3,6303145906,"Blech!

I really liked the few Patrick Troughtons that are still available that I have seen, but this is by far the worst. It makes ""The Dominators"" look like an award winner.

Even at 4 episodes, it appears padded because nothing was really happening.

""Gonds"" (the natives of the planet the Tardis lands on) are being vaporized, two by two after falling to have enough mental energy to power the Krotons (the invaders) ship.

There is an internal power struggle between the leader of the Gonds (oh! The Krotons are too powerful, we can't defeat them) and a usurper (let's shoot fire at them with slingshots).

When the Krotons discover that The Doctor's and Zoe's brains are much more powerful, they want to capture our heroes (Jamie IS captured, but he's not smart enough) so a lot of time is spent running around cheesy sets.

The ""all-powerful"" Krotons (who resemble dreidels balanced precariously on cheese graters----and are almost as scary) spend the entire for episodes slowly running OUT of power until they finally fizzle (literally, melting like a sugar glaze in heat)

The ONLY redeeming feature of this story that makes it worth watching over and over is that the adorable Wendy Padbury as Zoe is in about half the total scenes, wearing a plastic micro-miniskirt.",1405209600,,1277,4.8842592592592595
571891,3,6303145906,"I'm a huge fan of this show, both classic era and new, and this is your average stuck-in-one-place, mostly-unseen-villain Who story.

572001,5,6303145906,"The Krotons is one of those stories I just happen to love.  Why?  In the end it is the Krotons.  While many people think of them as the lamest part of the story I like them.  They, and their technology, seemed truly alien to me as a teenager, when I first saw these episodes, and they fit right in with my view of how aliens in science fiction should be like.  You know, alien.  True, their design made them impossible for action scenes and meant they could not show emotions from facial expressions as, well, they had no faces.  But this story is like ice cream to me - nothing really there but full of yummy sugar.  Now, I DO like the learning machines and the idea of humans being used to fuel machinery was interesting.  But in the end this is the Krotons that make this story enjoyable for me - I just think they are cool, strange and truly...alien!
Because I saw this as a child and in the 80's, I never got the underlining message about fighting The Man or any of the Cold War stuff that bubbled under the surface of the story.  Many, no doubt, saw those themes when it first came out in 1968-1969.  I am sure it is there but you have to tilt your head and close one eye to notice it now. Maybe that ages it a tad.  So while I am giving it a five star rating many people will most likely think of it as a three or four star set.

It's shot on maybe 5 stages that range from mostly ""interstellar medieval"" to one that is almost definitively low-budget 60's sci-fi. The strength of this 4 episode tale is in the atmosphere and the performances. There's a good build-up surrounding the mystery of the Krotons, which isn't revealed until mid-way through episode 2. Troughton, Hines and Padbury are all in fine form, although Jamie takes a backseat to Zoe when it comes to the actual action. My 10 year-old daughter found the episode to be sufficiently creepy and spooky and most importantly not dull.

572010,4,6303145906,"""The Krotons"" is a routine story from Patrick Troughton's last season as the Doctor, but it was the first scripted by Robert Holmes, who would go on to pen such classic Doctor Who stories as ""Pyramids of Mars,"" ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang"" and ""The Caves of Androzani."" ""The Krotons"" was a back-up script commissioned by Terrance Dicks, who was being phased in as script editor at the time, and might never have been used if director David Maloney hadn't balked at the story that had been scheduled, an adventure set on a prison planet run by women in scanty leather costumes. Actor Frazer Hines (Jamie) was bitterly disappointed, but he was the only one.

In ""The Krotons,"" the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe land on a desolate planet inhabited by the Gonds, a technologically primitive society that has been enslaved by the unseen Krotons for a thousand years. The Krotons test Gond youths for intelligence and skim off the cream of each new generation to join them as ""companions"" inside their machine, never to be seen again. The Doctor and company discover the Krotons are actually killing the Gonds after siphoning off their brainpower to extend the Krotons' robotic lives. Meanwhile, the Krotons learn that the Doctor and Zoe possess higher IQs capable of powering the Kroton ship, which would allow them to escape the Gond planet for good.

The blocky Krotons (which were called ""croutons"" by the cast and crew) don't make for very menacing aliens, but director Maloney compensates by shooting them in close-up from the waist up, somewhat disguising the fact that there are only two of them and they can't see or walk very well. Philip Madoc makes his series debut as Eelek, a minor Gond villain who tries to trade the Doctor and Zoe to the Krotons in exchange for their promise to leave the Gonds in peace. Madoc would go on to play much more complex, convincing nemeses of the Doctor in ""The War Games"" and ""The Brain of Morbius"" in addition to playing the evil Huron Indian chief Magua in the BBC's 1971 production of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (also directed by Maloney).

I would normally rate a humdrum story like ""The Krotons"" only three stars, but I give this DVD four stars for the unusually crisp quality of the digital transfer and the high caliber of the added Special Features. Most of the original videotape from the William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton years was wiped by the BBC for reuse, meaning that surviving episodes are usually restored from film copies made for foreign TV markets. ""The Krotons"" exhibits none of the fuzzy, grainy qualities that plague so many of these restored episodes.

The Special Features menu leads with a 52-minute documentary spanning the Patrick Troughton years, which contained so many milestones that would later shape the series: the first regeneration of the Doctor to replace the aging William Hartnell, a one-time gimmick that was not meant to be repeated; the phasing out of purely historical stories in favor of stories with science-fiction elements in historical settings; the scripting troubles that led to such creative stories as ""The Mind Robbers"" and ""The War Games""; the creation of UNIT to take pressure off the lead actor playing the Doctor; the introduction of the Time Lords and the Doctor's back story as a rebel Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey; the Doctor's trial by the Time Lords and exile to Earth, without a working TARDIS, to cut series costs.

The Special Features also include a 17-minute interview with Frazer Hines (funny, as always) and a brief send-up of the Krotons by writers Joseph Lidster and Simon Guerrier (less funny). Not to be missed is the audio commentary, which includes the aforementioned Madoc on three of the four episodes, talking about his later work on Doctor Who and ""The Last of the Mohicans.""

7839078,4,6303145906,"The Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) lands on the Gonds' planet. They are a simplistic tribe of people who are dominated by the Krotons. Hundreds of years ago, the Krotons landed on the planet and war broke out with the Gonds. With their superior technology, the Krotons won and enslaved the Gonds. Currently, their big demand is the offering of the two most intelligent Gonds to be companions to the Krotons. Those Gonds are never seen again. The Doctor and his companions discover that the Kroton companions are being killed. Things have got to stop and the Doctor is ready to take action.

The story is fairly interesting. The menace is presented early but the whole situation is explained at a slower pace. The show holds off on showing the Krotons, which is good since the outfits are really unimpressive. They look like boxy, shiny robots with leather skirts hiding the actors' legs. Not scary at all. What they use the intelligent people for is interesting if not believable. Troughton is great as always.

Recommended if you can handle the poor visual design of the villains.",1525132800,,1084,4.854054054054054
7839079,4,6303145906,"Not one of Troughton's best stories and certainly not Robert Holmes script, but it's still a pretty good story.  The pacing is great for the era, the first episode in particular moved at a very solid clip. The principals really do hold this story together with Zoe and the Doctor getting some fine moments, and Jamie spending half the story on his own and doing his own thing.

The story illustrates Jamie's strength of character. He's not  a ""High Brain"" and therefore irrelevant to the Krotons' schemes, but his own native intelligence carries far and makes him a foe.

The idea of the Krotons' scheme is actually both pretty clever and pretty stupid. On one hand, the idea of using learning machines to control a population and let them learn what's useful to and forbid them from learning anything else is a diabolical way to enslave a people for a thousand years. However, because the purpose of this is to get home, their scheme is a bit stupid because they need ""High Brains"" to operate their ship and get them home and from a natural selection standpoint, they're making it hard for that to happen. It's foolish but in a realistic way compared to real life dictators.

The design for the Krotons is not all that great and the limitations on their movements makes them  less then fearsome foe. There are few wooden performances among the guest cast. Still, it's an enjoyable and well-paced sci fi story.",1490400000,,1410,4.6882591093117405

I enjoy all of the older doctor who episodes ,  and this stuff in spite of the low budget is filled with some great sci fi action and storyline.  The krotons are huge robot crystal creatures who feed off peoples minds.  There's plenty of extras on here too. With a documentary about the doctors second incarnation. And other interviews.  We see a interview from fraser hines circa 2002 or so and one from a actress who still remembers those days with clarity and she's now around 67 seven years old. But such is life. most of the cast is long gone sadly.  But the wonderful stories live on and lets hope they find all of these old shows so that we can watch them.",1447545600,,742,4.219858156028369
