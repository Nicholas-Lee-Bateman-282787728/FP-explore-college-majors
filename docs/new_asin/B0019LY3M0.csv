8274455,5,B0019LY3M0,These dvds are some of the best I've see.  The instruction is simple and clear.  The drills are fun.  It's perfect for anyone coaching 7-11 year olds.,1456963200,,150,4.481481481481482
8274456,4,B0019LY3M0,"You'll appreciate the fact that someone spent the time and expense to try and help make youth baseball fun
and understandable. But wait, not so fast. Is the philosophy this so called expert is trying to convince us
coaches and parents to follow correct?  Practice in 75 minutes and less?  As little as 60 minutes? Less technique, more drills?
Wholly check swing! Can this be true?  Well you decide for yourself. All I can tell you is that if you have any
inch of desire to make your youth baseball team better and have fun trying, this set is it! It worked for me as a coach and the players
on my team. My original plan was to watch one DVD per week and take notes. Well I got hooked and finished all eight in three days.
This may be too basic for some and too much information for others. But no doubt, if you can scratch out use of a field 1-2 days a week
for 60-75 minutes, the DVDs in this set can set your team on fire with passion.  Highly recommended!",1286668800,,958,4.190217391304348
8274457,4,B0019LY3M0,"The video is a little dated, but the content is great.  There are TONS of drills that you can use at home or on the field.",1273622400,,122,3.6923076923076925
8274458,4,B0019LY3M0,"These eight baseball instructional DVDs are done the correct way.
The explanations are realistic. The drills are some of the best I've seen
The techniques are very good but coaches should cherry pick some of them.
All in all this is well worth it!

An engrossing eight pack of DVDs that is full of first rate drills, techniques,strategies and creativity. I've looked everywhere for something that would help my kids with the self confidence they need before the first Little League practice. This has helped a lot. Everything is in these DVDs.
Marty Schupak's video programs (baseball, soccer, basketball, others?) is simply unmatched by others...fun (competition not over-stressed), comprehensive & enormous help for kids learning sports. I don't know of anyone who's used his sports instructional programs and doesn't love them!
He has obviously thought deeply about the fundamentals of baseball and how to teach them to young players. It is impressive and is a work of love!
Believe me, it is impossible for your son, daughter or team not to improve if you put these concepts into practical use.
THIS IS YOUTH BASEBALL AT IT'S BEST!",1246838400,,968,5.171974522292993
8274462,5,B0019LY3M0,"Our league purchased a few of these sets and we could not be happier.
Besides the great drills and skills the DVDs cover, the best return on our investment is that our league's baseball fundamentals have improved. Take the proper steps for your league and begin to teach basic baseball instruction in the pre-major levels i.e. 7-10 year olds. Follow the concepts shown and make sure your team practices. Throw in some fun games. Don't worry too much about championships in the younger divisions. If your team, league, or son is looking to improve, take the plunge with this set.
You have to love baseball to enjoy these!
