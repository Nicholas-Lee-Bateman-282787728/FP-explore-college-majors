5064381,5,B0079ILHZS,"People put a lot of work into these episodes.  I've been watching and rewatching the entire series under the assumption that I'll stop watching them when I stop catching new jokes.  So far, I still have to keep watching them.

The humor is low brow.  The drug use is rampant.  The character development and acting are both pretty amazing considering what they are doing in the series.

The musical episode is far more epic than the musical episode from the first season.

It's a real shame the show was canceled after two seasons.",1373241600,2,530,4.634408602150538
5064382,5,B0079ILHZS,"The only downside to this show is that it was cancelled after season 2, here's hoping fans can petition enough people to bring it back!",1365984000,,135,4.44
5064383,5,B0079ILHZS,"If you like dark, over-the-top, so-dumb-that-it's clever comedy.  You need to buy this.  Hopefully they can keep this series going.  Look how many series and movies that the Trailer Park Boys got...",1364256000,,198,5.125
5064384,5,B0079ILHZS,"I cannot imagine why they stopped after just 2 seasons, must be something in the water in Canada!  Scary, silly , naughty fun, with one of the best horror musical episodes (or musical episodes period) you'll ever see.  Buy both seasons while you can, its a blast.",1356134400,3,263,4.574468085106383
5064385,5,B0079ILHZS,"This is hilarious, campy horror stuff at it's best. It's all about teens, but this 56 year old loves it!",1353715200,7,104,4.25
5064386,5,B0079ILHZS,"If you love metal, horror, and comedy, then you're sure to love Todd & the Book of Pure Evil!  Definitely the best TV show to ever grace a TV set and the best thing to ever come out of Canada...ever.",1339545600,11,199,3.975
5064387,5,B0079ILHZS,"I have watched this episode about two dozen times - it never gets old.  If you liked the Buffy episode ""Once More With Feeling"", this episode will blow your mind.  Almost the entire episode is in song form (8 songs in a 22-minue episode) and every song is a different style.  One of the best episodes ever, anyone who likes the show at all needs to see this one.
Warning: this episode has even more potentially-offensive content than normal, but if you are easily offended you probably shouldn't be watching this series anyway.",1339027200,6,527,4.645161290322581
5064408,5,B0079ILHZS,"I was sorry to see this series come to a early end. Funny and enjoyable, glad this DVD lets me remember the funnier episodes.",1502323200,,125,4.25

5064412,5,B0079ILHZS,There's no question that this is the best show ever to come out of Canada and I am so sad they didn't go on to make a season 3 :(,1490572800,,129,3.3333333333333335

5064439,5,B0079ILHZS,This series is pretty awesome. If you like comedy & metal this might be a must watch series. Only thing is I wish the show had more than two seasons. There was talk of them making a cartoon to tie up all the loose ends of the series. Not sure that has happened yet.,1477612800,,265,3.925925925925926

5064464,5,B0079ILHZS,Todd and the Book of Pure Evil is probably my favorite TV show ever made. I have watched the whole series many times and its always entertaining. Its a shame they couldn't do a season 3.,1454803200,,186,4.194444444444445
5064465,5,B0079ILHZS,"If you appreciate twisted humor, buy it.",1453766400,,40,4.857142857142857
5064466,4,B0079ILHZS,VERY interesting series and liked it almost as much as the first season - but this one went off to the left a little and like so many vehicles on seasonal series - they pulled the rug out from under me - and cancelled the series.  No season 3.  Still - combined with season 1 - still happy t have them and lots of replay fun and value - just a shame it got shelved after season 2.,1449964800,,380,3.858974358974359
5064467,5,B0079ILHZS,More of the same is no crime when your premise is crazy metal-head misfits vs. the unholy powers of evil.,1449100800,,105,4.3
5064478,4,B0079ILHZS,"This season is definitely better than the first and I like that the story has better structure. The music is still great and would liken to have seen it on c.d. if I could. I am not surprised that the series was canceled, but I think that some other network will pick it up someday, but hopefully they will be able to bring the cast.",1446681600,,333,4.138461538461539
5064479,5,B0079ILHZS,"Season 2 is better than season 1, these episodes never get old, I just wish they made more.  It's a perfect blend of comedy/horror, stoner humer (which I'm not normally a fan of), profanity, and, actually, really cleverly written dialogue.  It's one of my favorite shows, I'm glad I watched it on a lark on netflix a couple years ago.",1445990400,,334,4.55
5064480,5,B0079ILHZS,Funny as hell.,1445558400,,14,4.0

5064482,5,B0079ILHZS,I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!! I am so saddened that the show ended after season 2. The whole heavy metal/horror-gore high school comedy is extremely funny. Atticus Murphy - the lines he has are hilarious. Hope the indiegogo movie thing panned out - definitely want to see a follow up to the end.,1438214400,,287,4.538461538461538

5064487,5,B0079ILHZS,"Love this show. It's about as high-brow as the three stooges, and as clean as a Bob Saget stand-up, but if that's what you're looking for, it's hard to wrong here.",1430352000,,163,4.290322580645161
5064498,5,B0079ILHZS,"Amazing second season. If you like horror & comedy this is definitely for you. Loves the first season, think the second season was even better. Wish they would of gotten picked up fr a third. Love Todd & the Book of Pure Evil!",1429142400,,226,4.27906976744186

5064506,5,B0079ILHZS,Amazing under the radar show. Highly recommended for fans of Troma style humor or sophomoric laughs. Atticus Murphy Jr. has easily become one of my favorite characters on TV.,1420070400,,174,5.0344827586206895
5064507,5,B0079ILHZS,A friend of mine introduced me to this series. It's funny and creepy. The perfect amount of scare the hell out of you and laugh your ass off! I love this show. Too bad they only made 2 seasons :(,1417219200,,195,3.9

5064510,5,B0079ILHZS,"Definitely odd and I have to give kudos to Jason Mewes for accepting the rather trivial role of a supporting actor - and he does it marvelously.  Very rude and crude throughout and I'm very disappointed that they stopped after two seasons.  Hopefully, they will resolve it all in a final movie - like they did for Firefly (Serenity).",1413849600,,333,4.627118644067797

5064516,4,B0079ILHZS,"Half decent show.
I'd never seen or heard of it, but it was a recommendation based off of ""Reaper"" (excellent buy)

The show is a little immature, and the actors have some cheesey roles, but all in all, it makes for a pretty fun experience.

The story line begins to involve you regardless if you want to get into it or not.
Give yourself until at least mid-season of season 1, before you decide to thrash this selection!

It's good for what it is!

5064517,5,B0079ILHZS,This season is a good as the first.  I wish they had been able to continue to a third season.  Even my 83 year old mother loved it.,1400112000,,131,3.642857142857143
5064518,5,B0079ILHZS,"This is one of those shows I ran across on Netflix and thought it wouldn't be good so I avoided it for months. Finally on a whim I watched it and boy was I wrong. Surprisingly, at least from an American perspective, this show is Canadian. Most of the episodes wouldn't even get a chance on regular American tv so this is certainly an adult show. Season 2 continues with the same problems and hilarity that you see in Season 1. The acting is top notch and the storyline from episode to episode is crazy good. Considering this show got shut down (way to soon) for the current price this is a no brainer. The DVD quality is great and I had no problems playing it on my xbox. If you enjoy more adult yet still teenager comedy then buy this!",1398124800,,736,4.226950354609929

5064523,5,B0079ILHZS,"I personally do not care for this show. HOWEVER, my husband laughs at every episode. He loves it. Apparently he has a strange sense of humor... Strong sexual content and language, drug references. I would not recommend letting a child/teenager watch this. I can not give a fair review about the show because I have not watched the seasons but he is really happy with it so 5 stars...",1389744000,,383,4.565217391304348

5064526,5,B0079ILHZS,Loved the first season and this one was just as good.  I like the whole conspiracy at the high school story and how the book flies around and grants wishes for it's benefit.  A fun series.,1378166400,,188,4.194444444444445
