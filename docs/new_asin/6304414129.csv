863841,4,6304414129,"If you're looking for a good story, performances and dialogue look somewhere else. Adrenalin: Fear the Rush (love that name!), deliberately avoids all three, preferring to concentrate on non-stop action, and low-budget action is what Albert Pyun (directer) does best.
While this doesn't appeal to many, if you get into the action you will find Adrenalin a tense and exciting journey, and never boring.",1017964800,,401,5.28125
863842,4,6304414129,"A lot of people are being harsh towards Adrenalin: Fear the Rush, when it was actually a pretty good movie.  The only problem with the movie is the setting.  Otherwise the plot and characters were actually pretty good. It had suspense and a few thrills.

863843,1,6304414129,"The fact that other reviewers have given this ""film"" five stars only goes to prove my personal theory that directors pay their friends to give their putrid movies good reviews to trick unsuspecting people like you and I. I mean seriously, one short ""review"" called this film ""amazing!"" Come on! Did you and I see the same film!? Just a bogus review to beef up the average customer stars. Duh. Well, he/she is from Mississippi. Anyhow, enough of my personal hypothesis. Lambert and other police officers go after a ""psychotic killer,"" who is nothing more than Riff from Rocky Horror dressed in overalls. You will spend the rest of the film watching incompetent people deservedly dying for their stupidity, if you choose to view it. After you see it you will ask yourself the following questions: One, what did the old woman have to do with ANYTHING. Second, why didn't the creature kill Natasha Henstridge when it was standing right behind her, as it hadn't hesitated with anyone else. Third, how STUPID can these people be, they deserve horrid deaths! Fourth (yep, still more) how does Lambert survive getting shot approximately nine times!? Fifth, how does the ""special team"" in the yellow suits manage to get wiped out by the weaponless creature, when they all have machine guns. Sixth (sigh) it's not scary to show the same scene everytime of a closeup of 1) the killers mouth and 2) his bloodshot eyes when he kills someone.  What are we on. Oh, seventh: Assuming this is the future, where is any sort of technology that might help out. Eighth, why do none of these highly trained officers manage to get off a shot at the killer before the killer manages to shoot one of them? Ninth, oh enough. You get the idea. If you already saw this film, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, you may want to rent it just to know what the cheapest, worst film ever looks like. As about 95% of this film was shot in a dark sewer somewhere, it probably cost about 500 bucks to make. Plus a box of cracker jacks to pay Lambert.",989712000,9,2027,4.584022038567493
863844,3,6304414129,"This movie is one of many movies that I have seen over and over again.  The plot is set very early, which gets it right out the way so you can experience, the RUSH.  ""Adrenalin"" will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The suspence and well placed screen shots, help add to the action.  Thats why this movie doesn't need all those fancy effects.  Which today, seem to be over used.  This movie is atleast one to check-out...but don't take my word for it, look at it yourself.  People these days expect something from a film, and if the film doesn't give them that exact detail, they turn on the film and call it ""A waist of time.""  I just wanted to put my view out there...thank you for your time.",977356800,2,697,4.18796992481203
863845,1,6304414129,"This film has appeared on more than a few critical ""Worst of the 1990s"" lists. It deserves to. It's barely even a movie, just a bunch  of people running around a deserted building allegedly in Boston (actually  some city in Eastern Europe), chasing some sort of deformed albino guy.",965606400,10,282,4.73469387755102
863846,1,6304414129,"I saw this movie a few years back and after watching, thought to myself, ""this is the worst movie I've ever seen.""  Years later, it still stands its ground as such.  The first 10 minutes of the film seem to be  supplying the setting and cast familiarizations.  15 minutes or so into the  film, the main characters go to a building to check something out, when out  of the blue they notice an albino freakish killer of some sort.  They go to  check it out and...lo and behold, THEY SPEND THE ENTIRE REST OF THE MOVIE  IN ONE BUILDING HUNTING AN ALBINO KILLER BEAST!  I had no idea that this  was what the movie was going to consist of by the description on the back  of the box.  Horrible acting, horrible plot, very few effects(which are  essential for this type of plotless, characterless, B-film), I would pay  Blockbuster 3 bucks to take this movie out of my memory.  I would've rated  0 stars but there was no option to do so.  Seeing that it goes for over 100  dollars here made me laugh aloud for at least 50 seconds.  DO NOT RENT.",956448000,14,1037,4.302083333333333
863847,4,6304414129,"This movie's plot develops slowly, but moves quickly and keeps the viewer pinned waiting for logical explanations for the motive of the killer and the genesis. In the future, we might not have control over what's happening  or why. Perfect uncertainty film. In a crisis situation with a maniac  killer there is no logic. Natasha Henstridge performs well in a role as a  rookie cop and elevates her acting ability showing vulnerability and  durability to a tough role. With each film she does, her acting skills grow  better and better. It's a shame that she continues to have trouble shaking  the Species- Chick label. I believe her acting skills will continue to  improve and she is on the brink of a break-through performance. She would  be excellent opposite a notable leading actor in a movie with a good  storyline and plot. She makes the most out of what's available.",948931200,,873,4.805369127516778

7870226,3,6304414129,"This is not a bad second feature on a movie bill. The powers that be have given the potential viewer that option by putting it in collections with as many as 8 or 9 other B pictures. As such, weighing in at only 76 minutes, it is a nice filler when you have a little time to kill and don't want to get involved with a longer, more engaging film. That's the way I used it,  and as such, it served the purpose pretty well. Yes, as reviewers point out, there is a bit of cocamamie business at the beginning which is irrelevant to the rest of the film, something about a prison area and the need of passports. Forget it, except for a sequence at the very end, it plays no role at all to which you need attend. True also, 95% of the action is in a limited area which seems fully equipped with endless corridors, dungeons and assorted hiding places. To me this simply meant that the whole film was really only what would be a segment of a longer movie. Why worry. Yes, I, too, noticed that the X-man was capable of extraordinary killing power against presumably trained  policemen, some of whom wore protective gear, others of whom wore none, with no apparent ill-effects. One can point out other elements which can contribute to a moment's bemusement; however, the  point is, that by accepting these without quibble, over-all it is a not bad way to fill 76 minutes. There is action, there are untenable situations from which to escape, there is a lot of shooting, and a woman comes out top-dog.
In sum, if this is not going to be THE event of  your evening, if it is just a filler, as most of TV fare is, then it is worth the few cents it costs if purchased as part of a collection. I would not ,and did not, buy it with a four dollar (plus purchase price) bill to get it, from Amazon.",1374364800,,1780,4.257396449704142

7870229,2,6304414129,"A new highly contagious virus is killing people, accidentally let loose in Eastern Europe. To make matters worse an infected killer cannibal is on the loose in a quarantined area of Boston immigrants. Delon (Natasha Henstridge) who has her own issues leads the gang that couldn't shoot straight against a man with a knife who is not John Rambo. Most of the film is consumed with a boring game of cat and mouse played out between our killer and the good guys.

The movie we are told takes place in Boston, but was filmed in Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina which has noticeably different architecture. The police cars are small and have ""Policia"" written on the back. Who will notice?

I was able to purchase this film along with 5 others on a contagious film 6-pack at Walmart for $5.00

I thought it would be a good film to see again now (a decade later), but now realize that I really HAVE changed since then. The movie was nowhere near as exciting to me now as it once was. Perhaps I could donate it to some kid looking for something older than he/she is.

7870232,4,6304414129,"Let me just say, I enjoyed this movie. When I was young I must've rented this like 10 times. It has constantly been ridiculed by people, I guess, expecting an Oscar worthy flick. Which, of course, it isn't. With a running time of just over an hour, Adrenaline starts off with a bang and gets right into the story. No boring plot and character development, just crazy guy vs. cops.

  Here's the rundown. A deadly virus, originating from Europe, sweeps across the world towards America. All European immigrants entering the U.S. are placed in quarantine in the city of Boston. It turns out an infected, well lets just call him a man/creature/monster guy, made it into the U.S. and will become contagious in a matter of hours. This guy is a complete psycho, killing people left and right, cutting off heads, eating hearts, and so on. Cops get called to the scene and follow him into an abandoned building. All of this takes place in the first 5-10 minutes and the rest of the movie is the police (or should I say policia) chasing him through the city and into the underground.

There are of course a few poor creative decisions that effect the movie-
*The film takes place in Boston but it is more then obvious it was filmed somewhere in Europe.
*There is an annoying screaching sound everytime the killer pops up as well as many close-ups of his eyeball.
*Cheesy action music.
*Adrenalin is mispelled, it should be Adrenaline. (Your guess is as good as mine on that one)

  All things aside, Adrenaline is a completely fast-paced flick with absolutely no dull moments. The action starts right off the bat and carries on through the end of the movie. For being made in 1993, this movie is of surprisingly good quality and features Christopher Lambert and the gorgeous Natasha Henstridge. I liked the film for what it is, a decent thriller. I even bought it.",1205107200,2,1855,4.637195121951219
7870233,2,6304414129,"Was this pre-Species? Anyhow, I don't get it, what was the point of the monster..., an army experiment gone awry, a plague treatment gone awry, a CIA experiment gone awry? We're given no explanation. An Adrenalin(e) experiment gone awry? Adrenalin (sp) refers to ??? the bloodshot eyes?

This was Boston? Maybe the Boston in the Czech Republic. Our police chief did not have a Boston accent.

Interesting point- the monster uses a gun!

It was unexpected!

Can you imagine the Alien shooting at Ripley with a hand gun? It adds a strange dimension to the 'demon in the dark' sense of danger that your usual horror film goes for. That just ain't right.

Did the DVD have any extras on it- like a director commentary as to what the heck he was thinking?",1119916800,3,750,4.609022556390977
7870234,1,6304414129,"For anyone who thinks this is a good movie, or for anyone considering watching it, let me describe to you a little something that happens herein: one of the characters is killed in the middle of the movie, but he appears at the end unscathed -- with absolutely no explanation of what happened. And, as Dave Barry often writes, we are not making this up.

Anyway, for most of the interminable duration of ""Adrenalin,"" Christopher Lambert, Natasha Henstridge, and some other actors I've never heard of star as cops chasing after some psycho in post-apocalyptic Boston. If that premise doesn't sound dumb enough, here are some other bad or just absurdly stupid things in this movie:

* It stars Christopher Lambert.

* It is set after an apocalypse. It was made in the 1990s. It takes place in 2008.

* There was a massive plague in Europe that caused many Europeans to come to Boston. But apparently, they brought their stucco red-roofed buildings and their police cars, which say ""Policia"" on the side. May I remind you again that this takes place in Boston.

* Much of the movie takes place in a dungeon (see final sentence of last point).

* The villian is really lame (if you want to call him villain, that is -- he's actually infected with an evil virus, presumably the same one that wiped out Europe). He looks like an old man dying of cancer and limps around whenever the camera is on him, but he seems to have super-powers whenever he is off-screen -- a common characteristic of villians in bad horror movies. Whenver he appears, there is also a very silly loud shriek that is often accompanied by a shot of his blood-drenched teeth. Finally, his two weapons are a curved blade and a pistol. If you have the misfortune of seeing this movie, you'll realize how dumb it looks.

* Boston has been quarrantined, and the only way to get out is with a passport. But using a fake one is punishable by death. Natasha Henstridge's character gets such a counterfeit passport for her kid to escape Boston, but it is not clear how she expects for it to fool the authorities because when she drops it at one point in the movie, Lambert exclaims: ""A fake passport!""

* We do not get to see Henstridge with her shirt off. They could have at least put that in as a consolation. After all, if half way through this movie Henstridge suddendly declared that it was awfully hot and muggy in the dungeon and that she wanted to remove her clothing in order to gain some relief, it would not have made this movie any worse artistically.

* The correct spelling of the word is ""adrenaline.""

One final word of caution: Although the things I have listed above may make ""Adrenalin"" seem so bad that it's good, beware! Much of it is very boring, consisting of the cops crawling through sewars and dungeons with very little action. What little action takes place is incredibly bad, mostly consisting of Lambert getting shot in the arms and shoulders and then writhing in pain. If you want to see one of the worst movies made in the last decade, be my guest. But don't complain when you are unable to erase the hideous memory of this movie from your brain.",1092873600,7,3133,4.539007092198582
