8226365,2,B000X0W32U,"This film is an early effort in the careers of both Calhoun and Fleming and is okay on its own merits.  However, beware that the print that is used for the DVD copy is not very good.  It is blurry, to say the least.  Yes it is watchable, but the quality of the print is very poor.",1485129600,2,280,3.8771929824561404
8226366,1,B000X0W32U,I have had the original movie poster for years. How delighted I was to see that the movies were available on DVD. Stay away from this one. Its an off copyright version. Both the picture and sound quality are horrible. It was so bad that I kept the DVD box and ran the disc through my shredder.,1468022400,4,293,4.157894736842105

8226368,5,B000X0W32U,"Any film with Rhonda Fleming, even an early one like this is worth owning.  There are elements that reminded us of the current TV series ""Lost"".  This we enjoyed more.",1207958400,2,167,4.533333333333333
