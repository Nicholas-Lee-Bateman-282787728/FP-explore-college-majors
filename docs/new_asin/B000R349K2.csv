2857127,5,B000R349K2,I first saw this series on PBS in the mid-late 1980's and loved every moment. So happy it is now available on DVD! I'm putting it at the top of my Christmas list!,1196208000,,162,3.9393939393939394
2857128,5,B000R349K2,"Gold Crest created a real winner in its imaginative 1984 ""Robin of Sherwood"" TV series adaptation of the Robin Hood legend.

The series originally ran for 4 seasons on British TV ... seasons one and two comprise ""Part 1"" (5 disks) of Acorn Media's DVD collection, and star Michael Praed as Robin of Loxley.  Seasons three and four comprise ""Part 2"" (5 disks) of Acorn's DVD collection, and starred Jason Connery as Robert of Huntington.  After wrapping at the end of season 4, the series went into syndication, and was re-aired here in the States in the late 1980's on Showtime ... I was one of the fortunate few who not only knew about the series back then, but also owned a VCR, so I was able to tape it - although the image quality of the masters used by Showtime was depressingly mediocre.

The series went on to develop a small but very loyal cult following.  The soulful Celtic-themed music by Clannad (back when they were relatively unknown), the presence of old magic and myths comes to life (Herne the Hunter, Crom Cruac, witchcraft, etc.), and excellent performances by Ray Winstone (Will Scarlet -arguably the best actor on the series), Nickolas Grace (Sheriff of Nottingham), and Michael Praed (Robin of Loxley) all combined to make for a very enjoyable and nostalgic series.  It just worked.

Now, here we are 20 years later, and at long last, this little known cult series has been re-released on high-quality DVDs (hooray !), so that it can be seen and enjoyed anew - not just by it's original fans, but by a new generation of viewers as well.

2857129,5,B000R349K2,"I originally saw this series when Showtime brought it over from the BBC/UK back in the 80s and aired it here in the US.  I loved it then and it still holds up well today, even if some of the ""special effects"" do look dated.  The acting and dialogue is very well done, and the interaction between the Sheriff and his henchman Guy is often downright hysterical.  Too, the transition between ""Robin of Locksley"" and ""Robert of Huntington"" was well done and a great concept.",1194480000,2,470,4.5058823529411764
2857130,5,B000R349K2,"Though I missed Michael Praed as Robin in the Hood, Jason did a remarkable job taking over.  I wasn't a big Judi Trott fan but the writing and the filming were excellent.  The best of the Robin Hood legends that I have ever seen.  The stories are interesting, the humor is great, I still remember lines from these shows after all these years.  I was very happy when Set 1 came out, but watching that made me want Set 2, so I was happy to know that it followed shortly.
The filming stays to period and they did not scrimp on sets and extras.  The cast is great and very believable.
What more can I say, than what I already have, the BEST of all the Robin Hood movies/series.",1193961600,11,673,4.186046511627907
2857131,5,B000R349K2,"I am thrilled to learn that this remarkable show is going to be available on DVD.  Both versions, the first starring Michael Praed and the second starring Jason Connery were [in my opinion] the most authentic [looking] of any made to date.

I recently purchased Season 1 and was afraid that I would never see the final chapters available on DVD on this side of the Atlantic.

Waiting till October is going to be very difficult.",1187568000,7,427,4.592105263157895

2857143,5,B000R349K2,"""Robin of Sherwood"" is my all time favorite Robin Hood series! Although, the first series with Michael Praed as Robin was the absolute best, Jason Connery does a great job as Robin in series 2. If you are a true Robin Hood fan as I am, I think this a definite series for you to consider; be sure to consider buying both of the series, with Michael Praed and Jason Connery as Robin, on DVD. It is very true to how life was at that time with living in the castle, and the English countryside. The characters are portrayed very well by each of the actors chosen for their roles. I highly recommend this series.",1411171200,2,607,4.28695652173913

2857146,3,B000R349K2,"Really, this show in the first two seasons, with Michael Praed, was absolutely the best Robin Hood there is.  When Michael left and Jason Connery came, there were a lot of changes, not just with the lead actor.  The stories got more ridiculous.  (Really, a clay man terrorizing Sherwood?  I can't see that happening during the Michael Praed seasons.)  The scripts were less well written.  Every episode now someone says ""He should have been back by now.""  Or during an argument someone else says ""He's right.""  And there are episodes that still today, nearly 30 years later, make me think, ""What were they thinking when they made this?""  BUT with all that being said, it is still Robin of Sherwood.  Marion and the Merries are great.  They are the definitive Merry Men.  There is no better Marion, Little John, Will Scarlett, Much, and Tuck.  And of course Nasir--one of the coolest guys ever. Even with it's weaknesses, it's better than most other Robin Hoods out there.  Just not as good as the first two seasons.",1393113600,,1015,4.725714285714286

2857150,5,B000R349K2,"I watch this show in the 80s and I loved it, best Robin Hood show I ever seen. I wish it would have lasted longer than it did. The video was excellent and so was the audio. I liked the music as well.",1358899200,,199,3.6511627906976742
2857151,5,B000R349K2,"Much as we loved Set 1, Set 2 was really enjoyable.  The entire series was incredible and the commentaries by Connery & Ryan & Mantle were so good humored they were fun in themselves.  The transition of the two Robins was so logical:  two completely different actors and two completely different Robins (Robin to Robert to Robin).  Each actor was just right for his particular Robin.  Plenty of features on both sets and a lot of hours of entertainment.",1343174400,,453,4.6835443037974684
2857152,5,B000R349K2,"The two best known Robin hood legends are the tales of common born defender of the People, Robin of Loxley, and those of Nobleman turned Heroic Wolf's head, Robert of Huntingdon. This great series incorporated both. This set picks up with Robert of Huntingdon(Jason Connery) becoming the new ""Hooded Man"". Robert is at first apprehensive about taking on the Mantle of Robin Hood, but soon proves himself a worthy successor to Loxley. By the end of the second episode, everyone calls him ""Robin"" instead of Robert, and it's back to business as usual, robbing the rich, giving to the poor, and generally making life miserable for the Sheriff, and Sir Guy(continuing to be brilliantly played by Nickolas Grace, and Robert Addie, respectively - all the cast is great, but those two guys have incredible chemistry, and tend to steal just about every scene they're in!)  As is the case with set 1, the Blu-Ray picture and sound are a noticeable step up from the DVD version, and well worth upgrading to. I did notice that this set seems to sport a touch more grain than set 1, but again, it's FILM grain, not compression artifacts. I highly recommend this set!",1334448000,2,1154,4.77
2857163,5,B000R349K2,"I loved this series when it was on Showtime back in the 80s.  Too bad it was taken off the air.  If you like that renaissance type of stuff, this is a must see series.  Each lasts 1 hr.",1327881600,,185,3.6923076923076925
2857164,5,B000R349K2,"Long before Kevin Costner's totally stupid Robin Hood movie there was Robin of Sherwood. Filmed in the UK this was a great series that had realism, authentic music, and some darned good characters. This is actually season 3. The first 2 seasons were very short. I totally recommend it.",1284768000,,285,4.836734693877551
2857165,5,B000R349K2,"The first episodes of ""Richard Carpenter's Robin of Sherwood"" came out in the early 1980's on public broadcasting t.v. They were AWESOME! The story line and characters were rich and complelling. I especially liked Michael Praed (Robin of Loxley), his acting abilities gave flair to his character and there was a nice on screen chemistry with Judi Trott (Marion). I was very sad when the series killed Robin for the finale.
  But the series was continued . . . Herne the hunter picks a new champion . . . Robert of Huntington (Jason Connery) the son of an Earl, to pick up where Robin of Loxley left off. Robert initally denies Herne, saying he could never take Robin's place as the Hooded Man. But when Marion (Judi Trott) is kidnapped by the evil Lord Owen of Clun, he is faced with the task of finding the rest of the band to help free her. This mission brings them together and the group sees that while Robert is not like their former leader, there is still goodness in him and his heart is in the right place. Marion still grieves for her former husband and despite Roberts obvious interest in her she is reluctant to give her heart to another man who can break it. The finale was awesome, Marion gives her heart to Robin who vows he will NEVER leave her, the evil Gulmar (Richard O'Brian) returns with a monsterous creation intent on killing Herne the Hunter, a cliff-hanger yet (thankfully the writers DIDN'T kill this Robin off . . . well, not exactly) . . . but there was no happy ending for this Robin & Marion either.
  Very well created & highly recommended viewing, definitely a classic. Personally I liked the first Robin of the Hood (Michael Praed), but the writers of this series were quite successful in introducing the new Robin of the Hood (Jason Connery) for this second set (no easy task).",1279152000,2,1810,4.542944785276074
2857166,4,B000R349K2,"The tales of Robin Hood and his merry band of outlaws have had popular appeal for centuries. Books, movies and TV series about them have turned up pretty regularly for decades. This is the 1980s iteration, with Robin and Marian, Little John and  Will Scarlet and all.

This set comprises the final 13 episodes of a series which originally ran for three seasons. The first two starred Michael Praed as Robin of Loxey, a commoner who obeyed the summons of the forest-spirit Herne the Hunter. He gathered the original band of outlaws and defended the interests of the poor and dispossessed against the greed of the nobility, represented by the Sheriff of Nottingham, until he was cornered and killed. This series picks up with the summoning of Robert of Huntingdon, the son of a powerful noble, to take up the mantle... or hood, as it were. Initially reluctant, Robert (played by Jason Connery) obeys Herne and reassembles the far-scattered band, rescues Marian from the clutches of a semi-barbaric Lord Owen of Clun and embarks on a series of adventures as exciting as they are historically improbable. I am sure that any  medieval scholars watching this series are probably gibbering incoherently over some of the plot devices, but then it's not a show for them; it's a show for the rest of us, all fantastical derring-do, lots of fighting, what passes for social justice,  lashings of mysticism and magic; all that and  music by the group Clannad. There was originally a lot of money spent on this series and it shows. Much of it was shot on location in Northern England, and there are lots of nice details, like the paucity of tableware, and the Sheriffs' collection of hunting birds. The castle interiors look dim and cramped; comfort and privacy are very authentically in short supply, and almost everyone appears to be grimy, rumpled and somewhat shaggy of hair. On the whole, the series has aged very well, as have the actors. But the final episode ends very abruptly and on a bittersweet note, with Marian taking refuge in holy vows. A downturn in the fortunes of the film company which produced the series made it impossible to continue, after setting up such a cliff-hanger!

As suited to such a popular show, the bonus features are generous. Nearly half of the episodes have a commentary track. Two hours worth of other extras are on a separate disc, and to a fan would be worth purchasing as a stand-alone. Two documentaries feature interviews with the actors (nearly all of whom have aged as well as the series has) there is another short feature about Clannad's music, a short morning news feature done about the show, some nice behind-the-scenes footage and the usual bloopers and outtakes. There is also a short filmography for the featured actors, which should solve the puzzle of ""where the heck have I seen that face before"" for many a consumer of British imports.",1243123200,,2881,4.81010101010101
2857167,5,B000R349K2,This really is excellent.  It engages the viewer from the first episode and expands the relationship between the characters in the following episodes in a realistic and human way.  Very enjoyable.  I reccomend it.,1228521600,,213,5.205882352941177
2857168,4,B000R349K2,"I thoroughly enjoyed this set as much as I did the first set with Michael Praed (tho Michael is still my favorite).I bought both sets and watched them in a week. The setting was great, the medieval costuming was very authentic (including dirty peasants as it would have been), the storylines were a wonderful mix of medieval reality and mystical and the characterizations were great. One really comes to care for these young outlaws. Each had a distinct personality and stayed true to it through most of the series. That said, I take off only one star for the scriptwriter, Richard Carpenter, who ended the last episode of both sets unacceptably. Robin (Praed) in the last episode of set 1 and Marian (Trott) in the last episode of set 2, in my opinion, slipped out of character for the mere purpose of a more dramatic ending. Robin was much too wily and smart for such an end, and Marian was strong, passionate and a fighter. She would not have suddenly become a whimpering ""female"" afraid to face an uncertain future. She would have held onto what she'd been fighting for for so many years. Other than that, everything else about this series is a joy to watch, and I'm sure I'll watch them over and over again. I may however avoid those 2 episodes. Unfortunately, nothing is forgotten. Nothing is ever forgotten. :)",1218758400,,1317,4.656652360515022

8198553,5,B000R349K2,"Finally could get rid of my old VHS copies of this show and replace them with DVDs of Sets 1 and 2.  Set 1 revolves around Michael Praed as Robin Hood, a peasant who is picked by Herne the Hunter, Lord of the Forest, to be his champion of justice for the downtrodden people of Nottingham.  I won't give it away, but Set 2 stars another man as Robin Hood, this time the son of an Earl (played by Jason Connery, the son of Sean Connery).  Part of the Set shows how Robin's Merry Men need to get used to another Robin, as well as his love, Marion.  The Sheriff and Sir Guy are still wonderful (and funny, at times) foils for Robin and there is much magic and sword fighting and archery, often with pagan overtones.
