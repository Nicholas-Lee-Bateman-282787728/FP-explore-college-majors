8270717,1,B000MTFDFQ,"OMG! What horrible horrible horrible acting. This video was a waste of time and money. The actors/actress, especially the lead, definitely needed acting classes. The script that they were projecting did not match the influxion or tone of their voice. Most of the time, it was as if they were reading lines! I'm not sure if it was because this movie was created in the 70s and that may have been how all acting was, but I doubt it! Save your money.",1305158400,,447,4.463414634146342
8270718,5,B000MTFDFQ,"First off, Amazon is great. I received my DVD in a week. Two, the movie was very good considering that I was in it. It took almost 17 yrs for this movie to get released and now I have the first movie that I was in. If you like those cheezy murder thrillers from the 70s, you will enjoy Dead Girls Don't Tango. I played Roscoe the new projectionist towards the last ten minutes of the movie. It's guest star is Karen Black.",1187913600,2,422,4.096385542168675
