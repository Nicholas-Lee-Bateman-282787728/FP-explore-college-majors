924038,4,6304523971,"Surprisingly good. Better than average music for early talkies. The story is good, however some of the cliffhangers are goofy.  The star, Frank Merrill has one of the best physiques and worst toupees of any Tarzan.  The  female lead, ""Lady Jane"" played by what has to be the hottest  babe Rotwang ever saw in a silent film, Natalie Kingston. It includes a  nude swimming scene with Ms. Kingston. The story is fast paced with more  depth than any serial Rotwang's ever seen and Rotwang's seen all the famous  ones. Production values are surprisingly good. La, the Queen of Opar is  appropirately kinky looking. Nizze trailer on the queen.
The camera work  also gets very fancy with all kinds of tracking shots.
The one big down  side is that in an attempt to look furious, Tarzan looks more like he  pouting.

7877170,4,6304523971,"I learned about the silent Tarzan serials when I was a lot younger and prepped on Weissmuller, Crabbe, Morris, Brix, and Barker, but never had a chance to see the Frank Merrill version.  Now many years later, I bought the Alpha DVD and have run it, and y'know, it is kinda good.  The acting is strictly ""silent movie"" where everything is done through ""emoting.""  Natalie Kingston as Jane ""emotes"" going through the entire gamut of exaggerated emotion.  In contrast, Frank Merrill, of the gnarly arms and hauling himself up the vine with his legs straight out, really underplays everything to the point of I find myself trying hard to read his lips to pick up the context.  This is not so terrible but opposite to Natalie Kingston.  It makes one wonder how Merrill would have worked out in talkies (how bad was the voice on the masculine man?) and also if Henry MacRae might have had issues drawing him out.  I enjoyed how Henry MacRae shot the serial, with some very stylish camera movement.  What a contrast when Universal transitioned to sound, largely turning to reliance on grainy stock footage and the less-imaginative directorial style of Ray Taylor!  The music score was well done but I found myself desiring more synchronized animal noise (I thought was rather sparse) and found I could tolerate Frank Merrill's Tarzan calls well enough, but do not rate them as imaginative as the Weissmuller version. I am happy prints of this still exist.  So many of the old pictures are lost and never coming back.",1427932800,,1509,4.769230769230769
7877171,5,6304523971,"""Tarzan the Tiger,"" based on Edgar Rice Burroughs's ""Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar"" was Universal's second sound serial, directed by Henry MacRae and released late in 1929.  While there is no spoken dialogue, it has a musical score, sound effects and a few Tarzan yells, originally on a synchronized disc recording.  A rare example of a ""non-talking"" sound serial, it is also an entertaining Tarzan film, and better-produced than many of Universal's later serials.

To save his English estates, Lord Greystoke (Frank Merrill), returns to the Jungle as Tarzan the Tiger to sack the Temple of Opar for a treasure only he knows about.  Unfortunately he suffers a head injury, can't remember that he is Lord Greystoke and married to Lady Jane (Natalie Kingston) and thinks the jewels he has collected are only ""pretty pebbles.""  Further, Queen La of Opar (Mademoiselle Kithnou) believes Tarzan is her destined mate, and had previously tried to sacrifice Jane to the Fire God, in a ceremony with her female dance troupe.  There's a false friend, Albert Werper (Al Ferguson) working with a ""nomadic"" slave-trader, Achmet Zek (Sheldon Lewis) to capture Jane, along with the more-usual Jungle perils of Lions, Tigers (yes!), Apes and Crocodiles.  The scantily-clad females were intended to boost adult audience attendance, and was far more succesful than when Universal tried it again in 1936 with the first Flash Gordon serial.  Frank Merrill was billed as ""the original Tarzan"" since he was the stunt double for Elmo Lincoln's earlier efforts.  While not a great actor, he has the right physique for Tarzan, can climb and swing on ropes, and is able to look like someone who lost his memory.  His expersssions of rage are extreme even by silent movie standards; fortunately most of the other cast members show more restraint.  Helping things greatly is the musical score, supportive of the action and emotions of the characters and a feature that vanished in the early days of ""talking"" pictures due to technical problems with sound mixing.

While there are significant differences in image quality among the three editions listed by Amazon, all are from the same video transfer, which was not made recently and has a number of problems.  Sharpness could be better, but this and the gray scale are at least fairly tolerable.  The image is somewhat enlarged, causing a few of the opening credits to go missing or get bisected near the bottom of the screen by the head-switch glitch from the master videotape.  A pattern of dark spots appears, noticed starting in Chapter Ten, most likely from damaged phosphor in the imaging tube, and in some of the later chapters hum and noise in the sound become worse.  The print was reasonably complete, but the end of Chapter Eleven was missing about a minute, including the cliffhanger.  Not ideal, but the quality is typical for transfers made for VHS release.

Grapevine's edition, ASIN: B002QD65CG is on two DVD-R discs, single layer, which should work on most DVD players.  The image is good given the video source, with the size slightly reduced, ""matted"" so it is easier to read the credits that are still on-screen.  The sound is fine, by 1929 standards, with frequency response well balanced and only a small amount of noise.  The picture has been tinted in colors that seem suitable for the scenes, and a good effort whether or not these match the originals used by Universal.  The cliffhanger on Chapter Eleven has been restored from footage at the start of the next chapter, though the ""next week"" title is obviously a replacement.

VCI's VHS edition, # 1780, was issued in 1997 on two cassettes, originally at SP speed.  The image seems a little sharper than Grapevine's DVD, possibly because it isn't tinted, though some scenes and intertitles are a little dark.  The sound has been filtered of some of its high-frequency content, making it sound ""older"" than it should, but this is a minor fault since there is no dialogue.  A satisfying version, by VHS standards, made when the video transfer was fairly new, the package having the then-common error of listing Lillian Worth in the cast; she played Queen La in Elmo Lincoln's earlier serial.

Alpha's edition, # ALP 5178D, ASIN: B000HXDEW6 is supplied on a double-layer DVD.  The cover art is fine, with a brief note about Frank Merrill, but the image quality of the transfer is poor.  It appears to have been copied from a monitor screen, with less sharpness than most 1950's Kinescopes.  I can't otherwise explain why the ""head-switch glitch"" would be out of focus, and in the last six minutes of Chapter Fifteen, ""Marker 1"" appears at the top of the screen, as if someone pushed the wrong button on a camera.  Perhaps a ""camera copy"" was done to shrink the image slightly, or to convert from a different video format.  This and/or digital compression also cause odd artifacts, the worst being a ""venetian blind"" pattern where there is rapid movement or a scene change.  If the camera pans, the top and bottom of the picture do not move at the same time, causing not only people to ""shimmy"" but buildings and other solid objects as well.  Alpha puts their logo in the upper-right corner of the credits, and also in the intertitles of the first chapter, which are ""frozen"" frames.  Some tinting has been done, but mostly ""sepia"" and ""red-orange,"" not as imaginative nor as well coordinated with the scenes as Grapevine's.  The patch at the end of Chapter Eleven looks the same as Grapevine's, other than being out of focus.  Unlike the others, the picture is lost for the last minute and a half of Chapter Eight, with only a black screen accompanied by the soundtrack, followed by the ""next week"" title as a frozen frame.  None of this makes Alpha's edition ""unwatchable"" but there is a significant cost in quality for its ""economy.""

As with most serials, a day or more between chapters is advisable since the action tends to be redundant, especially in the later chapters.  A modern video transfer from the film print would help, but of the available editions, Grapevine's is decidedly preferable.",1416528000,7,6098,4.88252427184466
7877172,5,6304523971,"I grew up on the Tarzan movies and TV shows of the late 1960s, so my only nostalgic journeys involved the much more visible Johnny Weismuller TARZAN films. While I loved Tarzan as a kid, it wasn't until a few years ago that I again took interest in the character, rediscovering the Edgar Rice Burroughs novels, and other film variations.

It still boggles my mind that with all of Hollywood's attempts to infuse the Tarzan films with beautiful jungle or explorer girls, that they seldom explored one very notable character, La of the ancient city of Opar. So I did some investigation and learned that La was actually the featured nemesis in the 1928 serial, TARZAN THE TIGER, available in many compilations and discount editions.

I chose to purchase the more expensive two-disk edition and I do not regret it at all. The picture quality is probably as good as it could get, the 15 episodes appear complete, and to be honest, this was one of the most fun Tarzan adventures I ever watched. The animals used are amazing. Frank Merrill, who appears to wear an entire leopard wrapped around his waist, is an otherwise really cool Tarzan. Natalie Kingston is a beautiful and very convincing Jane, and the actress/dancer Kithnou, portrays La of Opar with sinister ease.

Worth the money. Worth the all day Saturday screening in my pajamas with popcorn and endless diet coke. I was so absolutely not let down by this film and by the quality of the DVD.",1394323200,6,1445,4.703557312252965
7877173,4,6304523971,"Frank Merrill looks like a muscleman in this film, a classic Tarzan type.  Good acting by him also.  Too bad his voice was judged not suitable for talking pictures 1-2 years later, or he would have been able to continue as Tarzan.  He was far better built for the role than either Buster Crabbe or Johnny Weissmueller.",1375920000,,318,4.543859649122807
7877174,5,6304523971,"Of all the Tarzan films made before MGM started producing them that I have had a chance to see ""Tarzan the Tiger"" is my favorite.  I seem to prefer the serial format for these films (""Son of Tarzan"" is another excellent example of this) over the feature films like ""Tarzan and the Golden Lion"" that while entertaining is a little to short for my tastes.  ""Tarzan the Tiger"" stars Frank Merrill who is excellent (but a little over dressed) as Tarzan and Natalie Kingston who is also excellent as Jane (who gets to undress a bit in the role).

Based on one of ERB's most popular Tarzan works ""Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar"" which had already been semi filmed once before as the serial ""The Adventures of Tarzan' starring the original screen Tarzan - Elmo Lincoln this is a fast paced adventure that at times makes you forget that you are watching what is essentially a silent film.  Note:  This was actually filmed as a silent film but at the last moment some crude sound effects ans some music was added to it so for the first time Tarzan's victory cry is actually heard on screen.  Just don't expect anything like the more famous MGM yodel.

The serial begins with Tarzan/Lord Greystoke and Lady Jane Greystoke hosting a friend Albert Werper(played by Al Ferguson at their African estate (not a tree house but a land level plantation of sort).  There Tarzan wearing formal evening wear discusses his plans to return to the lost jungle city of Opar in order to raid its treasury with hope of restoring the faltering Greystoke fortune.  Unfortunately Werper is up to no good and hopes to raid Opar for his own gain.  During the course of the adventure Tarzan takes a knock on his head and he loses all memory of Jane reverting back to his pre civilized jungle self.  Werper takes this turn of events as the opportunity to team up with an Arab slave trader and sell Jane into slavery.  Tarzan with his memory still clouded encounters La the Queen of Opar (La is played by an exotic beauty named ""Kithnou"") who wants to bed Tarzan.  Will Tarzan be able to regain his memory, rescue Jane, defeat the villains, resists the charms of La and restore the Greystoke fortune? Of course he will but it will take some 15 exciting chapters to do so.

Merrill rates as my third favorite screen Tarzan, following Herman Brix and Gordon Scott in his last two Tarzan features.  Merrill invented the practice of Tarzan swinging through the jungle on ""vines"" while stunting for Elmo Lincoln in the earlier adaption of ""... and the Jewels of Opar"".  The lovely Kingston is my second favorite screen Jane only topped by Maureen O'Sullivan.  One thing that most be commented on here is that the censorship of the time forced Merrill to wear one of the silliest jungle outfits any Tarzan has ever had to wear (well maybe not more silly than Buster Crabbe's fur thong) covering up most of his muscle toned body from head to toe.  Still the censors allowed Kingston to do a lovely skinny dipping scene that predates O'Sullivan's similar scene from MGM's much later ""Tarzan and His Mate"".

Merrill, Kingston and Ferguson had all appeared in an earlier Tarzan serial ""Tarzan the Mighty"" which I have not had a chance to see where Merrill played Tarzan but both Kingston and Ferguson played different characters.  It is said that Merrill was tapped to star in a third Tarzan serial that would have been the first truly sound Tarzan film but word is that is voice was found to be unsuited to sound productions so the film was scrapped ending his career as the ape man.

I had originally purchased ""Tarzan the Tiger"" from Amazon in the VSH format but because I enjoyed the film so much I bought it again on DVD when it became available in that format. Some may complain about the quality of printed but once again I am very surprised by how view-able these almost 100 year old films are.

There is one question that I must ask about the film.  Why Tarzan the Tiger?  Since tigers are not native to Africa why not Tarzan the Panther or Tarzan the Apeman - that title had not been used yet.",1346803200,,4057,4.548830811554333
7877175,2,6304523971,"The Alpha video release of this serial, Tarzan the Tiger, is a bad transfer from VHS. You can see the flutters, especially if the camera moves. In addition, Alph has put their logo up in the corners of the title cards which is distracting and annoying, especially since anyone wanting to dupe this film has multiple better choices for source material. They ripped it off from someone else, but don't want anyone ripping it off from them, I guess.",1303862400,7,446,4.658227848101266

this is a better movie than Greystoke & based on ERB's Tarzan & the Jewels of Opar. I only hope that whoever directs a new TARZAN film that they read the original books. Now that's Tarzan & the actor should be a gymnast who lifts weights like Gordon Scot & Frank Mirrel.
