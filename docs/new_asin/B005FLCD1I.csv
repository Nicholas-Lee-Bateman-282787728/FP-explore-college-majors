4681610,4,B005FLCD1I,"It is Christmas and Santa's gift delivery is a high-tech operation assisted by the elves. Arthur is his youngest son and is a bit if a misfit helper. After a child is missed during the gift delivery, Arthur sets out to make sure she gets her present. This is a fun movie with excellent animation and very effective 3D. The characters are endearing without pandering too much to the child audience. It also provides children some insight into how Santa is able to deliver gifts to millions of children around the world. The finale has some Christmas magic, and overall, this is a film that both the kids and their parents should enjoy.",1323475200,2,634,4.619469026548672

4681612,4,B005FLCD1I,"Have you ever wondered how it is possible for Santa Claus to have existed since the beginning of time, travel to every child's home in the world in one night, be able to carry all the presents for every child in the world in one sleigh, climb down chimney's and all the while remain unseen? ""Arthur Christmas"" explains it all. When a young British child named Gwen poses all these questions and asks for a particular gift for Christmas, the story of Arthur begins.

Arthur is the second in line to be the next Santa. He works in the Christmas card division of a massive operation that exists on an equally massive spaceship that houses millions of elves and is quite simply perfect. Although on this night, the operation isn't perfect, there is one child that has been missed. Her gift has been lost in the shuffle. Gwen's bicycle was never delivered. So when Santa and Arthur's brother Steve decide that going back to deliver that one present, to that one child, isn't worth the risk of being detected or something going wrong, Arthur resorts to unorthodox measures to make sure that one child isn't disappointed when she wakes in the morning.

""Arthur Christmas"" is an active science fiction technological fun house of events. The ideas and thoughts that went into how Santa can possibly master all of these impossible tasks every Christmas Eve are fun and inventive. It is a light-hearted and perfect movie for anybody wanting to get into the Christmas spirit and it came to the theatres at a perfect time. It isn't a movie with explosive laughs and it mostly plays out like an action movie that is trying to be funny.

""Arthur Christmas"" isn't going to be a classic Christmas movie that everybody is going to want to see every Christmas like ""Rudolph"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""Christmas Vacation"", but for the time being, it's a nice little movie with all the right heart strings and enough creativity to be a memorable Christmas movie for this Christmas, 2011.",1323043200,4,1969,4.718023255813954
4681613,4,B005FLCD1I,"MOVIE NOTE #11: ARTHUR CHRISTMAS I went to see an Academy screening of this new Sony Pictures/Ardmen Production of ""Arthur Christmas"".

Directed by first time animated feaure film director Sarah Smith (mainly noted for her writing and producing of British TV) and co-written by her and her long-time writing partner Peter Baynham (noted for his writting of such films like the new Authur, and the two BORAT films) - they embark on a very very old tale with a very new and exciting twist! Arthur (Voiced by X-Men:First Class's and Gnomeo & Juliet's James McAvoy) is the youngest child of what is now the Santa 'Dynasty'. For generations Santa Claus's yearly duties have been passed down, apparently, from son to son. The next son in line for the current Santa (Voiced by Harry Potter's own Jim Broadbent) is supposed to be Steve (Voiced by the always surprising 'House' star Hugh Laurie who also played Dr. Cockroach in the animated Monster'Vs.'Aliens) - but both Steve and Santa has some real issues - the meaning of Christmas and what Santa really is all about!

The basic plot - SPOILER ALERT - one child is 'missed' - quite by accident - on Christmas Eve. The movie has an excelletly clever opening with the S-1 Santa Sleigh showing you how Santa presently deliveries 2 Billion presents in one night all over the world. The gags, the jokes, the stunts these elves perform are amazingly clever and funny. The traveling concepts from the new ship to the reindeer are also inventive. Then the film does slows down a bit for the first third and was a little thick in Britishisms....but by the 2nd act and completely through the end the film gains a momentous heart! We learn the true meaning of Santa through Arhur and his grumpy yet strainght-to-the-point 'GrandSanta' (his Grandfather voiced by the ever changing voices of Pirates of the Carabbean's own Bill Nighy) There are some great magical dust gags and some hysterical pet moments as well as an incredible heart warming feeling build up that Christmas is not just Santa and presents but that it all comes from the heart - even Santa's.

Also you should note some of the talents voices that also appear as the many Elves in the movie - they include Michael Palin, Robbie Coltrane, Joan Cusack, Andy Serkis and even Eva Longoria as the chief of the Military (yes the world wants to attack Santa because they think he's an alien invasion - that sequence is hysterical) and Laura Linney as the North Pole Computer Voice. An amazingly fun, family and entertaining film - especially for the kids - but adults will walk out with a tear in their eye. Really. In speaking with the production designer Soviet born Evgeni Tomov (who also did the animated film The Tales of Despereaux') and the director - this movie was not intended to be in 3D, but the Studio loved its process and it's production and decided this would be a good 3D addition to their film library. This should definately become a Holiday favorite for DVD families everywhere!",1321747200,27,2990,4.735124760076776

I love the concept of ""Santa Claus"" being a role passed down through one family (Santa's real name is Malcolm, haha), and it plays on a theme that, it doesn't exactly matter WHO puts the gifts under the tree, it's still ""Santa"" if you believe it is. This will make it easier for my kids to understand when it comes time to have the Santa talk. It also answered a lot of current questions/doubts (like, how can one man be thousands of years old? Or, how can Santa go unseen?). Very cute movie.",1512864000,,587,4.444444444444445

It is difficult to follow the dialogue because of the English accent.
The producer or director must have thought that having the animation all

in the Christmas Carol.",1512691200,,360,4.553846153846154

In fact, I love Christmas. I've garnered something of a reputation to that end. Years ago, I was looking for something ""Christmasy"" to watch and this happened to be airing on ABC Family on Christmas night.

I was already grown at that point. In fact, I was watching it beside my wife in our house. I loved it. I watch it every year and enjoy it just as much, year after year. It's bursting at the seams with charm, humor, and that holiday magic I'm always looking for in movies and TV specials.

4681679,4,B005FLCD1I,"Arthur Christmas is the son of santeeclaws. Arthur is a gangly clumsy accident-prone son who loves his family and believes in the spirit of Christmas, that spirit being that no child should be left with the impression that they're not cared about and every child deserves a gift that shows them that they are loved. Hes not about the form of Christmas like his older type A personality brother Steve who runs the family business like clockwork through high-tech factory innovation, precision timing, and a horde of workforce employees (elves). Steve is next in line to take the mantle of Santa from dad and doesnt care so much about the spirit of Christmas but about the form so when one little girl isn't going to get her present due to a malfunction in the routine Steve doesnt particularly care. If 999,999,999 kids are going to have a toy successfully delivered to them out of a billion kids then whats one kid, right? Thats Steves attitude. Its unfortunate but the numbers are still good! But thats not how Arthur sees it and he sets out on a bumbling quest to make sure that little girl gets her gift and knows that he hasn't been forgotten, that she is cared for. But will Arthurs clumsiness put the whole operation in jeopardy?

This is a nice and fun little animated Christmas-themed movie. While it doesnt have any of the specifically religious trappings of Christmas Christians could see in Arthurs heart the same type of care that Jesus described in the parable of the good shepherd who goes off and finds the one sheep who wanders off. The production is a British one and it has a mild English feel to it and that may add a little interest to a North American audience. Things do go about as youd expect them to in this sort of movie and I found all of the characters likable or relatable except for grandpa (himself a former Santa Claws, now a bit of a crazy old coot). Its a Christmas movie that I won't mind turning back to every few years or so at that most special time of the year.",1491523200,,2000,4.4945054945054945

4681741,4,B005FLCD1I,"Charming, non-stop, diverse, heart-warming.  Also slaved to the standard Hollywood formula (Hero's Journey; semi-trustworthy mentor; sacrifice; redemption) -- but it's a pretty good formula.  :)  Explicitly avoids the real meaning of Christmas (indeed all the protagonists seem themselves ignorant of it), which is a pity.  Also, there's a fair bit of ""family dysfunction"" -- be advised -- but this is indeed part of the arc and does mostly get addressed.  But just as filmmaking, it's very solid.  No lags in the story; good setups; snappy dialogue when needed; silence and ""pure acting"" the rest of the time.  Fun twists; lots of colorful locales; tons of verbal and visual gags.  Lots of ""cool factor""; but doesn't get dazzled by its own technical prowess: quite the reverse, in fact.  In sum: right up there with Aardman's ""Chicken Run.""",1482969600,,841,5.125

4681786,5,B005FLCD1I,"What would happen if a child was missed on Christmas? Well you can find out what will happen in this movie? While i have never owned this movie, the last how many years I would put it down as rental on Netflix. And it has an interesting cast list, that includes some people that have been in the Harry Potter movies. Which make you wonder and answers the question, with millions of kids that Santa Claus has to visit every year around the world, what would happen if one gets missed and even accidentally? Do you just give up right away or just get in the window. The movie opens with Arthur (James McAvoy) reading a letter from a child named Gwen Hines (Ramona Marquez) who wrote him a letter with questions and her request for a pink bike, which he responds to and finishes that Santa will find his way to her using his special magic. So the movie films to Christmas Eve with Arthur's father is Santa Claus who's name is Malcolm (Jim Broadbent) is on his 70th mission, and his older brother Steve (Hugh Laurie) is back at the north pole in charge of the options back and the north pole, and his hoping that his father is planning to announce his retirement as Santa and hand the job to him as his successor. Arthur barges in to inform him off a letter, where things go wrong and Steve requests to stand out of headquarters for the rest of the evening. Upon his completion of his 70th mission Malcolm returns to the North Pole, and makes a mention that his father Grandsanta (Bill Nighy) that held the job before told him that he would love the job, and says he is right and he can't wait for year 71. But his father is bored with his retirement and hates the modern way on how Malcolm completes his job as Santa Claus and hopes to have him be his new chairman. And can you believe he is at 136 years of age, but then it is not like the Claus daily ever dies. Malcolm spends the rest of the evening with his family which includes dinner, where Arthur presents a game to play. Which leads into a fight between Steve and Malcolm and zSteve is not happy with the news that he plans to do the job, instead of banding him the job the following Christmas. And that is where Grandasanta vents his furstions, which at the same evening a elf named Bryony (Ashley Jensen) finds a Christmas present that was accidentally missed which is a bicycle. And gets it to Steve's attention while still at the table with family, which he leaves to find out what is wrong, and along with Arthur. Which they both discover the gift as well, and they have no idea who the gift is to. And Steve gives up hope of it getting to the child by Christmas morning, and makes a plan of it getting to the child in the window of Christmas. And Arthur wants to find any way to get it there by Christmas morning, and when he returns to the letters department he discovers the gift is to Gwen that he had answered her letter. And of course both Malcolm and his wife Margaret Claus (Imelda Staunton) find out as well, and when is bedtime she presents him her gift to him, takes off the tag, and gives it back to her as his gift, and he has to go to bed with a sign on the door to not disturb until December 26th. Well Arthur still not happy about the results, and when GrandaSanta finds out about the missed gift he presents his plan on getting it to Gwen by using the old sleigh that had been retired with distant reindeer to the reindeer to pull the sleight. What will happen next that is where I will leave for you to find out on your own.",1481932800,,3503,4.237668161434978
4681787,4,B005FLCD1I,"I admit, I'm a sucker for Christmas movies, especially those featuring Santa Claus.  Despite the pre-existing mythology surrounding this figure, there's so much that can be done with this concept and with the trappings surrounding everyone's favorite man in red.  And while it's early yet to call ""Arthur Christmas"" a classic holiday movie -- it's nowhere near as popular and beloved as other classics such as ""A Christmas Story"" and ""The Santa Clause"" -- it's a cute and genuinely funny film that isn't afraid to play with and modernize Santa Claus, his North Pole home, and everything else that accompanies him.

""Arthur Christmas"" follows its title character, Arthur, one of Santa Claus' two sons who helps run the base of operations at the North Pole.  For Christmas has become such a massive affair that it can no longer be accomplished with a single reindeer-driven sleigh -- rather, it takes a massive starship, thousands of elite elves who infiltrate homes ""Mission-Impossible"" style to leave gifts, and a great deal of modern technology to pull the feat off.  But while Santa serves as a figurehead for the operation and Arthur's older brother, Steve, handles the logistics and technological work, he mostly spends his time answering childrens' letters to Santa, and being seen as a sentimental klutz by the elves.  But when a single child's gift slips through the cracks and isn't delivered on Christmas Eve -- and Steve writes it off as a glitch -- Arthur decides it's up to him, with some help from his long-retired grandfather and a gift-wrapping specialist elf named Bryony, to deliver the gift and make sure every child has a perfect Christmas.

The animation in this film is handled by Aardman Studios, better-known for their stop-motion cartoons such as ""Wallace and Gromit"" and ""Chicken Run.""  Though this film is in CGI rather than stop-motion, and is quite visually different from """"Wallace and Gromit,"" it's still a cute and charming style, smoothly animated and with rich colors and textures throughout.  Some of the elves can look a little creepy up close, but that's a minor complaint.

The writing and characters... well, this IS a Christmas movie, and you know it can't get TOO dark or disappoint young viewers.  But it does maintain a nice pace throughout, and maintains a great sense of humor throughout.  It isn't afraid to poke a little fun at its own subject matter, and point out (while at the same time trying to explain) some of the implausibilities of Santa Claus and his mission to deliver gifts to every child in the world.  And its characters are delightful, with Arthur himself being adorable and upbeat and his grandfather a snarky old soul who isn't afraid to speak his mind.  Santa himself comes across as a bit doddering and forgetful, but still has his warm side, and while Steve seems cold and overly ambitious enough to easily be a villain in another movie (he IS voiced by Hugh Laurie a.k.a. ""Dr. House,"" after all), the movie opts NOT to make him out to be the villain, and even he is shown to have his warm moments.

While it is ultimately silly and more light-hearted entertainment than an instant classic, ""Arthur Christmas"" is still an enjoyable holiday movie.  It's funny, sweet, and visually impressive, having fun with its central concept of ""how DOES Santa do it?"" and being funny without descending into toilet humor and innuendo.  Great for nearly all ages.",1481932800,,3415,4.901041666666667

4681987,4,B005FLCD1I,"Bought this movie to add to my daughter's library of movies for when we travel as it offered the digital copy. The movie itself was interesting and kept my daughter's attention (2 1/2 years old) through the movie. I'm not going to go through the plot or story as others have done that in their reviews. I have to say, while we travel, I'm not sure if she's going to choose this movie but it is a good mix to have during the holiday season as she is starting to understand the concept of Santa Claus.

I did want to point out my experience with the UV Digital code as this may help others that have issues. I first tried to enter the code and on the flyer it says it was expired. I tried the code several times and noticed the expiration date. Not happy about this, I went to the website and tried to initiate the chat with Sony which I never got anyone on it (waiting 15-20 minutes). I searched on their site and found this number: 800-860-2878. I called it and the representative was super friendly and said they extended the codes so they don't expire yet. I gave her my code and she said it was still valid. I entered the code and it worked at that time. I would say if you run into any issues with the code, you might want to call the number as they are really friendly. I'm not taking any stars away from the movie as it was pretty good and kept my daughter's attention. I wouldn't say I love it because there are other movies I know she really enjoyed and you could tell because she would ask for them for days in a row.

I hope this review helps someone. Happy Shopping!",1449792000,,1577,4.167213114754098

My husband didn't care for it due to the English accent (or his inability to hear in general) and the story-line. The kids all liked it enough to add it to the movie list and one of them has included this among his favorites (along with Alvin and the Chipmunks and Ice Age).

*Side Note: We use December to do a lot of family activities including movie nights, baking, crafting, and excursions (ice skating, checking out Christmas lights, etc...). This has created a new, flexible tradition for our family that allows us to change and be creative every year but still have the timeless joy and wonder of the season.

4682010,5,B005FLCD1I,"When this movie came out a few years ago I blew it off as just another lame Christmas movie. Fast forward to this year and I still had not seen it. A friend sent me a link for it when it was on sale and I bought it to watch during our Christmas movie marathon. This movie is fantastic. I wish I would have bought it when it first came out. The characters are quirky and funny. The dialogue is witty, and yes sometimes corny. The story is cute. Good wins at the end of the day... Or the beginning of the day as the case may be. I see a lot of myself in the character of Arthur. He is a big goober and nothing he does is right, but what he believes is important to him and he is willing to risk everything to do the right thing. He ventures out into the world for basically the first time to make sure one little girl gets her gift from Santa after Santa forgot her. Santa and Arthur's older brother both go to bed instead of going back for her. In the end they all try to get the gift to the little girl and everyone makes mistakes. They all end up seeing the good in Arthur where no one had seen him as anything but a misfit before. The story has charm and character. This movie is on my list of movies to watch every year.

I bought this at full price for my own use.",1448668800,8,1268,3.9147286821705425

4682076,5,B005FLCD1I,"This is not only my all time favorite Christmas movie. It's my favorite all time movie. Period. Like most white American kids growing up, Christmas was key component of my childhood. It absolutely nails just what Christmas was about for me as a child, and judging by the response this movie has, it has captured the same thing for many others.
This movie is also a marvel in terms of its writing. Not only is it filled with dozens of very funny one liners, but I am also amazed at how well every piece of the story fits together. Every one of the major characters are well drawn out with flaws and is one of those great stories that doesn't need a villain. You can understand where every character is coming from and everyone gets a well deserved happy ending.
There is so much about Christmas that this movie gets right. It addresses the stress that people go through trying to make Christmas happen. It is clever the way it separates the actual character(s) of Santa, and the idea behind why Santa exists. The flying scenes on the sleigh are gorgeous. It perfectly showshow Santa Claus and Christmas has changed over the years.
It is also a great road trip story with a clearly defined location the heroes much reach. What makes a road trip story great, is getting behind a character in their drive to reach the location, and watching everything conceivable thing get in their way. It builds to the perfect level of absurdity and desperation that makes the eventual arrival of the destination so gratifying. The ending as well is as perfect and moving as any ending can be and moved me to tears multiple times.
If I had to nit pick to find flaws in the movie, it would be in two minor characters: Cheif De Silva (The leader of the U.N.) and Mrs. Claus. De Silva seems a touch out of place, and not entirely necessary to the story. However her scenes lead to several good jokes so I'm willing to let it slide. With Mrs. Santa, she is written and voiced fine, but what I think holds her back is the animation. She's the most restrained of the characters which I think lead to some difficulty portraying her through animation. Additionally animation I'll admit is not quite Pixar quality, but the characters and settings are so well designed, as far as I'm concerned, that does not matter.
Basically this film, serves as both as an incredible story in its own right, and is sublime to those who know anything about Christmas.",1428192000,,2424,4.549199084668192

4682194,5,B005FLCD1I,This is such a clever twist on Santa Clause and the voice talent is fantastic. James McAvoy (future Oscar winner) gives Arthur a very sincere yet off beat personality. I will watch this with my kids everyear.,1418515200,,208,4.648648648648648
4682195,5,B005FLCD1I,"Santa is real! You knew it in your heart. He lives at the North Pole in an underground complex, the position of Santa being passed down from father to son. In the hallway is a long line of portraits, starting with ""Santa Claus the First 295-369 AD"", through a line including ""Santa Claus the Thirteenth 1549-1634"" and so on. The last portrait is of ""Santa Claus the Twentieth 1941- _"".  It has no end date because he still holds the position.

But this may be his last year. It's traditional to retire and pass the baton after 70 years. This Santa has two sons. The younger, Arthur, is adorable, happy and enthusiastic, but too bumbling to be trusted with anything other than answering Letters to Santa.

The elder brother, Steve, has totally upgraded the Christmas Eve procedure. The sleigh and reindeer have been retired in favor of a giant airship with a cloaking device (whoo hoo!) and well-trained Field Elf Battalions. It is a wonderful imagining of how Santa delivers toys to every child in the world on a single night.

But this Christmas Eve, after everyone is back to Mission Control and Operation Toy is ""Mission Accomplished"", an elf named Briony finds that one toy was missed. There's a child in Cornwall who will not have a gift from Santa! Arthur is beside himself, but Steve is firm. It's 5:10 am, and there's no way to get the toy in place before sunrise: ""Arthur. Christmas is not a time for emotion. We will get 4 double 7 85BXK a present... in the window of Christmas. We'll messenger the item - it will be there in 5 days.""

This isn't good enough for Arthur. With his cantakerous GrandSanta (retired) they pull the sleigh out of mothballs and make sure Christmas comes true for every last child.

This is a great Christmas story with your usual feel-good vibe and ending. Steve is not an evil bad guy, he is merely focused on his military-like procedures and his 99.999999% success rate for the year.

There is so much humor in this movie. Such as when GrandSanta is not impressed with Steve's smugness: ""Christmas 1941, WWII, I did the whole thing with six reindeer and a drunken elf.""

Meanwhile, Steve is checking his messages on his HO-HO (like a phone) such as this one:
""You looked great today.
Siri""

""Arthur Christmas"" premiered in 2011, 97 minutes of animated fun. The voice acting is top of the line, with Hugh Laurie (""House"") as Steve, James McAvoy as Arthur, Jim Broadbent as Santa and a cackling Bill Nighy as GrandSanta.

The DVD is presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen and 5.1 Dolby Digital. You can listen to the movie, or watch with subtitles, in three languages: English, French or Spanish.

The DVD also has 3 Special Features which are fun to watch.
1. ""Un-Wrapping Arthur Christmas"" (13 minutes) Just about everyone involved as cast or crew has a say in this making-of featurette. Bill Nighy says, ""It was one of the best scripts I've read for a long time.""
2. ""Progressive Reels"" (15 minutes total) This is a look at five different aspects of the movie. I particularly enjoyed the animation people taking us through the initial ""Invasion Sequence"", where we follow a troop of elves delivering toys. ""The camera style in this sequence was heavily from the Cinma Vrit, a run and gun style of filmmaking."" What is was was just like an action movie.
3. ""Elf Recruitment Video"" (1 minute) A cute trailer.
""They are the world's most elite team.
On the Single
Largest
Covert Mission
EVER.""

Very recommended family Christmas movie!

This movie is now officially in our holiday movie rotation and I am sure that it will be for years to come.  Just make sure and watch the price on this online.  It will vary a lot throughout the year... but we managed to get the blu-ray/DVD/digital package for under $10 just by keeping it in our watch list and checking on it from time to time.,1401667200,,614,4.258620689655173

4682322,2,B005FLCD1I,"Arthur Christmas is based on the idea that Santa Claus is a title that is passed down from father to son through the generations of a family.  Much of the conflict in the film is based on the competing egos of the current Santa, his eldest son (the militant, efficient heir apparent), Grand Santa (the doddering old retired Santa), and sweet, innocent Arthur, the youngest son.  The film has a lot of fun exploring how a modern Santa achieves the miracle of visiting all the kids around the world in one night (similar to the fun in Prep and Landing, but not nearly as charming).

What drove me nuts about this movie is that the Santas are all TERRIBLE, self-absorbed people.  There's no charm or wonder or magic to the Santas in this film, just pettiness, rivalry, and a heavy dose of idiocy.  Even Grand Santa, the Santa who should be the most magical because he did the job without the benefit of any modern technology, is a heartless jerk.  He still tends the reindeer and swears that the flying sleigh is better than the UFO that the current Santa is using.  But when Grand Santa takes the sleigh out and loses his reindeer, he doesn't care at all.  They're just props to him, there for the benefit of his ego and nothing more.

Don't see this.  Watch Rise of the Guardians.  Watch Prep & Landing.  Watch the old Rankin Bass Christmas specials, A Charlie Brown Christmas, or even Gift of the Night Fury.  But don't waste your time and Christmas spirit with this cynical dreck.",1395187200,3,1481,4.522556390977444

4682333,3,B005FLCD1I,A decent Children's movie.  In my opinion the story wasn't as good as Finding Nemo...but better than Cars.  So if you enjoyed Finding Nemo and liked Cars less...then this movie might fall in the middle for you as well.,1391904000,,218,4.564102564102564

I obviously wish there was more about Jesus, but with that aside this movie is amazing.  There is underlying Christian tones, which works for me.  This movie is hilarious like Shrek.  It's made in partnership with a British company which explains why it wasn't huge in the US.",1391904000,,373,4.426470588235294

4682336,5,B005FLCD1I,"Of all the Xmas movies out there, this instantly became one of our family's favorites. The main character, Arthur, is funny but not over-the-top. The dynamics between the characters are not too slapstick, often relying on clever lines rather than insults.

In all, if you've not seen this movie and have kids, it's well worth adding to your collection.",1391644800,,352,4.966101694915254
4682337,5,B005FLCD1I,"This was a surprise because I'm the ""Christmas"" fanatic in the family, I can't get too much on every level, get that tree up by Thanksgiving, and it doesn't come down till Epiphany. My grandson, 4, introduced me to this and laughed his head off through most of it. I admit I needed to watch it twice before I was able to catch all the adorable asides and visual details that I missed with raucous grandchildren around.

This was a labor or love, in the writing, the ""updated"" Christmas vs traditional Santa and Christmas, it has enormous heart and a poignancy that is never maudlin or contrived. There are so many layers of humor, memory-imagery, visual superlatives that I find I see or hear something new each time I see it. (Yes, I am one of those who can watch Christmas movies regardless of time of year).

Of all the creatively handled characters, with their often broad accents, many British or Irish, my grandson adores the present-wrapping elf (Briony?) and I soon realised why. Although there are multiple themes and story lines many of the elves are given specific characteristics and mannerisms, but none as charming and endearing as the wrapping elf. Personally I found Grandsanta the most amusing, but then as an adult this character is one of the pivots between story lines and as such as an adult I found him an often hysterical connection.

Very well made, and as I said, with such heart and warmth that one feels like they have been cuddled for 90 minutes with their own grandma in a nice comfy chair.",1391385600,,1519,4.639405204460966

4682380,5,B005FLCD1I,"Super cute and very sweet.  Grand Santa is a little rough around the edges, but it adds to his charm since he's mostly just silly and loveable. I think it's rated PG because of a scene where the military thinks the sleigh is a UFO and there's a little fighter jet scene with missiles and an explosion. But it's all pretty light and mild and everyone is safe in the end. I don't recall any rude, obnoxious, disrespectful characters/ conversations or any name calling or anything like that.  I like that the makers of this didn't resort to bathroom humor or rude characters for laughs.  No innuendo for the parents or inside jokes for parents either.  The concept and characters are all very sweet, adorable, and creative.  A new family favorite for us.",1388361600,,751,4.616541353383458

Firstly, the price was very reasonable, just about 5 bucks I believe. The quality of the Dvd was great as well. The overall plot for this movie was unique. I never really see Christmas movies that are so modern or high-tech. It's enjoyable for adults and children.",1388188800,,407,4.666666666666667

I can see some of the content being inappropriate for younger viewers, but older children (7+) will be able to follow the underlying plot and shouldl be able to enjoy the movie beyond the graphic effects and mostly hilarious characters.  I cannot recommend the movie for younger children due to the content of the story line which is the only reason I dropped a star.  Christmas movies should be able to be shared as a family, and if that excludes the little ones then it is missing the idea.",1388102400,2,577,4.528846153846154

It is fun for adults as well as kids. My wife has watched this before and saw and heard ""new things"" because it has a lot of dialogue and action.

The story was very engaging with enough of the new/old take on Christmas for kids of all ages to enjoy.
Many of the characters do have UK accents which can be hard to follow even for adults as the characters talk very fast at times.

4682400,5,B005FLCD1I,"British humor and pronunciation aside, this is a universally fun and entertaining Christmas film.  The beautifully animated film is about the Christmas family.  Malcolm (Jim Broadbent) Christmas (the current Santa), assisted by his eldest, Steve (Hugh Laurie) who is a perfectionist and efficiency czar.  Malcolm's other son, Arthur (James McAvoy) works in the letter/mail department is seen as a bit of a sentimentalist and accident-prone.  However, when it is discovered that one child has been missed, the fun begins.  This is a beautiful tale of tradition and progress, family versus business and the meaning of gifting.  I enjoyed this and will make this a part of my Christmas viewing tradition.

The movie feels like a modern tale with enough sentimentalism and tradition evident to touch the heart. Also, there is a lot of British humor which I happen to like.  Enjoy this modern Christmas tale for the family.",1387843200,,918,5.155405405405405

The ""Santa"" family is delighftul and the concept of Santa in the 21st century delivering gifts via a space ship was great fun, though grandsanta showed that the ""old"" ways had merit.  Hearfilled story too of making sure no child is forgotten at Christmas",1387065600,,319,4.660714285714286

4682425,5,B005FLCD1I,"I bought this movie for my 6 year old, but I think I enjoy it more than she does.  One of the more appealing aspects of this movie is that it is such a good movie for the whole family to watch, and doesn't feel like it has to stoop to ""potty humor"" to keep the kids engaged, nor does it have to put in a lot of thinly disguised ""adults-only"" jokes to keep the grown-ups entertained.  Also there is no real ""villain"" in the movie, and nothing that will scare little kids out of their wits.  The ending, where the torch is finally passed from the old Santa to the new is a very heartwarming scene, and a great climax to a very charming story.  My only complaint is the voice actors can be a little difficult to understand at times, especially the gift-wrapping elf.  Still it's a movie deserving of 5 stars in my opinion, and will be likely be watched several times in our house every Christmas season for years to come.",1386547200,,918,4.222857142857142

4682461,4,B005FLCD1I,"I viewed this over the weekend, twice, and enjoyed it quite a bit. It's smart and kinda British in its cultural values and style. I am an American but am accustomed to British entertainment in movies, radio plays, and TV shows; I found it easy to watch, and got all the ""in"" jokes, I think.

This movie is based on a family of Santas who have the hereditary title passed down through the male line of the family. The family is obviously intended not as an ideal family, but simply as a normal family with normal family dynamics that children in the UK would be familiar with. This makes it nicely accessible for them.

The energy of the story is very good, the characterizations strong and funny, and the ideas engaging. Visuals outstanding. I embrace this movie's contribution to the Christmas movie canon.

What didn't I like? All the elder Santas were very self-centered, and that was a little jarring (too much like ordinary people, sadly), and there was no concern for the fate of the reindeer team. Even in an animated film, I find carelessness toward animals disturbing. That I would change, for a fact, were I re-making this movie! It doesn't have to be saccharine, just some kind of reasonable sop to the conscience; children and adults both need that, I think.

It still succeeds, though, even with the perceived flaws. In the end, the self-centered older men get a waking-up for themselves, get it together as a family, and resolve their crisis in a way that embraces them as adult men with a sense of justice. I find it a strong creative effort and worth your time. If you are worried about it, watch it before your kids do, and make up your own mind. Frankly, I think it is a future classic. Let's call it a modern take on things!",1370822400,,1743,4.54140127388535
4682462,5,B005FLCD1I,"I haven't seen it but everyone I have spoken to said this was the go to movie for something funny without the usual stuff cartoons are filled of today, like moms dying or death, or more death or trying to save the world while you are still to young to drive. They say it is refreshing and a relief in this day and age. Hope that helps.",1370822400,,335,4.014925373134329

4682474,5,B005FLCD1I,"I guess I am not on top of things as I should be, but I saw this movie about 2 months ago and knew I had to make it one of my Christmas favorites.

Arthur, the bumbling younger brother of Steven Claus just can't get a break...until one child is missed.  It is a hoot to see just what Arthur, GrandSanta and a wrapping elf named Bryony Shelfly go thru to accomplish their mission!

You will absolutely love this movie!",1366329600,,417,4.1875
4682475,5,B005FLCD1I,This movie is the funniest cartoon movie. The writing for this movie is great. Humerous yet good story and lessons,1366329600,,114,4.75

4682481,3,B005FLCD1I,"I chose this rating because, I bought this after watching it at a movie. I can tolerate it, but since my great grandkids love it I have had to look for excuses not to watch it again and again, and again. So I think it is rather suitable for them. I really wish I had chosen to buy a little closer to Christmas, but I don't think it was available then. In may have been but I really don't think it was our that it was well out of my price range at that time. But, I did like it.",1363219200,,477,3.78
4682482,3,B005FLCD1I,It is quite okay entertainment although the storyline is a bit thick and also boring in between. Of course the animation is very good and in 3D very realistic,1363219200,,158,4.482758620689655
4682483,5,B005FLCD1I,"I saw this film in the theater not expecting to love it as much as I did. It can be compared to Disney's ""Prep & Landing,"" but they are different. This has that wonderful British humor that I love and the story is heartwarming. It is a new Christmas must for our family.",1363219200,,270,4.113207547169812

4682485,5,B005FLCD1I,"Sweet, innocent, child-like Arthur is not respected around the north pole. His older brother is expected to step up and take the role of Santa when their father retires, but, a child has been missed. How will it be handled? Does anyone care? Is this truly important? Should Santa be concerned with such a minor number as 1 missed out of so many successful deliveries all over the world?

Watch and see what happens. A very fun adventure!",1362873600,,437,4.602564102564102

4682488,5,B005FLCD1I,"When I first saw a preview for Arthur Christmas I thought it looked pretty stupid. After being dragged to see it I was pleasantly surprised. It's not your usual ""Christmas is ruined and we have to fix it!"" stories. All of the kids in the world receive their presents from millions of Santa's elves in Santa's high tech airship, except for one who was missed, which is where the whole storyline starts. Young Arthur has to prove to his father, Santa, that he is worthy enough to become the next Santa. The plot is very exciting the entire way through and at no moment did it drag. Kids and adults will like every bit of this movie, especially since it doesn't really throw the sappy Christmas stuff at you like every other Christmas movie. Definitely a must have for any avid movie-goer or Christmas lover.",1362614400,,805,4.558620689655172

4682490,3,B005FLCD1I,"Seller was great, but this tale of Christmas was awful in many ways. If you don't want a spoiler, don't read, but Christmas now comes from an ""alien"" sort of ship delivered by thousands of odd looking elves and Santa is just ""in charge"" - an old sort of ""out of it"" guy. It is not a classic I will want to watch again. There were terrible moments that made me want to cry. How is that a happy Christmas?",1362096000,2,403,4.05

4682512,5,B005FLCD1I,"This was much more fun than I was thinking it would have been when I went to see it in the theater.  I liked the cute little story of Papa Santa stepping down to let his son take the reigns per say.  When the oldest son forgets that the children are the point of all the military operation that Christmas has become it falls to the scrawny younger brother to save the day.  With a positive attitude, his heart in the right place and a little help from Grandpa Santa the crazyness ensues.

4682521,3,B005FLCD1I,Rented this for Christmas and found that Christmas and Santa could bungle just about everything. The jealous son who would be Santa. The turmoil within the North Pole! Brother I didn't sign on for this! Any Who its okay.,1359504000,,220,4.666666666666667

4682533,2,B005FLCD1I,"My wife and I wanted to like Arthur Christmas, but the movie lacked the heart that all great Christmas movies have. None of the Santas were likable, in fact they were downright selfish. It could be hard to explain to a child why 3 of the Santas didn't care about missing one child at Christmas.

The jokes aren't funny, the voice acting is so-so, and the story is a bit ridiculous. Pass on this one and watch ""It's A Wonderful Life"" for the umpteenth time instead.",1359158400,,464,4.395348837209302

4682536,5,B005FLCD1I,My grandson (Age 4) loved this movie...as did the adults that watched it with him.  Its a cute story about the history of Santa Claus and the generations of different Santas that have worn the suit and the efforts of the youngest Claus in his attempt to deliver a forgotton bike to a child on Christmas morning.  Very entertaining for everyone.,1359072000,,344,4.622950819672131

4682538,2,B005FLCD1I,"We found this film heavy on what we felt was (for lack of a better expression), an excess of English (as in UK/GBR) sentiment and cultural norms and memes. This made it difficult for my 7 year old to enjoy...and made it a challenge for the adult audience as well.  Some nice twists on the usual ""Santa is real and uses technology"" and ""every child deserves christmas presents,"" themes. My daughter rated a ""Meh, daddy. Just...meh.""",1358812800,2,431,4.671052631578948

4682542,5,B005FLCD1I,"We got drawn in and watched it too, too many times during the holidays. This is a classic that will be around for many years. Even when your kids become ""teenagers"" and ""hate everything"" traditional, you will be able to draw them into the entertainment room ""just one more time"" every year.",1358553600,,290,4.596153846153846
4682543,5,B005FLCD1I,Its nice to know that everyonce in a while it's still possible to find a movie that is good positive viewing for the whole family. The wife and i also had a good time while watching . Great for the friday nite special.,1358553600,,218,4.093023255813954

4682545,5,B005FLCD1I,"This is a new favorite for my family.  My sons love all the action, elves, animals, and such.  My wife and I love the more subtle humor that is above the kids' heads(nothing inappropriate however).

Minor Spoilers:

This movie has a whole new take on Santa where the role is passed on from generation to generation.  I find this very interesting as in most recent Santa lore, he and the elves are immoratal or have exteremely long lifespans.  I won't ruin the plot, just a minor detail that stands out to me.

Do yourself a favor and at least rent this one.  That is what we did and then went and bought it a day later.",1358467200,,619,4.275862068965517
4682546,5,B005FLCD1I,"I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE IT WAS A DIFFERENT SANTA CLAUS MOVIE , ALTHOUGH IT DID SHOW HOW SELFISH SOME OF THE CHARACTERS WERE IT ALSO SHOWED HOW 1 PERSON CAN REALLY CARE ABOUT ANOTHER . IT SHOWED MY KIDS HOW A PERSON CAN BE GOOD WITHOUT EXPECTING ANYTHING IN RETURN",1358294400,,265,4.215686274509804
4682547,4,B005FLCD1I,"We love the classics, but this year we thought we'd look for something a little newer to enjoy. Always wary of innuendo and dragging down Christmas, we thought this story was really adventurous and fun and the outlandish possibilities of highly trained elves - akin to high-level military operative training (sorry for the semi-spoiler) - was fun and so unbelievable that even the kids took it for what it we believe it was intended; an impossible ride through a visually interesting, fun, and funny movie that makes you feel like a winner at the end.",1358294400,,551,4.810526315789474
4682548,5,B005FLCD1I,The movie was entertaining . A great movie for the younger generation. Funny even a bit silly at times but at least it was a good clean movie.,1358208000,,142,4.107142857142857

4682551,4,B005FLCD1I,"was pleasantly surprised with this film. as an american, have a tendency to think of Santa Claus with an American accent. But the British slant worked well in this movie. (And better that than a Dutch-accent in English for Sinterklaus.) The family aspect works well in the frame of the gift-giving season. The only think I kept on wondering is what happens to the females of the family... If I ever watch this with my niece/daughter/friend's kids, I'm going to need to think of a good answer.....",1358121600,,496,4.712643678160919

I'm always on the lookout for a new contender. There are a lot of movies that pertain to Christmas, but many of them aren't appealing to anyone beyond the age of 3-5. This one can be enjoyed by all ages. Wonderful animation and an appealing story, with good ""acting"" by the voice actors. This will definitely be in the annual rotation from now on.",1358121600,,499,4.555555555555555

Having no kids, I can't critique it as a parent, but personally, I completely enjoyed it as an adult. Put on your ""Scottish ears"" for the elf or put on the subtitles if you can't quite catch what she's saying.  I would use ""heart-warming,"" except that might scare off some people - the crotchety ""grandsanta"" nicely off-sets any saccharine tendencies.  Watch it twice, at least. You'll appreciate it more each time.",1357948800,,515,4.7

Note that it is an English/American collaborative production, and the writing and humor definitely seems to lean on the dry British side, much like Wallace and Grommit. I also picked up on a couple of lines that might be a tiny bit ethinically objectionable (stereotyping) in the US market. But overall it's a good addition to your holiday film library.",1356825600,2,436,5.069444444444445

4682627,5,B005FLCD1I,"I enjoyed the idea that santa claus was a hereditary ""monarchy"" that was continued by a reigning Santa selecting his heir. Arthur appeared to be the least likely to win the ""throne"" considering his competition is his incredibly innovative and effective brother Steve.  But Steve lacks an essential trait that his younger brother has...empathy for the children they serve.  How this realization is made is a clever and often hysterical story.",1356739200,,441,5.197183098591549

4682632,3,B005FLCD1I,"OK, let's separate the review about the movie from the product (i.e., the physical disks and digital copy). The movie is GREAT! I would give it 5 stars if it's just about the movie. However, the digital copy distribution through the new UltraViolet (UV) channel totally sucks. I have to open 3 different online accounts (yes, you read that right, 3 different accounts) to achieve the simple task of being able to watch the digital copy on my iPad. I have to open first the SONY Entertainment Account to redeem the digital copy code, a separate UV account to link my digital copy on my SONY account to UV, and finally a Flixster App account on my iPad to finally be able to retrieve the digital copy to my iPad. Along the way many times the websites crashed, were very slow to respond, or were totally confusing to follow. It took me close to an hour to finally figure out how to get my digital copy. The whole process is totally unintuitive to me. I wonder how many other consumers just gave up trying to get the digital copy they paid for? Why do the paying customers have to jump through so many hoopla to get to the digital copies?",1356739200,,1134,4.404761904761905
4682633,3,B005FLCD1I,"This is a cute family movie that is full of heart and well placed humor. My 13 year old daughter and I enjoyed watching it with many LOL and Awww moments! My husband fell asleep in the first five minutes, however. There were three or four times where they actually use phrases and songs that belong to Jesus and name Santa instead. The oldest son sarcastically sings ""Glory in the Highest"" to his dad (who is santa) as a slap in the face in front of all the elves as he arrogantly walks out on his dad. That was done in very poor taste. Without the slams on God, I would' e rated this movie higher.",1356739200,,598,4.163793103448276
4682634,5,B005FLCD1I,"This one was great to watch with the kid. The action is lively, the plot is fun, and the main characters are likable. But it's not the kind of film where you're going to expect anything all that original (other than the humor), or an ending you don't see coming a mile away.

It's a really simple plot. During a routine Christmas run Santa forgets to deliver a bike. Cue the chaos as Santa's inept son steals an old sleigh to travel across the world to deliver it before the sun rises.

It is what it is. I liked the corporate take on the whole Santa Clause mythology, and I liked how they put together the family dynamic. I was left wondering the hows and whys about the elves, but maybe some things are better left unexplained.

Over all though, I felt like it was one of the best family oriented action flicks I've seen in a long time. Will watch it again with the kid next year.",1356652800,,882,4.238095238095238

It is refreshing to see a new story without sitting through another remake of an already good movie. The idea in making movies is to intreague the watcher of the movie, not bore him/her into a sleeping stuper, or so much fire and action you forgot where the story was headed in the first place.

4682687,3,B005FLCD1I,"First of all, if you're not used to British-isms, you may want to turn on subtitles.

This is an entertaining movie that is touching in several aspects. There is the aging Santa who cannot quite grok that it's time for someone else to take the reins. There is the tech-savvy new heir apparent who does not get the recognition he deserves. And the screw-up with a big heart. Their Christmas is complicated by the fact of an undelivered toy, which brings out differing responses from each, and it's these reactions that make them quite human.

It's fun to watch the elves on their commando-style operations to get toys to all the kids. And the animation is flawless. There is enough humor and heart to keep you hooked.

But there are many stretches where you seem to be bombarded with non-stop noise, albeit a lot of it may be frantic dialogue. These stretches can be auditorily exhausting.

Some bits can get tedious, trying to get to the point.

The character design and texturing could have been much better. Grandpa Claus looks positively creepy, almost scary and out of place. The elves look rather bland and boring due to their huge, round faces and tiny, far-apart eyes. I found it hard to look at them.

Still, a fun, family movie, if these issues don't drive you batty.",1356393600,,1276,4.648888888888889

4682691,4,B005FLCD1I,"In the deluge of Christmas movies out there, ARTHUR CHRISTMAS is to be commended for its imaginative reworking of the Santa mystique.  The opening sequence explaining how so many gifts are distributed in such a short time is entertaining.  However, once ARTHUR focuses on the sibling rivalry and tradition vs. modernism, the familiar overtakes the inventiveness.  Nevertheless, ARTHUR CHRISTMAS is enjoyable and well done.  James McAvoy, Bill Nighy, Hugh Laurie, Jim Broadbent and Imelda Staunton lead a talented voice cast.  Younger children may lose attention but adults and older kids should have a good time.",1356307200,,612,5.4
4682692,3,B005FLCD1I,"You know the drill, Christmas is threatened.  All of it.  The nation's economy has come to depend on the spending; in Britain, without Halloween or Thanksgiving to hold them back, they have decorations up by the end of October.  But, Christmas Is Threatened!

Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!

Okay.  So that's the idea.  The most likeable characters are British;  the least, the militaristic, gucci-suited erstwhile Santa-to-be is an American militarist.  The whole feature is soaked with an unfortunate militaristic air, we have no Draft so most Americans have no real tie to our overseas adventures;  we can bomb and pillage without any real risk to anybody who matters to most of us, so our culture is getting ever more militarized; kids play games killing people that some suggest are training for the future soldiers they might become.  And it takes over this movie giving what to me was an unwelcome flavor that ruined the film.

Basically, beyond the militarism, it's a story of one kid getting missed, the system accidentally missing her toy (sort of like the basis for ""Brazil"" with less serious consequences).  Arthur, the Romantic Claus, a bumbler extreme is appalled that the kid is going to be averaged out and left without her toy, so he and Gramps---the retired Claus, get out the Old sleigh and reindeer and set off to do it the old fashioned way.

They get lost.  It turns out that the Welsh town has its name in several global locations, including Mexico.  Things go wrong.  Gramps has an agenda.  But in the end...

That would be a spoiler, now wouldn't it.

It's an enjoyable film even with the militaristic taint, it just makes me sad that our culture is taking this turn and it even affects our holiday films.",1356307200,,1734,4.75503355704698

4682711,4,B005FLCD1I,Enjoyed this holiday themed movie reasonably well.  Bought it for the season and the 3D.  It worked fairly well for both.,1356220800,,121,4.714285714285714
4682712,4,B005FLCD1I,We sat down with the whole family (8 year old and 11 year old) and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It was surprisingly engaging even for us parents.  I recommend this for all families with children especially those who have not yet reached the teen years.,1356220800,,255,4.644444444444445
4682713,5,B005FLCD1I,Hello my review of Arthur Christmass is that it was a verry good movie. sadley I had to re order another coppy of this movie since the origenal coppy that I orderd skipt and the dvd was damaged. so insted of sending it back I just orderd a new coppy. since sending it back seemd like more of a hassel then it was werhth. I saw this movie in the theaiter twice when it first came out and now I am verry happy to have it on dvd.,1356220800,,426,3.852272727272727
4682714,4,B005FLCD1I,Fun to watch in 3D and will probably become a Christmas classic. I know I will watch it next year.,1356220800,,98,3.95
4682715,5,B005FLCD1I,"A cute and very funny piece.  Yes, it has some humor that appeals to adults (like the Bush-like announcement of ""Mission Accomplished"" after a not-altogether successful mission as well as a chihuahua that was ""fond"" of a fuzzy slipper), but my savvy 11-year-old did not make the connections, while I thought they were clever and funny.  Hey, old Looney Tunes had double-entendres, too.  I didn't get those when I was a kid, but when I see those old Looney Tunes now, I see the ""adult"" humor in them.  Oh, and in case you thought maybe I was ""too permissive,"" we don't watch films here that go over a G (notable exception is Harry Potter films, several of which are PG).

Some reviewers also seem concerned that the wrong message comes through because ""Steve"" and Santa are not overly concerned about ""one missed child.""  But the whole point of the story is that Arthur clearly has the true spirit of Christmas as he makes sure the child gets her gift.  In the process, he is able to restore that spirit to Steve and Santa (and everyone else).

I say this is a good and funny film.  It is indeed a shame it didn't do better in the  US box office.  Definitely worth it.

Oh, and now we know WHY one cannot see Santa's house at the North Pole on Google Earth.  Thanks, Gwen!!",1356134400,,1272,4.431034482758621

I have watched it 4 times now and I hear something new every time. Grandfather Santa is the cutest and his geriatric reindeer. Santa is a little slow but Mrs Santa keeps him on tract.

4682776,4,B005FLCD1I,"Modern kids movies that attempt to do the classic Santa type story usually face a dilemma, which is that the core elements of those stories (sleighs, wooden toys etc.) is quite dated at this point. The usual result is a painful attempt to update and make the old relevant.

Arthur Christmas takes a different approach. Not only does it fully embrace modernity, but it acknowledges the contradictions between the old and the new.

In fact it brings it front and center, giving us a story about three generations and a clash of ideologies. All wrapped round a central message that the method doesn't matter, just the end result.

And it works. I'm not sure I'd go quite so far as to call it a Christmas classic, but it's really enjoyable. The anachronisms work for the story and it definitely has that seasonal feel.

Of course it doesn't hurt that it's funny or that it has a brilliant British voice cast. Really there isn't a single bad one in the lot, and some of them are just pitch perfect for the characters.

It's beautiful to look at too. Truly lovely animation. If you haven't seen it, you should definitely add it to your holiday viewing cycle.",1355529600,3,1152,4.6

This is one of my Top 5 Christmas films ever. It captures the Magic of Christmastime. I immediately identified with Arthur because we are very similar. I love Christmas as much as he does. It is the most magical time of the year to me and I have felt that way since I can remember. The lights, trees, carols, santa, elves, presents, snow, giving and receiving, gingerbread cookies, stockings, snowmen, skating and sledding, Christmas films, hot chocolate and being home for the holidays.
There are about 12-15 Christmas movies I watch each and every year and I am proud to say that Arthur Christmas is now included :)
I highly recommend Arthur Christmas for your home during the holiday season. It is a great film for the family to enjoy together.
Also, it is nice to see how Santa gets around the world in one night. I still don't understand how he eats that many cookies - his metabolism must be extremely high!",1355529600,,1126,4.579207920792079

I had no idea what it was about.  I enjoyed this movie.  While it is not a classic movie, it is a family movie.  There is no violence and all clean language.  I was thoroughly entertained all thru the severe turbulence of the aircraft.  It was funny, sincere and all together a very nice Christmas movie.

4682782,5,B005FLCD1I,"This is a wonderful story that works to explain the questions of the more skeptical child such as how does Santa live so long and how does he get around the world so fast and deliver so many toys to so many children.  The level of detail and creativity in the story telling and animation is amazing.  Off to the side, there are several beautiful side stories about what it means to love Christmas (the secular aspects) as well as how a dysfunctional family can be brought together by Christmas.

If you are looking for a more traditional telling of the Santa Claus story then I recommend Polar Express.  Believe it or not, this film holds Christmas in the same wonderfully high regard as Polar Express but offers its story with a more comedic telling.  As with all visually stunning films, I strongly recommend the Blu-Ray version if your TV accomodates it.  Merry Christmas!",1355443200,,875,4.64935064935065

Arthur, representing the magic and wonder of Christmas, is the younger son of Santa Claus.

One little girl is missed, and Arthur and his grandfather steal the traditional sleigh to deliver her bike.

4682818,5,B005FLCD1I,"Nothing 'life changing' in this movie, but the performances & comedic timing are masterfully executed.  We used promotional AIV credits we had accrued from other purchases to rent this film for 24 hours.  We weren't sure we would like it going in.  The linked trailer for the movie helped us make our choice.  Upon completion of our first viewing, our whole family agreed it was a great family film and we were glad we sat down together in the darkened living room and watched it on the big screen TV.  We were laughing our butts off multiple times throughout the film.  It was really that much fun to watch together.  Now if only AIV could find some way to embed closed captioning or subtitles for those few times where we find ourselves asking, ""What did that character just say?""  UPDATE:  I just read elsewhere that AIV is starting to add CC to their movies - Yay!!!",1355097600,,870,4.5256410256410255

It was a littl over the top as far as stimulation went, something happening
with sound and action every moment just about...but the whole generational
Santa thing was insightful and fun and slightly dysfunctional and challanging,
which made it easy to relate to. And ARthur, with the heart of gold and the faith
of a child really shone through and inspired the Santa in each of us. And one
more thing, the Scottich accent was dimensionally awesome and brought a lot
of character to everyone! Thanks! and Merry Christmas to all!",1355097600,2,596,4.632075471698113

4682841,4,B005FLCD1I,"Arthur Christmas takes a witty, contemporary approach to the Santa Clause story.  Santa's N Pole operation has gone corporate.  There are multiple generations of Santa's each more interested in their legacy, and drunk with the power of the role (and in the case of Grandpa Santa, I suspect a bit of schnapps as well) than the role itself.  The result is a funny concoction that is a cross between Dilbert and Twas the Night Before Christmas.",1355011200,,441,4.776315789473684

4682845,5,B005FLCD1I,"We love this movie. Its going to be one of those Christmas classics for us. The Blu Ray is great quality. The only thing on the negative side is that the stickers on the box says that it includes the Justin Bieber ""Santa Claus is Comin' To Town"", which we thought meant that the music video would be in the disk extra's, but sadly its not. The song is only played during the ending credits. Seems like it wouldnt have been too hard to include the 3 minute music video in the extras.",1355011200,,482,4.193548387096774

4682851,5,B005FLCD1I,"In an environment of cheesy, cheap, shake-your-booty Santa stories, this is the true ""now"" Christmas story!  It answers the questions of the contemporary child with humor and heart.  It wraps the legend of Santa and the advances of today into an adventurous plot. The characters are outrageously adorable and the computer animation is spectacular.  I found one flaw in the editing, but then I've watched it over a dozen times.  I'll let you find this minor bit on your own, and in the meanwhile I'm sure you'll agree Arthur Christmas is an immediate classic",1354924800,,557,4.8936170212765955

4682854,4,B005FLCD1I,Very fun movie. My hubby and I both ended up watching the whole movie with the kiddos rather than just one of us 'suffering' through a children's movie. Technology and Santa? Sounded silly at first but they did an excellent job of it with this movie. No problems with the instant video steaming rental. Will probably rent it again this season.

This movie is hip, modern, and full of laugh out surprises at the creative inventiveness of the story. If you like the TV Christmas specials Prep and Landing - then this is the perfect holiday movie.  My wife and I laughed so much that now that we've rented it, we'll probably buy it so that it becomes part of the standard rotation with The Christmas Story!",1354838400,,475,4.3977272727272725

4682859,4,B005FLCD1I,Cute and quirky take on how technology has affected how Santa delivers gifts.  Three generations of Santas consider the reason they work so hard all year to deliver gifts to the world's kids.  GranSanta is worth watching all alone.,1354838400,,231,4.897435897435898

4682863,5,B005FLCD1I,"My family just watched this last night and it's truly the best Christmas/Holiday film I've seen in years. The dialogue is incredibly witty and smart, filled with lots of details that grown-ups will catch but still entertain children. I've seen so many cartoons and movies illustrating the Santa 2.0 industrial complex and the technological feats the North Pole executes to deliver gifts in a single night, but wow... the creative team built an amazing world. The motion graphics and the little details on the computer screens along with the 10,000+ elves is epic.

Plus, the family interactions from Grandfather to Father and then the two sons is fantastic. Every Santa has their own history and the evolution of Christmas and the needs of the two brothers is incredibly compelling and adds to the narrative. I highly recommend this movie.",1354752000,,839,5.0359712230215825
4682864,4,B005FLCD1I,"Cute movie, the kids loved it, and if I am honest, I enjoyed it to! It is nice to have a movie that we could all enjoy together. Nothing to edit out on this one even for our youngest (3). It was a good watch!",1354752000,,208,3.6444444444444444

I loved everything about this movie.  The animation is bright and beautiful, the script is witty, the pacing is quick, and it all ends happily.  Children will love seeing Santa, the reindeer, and sleigh (even though he usually drives a solar-powered spacecraft aided by a NASA-like control room manned by elves) and adults will laugh nonstop at the very funny dialogue that combines traditional values with modern technology.  Turn on the subtitles to catch them all.

The British cast features James McAvoy, Bill Nighy, Hugh Laurie, and Jim Broadbent and is outstanding.  I was left with a big smile on my face.  Recommended!",1354665600,,846,4.846153846153846

4682872,5,B005FLCD1I,Fun movie kinda answers kids questions.  Did not like the Idea of an uncaring Santa or Santa consumed with ambition greed.  I loved the rest of the movie.,1354665600,,154,4.464285714285714

It's not something that you have to watch year after year, but kids between 2 and 12 will thoroughly enjoy it and parents won't mind watching it with their children because it does have some humor and it's not a super annoying movie full of annoying characters like some of the younger children stuff.",1354579200,,350,4.737704918032787

4682884,5,B005FLCD1I,"This is such a wonderful movie, my son and I love it so much. Arthur is the keeper of the letters that children send to Santa, he also writes back to the children. He is a little clumsy with some Laugh Out Loud humor to make little ones and big ones alike filled with the gigglies. This story is heartfelt and the graphics are great, it shows children that Christmas is not just about superficial things and power. It is about caring for others. I love this movie and I know you will.",1354492800,,484,4.21505376344086
4682885,4,B005FLCD1I,"We rented this from Amazon Instant Video on Saturday on a whim and my 8 year old daughter, my wife and I really enjoyed it.  It's well paced, never got boring.  The story is clever: a family of Santa's passing on the name sake from one generation to the next, with some friendly family rivalry over the generations, and the dorky brother who really knows the true meaning of Christmas and wants to save Christmas for one little girl.  The characters are a lot of fun, there are some pretty funny scenes, and a little tension that might have your kiddos wanting mom or dad close to snuggle with (but nothing too bad - though you might need to read the closing bits at the end to show that all of the reindeer make it home ok).

For the three of us, definitely a good modern Christmas tale, something I'm sure we'll rent again in years to come.",1354492800,,842,4.310126582278481

4682899,4,B005FLCD1I,"In November  2011, the British/American 3D animated film ""Arthur Christmas"" was released in theaters.

Produced by Aardman Animations and Sony Pictures Animation, the film was co-directed by Sarah Smith (""The Pirates! Band of Misfits"", The League of Gentlemen"", ""The Awful Truth"") and Bary Cook (director of ""Mulan"" and known for visual effects for Disney films such as ""Aladdin"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""The Rescuers Down Under"", ""Tron"") and a screenplay co-written by Smith and Peter Baynham (""Borat"", ""Bruno"", ""Hotel Transylvania"").

The animated film would feature voice talent from stars such as as James McAvoy (""X-Men: First Class"", ""Wanted"", ""The Last King of Scotland""), Hugh Laurie (""House, M.D."", ""Stuart Little"", ""Monsters vs. Aliens""), Bill Nighy (""Love Actually"", ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, ""Hot Fuzz""), Jim Broadbent (""Moulin Rouge!"", ""Gangs of New York"", ""The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe""), Imelda Staunton (""Vera Drake"", ""Shakespeare in Love"", ""Chicken Run""), Ashley Jensen (""Ugly Betty"", ""Gnomeo & Juliet"", ""How to Train Your Dragon""), Marc Wooton (""Frequently Asked Questions  About Time Travel"", ""Cyberdelic""), Laura Linney (""The Truman Show"", ""Mystic River"", ""Primal Fear""), Eva Longoria (""Desperate Housewives"", ""The Sentinel""), Joan Cusack (""Working Girl"", ""Say Anything"", ""Toy Story 2 & 3), Michael Palin (""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", ""Life of Brian"", ""The Meaning of Life"") and many more.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Arthur's Christmas"" is presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen.  ""Arthur's Christmas"" is presented in English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital plus an English - Audio Description Track.

If you want the best audio quality, I recommend the Blu-ray release.

But overall, the CG animation for ""Arthur Christmas"" by Aardman Animations is pretty much the best animated film that I have seen from the studio.  Textures are well-detailed, everything from the characters to background scenery is amazingly well-detailed and well-animated.  If anything, I had a feeling that this film would look even more incredible on Blu-ray.

And as for the audio quality for ""Arthur Christmas"" is well-done as there are quite a number of action-paced segments that utilize the surround channels effectively.  But if you are an audiophile, definitely go lossless as the Blu-ray release of ""Arthur Christmas"" will have a much better and possibly immersive soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Arthur's Christmas"" comes with the following special features:

  Un-wrapping Arthur Christmas - (13:27) Featuring interviews with the cast and crew of ""Arthur Christmas"".
  Progression Reels - (13:49) Featuring animators commentary and for the featured progression reels for ""Arthur Christmas Unwrapped"", ""Arthur's Office"", ""Grandsanta"", ""Invasion"", ""Trelew"".
  Elf Recruitment Video - (1:11) An animated video for elf recruitment (and a promotional for ""Arthur Christmas"").

EXTRAS:

""Arthur Christmas"" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to download the film to your computer or select Apple and Android devices and also stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to animated films with a Christmas theme, a lot of films that tend to feature Santa often become banal.  Rehashed storylines with predictable endings.  But for Aardman Animations, they wanted to do something different when it comes to an animated Christmas film.

Many children often ask how Santa is able to deliver so many presents to people all around the world and what writers Peter Baynham and Sarah Smith did was to answer just that.

Unlike other Santa-related films, ""Arthur Christmas"" shows us that there is a line of Claus' members from grandsanta that people are familiar with, when it comes to the sleigh and reindeer.  But now a new generation of Claus that use modern technology that allows them to cover a large area of the world with speed and efficiency.  And how the elves have a big part to play in the wrapping and delivery of the items to various homes.

But what if technology goes awry?  In this case, technology doesn't account for one single present and that means a child will be missing out on her Christmas gift?

It's a pretty interesting concept to deal with different means of delivering children's presents to various people and how technology comes into play for a modern Christmas storyline.

And because of its story, it's an accessible Christmas animated film for both children and adults.  Children will no doubt love watching clumsy Arthur or even the adorable Elves, while adults will understand the concept of Santa retiring, Mrs. Claus wanting her husband to be home and literally pass the torch to their children and of course, Santa having a hard time facing reality that it is probably time to let his children become the next Santa, while he starts his new life becoming more of a husband.

It's no doubt a modern tale, mixed in with the classic ""will Santa be able to deliver the presents in time"" storyline.

The animation from Aardman Animation and Sony Pictures animation was magnificent.  This is probably the best CG animated film to focus on Christmas and as the animation and the artwork for this film is very detailed and well-done, the voice acting with its talented cast also should be commended but having this British/American collaboration worked very well and was impressed by how things were executed in terms of animation, storyline, voice acting and direction.  I was impressed!

As for the DVD, picture and audio quality on DVD is very good, but if you are an audio or videophile, I recommend the Blu-ray release of ""Arthur Christmas"".  The DVD also comes with a few special features and for the most part, ""Arthur Christmas"" is a solid holiday release!

Overall, ""Arthur Christmas"" is an animated film that parents will no doubt want to buy for the children to watch over Christmas vacation.

It does have a PG-rating mainly for mild rude humor but for the most part, there is nothing terrible, nothing violent that will frighten children.  Granted, there is a scene where Arthur, Grandsanta and Bryony accidentally land in the African jungle and are chased by animals of the wild and there are times where Arthur tends to get himself in a wee bit of trouble (ie. trying to fly with the reindeer) or one scene (which is probably the rude scene of the film), when Steve accidentally delivers a toy to the wrong child and tries to take it back from the child.  This is probably the extend of anything that an be seen as frightening for very young children.  But outside of that, ""Arthur Christmas"" is the perfect Christmas animated film being released on Blu-ray or DVD for the family this year!

""Arthur Christmas"" is a fun, adventurous and enjoyable Christmas animated film for the entire family!  Recommended!",1354320000,,6912,5.1987353206865405
4682900,5,B005FLCD1I,i really enjoyed the movie. Liked the care that Arthur felt for the little girl and that no child should be left behind. Lots of funny things made me laugh and a tear or two at the great ending.,1354233600,,194,4.0
4682901,5,B005FLCD1I,"The kids picked this one to watch.  I am not into the whole Santa thing, I think the Christmas holiday needs to focus more on its namesake.  But my wife and I laughed and enjoyed the movie very much.

The movie focused more on doing the right thing and going above and beyond when the odds are stacked against you.  Something that seems to be lacking in today's society.",1354233600,,370,4.318840579710145

4682904,5,B005FLCD1I,"Although the movie started off at a pace that was difficult for my little ones to follow, I felt the ending was absolutely spectacular. Very moving. Also, the characters were soooooo wonderfully created - I loved just LOOKING at them, and watching.",1354233600,,248,4.928571428571429
4682905,5,B005FLCD1I,"The basic premise is that Santa Claus is a title...a job description, if you will, passed down through the Christmas family. In present day, there are four Christmases living at the North Pole - Grandpa, Santa, and his two sons. One son is militant and precise, and destined to be the next Santa. The other is timid, shy, and completely misunderstood by his family. However, when (at the end of the Christmas run), it is discovered that one single child has been MISSED, it is up to the youngest son (Arthur) to save the day. This movie came out in theaters last year, but I don't remember ever hearing about it. I don't know how else to describe it except...adorable. It has a great message (service for the sake and magic of service, instead of for the glory of it), and is something I would definitely watch every year!",1354147200,,822,4.523489932885906

But the ""digital"" copy requires Ultraviolet which means you don't get it in iTunes and to download it you need to watch it only on the Sony App or in a web window on your desktop. You are forced to create an account to view it.

4682923,2,B005FLCD1I,"I was really looking forward to this film after seeing the trailer. Now I've seen it, and it was just meh. I guess I'm in the minority.

The beginning wasn't bad, but soon the story began unraveling. The whole sleigh ride to try to get to Gwen's house (the bulk of the film) was just one unfunny screw-up after another, including a ""joke"" showing a dog mounting a fluffy slipper. I don't mind adult-oriented jokes in children's films, but they at least need to be tasteful and funny! The worst was the reindeer getting hurt and lost during this whole mess, with no explanation as to their fate until the very end of the film. How could Santa (grandpa) leave his reindeer behind like they were disposable??! The UFO tangent was just plain stupid, with the end result being the sleigh gets blown to bits by the military. There were so many moments like that in the film that just took away from the story, without adding anything of substance or relevance. There was nothing gracious or magical to find here, like in the old Christmas classics provided by Rankin-Bass, where the story was clear and endearing, and at a pace that didn't make your head spin.

I'd say buy an old Rankin-Bass classic instead, or Polar Express, or the Muppet Christmas Carol.",1353888000,5,1252,4.609865470852018
4682924,4,B005FLCD1I,"""Aardman's second venture into the world of CG animation is surprisingly stronger in story than Flushed Away and the fourth W&G film. It is intriguing (especially its geographical aspect), funny at parts, neatly designed and digitalized, and irreverent that makes for a good, modernized version of Frosty the Snowman or a Rankin & Bass special for the new age.""",1353888000,,361,5.135593220338983

The storyline keeps your attention and the animation looks great and not cheap.  It was a cute spin on the same kind of Christmas movies I always seem to see - Santa Claus & relatives and something terrible has happened that will ruin Christmas! It didn't feel cliche.  I don't have children but I love Children's movies and I think this one could keep everyone's attention.

I got the copy with the Ultraviolet streaming.  This was my first experience with it. It and Sony Pictures do some sort of streaming - I found the whole process very confusing but I think I was just trying to skip a step without knowing I was... once you have the Ultraviolet streaming set up it's great!  The customer service was quick to respond too, even though I was complaining about it not working when in fact it was...

Last year I took her out to a restaurant of her choice (McDonalds!), and then to a movie of her choice (Arthur Christmas). I figured this movie would be OK, but not great. I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the movie from start to finish, and it was quite a bit better than expected. Though this is definitely a Christmas movie for kids, it's not the typical Christmas movie. This Santa is a high-tech, modern marvel guru who employs all sorts of gadgets and highly-trained squads of elves to deliver all of the Christmas goodies to the kids. The problem is, Santa is getting old, and it's time for him to choose his successor, and he can't decide which of his sons to pass the mantle to. Both sons have great character qualities that prove them to be deserving, but which one will he choose?

4682966,4,B005FLCD1I,"My kids really loved this movie, but I was not quite as captivated. On paper it sounds great - the two sons of Santa have two very different strengths and ideas about Christmas - Steve is the strategist, and has implemented all sorts of high-tech methods for Santa, while Arthur is all about the magic and spirit. When it's discovered early Xmas morning that one child has been missed, Arthur attempts to make good the old-fashioned way, leading to many (mis)adventures. The two brothers have to come together to sort it out, and both learn heartwarming lessons.

Sounds great, right? Well it is, to a point, and as I said,  my kids really loved it. I found parts rather boring, and the action sequences a little too video-game like. Most of the characters didn't have the charm that they do in the best animated films, and the animation itself didn't seem particularly inventive to me (although perhaps in 3D this is more enjoyable.)

4682975,5,B005FLCD1I,"I watched ARTHUR CHRISTMAS with only the vaguest of expectations. I had assumed it would be standard, generically heartwarming Christmas fare. I wasn't at all prepared for what a delightful romp ARTHUR CHRISTMAS actually is. It has its share of heartwarming moments, but what truly impressed me was how non-generic these moments were. Instead, they were based in honest, human emotions, rather than manufactured Christmasy schmaltz. And even better than that, these moments appear side-by-side-and are even more often, merged-with a practically devilish sense of humor. This is an animated Christmas movie with razor-sharp intelligence and a real edge that works its own kind of Christmas magic while simultaneously undercutting the straightforward Christmas magic of other films (even as it paradoxically heightens it). Like a chocolate truffle sprinkled with sea salt, ARTHUR CHRISTMAS is as sweet as it is sharp.

ARTHUR CHRISTMAS`s basic premise is that Santa Claus is not, in fact, the immortal, eternally senior citizen purveyor of presents that pop culture would have you believe but rather a title that is passed from generation to generation of the same family. The eponymous Arthur, voiced by James McAvoy, is the lovable screw-up son of the current Santa (Jim Broadbent). Arthur's heart is as large as his klutzy streak and he truly believes in the magic of Santa with all of his soul, something which can't be said for his older brother, Steve (Hugh Laurie), who-with his goatee impeccably trimmed into the shape of a Christmas tree-is corporate, hands-off efficiency personified and heir apparent for the Santa throne, despite the fact that he doesn't like children very much. Thanks to his guidance, the traditional sleigh has been replaced by a spaceship, the S1, loaded with the latest technology and filled with thousands upon thousands of elves, who take care of delivering the gifts to all of the houses with espionage-like perfection while the getting-on-in-years Santa stands by as the company figurehead, taking credit for all of the hard work.

But as impressive as all of Steve's glossy new tech is, it doesn't prevent a regrettable mishap: in all of the world, one child is left behind when her present fails to be delivered. While Steve considers that an acceptable loss, hardly a blemish on his gleaming record, Arthur and his ancient Grandsanta (Bill Nighy) refuse to ruin this child's magical day and so, armed with the old sleigh, a group of actual magic reindeer, and Byrony, an enterprising young elf from the Giftwrap Battalion with a never-say-die attitude and a punk sense of style (voiced by the wonderful Ashley Jensen, best known from UGLY BETTY and EXTRAS), they set out to set things right. And while the overall trajectory of the narrative shouldn't be a major surprise to anyone, the delight is in the details. The movie rockets along with a sense of creativity and inventiveness-and often sidesplitting humor-that far outweighs any of its predictable elements, and even those are delivered with such genuine emotion that ARTHUR CHRISTMAS never feels anything less than the most fun, high-spirited, imaginative Christmas movie ever.",1352851200,2,3174,5.209393346379648

4682983,3,B005FLCD1I,"Arthur Christmas(released Nov/11)stars the voice talents of Hugh Laurie,Bill Nighy,Robbie Coltrane,Joan Cusak,Michael Palin and many others. It is an ambitious animated film,and therein lies its' biggest fault;it is  TOO ambitious. The story is overly complicated and filled with gags that after a time fall completely flat. By the time you get to the end you don't care whether Arthur reaches his goal or not.
The story revolves around the principal named character of Arthur who is one of the current Santa's sons. His other son Steve runs the control center and is boss over the elves. Steve has become quite ambitious and feels that he is the only rightful heir to becoming the new Santa this year. However when Santa arrives home he announces to one and all he is looking forward to going out next year,much to Steve's chagrin.
Son Arthur is kind of the klutz of the family,who has had various jobs within the organization over the years,never settling into one very long. However this year he is Santa's official letter writer. Santa retires to bed,but it comes to Steve's attention that one present has been left undelivered. He tries to downplay it,even convincing his father not to pay attention to it. However Arthur gets wind of it,then Arthur's grandfather,who says he will help Arthur deliver that present in his old sleigh(Santa now uses an ultra sleek and cloaked spacecraft to do his work).
Of course Arthur's grandfather has not ridden his sleigh for years and alot of mix ups and upsets occur at first. Eventually they end up stranded on a beach in Cuba as the sleigh circles the earth upside down with,by this time,only three reindeer. By this time most of the North Pole has come alive with the buzz about the undelivered present,embarrassing Steve ever the more. The elves even wake Santa up from his sleep,who confronts Steve and before you know it Santa,Mrs. Claus and Steve are winding their way to deliver the present(a better model of bicycle than Arthur has to deliver).
Steve and company end up in the same spot in Mexico that Arthur had been to earlier. Their destination is a town in Cornwall,England and they must hurry before time runs out.
Meanwhile Arthur has gained control of the sleigh,picked up his grandfather and they are in the town in Cornwall and attempting to get there with little time left. Arthur arrives just as the sun is peaking over the hills,threatening to wake up the girl the bike is destined for. Santa's ship arrives to block out the sun,which saves the day. Steve,Arthur,Santa and Santa's father invade the home to deliver the bike on time. Arthur asks his dad to stay and watch the girl open her present. It is then apparent by the look on Arthur's face,and his unflinching dedication,that HE should be the new Santa.
The animation is quite detailed and very clear,which enhances its' entire look. But this film has just got so many little things going on,they become repetitive and unfunny. How many times does a sleigh have to over-turn to become unfunny?How many near misses does a sleigh have to have to become unfunny,despite the screams of its passengers?And Steve,Santa's own son,becomes a very unlikable character as the movie progresses. He becomes very ambitious,selfish and quite uncaring towards Christmas and children in general. We dislike him not only because of his off-putting personality,and his proclivity towards the modern,but because we expect more from a son of old Saint Nick. By the time the film ends,you can bet your children will be antsy in their seats and one does really not care whether Arthur delivers the present on time,as we have lost our vested interest in the proceedings a long time before.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include two featurettes and an elf recruitment vid.
All in all,while the animation is good,the story,the gags and the characterizations leave alot to be desired. This movie will have the small fry squirming in their seats not too far into it. Not recommended. 2 1/2-3 stars.",1352592000,4,4051,4.888081395348837

4682985,5,B005FLCD1I,"""Operation: Santa Claus Is Coming To Town""... Is beautifully directed by Sarah Smith. She spins out a whole new animated theme of the Christmas scene, headed-up at and coming out of the North Pole.  What's first asked is: Just who is actually in charge up there?  It would be either the current Santa Claus (Jim Broadbent), who comes down through the generations with each Claus portrait hung on the wall, or the up-and-coming, heir-apparent, eldest son, Steve (Hugh Laurie).

While the current Santa (usually awaiting a nap) is more of a position-holder up-north, Steve is in complete control with a militarily disciplined style. With the elves, and everything that needs doing, he's hyped for ""efficiency and productivity"".  The younger and kinder son, Arthur (James McAvoy), obviously operates from the heart. He's in charge of receiving all the letters to Santa and making sure the children are getting what they need; he believes that Santa is the ""Greatest Man Ever"".

In a quaint town in England, little apple-cheeked Gwen slips her annual letter to Santa Claus into the post box with the highest of hopes. She begins an opening monologue asking a whole lot of questions about, and of, Santa Claus: ""Why?""-this and ""Why?""-that, including her doubts of whether or not he is even real.  Her friend told her otherwise while Gwen... Still Believes!

We see an entirely orchestrated Christmas Eve night enfold... Steve is at the helm and in the complete direction of all 'operations'.  His father is Santa, and he's delivering the toys along with the new, high-tech elves ('1st. Field Elves Battalion'). Steve is choreographing everything behind the scenes, to the most minute of detail.  Upon Santa's return to the North Pole, following so much action, the counts are tallied and everything stands as... ""Mission Accomplished"".

This is with the one exception. We soon discover, after Santa's family  finishes their Christmas meal around the table, that a child was forgotten.  That child just happens to be Gwen. She didn't receive her toy and she is still fast asleep.  Arthur is deeply disturbed by this, as he is the one who read her letter, and Santa's own father is also as upset with this situation.  Wisecracking Grandsanta (Bill Nighy) is old-school and came before this new, ultra-controlled way of handling Christmas and handling the children. He may be a lot of things, although he genuinely cares and also for Arthur's position as the 'Number Two Son' in the family. He misses the old ways and traditions held throughout his own generation of being the Head Claus.

Arthur and Grandsanta join forces and switch back to the old sleigh  (endeared ""Evie"") and reindeer team in favor of this new, high-flying, techno-ride that Santa is using now. The two of them, along with an elf friend, take off to find the sleeping, and still believing, Gwen.  The race is on...

There is plenty to see in this film with the animation and picture quality vividly done. The Christmas Eve scene at the very beginning is Hyperactive; with the elves in unison performing their tasks, jumping off of suspended ropes that seemingly hang from the sky, skiing all over, and viewing through green-glowing, night vision goggles. The North Pole is so well represented by color, light and hustling and bustling  everywhere. Even the dark blue night skies are blanketed in grand style, with a gorgeous mantle of shimmering stars. A truly happy Christmas movie that we enjoyed immensely!  Merry Arthur Christmas...",1352505600,19,3500,5.0120898100172715

4682988,2,B005FLCD1I,"If you're looking for a good, joyful, touching movie, something that you can sit all the way from the beginning to the end (like The Polar Express), DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!! This one does not bring anything special or new or fun or mysterious or exciting like in many previous one. Moreover, the plot is loose, simple and even absurd.(so absurd that even my 8-year-old sister cried to leave the cinema) It's about the adventure to deliver a gift to a girl, the only one that the delivery system missed. But the adventure was so predictable and boring. I couldn't figure out why the director not think of anything more creative or interesting for the adventure. The plot also ruins the image of Santa Claus by portraying the fight for power in the Santa family. In addition to such bad plot, the expressions of characters are boring. It's like we have seen it a million times before. The same old song. I really hate the main character, quite clumsy and stupid. Maybe my most favorite character is the Grand Santa, who had a Gollum-like look and some fun quotes. But all in all, the characters also have nothing special. If you compare this one to other previous Xmas movies (like the Polar Express, the Christmas Carols), you'll find great differences in every aspect. Or in other words, it can't be compared to the masterpiece Polar Express. I went to the cinema happy and excited, I left the cinema totally disappointed.",1352505600,2,1423,4.673306772908367

It is very funny and at some points very sad, it is truly a wild ride from start to finish. You and your entire family will fall in love with Arthur (and grandfather Santa)!",1352332800,,634,4.08
4682997,1,B005FLCD1I,I didn't buy this movie because I read the review and this movie is not for children. I also heard on TV that it was not a good movie for children. Grandpa Santa is drunk or drinking beer. Santa missed one child and was told thats ok it was only one child. If a child watches that moveie the child will be wondering if Santa was going to miss him. This movie is more for adults.,1352332800,6,378,3.986842105263158

I can't wait to watch it together when I visit for the holidays. It's the kind of movie you want to share with others. It's funny and touching, you can't help but cheer Arthur on his journey. Finally, I'm glad to have a new classic to add to my list of films I watch Nov.-Christmas. More like this please!",1352246400,3,441,4.1395348837209305
4682999,1,B005FLCD1I,"Before you read, I am taking a traditionalists PoV.  Albeit a cute looking movie with potential but hesitant to see it in the movie theater after watching the previews, I am quite glad that I did not allow my children to watch this first.  My comments:  a lot of adult humor including mentions of the Grandpa Santa drinking or being drunk; the current Santa is shown as a figurehead (like the queen since the movie is British) with the elves doing ALL of the work - Santa places a ""token"" gift under the tree in each city after being awoken from a sleeping stupor in a chair at one house; Santa misses one child and his eldest son convinces him that the percentages are so good that missing one child 'isn't that big of a deal' and the family goes off to sleep including SANTA (Arthur and Grandpa Santa save the day); there is no more sleigh and reindeer but a spaceship looking thing that's a big as a small town; a chihuahua grabs hold of one of Arthur's slippers and 'mounts' it - how is that for children?; Grandpa Santa who appears to have dementia at times (or drunk) takes some decedents of the original reindeer (who he calls Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Commit, Bambi, the one with the white ear, the other deer, and the other deer) with the help of Arthur to deliver the missing gift, all of the reindeer end up falling off the sleigh (two get chased by lions in Africa to be saved by flying dust before they get eaten); one gets run into an inflatable Santa; and the others fly off through various accidents; grandpa Santa looks to replace one of the reindeer by STEALING a reindeer display from someone's house while getting SHOT AT by the homeowner.  My children would come out of watching this with more questions than answers - how can Santa say missing one child is not a big deal?  Will he miss me and not care?  What happened to the reindeer?  Did they get hurt or eaten by the lions?  Why are there three Santas?  Does he die?  What happened to the sleigh and reindeer?  Will he come in a spaceship now?  Why doesn't Santa deliver the gifts anymore, the elves do all the work?  BE WARNED!  This movie has been given away and is far away from my Santa believing children.",1352246400,39,2185,4.389578163771712

Arthur is the kind of hero that you want to cheer for, and when he triumphs, you feel so proud, and when he falters, you really really want him to get back on his feet.  The humor might be a little big for some of the younger kids, but the quality graphics and general sweetness keep them engaged.  For older ""kids"", you will appreciate the humor a lot more.

What else can i say other than this is probably one of the greatest, if not greatest, Christmas movie I've ever seen. Christmas is my favorite time of the year and the holiday has a lot of meaning to me. When watching this I've never felt more Christmas spirit come alive inside of me. It was also the first time I've ever balled my eyes out from watching a movie. I had to wait until everyone left the theater so i could keep some of my manhood intact haha. But anyways if your on the fence about this movie DON'T BE! It's that good! I definately will be watching this every year during the holidays until the day i die",1351209600,7,698,4.139705882352941
4683007,5,B005FLCD1I,"I took the kids to see this in the theater. They absolutely loved it. The colors and animation are wonderful. It's a heartfelt, modern family story that takes a look at how we can lose sight of what's important when computer gadgetry takes over society. The clever writing answers all those pesky questions about how Santa gets around the world in one night, keeps track of all the kids' letters, and how the toys are packed into the sleigh. This really brings the magic of Christmas alive. I highly recommend it to kids of all ages who love Christmas.",1351123200,48,552,4.585858585858586

It's a story that captures the intergenerational conflict of passing on the baton, the influences of modernity on traditional things like Christmas, and missing what's in front of your face because it doesn't look like you think it should. Add a pinch of Christmas magic and you have Arthur Christmas. It's great fun for kids and adults. James McAvoy does a great job!",1344384000,2,501,4.976190476190476

4683012,5,B005FLCD1I,"My favorite Twilight Zone TV episode is ""Night of the Meek"" starring Art Carney, airing back around 1960.  All these 50 some odd years later I have never forgotten the down and out loser who wanted nothing for himself except the ability to give Christmas presents to others.  This is the premise of Arthur Christmas.  It is a wonderfully gentle and moving family Christmas movie.  Hollywood is seldom capable of producing such fine family entertainment.  I'm not at all surprised that the film was produced, directed and written by Europeans.  This is a film that is truly for all ages and all countries.  It should become a classic.",1326585600,3,633,4.805555555555555
4683013,4,B005FLCD1I,"This review is based on taking my family to see ""Arthur Christmas"" in the cinema. It is an entertaining animated comedy about how the ""Santa Claus"" operation might be working in 2011 if it is a family business which is trying to move with the times ...

The story begins as Gwen, a little girl in Cornwall, is posting a letter to Santa at the North Pole, asking for a bike for Christmas, and adding that she is the only one among all her friends who believes in him, quoting some of the arguments they use. Then we hear the voice of a the person in Santa's correspondence department at the North Pole who is replying to Gwen's letter, as the camera pans through a huge underground complex, beginning with a series of family portraits from the first Santa Claus (St Nicholas) through his descendants who have held the office to the present day: until we reach the office where Arthur, the younger son of the present Santa and the hero of the story, is writing the reply.

Santa now delivers presents on Christmas night through a vast high-tech operation run like a benevolent army from a sci-fi film - I don't want to say too much more than this in order to avoid giving away some of the humour when you first see how it works. We are soon introduced to the amazing ""Claus"" family, of which the nominal head is the current, 20th Santa Claus (Malcolm, voiced by Jim Broadbent), who is just completing his 70th Christmas in the job.

Other characters include his father ""Grandsanta"" voiced by Bill Nighy, who is now aged 136, and had been the 19th Santa Claus and misses the old ways of doing things: Santa's wife, Mrs Margaret Claus (Immelda Staunton) who is the family's unsung heroine; and his sons, Steve and Arthur, who could not be more different.

Steve, who is obviously the architect of the current high-tech Christmas and appears to have been the effective head of the Santa operation for years, dresses and acts like a US Army General, is highly competent and desperate to succeed his father, but seems to have forgotten what Christmas is really about. Arthur is an idealistic, clumsy dreamer who has a knack for causing disasters, but who as much as any other member of the family really cares.

Other characters in the Santa operation include a host of elves, particularly Steve's ADC Peter, who is so desperately keen to please that he comes over as a comic parody of a brown-noser, and Bryony, a determined and brave elf from the present-wrapping department who has a strong Scots accent.

With two hours to go before dawn, Operation Christmas appears to be complete, with two billion presents delivered, the family and elves back at the North Pole preparing for bed - and then a parcel is found at the North Pole which had fallen off the conveyor belt. It's Gwen's bike - and the one child in her village who believes in Father Christmas is in danger of being the only child in the world who doesn't get a present from Santa this year!

But not if Arthur can help it!

As always, the Aardman animation is brilliant. The big name voice cast give of their best, and there is a lot of excellent humour.

I did feel that the storyline was a little predictable and would have worked better as the plot for a film of about an hour's duration. At times the middle part of the film appeared to have been padded to fill the story out to an hour-and-a-half for a cinematic release.

Nevertheless I can recommend this as an entertaining addition to the canon of family Christmas movies, which entertained me and more to the point, my children.",1325635200,3,3545,4.551020408163265

4683015,5,B005FLCD1I,"For me this will be a quintessential holiday movie like A Wonderful Life or Charlie Brown Christmas. It hits so many notes that it is fully deserving of being a full length movie.  We all have aging parents (even centenarian ones), and this wonderful movie asks the questions when is it time for an aging parent to step aside, and who/which child, is the appropriate heir to a dynasty (timeless questions - see The King's Speech), with humor and understanding. With our world turning over to 7 Billion people, it is high time the legend & logistics of Santa get an update -- as Steve, one of Santa's full grown sons knows only too well.  The old wooden sleigh and 8 reindeer are stressed to get the 'job' done in these times of GPS and satellite tracking.  But the older generation has difficulty handling the technical upgrades, and doesn't even seem to see the point when the old-school methods worked just fine back in the steam-era. Mrs Claus is no slouch herself, but doesn't get any sort of recognition. Many a family in today's world has faced just the same familial stresses, not to mention many dynasties over the centuries (see The Lion in Winter).

Combine familial issues of the modern age, with the sentimental message that every child matters -- around the world -- and you have a poignant and relevant message for the holiday season, one that will resonate for years to come, and is suitable for children of 'all' ages.

This will be a movie I expect to enjoy for the rest of my life.",1325116800,5,1499,4.5783582089552235
4683016,4,B005FLCD1I,"There's really not too much to say about this movie. It was good, and had heart-warming moments, but wasn't great. On Christmas Eve night, Santa Claus and his elves control an ultra-high-tech sleigh called the S-1. Santa's son, Steve is up to be the new Santa next year. The other son, Arthur is an embarrassment that answers children's letters to Santa. When Gwen is forgotten, Arthur decides to take the gift to her himself. With the help of Grand-Santa and an elf that's an expert in wrapping named Bryony, they must deliver the present before dawn, or else. If you want a good heart-warming Christmas movie, I'm sure you'll enjoy ARTHUR CHRISTMAS!!!",1323561600,2,653,4.839285714285714
