5569398,5,B00BB8LRIE,"Thomas Reddmann (Nicholas Hope) is convicted of being the ""head hunter"" serial killer when they find him in an elevator with a bloody ax in his hand standing over a decapitated body. After he escapes from the institution, he manages to round up about a half dozen people instrumental in his conviction. They are literally chained to their desks and are tasked with proving him innocent or else they will be killed/tortured.

This ironically follows a ""12 Angry Men"" formula while oozing with dark comedic symbolism. Thomas is the ""regional manager"". He considers himself to be fair. His employees agree he is fair, but think the worse of him. They are allowed 3 bathroom breaks a day. He asks them to do the seemingly impossible under stress. In his fairness, he gives each employee 5 warnings (actually 4 warnings with the fifth one being fatal). These warnings are carved on their forehead, like a permanent record. Like most bosses he has a bad hair piece.

The film also contains a fair amount of blood and body parts.

5569399,4,B00BB8LRIE,"I saw this randomly at Target the other day and bought this not knowing anything about this movie... and considered how disappointed I was with some of the other Fangoria releases... ugh, pig hunt... and seeing that Tom Savini was the gore effects producer... i figured I would give it a shot.

I'm actually pleased that I picked up this flick. The story is actually kind of interesting and I sort of liked the whacked out ending.

The acting is actually not bad for a slasher movie, the writing is sometimes even clever, the gore is nasty, I liked the main character, the movie is well-filmed and there are actually a few scary moments.

Some good chase sequences, some good action scenes, plenty of blood... it gave me what I want in a slasher movie.

I've been so disappointed with slashers lately, that it's been awhile since I've seen a direct to DVD one that actually had something decent to bring to the table.

I don't want to ruin anything, but if you're up for a slasher with a bit of a corporate nonsense twist, pick it up.

I'm actually pretty glad I grabbed this blindly and I think it's one of the better flicks I've seen from the ""Fangoria presents"" series... it's also certainly much better than the direct to DVD slasher dreck you find at the Redbox.

Plus, it's only ten bucks, and I'm hoping that if Fangoria can actually continue to put out some decent flicks like this, I'll certainly continue to purchase and support them in hopes that we horror starved addicts will actually start to get some more quality slasher/horror flicks in the future.

Check it out. I wasn't disappointed.",1368748800,5,1603,4.6
5569400,4,B00BB8LRIE,"in this refreshing indie mix of revenge horror, slasher, and murder mystery from down under - co-writer Anthony O'Connor calls&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Redd-Inc-2012-Inhuman-Resources-Redd-Inc-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-4-Import-Australia/dp/B009UYFOLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Redd Inc. (2012) ( Inhuman Resources ) ( Redd Inc ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 4 Import - Australia </a>] an ""office giallo tribute"". The plot is rather tight and well-paced, with several twists and turns to keep you interested through 90 minutes, offering different perspectives for a murder case and the undesired results of subsequent conviction on shaky grounds that manifest in a crazy assignment and killing spree, just because those involved (detective/prosecution, eyewitnesses, defence, judge) did a flimsy job at it earlier.
Add to that ample blood and gore, the design and execution of which were overseen by Tom Savini, and professional camera work. The acting, especially that of Nicholas Hope with his RP accent in the leading role, is well above the average, with believable and consistent characterization for the most part.

The moral of the story, presented with some morbid humour, is one worth heeding (for instance, the gruesome fate of the outed fake seer charging over 5 Australian dollars per minute for her 'powers' is quite telling), particularly by corporate managers in the service of their slave owner shareholders: ""Don't start creating little office fiefdoms and lording the false sense of power over people,"" says the aforementioned script writer.

5569420,5,B00BB8LRIE,"I almost misread this last night as Nicolas CAGE starring in the movie instead of Nicolas Hope, haha.  Now that would have been quite the surprise!

Inhuman Resources is ideal for torture fanatics.  Imagine taking 6 people, locking them inside a small office room with a computer in front of them, making them type enough information throughout the course of the day, chaining them to their metal office chairs, only allowing them 3 bathroom breaks per day, and the real kicker- only 4 opportunities to be insufficient.  Because guess what the boss does when these trapped people make their 5th mistake?  Let's just say, gooey eyeball poppingly, blood squirtingly, head slicingly bad things happen!

Their boss, who was accused of murdering a girl in an elevator, makes it his personal mission to torture everyone who was at the scene of the murder but does in a clever way.  He presents himself as a perfectly normal boss working a tight schedule and demanding absolute sufficiency from his employees.  Making mistakes is a sign of carelessness and sloppiness, which won't be tolerated under his supervision.  If there was ever a case where you shouldn't argue with the boss, this is one of those times!  An argument will only be interpreted as disrespect.

The storytelling is phenomenal because there's at least two major twists during the final 20 minutes that will probably surprise you- the story clearly is NOT headed where you think it is.  You know, assuming the chained people will suddenly become free and eventually kill the boss.  Nope, doesn't happen that way.  And the most extraordinary part probably occurs one minute before the move wraps up.  I love the entire sequence of events leading to the ending.  It proves the writers had a well-written and articulate concept the entire time created for the purpose of messing with our minds.

My favorite gruesome moment -and this is a spoiler I admit- is when the one girl (who you just KNEW would be the next victim because of her increasingly snotty attitude) is tied to her office chair and her boss literally rips her eyes out in front of everyone, resulting in the other tied people who happen to be sitting next to her throwing up, gagging, yelling and screaming in fear.  But who's gonna rescue these people?  Who's gonna hear these screams?  Nobody, that's who!  Even better- when the chaos is finally over and the girls eyes had been ripped out (and delightfully stored in a nearby filing cabinet, lol), I really admire how the boss makes the young man next to the now eye-less woman clean up the blood around the keyboard.  And he BETTER clean up the blood so it looks nice and neat too.

It's also really twisted to think these people have to sleep next to the dead bodies the boss kills, since the boss prefers to punish everyone by not being too quick to remove the dead body from the room as a way to supply additional punishment.  Teamwork is key to success after all.  If one person's not on their game, everyone will be partially responsible.  Seems fair and makes total sense when you think about it.  This means while the people are sleeping in their chained chairs in the dark, they have to eventually persevere the smell that the dead body gives off, and see the worms and maggots forming right beside them which inevitably occurs when a dead body has been rotting long enough.  Isn't that just awesome?

Yes my friends, this is the ideal kind of horror.  Torturing chained up people so they can't defend themselves, and hearing their devastating screams so the already hopeless situation can only lead to an eventual death.  Such a rush watching these kinds of horror flicks!",1401235200,2,3660,4.761904761904762
5569421,4,B00BB8LRIE,"Once in a while an indie film will slap you in the grill with how it's got no right to be this watchable. 2012's Inhuman Resources unveils an unexpectedly good horror show, but it also works as a well-executed bottle story since a good chunk of the story happens in one room. Really, its only flaw may be that it does drag just a wee bit during the middle act. For the hopeful gorehound, there's a sack of unexpected treats in store.

It may be that Thomas Reddmann, fussbudget regional manager, took the term ""corporate headhunter"" too literally. Discovered in an elevator, bloody and hands clamped tight around an ax, that decapitated staff employee sprawled on the ground next to him, Mr. Reddmann is tapped as the notorious serial killer ""The Headhunter."" So went the trial, went the conviction, then went the sordid news that the incarcerated Mr. Reddman had been set upon and killed, his body burned and identified only by his arm found on the scene.

Six months after Reddmann's reported demise, six groggy strangers wake up in a barebones office workroom, each manacled to a computer station. There may or may not be slice marks on their foreheads, but more on that in a bit. Our point-of-view character is one of the six abductees, Annabelle Hale (Kelly Paterniti), a webcam stripper who's been trying to make a dent in the corporate world (so far, no luck). Peterniti submits the second-best performance in this movie, and I do like her pluck and her vulnerability. I think you'll find youself quickly on board with her as the prospective heroine, even if you're rendered indifferent by her fellow captives.

Their captor - and, of course, it's Mr. Reddmann - informs them that he was falsely accused of being a serial killer and that they're there to prove his innocence. He sternly warns that there are gruesome penalties for poor performance, for making mistakes, and for shirking work. An offense earns an ""employee"" a bloody line carved into the forehead. Should the employee accrue five such carvings, Reddmann conducts a harsh performance review. And, holy crap, you do NOT want a performance review.

Inhuman Resources (a.k.a. Redd, Inc.) presents a serviceable plot, something you don't often get in B-movie horror cinema. The film also dispenses moments of dark, satirical office humor, much of it coming courtesy of Reddman's dry delivery and bent use of office work terminology (""Remember, my door is always open.""). There's more to the story than just a psycho slasher doing his thing. As the handcuffed work force pores over the massive caseload of evidence that decided Reddmann's trial, a doubt gradually creeps in about their unhinged captor's culpability.

Low budget equates to not much CG which means more practical effects which is what I prefer in my horror flick. Awesomely, legendary goremaster Tom Savini supervises the effects, and his contribution hearkens back to that steady, old school style of filmmaking, and I appreciate that. As a bonus, Savini even slaps on his acting hat to play the minor role of ""Peter Bava."" Don't blink or you might miss that nice touch of a Dawn of the Dead poster decorating Bava's wall.

So, many kudos for the effective use of gore and carnage and for a narrative that keeps your interest, that delivers those frissons of unease and a darkly comic undertone. Kelly Paterniti is a game heroine, and I enjoyed her conversations with her five fellow ""cubicle drones"" as they try desperately to figure things out. There's a twist or two that you may or may not see coming. Looming above all else is British character actor Nicholas Hope's portrayal of our demented, micromanaging serial killer. Again, you'll glom on that there's more to Reddmann's story, and maybe by the end you even may find him, well, okay, a still demonic character but now also strangely sympathetic. In fact, in the epilogue scene, you may burst into big applause. And maybe Annabelle won't quibble at all that Reddmann's coffee mug reads ""World's Best Boss.""",1400889600,2,4000,4.901033973412113
