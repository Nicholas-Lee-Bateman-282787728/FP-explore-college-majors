IT WAS ""ACCIDENTLY ON PURPOSE"" ABOUT A CROOKED CAR DEALER SELLING CARS THAT WERE OUT OF A JUNK YARD AND FIXED UP TO LOOK GOOD AND DRIVE OK.
SOME OF THEIR SECRET FIXES WERE. RETREAD BALD TIRES, TURNBACK THE SPEEDO, FILL THE CRANKCASE, TRANSMISSION WITH HEAVY OIL AND SAWDUST TO QUIET DOWN NOISE AND FILL THE REAR AXLE WITH HIGH VISCOSITY LUBE FOR THE SAME PURPOSE.
THEY ALSO RELINED THE BRAKES WITH USED LINING!!
TO TOP IT OFF THEY OFFERED A FREE DEMO. THAN AFTER THE SALE, ONE OF THESE LITTLE STINKERS WAS INVOLVED IN A WRECK. CAPTAIN BRADDOCK THE RACKET SQAUD DEPT HEAD. PLAYED BY REED HOWELL, TRACKED DOWN THE CROOKED DEALER AND SENDS HIM TO THE SLAMMER.
GREAT LITTLE SHOW WITH DRAMATIC TWISTS AND TURNS AN LOTS OF OLD CARS FOR THE GUYS!!",1375660800,,854,4.5519480519480515
