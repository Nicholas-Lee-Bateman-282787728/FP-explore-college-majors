They jumbled the order a bit and Rogue never took on Ms. Marvel's powers so that restricts her from the comic level quite a bit. I hate that they always seem to make Iceman a young recruit, especially when he was one of the founding members of the X-men. The characters are well done, the voices fit how I envisioned them sounding from reading the comics for 30+ years. It's too bad the usual Marvel method of making a good cartoon for one season and stopping again happened with this one. The stories do flow together, unfortunately to resurrect the dark phoenix story concept yet again. It ends with a fade to the age of Apocalypse storyline from the 90s. Not sure if I'm glad it wasn't made or sad that they could have done something neat with it. Bottom line is the cartoon is well done, the characters are enjoyable (not sure I really understand the rational they gave Magneto thought) and a great way to spend some time. Don't get too invested since it's only the one season, you don't want to be disappointed wishing for more.",1446249600,3,1144,4.42654028436019
