8098288,4,B000CEV3BO,"Watch this demi-documentary for French Railway resistance action during WWII and compare some scenes to the movie ""The Train"" made 20 years later.
""The Train"" is one of my favorite train movies with several events from ""La Bataille du Rail"" being pay homage to. JMZ",1445904000,,265,4.911111111111111
8098289,5,B000CEV3BO,"I am a huge fan of movies about the Resistance in France, Army Of Shadows, the Silence of the Sea by Melville come to mind. This is another classic. I love Forbidden Games another great film by Rene Clement. Well here is his first feature and it delivers. Watch this on a double bill with John Frankenheimer's The Train starring Burt Lancaster.  The only problem- no subtitles! I understand some French but when people speak fast and there's background sounds I get lost.",1433980800,,471,4.674698795180723

Cast: Charles Boyer-Narrator, Jean Clarieux , Jean Daurand-Two railwaymen (cheminots),

Michel Salina-Director, Les cheminots de France.

A film about the resistance of the French Railwaymen during World War II in their efforts to weaken occupying German forces. Takes the example of the sabotage of a multiple train convoy - Operation Apfelkern - to reinforce German positions near the Allied landing points in Normandy in 1944. Despite the summary execution of real or suspected saboteurs, the railwaymen remain successful; the liberation of France is near (Liberation of Paris 25 August 1944).

Despite obvious patriotism - the film of course glorifies the resistance - it does not belittle the occupying forces, but reports the conflict rather in the style of a weekly newsreel. Official selection for Cannes Film Festival 1946: Grand Prix and Prix du Jury 1946.

8098293,5,B000CEV3BO,"I saw this movie many years ago when i was in my teens, and have been looking for it a long time and finally found it by its original name ""La Bataille du Rail"", the movie it self is old but it is still a very good movie of what the French Railways and staff did to annoy the Nazi`s in Second World War, and it shows from inception of the idea how to wreck the Steam Locomotives at the Depots to the final derailment (which is actual footage so i have been informed)which is very dramatic and the whole train is destroyed in the process,the actors are actual French Railways Employees in various scenes which adds to the realisim of the movie and just what they had to go through to attain the end result.
The movie is factual and it shows just how vital the Railways were in the Second World War, and how Freight trains are today are just as important in the movement of Military Hardware on a large scale.",1349827200,3,907,4.218390804597701
8098294,2,B000CEV3BO,"1) What's shown here is a distortion of history. The real French resistance, the one to which the French point with pride, didn't begin until late 1943. Yes, the movie does depict the events of the D-Day invasion - June '44 - but the implications are that this behavior was continual throughout the war. For an accurate account, I highly recommend ""The Sorrow and the Pity"".
2) The plot rambles back and forth, with much of the movie documentary footage. It isn't woven into the acted scenes very smoothly, and the progression of events therefore jumps around.
3) Video quality spans the gradient between poor and atrocious. There's been no attempt at restoration, much needed on a 60+ year-old film.
4) There are no extras on the DVD.",1256083200,6,735,4.75
8098295,5,B000CEV3BO,"""La bataille du rail"" is (who doubts?) one of the most emotive and realistic war films ever made but focused from a totally new perspective. It deals with the different procedures  tactics and strategies employed by these brave and anonymous railroad men, who risked their lives under the service of a free France.

The film is narrated in a semi- documental style, with a voice in off until the first third part of the movie, and explores all the set of trickeries, acts of sabotage in all the possible fronts; altering with a sophisticated web of communication by then, all the plans of the enemy in question.

Fascinating, mesmerizing and unforgettable film that fairly deserved the historical first Award in Cannes in 1946 as Best Film.

A classic and one of my preferred cult movies.",1187568000,10,788,4.814814814814815
