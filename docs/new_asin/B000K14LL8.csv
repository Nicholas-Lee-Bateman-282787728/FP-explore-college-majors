8153802,5,B000K14LL8,"We used to take our son's diagnosis of autism as a random dealing of the cards of life... as not something that we could really affect other than simple diet adjustments to slightly improve quality of life.

Now we have gotten serious about addressing and getting beyond the autism and Dr. Buttar is going to be our guy.

Dr. Buttar presents the argument that autism is triggered by Mercury poisoning at vaccination time.  The Mercury poisoning is the spark that ignites a series of fires.

Having paid close attention to the world since my son was diagnosed with autism in 2008 I believe the truth is on the fringe - often times ridiculed and pushed away.  With this belief, I fully embrace Dr. Buttar's findings and I hope that his methods of care make their way to all children who are on the Autism Spectrum.

As of this writing, Dr. Buttar is facing disciplinary action by the North Carolina Board of Medicine for unprofessional practices and billing.  The panel has recommended that Dr. Buttar be prohibited from treating children with cancer.  Now on to my critique of the video:

Although the scientific community at large cannot pin down the etiology (cause) of autism, Dr. Buttar claims in the question and answer portion of his video that heavy metals including mercury, lead, and arsenic are the sole cause of autism.  He offers no actual evidence for this assertion.

There are some heart-warming success stories by parents attributing the success of their children to Dr. Buttar's chelation therapy (which uses a non-FDA approved trans-dermal  form of the agent DMPS), but the video also shows these children engaged in behavior, occupational, and speech therapies, not to mention dietary and supplemental changes.  How do they differentiate between the success of each treatment?  They don't; all success is attributed to Dr. Buttar.

The video borrows heavily from Dr. Buttar's testimony before the US Congress.  Even though he is using the data he gives to support his treatment of autistic children, all the data given before Congress is on the effect of chelation therapy in adult women.  Dr. Buttar uses hair sampling to measure toxicity, but to date the American Medical Association has said that hair sampling is unreliable.

The testing appears to be set up so that there is no circumstance under which chelation therapy is NOT recommended for your autistic child:  If the levels come back high, then obviously, chelation is required.  If the levels come back low, then the metals must be present but your child is not capable of excreting the toxins.  Under these criteria, all autistic children need chelation. During the hearing before the North Carolina Board of Medicine one of the panelists asked Dr. Buttar's RNP if she thought it was strange that ""...every patient who walks through your door has heavy metal toxicity.""

Dr. Buttar is a disgrace to his profession.  Rather than a man ministering to the sick, he is a profiteer seeking to expand his wealth from people's misery and desperation.  His video is junk science and anecdote, and is mostly an infomercial for his clinic.  None of his research can be found for peer review (pubmed.gov) and none of his board certifications are recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties.  Parents of autistic children often have limited resources and I would encourage you to look for information elsewhere (see my other reviews).

If you have an autistic person in your life, I wish you strength, laughter, and success in your endeavors toward recovery.",1217376000,9,2987,5.0141987829614605
