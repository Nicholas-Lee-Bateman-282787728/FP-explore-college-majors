7988057,4,B00008YNNH,I like it a lot . it feels good to see something foreign for a change even if it was dubbed in English. I remember seeing Bud Spencer as a kid in a movie as a cop I just don't remember the title. That was a good movie too. Thanks,1353369600,,229,3.6
7988058,5,B00008YNNH,"When I ordered this movie I didn't realize it came under another name, Trinity Tracking For Trouble which appears as a double feature DVD titled Trinity Hits The Road and Trinity Tracking For Trouble.  This hasn't been available for awhile on Amazon.

In any case, A Fistful of Hell is really a good movie sans slapstick.  Bud Spencer (no Terence Hill in this movie) plays a good cop in Naples Italy who doesn't believe in carrying a gun.  As with so many cop movies, he is at odds with his new Super.  Fighting drug lords, murder and corruption, Bud Spencer, with fists flying, takes out the bad guys.  DeCarlo and Steno weave little side story lines into this movie which make it very entertaining and enjoyable.  Bud Spencer is always easy to watch,natural and easy going along with a good music score and interesting characters, this is a good movie to pass some time on a weekend.",1241827200,2,885,4.598726114649682
