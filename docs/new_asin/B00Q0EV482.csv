8689994,4,B00Q0EV482,"Jerry Joseph and The Jackmormons never disappoint. Add to that, if you want to see them perform, it's either live or this single DVD.  The disc is only stereo, but not surprising since it was filmed on a remote location, and not any big production. Don't let that dissuade you from getting this disc, it is plenty good, quality performance and of good video/audio quality.
The show was gleaned from three nights of performances, of which two are available online in their entirety. The third night, Jerry's voice was about gone, so not surprised that show isn't online. It's not evident which cuts came from which night on the DVD.
Get the disc, play it loud, tell all of your friends and go see them live somewhere.",1486166400,,716,4.637795275590551
8689995,5,B00Q0EV482,"This is what a live DVD oughtta be, an uncut unretouched snapshot of a night in Nicaragua with a no- frills high energy live band.  First off, Jerry Joseph is one of the most underrated songwriters out there.  Second, the Jackmormons are just the guys to help him get his point across.  If you've ever seen these guys live you'll appreciate that in addition to all the great SBDs that circulate you can finally see things unfold with better clarity than a cel phone video.  If you haven't had the privilege of seeing them live this is a great introduction to the energy that they are able to manifest onstage.",1462924800,,609,4.509090909090909
