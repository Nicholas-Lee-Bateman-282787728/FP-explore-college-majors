6817613,5,B00PLYTI44,"if you like a different kind of film - an experiential film where you get to see and feel what the character is going through rather than hit plot points, then this is a film for you. It will make you work as a viewer and challenge you. And it's funny at times. That odd - awkward funny that the Cohen brothers do so well.",1433808000,,322,3.9692307692307693
6817614,5,B00PLYTI44,"I think people misunderstand this film largely because the U.S. marketing of it was misleading. It's not an action movie but a deep and powerful drama. I had the good fortune of seeing it on a huge screen at The Deauville Film Festival and I was entirely enthralled.. the rest of the audience there loved it too. The atmosphere in the theater was one of intense presence...everyone fell deeply into the narrative and into the film's sublime imagery.  In fact it won a special jury prize at the festival. It is an intelligent and moving character study. A layered and complex psychological peek into how easily one's life can tip from the mundane to the tragic.  Jason Isaacs and Wes Bentley both give very nuanced performances that resonate powerful and real. Unlike some of the other reviewers on this page, I did not find this film to be boring in the slightest, the opposite in fact...the extraordinary cinematography and editing enveloped me to such a degree that lost myself entirely in the film's landscape. It is indeed one of desolation and silence, but also one of poetry and redemption. A must watch for viewers looking a topical and intelligent drama.",1433462400,,1162,4.805
6817615,2,B00PLYTI44,"I generally try to stay away from the extremes of 1 star or 5 stars, except for those extraordinary movies or shows but this came close to a 1 star event. It took so long to get to the point, man loses job, he loses control of the direction his life should go, the demands of the family weigh on him. he turns to thievery in his quiet desert looking town. I like Wes Bentley, he gets the whole down-trodden everyman thing. He can do low key as well as anyone, BUT, there is such a thing as TOO low key! He really annoyed me with the demure thing, his family give me and give me and never realizing there was something wrong very self centered wife and kids. I made it 45 minutes just after he began his life of crime. It was mind-numbingly painful.",1430179200,3,748,4.13013698630137

6817620,2,B00PLYTI44,"Bill Scanlon (Wes Bentley) is an overly honest insurance adjuster who just wants to provide for his wife (Vinessa Shaw) and two children. His dad was a policeman and he doesn't see eye to eye with his father-in-law. Fifteen minutes into the film we discover...or if you read the by-lines (PLOT SPOILER) he has been layed off and can't find a job. He has been lying to his wife about his situation.

Bill becomes an unlikely second story man, and while it pays the bills, he is really awkward at it. He has befriended a policeman (Jason Isaacs) who knew his father which complicates things.

The problem I had with the film, and why others may like it, was the dry unrealistic character of the main actor. He was overly honest without being religious. His ignorance of pool maintenance was inane. The crime scenes lacked any real excitement, as this was a character study of someone who wasn't close to being real.

If you want an action or crime film, go elsewhere. This production was a winner at the Deauville Film Festival, so maybe it's just me. I couldn't wait for it to end.

6817621,4,B00PLYTI44,An interesting movie that allows the viewer to see into the life of a desperate man.  He lies and steals and scares people to near death but he has a conscious and he wants desperately to keep his family.  So you cheer that he gets away with it.  There is a little gratuitous sex that wasn't needed but otherwise we found it enjoyable to watch.,1418688000,8,344,4.2615384615384615
6817622,4,B00PLYTI44,"Excellent film by most any measure, but be warned:this haunting film is unlikely to leave you smiling.

Can a film that shows no death, killing, treachery, betrayal, or evil-supernatural be any darker than this film is? I doubt it.

This is perhaps one of the darkest films I have ever seen. A deep, yet subtle suspense rides you from start to finish of the film's sadly realistic plot. You may at times find yourself yourself torn between suspense and tears. Yet, at some undefinable level I immensely enjoyed watching it. It is a film that I fear all too many of Americans can understand and relate to.

Either the actors are regular, ordinary, people that can follow a script, or the acting is excellent. The characters appear totally real with no hint of acting,over-acting, nor faux dramatics.

The cinematography and scenics are highly stylized, brilliant, and are totally congruent with the bleak theme of the film. The camera makes you feel that you are in the film as an observer, almost an intimate documentary, without getting in the way.  If Edward Hopper were a film director, you might look for his signature on the film.

Don't be looking for a lot of action. The film is not fast but very well paced. It is a film of despair, love, friendship, loyalty, integrity, hope, commitment, and brutal honesty.

Probably a bit over-priced for an Amazon Instant Video at this time, buy what else in our world isn't?",1418515200,8,1421,4.752032520325203

6817628,3,B00PLYTI44,"A grim new economy version of Jane Fonda's 1970's ""Fun With Dick and Jane."" But to me it is an out-of-date 1950's macho male fanatsy
scenario. In the time of the filming, most women with children work outside the home, so any guy's being all alone supporting his
family needing to stoop to desperate crime situations is totally unreal. Also the less affluent guy married to daughter of rich guy and needing to proof himself to her is a ""File of Thelma Jordon"" film noir cliche.

Instead, he goes off on his own and commits robberies to pay the bills.  It goes on and on with an ending that leaves one guessing.

It's about how far a person might go to save their family...or the Appearance of the American Dream?

Seriously... if this is how we should be living in this country - than we have truly lost sight of what is important.
Integrity - Family - or even Faith in God? Even those who don't believe in God, seem to know there is a Moral Standard to consider.

Does it make it right, the wrongs this man did???  I think Not.  Hopefully anyone who might ever aspire to going this far (in the film)... really needs to step back consider How badly are we in need of Material Goods to make our lives purposeful.  Because that is pretty much what most people are doing in the World - chasing after Material Goods to make Life worthwhile.  It's no wonder there is a lack of moral character for so many.

Maybe it's time for everyone to lose it all...?
