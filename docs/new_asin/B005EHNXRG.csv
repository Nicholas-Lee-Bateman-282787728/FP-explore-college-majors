8468241,5,B005EHNXRG,"If you have read Bram Stoker's Dracula, have a deep appreciation for it and are curious at all about the author himself and how he came about writing this book then this is definitely a documentary for you.

As someone who is interested in how authors come up with their stories, I found it fascinating to see the links made between some of Stoker's experiences in childhood on up through adulthood which, to me, definitely influenced his work on Dracula. I also found it interesting to see what and where Stoker researched that helped create the world within the book. I would call this part one.

What I would call part two is about the 15th century leader, who many call the ""real"" Dracula, Vlad Tepes. You learn about the man who certainly inspired Stoker in his creation of the Count and how the blending of fact and fiction has influenced the local leaders in Romania to welcome tourism to the area. You also learn how, to this day, Vlad's influence is present in the descendants of those he once ruled.

This is not a story about Dracula; the fictional character within the book. This is about the stories outside the book that helped influence his creation.",1408406400,2,1165,4.618357487922705

8468243,3,B005EHNXRG,"Alice Nelson, DVD Verdict --Since its first publication in 1897, Abraham 'Bram' Stoker's Dracula has never been out of print in the English language, but didn't reach its lofty status as one of the best selling books of all-time, until the motion picture industry took an interest and made countless movies about the Vampire from Transylvania. Many people, myself included, believed Vlad was the inspiration for Stoker's gothic novel, but the only things the two had in common were a penchant for bloodshed and the name Dracula. Dracula: The Vampire and The Voivode, takes a close look at the origins of Stoker's life and the events that influenced his most famous work. With the aid of the author's own notes and a half dozen experts on his life and the life of Vlad Tepes, the film attempts to separate fact from fiction, hoping to finally put an end to the Vlad/Drac controversy.

Despite the interesting and sometimes anecdotal stories told by MacIntyre, I had to fight to stay awake. The problem with Dracula: The Vampire and The Voivode is the lack of artistry employed in making the film. The details of Stoker's eclectic and fascinating life are delivered with little passion, which is surprising considering all of the experts used in the film are Stoker aficionados. The dull cold manner in which they speak just doesn't do him justice. I kept getting this woozy feeling of being in a lecture hall taking copious notes for the final exam. MacIntyre is the most enjoyable, though his thick Irish brogue makes it difficult to decipher some stories.

Once the focus shifts to the life of Vlad Tepes, the film wanders aimlessly, like a vegetarian in a slaughter house desperately searching for a way out. Tepes ruled for only six years and what little was discussed of his life was reduced to torture and murder. I still know very little about Vlad. Since he's the ""Voivode"" in the film's title, I expected to learn so much more. So the film isn't as much about either the vampire or the voivode, but all about Bram Stoker.

Dracula: The Vampire and The Voivode was shot in standard definition 1.33:3 full frame and with basic Dolby 2.0 Stereo. Nothing spectacular about the visual or audio quality. In fact, it has the feel of those old reel-to-reel projector movies they used to show in school. The only bonus feature, if you can call it that, is a slideshow of images used in the film.

Few mythic figures have ever captured the imagination, nor been as enduringly popular, as Dracula, made famous in Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic novel and sparking the earliest pop culture fascination with vampire folklore.

But much confusion surrounds Count Dracula, the fictional vampire, and Vlad Tepes (The Impaler) Draculea III (1431-1476), the voivode, Old Slavonic, meaning ""one who leads warriors."" A real-life Royal, many believe that Vlad III's violent, six-year rule of Romania and now-familiar surname inspired the famed, fanged figure.

Separating fact from fiction, ""Dracula: The Vampire and the Voivode"" - filmed in Transylvania, Whitby, London and Dublin - was produced in association with the Transylvanian Society of Dracula and features interviews with the leading experts on the subject.

Sink your teeth into this intriguing examination of one of the world's most infamous legends with an unprecedented look at: visits to Stoker's hometown of Dublin and his (and Dracula's) London haunts; a vivid account of the real-life count's arrival in the seaside town of Yorkshire; Vlad III's reign of terror; debunking the association between any Dracula (a common surname in the former countries of Yugoslavia) and the iconic Castle Bran; retracing Vlad III and Count Dracula's footsteps through Romania; and a look at how Stoker (who never visited Transylvania) left an indelible impression of Romania on the world.",1315872000,7,2052,6.393501805054152
