7536054,5,B017WLX1Q4,"Great documentary for former Tower Records customer!  Started going to Towers Records in Concord, California as soon as I could drive back in 1983. Was a regular customer until they closed. I grew up listening to KQAK out of San Francisco and Tower was the only place to find the best music.",1452988800,3,291,4.596153846153846

7536056,5,B017WLX1Q4,"I saw this at the Seattle International Film Festival and I was smiling all the way through. Tower was an icon in Seattle and Los Angeles (I've lived in both cities), and I spent a lot of time and money in each. The movie was a great throwback.  Who knew all of that was going on in a record store?",1449878400,26,298,3.966666666666667
7536057,3,B017WLX1Q4,"In Auburn CA, there was a Q&A after the film with three former Tower executives. This past June I was in Dublin, Ireland. There are actually two Tower stores presently in Dublin, and no mention of them in the film. Stan Goman, one of the execs, said they didn't know about those two stores until after they wrapped shooting, and that's why they weren't in the film. I'm thinking ""Really""? It's a glaring omission that should've been corrected.",1449187200,20,443,4.6923076923076925
7536058,5,B017WLX1Q4,"Colin Hanks did a great job, beginning with his choice of this unusual subject. Having had Tower in my life in LA, San Francisco and Seattle over the years, this film served as an effective memory aid for  times passed, when music was a cornerstone of my existence.  It explains where Tower came from, how it grew, and how it finally crashed. It's a business case history. It's a fun hike down trails of memory. On my (first) wedding night we went to Tower Records in North Beach (SF) to discover African music. I remember that elated feeling when I'd leave Tower and hit the streets with new albums in one of their distinctive bags. It's remarkable how music, the music business and the media used to listen to music has radically changed so many times by tsunamis of new technology. Good film.

7536059,5,B017WLX1Q4,"As an east coast boy, I didn't find Tower Records until I got to Japan in the late 80s. And what a great find it was.  I spent a lot of hours and a lot of money there but until watching this film never knew the story behind this amazing business.  What seems to have made it so special is that no one was out to make a mark, to be a maverick, to change the world or create an empire, but just to find a way to fit into the world by doing something fun and interesting.  And it seems it was just that kind of attitude that contributed to their demise.  They didn't see the danger in digital music and borrowed heavily when they should have been cautious and conservative.  The wonderful thing about this documentary is that apart from one, their chief financial officer, all the major figures in the company were available to interview and so you get an authentic insiders view at what made it happen and how it may have felt back in the day.  More than one of these former employees tears-up during an interview, suggesting Tower Records was about more than music or more than money.",1520726400,,1083,4.284313725490196

7536061,5,B017WLX1Q4,"I really enjoyed watching the origin of Tower records up until the end of it - everyplace but Japan anyway. Just a lot of memories here of the days you could walk into a record store and browse for hours at the gems you could unearth!

""No Music, no life"" motto lived with us for many years, until the
music business of vinyl and CD albums were first affected by MTV,
followed by later technology, specifically when the MP3's started
to surface at a lower cost and for single songs.  Thus, ""All things
must pass.""

Truth is no one can ever give a truly unbiased review of anything but I digress. ....it's great doc for all of us who loved and miss Tower. Funny ,touching and inspiring. ...Now , what happened to Boarders??",1501286400,,258,4.395833333333333
7536075,5,B017WLX1Q4,"Growing up in the sixties and seventies for me, as with most young people then, records were a part of our daily life. Possibly more so than ever before music shaped us and molded us. It was a part of our daily lives as transistor radios made it easy for us to have access to music. That paved the path for us to seek out the music we loved and in so doing directed us to the record store, that glorious haven of vinyl that drained us of money earned mowing lawns.

While record stores were mostly mom and pop joints at the same time chains began to pop up. Locally there was Karma Records and Peaches. But perhaps the most famous well known record store was Tower Records. Tower Records was the store in LA that was featured in numerous movies I saw in the 70s. The building with the huge replicas of album covers posted on the outside of the building, where rock stars showed for release parties and where they could also be found picking up the latest hits was well known no matter where you lived.

When I saw this documentary was coming out I was excited to hear about their story. Vinyl had disappeared from the music scene by compact discs but that didn't destroy the music store business. Then along came digital downloads. No longer did you have to go to the store to purchase your music. You could just get online and there it was. That brought about, to me at least, the end of the music store business. But watching this documentary I learned that wasn't exactly the case with Tower Records.

The movie starts at the beginning of the business, how it was small like all businesses are and then grew over time. It shows the gradual progression of the small business into the conglomerate that it was, an influence in the world of music it was so big. There was a time when Tower Records boasted that it made $1 billion dollars in a single year. But then things begin to change and the fortunes once thought to be never ending slowly changed.

This movie is incredibly well made. Some documentaries have that boring tone to them, a slow meandering pace that makes you anxious for it to get to the point. This film draws you in from the start with smooth storytelling and great visuals that take you back to the time when record stores ruled the world of music.

While watching the movie I found myself recalling all those hours spent in record stores looking at album art, many of those albums which I have retained for that very reason. I thought of looking at the new releases up front and the cut out albums I could purchase for less if funds were tight. I realized how many songs bring back certain memories to this day. I cant hear Band on the Run without thinking back to walking in a parking lot as I left a free outdoor concert and it blared from the sound system between acts. All of these thing tie in to visits to the record store.

And this movie brought back memories of that desire to see the mecca of all record stores, Tower Records. It was there in Rolling Stone magazine. It was featured in movies like FM. It was always there and now like many things from the past it is gone. Talk to young people today and they have no idea what Tower Records was and less about what a record store is.

The movie is well crafted and holds your interest from start to final credits. It includes some memorable music as well as commentary from various music royalty. It tells the story not only of the store but the history of records and the music business as well. Best of all it never gets boring. So watch this with someone young so they can see what it was all about. Show them what going to the record store was like. And relive some of those great memories you still have. Dream of what it would have been like to visit that best of all record stores, Tower Records while watching.",1500163200,,3801,4.337552742616034

Colin has his father's gift for choosing film topics that are really meaningful to people and doing a bang-up job.

Imagine my surprise (and excitement) when I saw there'd been one made about Tower Records. I didn't live near one growing up but any time we travelled north we would hit the two along the way. I loved that place. I bought my first CD there.
I thought this would just be a light hearted trip into nostalgia. I was completely unprepared for how hard it hit me. I'm not going to lie, the end had me tearing up.
Hearing the stories these people had to tell, the humble beginnings of TR, it was a great thing.

7536111,5,B017WLX1Q4,"This film is specifically about the rise and fall of Tower Records, but is also about the rise and fall of the brick and mortar music industry as a whole.  My heart was overflowing as I watched this, because this was my life.  I did not work for Tower, but for other music retailers which tried to copy the Tower formula, starting in 1973.  The family feeling, the deep relationship with the customers, the joy of sharing music was all real.  The new music release days with lines around the corner, the aisles and aisles of records of all genres, the nights when we would stay open until two or three in the morning because Saturday Night Live's musical guest would bring in hundreds of fans, the delight that would come to a good customer's eyes when I would play an LP I hoped they would love......so many beautiful memories.  Sure, there were a few moments I remember with sadness or disappointment, but for the most part, my experience over the years was very much in the Tower tradition.  Colin Hanks has done a great service with this ode to a now-gone era.  Tower and other retailers were very much of their time, and I am so happy that I was there.  This is a film I will watch over and over again for the rest of my life.",1479859200,,1231,4.344978165938865

The only places I can think of anymore (since I live near NYC) that are anything like this are Academy Records at 12 W 18th in NYC, and Princeton Record Exchange. I get the same kind of vibe about both of those places. Few true ""record""/CD stores are left and it's sad, but I'll stop talking about that.

The chronicles of the core people that ran the show are priceless. And you get Elton John, Dave Grohl, and Bruce Springsteen as bonus commentary. I found Elton John to be the most amusing.

7536121,5,B017WLX1Q4,"Colin Hanks did a stellar job directing this documentary about the years of vinyl and the wonder of Tower Records.  Sad to see this kind of loss - both in terms of a time when people actually bought music, and, shared a physical community with some really wonderful people.  The owner, Mr. Solomon, had a passion for music and a love of people and created the vision of the company by letting the people that worked for him bring their best to the love they shared.  I guess there will never be another Tower, but I hope something else with it's spirit and success may some day come to be - though I'm skeptical.  I grew up going to the record store every week and spending my weekly newspaper route earnings, about $12 - buying 3 or 4 albums and some singles, I really liked the ones with picture covers.  I rode my bike about 1 mile in suburban Detroit to Mumford Music and couldn't wait to get home to play my new records.  I've still got most of those albums & singles, built up quite a collection.  I still buy CDs, immediately load them into my computer & my iPod, but still love the physical thing.  I guess I'm old fashioned that way.  I doubt kids today will covet their digital files like I do my records & CDs, but as they say ALL THINGS MUST PASS.  However, often the things that pass were really sweet while they lasted.",1475539200,6,1333,4.296
7536122,4,B017WLX1Q4,"A five year fall from billion dollar sales to bankruptcy is a startling denouement, but not the message of Colin Hanks documentary on Tower Records. At the heart of the story is founder Russ Solomon, the staff he nurtured with his business, and the customers, artists and customer-artists they served for over fifty years. Solomon and crew tell the story of Towers rise from a counter in a Sacramento drug store to an international chain, and the technological advances that at first spurred growth, and later conspired with debt-financed expansion to prompt reorganization, bankruptcy and liquidation.

Tower was both a beneficiary and victim of major technological and social changes. Throughout the 1960s and 70s, baby boomers came of age, music became a cultural rallying point, and record stores turned into social gathering places. Towers first standalone store opened on Sacramentos Watt Avenue in 1961, and their second on Broadway in 1965; but what really signaled the future was the 1968 opening of the San Francisco store at Columbus and Bay and the 1970 opening of the Los Angeles store on Sunset Blvd. Filled with vast inventory, knowledgeable staff and billed as The Largest Record-Tape Store in the Known World, Tower Records was unlike any record shop ever seen.

By the end of the 1970s, Tower had more than twenty stores along the West Coast, and expanded successfully to both the East Coast (with a landmark New York City store), and internationally with stores in Japan. With expansion came opportunities for staff growth, and Solomon actively grew his clerks and junior employees into senior staff and executives. Towers CFO Bud Martin provided the corporate yin to Solomons more freewheeling yang, but it was Solomons gregariousness that set the tone for the companys culture, and made it the place to work for many young people. Each Tower store had its own personality, and within each store the major genres (i.e., rock, jazz, classical) often felt like independent shops.

Tower rode a wave of unparalleled musical creativity and concomitant growth in the record industry. They innovated in advertising, store displays (both inside and outside the stores), and developed the in-house music magazine, Pulse! When a recession hit the music industry in the early 80s, Towers fortunes were not only salvaged but accelerated by the high price point of the newly introduced CD. The late-80s and 1990s saw profits grow, but also planted the seeds of Towers eventual downfall: over-expansion and digital music. The former included unsuccessful stores in Asia and Latin America, and bond financing that would turn into crushing debt. The latter provided the technological foundation that would obsolete physical musical retail.

Even before debt and digitalization took their toll, the entry of mass market retailers - Walmart, Target and Best Buy - created pricing pressure that deflated the CD balloon. Napster may be fingered for triggering piracy (the old saw how do you compete with free?), but its real impact was in salting the wound of listeners who wanted to buy songs from an industry that wanted to sell albums. To be fair to Tower, few in the industry saw how quickly MP3s would erode CD sales, or that on-demand services would subsequently erode downloads. Terrestrial retailers born to a culture of collecting couldn't pivot into a world of networked borrowing.

By 2000, CFO Bud Martin had retired and Russ Solomon had been sidelined with heart problems. Martins replacement had taken on debt to fuel expansion, and Solomons son Mike had taken the helm. The son hadnt the magnetic, rallying personality of the father, and with sales flattening (for the first time since 1966), the debt holders instigated management changes whose ideas failed to prevent the downward spiral. The money-making Japanese stores were spun off, the American business pruned of its differentiators, and by 2004 the company filed for bankruptcy and was liquidated in 2006.

Interviews with celebrity customers Bruce Springsteen and Elton John exemplify how dazzling the Tower shopping experience was, and testimony from employees paints a colorful picture of the backroom. There were tears and anger at the end, but the reader board closed the Watt Avenue store on a fatalistic note: All Things Must Pass - Thanks Sacramento. Hanks 96-minute documentary is more a love-letter than an analysis, as Towers impact on local record stores isn't discussed, and the fate of its peers (Wherehouse, Peaches, Musicland, Virgin, etc.) is unexplored. But for those who spent countless hours roaming the aisles and perusing the stock of Tower stores, this is a love letter worth viewing. [2016 Hyperbolium]",1475452800,,4701,5.195250659630607
7536123,5,B017WLX1Q4,"We don't have enough things to brag about so forgive us for being so proud :)  I saw the theatrical release last October at Tower Theater on Broadway. Since I did not come of age until the 80s, I could see that I had missed the really super crazy fun times of the 60s & 70s, but no matter. Tower records was still just as significant to me, having spent hours and hours at the Broadway store trying to figure out which 45 to spend my 99 cents on. And once I got my drivers license, I got to hit the Watt Ave store which was sooo sooo big. Whether there was or wasn't anything else to do, Tower was the place to go -  they were even open on Christmas day and other holidays!!! Having moved to LA in the 90s, I was lucky enough to experience the Sunset, Westwood, and Marina del Rey stores too,  I remember my heart breaking when I saw the bankruptcy signs go up.

Seeing all the scenes inside the stores transported me back in time, and yes, it was bittersweet. After seeing the film, everyone seemed to lock eyes as we walked out of the theater, and we all nodded at each other in silence. It felt like we were one big family bonded by this special experience and I felt sad that those under age 35 will never know this. Today, Tower Cafe sits at the old drug store location, next to the theater. Its not quite the same, but with its ecclectic menu and friendly vibe, its a nice place to hang with friends and remember old times. And its open late - I highly recommend you stop by if you go through Sac.  At night, you will see the orange and green neon lights of the Tower from the freeway.

Im excited to own a copy of the DVD now. Definitely watch it with friends and family to enjoy some good memories.  Thank you Russ Solomon and Colin Hanks for this wonderful film.",1474243200,3,1771,4.145772594752186

7536127,5,B017WLX1Q4,"All Things Must Pass is a documentary about the rise and fall of Tower Records, the retail music chain that once was the coolest place to buy records and later CDs. The film traces the gradual growth of Tower from its founding by Russ Solomon in a Sacramento drugstore in the 1960s through its expansion to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and beyond, attracting not only fans but artists such as Bruce Springsteen and Elton John as loyal customers.

Director Colin Hanks, in his feature film directorial debut, provides a nostalgic look at the heyday of Tower Records, when it was a home-away-from-home for many young music lovers. Interviews with former employees are often funny and surprising and always reflect a fond wistfulness for a time and place that was special.

With sales dwindling as alternative music sources, such as iTunes, dominated the industry, Tower began to close stores. Its last store in America bit the dust in 2006. Tower still thrives in Japan, however, where it is hugely successful.

The documentary is especially moving for those who were a part of the Tower experience  looking through bins at new releases, asking knowledgeable employees to recommend music, and making weekly forays, cash in hand, to the local Tower store.

There are no bonus features on the unrated DVD release.",1473897600,,1316,4.9908675799086755

7536137,5,B017WLX1Q4,"I see that there are already 171 reviews posted here, most of which were based on the theatrical version (or steaming one). The BluRay version seems to have been released earlier than the DVD (which won't be available until September 13, 2016). I was sent an advance copy of the DVD version, so that is what this review is based on.

Director Colin Hanks (yes, Tom Hanks son by his first wife) is making his feature film debut as a Director. (He had many roles in some of dads films. Though he centers on the life of Russ Solomon who founded Tower Records in Sacramento in 1960, and follows the company to its closing their last company-owned store on 2006, this is also a story of the record business. Most of the management at Tower started at the beginning and are interviewed here. Sometimes the same story of drinking and doing drugs in the back room get repetitive and about 15 minutes of these could have been deleted. But its still a fascinating story.

The DVD version has no bonus features (there are deleted and extended scenes on the Bluray).

If you ever spent time in a record store going through the stacks, youll definitely want to see this film.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7536138,5,B017WLX1Q4,"Review-I have watched, hundreds and thousands of documentaries in my life. Some documentaries really affected me personally and others helped change the way I viewed certain things. No documentary hit me harder than this one.  All Things Must Pass is the documentary about the history of Tower Records. This documentary covers its humble beginnings, when it was merely a drug store that sold records for 3 cents. This documentary also covers the era when Tower took over the world. The third act of this film, covers the heartbreaking part, the eventually demise. We had a Tower Records in New Orleans. Right in the French Quarter on Peters Street. Let me paint you a picture. You get out of your car in the paid parking lot. You walk across the street, you have the Riverwalk Mall. Right past there, you have Borders Book Store. Then, you have Tower Records. Right beside it is Tower Video Store. Right beside there is the Virgin Records. Then, you leave there and walk a block, you have Tipitina's and the Hard Rock Cafe. I discovered Tower Records when me and my best friend went to New Orleans to see a concert. We got there a few hours before and were going to go drinking, but we saw this huge record store. Which, shocking enough, you could bring alcohol inside when you shopped. I would shop there so much, they issued me a mailbox. They let me write down things that I love to buy and would put them in it, when they came in. Virgin, also did the same thing for me.

That being said, Tower was the store you went into to have fun.  This documentary you have musicians like Elton John, who were just as passionate about this store as I was, talking about the impact this store had on him. The film centers on owner Ross Solomon. This story also has people who have been with Ross for the majority of the life of Tower as well. Until you watch this film, you really never realize how revolutionary this store truly was. The first sign that the music industry is dying, Tower Records only exists in Japan. Which, is my number one priority on my bucket list. I have to go to Japan and see this store. I have been to HMV stores in Spain, and drove to New Jersey to see a show at the Wetlands. I wish I could claim I been to CBGBs or Music Empire in Germany. If you are a fan of the Tower Music experience as I was. I would highly recommend watching this film. I cried more in this film than any other film this year. When I saw the inside of the Tower Records, it hurt that the experience was killed for me. If you are a music fan, this is a must own.",1471996800,,2555,4.31875
7536139,5,B017WLX1Q4,"If you are looking for a good film to watch, I highly recommend this documentary about the late, great Tower Records! (Sidenote: All Things Must Pass was named after the title song and solo album written and performed by the late, great George Harrison, for those who didn't know.)  I bought and watched it on DVD just last weekend.  The film is fast-paced, family-oriented (like the franchise), and very reflective and informative. Tower Records founder Russ Solomon is a hoot; definitely amongst the most liberated entrepreneurs (of historic international chains) when it comes to handling the human elements of business! Whether you love music or not, this film is definitely worth the watch! I recommend buying it from your local music store still in existence, to help reflect the premise of the film!  If you were a frequent, enthusiastic Tower Records customer like me, this film will present you with an astounding nostalgia trip.  Fortunately, if you have the chance to visit Japan, you will find that Tower Records still stands proudly throughout the nation!",1471824000,,1068,5.085714285714285
7536140,5,B017WLX1Q4,"All Things Must Pass, no not the utterly fantastic George Harrison landmark triple LP, the story of Tower Records.  In the title theres a melancholy sadness since we know it alludes to the passing of the LP, then the decline of all other physical music media.  Its only fitting a documentary of an amazing music related business is entitled after an equally amazing actual album, one that broke new ground being an over-the-top triple-LP set by a Beatle.

Tom Hanks son Colin is behind this lovingly put together visual journey of the Tower Record story.  If ever a there was an untapped gargantuan market at a particular time in history that was expertly tapped it has to be the record business as defined by Tower Records.  What a ride it was.  Probably the most loosely structured billion-dollar business empire ever created that wasn't based on criminal intent.  Quite the opposite, it was based on the joy of music and how it enhanced life.

Watching the documentary you get the feeling it wasn't entirely the loose management, the sometimes ill-advised entry to strange foreign markets, or even musical tastes of the times that killed Tower Records.  It was the changing technology as we now see taken even further with on line streaming.  Could the company have survived, like Japan, and flourished even as the physical media sales sagged?  Thats the huge question.  Things started to break, perhaps, before the exit of founder Russ Solomans right hand accountant having to exit due to health.  His exit, however, started a new chapter where the banks took over.  Everything the bank dictated broke a little more of the foundation that built the company while never, actually, fixing anything.

As I sit and write this I read LP sales are growing once more.  Jack White has actually built a new record pressing plant in Detroit.  Granted, its just a small thing, but its a sign.  The real sign will be when once more theres just a single Tower Records store somewhere in the United States.  Music is such a powerful medium I wouldnt bet against it.  If you have a love of music and have good memories of spending time in any record store you simply must watch this.  A great American success story that runs against most everything they teach in business school.",1471651200,,2269,4.781491002570694

I was not surprised at the influence Tower had on the recording industry, particularly after they opened up their Sunset Blvd store in Los Angeles. Didn't realize though that many big recording stars such as Bruce Springsteen and Elton John shopped there.

It's a fascinating look not only at the rise and fall of Tower Records, but the recording industry's changes over the years.

7536194,4,B017WLX1Q4,"Tower Records began life in 1960 in Sacramento with Russ Solomon at the helm.  He was the son of a hypothecary who dabbled in used records.  This documentary helmed by Colin Hanks provides an opportunity for Solomon and the numerous men and women who began their working lives at one of the record stores and stayed until the bitter end in bankruptcy in 2006.  One thing is clear.  They loved working at the store and they loved Solomon.

The film takes us from those early days of expansion in California to global expansion.  It takes us from 45-singles to cassette tapes to vinyl albums to CDs and various other media that went away quickly.  Its pretty clear that vinyl gets most of the love although those early days of CD seemed promising.  A smaller disc, with no pops or crackles.  Numerous luminaries provide some personal stories.  People like Elton John, who insists he spent more money at Tower than anyone ever.  We also here from Dave Grohl and Bruce Springsteen and others.  Celebs frequented the stores on a regular basis.

Eventually, some bad financial decisions and the oncoming wave of digital singles, MP3s and streaming combined to doom the once highly profitable company.  As one who lived through the era and spent a lot of time flipping through record bins, I wiped away a tear or two.  Fortunately, vinyl records are having a comeback and I still have my old collection.",1460505600,,1396,4.734439834024896

It covered the beginning and end of this great enterprise, but there was no middle story.  Living in Sacramento and growing up with Tower (from its early beginnings in the Tower Drug store at 16th and Broadway to mega locations throughout the nation) I felt the movie failed to capture the essence of what it was like to be a towerholic.  Missing too were interviews (or even mentions) from some of the key employees whom I felt put Tower on the map - John Schairer, Carl Mickelakos, and Charlie Shaw - just to name a few.  In summary, there is so much more to this story than what is presented in this film.

But the Blu-Ray is not about that - it's about a how one of the country's most iconic brands did not adapt to changes in the industry and died.

1.  Anyone who enjoys pop culture history.  Honestly, it's one of the better documentaries I've seen in awhile about pop culture.
2.  Anyone who has a love for business stories. I plan on using this film if I ever have to teach a business class someday.
3.  Anyone who has a history with Tower Records.  I mean, most of us teenagers from the 60s to the 90s would have some kind of history with music, period.  For us who were lucky enough to live close enough to a Tower Records and loved music (or even LIKED music), you have a story or two about Tower Records.  This will be a fun trip down Memory Lane for you.

The kind of people who would NOT like this documentary:

1. Anyone who is lukewarm about music or music history.  Seriously. You're wasting your time.
2. Anyone who don't like a lot of cursing or have judgement for films that celebrate the party scene.  They definitely stories about the music industry and the drug scene, especially in the 60s and 70s.  This could be offensive to some conservative viewers.
3.  This is definitely not a film for children.

I worked at Tower Posters in 1980, then Tower Records and when it opened Tower Video in Tacoma and Tower Video in Seattle. I met Russ, of course and I have many stories. The Tacoma store was lively and interesting, not as mellow as Seattle, but Seattle seemed to get better ""in stores"". I still have Tower friends, though we have lost some great people along the way hopefully not to  the big Tower Records in the sky. Tower helped me out after I got out of the service, through acquiring my University degree from WWU and for a while after. It helped transition me out of the service, into and out of college. I'll never forget it. None of us will It was an experience on so many levels. I tweeted Colin Hanks and thanked him for this documentary getting done and he responded.

7536234,5,B017WLX1Q4,"I must say it comes across more as an educational movie on how to run a business or what it takes.  A lot if not all of it can be duplicated because he came in at the start of the LP era...long play...ironically ends shortly following the end of the SINGLE in this case the CD single which eliminates buying a band or an artist best song on the album so you'd have to buy the full length CD.  Personally this resonates to me considering all the time I spent in Tower record stores.  Yes I spent hours and hours in them on Friday nights.  I worked in manhattan and walked from the Wall Street area to the Broadway location or the Village location although technically not in the Village.  After doing what I had to do eating dinner browsing i'd take it there and go to the main record store where you could literally listen to 100s of CD and wind up buying 10s of CDs bought a lot of independent label CDs based on their sounds and recordings (what else is there to go by?), then hit the bookstore, the video store, the close out store, and skipped the Classical store which I did visit once in awhile but not that often.  I also applied for a job and did a brief interview where I found out i'd only be making 7$ an hour in 1997 which i'll be honest I would've loved to work in a place that actually would've had me excited to go to but my parents lived in Florida and I needed to be able to pay rent so I wasn't able to work there so I got a very boring job that paid 2X + the $$...personally this movie fascinated me because the store fascinated me and even though I watched this and what I got was a business lesson I do know I will watch this video/movie again and again because it does have a lot of memories for me that will never happen again...yes It was joyful being that much into the music and I know i'll never be that much into the music again...so the movie did have a lot of meaning, feeling and impact at least for me I don't know how every other person will feel about it.",1456358400,5,1989,4.087179487179487

There was a brief appearance by Elton John but I was a tad disappointed as the lens spotlighted behind the desk personalities instead of telling about the rise and fall.  It's very telling that the consumer aspect was very secondary and that was most likely what led to their downfall.  It still behooves me how they could not expand without borrowing.  The record industry made tons of money from 1970-2000 yet their were financially leveraged to the max.

As a side note, one mismatch that Tower made was the elimination of vinyl in their stores in the 90's.  How could you have ""record"" in your name and not have any to sell?  Furthermore, at any given point a majority of back catalog items of all genres are out of print.  A used section of vinyl and cd's would have addressed those consumer needs with a computer system that would reject overstock of overly common and mainstream titles.

7536252,5,B017WLX1Q4,"When I was in the Air Force and had trips to Sacramento in the late '60s I discovered the Watt Avenue store.  Later I was stationed in Sacramento, lived close to that store, and spent a lot of time in it adding significantly to my LP collection, including the namesake album for this film.  (That included The Moody Blues' ""Every Good Boy Deserves Favour"" with a flexible, satiny album cover -- my favorite Moodies album.  I didn't know it was imported from England until a record clerk in Maryland said I couldn't possibly have gotten it the year before because it had just come out in the US.)  I also didn't know the Watt store was the very first one, or that Tower Records would become a global phenomenon.  Years later I was ecstatic when Tower opened a store in the suburb of Washington DC where I lived.

This documentary brings back so many fond memories and fills in all the details of the evolution of Tower Records that I never knew.  It has given me special feelings that have stuck with me long after my viewing of it was over.

7536254,4,B017WLX1Q4,"Who woulda thunk Colin Hanks would turn out such a great first film. Dude, hang up the acting, cuz if you make movies anywhere near as great as this one, you'll be long remembered.

Tower's story mirrors that of empires past, rising and falling. But for those who can't see beyond the superficial it's too bad, because there's lots of real gold in this mine. That Solomon wanted to do business HIS way is in itself a great story, but that those who bought in made it work is jaw dropping. For me, the key insight is the love they had for music and the man, the culture that let them earn a living outside of the straight world. That's no small thing, because for anyone creative, or who relishes freedom, the straight world is like cod liver oil.

I happen to be a born and raised Angeleno and a boomer, so ATMP has special meaning for me - for us, Tower on The Strip was Mecca - we always wished it stayed open at least til 2 on weekends. Whatever, Tower was the joint, where you'd see a limo pull up and out would step Sean Penn to do some shopping. Nic Cage another night. Tower, as much a Strip icon as The Whiskey, The Roxy or Gazzaris.

That Solomon got that building erected for $75k is absurd, completely foreign to today's LA, which  is  so  out  of control development wise it's absurd.

I mentioned that the employees had a special affection for Tower, a love, and I think that shines through with Colin's filmmaking as well. Very well directed. I hope he finds for his next subject something he loves as much, so we can be treated - this guy's got talent.",1455235200,3,1567,4.3061224489795915

7536257,1,B017WLX1Q4,"I think the 44 people who gave this the 4.95 star rating it has were all in the movie. Here is the plot:
- Great initial idea
- Circumstances of history grow the company despite the founder's best efforts to constantly destroy it
- ""Hi, I'm the internet""
- Goodbye Tower Records
- Except for Japan (oddly enough) where 85 store still thrive.",1454716800,9,341,4.428571428571429
7536258,3,B017WLX1Q4,"I think it was an interesting story about a special time in our history. It seemed to sugar coat Russ Solomon's involvement in the business's collapse, as a businessman I would say he wasn't that smart or great, but a person that was at the right time and place. His main attribute was no fear, but ego and vanity blinded him in the reality's of business.  Unfortunately the people that worked for him and trusted him paid the price. I  think the movie was another fantasy produced by Russ Solomon.",1454716800,6,498,4.522222222222222

7536264,2,B017WLX1Q4,"Kind of a pointless, overlong documentary.  The Internet changed the music world  and Tower Records went under as a result.  Not much of a story there.  You can say the same thing about big bookstores, Eastman Kodak film, Camera retailers, Video Stores, independent movie theaters, etc.  None of the talking heads in this film have anything illuminating to say.  All they do is reminisce about how nice it was to work at Tower Records.",1454371200,3,435,4.8108108108108105

7536266,2,B017WLX1Q4,"This is concerning the packaging of this item. Amazon makes a blu ray copy of this when it is ordered or something to that effect, that is stated on the webpage. The information on the back of the sleeve insert has the barcode over a portion of the documentary description. Please don't get me wrong, I know what it is about and look forward to watching it. However, you would think with just a little quality check, someone would have noticed the barcode over the description, it just takes away from what I am sure is an otherwise professional production. Again, I am sure he doc itself will be top notch, somebody just should have been awake at the printer. If this nitpicky little thing doesn't bother you, and the subject matter interests you, I think this will be a great doc.",1454371200,15,782,4.514084507042254

7536268,1,B017WLX1Q4,"What a huge disappointment. This film is amateurishly cobbled together. And if there's an interesting story to tell about Tower Records, this film doesn't tell it. Instead it's mostly about a handful of former employees talking about, um, going to work. Or something equally uninteresting to anyone except themselves. It gets off to a promising start, with some background about the company's founding. Beyond that, there's no there there. What a disappointment.",1454284800,3,462,5.430555555555555

7536281,5,B017WLX1Q4,"Great documentary, but this is coming from someone who was the property manager of the Watt Avenue (1st Store) and Broadway (2nd Store). My grandfather, Sam Gordon, was Russ's first Landlord for those first two Tower Records. My Grandfather told me the story, that he rented to Russ with no co-signer at the Watt Avenue store. He was proud to help someone that eventually could buy and sell him 10 times over. One of my best memories is in the late 90's Metallica show up at the Watt Avenue to play a complete set to well over a thousand fans in the parking lot. Even knowing the story I could not help feeling excited in the beginning and heart broken at the end; compliments to Colin Hanks directing.",1453593600,20,702,4.4921875

The anecdotal interviews from mostly original employees of Tower Records really brought back some memories.  The late Russ Solomon's stories of his humble Tower beginnings up to the very end are very heartfelt.  Elton John and Bruce Springsteen were also invaluable to the documentary.
