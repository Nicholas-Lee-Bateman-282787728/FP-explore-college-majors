When I began watching the pilot, I thought it started out as a bit bland, and almost stopped watching, but by the end of the pilot, I was hooked. The way Maki is determined to BE the character she is playing (figuratively speaking), and the amount of emotion and soul she puts into it is what makes this show worthwhile.

So I thought, 'I'll buy the dvd'. Good choice, right? I like the show a lot, and I can't exactly watch it anywhere else now.

Well, it would be better if I entirely comprehended Japanese, because the English subtitles look like a few words from the actual dialogue thrown in a blender with other random English words. They're actually quite humorous until they begin to detract from the show. (And then it's just irritating.) Thankfully, the show isn't overwhelmingly hard to follow if you can't understand Japanese. However, if you don't understand Japanese, (or watch the poorly translated subs) you do end up missing some of the plot, and therefore some of the heart and depth of the show. I wish the person who subbed Taburakashi for Crunchyroll had also subbed this dvd! (if it ever comes back on Crunchyroll, I recommend that you watch it there to get a better idea of the plots of the episodes)

However, the acting in this series is enough to merit the fifteen dollars it takes to buy it. I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a little taste of the language barrier (or understands Japanese), and likes a good dramedy. (And doesn't mind getting a little teary here and there! [I don't cry at movies, usually, so I'll warn you now that this show has some tearjerker moments.])",1379203200,,1768,4.678456591639871
