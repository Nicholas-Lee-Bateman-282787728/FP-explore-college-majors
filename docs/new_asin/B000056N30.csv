1398276,4,B000056N30,This was a very good movie. It shows a character that we should all have; that we are all human and we should be accepted for our differences.,1217116800,,142,4.107142857142857
1398277,5,B000056N30,"The Tic Code has two main focuses - its three main characters, ten year-old Miles, his mother Laura, and professional jazz musician Tyrone; and the Tourette's Syndrome that afflicts two of those characters.  Miles (Christopher George Marquette) is a little guy burdended with Tourettes and an unhappy school life (no surprise there) who finds solace in the piano, at which he's a budding prodigy.  He follows the careers of a number of jazz musicians with great fervor, and eventually strikes up a friendship with musician Tyrone Pike (Gregory Hines, in his best performance), who frequents a local jazz bar.  The relationship of the two takes on father-son tones, and is strengthened by the bond they share as Miles discovers Tyrone is also a Tourettes sufferer.  The improvisational nature of jazz music has actually helped Tyrone to hide the tics that spontaneously burst out, including during his performances (it's even theorized that a couple of real-life jazz greats may gave had the disease, and by actual stock footage you can see where the idea came from).  Having one of his heroes have the same disorder he has helps Miles come to terms with it; meanwhile Tyrone is very protective, seeing this young kid with the same thing he's had all his life.  It's not stated in the movie, but Miles is actually at an age where TS has generally yet to kick in like it probably will in a couple more years, and part of the movie's subtext is that Tyrone knows it's probably going to get worse.  Meanwhile, Tyrone and Miles's single mother Laura (Polly Draper) meet and become attracted to one another.  It may sound like from the first time the three cross paths it's all clear sailing but it's not, it's a very rocky road.  For one thing, although the term 'Obsessive Compulsive Disorder' is never mentioned it seems highly likely that both Miles and Tyrone have it as well, which is no great stretch; TS and OCD are closely related and a high percentage of people who have one have the other as well.  OCD is obsessions and overpowering urges that can usually be reined in (although not necessarily instanteously, like people tend to think) although even when one manages to control them they still muck up the mind; Tourettes is tics - either verbal or physical - that generally can't be reined in once they decide to activate themselves, any more than someone can tell their heart to stop beating or their digestive processes to take a breather; the best way to defuse them is to try and minimize stress, you'll notice in the movie that both Tyrone and Miles seem to experience outbreaks more often under stressful conditions.  So the apparant OCD really helps complicate things in the film.

  It's a great tale of the evolving relationship between the three main players, and it's also, for once, a realistic onscreen glimpse of TS, far more so than several comedies that have had that angle in there.  Another inaccurate depiction has come across the news media with suggestions (usually originating with lawyers) that TS/OCD causes criminal behavior.  A detailed rebuttal of this nonsense would take too long to go into and isn't all that relevant to the movie; my point is that this is one of those disorders where it's very refreshing to see a depiction do a Credible job of handling its subject matter.  For someone who has a loved one with TS or OCD, or even has it themselves, this movie is recommended watching (which isn't to say it isn't great on its own merits!) and could actually be a big help, including to children with it.  That fact makes it ironic that the MPAA chose to try and Hinder young kids from seeing it by giving it an R rating, based almost solely on 'coarse language' (for even more irony, such language occasionally manifests itself as part of the tics in certain variants of TS).  I'm going to restrain myself from further commentary on the whole 'movie ratings' things and just finish with a couple more observations about Tic Code.  Fans of jazz music will be interested to know that several real-life musicians have roles in the film.  And the vibrant feeling inherent in the movie make it seem like this was real labor of love from its makers; incidentally actress Polly Draper not only played Laura but wrote the movie's script.  All in all, one of the best dramas out there, and definately deserving of a higher profile.",1208217600,3,4363,4.743386243386244
1398278,5,B000056N30,"This movie is an excellent family drama, which also manages to educate the viewer on the topic of Tourette Syndrome, while remaining entertaining.",1168300800,,146,5.391304347826087
1398279,5,B000056N30,"As a person with Tourette Syndrome (Touretter), I laughed, cried and had a knot in the middle of my stomach as I saw my childhood flash before my eyes in this film that explores differenece in various ways: Tourette Syndrome, obviously, but also isolation and lonliness, emotional withdrawl and barriers to intimacy, past bad relationships and breaking through a wall of a lifetime of hurt, anger and danger.
I would recommend this film to anyone who cares about LIFE in a larger sense. The portrayal of Miles, the young boy w/Tourette is touching and extremely compelling--very true to life. Polly Draper and Gergory Hines make a credible couple, coming together, dancing for fleeting moments and then glancing off each other like mercury before a union that makes complete sense on many levels.
Please buy this vidoe or DVD and support a widening of understanding of not only Tourette Syndrome, but of difference in all its implications.",1022803200,19,939,5.0256410256410255
1398280,5,B000056N30,"This is an excellent movie about a twelve year old boy, Miles, an incredibly talented jazz pianist, who has Tourette Syndrome, and the adult male, Tyrone, a sax player, who befriends the boy. It turns out that he, too, has the same affliction, though his manifestations  are more controlled. This is also the story of Miles' mother, who tries to grapple with the issue, while the boy's father, from whom she is divorced, is in complete denial. This is basically a story about life, and the way Tourette Syndrome touches upon it.

Here, the young boy is played by the very talented Christopher George Marquette, who does an incredible job of conveying the agony of one who suffers from Tourette Syndrome. His performance is so terrific and rings so true that, at times, I wondered if he, in fact, had the illness. The role of Tyrone is well played by Gregory Hines, who is wonderful in the role of the musician who has Tourette Syndrome but does not want to speak of it. Polly Draper, as the boy's mother, is excellent, as she struggles to cope with her son's illness and its effect on his psyche. She also has a budding romance with Tyrone, until he allows the issue of his affliction to get in the way.

Ms. Draper also did an excellent job of scripting this movie, as it is never maudlin but, rather, a wonderful treatment of a little known illness. The jazz that Miles and Tyrone both love to play is well integrated with the issue of Tourette Syndrome.  The threads of the story are woven together seamlessly. All in all, it is an excellent drama. Look for cameo roles by Camryn Manheim and Carol Kane. Check out the unknown redhead clapping in the audience.",1000944000,15,1662,4.567114093959732
1398281,5,B000056N30,"While searching for a video today, I found The Tick Code. I knew nothing about this movie, but I knew I enjoyed Gregory Hines and was passionate about Jazz...What more could I want?  I was pleasantly surprised when there was a third element to this movie - Tourettes Syndrome.
  Miles (played by Christopher Goerge Marquette) is a 12yr old boy living in NY and the brunt of his school mates jokes, and an embarassment to his father.  Miles lives with his single mother (played by Polly Draper) and is an incredibly gifted pianist, whose choice of music is Jazz.  Miles meets jazz saxophonist Tyrone (played by Gregory Hines) and becomes enchanted with the person/musician. (who also has Tourettes)
  Tourettes as a subject is difficult to deal with at best, but this movie does a splendid job of educating the viewer about what it is like to live with this disease.
  Christopher George Marquette is superb in his role of Miles. Gregory Hines will not disappoint anyone in his performance and Polly Draper as the mother (and writer of the movie) shows us how heartbreaking it is and how strong one must be to mother a child with Tourettes.  The music is wonderful and the sound track will be a must to those who love fine jazz.",992649600,9,1227,4.638888888888889
1398282,5,B000056N30,"I origninally saw this film in the theatre.  As a mother of a child with Tourettes' Syndrome I found it to be extraordinarly realistic (probably because it is based on a real life experience) and to some degree, depressing.  My son was only diagnosed last year (with in months of the movie's release date) so it was difficult to view at that time.  Now, I see the truth, love and triumph in this film.  My son has even begun piano lessons. . . I recommdend this movie to everyone but in particular to those who touch a life of a TS child; I'm getting copies for family members and my town's library (when the video is priced for personal sale).  ENJOY, cry and most of all, rejoice and see ""The Tic Code"".",984528000,18,705,4.3106060606060606

7932185,5,B000056N30,"There are many great Black Lead Actors.  Don't forget that Gregory Hines is one of them.

In this movie.  Chris Marquette is INCREDIBLE!  He should have been an up and coming young actor after this.  This may have been his best role yet as a good with a disability...but still a savant.

Its a shame Disney used him in a movie 'Up, Up, and Away' never making himself the key figure of a movie.  he's always played a decent sidekick or less than that.  he never really hit the big leagues.

overall this story is touching.

you know how sometimes you like someone so much?  you want to be like them?  you want to be black, you want to have autism?  No Seriously, there are kids who do that.  They like someone being awesome that sometimes they wish they had the same issue...its NOT EASY...but because of Chris Marquette and Gregory Hines, you wish you could overcome adversity just like they do.

7932186,3,B000056N30,"I gave it 3 stars because there is bad language throughout this film.  It's a shame because it's a very interesting plot, but the ""F"" words get in the way of the message.",1428883200,,170,4.151515151515151

As for the movie, it was touching and respectful of those with physical challenges.  The story was sweet and tender.  A nice film to watch.",1404777600,,251,4.25531914893617
7932191,5,B000056N30,"I loved that ""real"" aspects of this film.  As someone who professionally works with children and adults who continue to struggle with tics, this film has helped me clarify for parents and significant others who best to have discussions related to managing symptoms in a more social context.  Great performances by all (especially the late Gregory Hines)...",1391817600,,356,5.228070175438597
7932192,5,B000056N30,"Some very underrated actors make the most interesting underrated movies. Polly Draper and Gregory Hines certainly fall into that category.
Their ability to imbue each of their cinematic entries with a wellspring of heartfelt drama makes even their most insignificant movies meaningful experiences.
This story of a young fatherless boy afflicted with an embarrassing verbal tic, avoids all the preachiness and boredom of many otherwise earnest movies of this genre.
The characters are flawed, real and ultimately more meaningful and lovable because of their very human reactions and even more human resolutions to a plague that has probably affected someone you remember from your childhood.
The generosity and caring that characterizes both of these actors cinematic contributions infuses this movie with unexpected pathos and understated intensity.
This is a movie you will talk about for a long time after you see it.",1387152000,,919,5.47887323943662
