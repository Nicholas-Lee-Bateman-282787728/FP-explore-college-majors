4597213,3,B0057O6IN2,"This is going to be a little difficult for me to review because I have seen the original Japanese version about a year before this version was released. I will reference the Japanese version but this review is for this one. The original Japanese version, in my honest opinion, is an amazing work of art. This one however. While still not bad, is a product that I have several problems with.

Now many of you might think that this is going to be a person ranting about how poor American dubs are. This is not that. While the American voice acting is not the greatest in the world, it gets the job done for those who insist on watching it that way. What I do have a problem with is that this is a censored edit. While the reasoning for it is understandable, the character Balot is only 15 after all; showing her naked on screen having sex is an extreme taboo here in America. But, having seen the original version, I spent the entire time distracted by all the edits that were made.

I am personally against censorship, and seeing how the movie was re-edited was a huge disappointment. This is not the product I thought it was going to be.

Don't let this stop you from buying it though, because it is an amazing heart felt story. Just know that this is a censored version. I wish I knew that before I bought it.",1321315200,93,1310,4.317073170731708
4597214,5,B0057O6IN2,"This one has great animation, voice dubbing, and sound track. If you liked ""ghost in the shell"" you like mardock scramble. Mardock sramble has an original story, I just get that feeling from it.  The story has a strong female lead, who is looking in herself for who she really is, and killing bad guys.  Balot's story is about everything that is wrong with the world, so it is ment for an adult audience.",1318204800,8,404,4.445945945945946
4597215,5,B0057O6IN2,"The previous review was right on target.  This is definitely NOT for the kids. It not only has ultra violence it looks into the gritty effects of abuse on a person. That said, it is very good,and takes you into the motivations for the lead character. Character development is one of the strong points of this show. The technology used is outstanding, highways through the air, cars driven by thought, weapons that morph into anything you want, etc.

The show is one hour long and ends in a cliff hanger, so don't expect closure with this one. As I write this, Amazon doesn't show any second episode yet.",1318204800,28,603,4.574074074074074
4597216,5,B0057O6IN2,"Fasten your seatbelt, keep all arms and legs inside the vehicle. Mardock Scramble is an action packed, emotion jolt - a veritable Sin City meets Blade Runner. In it, Balot, the victim of endless abuse and tragedy, finds herself somehow alive after having been brutally murdered. Or so she thought. Now she has the chance to bring her ""killer"" down and to do so she has been outfitted with a synthetic skin and rebuilt body that provides her with amazing powers. With the zany Dr. Easter and the ever reliable (and more human than the humans) mouse/super weapon Oeufcocque, she will face a string of foes and the horror of her own past as she tries to find a reason to keep on living.

A few warnings though. If you are sensitive to rather shocking scenes and themes, you may want to steer clear of this. Balot's passed is filled with horrendous abuse and it plays out through her flashbacks. The themes are mature and violence and sex are all over the place. And Balot spends almost half the film nude.

That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The cyberpunk/urban sci-fi setting is engrossing, the action is intense, and the story and characters are already (as this is the first installment and not the complete story - and it has one hell of a cliff-hanger!) vivid and compelling. I am excited about what comes next. Additionally - as I am one who enjoys some deeper analysis when I can find it - there is an underlying social commentary, particularly in regards to gender and power (which is made a tad ironic by the fact that Balot's clothes have a problem staying on) as well as abuse and trust. Not one to watch with the kids, but certainly a film that can be enjoyed and taken seriously (if you can catch your breath from the breakneck pace  of the action).",1315612800,104,1772,4.53125

4597219,3,B0057O6IN2,"I was wondering why the second part of this series is 60 minutes, while this one has 120 minutes on the back cover.  Then I discovered that that is because that this movie is actually only 62-65 minutes (normal vs. directors cut) long.  I guess that is fine, but when you're expecting a feature-film length, and only get an hour, it is kind-of upsestting.  A lot of this episode is just set-up for the next ones, so you're committing yourself to a lot of money in order to eventually get the entire series, which is good, but I'm not sure if it's _that_ good.",1369612800,,559,4.355769230769231

I've been reading other reviews that are knocking it because the way it ends, and i must say that does not make this a bad movie. Think of the new berserk film trilogy, the way those films leave off makes you just wanna watch the next one right? The way this one ends made me wanna throw the sequel in right away, i had to have more!!!! I've been watching anime since i was young and i have to say over the last few years a lot of anime coming out has lost the spark that it used to have. Most series now all focus on fan service, or all involve stories about nerdy teenage boys with all these big titted women hanging around him, yeah it's fun i get it, but where is the drama? This movie is not for children!!!! Just let me throw that out there, but anyone that loves a good action/cyber punk drama will love this film. I can't wait for the other two movies and i hope that they impress me the way this one did. I have a feeling they will and I hope anyone reading this will give this series a shot. I will be blunt do not go into this movie expecting a hour of straight action, like I said this series mainly focuses on Main character Rune Balot and her tortured past, but by the time the ending comes you get treated to a bad ass action sequence, a good finale to a great movie. The way it ends will have you on the edge of your seat just waiting to see the next part. Well I hope my review may help with wanting to watch this or not, oh and one more thing go with the Blu Ray purchase as the dvd is a edit. The blu ray comes with a director's cut which is the complete uncut film.",1360627200,3,1684,3.9970326409495547

This is a situation that the Japanese can do exceptionally well and I was expecting a really good story.  Unfortunately, it dissolved into a torrent of pseudomecha fantasy combat and that was the end of the story.

Mardock Scramble does have a great deal of sex and nudity, but I didn't find that objectionable because much of it fit what should have been the core of the story.  It's a hard story about a girl who at the beginning of the story sees herself as a hard and messed up person.

Mardock Scramble didn't appeal to me, but it might appeal to others.  It would be a good idea to watch an episode online beforre deciding whether or not to buy it.",1358035200,5,852,4.416666666666667

4597224,3,B0057O6IN2,"Other reviewers have mentioned the 'grain' was added for theatricality, but it is just annoying. Especially when the Blu-Ray costs more. So just stick to the DVD version instead and save some money.

And in other news, I read that some folks compare this to Blade Runner or Ghost in the Shell and that is really not accurate. I could see it being closer to Ghost in the Shell than Blade Runner. But I am a huge fan of both films and this falls short of those on nearly every account. Plus I watch a ton of sci-fi and dystopian anime, even series not widely available in the states, and this is merely passable compared to much.

The series seems to start off good enough, but then it fizzles out and doesn't really seem to recapture any steam. The characters seem to all be very flat archetypes without any real development, or any real draw for the viewer. Plus the 14 year old looking heroine is naked a lot. Not so much of a problem in Ghost in the Shell with the obviously adult Motoko, but in this I felt uncomfortable, like a peeping pedophile.

There are a lot of adult themes but often it seems they are included just to 'grow up' the series. It's not worth watching if you are into deep and complex stories. I would say to check out the film and series for Ghost in the Shell if you haven't. Also Darker than Black is a good series with a dark spin. And there is always Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head. Even No. 6 was better and I wasn't too keen on that series either (it was too short and the plot didn't have enough time to develop).

There are better series out there, so just be aware before you buy this. Perhaps checking it out first on Netflix would be preferable. I was able to get the Blu-Ray from my local library so luckily I didn't plop $30 on this. And please don't hate me for this review, I would probably give it 3 stars except that the Blu-Ray version is pretty pointless with the grainy resolution (which I'm not sure was intentional - even the black background on the opening credits is horribly grainy).

And also of note: this was based on a novel (which is available at my library) so I am thinking the novel might be much better than the anime. I'll keep everyone posted.",1353369600,,2199,4.327669902912621

4597226,4,B0057O6IN2,"Rune Balot, a 15-years old prostitute is nearly killed by a serial killer. She is saved by having herself turned into a cyborg. She is given the task of bringing him to justice. The murder has his memory wiped and sends an army of mutants to silence her.

This movie is the first of three, and it's very impressive. This movie is one of the most well animated films I've ever seen. Some of the shots of the city honestly look real. The star voice actress is Hilary Haag, and she is very good. Her voice is muffled part of the time b/c the characters vocal cords were destroyed in her accident. This movie isn't for kids there is a lot of graphic nudity and violence. Even so it isn't a lowbrow at all. This anime really delivers. I really enjoyed it, and I hope you do too.",1350345600,3,773,4.222972972972973
4597227,3,B0057O6IN2,"I want to get this out of the way at the beginning: Mardock Scramble is very good. The animation is stunning, the story is complex and mature, and I was intrigued from beginning to end. The problem isn't so much with what's there as it is what isn't there.
As other reviewers have noted the film stops suddenly in the middle of the climax. The ending is incredibly sudden and unfulfilling.

The film is very short (approximately 60 minutes) but the running time listed is 125 minutes. It appears that they combined the running time of the director's cut and the theatrical cut to get this number. I am unfamiliar with the rest of the story (I haven't read the manga and the second and third films have yet to be released) but I am sure that releasing this as two films instead of three would have made for a less jarring experience.

The movie as it currently exists is good, and I'm glad I've seen it, but I cannot recommend purchasing it unless the price comes down or it's sequel becomes available. As it is now it's like watching a movie in a theater only to have the film break halfway through. No matter how much you may have been enjoying the film up until that point the experience isn't going to be a positive one.",1346803200,,1223,4.383259911894273
4597228,5,B0057O6IN2,"Just got done watching it and im very impressed with how good it was. This is defenately a anime for a mature audience. I hope they bring the second one to us soon. Great animation, the story had me completely sucked in, and voice acting was very good to. This one is a rare gem and im extremely happy with it. If i had one complaint about it it would be that you get so drawn into the show that it feels short, and with a run time of just 60 minutes it is fairly short. If you like the cyberpunk type genre this is a great buy. I wish their were more anime like this one. I could go on and on about all the good things but just get it yourself and give it a try. Its worth the money.",1344470400,3,684,3.823943661971831

Hopefully, nobody screwed anything up and I can continue to purchase the entire series here in the US, dubbed by my favorite peeps, region 1, and have it done before the year ends. I will wait patiently as long as I can, then it's time to sport the old wooden leg, eye patch, and talking parrot!

4597230,5,B0057O6IN2,"Thoroughly enjoyed this slice of futuristic anime.  Be warned, it deals with some harsh subject matter, (child abuse, rape), but is in no way gratuitous instead solidifys the story.  Quite simply a must see and I cant wait for the second combustion to be released.",1339459200,2,264,4.844444444444444
4597231,5,B0057O6IN2,"I had not heard or read anything before watching Mardock Scramble. I found it in my brother's Blu-ray collection, and decided to watch it today. I won't go into the story, as earlier reviews tell you enough about it. There is a lot of mature subject matter in it. It isn't exactly action packed, until the end, but that in no way takes away from this anime. You really get drawn into the plight of the main character Balot. The story is very engrossing and I couldn't take my eyes off it. I had not watched an anime in months, not since The Girl Who Leapt Through Time. Mardock Scramble definitely has me wanting to try and discover more gems like this one. I can't wait for the next one. Highly Recommended.",1338076800,3,708,4.371212121212121
4597232,5,B0057O6IN2,"I bought this movie on reviews, as isn't usually my custom for anime. I tend to stretch my dollar how I can, getting more ""time"" for more ""money"" and while I'm use to getting whole series for a hair over what this one cost I felt I got more than some of the series I own.
I also felt like this was kinda like a link back to when only the more hyperviolent and absurd anime came to the states and when you think hyperviolent, dark, and all rapey you pretty much think one title that seems like it'd be close to this one, or vice versa. Yes, you know the one. But I liked this one more. A lot more. I honestly had a moment in the climax when I was sitting there and I heard something I hadn't heard in a while, my heart XD. I was actually caught up in the conflict.
The ending did leave me wanting more, but in a good way. Like a roller coaster you're stepping off of but already wondering how long it'll take you to get back in line and board again.",1336262400,3,948,3.968586387434555
4597233,5,B0057O6IN2,"I thoroughly enjoy science fiction and anime. Combining these two favorites of mine is a win/win, and Mardock Scramble: The First Compression, does a hell of a job getting your ready for the following installments of the this Trilogy(I think, might just be 2).
It's all done in a very gritty, violent, and completely realistic sense and it's pretty deep considering it's ""animated"" as some of my buddies would refer to it. I think it's a great story with good animation, voice acting, and creativity.
Pick this one up. Now. It belongs in your collection. The 2nd Installment will prove be just as good if not better, judging from where we leave our little heroine at the end of The First Compression.",1336003200,,700,4.745901639344262

Maybe 60 minutes was just too short of a time.  Seems like they tried to cram too much story in that short time frame.  I will say though, a lot of the animation looked beautiful.  I prefer a more drawn out story, not quite so fast-paced, and with more plot/character development.

4597236,5,B0057O6IN2,"I think enough is said about the story, where I won't retread on that ground. I myself avoided all spoilers, so didn't know anything about it before watching, and think this is one of those shows that is best enjoyed that way.

I watched the directors cut with no point of reference of what the original ""uncencored"" version is and how that compares. But this version had some pretty explicit scenes (stopping just short of showing actual penetration scenes). And because our protagonist is a teenage prostitute, this is obviously controversial material in the USA, even being animated. However, in my opionion it never feels like it is done just to arouse the audience, but instead feels more of an emphasis of the gritty, dark, and sad world our young protagonist was trapped in.

The show has a great techno futuristic angle on the story telling. It doesn't hold back on sex & violence, but all of that seems to fit within the theme & not feel forced in just for shock value.

I did not know this was part of a trilogy when I starting watching it, although the ""First Compression"" in the title implies there is more. When this movie ended on a cliffhanger, I was totally sucked in to it, & can't wait for the next movie to make it's way to America.",1333670400,,1251,4.5265486725663715

Moving on, this one's certainly not for the kiddies as it has nudity, bad language and ultraviolence. Even still, I'm surprised that it was such a quality production!  The story, character designs, and animation all are done eloquently and the soundtrack rocks!
I understand that the theatrical version has the sex scenes edited out so that may be the way to go for some of you. But this unadulterated cut is what the anime industry needs after seeing so much 'cookie-cutter', formulaic anime titles. 5 stars all the way, can't wait for the next part of this sad but thrilling title!",1332115200,2,733,4.682170542635659

That said, I often look to the running time of anime to see if it is feature length.  The time cited here on amazon (that amazon refused to alter despite the proof I presented), as well as the time cited on the box of 125 minutes is no accurate.  There are two edits of the same movie.  The director's cut clocking in at 1 hour 9 minutes (69 minutes).  The theatrical cut clocks in at 1 hour 5 minutes (65 minutes).  NOT the 125 advertised.  It feels disingenuous of them to add those two running times together and somehow arrive at 125 minutes (poor math skills, I suppose).  So, you know, be aware.  This is not a full length movie.  Only about an hour.  It's a GREAT hour, don't get me wrong.",1331856000,13,879,4.1117647058823525
4597248,5,B0057O6IN2,"I'm not going 2 get too much into what the storyline is about as you can read those elsewhere. Mardock Scramble is basically about a 15 year old, I guess now former prostitute. The story starts off with Balot being with a client only to get killed by the same client. Afterwards she's physically brought back to life only for the viewers to see how psychologically damaged she really is. This is what makes Mardock Scramble good to me as of all the complex moral dilemmas presented in this film.

Mardock Scramble has gorgeous animations most of the time that just make you want to pause just to look at the sceneries. However there are some scenes that just feels out of place most of those are in the way the CGI cars are drawn. They just feel out of place because of how it's just there. This is probably my only gripe though. Everything else was excellent and I didn't even mind watching it in English and I normally prefer most of my animes in Japanese with English subs.

Now if you don't mind basically a bare bone blu ray then go ahead and buy it as you won't be disappointed. This just comes with the theatrical and uncut versions of the film, Japanese trailers and previews.

This DVD contains the original theatrical cut of the movie that played in theaters.  The additional scenes with added nudity and sex were bonus features for the home video release in Japan.  It was known WELL AHEAD of time that was the theatrical cut on various anime sites, but Amazon failed to list enough info to let people make an informed decision.  This release is no different than buying the original cut of Star Wars, before all the added scenes George Lucas threw in later.

It should be noted that the affected scenes do not actually affect the plot anyway and are basically just added nudity, sex, and fanservice.  They may also make some viewers uncomfortable as the main character can appear to be underaged to some.  If you feel this may bother you, then this version may be your best bet.

8460932,1,B0057O6IN2,This anime offended me. The story turned out to be a crime drama instead of a thriller. The plot makes no sense at all. I want that 30 minutes of my life back.,1417305600,,159,3.8484848484848486
