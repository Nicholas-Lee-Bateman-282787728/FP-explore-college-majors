8016900,5,B0001WAHCS,"The main attraction here is a live piano recital by Zoltan Kocsis recorded for Swiss television at the Teatro Sociale of Bellinzona, Switzerland, in 1998, 85 minutes. The DVD includes a substantial bonus of audio-only performances of Mozart's two concertos for two pianos by Carmen Piazzini and Alfredo Perl, with Mikhail Gantvarg conducting the Soloists of St. Petersburg, 47 minutes.

Kocsis is best known for his award-winning Bartok and Debussy. His playing has a concentration and attention to each note and phrase that holds my attention but isn't fussy or overdone. He begins with the Mozart Fantasy in c, K. 475, which he plays in a serious, angular way, with moderate lyricism, that makes it sound a lot like Beethoven. The Beethoven Sonata 32 follows, in much the same manner, with the passion in the opening movement expressed mainly in the form of fiery but modulated power. He gives the unique third variation of the arietta enough swing to sound like a Joplin rag. The finale carries over the majestic power of the first movement more than it sings. The Schubert breathes more; the lyricism remains moderate.

The video is in a full-screen 4:3 aspect ratio, a little soft with good color. Camera angles vary, showing predominately the hands and/or the face, with the occasional longer shot. The camera movement and editing are clean and not distracting. The setting is beautiful, a small nineteenth-century neoclassical hall with a mirror-polished Steinway. The sound is clear and natural, with the close miking matching the video perspective. The audience is well behaved.

The audio-only Mozart concertos are completely unrelated to the Kocsis recital and have quite a different mood and sound, warmer and reverberantly atmospheric. The pianists aren't very well known here, but their work has been well received critically, hers mostly for a Mozart cycle, his for a Beethoven cycle. They do justice to the music with a nimble touch and suitable flair. The orchestra plays in a middle-of-the-road fashion, their sound is a little recessed and indistinct in comparison to the pianos, as is typical in concerto recordings. These two recordings have also been released on DVD audio as part of a complete set of Mozart piano sonatas and concertos, and as a pair on CD.

How the DVD works (or doesn't)

The DVD menus are incomplete, so to access some of the works you have to either listen through from an earlier piece or use the skip forward button. There is a chapter or more for each piece, so the latter method is easy and quick.

The program for the Kocsis recital is:

Ch. 1: Mozart Fantasy 4 in c, K. 475

Ch. 2-4: Beethoven Sonata 32 in c, op. 111
----- ch. 2: introductory applause
----- ch. 3: Maestoso - Allegro con brio ed appassionato
----- ch. 4: Arietta: Adagio molto, semplice e cantabile

Ch. 5-9: Schubert Sonata in B-flat, D. 960
----- ch. 5: introductory applause
----- ch. 6: Molto moderato
----- ch. 7: Andante sostenuto
----- ch. 8: Scherzo: Allegro vivace con delicatezza - Trio
----- ch. 9: Allegro ma non troppo - Presto

The ""Play select"" portion of the menu only includes the Mozart and Beethoven. To easily reach the Schubert, just start playing from the ""Play all"" or ""Play select"" menu and skip ahead to chapter 5 (or 6 if you want to skip the applause).

The Mozart concertos are found from the ""Program extras"" menu. The menu only includes the first concerto, so to reach the second, just start playing the first one and skip ahead to chapter 4.

Mozart concertos program:

Ch. 1-3: Concerto 7 for Two Pianos in F, K. 242
Ch. 4-6: Concerto 10 for Two Pianos in E-flat, K. 365
