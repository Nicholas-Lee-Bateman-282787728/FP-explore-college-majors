8564885,5,B00BAGONTW,"I'm definitely a ""Firm Believer"" having done Firm workouts since the late 1980's.  There are simply no better workouts out there, in my opinion.  This one is among my very favorites, and I own about 15 Firm DVD's.  This is a fun 45 minutes, and trust me when I tell you, they pack a lot of sweat and moves into 45 minutes.  The only thing I'd ask for is more abs;  there is a quick abs section in the beginning, and I do love getting the abs over with quickly so we can get to the heart-pumping jumping around.  This is both high and low impact, but of course you can pump it up and do all the moves on high or take it down and keep it all on the ground.  I find it very fast moving and I never get all frustrated with ""When will this be over?"" even when I'm really tired after work.  This workout puts me in a great mood.  The routines are easy to follow but I don't find them boring.  Give this one a try!",1518825600,,907,3.934065934065934

8564887,5,B00BAGONTW,"I have been doing the older Firm Dvds for a few years and had great results with them (dropped about 2 sizes n didn't really alter my diet).  I got this one recently and really like it.  It is a compilation but it is not as tough as Super Cardio.  It also has quite a bit of 4 limb movement so that it is really not straight cardio with insane running/jumping.  It uses the high step for cardio as well as the lower step.  It also has some squats at the end.  I tend to like workouts that alternate cardio w weights and this is more similar to that than just straight cardio or straight sculpting.  If you like the old Firm DVDS, you will like this.",1407456000,6,649,4.062992125984252
8564888,4,B00BAGONTW,"When I was in highschool 7 years ago I absolutely fell in love with The Firm after losing 20 pounds with Body Sculpting System 1 and Weight Watchers. I didn't stick with it because I got into a horrible car accident and became addicted to my pain medication. I eventually dealt with those demons and Now years later, I'm trying to get some weight off again...and I have tried everything! After much discouragement and disappointment I decided to go back to what I know works- THE FIRM and healthy eating! I was going to order BSS 1 again (with the fanny lifter), but after reading several reviews it sounded like the older Firm videos were better (i.e. Anna Benson's workouts prior to 2000) I started with Vol 2 with Janet Jones Gretzky and added other original firm workouts to compliment my routine. After doing these 3x/week for 2 months I lost 7 pounds. Then I decided I could really up my cardio and lose fat faster- whoa!! I bought Core Cardio 1 and Core Cardio 2 for a whopping $40 each (heck-the originals cost more than that back in the late 80's). I thought I was an intermediate exercisor but I realized quite quickly that I may be able to handle heavy weights with good form and cardio...but this kind of cardio is a whole other animal!
 You need a 12-14inch box, a 4-6 inch box, a dowel (I don't use one), a 2 x4, light to medium weights and a 2lb ball..I use my bf's basketball. From the word go you are doing plyometric jumps, jacks, running with your knees in the air and high impact step aerobics. There are no breaks and you will need to wear light breathable clothing...prepare to sweat. These two tapes are mix compliations from Maximum Cardio, Cardio Burn and Power Cardio. While I believe those workouts are intense by themselves, all of the strictly high impact moves were plucked from those tapes to create CC1 and CC2. The instructors are: Carissa Foster from Max Cardio. She is very charming and cute,without being annoying. Dale Brabham from Power Cardio is extremely fit and muscular almost in a manly way...very no nonsense. Then there is Tamela Hastie. I think people will either love her or hate her. She is extremely bubbly and acts like a cheerleader. Normally I care more about the workout itself and pay little attention to the instructor, but I found Tamela to be completely obnoxious most of the time. The workout cast is also a little different from other Firms considering these people look more average. There is one man in the background who looks like he could be in his late 50's or early 60's..it's hard to tell when your jumping so much. I don't know how he keeps up, but I keep telling myself that if he can do it, then so can I!
All in all, these workouts are good and they will give you visible results if you are consistent! I don't lose weight easily at all and the Firm is the one thing that seems to work. I used to think the newer Firms were so great until I tried the originals...The ballroom/mansion set maybe silly, the outfits dated, the music cheesy...but they work like nothing else. The newer Firms cannot hold a candle to these. I will never understand why The Benson Sisters sold their rights to The Firm.",1198627200,13,3167,4.517421602787456
