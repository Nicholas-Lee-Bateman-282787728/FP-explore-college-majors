2277746,4,B0009CTV4U,"While perhaps every fan can honestly appreciate that the show was at its visual peak before the firing of creator and Spumco founder John Kricfalusi, some are consequently too quick to disregard the show's subsequent seasons. This set, featuring the entire third season and the first half of season four, pretty much all created in the hands of Games animation, may surprise some naysayers who stopped watching the show on principle - chiefly because an awful lot of these shows are very good! Personally, this set represents to me something of a golden age as it's these episodes that I remember clearest of all from my childhood days of being mesmerised by the show. Nostalgia aside, though, I surely can't be alone in my opinion that, despite the seriously noticeable absence of Mr. K - some of the show's strongest moments are present on these DVDs.

The first major difference is the complete lack of Kricfalusi's voice work. While certain episodes toward the end of season two featured Billy West take over Ren as well as his regular job of voicing Stimpy, from season three on he is permanently the voice of both characters. The late season two episodes (as well as some of the early season three shows on this set) see him take on this task by initially providing a raspy, yet perfectly laudible, imitation of Kricfalusi's Peter Lorre/Kirk Douglas hybrid that made Ren's voice so distinctive.  A few episodes in, however, and West begins to evolve the voice, adapting it to his own take on the character. While to some diehard fans this could be considered almost sacriligious, I do have to enthuse that it works very well, especially when considering the new tone the Games shows begin to take. It also seems that, aside from Mr. & Mrs. Pipe, the Salesman, Muddy Mudskipper and a few brief visual 'cameos', certain Spumco-era staples are noticeably absent - Log, the greatest product in the world for example, and the scarcely seen Mr. Horse in particular (although he would start appearing again in episodes subsequent to this set, voiced by Billy West) as well as George Liquor. In place of these old favourites some new faces are introduced, to variable reception. Haggis McHaggis (voiced by token Scotsman Alan Young) a diminutive, jaded Scottish celebrity; Wilbur Cobb (Jack Carter), a demented Hollywood bigshot with an already decaying body, and a personal favourite character of mine; as well as an onslaught of single-episode extras that range from a prodigious unicycle-riding child doctor to a pair of happy-go-lucky parasites that set up home in Ren and Stimpy's brains.

While the first half of season three maintains a distinctive appearance - albeit one lesser to the Spumco-produced shows - the main element that starts to creep in as the season progresses and season four begins is that each episode seems to end up having its own unique look and feel. 'It's A Dog's Life' and 'Eggyolkio', the closing episodes of this set, adopt a bizarre thin/thick old-timey line drawing style, while 'Blazing Entrails' and 'Prehistoric Stimpy' veer from elaborately thought-out close-up shots and background art to character animation that is barely more than a scrawl (still mightily entertaining though). 'Hermit Ren' - in which Ren and Stimpy part ways only to find that they need each other to stay sane - is engulfed by a claustrophobic, uncomfortable atmosphere, while maintaining the use of simplified animation styles and character designs that are almost out of an episode of 'Powerpuff Girls'. This feel (possibly owed to Spumco alumnus and link between the two shows, Chris Reccardi), is also present in the similarily creepy, Reccardi-directed 'Hard Times For Haggis', in which Scottish superstar Haggis McHaggis is forced to end his showbusiness career so that Ren & Stimpy can take his place. Both 'Hermit...' and 'Hard Times...' - as well as previous Kricfalusi-era shows such as 'Stimpy's Fan Club' and 'Sven Hoek' (available on the seasons 1 & 2 set) - present a display of psychosis setting in, and one just that little bit too near the knuckle for what was largely regarded as a children's show. That, however, was and is one of many aspects that always set this cartoon apart from most others - it was always able to consistently touch upon nerves and entice the viewer into daring themselves to watch more.

I'm also a touch surprised at just how much went over my head when I originally saw these shows a decade or so ago. In 'It's A Dog's Life' there are even some almost risque gags that went unacknowledged - one scene in which the duo's new adoptive owner walks in on Ren administering the Hiemlich manouveur to a choking Stimpy, sees her assume they are getting 'frisky', spray them with a hose and take them out to be neutered. This almost puts some of the out-and-out 'sex' scenes of Kricfalusi's later 'Adult Party Cartoon' in perspective. On that note, fans who enjoyed a certain undercurrent to the relationships of the characters may be disappointed that their...well...'chemistry' is pretty much gone. In these seasons they are pretty much buddies at best - and for the most part Ren is just vehemently annoyed with Stimpy. While this means just about nothing in regard to the strength of the characters and the storylines, it's something of a shame to miss the previous tenderness the two would occasionally show one another in seasons one and two (Ren buttoning up Stimpy before bed, gesturing to mistletoe and so forth).

Other standout episodes include 'Jerry The Bellybutton Elf', which features the ever-hoarse Gilbert Gottfried as a guest voice and also boasts cameo appearances from virtually every peripheral character in the Ren & Stimpy universe; 'Farm Hands', in which the affable hicks Abner & Ewalt (previously Sherriffs from season two's 'Out West') take Ren & Stimpy in to lumber them with chores and arduous farm labour; 'A Yard Too Far', which harkens back to period animation in its depiction of the starving duo's attempts to outwit the baboon that guards their potential feast of hog jowls; 'Ren's Retirement', where said chihuahua enters his autumn years and must prepare for his own funeral; In 'Bass Masters' Ren and Stimpy's fishing show is hijacked by escaped convict Wilbur Cobb, as well as Stimpy's superior fish-catching ability; and 'Stimpy's Cartoon Show', wherein the full horrors and stresses of producing an animated feature are endured by the long-suffering feline with a vicious, Kricfalusian Ren as his producer.

Some episodes, however, are not as consistently entertaining. While Gary Owens does an excellent job returning as the legendary breakfast superhero in 'Powdered Toast Man Vs. Waffle Woman', the weak story, dialogue and visuals (the original PTM episode from season two was one of the best looking of the prior Spumco shows) let it down. For opposite reasons, the strong premise of 'Eat My Cookies' (Ren & Stimpy infiltrate the girl scouts) is rendered somewhat unappealing by the interminable presence of guest voice Rosie O' Donnell. For the most part though, this is a set of thoroughly enticing and wonderfully amusing episodes from just before the show began to seriously go downhill with the ill-conceived fifth season.

The DVD itself has little by way of special features, aside from some commentary tracks - but really, what else do you need? The commentaries themselves feature Kricfalusi and his old team, who at times gracefully praise what they are watching, but for the most part bitterly (and amusingly to a degree) spew vitriol toward the show's decline in quality once it had been taken off their hands. Perhaps the most unusual feature is the commentary track by Ren & Stimpy in character, voiced by John K. and Eric Bauza, on a set where Billy West plays both.

It is worth noting that this time around the DVD packaging carefully omits the 'Uncut' claim that the season one and two set featured, much to the chagrin of long-time fans who were quick to pick up on its inaccuracy (just read some of the ludicrously furious Amazon reviews for that set). Despite what other reviewers have claimed, there are plenty of cuts made to these episodes - most of them quite small, however shows such as 'Jiminy Lummox' and 'Road Apples' are presented with whole segments omitted. Also one of the favoured shorts - 'Chicken In A Drawer' - is missing (although the credits acknowledge it), while we get to see two versions of 'Dog Water' (one colour, one monochrome, otherwise identical). If, like me, you grew up on the butchered BBC broadcasts however, you'll find a lot more unseen material here than what's missing. The only other real drawbacks would be the slightly drab picture quality for 'Ren's Retirement', and the oddly muffled sound for 'Magical Singing Golden Cheeses' - but at this point I'm just nitpicking, as both are perfectly watchable and listenable respectively. For most every other episode the picture and sound quality are excellent, and a real treat for those of us who have been depending on old VHS copies taped off the television for all these years.

So for those of you who remember this period of Ren & Stimpy and wish to revisit it, this is undoubtedly one of the most nostalgia-packed DVD sets you'll get your hands on in a long while. All the Spumco devotees who never saw these episodes may even want to check them out as well - you never know what you might stumble across that'll amuse. Even if it's just Eddie Fitzgerald's constant laugh-track.",1120262400,9,9486,4.934877896055103
2277747,5,B0009CTV4U,"Ren and Stimpy are back! and being a huge fan of the series i couldn't be happier.  Once again, the artwork and detail going into the box set alone makes for a fun collection to own.  There are three discs this time around (same as before), and approximately 373 minutes of Hilarity.  Thats a hefty sum of Slapping, Yelling, getting Angry, and Classical Music (like my favorite, dance of the sugar plum fairy).

Maybe it's just a fact that these episodes are of a later season than the First DVD set, but the quality (both picture and sound) seem to far out-do the other.  ALSO, Paramount partnershipped with MTV Networks for this DVD set and in doing so would explain WHY there ARE NO CUTS this time around because MTV would have the full episodes whereas Nickelodeon preferred NOT to air certain segments of episodes due to their younger audience.

Furthermore, The producers of this DVD and the creator John K. were careful NOT to put the words ""UNCUT"" on this DVD set only because of all the negative criticism that was received from fans acknoladging there were missing parts in the first DVD boxed set.  However, i can say that i have watched the complete first and second discs and nothing appears missing.  So technically, it can be called ""Uncut"" but it isn't (some psycho-fan may notice a missing scene, MAYBE, but i doubt it, its all here).

Truth be told, this is a VERY worthwhile DVD set and a great Addition to add for anyone who was a fan of the show, or is brand new to Ren and Stimpy.  The pacing may seem a little slow for new people, especially if they are fans of Family Guy and Futurama where the jokes are more modern and fresh, but Ren and Stimpy have their own humor, one that is unique and genuine.  It's very nostalgic to be able to watch the cartoons i so amired as a kid, especially when i have the control to watch them on my time.

2277749,5,B0009CTV4U,"Don't let anyone tell you season three of this series marked a decline in the material. I've recently gone through the episodes in season three, and quite frankly, they're just as good, at times even better, in a wonderfully bizarre way, as episodes in season one and two. I realize that the Nick people began to take over, but I don't care about the politics of any of this. The proof is in the pudding, and the season three episodes added a whole new level of bizarre to what was already a great cartoon!",1118707200,11,506,4.3936170212765955
2277750,4,B0009CTV4U,"You probably know very well what happened after the second season of Ren and Stimpy: Nick lures away a few Spumco workers, opens up a company called Games Animation, and Ren and Stimpy started dwindling in terms of quality and consistency with the fifth and final season having the worst episodes ever.

However, in the earlier stages, most of these Games episodes were originally written/storyboarded at Spumco and are the true hits, so this set isn't a total waste. Some of these include A YARD TOO FAR, REN'S PECS, STIMPY'S CARTOON SHOW, BASS MASTERS, LAIR OF THE LUMMOX and a few others as well. In addition you'll also get JIMINY LUMMOX, AN ABE DIVIDED, FARM HANDS, REN'S RETIREMENT, HOUSE OF NEXT TUESDAY, and maybe IT'S A DOG'S LIFE and EGG YOLKEO, which although not Spumco episodes (or maybe some of them are), they're still somewhat funny and bearable to watch.

We're not all sure what kind of extras will there be, but if there's a lot in this set, that'll definitely make this set worth buying. So far all I know this there will be commentaries from the original Spumco crew and a few of the Games artists.

2277814,5,B0009CTV4U,"Believe what you may about the quality of seasons 3 to 5 of Ren and Stimpy. As with SpongeBob, Rugrats, and Digimon, I'm a special breed of fan who likes every season of these Nicktoons (But I'm still boycotting Ren and Stimpy's adults-only spin-off, especially because it's not in the original Nicktoon series, AND mostly for its unspeakably-atrocious brand of humor). Spumco was booted from Nick after the events of the banned episode Man's Best Friend, and let Games Animation (later called the Nickelodeon Animation Studio) take their place in finishing the original series. Even under new management, Ren and Stimpy continues to be a huge hit, even today, with seasons 3 to 5, or 3 to 4A with this set. Seasons 4B to 5 came later. Billy West took over for Ren full-time starting here, after John Kricfalusi got his butt kicked from Nick. You'll also hear the renowned voices of other toon legends like Gary Owens (Space Ghost & the Blue Falcon), Alan Young (Scrooge McDuck), Melissa Fahn (Rika Nonaka, Kristy Damon, and Nene Amano on Digimon), Cheryl Chase (Angelica Pickles on Rugrats, All Grown Up, & Preschool Daze), Billy West of course, and more. Aside from commercials on disc 1, the only bonus features in this set are 11 audio commentaries by the Spumco team, and 1 by Ren and Stimpy themselves. All 3 sets have disclaimers of these being only for grownups; only the bonus features are meant for such eyes and ears, even with Ren's foul mouth on the Circus Midgets episode. The only dirty words in this show are cr(ud), swearing to God via ""OMG"", or one that rhymes with ""hypes"". But the characters DO sometimes consult God or Jesus to help them out with tough situations, like Stimpy did for his own cartoon, or Ren for wanting Egg Yolkeo to be a real boy. The humor is still very wacky or whacko with seasons 3 to 5 of Ren and Stimpy, don't ask me why a lot of folks put them down. I can understand why the adults-only spin-off only had 6 original half-hour shows. Unlike seasons 1 and 2 being Spike TV prints without Nick logos, seasons 3 to 5 are usually-edited Nick prints WITH Nick logos. If you like every season of Ren and Stimpy, make sure the seasons 1 & 2 set doesn't get lonely; add seasons 3 to 5 to it if you want to! ""Oh, joy!""",1437955200,,2255,4.529411764705882

2277840,5,B0009CTV4U,"Oakay, so as most of us should know, Games Animation took over Ren and Stimpy after the creatror, John Kricfalusi, was fired by Nickelodeon and some of the episodes and show went slightly, downhill. And unfourtunatley, this is true, sort of. Season 3 has quite a number of episodes that were storyboarded by Spumco and finished at Games, and those episodes are AWESOME. In fact, there are even games episodes that are just as amazing as any Spumco episode. Also, it is highly suggested that you read this article to learn more about Ren and Stimpy, and what happened with Spumco and games http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ren_%26_Stimpy_Show#Development_and_history  So, there are many amazing episodes, and although many don't quite compare to some Spumco episodes (in particularily, Space Maddness, Stimpy's invention, and my favorite, Sven Hoek) there are many that are utterly amazing and are enough to make this DVD box set completely worth it. The epiodes I like on disc one include, To Salve, or to Salve Not, A Yard too far, No pants Today, Ren's Pec's, An Abe Divided, Jimminy Lummox, Bass Masters, Stimpy's Cartoon Show, and my favorite episode on this disc, Circus Midgets.  This is all basically the complete first disc alone!  As for the second disc, it includes great episodes such as, Ren's Retirement, Road Apples, Eat my Cookies, Ren's Bitter Half, Hard Times for Haggis (which includes footage from the episodes, Space Maddness, and Stimpy's Invention, both of which are Season One episodes, And an awesome character named Haggis Mchaggis who is voiced by Allan Young, who also voiced Scrooge the Duck from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckTales) and my favorite games episode of all time, Jerry the Bellybutton Elf. As many great episodes as there are on this disc, it does include two not so great episodes, Lair of the Lummox (its not that bad, just REALLY gross, like a bit over the edge wih sticking their hands into their backsides and such) and Hermit Ren (I actually like this episode, except it shows Ren stepping in bat poop, him laying in it and  grabbing it and molding it into the shape of Stimpy, and is actually a little disturbing).  Now the final disc includes great episodes such as House of Next Tuesday, Prehistoric Stimpy, Magical Golden Singing Cheeses, It's a Dog's Life, I Love Chicken, Powdered Toastman vs Waffle Woman, and A Hard Day's Luck. The only episodes on this disc I wasn't thrilled with were, A Friend in your Face( it just wasn't very funny), Blazing Entrails (which again wasn't very funny) Lumberjerks (which definitley wasn't very funny) Farm Hands (which was actually a good episode, except for the scene where Ren and Stimpy were cleaning poop up which was only a minute long) and Egg Yolkeo which just wasn't very funny. So the only episodes that I didn't like as much were Lair of the Lummox, Hermit Ren, and Farm Hands, which were only due to extreme grossness, and A Friend in Your Face, Lumberjerks, and Egg Yolkeo, which these episodes I didn't like because they simply weren't funny. So out of 31 episodes there are 6 episodes I disliked, and this boxset is still worth it. The commentaries are good, except when the creators are bragging about 'changing the industry' and 'creating this' and all this stuff, but the ren and stimpy on ren and stimpy is worth the entire box set completley.

This is nothing like the orignal episodes. Scenes cropped then cut and left laying on some editors floor somewhere.

Once more its closed captioned (I'm deaf) nobody close captions DVD anymore due to the popularity of SUBTITLES. Subtitles are easier and cheaper to produce on a CD rather than CC encoding. So lame. But then again seeing as the product is made in mexico this doesn't surprize me. 99% of all the DVD I see come out of mexico are of such sub standard quality that you'd think they made DVD's out of old garbage can lids down there.

2277911,3,B0009CTV4U,"Ren and Stimpy is quite possibly THE saddest cartoon show in animation history. Ren and Stimpy has been bulldozed over by children's network, Nickelodeon, with horrific censors. The first two seasons are quite possibly the greatest cartoons of all time. When John K, the creator, left after the second season, things were never the same. Ren and Stimpy went from an enjoyable, very laugh-worthy crowning achievement in television, to a torpid, raving mess, from the finest animation of that time, to a forgettable, monotonous excuse.

It seems that the third season was the last season to ever stay strong, and this set features Season Three. And most of Season Three is watchable.

After going through multiple VHS tapes, DVD releases from Timelife and the last 'Seasons One and Two' set, with long and exhausting promises of being 'Uncut', guess what? After an entire air on Spike TV, a newly released set, and a previously released 'One-and-a-Half Seasons' from Timelife, guess what?

Ren and Stimpy STILL isn't uncut.

In fact, the problems are even more so worse in this set. Examples:

Road Apples:

Mr. and Mrs. Pipe telling about the Psychotic Killer story (1 min 42 sec)
A shot of Ren getting eating by the vulture (9 sec)

Lair of the Lummox:

The 'Colonel Backwash's Chicken in a Drawer' bumper (over 3-4 min)

Jimminy Lummox:

Ren pulling a prank on Stimpy: blowing up his butt with an atom bomb (about 14 sec)
Ren dumping crabs in Stimpy's bath (25 sec)

Ren's Retirement:

""Hear that, Ren? We still got 17 more holes to go!"" (5 sec)

Hermit Ren:

Ren running down the hall, screaming at Stimpy into his bedroom (6 sec)

I Love Chicken:

Stimpy serving Ren giblets (18 sec)

A Hard Day's Luck:

The Entire Bus Change sequence (1 min 4 sec)

---

And that's just to name a few. There's a hell of a lot more. And even the 'Uncut' episodes have suffered major problems, when random commercial fades come about, and a lot of dot crawl is present. Not to mention bad digital remastering, and that sometimes takes little bits (usually 1 sec) of animation with it.

And yet, some of these moments that ARE cut make the cartoons even less tolerable, considering that some of these moments are better than the cartoon itself. It seems that Nickelodeon had not fully prepared uncut protection masters, is this correct? And, believe it or not, the Season 5 set is also cut.

So an exhaustively cut set, making some average episodes seem more stupid due to the censors, and rushed production values, make something arguably not worth your time.

For the good episodes on here, not to mention the rather informative commentaries, it's MAYBE worth a rental from Netflix. And, if it's a breather: this set doesn't truly get bad until the third disk. It's just that the ignorance of the whole set, both visually, tonally, and production-wise, may not exactly seem worth your money. A normal Spongebob episode today seems a hell of a lot better than what this can offer. Ren and Stimpy has been forgotten, and it shows.",1298592000,3,3015,4.755769230769231

2277913,4,B0009CTV4U,"This was the first Ren and Stimpy box set I ever got. I saw episode I've never seen before. As said in my Season 1 and 2 review, Ren and Stimpy is an old 90's cartoon that aired on Nickolodian. It was way ahead of its time. It was gross, borderline offensive, and one of the best cartoons ever! It had the audacity to go where many kids cartoons of the time rarely touched. with the exception of Rockos Modern Life and a few other shows Ren and Stimpy had sexual innuendos that went over most of our little heads. It was often violent, cruel, but funny as all hell. It was one of those controversial shows that put parents panties in a buntch. As an 18 year old the fact that I never noticed some of the hidden innuendo in this show makes it even more funny. The fact that it wasn't the type of show that talks down to kids is an added plus. Some times I wonder how far Billy West, John K. and the other peaple who worked on the show would have went without Nicks restrictions and cencorship. Season 3 and a halfish didn't disappoint that much. This box set has some of my favorite episodes like A Yard Too Far, Jerry the Bellybutton elf, and Lair of the Lummux. In the commentary the makers said that originally there was going to be a farting contest in that episode, which feeds my curiousity even more to how far this show could have gone. I was a little disappointed that certain episodes weren't commentaried. Its actually very interesting hearing where the ideas came from. I noticed something strange though. By the 3rd disc With the exception of Farm Hands and some other ones, the episodes became kind of dull and forgettable. From reviews I've read its due to the original workers for the show being fired and replaced by peaple chosen by Nick to make part of the 4th season in this box set. That makes sense. I mean it felt like compared to the episodes of the 1st box set and first two disc, they were holding back and less bold. It was kind of disappointing in that aspect. Other than that if you're a huge fan of Ren and Stimpy this is worth having at least for the more ballsy and extreme episodes early on. Its worth a buy.",1284681600,,2140,4.286419753086419
2277914,4,B0009CTV4U,"Now this collection isn't as groundbreaking or smartly hilarious or even as well-drawn. But for a classic cartoon missing its creator, its still very enjoyable.

Now all of these episodes would've been better if Spumco had finished them. But with these seasons, you got more original and strange plot ideas and even stranger jokes. Its been said in other reviews that the episodes get monotonous. But its a good formula. Games even developed their own weird, arguably equal style of stupid cartoon-making. More chaotic, freeform, plotless and fun. But not as smart, artistic or funny. What's really amazing in these episodes is the BEAUTIFUL color and background work in this season. The addition of Wilbur Cobb is great for those of us with a macarbe sense of humor.

Now for the negatives: It is missing the great storytelling and expert comic direction of the early episodes. There was alot of heart under all of the original crass fart and nipple jokes. Billy West taking over most of the voices is admirable, but his Ren is the worst. You just feel so much intesity is lost in the title characters. Also, John K berating the efforts of the Games studio during commentaries gets really old. He goes on and on with his bitterness while the other artists try to see the positives. Its understandable bitterness, but its still just sad.

What's ironic is when John K produced new Ren and Stimpy cartoons with APC, he fell into all of the criticisms he made against Games! Flat characterization, weak voice acting, mostly unfunny moments, pointless plots and being disgusting for disgusting's sake.

2277938,4,B0009CTV4U,"I did a review for season 1 and 2 which i bought at the same time as this. Here it is listed below:

**********

I remember ren and stimpy back in the 90's on tv, catching it on tv was rare but awesome.

Needless to say, when i found it for sale on here i went for it. The prices it was at seemed worth it, but I have to admit there were things I guess i just didn't pay attention to back then.

I cant for the life of me remember the animation being so stock. colours quite blotched and dull, but I guess that adds to the charm of it.

All these classic episodes still get the laughs out of me. I guess its one of those collectables which I will hold onto for a while, but I don't really see myself watching it all that much more then once.

Passed it onto friends, they had the same feeling about it. Awesome yet they also forgot about how stock it was, I blame new CG in movies, new gen animation (ala pixar) and the death of 2D cartoons (mind you, the simpsons still rule that domain).

Good to remind you of lesser stressful times and being care free. Definatly a happy happy happy purchase!",1182816000,2,1096,4.046296296296297
2277939,5,B0009CTV4U,These weren't as golden and classic as the first volume (Seasons 1 and 2) but there are mostly great episodes on here. I've enjoyed watching them and being able to actually collect such nice copies.,1174953600,,198,4.685714285714286
2277940,4,B0009CTV4U,"Now they've gotten better. (Read my review for Season One Ren and Stimpy, under the title ""If I were drunk, I'd be crackin' up. But I wasn't"".
The commentary is the same--lax.
Audio is still great in this one. The music accompaniment had memorable classical music, which is rare in many cartoons. Now-a-days they'd use New Age or Modern Classical music, excluding the old Looney Tunes but even then they'd use the same piece over and over, cartoon after cartoon. But still, the monotony is all the same. Kind of like Tom and Jerry; tedious, chase the mouse... chase the mouse... chase the mouse. Very boring and mind numbing.
This DVD isn't for me. I prefer a decent with smarter characters.",1170892800,,691,4.7190082644628095
2277941,5,B0009CTV4U,"From ""No Pants Today"" to ""Egg Yolkeo"" this Ren and Stimpy set is packed with some really funny and well-written episodes that bring back such great memories for me.  Whether Powdered Toast Man is trying to save Little Johnny, or Ren's nature show is examining Lummoxes, there's so much great stuff in here I can't name it all.  Sure, ""Circus Midgets"" was a disappointing episode, and ""It's a Dog's Life"" and ""Bass Masters"" aren't much beyond a rehashing of old episode ideas, but really, they don't even make a dent in the wonderful quality of Season Three and a Half-ish.

The only thing I didn't like about this set was its adult rating.  The verbal content of the DVD previews and commentaries taints a show that could be easily enjoyed by kids as well as adults.  But then again, the commentaries are insightful at times, especially for episodes like, ""Eat My Cookies"" (which had a special guest star) and ""Stimpy's Cartoon Show"" which showed a parody of the animation industry.  Even so, I was let down a few times when the commentators laughed at what they were saying more than what was being shown on the screen.

The commentaries are filled with criticism against the later drawings of Ren and Stimpy, where the duo looks too much like a cookie-cutter presentation.  A lot of what is said by the commentators (who produced the original show) is quite valid, but I'm glad they were limited by Nickelodeon in a way, since it forced them to be a little more creative with their content in order to avoid putting too much obscene stuff up on the screen.  That might explain why the Spike TV Ren and Stimpy didn't do too well.

""An Abe Divided"" is easily the best cartoon in this set, even though ""Hermit Ren"" is my personal favorite.  Like many episodes in the series, it's both funny and eerie, in a way that only Ren and Stimpy could be.",1169251200,4,1844,4.574468085106383

2277945,3,B0009CTV4U,"During the 1980's, animator John Kristfalusi had been trapped in the same rut as animators during those days. A time in which animators had absolutely zero input in the creation or writing of the shows they were forced to put some semblance of life into by networks who would create new animated television shows out of a need for marketing. The result was that the state of animation as an medium for expression was well and truly dead.

Enter John Kristfalusi. Along with pioneering one of the first animated shows completely created and written by the cartoonists, he and his Spumco team created the most widely remembered and one of the most celebrated attempts to revitalize the animation industry with the incredibly groundbreaking ""Ren and Stimpy Show""

So.... what the hell happened?

Immediately constrained by the limitations and the aggravation of censors and executives who would not allow the show to become what it truly had the potential to be, and a vast misunderstanding of the revolutionary concept of the ""Creator-driven-cartoon"" (A term that the network ironically coined), Kristfalusi and his team of animation revolutionists faced roadblock after frustrating roadblock from day one.

Finally, after 2 incredible seasons, and faced with the realization that their meddling was more trouble than it was worth, the network opted for a solution to this problem. However, their solution was one that only a network would think to make... They had removed the duties of working on the show away from Kristfalusi, and attempted to hire away his writers. However, the bulk of them remaining loyal, only a small handful of Spumco employees stayed on.

The result is the beginning of the end, chronicled with this set.

This set is far more educational than enjoyable, especially for most fans of The Ren and Stimpy Show.

Beginning halfway into season 2 (while Spumco episodes were in various production stages), and truly beginning with the 3rd set is when the downfall of the Ren and Stimpy show begins it's steady plummet into a sad, and miserable fate.

The beginning of Season 3 plainly shows the newly appointed company ""Games Productions"" running off of the vapors of old Spumco ideas, without any clear idea on how to utilize them.

Halfway into season three upon nearly running out of Spumco ideas to steal and re-hash is when the show plummets in every conceivable venture. As it soon begins to become apparent that fresh and interesting ideas have made way to generic plots, it's as if the team just stopped caring or trying.

At this point without a central director, with whole episodes having no directors, and only names used for those that oversaw more aspects of the cartoons than others in place of a Directors Credit. It is this set and the Seasons 4 and 5 set, of R&S that show glimmers of potential being washed down the drain. WIth no potential being left at the end save for a miserable and well deserved cancellation.

However, I should point out that despite my seemingly negative review of the episodes themselves, this set is far from illustrating the indignancies that The Ren and Stimpy Show would receive by seasons 4 and 5. Which makes this set worth picking uip along with one other all important saving grace:

Commentaries.

The commentaries on this set, shows many of the original team watching and their reactions to the downward spiral of the show. But this is not all they do.

The commentaries are exceptionally insightful, offering glimpses of what Spumco's full ideas would have been, what they could have done, and the direction they were headed before the show took it's nosedive without them.

Most commentaries will prove to be INCREDIBLY insightful into the education of the process in which Ren and Stimpy were robbed of their formulas of success, and an incredible commentary for ""Stimpy's Cartoon Show"" which chronicles not only the demise of this show itself, but also a valuable history lesson about the decline of quality animation from the years of 1960 to 1990.

The set receives 3 stars out of 5 from me, because some fun can be dug up from witnessing the beginning of the end for the most original, and most revolutionary animated show of the 1990's.

Trust me... with the next set ""Season Five and some more of Four"" you will see worse. Much, much worse.",1150848000,56,4324,4.893296853625171

2277951,1,B0009CTV4U,"Where am I supposed to start?  How can I properly describe my sense of outrage and betrayal after purchasing and watching this abomination of a DVD collection?

I suppose i will begin by urging you to buy the 1st and 2nd seasons of Ren and Stimpy.  Under the strict guidance of the legendary John K., the Spumco team created some of the most hilarious, groundbreaking, visually stunning cartoons ever aired, despite being hampered endlessly by the censors at Nickolodeon.

Now, imagine a bunch of conservative, power-hungry rich people, taking it upon themselves to fire John K., while retaining rights to his incredible show.  They then have their own animators (whose combined vision and talent amounts to something that John K. would have scraped off the bottom of his shoe with a stick) continue the show for several blasphemous seasons, exploiting it for all it's worth, and destroying everything that made Ren and Stimpy great.

That's more or less the foundation of this DVD collection.  Anyone who has any significant appreciation for the genius of John K.'s work on the show will find this junkpile to be nothing short of agony to behold: flat, uninteresting animation, far, far too many disgusting and disturbing images, and a near-complete lack of the hilarious, quasi-homosexual bond between Ren and Stimpy: they seem like bad actors who have been thrown together at the last minute and forced to perform bad imitations of their lives in seasons one and two.

What's more, the many episode commentaries are done by John K and Co: In these commentaries you can feel the suppressed anger of the team, as they watch the horrible versions of the cartoons they should have been making themselves.

After only one day of watching this collection, all it has given me is a hollow feeling in the pit of my stomach.  The tragedy that befell this brilliant program is painful to witness, and the fact that i had to pay more than forty dollars of my hard-earned Canadian money to do so seems little short of cause for rebellion.",1125187200,18,2029,4.855072463768116
2277952,1,B0009CTV4U,"The release of this... this putrid corporate ""cartoon"" amounts to the greatest slap in the face I've yet received from the ""kindly"" people at nickelodean/viacom. By this point, Jon K had had his own show yanked out from under him. Spumco had been fired and the TRAITOROUS billy west remained behind to voice both Ren and Stimpy. All of the subversive and at times subconscious humour contained within this programme are GONE.

Resorting to the rickety crutch of body humour and tired slapstickery, this show's nadir was not long in coming. Let this serve as notice to all: AVOID ANYTHING AFTER SEASON ONE AND TWO. It is NOT the Ren and Stimpy you know, it does NOT contain a shred of intellect nor any semblence of wit and it definitely should NOT have been released.

What you are left with are the well-picked remains of a once brilliant television show ravenously gutted by corporate scum who would rather pander to advertisers. Spineless little worms. This thing deserves no stars whatsoever but perhaps by the time the atrocious final ""season"" is released, that will be an option.

2277953,4,B0009CTV4U,"Well, I'm going to be the voice of ""I rather like it"" here, and say that this set was actually enjoyable for me. My favorite R&S episode ever, ""The House Of Next Tuesday"", is here, with the classic ""Oh boy, that smells so good, I have to smell it again!"" line that kept me and my friends in stitches for days. The other episodes - well, they really vary, some are good, IMO, others are just sick without any redeeming humor.

Not much else to say - video and sound quality are good, the menues work, and the commentaries are amusing. This set is only for people who already know that they like these episodes. If you don't, well, what are you reading this for?",1123545600,8,660,4.28

2277975,2,B0009CTV4U,"Am glad I rented this set down at the local video store before spending any real money. While it's interesting to see what Games did with the characters after Spumco, the majority of the cartoons don't have anywhere near the overall appeal of the first DVD set. And despite the fairly high artistic quality of the cartoons, the majority are unfunny and just plain mean-spirited... lots of violence, weird drawings and psychotic nonsense... for no apparent reason. These reek of the output of ""content creators""... you know, it's just an advertisement delivery device, so who cares what it's about, as long as it captures the desired demographic.

The exceptions are mostly the cartoons originated at Spumco: Lair of the Lummox, Salve or Salve Not, some moments of No Pants Today, Yard Too Far and Ren's Pecs. I did think two Games creations were ok... An Abe Divided and Egg Yolkeo... the former having a pretty humorous story, the latter having a bizarre, but humorous story and a great Disney-esque animation of Ren freaking out at the end... but that's it. The rest have little to no replay value. The commentaries on the discs with the old Spumco crew are interesting... mostly being a lament on the demise of their creation... but it would've been even better to hear what the Games folks were thinking when they made these... their absence is telling... one thing is for sure, they made these for the money, baby!

Instead Paramount should have brought out a set of all the Adult Party Cartoons... including the ones SpikeTV never broadcasted... and maybe with a ""best of"" Games episodes disc.

My advice, if you are in doubt, go rent this at your local video store first.",1122249600,19,1678,4.799307958477509
2277976,3,B0009CTV4U,"Arguably, when it came to the last DVD package with Ren & Stimpy, most of the beloved cartoons were edited down, and not resolved into a must-have for die hard fans of the Nickelodeon classic cat & dog duo. The move was a unfortunate and crucial dissapointement on so many of the delightful cartoons that made them legends. While that did cave in a bit, the next version is arguably under the exact same spell with showing the beginning of the demise of the two. With John K., the creator of Ren & Stimpy leaving the voice of Ren behind and giving it to Billy West, Stimpy's voice, the show had to go on a new path.

The Ren & Stimpy Show: Seasons Three & A Halfish, sneaks within the third and part of the fourth years for the Cat & Dog duo. At the time when Nicktoon cartoons like Rocko's Modern Life, AHHHHHH!! Real Monsters, and Doug were really great connectors to the younger crowds, Ren & Stimpy still showed potential with great cartoons like Ren's Pecs, were plastic surgery from Stimpy's heiny is now Ren's chest, Eat My Cookies: with the focus of Ren & Stimpy score several badges in a scouting troup, with guest voice Rosie O'Donnell as the scoutmaster, Road Apples: with the duo trying to live their lives in a modest but weird motorhome, and Hard Time For Haggis, with the duo in cameos, and take over the spotlight from a old time Scottish star Haggis McHaggis, and others to name a few. Like the first DVD collection where so many great shorts were edited down for space, this collection also hits that same roadblock for die hard fans of Ren & Stimpy, which continues to remain very unfortunate.

All in all, Paramount should've really learned from the previous collection but they haven't took the motions scorned. Still, for anybody who hasn't seen Ren & Stimpy from the Nickelodeon days, or the recent revivals from Spike!, this is still worth a passing glance. As for those die hard fans of Ren & Stimpy, this is worth passing up those laughs. No Joy!!

2277977,2,B0009CTV4U,"This set contains all of season three and half of season four of the series. This way, Paramount can release three mediocore seasons in only two sets, as their next set will contain the rest of season four and season five.

At ths point in the series' roller coaster ride, the show was just taken from John K and Spumco, and was now being made by Nickelodeon and their company Games Animaton. I'll get right to the point: if you love the first and second season episodes of the show like I do, you most likely will be very disappointed by these. The show is a mere shell of what it was. Visually, it looks alright, with nice background painting and some good posing work (not exactly Spumco-quality though), but the writing and stories are completely abysmal. There's none of the wacky humor of the original shows, and they're about stories that I don't care about. And the show's keep going and going, and then they just end. Pretty much all of these shows have inconclusive endings; they just stop. Billy West is doing Stimpy, and now Ren here, as well as essentially every other voice. It could practically be called the Billy West show. As brilliant a voice actor he is, it's really just too much. Between this and the misplacement of celebrity voices, who have absolutely no place in the world of Ren & Stimpy (like Rosie O'Donnell), the show doesn't sound good either. The shame is that some episodes have a good premise (""Hard Times for Haggis"") or start out well (""Hermit Ren"") and they turn completely awful. It's a stone cold shame.

So if I hate these shows so much, then why am I giving it two stars? Well, it's got some things going for it. On the first disc, some of the episodes there were originally started at Spumco and finished by Games. But, they still retain some good moments. Shows like ""To Salve or Salve Not!"", ""Stimpy's Cartoon Show"", and ""Jimminy Lummox"" have some moments I like. John K and the original Spumco team are bcak for more commentary on a lot of shows, and I'd say they're worth listening too, but I really enjoy listening to commentairies. And, the box and disc art, and the actual DVD is very well done.

Is this set worth getting? I'd say no, but some extreme Ren and Stimpy fans might be interested in getting it. Be forwarned that the next set ""Season Five and Some of Four"" can only be worse, and will be followed by an Adult Party Cartoon set, which many R & S fans have been waiting for.",1121126400,7,2434,4.465168539325843
2277978,1,B0009CTV4U,"I don't own this DVD, but I've heard about what happened. Even THESE episodes have cuts in them. Although they are the Games episodes, they deserve to be edited, but that's not how DVDs should be. There's only 1 extra on it. It just proves that Paramount Home Video is just completely careless and makes DVDs on a tight budget. The fans have suffered long eough.",1120953600,,362,4.5
2277979,1,B0009CTV4U,"I was extremely disappointed to find that at least three episodes (so far) contain significant cuts.  For example, a few minutes are missing from the episode with Haggis McHaggis and the Leprechaun, which means they have even trimmed down the Nick re-run cuts from ten years ago.  Viacom proves again to be sloppy and dismissive of fan interests when producing television show DVDs.",1120780800,10,382,5.0476190476190474
2277980,3,B0009CTV4U,"I'm a big fan of Ren and Stimpy, always have been since they debuted way back in the early 90's on Nick. ""Season Three and a Halfish"" is an okay collection, but does have some of my favorite episodes. Why I say that this season and a half collection is okay is because it just doesn't seem to make me laugh as hard as I did with the first two seasons. But episodes like ""Hermit Ren"" keep this very much worth getting, ""Hermit Ren"" possibly being my all time favorite Ren and Stimpy episode.

What's worst about this is the lack of extras. Ren and Stimpy Uncut, the first two season that were released on DVD, had a crap load of extras even including a ""banned"" episode that later appeared on Spike TV. But this has nothing but commentary during the episodes? Lame. I'm not a fan of commentary; I never listen to it on any of my DVDs. I prefer sit down in front of the camera interviews like what was given on the first DVD.

Overall, you're only getting your moneys worth for the episodes, because if you are buying this for the extras, you are getting ripped off big time. As if commentary by Ren and Stimpy themselves, which is on here, would make the commentary more interesting, it doesn't. The episodes are pretty much the way I remember them, sometimes I'm laughing hard, sometimes giggling and at other times no emotion. The ""Hard Times for Haggis"" episode didn't make me laugh at all, it actually made me feel sorry for McHaggis and I know that that wasn't the episodes intention. This was after John K. left Ren and Stimpy and his absence can be seen on this collection. Not to say that this collection is entirely bad, it has some really great stuff, but the lack of extras and some mediocre episodes weigh this collection down. A big departure from the last DVD, NEED MORE EXTRAS. So if you're a R&S fan, get it, I did but don't expect anything big. Being a hardcore Ren and Stimpy fan,  I never thought I'd be saying this but let's just hope the next DVD is better.",1120694400,,1977,4.366847826086956
2277981,1,B0009CTV4U,"I haven't watched all the discs yet. The content is OK, but I have a major complaint about the way the DVDs are set up. Depending how your DVD player works, you may have a problem avoiding being forced to watch previews of other DVD products. Other companies do this, but the real problem here is that the previews on the 1st disc are for South Park and Chappelle and they are very offensive. Just because you like Ren and Stimpy doesn't mean You enjoy being assaulted by those other shows. If you do watch these and there are any children or guests present, you might wish to first mute the DVD player. This is so stupid and inconvenient. If you want Chappelle, buy Chappelle, I don't want to censor that, but why do the rest of us have to be inflicted with it without choice, simply to watch Ren and Stimpy?

In any event: BE WARNED -- THE DVD ADVERTISEMENTS ARE NASTY!",1120521600,5,871,4.343558282208589
2277982,1,B0009CTV4U,"I have a lot of the episodes I recorded off of TV years ago. Well after I watched the DVD versions it is evident that a lot of things were cut.

One of my favorites ""Road Apples"" had probably some of the best parts of it cut out. One scene where Ren & Stimpy were told a bedtime story about ""the phantom who stalks his victims and tears them limb from limb, but not before he bores them with endless hours of showbizz talk"". Then, Ren & Stimpy are introduced to their new roommate Wilbur Cobb, who then proceeds to bore R & S with ""endless hours of showbizz talk"". Stimpy getting tired looks up at Wilbur and says ""Excuse me Mr. Phantom, will you rip us limb from limb now?""

That is one of the funniest parts but yet it is omitted.

Don't buy it if you don't want your original memories of Ren & Stimpy ruined. I am going to petition Viacom and ask them for my money back.",1120348800,46,873,4.093567251461988

Now I am very angry and disappointed to find out, that the german Television showed many scenes, that are missing on these DVD's. So the Boxes are cut and my old recordings uncut = for me are these DVD-boxes worthless. Besides the picture-quality of the DVD's is on some Episodes worse compared to my recordings.
