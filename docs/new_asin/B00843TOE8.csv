8524971,3,B00843TOE8,"Basically a behind the scenes of a few workouts at OSU. I was hoping for more of a ""clinic"" type production. You pretty much just watch the team run through a couple workouts with minimal explanation of purpose or pace; things learned easily by anyone who has ever run before. It does give you a good glimpse of the interactions between coach and athlete, and surprisingly it isn't as business-like as you'd expect from a top-notch D-I program. There is some value in the video but not really $50 worth. I would maybe pay $20 if I had the chance again. Definitely glad I used a gift card and not my own money for this.",1362614400,,618,4.3826086956521735
