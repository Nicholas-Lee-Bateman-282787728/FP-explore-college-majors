I have a collection of these DVDs, enough to keep it interesting. Motivation is no longer a challenge. I really enjoy the scenery and the pace. Brilliant idea!",1494460800,,302,4.509090909090909
8569974,5,B00BKK71B0,"Love this series especially with Johnny.  He encourages but isn't bugging you all the time.  They are a good pace, nice scenery and for me 35 minutes on my elliptical is all I can do at least for now.  Just wish he would do a Paris one.  I have several of this series and no dud yet.",1456012800,,283,3.912280701754386

8569976,5,B00BKK71B0,I thoroughly enjoy being able to go places through video that I may never in real life.  I especially like Johnny. He leads the run without out being too chatty or bubbly.  His tone is just right.  He throws in some geographic information and history along the way witch is also pleasant.  The music Moves you along at a fine pace. The forward motion of the run is great as is the quality of video.  It's amazingly smooth without jarring.  I get a little thrown cutting through crowds and my sense of motion gets off kilter but I just adjust and keep going.  Will be getting more with Johnny.,1412726400,3,592,4.376146788990826
