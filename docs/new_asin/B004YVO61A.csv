She is so pleased with the packaging and espescially with the quality of the DVD's. Her mum was lucky in purchasing a dvd player here in Australia so she could view dvd's from America.  Well done once again Amazon. THANK YOU!!!",1327622400,,329,4.483333333333333

4503936,4,B004YVO61A,"Bought the series as I could afford them. Season by season.  I loved this show when it was on because I was the same age as the characters.  I was in the middle of watching season 5, volume 2 disc 2.  Watched 1 episode every night right before bed.  Then this past Saturday, there was a fire & I lost everything!  I'll just have to buy the complete series (and of course a new tv & DVD player), so I can watch them again!",1390780800,,421,3.9642857142857144

4503938,5,B004YVO61A,it was a gift for my melrose place fanatic friend and they couldn't be happier to add it to their collection. both volumes being in the package helped with my decision.,1389052800,,168,4.451612903225806
4503939,5,B004YVO61A,"I've always had fond memories of this show, and I'm so glad I can now relive them over and over again on DVD.  Although I loved the show from episode 1, it definitely got better once Heather Locklear came into it.  I'm so glad she remained with the show until the end.  I also love that Alyssa Milano - one of my favourite actresses - is in season 6.  This show is my guilty pleasure, and if anyone likes shows which take them away from reality for a while, then this is definitely the show to watch.",1377993600,2,500,4.123711340206185
4503940,5,B004YVO61A,"lOVED THE SHOW, ONCE AGAIN I JUST WANTED THE ORGINAL DVDS!!! I Love Heather Locklear!!! By this time, new characters arrived and orginals left!!!",1374019200,,145,5.083333333333333
4503941,5,B004YVO61A,I have always been a fan of Melrose Place and have all seasons. This would be one of my favorites. Worth the money,1365552000,,114,4.0
4503942,5,B004YVO61A,I have enjoyed watching this show again from years ago.  I am glad it is available on DVD to watch as much as I want!,1363737600,,117,3.68
4503943,5,B004YVO61A,"I had heard about Melrose Place but didn't watch it- 90210 was on my radar and after that went off the air I just wasn't interested.....boy was I stupid.  I have seen the whole six years of Melrose Place and was really thrilled. The show had everything; romance, deceit, and enough going on that you (me) couldn't wait to put in the next tape.
I now see why Heather Locklear got her big break - she was terrific (and I never particularly liked her or had seen her in anything before Melrose). The story takes place in a LA apartment building  and the residents are where the various storylines come in. Lots of love and lots of good looking guys and gals.  Many of the actors I recognize from other shows. Heather plays a high powered big wig at an advertisement company. She is not the most pleasant person but here and there you see her vulnerbility. There are lots of lies, lots of loving going on in this apartment. The set is really neat with the apartment laid out on two floors and a swimming pool in the middle. Everybody can see everybody and everyone knows everyone's business. I don't want to give anything away but this is not to be passed up; I don't know why I never watched it but I am really glad that I finally did!",1354752000,,1232,4.324675324675325
4503944,5,B004YVO61A,any melrose fans this is a great is a great set. will watch it again and again. the two pack was nice.,1353715200,,102,3.6818181818181817

8448949,5,B004YVO61A,This was such a great show in it's day!  I loved it and am happy I now own the discs.,1461369600,,85,3.25
8448950,5,B004YVO61A,"I obviously love Melrose Place since I purchased all of them.  I did get annoyed when the characters in the show kept referring to Kyle as a good  man when in my judgment,he was a total ,,moron, petty , a sneak, a know nothingand totally lacking in the social graces and nothing will convince  me  that Amanda would give him the time of day. Sydney was a wonderful character, allison a total annoyance and the medical office of Manncini and Burns was pure fantasy - my father and brother are doctors and both Sydney and Megan would have been fired immmediately if they told the doctors to get their own files (Sydney)  or if they had the audacity to keep a tape that belonged to the doctor (Megan),  Jo was a refreshing change from the other women as she portrayed a world weary sophisticate. Billy was everybodys darling.  Eve trailertrashy and  not fo  a minute did I think Peter would want her in his life - and then there is Michael who began being cute and sweet and then became such a coniver.  Lexy  transitioned  from a spoiled but nice young lady who took a wrong turn.  An interesting group to say the least.",1442188800,,1118,4.421568627450981
8448951,3,B004YVO61A,"I watched every episode of course, as Beverly Hills 90210 was my favorite TV show! The acting is not good, the story lines predictable and unbelievable, but still a 90's classic that is loved by many, I won't watch the series again as I would watch reruns of 90210 any and every time, but different strokes for different folks I guess....",1441152000,,338,4.557377049180328

8448955,5,B004YVO61A,"I have one more season to get, but if you loved the craziness, and revolving doors of Melrose Place. Then re-live it all over again with the sixth season double pack. By far a good purchase and deal!!!!",1403136000,,202,4.342105263157895
