8522461,5,B007WB5DOI,"A recent Boulez Mahler release featured an early work, Des Knaben Wunderhorn, with his 10th. Symphony Adagio.(his last work), an imaginative juxtaposition.

This 2011 Salzburg concert presents an even earlier work, Das Klagende Lied, with two of Alban Berg's, Lulu Suite, and Der Wein (wine). Berg was of course, a disciple of Mahler's, and one can certainly hypothesize that, had Mahler lived longer, his music was heading in the direction of the territory occupied by Berg.

I am no Berg expert, and bow to B. Guerrero's fine review of the two works offered here. Despite my limited history with Berg's works, I did find them extremely well done, the VPO playing exquisitely as usual, and great singing from Prohaska and Roschmann make me want to get to know this music better.

The Mahler Klagende Lied, is really a cantata, not a song cycle. Its translation is ""Sorrowful Song"", Originally in three movements, Mahler condensed it to two, and modified the orchestration in order to get it performed. Remember, this work predates his symphonies, so his reputation had yet to be established. The story, like in many operas, is bordering on the absurd, with a man killing his brother, and a minstrel finding a bone from the body, and making a flute out of it. The cantata ends with a wedding party at the palace, with the king being identified as the murderer. Go figure.

The most interesting part of this work is the multitude of little melodies and sequences that eventually end up in Mahler's symphonies. Quite the recycler! But the orchestration is very advanced for such an early work, and shows Mahler already has a firm grip on his style. It's all very enjoyable, as is the singing from the always excellent Anna Larssen, Dorothea Roschmann, Johan Botha, and a sizeable mixed choir. Boulez displays a firm hand, with the minimum of physical exertion, as usual. An off-stage orchestra augments the VPO.

Sound and video are impeccable,  as one expects from the C-major label.

Even if you are a Mahler fan, you may not have seen a performance of this work. Give it a try!",1342915200,4,2078,4.820224719101123
8522462,5,B007WB5DOI,"Two Alban Berg works, followed by Mahler's early cantata ""Das Klagende Lied"".

This Salzburg Festival program begins with Berg's ""Lulu Suite"", a five movement work that was originally designed to drum up interest in Berg's second and longer opera, ""Lulu"". Needless to say, Berg's music plays right into the Vienna Philharmonic's 'wheel house' - perhaps even more so than Mahler. This is an absolutely stunning performance, with the Wiener's natural, hyper-romantic tendencies disguising their equally accomplished virtuosity. They make Berg's music sound both beautiful and logical. Looking rather sexy with slightly 'deranged' facial gestures and wild eyes, Anna Prohaska (soprano) would make a terrific Lulu in the full length opera. Here, in the suite version, the soprano has to briefly play two roles. In the fourth movement she sings the brief yet wildly taxing ""Lied der Lulu"" (Lulu's song), in which Lulu delivers here incantation - her personal Credo, if you will - as to what does and doesn't make her tick. It's a sort of free wheeling, pre-feminist manifesto that would do Gloria Steinem proud. You get the idea.

In the final movement, after a few loud 'neutron chords' that accompany Lulu's senseless murder by the hands of none other than Jack The Ripper, the soprano then sings Countess Geschwitz's pathetic soliloquy to her - Countess Geschwitz being the only still living person to have remained loyally in love with Lulu to the bitter end. Yes, it's all very sordid, but Berg ties together all the loose ends of this wild and ridiculous tale with achingly beautiful, yet fully modern music. Needless to say, Pierre Boulez knows this music as well or better than anybody.

All that said, the real surprise for me came by way of Berg's 15 minute concert aria for soprano and orchestra, ""Der Wein"". I've never been a big fan of this particular work. But here on the stage at Salzburg, Dorothea Roschmann delivers an absolutely knock-out performance. I can't say that I have much comparative knowledge in this piece - I do know that Jessye Norman recorded it decades ago. But Roschmann has to be as good as anyone who has tackled it in front of microphones, and probably far better than most. I cannot overstate what a great job she does on this difficult, 15 minute long aria extolling the virtues of imbibing oneself in good-old vino (a strange text indeed). Needless to say, the VPO and Boulez feel equally at home on this work as well.

This video concludes with a fine performance of Mahler's two-movement, revised version of ""Das Klagende Lied"" (Song of Lament). Now a brief word from me on ""DKL"".

Mahler's first version was a three movement work that included a sort of prelude-like movement titled ""Waldmaerchen"" (Forest Legend). Because of difficulties in trying to get the work performed, Mahler soon revised the work - condensing the text and slightly simplifying his elaborate orchestration in the process. Just as with ""Blumine"" in relation to Mahler's first version of his first symphony, it became apparent to Mahler that ""Waldmaerchen"" was superfluous to the overall narrative. Thus, he dropped it. But just as with ""Blumine"", many fans derided the loss of ""Waldmaerchen"", arguing that it should remain on the strength of its music alone. As a result, ""DKL"" is now usually performed in a 'hybrid' version: the two revised movements plus ""Waldmaerchen"".

Boulez's Salzburg performance is so well executed and realized, that I now fully agree that ""Waldmaerchen"" is little more non-essential padding to the story. Here, soprano Dorothea Roschmann is joined by mezzosoprano Anna Larsson and tenor Johan Botha - the very tenor who has done such a fine job on both Boulez's and Bertrand de Billy's recordings of Mahler's eighth symphony. They make for quite a trio!

If you're not familiar with ""Das Klagende Lied"", there's a lot of material that pre-echoes what one hears in later Mahler. Mahler's frequent juxtaposition of the jubilant, the ironic, and the just plain tragic, is fully developed and realized to an almost shocking level in this early work. It's as though Mahler started from the world of Verdi's ""Rigoletto"", then leaned it towards the eventual, expressionistic horror-shows of Berg and Schoenberg (more Berg, really). Perhaps that's precisely what Boulez wished to illustrate with his somewhat creative program.

As is so true throughout all of Mahler's oeuvre, he has one foot firmly planted in the tonal world of the 19th century, while planting the other foot into the newer territory of the 20th century - especially in regards to clarity and orchestration. In ""Das Klagende Lied"", Mahler makes use of a fully offstage orchestra to symbolize happy village life, as well as the jubilant proceedings of a wedding party. Boulez and his Viennese partners do an outstanding job in making these offstage parts both audible and clear, without also being positioned too near. They get it just right, which certainly isn't always the case on many recordings. All in all, this was a truly fine opening to last year's Salzburg Festival.",1342742400,9,5075,5.047732696897374
