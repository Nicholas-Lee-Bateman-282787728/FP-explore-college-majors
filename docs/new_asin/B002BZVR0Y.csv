8362624,2,B002BZVR0Y,"Ealing fouled up on this release. Don't get me wrong the transfer is beautiful having used 35mm elements, but it's cut. I bought a VHS copy of this film years ago that was taken from a 16mm TV print, and that was also cut but it had the missing footage not included in the DVD. My only thought is that a censored copy was used editing out anything that might be offensive. This copy runs 66 minutes. If you add the missing footage that's in the VHS the complete running time should be 71 minutes. Hopefully Ealing will soon release a complete copy of the classic film.",1345248000,6,568,4.317757009345795
