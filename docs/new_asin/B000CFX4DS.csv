2463656,5,B000CFX4DS,"Not only does my 18 month old love this video, my 4 year old does too. Finally a video they can watch together. They love the barn dance at the end. I really like how the shape starts out as a simple black shape and then becomes part of a fun animation. This teaches my 4 year old how to find shapes in every day settings. This is now one of his favorite games. And the repetative style of all the videos in this series is no doubt how my daughter learns from them.",1172102400,,465,3.9574468085106385
2463657,5,B000CFX4DS,"Both my 9 month old and 2 year old love this movie. While I find it slightly annoying, my kids love it.

He asks to watch it all of the time.",1171238400,,279,3.8596491228070176

2463666,5,B000CFX4DS,"My son is almost 2 and loves these DVDs. I bought shapes, colors, letters and numbers about nine months ago in hopes to boost his vocabulary since he still wasn't talking. The videos have helped a lot. Colors is his favorite but he really enjoys the shapes too. He loses interest in the others pretty quickly. After just a couple weeks he knew all of his shapes and colors and now we just watch them for fun. I really try to limit his screen time so it's a great alternative to parking him in front of one of the random cartoons on tv. At least he's learning something. We also have the books and flash cards that go with the videos. I definitely recommend the preschool prep series.",1463443200,,683,4.34375

I have bought 2 different sets for our family and have bought multiple sets as gifts. I would definitely recommend this product and their whole series. Every video that my kids were exposed to, they learned the concept within a week or 2. Their videos Meet the Diagraphs and Meet the Blends taught me a lot and my kids teach others (even other adults) because of it. Buy it and use it.

2463700,5,B000CFX4DS,"I rented this on Prime Instant Video since it had so many great ratings and reviews. My 2.5 year old toddler was not able to identify any of his shapes at that point. As soon as the video started, I was like, ""Are you kidding me!? This is ridiculous!"" The whole video is CONSTANT repetition that would really drive an adult insane. BUT, after he watched it one time, he knew all the basic shapes and could identify them around the house. I showed it to him one more time about 2 weeks later and he learned even more! He doesn't go to school or watch any other shape videos, but after watching this one just 2 times he is always pointing out shapes in very creative ways wherever we go! It is so awesome! I would definitely recommend for a first shapes video if your child is can speak at least some words and has not learned their basic shapes yet.",1407974400,,848,4.2407407407407405

I suppose it gets the job done of teaching kids the shape names, but there is literally zero story line.  After 20 seconds of the kids watching this in the car, my husband and I were sick of it.  After a minute or two, my 2 year old daughter started yelling ""Elmo Elmo"" - in other words, put the Elmo DVD back in, Mom.  I'm trying to get my older son to remember his shapes though, and I do think it might help with that in the end.",1376179200,,520,3.9711538461538463

2463717,2,B000CFX4DS,"I don't get why the front of this DVD has so many awards.  This DVD is so boring it should be shown to put kids to sleep. This video should be used to train chimps the english language.  No songs, no fancy graphics, no fun.  It basically shows you the letter on the TV, says the letter, then moves on.  Boring. Go back to Elmo or whatever your kids like to watch.",1352592000,,363,4.0
2463718,5,B000CFX4DS,"I started playing this video when my baby was probably 6 months old everyday once a day.  At first as with all his videos, he would watch for a couple of minutes and then get bored.  But as he got used to it, he started paying attention more.  Eventually he had favorite parts that he would respond to.  For some reason Octagon really got him giggling, especially at the end when she's all alone with cricket sounds.

A few weeks ago, when he was 15 months old, he was playing in a bin of shapes.  I casually said a shape, and he pulled it out.  I said another one, and he pulled that one out too.  I looked at my housekeeper and said, ""Is this just a coincidence?""  She replied, ""I think he really knows it.""  So, then I asked him to find the oval which was half covered, not holding my breath for anything.  Lo and behold, he sifted and found it!  I could not believe my eyes.  That was the very first time he responded to me quite positively that he knew some things.  Well, later I tested him when he was fed and happy in his high chair.  As I said them, he looked, smiled when he saw each one and then grabbed them.

In this video, the only speech you hear is the narrator's voice or the characters' voices saying the shape name.  You derive the story line by watching the characters interact with their environments.  There is obviously friendly music in the background that go with each character.

The circle skateboards.  The square builds a bird house.  The triangle sits in a canoe and feeds the ducks.  The oval makes popcorn.  The star gets on a ride at a place like Chuckey Cheese's and travels space and the ocean.  The octagon plays in the school playground.  The rectangle puts out a campfire as a fire truck.

My baby still enjoys this video and has the biggest grin on his face when the circle comes out and tells the parents to adjust their tv screen if he looks stretched out.",1351555200,3,1897,4.288135593220339
2463719,5,B000CFX4DS,"I rented this video for my Grandson who was 18 months he watched 2 times and immediately learned to identify the shapes, whenever he sees something he now says what shape it is and what color.",1348185600,,192,4.361111111111111
2463720,5,B000CFX4DS,"I love this tape. I actually have shapes, colors, number's and the letter's. It focuses on mainly on the basics. No added extras or distractions to keep the child mind from wandering or memorizing which you don't want. It only focuses on Shapes or Colors and etc.

What I mean by that is when learning tapes have song or dance, the child becomes so focused on 'singing that song' or 'doing that dance' instead of learning and getting an understanding of what being shown. Now I'm not saying put your child in front of the tv and leave him. NO NO NO. What I'm saying is you want something a little extra to help boost what your teaching.

For example I work at a home daycare. My class consist of 1 & 2 year old. After we go through the flash cards (remember they don't have a long attention span) so doing 2 out of the 4 areas four days of the week and switching up the process like Alphabet + colors or numbers + shapes (flash cards) and you keep switching. Which takes only about 10 minutes to do. Then let them have their play time. Now instead of turning on dora, team umizumi or yo gabba gabba. Play two of the Dvds. And when they see that what's on the tv and what they see on the flash cards they get it faster and better, than in song. And of all the learning tapes I have used these are more effective. And I only use these. The other tapes are decor for my shelf.

Get involved with your kid learning stages. Don't let cartoons teach your kids. Cause the only thing their teaching your kid is to sing and dance. Instead of learning. Keep working with them. And by 3 years old their doing sight words and reading by 5 years old on a second grade level. Believe it, It works!",1334793600,,1683,4.204334365325077

Some of the Sesame Street videos seem to be too complicated and sophisticated.  Maybe they are geared for older children.  But this video is really simple.  The graphics are colorful, but really clear about what shape is what.  It's repetitive and simple enough that he's going to know his shapes by the end of a week, tops.

He's learned his shapes and letters in about three weeks. The key to these videos is the constant repetition. Being skeptic, I even tested him by drawing various shapes and finding objects of different shapes, but guess what...he truely knew them. I highly recommend the series of videos from Preschool Prep.",1237680000,4,459,4.897435897435898

The best part, and the reason I bought the videos was to improve his recognition.  After realizing he had picked up the letters from watching Letter Factory with my 3 1/2 years old (""almost 4 Mommy!""), I thought, I need something for colors and shapes.  WOW!  This is so perfect, the tone, repetition, it's everything they need at this age for learning.  And they love it.  Within in a week, he knew all his numbers, colors, and shapes.  While the 3 1/2 is in preschool, I've got my 2 year giving performances at the grocery store.  It's a hoot!  Go ahead, get all three.

2463738,5,B000CFX4DS,My daughters (1.5 & 2.5 yrs. old) love this movie!! They beg me to put it on & yes they are learning their shapes (even my 18 month old!) It might be annoying to someone not viewing the movie because it reapeats the names of the shapes over and over (that's how they remember the nemes & associate it with the shape on screen) but the animated shapes are adorable and doing cute little things that my daughters find hilarious! It's short and cute and perfect for little ones who don't want to sit too long! I am going to buy the rest of the series!! Well worth the money!!,1226448000,2,572,4.209090909090909

2463743,5,B000CFX4DS,"I bought this for my daughter at 18 Months.  She already knew most of her shapes but she did learn a new one via this DVD... OCTAGON!  She loves the DVD and while I do not like her watching lots of meaningless cartoons on TV and DVDs, ""learning"" DVDs such as this one, as well as the other Preschool Prep DVDs are definitely a plus!  She has the entire collection (Shapes, Colors, Numbers, and Letters - which she learned in this order respectively) and enjoys them all.  At this age, children are like sponges... she knows and recognizes the shapes, colors, and numbers up to 10.  She also can recognize some letters of the alphabet.  I highly recommend all of the Preschool Prep DVDs.  I even have the Preschool Prep Alphabet book and my daughter loves that as well... I would imagine that the other books are just as nice.",1209254400,,825,4.46

Meet the Numbers
Meet the Colors

2463745,5,B000CFX4DS,"My youngest son has special needs & mainly uses sign language as a form of communication.  My son can learn all sorts of things from these videos that he was unable to learn in preshcool.  With just days of ""Meet the Numbers"" he knew several numbers and with 2 weeks of ""Meet the Letters"" he was able to name many letters on the cover of Meet the Numbers.  This is a big deal because just saying words clear enough for us to understand is hard yet he was able to say these things.  I even consider somewhat of a speech therapy while he does the video because he talks along with them.  With the simple & repetitive style it is very easy to pick up and they associate the characters with what they are leraning and are able to generatlize it into every day activities.  I HIGHLY recomend this item not only for normal children but for those with special needs.  We use our's in the car on the way to school.

2463747,3,B000CFX4DS,"I bought the Numbers and Letters videos after reading an Ad in a magazine with many awards given to this product. I also read the Amazon reviews.
But I must say, after 5 minutes of viewing with our almost 3 year old, she kept saying ""turn it off"", I don't like it.  I thought it was a bit annoying, but hoped she would enjoy it.  She loves Dora,Sesame Street, Dan Zanes,Backyardigans,Blues Clues, etc....I don't Know?",1196726400,,417,4.546666666666667
2463748,5,B000CFX4DS,"Okay so first of all, as a Kindergarten teacher I'm going to say, ""Don't allow your child to watch too much t.v.""  That said, as a mom, I know that sometimes we need them to keep entertained for a bit while we get a load of a laundry done, or dinner started, etc. so, at least in my opinion, t.v. becomes a must from time to time.  In my opinion, there are great shows on t.v. such as The Backyardigans, Blues Clues, Sesame Street, Between the Lions (highly recommend for early readers), Hi 5, The Wiggles, etc. etc.
In addition to these shows, these Preschool Prep videos are the best!  We pretty much have all of these videos at home and my kids love them (as do I, both as a mom and teacher).  My little boy who is now 3 learned his colors, shapes, letter names and sounds (sounds from Leap Frog Letter Factory which I also highly recommend), before he was two thanks to these videos.  My little girl, who is now a year in a half, also knows all her shapes, colors, and letter names.  Now of course as a teacher I do reinforce what they watch with some work at home, but I pretty much do that with anything they watch on t.v.  These videos are colorful, repetitive but not boring, sound clear, and are fun to watch.
You can reinforce what they are learning from these videos, simply by purchasing some foam rectangles (the ones used for crafty stuff) and cutting them out in the various shapes (use black for the shapes so as to not confuse the little ones with colors, although later on you can make the shapes in colors), colors, & abc's.  We have these all over the house but they especially like to play with them during bath time.",1194652800,,1638,4.295454545454546

My older son keeps asking for it to be played and loves the cute characters, but more importantly he learned all 7 shapes after watching this video just a few times.

What they are is repetitive- which is what little minds need. These DVDs use bright colors, various pitches and intonation, and fun images to make what is seemingly banal super fun!

Do yourself a favor and buy the whole set. My son knew all of the shapes after only watching this a few times. Not to mention it is much more tolerable than Mickey Mouse! If my son is going to spend time in front of the tv, I can't think of a better thing to watch than this. ",1501372800,,713,4.220588235294118

8098876,4,B000CFX4DS,"There's no doubt that these videos can get a little mind-numbing for adults, but this is a wonderful series for little ones. My daughter wanted to watch them constantly starting at about 14 months old until she was 2, which was actually a lifesaver for me as I was modified bedrest with my second pregnancy. She still requests them time and again (she's almost 3 now), and I have no doubt that they really helped her identify her colors, letters, numbers and shapes (all of which are old hat to her now).

""Meet the Shapes"" is probably her least favorite of the bunch for whatever reason. She loves talking about shapes and pointing shapes out but she never really enjoyed this video as much as the others. Despite that, I am still giving four stars and highly recommend all the videos in this series because it's likely a matter of taste as to why she didn't connect with this one.",1489104000,,882,4.5125
