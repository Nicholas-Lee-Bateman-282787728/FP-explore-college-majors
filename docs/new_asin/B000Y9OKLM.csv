But anyway...
An absolute MUST HAVE for any fan of Macross--the original, that is (since which there've been more sequels and spin offs than the mind can comfortably conceive), this half-hour video is a sequel, of sorts, to Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love, the theatrical remake of the TV series (perhaps best known here as The Macross Saga, the first 'chapter' of Robotech), in the form of a music video collection featuring several songs by the series' popular aidoru Lynn Minmay (Mari Iijima; Macross was her first and only seiyuu work, till she was hired to reprise her Minmay role for ADV Film's release of the series), mostly employing a mixture of TV & movie clips; the highlight is the final video, featuring all new animation depicting a post-movie Minmay concert (originally shot to be shown under the movie end titles, which for some reason was not done, though a few clips appear in the first few minutes of the ED in the Perfect Edition DVD, available on Amazon) of the ED song, 'Angels' Paints', with scenes of post-movie events. (Wow! compound sentence much?)
There's also a video of the movie's climactic battle theme, 'Love, Do You Remember' (Ai Oboete Imasu Ka), and the TV songs (also used in the film of course) include 'My Boy Friend's a Pilot', 'OG (zero G)-Love' and 'Silver Moon, Red Moon'; over the end titles is the TV ED song 'Running', as a duet by original vocalist Makoto Fujiwara and Ms. Iijima.
There's also a nice booklet, with a brief piece on the film, and a slew of screen shots and black & white and color production art for the new animation--
Well, sorry, this is getting a bit long, ain't it?
The only rub is, being an import, it's region 2, and there's no song lyric subs.  And it's kinda pricey for a half-hour vid, but what the heck.
And that's finally that, I guess.
