8271586,4,B001927C8G,Who doesn't love Elmo? The first Elmo dvd I ever bought was for potty training and I think I loved it more than my daughter. Love the Earth didn't disappoint either. It's a cute addition to any Elmo library.,1432598400,,207,4.333333333333333
8271587,5,B001927C8G,"Placing your child in front of television for any extended duration of time is never a good thing especially within the first five years of their lives,  Although if you or your significant others need a brief reprieve then this is the video to give you the time to recover your energy.",1401062400,,286,4.5
8271588,2,B001927C8G,"Bought this one for car rides.  It's pretty terrible.  At least three of the characters have major speech impediments.  I'm trying to teach my daughter to speak the right way, not with an impediment.  When the character says ""artistic"" and it sounds like ""autistic"" I nearly lose it.

Some of the animation clips are terrible.  Old stuff, colored pencil animations.  The music is fairly terrible.  I wish there was more Elmo or more of the regular Sesame Street characters, not these squirrels and bears.

Now here's where I'm nitpicky:  The message is to ""reuse or recycle.""  The video goes on to point out how a woman is very crafty because she reuses an old box and pot and makes a stove out of it.  There's other examples.  However, these aren't truly examples of people conserving.  They're examples of poor people who have dug up enough garbage to create something that resembles a stovetop.  It's not people ""reusing"" or ""recycling.""  It's poor people using garbage for the first time because they can't afford anything else.

The park ranger is a bit too 'hood for me.  What's up with everything taking place in the inner city?  Even the park scenes?  The kids are weird.  Half of them are in their best 1980's overalls.  The other half look like little dirtbags.  Are these kids really in the same class?",1380844800,3,1313,4.712389380530974
8271589,4,B001927C8G,"In comparing both of Sesame Street's recent Elmo-Earth releases, while ""Being Green"" had a more humorous presentation, ""Love The Earth"" is more thoughtful and probably better because the messages stick.  Most parents would agree that there are many helpful lessons on either video... in fact if you look hard enough you can find them packaged on the same disc.

Whether or not this 45-minute episode on its own is worth $10 is a little harder to answer.  When my two-year-old watches Sesame Street, he pays close attention when the main characters are on the screen, but he loses interest during the interstitials... the format of the show is usually so fast-paced though that we come back to his friends often enough, and he keeps watching.  With ""Love The Earth"" they basically filmed 15 minutes of new material of Elmo and the gang, then filled the other 30 minutes with old non-Elmo segments, which are totally educational but are played two or three in a row before we get back to the main story.

I would say that many of Sesame Street's DVD releases seem to be more compilations of old material then completely new productions, and I would not be complaining if that material mostly involved the character on the front cover of the DVD.  But he's only around a third of the time, and that is kind of lame.",1284854400,3,1312,4.682608695652174
8271590,5,B001927C8G,"Only allowed one video per day, ... This was my child's favorite video for months at a time! (even though mommy would rotate the choices a bit, The child always asked for this video!)

She became my best recyle ""helper"" at a tender age of 2 or three yrs. .. Kids love to sort...

Wonderful amazing melodies and many many songs!!!! Kind of a short video, but it's so happy, who notices?",1281398400,,385,4.333333333333333
