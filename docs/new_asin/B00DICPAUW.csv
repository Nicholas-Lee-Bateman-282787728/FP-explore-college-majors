5818452,4,B00DICPAUW,"These 4 movies are filled with drama, and action. For a movie night, they keep you entertained from start to finish. 'The Haunting' grabs your attention & keeps it until the end with suspense, and unexpected twists-and-turns. The Price for the 4 Films is much less expensive, then when I paid double to see One movie on release day, that became a total disappointment. At least, we can add this to our collection & watch it on movie nights, by picking & choosing to our preferences. Entertaining & Good Price. Highly recommended!",1423008000,5,529,4.760869565217392

with impressive special effects and good cast,Original Clash of the Titans lacks the special effects the remake has ,but still good

film to watch. i would still recommend it!",1404777600,,300,4.862745098039215
