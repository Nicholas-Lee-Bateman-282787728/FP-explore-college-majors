8364519,5,B002CWKTZA,"For lovers of one of the most amazing pieces of music ever written (in my humble opinion), namely Ariel Ramirez's Misa Criolla, sung by the performer for whom the composer had in mind (Jose Carreras), this DVD is a must. Adding the visual dimension to the original release by Philips in 1987 greatly enhances one's involvement in this amazing native Argentinian Mass. The performance itself is a beautiful alternative to the Philips recording with faster pace and even more joyful involvement by all the performers. If you happen not to be Catholic, no worries; this is music worth enjoying for its own sake. I do have one criticism. The sound and video recording quality is poor. However, I would still recommend purchasing for it's once-in-a-lifetime performance by Carreras, a voice made for this music and which was never equaled again in his life.",1300492800,2,852,4.965034965034965
8364520,5,B002CWKTZA,"Jose sings this work by Ariel Ramirez with the passion he puts into all his singing. He portrays the emotions that I consider are required for this type of song. As always he portrays his professionalism but also the sensitivity needed and was an excellent choice by the composer Ariel Ramirez to sing his works.
I would recommend this DVD to anyone whether a fan of Jose Carreras or someone who just loves beautiful music. The 2nd work on the DVD is also excellent and once again Jose Carreras gives his all.",1253404800,4,509,4.543478260869565
