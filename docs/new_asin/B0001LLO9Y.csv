8014188,5,B0001LLO9Y,"This is a last look and listen to Jack Kramer in a clinic format (30 min.) by introducing 4 of the current (80s) Davis Cup players in the U.S. explaining separately the conventional ground strokes following Kramer's introductory explanation of the essential grips and Dennis Ralston demonstrating the essential footwork for ground strokes: forehand (Dick Stockton), backhand (Arthur Ashe) and the 2-handed backhand demonstration (Tom Gorman with Bjorn Borg and Chris Evert footage). What is left unsaid by these champions is how critical proper weight shifting is to the longevity of the tennis player. In the 90s tennis authorities tossed out conventional strokes to favor the power of two-handed play. One caveat: there is risk of injury over time to wrist, elbow or knee in two-handed play, forfeiting speed for power in players beyond age 28. The companion video to this concerns advanced play.",1422057600,,898,5.243055555555555
