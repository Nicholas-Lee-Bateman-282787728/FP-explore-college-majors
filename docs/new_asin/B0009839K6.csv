8058317,5,B0009839K6,"I saw this movie when it first came out, about 20 years ago.  It's one of my favorite movies.  I've go to a lot of trouble and searching to try to find a video.  I even bought a Zone Free DVD player so I could play this one.  But it's in French, no English subtitles.  If you know French, this is a great DVD.  I hope I can eventually get one that's been subtitled.  This movie is available on YouTube with subtitles, but the rendition is so bad it's almost impossible to see the images.",1493942400,,487,4.063157894736842
