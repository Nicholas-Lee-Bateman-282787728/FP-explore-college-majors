1117332,4,7799133104,"Yikes, Pixar gets nicked by the double-edged sword. Pixar has had such a wildly successful run of animated films, one wondered how long the streak could be sustained. I guess the uneasy murmurs first surfaced when CARS 2 was critically panned. And now here's BRAVE, and murmur, murmur, murmur. And I liked BRAVE, quite liked it. But we grade on a curve when it comes to Pixar products. And as much as I favor BRAVE, it doesn't hold up to WALL-E or UP or FINDING NEMO or the TOY STORY franchise. Any other animated studio, and odds are I would've cast a more generous eye. But Pixar's standards are so lofty... I rate BRAVE 3.5 out of 5 stars. Kids will adore this movie. The grown-ups should maybe temper expectations.

It doesn't flaunt the originality of the Pixar classics. If anything, BRAVE wanders into the more familiar territory of Pixar's corporate partner, Disney. Set in an ancient and more mystical version of Scotland, the story revolves around Merida (Kelly Macdonald), a teenaged princess who rebels against a time-honored custom. Her doting father, King Fergus (Billy Connolly), may've erred in presenting her with a bow and arrows when she was a wee lass. Today Merida is very much a tomboy and has no use for the fineries of her status. When not besieged by her mother's unending instructions on history and proper royal decorum, Merida prefers to roam the craggy landscape and practice her archery. So imagine her collosal pique when her mother informs her that, as per tradition, the time has come for her to choose from three suitors.

Maybe Pixar was going for irony when they released BRAVE only a week after Father's Day. The film's central conflict lies between Merida and her exacting mother, Queen Eleanor (Emma Thompson). After a hurtful argument with her mom, Merida flees into the dark woods and stumbles onto a sketchy cottage in the wilds. In the cottage she finds a woodcarving old hag (Julie Walters), except does a woodcarver's home routinely feature a surprisingly mobile broom and a creepy talking bird? Merida is desperate to change her fate. The ""woodcarver"" has got something for her.

Beware the deal with the devil, the wish granted by the genie of the lamp, and the witch's spell. These never come out right for us foolish mortals. Merida's bargain leaves dreadful repercussions, and it's a bit frustrating that Merida repeatedly refuses to acknowledge any blame. The plot twist, the fallout to Merida's waywardness, is pretty unexpected - unless you knew the film's original title (which I won't mention). But, ugh... I think what follows underscores some folks' big quibble, which is that the film fails somewhat to deliver on the storytelling. As mentioned, this wouldn't be as telling if BRAVE had come out from other studios. But Pixar pictures are celebrated for their cleverness and inventiveness and rich emotional beats. BRAVE, compared to its predecessors (excepting CARS 2), presents a relatively uninspired narrative.

I wonder what effect director Brenda Chapman's being replaced had on the film? Because, ultimately, not everything comes together for this film, and this so is unlike Pixar. There are darker, scarier moments in the film which are then offset by a brawny and obvious form of levity. Aside from Merida and Queen Eleanor's depiction, characterization for the cast is doled out in broad strokes. Not to say that I didn't like the cast. King Fergus and the triplet scamps are all endearing as hell, but they're there mostly for comic relief. But if you thought the plot thread with the three hapless suitors is going somewhere, no, it fizzles out. The visiting members of the various clans are stereotyped to the kilt. So brace up for a steady diet of spit takes, brawling, carousing, and mooning (yes, mooning). Billy Connolly, Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd, and Craig Ferguson as the four contentious Scottish lairds are admittedly great fun. Again, I wish they'd been developed more.

I know I've bagged on it, but I do recommend BRAVE. The visuals are sublime, and I'm sure it's no coincidence that your eyes are immediately drawn to Merida's fiery, untamed hair. Merida's tresses are so meticulously animated that Rapunzel's hair is gnashing its teeth (to mangle a metaphor). The Scottish Highlands are rendered in grand and panoramic detail. I love the design of the characters, the animators having leaned toward a stylized approach rather than a realistic one. Merida has got this distinctive moon face. It separates her from the other Disney princesses. And then there's Kelly Macdonald's marvelously expressive Scottish brogue. I could listen to her talk all day.

Also setting Merida apart is her remarkable aptitude for archery. In recent months, we'd already eyeballed Katniss Everdeen and the Avengers' Hawkeye. Merida's marksmanship rivals that of those two. There's a gratifying scene in which she Robin Hoods her way thru an archery competition, but then gets chewed out by her mum for her trouble. Yeah, Merida sometimes comes across as a brat, but you never doubt that her heart is in the right place. You never doubt that this family loves each other to pieces. Were you concerned that Merida won't be able to reverse the calamitous spell before the second sunrise deadline? Me neither. Ah, but will she own up to her bad behavior? Um...

I don't recommend viewing this in the 3D version, by the way. You just can't see anything during the night sequences, and there are heaps of night sequences. Also, you're in for a treat with the captivating animated short LA LUNA, which precedes the feature film. In it, a little boy learns the secret family business, which is awesome.",1340496000,4,5664,4.962065331928345
1117333,5,7799133104,"Brave portrays the powerful story about the difficulties a young woman named Merida has between following tradition and family expectations versus following her heart. Merida is strongwilled like her mother and they come to a confrontation regarding her betrothal. Carving a path that both may agree to is the heart of Brave. Merida learns that actions have consequences and may require equally brave actions to mend the strong bond of family.

1117336,2,7799133104,"The animation was gorgeous, the music was haunting, and the humor was fabulous. The problem was the story. I do realize we're talking about Disney here, but C'mon, this was primitive and primeval even for the Magic Kingdom.

I'll sum up the story (SPOILER ALERT):

A rebellious girl is being forced to succumb to an arranged marriage so that her clan can remain allies with the other clans. She doesn't like it and rebels. What happens to girls who refuse to be treated like chattel? Why, their mothers get turned into bears, of course. Fitting punishment, and an excellent message to send to your daughters. And who facilitates the transformation of the mother into a mean and horrible beast, by the way? A ""witch"" of course: an old woman living in the forest. The vapidity of that stereotype didn't stop Disney from once again using it shamelessly.

So, how can this rebel princess straighten up and save her mother? By sewing.

I am not kidding.

By mending with a needle and thread a split she made in a tapestry. You know, by finally acting like a PROPER girl.
Then her mother is transformed back into her old self, and the men who otherwise might have been GIVEN the girl as a prize, now have agreed to court her until she loves and picks one of them (a flippant and insincere nod to women's rights). I'm sure she'll also be occasionally allowed to continue riding her horse and loosing her arrows at prescribed targets...that is, until she finally agrees to do her duty and marries one of the losers from which she has to pick. Ah, all is well.

Gimme a break.

I had hoped that Disney would finally have come up with a REAL heroine for a story, but instead it's just another thinly-veiled lesson in Christian patriarchy and female obedience.

2 stars for the positive points (animation, music, humor, scenery, imagination), and I certainly won't keep my daughter from watching it, but we're going to have a talk first about forced marriage and reasonable gender roles, and whether or not being old and living alone actually means a woman is evil and dishonest.",1340323200,21,2068,4.662087912087912

1117338,3,7799133104,"MOVIE REVIEW #39: "" Brave ""

I never thought I would ever write a review about a Pixar film like this one. It probably works better on the small screen (Blu Ray/DVD) but Disney's/Pixar release of director Brenda Chapman's (The Prince of Egypt) film Brave was a little more than disappointing.  I can see why this took 5 years to make and was pushed back with its release date two times.

Beautifully looking and deeply rich in Celtic culture it really lacks the full spectrum of the movie by grabbing you in the beginning and holding you. It's a mother and daughter film definitely and the best scenes are really only with them together. It does have a lush score by Patrick Doyle (Hamlet, Thor) - but even that didn't carry the film for me. Again it was made for 3-D - which it didn't really need - I think the glasses took away from the detail and majesty of the colors, textures and all the scenery itself in the film. (Just another attempt to charge more ticket prices at the box office, in my opinion..)

The story to me was a little simple and took a long while to get to the real `heart' of the film. It's about Merida, (Voiced by Kelly Macdonald of Boardwalk Empire and No Country For Old Men) who is a skilled archer and impetuous daughter of King Fergus (Voiced by Billy Connolly of The Last Samurai and Lemony Snickets) and - the one she conflicts with most, her mother Queen Elinor (Voiced by Emma Thompson of Nanny McPhee and Love Actually).

 Determined to carve her own path in life, Merida defies an age-old custom sacred to the uproarious lords of the land - Betrothal: with - the overly massive Lord MacGuffin (Voiced by Kevin Mckidd of Trainspotting and Kingdom of Heaven), the hugely surly Lord Macintosh (Voiced by Craig Ferguson of How To Train Your Dragon and Winnie The Pooh)  and cantankerous Lord Dingwall (Voiced by Robbie Coltrane of Harry Potter and Goldeneye).

Merida's actions inadvertently unleash chaos and fury in the kingdom, - as well as creating a huge riff in her relationship with her mother - and when she mistakenly turns to an eccentric old Witch for help, (Voiced by Julie Walters of Harry Potter and Mama Mia!), she is granted a strange wish to `change' her mother. A wish she later learns to regret and make the entire kingdom threaten her mother in a very mortal way. The ensuing peril forces Merida to harness all of her skills and resources -- including her clever and mischievous triplet brothers -- to undo a beastly curse before it's too late. She does this by learning how and summoning up her own Bravery!

Those three brothers end up being a VERY minor comic relief for the film. They could have done so much more with them, but the few scenes they had were `slapsticky' and quick with wit and humor - but not much.

Sounds great to hear story-wise- but to me the execution of the script was slow and the dialogue a little garbled due to the thick Celtic dialects overlapping a lot of the time. The screenplay written by Marc Andrews (John Carter) , Steve Purcell (Cars), Brenda Chapman (Cars, Beauty and the Beast) and Irene Mecci (Annie, Hercules) and need more heart and continuity to me.

The best scenes were always between Merida and her mother. Whether happy, arguing or dealing with a `change' - they were spot on! An extremely tear jerking moment is when her mother, in another form, realizes what's important to both her and her daughter and has to communicate this `change' to her daughter in a most unconventional, funny and heartfelt way!

Definitely a good film for the younger audiences and a family film - but  I definitely got the reaction/impression that it is geared more toward the female crowd (with a little action and a little violence thrown in for the men) and as such suffered the continuity and balance for a general audience. I think it was trying to be the female version of Finding Nemo. But it won't hold a candle to that classic Pixar film!

I wanted to enjoy it more....but it didn't have the Pixar heart I am so used and was excited and hoping to see again in a Pixar film. I am sure when I get the Bu Ray/DVD - it will work better. Some films work better on the small screen - this one needed a lot of help on the big one for me.",1339891200,15,4219,4.4765625
1117339,5,7799133104,"This is one of the best haitian movies I've seen. Great acting, great editing, it flows from one scene to another. You can tell this was made by professionals not amatures.

1117479,3,7799133104,"Great animation, but as far as the story goes, it fails on multiple levels. Nearly every character except for the mom and daughter is a one dimensional goofball who wants to fight, so the viewer loses interest pretty quickly. With everyone playing someone who shouldn't be taken seriously, there is nothing at stake, so any danger they might find themselves in is boring.

Are there original songs in the movie? Yes, but none of the characters sing them. They are just played in the background and are not very memorable.

Now on to the title, Brave. There is very little bravery shown in the film.

**** Spoiler Alert ****

Does the main character do a lot of brave things? No she doesn't. She turns her mom into a bear and then spends the entire movie hiding the bear from her dad. With a title like Brave and a feisty female protagonist, the movie had potential for the young woman to do something extraordinary and they wasted that plot on a tale of regret.

The only saving grace is that the animation is one of the best Pixar has ever produced. The detail is truly amazing. This is the era of Pixar when they were focused on hair and it shows.

In conclusion, watch the movie for the animation because you really won't find much value in the script.",1524096000,,1255,4.482456140350878

But anyway my point is that's the lesson learned from this movie. TWO THUMBS WAY UP FROM ME!!!!! GO SEE IT NOW IF YOU HAVE NEVER WATCHED IT.",1515283200,2,455,4.428571428571429

The girl disobeys her parents, embarrases her mom in front of everyone then finds a witch to punish her mom because she doesnt get her way. Yes the girl tries and makes everything right again and learns her lesson along the way but not without a lot of heartache. I know people make mistakes but I did not like the lack of respect this movie portrade.",1512345600,2,520,4.371134020618556

I liked that she wanted to be true to who she really was, but her interest in archery was rather aimless and so was her drifting off to follow some little blue lights instead of finding her own way out of the marriage situation. But the Scottish setting was wonderful. The castle, the hills, the beautiful soundtrackseriously, you should get this for the soundtrack alone.

OK seriously. The animation is top notch. The stylized and compelling use of shape and color for the characters, the graceful gesture and action, and the gorgeous scenery are all really what you would expect from Disney in top form. A pleasure to look at.

The story is delightful, funny and light-hearted. I love the premise of a princess fiercely defending her independence and the conflict between freedom and duty that arises.",1492214400,5,511,4.930232558139535

The story applies universally and timelessly among families, whether mother-daughter or father-son. There is one part that stuck out to my children as a 5 and 7 year old that they still remember two years later: a clan chief mooning another clan chief. There is magic used as there is in many folk lores. But there are few Disney movies that don't, I guess.",1487030400,,474,4.654761904761905

1118858,5,7799133104,"I absolutely love this movie.  It is one of my favorite by Disney and Merida may very well be my favorite princess.  She a is a feisty young woman who makes a rash decision.  However, she learns from her mistake, corrects it and changes her kingdom (for the better, we think) in the end.  Many other characters are also memorable.  Her cute little brothers, her Dad, who loves her but clearly is not sure what to do with her and her mother, who loves her and is trying to do what she feels is best.  They have a typical teenage daughter/mother relationship that blossoms as this story unfolds.  I love the imagery of Merida's time and place.  Her flaming red hair is definitely a symbol of her personality and determination.",1482710400,,724,4.515384615384615

1118862,2,7799133104,"I love princess movies, but this had to be one of the worst, most boring ones I've seen. It couldn't hold my interest for ten minutes. I've never watched a princess movie that was that awful.
First of all, we've all seen a million movies about princesses who rebel because they want to marry / don't want to marry someone and their parents or the patriarchy doesn't approve. Yes, this time, it's about a girl and her mom, and this time she chooses not to marry at all, but honestly, that doesn't lessen the clicheness. The only ones who really care about the ""novelty"" in that it's about a girl and her mom, and that this time she chooses not to marry at all, are people who are watching it for political validation, not entertainment. Disney might not have released a movie about a girl who chooses not to marry before Brave, or a girl who defies her mom instead of the patriarchy, but we've all read these plots in stories a million times. Merida doesn't want to marry because she'd rather ride through the forest and shoot arrows. She beats all of her suitors (who happen to be knuckleheaded oafs down to the last) at archery to prove she's shooting for her own hand, gets into a fight with her mom, then rides off to get enchanted cakes from a sorceress so she can feed them to her mom to change her. Her mom eats them and gets sick, but Merida, though she can see how ill she's getting, trails her gleefully, focused only on whether or not she's changed her mind about the planned arranged marriage. When her mom turns into a bear, she shows no horror or remorse and very little concern for her mom, but is only worried about how much trouble she'll get into. The dad was a henpecked overgrown child, the kids were annoying, and I pretty much stopped paying any attention to the movie after a while up until the end, where she FINALLY starts sobbing over what she's done and her mom comes back to life just like that. I was like, ""Is this it? This is all?"" I hardly felt like I'd watched a movie at all. I can't think of a more pointless and stupid film. Its morals are incoherent and all over the place and it makes no sense.",1482364800,,2131,4.33

So I went out of the box and rented a kid's movie.  I'm of Scottish descent, so why not.  I loved it. Just loved it.

Once upon a time I owned every Disney VHS there was, and then, well, VHS was a thing of the past (can you imagine!!!?) and my final ability to play my beloved movies broke for the umpteenth time and I just couldn't justify fixing it again. I tried converting them to DVD or digital media, but no go--I finally just gave them away and am in the process of rebuilding my collection. For any body who hasn't seen Brave (is there really anybody out there who hasn't?) this is a wonderful movie with a positive message that you will remember years down the road. But underneath it all, there is an endearing story that has earned this movie its' place in the ""Classic"" hall of fame.

Amazon Digital is wonderful--it's nice to have this movie there in my forever library so I can watch it whenever and wherever I wish. The process was simple--press buy and viola! It showed up in my library.",1475366400,,907,4.425149700598802

leader by birth and take's extreme measures to make sure this doesn't happen. Because spoiled or something?

As an adult, watching this CG story unfold, whether I wanted to or not, I found myself reflecting on actions I took
when I was a young adult. Even so, I also found myself going ""Dangit, why are you such idiots!?"" And that was directed
toward the main character and her mother. Her mother should have turned into a chicken as much a she ""henpecked'.. I'm
surprised Pixar didn't do an alternate tale where that happened honestly.

All it would have taken, is for the mother to back up a bit, and quit being so overbearing, and the daughter to just cool
her jets and focus. Of course, we wouldn't have had such a adventurous tale wove then?

Long story short. This is by far one of my favorite Pixar works. It ranks up there with ""How to train your dragon"" in its ability to
stick with me.",1470614400,,987,4.412087912087912

Some scenes were intense for my older child, however not so much that we needed to stop watching. Specifically the scenes toward the end with the dramatic climax of the plot proved to be particularly frightening. The plot is excellent and engaging for adults and children of all ages. Merida is a heroin following her own path, the plot focused closely on her story and personal development, rather than leading into romance which was an excellent change of pace. The story of Merida should encourage everyone, a true feel good film.",1459900800,,655,4.655172413793103

This is something I surely would love for my daughter to be interested in. It really teaches girls to be who they are, be strong and also that not everything is set in stone. That you can indeed, ""change your fate"". It really bonds mother and daughter relationships as well which is what young women need now.

I like that it's entertaining for adults as well as kids, and I feel like it has a pretty good message to it. But just be ware that there are some parts that are kind frightening to young children.

For the discs themselves, I don't personally own a 3d player, so I can't comment on that at all. But I LOVE that this has so many options from dvd, to bluray, to digital copy. Which is awesome for us, since the bluray player is in the house, the dvd player is in the minivan and the digital copy is on the ipad. Lots of options!",1456963200,,655,3.962121212121212

1121242,5,7799133104,"This is my #2 all time favorite animated movie (How to train your dragon being #1). This movie is very well animated and the voice acting is great. It's not your everyday 'princess movie' where boy meets girl, they fall in love etc... I know that some parents don't want to expose young children to that sort of thing too early.

It has action, adventure and lessons in taking responsibility for your own actions and making it right. The comedic parts of the movie are great and it has moments of character revelations and a message of family togetherness and mutual respect. There is a scary bear in the story and some short fighting scenes but nothing that I would call graphic. For real young kids the parent should watch it first to see if they think it will cause nightmares.",1450828800,,780,4.531914893617022

1121393,3,7799133104,"Seems too much like a re-tread of Brother Bear, but give them a break, at least they did it right. The problem I have is one that keeps cropping up with the Disney princess movies: weird feminists ideas. I believe I've mentioned it before and may have even started a thread on it. Female roles are presented as limiting to women, but realistically, males roles are limiting just as well. Any road you take makes you miss the other roads at the fork. It's just a part of life and should not be seen as a 'bad' thing. Now, if you wanna make it an indictment against arranged marriages, fine. So be it. But who in Western Culture really has to deal with that? These movies don't need to deal with safe, bland ideas.

Also, if you wanna present injustice and limitations to freedom, why make the character a Princess, someone who will, no matter what, lead a privileged life? The Tale of Desperaux, as unpleasant as it was, at least bothered to show is that the true absence of liberty comes from poverty and other physical, emotional & mental limitations which are pretty much out of the control of the individual.

I'm not cracking on the film itself. The film is a fine, competent effort (outstanding, lovely, design and overt influences of Melville are apparent.)  But this film making by committee limits the revealing psychological aspects or any insights on Life of the final result.

I just saw A Taste of Tea again. Something like that particular individual artistic achievement could with much difficulty be produced by a Pixar-like committee: only when an individual vision is pursued do they achieve greatness. Paradoxically Tea deals with individual artists of varying talents, some of whom produce flawed, commercial or derivative work. For example, the animator produces a very non-personal, superhero Anime fight sequence, and yet addresses that the true joy is in the moments of artistic creation and not necessarily related to the quality of the work produced. ...Or check out the ""Mountain"" music video... Much of the same, and yet clearly not missing in joyfulness.",1448236800,2,2081,4.853521126760564

1121977,4,7799133104,"So, this is the modern fairy tale? The damsel in distress being rescued by Prince Charming formula is old school. Instead we have an independent, head strong female who doesn't want to be told what to do. She enlists the aid of a witch to get her own way. It turns out disastrously, but all is well that ends well.

I think it's a tale for millennials. ""Deny your parents and authority, follow your own path, and you will find happiness."" It's a 180 from the ""wait to be rescued by a handsome man."" Neither is a balanced message. Just look at all the unhappiness, loneliness, and selfishness in the world and you will see that this doesn't work either.

Anyway, as a cute movie for kids, it works. It is fresh and entertaining. Not sure if ""Brave"" is an appropriate title, but it's an okay movie.",1440115200,,796,4.408163265306122

It turned out to be something totally different from my own perceptions I had on the film, my own fantasy about Girl being Brave set in a Celtic(Druid) world....

and and...Ok It's good movie, it's a good movie from the family and for the mother and daughter.  It's very closed and the script is again like all Pixar films unintelligent.

There is even a scene in the film that is exactly like another scene in another film staring a Dog by another animation company, with the same strum style guitar and song!  How in the@#$#@@!

This is Pixar a company that worships Miyazaki the Legend!  And yet there films lack everything that
Miyazaki is famous for.  Pixar you need to Grow Up!

What could have been?  Brave a film about girl that rebels against her Royal duties and get's lost in the woods only to unleash the old God's, the Old world of the forest.

No it's Brave, a silly comical story about girl who resorts to the extreme, but by doing so becomes closer to her mother.

1122199,5,7799133104,"You just have to be Brave enough to see it.  And maybe cast aside the spears and arrows of critics.  Why do people put this movie down as a ""girls"" story?  Or a Disney princess story?  Or say ""While this isn't one of Pixar's finest..""  What malarkey!  It is one of Pixar's finest.  I wonder if the reviewers have fully grasped the horrible implications of goings-on in this film.  They are horrifying indeed.

This is hands-down Pixar's darkest film yet.  If it weren't for the comedy this would be a horror story or a story of 10th-century war.  Last night, I realized this is a Dark Comedy.  Very dark.  And not just in terms of theme -- it's visually dark, as well -- which only makes Merida stand out like a bright flame in a dark alley.  At the same time, this movie is laden with human touches.  But that dark side this movie has can show without notice.

Spoilers ahead.  Read at your own risk.

Why is it Pixar's darkest?

Consider this:

1. A 5-ish year old little girl sees a giant, cursed bear attack her and her family.  The outcome is grim, and she is implied to have seen it happen.
2. An entire kingdom is laid to ruin, with vivid, visible evidence.. everywhere.. that it was an epic massacre, war, perhaps.  Nothing subtle about it.
3. No-holds barred, often fiercely feral combat with hand to hand and with edged weapons, arrows and spears.
4. Choices made often carry severe consequences, for-keeps.  No backsies.  No reset button.

It is also possibly Pixar's most beautiful film yet.  It's not so much an animated cartoon, but an animated Rembrandt painting.  It has that glowing quality.  While it is dark most of the time - except for Merida's torch-like mane - it glistens with vividness.  Nature is rendered with such loving beauty it remains with the viewer long after the stinger at the end of the credits fades.

And the music.. oh my lord, the music on this movie.  It can, on its own, bring tears.  This film took an Academy Award for sound, and if the viewer has a proper home theater, the result is enough to pull you into the film, put you in the Highlands.

I would like to think as Time, the Ultimate Critic passes, Brave will stand among the Pixar movies people of today consider great.

Myself, I think it already does.",1436572800,22,2255,4.472906403940887

1122268,3,7799133104,"Pixar set a high standard with the Toy Storys, WALL*E, and Finding Nemo (among others). These are kid films adults can enjoy and that tightrope is one few films ever make across. Unfortunately, Pixar is in a funk since the late 2000s and Brave (definitely lesser Pixar) will not pull the company out of the doldrums. Yet, this reviewer keeps faith in a Pixar revival; they're too talented over there not to. Brave scores points for its sheer beauty as a moving picture with misty, medieval Scotland as the setting. Moss, stone, and skin looks very real. Brave also scores points for authenticity. The main voice actors are Scottish, so the accents are real. Alas, the plot is a thinly-veiled, copy-and-paste job of Beauty and the Beast and the heroine, Merida, comes off as quite spoiled, rather than strong-willed. In classic teenage tradition, Merida fails to honor her father and, especially, her mother. [Explaining how would unnecessarily reveal plot points] This failure brings on the last fatal error of Brave: lack of a villain. Pride, not evil, sets the conflict for the film and the conflict is mostly lightweight and weak in execution. If you're going to make a princess movie (more classic Disney than Pixar specialty) then a nasty villain (think Jafar) may of drove the film's moral point home more solidly. Final verdict: worthwhile and family friendly, but nothing special (unfortunately).",1435795200,,1404,5.030042918454936

1122553,4,7799133104,"A couple years back, the calls began for Pixar to have a female lead in a movie, and I began to roll my eyes.  As the calls got louder over the last couple of years, I rolled them more.  But Pixar answered back with Brave, and movie that will appeal to both boys and girls.

Merida (voiced by Kelly MacDonald) has been trained all her life by her mother Elinor (Emma Thompson) to take her proper place.  See, Merida is a princess in one of the clans in middle ages Scotland, and she must act properly and take a husband at the proper time.

That time is now, and her father Fergus (Billy Connolly) has called a gathering of the other clans.  There is to be a contest, and the winner will become betrothed to Merida.  But Merida enjoys her freedom and being outdoors.  Can she find a way to change her fate?

Now if you are worried that the previews give away too much know that they dofrom the first act.  Everything I've seen in previews (and I think I've seen most of them) took place early on in the film, and when it really got going, it shot off in an unexpected direction.

That's not to say I couldn't figure out the big brushes of the project early on.  But I was still caught up in the story, even as I was a step or two ahead of the where the plot actually was.

Merida and Elinor are really the main characters here, and their journey is compelling because they are so well fleshed out.  I truly came to care for them.  The rest of the cast are the supporting players, and they do a great job of it.

I enjoyed the Scottish accents of the supporting cast.  I never had a hard time understanding them (well, except for one character, but that's the joke with him).  And everyone does a great job bringing their characters to life.

It goes without saying, but the animation is gorgeous.  While other studios make fun computer animated films, no one does it with the artistry that Pixar does.  The scenery is just gorgeous.

The film is rated PG, and parents should pay attention to that.  I'd definitely say it is for older kids and up.  There are a few scenes of humor revolving around what men do and don't wear under their kilts, including one of brief rear end nudity.  Frankly, I thought those scenes were pretty funny.  More worrisome for parents are several scary scenes involving bears.  I hear a couple little kids leaving the theater where I saw it talking about how scary it was.  You know your child best, so judge accordingly.

While this movie does star a princess and have some elements of magic to it, it is certainly a story that will entertain both boys and girls.  It has lots of action in the story, and Merida is quite the tomboy.

And definitely stay through the credits.  There is a fun final scene at the very end you'll appreciate.

For me, this is in the second tier of Pixar films, and it took me a while to put my finger on why.  I think it's the story.  Yes, predictable stories aren't necessarily deal killers, but I think I usually expect more from Pixar.  From any other studio, I would have loved this one, but Pixar has set the bar so high for themselves that this becomes a lesser entry.

But by all means go and see it.  Brave is a bit of a more serious movie from Pixar, but it is still enjoyable.  I think they have another hit on their hands.",1433116800,,3291,4.2808441558441555

1122696,5,7799133104,"This awesome film changed my life.  I love every element.  The animation is awesome.  The story is fantastic.  I was most attracted to the fact that Disney created such a strong woman figure.  NO ONE messes with Merida!  Her triplet brothers joyfully steal the show on several occasions.  It's delightful!

There is a special place in my heart for the witch.  She's awesome.  They did their research.  Wiccans never conjure where they carve!

And, the sub plot with the wisps, and how they guide the film through is genius.

The counterpoint with Mordu is an ever-present threat.  The plot point of him also being a family member, and the story that goes along with that is precious.

Patrick Doyle's Scottish inspired soundtrack fits perfectly.

Disney really does need to put their differences aside with Brenda Chapman, and let her back in the director's chair.  I'm not sure if we are going to see any film that is the epic likes of Brave again, anytime soon.

It's well worth the 1 hour and 42 minutes of your life.  Go see it!

Determined to make her own path in life, Princess Merida defies a custom that brings chaos to her kingdom. Can she undo a beastly curse?

What did I think?

For a movie featuring archery, its ironic that Brave doesnt quite hit the mark. Its a little predictable and oddly two-dimensional  very strange for a PIXAR offering. The characters are rich, the scenery is stunning, but the story just lacks depth and any lasting connection.

Im not sure whether its because the movie has had so many problems with re-writes and re-workings or Disney interfered to make it a safe movie, but Brave is a solid movie without the usual PIXAR magic.",1431648000,2,652,4.684210526315789

But of all of the Viking nation. And this movie gives us a good example of what Vikings upheld and how it might have been for some when the challenge was too great and for some when the challenge became legend. It also shows us an example of the place of highborn women in the Viking nation. There are those that did become warriors and for lowborns this was accepted, but in highborns it was not. And  that's where this movie begins. With a young princess, not fitting the mold her mother wants her to fit into, and the princess wanting to be something she is not born to be.... I'll let you watch the movie to see what happens and how these to come to an agreement that is acceptable for both of them and the journey that got them there. I highly recommend it to any age.

There were scenes of fish jumping upstream over rapids that were quite lifelike.

The values of the characters are pretty good and there isn't much objectionable dialog or actions  in the movie. Other than the stereo-typing of the Irish/Scottish peoples. But it is not a mean spirited stereotype and isn't objectionable to most Irish/Scottish people.
It's worth having for the kids to enjoy and likely will be watched for many years to come.",1428624000,,500,4.882352941176471

When she's approached by her mother who tells her she needs to choose a husband, Marida is not happy with the prospect at all. While in the surrounding woods, she comes upon a witch; she asks the witch to help her ""change my fate"". What follows is a darling story about being careful what you wish for.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, which included numerous touches that added to my enjoyment and gave me many reasons for wanting to see it again and again.
It is a story for all ages with just a few semi scary scenes. I chose to purchase the DVD so I can see it again. I highly recommend it.",1427932800,,805,4.402684563758389

1124144,3,7799133104,"From the trailers this movie looked intriguing. After seeing it I was left thinking ""Hmm. It could have been a lot better.""

With Brave I think Disney made the mistake by trying to make it be too much. Unlike Tangled, Brave had awkward amounts of drama, humor, singing and action. The story was unique but perhaps it was a bit too unique and the simple magic that makes a Disneyesque movie was lost somewhere. Because the writers lost that balance in the script the movie was not as ""magical"" as it could have been.

I didn't find this movie all that good but the animation was stellar. So, if you can watch a movie without caring for the story than you'll do alright with Brave.",1424390400,,679,4.424

1124616,5,7799133104,"I think this movie is outstanding because it teaches a lesson rarely taught these days.  I saw that someone else had hailed this movie as good because it teaches that a woman doesn't have to get married and that we can take our fate into our own hands.  I disagree that that is the central message of the film.  In fact, I think that is extremely short-sighted and (dare I say) self-indulgent.  I think the movie is about exactly what the witch said.  MEND THE BOND TORN BY PRIDE.  How many times in the bible does Jesus warn against pride?  It is the root of all sin.  Even during Merida's big speech, she admitted that she had been selfish (another clue).  The mother bear would not turn back into Elinor until Merida humbled herself, admitted her fault and apologized.  What would this world be if all people would be quick to do that?  This movie teaches an important lesson about HUMILITY and the danger of pride.  It also teaches the importance of family and peacekeeping.  The marriage piece was irrelevant.  This was about a parent and a child making amends and correcting the damage caused by anger, pride and rebellion.  Bravo Brave!",1422576000,,1143,4.589108910891089

1124619,5,7799133104,"I'm reviewing the substance of the movie, not the DVD quality, Amazon service, streaming speed, etc. Terrific movie, and here's why (without giving away too much):
1. Animation is great, down to every last detail.
2. Story is original, folks! Not like other Disney movies -- Snow White (Brothers Grimm), LIttle Mermaid (Hans Christian Andersen), Tangled (story of Rapunzel reprised), Cinderella (Brothers Grimm again), Frozen (Hans Christian Andersen again (The Snow Queen)), and on and on. What a creative, different, but entirely believable story, with both serious and funny moments, and a very good message.
3. Main characters (Merida and Queen Elinor) are thoughtfully developed. Unlike traditional damsel-in-distress Disney princesses, Merida is assertive and smart and courageous. So is Queen Elinor. And their disagreement represents the quintessential challenges and complexities of mother-daughter relationships. There is no clear right or wrong -- just different perspectives between two strong willed ladies.
All that being said, I agree that it can be scary and probably inappropriate for really little kids to watch. I would say 6 yo and older is fine. But it isn't any more violent than Bambi, Finding Nemo, Snow White, Tangled or Lion King. This is not your typical happy sing-along Disney musical movie like Frozen, but I think Brave's musical scores are inspiring, authentic, haunting and beautiful. I loved just about everything in this movie, except for maybe the title. I don't expect everyone to love it too, but at least give it a chance.",1422489600,,1561,5.349593495934959

1124802,5,7799133104,At first I was hesitant to see this film because I had felt that the quality of animated features were on a decline.  Brave changed that and gave me a new respect towards the computer-animated medium.  The beauty of the subtle details and vibrant colors used make the characters fit nicely with the historical-fantasy setting.  This is a modern story that uses the spirit of Scottish traditions to create a new Celtic Legend for the enjoyment of all ages.  The strong female lead shows that everyone has the ability to grow into their own life while still honoring the feelings of their loved ones.  It is definitely a film for those seeking a true adventure.,1421366400,,659,4.695652173913044

1126147,1,7799133104,"I cannot speak to the entire movie because we just couldn't watch the whole thing! After we survived the brawl scene when all the Scots were clobbering each other, we thought it might get better. But when she cursed her own mother (!), we had to turn it off, especially with our young children there watching. My mother was in the room and asked us, shocked, ""Are you sure this movie is for kids?"" I really had to say I wasn't sure. There was so much incredible violence, covered up with slapstick and silliness, but violence nonetheless. I know a lot of people love the theme of a strong, wild hearted, independent heroine, but I have a different view. Though I understand why Merida was standing her ground, and agreed with her point, being disrespectful, yelling at parents, going to a witch to curse one's own mother- these are not behaviors I want my children to emulate. They aren't even behaviors I wish to exhibit myself, as an adult.",1416873600,9,942,4.579881656804734

1127174,3,7799133104,"The story gets nowhere. The girl is a gifted archer. Where does that get her in the story? Nowhere. Couldn't even kill the bear or defend her mom or anything. The plot is totally predictable, unimaginative, and unreasonable. The mother is demanding and absurd. The mother-daughter conflict never did get resolved. There is the problem of the mom becoming a bear, that had to be solved. But the mom's not approving the girl's being a tomboy, which is the whole point of the first half of the story? That's forgotten.  I can't believe Pixar came up with such a half baked plot.

Finging Nemo is about parent child conflict, but the conflict is explored and resolved. For Brave, the conflict is ignored because of the bear, and then forgotten!

But the graphics, O, the graphics! The Scottish scenery is to die for! But most importantly, the girl's curly hair bouncing around is the most amazing feat of animation I've ever seen! I watch this movie just to watch her hair bounce. I read somewhere that they wrote a special program to get her hair to bounce like that, some 300 hairs all bouncing simultaneously in individual ways. Amazing! I don't believe the art of animation will ever get better than this movie. EVER!!!

Walt Disney would have been proud!",1412208000,,1255,4.71689497716895

Merida and Queen Elinor were two strong female characters; while the men were drawn, voiced and acted like idiotic bafoons.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Chafing under the domination of her mother Queen Elinor [Emma Thompson], Princess Merida [Kelly Macdonald] isn't interested in being groomed for the throne and is definitely not ready to be betrothed to one of a trio of grisly young men from three other Scottish clans. So, she happens upon The Witch [Julie Walters] in the forest who offers her a spell-ridden cake for her mother which Princess Merida hopes will change her mothers point of view about her daughters future. But as is often the case with magic, what appears fool proof on the surface goes awry as one bite of the cake turns her mother into a bear. With the fearsome bear Mordu having bitten off her father King Ferguss [Billy Connolly] leg as a young man, Princess Merida knows bears aren't popular around the castle, so she hastens to get her mother away from the clans and hopes she can find the witch to reverse the spell. When that fails, Princess Merida and her mother find their bond becomes stronger in their common search for an answer to her dilemma, but time is running out to change her mother back as the spell becomes permanent after two days.

The story flows smoothly as we watch Princess Merida grow from a young girl to a young woman becoming a proficient archer along the way. Even with the setting of 13th century Scotland, much about the dynamics between the parents and children in the movie have a distinctly modern ring to them, and Princess Meridas recalcitrance at being forced into something shes not emotionally ready to undertake with no possibility of stating her own case will be easy to identify with for almost any audience, especially with Princess Meridas showdown with her three suitors in an archery tournament is one of the films high points. While the writers get a bit too cute with The Witchs personality in her two sequences, shes undeniably entertaining if a bit too modern to fit comfortably among these rustic warriors of old. The films production design, however, is simply jaw dropping as Scotland comes alive in these majestic, detailed CGI renderings, and the directors use their ravishing settings to stage a number of memorable sequences. The highlight of the film remains a bucolic sequence when Queen Elinor as Mum-bear learns to forage for food in a stream where gorgeous animation provides both tender moments and slapstick comedy in the best PIXAR tradition.

Kelly Macdonald is full of feisty sassiness and plenty of pluckiness for Princess Merida, and her Scottish brogue, as is the case with the other Scottish actors hired for the film, is never too thick to prevent understanding of what shes saying. Emma Thompson has a noble carriage and the gentle art of diplomacy as Queen Elinor while Billy  Connollys braying and clumsy King Fergus is always a real treat. The three Scottish clan leaders putting their sons up for selection are played in the expected extroverted manner by Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd, and Craig Ferguson. Julie Walters has all kinds of fun with the eccentric witch who moonlights as a wood carver, and bears are a specialty.

The computer animation is, of course, spectacular, with meticulous attention paid to the smallest of details. The performances are fine, too, infused with enough enthusiasm and warmth to make the characters as dimensional as the images they populate. And after a couple of sequels and there's that Disney influence once again, and it's nice to see PIXAR return to an original story that transports us to a foreign setting and simpler time, and give young girls a spunky role model they can learn from and emulate.

At 93 minutes, 'BRAVE' is one of PIXAR's shortest films, but despite its efficient storytelling, it still possesses a fair amount of depth. Though the characters it depicts may reside on a rarefied plane, the issues they confront are universal and timeless, and the ultimate message emphasizing the strong bonds of family, however trite, is presented in a poignant and effective manner. 'BRAVE' may not be as bold as its title, but it is a good solid PIXAR effort, celebrating not just girl power, but the power of understanding and mutual respect.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The films theatrical widescreen aspect ratio of 2.39:1 is faithfully rendered in this awesome 1080p encoded image. Whether in 3D or 2D, the images are breathtakingly beautiful. The details in hair, clothes, a tapestry, especially where you can see individual strands, trees, moss, stone, and other objects just defy description. Colours are bold and deeply saturated with Meridas red, red hair coming close to but never quite blooming. Black levels are rich and deep, and the image is as perfect as one should expect. As with most PIXAR 3D films, outward projections are not of primary importance to the animators though there are arrow tips and hands that reach beyond the frame for split seconds. But the sense of depth in the image is often quite staggering, and the 3D version of the film is much more interesting visually with its complex placement of people, animals, and objects within their environments which 3D exploits to the maximum.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 7.1 Dolby TrueHD sound mix is a miracle of audio design with split sound effects occupying the fronts and rears at an almost constant pace. There are pans across and through the sound field, and the rear back channels are used to make smooth transitions for sounds at the rear of the field. Patrick Doyles music and the Gaelic ballads of Julie Fowlis get remarkably fluid renderings in the fronts and rears aiding immeasurably in establishing the time and place of the action. Dialogue has been beautifully recorded and has been placed in the centre channel.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Mark Andrews, co-director Steve Purcell, Editor Nick Smith, and story supervisor Brian Larsen: All four sit down for a lively commentary that allows us to see inside the creative minds of the filmmakers. From an abandoned alternate opening and a homage to 'The Sound of Music' to character insights and scene analyses, the quartet shares a wealth of interesting information in an easy-going, accessible style. They talk about, among other things, adding fresh elements to stereotypical figures, such as princesses and witches, various concepts that never materialised, balancing comedy and dramatic intensity, managing the movie's pace, and the incredible amount of trial and error that go into making an animated film. Children may find the discussion a bit dull, but adults, especially animation fans like me, found this commentary a worthwhile time investment.

Special Feature: Pixar Short Film: La Luna [2011] [1080p] [7:00] A fable of a young boy who is coming of age in the most peculiar of circumstances. Tonight is the very first time his Papa and Grandpa are taking him to work. In an old wooden boat they row far out to sea, and with no land in sight, they stop and wait. A big surprise awaits the little boy as he discovers his family's most unusual line of work. Should he follow the example of his Papa, or his Grandpa? Will he be able to find his own way in the midst of their conflicting opinions and timeworn traditions? This exudes a subtle sense of wonder and is filled with beautiful imagery. La Luna was nominated at the 84th Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film.

Special Feature: Behind-the-Scenes [1080p] [50:00] Eight behind-the-scenes documentaries are available on the feature film disc. ""Brave Old World follows the PIXAR team on a research trip to Scotland. Merida and Elinor digs into the lead female characters with the voice cast, designers and animators. ""Bears"" should be even more self-explanatory to those who've seen the film. Brawl in the Hall looks at the development and animation of the comedic clash of the clans. Wonder Moss delves into the complex mathematical creation of the movie's background moss, something most people will take for granted. Magic dissects Brave's fairy tale roots and magical elements. Clan Pixar introduces the artists and animators, touching on their daunting task and intense efforts. And Once Upon a Scene offers a glimpse into various versions of Brave's opening, key scenes and story.

Special Feature: Fergus & Mordu: An Alternate Opening [1080p] [7:00] A cautionary fable about the pitfalls of jealousy, ambition, and forsaking one's family, this dark tale ties nicely into the plot and themes of 'BRAVE' as it charts the development of the film's scariest villain.

Special Feature Documentary: Fallen Warriors [1080p] [2:00] This montage of deleted shots and snippets celebrates the hard work that goes into even the tiniest sequences in an computer animated film.

Special Feature Documentary: Dirty Hairy People [1080p] [4:00] This piece shows how the animators stayed true to the film's time period with regard to personal hygiene and appearance. Rotted teeth, unkempt hair, and sullied clothing are a few of the challenges they faced in composing their subjects.

Special Feature Documentary: It is English . . . Sort of [1080p] [4:00] This documentary showcases the numerous Scottish actors who lent their voice talents to 'BRAVE,' and examines the various dialects they employ, as well as some of the foreign Scottish words and phrases sprinkled throughout the film.

Special Feature Documentary: Angus [1080p] [3:00] Animating a Clydesdale horse wasn't easy, and here we learn about the particulars of hair, movement, and body language and all vital components of Princess Merida's horse that needed to be subtly but accurately conveyed to the audience.

Special Feature Documentary: The Tapestry [1080p] [4:00] This piece shows us what went into animating this critical element of the 'BRAVE' story that symbolises family unity and structure. Achieving the proper texture and movement of this object required a surprising amount of research and various trials.

Special Feature Documentary: Promotional Pieces [1080p] [15:00] A collection of five fun promos and three trailers from the U.S.A, Japan, and Great Britain that comprise this section. Feast Your Eyes [4:00] is a clever, amusing, and visually dazzling sampler of 'Brave' characters and personalities; Relics [1:00] introduces us to the lovable, bumbling, comedic trio that comes to court; Clan Dun Broch [1:00] introduces us to Princess Merida's family via a vigorous swordfight with her dad; Launch [0:30] shows us Merida's archery skills and the mischievous nature of her brothers; and Flying Guts Theatre [1:00] gives us the backstory of the courtship of Queen Elinor and Fergus as acted out by their three boys.

Special Feature: Art Gallery [1080p] More than 470 images are spread across five galleries under the headings Characters [178 images]; Colour Keys [95 images]; Development Art [96 images]; Environments [65 images] and Graphics [37 images]. Different viewing methods and bookmarking capabilities allow you to somewhat tailor the viewing experience to your personal preference.

Sneak Previews: Wreck-It Ralf 3D [1080p], Monster University 3D [1080p] and Planes 3D [1080p].

Finally, PIXAR finally shows its feminine side at last with its first princess computer animated film, but 'BRAVE' is no shrinking violet. With as much muscle as its more masculine Pixar counterparts, this captivating portrait of wilful, free-thinking lass in 11th century Scotland combines action and mysticism with a relatable emotional core to produce a period piece that's refreshingly contemporary and utterly entertaining. And like all the Blu-rays in the PIXAR repertoire, this Blu-ray disc shows off the computer animated film in the best possible light. A drop-dead gorgeous video transfer, which is even more mesmerising in 3D, exceptional audio, and a wealth of supplements spread across two Blu-ray discs make 'Brave' a dazzling and memorable home theatre experience. Unlike Merida's archery skills, the film may not always hit the bulls-eye, but this 3 disc set sure does, and without question, it comes with very high praise and now it has gone pride of place in my ever increasing PIXAR Blu-ray Collection, especially the 3D versions. Highly Recommended!

1128818,1,7799133104,"This review is for the poor quality of the disc being sold at the reduced price. The one I received was a ""Disc Made in Mexico"" as stated on the outside cellophane wrap.  Most people wouldn't think twice about looking on the bottom back of the plastic wrap for this faded blue notation.  (These made in Mexico discs are everywhere, in most popular and standard shop-marts.)  If you ripped that plastic off, like all people do, you'd miss this fleeting information and be fooled to believe the ""Printed in the U.S.A"" on the back of the disc jacket pertains to the disc.  Maybe the disc jacket sheet was printed in the U.S. and the inside paper pamplets BUT NOT THE DISC.  As soon as the disc started to play in hazzy image, I knew then something was off and sure enough there on the cello-wrap was the ""Disc Made in Mexico"" stamp.  What a disappointment for the kids!

I have always had bad results with disc made in Mexico--(Two times is enough--this third, unbeknownst until I got it, was returned and I had to PAY the return postage--though Amazon said they'll refund about $4 while I paid the cheapest return postage of almost $6 for a defective product that wasn't my fault!  No cool Amazon!)  I posted in various ""Comments"" asking if anyone knew where this DVD was made but apparently no one paid attention.  There was a reason why the ""Disc Made in Mexico"" wasn't more prominently displayed on the disc jacket instead of the least paid attention to plastic wrap!

The Story IS GREAT--buy ones made in the U.S.A.--referring to the disc.  For this review the disc is the product and the product is of very poor quality for the ""Disc Made in Mexico"" price.",1407801600,10,1659,4.548821548821548

This could have been such a cute movie with an interesting princess with awesomely crazy hair who fights against the tradition of having no say in who she marries or when. It started out teasing us with the thought that she was going to prove to her parents that she was more than just a pretty face, but instead the plot descended into darkness with her paying a witch to cast a spell over her mother and turn her into a bear.  Seriously? They created this strong-willed character with mad archery skills who could have become a heroine and saved the kingdom from an invading army or something, but instead she simply cursed her mom and had to try to break the spell before it was permanent. Really? Does Disney always have to throw witchcraft into their movies?",1407024000,19,789,4.635714285714286

1129136,5,7799133104,"It is the middle ages in the highlands of Scotland where King Fergus' daughter, Merida, has lived wild and free all her young life.  She learns that her parents have decided it's time for her to marry and settle down and she flatly refuses. She and her mother have a quarrel during which Merida ruins an ancient and very valuable wall tapestry. Merida then runs to the stable, saddles her horse and gallops off to the woods where the will'o'the wisps lead her to a witch's cottage. She begs the witch to create a spell that will help her mother understand her better - and there the fun begins. I had the great good fortune to live in Scotland in the 60's and in my opinion the Pixar folks did an AMAZING job capturing the look and feel of the place by using very real locations, like Dunottar Castle, as models for locations in the film. The intelligent, true-to-life script makes me laugh - and cry - and Emma Thompson, Kelly McDonald, Billy Connolly, Robby Coltrane and the rest of the cast do a WONDERFUL job creating the other characters. And finally, Patrick Doyle's very authentic score brings the perfect finishing touch to this incredibly beautiful film about staying true to yourself no matter what the consequences.(Listen for American voice artist June Foray in a cameo as the crazy woodcrafting witch).",1406937600,,1315,4.692640692640692

This is the first Pixar movie that the story is focused on a female heroine, which is refreshing and I hope Pixar goes back to doing more movies that uses a female heroine as the main character. Despite that great point in this movie, unfortunately I have to say this is probably the weakest Pixar movie excluding cars 2. I still like the movie and it looks great in 3D, but I can see why this movie isn't held in one of the top ten favorites by most Pixar fans. There is nothing wrong with the collection, love the digital copy and bonus features.

If you deciding if it's worth owning and you don't quite love this movie, I say this one you can skip purchasing. I however can't stand missing any Pixar 3D Blu-ray movies so I bought it anyways.",1406332800,,814,4.285714285714286

What I liked about this Disney movie is that the family has both parents and the family is still ALL living at the end of the movie. This is a true family movie.  Yes they have a few problems which is the catalyst for the entire story. Merida and her mom have issues about marriage and tradition.

1130275,5,7799133104,I loved the mother-daughter and father-daughter then father-mother dynamic of this movie rather than being a typical romance - it's a real story about a girl you can imagine actually being.

Very good. Could have been a little longer, a little more deeply developed relationship with the mother and daughter before she changed form. Not sure I agree with the glorification of rebellion in teenagers, but I understand where she was coming from.

This is an amazing start to empowering women. As a little girl, I told everyone I did not want to get married. I can still remember all the responses I got about how I should want to get married.

That is all I have to say about the movie, now onto the prices. When I visited Disneyland the prices were $7 for a corn dog!!! Apparently Disney is upping up their prices for the summer season!

Advice to customers at Amazon looking for Disney movies to buy: Wait. This movie was $19.99 before, now is around $26.99! Gosh frozen was around $10 at one point including coupons! Wait for lets say a couple weeks, if they don't lower their price move onto something else which I recommend ""How To Train Your Dragon"", you'll feel the bond. 3D + 2D + DVD ""How To Train Your Dragon"" is less than $20, DVD around $10-12.

1130710,4,7799133104,"With ""Brave"", Pixar finally made their entrance into a period and fairy tale setting. After the critical and financial failure of ""Cars 2"" (which is a film that I personally enjoyed and didn't deserve the massive hate), ""Brave"" was seen as Pixar's chance of redemption. However, some Pixar fans screamed foul and thought ""Brave"" was a result of the Disneyfication of Pixar. However, although ""Brave"" wasn't seen as the definite Pixar comeback, it still was better critically and commercially received as ""Cars 2"".

The feminist aspects were also surrounding ""Brave"". It was their first film with a female lead after more than a decade of films with male leads. ""Brave"" got also some buzz of the directorial change. It was Brenda Chapman's lovechild, but she got replaced because of creative differences. Although Chapman herself has stated that her original visions of the tale was fulfilled, the replacements are barely mentioned in the special features. She still got credited as the secondary director, although one can't help to wonder if there was a bigger conflict about this story or if this conflict was enhanced by the media.

Either way, although I've always been not so fond of Pixar, they can deliver a masterpiece now and then (""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"", ""Up""). ""Brave"" does come across a one of Pixar's strongest works, but is also hampered by some flaws. And some quite obvious flaws too. Moviegoers has grown to expect more from Pixar and many of them found the film to be conventional. The marketing device also misguided the film, depicting it as a grand adventure, when it really is an intimate, character-driven story in the second half.

Where ""Brave"" really excel is with the animation and the music. The animation is stunningly gorgeous, as is the music, setting a haunting atmosphere and giving the movie a special quality. The wonderful score is by Patrick Doyle, the songs written by Alex Mandel and they work well.

""Brave"" is a departure from Pixar's previous works, not only because of it's setting, but it's scope. It definitively feels more Disney than Pixar at times, but that's doesn't necessarily hurts the film. I see nothing wrong about Pixar trying to go in Disney's territory  and make a Princes movie long you do it with class and subtlety (damn me as much as you want to, Pixar fanboys). However, I still wished that Pixar would make more realistic-looking characters for once and expand their horizons in term of character designs.

Where ""Brave"" falls flat, it's in terms of it's story. It's quite conventional, as the matter of fact too conventional. The story is trite, cliched and really not particularly well structured. The film seems more of two separate stories incorporated into one. However, despite the  story problems, ""Brave"" shall have praise for having a mother-daughter-related story in a fairy tale setting and not having a prince charming to save the day.

Another noteworthy component about ""Brave"" is the choice of having an all Scottish cast into the movie. It's easy to give Pixar some good points about that, although the Medieval Scottish would probably be not understandable for todays audiences. However, most of the voices are fine. Billy Connolly (who previously was in ""Pocahontas"") brings the warmth and joviality to King Fergus. Emma Thompson (who was in ""Treasure Planet"") brings dignity and subtlety to Queen Ellinor. Less successful is Kelly McDonald as the protagonist Merida herself, making Merida more grating and whiny than she needs to be. Otherwise, Julie Walters makes a fine witch. Steve Purcell makes a fun crow. Kevin McKidd makes a good Lord MacGuffin/Young MacGuffin. Craig Ferguson delivers some spunk to Lord Macintosh.

BONUS FEATURES
The film is filled with good bonus features. First up is a audio commentary by director Mark Andrews, co-director Steve Purcell, editor Nick Smith and story supervisor Brian Larsen. The four of them delivers an excellent commentary, covering all the topics of the story and the technical aspects, although Andrew's voice can be a little grating at times. But still another excellent commentary from Pixar.

LEGEND OF MOR'DU; A short which enhances the full story about Mor'Du (according to rumors that were around the Internet, the short was supposed to be included in the actual movie). It's a fine short, giving more purpose and weight to the story of Mor'Du and it's nice to see that it's mainly hand-drawn.

LA LUNA: A short and sweet Pixar film.

BRAVE OLD WORLD: A featurette that talks about the crew's visit to Scotland and the Scottish influences on the film. Although is mostly praise about the land and culture, it's still interesting.

MERIDA & ELINOR: A featurette that covers the characters and personalities of Merida and Elinor and their relationship. Chapman herself dominates most of the featurette. A quite engaging topic.

BEARS: A short featurette that covers the designs and animation aspects of Mor'Du and Queen Elinor as a bear. Short, but still quite interesting.

WONDER MOSS: A topic about how they created the moss in the movie. It's a little too technical, but still interesting.

MAGIC: Magic tells us about the magical aspects of the film, like the wisps and the witch and the fairy tale aspect. Quite enjoyable

CLAN PIXAR: A featurette that covers the folks at Pixar. A little more jovial and happy talk than what it needs to be.

ONCE UPON A SCENE: A featurette that delivers the many deleted scenes (and also indicates ""Brave's"" troubled production). It's interesting that Pixar decided to have many of the deleted scenes in one featurette, instead of having the deleted scenes themselves. However, it's still interesting to watch.

Disc two is also filled with many featurettes. First up is an alternative opening (a few shots that made into one of the trailers). While it's not fully animated, it's still an engaging shot.

FALLING WARRIORS: A featurette about the fighting scenes in the movie and how they got choreographed. Short, but interesting.

DIRTY HAIRY PEOPLE: A featurette which talks about the hair in the movie. Also short, but interesting

IT'S ENGLISH... SORT OF: This featurette talks about the use of the Scottish actors, the Scottish words and phrases used in the movie. Quite fun

ANGUS: About Merida's black horse, Angus and how to create the character.

THE TAPESTRY: About the tapestry that Queen Elinor makes in the film and how the creative team managed to create it.

Overall, ""Brave"" is hampered by some flaws and might be to conventional at times, but still makes a good movie to watch. It's easily one of the best animated movies yet on this decade.",1400025600,2,6641,5.015454545454546

1130811,4,7799133104,"I own all the classic Disney animated features, and I have a preference for the lushness of the painting in the 2D movies....think of the woods in Bambi, it's a beautiful work of art. However, with the right story, CGI films can certainly hold their own. Finding Nemo and the Toy Story films are great examples of superlative CGI films. Well, with Brave, the CGI technique has reached a high level. The background scenery of the Scottish Highlands, combined with the Celtic music score, drew me right into the atmosphere of medieval Scotland. And that most difficult of items to depict in CGI, hair and fur, was done magnificently. Watch the mane on Merida's horse, Angus, as it moves & flows while the horse runs...gorgeous! There was exhilaration in the gallops Merida & Angus took when she had a day free of lessons, and the will o' the wisps had a shimmery, magical quality. The first half of the movie had me captivated, although I did find the male characters drawn too broadly....all buffoons....with none of the subtlety of the female characters, especially the Queen. However, once the plot veered off into the changes Merida wrought on her mother, the Queen, I found the story to be far less interesting. It seemed to strain both credulity and logic, and the resolution of an ancient legend seemed confusing and tangential to the mother/daughter conflict. At least, that was my reaction during a first viewing of the film in a theater. However, on a 2nd viewing at home, I thoroughly enjoyed both halves of the movie. It made more sense, and I no longer had unrealistic expectations of what the movie would be like. I found it exciting, that it captured my attention throughout, and the storyline made sense. It was a departure for Pixar to have a female lead, and I applaud them for finally breaking away from their previously male-centric movies. Also, the female leads were just the right degree between the helpless princess and the pseudo-male wannabes like Mulan. They possessed that elusive, and eminently attractive, quality of strength combined with femininity.",1399593600,2,2080,4.895184135977337

1130919,4,7799133104,"So I had just finished watching Brave. I thought it was a very good movie...it's not on the same level as the classics, but I really enjoyed the story alot more than Tangled. I couldn't stand Flynn Ryder or hearing his cheesy monologues... it made me gag. I would even say the characters, story, and the songs were far better than the ones in Tangled. I personally think that Brave should have gotten Tangled's hype. I think Merida is a pretty underrated character/princess. I like how the movie teaches how one's own selfishness can lead to regrettable consequences. It's a story that follows Merida putting a spell on her mother to turn her into a bear just so she could find her way out of being in a an arranged marriage. In the end, Merida realizes how much her mother really loves and cares for her. Her mother even risked her own life to fight off the Mordu bear. She almost lost her mother because she just wanted to escape from being in an arranged marriage and find her own destiny. I could never do a thing like that to cause any bodily harm to my own mother..no matter how many arguments or differences we may have. I have to admit that I really cringe when Merida tries to poison her own mother by giving her a blueberry tart. That was just pure evil and sick. In a way, Merida reminds me of Mulan. Wanting do what the big boys do, defies her elder's wishes, and have things her own way. I really love how the story focuses more on the mother/daughter relationship. I think this would make a great upcoming Mother's Day gift and for anyone that had realized how much we take our own mothers for granted and should settled out whatever differences may arise.",1398470400,,1670,4.44299674267101

It was better than I expected by far. I'm a softie for heartfelt stories. Beauty and the Beast is in my top 10 films of all time. This film rose to (nearly) that standard. Yes, the action was solid, the animation beautiful, the humor hit on every note. But the real story about what it means to be family was the one that got me. From the legend of the four brothers, we saw what a broken family could wreak on the world. I saw my teenage daughter reflected in Meridah's actions and words.

What I find frustrating is how the protagonist defies her parents and there aren't any real clear resolutions or severe consequences.  Just a convoluted plot with a bear transformation.  Why no stories about the rebellious child that, due to their disobedience, falls into a real, life-threatening situation (you know, like real life?)  All of these headstrong, independent female Disney protagonists of recent decades just seem like a long, drawn out apology from Disney for making the character 'Snow  White', but to be honest, I'd watch that film a million times over before  wasting time watching Brave again.

Mom is reasonably upset, they argue and daughter runs off to the woods where she meets a witch who gives her a spell to 'change' mom's mind.  Only problem is, it doesn't change mom's *mind* but rather turns her into a bear.  When the princess realizes what's she's done, it's a race to find the cure before the spell becomes permanent.  How the two manage to resolve their differences and restore mom is a wonderful tale for parents and kids.  Probably one of the best Disney movies I've seen in a long time.

1132058,5,7799133104,"From 1995 to 2004 Pixar ran up an unbelievable string of critical successes with each animated film receiving at least 92% aggregate score on Rotten Tomatoes and 77 out of 100 on Metacritic. Then came Cars which was financially successful but was recognized by many, myself included, as the weakest Pixar movie thus far. Pixar regained its mojo and rattled off another 4 winners before Cars 2 stunk up theaters. The following film, Brave, was the lowest rated Pixar film not featuring Cars in the title. That's not to say it was bad and it did win the 2012 Oscar for Best Animated Feature but some measure of Pixar magic seemed to be lost. It's also possible that Cars 2 was sufficiently bad that it knocked the luster off of Pixar and reviewers were primed for revenge.

There are a lot of films I've seen that are greater than the sum of their parts but Brave is the rare film that seems less than the sum of its parts because I cannot point to anything in the film that's bad. The animation is spectacular and somewhat of a technological breakthrough that Pixar was crowing about prior to the film's release. The breathtaking Scottish Highlands were the first thing I noticed having such an amazing level of detail and organic feel. The only weakness I saw was that character movements are still somewhat jerky and mechanical. I didn't have any issues with the story or the music and I can't think of any individual scenes that weren't well done so why is it when the whole thing is put together it feels so Un-Pixar like?

I've done a lot of thinking about this and I believe one big factor in the failure to connect is due to the darkness of the film. I don't mean the darkness of the plot because quite frankly I think that Up, The Incredibles and WALL-E were darker. It's the physical darkness of the film particularly in the second half of the film. Most of the film takes place in a Scottish castle, at night, lit only by torches on the walls. From the moment Merida leaves the castle after getting in an argument with her mom until right near then end there are almost no well-lit scenes. This is not me saying that this makes the film bad. This is me saying why I believe it didn't connect with a lot of people. On the technical side it is a magnificently crafted film but it lacks the joy of many of the other Pixar films. I would compare it to Wreck-It-Ralph which also came out in 2012 and many might say should have won the Oscar. Wreck-It-Ralph was inventive, bright and full of energy.

I've actually discovered that with each additional viewing I enjoy the film more. It is a great film and Brenda Chapmen who wrote and co-directed the film should be proud. It made well over $500 million worldwide which although a bit light for a Pixar film is still a fantastic take. I'm not into the whole Disney Princess thing being an adult male and all but Merida is probably the best, most believable Princess ever to be produced by Disney/Pixar. She is tough and strong but Chapman didn't go overboard as often happens with writers overcompensating for the farer gender. I suspect it's because Chapman IS female that she didn't feel the need to make Merida tougher than any male (except in archery). Sadly Brenda Chapman left Pixar before the film was completed carrying some bitterness with her. It took me about three viewings to REALLY get into the spirit of the film but I now consider it a great addition to the Pixar filmography. I hope Brenda gets the chance to write and direct more theatrical releases.",1391731200,,3521,4.524332810047095

1132191,2,7799133104,"I made the mistake of listening to the mothers on here who seem to think this is a good movie for girls.  I should've listened to the other reviews that said this movie isn't that great. The message of the movie ultimately is- do your feminine duty.  (even if that duty entails you getting married to someone you don't want to marry).  Um- this is the same message you can find spoonfed to women through the centuries.  It would've been different if Rubella STAYED rebellious throughout the movie, but toward the end Rubella DOES decide to go ahead with the marriage for the sake of duty ""it was selfish of me not to see that this is what I had to do"" she says. Selfish because her marriage is what would end the fighting. And this was the 'lesson' she learned when she 'grew up' in the movie.  And we see her mother look at her in fondness when she does this as if to say 'my little girl has finally grown up.' ugh.

 So she ""learned"" that a girl needs to sacrifice her own independence and dreams for the good of others.  It was only because her mother changed her mind that it didn't actually happen and Rubella didn't go through with it.  So in the end Rubella learned to do her duty and was just lucky that her mother changed her mind about forcing rape on her in marriage.  Just dandy. The idea of the female having a duty to sacrifice herself for the needs/wants of the family and of others is further pointed to by the fact that her brothers in the movie are not expected to do anything similar themselves.  Not to mention that while Rubella is rebelling against being forced towards marriage she is deemed as ""immature"" and unlady-like... and then when the story progresses and she finally decides to succumb to marriage she does not want is when the character is implied to have 'grown up' in some way.  Ridiculous!

I don't see this as that great for girls at all.  There are other animated female characters that are much more independent and don't learn this as a ""lesson.""  All in all, I think the animation and accents were really cute, but the story wasn't that great. And not just because of this women needing to be sacrificial lambs for the sake of the family idea... but the story was lacking in other ways.  It never goes into why the witch was obsessed with Bears or what happened to the prince's family (the one that turned into a bear)..  There are many interesting characters, but we don't get to learn much about them like with other disney films...  The story itself however is completely forgettable and not a healthy lesson for girls.  For strong female leads that don't succumb to this sexist 'lesson' that they need to do their female duties while the men do as they please stick instead with movies Like Mulan and The Princess and the Frog and skip this one.",1391040000,,2790,4.435294117647059

On the first watch, the 4 and 3 year olds were freaked out by the bear attacks, then by the Queen nearly getting killed (several times). But they insisted on watching it again right away. It was interesting watching them figure out the story.

There is a subplot legend about the king and his sons and that took some explaining. They didn't really make the connection when the spirit of son who went roaming is released at the end. They've watched it about 20 times now and they finally understand the connection. Many layers. Still, possibly a little too intense for younger toddlers.

1132788,5,7799133104,"Usually, I don't like Pixar films because I find them shallow and insipid.  HOWEVER, there are the exceptions, for example the charming spy action spoof The Incredibles.
In Brave we find perhaps what was the inevitable use of Pixar technology in creating a Fantasy CGI film in the age of the MMORPG.  Right from the get go, Brave feels charming and mature.  We are introduced to Merida, a fiesty young woman who has more on her mind than childish activities and yet does everything possible to avoid growing up.  This of course leads to a conflict with her family, which is obsessed with marrying her off as soon as possible.
What ensues is what feels like a RAN inspired tale of the dangers of ripping your family apart.  Instead of tragedy though, Brave takes you on a dangerous quest to mend the tapestry of family.. with awesome action sequences that tease you with the notion of Gummi Bears returning.
Brave is a great film, it's mature, it's silly and it's the first Pixar movie I've seen that has a sense of dark, tense danger.  Merida is also a great character, she's not weak, she's charming and strong willed.

1132874,4,7799133104,"To animated film students and CG geeks in general, the geniuses responsible for the Pixar classics we know and love have become something of celebrities themselves.  John Lasseter, Brad Bird, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton, these are the cornerstones of the Pixar ideology so when you encounter a feature film boasting the Pixar name; it seems odd when such names are absent.  Yet such is the case with Brave, Pixar's 2012 big budget action film that spent 6-years in development at a cost of $185-mil.

Though it wasn't overly apparent at the time, looking back 2012's Brave finds itself smack dab in the middle of a Disney animated heroine resonance (2010 saw Rapunzel take center stage in Tangled and 2013's Frozen centers on Elsa, princess of Arendelle).  And, despite nearly a century's worth of Disney experience with leading ladies (think all the 2D princesses throughout the years), Brave actually represents Pixar's first attempt with the concept.  How did they do you ask? The answer depends heavily upon who you ask.

Critics weren't overly generous with the film during its theatrical run, many going as far as to say that it continued in the lackluster tradition of the Pixar piece that preceded it: Cars 2.  It doesn't take much to realize that a lot of such criticism stems from the simple fact that Pixar has managed to raise the bar so ridiculously high in the 17-years' worth of releases separating the first Toy Story from Brave.  Were such criticisms justified with Brave?  Not entirely but let's first take a look at the plot summary.

Set in 10th century Scotland, we follow along on the exploits of one princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald), a redhead tomboy whose regal lifestyle is forever jeopardized when she receives a bow as an early birthday gift.  With aspirations of becoming the best archer in the kingdom replacing those of becoming the best possible wife in a parentally arranged (and politically-driven) marriage, Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson) is forced to watch helplessly as her rebellious daughter mounts her steed and flees into the wilds.  Here the strangely underdeveloped will-o-the-wisps lead her to the cottage of a witch just itching to cast some spells.

Of course if there's one thing we can take away from all Disney films it's that witches should definitely be one's last resort when it comes to the concept of problem-solving and Brave isn't about to break this tradition.  In fact, rather than grant Merida's wish with w a spell that could change her mother's mind about the whole marriage situation, the spell in question actually changes the queen into a bear!  Strange as this sounds, Merida's lovable but brain-cell limited father King Fergus (Billy Connolly) just so happens to have lost his leg in bear attack in the prologue; and hence is not the world's biggest fan of the creatures accordingly.

The king (and much of the village) are bent on slaughtering the bear, unaware that it is in fact their wife and queen respectively.  What results from this point forth is a lot of slapstick as bear Elinor knocks haphazardly about in structures and rooms too small for her newfound girth and does her best to communicate while remorseful Merida endeavors to reverse the spell.

If this all sounds rather un-Pixar-like; that's probably because it is.  In action the film definitely feels more like something we've come to expect from DreamWorks; which is to say entertaining, humorous, solid, and pretty.  However, until now, Pixar has separated itself from the competition with unrivaled cleverness.  It has been their concepts of observing and capturing the nuances of adult life and spinning them around a kid-friendly prose:  In short, something for all ages.  Brave however is a bit more forthright with its delivery and underlying message.  The humor beats certainly harken back to How to Train your Dragon with the brawling, uncouth behavior of the Scottish clans-folk (particularly the overly proportioned King Fergus, who is eerily reminiscent of Dragons' Stoic).

The visuals however are stunning.  Just when you think computer generated imagery has reached its peak, Pixar goes and develops a brand new hair simulator program that required 1,500 individual curl strands to be strung through with a flexible core not unlike the string of a beaded necklace, that allows the scarlet coils to bounce and brush against one another without unwinding.  The misty and green Scottish landscapes are lush and unbelievably intricate with rendered textures and elemental effects that positively dazzle.  Factor in a Patrick Doyle score and Julie Fowlis' Gaelic soundtrack and the environment almost makes up for what the depth in story lack... almost.

All in all Brave remains an entertaining 93-minutes with enough gusto to keep the little ones glued to the screen while adults marvel at the near-photorealistic textures laced throughout.  Had this one come from any of the other animation studios in the world, it most certainly would have earned unanimous praise.  Perhaps Pajib's Agent Bedhead said it best in his June 22, 2012 review of the film: ""Brave is a pretty good movie. In fact, for a Dreamworks or Sony movie, it's outstanding. However, relative to the Pixar brand, Brave is merely OK.""",1388620800,,5247,5.052204176334107

1133256,1,7799133104,"Hi Everyone,
I'm writing this review a year late. I also had problems with the Brave Blu-ray disk. I read that many people using an L:G Blu-ray player experienced the same prob;em I had. I have a Toshiba Blu-ray player and had the same exact problem. I returned the set to the Disney store I purchased it at and was given a new set to try. The new set was no better than the first. The store manager was very surprised and gave me another one to try. I was very disappointed and quite amazed that three out of three had the same problem. Although the DVD from each set I tried worked and played through the whole movie with no trouble at all.

I had a similar experience with Cars 2. The Blu-ray disk from the combo set had some type of a virus. No sooner than it began to play my virus detection software alerted me of a virus. I returned it to the store and tried another copy. Both copies of Cars 2 had the very same proble. I gave up, returned it to the store and bought the DVD and had no problems with it.

Since these experiences, I no longer purchase Disney Blu-ray disks or combo sets. The DVD's play just fine in my computer and Toshiba Ble-ray player. Furthermore, I have never notice much difference between Disney Blu-ray or DVD's and I have a 50 inch Panasonic Plasma Smart screen TV. Now I save my hard earned money by purchasing only Disney DVD's for my little princess. I recommend advice this to everyone reading my review!!!!",1387324800,,1444,4.305147058823529

1133258,5,7799133104,"This is a great turn around from the typical Disney princess movie.  Merida is confident, she knows what she wants and is asserting herself to get that.  It also brings family together and shows that even through differences your family is there behind you.  My daughter loves all of the Disney princesses and i'm glad that there have been some changes in the story lines to show stronger, pro feminine young women.",1387238400,,415,4.736111111111111

1133260,5,7799133104,"I entered this movie assuming it would be another story about a princess who is saved by Prince Charming and then she falls madly in love with him and feel obligated to love him because he saved her. I don't have anything against those stories, but they aren't the only stories in the world.

I actually was delighted when I found out this was a story not about falling in love, but about saving one's self. Merida didn't need someone to save her, she was stronger then all the men in the area. She didn't need a prince to swoop in at the last second and slay the beast, nor did she need a man to inspire her to save the day. Merida could save herself.

I felt like Merida was an inspiration to girls all over the world. She is proof that you don't need a prince charming, that they are just a perk to life and that no one, not even them, gets to choose who you love.",1387238400,,867,4.094117647058823

1133334,5,7799133104,This is a great family film.  It's definitely one of Disney's best.  The bear may be a little scary for really young kids.  But our whole family (8 and up) love it.,1387238400,,164,4.0625

However, the one thing I found out after purchasing the blu-ray of this disc is really what I wanted to warn people about. If you own an LG Blu-Ray player, then you will have to update your firmware after buying this disc otherwise it will freeze and shut off your player at the 5:12 min mark in the movie. Apparently (through doing some research) Disney and LG are both aware of the problem and LG has come up with a patch for it, but it will happen with just this particular Blu-Ray. Hopefully, that helps!",1386720000,,738,4.426470588235294

This heroine gets to be herself and figure out how to fit that into her world, which is something that everyone needs to learn as they grow up.  I like how Disney tried to make Merida (the main character here) sexier recently when she was put in with the other Disney princesses and there was an outcry so serious that they returned her to her attractive but unprovocative self.  Someday, we as a culture will get our attitudes about women straight.  I am holding out hope.  This movie streamed well and was good quality.",1386460800,,609,4.611111111111111

1133956,5,7799133104,"I LOVED that this story had almost nothing to do with a prince charming or a king father or an evil step mother. Disney has finally given us a princess worth rooting for. A princess who is more concerned with controlling her own fate, has no plans to marry and prince charming and a princess whose Mom is a vital part of the story.",1381968000,,331,4.1875

She got over it by the time the dvd came out, but as she left the theater she told me she did not want to buy this movie.  That is our barometer of how much she liked it.  Sort of weird to make a Princess movie that little girls can't embrace. I talked to lots of other parents who had the same experience as I had.  I loved the movie, but parents with young girls should be aware that the bear scenes are too scary for some kids.",1381708800,,502,3.9405940594059405

1134021,5,7799133104,"I expected this movie to be another childish 3D animation with over-the-top fantasy elements and more than a few silly talking animals; I was surprised to find a thoughtfully-done, interesting story, with magic that was often understated, and a historical realistic feel.

The story contains some of the familiar elements: magic, a witch, and a princess trying to escape her royal duty, but at its core this is a story of a mother/daughter relationship and a rebellious teenage girl growing up.

This is my favorite 3D animated. It manages to strike the perfect balance between adventure, humor, and deeper meaning.",1381190400,,615,5.14

We were a little afraid of the young daughters getting frightened by some of the fighting bear scenes.  One day it happened to come on TV and the daughter most likely to be scared had not made any sound well past the point we were worried about.

I ended up grabbing this during one of those amazing flash sales, so I saved a bunch and still got the Prime shipping. This has both Blu-Ray and standard, so we can take on in the car with us to keep the kids happy. Unlike some of the other movies they've produced in recent years, this one is relevant and timeless, and a great movie for mothers and daughters to watch together.

1134228,3,7799133104,"This is another wonderfully made movie from Pixar/Disney. The animation is outstanding, the actors picked for voices are well known and do an outstanding job, but the story is so weak as to make the movie trivial. The plot centers around a tomboy princess who wants to have her own identity and follow her own desires and of course her own life. This is a good opening, but the story degenerates into a farce about a magic potion that turns her mother into a bear, and the resultant senseless chaos. The only forceful, believable characters in the story are the protagonist (Merida, the Princess) and her mother,(Elinor the Queen). Every single man in the story is portrayed as a buffoon and/or vulgar slob, including her father. Who was Merida ever going to marry? None of the men in the entire kingdom are worthy of even a first glance. The craziness of her mother being bewitched goes on too long, and the moviegoer feels only relief when Elinor finally is returned to her own form. Masterfully done by the best animation house in the world, but could have been a much better movie with a stronger plot and a more profound story.",1379808000,10,1132,4.63681592039801

1134636,3,7799133104,"I was excited about this movie because the animation seemed brilliant and cutting-edge & Scottish culture is very colorful & interesting-- so I bought it in HD for $20.  The visuals & computer graphics did not disappoint-- Walt Disney would be awestruck and ecstatic if he could see what the industry can do these days--No doubt. But I believe he would have had the writers work on the storyline a bit more before releasing this to the public.  It was a nice idea -- I'm sure that every mother & daughter would be able to recognize themselves in this tale of Merida and her queen mom-with-nagging-high-expectations.  And, yes, when rifts and disagreements occur as a result of youthful pride and stubborn ego a mother figure can become, at least in the eyes of her daughter, a scary giant bear--who can be threatening & monstrous towards her girl --as well as more protective of her baby than any other natural force in the living world--- I completely get the metaphor and it had so much potential to resonate more with people than it actually did.  But somehow, the metaphor in its beginning is strained and carries little momentum.  There seem to be few apparent parallels between the Queen and her enchanted persona.  Perhaps this could have been fixed by making her more ""bear-like"" before the transformation-but it would be difficult to do this and still have her be likable.  So as it stands for most of the film, there is very little to make us believe that the Queen is really inside of this bear-and it's somewhat horrifying to think that her husband is getting ready to slay his wife b/c of mistaken identity.  The story is redeemed in the one scene when Merida believes that she has failed to break the spell that holds her mother captive.  She waits for the bear to transform back to her mother -and she is crushed when it does not occur as she had hoped.  She is humbled and can only hopelessly cling to her mother's side -wishing her back to who she once was.  This scene was masterfully done and rightfully brings the audience to tears.  Almost as fulfilling as the classic scene from ""Dumbo"" where his mother reaches thru the bars of the carnival cage with her trunk to be with him as much as she is able to.  C'mon Disney-Pixar -- don't be distracted/overwhelmed by your own visuals-- make sure the story is refined and fleshed out as much as possible before takeoff.",1376006400,3,2385,4.623222748815166

1134739,3,7799133104,"It's not that this movie is bad, I just find it too questionable. What exactly was Pixar trying to get across in this film? The characters say something about changing their fates, but no one knows what their fate will be. We can only change our fates when we know them, or at least sometime we can. The accents...don't exactly help. And the story is just a little dissapointing. I was hoping this would be a ""Mulan"" kind of story where Merida goes into a war, or she could go on a quest, but instead we get...turning her mother into a bear. Yeah, bears are not exactly that interesting, and they let Pixar throw away a great opportunity for a film set in medieval Scotland. Also, the villain is yet another ferocious animal, with no actual evil plot. Yeah, villains who are downplayed like this just don't fascinate me very well. I mean there are some good things about this film, particularly the triplet brothers. They may not speak, but their comical actions speak loud enough. Also, I guess it is rare to see a strained relationship with a mother. It's usually the father whom the main characters argue with. Was this movie meant to teach a lesson to mothers and daughters? Eh, possibly. Merida's design is not that beautiful and I feel as though she's the black sheep of the Disney Princesses. SHe just doesn't do anything that remarkable. I am DREADING a bunch of complaints from my sister when she figures THAT out. I'd say the only time I felt annoyed at this film was when it won the Academy Award for Best ANimated Film instead of ""Wreck-It Ralph"" which I thought told a better story and should have been a Pixar film. I guess this film is okay for what is is, but I would still like to see something a little stronger.",1375228800,5,1730,4.477848101265823

Moving on. I used to live in Europe and hearing the accents in a kid's movie was fantastic! What a great cast as well! (I immidiately recognized Kelly Macdonald's voice from Boardwalk Empire and fell in love). Overall, the movie was great, a little bit sad for a family movie but defenitely one I wish came out when I was a little girl.

1134903,3,7799133104,"Disney should definitely be applauded for trying to break the mould and make a movie centered around a girl. Unfortunately, it quickly degenerates into a moral story of how parents and children should behave with each other and what happens when the latter don't!

The movie starts promisingly, with the protagonist, depicted to be a free spirit. Unfortunately, within no time, she behaves like an idiot (surprising considering she is shown behaving very adult-like a few minutes ago) and ends up turning her mother into a bear.

From this point onwards, the movie degenerates into a mother-daughter bonding tale and the mother gets more focus than the daughter.

While watching this movie, I continued to sense that something was missing...towards the end, I realized that inspite of its title, the movie lacked real bravery of any sort...",1374278400,,840,5.116788321167883
1134904,4,7799133104,"The story takes special care to set up the mother as a monster, and then they turn her into one.  As far as the term `brave' being applied to a girl who is simply fighting for respect and acknowledgement of her own merits against the tyrannical ravings of an overbearing mother who clearly rules the kingdom instead of the permissive caring father/king.......  I'm not certain what I watched was a demonstration of bravery as opposed to squirming out of a mess of her own making.  Merida is a girl who wants to go her own way and when given two grand opportunities to escape, she does just the opposite.  Instead of fleeing for her life, she resorts to trickery to get her mother to see things her way.  She finds a means of finally making her mother shut up and listen, only to have precious little to say to the woman/bear other than they need to find a means of getting out of the trouble she caused.  The fact that the mother/queen has a belated epiphany where her daughter is concerned might have more to do with the desperation to return to her normal form and not angering the only person who might be able to do just that.

This movie is loaded with mixed messages.  They barely skirted around the issue of servitude through an arranged marriage to a total stranger.  And what about blind obedience that only serves the person making all the orders/demands?  The same person who charges, ""we can't run away from who we are.""  Who we are, or what someone else wants us to be?  As for celebrating Pixar's first strong female character, I found it incredibly odd that there was a curious lack of female characters in the first place, strong or otherwise.  There was just the domineering mother, the less than dutiful daughter, a wacky witch, and for comic relief a nanny of sorts.  Why?  In this fantasy, were women supposed to be barely seen and never heard?  Evidently, this was a matriarchal society, run by an iron-willed woman, why weren't more women involved in the story?

Not my favorite Pixar movie by a long shot.  But.  All the characters save one were fantastic, the art work was spectacular (but fared better on the theater screen than a small screen TV), loads of good humor, some excitement, it's a keeper but not a movie I will watch all that often.

As for the viewing problems noted above, I have an older LG Blu-ray player and both the DVD and the Blu-ray disks played just fine in it.",1374192000,,2409,4.506912442396313

1135213,5,7799133104,"For those of you who don't know, Stephen Colbert is a hilarious fellow who runs his own political/comedy show, called ""The Colbert Report"" on Comedy Central. Among Colbert's more humorous quirks is an all-consuming, quite irrational fear of bears. He seems to believe they are out to get him at every opportunity, and that they may very well be bent on conquering the world itself. As such, he would probably soil his shorts by watching ""Brave"", as this movie is chock-full of bears... most of which are adorable, but some of which are quite scary.

If you share Colbert's weird fear of bears, steer clear of ""Brave"", for it will undoubtedly give you night terrors for a solid fortnight. Personally, I think bears are awesome, and Pixar's rendering of them in this beautifully animated movie is nothing short of breathtaking. The other elements of animation are likewise up to the studio's industry-leading standards, and this movie is just as visually impressive as anything else in their formidable stable. These guys can create vibrant, immersing worlds like nobody else.

The story, while somewhat simplistic, is also great. At first, I was a bit hesitant as the plot began to unfurl, as I feel that the ""angst-ridden teenager whom nobody understands"" theme has been ridden to death, and I couldn't believe that Pixar would go down that road. However, I was happy to see that the movie soon took on unexpected twists and turns, and delivers an exciting, heart warming tale that even Stephen Colbert would enjoy (should he be able to look past the scary bears). ""Brave"" is highly recommended for viewers of all ages, and makes for a great movie for parents to share with their lil' ones.",1372291200,,1690,4.864583333333333

1135217,3,7799133104,"I admittedly had high expectations for this film, as I love all things with a Celtic flavor, and the story of a spirited little girl appealed to me.  It starts out nice, setting up the theme of changing one's fate and Merida's attempts to do so are fun to watch.

But the story I think gets a bit off-center once the witch enters the picture.  It struck me as undermining the whole message that she needed magic to essentially change the rules and get herself out of her current situation, rather than finding a clever way to do so on her own.  Is she really changing her fate in that case, or is some mystical force doing so that we couldn't possibly call on in real life?  What sort of message does that send?

I was also expecting the antagonist of the film to take more of a center-stage in things... possibly even being a love-interest, ala Beauty and the Beast.  That is one time where magic would have been acceptable - to counteract previous magic.  But this doesn't pan out, either.

What we get here is a perhaps-touching film about family values when we really could of had a strong leading female changing her fate through the sheer force of her will.  While the film as it is is certainly enjoyable in its own right, the latter would have perhaps made a more powerful, poignant film.

Pixar is one of the very few reliable film companies out there. And by reliable, I mean that you know exactly what you've signed up for, what to expect and it is always delivered. Walking into a Pixar is like going to an amusement park. You've been on the rides before, you've learned the layout pretty easily and what there is to see, but 20 years later you still have a blast.

Brave is a little different from other Pixar films in the sense that not everybody can relate to the characters and plot. The theme of the film is deeply grounded in a study of free agency and the power that individuals have to make up their own lives and futures, but at the surface it's simply the story of a girl and her mother trying to see eye-to-eye. This is very well done but no matter what experiences I have in my life, I will never understand what it is to have a mother/daughter relationship. The emotion is there, the humor and desire for conciliation as well, but being a man...well, all I can do when coming out of the theater is smile and say ""That was nice.""

Despite this major element of the plot, there are many other things that can be learned and appreciated from this film. As mentioned above, free agency is a big part of the story along with its friends, the great theories on nature vs. nurture. To top it off, throw in a dash of unconditional love, then contemplate the effects of hasty or impulse decision-making and blend it all with both the fear of the unknown and the courage - or bravery - to take it on. Serve while warm and you've got yourself a pretty successful dish. Say one thing for PG films, say that they've got a message to share.

Where Brave is lacking compared to its compatriots - Up, Wall-E, Monsters Inc and others - is in scope. The setting was small, taking place inside a castle and its surrounding the entire time. Characters never seemed to travel more than an hour away from this central location. The turn-around of main events was also very short, most plot points being resolved within minutes. The bulk of the film must have taken place in about 3 days timeline. It just seems to me that the types of challenges that were being faced by the characters might have taken more effort to resolve. I wish there had been more time and vision spent on actually getting the characters to interact with each other.

The film was a bit clich at times, but what do you expect from a kids film? They thrive on clich, so no real complaints there. Graphically speaking, Pixar technology basically leads the industry and Brave is pretty much visually stunning. From the feathers on the ends of arrows, to the curls in Merida's hair, to the flow of water in streams, the vision they are able to convey onto the screen in nothing short of jaw-dropping. Solid - though not outstanding - soundtrack and great vocal performances. I found myself easily slipping into this world, almost to the point of forgetting it was CGI. Not quite, but almost and I know the day is almost here.

I need to mention one more thing that I truly appreciated about this film and that was being shown a child and parent willing to fight for each other to the very end and no matter what. In a world as crazy as our own, it is easy to forget that we have people on our side and who are willing to do whatever it takes to protect and maintain us. Equally, it is easy to forget that those same people are not invincible and could use no less from us than what they are giving. Brave wove this into the tapestry of the film beautifully and - whether or not it was intentional - I found myself deeply moved by this aspect of the film.

Brave is not the best of the lot - it's no Up - but on a scale from lame to amazing it's quite good. I was overall pleased with my experience and would definitely recommend it to anybody looking for simple and clean family fun. There are a few moments were the humor was pushed close to the limit of appropriate for your five-year old, but these were pretty sparse.  Take it all in with a grain of salt and you'll be sure to walk away from those ending credits feeling warm and fuzzy inside.

P.S. The Pixar Short that runs before the film, La Luna, is a masterpiece that deserves awards. Absolutely fabulous, I could write a whole review on those five minutes alone. Go see Brave just for this short film if you must, it would be worth it.",1370563200,,4425,4.334541062801932

1135592,3,7799133104,"With a Scottish setting, stunning visuals and a stirring soundtrack this movie promises much and things get off to a splendid start... but then the writers bring in that ridiculous spell which turns Merida's mother into a... bear?!?! This is where the movie starts losing the plot. I couldn't believe my eyes. From this point on I would sit there shaking my head - what on earth were the writers thinking??

Merida's mother was a strong character who exuded regal charisma. What possessed the writers to turn her into a bear?? Her bear mannerisms and Merida's interaction with her... good grief. It was such a waste of a pivotal character. If that wasn't enough Merida's three little brothers turn into bears as well!

Merida's character came across as a little bratty at times but not to the extent, in my opinion, that other reviewers have made it out to be. I personally liked her character a lot: spirited, strong, independent, yet with plenty of heart. In saying that however some of her dialogue towards her mother was over the top and totally uncalled for (eg 'You're a beast. I'd rather die than be like you!'). Gotta love that big mane of red hair though.

'Brave' certainly does have plenty of strong scenes (my absolute favorite being the one accompanied by the song 'Touch The Sky' - this scene gives me goosebumps every time I re-watch it) but the whole 'bear spell' storyline was just plain stupid.

I was hoping that 'Brave' was going to be more grounded in some sense of reality and history, as to opposed the over-worn hocus pocus themes that seem to permeate animations. And how Merida's use of a spell to change her mother is to be considered brave is beyond me. I do re-watch the movie to purely enjoy the Scottish setting - however very rarely will I watch beyond the bear transformation scene (about 38 minutes into the story) - the movie seriously loses the plot from that moment on and is painful to watch, especially when up to that point it's terrific viewing.

All in all this movie was well made, however it easily had the potential to have been so much more, had it not been for the ridiculous 'bear spell' storyline. I just hope the writers are brave enough to admit that they dropped the ball here with that idea and will seek to make amends for any sequels.",1370476800,2,2289,4.6004901960784315

It is delightful, funny, and did I say light hearted?
You understand this is probably a ""chic flick"" and fits into the "" whimsical"" category. But it's fun!

What I found, however, was an extraordinary and very original post-modern fairy tale. It is a solid balance of humor with the emotional weight Pixar has recently become notorious for (cough Up and Toy Story 3). Furthermore, by placing the setting in a semi-historical context, the story gains a much heavier sense of importance and meaning.

Pixar's recent foray into more mature work also makes the stakes much higher for each new film. Their marketing team did a solid job of not revealing many plot details (the commercials just hit the tip of the iceberg), so the plot details are genuinely surprising. The main plot has not even been addressed in any of the advertisements I've seen.

I had my doubts going into it, but Brave turned out to be a very different and far superior movie than I was expecting. Don't fight it just because it looks like Mulan or other girl-power fare.

1135940,5,7799133104,"Disney/Pixar really hit the mark on this one. The main character shares a lot more true-to-life qualities with growing up that many past princess characters; she's rebellious to the point of not only going against her mother's wishes, but trying to subvert them completely. But she loves her family dearly all the same, and the bond runs deep through all that happens. Seeing a child's deep love and caring towards a parent whose rules they also so desperately wish to escape from is a very different motif for a Disney princess story. I found it heartwarming on so many different levels. The fear, the bravery, the sacrifices, and the strengthening of their loving bond through their tribulations are all wonderful and relatable parts of the story for any parent and their growing (or grown!) child. The lesson of mutual respect between a parent and child is a wonderful reminder of this constant challenge to both real-life counterparts as they watch this movie, as well.

As others have stated, this movie does have some fairly scary scenes involving animals. Many people use the term ""intense,"" which they are, but to be perfectly blunt - they're scary. As a small child, I would have had bad dreams involving them, but I also clung to imagery in movies very tightly and had an overactive imagination. If in doubt, watch the movie by yourself first, or search online for a synopsis or video of just the scary scenes if you don't want to spoil getting to watch the whole movie together for the first time with your child. It's not ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" or anything - it's just good to be aware of the scenes if you have a child you know gets frightened easily.

As for the physical disc itself, the presentation is very nice. I like the lenticular slip cover that goes over the disc case, though it is prone to the corners getting a little bent after removing and reinserting the blu-ray case a few times, as it's a pretty tight fit. I do appreciate that unlike a lot of multi-disc sets, the discs aren't stacked on top of each other in this package. Each one is one its own little spindle so you can get to whichever disc you want without having to remove a bunch of others first. The bonus features are also really enjoyable, and this movie looks great in 3D! A wonderful package to buy if you'd like to get the complete set of viewing options (we used the 3D blu-ray as a special ""movie night"" treat, the standard blu-ray for normal ""let's pop in a movie"" type viewing, and the DVD for playing in the car during road trips).",1369094400,3,2534,4.579295154185022

1135948,3,7799133104,"This is an addition to my original review (below).

After viewing this film for a third time, I finally determined where the real fault lies in the story.  Merida (the princess) wants to change tradition (i.e., her marriage to the winner of a contest).  But the problem is, she does absolutely nothing to earn the RIGHT to challenge the tradition.  That is, Merida does not place her own personal safety at stake, nor does she redeem anyone by taking her position (e.g., by personally saving the soul of the ghost-bear prince).  If she had placed her own interests at risk, or accomplished something grand or noble by taking her position, then she would have earned the right to challenge tradition.  But ... she did nothing.  Rather, it was her mother (Elinor) who changed.  In short, the ostensible heroine of the story (i.e., Merida) did nothing meritorious - she was only ""brave"" in being a defiant child.  And what lesson does that teach?

My original review:

With over 2000 reviews written thus far, it's unlikely that anyone will read my review.  Notwithstanding, here I go.

First of all, let me say that the animation is superb - what Pixar has done in the way of animating hair and water is simply amazing.  The forest scenes in the early part of the film are works of art.

Now, to my major problems with the film.  Yes, I understand that the ""moral"" of the story is about being brave in choosing and pursuing your own destiny.  What I simply don't get is why the mother (Elinor) underwent such a radical change in personality (going over to accept her daughter's views) merely as a result of her transformation to a bear.  There was simply nothing in the mother's experience as a bear which would explain this transformation of personality.  Yes, there is the whole ""fish"" scene, and the ""rescue from the evil bear"" scene, but I just don't see why either experience should convince the mother that she was wrong in her views, and that her daughter (Merida) was right.  Plus, it does not seem that any lesson was learned by Merida, the ostensible heroine of the story (a major shortfall in story telling).  In fact, it seems to me that the story is more about the mother (Elinor), and what she learned as a result of her experiences.  But, as said, the story falls short to that end.  Plus, there is the whole confusing thread of ""legends are lessons"" - what lesson was learned by whom and as a result of the story told?  Merida did not save her mother - it was the mother who saved herself from the ""evil bear"".  So, in my opinion, not good story telling.

John Lassiter (the father of Pixar) is on record as being a great admirer of the films of Hayao Miyazaki (as am I).  In Brave Lassiter attempts to create a ""young heroine"" story line, perhaps along the lines of Miyazaki's Spirited Away, or Nausica of the Valley of the Wind.  But Lassiter falls short in Brave.  That is, the ostensible heroine of Brave (i.e., Merida) does not place her own life at risk in order to save those whom she loves (or for a greater ideal).  In Brave, Merida's greatest contribution to the salvation of her mother is merely placing the stitched-together tapestry over her mother.  It was not Merida who saved the day, but rather her mother, Elinor.  So what lesson is to be learned from this film?  Nothing, so far as I can discern.  Merida (the daughter) did not ""save the day"", and Elinor (the mother) underwent a transformation in personality with no satisfactory explanation as to why that occurred.  In the end, a confusing story line as to what was learned by who, and why.",1368835200,23,3576,4.577952755905512

My son even likes the archery in it after he got to try his hand at it in Cub Scouts!",1368662400,,407,4.0875
1136010,5,7799133104,"First off, the animation quality in this movie is absolutely beautiful.  Just watching how Merida's (the main female character) long curly red hair moves in a wonder in and of itself.  Animation is just getting better and better.

As are the plots for many animation movies.  I didn't see this movie in the theatre, a decision which I now regret.  But I sat down to watch it based on the idea of a main female protagonist and with a love of all things Scottish.  I was not disappointed.  The humor was great, if crude at times, and the Scots characters covered a spectrum as displayed by the different virtues and vices of each clan.

Merida is a princess and is expected to wed one of the three sons of the other three clans.  Her own father is head of the fourth clan, and she discovers a clause so that she can ""fight"" for her own hand and takes part in the contests.  Of course, she is a wild girl who can ride, hunt, and shoot with the best and resents her much more dignified and formal mother's attempts to make a real ""lady"" out of her.  She resists what she sees as her Fate and so discovers that the question about Princess vs Rebel was never so far apart as she first thought.

This is a real mother-daughter picture, one that brings the two together as they fight to overcome the results of a badly-chosen spell.  In-between the funny scenes, we see how they each learn to really see each other, rather than their expectations of each other.

The movie has many elements (especially how people speak) woven into the (somewhat) more historical ones, so it will appeal to a modern audience.  Fortunately, it isn't too distracting.  There is enough action that most kids won't get too bored, but I would recommend this movie more for 8 year olds and up than any younger ones.  Highly recommended for young teen girls, the reasons for which will be obvious if you watch the movie.

Not my absolute favorite animated movie, but right up there.",1368662400,,1950,4.475920679886686

Well, it's the latter, thankfully. Merida is a great character and role model for girls (and boys, really) who are struggling between respecting their parents and growing into their own person.

This isn't at all a story about a girl who a) needs rescuing, or b) falls helplessly in love. If anything, it's a love story about the complicated relationship between mothers and daughters. It's also about duty versus personal freedom.

Merida is the kind of girl who doesn't wait around to be rescued. When the situation warrants, she rescues herself. Good for Pixar. A great movie!",1368489600,,782,4.82089552238806

Brave was boring, the main character was repulsive to look at as well as many of the characters, it was too hyped up i was already sick of it before i watched it. if they had tried their traditional animation i may have liked it better, but honestly Brave was just wasted money in my opinion

Then we tried it again - and started seeing the Pixar subversion. And the chess game!

Chess game? Well, since making ""Alice in Wonderland,"" haven't we always wondered about ""Through The Looking Glass?""

Here it is: brave girl with long red hair, going through a portal, riding a horse and making knight-like leaps, assisted by three little pawns, all trying to protect the queen, sort of backed by an overly-enthusiastic king, - and then, when the board goes bad, the queen, with all her terrible powers, moves into battle and uses brain over brawn.

And what about that tattoo'd boy? The one who wants to make his own love choices, fights like a girl (sorry about the stereotype), and focuses on another of the boys. Hey!

1136535,1,7799133104,"Arguably no institution has greater power to shape and mold public opinion than mass media organizations like Disney.  They claim to simply respond to public tastes, but they usually twist and turn those tastes to suit their own objectives.  Their influence is hard to see, since they start early, shaping our minds when we are yet youngsters.  Pixar's Brave is a case in point.

Promoted as a hip, feminist fairy tale, Brave tells the story of Merida, a Scottish princess required to marry a prince from a rival clan in order to quell the potential for war.  Merida sports the most violently blow-dried mop of red hair since Nicole Kidman's Aussie youth.  The princes vying for Merida's hand - like all male characters in the film - are portrayed as oafish losers.  Merida seems justified when claiming the right as a first-born noble to ""champion herself.""  In Zena-like fashion, she is quite the waifish warrior, capable of outmatching the males at all martial arts.

Most of the film deals with Merida's conflict with her mother; she defies the Queen's wishes to submit to an arranged marriage.  A magical spell causes Merida's mother to transform into a beast.  The girl must reconcile with her mother before the change becomes permanent.

The subtext of the story involves how females suffer from the burdens of obligations they bear due to men.  Like many popular entertainments, Brave characterizes females as almost a separate species from males, possessing insight and sensitivity that the barely-sentient masculine sex lacks.  The last time we saw a wave of similarly-themed entertainment was during the feminist revolution of the early Seventies.  In both cases, the true conflict was not between the sexes but between employers and workers.  In the 2000's the public is saturated with stories about female empowerment, but really it is a justification for an employer's power to hire cheaper female workers, firing men en masse.  Brave is an attempt to reconcile children to this social norm, even before they develop the power to decide for themselves what those norms should be.  In the end, Brave is a sinister agent for a brave new world.",1367020800,19,2155,4.988795518207283

Young Merida is the headstrong daughter of the feisty Scottish King Fergus and the equally strong but more quiet Queen Elinor, and loves both with all her heart, but as a princess, finds her duties to be a royal pain in the tush. Elinor is grooming her to royal duties, but Merida sees the inequality of her life as she has three smaller brothers who can almost get away with anything and are not facing the duties she must. In what little time she has to herself. she can be found outside the castle walls, riding her horse and practicing her archery, her favorite hobby. It is when she discovers she has been, literally put up for betrothal to the winner in a contest between three clans that the war with her mother actually begins as she has no desire to be married at all unless she can choose for herself, and none of the three clans offer much hope for a good match. Merida then takes matters into her own hands when she enters the contest to win her own hand sparking a raging argument with her mother which sees her flying off alone in tears. Willo the wisps enter the picture to lead her to an old witch's cottage where she pays the witch to cast a spell to change her fate. It changes more than that. It turns her mother into a bear and binds both her and her mother to an older fate when she finds she must not only seek a way to change her mother back, but protect her from her father who is seeking to kill what he believes is a legendary monster. Worse, both must contend with the monster, who is not only legendary, but alive. Merida must fight her father while Elinor takes on the powerful creature to save her daughter. How does it end? You'll have to see. I love this because it doesn't fall into the usual fairytale rule of Prince marrying the princess and living happily ever after. This is a tale of a headstrong powerful girl changing her fate and herself, seeking more from life than to be a prize for a contest and the dutiful quiet wife of a winner she doesn't even know. She is seeking the freedom to choose for herself what she wants and must be brave to not only find what she wants, but to correct her mistakes and protect her family as well as she might.

Princess Merida is strong, stubborn and brave but gets herself (and her mother) in trouble when she follows will-o-wisps in the forest and does business with a witch.

The graphics are exceptional. The musical soundtrack was perfect for the movie. I thought casting for the voices of the many characters was particularly spot on.

This is an uplifting movie and I look forward to the day I can watch it with my twin grandchildren. But not only children will enjoy this movie. I'm sure past that point in my life and I thought it was fun and inspiring.

There are some scary parts to the movie so this isn't for little children - I would say probably at least eight years old. Others have mentioned nudity. What you see is cartoon backsides. I was not offended by the scenes.",1366329600,,896,4.552795031055901

1136805,4,7799133104,"Who doesn't love a good princess movie?  I mean, if you have children, or more specifically if you have daughters, then princess movies circulate your DVD player on an almost constant, and so you really do hope and pray and a good one comes along.  There are so many of them.  Pixar, the same studio behind great animated films like `Up' and `Toy Story' has never ventured into princess territory, and so when `Brave' was announced the internet (and every attentive parent) got their hopes up for this to actually be something special.

In parts, this really is, but in other parts it is kind of the same.

I think where `Brave' differs from almost every single other princess movie is that the protagonist is actually fighting AGAINST the idea of finding a prince charming.  It may have a lot to do with what she is offered (laughable at best) but the idea that she is more of a tomboy seeking her right to be herself and express herself freely, and without tradition barking in her ear, is a nice touch.  It's not like that same sentiment hasn't been expressed before.  Disney films like `Pocahontas' and `Mulan' display similarly strong-willed women fighting against the traditions of their people, but `Brave' takes it a step further by eliminating the desire to find Mr. Right.  Sadly, the overall construction of `Brave' doesn't steer too far from the set course.  It follows a similar story outline and so, by the time the film has ended, it does feel like an exercise in the same.

The visuals are lush, and the moral of communication and compromise are nice assets to the films progression.  Folklore is such a fun and spirited way of telling a story, although I will say that many of the films plot points felt a tad lazy in construction.  Really, another witch?  Another potion?  Can't we do better than that?  The film is heartwarming and presents a meaningful message, especially for families since it stresses the importance of realty listening to one another.

At the end of the day, my daughters love this (obviously) but I'm not entirely sold on the finished product.  Maybe it's because I expected more from the same studio that found such inspired ways to address so many mature themes (growing up via `Toy Story 3', mourning and loss via `Up', parenthood and balance via `Finding Nemo').  I wanted this to be something special, something amazing.  It was good, but lacked greatness.",1366243200,2,2402,4.742168674698795

Nothing heroic, nothing inspiring, nothing adventurous, & outside of the first 5-10 minutes... nothing entertaining. Also not sure what the title ""BRAVE"" had to do with anything with the story line or main character. The lead character didn't do anything ""BRAVE"" once the story started. As for the settings & locations (in which an animated feature could transport you anywhere your imagination takes you)... yet the entire movie actually took place in about 2 locations; the modest castle & a small section of the forest. Once again there was no imagination.

Even the supporting characters were lacking. The witch (who was pivotal to the story twist) was dumb, one dimensional, the character was not fleshed out, had no originality & outside of 5 minutes the witch had no further involvement in the entire movie. The main villain of the whole story line had very little background ... we didn't know anything about ""him"" even during the conclusion. The whole plot revolved around turning the mother into a Bear?? The only thing more absurd, was how ""the Bear"" interacted with the daughter. It was clumsy, and a head shaker. The moment that happened & I realized that dynamic is what the whole plot revolved around... they lost me. The first 5-10 minutes of BRAVE (when the main character was a child) were promising, after that, there was no point to making this movie... even less of a point to watch it. The best way to describe BRAVE, is that the entire movie merely scratched the surface of what they could have done. In a word... disappointing.",1366070400,14,1631,4.825

As appealing as the other Disney princesses are, Merida brings a healthy dose of real-life teen rebellion, a desire for independence, unique talent, and the ability to think on her own two feet to the concept of princess as a model young woman.  Additionally, this is the only Disney princess film I can think of in which the mother of the princess is still living.  The evolution of the relationship between Merida and the Queen has an extraordinary arc that will leave you in tears--it makes me cry every time.  There are some pretty scary parts that might not be appropriate for some children, and I would have loved for the songs to be on the lips of the princess and her queen mother, but Brave has nevertheless become my very favorite animated film and I'd recommend it to any parent.",1366070400,,859,4.631578947368421

 ( CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVENT SEEN THE MOVIE DONT READ )

 The first time I saw the trailer for Brave I thought OH WOW THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS GOOD lol! Most family movies that come out these days just seem to be more for the little kids then the entire family.(I grew up on the movies from renaissance Disney) So when I found out about Merida, The fresh new warrior princess defying tradition.. I guess I over hyped it for myself.
 The beginning looked great! Everything looked so real I thought I was watching live action. The music is very beautiful and melodic. Our female protagonist is princess Merida. A flame haired tomboy who is a skilled archer  and loves riding her horse Angus. She spends most of her time at home fussing with her mother the queen Elinors strict commands on how to be a proper princess. I didn't have a problem with this, Elinor is just trying to be a good mother and teach her daughter how to do things the right way for her own good and wellbeing. Of course Merida isn't ok with these rules of being a princess. So Merida and Elinor spend most of there time arguing with each other.

  This all really doesn't bother me because when I was going through my earlier years of puberty I was a bit of a brat too. But since then ive been having the best relationship with my mom. Mostly because she never gave in to my tantrums and stood her ground. Something sadly most parents don't do and just give in. Creating spoiled adult brats the rest of society have to deal with. I don't like to say best friends with my mom because im only 17 and shes in her 50s, but I do talk to my mom about EVERYTHING. She is the first person I go to for advice about anything. My mom is like my queen and Im her princess, shes the loving mentor I could ever want and NEED.

  But this isn't the case through Meridas eyes. Elinor informs her that she is to be betrothed to one of her father's allied clans sons. Merida doesn't like this idea of getting married to anybody and at her young age. So she throws the biggest fits from here on out. (Through out the rest of the whole film.) If I was going to be put through arranged marriage at my age, I would have a fit too. But Merida is a princess of the 10th century Scotland world. Her marriage is only for the sake of peace for her country. She could still shoot her arrows after shes married.. or maybe not. Things get even more sour when Merida yells off at her mom screaming '' I would rather die then be like you!'' and runs away for an hour. Everything is easily fixed with magic, so she goes to a witch to try and change her fate. Well this is were I get a little confused and even sick to the stomach. She basically asks the witch for a spell to CHANGE HER MOM. I thought '' woahhh what now?'' is this suppose to be the bravery we are about to see? So instead of just maybe wishing for a different fate, she specifically asks that her mother be changed. Not even Ariel from the little mermaid asked that lol.( She had the bravery to actually switch out her tailfin not change her dads opinions of the forbidden human world.) Am I really the ONLY daughter in the whole wide world who got sick at this? Merida gives her mom a CURSED CAKE and watches her mom get SICK, and all Merida says is ' YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND YET MOMMY''?! Elinor gets ill and sick from the cursed cake while her heartless daughter practically gets high hopes off of this. Elinor then turns into a bear and the rest of the movie is about how cool Merida is trying to own up to her lil mistake. And everybody is ok with that. Merida doesn't really do or change or mature into anyone. Its mostly her mother that does the changing. Well she changes her opinion on her daughter getting married and lets her off the leash. Which would have been nice... if she wasn't practically cursed in the process to learn her lesson on how to be a better mom. Merida and Elinor grow a closer bond with each other while Elinor being a bear and all, Merida even teaches her mom how to catch fish. The ending of the movie is just '' you gotta be brave enough to change your fate-destiny-mom' or something like that. At least Mulan was able to find a way to honor her family and find her true self. Pocahontas chose her people over running off with John smith. Merida... continues riding her horse and now has a great relationship with her mom. They even make a new tapestry together with Elinor being the bear...(couldnt be her in human form)

  It would have been slightly better if the movie explained how being a housewife isn't the most horrible thing that can happen to a woman, but that not all girls should be that way either.  And that whenever we have a problem with our mothers we should fix our moms. That doesn't come off as an independent brave princess to me. Sure Ariel runs away from home to go on land, but at least she didn't complain as much and just did what she wanted to do.

  I grew up watching all the princess movies. Not just the fighter princess ones like Mulan and Pocahontas but also The little Mermaid , Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and all the rest. I love and adore all kinds of girls and women. From the lovesick girly girl Princesses, to the fighter princesses taking action into her own hands.

 Today at 17 I don't feel the great need to get married to soon before the age of 25, and I don't need rescuing either. My mother is my hero. This movie kind of sends off a wrong message that your mom is the one who needs to change if you have a problem with her. Yes a parent can learn new things from their children, but the way it was done in this film.. It just doesn't sit well with me at all. If you want your daughter to feel loved and independent.. why not show her movies that does good for all us girls. Like The Little Princess and The Secret Garden from Warner Bros. Forget about those? Sure there not mother daughter flicks. But they have tons of girl power :)

1137775,1,7799133104,"How is this character a role model? Merida is born into the most privileged position in her society but rejects the accompanying obligations. Merida's mother clearly loves her but when Merida meets a strange witch she immediately purchases a spell that puts her mother's life in danger just to selfishly avoid her royal obligations. It is a mistake to judge the obligations of a historical social organization by what exists today. Other than skill at archery I saw nothing in Merida that was good. Merida's selfishness and lack of concern for society as a whole seem to epitomize what is wrong with people today. She is the bratty child of privilege like Paris Hilton. Did she do the right thing for her royal realm? No, she almost kills her mother to avoid doing the right thing. So if you want your children to disregard what is best for family and country and turn to witches and spells to break the rules this is the movie to teach that. How did this movie win an Oscar? I suspect many people who actually got to vote just read the positive press for the movie and never actually saw it. To actually watch all the Oscar contenders is an obligation a Merida would skip so maybe the Oscar voters see a kindred spirit. Wreck It Ralph should have won.",1365206400,34,1252,4.54424778761062

However, there is absolutely no doubt that the amount of smack talk, brattiness, smack talk, disrespectful attitude, etc, is rampant in the ""new"" films of today.  Fine, I understand that people say Bugs Bunny/Looney Tunes were some of the most violent cartoons ever, agreed, but it is STILL different!

1138012,3,7799133104,"I'm a bit worried about Pixar of late... they seem to be having a hard time finding their way since UP, which was followed by the overestimated TOY STORY 3, and the ""let's never mention this again"" CARS 2 ... BRAVE seemed like a shot at returning to form with a new original story.

And there is much to admire here.  The animation is, of course, outstanding - reportedly a new software upgrade was required for handling the heroine's fiery red hair, and it shows.  Pixar has yet to falter in the graphics department, and BRAVE is a stunning and beautiful film to behold!  The voice acting is typically top shelf as well, with the likes of Emma Thompson, Kelly McDonald, and Bill Connoly leading the cast.  And the underlying theme of learning how to swallow your pride and admit mistakes is a very good one to share with the youngsters.

With a strong foundation such as this, it is a shame that the movie ends up feeling so ... bland.  The problem here is that there really isn't anything new to sink your teeth into.  Perhaps we hold Pixar to too high of a standard now after one major innovative story after another.  I have long bragged over Pixar's ability to avoid the commonalities of Disney and other animated features - but here things are about as rudimentary as they come.

So how many over-worn story elements you can find here:

We have a young princess (check) who has a problem with her parents authority (check) who decides to follow her own path (check) which leads her to making a deal with a witch (check) that ends up backfiring and hurting those she loves (check), requiring her to mature in order to solve the problem (check) - but in doing so, she still ultimately kind of gets what she originally wanted (check and check).

Supposedly there was originally an intention to make this more of an adventure story of the ""good vs. evil"" kind, and you can see in the build up of the heroine how this might have been.  She is an expert archer in the medieval days of Scotland - a setting rife with possibilities for adventure.  But, midway through you can sense the script being wrested out of one pair of hands and into another as the story takes a right turn into fable territory... one wonders how this setup might have functioned as more of an adventure.

But as I said, the theme overall is a good one, and the relationship that builds between Merida and her mother is a very touching and positive one.  There is certainly a strong pro-family message here, which is always nice.

However, there are also the typical ongoing tropes that are, sadly, rampant in Disney's films of late - adult responsibility is not as important as personal freedom, men are immature idiots while woman must take up their slack, etc...

And most annoying of all, nearly every shot of the movie has to have someone bumping into something, or being hit by something, or screaming, or falling, or laughing uproariously.  It's as if the filmmakers are afraid of losing the kids' interest for a split second, so they had to dress up every shot with some overly kinetic movement.  Add to this the over-animation of the characters.  Merida cannot simply bob her head as she utters a line - she has to sweep her hair up, or fall onto a bed and then roll off, or bulge her eyes, or something... these are the elements that are common among Disney films, but have not plagued the Pixar movies of the past.

Overall, BRAVE is a passable piece of entertainment - but it quickly leaves you once you've walked away.  Enjoyable? Sure... but BEST ANIMATED FEATURE?  Hardly!  The handful of children I know of who have seen it have expressed no interest in seeing it again.  That's your target audience, Pixar - I hope you're paying attention!

I'm  not excited about Pixar continuing this year with the ""franchise development"" mentality in delivering a MONSTERS, INC prequel ... I really want to see them getting back to groundbreaking and innovative storytelling - and keeping away from the commonalities of children's animation - here's hoping the best animation studio in the business will remember it's roots!!",1364860800,23,4100,4.625690607734807

I watched Brave and I felt little again. My favorite film from Disney being The Sword in the Stone and Brave really brought me back to that old time feel. It was full of old magic and challenging fights.
I watched this with my older sister first and then again at a summer camp I was teaching at. All of my little kids  loved it. They got a kick of naked old men and were into a world where magic is real. I actually taught a lesson on it afterwards because I got so many questions about it.

My children and I had viewed it at the theatres and loved it.  At the time I subitted mt request the fees were automatically deducted from my bank account as expected.  However, afetr several attempts (days later) to track this DVD movie I was unable to do so.  I sent in a not to the seller informing them I was unable to track the movie at since I usually receive my movies within a week I was concerned on whether or not it was lost.  The seller responded within a couple of days that he would track it for me and get back with me.  On 3/19/13 (the deadline for when the movie should arrive) I still had not received the movie so I contacted the seller again this time I received no response as of today 3/29/13, nor did I receive a refund.  So I paid for a movie I never received.  This experience has truly been a bitter one.  I will never trust nor purchase anything from this seller again.  Since this I went on to purchase the movie at a store when I know I will get what I pay for.

1138511,1,7799133104,"*WARNING THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS* I just finished previewing BRAVE because I had heard good things and was considering buying it for my 8 year old niece and 6 year old nephew. I really wanted to love this film. I'm glad I watched it first. I would not consider buying this video for anyone under 12 and even then, I'm not sure it has much redeeming value at any age. Why? Several reasons.

1) MOST IMPORTANTLY, THIS FILM IS VERY VIOLENT. I can forgive lame story lines etc but there are too many violent scenes. The most upsetting violence makes up most of the second half of the movie in which a bear (the mother, under a spell) is being hunted by a mob of nobles with flames, ropes, arrows etc -- and the audience knows the bear is the child's mother. The daughter is trying frantically to save her mother.  Horrifying.  Any child watching this is going to be frightened by this and fearful that the girl's mother will be killed! Also there are a lot of scenes of rowdy Scottish clans who erupt into fighting each other when they get bored. This is almost all the father does in the film, besides hunt the bear.

2) ALSO IMPORTANT, THE HEROINE ISN'T VERY LIKEABLE OR A GOOD ROLE MODEL beyond her horsemanship, skills at archery, and of course her hair (which is beautifully animated and for most of the movie looks like a living thing -- a lovely sea anemone drifting in the current). Selfishly, she seeks a spell to transform her mother (granted, she doesn't know what the transformation will be) who is trying to get her to do something she doesn't want to do - get married (BTW, it's 2013 and women are outpacing men of the same age in education and earning power - are we still railing against marriage (even if it is arranged) as the great oppressor of women? yawn.) Why didn't she seek the spell for herself instead of her mother? When the spell goes horribly wrong, she simply does what she should do in order to save her mother's life. This doesn't seem to me to be particularly 'brave' -- just decent. She doesn't even apologize to her mother for turning her into a bear until almost the end of the movie! She spends much of the first part of the film flouncing around, running away on her horse (also beautifully animated!) and rolling her eyes at her mother and her good-natured but absent and slightly stupid father. I suspect this is to establish her 'independence' but it doesn't. She just looks like a prideful brat. That's not independence nor did she learn any.

3) OTHER BOTHERSOME BUT NON-FATAL ISSUES INCLUDE that the plot doesn't live up to the billing and is REALLY THIN. The father is a non-existent influence, the brothers are also non-persons (both disappointing because I thought this might have something more for a little boy). This girl changed her 'fate' (maybe) by nearly destroying others (her mother and her brothers who are inadvertently caught in the spell). Was there another way to get her mother to listen to her and to avoid getting married? Probably. Even if she had run away and faced some trials (maybe killed the other bear that took off her father's leg years past) that would have been better -- SHE would have suffered and grown and when she returned home it would have been believable that she had found some independence and her own path. I don't see the growth in this plot.

Also, the theme of a young princess who doesn't want to be in an arranged marriage is unlikely to be grasped by a younger child or to get their attention. The character is too young for this to be a believable storyline. She looks like she is @ 10 years old. An older princess character might have made this story line more believable. In short, I am very disappointed in this film and won't be buying it or recommending it, but if some hairstylist can figure out how to replicate that hair - then that would be something.",1364083200,14,3855,4.515759312320917

1138580,1,7799133104,"*****Warning! May contain some spoilers*****

Very disappointed with this film, especially from Pixar which has put out some gems. There was no clear moral, a sketchy plot, and minimal resolution.

The movie tries to make some vague points about changing your fate, except you can't really change your fate, only sometimes you can. It's very vague has no real purpose.

There's also this whole mother/daughter relationship dynamic which could have been done beautifully, and in fact has some good moments, but again: vague and no real purpose.

Spoiler alert! After the main character and her mother get in a fight, tearing a tapestry, the daughter finds a witch and asks for her mother to be ""changed"". The mother is cursed into becoming a bear. The given solution to the curse is to ""mend the bond"" that was broken. You'd think: ""well clearly it's a metaphor, and the mother/daughter relationship needs mending."" Wrong. For some reason the writers decide to take this extremely literally and she has to physically sew the tapestry that was broken.

Overall, the film really stretches to find some depth and meaning which at the end of the day just isn't there. Pixar films used to be a ""must see"" for me, but ""brave"" has me doubting that mentality.",1363996800,11,1250,4.877358490566038

The animation quality was to notch, as expected, nay, demanded of Disney/Pixar films. All-in-all, another terrific Disney/Pixar feature.",1363219200,,468,6.2153846153846155

The pacing is a little slow in places and the lead in to the main conflict is so predictable that a six year old could see it coming (um, be careful what you wish for when dealing with a witch/genie or other magical figures), but this is a really really good movie.",1363132800,,366,4.2898550724637685

1138933,3,7799133104,"The movie isn't bad, but it isn't my favorite Disney movie.  The story doesn't cover a wide audience.  A 10 year old boy doesn't care that a girl doesn't want to get married, but loved the parts with the trouble-making triplets. This movie shouldn't have won an Oscar in my opinion, but what can you do.",1363046400,2,303,4.392857142857143

1138935,3,7799133104,"I have heard good things about Brave, and I thought the animation was lovely, I just found the heroine to be a bit of a brat. To me she seemed quite spoiled, she was given a lot of love and attention and seemed quite privileged. She accepts all but none of the responsibility.  When it comes to being responsible, she runs away, never owning up to her actions. She wasn't compassionate, she wasn't considerate of others, and aside from shooting a bow, she didn't have a lot of talent at much of anything. I didn't find her that brave. I think this could've been written differently, so the heroine's rebellion would seem a bit more justified, and less the actions a form of tantrum. Yes, I agree, being forced to marry someone against your will is a bad custom. But so is hereditary leadership, royalty, an privilege. I didn't notice that she was all that upset about her privileged life in the castle. In fact, her and her brothers seem to take advantage of their good fortune quite often, plaguing the servants, and wrecking the kitchen. To me, she seemed quite spoiled. Rebellion against custom can be brave- but it is more brave to rebel against something that you personally benefit from. Getting upset because you are forced to marry a prince against your will, while enjoying your privileged life and more personal freedom than most people of your time.. I found it tough to sympathize with really.

This was an okay film. I liked the mother. Prolonged bits involving the mother-turned bear went on to long. Probably would not watch it again.",1363046400,3,1549,4.670329670329671

Not to mention, didn't Disney already come out with a movie where someone turns into a bear? But anyway, there are still a lot of really enjoyable things in this film and there are some incredibly humorous parts (particularly the three princes). It's a great movie to watch with your kids or without them. You should watch it!",1363046400,,424,4.592105263157895

There were a couple of slightly off-color things they could have left out of a kids movie but overall not bad.  I love the DVD / BR combo because our BR is upstairs and DVD is downstairs so we don't have to worry about the kids having to find it all the time.  We just stuck the DVD in a cd pouch that has several of their DVDs in it for downstairs and keep the case upstairs.

The story is much like Disney's ""Brother Bear"".  That's okay.  In terms of appeal, it's very kind to women and little girls, as a ""You can do anything you want to do story"".  It's interesting to see the mother/daughter relationship highlighted and built upon, and treated with respect.  Mothers and daughters may want to consider this movie for a special time together, while Dad and the boys bond over a hunting trip or trip to the local pizza parlor.",1362787200,,594,4.653846153846154

Brave is nothing like Snow White and she doesn't intend to be, despite her mother's wishes elsewise.

And like too many other stupid fairy tales, she ends up cursing her family and causing great potential harm to everyone.

1139607,3,7799133104,"Brave is a beautiful movie with great music and voice actors, but the story and characters just aren't there.

The theme of a bonding mother and daughter is a refreshing change, but the whole movie is based around this idea of self sacrifice for the greater good and a comparison between the protagonist and a mythical prince that led the country to ruin through strong feelings of entitlement, but she never changes, she's no more willing to sacrifice than she was at the beginning. The only difference is she is closer to her mother and manages to squirm out of the consequences for choosing her own happiness over duty as the story became less about the conflict of her arranged marriage and instead is about changing her mother who is turned into a bear back to a human, which she might have also tried to ignore if it wasn't for the fact that her mother would have died in the end if she had.

In Brother Bear, which was not only made first by Disney and would have made this movie redundant if they'd called it Mother Bear. The protagonist actually sacrifices his human life to make amends for the pain he caused another. If you are familiar with that movie then consider what the moral would have been if instead of changing himself, he pushed the bear cub he unknowingly wronged to change into a human instead to fix the problem and you'll understand what I took from this movie. I didn't see Brother Bear win any Oscars, but to be fair it did lose to ""Finding Nemo"".

But in this movie the protagonist doesn't change. By the end she finally listens and somewhat understands what could have been the result of her stubbornness, but she never has to make any sacrifices because the world bends to her wishes and she gets her way.

Perhaps I'm too focused on this point but it seems to be a common concept these days that a stubborn and free-willed character is a strong character. It isn't, she isn't. I found her to be unbearably annoying at times. In example, she has just given her mother magical food poisoning and even while her mother is huddling in pain, she continues to ask if she has changed her mind about the wedding. Then her mother crawls to her room and collapses and we don't see any concern or guilt we get. ""So I'll go ahead and tell them the wedding is off shall I?""

Yes, the mother and daughter had some emotional bonding. Why? Because the daughter fed her mother with a magic danish that ends up turning her into a bear and is then forced into hiding so her oblivious husband doesn't kill her from his blind vendetta against bears.

Why did the daughter ignorantly poison her mother?  Because she was being forced to marry one of three suitors, which of course all had to be baboons in some way or another to try and force the audience to pity her, instead of finding her motives selfish as they would have if the suitors had been decent people. (In fact I can't think of a single male character in this movie that wasn't a muscle-head or to put frankly, a dork.)

The mother even explains how selfish she's being and how her stubbornness could destroy their kingdom/clan. Her response from what I remember has the undertones of ""so what."" I had no problem with all of this until the end. After all, a character is supposed to work through their problems as the story goes on, but as I've made clear this doesn't happen. I was more interested in the magic and the mythical fallen kingdom than anything to do with the protagonist.

I agree we need more pro-feminist movies in a genre filled with Damsels and Prince Charmings, but this is not how you go about it. So three stars for the great soundtrack and incredible graphics and setting, but little more beyond that.

Forgive the title but in my opinion, Little Vanellope from Wreck-It-Ralph was braver and more likable than Merida and I feel Disney was pushed under the rug simply because it was Pixar that made this movie or perhaps the Video Game subject matter of Wreck-It-Ralph wasn't as refined or mature as they wanted, but from personal opinion I felt the general choice had nothing to do with the actual movies.",1362182400,,4100,4.513477088948787

1139611,4,7799133104,"I want to say that just as most other reviewers the story has its troublesome spots, while it tries to embrace the idea of a girl coming of age, it also teaches rebelliousness against parents, a big no-no, it also makes the kids seem to be smart and their parents stupid and out of touch with reality. Listen most of you at Pixar, do you have kids? I mean try to be more sensitve about such things and make parents as wise as they are, to allow the children to see that their parents are not the enemy and that peer pressure and all the dangerous stuff in the world is, like drugs, sex, violence, rebellion (when not warranted). This also goes for all the other animation companies, also the jokes were alittle over the top, tone it down please, you want to go all out make an adult movie, leave our kids out of that stuff until they are out of the house and make their own decisions, you know what i mean?
  Now as for the good, the animation is just eye popping, i mean you are reaching a higher and higher level of visual excellence that is stunningly gorgeous, well done also the bear is the most beautifully rendered and terrifying bear probably in animation history only the bear in over the hedge comes to mind but this one takes the crown. The excitement is very intense, well don, but it will scare some of the children even the 8 year olds maybe. THe lighting, the surround sound all top notch as is to be expected from Pixar.
  Please continue to give us great films of this calibur but do be mindful of the above comments and please include a moral to the story that can carry on for years to come, positive and worth their weight in gold. Wall-e did give a good message about being green and its consequences which i hope we will all find ways to avoid. Corporate Greed is lazy it doesn't care how it gets what it wants, its irresponsible will not accept being held accountable for anything.
  We need companies made up of responsibly minded scientist, developers CEO's etc., to force other less responsible companies into the beat of the drum or off the side of the ship. Use texting to spread the news about being economically and environmentally responsible consumers, purchase only productst that are safe and don't damage the environment, everyone wants this, while including a perfect blend of being sensitive to the communitie, its needs, its workers, job proctection etc., and that will donate to the starving children, save the forest and endangered animals while helping the populace nearby and spreading awareness, educating as you move forward. It begins with children movies as well, set the right tone and you never have to look back or there won't be a future to look forward to or even worse, that the future our children will inherit will be a disgrace and the shame of our generation. Dont just read this and forget it, read it and make a stand, make a change, do something everyday to help us change this thing around and make the world a better place, a peaceful place because it can all be so beautiful.",1362182400,,3037,4.502722323049002

movie. Lovely movie but cartoon-ish in story line.  Too bad. The good thing, we agreed, is that we didn't spend the
going rate of approximately $15.00 each to see it in the theater.  We really wanted to love this movie, but the
best we can say is that, all told, it's okay.  We will save it for it's visual beauty for her baby to watch when he

It was well done, with a strong story line, good, believable characters, an adventure that will keep you watching, a struggle between good and evil, both internal and external.

There are lots of sly jokes for the adults, which were truly funny. All the males in the film are treated like bumbling simpletons, which is a pernicious but officially sanctioned form of sexism today. I was willing to overlook it here, because the story was such a good one. The true story of the making of this film is a cautionary tale, because Brenda Chapman, the person who conceived this story based on her relationship with her daughter, started as the director of the film, but was shut out from the final product. Doesn't seem fair, but that is the way they do business in the movies.

*slight spoiler*

There's no handsome prince (though Merida's suitors are presented like a comedically-horrible round of first dates), and I thought I would miss the romance aspect. But by the middle of the movie I was like ""Eh, ain't nobody got time for that-- we've got to fight Mordu and change our fates!!""

  Brave is a Disney film that has a Princess that doesn't care about love which hasn't been done by them before. But that doesn't mean it deserved an Oscar due to that. I think Tangled was a better animated comedy by Disney and that wasn't even nominated. Looking at the trailer for Brave, I expected a stronger film from Pixar that we just didn't get.

Sure,it may be a little predictable, but the message is purely good, unlike the defiant boy chasing and desperation in the other princess movies, this centers on family and overcoming pride, in the age old struggle between mother and teen daughter.

It has it's typical Disney theme were the main character learns a very important lesson by the end of the movie, which Merida does.  But aside from the life lesson she learns the real reason I love this movie is that the main character is a woman and that she is not some helpless princess like some of them are in the Disney movies.  She writes her own fate.  She is Katniss Everdean in the world of Disney animation.  And if that is something that you want to teach your kids then you must own this movie.

I just wasn't sure if it was for a audience that is DEFINETELY not a fan of princesses. But my mind was changed one day. I was walking through Walmart in crestview and was about to see if they had Brave. It was nowhere to be seen! I asked the assisstant of electronics and he told me that it was the most requested item in the USA. And after looking at Amazon reviews ( 5 STARS!! ) I figured I shoul see it.

In an attempt to change her mother, with the aid of a woodcarving witch, her mother is changed into a bear.  The rest of the movie is a journey of discovery as mother and daughter grow closer, trying to undo the spell before it's made permanent.  It's funny, it's moving, overall its a good time.

1140676,5,7799133104,"I loved Brave from start to finish. It is most likely my number one movie for 2012. The storyline is very good, the scenes are breathtaking, and the movie in a whole brings you into the story. Disney and Pixar did a top notch job on this movie. I still cannot get over how beautiful the animated scenes are. Brave had a great storyline to it, and everything about it was very good. My little sister who is 12 loved Brave, but I think I actually liked it more. Great job Disney. The characters were all very good in the movie, and the voices matched perfectly to the characters.",1360627200,2,577,4.302752293577981

Color, animation, music and acting is great. It's just the culmination wasn't mind-blowing like the rest.

1140753,4,7799133104,"My daughter received this UCE as a 2012 Xmas present, but we just got around to watching it over last weekend. That's probably because she's turning 16 in March, and she's right on the cusp of outgrowing the appeal of most Disney heroine films (I remember her wanting to see this movie when it was released in theaters in June, 2012, but she never did see it in the theater, and seemed none the worse for it.) In the world of the high school sophomore, last year's priorities can become this year's ""meh"" overnight!

It turns out that the movie has a level of maturity to it that worked very well for my soon-to-be-sweet-sixteen daughter. From a parenting perspective, I had no problem with the few ""adult"" bits that were tossed in, as they were sufficiently humorous and sufficiently brief as to not be off-putting. This is pretty tame stuff by any measure.

Overall, I enjoyed the film as well, though the story isn't very inventive as stories go. Within the first 15 minutes one can begin predicting what will occur later in the story line. I was happy to see that Disney avoided adding too many contemporary references or characters to the film (Merida's mom tells her to ""stop doodling"" in one scene), as such playing to the gallery can become dated in short order (think ""The Emperor's New Groove,"" or Robin Williams' Genie in ""Aladdin,"" whose ad naseum references to circa 1980s pop culture are lost on audiences 20 years later). I can see ""Brave"" becoming a family evergreen, watched each year around St Patrick's Day, along with ""Darby O'Gill & The Little People"" and ""The Quiet Man,"" even though ""Brave"" is set in Scotland, not Ireland.

The animation is just spectacular - ""Brave"" just won the 2013 Oscar for animation, in fact. The only complaint I have is the complaint I have about most of Disney's recent animated films: things sometimes move too fast, no doubt a sop to pacing their films to a contemporary tempo that will compete with the explosion-laden video games that are so popular these days.

Another Academy Award-winning film from Disney/Pixar, though not - I suspect - the kind of film that will garner the repeat viewings the more-traditional Disney fare seems to enjoy, let alone earning a place in posterity in the form of a theme ride at one of Disney's Amusement Parks.

Four stars.",1360540800,,2314,4.717821782178218
1140754,5,7799133104,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoy this movie. I read new software was used to make Merida's hair more life like and it worked. Her hair is what made me fall in love with her right from the beginning. The story itself is not what I expected. Without spoiling the story, this movie is not simply a teenager rebelling against her parents. It may start that way but stick with it and I think both sides can learn something from the story, especially parents (and I am an adult saying this). And of course there is fun mixed in with a serious message. The triplets are hysterical, I just want to hug them as I shake my head at them. They are like a puppy - so cute you can't stay mad at them. I haven't watched the blu-ray version yet but the dvd picture is crisp and clear. This is a top notch movie from head to tail. Something you can enjoy with the entire family, even if you have to tie down the teenagers I think they will enjoy it. Merida has a spunky spirit that I think many teenage daughters can relate to. I think I would if I was a teenager again.",1360540800,,1067,4.110047846889952

My daughter can get scared easily and is sensitive.  I watched the movie with my kids.  Are there some scary parts, yes, is it anything more than any other Disney movie, NO.
Brave is a very cute movie with a different plot than most Disney Princess movies.  I like that it is not a love story.
It does have some nudity (if you can even call it that) Her little brothers it shows their behinds, and the mother says she is naked but they don't show anything.  I was a bit surprised when I saw the scenes, but it did not adversely affect the movie in my opinion.
A great movie for all ages!!",1360454400,,718,4.0928571428571425

It is an inspiring movie suitable for both little girls and boys, but there are some scary parts that might be too much for younger kids - you will have to use some judgement about the monster scenes.

1140838,3,7799133104,"Visually, ""Brave"" is stunning, with the usual excellent soundtrack and voices expected of such movies these days.  But what's it about?  Damned if I know.

The heroine is a willful, capable young woman who can outride, outshoot and outthink nearly everyone she comes in contact with.  Her mother annoys her, however, so what does she do?  She seeks out a witch, who transforms her mother into a non-speaking bear.  Then what happens?  A bunch of stuff that doesn't really amount to a hill of beans.

Maybe I just didn't get ""Brave"", because I'm not a kid.  But I've loved nearly every other CGI animated movie of this type, and this one left me cold.  If you're looking for a saga of a young woman using her heroic gifts and achieving great things, I believe you'll be disappointed.  I frankly think ""Tangled"" is a better movie involving billowing hair.",1360454400,,853,4.695945945945946

And what a great picture of Scottish quirkiness. The characters voiced by real life Scots have a great sense of fun and disregard for social conventions. They are focused on having a good time, competing fiercely, and rolling with whatever punch comes their way.  Not to mention the amazing graphics which make Merida's hair an unbelievable work of interesting art.  I loved this movie!",1360022400,,563,4.480392156862745

The characters are fun, the story line inspiring and eye-opening and the graphics and animation are top notch.

A beautiful movie with humor, lessons, and fun for both boys and girls, moms and dads.",1359849600,,460,4.464285714285714

1141454,3,7799133104,Great price for this collection. Love listening to the lilt in the voices. Storyline good. Merida caused the problem but at least she fixed it. Merida wasn't the most respectful child but she did come full circle and learn.,1359849600,,223,4.743589743589744

My daughter loves the Disney princesses but I am so tired of all the story lines revolving around them trying to find and marry princes. This has all of the great Pixar animation and dialogue but with a strong heroine who just wants to go on her own path. A couple of scenes may be scary for younger  kids, but for the most part it is the perfect princess story. I hope to see more of these in the future.",1359849600,,479,4.085106382978723

1141458,3,7799133104,"While the animation is striking, it is kind of dark material and the accents the characters have can make it hard to understand to a child.  I am not saying the movie was bad, but I think the animators focused to much on how everyone's hair looked and moved and not enough on the content.  I have said this before, but this movie couldn't hold a candlestick next to movies like Paranorman, which is a little dark, but you kind of know that by the title.  Brave is a nice little movie, but it is forgettable.",1359849600,,507,4.260416666666667
1141459,1,7799133104,"This movie does not herald virtue. It promotes vice. In one moment, it says that pride is the problem that causes all the turmoil in her family. Then, it says that ""I must choose MY own fate"", thus promoting pride! The only person who changes is the mom, but not the child. Long-standing family and cultural traditions, as well as the wisdom of elders is mocked in this movie, in exchange for doing ""what I want"" and ""following my heart"". Where's the chivalry in that?

Moms, if you want your daughters to learn how to talk back to you and become more selfish, have them watch this movie.

Dads, if you want your children to see you as nothing more than a buffoon with no real authority, have them watch this movie.

I'm disappointed with Pixar. They had set a standard for classy movies, but this felt more like Shrek to me. Want your kids to see images of bare backsides and cleavage? It's all in this ""family"" movie. Tasteless humor, and promoting selfishness with no lasting consequences.",1359763200,18,992,4.561797752808989

Its a fantasy, so who cares if it appears that in her short life neither of her parents mentioned that she was to be married to one of three local clan Princes when she comes of age.

In a comedy of unintended consequences she navigates her way helped by her silent brothers, a delightful witch, (oops I mean wood carver) and her well meaning parents.

The only problem is that Pixar has risen the bar so high for themselves that this movie does not compare to some of the greats story-wise. It lacked a little in the general overall story and character development that existed in most of the other movies.

Animated films set in Scotland are not common.  The young heroine, Merida, won my sympathy right away, and I wanted her to come out on top.  All in all, it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, even for a 79-year-old man.  My only complaint was that some of the dialogue in the Scottish brogue was very difficulty to understand.  I would recommend checking to see if subtitles are available on the DVD.",1359072000,,563,4.41747572815534

(Anyone who thinks Ariel is a model for how young women should behave needs their head examined.)  So it was refreshing to find a Disney movie in which the lead female DOESN'T think that sacrificing all to chase after marriage to a handsome man is the best thing ever.  Merida is passionate, talented, opinionated, bold (and, yes, ""brave""), and absolutely willing to stand up for her right to determine her own fate and not have it dictated by tradition.  She's the Disney princess that doesn't want to marry anyone yet.  It's one of the few recent Disney movies we don't mind letting our daughters watch.",1359072000,,754,4.769230769230769

1142310,5,7799133104,"I do not understand the negative reviews of this movie at all. Personally, I think it's Pixar's best movie to date! I think the message is great for children and parents alike. Both of the main characters change and that's the point. Merida learns that her selfishness leads to nothing but destruction and Elanor learns that she isn't always in the right. The graphics are beautifully fantastic and even though there are some dark moments, there are also some funny ones to even it out.

As for the marriage issue, I like where the story leads. In most Disney movies, the princess is always seeking to be married and for the man to save her. Merida isn't ready and wants to grow up a little before she gets married, as do the suitors. It seems appropriate for this day and age, when everyone is trying to hook up as quickly as possible.

Overall, this is a wonderful movie and I highly recommend it.",1358985600,,899,4.50920245398773

The music isn't as good, and the second half of the movie dragged quite a bit. I thought the story line was a bit outlandish, even for a fairy tale, and somewhat confusing.  I'd recommend renting this one first to make sure you like it - wish I had done so & saved the $20.

1142488,5,7799133104,"I was very unsure about this movie after having heard and read some reviews. I wasn't sure if it was appropriate content for my 4 year old daughter. So, we rented it and enjoyed it enough to buy this 3 pack.

1. This is NOT a typical Disney princess movie. My husband LOVED this the first time we watched it. There is a lot of boy humor in it which my daughter now enjoys. There is no boy she falls in love with and she does not get married in the end. The story is about her and her mother. It's a beautiful story.

2. The bear scenes are not as scary as I thought they would be. Despite Merida turning her mother into a bear, her mother still acts like her mother - mannerisms and all. It's very funny and entertaining. There is another bear that is scary and those scenes are a bit sketchy but I would compare them to the wolf scenes in Beauty & the Beast. There is some witchcraft involved (as in most Disney movies) but it wasn't enough to bother me (unlike The Princess and the Frog which I think was horrible).

3. The animation is fantastic and Merida is beautiful, especially her hair!

4. The musical score is one of the best I've heard in a Disney movie. I would buy the CD in a heartbeat.

Overall, I would highly recommend this movie for 4 and up. I think it may be too scary for kids younger than that and some of the boy humor may not be appropriate. The more I watch it, the more I love it. It's really a great movie!",1358899200,,1433,4.085409252669039

It was a bit too violent for her age, even with the kooky sound effects meant to lighten the mood, and I'm fairly sure the symbolism of the bond that needed mending went straight over her head despite my explanation. The characters are appealing and the animation top notch. ""Brave"" is no ""Beauty and the Beast,"" and certainly doesn't have the adult appeal of ""Aladdin,"" but I liked seeing a girl making her own decisions and an adolescent struggling to balance her desire for independence against responsibility to her family and community.",1358899200,,625,4.743119266055046

Instead two of the main characters are piggy-backing one another throughout the whole film. They do not take a journey to a far off land to find the crystal sword that will push the protagonist to discover some profound meaning to life and become protector of her land. Instead the main scenes mostly take place in the castle and the nearby wood.

The moral component of this story is humility over pride and love over control.  Some of the ideas were really good and the graphics were incredible, but the story is so disjointed and incomplete that it brings the movie down - way down.

1142727,2,7799133104,"We were searching for a relatively recent kids film to watch with our 10 year-old and she recommended Brave from the TV commercials she had seen last year. Well, what a disappointment!  The message re mother-daughter relatins got completely obscured by the ludicrous fighting scenes (apparently they were supposed to be funny?).  The worst was the scene where the bear/mother was tied and trapped in preparation for slaughter.  A children's film?  Did anyone really enjoy this film?",1358812800,,482,5.220779220779221
1142728,1,7799133104,"I couldn't believe how horrible this was.

The movie is only about Princess Merida and her Mother, the other characters are minor. Neither Merida nor her mom knew how to listen to anyone, each always expected to get her own way.

Merida is a Princess, a member of the Royal Family.  She sees that as something to escape from.  Royalty are the richest, most connected and most powerful people in her country, and she hates it.

Beyond that the movie shows marriage as something to fight against - something to fear and oppose.  It backs up the presumption by having Merida's suitors be physically weak and mentally inadequate - in other words, beneath her.  Beyond that Merida herself chooses the means by which they were supposed to show their worth, and she deliberately chose a means in which she could out do all of them.

After that she flees into the forest - runs away from home.

Merida meats a Witch in woods and buys a spell.  She wants to curse her own mom.  The curse was on a cake, which turns her mom into a bear.  Afterwards Merida just leaves the cake laying around, she leaves a cursed cake behind.  Which her brothers eventually find and eat.

Merida's reaction to the transformation was blame the Witch, she just kept saying "" It's not my fault""  She'd bought the spell, and gave it to her mom, but refused to show responsibility for her actions.

Merida then learns that her 3 younger brothers also ate the cake, turning them into bear cubs.  She'd just found out she'd cursed her brothers as well as her mom.  Her reaction was disgusting. she wasn't hurt or afraid or even shocked -  she was angry, at them!  She felt no guilt over what had happened to them.

Her dad finds her mom's cloths shredded and her room destroyed, by a bear.  He sets out to avenge his wife.  That should be a great and honorable intent, but the movie's content make it look stupid.  This shows her dad trying to kill his wife, Magic curses or not - that is horrible.  Merida arrives in time to save her mom - Saying ""I won't let you kill my Mother"".  She had to fight her dad, that's beyond horrible.

At the end Merida broke the curse by, finally, admitting that it had been her fault.  So her suitors were sent away. She cursed most of her family, and nearly got her mom killed - so for that she gets what she'd wanted.  She's rewarded and considered a heroine for just undoing the catastrophe she caused.

It's hard to believe children are even allowed to watch this, much less encouraged to.",1358812800,37,2492,4.437086092715232

1142764,5,7799133104,"Finally, a beautiful story about a young girl that isn't all about falling in love and getting a man! I mean, really, we need to stop teaching our daughters this! And Brave begins with this independent sassy girl who hates being prim and proper, would much rather be a tomboy and shoot arrows and ride her horse. She's still a girl and just not ready to grow up. She reminds me so much of my  daughter, Ella.

Spoilers Alert Ahead, scroll to bottom to avoid!

So when her parents announce she will be married off to keep the peace between the Kingdoms, she is beyond unhappy. Merida doesn't want to be a PRINCESS, let alone a WIFE. Her mother just won't listen, and her mother, the Queen, thinks Merida just won't listen, either, as peace is at stake if she doesn't comply. Neither understands the other.

When the suitors arrive, her parents announce only the firstborn from each royal family may shoot for Merida's hand in marriage, which gives Merida a great idea. Being the excellent marksman, or girl, that she is, she announces after everyone has gone, and shot poorly, that she will be shooting for her own hand.

This is one of my favorite scenes as she really defies her mother here, publicly, while rejecting all her suitors and standing up for herself and what she wants. Of course, her and mom get into a major fight, in which the Queen tosses Merida's precious bow into the fireplace, breaking her daughter's heart and sending Merida running from her home on horseback in tears.

Soon, she discovers a witch, whom she begs for the power just to change her mother. Merida hopes this will change her mind about the whole marriage and be done with, things can go back to normal. The witch gives her a tart to feed the Queen, promising her mom will change.

What Merida doesn't expect is that her mom changes into a bear, the very animal her father hates the most for taking his leg. The witch promised her a change, but her mom changes physically, not internally, like Merida expected. Fearing the King won't understand or believe his wife is a bear and may try to kill her, Merida and her mother flee the kingdom.

They of course return to the witches Hut to no avail, she simply left a message about fixing what has come undone by the next day or permanently becoming a bear, but the witch herself is gone.

Frustrated, guilty and sad, Merida tries to care for her mother and apologizes as they make do I'm the wild. It is entertaining to watch as the prim and proper queen turned bear tries to keep her manners about her while in her new form.  She makes eating utensils from branches, just to have them fling about. She tries to slowly eat fish at first, making Merida cook it, before impatience kicks in and it isn't long before she is ravishing fish cold and alive with get bear claws.

The two begin to share and form a new bond as her mother lives as a bear in the wild with Merida, doing things and learning things from her daughter.  Merida, in contrast learns more about the different Kingdoms and their fall as they stumble upon another bear, this one once human also, cursed like her mother,a part of what she thought was just a fairytale proved to be true. Merida finally sees the importance of all the Kingdoms uniting, and her role in it, when she realizes how they came apart; with this one brother, power hungry to control them all, became a beast. This bear who took her fathers leg.

Thinking they must return home to repair a tapestry, they sneak back into their castle, where they find everyone growing more restless. Merida decides to announce her decision, but her mother, posing as a bear statue at the back of the room, redirects her otherwise. Finally understanding one another, through time spent and a bond deeper than any ocean, this mother and daughter love each other so much.

By the end of this movie, I had shed more than a few tears and was glad just me and my daughter were watching it together the first time. She came and sat on my lap in the theatre, she's six and doesn't often do that, so I think it affected her greatly, too. When it came out I managed to get it on Black Friday and put it up for her for xmas, along with a few other Brave goodies. Ella was thrilled, she loves the movie so much, she's watched it almost every day following xmas the first week and often since then. She took the regular dvd copy to her dads so she could continue watching it there.

Such a brilliant movie, and I was thrilled it didn't revolve around romantic love for a change, as that seems shoved down kids throats these days with Disney princess'and all, not that we dislike those movies, this was just VERY refreshing and heartwarming and a great mother/daughter movie that we continue to enjoy and love together.

Ostensibly the tale of a rebellious princess, the underlying messages of love, family, self-esteem and, especially, mother-daughter relations are not just for children. Everyone can benefit from the thoughts behind one of the best-animated movies I've ever seen. The young princess's hair is so real you can touch it, and that kind of detail is in every single frame! And I wonder if the animators had actors in mind when they drew the characters, so fine is the fit of appearance and voice. Kelly Macdonald as Merida and Billy Connolly as King Fergus are incomparable!

If you have children, especially girls, you owe it to them to buy this movie. And if you don't have children, you owe it to YOURSELF to buy this movie! :)",1358380800,,758,4.734848484848484

She was 7 when she saw it and she LOVED it, so I bought it for her and her sisters for Christmas. There was too much fighting, but the men never got hurt and were able to turn from fighting to buddies over and over. I think it's a guy thing. In fact, this movie is probably good for both genders as both will laugh!

Although perhaps it wasn't as ""deep"" or manipulative-of-the-audience's-emotions as most Pixar films of late, as a Disney Princess movie it was absolutely fantastic! I haven't liked any of the ""Disney Princess""es since Belle, not enough that I'd want any of my nieces around them. Merida is a spunky young lady, as strong-headedly independent and moody as any teenage girl. She runs away, finds a witch, hijinks ensue, and we have a fun story about finding the value in one's family that they've forgotten. It's got a moral to it without being preachy, which I really quite enjoyed. Mom was flawed, but it was a flaw of love, and there wasn't even really any ""bad guy"" in my opinion. It was about personal growth, and one's journey.

I really quite enjoyed it. It wasn't a deep intellectual film; it's just a story about a young lass coming of age. But it was a satisfying story, well-told, with nice art and music. Planning on purchasing a copy. Do see it!",1358294400,2,1002,4.693181818181818

I have seen women of this programming closed fist strike a guy 200 lbs heavier than them, not fat, and not understand why the open hand strike they received back was so powerful. Never would I encourage the striking of a woman, but movies like this are the reasons scenarios like that happen. every human being is limited, women, far beyond most men in multi-tasking, are not physically built like men. Other than having a cliche plot, with a bunch of bumbling cowardly men, and a downgraded demonized stay at home mom, this movie really failed to impress me with Pixars real capabilities, like what we see in Finding Nemo and How to Train a Dragon.",1358208000,3,761,4.644444444444445

The most noticeable aspect about this film (like other Pixar movies) is the animation. I was blown by the High Definition resolution. There was a part in the film in which it appeared to be like it was live-action. While watching the film, the audience may find the Merida's hair to appear just like real human hair. The vivid colors with keep your eyes glued to the television. Also, the story is pretty interesting. Since this is a family movie, people might believe it has the same traditional plot as other films. Brave delivers an interesting synopsis and keeps the audience engaged. The film has a pretty decent score as well. The music is not as great as other Disney films, but still good. Also, the special features include two magnificent Pixar shorts. Pixar shorts are amazing as all the previous ones before: stunning resolution! After watching the film, I would recommend watching the short ""The Legend Of Mordu"" (in the bonus content).

1143423,2,7799133104,"I was really excited for this film to come out. I love Pixar films and the animation was so beautiful. The idea of an independent Scottish princess was also very attractive to me since I like strong female characters and the Celtic cultures. However, the film just lacked plot. The concept is similar to Brother Bear, but not nearly as moving. Merida is independent and rebellious, but not really in an inspiring way like Pocahontas or Mulan were. She's actually a bit of a brat. I understand not wanting to marry when you're not in love and I think that's a worthy cause, but she's outright awful to her mother. It's not just back-talking, either. She carelessly gives her mother an enchanted tart that a witch said would ""change her fate,"" without having any thought into what the consequences might be. So then the consequences are bad and the rest of the movie is focused on fixing her mistake while also rekindling ties with her mother. In the end it's cute and happy, but not as satisfying as most Pixar films.

Overall, the film is okay. I just expected a more interesting plot from Pixar, but instead it seemed like a bad copy of another film. It was a shame to waste such gorgeous animation. Merida's hair was awesome.",1358208000,4,1227,4.602739726027397

1143549,5,7799133104,I thought Brave was an incredible movie. It shows how a parent and child can butt heads yet still really love each other. My 7 year old and 5 year old were scared by the movie. They both are to a point that they understand death is final or a friend moving away is extremely sad. Watching the daughter beg her mother not to leave her was incredibly sad for my boys. They did not want to watch the movie again. My husband and I loved the movie because it showed our sons that we would go to the ends of the earth and beyond for them.

However, attempting to stream through Amazon Instant Video and a Roku player produced Audio and Video that were out of synch. Worse, I contacted Amazon the day we purchased the stream (in November) and it has taken the ""support team"" TWO MONTHS to attempt to ""fix"" the issue. I have received three form emails telling me that the technical support team is still working on this issue. I guarantee that a company like Amazon should not be struggling to fix a technical synch issue. So far, there has been no refund of my $5 to purchase the jobby stream or any attempt to give a coupon or discount for a future stream.

1143634,4,7799133104,"This movie is clever, funny, exciting, and of a quality rarely seen overall, let alone in animated releases marketed with youths in mind.  The only reason I put 4 stars is because this movie was made by Pixar, and this isn't a 5 star Pixar movie. In any other context, yes, 5 stars, no problem.  But this movie fails to reach the (extremely high) standards set by Pixar's greatest.

Should you see this movie? Yes. It's brilliantly paced, extremely funny, and has two shining examples of strong female protagonists with both Merida and her mother. Will it make you cry like Up did? Probabally not.  Does it take risks with the format of storytelling like Wall-E did? Nope; in fact, the plot is fairly predictable for an adult, though children might be taken by some of the twists. Still, while this isn't Pixar's greatest film, it's likely better than most of the other movies you'll see from 2012, and one of the best animated ones. If you're like me, this came and went at the theaters without catching it. Now's your chance--it really is worth the rental or purchase.",1358121600,5,1070,4.645502645502646

I was hoping that maybe it was the accent that he liked and this would add some variety to our viewing.  Turns out it was the accent that he liked and the the three ""princes"" entertain him greatly.  It also turns out that I learned this is one of the most beautiful stories ever put in a movie (let alone animated).  There is something for everyone.

The jokes, the characters, the story beats, all so familiar and predictable that it's hard not to feel a little disappointed. The first trailers and images of this film really gave me the impression that Pixar was trying to push their story telling boundaries a little harder, but not so. It's an enjoyable film, beautiful designs and color work, great animation as always... but nothing out of the ordinary for Pixar. They took no chances at all I'm afraid.

You can imagine what it means to her to be able to watch it at will.  The best part is that I'm not bored with it yet myself.  Just watching Merida's hair and imagining how that was created in the studio is worth the price of the DVD.  The story itself is spellbinding for all ages.

That is to say, none that don't get ""saved"" by Men within the movie.  Mulan was the closest perhaps.  But think about it, in must female lead animated movies, even the heroine gets rescued or saved by a man.  Why not give the girls a real role model.  Merida (spelling?) comes really really close.  Not the best Pixar effort, but the subject content is good, and our girls Love it.  That along make it worth it.",1357776000,,534,4.422680412371134

That said, Brave has gone a long way in redeeming Disney in my eyes. I rented it mostly because it features three of my favorite actors with Emma Thompson doing a lovely job as Queen Elinore and Billy Connelly as King Fergus and Julie Walters as the Witch. Kelly MacDonald is spot on as Merida and Craig Ferguson and Robbie Coltrane are wonderful, as always. It's visually stunning and the celtic music is wonderful. The story is as unbelievable as...well, Sherik, but hey it is a cartoon, ( I mean ""animated feature"")~eye roll~.

I love the break from new-traditional fairy tales where everything is happy and perfect. Brave feels real. And who can help but love impulsive but good-willed Merida?

I've been a Disney fan as a child and seen almost every animated movie they have made. This is by far one of my favorites. Probably because the story isn't about happiness and finding ""true love"" but about happiness, family and understanding. Merida is a character worth looking up to and we see both her and her mother grow in the span of the movie.

1144327,3,7799133104,"So, I'm not sure what they were collectively smoking when they chose to make the Scottish Disney Princess film into a bear movie (pretty sure Disney already did this concept in Brother Bear), but that's what Brave is.

It is beautiful to look at.  The story is cute.  The personality of the princess is adorable.  Her hair is the star of the film...and it is wonderful.  She doesn't run off with a prince she's known for 3 days at the end of the movie to live happily ever after.

That's the good stuff.  Now, for the bad:

The film is a rehash of Brother Bear with a girl instead of a boy and with a parent relationship rather than a sibling.  There is no discernible moral in the story, really, except a horribly written attempt at admonishing mothers to ""just listen"" to their recalcitrant adolescent daughters.  Stupid moral.

It's worth watching.  Kids will love it.  It's gorgeous.  The brothers in the story are funny.  But...it's not going to be one of the Disney greats.",1357603200,4,979,4.545977011494253

This is one animated movie that is easy to get lost in because the story is so different from all the other princess stories out there. I loved it and so did the whole family.

There were some funny moments but it was very slow moving and not what we were looking for.

1144557,2,7799133104,"I was looking forward to this movie as a father of two girls, because there are not enough children's movies with female leads especially non-princess female leads, and until now Pixar has always made excellent and touching movies (or at least enjoyable when in the case of Cars 2). I thought Pixar could make a movie about a female lead where the plot doesn't revolve around whether or not she gets married but apparently not. There are decisions that women face throughout their lives other than whether or not to marry. I also assumed that they could give a female character the lead while having respectable male supporting characters but they couldn't. Every single male character in this movie is a physically deformed half-wit mutant. The only halfway like able male characters are Merida's father and brothers and they're still portrayed as immature morons. The brothers are barely portrayed as humans. They never speak and spend the entire movie stealing food and never show any emotional reaction to any of the bizarre events that freak out everyone else.  At one point they get turned into bears but nothing about them changes except for they grow fur. The previews made it look like an epic adventure but most of the movie takes place in the castle and most of the action is comedic misunderstandings and deceptions. What I thought was going to be an epic adventure starring a female lead turned out to be a cliched 90's girl power comedy of errors.

If the movie had only been disappointing then I would have given it 3 stars but there was far to much nudity in it for me to consider it appropriate for small children. In one scene we several men's butts for several seconds and in another we see Merida's brothers butts. My children did not think this was shocking. They actually thought it was funny which is a problem in my opinion. It is very difficult to explain context to children. They see nudity in a cartoon as comedy their going to think that nudity in other situations is comedy too and I doubt very many people consider a man exposing his butt to children as comedy. Most people would consider him a pervert and he could go to prison and be registered as a sex offender for the rest of his life. My wife and I already have a hard enough time trying to convince our daughters that exposing their butts to us is inappropriate without Disney and Pixar telling them it's comedy. Luckily our girls haven't  exposed themselves at school to get a laugh but as more cartoons show nudity as comedy more kids will expose themselves in public thinking that makes them funny.

Brave isn't the only children's cartoon to do this either. Why is it every children's cartoon that shows someone's butt for comedy shows a man's or boy's butt. Brave seemed to try very hard to come up with situations to show every male character naked and to cover up the female character the one time she would have been naked. Why is male nudity comedy gold while female nudity is inappropriate?",1357516800,4,2988,4.653409090909091

What we love the most about Pixar is how intelligent, heartfelt, and truly funny their movies are.  They never stoop down to potty humor for easy laughs.  Well, Brave is not the Pixar we know and love.  It is Disney's Pixar:  more generic, more lowbrow, more mass-market.  I was actually a little bored watching it.  There's potty humor and naked butts, too.  Definitely not the Pixar that created the masterpieces Up, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo.  I hope their next movie is a winner.

1144623,5,7799133104,"Have you ever considered how rare a mother is in a Disney animated film? Usually there is no mother or she is killed off quickly. This story might explain why because the teen's wish is that her mother would change so she could be free to become the woman she desires. She gets her wish by placing her mother in danger. This movie gets so much about teens right, including the normal self-absorption, lack of responsibility and wild pendulum swings between child and woman. The story encourages parents to nurture their daughter's strengths, not just their traditions. The girl's hair is practically a character in its own right so much time is spent on its rendering, just as it is in most teen girl's lives.

If you're of Celtic background this will be a particular delight. There are stereotypes of Celtic behavior, but how do you ground a cultural story without them?

Regardless, the movie was funny, charming, very colorful and vibrant and nicely animated.

1144762,5,7799133104,"I watched the movie Brave with my family and we all really enjoyed it.  Be sure to grab a box of tissues beforehand as there are some tear jerking scenes.  The story is about a queen who is training her daughter into becoming a princess and according to tradition, a prince is selected to marry the princess upon proving himself through competitions.  The princess wants her own freedom to choose and fights with her mother on this.  She symbolically tears her mother out of the family by cutting a tapestry with the family in it and seeks a witch to help her mother change.  Her mother does change, but not her heart, rather she becomes a bear.  The story is a lesson of choosing freedom over tradition.  It is also about a love shared between family members that is unbreakable since Merida instantly regrets what she did to her mother and will go to any lengths to bring her back.  The movie is action packed.  Unlike many of the Disney princess movie, this one lacks on the romantic side, however this only adds to the movies uniqueness.  It is more family based than romantic based.  Very good movie to watch with the family.",1357344000,,1130,4.517241379310345

Well, she does have hair. Big hair. But I thought they did hair pretty well in Monsters Inc. And if you're really worried about getting good hair, don't pick a huge mass of red curls (that's going to look animated just because it's outrageously red), pick slightly curled brown hair that reacts the the moisture in the air by frizzing halfway through the day.

The problem is this movie has zero of the charm of movies like Snow White, none of the fun characters, ridiculous 'According to Jim'-like portrayals of the majority of males, and an incredible lack of a real powerful villain such as we saw in past movies like Little Mermaid. It's too bad as it wastes Pixar's best visual effort, full of sprawling landscapes and great rendering on the main character's wild hair. After the mess of Cars 2 (and Cars 1 for that matter) it's unfortunate that Pixar is going in the wrong direction, but hey at least now people can stop whining that they haven't had a female lead in any of their movies.",1357344000,5,939,4.875

1144944,5,7799133104,"If you haven't seen this movie, but just heard the hype so far, you will not be disappointed.  That was me last year until I saw it for the first time after a friend loaned me hers.  My daughters are 3 and 1, my step daughter is almost 18, and my husband is almost 38, and we all love it!  My 3 year old has discovered the princess world and I was not overly excited about the negative stereotypes surrounding Disney 'beauty' and the role of a girl as a princess.  Disney impressed me with this movie and not just because of the graphics and soundtrack (we have downloaded several MP3's, the music is absolutely beautiful) but because they finally created a strong female character that denounces marriage to choose her own path and the family dynamics are quality and heartfelt.  As a mom, I cried.  It's a story mainly about a mother and a daughter and it's amazing.  We laugh every time because the humor is funny and age appropriate but still makes us adults laugh as well.  I never object when they request this move (we have one in the car and the other in the house DVD player) because I enjoy it just as much.  This particular one was a great price and it comes with both a regular DVD and a blu-ray disc.  Definitely recommend this :)",1357257600,,1243,4.341991341991342

However, the blue-ray disc (""regular"", not the 3-D version) has a spot in it where the movie gets ""stuck"".  I thought it was just a glitch with the blu-ray disc, so I returned the entire collection for another one (which arrived quickly - kudos to Amazon!).  I was disgusted when the ""new"" blu-ray had the exact same problem.  Apparently the companies who manufacture these products don't care about the quality.  I will be contacting Disney/Pixar directly to complain about the fact that they mass-produced an inferior product.  I still gave the collection 3 stars since the DVD and the ""extras"" all play well and we truly love the movie - and Amazon's shipping was fantastic!",1357257600,,826,4.774647887323944

1145072,4,7799133104,"OK, so what is not to like?  Pixar focuses it's remarkable talents on a tale of a young princess (natch) growing up in medieval Scotland.  Since it is Disney, you know that there will be an attempt at a heart-warming message.  The plot itself is rather linear - girl is special, girl rebels, girl causes problem, girl fixes problem.  The positive message is one of taking action to control ones existence, but understanding the effect of your actions on others.  Merida is another strong willed Disney heroine.

What is great is the comic undertone of the entire movie, the supporting characters, other than the serious mother, are uniformly hilarious.  Most scenes display a humorous whimsey that wins you over, from the clan chieftans to Merida's little brothers (always after baked goods).  The animation is great, with wonderful landscapes, animals, and, of course, Merida's fire red hair.",1357257600,2,893,5.068493150684931

To keep it short, story was beautiful.  characters were adorable.  I immediately thought about renting this to my friends who have daughters. :)  I really liked it.

If this is happening with your copy, try this: After selecting 'play movie', switch your audio to 'Channel 2'. This completely resolved all issues we were having. We were so excited!! I thought we were going to have to return our copy, believing it to be defective, but that is not the case.

1145490,3,7799133104,"I'm one of those Pixar fans that is willing to put money down on any film Pixar produces -- before I even know what it is.  I have such faith in the company that I know I'll enjoy the film regardless of what it's about.

While I very much enjoyed Brave, I have to admit that it is possibly the worst Pixar film yet.  In terms of technical quality, it rocks!  Fantastic animation, color grading, effects, and sound.  Brilliant!!  The story, however, is a bit tired and predictable -- and that's where my only disappointment comes in.  There isn't much new under the sun... but Pixar has found ways, in previous films, to bring something new to the screen in every scene.  So, even if you know ""the good guy is going to win and get the girl in the end"" they still find ways to make the whole ride a 'new' experience.  But I didn't get that experience with this film.  In fact, I could almost see every scene coming before it arrived on the screen -- it was that predictable.  There were some original moments in the film, but just not enough to keep me interested.

Ultimately, I was a happy customer watching this film... but for the first time with a Pixar film I can honestly say that I don't need to watch it a second time (keep in mind that I have not seen Cars 2 yet -- which my wife says she doesn't care to watch a second time -- so maybe there will be two Pixar films that I don't find ""above average"").",1357084800,2,1410,4.200743494423792

In the forest, mystical will-o-the-wisps (who Merida has been brought up believing can lead one to his or her destiny) lead the princess to the modest home of a wacky witch, who provides Merida with a spell that will change her mother, the queen, into seeing her side.

1145780,4,7799133104,"This film was generally well-received by critics and audiences alike, so I went in expecting what most Disney films deliver: family-friendly content that normally doesn't require any serious emotional or intellectual investment.  I actually laughed out loud at a few parts, which surprised me.  When I saw the trailer, I thought the humor was going to be obnoxious crap in a desperate attempt to appeal to the younger audience, but I was pleased with the way it was done.

The storyline is a bit strange.  Because the main character, Merida, wants to be free, she has a witch perform a spell to ""change"" her mother.  This ""change"" involved her turning into a horse.  The rest of the film consists of Merida trying to break the spell and bring her mother back into human form.  Okay, I can try to accept the odd storyline.  It is a kid's movie, after all.  But here's where I have a problem: The witch tells Merida to remember a phrase.  I don't remember it because everyone in the film has Scottish accents, so it was hard enough trying to comprehend what they were saying.  This phrase is supposed to be so important that the witch repeats it.  After this, we never hear the phrase again.  What was the point of spending that much screen time on something that won't be brought up again?  More organization in the script could've made this a better film.

There was one thing I really liked about this film: the climax.  There is an awesome scene where we get to see two bears fight.  For a Disney film, it was actually really intense, which is an unusual but welcome feeling to experience in a film of this caliber.  This film was also funny, specifically when Merida is trying to sneak her bear mother past a group of townspeople.  Also, who doesn't enjoy seeing a bear dive down a big-breasted woman's blouse to get a key?  I give two thumbs up for the comedy in this film; the timing was spot-on and targeted several different age groups.

To wrap things up, Brave is a colorful and funny film that lacks a solid script.  I really want to check out more Disney films in the future so I can keep in check my thoughts about the studio.  Disney usually does a good job of making great family films, but not always.  I liked Brave and I like the direction Disney is heading in.  If they continue to make films as enjoyable as this one, you can expect more Disney reviews from me.",1356912000,,2380,4.47906976744186

1145940,4,7799133104,"Brave was an outstanding movie. The quality of the animation done by PIXAR gets better and better every year. This movie was not short on quality. The sound and pictures were simply amazing. There were times during the movie I wanted to say, ""Wow... isn't the scenery beautiful?""

The plot of the movie was good, and it was nice to have a heroine take the lead role. In addition, the movie was hilarious! There were so many funny parts. Although a Disney movie, there were quite a few scary parts that young children would find frightening.

The major downside (and the reason it's only 4 stars) to this 3-disc Blu-ray set was the special features. I was very interested in the Scottish accents and the actors that did the voices (they were all native Scotts), but the special feature on them was only a few minutes long. The rest of the special features were not much better. With a separate blu-ray disk dedicated to the features, I was expecting a lot more.

In all, I was quite pleased with it, and definitely recommend it.",1356825600,,1027,4.570652173913044

1146044,5,7799133104,"This is just a spectacular animated story.  Merida is the Princess daughter of King Fegus and the beautiful Queen Elinor.  Her mother wants her to be a perfect princess and a lady but Merida is a tom boy at heart with a passion for challenges and archery and she is really fearless.  When it comes time to match her up with a suitable suitor for a husband from the sons of the clan tribe leaders, Merida has her own ideas. She wants to be able to make her own decisions about how she will live her life....

This is a very cute story and the CGI graphics were outstanding. This is a five star movie and it is an excellent film for children and adults alike.  The graphics design and animation of the film were some of the best that I have seen and the story line for the film was dramatic but well thought through.  The accents and the voices selected for the characters was just as well selected and performed.

My wife and I thought the film had a good premise and it was great to see how the movie flowed and it never left the plot line, sticking to the final goal until the impeccable and exciting ending.  Disney and Pixar have another hit on their hands.  The film also had an excellent song track with some good music and songs and it really is a full package when it comes to an entertaining CGI adventure film.

It had lovely scenery (something I never imagined saying for an animated film), a somewhat unpredictable story, and was just plain fun to watch. It was cute, but not sickly sweet, nor was it over the top goofy pie-in-the-face to appeal to 7 year old boys stereotypical crap so many animated films have nowadays. Bravo for Brave, this film has much more of the flavor of the old Pixar films, less of the typical Disney film, which is a good thing.

Story was fun, might be a little bit scary for little tiny kids, but the message of a strong young lady is one that is important.  Highly recommend.",1356825600,2,427,4.780821917808219

The setting of the  film was wonderful, a good backdrop for the friction between selfish Merida and Her proper mother.  A simple story, beautifully told, can be very powerful.  And indeed , it is, even if we never quite see Merida's strength.  We can see her bravery, because bravery is not always about adventurousness, but sing the courage to admit you are wrong and to try and change to become a better person.  That is real courage, because it can be more difficult that courage in the face of physical danger.",1356825600,,674,4.520661157024794

1146262,4,7799133104,"I saw this film with my granddaughter, who is nine. She was entranced, I was pleased. Disney and Pixar has given us an unusual twist to the Princess, gruff King, loving queen mother story.

The Princess is Merida with the voice of the wonderful Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald. Merida is an a red haired Scottish tomboy whose life is changed by an early birthday gift of a bow, which quickly inspires her to become the best archer in the kingdom. Then we move to Merida as a young lady of marriageable age, who is angered by a request from Queen Elinor voice-over by Emma Thompson, to choose among three possible husbands chosen by her clan. Merida wants none of them and escapes to the forest after winning the archery contest. One event after another occur and the queen becomes a bear after a magic spell is cast. The search for god and evil occurs, and in the process new love and devotion come to the fore. All is right with the world after battles and barriers are broken down.

This is not one of the ground breaking Pixar films, but good enough. The Scottish countryside seems almost real, beautifully crafted characters and background.

Highly Recommended. prisrob. 12-29-12",1356739200,2,1184,4.7101449275362315

The film skipped around throughout different chapters. I asked Amazon to send me a new one soon thereafter and finally got myself a perfect copy.

1146351,2,7799133104,"The story seems to have been built around the idea that admitting ones mistakes requires bravery. I would wholeheartedly agree with this. However, the main characters actions are not what I would consider a clear example to the under 13 crowd of bravely admitting your mistakes. Instead, it seemed to me most of the movie is about the young lady trying to prevent the truth from coming to light and helping her mother cope with the results of her actions. The large reliance on magic for plot advancement doesn't win points with me either. I would have preferred a message that conveyed the importance of admitting mistakes promptly and that asking for help if it is needed in addressing the consequences. The later requires an equal amount of bravery in my mind. Probably my biggest issue with the movie-and a completely subjective one- is simply that I expected something very different. I thought it was going to be about a young lady taking charge of her destiny in a man dominated world and instead, this is where the movie ends.",1356652800,2,1034,4.75

This is how movies are now. The nudity was to be found humorous, not sexual in any way so I don't see what the big deal was. As for the violence...

I actually liked that it took a whole different story line opposed to the typical princess movies that I grew up with.  I also appreciated that the characters were more... familial?  It wasn't about running off and living in some far-off palace with the handsome prince that swept her off her feet and made all her dreams of a better life come true.

1146657,1,7799133104,"Disney has gone too far.  I purchased this movie for my daughters for Christmas.  It is a movie showcasing a strong female character, not the ordinary princess portrayal concerned with getting the prince and fashion, who has a strong relationship with her father.

We don't have a DVD player, as we watch our movies on our computers.  This would not work on any of my daughters computers, which aren't that old!  The DVD copy would only work on my brand new work laptop, which I can't leave that at home just so my kids can watch Brave!

I bought the full Blu-Ray 3D, Blu-Ray, DVD, Bonus, and Digital Copy.  The DVD wouldn't even show up as inserted.  The Digital Copy wouldn't play, and just crashed Windows Media Player every time I tried, on every machine I tried.  The Blu-Ray copies wouldn't play either.

Days later we still haven't been able to watch it.  I am sending this back.  Seems like you can't even watch a movie that you do buy these days.",1356566400,6,955,4.488372093023256

This is a great mother-daughter movie and I highly suggest it to those who know that there is bond that needs to be mended between you and your daughter or you and your mother. This is not really a manly movie, so I suggest it for those who don't want to see The Bourne Legacy or The Avengers.",1356566400,,466,4.430232558139535

1146922,1,7799133104,"Edit: Scottish, not Irish.
Expectation: Feel-good story about a courageous girl with great graphics.

Reality: Great graphics provide real life detail for content that is not for young children. I wish I had read the Amazon paid reviewer who stated that the move wasn't suitable ""for those under 10 years"" prior to purchasing the movie. Lesson learned.  The content included a lot of violence and some animated nudity (I'm unsure why animated nudity is different than actual nudity anymore because there is such a high level of detail).  Are animated sex scenes ok since they are `just' animated?  Anyway, back to the review. In terms of content the movie is a poorly written chop job. The writers worked hard to negatively stereotype the Scottish as apparently moronic idiots who can't keep their pants up while forgoing such trivialities as a plot. There were a few small laughs scattered throughout the movie.

Plot (spoilers):  The story begins with a bear named Mor'dur attacking a family randomly picnicking in the woods.  I'll leave the explanations for the bear's existence to internet research, but suffice to say it is an angry ancestor. The young girl, not wanting to be married to one of the local Irish dolts her mother wishes, has a witch cast a spell on her mother.  As a result of the spell the mother is turned into a bear. Long story short - they run through the castle, there are multiple kilt-raisings, and the mother bear ends up killing the angry ancestor Mor'dur.

Summary: I would not purchase the movie again.  I enjoy watching movies with my daughter in which she can observe strong female lead characters portray positive role models while telling an entertaining story.  With Brave, Disney obscured a good tomboy princess idea with bear chicanery and idiotic, imbecilic behavior by every male character in the movie.  The resulting product is neither entertaining nor positive.",1356480000,23,1905,4.974763406940063

The Scottish stereotypes are as demeaning as you'd expect, but like stereotypes satisfyingly familiar (I say this as a Scot).  It's sort of like you feel like you've arrived if Disney or whoever is depicting you, even if they're bludgeoning you at the same moment.  Ah well.

Best part?  The utterly feminist workings of the plot where (spoiler alert) she doesn't have to marry anyone in the end, and doesn't have to masculinize herself (okay, a tiny bit at first--but she quickly realizes her mistake there and backtracks) in order to avoid becoming a wife.

Of course it does have that weird thing happening to women these days in film where they're made sexy by being given a bow and being ultimately proficient with it, a la Diana (the Goddess, not the demised Princess).  To a certain extent, you become hotter by being a female with a bow and a male with a bristling gun of some sort.  Oye.  But her empowerment here is only accentuated by the prowess with the bow.  It was there in her refusal to be objectified first.  Who gave her that and how it go there is up for further critique.",1356480000,,1161,4.450236966824645

At least it was a decent price for the two and the film is awesome! On both BluRay and DVD. I am not too keen on 3D and am grateful they release without (though that digital copy would've been wonderful) and still release them on DVD. As for the movie, buy it, you'll want to watch it over and over.

A few points in the film seemed like other films I saw before, but where it's an animated film that gives a chance for a younger audience to see it, which is super.  Gives a bit of hope to the mother/daughter relationship because in this film the mother and daughter are at odds but become closer as the film is woven together.  The daughter needs to become the mother in a sense.  But it also seemed a bit short, buty maybe it was just how it came across to me, but I did enjoy it.

1147290,5,7799133104,"quickly become a Disney favorite- we went to Disney a week after purchasing this and there was already reference to Princess Merida in the park (especially Frontier's land)

Princess Merida is a firey red-head who does not want to be promised as a bride to another Irish clan- she fights with her mother and then runs away from the castle only to find a witch in a wooded cave. Merida makes a deal with this witch who casts a spell on Merida's mother (who wants her to marry another clan's son and unite two Irish tribes). Merida's mother becomes a bear- if they can't reverse the spell in enough time the spell will become permanent.

I am an adult Disney fan and I found parts of this movie VERY scary and inappropriate for young children. The bad character (Merdu the bear) was terrifying- very scary- and the fight scenese with said bear were equally uncomfortable.

There are a few Irish songs in this movie but nothing very catchy that left you wanting to replay them with children or do a sing-a-long.

What I did find interesting of this movie is: there is no love interest. Merida is the heroine - and there is no male lead to come in and help her save the day. There is no prince for this princess - and she is just A OK (more so) with that. I thought this was very 21st century of Disney and feel they are very Brave for putting out a movie/story such as this.

Overall, this will be another Disney classic but does not meet the ranks of some of the other Disney hits (such as Nemo or Tangled).",1356393600,,1505,4.341637010676156

The film features voice actors not as well known as other Pixar films, but the cinematography alone will blow your mind for an animated film. Yes, the characters look cartoonish, but everything else (the sets, costumes, atmosphere, even the weather) look SO real and beautiful that this film is worth owning on that point alone. This film was probably the darkest Pixar movie I've seen up until this point; I think they were going for a much more serious and mysterious plot line instead of some of their earlier, ""brighter"" films like Cars or Toy Story. The DVD has some nice extras, including two short films and DVD Commentary.

1147529,4,7799133104,"Brave is a 2012 American computer-animated adventure fantasy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.

Tale focuses upon a girl named Merida coming of age and refusing to follow Scottish traditions of marrying into another noble house to keep the lands at peace. Of course, the tale is written for a 21st century audience because back in the day marrying into families was a way of survival and if you brooked tradition it could mean the death of many including your loved ones but Brave chooses to ignore that historical piece and instead turn this into a modern telling of following your bliss. It works well enough.

Brave is very much of a tale of a daughter and mother mending ""the bond torn by pride"". In fact, that is arguably the ongoing thematic element of this film and it works on different levels that adults and children can comprehend.

1147530,5,7799133104,We loved this movie! The characters were so clever and the three princes were hilarious. We laughed and cried at this movie. Per the norm for Disney there are some scary scenes that might frighten younger viewers however nothing bad really happens. This movie was a pleasure to watch. The soundtrack is also really nice.,1356307200,,320,4.836363636363636

1147532,4,7799133104,"We really enjoyed this movie, but when it finished we felt it was lacking in something. Couldn't put our finger on what was missing, maybe some more substance to the story. The imagery was amazing though and the characters were funny and charming. I'd still recommended it even though my husband and I were a little dissappointed with the wrapping up of the story at the end. The kids loved it, although it was aimed probably above their ages - above 5 years.",1356307200,,459,4.542168674698795

1147590,5,7799133104,"Brave is one of those family movies you want to watch over and over again, good humor, excellent animation, good story. This movie makes me remember that even though one could be an adult, there is no problem in going back and feel like a kid again. Tons of fun, great entertainment for the family. Hope if they make a second part to not spoil this series",1356307200,,355,4.313432835820896
1147591,4,7799133104,This was a very fun and cute movie to watch but not the best thing Pixar has ever put out.,1356307200,2,90,3.55
1147592,2,7799133104,"Pixar has been on a slow downhill climb as of late, Brave unfortunately takes a drastic dip from previous outings.  First off , for those who don't know, in the middle of production the director was switched. This isn't that abnormal for Hollywood mind you, but considering Disney was pretty vocal about this being one of Pixar's first female directed movies with a strong female lead it does cause some issues. The switch of directors is very noticeable.

The movie doesn't seem to know what genre or mood it wants to set. One second it's dramatic, the next comedy/slapstick, then something mystic/supernatural, and then something like a poor imitation Ghibli movie. These constant switches are most likely due to the different visions both directors had. To make matters worse the story and characters suffer due to this.

First off the main lead. Merida doesn't change at all throughout the movie. She comes out at the beginning not wanting to follow family tradition, rather her own fate. Yet at the end she just caves in and gives into her fate as dictated by her parents. Yeah, she won't be forced to marry anyone right away, but in the future she will be. So her mother still controls her fate. Overall, Merida is a very passive character not the strong one the movie was advertised as having.

Next is the problem with the story. First off, the throw away characters. The main catalyst for the movie is Merida meeting the witch and getting the potion from her. Why does the witch do this? Is she evil? Good? The fact that the main catalyst is a two-dimensional throw away character shows a lot of the problems this movie went through during development. Basic screenwriting 101- cause and effect. You need a reason for things to happen. Not, I'll give you this potion so the movie can move along.

Next problem. What is this movie supposed to be about? Merida's engagement? Her mother issues? Some old prince who was cursed to become a bear? From these three points brought up in the movie, which one doesn't seem to belong? This movie has too many side stories going on. It's like they just took a bunch of ideas with some vague relation and stuck them together. A lot of the pacing issues could have been solved by removing the part about the cursed prince and filling that empty space with more plot from the other two points.

Another problem is the mother's transformation. She adapts to being a bear to easily. Within hours of being a bear she can already walk on both legs, navigate through narrow corridors, run through the woods, even use silverware with her claws. Disney's Brother Bear does this transformation much better, especially in terms of adaptability.

So, with a weak female lead, poor pacing, paper-thin plot, what does the movie get right? Well, it is beautiful. The animation is simply gorgeous with obvious care given to every detail on landscape and props.

In conclusion, as far as Pixar movies go, this is by far the weakest. Pixar has branded themselves as storytellers, being able to reach both young and old. This is what separates them from many other family movie producing companies. Unfortunately, Pixar seems to drop the ball here with their storytelling.

A visual treat yes, a good story no.",1356307200,8,3237,4.755793226381462

1147597,2,7799133104,The movie itself was not too bad if you like Disney movies.  Nothing spectacular about this one.  I streamed this from Amazon and the quality of the picture was poor.  Many scenes had poorly defined pixels.  My high speed internet connection was working fine.  So I can only conclude the problem was on the Amazon end of things.  Perhaps their streaming services were too busy at the time or maybe there is a problem with their stored video content for this particular movie.  I watched Ice Age 2 (a better movie by the way) the next day during the same time frame and the quality of the picture was perfect.,1356307200,,608,4.472727272727273

1147684,5,7799133104,"Imagine Disney/Pixar doing a movie where grown (animated) men are running around butt-naked (no frontal nudity, however), and where there is the scariest bear ever seen in an animated motion picture. Imagine a Disney move (animated or not) where there is no beautiful and vulnerable princess, no prince charming to save her, and no villain to be killed off or banished in the end.

Imagine a movie of any sort where the two strongest characters, whose conflict anchors the plot, are both strong and good women (well, one of them is a teen-ager). And imagine that in this unimaginable movie there are no male villains, just well-intentioned guys who can't see past the status quo when it comes to recognizing that women have brains as well as bodies.

Well, at least there is magic and will-o-the-wisps and a witch (but not a wicked one), and a valuable moral at the core.

My pre-adolescent granddaughters, if you combined them into one, would be the heroine of ""Brave"" - red hair and all. It was so gratifying to take them to this movie (the 3D adds a lot) not knowing just how fabulous the role modelling would be.

Caution, however! The bear is very scary.",1356220800,,1159,4.694581280788177

Our grandson enjoyed the movie and understood the message; he was able to tell us what he had learned from it. (Personal comment:  It's tough to balance these kinds of messages with how life actually unfolds... but, maybe reality should be deferred as long as possible.)",1356220800,,521,5.129411764705883
1147759,5,7799133104,"It's mind blowing what the artists behind Pixar animation can accomplish with digital tools.  A few minutes into the film and you forget it's animated.  The color and detail are stunning and more importantly the story is good for both genders and all ages unless you're a particularly cold-hearted grumpy sort.  What I particularly liked is that this film is 100% female-positive and empowering without being preachy/feminist to the point of irritation.  It just flatly states that boys/girls should have equal opportunities in life to choose their dreams and their paths.  The story avoids the cliche father/son or boy/girl and instead focuses on mother/daughter in ways not usually seen in films.  Moving beyond the ""marry who you have to and love will follow down the road"" to an exploration of children needing to rethink their blind rebellion at all costs and parents move beyond blind adherence to legacy traditions that may be antediluvian.  And beyond all that, it's a reference quality HD movie to show off your HDTV/Blu-ray to those who still question the value of HD anything.",1356220800,,1087,5.073033707865169

You know, Pixar isn't trying to go for a super serious story; they were going for a fun Scottish-themed adventure about a strong princess, her relationship with her mother, the shift in her worldview from her parents, and the dangers of bringing a witch into the fray.

It had a very fun story, an interesting back story, fun characters, and beautiful effects.

It isn't my favorite Pixar film but it's a wonder to look at, a fun story for a pre-teen to teenager, and a warm film with very light scary scenes.",1356220800,,681,4.520325203252033

1148138,5,7799133104,"Disney is becoming a master of 3-D animation. The effects are very convincing, but not so overdone as to become gimmicky. The story is well-written and the main character is a princess, but not your typical ""Disney princess."" She rides horses, is a terrific archer and fights (literally) for her life and the life of her Mother.

I won't give you anymore because that would spoil it. Buy this one...it's well worth it. (Don't have a 3-D setup yet? Buy this version anyway. It's got every option covered, 3-D BluRay, regular BluRay, DVD and digital.)",1355961600,,549,4.778947368421052

1148216,4,7799133104,"I enjoyed this movie.  However, can we leave out the voodoo?  I don't think it is appropriate for little children.  It just creates a home schooling lesson during or after the movie.  I had to tell my son many things to keep him on track with good versus evil and how the choice for evil always brings disaster and ruin or suffering.

1148222,4,7799133104,"This movie is good.  I was pretty riveted by it.  It is a little scary for the smaller set but my kids seemed to not notice and they are 4 and 2.  I did find it perhaps predictable for Pixar.,.maybe could of been more inventive, but the theme of a strong princess who doesn't want the prince, and the focus of the mother daughter relationship was great!  I don't think Merida was portrayed as too bratty really..I mean, kids can be bratty and they do things without realizing the real consequences.  They can be short sited and only think of their wants and needs..I don't think that is bad to show as long as the resolution shows the growth of the character, and their realization to see beyond themselves and have compassion etc etc.  Merida does grow and so does her Mother for that matter.  They clearly love each other but their own preconceived notions and desires get in the way.  I have a very strong willed and feisty daughter and this movie touched me for sure.  It just reminds us that no matter what is going on in our relationship with our children, how furious we get, how furious they get, how many things that are done with haste..we still love each other fiercely and that is always there..sometimes things just get in the way and we must rise above and settle differences.  I think this is an important message to address, and maybe it's an ordinary topic but I'm glad Disney and Pixar addressed it.  It's not a perfect movie but the characters are loveable, esp. the Dad, Merida, the brothers, and the Mom; and the animation is top rate.  Merida's hair animation is reason enough on it's own to watch this movie!",1355961600,,1631,4.491525423728813

So this is about a girl who is struggling to be herself and find out who she is and who makes some mistakes and hurts those she loves.

I love Merida's spirit and long flowing locks of red hair. The triplets are absolutely adorable and their personality and mischievousness comes out even when they are bears. As a daughter, it was great to watch with my mom. We went to see it together while on vacation in FL (awww) and it was a perfect choice. Also, this came with the Pixar short: La Luna, which is now one of my favorites! It is so good! I love that it came with the Blu-ray and DVD. I kept the Blu-Ray and gave the DVD to my mom.

1149326,3,7799133104,"After two sequels, I was very excited to hear that Pixar was producing a new original movie.  It had everything: and exotic culture, action, humor, and brilliant animation.  Sadly, it didn't pan out like I had hoped it would.  Maybe I've grown up too much, but I had always thought Pixar was brilliant at making movies that people of all ages could appreciate.  This movie felt like a waltz through a kindergartner's make-believe afternoon.  I never felt a real sense of urgency in the plot; it all seemed like the playful antics of a rebellious teen, and nobody was ever in any real danger.  By the time it ended, I was left thinking ""That's all?""
Don't get me wrong, there are trademark Pixar aspects still in there.  The animation, the scenery, and the cinematography are beautiful throughout.  There are many characters to grow attached to, and the humor is tastefully written for everybody to enjoy.  But I expected this kind of story from Dreamworks; Pixar has a higher standard to live up to, and it fell short this time.",1355443200,,1028,4.698324022346369

It also shows how you can rebel and still meet everyone's expectations, even your own by being true to yourself.  There is family conflict, teen-age angst, personal growth, loss, love and reunion.

1149584,5,7799133104,"Disney appears to be doing everything right when it comes to civil rights. It has certainly been a long way. Their animated films reflect racial diversity without being patronizing or offensive, with good values. ""Brave"" is an exciting and delightful film that follows this pattern, addressing the at-times-neglected role of women in society, showing an empowered and determined young lady that defies good ol' boy traditions. And it does it in an intelligent and colorful way.

The story takes place in Scotland, where King Fergus rules the Clan DunBroch. The king gives Merida, his young daughter, a bow for her birthday. With time, Merida becomes an expert archer, a beautiful teenager, and lives a happy life with her three identical triplets. It is at this time that her mother, Queen Elinor, tells her that she is to be engaged for marriage to one of the sons of the leaders of his father's allied Clan kings. Merida, who has a strong and determined character - independent and opinionated -, hates the idea and does everything that she can to avoid this task, which means breaking a holy tradition. In doing so, she hurts her mother, by asking a witch to transform her into a bear. Merida, of course, feels sorry that she made that choice, and, against time, tries to reverse the spell. Add to this the curse of the legendary Mor'du, a huge, mean black bear, who is feared by all, and who was once a handsome prince. All these problems will make Merida reexamine her actions and behavior, and her future in the kingdom.

""Brave"" has all the technical goodies of any Pixar films, and it is just great to watch. It is also funny, wicked and charming. And, as I said, it is about women's empowerment and bravery.

The animation was well done but the story just was not that engaging.",1355270400,2,281,4.62
1149678,5,7799133104,"Ever since the first ""Toy Story"" film rolled into theaters, I have greatly enjoyed Pixar's contributions to Disney's animated films.  It seems that no matter what genre they decide to tackle, be it superhero movies (The Incredibles), dystopian science fiction (WALL-E), tearjerking Oscar contenders (Up), and even culinary movies (Ratatoullie), they come up with winners.  Even their critically panned ""Cars"" movies have been a step above a lot of modern animated movies, and I can't think of with a single Pixar film that I didn't just enjoy, but love.

""Brave"" is no exception.  And after so many years of suffering through the pastel-colored, girly-girl world of the Disney Princesses, it's refreshing and wonderful to see a princess who can hold her own.  And the film looks gorgeous to boot.

""Brave"" chronicles the story of Merida, princess of a Scottish kingdom who prefers horseback-riding and archery to etiquette and embroidery, much to the consternation of her proper and dignified mother.  When her mother announces that Merida must soon marry in order to prevent a clan feud from overtaking the kingdom, she runs away and decides to change her fate by consulting an eccentric witch in the forest.  The witch grants her wish... but it comes at an unexpected cost, and Merida must take responsibility and act quickly to save both her mother and the kingdom from the consequences of the spell.

This film looks absolutely stunning -- Pixar apparently had to rewrite its graphics software for this movie, and it shows in graphics that are top notch.  The Scottish highlands serve as a magnificent backdrop for this story, creating a world that looks almost real.  Hair and fur are well-rendered as well -- Merida's hair in particular is a wild tangle that must have been a nightmare to render but looks real enough to touch.

The story has come under criticism by some for being ""average"" and not showcasing Merida's talents enough.  I feel it's a wonderful fairy tale, however, and is a great coming-of-age story.  And the moral of the story is a timely one that I think all children and parents should learn -- that our choices have consequences, and we must take responsibility for our actions, for better or for worse.

I must also give special mention to the sounds of this movie -- the music and the voice cast.  The music, a combination of traditional orchestral score and bagpipe music, fits the story like a glove, with additional vocal songs woven in seamlessly.  And after seeing so many films that are supposed to take place in foreign countries but have a jarrinly American-sounding voice cast, it's refreshing to hear authentic British and Scottish voices in this film.  The voice cast does a wonderful job bringing the characters to life.

I personally consider this one of Pixar's best films yet, and one of the best Disney fairy tales and princess stories in a long time.  Merida is a worthy addition to the Disney Princess roster, and could probably run circles around Snow White and Cinderella (though I think she'd get along well with Mulan...).  Best suited for children 8 and up due to some scary moments.",1355270400,,3136,4.901515151515151

1149746,2,7799133104,"What a missed opportunity - Pixar could have done so much better.  It's like they went for the lowest common denominator.  Think of great movies like ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and ""The Incredibles"" --- innovative films that don't rely on rehashed ideas from other cliche-ridden movies.  Anything old, these movies reinvent and make new again.  That is what Brave should have been.  Instead we have a movie that should have been called ""Brother Bear 3.""

Yes, my kid enjoyed the movie and that is what counts.  But the truly great Pixar films have not been directed simply at kids; they are family films that can be enjoyable for anyone at any age.  I can watch ""Finding Nemo"" annually and enjoy it each time.  On the other hand, ""Brave"" is a movie I could have done without and will certainly never watch again.  This one just didn't have the Pixar magic we have all come to expect.",1355270400,2,883,4.56687898089172
1149747,2,7799133104,"Warning this review may contain spoilers not intended to spoil the film but only to point out issues.
I really wanted to like this movie.  My girlfriend and I had a movie night and we wanted to watch this but the redbox nearby did not have it.  After renting two other movies I went back and found Brave at the 9pm return deadline :).  We came back and started watching it.  The Pixar film was made with amazing quality as usual.  The hair of the main character Merida was pretty neat to watch when she was a child it was stunning how the Pixar technology works.  The foundation and introduction of the characters was done in an adequate fashion.  Merida was portrayed as rebellious, smart, cunning, athletic, great riding abilities and a marksman with the bow.  It had one big Disney style production of riding through the forest shooting then climbing a mountain and singing in front of a waterfall (Cinematic Fluff).  After a finding out her parents were going to marry her off based on a competition with 3 other tribes.  She fights for herself to stay single.  That was it, that was the last point in the movie where I enjoyed it.  That was the only time the first introduction of the character actually came to fruition.  She stood up for herself and beat the oafs that were presented to her in an archery competition.  From this point forward it was like a new writer took over the films script.
Plot twist... Brave become Naive.  This was the last point in the film where Brave becomes an issue, factor, or relevance to the story.  Now she turns into this Naive little stupid girl who gets lost in the forest in a fit of self pity and rage.  A witch that tries to kill her she gives full trust into without considering any consequences gives her a spell.  This spell thus infecting her mother and brothers in such a way that the whole story dies.  It was pathetic.  It was so fantastic in premise that I could barely watch it anymore.  My girlfriend fell asleep during a Disney/Pixar film... really...
It wasn't her fault it just went from being a human movie to an animal film and not a very good one.  Long story short... The bears, the witch, the chasing and the bear hatred were all extremes that appears were the only way they could make this a movie.  All suffered from unoriginal thought, predictability, and the fact they made the Heroine so dumb showed the true colors of Disney.  The fact that the ""Heroine"" was strong and became such a pathetic child that showed no remorse for her actions, acted out of her own wishes and not considering the feelings of others even after destroying her families lives.  It was just disgusting.
I have no idea what the moral of the story was.  Was it the same as it has been with all Disney films of the past?.. Don't trust the witch or was it that you should try to get your way no matter who you hurt in your path and eventually everything will work out when you cause so much destruction in your path.  I don't expect everyone to agree with me on this and I don't really care I just wanted to voice my opinion on one movie what had great visual potential but lacked the moral integrity to even be considered as a Disney classic.  This should have been a straight to DVD film.  In so many ways this actually makes the woman Heroine look absolutely stupid and I think young girls should have a better example to learn by.",1355270400,7,3375,4.424635332252836

I just don't see what audience they are targeting with this movie. I don't see little kids liking this movie and people who like fantasy, gothic style of art and movies, this is nothing like it looks in the poster.

It is one of those movies that, though it is intended for children, I can watch over and over again and still find hilarious and and heart wrenching every time.

I did have an issue with the shipping because it was lost in transit somewhere and never came in but one call to Amazon and they got it all fixed up quickly and painlessly and sent me another copy free of charge that came in the very next day.

With that out of the way, let me say that I did enjoy Brave, but it didn't capture my imagination like Pixar movies so often do. Where Pixar typically excels is in developing the characters so that despite the style of animation lacking realism, you connect and empathize with the characters. While Brave moves quickly, has a likable-enough protagonist, and ultimately does fine in terms of providing an hour and half of entertainment, it lacks the depth of character development that the more successful Pixar films had. In a similar fashion, I found the plot and message to be a bit flat and obvious as well.

Pixar usually makes movies that are ostensibly for kids, but that even adults can enjoy because of the many layers contained within. I'd happily plop a niece or nephew down in front of Brave, but I might not be fighting them for the popcorn like I normally would.",1355184000,,932,4.676829268292683

Her passion is riding her enormous clydesdale horse (Angus) and shooting arrows at stuff... similar to hunger games in that regard, also found it similar to disney's tangled. Worth a rental I guess, I wouldnt buy it... especially at disney's inflated prices. The animation is beautifully done though and it looks really good on BD",1355184000,,664,4.782608695652174

I especially like the way it depicts Celtic culture; clearly Disney has finally learned something from its Pocahontas and Mulan cultural debacles!  Merida is the perfect heroine.  But more importantly, this film touches upon the most difficult relationship of all:  mothers and daughters!  It's a film so universal to our experiences as girls and women that it is an absolute must-see for mothers and daughters alike!

The soundtrack here is fabulous!  Please download the album.  it's absolutely beautiful music, especially ""Noble Maiden Fair"" which is sung by Emma Thompson in Gaelic and features haunting Irish harps!",1355184000,,671,5.264150943396227

1150058,5,7799133104,"I must say I am shocked at the negative reviews, but to each his own.  I loved this change of pace for Disney and Pixar.  The entire princess thing to me is played out.  Beautiful (perfect looking) girl seeks handsome husband and somehow they meet, fall in love instantly and live in a huge castle with everything they could imagine, etc (oh and they can all sing.)  While nice in a fantasy type world, it is not reality.  How many of our daughters still think this is reality.  They want that fantasy, and as they grow they realize that it is not how the real world is, and truth be told is not reality for many of us.  I loved how this played on the tough relationship between a daughter and her mother (this is real life).  The fact that as the daughter got older she came to understand she did not want the same thing her parents wanted is reality, many of us lived this.  The daughter tried to change this on her owm, makes a bad decision, but in the end they work things out as a family.  It is called growing up, coming to terms with your parents dreams to make you happy and your own.  The witch and magic aspect - if you don't approve of this in a movie for your kid, I can respect that.  It is just par for the course since Harry Potter, the Twilight movies, the list goes on and on.  If you feel that strongly - don't go to Disney World, it is filled with Magic inspire rides and shows.  My daughter loved it, she was Merida for Halloween - she loved the strong ""Brave"" aspect.

WE CAN DO IT ALL ON OUR OWN. This movie is a defenite must see. Its empowering to women and little girls.

It pains me to say that this is the second movie they have put out in a row that left me feeling underwhelmed (Cars 2 was the first). It's not a bad movie by any means, let me get that out of the way. It's a mildly entertaining flick for kids, and it's almost a coming-of-age tale, mostly geared towards girls, which is fine, but it was not what I expected. I feel like I was watching a movie I've seen a hundred times, even though it was my first time watching it. The animation is spectacular, I'll give it that. The characters and story are largely forgettable. I can't even recall the main character's name. Or any of their names to be honest. Pixar can do better than this. I have my fingers crossed that Monsters Inc 2 will live up to the original. And to be fair, Cars 2 and Brave are the only 2 Pixar movies I found disappointing. The trouble is, I didn't expect big things from Cars 2. I expected big from Brave, and it did not deliver. Is it my fault for expecting too much then? Perhaps.

Its funny and dramatic, well paced leading to an emotional climax and contains messages that should resonate with anyone of any age.

1150579,2,7799133104,"Hopefully unbiased (or at least low-biased) part of review:

Important Point: Know the content of this movie. The animation is spectacular...but some of that techno-pizzazz is used to show, to a high degree of realism, men's naked butts and women's cleavage. Granted, the scenes are short...but they are in there.

That being said, I enjoyed the movie...and the animation was incredible. I'm a computer scientist with many years of experience and advanced degrees and I was blown away by the technical prowess in animation that was demonstrated.

The story was, at least to me, entertaining. Did I love the story as much as I did for The Incredibles? No, but The Incredibles truly WAS incredible (to me). I found Brave to be an enjoyable movie so long as you understood and was comfortable with the content.

Now comes the biased part of the review and a rant...so feel free to skip this part...

I gave the movie only 2 stars for the following reasons:

1) Subtracted two stars for squeezing in ""brief"" nudity (men's butts and a too-often fixation with animating women's cleavage) in a movie clearly aimed at a demographic that includes young children.

2) Subtracted one star because Disney/Pixar officials knew EXACTLY what they were doing. Shame on you!

Yep, I'm an old fogie and a prude...but given that I still won't excuse Disney/Pixar for putting this content (""sneaking"" it in sounds like a better characterization to me) into a movie clearly aimed at kids. Never again will I be able to buy a Disney/Pixar movie clearly aimed at kids and know that there is no question about whether or not the content is age appropriate. If it isn't rated-G, it is not automatically okay for kids. I cannot believe that Walt would be pleased with what they've done with his name.

Disney/Pixar will argue that I should have known this from the PG rating...but they know full well that most people don't know that PG allows for brief nudity. I suspect most adults, like myself, figured that an animated movie could get a PG rating from intense scenes ...but that the movie makers would NEVER be so foolish as to animate nudity into a kids movie (the Incredibles is an example of what is expected. It was rated PG due to some intense scenes...not because of nudity or anything like unto it).

Guess what? I was wrong. Whomever is in control at Disney/Pixar clearly believes that pushing to the very limit is the way to go. I wonder if they calculated into their projections the number of people they would lose as loyal customers due to feeling betrayed?

I was doubly ticked off because content aside, I *liked* the movie. I would have liked to have sat down with the nieces and nephews to watch this. Nope...not the younger ones to be sure. To borrow from one of Pixar's non-Brave characters, the movie was visually captivating and very entertaining...and then you had to just go and ruin the ride...

My rating is just that...*my* rating. However, if you feel such content is perfectly fine for your young children...then I think you'll enjoy the movie.",1354924800,,3049,4.764705882352941

Well, Pixar has released it's first fantasy film, and despite some bumps along the way, it's a pretty good film. It also gives us Pixar's first princess to join the Disney line-up; Merida. But, let's break it down a little.

First, the most important thing, the story. The film is about a rebellious princess (cliche as that may sound) wanting to change her unwanted fate of getting married to someone she's never met. The lengths at which she goes to achieve this however, lead both her and her family down a dangerous path. Sounds simple enough on paper, but there was a lot of twists and turns in the film, that it was almost a little hard to follow at times. Still, the focus of the movie is set on Merida and her relationship with her mother, Queen Elinor, which is a nice touch for Pixar/Disney to finally focus on a mother/daughter relationship this heavily. I'll admit though, when Elinor is transformed into a bear, that just felt a little, random to me. I found myself echoing Merida's ""Why a bear?"" line when I saw it happen. This plot point does provide a nice climax at the end though, showing that the curse on Elinor is more dire than they thought at first, and what could happen if they don't find a cure.

Next, the characters. A little superficial nitpick, when I saw Merida's hair, I might have been a little happy that finally there was a princess with hair as crazy as mine. But, besides that, she's, well, a little annoying at times (at least to me). I mean, she doesn't want to get married, and acts selfish (which she even admits later on) about the whole situation, and doesn't handle it very well. But, she learns, and grows as a character. The same can be said for Elinor, who scarily reminds me of my mother. The two's relationship is very relateable. Plus, she's the around one of the only queens in Disney who is not evil. Fergus, Merida's father is probably one of my favorite characters, just because he's so crazy and fun. Plus, they got the casting just right for him. Next, is Merida's brothers, who are basically the comic relief, but do a pretty good job at it, having a sort of Tom and Jerry relationship with one of the maids. The lords from the different kingdoms, and their sons, I'd also put on my favorite character list, even though their roles are minor. Just the way their differing personalities cross is enjoyable to watch. The witch (does she have a name?) is OK I guess, but this films got enough quirky characters in it. But, she's only in it for about 10 minutes so, no real harm. And finally, the villain of the film; the demon bear Mor'du. This is the first Pixar or Disney villain for a while, with no real motivations (at least at first). He's akin to the bear in Fox and The Hound, except a tad more vicious. I wasn't really expecting him to be that Prince that was cursed, but I suppose they had to explain his savage nature somehow, and it was a really good payoff. In the end, he's not so much as a villain, just a victim of ""Ambition is Evil"". Plus, his design, both bear and Prince, is interesting.

Wow, now that the character section's done, let's move on to the design and music, because it's worth talking about. It's one of Pixar's finest special effects work, especially with portraying the landscape. The little details they add, while still pulling away and appreciating the larger scale, is awesome, and it was amazing to see it in 3-D at the cinemas. The music is also creative too, with a few songs by the cast that are both humorous and heartbreaking. There are a few songs by an artist, but, in my opinion, they fit in to the film okay.

Lastly, the special features. We watched the behind the scenes stuff, and it was worth checking out. I always love when they add stuff like explanations on how things in the film work. Also, there are a lot of deleted scenes, though their more prominent on the second disc. I have yet to watch the commentary, but I'm thankful it's there so we can get the director's input. Plus, there is the standard Pixar short, ""La Luna"" which is amazing, and, like the landscape in the movie was cool to watch in the cinemas, but can still be appreciated on the small screen.

So, I think I've ranted enough (actually I think this is my longest review). Overall, this is a decent add to the Pixar lineup, and Merida is a good addition to the Princess line-up. The story can get a little clunky at times, but everything else I think, is worth the price to add to your Disney/Pixar movie collection.",1354838400,,4516,4.461259079903147

1150781,5,7799133104,"When I saw this movie in the theater, I left with mixed feelings.  It is NOT your typical Disney princess tale.  There is no falling in love and living happily ever after with the man of her dreams.  But I should not have expected typical with a Pixar production.  If you can leave your expectations at the door, you'll appreciate what this story has to offer: a tale of family love; a girl coming of age and her mother who make choices they both regret; and second chances to make things right.  My daughter loved this tale from the first, and I like Merida as a role model much better that the standard princess role models that are available.  I've seen Brave three times now, and I have to say I have moved from ambivalence to admiration in short order.  And no one can argue that the visual art is stunning.",1354838400,,812,4.337748344370861

Because it already has so many reviews, this is not a review of the movie itself, but specifically of the 3-D portion. Some 3-D movies are really incredible, with objects ""flying"" out at you and things ""floating"" in your living room. These 3-D movies, in my opinion, are absolutely worth the extra money. Others, however, simply give the movie another layer of depth, but are not really that different from the blu-ray version. This is the case for Brave. Great movie, but I was very disappointed with the 3-D effects. Save yourself the extra money and buy the blu-ray version instead. If you want a great Disney movie with fantastic 3-D effects, buy Tangled instead. The 3-D effects are unbelievable!

The story has several threads which initially seem disconnected, however they all come together as the story progresses. The result is a satisfying experience for adults and a heroine that kids can relate to.

1151278,3,7799133104,"When a story is weak, it drags everything down with it. This is a story that goes round and round in circles overburdened with boring chase sequences that go on much too long. What a shame, considering the talent involved in creating it.  The humorous voices, the spectacular landscapes and gifted animation were, in the end, not enough to buoy up a plot line so leaden, it put a drag on everything. Even the heroine seemed a little selfish for not taking responsibility for her wish-gone-horribly wrong, until close to the end. What makes a story not gel? Lack of nuance maybe? A need for plenty of chases as filler for a thin narrative?  I wanted to like this movie about a spirited, pretty girl with flaming red hair, but bears took over and brought it to the dark side for most of the picture.  I'm fine with a more politically correct, less pink or frilly or classic princess meets prince plot, but exactly what was this?  Ok, this is also about a product. Would I buy this dvd?  Sure!

The visuals in this movie are nothing at all special.  We've seen it all many times.  The story is so weak, it almost doesn't exist.  The heroine's archery skill serves nothing, in fact I wondered why they included it in the movie. Surely she could have gotten in trouble a myriad of other ways?  The bear was too cartoon-ish. It felt like the makers couldn't quite figure out if this was sad or funny.  The horse, a buddy in the beginning, disappears when the going gets tough. I also found the dialog hard to follow at times because of the accent.  The best and most significant character in the whole movie is the red hair, and in fact it dominates the screen.  So why not have the hair be a significant part of the story?  (yes, Tangled has been done, and very well, but there must be other ways to use such a head of hair.)  I'm not sure how something this half-baked gets made.  Next time send the script out to someone who knows how to create a good story.",1354579200,5,1107,4.3463414634146345

""Brave"" come out and I thought it looked cute. I bought it sight-unseen for my daughter. The movie arrived the night my daughter had planned a sleepover with a couple of friends. I popped the movie in and soon all three girls, myself, and my wife were enthralled.
The movie is clever with a message to be yourself but also be responsible. There are some really fun situations. Billy Connelly is, of course, great.

I like the fact that it wasn't about a girl and a boy, but about a girl and her family, which made me happy.

There where somethings that were like all other films but it didn't hurt my vision towards the film.  The only thing I didn't like was parts of the story seemed rushed and didn't stick, and some things could have been flushed out a little bit better.

Perhaps it was that none of the men in the movie had good character? I understand that she is the first princess to not fall in love but did it have to be because no good men exsist?

There was clearly a lot of investment in getting the physics of curly hair believable, so kudos to the technical wizardry, but the story was a total disappointment. Everything happens more or less between two principle locations (castle and the ""stonehenge""), visited repeatedly by the main characters, although the canvas for this story could have been much bigger. Humor appears in the wrong places and several scenes are stretched too long (e.g., the bear chase in the castle).  The actions of the princess, such as giving her mother an unknown spell from a demented witch, are simply too ridiculous to believe (unless her bravery is compensated by a low intelligence).",1354492800,,751,5.105691056910569

That said, this is one of their worst films to date. The story is incredibly familiar, like five old Disney movies mashed into one; except, there's no climax to the story, it's just a goofy Saturday morning cartoon script stretched over an hour and given amazing production values. It even bores my 3-year-old niece.

Also, the 3D is really boring. There's really not much depth here, and the 3D is almost completely and totally unnecessary. Halfway through the film I had forgotten it was even in 3D.

This one is a pass... but thankfully Finding Nemo 3D will be here soon.",1354406400,,688,4.764705882352941

That scenario, is really what makes a great film. What they did in Brave, is attack and undermine little boys. If you are an adult and can see through the political correctness amuck then watch it. Please do not let impressionable children see it. It will give the message that boys are inferior goofs.

There is nothing wrong with a young girl dreaming of finding her perfect soul mate (prince) in life.
Unfortunately, a few bitter and angry woman want to take this away.

I saw the film at a friens home. I would personally not contribute finacially to this cause. Send a message by not buying films like this",1354406400,2,742,4.656488549618321

At no point in the commercial, the title, the cover, or anywhere else, did I realize that the main theme of this movie was BEARS. The beginning of the movie, where they were telling the story about the father fighting the bear, was okay... and I figured that later on the princess would fight the bear herself. But I wasn't expecting the mother to turn into a bear... or several other things that happened.

I don't see this as a ""Disney Princess"" movie, if that's what it was supposed to be. Too many characters, too much going on, very little focus on the princess.

And my main purpose for watching this was to preview for my children, and I feel that the scenes with the crazed bear and the bears fighting was too intense for young children. I also do not see why they needed to include several adult men's naked rears being shown as a cheap joke after they used their pants to climb down from a tower.

I'm glad I watched it before I showed it to them - they will NOT be watching it. I would not recommend this to anyone... I love Pixar films but the themes are getting more ""intense"" and dramatic to me. Very disappointed.",1354406400,5,1383,4.390625

1151844,4,7799133104,"So many people have complained about this film working on a tired formula. To an extent, that's true. However, it does something very different - and important - with its characters. In addition to the usual rebellious princess (Merida) who enjoys activities such as horseback riding and archery, another central character in the film is her mother, Queen Elinor. Elinor is trying to train her daughter to be a princess, and later, queen herself. However, Merida resists this education, viewing it as too restrictive.

The exploration of the mother/daughter relationship is the most interesting part of the movie, as it does not paint either of them as completely wrong: far too often movies like this have the strict authority figure featured as nothing more than a challenge for the character. Brave, however, makes it clear that Elinor has valid reasons for her actions. Also, it shows that Elinor herself is every bit as strong as Merida, even if she is a much more reserved, elegant figure. She shows and uses her strength in different ways.

Merida is able to learn something from her mother, and we see a wonderful case of conflict resolution (there's some fighting later, for those who want it, but I thought that wasn't as interesting), in which Merida has to think and speak, bringing what she learned from her mother to use while applying her own views. She didn't have to give up any agency, she just gained a new way to use it.

I guess the short version: I'm so glad to see a movie that doesn't treat feminine things as weaker than masculine ones. This movie shows the strength in both traditionally feminine and traditionally masculine activities.

Most of the humor is rather ""meh"" in the second half, and one major plot twist isn't adequately explained.

I am very interested in Scotland and it's culture so it was a treat for me just to see illustrations of Scotland and hear the characters talk. The other main things I love about this movie are the strong female main character (no princesses in need of saving by Prince Charming here!), and a positive mother-daughter relationship. Every other Disney princess I can think of either has no mom or a villain for a mom/step-mom. Loved this movie.

1151934,5,7799133104,"In the summer of 2012, Pixar Animation Studios released their latest computer-animated film titled ""Brave"".

The summer blockbuster was written by award-winning writer Brenda Chapman (""Chicken Run"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""The Real Ghostbusters""), Mark Andrews (""John Carter"", ""Spider-Man""), Steve Purcell (creator of the adventure game series ""Sam & Max"") and Irene Mecchi (""The Lion King"", ""Hercules"", ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"") and co-directed by Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman and Steve Purcell.

The film would become Pixar's first fairy tale film and also feature a darker tone compared to previous Pixar animated films.  And as one would expected from a Pixar film, ""Brave"" which was budgeted around $185 million, went on to earn over $532 million in the box office.

VIDEO:

""Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is probably one of the most significant Disney/Pixar animated releases I have seen in terms of overall presentation and gorgeous picture quality.  The film is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:39:1) aspect ratio and as far as picture quality is concerned, everything about this film looks incredibly well-detailed.

First, let's take a look at the Blu-ray 3D version.  For those who have the hardware to display 3D, this is one film that was created with 3D in mind.  From the way the animation utilizes depth for 3D is wonderful to see.  You actually can see the scale of the castle through 3D as it gives an impression the location is quite vast.  While there are scenes with the Elinor as the bear or Mor'du the demon bear cowering over a character with great monstrosity, you can see the scale of the bears.

But for the most part, the 3D for this film is improved compared to past Disney 3D films.  Overall, depth gives us a sense of scale much more effective for the film on Blu-ray 3D.

As for the Blu-ray release, the Blu-ray of ""Brave"" is fantastic.

From the food that King Fergus is eating to the emphasis on hair, from the strands of hair, unkept hair, beard hair, ear hair, you name it, there is a lot of detail when it comes to hair and hair physics in this film.  Also, the clothing are well=-detailed, the background scenery looks magnificent outdoors especially indoors.  The overall color is sharp, vibrant and black levels are nice and deep.

There are so many things about this film that looks realistic and detailed, I was really impressed.  The overall picture quality is one of the best I have seen on Blu-ray and the film on Blu-ray looks amazing!

As for the DVD, the DVD version is presented in 2:39:1, enhanced for 169 televisions.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

If you thought that ""Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" was great for videophiles, audiophiles will also find a lot of satisfaction with the Blu-ray release.  Presented in Dolby TrueHD 7.1, this is one of the most immersive Disney Blu-ray releases I have heard for an animated film.  From the environmental ambiance of hearing the forest, the wind, the trees, the grass being fully integrated to the film and giving you the sense that Merida and family are out in the country, there is also great utilization of sound when Mor'Du approaches or when Ilinor growls in bear form.  There is also great utilization of sound when Merida is shooting her bow and arrow or when the men are fighting against the demon bear.

The immersive soundtrack utilizes the surround channels may it be with sound effects or its beautiful musical soundtrack but also a good amount of LFE to make you feel those action scenes.  But the positive factor of this film is its immersiveness and making you feel that sound outdoors are coming from all over your soundscape.  ""Brave"" sounds absolutely fantastic in Blu-ray!

As for subtitles, subtitles are presented in English SDH, English Commentary 2.0 Dolby Digital, Spanish

EXTRAS:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Brave"" was a pleasant surprise to come from Pixar.

Not only was the storyline a bit dark, but rarely do you find a story that is concentrated on a mother and daughter relationship.  But obviously it was a film that was used to test waters of what Pixar can accomplish outside of animated films that featured non-human characters, especially characters who were not young children and it was also a film that featured Pixar Animation Studios first female director.

While a film like ""Up"" was a film about an elderly man's life who is changed thanks to a child, ""Brave"" is a film that was driven by co-director and co-writer Brenda Chapman and capturing the relationship between mother and daughter.  From Chapman's experience of traveling to Scotland and wanting to create a fairy tale in the tradition of Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm.

I'm always open for something unique and different and what I enjoyed about this film is it's overall feel and how the film incorporated Scottish dialects and utilizing the right talent that fit the film.  Originally, Reese Witherspoon was to voice the character of Merida, but it worked to Pixar's benefit to have actress Kelly Macdonald play the lead character.  From the spoken dialogue to seeing a female character that is athletic, dominant but also free-spirited, you just don't see this kind of character in a Disney animated film.

And speaking of acting, along with actress Kelly Macdonald, ""Brave"" also features wonderful voice acting from Bill Connolly, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters, Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd and Craig Ferguson.  The voice acting really made a big difference in the believability of this film.

And it's important to mention that ""Brave"" is not a film that loses its cuteness in sake of creating something realistic.  While the film does focus on mother and daughter relationships, children will no doubt love the adorable and mischievous nature of Merida's triplet young brothers.  And also, for action purposes, you have Merida's father ready to jump into any fray to defend his family and people.

The characters are fun, the scenery looks absolutely beautiful and overall animation is fantastic.  But will it work for children?  I think children will love it for its action.  I also feel that families will enjoy it for that family bonding storyline but also the nature of the story and the aspect of family.

And for those who have wanted an animated film with a brave heroine, ""Brave"" is that kind of movie.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is wonderful!  Not only is this the best 3D animated film to come from Disney thus far, it's also a film that looks and sounds incredible on Blu-ray.  There is so much detail in the characters (especially the hair!) , clothing, backgrounds and scenery, I was impressed by seeing how fantastic ""Brave"" looks on Blu-ray.  It really was breathtaking just to watch this film and see how Pixar continues to improve after one hit film after the other.  As for special features, you get a lot of them included with this release that shows us how much work and research went into capturing Scottish culture and integrating it through the entire film.

And with the holiday season coming up, ""Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is also fantastic as you get the Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy.

A first for Pixar....first female director, the first fairy tale film and a film that focuses on a mother and daughter relationship.  But ""Brave"" is much more than that!  It's a film that is strong on storytelling, featuring wonderful acting but also, ""Brave"" is one of the most impressive Blu-ray releases I have ever seen and heard in my years of reviewing Blu-ray releases.

""Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition"" is a must-own, must-buy Blu-ray release!  And is highly recommended and deserving of five stars!",1354233600,5,9858,4.976132190942472
1151995,5,7799133104,"Pixar's 2012 animated feature Brave stands apart from the wealth of princess-based movies which came before it. Where most princesses sit around gazing moonily at a bird and hoping for a prince to rescue them, Merida picks up her own sword, takes charge of her own life, and at the end of the film, is still proudly carving her own path - putting off thoughts of marriage until later.

It is quite clear from the very beginning that the team at Pixar knew what they were doing in the archery and sword-fighting scenes. I've taken medieval swordfighting classes for several years and have spent far more years attending reenactments and watching swordplay. The movements in Brave are nearly perfect; in many cases they were exactly what I was taught to do. I remember thinking, in a pivotal scene where Merida holds off an assailant with her sword, ""hey, I know that pose!""

In the commentary we learn that the team did know how to sword-fight and mapped out all the combat sequences in real life before transferring them to the screen. So these aren't just fantasy versions of sword fights. They are realistic, authentic looks as to how these swords were handled.

The same is true for the archery. They show the details about how the arrow bends as it flies, the way the bow is held, and so on.

It's true that Merida's mom is not thrilled about Merida's sword-and-bow interests, but that conflict between mother and daughter is the whole heart of the film. Merida's mom has one, specific track in mind her for daughter - become part of a clan merger. And, to be fair, this was often the way marriage was in medieval times. Nobles had to ensure their land was protected and their borders secure. It was a quite practical situation. So the mother's stance is understandable. So is the daughter's.

I give the story great praise. Sure, it's a bit predictable. We could almost recite some of the lines along with the characters, knowing what they were likely to say. Still, the underlying message is wonderful and miles apart from the 1937 Snow White. Snow White sat around waiting for her prince to come, with no thought of doing anything for herself. Merida has plenty she wants to do with her life, and has little interest in a prince coming to take control.

Well recommended.",1354233600,3,2278,4.668329177057356
1151996,5,7799133104,"I saw this movie with my boyfriend while it was in theaters, and I loved it so much I had to take my mom to watch it. It does have some questionable subject matter (ex. there are a few references to nudity) that make it somewhat inappropriate for the younger audiences. The basic theme is 'finding your own destiny', and the main character certainly breaks quite a few rules to do so. In the end though, she realizes what her mistakes were and is deeply sorry for them; which in turn makes her and her mother closer. Kinda sounds like my teenage years...",1354233600,,554,4.388349514563107

Regardless of what some think is unnecessary, that is what fairy tales are, so I missed it. That said, I loved that she was her own person and she made the right decisions to get out of a bind. This is what I want my daughter to do, be her own person, making her own decision and then finding the perfect prince charming, because he will be an awesome guy that respects her.

Of course, my teen & toddler both enjoyed it and they watch it often. After watching it again, it sort of grew on me. I initially expected it to be a story about a teenager and her struggle for independence. It wasn't so much about that as her bonding with her mother and the two of them coming to understand one another's point of view. Good nonetheless.",1354233600,,516,4.275510204081633

The trailer made it out to be more of an adventure film but instead we got a cheesy and unoriginal animated feature. This may be because they replaced directors mid-film. We'll never know what was originally intended for Brave and while it may be a shame, there's no use trying to find a masterpiece where this is none.",1354233600,16,447,4.818181818181818

I do have the digital copy version of the movie and it does not work with my kindle. I notice that they now have ultraviolet copies of certain movies that will work. Wish they would make those available as an upgrade to customers who bought movies through amazon prior to the release of ultraviolet, expecting digital copies to work on kindles.

Loved the movie though. Really cute. A little scary for our 3 year old, but she still likes to watch it. She just runs onto someones lap for the bear parts.",1354147200,,891,4.241176470588235

There really wasn't a bad guy like most Disney movies; however, it didn't take away from the story. There was a lot of humor to the movie that propelled the story and kept you interested.

1152522,5,7799133104,"Possible spoilers ahead.

I'm going to begin by saying I am a 21 year old who absolutely loves animated movies.  For a long time, I would have considered Finding Nemo to be my favorite Disney/Pixar, but Brave effortlessly replaced it with its Celtic charm and lovable characters.

This movie was excellent.  The animation is stunning, the characters are quirky and interesting, and although the plot is short it really covers everything they could have done with this plot.  It was nice to see a princess who finally didn't end up with the man and openly admitted that she may never be interested in getting married, ever.  It's much more common to see the princess fall in love and leave happily ever after, especially with Disney, so it was definitely refreshing to see the princess taking the front seat and controlling her own life rather than letting the men in her life control her.  Feminist thoughts aside, the characters in the movie were enjoyable (adore the little brothers... ""wee devils, more like!"") and the visual representation of Scotland is breathtaking, as most Pixar animation tends to be.

Those who are complaining about the nudity and humor (""feast yer eyes!""...it's funny because traditionally, men wear nothing beneath their kilt) have clearly never seen what else their kids are watching on television (seriously, if your kid is watching Spongebob, Adventure Time, The Fairly Oddparents, etc., they've seen almost literally the same thing).  Seriously, Merida is a great influence for the little girls of this generation:  Merida can teach them that they are able to make their own choices and they do not always have to follow tradition.

While the movie was short and I do believe they could have made it a little bit longer and a little more suspenseful, but if you didn't tear up a wee bit during the climax, you may have missed the point of it, and that is a shame.",1354060800,,1896,4.857142857142857

As it is, this movie doesn't have a single significant adult male character which isn't the cartoon representations of some form of stupid, evil, or awkward.  Only the mother and daughter come close to being normal in both their cartoon physical form and character representation.

The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it is still scary for younger girls.  My 5 year old was truly terrified.  The bears are frightening and confusing.

After the first 15 mn I really felt uncomfortable and God knows

Finally I hated it.
It only takes one person to have a bad marriage.
Brave is a result of this marriage.
Unfortunately some beautiful images didn't fool me.
Lack of everything and no substance.

of Pixar's work, but I'll still take it over 95% of the Hollywood films I've seen this year. It never bored me, it made
me smile a lot, laugh a little, and was a more touching look at the complexity of mother and daughter
relationships than most 'grown-up' films that try to deal with the subject.

It also has a heroine who is a spunky, tough and first rate advocate for girl power, while still being heart-meltingly vulnerable
at just the right moments.

It has tremendously talented voice actors in Billy Connolly, Kelly Maccdonald, and especially Emma Thompson.

Most important, it has a twist half-way through that takes it in a delightfully unexpected direction. I will admit, for the first
half I was a bit under-whelmed, The film seemed more Disney than Pixar,with 'safe' humor and ideas. Just a touch disappointingly predictable.
But then a witch gets involved in this medieval Scottish tale, and with a twist that's more Shakespearian comedy than Disney, suddenly this is
a new film we haven't seen before. The second half easily won me back over, and I was left feeling, as I always seem to be, that working
for Pixar must be just about the greatest job in movies.",1353974400,,1292,4.758928571428571

As soon as my daughter was born, I started to build my collection.  I have my collection in VHS, but wanted Blu-Ray.  Blu-Ray is awesome.  Now, let's get to this review...

  The accent on the main character is really bad.  There is no consistency with her accent, which really takes away from the story of the movie.  Not that the story is that great.  Spoiler...  A young princess runs away, meets a witch, her mother turns into a bear, and she has to learn that she loves her mother even when her mother is cross, and all that jazz.  Her mother becomes normal again, but let's face it, this movie isn't normal, IT IS WEIRD!!

  I have never been great at reviewing movies, but I bought this one and regret having done so... My daughter has made me take it out of the player 3 times in the past week because she just isn't interested.  Her movie of choice over this one?  Tangled of course.

1153285,3,7799133104,"We purchased this movie sight unseen because it was Pixar. We expected it to be as excellent as their other animated films (Cars - the first one, Toy Story, Up, etc). It isn't. I'm not really sure why it got such high ratings.

Yes, the main character is fun, she's strong, she's witty, she has a mind of her own. Still, the overall storyline is weak in many ways. And really, although it was presented differently in this film, a family member turning into a bear has been done (remember Brother Bear?).

The voice actors were well chosen, the animation itself is absolutely beautiful, but we certainly wish we had rented this before purchasing. Next time we'll know better.

I agree with those who say that Pixar isn't what it was prior to the Disney merge, but really, did anyone expect it to be? I know I didn't. It's really too bad. Pixar had a great thing going. They were 'old style' Disney, something I think Walt would have been proud of. Maybe the next attempt will be better.

I thought this was going to be an empowering movie for young girls to see, but it fell super short. Loved the graphics, her dress, hair and that she is a tough girl, but that doesn't mean that she should go on an impulse, that she can't think things through. All I saw was be free, do what makes you feel happy and even after you destroy your family with grief, things will be the way you always intended it to be. BLAH...I think I'm waiting a long long time before I show this to my 3 year old. I don't expect to be able to protect them forever, but I do find that relativism is harder to deal with than any other thing in this world. Do what makes you happy and you can't go wrong!!! BIG NO NO. Do what God would want you to do, even if it's something you don't want to do, bc in the end God knows what is best. I was disappointed in the whole plot. Instead of forcing someone to marry someone (which is true historically, but not really applicable in this age), it could have been a story line like that of the Little Mermaid III, where at first she doesn't understand why her mom would make her do certain things, but then it turns out how mom was right all along. Not go on an impulse without thinking things through (like Tangled, where Rupunzel DID think things through). The 4th king (refering to shakespeare's macbeth) had consequences, but as a girl, everything I (or any girl) will do, will in the end turn out okay no matter what. I'm sorry...I don't mean to be so uptight about this issue, it's just a hard reality check that there are less and less quality movies being made these days.",1353888000,7,1692,4.2092307692307696

1153620,1,7799133104,"I am a fan of Pixar movies.  All of them have been anywhere from very good to masterpiece level...until Brave.  This movie can only be described as despicable.  It is rated PG, but it might as well be PG-13, as it should not be shown to any children under 12 (or actually no one under the age of 30 should see this movie).  The only good part about this movie is the beautiful cinematography, but otherwise its trash:

1. The movie simply advocates for a radical sort of rebellion by a teenage girl.  Yes, supposedly she is sorry and remorseful, but if that is so then why does everything go her way at the end anyway, and she changes her mother like she wanted to in the first place.  Come on teenage girls, rebel against your mother as best you can, then cry when you nearly destroy your family and then your family will do what you wanted them to do in the first place.  This movie is a recipe for disaster in any family.

2. The is a dream movie for ultra-feminists.  Not the true feminists who want equality and opportunity for women, but the ones who feel the presence of males is superfluous, and women can do everything themselves without any males being present.  They do everything right while the men and boys are no better than a bunch of monkeys (sorry if I insult any monkeys for comparing them with the male characters in this cartoon).

3. The violence of this movie is way beyond anything children should see.  I guess with kids these days exposed to violent video games and movies without parental supervision, this movie may be not a shocker, but for any normal kid living a normal kid's life, this will simply bring your boy or girl nightmares.

4. The theme of this movie is:  get rid of any traditions and set your own path.  Freedom, finding your own love, no input from mother or family, that's the way a girl should act.  Then if you end up in poverty with 3 kids from 3 different boyfriends, that's alright, you made your own decisions, or paraphrasing the cartoon, you have set your own fate (and set the fate of your family towards certain disaster).

5. This is the closest a cartoon has ever gotten to being a form of child abuse.  It can only confuse good kids and make not-so good kids believe that their overbearing mother and stupid father are the cause of all their problems.  The supposedly redeaming quality of the ending again would only make sense if the girl would actually make the right decision in the end and listen to what her parents asked her to do.  But essentially nowhere in the movie does the daughter listen to her parent's commands, from beginning to end.

6.  Some have commented on the crass humor and inappropriate images, but these are the least of the problems of this movie.  The violence and the radical propaganda are what make this movie a piece of garbage.

Shame on you Pixar, you have completely lost your senses and the respect of this former fan of yours.",1353888000,19,2922,4.4576271186440675

The movie is mostly about the relationship of two strong women, Merida and her mother. This is an important story. It is important that it sets strong role models for young girls and it expands the pantheon of Disney princesses.

Merida is a master at riding her horse Angus and is an extremely skilled archer. As with many teenage women Merida is at odds with her traditionally minded mother. In the scene when Merida declares, ""I am Merida. Firstborn descendant of Clan DunBroch. And I'll be shooting for my own hand!""

The 3D is wonderful, though there are not alot of pop outs, the depth is fantastic. It really helps to show the vastness of the movie. Even while watching in 3D this movie doesn't lose alot of color, which is a big plus. My only complaint with the 3D is that is doesn't full up the whole screen, you get the black bars on top and bottom, and I think that kind of hurts a 3D movie, but that's just my opinion.

The story itself was really great. It was nice to see such a strong willed female lead. I have read a few negative reviews about nudity, but there is no need to worry, it was just a few bare butts and nothing else, hell you see worse on TV.

1153769,3,7799133104,"A girl with wild hair, being adventurous, defying custom and owning a bow; what's not to like about this story, right?  Well, that's what I thought going in.  I had heard quite a bit about this movie and decided I should probably watch it.  It was ok, but it certainly didn't make me use up that whole box of tissues like most Pixar movies do (the first five minutes of UP anyone?).

Merida is a young princess growing up in the woodlands of Scotland.  Her mother tries to teach her to be the perfect lady, but Merida would rather be out with her horse Angus, shooting arrows at targets and having adventures in the woods.  When it comes time for three suitors to compete for her hand, Merida decides she'll have none of it and comes in contact with a witch who promises to help her change her mother so she won't have to go through with the marriage.  The problem is, it changes her mom a little too much, and into something that her dad is not very fond of.  And only Merida can fix the problem.

Ok, this might be a spoiler of sorts, but I kind of think Merida is a bit of a sociopath.  Take the potion, her mother is doubled over in pain and instead of thinking that maybe she poisoned her and she should get help, Merida is more concerned on if her mother's changed her mind about the marriage.  Then later on she watches her mother eat a few berries and then only tells her about the fact that they are poison and giggles while she sputters them out.  To me that is just a bit crazy.  Sure Merida has some good aspects, she's disciplined in her practice of the bow and arrow, will try to save her mom, and gets along well with her brothers.  But my goodness she can be quite scary as well.  Her mother I thought was very sweet in contrast.  Sure she doesn't want to listen to Merida's wishes, but really for that time in history she was doing what she was supposed to.  And Merida's dad was just comic relief sadly and not a figure you could learn from in this story; her brothers were the same type of characters.  I just couldn't really feel connected to any of the characters though.

Voice Cast:
Kelly Macdonald: Merida
Emma Thompson: Queen Elinor
Billy Connolly: King Fergus
Julie Walters: Witch
Robbie Coltrane: Lord Dingwall
Kevin McKidd: Lord MacGuffin and son
Craig Ferguson: Lord Macintosh

I think all of the voice cast did a good job.  The Scottish accent was certainly there and Macdonald had enough spunk for Merida.  Thompson as Elinor was calming although she could raise her voice if need be.  All the guys were the bumbling sort that the movie cast them as.

The plot certainly wasn't what I expected it to be.  From the previews I thought Merida would be going on adventures and saving her country or something.  That was not the case.  She was just saving her mother from a mess that she had made and learning a little life lesson about not trying to change your own fate for selfish reason.  The problem is that the storyline was a bit convoluted and since this is a kid's movie, I'm not sure that younger or more immature kids could actually get any sort of lesson out of the movie.  There were some tender moments between Merida and her mom, and those were nicely done, but they were still offset by the times that Merida was a bit socio-pathic.  And quite frankly, the pace was so fast that it was a whirlwind trying to make anything of the life lessons the movie was teaching at times.  I wanted to like it, I really did, but while being a cute story about a mother-daughter relationship, it didn't use Merida to her full potential or keep my interest.  It should also be noted, that since this is a kid's movie, that there is some violence, especially towards a very scary bear.  It could be frightening for some.

What was good was the animation.  I always like Pixar and its films and this was no different.  Fantastic use of color, especially in Merida's hair, and even without watching it in 3D it was still wonderfully involving.  I especially liked the way they portrayed the Willow the Wisps.  The music too was very nice and I liked the Scottish theme it had.  They even had Bagpipes.  And ""Touch the Sky"" had that right element of adventure and bravery to its lyrics.

An ok movie, it had the wonder of Pixar's animation and great music, but just a lackluster plot and characters that would merely rate average.  It won't stop me from watching Pixar, but I may have to go re-watch Up to regain my love of Pixar.

As for the story, It's about the age old struggle regarding family values, tradition, self fulfillment and the willingness to see the world through another's eyes. It's a coming of age story for not only the teenage protagonist Merida, but for all the people around her.

In a way Disney is showing us how they are learning this lesson. They have been of the old belief that there must be a one-dimensional villain. Their latest collaborations with Pixar has prodded them to change this. Yes, there is a peripheral ""big bad monster"" but he is on the edges of the story and not a direct driver of the story.

In this movie the village is obsessed with the fear and loathing of bears. Because of peculiar circumstance they learn that maybe bears aren't so bad after all. That's not the main story line but it is a lesson to think about.",1353801600,,1045,4.577540106951871

1154184,3,7799133104,"Being a digital artist myself, seeing epic or moving animated movies that are extremely well thought out, animated, and put together is part of what inspires me and keeps me going.  This wasn't really one of those movies but it's enjoyable.

The plot line, which is no doubt what most people watch for, is mildly entertaining and predictable to a point.  It has several noticeable incongruities and odd 'turns' that make little sense but pretty much have to be there for the movie to get on with the plot.  A lot of it has to do with developing the characters, especially Merida's mother.  She suddenly has, to me, a mostly inexplicable change off heart.  The rest of the characters stay static; except for Merida... somewhat.  I don't get the feeling that she's genuinely changed but doing things to save her mother.

Compared to other extraordinary Pixar and animated films in recent times, there is nothing about this movie's rendering and appearance that is superb.  Everything is standard fair.  The only aesthetic palette teaser is Merida's hair.  There's no breaking the mold with 3D here.

That said... it's -okay-.  I'd watch it again for entertainment purposes and mothers/daughters alike can take a lesson from the power struggle.",1353801600,,1241,4.966019417475728

1154186,4,7799133104,"Disney did it again. Although there is a misconception about the plot of the movie when you watch the  trailer, Brave still captures it's audience with stunning animation and non-stop suspense throughout. I gave this movie a four star rating because of the predictable story line and dialog that has plagued Disney animated films for quite some time, but since this movie was aimed at children aged 6-10 and their parents, then it serves the demographic well.

1154490,4,7799133104,"As usual, I read the one star reviews before I actually saw this movie, and I have to say - there are some serious spazzes out there.  People were talking about how dark and horrifying this movie was, with small children running screaming from the theater and protective mothers preparing to make a dash, which, frankly, gave me even more motivation to watch the film.  I have to wonder what pile of powder puffs these people have been living under, because this movie was hardly the dark, gory nightmare they made it out to be.  I mean seriously, what kind of lies has a parent been telling a child for them to be crying over a bear eating fish? Come on people!  The reviews I read had me thinking I was going to see something entirely different from what really happened.

There's a maid whose cleavage is rather prominent (not spilling out of her clothes, but the cleavage of a full figured woman in clothing that a woman of her station would have worn during that time period), but it's suited to her figure - frankly, big girls have big breasts, and big breasts make for noticeable cleavage.  I didn't find it offensive, but accurate. Kids see more on regular tv, the internet, [home] and magazines than what was shown in this movie.  The only other thing that some may have found offensive were the bare bottoms of the clansmen when they had to use their kilts to get off the roof after the triplets locked them up there. And there was the ridiculous fighting between clans due to the delay in a decision on the suitors, but there's a greater message lost on those who get caught up in the superficial.

The mother/daughter rift and emotions were real.  Elinor's doing her best to prepare her daughter for what seems to be inevitable [according to tradition], Merida isn't ready and thinks it's all unfair (especially given they just dropped the bomb on her, no warning this was about to happen at all) - most of us would feel the same way about being forced by tradition to do something you neither want or are ready to face, never mind the fact that the sons she had to chose from were seriously lacking in so many ways and downright unappealing.  Elinor is the calm in the storm.  She's smart, composed, and commands respect just by her presence - and she's trying her hardest to teach her daughter the importance of these traits in their environment, but Merida is daddy's unruly girl and bucks at the constraint of her mother's constant chiding, correcting and teaching - she just wants to be herself.  All of it is understandable and real.  They both learn something about themselves via the spell and gain a new respect for each others differences - daughter applies a lot of mother's long-taught lessons (kids are listening even when you think they aren't) and mother finds a strength and freedom she didn't know she had.

Some people ask, ""why a bear?""  Why not a bear? Would a talking frog have gotten the point across about the strength of a mother's love and protection? No.  The humor wasn't quite on par with what we're accustomed to, I'd agree that it's more slapstick than wit, and there is something lacking between the realization that the old woman's a witch and the decision to ask her to change Elinor (happened too fast, no questions or thought, just a knee-jerk decision (which some people do in real life) - but there is a lesson to be learned from that too).  It's a bit disappointing that Merida didn't get to use her archery skills in a more heroic way, but maybe that's the reality of her existence and part of what will eventually make her a good queen.  The triplets and the maid were fun.  The men were reduced practically to oafs, in that boys-will-be-boys sort of way (embellish the truth, fight now ask questions later), which was rather disappointing considering they were leaders, but at the same time it's refreshing not to see the usual perfect, buttoned-up royals that Disney tends to portray.  Given the men's, behavior though, there's no wonder Elinor is always so restrained and worried about her daughter.  I also understand how some people felt mislead by the title and previews - but that's what studios do nowadays with most movies, they feed you the best parts through the previews and leave you wanting during the actual movie - marketing at it's best.  As it turns out, the title doesn't just apply to our little red-headed heroine, but her mother as well - it does, however, over-sell what the movie is really about.  All that being said, it's a very Disney movie, but it was enjoyable and reflective.",1353715200,,4557,4.619578686493185

She was an awesome character, and Kelly MacDonald was a perfect choice (even if I kept picturing her role in Boardwalk Empire)...the rest of the cast was great.

I had a lot of fun watching this with my toddler (when she actually paid attention).  It's not violent; I was surprised they were able to make this type of movie without any gratuitious violent, but it had much less fighting than a movie such as Hercules.

I was also interested in it because a friend had mentioned it touches nicely upon the relationship between a spunky teenager and proper mother - a circumstance in my household.

I must admit the majority of the reviews are spot on and well written.  The movie is heart warming, delivers a good message, and is very entertaining.  My whole family enjoyed it.

Now, to those who say it was too violent, showed too much skin, and had witchcraft in it, well, too each his own, it didn't bother my 7 year old one bit.  Some folks took their toddlers and pre-K aged children to this movie.  All I can say is, ""What were you thinking?"".  The movie has a PG rating, not G, so responsible and informed parents shouldn't take pre-K kids, in my opinion, as a general rule.

In closing, a good and enjoyable movie with a heart warming theme, especially for proper mothers with spirited daughters - but leave the toddlers at home unless the rough and tumble Saturday morning cartoons don't bother them.

It is very well scripted showing the relationship between a demanding mother and a rebellious daughter and the outcome left me in tears...everytime I watched it.  The colors are beautiful and the storyline is definitely keeping with a Pixar animation.  Frankly it's very funny and I enjoyed this every time I watched it.

Overall it wasn't quite what I'd hoped; a good story with many funny/touching moments but a relatively thin plot, that focuses more on the bond between mother and daughter than on anything as epic as the trailer led me to believe.  Merida is a likable enough heroine, and the supporting cast are all well played, and the three little brothers are adorable in their otherwise silent mischief.  So while not a great film like past efforts such as ""Shrek"" or ""Ratatouille"" it's still quite enjoyable, and most definitely a good family film.",1353715200,,665,4.765217391304348

A young warrior princess, Merida, rebels against her family's attempts to arrange a marriage for her.  She journeys into the woods and finds a witch, who allows Merida to cast a spell on her mother (turning her into a giant bear).  Through adventures, and her father attempting to hunt the bear, both Merida and her family realize that allowing each to find their own destiny is best.

The visuals, and particularly the scenery and background, are lush and gorgeous.  Pixar continues to push the boundaries of animation and the movie is a treat to watch.  They continue to improve the animation of the animals and the people. And as usual for Pixar, the story is fresh and original, though in this case it feels like a traditional Scottish fairy tale.

However, the movie quickly turns into a road that has been all too well-traveled. How many movies can you name where the main character doesn't like the situation they are in, turns to witches and magic, doesn't get what they bargain for and the rest of the movie is based on fixing that problem?

Answer: too many

Obviously, that's where I think the movie lacks originality. Tired of the same ol' thing from Disney. Hoping whoever is left from the original Pixar crew will stand up to what's helped them become such a success story and go back to those unique and fresh elements.

Just an honest opinion, but another movie with this same plot and Pixar will RIP in my book.",1353715200,27,779,4.51063829787234
1155676,2,7799133104,"Despite the quality animation, I could not identify with the decision of the main character to put her strict but caring mother in danger merely to satisfy her selfish ends.  We were reminded of a standard Disney theme: headstrong young female defies parental authority and although her life is threatened and many other lives are put at risk, ultimately everyone has 'learned' from this selfish person and she is gloriously rewarded for her defiance.

Yes she was unaware of the risks she was taking, but that's the definition of selfishness - not taking any time to consider the consequences your actions might have on others.

1155723,5,7799133104,"I do not know why this story has gotten so many bad reviews.  For one, I have to say the scary scenes are not so scary.  Both of my girls must just be Brave and Strong young girls, because both of them don't seem to be bothered by the movie.  Now we did purchase the book a while ago and have read the story to them a number of times and discussed the scary scenes.  We also sat down as a family, made popcorn and watched it all together with our 6yr old and almost 4yr old.  I have to say there are some parts that I was not a fan of--for instance how she visits a witch to change her mother and that the food was left around for her brothers to eat.  But the hype about the nudity and every thing else...what are we puritans.  My girls didn't even seem to notice that the boys were naked.  I thought I was a wonderful story about how some traditions should be changed and left behind!!!! Like marrying your daughters off at a young age, making them wear outdated clothing and arranging their marriages.

Hence the break from tradition, which all the young men were happy about as well.  It was refreshing to have a movie that showed how a girl could be strong and not have to ""live happily ever after"" and marry prince charming. Or be saved by a man.  It showed how she must figure out how to make things right through problem-solving. My husband and I believe our two daughters need to learn to rely on themselves and someday, as I did, find a wonderful man to share their lives.  We do not believe that our girls need a man to be complete--nor should a man need a woman--they should be healthy independent persons who are not co-dependent.

I thought it was a delightful show that let you see how both mother and daughter were not listening to one another and after mom gets changed into a bear, they spend time mending and bonding together.  I have to say, parents sometimes get very hung up in having to have things their way and do not listen to their children.  I am also guilty at times--no one is perfect.  I liked how the bonds were mended both concretely for young children (with the tapestry), verbally and physically for older children and parents.

I went into this movie thinking I was going to see the story of a princess who fights to keep her freedom...and to be honest I kind of got that for the first 20 minutes of the movie.  She quickly looses the battle has a tantrum and runs away, gets a potion from a witch and turns her mom and 3 siblings into bears.  Then realizes that maybe she shouldn't have done that and tries to get an antidote before her father kills said bears.  I found the story to be very boring and in general badly written.  I didn't care about any of the characters, which surprises me so much as this came from Pixar and they ALWAYS get me to care about the characters.  The animation was stunning that's why it gets 2 stars.",1353628800,5,769,4.197278911564626

The ""nudity"" people complained about is laughable -- surely everyone knows about Scotland & kilts. A few butts is hardly any worse than Shrek (not Disney, I realize) saying, ""I've got to save me a$$!"".

However, I was turned off right from the title and cover shots of the film, which reminded me too much of Braveheart.

First thing first. its not a kids movie in any sense. My 5 year and 6 year were terrified watching it. The trailer is very misleading, the trailer is the best part of the movie. The movie is very dark (literally). Only at few places you can see green grasses and sunlight, otherwise its always night or evening (remember lords of the ring?). But the trailer shows you otherwise. Everyone is very uncultured in the movie. No body listen to anyone. Father do not listen to mom, mom don't listen to daughter, daughter don't listen to mom and so on. Even the guests do not listen to the host and quarrel all the time. So nobody talks to anyone, they just do what they want and so everyone is brave in this movie. Showing a$$ , showing cleavage are part of the humor so be warned if you are showing it to children.
There is no bravery (it does not connect with the story), no suspense, and no story. I can't believe someone in pixar approved this two step storyline. Marvel atleast write some story for their characters.

You may be tempted to watch a pixar animation, but I am warning you. The only thing good about this movie is Merida's red hair.",1353542400,16,1312,4.377049180327869

1155923,4,7799133104,"Impressive at Brave was on the big screen, there's something intensely dazzling to see it in Blu-ray. The almost infinite details fill every millimeter of the home screen.

Brave is a sweeping epic tale, but it's also an intimate examination of mother/daughter relationship. Although I enjoyed the film and saw it twice in theaters, as a dad and husband, I found the scene in which Merida gives her mother something to ingest that could be extremely harmful or fateful, is kind of difficult to take. Merida then snaps into denial of wrongdoing, which pushes more than a few buttons.

But I'm not a Mom or a daughter. When I saw the film with two sets of each, they resoundingly loved the film with absolutely no reservations. Being mothers of teen daughters, they each agreed that of course, the girl would be driven to risk anything to make her mother change, not considering the consequences and, yes, not owning up to it.

How Merida does face the impact of her actions, the fate of the kingdom, and her parental issues, is the heart of Brave, and what you must experience from beginning to end. Few films, animated or not, take a character through such a character arc in such a plausible, believable way. The Brady Bunch this ain't.

The magnificent score by Patrick Doyle is as epic as the film, and the voice cast is ideal. Pains were taken to make things as authentic as possible, as evidenced by the bonus features.

And what a feast of bonus features there are, at least on the Blu-ray. The DVD does contain the audio commentary (thank you!) and two short films, but depending on which Blu-ray set you choose, you get a lot of cool stuff.

Basically the 3-disc ""Ultimate Collector's Edition"" includes everything that the 5-disc Disney/Pixar's Brave: The Ultimate Collector's Edition does except for a Blu-ray 3-D disc and a digital download disc.

1155924,4,7799133104,"A warm, cozy fairy tale that feels more like a Disney production than the latest entry in Pixar's storybook. It's sweet, quirky and funny, but routinely falls back on familiar motifs and often seems criminally under-explored. Since the vast majority of the action takes place in and around a single locale, there's a claustrophobic quality in the air that never truly dissipates, which robs us of the grand scale that's been present in every one of the animation factory's preceding works. It's no more than a straightforward telling of a reasonably interesting fable, with only a few short jolts of the unique character and timely laughs I've come to expect from the troupe. Of course, there's no arguing the fact that Pixar knows how to produce gorgeous scenery, and Brave is yet another leap forward in that regard; the surrounding landscapes are unanimously breathtaking, and Princess Merida's hair is constantly bouncy and lifelike, truly a character unto itself. It's an enjoyable fresh ride and a marked improvement over the lifeless Cars 2, but misses the depth and flair that made me fall so deeply in love with the studio's classics.",1353456000,,1143,5.021052631578947

1155926,4,7799133104,"I wish I could say I got to see most of it, or even half of it.  For me, it is a pet peeve, when movies are made to be seen in total darkness (i.e.. in a theater.)  Such movies do not translate well in a home environment ..... unless watched without any lights on, and with black-out curtains.

I do not always sit, inactive, on a couch to watch TV.  I like to watch movies while working on crafts, or other activities in my home office.  Turning off all the lights sort of inhibits my ability to multi-task in this way.

I've grown to expect bad lighting in live action movies, but with animation........?  That's just poor crafting on the part of the artists and producers.

Wise up, people (movie creators)!  If you intend to rake in extra revenue in after-theater sales of DVD's and Blue-Ray, at least make them viewable.  I turned off every light in my room, so I wouldn't be watching the bookcase reflection from behind me, and craft light on my desk; and I STILL ended up just listening to the dialogue while staring at my own face reflected from my monitor (Amazon Instant Video.)  I certainly don't want to pay to see a movie, and get the dubious pleasure of watching my annoyed self squinting/straining to see what was happening, on screen.

Mine is a review of the 'product', not the story or acting (voices.)  In the review instructions, Amazon states, ""Reviews must contain at least 20 words about the PRODUCT.""  Don't get me wrong, I thought the story was very sweet, and had an enlightened, but not illuminated, message (earning my 4 stars.) To be fair, I did not want to bring down the average for the overall rating, just because I was not watching in an ideal setting.",1353456000,2,1686,4.467320261437909

I loved this movie for the fact that it shows my 3 year old she doesn't need to be a perfect girl to be a princess. I absolutely loved the rough around the edges approach Disney & Pixar took with this. I'm by no means a violent person, but the ""violence"" that was depicted in the film was kid-friendly enough. My 3 year old hasn't shown any interest in becoming a killer of bears or anything unusual. To note- we live by a plant-based diet & definitely don't recommend the unnecessary killing of animals. I also liked that there was a real relationship depicted between Merida & her mother. It's not always an agreeable & happy time in real families & this showed how, while much more magical, there are always issues between family members because they are different personalities. I also appreciated that she was in the stable taking care of her horse showing that, while she's a princess, she still has responsibilities to tend to.

BUT, not only did I love this movie, my husband (and even tougher critic) also loved this movie.  My daughter got this movie as a surprise this week, not because she wanted it (though she did, she asked for it every time she saw a picture of Merida anywhere) but because my husband and I wanted it for ourselves LOL!!!  It's seriously a great movie, funny, and touching with a good lesson, and a little action in there too.  Just a really great movie all around.

After reading a few other reviews, I thought I should add that if you are offended by animated butts, or bears eating ""live"" fish, this movie is not for you.  Also, if you expect a children's movie to be the movie of a century with sub plots and rhetoric fit to engender hour long conversations, this probably isn't for you either.

I love that it features a girl heroine, and I love the moody, beautiful Scottish setting and corresponding animation (5 stars for that.) But I was disappointed in the story, and felt some of the magic fell flat (3 stars on that, for a 4 overall.) The accents were also a bit difficult for my kids to follow at times, and there wasn't the warmth and humor in this that the best Pixar films have. There were flashes of it, but it wasn't consistent. I also found myself doing  a lot of explaining, partly because of the accent issues, and partly because some of the plot lines were a little over my kids' heads. I have read that this movie changed hands internally at Pixar several times, and it feels that way - a little disjointed and unsure of its identity. It doesn't have that 'vision' quality that their best films do. But it is gorgeous, and Merida is a lovely and fun character.",1353369600,2,956,4.281767955801105

She was foolish and got herself into trouble, and then panicked about how to fix it. I had expected more heroism on her part. Something equivalent to selflessly running into a burning building. It just never happened. She ended up crying and - ta da! - wouldn't you know it, that... somehow... solved it. Huh. I just don't buy into the ""strong female lead"" thing with Merida.

This movie was not what I expected at all. The main ""twist"" in the plot took it down 10 notches from ""Oh, this could be really interesting!"" to ""...oh, I really am watching a kid's movie, aren't I."" Another case of a misleading trailer sucking me in.

For basic entertainment, it's OK. But, I strongly believe it was over hyped and mis-marketed just to get our ticket money. I left the theater feeling unsatisfied.

There is a definite disconnection between the words mouthed by the human actors and the mouth movements of the animated figures. At times it's almost as if sound is not quite synchronized to picture, but with this Blu-Ray recording, the synchronization is of course exact. Or, it's as if (almost) the picture has been dubbed into a foreign language. This is especially true where the faces, like that of the heroine, are greatly simplified, rounded, smoothed and stylized. With grotesque faces, such as that of the witch, where extreme facial distortions are employed by the animators, the lip-syncing is perfectly convincing. A fuller range of facial muscles appear to be forming the words, and the result is presented as far more convincingly human.

It's a small quibble indeed. I had not seen any animated film in years; they just never drew me in. They all were so childish, and none captured my attention. This one draws me in completely, and as someone who is sixty-eight, my tastes have become jaded.

1156151,4,7799133104,"One reason we have never let our kids watch The Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition), is because of how disrespectful Ariel is. The whole story is based on her disobedience and disrespect for her father. Not to mention Disney isn't known for having strong, good mother figures (most mothers are evil or non-existent).

So as we are sitting watching Brave, my wife keeps looking at me with that look of, ""There is no way our kids are going to watch this movie and not think its okay to disrespect your folks. In addition, it will probably happen in the end that the disrespect will get overlooked in light of some greater threat.""

But we stuck through it and have to say we really, really liked the story in the end.

The animation was top-notch for sure, no questions Pixar would do anything less than excellent.

The humor is throughout and entertaining.

The movie finished about twenty minutes ago and there is no blood in the movie. . .from what I can remember.

The violence against others is in Three Stooges humor, defending one's self, or chasing something evil.

SPOILER:

Even when the heroine realizes a witch is involved, she doesn't hesitate to ask the witch for help. Doesn't this communicate that it's okay to seek power from ""evil"" sources is okay? The characters even make fun early on that the dad doesn't believe in magic and how silly he is for such things. I could just imagine some teens standing up in the theaters shouting, ""Wiccas Unite!!""

I love Merida's fiery red hair and her independent spirit. I love her oafish father and her prim mother.

That being said, I thought this movie had elements in it that go right over anyone eight and under's head. Choosing between suitors for the good of the country? Do young kids even know what a suitor is? Or why alliances between countries were formed often times though marriage?

This movie is also dark, scary and violent at times, with a freaky witch and some very intense bear scenes. My five year old flew off her chair and landed in my lap. My seven year old was closing her eyes and covering her ears.

Those scenes aside, there is much humor in this movie and I found myself laughing as loud as the kids, and there is also touching, sentimental scenes where a tear or two might appear.

This is a movie where parents will have to be the judge. A tender child might be traumatized after watching this, while a ""tougher"" child will find it all very exciting.

The witch for example, is not the ""friendliest"" character in the movie.  While Pixar tries to make a witch not scary and frightening, I believe she still comes across as such.  The bears attacking each other and the cursed bear can provide a few scary moments.

We (my husband and I) noticed first thing that the male characters were really secondary to the central theme, and loved it!  So many Disney stories, and fairy tales in general, have women as the main character, but they still seem to revolve around the men in the story.  It was refreshing to see a movie told entirely from the point of view of women who weren't consumed by love, devotion, or duty to some male in their life (alive or dead), or some ideal set forth by said male.  Ultimately, these women were focused on long-held feminine ideals: freedom, peace, and the preservation of family (or clan).

Finally a story told of the influence that women exert through intelligence, grace, dignity, and determination!  This movie made sure you saw the men hurrying to punch each other out , while the women made the biggest impact simply by crossing a room with dignity or by being eloquent.  Our history books often overlook the strength and influence that women have had throughout the ages, not by being warriors, but through sacrifice and diplomacy.  This movie reminds us that women have their own abilities, equal to and different from those of men, but just as amazing.

This movie was literally overflowing with female influence: yes, some of it with cleavage, but most of it with long sought and hard-won skill, patience, and determination.  A valuable lesson for our future women!",1353196800,,1483,4.691119691119691

Some would like to see the beginning cut so that the action starts sooner, I would say that you'd miss the exposition if it wasn't there.  I, for one, enjoyed every minute of it.  Some have said that the backgrounds were too realistic, I think the backgrounds (and all the animation) is just incredibly beautiful.  I would agree with the sentiment that it would have been nice to see more of the mother/daughter interaction, but then the movie would have been too long for the younger kids.  It's there appropriately, but when the mother and daughter's relationship changes it could have been a slower process and I'd have enjoyed it because I'm at an age where I can enjoy the subtle changes.  A ten-year-old wouldn't like that so I can understand the choice.  I've read all the negative reviews, but I just don't agree.  BRAVE is a great film.

As for this 5-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition - It's fine.  I would have liked a sound remix for the 2 channel Dolby.  The dialogue is slightly too weak or the musical soundtrack too loud.  But if you aren't listening to the film on internal TV speakers then you're fine.  It's all great and nothing too terribly distracting.  It's great that Disney included so many extras.

Being a Scot living abroad it was also nice to hear a lot of Scottish accents together (even if some were a bit dubious) and even I laughed heartily at trying to understand the ""Aberdonian"" accent of Lord MacGuffin's son.  It also made me a little home sick to see the beautiful Scottish scenery reflected in this cartoon - there is nowhere in the world like it.

My only concern about the movie itself would be that a lot of the humour felt very Scottish and I think it would be lost on your average American movie watcher.  The story was nothing special and there were several things that happened that were not explained.  Why a bear, for example?  Perhaps, I am just overthinking it a bit.

I was also disappointed in the 3D effects.  While it gave the scenery some depth it felt as if the movie had just been an old movie made in normal 2D and then converted into 3D.  There was some scenes that could have been made more dramatic by using the 3D effect in a more effective way.

As time went on, I began to see newer trailers/tv spots for the film, that left me in question.
Why are they marketing this as a down-right comedy now?
What's with the bear cub and the boobs thing?
Has Pixar lost their minds?

I saw the movie in theaters. I went in alone (as a film critic), still with very high expectations for the film despite the recent questionable advertisements it had.

The film starts out with Merida (the main character) as a little girl. It's her birthday, she gets a bow from her father as a gift. Little Merida goes into the forest to find her lost arrow, and finds what they call ""wisps"". She retrieves her lost arrow, and goes back to tell her parent what she saw,  and then her party gets crashed by a 15 foot monster bear. You'd think all of these things would connect later in the movie or help along the plot... but no. Seriously, this opening sequence has nothing to do with what the film is really about.

Turns out that Merida's mother arranged for her to get married, and the suitors are on their way. Merida doesn't want to get married, and tries to break tradition in her own way, and runs away to find a witch in the forest who gives her a cake that changes her mother into a bear. And because the spell didn't do what she wanted, Merida is trying to get a refund. That's it.

Really there's no need for the movie to be called ""Brave"" since there were no achievements in bravery in this film. I personally though that ""Rebel"" would've been a better title since it was basically all about Merida's rebellion against her mother, family, and cultural traditions. And they for some reason throw the 15 foot bear back into the movie, as well as comic nudity (which I found to be more on Dreamworks' level) and a ""hilarious"" moment where the bear cub lands in a heavy-set servant woman's boobs (which I found had Disney written all over it).

Basically, the animation was beautiful, but the story was a mess. They had too many ideas for the story and it felt like they wanted to please all the story writers so they shoved everything in. This is sad because at one time, Pixar prided themselves on story. Everyone knows if a film doesn't have a good story, it's not going to be good. There are so many examples of that courtesy of Dreamworks Animation (Shrek the Third, Bee Movie, Madagascar 1).

I really wanted Brave to be my new favorite Pixar movie, but it came up short. Just like Cars 2, I enjoyed the Pixar animated short film more than the actual feature film. I will buy Brave on DVD in due time, (since I am a hardcore Pixar fan, and I own every movie), but like Cars 2 (which I also have on DVD) I will rarely watch it.

Disney has very much taken over Pixar, and it's really starting to show ever since Cars 2. Let's hope that the Monster Inc prequel (Monsters University) doesn't disappoint.",1353024000,10,3071,4.394366197183099
1156285,4,7799133104,"Brave is one of the first original Pixar movies that just did not seem to have a very ... well thought out Storyline.  By the  end of the film I literally turned to my wife and said, "" what exactly was the story of this movie? "".  Really, here is the story.

The lead character is a princess who does not want to get married to a suitor ( never heard that one before ) and her mother "" trains "" her for this moment.  She doesn't like this at all, so she goes to a witch who gives her a cake that will "" change her mother "".  Yeah, the kid was that vague with what she wanted the witch to do.  Well, the mom is "" changed "" and then the kid is real sorry and goes on a hunt for a cure.  During the process, we see that the kid is very good with a Bow.

That is about it for the storyline.  Easily the weakest part of the film.  The best part, well, is everything else.  The animation is wonderful to behold on our Samsung 40' LED 120Hz tv.  Everything is as you would expect from a new Pixar film.  The voice acting is very much up to par.  The music is ... ok.  I don't like the live singing and all that but I guess you can deal with it.

This is one of the weakest original Pixar film's yet but that means it is still better then most of the other stuff out there already or coming soon in the CG animation department.

The three suitors are just obnoxious and they have no hope of growing into desirable princes.  Merida should have married the bear that ate her dads leg.  Or the horse.....the horse was a better catch than those three doofuses.

I guess Disney needed a new princess to market for the Christmas season. They needed a red head to stand out from the other cookie cutter princess and chose to make her Scottish so there would be a new clothing line for the dolls, costumes or whatever they are hawking this season.

It was incredible. It was dynamic. It was over too soon. The historical accuracy of getting married for purposes other than love was well done. I'm sure a lot of women did not want to get married or were just as free-spirited, but when it came down to it, you got married because you loved your family and inter-group peace and/or alliances are important. Even better was the fact that at no point did Merida have a romantic interest. Even once she learns of past kingdoms torn, she doesn't just all of a sudden fall for a guy and jump in the marriage saddle.

And I LOVED that the movie was about a girl who did not dream of getting married when she grew up. The pressure, both culturally and religiously, to get married is immense. So to have a heroine that bucks the getting married dream? Not the tired old 'I don't want to get married to this guy because I don't love him' or ' I don't want to get married yet', but straight up, not interested in marriage- ""I'll be shooting for my own hand!"" Heck yeah!!

The relationship between mother and daughter was pretty incredible as well. The protective instincts that they developed for each other is exactly what I want with my mom some day. Were we ever best friends, no. But we know, no matter what, that we will be there for each other. And really, family is the most important thing. It is a lasting and growing love.

And the witch. Hilarious and super cool that she wasn't trotted out as black and white evil. Which is another totally awesome thing about the movie. Even the evil guy wasn't that evil. He made mistakes. And they were costly. How great is a fairy tale that captures good choices and bad choices by people rather than just portraying good people and bad people?!?! Loved it! :)",1352937600,2,1766,4.458204334365325
1156349,4,7799133104,"Certainly there is no letdown on the Pixar quality when it comes to animation.  And they have broken a bit of tradition when it comes to animated fairy tales aimed at children with ""Brave.""  And that's a good thing.

Here we have a teen-age Merida (Kelly Macdonald), a Scottish princess who is more interested in archery than being married off by the King (Billy Connolly) and Queen (Emma Thompson).  When forced to choose between a trio of unworthy suitors, she rebels going deep into the forest where she meets a ""wise"" witch (Julie Walters).

In one of the funnier scenes, Merida agrees to buy all of the old woman's artwork - she has a small business of mostly wood carvings - in exchange for a spell to be used on her mother to change her mind.  Unfortunately, Merida doesn't read the small print, so-to-speak and the spell turns mom into a bear, but still with human characteristics; at least until the spell becomes permanent.  This is the tension of the film.  Can Merida fix things so Queen Mum can be her old self?

It is refreshing to see that the movie foregoes the traditional rescue by a handsome prince.  That film tradition coupled with a story line that eschews the tradition of the Kingdom is a nice turn.  While the film is well made and holds the audience attention, it lacks much of the humor that most of us grown-ups look for.  Recognizing this movie isn't aimed at me, it should be a worthwhile option for the youngsters.

I watched this film at home on a 63"" Plasma HDTV and I must say, I was stunned by the beauty of the transfer.  As stated earlier Pixar never disappoints and the technical wizardry carries over to the home system.  As you would expect the resolution is 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Every color is represented and the blacks are black.  Small details like freckles, beard stubble and wrinkles are clear and sharp.  Remarkably good picture.  If anything the audio is even better.  The package comes with a Dolby TruHD 7.1 surround and in a word, it's magnificient.

1156351,4,7799133104,"This movie is entertaining enough, but the truly impressive thing for me is how the artists at Pixar have advanced the techniques for animating and texturing clothing, hair, skin and hide, muscles and inner body structures, so they all move together in a natural way that is a wonder to behold. There is a great amount of skill and hard work that has gone into making this possible, even with the help of great computer-aided animation software. This movie can be an important landmark in the evolution of animated films. Pixar has been producing landmark movies every two years or so, and one can be glad that, after becoming part of Disney, they retain and continue to sharpen their artistic and technical edge.
Having seen now the movie twice, first in 3-D at a theater, and now on DVD in 2-D, my impression is that both versions are equally interesting and a pleasure to watch: those detailed backgrounds of leafy and mysterious forests and of the wonderful and craggy Highlands' landscapes are rendered with a poetic sensitivity that reminds me of Miyazaki's work.
When it comes to the tale being told with such a display of technical prowess, while I can't find anything seriously wrong with it, it has left me wishing they can get Brad Byrd (Incredibles, Ratatouille) back on the director's chair once again, and soon. I miss those charming, offbeat, uniquely inventive stories.
""Brave"", on the other hand, is a conventional fairy tale, with light and dark passages as it is traditional to have in such stories. I felt that the balance between light and dark was a bit off: too much slap-stick, perhaps. But that is a minor qualm, and most people who like animated movies will probably find this one is a good one to go and see, or buy.",1352851200,,1743,4.718032786885246

1156356,2,7799133104,"-SPOILER ALERT-

Pixar films used to be inventive, daring and adventurous:  A rat secretly operates as a chef in a five star French restaurant. An old man flies his house to the jungle with balloons.  A robot solely responsible for earth's cleanup blindly follows a newfound friend into space. Now there's excitement and originality.

Brave is a film about a king's daughter who is forced to marry against her will. She rebels by asking a witch to cast an evil spell on her mother, who then turns into a bear. If the spell isn't broken by the second sunrise, the mother stays a bear forever. Now doesn't that just scream Disney? Doesn't that sound like the premise for every other Disney movie you've ever seen? Of course it does. Brother Bear, for one, comes to mind.

Brave's animation is flawless and spectacular. But that should come with every Pixar film, like a toy comes with a Happy Meal. Kudo's to Pixar for introducing a female protagonist. Merida really is lovely, she possesses a terrific voice (Kelly Macdonald) and her hair flows magnificently. The rest of the characters, unfortunately, are simply not interesting enough and are largely forgettable, especially Merida`s three younger brothers, who are used solely for comic relief and as a handy standby to keep the plot going.

The dialogue is riddled with trite and clichd family melodrama.  Merida and her mother's back and forth bickering bored me to tears. (Mother: ""You listen to me!"" Merida: ""This is so unfair! I'm not going to be like you!"" Mother: ""You're acting like a child!) And so it goes on ad infinitum. That is such lazy scriptwriting.  And what about the blue wisps? What are they? Where do they come from? They're an essential component to the story and yet, their origins are never explained.

Pixar's comedy is always on the cutting edge. A laugh very minute. Sadly there are very few genuine belly laughs present here. It's mostly slapstick fare, particularly during the comedic action sequences. Of course, the story's ending is utterly predictable, like most Disney films.  Merida puts on her brave face - excuse the pun - and saves her mother who becomes human again. Still, the ending is sweet, poignant and heartfelt.

Brave is by no means a bad film. But it won't be recognized as one of Pixar's best. In fact, a film such as ""How to train your Dragon"", a Dreamworks film, fares far better in comparison. For my money, Pixar should get Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Ratatouille) or Pete Docter  (Monster's Inc. and Up) back in the director's chair. I see Docter, who directed the first Monster's Inc. film is not even scheduled to direct the next Monster's Inc movie, Monsters University. What a shame.",1352851200,9,2693,4.817787418655097

My first impression of Brave was visual- the animation effects at times for the backgrounds had me wondering if actual footage was used and the eyes of the mother bear were the most human in the film.

And then the story began to unfold. This is undoubtedly a Disney take on the themes in Celtic folklore where a transformation into an animal as part of the spiritual journey, in this case, a she-bear. She-bears are known as symbols of motherhood as well as strength and wisdom, protectors of their young.
This is a coming of age story for young women and mothers. Young Merida wants to live her own life and not the one she believes her mother, Eleanor wants her to live. As both face the dilemma caused by Merida's desire, they find the deeper truth of their relationship.

This is a welcome change of pace in Disney's ""heroic"" films, where the heroism and bravery isn't about physical strength or ability, but of the emotional.

1156431,4,7799133104,"As I begin this review, I should confess I'm not a big Pixar fan. Although I do recognize the charm the films hold, I don't find them as entertaining as most people do. Much of that has to do with the animation style. The environments look great, but I find the human beings to resemble lifeless marionettes many times. The atmospheres of the movies are too ""cute"" for me as well. I'm not big on ""cute"" when it comes to animated movies.

All that being said, Disney and Pixar's ""Brave"" is as good as their films come. It has all the right elements of a classic fairy tale with a few twists thrown in to keep things modernized. There's a princess, a witch, and some kooky animals in a faraway land.

The only thing missing is a prince to save the day. Princess Merida (Kelly Macdonald) makes it very clear to her parents that she doesn't need a prince to fulfill her life's ambitions or save her. She wants to live life on her own terms free of the trappings and responsibilities of being royalty.

Merida stumbles upon a witch (Julie Walters) that gives her a spell to change the Queen's (Emma Thompson) mind about marrying one of three suitors from other clans. The spell does more than change her mother's mind; it physically transforms her into the most feared creature in the kingdom - a gargantuan bear. Merida frantically looks for a way to change the Queen back before her father (Billy Connolly) and fellow huntsmen track her down. They mistakenly believe her to be the bear that took the King's leg.

In usual fashion, there are lessons for everyone to learn in ""Brave."" One is children should be careful what they wish for and value their parents. The other is that parents should give children the freedom to choose their own paths in life. It wouldn't be a Disney or Pixar movie without some sort of words of wisdom.

""Brave"" is successful as a whole. I'm glad I gave it a chance after skipping it in theaters. The initial marketing campaign for the movie offered no real motivation for me to see it in theaters. I did get a bit frustrated during the climax with some of Merida's illogical decisions. The different settings in the film really do carry you away to a fantasy world and help put you into the middle of the story and action.

The movie looks and sounds phenomenal in its high-definition version. Merida's bright red hair magically stands out against the backdrops of dark green meadows and grey castle walls. All the sounds of waterfalls and roaring bears mixed with cultural musical numbers spring to life through an elegant 7.1 surround mix.

There's plenty of special bonus material to give consumers their money's worth. Director Mark Andrews, co-director Steve Purcell, story supervisor Brian Larsen, and Editor Nick Smith all provide commentary for the film. It also includes two shorts entitled ""The Legend of Mordu"" and ""La Luna."" ""The Legend of Mordu"" features the witch from ""Brave"" telling the story of the Demon Bear. We get eight ""behind-the-scenes"" featurettes, four extended scenes, an alternate opening, several art galleries, and plenty more.

Disney / Pixar's 5-Disc Combo Pack of ""Brave"" has everything admirers of the movie could want. You can choose whether you want to watch it in 3D or 2D. The different formats make it easy to view anywhere on any sort of device. If you're curious how the movie was created there's plenty of ""making of"" and ""behind-the-scenes"" material to educate you.

1156432,3,7799133104,"The fusion of animation between Disney and Pixar studios has resulted in some dynamite movies over the past few years. Many have become the classics of the future for children including movie series like CARS and TOY STORY. There hasn't been a single movie from the combined efforts of these two that has yielded a bad movie. This holds true for their latest release to DVD, BRAVE.

BRAVE takes place in an unnamed country that more than likely is Scotland pre-Christianity days. These Celtic warriors talk tough and battle against the likes of bears when not fighting one another (something alluded to as the film progresses). In this world is a young princess named Merida, a free spirited young woman who loves to roam the countryside with her bow and arrows, riding her horse and climbing mountains. But that's not the thing that a princess should be doing as her mother reminds her of over and over.

Her mother wants Merida to be a young lady of refinement, ready to take over the duties of a queen when the day comes. That day comes sooner than Merida would like when her mother and father inform her that the leaders of the other three clans are on their way bringing with them their first born sons, her eligible suitors. Ever the misunderstood teen in these sorts of films, Merida revolts against her parents and when a tournament is held to determine who will win her hand, it is Merida who wins the match and announces she is free to choose as she likes. This doesn't go well with the clans and arguing ensues.

Back at the castle Merida and her mother have words that result in Merida slicing a tapestry of her family her mother made and running off to the woods. In the woods she comes across a Stonehenge type area where she spies a sprites (blue lit fairies of a sort) that guide her to a house in the woods where a witch lives. Talking about her desire to determine her own fate, she makes a bargain with the witch to help find a way to change her mother.

Returning with a gift for her mother, a treat that contains the spell, her mother eats a portion of it only to become ill. Once in her room with Merida's help, her mother changes into a black bear. Not a good thing since Merida's father is known for being a bear killer. The two escape the castle and head back to find the witch's house in hopes of returning the queen back into herself.

In order for this to happen, Merida and her mother must mend the tear in their relationship that has come about. Not only must they do this figuratively they must do so literally as well with the tapestry. Along the way they begin to understand one another clearer than they did in the past. But if they don't take care of this problem soon, the queen might stay this way forever.

What we have here is a failure to communicate. Okay I had to say that. But the gist of the story lies in the inability between a teen and her parent to be able to come to a common ground. This, as well as several exposed bottoms on the warriors, makes the film more inclined to be one for teens as opposed to the younger crowd. That might not be easy since by that age they're past cartoons, computer animated or not.

The movie is entertaining with some great music in it. The animation as always is breath taking to behold and you'll wonder just as I did how they are able to capture such detail in some areas like Merida's hair. The story is one that might even help a few teens and their parents come to terms with one another and communicate better than before seeing the film.

My only problem was that this isn't the sort of film Disney was known for. In the past magic was on display in Disney films but was used as a plot device. The jaded apple, the pumpkin carriage and such. In this film the magic stems from Celtic symbols and revolves around magic. This might not mean much to some people but for me it gave the film a different feel than the normal Disney films I grew up with.

Still, the movie does offer a nice piece of entertainment. It tells the story of a young girl looking to find her way in life and how she achieves that. For me, it won't go down as a classic Disney tale and my guess is it won't be remembered as well as most, but it's still a good movie.",1352764800,,4226,4.312342569269521

Disneys Brave hits many points Disney has avoided for years.

It also highlights the problems facing many teens & mothers in a fantasy way. Great for any child or mom.

She is the first noble born Princess in Disney to wield a weapon. She is also the first to NOT have a love story. I love how they not only designed the character, but also how her personality and story comes alive.

Although not the BEST Disney movie I've seen, its pretty close. I felt it was both cute, funny, and heartwarming at times. The darkness our heroine faces is of her own doing, which is also different from most Disney movies.

1156436,5,7799133104,"First off, I should probably make note that Brave has received a lot of negative reviews with the consensus being that it's ""Not Pixar's best movie."" I would like to point out that just because it is not their best movie, that does not mean that it should necessarily receive a bad review. Pixar has had a long standing history of fine animated films, being their best is quite a challenge. Saying that this is a bad movie for not being their best is like saying Shakespeare's Coriolanus is bad because it is not Hamlet. Also, this is far from their worst movie (Looking at you Cars 2). Brave is simply a fairy tale, and I say that with the highest compliments. After all, what were Disney classics like Snow White or Cinderella, but fairy tales? Fairy tales are meant to be somewhat simple stories that entertain and impart a moral. In that regard I think Brave is a huge success. I'm not saying it is Pixar's best film (though I would personally rank it there). I'm saying it shouldn't be dismissed.

The plot follows a princess who is forced to... well, be rather princessy. She'd rather be an archer and could fight with the rest of them. Considering this is set in mythical Scotland, that's saying quite a bit. As her mother forces her into taking suitors, she goes to a witch in order to change her mother so that she may have her freedom. This backfires to say the least. For more than that I suggest you see the movie. The only other thing I will say is that for those who say that the bear sequences came out of nowhere, they were foreshadowed throughout the beginning. Watch it again.

Enough about plot, on to technical aspects. Visually the film is stunning. The animation is grand, and Merida's hair looks amazingly real. I was honestly distracted from the plot a few times on my first view  just because I wanted to focus on the animation. Some scenes are simply breathtaking. The Blu-ray completely does honor to the visual look of the film and the 3D disc is some of the best 3D I've ever seen. While I am not a huge fan of 3D films personally, it adds a lot to the atmosphere of the old castles and the fog at night.

There are enough special features to keep both kids and adults entertained, from Pixar's classic short films related to the movie to a very in depth commentary that animation fans will find very interesting.

All in all, I have to give Brave as a movie a 4.5 by my own personal rating system. The film was an enjoyable fairy tale with a fun story and beautiful animation. The Blu-ray presentation is easily a 5 out of 5 and outclasses visually any other animated disk I've ever seen both in terms of 3D and standard presentation. Brave is easily one of the must own films this year.",1352764800,6,2717,4.426

Well, my three year old is super brave so I do agree that a lot of sensitive littles may have an issue with the movie, but it's not really an issue in our household. Nudity? Well, that's kind of laughable as it's an animated movie. I guess some people would rather hear fart humor and characters calling each other jackass (""Shrek""), and if that's you then skip this one, but it's really just two quick scenes and not in a scandalous way. And about that lack of romance... one of the reasons I love this movie for my daughter is the lack of romance for the main character. In fact, the whole plot is about teenager Merida trying to change her ""fate"" which is to get married before she's ready. She passionately pleads during one speech to the parents of her suitors to let their children decide when they are ready for marriage and to choose their own spouses. This is beyond refreshing after decades of Disney princess schlock where the all too young princess gets into a scrape and must be rescued by a man and then lives ""happily ever after"". Also, I found the romantic sparks between Merida's parents to be pretty sweet.

If you're raising an independent daughter you want to think for herself and not think girls are meant to be saved by boyfriends, don't skip this movie. (If she's sensitive and scares easily, wait until she's at least school age, though.)",1351382400,"1,009",1485,4.5

Oh yes, there is as always some kind of villain creeping around, in this case a bear.

Also there is some nudity and a young boy that looks like a small bear diving down the front of a woman's dress - great kid fare, right?

She has the attention span of a nat and she sat through the entire movie without fidgeting.  There was a bit of adult humor in the movie, but it was really funny and after all the movie is PG.  My daughter went around after seeing the movie telling people that ""the momma bear ate fishys"" and she always wants the Brave toys that she sees in Walmart.  I think that between Brave and Tangled Disney has officially recover from making that horrible Princess and the Frog movie.",1350604800,2,722,4.272058823529412
1156605,2,7799133104,"I read a few of the 1 star reviews and to a point I can understand their frustration and where they might be coming from. I was going to do a 1 star but in all fairness to the people that enjoyed this movie I can understand this too.  This movie may be up your alley if you're a mother daughter duo.

The movie deals with the main character being a female in a time where women were only suited for one type of role.  Since she was a princess her role was to find a suitor and help him rule as the successor to her father's kingdom.  The only problem is she doesn't want to be any part of an arranged marriage or to even play the role of a princess.  She would rather be out on a horse with her bow and arrows playing with the boys.  The movie begins showing her off her archery skills which are amazing, and goes on to show you the conflict that arise because of the differences between her and her mothers expectations on life and sacrifices(this movie definitely has a mother daughter type theme to it).  In order to escape the role of having suitors visiting her and being the successor of her parents kingdom she seeks out the help of a witch.  How she comes about finding the witch is somewhat interesting but the movie doesn't really go into much detail about it. Ultimately the wish that she makes in order to get herself out of her situation has a huge consequence on her mother and the rest of the movie deals with this issue.

I was really disappointed with the writing in this movie.  The mother and daughter had some depth but the overall plot was weak.  You have a character with the ability to play with the big boys yet you don't really take that concept anywhere. She can also see things other people can't (the sprites or spirit things that lead her to the witch) but there is no real depth to that part of the story either. The entire mom changing into a bear didn't work for me.  A bear transformation movie that did was ""Brother Bear"".  Something else that I noticed while I was in the theater watching this with my niece was other kids weren't really giggling over any of the ""funny"" parts of the movie.  That's because there wasn't a whole lot of laugh out loud parts in my opinion. I feel if you are comparing it to previous children's movies you can always find a comedic character to appreciate.  ""Brave"" tried to with the three little brothers but over all it was nothing special.  The evil bear at the end and his reason for being where he was and looking how he looked was actually pretty dark.  My niece got scared when he was introduced, and I know she didn't understand the concept of how his selfishness and greed had lead him to do what he did to his family and countrymen.  There is an overall moral to this story that everyone could share.  It was meant more in relation to a mother and daughter in the movie.  Even though my niece was scared towards the end she still liked the movie and so did her mom.

I have a feeling most men are not going to write a review for this movie so I feel I should.  I am a 31 year male  (just got out of the Corps in May) with no kids.  I enjoy going to movies with my niece.  I love kids movies, animated films (except ""Dumbo"" because I balled my little eyes out as a kid and refuse to watch it again), and Pixar.  I honestly could not relate to any of the characters in this movie nor did really feel a sense of connection to the issues being talked about with the characters.  I know that this was my biggest problem in watching ""Brave"". Movies I enjoyed because of a connection with a character would be ""The sword in the Stone"", ""Aladdin"", ""Lion King"", ""Shrek"", ""The Emperor's New Groove"", ""Tangled"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""The Princess and The Frog"", ""Wall-e"", and ""Finding Nemo"".  I could name a ton more, but that would take awhile.  Some of the movies I named also had catchy tunes to their story which made them all the more enjoyable.  I know the writers are trying a new approach to their storytelling with this movie. I just feel they could have done more, and I hope the next female adventure that they make, they do!",1350604800,45,4101,4.274611398963731
1156606,4,7799133104,"What if you'd been told your whole life that you were destined for something you didn't want? Worse yet, something you hated with almost every fiber of your being. How far would you go to change it?

  King Fergus and Queen Elinor (voiced by Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson, respectively) have four children. Their triplet sons Hubert, Harris, and Hamish, and there oldest, a daughter, named Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald). Before her brothers were born Merida (Macdonald) bore witness as a bear attacked her family and took her father's leg. Subsequent to the attack, Merida, much to her mother's dismay, has grown into a free spirit who rejects her mother's influence. This doesn't stop her mother from offering tips as to how a princess must behave on a near constant basis, however. And when Merida hears the ancient tale of a prince who broke off from his duty and caused his kingdom's downfall, she rejects it without a thought. So, even with her daughter's objections, the Queen holds a contest for the first-born sons of nearby allied clans. The winner will receive her daughter's hand. As the first-born of her clan, Merida competes and wins, causing a rift that is exacerbated when Merida destroys a tapestry and the Queen retaliates by throwing Merida's bow in the fire. Merida flees to the forest in anger and follows a will o' the wisp to a cabin. The old woman inside first insists that she is a wood carver but changes her tune once Merida offers a family amulet in trade for the witch's services. The witch gives Merida a cake and tells her that it will change her mother, leaving out a few minor details as to the nature of that change and telling her only that the spell becomes permanent after the second sunrise.

  Kelly Macdonald is tragically underrated as an actress. I first saw her in Two Family House, an independent film released in 2000 and then in the 2005 BBC film The Girl in the Caf. She had some recent success thanks to Boardwalk Empire, but nowhere near what she deserves, in my opinion. She does a great job as Merida, and I feel similarly about the job Connolly does voicing King Fergus. Thompson does well, but the role doesn't have anywhere near the same number of lines, for obvious reasons. The story is highly entertaining, as is the music. I will say that the ultimate consequence of the main character's actions leave a little something to be desired. Still, a great time.",1350518400,2,2422,4.687058823529412

From the trailers, it appeared to be about Merida and possibly other clan members, on the hunt to slay an evil beast and save their people.  The movie started out great, with the competition, a lot of laughs, introducing the characters, and an all around great time.  Still, I was waiting for those glorious bow and arrow scenes that the trailers and posters had constantly teased.  I was waiting for Merida to ride around on her horse and go into battle.  Essentially, due to the trailers, I was expecting a Mulan sort of movie.

When we get to the part of the movie where Merida meets the witch and things start ramping up, I was thinking, ""oh great this is going to get really fun.""  Still, I saw no sign of that happening.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the mother and daughter scenes and thought they were touching.  Once the mother was a bear, it was endearing, cute, and playful to watch the bear and Merida together.

Then, suddenly the movie seemed to end, and still there was no battle, no rush of adrenaline on the scale that I had expected, and nothing to make me cheer out loud for the protagonists.  Basically, I didn't have the fun rush of previous Pixar movies that I had come to expect.  Having said that, I still give the movie 4 out of 5 stars, because it looked gorgeous, the voice acting was top notch, and the story did touch my heart.

To sum it all up, if you watch Brave for combat, whether it's single person or on a grander scale, it won't live up to what you are expecting.  However if you go into it with the mindset that it's going to be a princess fairy tale and a bonding movie, you will relate to it and love it.

1156882,5,7799133104,"Brave the latest animated feature from Disney and Pixar, adds to the pantheon of Disney princesses in the form of a head strong, strong willed highland lassie named Merida, who has a big problem that is soon compounded by a bigger problem.

Merida, who is all red hair and sharp mouth, is a royal princess whose parents want her to marry one of the sons of various highland clan leaders. The problem is that she would rather not. Instead she would rather gallop about on her huge horse shooting arrows at everything in sight.

Her father, the King of Scotland, is indulgent while her mother, the Queen, is anxious that her little girl become a proper princess and learn how to submit to her duty. Merida, instead, makes an unwise bargain with a witch and then has a bigger problem on her hands concerning her mother.

The animation, which shows an idealized Scottish highlands, is gorgeous enough to be breathtaking. The music, as is proper, is very generous with the bagpipes and often soars along with the landscape; if ""Touch the Sky"" does not win an Oscar for best song in a feature length film, there is no justice in the world and no taste in Hollywood.

It is the fate of a lot of mothers and daughters to tussle when the later passes puberty. The story of ""Brave"" relates how Merida and her mother wage this battle and how they work through their issues while dealing with a potentially dangerous enchantment. There is also lessons about responsibility, getting what one wishes for, and listening once in a while to one's irritating teenagers.

The voice talent is exemplary and actual Scottish actors are well represented, including Billy Connolly as King Fergus, Craig Ferguson, Kevin McKidd, and Robbie Coltrane as the lairds whose sons are vying for the hand of Merida, and Kelly McDonald as Merida herself.

There are some scary, dark parts in the film, so parents should be cautious about bringing younger or more sensitive children to see it. But aside from that ""Brave"" is a true family film which everyone can enjoy.",1344816000,13,2033,4.728813559322034
1156883,5,7799133104,"After the ""Cars 2"" half-fiasco I feared the worse for ""Brave"" - but I was VERY pleasantly surprised! This is again Pixar as we love it - a film with a good scenario, excellent dialogues, wit and humour galore, likeable heroes, stunningly good music and breathtaking perfection of animation!

After reading the first reviews by so-caled ""professional"" reviewers in newspapers, I was a little bit concerned that it would be a kind of feminist, radically rebellious politically correct thing, but my apprehension was completely unfounded.

The one thing that can be called ""feminist"" about this film is that during the final fight the main villain defeats easily all the men before being bested by - well, not a man and not a male... This ""feminist"" thing is however somehow weakened by the fact that no man could ever boast being eight feet tall and weighing around 800 pounds, most of which muscles... To fully understand this point you will have however to watch the film to the end...

Far from being a manifesto of rebellion or feminism, ""Brave"" is in fact the story of a very traditional loving and caring family, confronted to the universal challenge of perfectly natural adolescent rebellion against the parents and established authorities - but it is also the story which once again shows that true love conquers all and that there is no ""good guys"" and ""villains"" in this eternal and omnipresent clash of wills. In fact (with the sad exception of deeply pathological families) in this time of life both parents and teenagers are a little bit wrong and a little bit right. ""Brave"" shows that the key to the satisfying solution in this particular stage of family life is first to avoid the escalation of the conflict beyond reasonable boundaries... which is something Princess Merida, the main hero in ""Brave"" will learn in the hardest possible way... Because the great idea of the scenarists of this film was to make the rebellious teenager the main culprit for all things that go wrong somewhere in the middle of the story...

In fact one could call this film very conservative in its message, because it says to the young ones: ""Do not go too far in your rebellion, because not only you will be very sorry for it, but it is even possible that the damage can not be entirely repaired""... The parents on another hand also get a warning: ""Cut your growing children at least some slack, because if you push them too hard, they will break under pressure - and the damage can be beyond any possibility of repairing"". And for both sides the message is: ""Family is archi-precious - therefore, even if you fight, stay always conscious that some holds are barred - and know that small concessions can avoid HUGE disasters"". And finally there is a very discreet but strong warning against the deadliest sin in Christian teachings, Devil's great all time favorite, the greatest destroyer of men and women - pride!

This powerful message is served to us in a very skillful, absolutely not preaching way, by being wrapped in an excellent story (some limited SPOILERS ahead). Let it be known then that ""Brave"" occurs in Medieval Scotland. The civilization of the Kingdom in which everything happens seems to be roughly that of 800 AD, as the technology seems to come from last moments of Iron Age and also the Vinkings are mentioned, but some elements are missing (there is not Christian symbols or priests) and there is one strong anachronism (a mention of fights with Romans). But all of this is not really so important for the story and if this kind of things offend you, it is advised to simply consider the Kingdom from ""Brave"" to be a Far Far Away Land from Times Long Since Passed...

The Kingdom is ruled by the mighty King Fergus, who was gifted with the volume, build and all the beauty of a Panzer division which saw a lot of action, but who is overwise a very endearing fellow, with a heart as large as his chest. He sincerely loves his wife, his children, his kinsmen and his country and he is a fair and merry ruler, who enjoys without limits the good things of life: good food, strong liquor, loud songs, cheerful dances (with a lot of axe throwing), long difficult hunts and last but not least friendly brutal savage bloody fist/teeth/club/stool/table/mug/bottle/mutton leg/tree trunk/etc. fights, possibly with no less than one hundred participants...)))

His wife, Queen Elinor, is a very beautiful, very intelligent and very brave woman, a loving mother of four children, a competent manager of the castle and other estates and also a very respected power figure, restless in her work to assist her husband in his royal duties. She seems to love a lot her oversized, loud and ugly as deadly sin husband (it is however hinted that she initially was not at all happy about her parents choice of future husband - for her, marriage came before love) even if he exasperates her frequently, as she is a sophisticated and learned lady, whereas he would not recognize sophistication even if it sat on his nose and started to dance the strathpeys. Last but not least, Queen Elinor has an iron will - once she wants someting, she will get it, come hell, high water or both!

The first born of the royal couple is a very beautiful redhead, Merida. Since her earliest childhood she was a tomboy, happiest when riding the horse, shooting the bow, climbing cliffs, eating fish she captured in mountain streams and drinking with her bare hands cold water from forbidden springs. Merida grows to be a fair young maiden, but she is unable to live up to her mother's expectations. She simply was not meant to be a lady - she is much more like her loud, naturaly happy, extravertic, simple pleasures loving father. She however shares one trait with her formidable Mum - she is completely, totally, irrevocably pigheaded!

The dramatis personae would not be complete without Merida's three baby brothers, Harris, Hubert and Hamish. They are natural triplets and they seem to be around 5 years old. Now, if the marriage of King Fergus and Queen Elinor seems to be a match made in heaven, those last three offsprings it produced were certainly conceived in part with Hell's help, because they are the most annoyingly mischievous and destructive little imps ever seen on the screen! They almost never speak but let their acts speak for themselves and they are heard really loud and clear by everybody in the castle and around! The dirty tricks they play to almost everybody (including the King - but NEVER the Queen!) can be really nasty... They also strongly believe in the principle ""No dessert left behind"" and they are so adept at stealing and pilfering sweeties, that it can be assumed that everybody else in the castle suffers from serious sugar deficiency...

As you probably already saw in the trailers, the bears play an important role in this film and there is especially one, a really impressive and scary creature called Mor'du, which is crucially important for the whole plot. But there will be no more said here, to avoid spoilers. One WARNING however about Mor'du - this is a REALLY scary creature, and there are moments in which the skillful use of fog, shade and darkness (and of a chillingly creepy music) gives the viewers a good fright for their money! Therefore I would really AVOID showing this film to the youngest children, especially under the age of seven. This is a serious warning, as Mor'du is a really, REALLY frightening sight!

There is (of course) also a witch in this film. I found her a very delightful presence, not scary at all - in fact, the witch is one of the strongest and best comic moments in the film. Do NOT miss the last joke, after the final credits - wait patiently (they are very long), and you will be rewarded with a very nice punch line!

It is a good thing that Scots are people with lot of sense of humour, because in this film they are portrayed with a great love - but also with lots of jokes which take no prisoners! This film also DEFINITELY settles the eternal dispute about what it is that Scots really wear under their kilts!

The ending is very clever and very touching - and it shows also very nicely how sexy can be a single white streak in the otherwise raven-wing black chevelure...

Finally, there are sound aspects. Scottish accent heard in this film is a real delight! Songs are very good and as of the music, it is a TREASURE! Wonderful bagpipes, carrying us to infinity - and beyond!

CONCLUSION: Pixar is back, with all its men, horses, artillery and train (and bagpipers!). This is an excellent kidult (kid/adult) film, to see, see again, buy on DVD, view regularly in family and keep for your grandchildren!

1156887,3,7799133104,"I like Pixar films. I like those lovely and likable characters this animation studio continues to create - Woody and Buzz, Sulley and Mike, Lightning McQueen and Remy the gourmet mouse chef. I also like Merida, the heroine of Pixar's new film ""Brave."" (She is the first female protagonist of the company's films.) And I tried to like the film itself, which is certainly entertaining, but fails to offer a story that this brave and independent heroine really needs. In short, Merida deserves a better story.

The story begins promisingly. Merida is a princess of a Scottish clan, with formidable skills with a bow and arrow. Being dissatisfied with a marriage arranged by her parents, she obtains a magic spell from a witch living in the woods so that she can thwart the marriage plan. As you expect, Merida's conduct results in a terrible disaster that she must somehow fix on her own.

The best part of the film is its visuals, especially those of Merida and her hair. Voice acting is also wonderful. Kelly Macdonald captures the spirit of strong-mined Princess Merida. Another good point is that the film sometimes seems having fun with genre conventions.. Witches are often depicted in a negative light, but in ""Brave"" the Witch (voice by Julie Walters) may be strange, but definitely not evil.

But the weak storyline needs improvement. That Merida looks often selfish didn't bother me. We know she will change, and she actually does, but the point is how she changes. ""Brave"" does not give the heroine a real challenge. A big bad bear is not good enough. A considerable portion of the film's second half is spent on silly slapstick involving her young brothers. Curiously Merida, a skilled archer, is not given enough chance to show what she can do.

""Brave"" is better than last years' disappointment ""Cars 2,"" but the film, despite its interesting heroine, is still a letdown.",1344211200,112,1882,4.853582554517134
1156888,2,7799133104,"Forcing a young woman into marriage when she is not ready does not make her happy and is generally agreed upon, outside a few uber-religious communities, as not the right thing to do.  The latest Disney heroine to take on the concept is Merida, protagonist of ""Brave,"" a rebellious redhead with a prowess in archery as a result of a gift bestowed upon her by a boisterous but loving father.  This is much to the dismay of her mother who wishes her to take on what many today regard as an antiquated feminine role of passivity and elegance.  The process with which she must choose her husband involves a competition among her suitors in an activity of her choice, which turns out to be--you guessed it--archery.  Needless to say, Merida, in a toast to girl power, shows up her three mediocre, socially-inept suitors with her own archery skills and proceeds to address her overall marital issue through a spell that changes the one forcing the marriage issue, her mother, into a bear.  This provides for some intense moments as Merida is forced to defend and care for her mother in light of her father who is determined to avenge a lost limb by killing the bear.

The problems with this story are twofold:  First, fighting forced marriage is bit like fighting the Holy Roman Empire.  It is a noble fight but the enemy really doesn't exist anymore, outside a few cloistered segments of society, with whom most of the audience probably doesn't associate anyways.  Plus, Jasmine and Mulan already fought that battle, succeeded, and had presumably brought even the most obstinate detractors onboard.  Second, it is unclear exactly how showing up her suitors or turning her mother into a bear helped to win her case.  She proved that she had better aim than her suitors, but so what?  Many a successful husband has been landed without the foggiest notion on how to operate a bow-and-arrow.  Then, the bear bit showed that she could take care of her mother in spite of an army of adversaries led by none other than her father.  But again, so what?  If the mother's motivation for a forced marriage was the security of the kingdom, would such an antic really eliminate that notion?

The final product feels like a rush job, where several individuals of varying interests were summoned to assemble a product to meet various business objectives, with the story secondary.  The product should be the first Pixar to feature a female lead to tap into the young, soccer-playing girls who find it gratifying to show up their male counterparts.  Check.  It should have some fights so that the young male audience doesn't perceive it as a ""girl's movie"" and avoid it.  Check.  It should showcase Pixar's animation to be a cut above anything produced elsewhere.  Check.  It should include some magic or witchcraft so that it does not come across as an animated version of a Jane Austen novel.  Check.

In spite of its splendid animation, the movie ultimately fails not because of its female protagonist or its magic.  It fails because of a flawed story concerning an overused adversary.",1344124800,27,3067,4.772296015180266
1156889,5,7799133104,"I went into this movie not knowing at all what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised with a visual extravaganza of brilliant color and painstakingly detailed beauty. This movie makes the natural environment come alive on screen. The animation is second to none. The story itself is wonderful, about a daughters quest for independence and the struggle in a mother/daughter relationship that is timeless. My daughter is 10 and absolutely loved the film. As a Dad, I loved seeing her breath in and be captured by the story. The heroine is young and strong and sends a good message for women today. There is plenty of humor to amuse both the young and old. I also do not think it is any more frightening than the Disney classics of old like Snow White or Cinderella that had their share of villainous scenes.

I hate it when the antagonist of the movie becomes more of an idea than an actual person or creature.

1156972,5,7799133104,"No spoiler here only praise
Pixar does movies in a special way.  No matter what visually technical movie they want to make they hold the animators at bay until the story is just right.  It is why we followed a fish on a journey to find his son, felt for a robot as it discovered love, and had our hearts strung by a cowboy toy who feels tossed aside like yesterday's news.  I have no idea why I ever doubted that Brave would work as well as past Pixar hits, but I admit I expected it to be nothing more than a money grab movie.  One might come to the thought that this movie was only so Disney could have a red headed princess from Scotland to market to little girls.  I walked into the movie thinking that very thing and was knocked out by how much I enjoyed it.  Regardless of the whether or not this movie was green lighted to fit a toy market, the Pixar touch gave it such strength both visually and emotionally I tossed away my prejudious I had on such thoughts.

Although there is humor of easy steriotypes in the movie that makes me feel that Disney had a finger or two in the pie the pace of the movie screamed Pixar.  There never seemed to be a conflict in the movie that was thrown in to only shock and grab your attention.  Every scene was purposeful, and seemlessly flowed into the next.  The artwork was beautiful, and I was pulling for the characters through the movie.  The relationships between the mother and daughter was realistic, yet also shows young girls how to be independent yet respectful.  Too often movies and shows have children who start off snotty rebels, and by the end are still snotty heroes.  It's nice to see a movie where they still show a girl who is independent, yet any snotty actions show real consequence.  By the end you can see the real developement of the hero, and want to root for her.  As a parent I loved how the story was enjoyed by the whole family and my girls left the theatre with a real role model to pretend to be.  The music was beautiful, and celic style made up for any overtly commercial sounding pop theme.  It's not going to be Toy Story, but I felt this movie was well worth the ticket price, and will be added movie to the collection.",1343779200,3,2197,4.268115942028985
1156973,4,7799133104,"Since seeing the trailer a few months ago I've wanted to see Brave.  In fact, I wanted to see it before The Dark Knight and I am glad I did!

There are other plot synopses around the `net, so these are just some of my impressions.  -Brave stars Merida, a royal tomboy who wants nothing more than to shoot her arrows and have a great time.  Her mother, the queen, wants her daughter to be proper and married, so as to carry on tradition.

The mother/daughter dynamic is very strong in this tale.  Disney/Pixar break tradition a bit and have the princess as an independent girl in a land of tough Scottish brogue and Clan jealousies and pride.  Merida is proud too.  Perhaps too proud.  Her mother is proud as well and demands her girl to be traditional.

The tension grows as Merida becomes a fierce teenager, not realizing she's also coming of age.  To change her mother, she follows the willow wisps and meets a woodcarver (actually a witch!) and does the whole spell/magic thing that only Disney can do.

The film is darker than other Pixar films and has more of a Disney feel than did Cars or Up or Wall-E, all excellent films in their own right.

Not to reveal too much, but Merida's mother has a major change in view which most of the movie revolves around.  The humor is pretty good, especially amongst the clans - the young men who vie for Merida's hand are less than amazing and she out-shoots them all in an archery contest.  Very funny.

Animation:

The animation has improved greatly from earlier Pixar.  The fiery red hair of the leading lady almost has a mind of its own.  The fierce bear fights, the frightened horse Angus and the Stonehenge-like Celtic legends and magic create an awesome tapestry.

Bottom Line:

Though tedious in length, the mother/daughter tensions, the magical elements and the message of making your own Fate, that destiny is inside you, was inspiring, funny and though missing adult-themed messages (as in Up or Wall-E) was fun to watch.  Mothers should bring their daughters (and vice versa) to see this film.

Recommended.

1156974,5,7799133104,"Last year, Disney- Pixar created Cars 2, the first critical disappointment film and box office disappointment that was saved by merchandise sales that everyone agreed it was the worst film even it didn't look like Pixar that this year's Brave tries to bring Pixar back to basics with a story of a princess that seeks out her destiny until she comes a witch that changes things for her and her family that now she's got to save her mother before it's too late and figuring herself out. Not Pixar's best or worst film but it's a start that's what I said on opening weekend when me and friend went to see it, it was good and another female character this year that doesn't need men saving her that she can take care of herself just like Katniss from The Hunger Games!

1156976,5,7799133104,"On a spur of the moment decision, we took the kids to see Brave.  I have to admit that I was probably more excited to see this film than some of the kids (my oldest son almost backed out to stay home and do chores instead...what a choice, huh?).  The trailer had me a little nervous as it didn't ""feel"" the same as some of the other Pixar movies I've loved.  It almost had a ""Dreamworks"" studio feel...which isn't a bad thing since I've enjoyed some Dreamworks movies, but I was worried that it wouldn't be all that I hoped for and expected.  So, even though the trailer didn't put forth a whole lot in terms of the overall plot, I went into this film with pretty high expectations just because it's from Pixar.

And hands down, my expectations were met.  If anybody else loves Pixar and was worried (as I was) that this film was a departure from their usual magic, put those fears aside.  This movie is great.

Before talking about the movie, I want to comment on the ""short"" before the film.  As with all Pixar movies (and more and more on other animated films as well), they had a short cartoon.  This one was called ""La Luna.""  It starts with a young boy sitting in the middle of the water with two older men.  There are no words but a lot of mumbled grunts and other unspoken language.  As the title suggests, the short involves the Moon.  Through most of the short it felt like we were balancing between a lovely piece of artwork and silly humor that tried to stop just short of the slapstick humor of cartoon.  But then, in the final moments of the short there is a great image that pulls everything together in a surprising way that is absolutely fantastic and makes the whole thing very endearing and special.  This one is a sweet and fun showcase of talent.

Similar to the surprising twist in the short, there was a surprise for me in the movie itself.  From the trailer, it looked like the plot would be about an outspoken girl who doesn't want to get married because she has too much fun being a warrior boy.  She's at odds with her parents (mostly her mother) and sets out in search of a way to change things.  That's where the trailer left it....and it left me thinking this might be a Mulan-esque story where she goes off on some sort of adventure (again making me nervous that maybe we'd just have a rehashed story).

The trailer is a bit sneaky.  I haven't looked to see if they've released a new, more revealing trailer but I can tell you that the original trailers were somewhat misleading in terms of the overall plot and story arc of this movie.  With a couple of brief, disjointed exceptions, I think all of the scenes from the trailer come only from the first half (or less) of the movie.  About one-third or one-half of the way through the movie there is a big twisty plot element that makes this movie very different from what I expected.  I won't spoil it for you since the surprise is a lot of fun and it makes for a very compelling second half of the movie.  I don't think the movie would be any less enjoyable if you know what's going to happen, but the thrill of the reveal is a lot of fun, so I'll leave you to it.

The story is not 100% fresh and unique.  In fact it borrows themes and elements from other stories.  But it is told in a fresh, humorous and compelling way.  The writing and directing is fabulous and keeps the pacing and fun.  It was filled with great banter as well as some awesome non-verbal communication.  Merida's little brothers never really speak...and yet they are super evocative and funny.  Other characters later in the movie also have super non-verbal communication.

Near the very end of the movie the staging of the scene was powerful enough that I looked next to me as Lynette gasped in fear and whispered ""oh no"" and looked like she might cry.  Even knowing this was a children's film, there was enough tension and emotion invoked that she was worried things might all fall apart.

The artwork is superb as is expected from Pixar.  Some of the scenery and landscape shots were absolutely stunning and looked almost photo-realistic.  There was a scene where Merida and her mother were walking through the forest and at quick glance it looked almost like a live-action movie rather than a cartoon.  Still, the colors and palette were vibrant and cartoony enough to maintain the animation aspect, but I was very impressed with the art.  The grass.  The water.  The hair.  The cloth.  Great work.

The music was also great.  The score is wonderfully engrossing and a lot of fun.  They presented a wonderfully Celtic vibe and had some great vocal selections as well (all background...there aren't any musical numbers in the movie).

Over the years I have absolutely loved the Pixar films.  I've been a big Disney fan since I was a little kid and enjoy those movies but I have to admit that some of the Disney animated films of the past decade(s) have lost some of their charm and magic.  Amid the slight slump from Disney, I feel like Pixar has picked up the slack.  There are certainly Pixar films I like more than others and I haven't seen all of them (the only full-length film I haven't seen is Ratatouille) but I really like all of their work and totally love many of them.

As I mentioned I was initially nervous that this film might be a departure from the Pixar magic that I know and love.  My fears were unfounded and Brave was as fabulous an experience as I have come to expect and enjoy from Pixar.  There are a couple of scenes that might be a little intense for very young viewers...and there was a scene where you see bare male bottoms (as my wife pointed out to the kids, it shows verisimilitude in the fact that there often wasn't anything worn beneath the kilts...not that it was necessary to put it into the movie, but it was some generally tasteful comic relief).

Overall I really had a ton of fun with this movie and look forward to seeing it again.  All of the family really enjoyed it (even my oldest who initially didn't plan on coming).  If you're on the fence but have enjoyed Pixar in the past, I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed.  If you're not a fan of cartoons and kids movies, this one might just straddle the fence enough between childish and grown up to help you have fun.

The story was good, but it seemed to be a story that's been done before. Kind of like Brother Bear, except with a mother-daughter relationship instead of a pair of brothers.

The characters in this movie, were, to me, pretty unlovable. Merida herself I found to be very immature at times. I know this is a coming of age story, but she seemed to just be extraordinarly whiny at times. I did enjoy her brother's antics, they were probably the high point of the movie for me.

The music was good, though not very memorable.

1157064,5,7799133104,"Walt Disney's new Pixar animation film ""Brave"" has a lot going for it: astonishingly life-like animation, a plucky heroine, an enchanting setting in the Scottish Highlands, and a fast-moving and engaging story equal parts comedy, drama, and supernatural coming-of-age tale. Parts of the movie are violent and/or extremely intense; this movie may be frightening to really young children.

Merida is a princess, the eldest child of King Fergus, ruler of an ancient kingdom set somewhere in the Highlands of ancient Scotland. The introduction shows her to be an independent tom-boy with wonderful red hair, a love for the outdoors and archery, and the angst and stubborn streak of a typical teenager. A precursor sequence tells of a dramatic family encounter with a vicious bear that lays the groundwork for key parts of the rest of the plot.

As the story proper gets underway, we learn the time has come for her to be betrothed to the eldest son of one of the clans of the kingdom, a crucial event of state for which Merida's mother, the dutiful Queen Elinor, has been attempting to prepare her for years. Merida refuses to play out her role, subverting the betrothal process and fleeing into the forests. There, she has an encounter with a witch, who offers her a magical way out of her responsibilities as a princess. This escape comes with unfortunate and even terrifying consequences for Merida's mother and for the Kingdom that Merida will only slowly come to recognize. She will be forced to race the clock, attempting to apply her mother's lessons to putting things right.

""Brave"" has a nice mixture of action and comedy, even in its supernatural elements. The action builds to a dramatic and emotional climax at story's end, assisted by a score highlighting both gaelic and modern music. Its final message explicitly stresses Merida's right to find her own destiny while suggesting that she must also take responsibility for the consequences and for her obligations as a princess to the kingdom. ""Brave"" is highly recommended as excellent entertainment.",1342310400,,2061,5.02046783625731
1157065,5,7799133104,I saw Brave for the first time yesterday and was so deeply touched by the relationship between the mother and daughter.  The music is great - the accents are a wonderful new experience for the audience and the overall story is wonderful.  The main character Merida grows so much in her understanding of her mother and herself throughout the story.  And the mother-daughter relationship grows in depth as they move through the challenges they face.  Highly recommend this movie for children - especially girls - ages 8 and older.  Younger ones may need a little support with the scary scenes and there are a few which is why it is rated PG.  Fantastic production from digital animation that rocks to the voices for each character!  5 Star Rating for sure!! Can't wait to own my own copy!,1342310400,3,786,4.693430656934306
1157066,3,7799133104,"This movie gives kids the wrong idea about what being BRAVE really means. Merida, in my opinion, was the least ""brave"" of all Disney heroines. Sure, she did things the others would never do--climbed mountains to drink from waterfalls, rode through the forest shooting targets (awesome, awesome, by the way) but most of that was recklessness. When it came to real courage--doing what was right, and sacrificing herself to do so--Merida fell flat. Most of the time, she was selfish, impetuous, and angry. She had reason to be, at times, what with the arranged marriage and all, but..

Merida was a brat. The top reviewer mentioned that this is a great story for strong-willed and independent girls. Well, I am a strong and fiercely independent girl, and Merida and I had little in common. I, too, would object to an arranged marriage, and fight against it--do all in my power to prevent it--but I wouldn't do what she did. I love and respect my mother. I would never go find a magic potion and ""change"" her, like Merida did. She didn't know what it would do to her mother. It could be something horrible. But Merida didn't care. She didn't even hesitate. She only thought of herself. Then, when her mother changed into a bear, Merida wasn't overly concerned for her mother--just for herself, because of how much trouble she was in. And then she got her mother out of the castle, to prevent her father from killing the bear, not out of bravery, but rather.... necessity. Yeah, that's a good enough word for it.

Don't get me wrong. I loved the first 45 minutes or so of this movie. The animation was incredible, the acting was skillful, the action scenes were great, the dialogue was funny, the premise was good. I was cheering for Merida during the archery scene, when she beats all the suitors. However, after all that, I was sorely disappointed.

There was a lot of inappropriate content in this movie. And yeah, sure, most Disney movies have little things here and there--as I've discovered recently, after going back and watching favorite childhood Disney movies--but they're subtle, and young children won't even notice them. However, in this movie, it was anything but subtle. For example:

When Merida got her mother out of the castle after turning her into a bear, all of the men got trapped up on the castle ramparts. In order to get down, they took off their kilts and made a rope with them to climb down. So we got to see their naked posteriors from behind. Yippee. We REALLY didn't need to see that. And it didn't even make sense. They were all wearing cloaks, and shirts--so why not use those? It seemed that Disney was just going for the shock factor here--well, consider me shocked.

Another example: At one point, the three toddlers are trying to find this key. There's a female servant who spends the entire movie prancing around in this severely low-necked dress. And, oh-so-conveniently, the key falls down the front of her dress. What do the toddlers do? They dive in after it. Yep. Into her cleavage. For a key.

The top review for this movie mentions that it's silly to be complaining about nudity in an animated movie. Um, I'm sorry, but did you WATCH this movie?!

Obviously, PG doesn't mean what it used to. I'm not saying that this movie should be PG-13--simply that the nudity is completely unnecessary.

Then, at the end of the movie--after Merida has begrudgingly saved her mother--she's sitting on a horse alongside her mother, and says in the narration, something about destiny, and how ""you just have to be brave enough to see it."" And I remember thinking, ""AT WHAT POINT WERE YOU EVER BRAVE?""

I hope that Disney will finally make a better heroine someday; one with the kick-butt skills of Merida w/ swords & bows and arrows, as well as the bravery and selflessness of Belle and Mulan. Or even Jane from TARZAN, or Rapunzel from TANGLED, or Pocahontas. (In a word, a heroine like BUFFY.) And, hopefully, we'll eventually get the amazing music of those older movies too.....

I'm usually not this critical about Disney movies. But I had to be tough with BRAVE, because I just expected so much more.",1342224000,18,4128,4.704986149584488
1157067,5,7799133104,"This is the best Princess movie since The Little Mermaid!!! Some people like my mommma decided to judge it with Tangled which was good but this movie has action and adventure and everything that a child, princess lover, and adult would love.... No spoilers but the middle is a little scary and the close to the ending is sad and grown ups should watch this before children or watch with child! To me I was 100% into it. This was the first Disney Princess that does NOT get married which is great because it shows we can be ouselfves and have a happily ever after with out a husband...

1157069,2,7799133104,"Pixar's first tale to center on a female heroine introduces us to Merida, who is, ironically enough, an adventurous tomboy. She loathes her loving mother (the queen) for pushing her into the very feminine royal life laid out for her based on the traditions of her people. This resentment eventually boils over, and Merida rides off into the woods in an act of protest. During this glorified tantrum, she stumbles upon a mysterious group of stones and magical blue 'wisp' creatures. These beings lead Merida to the cabin of a bumbling witch with a penchant for spells. Merida strikes a deal with her to 'change her destiny' in exchange for a valuable necklace. Of course the new destiny is worse than her original one so Merida spends the rest of the movie trying to, as Bay-Staters know how to say all too well, 'reverse the curse!'

As usual for Pixar, the animation is nothing short of breathtaking. A young girl sitting behind me at the theater gasped ""So beautiful!"" when the film opened to a stunning shot of an animated Scottish coastal community. The way the animators craft the different settings for our characters in such vivid color and detail is almost worth the price of admission alone...almost.

Where the film falters is with both the overall pacing and with the development of an antagonist. The beginning of the movie seems to drag, especially for a fairy tale geared at young children. The first hour could have been told in half the time, and gets quite repetitive as it drives home the point that Merida is not happy with her life. She is like the child version of Elizabeth Gilbert from Eat, Pray, Love - both being whiny characters that have so much yet want something different. Once Brave does begin to move along plotwise, it becomes a disjointed tale in search of a villain. Is it the witch? The demon bear? The queen? Merida herself? Maybe all of them? The narrative doesn't take the time to establish any one evil to root against, which leaves older, more mature viewers a little impartial to the outcome.

For a story so lacking in a developed villain, it is surprisingly violent, taking advantage of every last bit of the 'PG' rating. From constant sword/fist/bear fights to one character getting crushed to death by a large stone, I was taken aback by how far Pixar took the intensity of this story. While other Pixar movies have had dramatic scenes, this one strikes me as the first I would say real young children would not enjoy seeing. I wish the film had leaned more on the humor, because when Brave tries to be funny, it succeeds brilliantly. There are a few comical sequences with devious little triplets that save the film from being a complete disaster.

All that criticism aside, this is a perfect movie for preteen/middle school girls who can handle cartoon violence and want an ultimately positive message. For the rest of us, Pixar's latest is simply a disappointing Scottish legend that borrows from better animated films of a similar vein (see the far superior&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>). It's not the worst way to spend your money at the multiplex, but it's certainly not worth rushing out to see if you aren't in the target demographic. In my movie-going opinion, I would give it a 5 out of 10.",1342224000,23,3365,4.919014084507042

1157164,1,7799133104,"Saw it two other families, total of 9 kids ages 2-10. We made an unfortunate mistake to choose the 3D screening.
The movie is violence-packed. Very scary to kids and parents alike. Parents beating themselves on the head
what they brought the kids to, kids struggle with each violent scary scene and trying to show the next
one that they can make it through. We had to delegate one parent who finally left the theather with three of
our youngest ones 2, 4.5 and 5 as they were watching in horror and had no intention to hide it.
At the end of the movie there were plenty of seats left - mind that the movie started with full theather.
I don't recall any quite as violent kids movie that would be rated PG in long while. The movie is much
underrated in my opinion for the violence, language and profanity.
As someone already staed, you can't provide any parental guidance in a theater. The movie happens
so fast and the kids get scared beyond belief.

I believed that the 3D version did more damage then non 3D, yet when cmpared notes with friends
who saw it in non-3D their hair was just as raised.

My personal recommendation - if you have children younger then 11 or so, do wait for the disc,
evaluate it BEFORE showing it to the little ones. The traile is not doing the justice.
The trailer makes you believe you are going to see a gentle fun movie with some elements of
adult humor. The reality is very different. The movie is violent and scary and dark for the most part.
Very, very loud.

I would especially like to make aware parents of kids with Censory integration issues,
Autism and all children who can't adequately express their fears and emotions as
this might be a damaging experience.

This movie makes the beast from The Beauty and the Beast looking like a Telletuby huggable furry creature,
and cmoparing Brave to Tangled - it is like a Omen to Barney.

I can't really quite figure out what audience the movie targeted but clearly not the kids, and hardly parents.",1341705600,33,1980,4.473684210526316
1157165,1,7799133104,"First of all - if you did see the trailer of this movie and think that you know what you are taking your kids to see,
think again!

It is obvious that the makers of the movie maticulously ommited ALL and ANY violent and super scary scenes that the movie
si INFESTED heavily with only to make you believe that it is an  innocent story of a little girl with some personality
who simply is trying to change her faith ... with some element of Viking-like raugh dialogues and some bit awkward
scenes as a man showing his bottom to others - as it was supposed to make little ones to laugh and parents of them feel
at best unconfortable with such an scene.

First the report from the audience - the showing we went to was packed to the brim and sold out. During the movie about 1/3 of the parents with small children left the screening with kids screaming murder and in pure horror inspired by violent and sudden scenes bestowed upon them by unexpecting parents who brought them for ""innoncent story"".
Whoever reminded  - the kids above 5, mostly boys and girls above 6 .. of whom you could see uneasiness on their faces and as parents all around us would check every now and then asking if they want to leave and if it is to scary, tried
to show they are ""BIG"" kids and can stay and watch this nonsense to the end as it was some sort of badge of bravery,
pushing themselves regualrly into the back of the seats on and on and on with every new violent scene and biting their fingers.

I would not expect in my wildest dreams that intensity of the bad scenes can be so big and so sudden. The makers of the movie clearly had an agenda to scare all the little ones sensless.

It does say PG - and if you think that since your little one previously saw and did not much of other PG movies then please rethink it with an option to leave the theather when you will see your little one not being able to handle it.
The problem with seeing this movie in the theather is that you can do NOTHING regarding PG-ing.. your little one,
PG stands for Parental Guidance.. and no, you can not provide Parental Guidence in the theather. You could successfully
foward the all bad and scary scenes should you watch it at home to shield your little one from the scare but then again
I would say that what is left is about 10 minutes of the material that is free of some sort of violence, obscenity and or nudity.

This movie is hardly worth watching for little kids as I don't find any value in it, no entertaining value, no intelligent story, no captivating characters that a child can unify with. Just dirty comedy, obscene scenes and the violence of the outmost magnitude for the rest part. Hardly a good kid's movie.

We are all used to the fact that Disney just CAN""T make a movie that won't try to push some eveil elements in it, for whatever reason - beats me... but this one is way pass the evil elements of your Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and the usual...
They are serious about scaring kids, and they want to do good job with it. However the parents are looking more and more often for gentle movies for their kids and programs like Elmo prove that one can make evil-free program and be successful, Disney does not quite give ""much thought"" to it.

So.. be prepared, you are sitting there with your little one.. minding your own business and not even three minutes into the movie a HUGE, bigger then life bear jumpes at you the full size of the screen, roaring thorugh all of the speakers in the theather and promptly depraving the father of the main character of his lower limb - as the kids watch, in shock and horror..

Okay you think.. Disney.. they had to do it,... and as your thought are racing through your mind and you trying to decide weather this was the most scary element, should you take your offspring and leave like score of parents evacuating at this point with their screeeeeeeeeeeeeeming kids, another though enters your mind.. neah.. my kid is a BIG kid, and that was probably the only scene that was scary. Big mistake.

So, apparently this is not neither the only nor the scariest part of the movie.. they will pour now reguarly and the wild bears will be jumping at your little ones off the screan roaring and screaming regularly, add to it pretty intense scenes of fights
lacking othe cutness of those brawls of the TAngled or How to tame the Dragon.. and you just have really really brutal movie.

The dialogues are over the top for the littlest ones and just enoguh confusing for the little big girls who hear words like ""mother - I hate you"" etc.. you might really want to think over the idea of watching it with your kid.

The nudity.. oh yea baby.. I am not sure how comfortable you are with old and rather unappealing men running around the screan showing their BARE bottoms!!!!!  but you are there for a treat! add to it three little boys doing the very same thing and there you have it.

One of the scenes that I personaly object to on many levels is a scenes showing the girl and the bear hounting for fish,
showing how they throw spear, how the poor fish is moving on the sharp stick still alive as they practice eating it alive..
this is very much in the face of all parents who are trying to show kids gentle handling of nature, animals etc..
It is plain scary to very little ones as all of the sudden they see a poor fish that to themis just as much a character -
being put on  a sharp spear  - one little girl in the theather screamed loud - mama help the fish~! help the fish! they are hurting it!!! and a second later the fish ripped into shreads sends the kid screaming in horror off the theather!

yeah, things like that.

And then you have those moments like the house of the witch where you wonder if they possibly could put any more hell-like
visions, and then you have a sensless fight with huge black demonish bear in the undercastle dengeon.. and dark forest..
as he fights for his life with another bear - up close and personal, super violent fight of two ferocious animals with roars and looks  more like beasts then animals - magic of the screen.. and special effects..
then one of them dies right in front of our wide open eyes as we hold to the last thread of hope that this is not how it will end.. there must be something more to it.. the big black bad bear who after all IS a spirit of the guy must be saved by the other bear and not just smashed in front of our eyes with huge stone!!!! so only his paw sticks out...  oh  yeah baby right in front of your little one's eyes.

I personally think that this movie is as apropriate for kids under 10 as R rated movie. It is not only full of profanity, and bad language and violence that many of the R rated movies would proudly display but it is also just plain scary, it might
scare your kid for life if you ask me.

I heard noting but talks between angry parents who to the last moment were hoping for some non violent and good outcome of it and nobody could really get going home with this happy cozy feeling.

It is obvious that NO ONE making this movie thought even for a second about kids who will be watching it.
Unfortunately we live in the times when they will be making those movies as long as we are going to see them.
I for one feel cheated as I would never seat through it knowing what I am for and the miss-representing the trught
and real character of this movie trailer should be just illegal.

If you plan to go and see this movie - do read ALL possible review checking and focus on the bad ones as the good ones are apparently not telling you what are you going to see, read all parental guides, all one star reviews and then know what it is.
I would definitely stay away from it fro any little girl under 10, and if you have a boy who can take anything.. then probably
7 would be the minimum, I saw many of 7 year old boys still leaving the theather crying so you be the judge.",1341705600,50,7881,4.258366800535475

Set in 10th Century Scotland, Merida is a Scottish princess and her parents are preparing to marry her off in a manner consistent with the times. Her hand in marriage shall go to the prince of one of the neighboring clans; the one who can best prove his worth by winning a competition in some area of traditional masculinity. But spunky Merida has plans of her own, she carefully chooses archery as the designated contest and then boldly competes herself to win her right to stay single.

When that doesn't work, Merida follows the woodland wisps to seek her fate.  She makes a bargain with a witch exchanging her valuable necklace for a spell to make her mother understand her better.  Suffice it to say that the  result was unexpected.

Mixing accurate historical Scotland with ancient folklore, this charming little film does a terrific job of depicting current family issues and the underlying love that provides the family foundation.

The scenery are based on real settings in Scotland and were breathtaking in brilliant colors.

But the thing I really loved about the film was the strong female protagonist who was both physically and emotionally tough. A heroine with a mind of her own, who doesn't need a man to complete her. These are the types of characters that I want my daughters to grow up with.

Well-done, Pixar!!",1341619200,8,1457,4.7272727272727275

The film is happy and sad, funny, and has emotional momemts, even a touch of magic is in the air.  It is colorful and has music, even to the bagpipes of Scotland.  This is a Disney Pixar film, so you have the wonderful animations that feel almost human.

The movie begins with the king and queen playing with their little red-haired daughter on her birthday.  Even at the ripe old age of maybe 5, little Merida is headstrong, bright, and bubbly.  And she sees the wisps, a kind of blue fairy type light that sends her in certain directions.

We watch Princess Merida grow, and be instructed in the ways of a Princess by her ""Mum,"" the Queen.  Now that she is of age, Mum decides it is time to have a suitor party so the gents can compete for her hand.  But Merida has a mind of her own.  Just to add a little extra excitement, Merida has three young brothers (triplets!)

Again, this is a fun flick with lots of funny moments, some even laugh-out-louds.  And the bagpipes are always special to me (some of my heritage).  Some valuable lessons for the children about perception, seeing things in a certain way, responsibilities, listening to others, considering alternatives, forgiveness and love.

In short, imo, Brave doesn't come close to either Madagascar 3, or Ice Age 4.
Madagascar 3 and Ice Age 4, were both (almost) ""continuos laughs from start to end"", for me.
Not so with Brave. Brave was more, like ""a few luaghs here and there"".
It's a nice story, mother-daughter fairy tale, mistic, excelent animations (as we expect from Pixar),.. and that's it.

I'd think mother and daugthers will like and appreciate this movie, even without the laughs.

1157231,5,7799133104,"""It's not my fault!"" We hear this familiar cry many times during the course of this exciting PG-rated film. A doughty red-haired girl and her faithful horse are up against an old curse that has turned one Scottish clan against another. Not only that, our willful and stubborn princess is in full revolt against her mother's attempts to turn her into a lady. She would much rather be in the forest with her bow and arrows, or climbing rocks to test her courage.

The combination of Pixar and Disney gives us wonderful emotion, with the mother's subtle expressions that ring true, plus stunningly realistic animals: the horse in particular is amazing, although the bear is good, too. (I didn't like the dogs.)

Voiced by:
  * Kelly Macdonald (""Boardwalk Empire"") is Merida, our tomboy princess, who has long curly red hair and blue eyes, the perfect Scots lass. Ms Macdonald was born in Scotland, but as an actress, she plays any nationality (""No Country For Old Men""); here we are treated to an authentic Scots' brogue.
  * Emma Thompson (""Men in Black III"") is exquisite as a frustrated Queen Elinor, struggling with her rebellious daughter who does NOT want to be a lady!
  * Billy Connolly (""Gulliver's Travels"") is King Fergus, rambunctious, brawling, and with one peg leg, due to an historic bout with a bear many years ago.
  * Julie Walters (""Momma Mia!"") cackles her way around our heroine as The Witch, full of more trickery than teeth.

Animation gets better and better, plus the sound was outstanding. The horse's hoof-beats were clearly those of a massive Clydesdale rather than a regular-size riding horse. Don't ask me how I know....

Expect lots of brawling, chaotic chase scenes and a truly violent fight between two bears. Bloodless, but with lots of roaring, claws and teeth. Not a child in our packed screening audience moved a muscle, so I'll be sure to tell my JayFlix.net folks when Amazon has this available on DVD.

Surprisingly, even though this is Disney, there was no Prince Charming, our little heroine is pretty self sufficient; and then, because this is Disney, our heroine finally owns up to her mistakes and admits it when something IS her fault! Whew!

The trailer reveals a flowing locks, red-headed girl who is being forced to marry the winner of an archery contest to dawn her own bow and arrow, step out onto the archery field and put, not one, but three arrows dead center of the target, splitting the third arrow down the middle. Then of course the words ""Brave"" jump to the middle of the screen with a dramatic crescendo of music. So, what is the movie all about?  Well, it's from Pixar, the guys behind ""Toy Story"", ""Cars"", ""The Incredibles"", ""Up"", yada yada yada, you get the point and you know their stuff.

First and foremost, the movie opens with beautiful ""Braveheart""ish scenery that is done justice by the Pixar team and their abilities continue to dazzle throughout, bringing the characters and situations to life. You expect nothing less from the artists who have done such incredible work in the past and ""Brave"" is no exception. Yet, Pixar has set their own bar and we don't go to the movies expecting to be dazzled by them like we were when we saw ""Toy Story"" for the first time. We know what they're capable of and we're not surprised by it anymore. Their artistry is commonplace now. So, we need a story and ""Brave"" may, or may not have delivered.

The movie starts off with what we saw in the trailer and builds upon that. We learn about Princess Merida, voiced by Kelly MacDonald and most importantly Queen Elinor, voiced by Emma Thompson. We learn about their complicated relationship and how tradition is expected of Merida and they both have conflicting views about how Merida should go forward in life. The relationship comes to a head and things happen that I won't delve into and then the movie goes into uncharted territory. Once Merida flees from her life, we start to see where all the mysteriousness leads. We start to see all the things that Pixar kept from us with their extremely vague trailer.

I won't delve into that because it was kept from the audience for a reason and I hate ruining movies for people, but what does happen was unexpected and I didn't see it coming. Unfortunately though, underneath all the Pixar animation magic, the story that resides is kind of thin. It is a fairy tale type movie and it never really delves beyond that. The movies becomes sort of clich&eacute; and forgettable. Had dozens of movies previous not had such a collective similarity, ""Brave"" may have been better, but the story never really grabbed me like it should of and I found myself sort of just watching, instead of living it.

Not to say that ""Brave"" is a bad movie, cause it isn't. It is just a middle of the road movie for a Pixar company that has set the bar so high in the past. I am always elated to see what Pixar has been working on. I remember watching ""Toy Story"" for the first time and I remember feeling like a kid, dazzled to the core. ""Brave"" isn't dazzling, it is just a movie.",1341446400,10,2960,4.545966228893058
1157233,4,7799133104,"Pixar has produced some of the best animated films ever made, and even the worst offerings are better than the work of most rival studios. However, after seeing trailers for Brave, I found myself wondering whether it would live up to my expectations. People running into walls or being hit in the groin are usually there to get a few cheap laughs and I expect more from a Pixar movie.

I shouldn't have worried.

Brave is aimed at a younger audience than Pixar's best work like Ratatouille and Up. Although it does contain deeper themes, such as conflict between mother and daughter, and dealing with society's expectations, the story is easy to follow. There were quite a few small children present in the theater when I saw the movie and I could hear them laughing and curiously asking questions about the characters. It also worked for me, and I'm by no means a small child.

A few of the action scenes and some of the scenes set in the dark forest might worry very young children, but I don't think there's anything frightening enough to stop anyone seeing Brave.

Those who were complaining that Pixar hasn't featured a female protagonist finally have a reason to celebrate; Merida (Macdonald) is featured heavily throughout, and she's a princess, although not in the traditional Disney style. You will hear a couple of songs, and there is a witch in the story, but Brave is not simply rehashing the formula exhausted in Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella. Instead, Merida is like a tougher version of Rapunzel from Tangled.

Brave is a coming-of-age tale set in ancient Scotland. The main clan-leaders all have sons, and Merida is expected to marry one of them. Unfortunately, she doesn't feel ready for marriage and wants time to discover how she feels about adult pursuits. All she really wants to do is enjoy her childhood, ride her horse, and practice her archery. This is essentially a story about a girl trying to change her fate.

Some of the supporting characters are funny. Her potential suitors are an interesting bunch of misfits, and they supply a few laughs early in the story. Merida's three younger brothers appear regularly and are used in very inventive ways.

Be prepared to hear Scottish accents throughout the movie. It reminded me somewhat of How to Train Your Dragon in that respect. I didn't find myself rooting for Merida as strongly as I rooted for Remy in Ratatouille because the outcome never really felt in doubt. Although Merida faces considerable peril, I never suspected that things would end badly.

The voice acting was particularly good. Merida's father (Connolly) stole a lot of scenes and was the source of much of the humor. Kelly Macdonald did well as Merida and kept her likable, even though some of her actions were misguided. I also noticed how effective Patrick Doyle's score was. Unlike most Pixar movies, Brave is full of action, and the music enhanced those sequences considerably.

The opening five minutes provided some of the strongest scenes in the movie as we were able to see Merida as a small girl and the relationship she had with her parents. Other magical moments included her encounter with will o' the wisps in the forest. Both of these elements reminded me of Studio Ghibli works, but Brave couldn't maintain that high standard for the whole movie.

What we are left with is an enjoyable 90 minutes with plenty of laughs. There's less substance than that found in the best Pixar movies, but it's still a worthy addition and I will buy the Blu-ray when it is released. The overall look of the animation does match Pixar's excellent standards and it's hard to imagine it looking any better. Be prepared for a few cheap laughs, but don't miss it in theaters. I saw the 3D version and I don't think it added anything to the experience, so stick to the 2D version if you want to save a few bucks.

I was pleasantly surprised by the full movie after being disappointed by the rather formulaic trailers. I should also mention that La Luna, the latest short from Pixar, airs immediately before Brave. That's well worth your time too.",1341187200,3,4097,4.764456981664316
1157234,4,7799133104,"After last year's Cars 2, many were wondering if Pixar was starting to see a downward turn from the Pixar that gave us the toy story series, UP, and Finding Nemo. Many went this summer to see Brave to see for themselves if Pixar was going to be giving us another great Pixar film, or a Pixar film that is better than most but poor in comparison to their other films. I took my 5 year old son with this goal in mind.

I must say that Pixar returned to the fold of giving a great story with beautiful animations like they have in the past. Brave will not stand up to some of the greater Pixar films (and in my opinion those are Monsters Inc, UP, Toy Story 3, and Incredibles) but it is far better than some of the worst (Cars, Cars 2, Bugs life...once again my opinion). It sits right in the middle IMO of all of the Pixar films. And lets be honest, with respect to all other animated films...or live action for that matter, being an average to above average Pixar films is better than 95% of what else is out there.

***Spoilerish***
The story is about a young princess and her mother for the most part. The young girl is a free spirit while her mother, the queen, is attempting to train her to be a presentable future queen. The young girl is set to be married to one of three princes that, as tradition dictates, are to compete for her hand. The young princess decides to compete for her own hand to free herself from her obligations. This does not set well with the queen and results in a large fight that ends with the princess running away to a witch and asking her help to change her destiny. Let's just say that you should always be careful what you wish for and her actions result in the kingdom falling into disarray. While the kingdom is falling apart, the young princess works to figure out a way to turn back her decisions and mend the battered relationship between her and the queen.

There is plenty of humor to keep the kids interested and plenty of adult humor to keep the parents from nodding off. I will say that my 5 year old was frightened a few times throughout the movie so I will warn that some younger children may not like it.

After the movie, my wife said it wasn't funny enough and my son said it was too scary, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. Is it among the best Pixar films? No but it is a great film and a pretty good one for Pixar...which is better than 95% of everything else.",1341187200,2,2406,4.223913043478261
1157235,4,7799133104,"""Brave"" is Disney/ Pixar's newest animated wonder, a wonderful story about the young and fiercely independent Merida, Scottish daughter of Queen Elinor and King Fergus.  The story is solid but doesn't break any new ground here: we have the princess Merida who takes after her rough-and-tumble dad and would rather hunt quail than knit mittens.  This puts her at odds with her means-well mother who is trying to teach her how to be a royal (think ""The Princess Diaries"") but Merida, whose untamed and unruly spirit is matched by those gobs of red firebrands that make up her hair, wants none of it and defies the convention of being married off to one of the sons of the heads of the opposing clans.  Because that's just not fair.  And herein our heroine asserts herself and does something very modern: she enters the challenge for her own hand and wins.  The rift between Merida and her mother comes to a breaking point and Merida makes use of a witch's spell to try to get her mother off her back (think about the storyline in Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"").

The story picks up from here as Merida's mum becomes (what else?) a literal mama bear.  There's some fun here and we have a great deal of sympathy for Queen bear Elinor.  But this was just the trick to help mom and daughter bond, albeit it's a little saccharine, and Merida discovers her love for her mom while her mom discovers the value of Merida's independence.  (Some of this recalls the wonderful and underrated ""Brother Bear"" movie.)

The real focus of this film is on the fierce bonds (including the fierce pulls and pushes) between mother and daughter, between the mama bear and her cubs.  She is, after all, willing to die for them and the mama bear is a tried-and-true caricature of what people and circumstances should not do in coming between her and her offspring.  This aspect of the story works in ""Brave"" even if the other aspects of the story and humor aren't up to the usual Pixar standards.  It is still better than most of what else is out there.",1341187200,3,2027,4.581717451523546
1157236,5,7799133104,"Princess Merida of the Dunbroch clan hates tradition, despises it with every fiber of her being. She loves adventuring, riding her horse, and, above all, archery. Her mother always reprimands her for doing unladylike things, which cover just about everything she likes, and instructs her how to be proper and respectful. The lessons culminate when Merida is expected to marry the young man who wins the competition between the three clans in the kingdom. Refusing to conform to convention, Merida decides to compete for her own hand and wins. She and her mother fight, leaving both tearful, frustrated, and angry. Merida rides into the woods and is let to a witch's cottage by wisps. After buying all the witch's wooden wares, she gives Merida a spell to changer her mother which would in turn change her fate. The spell doesn't go as Merida wanted, so she and her mother go in search of the witch to change her mother back to the way she was.

I have been looking forward to Brave for a long time and it definitely didn't disappoint me. This is the first Pixar film to feature both a setting in the past and a female protagonist. Both the medieval Scottish setting and Merida serve the film well. The lush greens and wonderful Scottish landscapes are just perfect for this film. They really help in creating the mood of possibility, mystery, and magic. The visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and seem more realistic than many other recent computer animated films. Merida is a breath of fresh air after so many simpering, weak, boring female protagonists of recent years. Merida is as fiery and wild as her hair. She knows who she is and what she wants in life. Her intelligence and cleverness sometimes get her into trouble, but it's nice to see these qualities revered for once. Even though she rashly makes decisions without thinking them through and hurts some people in the process, I appreciated that this warrior princess erred on the side of impulse. Beneath it all, she truly loved and cared for her family, but didn't really know how to balance their needs with her own. Her endearing personality and the goodness at her core outweighed her carelessness and the ramifications of her impulsive actions on everyone around her.

I don't believe this is really a children's film. It's a film that really speaks to mothers and teenage daughters. The conflict between Merida and her mother Elinor that is in the center of this film has no clear side that is right. Merida wants what any teenage girl wants: freedom to be herself and pursue her dreams. An arranged marriage is the last thing she wants. Elinor, on the other hand, has more than herself and her daughter to think about. The fate of the kingdom is in her hands and she must think of the kingdom's safety and wellbeing as well as her family's. Both of these women have valid worries and concerns. If they had spoken to each other rationally, they may have resolved their problems before anyone got transformed, but they are both stubborn and felt they couldn't open up to each other. I think anyone can relate to not being able to communicate with their parents or their teenaged children. Although there is a witch that can be blamed on the surface for Merida and Elinor's predicament, the real villain of the piece is really Merida, her rash decisions, and her inability to take responsibility for them. The witch is an easy scapegoat for younger viewers who don't yet understand more complex themes, but she is only in the film for a very short time and isn't particularly malicious. Some of the humor in the film is fairly simple and childish I believe to entertain young children, but the bulk of the film is for a much older crowd.

One of the main shining stars of this film for me is the soundtrack. It is phenomenal and is rapidly becoming one of my favorites. I'm not too familiar with Patrick Doyle's body of work besides Thor, but after this I will seek out anything else he does. The soundtrack is incredibly varied and utilizes a variety of instruments from the Scottish culture, such as bagpipes, dulcimers, flutes, a fiddle, and a bodhran. Scottish reels and jigs create excitement and momentum, while a simple lullaby theme featuring quiet dulcimer and solemn fiddle create tenderness and sadness. My favorite is the lullaby theme from the song Noble Maiden Fair sung in Gaelic by Merida and Elinor. When that theme recurs throughout the film, it just pulls on my heart strings and makes me cry. I also loved that 3 featured songs came from the movie: Touch the Sky and Into the Open Air performed by Julie Fowlis, my new favorite Scottish singer, and Learn Me Right by Mumford and Sons. I love all these songs and have been listening to the whole soundtrack on loop since I saw it earlier this week. Another gorgeous song by Julie Fowlis was featured in the trailer for Brave, but wasn't on the soundtrack called Tha Mo Ghaol Air Aird A' Chuain. It's another gorgeous song with Julie Fowlis' pure tones and a simple strings accompaniment and one of two that are actually in Gaelic.

In addition to being incredibly entertaining, full of heart, and full of emotion, Brave is a good step forward in fairy tale films. First, it's an original tale with the basic trappings that put the audience at ease. However, the conclusion is much different than most princess stories. ** SPOILERS** At the end of the film, Merida and Elinor come to a compromise and it's agreed by all the the young people will choose their own spouses. Unlike many other fairy tales, there is no real love interest for Merida and she doesn't get married at the end. She is not defined as a character by any romantic relationship. It also lets the audience see an alternative to marriage or having a family as a life choice in general. I found that refreshing in a genre that almost always ends with a marriage and a happily ever after. I loved Brave and consider it one of my favorite Pixar films. It was entertaining to both children and adults and pushed the boundaries of what a fairy tale princess film can be.",1340928000,4,6069,4.674462114125351

It was a delightful tale. Much better than the mediocre Disney animated films of the last 10-15 years. I enjoy most of the Pixar films though. I thought the script was well written and the choice of voices for the film was excellent. Have long been a fan of Billy Connolly for other things.

The animation was absolutely wonderful. The characters were purely animated but the background scenery seemed almost real.

1157306,5,7799133104,"Pixar Animation Studios has always been known for their unique approach to filmmaking. They have always put the story first and foremost, something that so many other studios seem to take for granted. They also know the rest of the ingredients to add to make their films stand out from the rest: Great characters, lots of heart, and a goodly quantity of humor.

While not continuing the 21st century tradition of turning the fairy-tale on its head, as in the case of ""Shrek"", ""Brave"", feels like a rediscovered story by Grimm's with an unmistakably Pixarian flavor. Legends and myths abound in Scots folklore, and the writers at Pixar didn't have far to go in order to come up with their own story, one that is at once relevant, quite original, and yet entirely congruous with one's expectations of the perfect fairy-tale. As fresh and surprising as any of the studio's previous successes, I enjoyed it immensely, and could watch it many times over without growing tired of it. It's hard to find a real family film that everyone can enjoy together, but this one comes pretty to close to that ideal.

In the ultimate cautionary tale of being careful what you wish for, the film, set in 10th century Scotland, concerns Princess Merida, a feisty, strong-willed, adventure-seeking lass, skilled with both a sword and a bow and arrow, who would rather practice archery and ride through the woods with her horse, Angus, than follow the path desired for her by her parents; or more specifically, her mother. Determined to avoid her fate, she runs away, and manages to find a way to alter her destiny. To make a long story short, this ill-chosen wish sets off a chain of events that threaten to destroy everything Merida holds dear and the entire kingdom of DunBroch along with it.

This fresh take on a typical princess character pleasantly surprised me, as well as the fact that the emotional core of the film, as well as most of the plot, stems not from a romantic relationship between prince and princess, but from the mother/daughter relationship between Merida and Queen Elinor. Anyone who is a daughter like I am will easily relate to how complicated the bond can be between a mother and her child, and this film portrays that unique bond beautifully. Without giving too much away, it is their love for each other and their clashing of personalities that ultimately moves the entire film forward, and the changes they both experience throughout the course of the film give them both a better understanding of each other, and emphasize the importance of empathy, bravery, courage, family, and love.

Not content with just being an entertaining theatrical experience, the film goes into a level of moral and emotional depth that even fans of Pixar may be unfamiliar with. It takes a very special film to bring me to tears, and I was moved quite often. Not to say that ""Brave"" is strictly a tear-jerker, because it is not. I'd estimate that there is more action, adventure, and humor than in any other Pixar movie to date.

There is no doubt that ""Brave"" is one of Pixar's most beautifully animated films. The amount of detail is simply brilliant, and computer technology being what it is today, there are times when the visuals on screen almost rival the real world. I've never been to Scotland, but the richness and beauty of the country expressed in the film makes me feel as if I had. The landscapes are simply breathtaking, and so photo-realistic you might feel as if you've just fallen into the wilds of the Highlands; I'm sure that more than one viewing would be needed to absorb it all. The rendering on the hair and fabric is especially lifelike, and certain scenes involving non-human characters might make you do a double-take, they appear so true-to-life!

Composer Patrick Doyle's score is appropriately Scottish in flavor, combining the expected Gaelic melodies (jigs, reels, and such like), with more modern, atmospheric, incidental scoring. Sprightly where it needs to be and brooding where it doesn't, it perfectly enhances the movie to the point that it feels as organic as the moss on the trees. The gentle lullaby, ""A Mhaighdean Bhan Uasal"", sung by Emma Thompson, is one of the stand-out pieces, and serves as the kind of musical representation of the love between Merida and Elinor. I also quite enjoyed ""Song of Mor'du"", a sort of Scotch drinking song, heard mainly in the background, but reiterated often throughout the rest of the score. There are also three other songs: ""Touch The Sky"" and ""Into The Open Air"", performed by Scots songstress Julie Fowlis, and ""Learn Me Right"", sung by Birdy, with Mumford and Sons, which, while not written by Doyle, fit expertly into their places in the story and aptly enhance the film.

Now, a good animated character needs a good voice to bring them to life, and the entire cast is all very well-chosen and very well-acted. Comprised mainly of Scottish and English actors, including Billy Connolly as King Fergus, Emma Thompson as Queen Elinor, Robbie Coltrane as Lord Dingwall, Julie Walters as the Witch, and the incomparable Kelly Macdonald as Merida herself, it would be hard to find another group of people so perfect in their roles. Macdonald is wonderful as the flame-haired heroine, and Thompson simply shines as the equally obstinate but caring mother. Billy Connolly is a great counterpoint to her more level-headed and dutiful Queen, but gets far less screen time than either of the two female protagonists.

To sum it all up, ""Brave"" is a beautiful, touching, exciting, and refreshingly original film, one that is entertaining on so many levels and can stand proudly alongside any of Pixar's previous masterpieces. I would rank it as one of my favorite (if not my favorite) Pixar film, and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.",1340496000,426,5807,4.852674066599395
1157307,4,7799133104,"The princess Merida is a teen with a mind of her own, wild red hair and ""tomboy"" ways struggling against her mom's constant lessons on how to behave like a proper/perfect princess. When her parents offer her hand in marriage to strangers, she runs off and ends up meeting a witch. She buys a spell to ""change her mother"" and it unexpectedly turns her mom into a bear. (And in turn, her 3 little brothers who get into the leftover spell which was disguised as a pie).  Merida has to keep everyone from killing her mom while trying to break the spell.

There's a bit of fun to her trying to teach her mom to fish like a bear - but also moments where the mom stops being mom as a bear, and becomes just a dangerous bear for a bit.

AWESOME animation -- happy to have another story for the girls to encourage non-princess behavior (sports, independance etc.) instead of looking pretty and marrying a prince to live happily ever after - not so big on the give your mom a spell idea - but lessons are learned and all is well in the end. The 3 little redheaded boys are cute/fun little devils.

I heard a few laughs from the parents and didn't hear anything from the kids that would indicate it was too scary for them, or boring - most seemed pretty glued to their seats.  But the accents might make this a little bit difficult to understand for some.

Overall, another good movie from Pixar! (Even better if you didn't see the trailers)

Personally though, this is not one I'd want to watch over and over (like some of the animated movies) so I probably won't buy it - but you should enjoy it at least the first time.",1340496000,2,1611,4.297029702970297
1157308,4,7799133104,"So what is there to say that hasn't been said? All the reviews for this film have nearly universally claimed that the animation is fantastic, as one would expect, and it is indeed. The scenery is gorgeous, the 3D really helps the beautiful visuals pop and provides depth, the character designs are distinctive (if not slightly reminiscent of Dreamworks How to Train Your Dragon). Any animation fan will enjoy watching this film.

As for the film overall, the story is charming, if not also quite familiar, and there is certainly enough humor and funny sounding pronunciations (the Scottish accents are purposefully hammed up at times) to keep children engaged. One caution up front, I would advise against taking toddlers, or extremely timid children, as there is a frightening bear, seen for a much more tame moment in the previews, who has several less tame scenes scattered throughout the film. Another caution for readers of the review, I am going to strongly hint at the major plot point of the film, I won't come right out and say it but I will say that by now most will have pieced it together from previews and other reviews, so this review shouldn't spoil anyone who hasn't figured it out already.

All this said, I usually don't write reviews to simply regurgitate what has been said already, so I do have a point here I would like to make. The difference between this film and a true transcendent classic is that this film does nothing new or truly unique (well perhaps one thing, but we'll get to that). It is excellent to see a female heroine (especially one this strong) but the very notion of putting a female up front is something that has been done purposefully before, so even that cannot be said to make this film unique. I'm sure many, especially some mothers, will adore this film and they have every right to, it is charming in many respects. A great many more people will enjoy this film moderately and put it in their collection to rewatch, but this film will never be as great or as remembered as it could have been, and as an animation/Pixar fan that leaves me somewhat disappointed.

The previews are deliberately vague regarding the actual story of this film. The opening is clear enough, a princess doesn't want to marry and butts heads with her mother so she goes in search of a spell to change her fate... it all seems familiar but is bold in its honesty and execution. However, from there I found the film became less Brave and more like what I will call Mama Bear, somewhat of a spinoff take on Disney's Brother Bear. The film runs with this new conceit, dropping what I deemed to be the more interesting story of the princess's efforts to win her own hand and convince her mother to change tradition, but never goes anywhere with it other than the usual predictable places. Predictability isn't a bad thing, it is often comforting and in many ways is even expected from any film, let alone a family film. But as a Disney Pixar film one would have thought they'd push the boundaries here or at least have the story be incredibly well told. Ultimately, the 'Mama Bear' idea just isn't mined to its full potential, though that doesn't stop it from being fun and having laughs.

Overall the film, which admittedly had a troubled production, feels like a pastiche of earlier efforts by Disney and even some of their rival studios. There is even a random witch character thrown into the mix but then she disappears never to return or be mentioned again. A lot of elements in the film are that way, they appear, play their part in the plot and then disappear or vanish until they may or may not be needed again. There are few strong through lines. More evidence to this is that the only villain truly presented here seems to be stubbornness (and perhaps that scary bear who waltzes in and out of the plot with little purpose), which is again a potentially interesting angle but it doesn't fully develop and things are wrapped up too easily in that regard without any sacrifice and surprisingly little effort. The film also seems unable to decide whether it wants to be classic fairy tale (i.e. Disney's traditional formula) or take the true Pixar/Dreamworks route and have a modern take (i.e. Toy Story, Shrek, etc.), as such much of the film feels in a definite time and place but then certain scenes have modern references thrown in.

Now back to finding praise for the film, the stubborn characters are the princess, and her mother the queen. Both want what they want and desire for the other to see their point of view (sound familiar to any parents of adolescents?). The story does do an excellent job of portraying the trials of a mother and daughter relationship, at least from my experiences as an observer. The teenage princess really goes for the throat and the mother truly loses her control in one crucial moment and it all feels heartwrenchingly true to life. The one original thing I praise about the film is that mother-daughter relationship, but ironically at the same time it feels too realistic and thus out of place in a movie that tones everything else down. Another positive note is that neither the mother nor the daughter ultimately gives into the other but instead a wonderful scene shows how both have come to understand the other and they find a common ground, which is much better than simply having a stubborn parent realize they were wrong (you know, little mermaid style).

I do recommend this film to animation fans, children kindergarten and up, or even for mothers and their adolescent daughters. It is well made and extremely well animated but overall as a 23 year old male film fan who adores Pixar (and Disney even more so) I have to say this film reminded me of Disney's Brother Bear, which was unfortunately only moderately successful. While I personally love that film and feel it brings together so many themes so wonderfully (the Inuit culture, man vs. nature, family bonds, beautiful and unique settings) this film takes the conceit from that film and never plays it out as well as it could or with the originality one comes to expect from Pixar. Even a straight A student gets a B once and a while, I just wish this film had been as strong willed as its main character, picked one direction and been more... well, Brave.

Still highly recommended, with less gags but definitely more depth than Madagascar 3, but far from a must see for the casual filmgoer.",1340496000,15,6426,4.656387665198238
1157309,1,7799133104,"Just saw this movie with several nieces and nephews and I was sooooooo disappointed.  Merida (the main character) is not lovable, but comes across as rebellious, scowly, and self-centered.  It's really hard to like her, let alone love her.  The writing was dismal - not enough laughs, the plot itself is weird (Merida follows blue blobs and happily embraces witchcraft?), and characters that could have been hilarious (the triplet siblings, the princes who were vying for Merida's hand) were never properly developed.  It was also sadly disappointing for the movie to have NO romance and I mean NONE.  Finally, there were lots of butts (bare) and breasts (much focus on a servant's cleavage).  Don't waste your money on this one!",1340496000,53,729,5.033333333333333

It is Shakespearean in its amusing look at the parenting segment of the Human Condition, and will be every familys list of Good Ones for times to come.

Technically, the sound and visuals are lush, and natural; Scotland couldn't have asked for a better tourism advertisement. The characters are original, well drawn, entertainingand somehow familiar. They seem like people we all have run across at one time or another.

The best part is the story itself, but I won't be a spoiler here. The film should be in every familys collection, and a must for the Disney aficionadi everywhere! Wish I could give it 6 stars!",1525910400,,745,4.679389312977099
