8661906,3,B00KVOBXYC,"This disc from the 1999 continues the popular series of annual concerts aimed at celebrating the founding of the BPO in May 1882. It continues the tradition of being held in a venue of musical and European significance. That significance is the subject of the interesting 20 minute documentary that explores the musical life of the venue, Krakow, which includes interviews with Penderecki.

By 1999 audio video technology had moved on a great deal from earlier days at the beginning of the decade. As a result the recording quality is recognisably more of an HD product than the first concerts in the series although still being some distance from matching the very high standards of current HD recording.

The screen format is 16:9 and the sound is presented in DTS-HD as well as stereo. Imaging offers good skin and instrumental tones and is clear and sharp, even in longer shots.

The musical performances range from the Classical era with Mozart through to the mid-Romantic period of Schumann via Chopin. The two soloists, Christine Schafer soprano and Emanuel Ax pianist are both well respected as performers of Mozart and Chopin respectively and do not disappoint on this occasion although collectors may well prefer the account of the concerto by Kissin on Accentus or Ohlsson on Ideal Audience. Both of those are better recorded and far livelier as performances. Each disc offers both of the Chopin concertos.

Haitink is enormously respected for deeply considered performances, many of which, rather like these, could be reasonably described as trenchant.
The solo performances are therefore more satisfyingly serious rather than spontaneously buoyant and that is also true of Haitink's conception and delivery of Schumann's Spring symphony which is more of a sober view of Spring than a joyous one.
Collectors who are familiar with the CD accounts of either Sawallisch or Gardiner for example, will know what is meant by this distinction and there are preferable versions of the concerto on CD for collectors to consider.

On DVD/Blu-ray there are more seemingly spontaneous accounts of this symphony now available from Paavo Jarvi on C Major or Spira Mirabilis on Euroarts. They offer completely different couplings but are preferable as regards the Schumann symphony and as recordings. Equally collectors would do well to consider the accounts of the Chopin concerto by Kissin or Ohlsson as mentioned previously.

The orchestra plays very well throughout and delivers everything that is asked of them. Overall this is a satisfying concert rather than one offering inspiration or exhilaration but it should give purchasers plenty of reward in that way particularly if they warm to the two soloists or to Bernard Haitink as a conductor.",1406678400,,2746,5.173423423423423
