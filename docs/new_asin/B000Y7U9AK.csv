3011993,5,B000Y7U9AK,"Family Ties - The Complete Third Season is probably the funniest season. Alex starts College, Mallory gets a job at a clothing store (fashion is her passion) and Jennifer goes boy-crazy. Elyse discovers she is pregnant, some viewers thought an unexpected pregnancy killed the show but I think it was a great idea. My favorite episodes include: The Gambler, Little Man on Campus, Hotline Fever, Cry Baby, and Cold Storage. I highly recommend this classic '80s show. Enjoy!",1211760000,,471,5.051282051282051
3011994,5,B000Y7U9AK,"It would be really hard for me to pick a favorite season of Family Ties, but #3 is tough to beat.  In addition to a major change (the birth of baby Andrew in the classic 2-parter in which Elyse goes into labor during a public t.v. telethon), there are so many favorite episodes/moments: Geena Davis shakes things up as a housekeeper on whom Alex develops a crush; jealous Jennifer dressing up to crash Mallory's date; Steven & Elyse regret leaving the kids alone for the weekend; Alex taking calls on a crisis hotline. . .those are just a few off the top of my head.

True, we have to wait one more season for Nick, as well as Alex's great love (and Michael J. Fox's real-life wife) Tracey Pollan.  But season 3 is definitely Family Ties at the top of its game.",1201910400,11,761,4.345070422535211
3011995,5,B000Y7U9AK,"Family Ties is an American television sitcom which aired on NBC for seven seasons, from 1982 to 1989. At the height of its popularity, Family Ties was #2 in the yearly Nielsen ratings, as it aired in the prized time-slot right after the top-rated Cosby Show on Thursday nights.

It starred Michael J. Fox as Alex P. Keaton, the conservative, business-oriented son of liberal parents Elyse and Steven (Meredith Baxter-Birney and Michael Gross). Elyse was a successful architect, while Steven ran a public television station. They lived in suburban Columbus, Ohio with their children: Alex, Mallory (""Mal"") (Justine Bateman) and Jennifer (""Jen"") (Tina Yothers). Another child, Andrew (""Andy"") (Brian Bonsall), was added later.

Andy will be of preschool age in one episode, the very next show he's only one year old, then the next he'll be in preschool again.  Mallory is dating Nick, then an episode will show up from two seasons prior when she broke up with Rick and Alex is fixing her up, then there will be another old episode, and then it resumes with her being with Nick again in the correct season.  Jennifer is in high school is season 5 but there are two episodes of her 13th birthday party mixed in and it's painfully obvious she's younger in those than the rest.  Ellen was gone in last season, but she's here in season 5!  It's rude for the production company to not give a you-know-what about continuity when we're paying for these shows.  So, the two stars are for the lousy arrangement, the episodes being mixed up and in the wrong seasons, not just within one but within several seasons, and the interference in viewing pleasure, not the show itself or the DVD quality which are both great.",1396569600,,1157,4.485714285714286

3012072,4,B000Y7U9AK,"FAMILY TIES was an American sitcom that ran for 7 years on NBC from 1982-89 that reflected on a Midwestern families move in the United States from the cultural liberasim of the 1960's and 1970's to the conservatism of the 1980's that was particularly expressed through the relationship between young Republican Alex Keaton(Michael J. Fox), materialistic young lady Mallory(Justine Bateman), athletic tomboy Jennifer(Tina Yothers), independent architect Elyse(Meredith Baxter), and local TV station manager Steven(Michael Gross)whom all resided in suburban Columbus, Ohio.

FAMILY TIES was also an instant smash when it made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 and the series even won multiple awards, including 3 consecutive Emmy Awards for Michael J. Fox as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.

This 1984-85 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 12 years old in the 6th grade and when I used to watch FAMILY TIES at 8:30 PM after THE COSBY SHOW at 8PM every Thursday night on NBC, plus it also takes me back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was ""Let's All Be There"", which was NBC's slogan from the Fall of 1984 thru the Summer of 1986.

FAMILY TIES also had a lot of Hollywood stars appear on this show before they were famous and/or during the early years of their showbiz careers like

*Courtney Cox whom is best known as Monica Geller on FRIENDS had co-starred as Alex's girlfriend(Lauren Miller)on the last 2 seasons of this series

*Christina Applegate whom is best known as the ditzy blonde bombshell(Kelley Bundy)on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN had guest starred as Jennifer's girlfriend(Kitten)in the episode ""Band On The Run""

*Judith Light from WHO'S THE BOSS had appeared in Season 2 as Steven's co-worker who unsuccessfully tries to seduce him

*River Phoenix guest starred in Season 4 as a 14-year old math-genius who develops a crush on Jennifer after a math tutoring session with Alex

*Tom Hanks appeared in the first 2 seasons as Elyse's alcoholic kid brother(Ned)

*Stephen Baldwin which is the baby of the Baldwin brothers guest starred as a member at a therapy group Alex and his girlfriend attended together

*Geena Davis who co-starred in the movies BEETLEJUICE and THE FLY had guest starred in Season 3 as the incompetent housekeeper(Karen)

*Jane Adams guest starred in Season 7 in the 2-parted episode ""They Can't Take That Away From Me""

The third season of ""Family Ties"" manages a simple trick which has spelled the downfall of many other family sitcoms:  Adding a new family member to the existing onscreen family.  But, the birth of Andrew Keaton is only one of the highlights of this exceptional season.

""Here We Go Again"" finds Elyse home with only Skippy Handleman around with which to share the news of a surprise pregnancy.  Much of the humor and poignancy of this episode comes as Steven and the other family members eventually discover the news.  Gary David Goldberg and his creative staff wisely make this storyline a season-long arc.  In one episode called ""Oh, Donna,"" Alex trips into a sticky situation, developing feelings in an emotionally complicated anticipatory crush on a young unwed Lamaze classmate of his parents.  The birth of Andrew 'Andy' Keaton happens in the two-part classic ""Birth of A Keaton,"" especially noteworthy for the humor of Elyse's off-key singing as she goes into labor on public television.

Other shows display creative confidence and versatility.  One of my favorites among this lot is ""Philadelphia Story,"" in which a sick and exhausted Alex falls asleep doing a history assignment and dreams he is in 1776, as the American Declaration of Independence from England is being written.  A great comedic episode from Season Three is ""Help Wanted,"" co-starring Geena Davis as an inept but likable housekeeper.

The two-part season finale ""Remembrance of Things Past"" is a series classic.  It is decidedly dramatic, as Steven's father dies and the Keaton Family goes to Buffalo, New York to settle affairs.  It successfully captures a realistic family generational tone, and is the first show to feature Steven's brother Robert 'Rob' Keaton.

The third season of ""Family Ties"" successfully interweaves a dramatic tone with its expert comedy, all while making room for a fourth Keaton child.  It is absolutely a classic season for the series.",1285459200,3,1960,5.135646687697161
3012075,5,B000Y7U9AK,"I forgot how good this series was.

This is not just a series of loosely connected jokes. There is a story being told.

The Keaton family all love each other, in spite of Alex always insulting his sister. There is a lot of subtle, excellent, acting. The sister Mallory is a poor student, though she tries. Alex is a quicker wit. When Alex insults his sister, Mallory, and the script does not give the actress another line, most actresses would do nothing. However, Justine Bateman is great in this roll, because she does not just do nothing, she responds with a blank look that also says, ""I am trying to think of a comeback, thinking, I cannot come up with one, I am a bit hurt, I am exasperated"", at which point Mallory storms out of the room. These great responses really embellished Alex's insults.

Little sister, Jennifer, always has a clever line. Such as when Alex gets in trouble and brings his little sister along for sympathy. Jennifer realizes this, and asks Alex, ""Do you want me to limp?""

The parents are former hippies, but their son Alex, in sharp contrast, is a preppie, businessman. Skippy is the neighbor boy, who loves Mallory, but Mallory is not interested. All the actors are excellent. Clever scripts. All the seasons are good.",1259366400,5,1251,4.647058823529412

In addition to a major change (the birth of baby Andrew in the classic 2-parter in which Elyse goes into labor during a public t.v. telethon), there are so many favorite episodes/moments: Geena Davis shakes things up as a housekeeper on whom Alex develops a crush; jealous Jennifer dressing up to crash Mallory's date; Steven & Elyse regret leaving the kids alone for the weekend; Alex taking calls on a crisis hotline. . .those are just a few off the top of my head.

True, we have to wait one more season for Nick, as well as Alex's great love (and Michael J. Fox's real-life wife) Tracey Pollan.  But season 3 is definitely Family Ties at the top of its game.",1201910400,11,761,4.345070422535211
3246492,5,B000Y7U9AK,"Family Ties is an American television sitcom which aired on NBC for seven seasons, from 1982 to 1989. At the height of its popularity, Family Ties was #2 in the yearly Nielsen ratings, as it aired in the prized time-slot right after the top-rated Cosby Show on Thursday nights.

It starred Michael J. Fox as Alex P. Keaton, the conservative, business-oriented son of liberal parents Elyse and Steven (Meredith Baxter-Birney and Michael Gross). Elyse was a successful architect, while Steven ran a public television station. They lived in suburban Columbus, Ohio with their children: Alex, Mallory (""Mal"") (Justine Bateman) and Jennifer (""Jen"") (Tina Yothers). Another child, Andrew (""Andy"") (Brian Bonsall), was added later.

Mallory is dating Nick, then an episode will show up from two seasons prior when she broke up with Rick and Alex is fixing her up, then there will be another old episode, and then it resumes with her being with Nick again in the correct season.  Jennifer is in high school is season 5 but there are two episodes of her 13th birthday party mixed in and it's painfully obvious she's younger in those than the rest.  Ellen was gone in last season, but she's here in season 5!  It's rude for the production company to not give a you-know-what about continuity when we're paying for these shows.

3246569,4,B000Y7U9AK,"FAMILY TIES was an American sitcom that ran for 7 years on NBC from 1982-89 that reflected on a Midwestern families move in the United States from the cultural liberasim of the 1960's and 1970's to the conservatism of the 1980's that was particularly expressed through the relationship between young Republican Alex Keaton(Michael J. Fox), materialistic young lady Mallory(Justine Bateman), athletic tomboy Jennifer(Tina Yothers), independent architect Elyse(Meredith Baxter), and local TV station manager Steven(Michael Gross)whom all resided in suburban Columbus, Ohio.

FAMILY TIES was also an instant smash when it made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1982 and the series even won multiple awards, including 3 consecutive Emmy Awards for Michael J. Fox as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.

This 1984-85 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when I was 12 years old in the 6th grade and when I used to watch FAMILY TIES at 8:30 PM after THE COSBY SHOW at 8PM every Thursday night on NBC, plus it also takes me back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was ""Let's All Be There"", which was NBC's slogan from the Fall of 1984 thru the Summer of 1986.

FAMILY TIES also had a lot of Hollywood stars appear on this show before they were famous and/or during the early years of their showbiz careers like

*Courtney Cox whom is best known as Monica Geller on FRIENDS had co-starred as Alex's girlfriend(Lauren Miller)on the last 2 seasons of this series

*Christina Applegate whom is best known as the ditzy blonde bombshell(Kelley Bundy)on MARRIED WITH CHILDREN had guest starred as Jennifer's girlfriend(Kitten)in the episode ""Band On The Run""

*Judith Light from WHO'S THE BOSS had appeared in Season 2 as Steven's co-worker who unsuccessfully tries to seduce him

*River Phoenix guest starred in Season 4 as a 14-year old math-genius who develops a crush on Jennifer after a math tutoring session with Alex

The third season of ""Family Ties"" manages a simple trick which has spelled the downfall of many other family sitcoms:  Adding a new family member to the existing onscreen family.  But, the birth of Andrew Keaton is only one of the highlights of this exceptional season.

""Here We Go Again"" finds Elyse home with only Skippy Handleman around with which to share the news of a surprise pregnancy.  Much of the humor and poignancy of this episode comes as Steven and the other family members eventually discover the news.  Gary David Goldberg and his creative staff wisely make this storyline a season-long arc.  In one episode called ""Oh, Donna,"" Alex trips into a sticky situation, developing feelings in an emotionally complicated anticipatory crush on a young unwed Lamaze classmate of his parents.  The birth of Andrew 'Andy' Keaton happens in the two-part classic ""Birth of A Keaton,"" especially noteworthy for the humor of Elyse's off-key singing as she goes into labor on public television.

Other shows display creative confidence and versatility.  One of my favorites among this lot is ""Philadelphia Story,"" in which a sick and exhausted Alex falls asleep doing a history assignment and dreams he is in 1776, as the American Declaration of Independence from England is being written.  A great comedic episode from Season Three is ""Help Wanted,"" co-starring Geena Davis as an inept but likable housekeeper.

The two-part season finale ""Remembrance of Things Past"" is a series classic.  It is decidedly dramatic, as Steven's father dies and the Keaton Family goes to Buffalo, New York to settle affairs.  It successfully captures a realistic family generational tone, and is the first show to feature Steven's brother Robert 'Rob' Keaton.

The third season of ""Family Ties"" successfully interweaves a dramatic tone with its expert comedy, all while making room for a fourth Keaton child.  It is absolutely a classic season for the series.",1285459200,3,1960,5.135646687697161
3246572,5,B000Y7U9AK,"I forgot how good this series was.

This is not just a series of loosely connected jokes. There is a story being told.

The Keaton family all love each other, in spite of Alex always insulting his sister. There is a lot of subtle, excellent, acting. The sister Mallory is a poor student, though she tries. Alex is a quicker wit. When Alex insults his sister, Mallory, and the script does not give the actress another line, most actresses would do nothing. However, Justine Bateman is great in this roll, because she does not just do nothing, she responds with a blank look that also says, ""I am trying to think of a comeback, thinking, I cannot come up with one, I am a bit hurt, I am exasperated"", at which point Mallory storms out of the room. These great responses really embellished Alex's insults.

Little sister, Jennifer, always has a clever line. Such as when Alex gets in trouble and brings his little sister along for sympathy. Jennifer realizes this, and asks Alex, ""Do you want me to limp?""

The parents are former hippies, but their son Alex, in sharp contrast, is a preppie, businessman. Skippy is the neighbor boy, who loves Mallory, but Mallory is not interested. All the actors are excellent. Clever scripts. All the seasons are good.",1259366400,5,1251,4.647058823529412

8231013,5,B000Y7U9AK,"""Family Ties"" got better in the third season after the first two seasons. Meredith Baxter Birney was pregnant in real-life with twins during this season. The writers wrote in her pregnancy which added to the series in itself. Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter Birney were terrific and believable in making Steven and Elyse Keaton likable and relatable.

The four discs include all 24 episodes with plenty of notable guest stars like Beverly Archer, Earl Boen, Jeff Cohen, Doris Belack, Geena Davis, Anne Ramsay, Marsha Warfield, Timothy Busfield and more. The episodes were always well-written and acted by a superb cast. Michael J. Fox played Alex P. Keaton to Emmy wins. Justine Bateman did a fabulous job as lovable, vain and fashion conscious Mallory. Tina Yothers was terrific and coming into her own in the role of 9 year old Jennifer. Marc Price appeared frequently this season.

Disc One includes the episodes ""The Gambler"" where Elyse goes gambling crazy on a family/business trip to Atlantic City. The second episode, ""Here We Go Again,"" announces the pregnancy. The third episode, ""Little Man on Campus,"" is about Alex starting college. The fourth episode, ""Love Thy Neighbor,"" is about sibling rivalry and jealousy between Jennifer and Mallory. The fifth episode, ""Keaton 'N Son,"" is about Alex working with Steven at the PBS station in Columbus, Ohio. The final sixth episode on the first disc is entitled ""Fabric Smart"" with Doris Belack as Mallory's boss.

Disco Two includes the episodes ""Hot Line Fever"" where Alex works on a college suicide hotline. The second episode, ""4 RMS OCN VU,"" is perhaps the best episode where the Keaton children and Skippy run the house like a hotel for guests for the homecoming game. The guests in this episode include Earl Boen and Beverly Archer as a couple with their son played by Jeff Cohen (""Goonies"" Chunk) and daughter. The third episode, ""Best Man,"" has Timothy Busfield playing Alex's best friend who gets married. The fourth episode, ""Lost Weekend,"" is about the parents trying to reconnecting with their children. The fifth episode, ""Don't Kiss Me, I'm Only The Messenger,"" was about Skippy's crush, Jane, only having eyes for Alex. The final episode on this disc is entitled ""Help Wanted,"" with guest stars, Anne Ramsay (""Goonies"" Mama Fratelli) and Geena Davis. Ironically, Ramsay and Davis would later compete for an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress with Ramsay for ""Throw Mama from the Train"" and Davis winning the award for ""The Accidental Tourist.""

The third disc has six episodes too. The first episode is entitled ""Karen II, Alex 0,"" where Geena Davis' incompetent Karen agrees to be Alex's date for an important fraternity event. The second episode is entitled ""Oh Donna"" about Alex having a crush on a single unwed mother, Donna. David Paymer played an obnoxious father to be, Larry, and reprises the role again later in the season. Justine Bateman shines in the third episode, ""Auntie Up,"" when her beloved Aunt Trudy died suddenly. The fourth episode, ""The Philadelphia Story,"" with Alex dreaming about the Declaration of Independence with his father playing Thomas Jefferson. The last two episodes is entitled ""Birth of A Keaton"" where the newest Keaton arrives while Elyse is singing for pledge week. It was a memorable birth and event well done for the series.

The fourth disc also featured six episodes. ""Cry Baby"" is about the family adjusting to the new baby while Jennifer is having trouble with her role in the family. The second episode, ""Don't Know Much About History,"" is when Alex and James run a tutoring center and fight over a girl. The third episode is entitled ""Bringing Up Baby"" with Steven and Elyse trying to get some quality time together. The fourth episode, ""Cold Storage,"" has Steven, Elyse, Alex, Jennifer and Baby Andrew away at a Lamaze reunion while Skippy and Mallory are trapped in to the basement. The final two episodes, ""Remembrance of Things Past,"" should have been an Emmy win for Michael Gross in his role as Steven who returns home to Buffalo, New York to .

There is also a gag reel on the fourth disc. The Keatons were one of the best television families. Steven and Elyse Keaton were hippies from the sixties with a Republican son, Alex; fashion and boy crazy Mallory; athletic Jennifer and baby Andrew.",1514592000,,4337,4.983425414364641
