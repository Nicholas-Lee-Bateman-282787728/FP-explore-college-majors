I've watched these at least twice each now. This is a well planned curriculum with lots of footage with very thorough, clearly explained technique.",1362700800,,306,4.293103448275862
8479834,5,B005MVF0JI,"I received my dvd's (all three vol's) about two weeks ago and I must congratulate Brian Johnson on a job well done. They say you can't learn anything from watching a dvd, or a video, well Brian puts that myth to bed. Watching his dvd is like being in one of his classes. He fully explains each move and shows why it works. I've already learned top control, mount to back, and closed guard by watching the dvd and working out with a partner. I have done other martial arts but wanted to learn more about BJJ and the ground game and while no dvd can take the place of one on one with a qualified instructor this is a great start into the art.
  There are plenty of reps of Brian's students doing the techniques both male and female (for the women out there that think BJJ is just for men) which shows its about leverage not always size. Working with a partner and doing the techniques is also a great physical workout. You will lose weight and get in shape. The warm up exercises on the dvd will really work your abs and get you use to rolling on the mat. For someone who knew nothing about ground fighting I feel more confident with each workout and I'm only on vol. 1. Once again Brian is to be commended for taking the time to make these dvd's and sharing the art of BJJ.",1317772800,,1272,4.187755102040816
8479835,5,B005MVF0JI,"Are you just starting out in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ)?  Are you an instructor looking to integrate BJJ into your current school and/or curriculum?  Tired of instructional DVD's that are not more then a repository of techniques?  Tired of no one explaining the fundamental positions, controls, tactics, and strategies of the art?  Look no further then Brian ([...]) Johnson's groundbreaking series on his Basic 12 Curriculum that is used every day in his academy for the past 10 years!

For those who are unaware, Brian has structured his curriculum into 12 fundamental positions, with two lessons each position. This is a unique approach in the BJJ world where often instructors have no set curriculum which can lead to frustration and confusion for beginners and fellow teachers alike.

In this first volume (of a three volume series) Brian covers the following key fundamental positions:
-Top Control
-Mount To Back
-Closed Guard
-Pass To Mount

Do not be mistaken, these are not meant to be comprehensive tutorials on each given position, but rather serve to introduce the beginning student to the fundamentals of each position, and transition. Of course submissions are included but they are not the focus of the instructional. Rather the focus is on how to gain and MAINTAIN a dominant position!

The brilliance of this DVD is in the teaching formula Brian lays out not only for the student, but also for the teacher of BJJ. Every lesson is done three times showing different angles with clear concise explanations of each movement and position. Instructors will find the teaching guidelines invaluable, as how to teach is a rarely addressed topic in all martial arts.

The DVD is capped off with a warm introduction by Rigan Machado, and some fight footage of Brian using these sound fundamentals to win such prestigious events as Grapplers Quest (3x Black Belt Champ) / 09 World No Gi
 BB Champ / 08 Silver World No Gi!

You see most instructional's focus on showing a bevy of techniques, or high flying - low percentage submissions, sweeps etc.  Few, if any, actually lay out a teaching curriculum and lesson plan.  Enter the protege of John Will (known in most circles as ""The coaches, coach.""), Brian Johnson and his curriculum that has been refined at the NW Jiu Jitsu Academy over the past 10 years.  Taught on a constantly rotating basis the Basic 12 Curriculum gives the beginner a complete overview of the various positions, strategies, and tactics of BJJ.  These lessons are not meant to be cache's of techniques, but rather to allow the beginner to absorb a handful of variable situations he or she will find themselves in during sparring.
