8528638,5,B008KCGESM,"Frank Woodley has brought us a fine comedy full of warmth, humour and outrageous slapstick as a loser father whose surreal and chaotic behaviour has driven away his wife, though his seven-year-old daughter is remarkably tolerant of his outlandishness. The running theme of series one is Frank's divorce from Em, his struggle to recapture her love from his rival Greg, and the general farce that is his life as he tries to balance a succession of jobs while being a good father to his daughter Ollie.

The best way I can describe Woodley is the silent film genius of Charlie Chaplin, the interesting set-ups of Mr Bean, and the surreal humour of British comedian Milton Jones (I highly recommend finding his radio comedies). Yes, lots of miming, but Frank does talk.

As for the DVD itself, it didn't play in my region 1 player, but it did in my region 2 player. The back cover says it's region 4, PAL, with Closed Captions but no subtitles. I'm not sure if my region 1 player rejected it because of the PAL encoding, considering it played just fine in my other player (which I use for UK DVDs). There are subtitles, but I'm not sure about CC since that player does not support it.

There are 8 episodes, running about 208 minutes, with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and Dolby Digital 2.0 audio. There are trailers at the start, which you can skip, promoting, amongst other things, Shaun the Sheep and Outnumbered, which leads me to conclude that this series is aimed at families with young children. Sensitive viewers should be warned that although this series is excellent viewing with many scenes ideal for younger audiences, there can be some dark themes, including death and attempted suicide, and a couple of scenes with bare buttocks (one's innocent enough, but I'm still not sure about the other).
