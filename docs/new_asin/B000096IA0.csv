My college friends and I would run to the Picture Show every time a new ""Mondo"" came out. The soul purpose was to see a girls boobies. It didn't matter whether they were long shots from the beach, African girls with the bodies disfigured, Oriental girls swimming, diving and rowing boats with no tops-- just so long as we got to see boobies. But you have to remember, the 1960's had no internet porn, no TV porn, in fact there was very few places - and certainly no movies - where you could see a girls boobies unless you went to an ""Adult"" theater. And even Adult Theaters were not in every town.

Don't get me wrong, I still like to look at a woman's boobs, but to sit through THIS movie..........I don't think so. It's just silly",1516838400,,846,4.2875

7989887,4,B000096IA0,"If you are expecting a lot of nudity and titillating scenes, you will be disappointed.  There is nudity but of the National Geographic kind.  This is a 1960's view of women in different cultures throughout the world and since this was made before the ubiquitous invasion of television and the Internet, which has homogenized the world, it is quite interesting.  Such a film would be much more difficult to make today because the differences between East and West, North and South has disappeared so much.",1341446400,13,504,4.905882352941177
7989888,3,B000096IA0,"Jacopetti and Prosperi came back a year later with Women of the world a ""mondo"" film that attempted to show the bizarre rites and rituals of the female of the species. This film is essentially compiled extra footage taken from Mondo Cane.

Like Mondo Cane this film looks better than it has in many years. Blue Underground has done a great job on this restoration. This is also a film of purely historical interest so not much really needs to be said concerning its content. The materail is bizarre but quite tame by today's standards.

The dic features trailers for the film and is presented in its original Italian or English soundtracks. Of some interest is the witty commentary by Peter Ustinov that accompanies the film which was written by Jacopetti.

Worth seeing if you have an interest but better as a rental than as a purchase",1340668800,5,836,4.673469387755102
