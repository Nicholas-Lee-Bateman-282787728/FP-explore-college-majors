8764987,1,B01HD2T8IW,"I first saw the Documentary on PBS and was so impressed that I ordered it from AMAZON.  Unfortunately, I discovered the DVD cannot be played on my DVD player nor any player mfg. in USA as the DVD is manufactured in Austraia under a format that is not compatible with my standard Western DVD player.  I would appreciate it if you would send me a copy of the DVD compatible with my DVD player.
Thank you. Jim Chambers",1505952000,,415,4.3076923076923075
