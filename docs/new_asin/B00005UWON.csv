1669141,4,B00005UWON,"I saw this movie on TV (out of Toronto) a number of years ago and enjoyed it then. However, in fairness, I did have a certain attachment to it as it was made in my school yard. Unfortunately I live in Canada and am in Region 1 and therefore I wouldn't be able to play it in it's present format. If anyone has an answer to my problem please let me know,
Thank you.",1285632000,,363,3.918918918918919
1669142,5,B00005UWON,"This is a film made to show the human face behind the German blitz of London during WWII. The acting is simple because it is about real people. At times it is funny but it always maintains the serious element of the continual striving for humanity during conditions of harsh adversity. The tale revolves around the volunteer firefighters, their training, albeit short, and what they encounter night after night. The film quickly instills a familiarity with the viewer who feels the full impact of seeing a thriving street with children playing and the normal course of daily events taking place and then the feeling of loss as the building that once was, a home for the family of three generations is all but rubble and fire. It is a film of the people and the firefighters and the coming to terms with 'what is' and 'what could be' and then finally 'what is lost'. A piece of history captured on film with fine acting, fine storyline and fine directing, I only hope there is the good sense to release this minor gem on DVD.",1267228800,5,1024,4.570652173913044

1669165,4,B00005UWON,I enjoyed it having never seen this movie  before. Very well done with good acting. Was not over done.,1438300800,,102,4.368421052631579
1669166,3,B00005UWON,"Good try to bring to life a very seldom-told story....that of the fire brigades who fought against the Blitz.  Pretty simple plot, decent but not great acting, and the effects are good for the 1940's, but we've become spoiled with CG.  Not a bad way to spend an hour or so...but only if you've got not a lot else to do.",1435968000,,319,4.213114754098361
1669167,4,B00005UWON,"Excellent WW2 British Homefront flick, humorous but hits all the real life experiences.",1431993600,,87,5.769230769230769
1669168,1,B00005UWON,"As a slice of old London it's fine but Tinder is awful. Over acting, gurning to camera and sexist back chat. A young James Mason, horrified, tethered to this runaway cart full of tripe",1431993600,,184,4.4411764705882355

1669172,3,B00005UWON,"Decent British made WWII ""stiff upper lip"" movie concerning firemen during the blitz demonstrating their loves, losses, trials and resolve.",1425945600,,139,6.0
1669193,5,B00005UWON,"A wonderfully acted and written comedy/drama.
Interesting to see James Mason before he was top billing.

Wholesome entertainment, with a WWII overtone.",1419897600,,151,5.863636363636363
1669194,4,B00005UWON,A good old movie with an interesting look at the fire fighting equipment used by the folks in London during the Battle of Britain. I was entertained.,1419724800,,149,4.555555555555555
1669195,4,B00005UWON,An old movie which reflects what the British endure during WWII.,1418256000,,64,4.909090909090909

1669198,5,B00005UWON,Excellent old time movie,1413072000,,24,5.25
1669199,4,B00005UWON,"Very entertaining movie, light hearted and whimsical.  One will need to understand and enjoy British comedy from the 1940's though to enjoy this film.",1412812800,,150,5.25
1669200,4,B00005UWON,"If you're interested in London's life during the Blitz, this movie really gives a sense of what the working class people dealt with.  I loved the plot themes--a young couple whose marriage was postponed due to war, a guy who has a racing dog who always loses, and a mother who disapproves of her son's girlfriend until the girlfriend proves her selflessness--and Tommy Trinder and James Mason along with the rest of the cast of unfamiliar British actors were comfortable and genuine in their portrayals.  Anyone who enjoys wartime films and would like some insight into how things were in the East End of London during the bombings would like this film.  It has a positive and uplifting ending, too.",1404000000,,699,4.808333333333334
1669201,3,B00005UWON,"This is a good, old fashioned English home-front movie. It's hard for the ""ME"" people to understand, but they could learn from it. For a geezer like me, it was funny in parts and nostalgic throughout. PS Billy Hartnel was later the first Doctor Who.",1394409600,4,249,4.555555555555555
1669202,3,B00005UWON,OK Brit home moral boost film. Acting OK for the period. James mason in minor role. Staged fire fighting scenes good for the period.,1392422400,2,132,4.541666666666667
7955729,4,B00005UWON,Quite good WWII drama set in London with firefighters battling the Blitz,1470787200,,72,5.083333333333333
7955730,4,B00005UWON,"Interesting snapshot into the fire service during the London blitz. Not much depth to the story but watchable. Characters are loveable. Like most British movies, you know at least one of the main characters is going to die the challenge is working out who will not make it to the end.",1468454400,,284,4.588235294117647
7955731,3,B00005UWON,I enjoyed this for its picture into life during the 40's in London. On the other hand it felt like a whitewashed version of what life was like during the air war over London.,1466899200,,174,4.147058823529412
7955732,5,B00005UWON,"Loved this movie, great action and great actors!",1462147200,,48,5.125
7955733,2,B00005UWON,Did not appreciate the silly humor.,1459209600,,35,5.0
7955734,3,B00005UWON,"The film is 1 hour & 30 minutes. The first 45 minutes set the scene... and are pretty boring, but important for understanding the significance of the story's ending. The last 45 minutes had lots of action... fighting fires, rescuing people, close calls with death, etc.

Film basically shows the lives of WWII firefighters from before training, during training, day-to-day life as a fireman, and fighting fires during the blitz.",1457481600,,428,5.114285714285714
7955735,4,B00005UWON,A great peek at a time when heroes were uncomplicated.,1455580800,,54,4.5

7955737,4,B00005UWON,"Very educational.  War is Hell, and the people in England all pulled together to beat the enemy.  Thanks for putting these old movies on. People need to get the younger generation to see what it was like back in the day.",1446249600,,220,4.341463414634147
