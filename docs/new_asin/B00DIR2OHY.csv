5818801,4,B00DIR2OHY,"While its definately a extremely low budget film, Paranormal asylum is still entertaining. I thought the idea of using Typhoid Mary in a haunting story was a welcome change to the genre and would like to see a sequel. Thanx for reading.",1381276800,2,236,4.642857142857143
5818802,1,B00DIR2OHY,"Just tried to watch this.

Script - Can't say much about it. I have scene sixth graders write a better script.

Plot - only redeeming aspect. The idea was good, wasn't executed to any degree.

Filmography - Just because you can afford an expensive camera and a Mac doesn't mean you are a filmmaker. Ultimately this is what caused me to stop watching. To much usage of effects like color isolation while filming, then the computer generated effects are overdone, make no sense, and jolt you out of the movie. At first it wasw fun to laugh at the poor quality, then it became sad, then i started expecting a random sex scene like any bad porn movie... maybe that would've gotten this movie two stars.

All in all I'm just irritated that i wasted time watching this piece of trash. Thankfully it was on netflix and I didn't actually waste any money on this. Trust me, protect your wallet, if you are curious use netflix or find the worst movie you can and watch it that way. Your wallet will thank you and your friends won't laugh at you.",1380326400,,1035,4.431578947368421
5818803,5,B00DIR2OHY,"I really enjoyed Paranormal Asylum.  It was well shot, and it scared the holy heck out of my girlfriend.  I gave the DVD to my buddy at work, who also liked this movie.  The horror genre is hot right now.  And this one added an interesting twist -- one of the plot lines was historical fiction -- which I thought was really cool.",1380326400,2,329,4.174603174603175
5818804,1,B00DIR2OHY,"I am a sucker for horror- especially the supernatural. With ingredients like an abandoned mental asylum and a secretive paranormal investigation, how could any film turn out too bad to sit through? Well, you'll have to watch and see.",1380153600,2,233,5.0
5818805,5,B00DIR2OHY,"I give this movie 5 stars just for the guy having a girlfriend that could only exists in a movie. She supports him, lets him do what he wants and helps him do it, doesn't nag him about stuff, I mean holy crap this movie should have been about her instead of the ghost.

BTW if you were expecting to read a review of this movie trust me my review of ""the girlfriend"" is much more interesting than this movie.",1379980800,4,407,4.0875
5818806,1,B00DIR2OHY,"My fellow reviewers were spot-on with their assessment of this stinker... First of all, I rather enjoy the ""found footage"" genre, but this one wasn't of said genre. The concept was good, but the script and acting were terrible. Nothing made any sense. SPOILER ALERT! For example, why did the doctor commit suicide? And who assassinated the ""expert""? I'm sorry... I tend to look for the good in any movie, no matter how amateurish, but I just couldn't find any in this atrocity.",1379894400,,477,4.759036144578313
5818807,3,B00DIR2OHY,"Mark (Aaron Mathias) and Andy (Nathan Spiteri) decide to investigate a ghost named Typhoid Mary who was once a patient at a mental hospital. They appear to be conducting paranormal investigation, but also a documentary. Andy's girlfriend Michelle (Laura Gilreath) invites herself into the investigation.

The film is NOT a found footage film as most of the movie is professionally done. The first ghost appears 6 minutes into the film and there is no lack of apparitions. The acting of the three main characters was decent, but when you get past that it falls off a cliff with Grace Evans being a laugh.

The plot develops complexity with an ending that could have used a little more developing.

Worth a rental if you are at a lost for a horror film.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, near sex. No nudity. Laura Gilreath in bra/panties.",1379635200,,832,4.7972027972027975
5818808,1,B00DIR2OHY,"Painful to watch! TERRIBLE acting, poorly written, many flaws. The actors are awkward and the story goes nowhere. Waste of time!",1379548800,,128,5.142857142857143
5818809,2,B00DIR2OHY,"First sign this movie is going to be terrible... two guys go out to an old ruined home in the woods, one guy sees an old lady, the first guy  says, why are you freaking out about old ladies?  Second guy doesn't point out the fact that she doesn't exist?  lol... The writing is just that bad... and that's the very first scene, so I have my trusty popcorn and my kitty cat, but it looks like this one is going to be really bad.

I love horror films, paranormal films that take place in an asylum so I gave it a shot, I don't mind independent movies, amateur actors, if the story is really good.

I was interested in the story being told here, but the problems are many.

The script is not very well written, the scenes are poorly utilized, such as when a guy goes to see archives, he doesn't seem to find anything and the whole scene comes off as worthless, adding no depth or tension or reason to the film.

Something begins to happen but then just cuts and it's over and no one's that impressed or surprised, which makes no sense.

Poorly written characters throughout.

No one has any chemistry, the friendship, the girlfriend?  No one has any believable connection or emotion to the relationships they're supposed to be portraying... Laura Gilreath and Aaron Mathias do an alright job with the maddeningly bad script and direction.

I love when the half brother is giving Andy s*** about borrowing his boat, and then when we finally see the boat it's a pretty cheap boat with cheap plastic back yard chairs tied together.

There's some decent story twists that I enjoyed, such as Mary finding him and getting taken back to the hospital and Aaron pursuing, showing you the movie really could have been better if they had just kept the story more human and not tried to be so ""smart"" with the dialog that really hurt the film.

2/10",1379376000,2,1833,4.452095808383233
5818810,4,B00DIR2OHY,"This movie has its fair share of flaws and issues like quick editing jumping the viewer to the next scene with little understanding of what just happened previously. A couple scenes later they'll try to patch up the confusion but it really just leads to more questions till after awhile (when the ghost backs the car out of the driveway) I just started laughing because PARANORMAL ASYLUM can't be taken seriously. That said, I experienced chills (could be Shingles) and genuine fright during the film. 9 out of 10 times when the camera pans around, you're probably going to see a ghost or more accurately a WRAITH, which as we all know has an actual physical body attached to the spiritual presence.

Mark & Andy are buddies attempting to 'illegally' make a documentary about the roots and legacy of Typhoid Mary and this lonely island asylum's involvement in Mary's mysterious final years. So,that's why they never contact police or medical professionals, although Mark & Andy at one point pretend to be medical professionals. Andy's girlfriend Michelle is also involved because her mother was a psychic who used to communicate with the dead ""until one day mother just stopped and never said why"". Surprise surprise Michelle sneaks off alone under the cover of night to hold a private seance with the deceased Mrs. Mary Malone who of course finds refuge in Michelle's body. Does Michelle's demon get exercised? you'll have to watch to find out. I enjoyed the work of all actors involved and plan on purchasing this film immediately regardless of price because even with all the weird shadows and fuzzy backgrounds, I feel like I'm watching a Cult Favorite debut to the world. It's not perfect but it's good enough for me.

 I'd like to extend a sincere THANK YOU to the filmmakers involved and their decision to include ""Very Descriptive"" ENGLISH SUBTITLES. That's QUALITY.",1379116800,3,1874,4.924050632911392
8593586,1,B00DIR2OHY,Worst movie I have ever seen. Literally threw this movie in the trash after 30 minutes. Terrible. Waste of my life.,1505779200,,115,4.523809523809524
8593587,2,B00DIR2OHY,"So much could have been done with this movie. They could have showcased more of Mary as an individual like who she was,  her life before she died, rather than just a history lesson or lost spirit possessing people and living through them because that makes the whole thing comical and cliche. Also who murdered all those ppl? Why did some of them fly off the handle at random? I really liked Mark and was hoping he would be able to appease Marys spirit and set Michelle free.

Or at least we would get a summary of what happened to those 2 rather than just ending with unanswered questions. I only jumped few times. Its one of those horror movies that is neither really just supernatural  nor suspenseful..I would say its more psychological and detail oriented as you only really find out anything about the main character, Mary from paying attention to a series of dialogues from people, including from those investigating into her life and making the documentary. If you miss anything you'd have to keep pausing and rewinding which is what I spent part of the movie doing.

If you're an avid horror fan like me looking for a B movie that's going to scare the daylights out of you or stay on your mind for days this isn't it....save your $$",1473984000,,1241,4.526785714285714
