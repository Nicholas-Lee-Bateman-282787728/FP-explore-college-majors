You will be pulled into the story as betrayal and deceit enter the lives of these two characters. It is trule a must see! Subtitles were great.,1362614400,,297,4.8431372549019605
8112941,4,B000EQ5US2,"I didn't expect much from this drama but found it very entertaining and enjoyable!  All the characters were engaging and I liked the fact that the two main characters just came together gradually without a ton of ""drama"".  It left me with an uplifted spirit and a warm heart.  You can definately tell it was done several years ago but not as dated as some dramas that came out around that time.  I will probably watch this one again.",1352160000,,433,4.443037974683544
8112942,4,B000EQ5US2,"I love the three main male characters, they're really very talented in portraying their roles.  For the female lead, she's not my type to be the love-life of Jo In Sun, he's so cute.",1274659200,2,182,4.352941176470588
