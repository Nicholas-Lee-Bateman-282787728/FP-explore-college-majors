Clarification: Amazon will not allow anything lower than one star; however, this mess deserves NO STARS.

In the 1980's, an educational film company produced a 20-minute documentary about Spoon River Anthology, including excellent readings from the work and views of the actual gravestones in the Petersburg, Illinois, cemetery and of the town itself. In addition, short interview comments by Petersburg residents demonstrated the strong, lingering hard feelings natives harbor about revelations in Edgar Lee Masters' masterpiece.

Unfortunately, this DVD, which is neither thoroughly nor accurately described by Amazon, is a hollow representation of something, but it does not do right by Spoon River Anthology. It is nothing more than a few dull recitations performed on a dull set by uninspired actors doing an easy gig for a few bucks. Viewers will gain no insight from this ripoff. Skip it!  Better yet, Amazon: Drop it from your catalog!",1241654400,17,1103,6.189542483660131
