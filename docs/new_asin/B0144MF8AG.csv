8729617,5,B0144MF8AG,One of Alexei Ratmansky's best adaptions of a classic ballet. He made it fresh and contemporary. The Marinsky dancers are spectacular.,1516924800,,134,5.428571428571429

8729620,4,B0144MF8AG,"I got this ballet and several others for my young granddaughters who are in the first contact with ballet stage.  They love it.  They know the story and are enthralled by the dance.  It isn't Disney, but real people doing wonderful things.",1469491200,,239,4.642857142857143
8729621,2,B0144MF8AG,"I saw a live performance of this ballet back when it was very new and I liked it.  I liked the imaginative use of modern dress (Cinderella in leg warmers, the Godmother a bag lady and the four season being performed by men).  In fact I liked it so much that when the company bought it back to the Kennedy Center a few years later I rushed back to see it again.  Mmmmm.  A little more contemporary choreography than before and less classical.  Didn't like it nearly so much.
Then I bought this DVD and had to slog my way through it.  If you like mostly contemporary choreography with a tiny little bit of classical in there - you'll like this.  Even the costumes of the spirits are much more extreme than in previous productions.
Diana Vishneva does her best but with the choreography she has to work with, it looks like an effort.  Sorry but I had to bribe myself to get to the end.",1451260800,8,882,4.271084337349397
8729622,5,B0144MF8AG,"None of the outlets offering the latest Cinderella release list the sound options, suggesting that once again Mariinsky/Telmondis is releasing another ballet video limited to stereo - and that is exactly what they have done here.  However, with choroegraphy by Alexei Ratmansky, Diana Vishneva in the title role, Valery Gergiev on the podium, and staged in the magnificent new Mariinsky Theater, overall this is such a splendid production that it deserves pride of place in anyone's collection.

Ratmanksy first came to the attention of many ballet lovers with the dvd release of his brilliant rendition of Shostakovich's formerly banned ballet, Bolt, to be followed by his memorable update of a Soviet relic, The Flames of Paris. In Ratmansky's Cinderella there is no pumpkin turning into a golden coach, no dramatic entry for Cinderella at the Palace Ball, none of the eye-popping gimmicks of Christopher Wheeldon's version for the Dutch/San Francisco ballet companies, nor the delicious humour of David Bintley's version for the Birmingham Royal Ballet.  Instead, we are treated to 109 minutes of imaginative, exciting choreography cementing Ratmansky's position as one of today's leading choreographers.

In the title role we are treated to another outstanding performance from Diana Vishneva. Absolutely beautiful. As the Prince, Vladimir Shklyarov is a more than worthy partner.  The other soloists, without exception, are superb, the members of the Mariinsky Company faultless.

The state-of-art facilities of the new theater's enormous stage are put to good use, the lighting throughout masterful.  Contemporary, almost stark settings may disappoint some, but it would be hard to deny that Act 2 is a visual feast.  The stunning costumes and the changing backgrounds enhanced through the use of color and light are breathtaking.

Hopefully we can look forward to many more ballet releases from this impressive theater - with, however, up to date sound options!",1446336000,9,1968,5.447368421052632
