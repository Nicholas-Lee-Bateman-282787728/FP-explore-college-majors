2520075,4,B000EHSVBE,"What a joy is Boston Legal, the cast is a dream, the writing is superb. This show combines humor, drama, current events and a bit of lunacy. It's intelligent, quirky...highly entertaining and thought provoking. It is such a pleasure to see the gifted James Spader doing amazing work every week...and Candice Bergen is fantastic, as well as William Shatner.",1139875200,27,356,5.0508474576271185
2520076,4,B000EHSVBE,"I absolutely love ""Boston Legal"" but I won't feel like I'm getting the whole story until the studio releases the final season of ""The Practice.""  That's where James Spader originated the Alan Shore character and made it his own.  Spader, William Shatner, & Betty White all were nominated for Emmys that year for the characters we've come to love on ""Boston Legal."" (Spader & Shatner won). Come on, studios!  Give us the prelude to the greatest show on TV!!!!",1139788800,35,458,4.772151898734177
2520077,5,B000EHSVBE,"Finally, the 1st season of Boston Legal arrives on DVD!  This is something that my co-workers, friends, family, and I have been looking forward to for quite awhile.  Boston Legal is easily one of the best shows put together.  The acting, writing, and visual production far exceeds 99% of anything else out there... current or past.  The characters portrayed by James Spader and William Shatner are the best 1-2 combo around, and they are followed up by a tremendous supporting cast.  I only hope more people will continue following the show so that more and more seasons are signed up for and produced!",1139702400,29,602,4.805825242718447
2520078,5,B000EHSVBE,"What's so great about this show... wow, where to begin.  The acting, the scripts, the chemistry... I could go on.  The best part about 'Boston Legal' is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.  Can't wait till May 23rd.",1139616000,28,222,4.641025641025641
2520079,5,B000EHSVBE,"'Boston Legal' is one of the best shows on television.  It's witty and dramatic, and the accting is phenomenal.  William Shatner is wonderful as Denny Crane (I'd say it's his best role yet).  James Spader deserved every single emmy for his portrayal of Alan Shore.  He's a complex character, so it's worth seeing him in action again and again.  Another great thing about this series are the guest-stars, from Freddie Prinze Jr. to Betty White to Michael J. Fox (though he won't be on this DVD set).  I'm so glad a David E. Kelley series is out on DVD... it just makes it better that his best series is the first one out.",1139616000,19,620,4.442477876106195
2520080,5,B000EHSVBE,"Denny Crain. That's all that really needs to be said, but I'll add a few comments. Boston Legal is a show that everyone in my extended family just LOVES, from my 14 year old neice to my 88 year old father. It gets taped every week for those who had to miss an episode for one reason or another. The reason, I believe, is that BL talks about big ideas/issues of the day, but not with an obvious slant. Further, the show exhibits an offbeat sensibility which is refeshing and rare on network television. Finally, most of the characters (and the actors portaying them) have a lot of charm and an easy chemistry between them.",1139529600,131,621,4.408695652173913

2520225,5,B000EHSVBE,"Boston Legal Season 1 - [0594 - Mar 6 2015]

Summary:
The ""Boston Legal"" series concerns the sometimes-comic tribulations of a group of high-priced attorneys in a Boston law firm. The show is anchored by the stand out performance of James Spader and William Shatner. Although the relationships within the law firm evolve as the Season one progresses there is no one dramatic story arc that would necessitate watching all show in order - helpful if you watch these episodes in syndication.

Content:
The Season 1 package consists of 5 disks and 17 episodes originally show on the ABC Network during the period May 22, 2006 through July 24, 2006. Also included are several special features on disk 5 that I found worth watching. Oddly there are no deleted or extended scenes except for the pilot, episode 1. ""Boston Legal"" was a popular series and ran for five seasons.

Positive Comments:
This is a unique show in that it, in my opinion, successful combines gripping court procedures, some wonderfully creative comic situations, a heart felt presentation of male friendship and respect  some profound observations on some of life's most confounding mysteries. No, not all shows are outstanding but in the aggregate they are one of the most entertaining series I have ever viewed.

The Cast:
I have already praised Spader and Shatner but the supporting cast is above average - in particular Candice Bergen gives a surprising nuanced performance as a senior partner in the firm.

Negative Comments:
Each episode features multiple quick ""glamorized"" views of Boston streets and landmarks both night and day views. As a life long resident of the Boston area I would caution you not to be bamboozled by these ""picture postcard"" shots. It's an old run down city - a traffic and pedestrian nightmare - with an antiquated subway system and a confusion of streets that would flummox an Einstein.

My Opinion:
My only initial motivation to view this show was James Spader. I was so impressed with his character ""Red"" Reddington in the ""Blacklist"" my research let me to ""Boston Legal"" a show I had no prior knowledge off - what a fortitudinous find! Wonderful ensemble acting - standout performances by Spader and Shatner - sophisticated comedy of the first order and some compelling courtroom drama - all in all worth you time to watch and enjoy.",1425859200,,2335,4.926208651399491

I love James Spader and this is a younger Spader than Blacklisted. Shatner shows a side here not shown in many of his roles, a comedic quirky character who is flawed but very real, who is fighting a progressing form of memory loss - although it is not clear whether the loss is from Alzheimer's or other medical causes is also raised in this series.",1418515200,,597,4.387387387387387

I will say that the writers have a leftist bent, but they at least have one character who is conservative. The cast is entertaining to watch, with quirky dialog that is refreshing and surprising.  NOT for the kiddies....there is a good deal of skirt-chasing by the dog of the group, so that bit is rather tawdry and even sleazy.

My wife and I hit upon the Boston Legal series when it was in reruns. Don't ask me where we were but we missed it when it originally ran on TV. Why on earth didn't this series last 8 or 10 seasons is a mystery to us. We have the DVD's sitting on the cabinet next to the TV. When the usual garbage comes on we resort to the Boston Legal DVD's. and watch the next episode or two. Boston Legal is especially good if you are depressed about the news, weather, or just life in general! Both my wife and I always get a good laugh and I think we are probably in our 4th or 5th time watching the series. Of the hundreds of DVD's we own this series is the most watched and enjoyed. Usually lawyer shows are stuffy and what not! But Boston Legal is something else. My only regret is that the likes of William Shatner and others are probably too old to resurrect this series. I grew up with William Shatner's ""Star Trek"" and love that very much, but Shatner's performance in Boston Legal is out of this world and better!  And why we don't see more of James Spader is another  mystery to me. He is great!",1351814400,,1266,4.080321285140562

Clever dialogue and plot twists keep you coming back to see ""what happens next"".  Camera work is well paced (nice work from the dp), and character development and subplots are interesting to add to main story points.  Good ensemble cast, they work well together.  Nice job - thanks to all who were involved in producing Boston Legal.

One of the things I like best is the surprise turns between who likes each other and who doesn't, and how that develops both within episodes and across episodes, realistic relationship development between friends and liasons.  Believable court dramas and plot lines.  Shatner's brilliant and funny.  Excellent series.

2520392,5,B000EHSVBE,"I am a pretty big T.V. fan and i can say with a certainty that this is one of the best series i have ever seen.

The show starts off with a plethera of different characters with different views and very different personalities. Over time many of the characters roles become less important. I see in other reviews that this is something many people dislike. I can understand that point of view but disagree that it is a bad thing. The main focus of this show, aside from the poltical aspect, is the very close and very real friend ship between Denny Crane and Alan Shore. This sets Boston Legal apart from any other show out there. No show has ever captured such a true and deep friendship so well. From their friendly bickering, to their bursts of anger to the moments when they truely open up to eachother, no other T.V. relationship will make you appreciate your best friend more than this. Most T.V. Romances can't compete with the type of relationship these 2 characters have.

Aside from that, the combination of political debate and witty humor takes this show to the next level. The passion that these lawyers argue with is astounding. Alan shores closings are some of the most moving and hilarious monolouges in existance. Even when you disagree with what is being argued (which I did many times) you can't help but appreciate what is being said.

That being said, this is an excellent show for any intelligent person looking for something to help them doubt, strengthen, question and/or appreciate life and their views on life. I have never talked to a person who has watched this show and did not fall in love with it. Absolutley worth buying, you will not be disappointed.",1295740800,2,1683,4.640939597315437

The writing is phenomenal, but Bill Shatner's delivery and facial expressions are hilarious. Very, very sad when Boston Legal went off the air - and even more sad when I read it was because BL played to an older demographic that advertisers weren't interested in reaching.  So much TV is complete trash with canned laughter, inane dialogue and terrible writing.

As for the characters, Alan Shore is incredible in this series, and Denny Crain (Shatner) is funnier than words.  When my relative was explaining the show, I honestly thought it sounded like the dumbest show I could imagine.  As a long-time Law & Order fan, a comedy about wierd law cases did not sound appealing, but the characters in this show make you want to watch it over and over.  I ended up buying all of the seasons, and am now on my third time watching the show front to back.  I would highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good laugh!

2520424,3,B000EHSVBE,"I had never watched Boston Legal before buying the first season set.
Immediately, I totally enjoyed But, around mid-season, things changes (for the worse, in my opinion) and I don't understand why.

From the beginning, although clearly centered around Alan Shore (Spader) and Denny Crane (Shatner), the show dedicated a resonable amount of screen and plot time to the other characters listed as ensemble cast in the credits: Lori (Monica Potter), Tara (Rhona Mitra), Brad Chase (Mark Valley) and Sally (Lake Bell). Suddenly, around mid-season, Sally is gone. Also, Lori and Brad are practically excluded from the show, to the point of not appearing in whole episodes (or just for a few seconds). Tara survives just a bit longer because of her relationship with Shore.

Such sudden change to characters that I was beginning to like a lot seemd due to some kind of professioanl trouble in the set. (and all the girls left the show - as regulars -, with Mark Valley staying for only one more season as regular). Very strange.",1244592000,,1022,4.901734104046243

2520442,2,B000EHSVBE,"Boston Legal combines a solid ensemble cast and edgy, often hilarious dialog, but ultimately fails in an orgy of liberal masturbation fantasies.  There are two conservatives portrayed in an entire law office full of liberals.  One is ex-marine, senior associate Brad Chase played by Mark Valley who serves primarily as a chisel-faced, punching bag for super-hero, super-liberal, Alan Shore, played by James Spader.  The other is senior partner Denny Crane, an alcholic, womanizing, lawyer ex-legend, suffering from the onset of Alzheimer's disease played by William Shatner.  All other conservatives portrayed on an episodic basis as the cast lurches from trial to trial are either portrayed as Christian nut jobs or war-loving proto-facists.

Every tired, left-wing trope is trotted out and thrown in the audience's face, in an unending stream of finger pointing, raised voice, pulpit pounding preachiness, that at some point, will turn the stomach of anyone but a die-hard, drink-the-koolaid, knee jerk liberal.  It cannot be overstated how heavy handed and annoying this all becomes.  Case in point, in a Season 2 trial about a teacher seeking injunctive relief from a pair of overly protective and intrusive parents, a closing argument veers off on to a totally tangential screed about the No Child Left Behind act.

Which is too bad.  I think overall the actors do a tremendous job.  There are truly touching scenes of friendship, and truly funny scenes of human fallibility.  This series has a lot going for it.

It's too bad the political rhetoric can't be turned down from a 10 to a 6 or so.",1232236800,6,1599,5.107692307692307

2520444,1,B000EHSVBE,"We purchased this series on DVD because of all of the glowing reviews we had seen here. I gave it three stars because there can be little doubt that sometimes the acting, directing and writing are brilliant. In fact they are so brilliant we did not see the propaganda that was being transmitted so smoothly on the series. If one watches it with discernment, one will see the entire litany of the radical right wing beliefs being promulgated by the Faux News Network. To avoid giving away any spoilers I will refrain from pointing out all of the dozens of specific instances. A brief look at the plots will disclose that everything from torture to gun control to the right of a network to provide ""Infomercials"" and call them news is justified with cute plot twists and impassioned speeches given by some of the best actors in the world. We watched many shows and finally gave up in disgust when they justified torture using Attorney General Gonzales as a shining example of why all kinds of torture should be used in the name of protecting all of us.

No doubt the popularity of this program will be used by future historians as proof that America lost its way in the early part of the this century. As a student of history myself I would characterize this program as being in a league with the propaganda produced by Goebbels for Hitler and some of the propaganda produced by Hollywood for the American audience during WWII.

So if you want to use this as a teaching tool to help your students understand how subtle propaganda can be then by all means do so. Just be sure to purchase an inexpensive used copy so you can avoid enriching the ultra right wingers at Faux Network who produced this travesty.",1220400000,6,1704,4.565359477124183

Everything that DEK produces is an excellent product.  I love that he sets the show with proper Boston as his back drop.  This is an excellent show and well worth the purchase.",1217635200,,457,4.536585365853658
2520446,1,B000EHSVBE,"What started out as a good show evolved into a political forum for the far left.  In addition, characters are routinely seen drinking tumblers of scotch. The office of this law firm would be 'gold mine' for AA.",1213488000,4,210,4.526315789473684
2520447,5,B000EHSVBE,"I was initially ""turned on to"" ""Boston Legal"" around season three or four, and immediately fell in love with it.  I couldn't get enough of Alan Shore's (James Spader) biting sarcasm, borderline sexual harassment, and hilarious banter.  Furthermore, the character of Denny Crane (William Shatner) always left me curious as to his fall from grace, as Alzheimer's slowly and gradually robs him of his legal genius, replacing it with hilarious eccentricities that never cease to amuse me.  I had many questions about the show, ""How did Alan come to work in Boston?  How did Denny contract ""Mad Cow"" (as he claims)?  How did the show start?""  Season One didn't disappoint any of my expectations.

Episode one immediately throws you into the story of ""Crane, Poole, and Schmidt"" and gives you very little exposition, focusing mainly on the stories of the cases and letting you figure out the character details on your own as the relationships play out through the caseloads of the lawyers.  While this was initially frustrating, it nonetheless became highly entertaining.

Even if you've never seen the show before, I would highly recommend it.  ""Boston Legal"" is like many David E. Kelly shows in that it shows off lush parties with music, political agendas (mostly ""leftist""), and witty, back-and-forth, dialogue that is reminiscent of a funnier Aaron Sorkin.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend Season One as it is the genesis of one of the best shows on TV, has loads of great cameos (Freddie Prinze Jr., Elizabeth Mitchell (of ""Lost"" fame), and Larry Miller amongst others), and plenty of hilarious and poignant cases.",1212969600,,1622,5.06015037593985
2520448,5,B000EHSVBE,"The above quote from this amazing show is a true testament to David E. Kelley's brilliance. Now, I have not seen The Practice, Picket Fences, or Ally Mcbeal, so I am without prejudice, and I must say that I am very impressed.

James Spader, who plays Alan Shore, is the most interesting lead character in a decade, and plays the part to perfection. Alan is lonely, troubled, yet hides it with charisma and lewd comments. Spader is the perfect fit, and really brings out the best in his character. HE also has the best lines of the season (in later seasons Shatner has much better material) and says them with the confidence you would expect from such a character.

Denny Crane, played by William Shatner, is the indisputed star of the show. I don't think he quite knew it himself, but this was the role he was born to play. Even though in this season he doesn't have the large influx of funny lines, the ones he does have are made even funnier by his outrageous demeanor. The ""mad cow"" was a nice touch, and it makes for a very interesting character: a has-been lawyer who floats in and out of his prime with every new episode.

The femme trio of the season (all of which would leave quite suddenly) is composed of Sally Heap (Lake Bell), Tara Wilson (Rhona Mitra), and Lori Colson (Monica Potter). These women all want to sleep with Alan (and two do), a plot point that should have been more interesting than it was. It was almost as if Kelley said ""To heck with romance"" and made the show about Alan and Denny. This proved to be good for the show, but bad for the three unlucky actresses (who were all quite talented). Thus the three girls of season one got no real depth (expect Denise from seasons 2 and 3 seemed like a spin-off of Lori) and they never really got a backstory.

Last, but most certainly not least, is Candice Bergen, who plays founding partner Shirly Schmidt. When I received this set I was perplexed as to the nature of why one of the cover's participents was not in over half of the season. The first minute she was one screen I realized why. Bergen (agiain) is the perfect fit for the role she plays and also bounces of of Shatner amazingly well. She could be the star of the show, should Spader decide to leave, yet Kelley (in this season and others) decides not to write much for her. However, when she is on screen the show just flows, and she is a welcome member of the team.

In short (ironically) this show is the best thing on TV right now. It is socially relevent, funny, and brilliantly written. I highly recommend this amazing experience of a televsion program.",1212105600,,2594,4.429769392033543
2520449,5,B000EHSVBE,"This show is one of the all time best shows on television.  Few shows have ever made me laugh so hard.  David E. Kelley is a wonderful writer and does a great job with developing such intricate characters as Alan Shore, Denny Crane and Shirley Schmidt.  What is so strikingly funny about Alan Shore's character is his amazing one liners and his wonderfully constructed tirades.  Denny, on the other hand, just says what he thinks.  He says the things that a person would think someone would know better than to say, even if they thought them.  All I can say is, no better show out there . . .",1207958400,,592,4.385321100917431
2520450,5,B000EHSVBE,"To the reviewers who lambaste this show for it's obvious and pervasive non-realism, perhaps you have missed the point.  I am an attorney.  I have taken two bar exams and am thus all too familiar with the rules of evidence, constitutional law, civil procedure, criminal law, criminal procedure, family law, torts and contracts.  I only mention these areas because they are the only areas this show deals with (apart from an occasional mention of M & A and other corporate practices) and are consequently the areas that this show fudges severely.  Almost nothing about the way lawsuits are brought or the way they proceed is realistic in any way shape or form in this program.  Further, if Crane, Poole & Schmidt is the gargantuan law firm the viewer is led to believe it is, associate Alan Shore would not be able to pick whatever random criminal, tort or constitutional case he feels like trying.  Also, neither the partners nor any other associates would involve themselves in ANY criminal or family law matters unless in a pro bono capacity.  Going even further, no attorney in the firm, partner or otherwise would be able to continually get away with shooting people.  Oh, and while we're on the subject, partners would not be able to fondle members of the opposite sex in the office and attorneys who were sleeping with each other would probably be disciplined for discussing their relations or having sex in the office whilst others can see or hear.  It is also likely that sex dolls would be disallowed, whether or not they were made in the likeness of one of the named partners.  Since we're on the topic of unrealism, another common trait shared among real-world firms that operate on the national and international scale comparable to this make-believe firm is that the named partners are usually dead.  You may be able, from time to time find a lawyer named Foley, Larder, Arnold, Porter, Snell, Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, King, Spalding etc., but it's quite rare that this lawyer is the one who founded the firm that carries his/her namesake.  The show is set in a fake TV world.  Here's a few other shows set in a fake TV world where nothing resembles realism:
House (Hugh Laurie is really English!!)
The Cosby Show (Bill Cosby was really a comedian, not a doctor!!)
ER
Chicago Hope
Law and Order
Law and Order SVU
Law and Order CI
Law and Order XR4TI

All are (or were) hit shows.  All have very little basis in reality.  The difference between Boston Legal and the other ""legal"" dramas is Boston Legal flaunts its lack of realism.  It almost seems as if David E. Kelley is poking fun at his own work to some degree as well as the various Law and Order franchises.  True, there are many points in every episode in which the characters (most often Alan Shore) pontificate and make profound discoveries, but in the interim, the show does not take itself too seriously.  So therefore I love it, even though I know it is wrong.  I contrast the Law and Order series, which is equally unrealistic, yet does take itself all too seriously, constantly pretending that it is not pretending even though the show's version of basic rules of law is no less outlandish than Denny Crane firing off a shotgun in a courtroom.  In short, Boston Legal is good.  The actors deliver because the teleplays deliver and the insincere treatment of law and procedure can be excused by the sincere treatment of the topics as well as the laughs.  I would encourage anyone to buy this set and view it periodically (just perhaps not with your kids if they're under 16).",1204934400,5,3786,4.66015037593985

2520453,5,B000EHSVBE,"You've got to give David E Kelly credit; this series has achieved the highly improbable...

For 35 years if the name William Shatner crossed my mind, I'd instinctively picture James T Kirk and all thoughts are colored by Star Trek memories. But, as an actor if you become successful in genre stuff or soap opera's, it's a fair bet that you're almost dead in the water as far as fresh characterisation is concerned. The movie Galaxy Quest gently parodies this, although when you juxtapose Jason Nesmith and Bill Shatner this perhaps borders on brutal.

There's a price for this sort of worldwide osmosis, so even if you didn't like Star Trek, you knew who James T Kirk was. Stepping out of Kirk's shadow is a pretty tall order, look at T J Hooker, for example, ""hey, there's Kirk playing an LA cop"". Similarly, both Leonard Nimoy and the studio [Desilu, I think] traded on Mr Spock's enormous popularity, by playing a character in Mission Impossible in the late 60s; I think my young mind got confused every time he smiled...

To my knowledge it's extraordinarily rare for someone to step out of a show that permeated the national and in Star Trek's case, global consciousness to play a totally fresh and original character, but then again, William Shatner is a very fine actor.

Ladies and gentlemen, I give you: ""Denny Crane"".

So many opinions and reviews have been made of this first season, I'm not going to bother with an in depth review!

Alan has dragged Tara along with him to Crane Poole and Schmidt, Boston's best law firm, reuniting with Sally Heap while making new ""friends"" along the way, ie Brad Chase, Lori Strong and Paul Lewiston.

A solid settling in period for the first six episodes and the David E Kelly introduces his master stroke, Shirley Schmidt!

After womanising all the female staff at CPS, Alan finally gets his chance with his suffering assistant Tara, but as she soon discovers, Alan is not what she was hoping for.

However it's all about Alan Shore and Denny Crane, their warm relationship and the cases that they work on, either individually or as a team.

It's certainly not a great show like, say, the Sopranos, but it does hold its own when compared with the regular, run-of-the-mill TV fare that comes out of the  U.S.  entertainment factory.
Scripting is pretty good on the whole, even if a little too dense for the running time available. Of particular merit is the character of Alan Shore, admirably played by the superb poker-faced James Spader.  He is particularly well  counterbalanced by William Shatner, whose dominating presence is impressive, considering the relatively small part he plays in the proceedings. The women are more like talking waxworks than real characters - but then Alan Shore is quite an act to follow.

Then, with the arrival of Candice Bergen as Schmidt, it seemed that the writers choked and began planning episodes according to public interest polls. The illusion of topical depth was maintained at the expense of real edginess. The characters and dramas always seemed to end in the middle of some imaginary MPAA ethical demographic. The series writers seemed to sacrifice unease for soft-pedaled rants about the environment, the death penalty, and shallow ethical conundrums.

2520512,5,B000EHSVBE,"I had for a long time known there was this show out there, Boston Legal, and that it was supposed to be quirky and funny.  But I hesitated because A) I never much liked the little bit of The Practice that I saw, just not my cup of tea, and B)  I really was creeped out by William Shatner from the Priceline ads.

Then I saw a sort of tribute to William Shatner's character, on a VH1 special, and it was funny, so I gave the show a whirl.  ONE EPISODE (of Season 3) and I was absolutely floored.  Shatner is unbelievable -- who would have thought he has this level of finesse in him?  He is hilarious, at the same time over-the-top and yet subtle and sublime.

James Spader is another one I never really *loved* before - always thought he was fine but nothing special.  On Boston Legal?  WOW.  I can't remember a television character as complicated and well-fleshed-out as Alan Shore, nor one as well-acted.

I wanted to write a review that would encourage people who missed the first seasons to get on board now - it's not too late.  Also people who don't like courtroom shows - this show has way more to offer than just L.A. Law or The Practice or Law and Order.

This is one of those shows that makes you think the best dramatic work these days is being done on TV rather than in the movies.  And these guys put out every single week!

I also heart Rene Auberjonois, who is the only character who seems wholly real and natural (not that the other characters are flawed, but they do have extreme characteristics) and HUGE thumbs up for Bergen, whom I not only didn't like in the past, but actually quite disliked on the basis of Murphy Brown.  She is hilarious in this show with impeccable timing.  Clearly a very bright woman to carry off this character with such aplomb.

2520518,5,B000EHSVBE,"OK, for those of us who were raised in the TV age and cut our teeth on such comedies as MASH, All In The Family, and more, this show is a pleasant surprise in a time when most shows are reduced to the same old tired lines redone over and over again.  To come up with the recipe for this show, take the zaniness from MASH, the political incorrectness of All In The Family, and current zingers from The Simpsons, and you have Boston Legal.

Nothing about this show can be considered normal or regular.  And that's what makes it so funny.  It is SO over the top, so outrageous, that you just suspend belief and bust a gut laughing.  I'm not a big James Spader or William Shatner fan, but I just can't imagine any other two actors pulling off the friendship that exists between Denny Crane and Alan Shore.  They are so full of themselves that you find yourself laughing inspite of yourself.  To leaven out the mixture, you add the cool sex appeal of Candace Bergen (who somehow manages to be in every plot even when she's not around thanks to Denny & Alan's obsessions--but I'll let you laugh through that).

I am now reveling in the ability to buy DVD sets of shows I missed.  I watch them while playing on the computer in the evenings (but that's another story).

This show is wonderful.  It's well written, well acted, dramatic and funny.  I actually laugh out loud at the banter between the characters.  Yes, there are courtroom scenes, there are cases, but they're not cases that are already in the news, they're sometimes serious, sometimes funny cases that act in partner with the attorneys - they're not the main focus of the show (in my mind).

If you like House, Grey's Anatomy, Deperate Housewives, you'll like this show.  It is not another Law & Order.  It's not that serious.  I'm now purchasing Season 2 and looking forward to Season 3.  Denny Crane (I hope I spelled that right!).",1167436800,3,951,4.595238095238095

This is the first time I've ever bought a television series on DVD and I now think that it's the best thing since sliced bread.  The pilot episode is just pure gold in my opinion and while the first season is good fun, somwhere around the middle the show tended to lean on the serious side instead of it being fifty/fifty. (Comedy and drama).  However, the current season seem to be more like the pilot-so maybe the in the begining David E. Kelley struggled between writing Alley McBeal and the Practice episodes.  Either way-it's all still very brillant work.  I'm now ready to purchase season two.  I just wish that there were more episodes in a television series. Seventeen is just not enough.

I've tried my damndest to get into this show, being somewhat of a lewd male myself, but even I can't get passed the idea that for every case they take on there should be equal or greater the number of sexual harrasment suits during every single episode! That's not what makes it ""creepy"".. granted, a little sexual tension is amusing when it's portrayed by attractive actors or actresses that show a good deal of ""CHARISMA"".. the characters that Spader and Shatner play are not only visualy repulsive in their bloated forms, they also portray their characters as stuffy, Nueotic and flat out Weird.. which doesn't make it appealing when they molest a client or two, it simply makes them Creepy! You can almost imagine this is how Ted Bundy must've appealed to his contacts. In one episode they actually had Shatner and another partner played by Robert Wagner simultaneaously feeling up Jeri Ryan as she squirmed helplessly in the courtroom as a defendant (DURING A CASE) And exactly HOW in God's name is this suppose to be funny?? Especially to families that have any idea of what good taste is??? (I've read reviews were people talk about their kids ejoying it... great, you're raising future molestors - of COURSE they're interested!) Of course getting back to that scene, even though Jeri squirms for her life in the defendant's chair between two disgusting bloated old farts, she accepts the attention of Spader instead.. who always has the look on his face like he just slaughtered three co-workers, drank their blood and is trying to get the one he's talking to not to look down because he's wearing their skull as a Jock strap... How in God's name did a show get people this addicted when the leads are complete psychotics?

I will be interested to see how the show holds up, as I watch ignited Season 2, but in the Season One storytelling really is tightened, acting is impressive, and you do not find a better mixture of the drama and the comedy that anywhere work through topical editions this side of James Brooks and Trey Parker.

James Spader plays lawyer-- the Alan Shore-- who uses each tactics of bad quality he barks to write down a victory. Within he is really a good person, but he cannot be stopped for him.

Whd has thought that Guillermo Shatner would be a new role of the signature like this so many years old after Kirk? The Denny Crane is laughing, fighting to maintain on its shrewdness then its mind of pre-Alzheimers deteriorates. Sad and amused.

And Candice Bergen is great. It brings the class and the beauty to the part of Schmidt. It has most of the dignity between the characters, but she knows to get down too.

2520584,5,B000EHSVBE,"Until last month we didn't even own a TV - at least one that got reception. Basically we had a monitor for playing DVDs. The only reason I got Boston Legal was that both my husband and I are huge James Spader fans. The reason I almost passed it up, despite that, was that I didn't have a lot of respect for William Shatner's past work. Was I amazed at what I saw!

First of all, Spader, who was so excellent as an almost angelic looking villainous type, has gained some weight, lost some of that beauty and turns out to have a barely before suspected but decided flair for comedy. (He was kind of funny in Stargate but my husband almost laughed when I mentioned that Spader was doing comedy.)As attorney Alan Shore he still seems to be playing the devil - but when the facade cracks you can see the angelic still resides there. His body language is aconscious choice that makes him seem less attractive than he has been in the past - but it is the perfect stance for the character He is inhabiting. Shore as played by Spader is a multi-leveled character always capable of surprising us.

But it was Shatner who was a revelation. He can not only be funny, but also plays pathos so well he can bring tears to the eyes. As a senior partner, once among the greatest of trial lawyers and now descending into dementia, his role could have been somewhat one-dimensional in less capable hands. But even when playing his foggiest moments, there is a gleam in the eye that lets us know that there is more to Denny Crane than meets most eyes. He can go from befuddled to sharp as a tack to uproariously funny- and then let us see his fear of losing it, with barely the twitch of a facial muscle. The performance is brilliant.

And as a team, Shatner and Spader surpass brilliance. Politically opposed, they are still unlikely best friends, and the theme of friendship that flows through the episodes is one of its strongest points. There is also comedy - lots of it; intriguing legal cases (and they don't always win) as well as interesting moral dilemmas - some of which put Shore and Crane at odds for a time. Some of these can be so serious that the show hardly seems funny except in passing moments - but no matter how dark an episode gets it is also intriguing - no - riveting. And it always ends with food for thought - and usually a good smile.

The rest of the cast is equally capable. I especially like Mark Valley as Brad - he could be an unlikable, plastic Ken Doll of a character but manages to win sympathy. And who could resist Candace Bergen as Schmidt, the female senior partner there to keep everyone in line. She is gorgeous, she is very tough - but she is also humane when it is important. And she is very, very funny.

I thought I would buy the Season One DVD and treat myself to an episode a night, but the plots are so intriguing, the characters so fascinating and well drawn (and acted) and the issues raised either so poingnant or so absurd (or both) that I find that you can't watch just one.

Truly great writing and, even more astounding, truly great acting, especially by William Shatner, whom I'd always thought was a total hack, based on Star Trek (series and films).  I now put him up there with Sir Laurence Olivier and Marlon Brando.  Also outstanding is James Spader, who creates magical duo chemistry with Shatner.

I'm glad I've seen season 1, watching the characters develop and I did enjoy the shows. It added to my understanding and enjoyment of the season 2 plots. For example, now I understand Denny's 'mad cow' references, which were not explained in the shows I'd seen in season 2.

But season 2 is definitely better. Season 1 didn't really hit its stride until Candace Bergen came on board. Some of the other, earlier, characters weren't well developed and were distracting to the plots. I think the show improved when they reshuffled the cast a bit.

And I have to say that Denny Crane is a role that William Shatner was born to play. I have forgiven him for his awful TV ads and can't wait for season 3!",1151884800,4,1002,4.46448087431694

The show is hilarious!",1150848000,6,291,4.142857142857143
2520660,4,B000EHSVBE,"If you, like me, came to Boston Legal a little late in the game and started watching it during the 2005-2006 season, you'll definitely enjoy watching the show get rolling and seeing how it grew from a quirky little legal series into the engaging half-comedy, half drama it has become.

Some of the characters in the early episodes may grate--Lake Bell's character comes to mind--but by the time the partly-animated credits are gone (the fifth episode) the show is off and running. Things really hit their stride when Candice Bergen joins the cast in episode 11, ""Schmidt Happens,"" as the (until then, a mystery) third named partner of the firm. Her witty interplay with William Shatner's Denny Crane and James Spader's Alan Shore is likely a big part of their Emmy success. So are the duo's sometimes tense, sometimes funny scenes with Rene Auberjonois, whose resolute Paul Lewiston grounds the show and the firm in reality.

But Shatner and Spader are the cornerstones of the show, and this abbreviated season (only 17 episodes--the rest were rolled into season two when Grey's Anatomy took off in the old Boston Legal timeslot) shows how the writers and producers became aware of their remarkable chemistry and learned to harness it. Those already familiar with the second season will watch with knowing glee as the show-ending conversation between the two becomes a standard.

Sadly, I can only give this collection four stars out of five because the early episodes are a bit weaker than the later ones, and because the end of the season (an episode about a death penalty case in Texas) is so abrupt. The latter is a forgiveable offense--the show's producers didn't know it would have to serve as a finale--but it still results in the set leaving a weird taste in your mouth when you finish watching.

Still, a good beginning for a great series.",1150675200,5,1848,4.857142857142857

I had to wait for the next shipment, which of course didn't include those episodes. I feel like I got shafted by the store or the studio and will be far more careful in the future. I guess now I'll have to wait until the final season of ""The Practice"" to get them. If this review sounds a little angry at the situation, that's because I am.",1150675200,4,684,4.221374045801527
2520692,5,B000EHSVBE,"LOCK AND LOAD ~ Denny Crain......

Making his career in the early days of the classic, ""LA Law"" in 1987, David Kelley started as a writer for Steve Bochco, then moved on to producing.  Kelley learned a lot from Bochco, notably how much it pays to have a warped sense of humor carried into the great American landscape in the form of a television drama that's really all about comedy.  Much of the humor was delivered just through the name of the weekly offering - an example?  1991's Emmy winning - ""On the Toad Again"".  Kelley also learned how invaluable it can be to have a great ensemble cast prepared to deliver your version of insanity.

Television's darling in the late `90's and early part of the decade, Kelley scored quietyl as the creator of ""Picket Fences"" and ""Chicago Hope"" and moved on to his zenith with the quirky ""Ally McBeal"".  After Ally's success, the networks burned him out of ideas by latching on too quickly to ""The Practice"" and ""Boston Public"", two more serious shows in the Boston-based genre.  Although both shows enjoyed success, his ""Girls' Club"" and ""The Law Firm"" both died quick, deserved deaths.  ""Ally"" wrapped in 2002 as it was fading, and ""Boston Public"" eked on until 2004.  Strangely, once he was down to just one survivor, the less original ""The Practice"", on shaky legs in season 7, was renewed in a surprise move by ABC.  Thank goodness.  Because it was in Season 8 that Kelley undertook a revival of his comedic genius by introducing the larger than life characters in the dying show.

Sharon Stone took a 3 episode stint, Ed Asner and Betty White came back from Mary Tyler Moore fame,  Jill Clayburgh showed up from LA Law, Patrick Dempsey took a tour of duty, character actor James Spader showed up in mid-season....but the chemistry and quirky that Kelley wanted didn't start to happen until the faded and fading William Shatner (once a Captain, now with Priceline) came to the show, prepared to be as over the top as aging lawyer Denny Crane, as Kelley would let him.  They added James Spader back to the mix for the final two shows, and ""Boston Legal"" was born.

I didn't pay much attention to ""BL"" for the first couple of shows, and then the buzz began about the Spader/Shatner mix, and a show ostensibly about civil law began to take shape.  Kelley returned to writing, instead of just the production end, and enticed television legend Candice Bergen (5 Emmy's 2 Golden Globes) into the show at mid-year as Shirley Schmidt.

Boston Legal has wonderful chemistry.  Spader's Alan Shore may be the smarmiest lead character ever on television, but he's a great attorney.  He's also wonderfully patient with Shatner's Denny Crane, who is himself a lawsuit waiting to happen.  Both of them are allowed to let the veil slip from time to time by referring to ""this episode"" or ""next week's episode"".  There is a landmark scene in, I believe most or all of the episodes, where the two share a city vista and a cigar and the audience looks onto them from the back, enjoying the humor.  And although there are some outrageous bits in this part of the show, they are coupled with Kelley's ability to convey camaraderie and respect between the two attorneys.  Bergen gets to be the voice of reason, the only one who seems able to exercise a bit of control over the two.  Twisted and a bit vile, Alan Shore and Denny Crane are perfect with comedic timing and deadpan when they need to be.

There's a fabulous supporting cast for Legal, and each of them gets to portray both the serious and the funny side of the script, while showcasing the leads.  And what a wonderful list of guest stars grace the first season:  The Rev. Al Sharpton (yes,really!), Dana Delaney, Betty White, Chi McBride, Sharon Lawrence, Henry Gibson, Freddie Prinze, Jr and Shelley Long took turns.

Despite having its Sunday run cut short by Grey's Anatomy, being aired a couple of times on Friday night, and finally having the last 5 episodes relegated to the next season (there are only 17 in this DVD set) ""Boston Legal"" may not have outdrawn ""Desperate Housewives"" or ""Lost"", but it was arguably the best show on ABC and probably  on TV in the 2004-2005 season.  And for as long as Kelley is writing and Spader and Shatner are carousing as larger than life, it may continue that run.

Highlights of this DVD set?  I'm a big fan of the episode ""'Til We Meat Again"", where Denny and Shirley upset a law that outlaws red meat in a small town, and Alan gets into a bar brawl.  There are a couple of great feauturettes that focus on how the show and the Shore/Shatner partnership came to be, and some great outtakes from the pilot episode.

Worth the money!  A true classic.",1150588800,9,4681,4.611111111111111
2520693,4,B000EHSVBE,"Boston Legal is a very funny show about a group of lawyers, all of whom are eccentric to a slight or great degree.  What is very impressive is that in any given episode you'll find yourself laughing at the humor, while you're also thinking about some of the issues the show raises: defending guilty persons, the pharmaceutical industry, foreign policy, mad cow disease, and more.  It really manages to encompass some issues that you'd never think possible.  The cast of characters is also very impressive, from James Spader to Candice Bergen to William Shatner and their supporting cast: all make a significant contribution.

James Spader seems to be a central character who is as easy to dislike as he is to admire for his ruthless candor and sarcasm.  Watching Spader spare with the Firm's managers is the source of a lot of humor and Candice Bergen and Shatner have his weird yet entertaining sexual tension, and is fun to see how she reacts to the insanity of her firm.

I never thought I would see William Shatner outside of a spaceship chasing space-women; and when I first heard of the former Captain Kirk appearing in a show about lawyers in Boston, I thought the idea sounded preposterous.  However, Denny Crain pulls it off with flying colors.  Shatner does an excellent job as the slightly crazy senior partner, and his humor- I think in part derived from his former stereotype, is one of the shows great points.

All in all, after the first few episodes you won't be able to help yourself- Boston Legal is some great TV.",1150502400,8,1532,4.707865168539326

You will see on most episode guides that 17 episodes were shown for Season 1. However 22 episodes were actually made but only 17 aired because of the success on Grey's Anatomy when it first in America. The final 5 episodes were shown at the start of Season 2 so they just appear to be Season 2 episodes. Some of the episodes were reworked so that it looks like the new cast members were part of this. If you look carefully, the new characters in Season 2 do not actually appear on screen with the old characters of Season 1 (Monica Potter, Rhona Mitra). In fact those leftover 5 episodes were so butchered that they were merged into 4 episodes. The episode ""Race to Ipsa"" actually has never aired.

Anyway, it would have been nice to the DVD be released with either the full 22 episodes of Season 1 as intially made for television OR have the 17 episodes on the DVD with a 'bonus' 5 episodes in the special features section.

The characters are quirky and hilarious. The show takes on serious social issues, but you'll laugh your *&^% off, too!",1142121600,21,284,4.480769230769231
2520795,5,B000EHSVBE,"Some TV shows over the last few years have reached great heights in drama, comparable to what's been achieved in the world's best literature. Boston Legal is the top of the current crop.

There's a competition going on between the big media companies to attract that group of people who used to enjoy the West Wing and the Sopranos. Boston Legal catches us with bringing political debate down to the individual level at which it plays. It brings a new type of drama especially in the relationship between Crane and Shore. The talent of its actor pool is of such quality that the script can rely on their non verbal skills to make the critical points. Despite their extravagance and eccentricity these are solid and very convincing human characters, they shine through their flaws so much more than through traditional polish perfection.

Boston Legal has set a whole new standard in television excellence. Whatever comes next has to exceed Boston Legal, has to take all this forward. We live in this absurd, dangerous and crazy world in which our fate in progress has been undermined, but not when it comes to literature, drama and art. If there's anyone left alive a thousand years from now they will sit down for a showing of Boston Legal and enjoy it as the Cicero and Vergil of our times.

Think I'm too ""laud""? You might not have watched this show.",1141344000,37,1353,4.70042194092827
2520796,5,B000EHSVBE,"The person who was bored by this series, must want a sledgehammer to him them in the face.  To watch these actors' faces as they're saying their lines, you know so much more is going on here than meets the eyes.  Last night's show, for instance, when Alan Shore is talking about his marriage and his wife and how she got to know him too well, then died and he missed that.....and Denny Crane....Denny Crane....who Alan knew would be lonely after his divorce, concocks a story to ask Denny Crane if he could stay with him awhile....well you KNEW Denny Crane....Denny Crane....knew exactly what was going on....I want to watch these shows over and over and over - and I want the second season IMMEDIATELY put on DVD - not wait a whole year!",1141257600,23,738,4.5
2520797,5,B000EHSVBE,This is a favorite show in my family.  Great sophisticated comedy (but not snooty!).  Also tackles some of the serious moral and legal issues in our society.,1141257600,14,157,4.777777777777778
2520798,5,B000EHSVBE,"This is far and away the most sophisticated, smart, and funny show on TV. All the characters are cunning, rebellious, yet intelligent. The plot revolves around modern issues that matter, yet the show presents those issues with a twist. I've learned so much from this show, the most important of which is the nonconventional way of thinking. David E. Kelley is a genious. My only gripe is that this should have been released a year ago. Now when is ""The Practice"" going to be released on DVD?",1141084800,26,491,4.655172413793103
2520799,5,B000EHSVBE,"...AND some great acting by a terrific cast --all of this is a regular part of the show on Boston Legal.

This long awaited (by me!) DVD is sure to be a treat for the many fans of this legal drama.

Kudos to all who were involved in its release.",1141084800,17,245,3.88
2520800,5,B000EHSVBE,"I'm so glad they're finally releasing this on DVD! I love Boston Legal. It's a genius show that manages to be convincingly humorous and serious at the same time. William Shatner has managed to steer himself away from his stereotypical roles in the role of Denny Crane. James Spader is brilliant as Alan Shore, who uses his powers of moral deviance for good. I'll definitely be buying this one.",1140652800,24,393,4.7101449275362315
2520801,5,B000EHSVBE,"Clever, funny, mind provoking, well written, wonderful cast.

How were we so lucky to actually get something worth watching on network tv!",1140566400,26,138,5.2727272727272725
2520802,5,B000EHSVBE,"I love this show - it's so good.  It combines humour with some seriousness and clever, clever dialogue and banter.  I've loved James Spader since I saw him in White Palace and I didn't know how well he'd move into TV but he is without a doubt, the star of the show.  Him and Denny Crane are superb.  The wit that goes back and forth is hilarious and I look forward to this each week.  I find that David E Kelley wins with everything he does.  Although he's not the writer, his shows always have great quality to them and this is no exception.  I am just disappointed that I never used to watch The Practice especially if it was anywhere near as good as this.  You must look out for a brilliant regular guest here called Leslie Jordan (who plays Bernard).  He is so amazingly funny and steals every scene he's in.
Bring on Season 2.
