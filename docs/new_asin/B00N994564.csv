6618667,4,B00N994564,"I quite like this film and its main strength is the strong creative storyline and screen writing.  It presents the Christian message in a natural, non-threatening way, as well as positive lessons about forgiveness, honesty, friendship, and being yourself.  Although it is a lower budget film, they present nice special effects to the best of their ability.  There is no swearing or vulgarity, and it is good for the whole family.  Although I think it will be of most interest to girls about 9-13 years of age, I am in my mid-50's and loved it.  I feel the dialogue is quite natural to real-life situations and that the acting is good, particularly by the two main actors.  If I had to pick one word to describe this film, I would say ""creative"".  I would recommend it and hope to see more films by this production company.",1443657600,4,822,4.589041095890411

6618675,1,B00N994564,"story line was ok. I would have liked to see more about them getting saved, though I appreciated the forgiveness aspect. Acting is awful, even for low budget movie, the most emotional scenes were often unintelligible, and distortion on the scene with Theo and Lisa where he encourages her to tell the truth. Also, it is dangerous to have a crush on anyone or to encourage 16 year olds to say I love you to someone they date, save that for later on down the road, closer to a marriage decision. Further, I  did not appreciate the scene where they romped around in paint. That's petting and should be saved for marriage! They both often flirt with each other in a sexual way throughout the movie. This teaches unhealthy boundaries before marriage. The clothing choices were also too skimpy and I would not show this to a mixed group. I think the racism topic in it was brought up tackily as well. No need for that as it did not enhance the over all story line. It seemed like an add in political agenda.",1503619200,3,1001,4.440217391304348
6618676,3,B00N994564,"I enjoyed the storyline and the teen rom-com. The scriptwriting/dialogue was
extremely poor. There is no way high school students would talk like that
or even act like that....it was just choppy and unrealistic. There was no need
to bring back the long-lost mother...that storyline was so unneccesary and
didn't add to the movie.",1503273600,2,329,5.111111111111111

8676640,1,B00N994564,"When this film came up as a recommendation based on another movie I streamed I decided to check it out. I was quite surprised to learn that there were stro Christian themes throughout the movie (including quoting bible verses) without any indiviation of such based on the listed genres and description. This was a pretty big turn off for me.

Additionally, I just found the story line to be somewhat predictable and the acting to be mediocre at best. Would not recommend.",1521936000,4,471,4.7439024390243905
