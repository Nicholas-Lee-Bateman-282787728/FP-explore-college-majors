1780376,2,B00006JDUR,"If you have read the book, back away from this DVD. I was very upset at this movie. They made Sterling into a whiny poem reciting punk, and ED into a jerk. Then they made the brother James into a user and his character almost seemed gay. I was horrified as I watched this movie. The book is based off of Sterling wanting a child and going through with a contest to have his baby. Colby visit Sterling to try and help her brother's cosmetic company. The movie has her brother entering her in the contest without her knowledge to help his none existant clothing line. In the book her brother doesn't know anything about how and why they are together until almost the end. Then Colby isn't a virgin like she is in the book, hell they don't even get married in the movie. Then he gets her pregnant and they break up. Sterling whines the ENTIRE film and I mean the ENTIRE film. I mean he goes infront of her class and recites these dumb poems, ugh. Then another character that I love, Diamond, they turned her into a whore I was completely appauled. I can't believe that Brenda Jackson let them make this film. And Where was Kyle he isn't even mentioned in this film.",1058832000,13,1162,4.334862385321101
1780377,3,B00006JDUR,"I may have liked this movie if I hadn't read the book first. It is my honest opinion that if BET wants to make these wonderful books into movies that they should at least follow the blueprint in the book. I read this book by Brenda Jackson and it is one of my favorites. The movie strayed so far from the book that only the names were the same. This is a wonderful story but to feel the full effect, you must read the book. The movie was garbage. A suggestion to BET keep publishing the books and leave the moviemaking to someone else.",1050537600,4,535,4.153846153846154
1780378,5,B00006JDUR,"Sterling Hamilton is one of Hollywood's leading action stars, and even though his films are on the violent side, the money is coming in, and thanks to his manager Ed, he is in a comfortable place.  Emotionally, however, Sterling is lacking for something or someone to belong to, due to a troublesome childhood.  Leave it to Ed to come up with the most outrageous idea:  a contest for Sterling to pick a woman to have his baby for one million dollars!  Posted on his dying website, the offers come in, and Sterling couldn't be more disturbed by the whole idea.  It's during a television commerical that James, up and coming fashion designer, check it out and trick his sister Colby to come with him to meet Sterling and sell him on being the marquee man to wear and promote his clothing line, hoping to cash in on both prizes.  Honesty and deceit play all through the feature, and what people hold dear to them is tested.  The lead characters are intriguing and are able to hold their own against each other, especially as the final curtain rises and everyone realizes that money can buy many things, but it will never be able to pay in full an empty heart. A very good and romantic film for the cynical at heart.",1048723200,,1212,4.4818181818181815
1780379,5,B00006JDUR,"This is an example of a true love story between a handsome movie star and a very pretty school teacher. His name is Silver and he has everything a man could want the upscale crib, the fancy rides, and all the women he can handle. But what he really wants is a family. After follwing the advice of his manager he holds a contest offering a million dollars to the perfect woman who will have his baby. Well the high school teacher name Colby catches his eye. But of course she rejects him as being a shallow hollywood player with all his violent movies and actress girlfriends. From this point he does just about anything to capture this woman's heart. I guarantee you will fall in love with this movie. If you a big fan of romance, drama and action this is a must have for your collection. Oh, by the way the ending is just so heartwarming and special I had to shed a few tears.",1042502400,5,877,4.25748502994012

1780399,2,B00006JDUR,"I was very disappointed in the way the actual book was depicted in the movie. Sterling and Colby characters were okay, but the theme was so different from the actual book.",1363564800,,171,4.548387096774194
1780400,5,B00006JDUR,"Great movie I loved it.  Well written, very entertaining.  I recommend this movie.  I didn't know it existed but I am glad I stumbled upon this movie.",1328659200,,150,4.481481481481482
1780401,5,B00006JDUR,Tamara Taylor has such a presence.  I enjoy watching her in action.  Wouldn't have minded if the story was fleshed out a little more.  But this and the other movies from this line remind me of how BET has flashes of greatness and don't exploit that side of entertainment.,1313539200,,271,4.489795918367347
1780402,1,B00006JDUR,i wish i can give this movie negative stars because its nothing like the book. i wish we never purchased this. I hope Mrs.jackson knows that i love i mean really love her books but they did not do right by her at all one very disappointed fan,1302652800,,242,4.0625
1780403,3,B00006JDUR,This was a low budget film and it was a bit boring.  I forced myself to finish watching it because I paid for it.  It did have Choir Boy in it from the 5 Heartbeats.  If I could've I would have given it 2-1/2 stars.,1298332800,,215,3.7333333333333334
1780404,4,B00006JDUR,"Did the writers of the movie actually read the book?  The story line was so far from the book.  I would have enjoyed the movie more had I not read the book first.  The movie was worth watching and buying, however I liked the book's version of the story much better.  Brenda Jackson told a much better story.",1187740800,,307,4.241379310344827
1780405,2,B00006JDUR,"It was ok, but definitely low budget.  The acting was weak but I guess it was entertaining.  I was so disappointed when I found out this movie was supposedly based on Brenda Jackson's romance novel ""One Special Moment"".  The only thing in the movie that came close to the book was Sterling Hamilton's name.  The plot was totally weak and it really didn't have to turn out that way.  The director and screenwriters should have been required to read the book before attempting this movie. The book was perfection and would have made a much better movie than this mess being passed off as art.  My advice to BET is make sure the people you hire to do you movie aren't to lazy to do their homework. This movie is definitely not worth buying....my advice it rent it or wait for it to come on cable, cause it is truly a waste.",1122595200,2,820,4.3618421052631575
1780406,5,B00006JDUR,"I'd enjoy this movie so well more than the book(which I haven't read or bought yet but I'ma still get ASAP). Yeah Sterling Hamilton (Kirk Taylor) did a very great job on this one, I did he should earn the credit 4 this one. And 'specially Colby Wingate (Tamara Taylor) she was more hot, smooth, sexy and very genuine. Maybe this shoulda won a Academy Award on that day. This movie is telling all the basics what's going on in our community like he had a talent or gift for money, clothes, music, books or whatever, we know God has the ability to give what we want in life. And for the rest of the cast that did it well, i.e. Obba Babatunde, Tavis Smiley (once did a special appearance on this movie), Tico Wells, Michelle Griffin, Shanice Wilson, etc. Every movie fan should have this if they're use to real movies I like. This movie is 'bout this young cat who is a blockbuster action star who craves to fall into a relationship with a brother's sister who wants to be apart of his company along with her brother who is doing the clothing line. Meaning he's making the right explanation or choice to prove it. Right after, he decides that he wasn't making the right decision, so he fired his manager 'cuz it's been bragging him 2 long at the end of the movie y'know. This is definitely a must-see movie. If ya'll aren't watching should check new movies which I'd see are real. For example, So Real, Play'd: A Hip-Hop Story (feat. the late Merlin Santana, R.I.P.), Livin' Large, Nikita Blues, One Week, Alfie (w/ Michael Caine in it), Double Platinum, The Wiz, 30 Years to Life, Motives, etc.

C'mon you gotta love this man. It'll take u far.",1105228800,5,1642,4.437086092715232

7970253,5,B00006JDUR,"Excellent movie. The pace was great for me. Just fast enough to keep you interested. Great love story, good acting. There was a little something for everyone in this movie. Not too... mushy or soft. However an affinity for romantic movies laced with drama will help you truly appreciate it. The story line has new twist on boy meets girl and they fall madly in love. It is a really a good movie and worthy of the ranking I am giving it.",1446508800,3,436,4.329268292682927
