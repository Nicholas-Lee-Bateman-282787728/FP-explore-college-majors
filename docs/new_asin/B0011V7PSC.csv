3069043,3,B0011V7PSC,"In The Valley of Elah is a rahter good effort but there are some things about it that seem rather flawed and dragged. Tommy Lee Jones takes about 20 seconds in the film to walk over from a field to a car, the scenes are predictable, the film lacks action being a true story, fathers and mothers are more likely to like it. I couldn't help but feel that many scenes in the ""film"" were repeated. I understand it was based on a true story, I don't think it's the editing which was lacking, I just felt the impact of the film, overall, was quite measly.

Let me mention that Charlize Theron is very beautiful. Of course, she is miscast yet she's definitely the film's strongest point. Her character is that of a single mother ,her way of fighting ""wrong"" is by stating what's right and never raising her voice. Some scenes were well depicted because they were believable but the scenes featuring the American flag were done over the top. In a way, very film and rather incongruent to the story's issue at hands.

There are no bad guys in the film for you to dislike. Susan Sarandon appears in the first scene and I was a bit delighted to see her but she hardly has any role except the one scene where you might see her howl. I'm not sure if it's just me who took notice but isn't Theron a bit too beautiful to be interested in being a detective, she looks remarkably easy and settled in the film yet real.

The end is a bit strange but you might just be too yawned by then.
Strengths : Charlize Theron, a sturdy character represented by Tommy Lee Jones

Weaknesses : Not meant for all audiences, direction tried to play it a bit too much by the book, some scenes irritating you because characters seldom display anger

Remarks : If you liked United 93, you will like this. If you're looking for something to make you go ""Whoa"" , it is only the last ten minutes that might do that but by then the effect will be dwindled because the film seems lackluster for a bit too long.",1202428800,15,1969,4.3108108108108105
3069044,5,B0011V7PSC,"There have been many films about the aftermath of war, but never have I seen such a brutally honest and shocking depiction of the de-humanization of soldiers back from war. This is the underlying premise of the new crime thriller from academy award winning writer/director Paul Haggis (Crash).

Hank Deerfield (played by Tommy Lee Jones) is a retired veteran and military police officer searching for his son who has gone AWOL. A detective Emily Sanders (played by Charlize Theron) becomes interested in the case and starts helping Hank outside of her job. When Hank's son's body is found, the search suddenly turns into a search for the murderer.

One of the many aspects I appreciated was that director Haggis did not turn this into a typical Hollywood crime thriller and also not turn it into a political propaganda piece against the war and President Bush. Instead he mixes the two plots together seamless and subtle, letting you decide for your self.

Tommy Lee Jones gives the best performance of his long career as he plays a quiet, emotionless war vet, but still shows tremendous amount of emotion. Just watching his face as he sits in a diner and listens to one of his retired friends tell him about plans to go visit his grandchildren is heartbreaking. We can almost see the internal emotional struggle as he realizes he will never be able to do that. Charlize Theron does a wonderful job as the detective, and despite her small screen time Susan Surandon plays the grieving wife of Jones to perfection.

This film is such a moving masterpiece on so many levels it is simply wonderful to watch. The quiet pacing of the film building up to the climax is captivatingly intense in its own way. I am sure this will be a popular film at the Oscars this year, and if they gave out awards for best scene this would be sure to garner a nomination for a simple, poignant, yet profoundly moving scene when Frank tells the story of David and Goliath (which took place in the Valley of Elah) to the little son of detective Sanders.",1202256000,67,2029,4.659217877094972
3069045,5,B0011V7PSC,"This past weekend, we saw the first truly great movie to come out thus far on the terrible subject of the unfolding American disgrace in Iraq. ""In the Valley of Elah"" is that movie, and we strongly recommend it to all, not just for its entertainment value, which is significant, but more for its importance in displaying for all to see the horror of this ill conceived adventure in its most human terms.

The story involves Hank Deerfield, brilliantly played by Tommie Lee Jones, a retired military police investigator, whose son, Mike, has been deployed with his Army unit in Iraq. Deerfield receives the call at his Tennessee home that his son has gone AWOL from his Army barracks. Deerfield replies that this can't be so: his son is in Iraq. No, the caller informs him. The unit has returned, and Mike is gone from the base. He'd better get back ""pronto"".

Deerfield tries to raise his son on the cell phone, to no avail. He senses something wrong, and sets off to the Army base to discover what it is. On the way, a significant, though symbolic scene takes place. Deerfield observes a flag flying in front of a school. But the flag is flying upside down, a sign of distress. Deerfield investigates, only to find that the immigrant janitor was unaware of this important aspect of flag etiquette.

Arriving at the base, Deerfield finds his son is still missing. Army CID is no help. And neither are the civilian authorities. And then the mutilated corpse of his son shows up near the base. It appears that Army CID wants to suppress the case. Deerfield turns to the civilian authorities. But the authority in this small town is rather suspect, represented by Charlize Theron in a wonderfully understated role as the civilian detective.

Deerfield and the female investigator form an unlikely duo and finally solve the gruesome crime. But that is only half the story. What they discover is the depravity that the young soldiers have come to through their involvement in this brutal, absurd conflict.

A terribly important, and possibly overlooked, scene occurs at the home of the female investigator. Deerfield tucks in her young son and, eschewing ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"", tells the lad the story of David in the Valley of Elah. David, the little shepherd boy is the only one of the Israelites who can overcome his fear of the monstrous giant, Goliath. He chooses to fight both his fear and the giant. And he wins, against all odds and logic. This is the essential message of this very important film. Goliath represents the power of the modern state, what Hobbes styled as Leviathon. David represents all of us who, rather than cower in fear of this monstrosity, have the courage to take it on.

Some have styled the ending of this movie as ""over the top"". I strongly disagree with this assessment. In my view, the ending is perfectly understated, and extremely powerful. This country is, indeed, now in distress. And those who truly care need to act and act now. False ""conservatives"", like the mendacious Michael Medved hate this movie. This is so because it well illustrates the total bankruptcy of their insane policies. It is a great and terribly important movie. See it. Pick up five small, smooth stones. And have no fear!",1201996800,43,3248,4.75
3069046,5,B0011V7PSC,"The movie shows the devastation that this war causes to America. It does this with high intensity and without any cheap political shots. One might even say it manages to keep its subject out of the political area. It does not discuss the question whether the invasion ought to have been done in first place, it only shows how the role of occupiers in a civil war constellation destroys the life of the soldiers of the occupying force. Its subject is not the dead on either side, but the destruction in the souls and minds of those who survive.
The movie shows that Hollywood has not become entirely irrelevant; it is an argument against those who claim that Hollywood has nothing to add to civilization, or that its influence is only devaluing morality.
It also shows that films can be made with more than making money in mind.
And a personal lesson: if you ever receive signals of distress from your son or daughter, please listen, or you might have to regret it like T.L.Jones.",1199059200,20,979,4.6
3069047,5,B0011V7PSC,"This is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen.  I was left speechless and was overcome with emotion.  Jonathan Tucker is one of my favorite actors so I had been waiting for this movie to come out for a while, but hadn't realized it was based on a true story.  This is a movie that you can't tell people about, it is one you need to see for yourself because of how it makes you feel in the end.  You feel like you know these people.  You feel like you are a part of what is going on, like you are there with them.  It is so easily related to.  At this point in time we all know a soldier and we all worry about them.  This is a movie that shows you some of the real things that happen to soldiers and what they go through, because of this, I think the emotions people feel while watching this are real, not something Hollywood creates for us like most sad movies.",1194739200,3,873,3.9770114942528734
3069048,5,B0011V7PSC,"This is a very tough movie to watch.  It is heart wrenching, frustrating, and completely devastating.

3069049,1,B0011V7PSC,"Tommy Lee Jones is way, way past his prime and probably should consider retirement.  I'm not saying it's his age as much as I am so sick of seeing this no talent bore play the same dull character in film after film. Save your time and money and skip this and most anything Hollywood or Jones does these days.",1189814400,6,308,4.220338983050848
3069050,4,B0011V7PSC,"Released in 2007 and directed & written by Paul Haggis, In the Valley of Elah is a crime drama/mystery inspired by the real-life case of Richard T. Davis. The story revolves around an elderly Tennessee couple (Tommy Lee Jones & Susan Sarandon) who get word that their son has gone missing from his base in New Mexico shortly after his return from Iraq. A retired military investigator, Hank Deerfield (Jones) goes to the base to find out the awful truth. Charlize Theron plays the civilian detective near the base who tries to help Hank while Jason Patric plays the Army counterpart. Josh Brolin is on hand as the town police chief.

This is a slow-burn mystery highlighted by great acting by the principals, especially Jones, and a thoroughly realistic story, which isn't surprising seeing as how its based on true events. Speaking of which, I was surprised to find out that the basic details of the story are all accurate. The actual events took place in the Fort Benning area of Georgia rather than the fictitious Fort Rudd, NM.

The movies not anti-Iraq War, but rather anti-PTSD; it merely reveals the awful truth about war in general: When we send our young men off to far-off lands where brutal warfare is normal they can bring that desensitized mentality back with them where the barbaric behavior that might be acceptable in war is anything but normal or conducive to a successful life, to say the least. Add the idiocy of alcohol abuse to the mix of PTSD and the results almost certainly WONT be good.

The title refers to the valley where David, as a teen, fought and defeated the utterly intimidating Goliath from 1 Samuel 17.

ADDITIONAL ACTORS: James Franco, Wes Chatham, Jake McLaughlin, Mehcad Brooks and Roman Arabia play soldiers who knew Deerfields son while Frances Fisher has a curious cameo (youll know what I mean).

The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in Whiteville, Tennessee, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, with Morocco substituting for Iraq.

3069059,1,B0011V7PSC,"I watched this film since it featured Tommy Lee Jones.  It started to quickly become a political progressive hit job.  As the father of someone currently serving in combat operations, and as a chaplain that ministers to veterans, this film is appalling in its betrayal of those serving overseas and the role of volunteer citizen soldiers.  In an attempt to portray the main character as a Bible thumping, overly macho, wacko Vietnam vet,  Jones refers to ancient Israel as 'Palestine"", a term that was never used historically.  From there, the John Kerryish narrative of U.S. military torturing Iraqis and returning home as psychotic, drunken, heroin smoking wife killers unfolds.  As the Vietnam vet with his own ghosts realizes that all of the television spots of G.W. Bush constantly in the background have created a generation of murderous American zombies that must be kept on base, he is last seen flying the American flag sent home by his son and used on missions upside down.  This film is a giant middle finger to all of those who have served and their loved ones.  As someone that possesses a flag sent to me by my own son from missions in Afghanistan, and has seen the deaths of our military spike due to inept leadership, ROE that are suicidal and the return of actual psychopaths from GITMO to the battlefield, this film should be boycotted.",1470268800,,1354,4.806034482758621

3069063,3,B0011V7PSC,"I rented this movie after the strong recommendation a good friend, a retired Colonel; I was sorely confused and disappointed. It became obvious that no military consultants were used in the making of  ""In the Valley of Elah"". When you hire a cast such as Jones, Sarandon and Charlize Theron, it would be wise to put them in a vehicle with power. This movie started out slow, which sometimes proceeds a powerful and engrossing climax and conclusion, not so in this movie. It became obvious almost immediately that the film had an anti-military, soldiers are all one step from climbing a tower with a rifle nuts, message with no basis in reality only one based on prejudice and misinformation. The first sign was: ""Sir""; you do not call an NCO sir and you damn sure don't salute a civilian one.
Tommy Lee Jones' performance was good, although one dimensional, Susan Sarandon's part was so thin that any actor could have pulled it off. The only redeeming aspect of the whole film was Charlize Theron's amazing ability to morph into a complex character seamlessly, although even that was formulaic and poorly written.
It seems to me that this movie had a message, the military and our boy's are drug fueled, stripper chasing, psychopathic torturers who once back in America are time bombs waiting to explode. Even the good old boy abuse of a pretty woman in a man's world is so much of  ""A Priori Argument"" as to be juvenile. Poor movie, stereotypical, preconceived, prejudiced, confusing and transparent.
As former military, I am insulted and saddened by this poor attempt at further misleading the public as to our dedication to protecting our citizens.",1468540800,,1651,4.851063829787234
3069064,5,B0011V7PSC,"This grim and superbly casted film reminds its viewer that war isn't over when the boys come home. Too often, it gets inside the boys and lurches on in quiet, painful and sometimes devastating directions.

Yet Tommy Lee Jones and Charlize Theron have not lent their formidable gifts to a monotone anti-war flick. The film's focus does not ascend to the larger question of the war in Iraq and its justification or the absence thereof. The lens is far more personal than that. A gritty man's son has been inexplicably murdered. The film opens with the deep irony that Jones' Hank Deerfield knew where his son was when he was in far-away Iraq, but the boy goes missing immediately upon his return to the US.

Susan Sarandon's Joan Deerfield appears relatively briefly, but long enough for her powerful presence to communicate a mother's calamitous grief in spades.

It is largely up to Jones' Deerfield and Theron's underrated Detective Emily Sanders to provide the grim grit and relentless investigative rigor that will not let things go until solved. The other characters in this drama would prefer to sweep things under the rug, let sleeping dogs lie, and otherwise not get to the awful bottom of a returned platoon that has turned in upon itself.

This is not an easy film to watch. In this reviewer's eyes, it chooses not to wave flags for or against the larger arguments of war. It simply pounds the emotional pavement relentlessly until a crime is solved and a soldier's disappearance is explained. That's not everything. But that's something.",1468540800,,1547,4.870722433460076
3069065,3,B0011V7PSC,"Good acting.  I never know to what extent the plot's creative license has been stretched when it is ""based on a true story.""

3069110,5,B0011V7PSC,"Yes, it is about the fall-out of war and some people will hate this film because they feel it is too political.  Others will love it for the same reason.  So, if you are just shopping be aware that this is an issue.  Reading the one star reviews will give you a clear sense of how others feel about it.

Here I'm just discussing the merits of the film and it rates very high in my opinion.  I had a teacher once who said that any work of art should be judged according to how well it succeeded at its own aims.  The film is based on a true incident which has been somewhat fictionalized.  Again, you can get more background information from some of the other reviews.

The story is about one man, a retired military man, whose life seems to have been built around military service.  He carries his spit and polish discipline with him, even now that he's delivering concrete at home in Tennessee.  His two sons were raised, according to his wife, in an atmosphere where they could not have not gone into service themselves.  One was killed in combat, before the film opens and at the beginning of the film we learn that, the other one has been reported AWOL.  Soon the charred and mutilated remains of his body have been found near the base where he was stationed.  The father, brilliantly played by the superb Tommy Lee Jones, goes to the base and does everything he can to discover just what happened.

While there he lifts his son's cell phone from his room and gets someone to decipher the film that the son has made in Iraq.  The contents are garbled and unclear but a horrible picture  gradually emerges as the father digs further into the crime.  Helping him, and sometimes hindering him,is a local police officer, played by Charlize Theron.  There is a certain amount of business about conflicts of jurisdiction between the civil police and the military police that occupies much of the story.

I won't tell more....only to say that the film is stunning in its revelation of how the son actually died. It has stayed with me for days.  Jones is brilliant, as I've already said.  Susan Sarandon is very good as the mother who has lost both sons to the war.  Theron is ok as the police officer.  She looks good but somehow I didn't find her convincing in the tougher aspects of her job.  Her character was pure fiction, not drawn from reality and it shows.  It seems like they wanted a  glamorous  star for audience appeal.
She's not terrible, though, and her performance doesn't detract from the power of the picture.

The point of the film is to show the transformation of the Jones character as he discovers what happened to his son. In an early scene we see him stopping to correct a janitor who has mistakenly hung an American flag upside down outside a school.  At the end, we see him return, to hang his son's own flag, and this time he hangs it deliberately upside down.  It's a stunning moment. I highly recommend the film.",1400630400,,2936,4.47457627118644

3069130,5,B0011V7PSC,"Many people try and watch ""a movie based on actual events"" like it portrays facts and the truth.  Nope, it's a movie, not a documentary.  I compare all ""movies"" to novels, and those doing the writing can take all the artistic license they want with the facts and storyboard.  Documentaries I compare to non-fiction, and the writers better get the facts straight, making clear distinctions between truth and conjecture.  ""In the Valley of Elah"" is a movie, not a documentary.

The ""actual events"" upon which the movie is based are atrocious and heartbreaking.  The same characterization occurs in the movie.  The full facts of the actual murder were never revealed by the court.  The movie wraps things up a little too quickly.  Although there is quite a bit of artistic license in the movie, it wove many of the actual facts into the plot.  That said, the characters were strong, the plot patiently revealed, and the message clear about how the inhumanity of war can change people.

Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Sarandon were the perfect decades married couple.  Tommy Lee's character and his calculating patience was powerful.  Charlize Theron, with bare makeup, was outstanding as the woman trying to make her mark in a man's world.

As a veteran, what I found refreshing was the underlying theme of the movie; the contrasting expectations of soldiers brutally adapting on the battlefield with their peaceful adaptation back into safety and security after a brief 24 hour flight home.

Rather than being comforted by learning the truth, I would think he would be ashamed of it. We can kind of understand what causes these soldiers to act the way they do after what they have seen and done, but there are lies upon lies before we learn the so-called truth.

It's a movie for C's-sake, from Hollywood - the place that makes movies for money - for C's-sake. Each and everyone of YOU adds BS to all your own stories. The bottom line is: until there's a movie written by THE DEAD from times like these - you all are just wagging tongues. I (too subjectively for some no doubt) always think of the last verses to ""Powderfinger"" by Neil Young. ""Raised my rifle to my eye, never stopped to wonder why, then I saw black, and my face splash in the sky. Just think of me as one you'd never figure could fade away so young, leaving so much left undone. Remember me to my love, I know I'll miss her."" Close enough?

Tommy Lee Jones plays that soldiers father, a retired Military Police Officer, who launches his own investigation, and he continues to be the best actor I've ever seen. Jones rightfully received an Academy Award Nomination for this role and really should have won. No matter the film, no matter if it's good or bad, Jones simply steals the show and makes it work. Charlize Theron was also terrific as the Detective who wanted to solve the case that nobody else wanted. In most things I've seen her in, I didn't like her, but here her performance actually rivals Jones's. This film is extremely well written and very methodical. If The Valley of Elah can't keep your attention and have you on the edge of seat, talking to the screen, than nothing else will.

First of all it grabs your attention and presents itself as something outside of the traditional Hollywood mold. Second, the movie is sad and depressing and leaves one feeling a little the worse for wear. Third the acting is outstanding and conveys a range of emotions that is moving and convincing. Tommy Lee Jones does a captivating job as the bereaved and anxious father, Hank Deerfield, who is initially searching for his son and then later the truth.

Charlize Theron is highly effective as police detective Emily Sanders who refuses to take no for an answer. I am amazed by her ability to look so different in different movies; I found it hard to believe she was the same person who played the part of Aeon Flux in the movie of the same name. Although Susan Sarandon's role as Joan Deerfield is limited she brings her extraordinary talent to bear in those scenes she has and powerfully conveys the distress of a mother who has lost her son.

This is not a movie for children; it is justifiably rated R and is filled with four letter words, some severed body parts, and occasional sexual nudity. I will not watch it again.",1360800000,3,1203,4.616822429906542

The film has so many layers. I've seen reviews that stated that Tommy Lee's performance was wooden and lacked emotion. To me, he was more like a man that was keeping his emotions barely at bay. He wanted to understand why his son was brutally murdered and mutilated. Sure, he could have been screaming and yelling at everyone, but never gets anyone anywhere. Most people that have served in the military knows that.

Mr. Jones is surrounded by a great cast. Charlize Theron as a cop that people think can't handle anything besides domestic disputes and lost dogs, Susan Sarandon as the mother who has lost one son already and has just lost her second son. Even Jason Patrick turns in a great performance as a representative of the JAG. All turned in above the bar performances.

The plot is based on an actual event. This brings a sense of realism to the movie. I mean, let's face, it's hard to find a character driven mystery anymore. It seems that all Hollywood wants to do it spit out movies that compete with each other as to who can create the largest explosion or highest body count. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy these as much as the next guy. But when a film like this comes along, it should be pushed and advertised with the same zeal.

Tommy Lee Jones, a retired military investigator, may have been hauling gravel for the twenty years since he took his pension, but single-handed he can still find more useful evidence in five minutes than a squad of active professionals working overtime. He is also the stereotype of the loyal ex-soldier who still lives in the military after years on civvy street. He's so bottled up that he can scarcely speak.

Charlize Theron is the courageous detective who tries to ignore the sexist boors she works with because she's the only one in the office who is willing to Seek The Truth.

Susan Sarandon does an unnecessary turn as a grieving military mother, unnecessary because the plot could proceed perfectly well without her. Stoking up the emotional fires seems to be her character's principal raison d'etre.

It's never clear what exactly brought about Mike Deerfield's gruesome murder. Because the final explanation we're offered may still be the Army's lie, we don't find out who's responsible. Like a wasp in a jar, George W. Bush drones on in the background, making press statement after press statement proclaiming steady progress in Fallujah. Subtle? Ahh, nope.

Jones plays the roles of father perfectly and draws on his own military experience to aid Theron's character as she investigates the death further. The story is interspersed with footage the son shot in Iraq on his mobile phone, which fleshes the back story out and leads to a disquieting conclusion. Jones and Theron both acted superbly and Sarandon's role was shamefully small and with a steller supporting cast, the acting was amply taken care of. The storyline was ok, it lacked a certain tension you come to expect from these detective murder type stories, but it still managed to get you second guessing and intrigued whilst you watched. I feel Jones performance in `No Country For Old Men' to be better than this, but he certainly seems to be on a roll at the moment, picking class acting roles and performing them to perfection. For a couple of hours of solid acting and a fairly good murder thriller type story, set against the timely backdrop of the US war in Iraq, you can't do mush better than this. Worth a look.

3069159,4,B0011V7PSC,"I can certainly see why this film is controversial. I personally liked it and assumed it was about a single terrible and tragic incident and was not true of every man and woman who served and serves in Iraq. There are critics of the film who think the film is saying negative messages about all the men and women who serve in Iraq, which I don't think is the case with this film. Basically the film tells the story of a career military father searching for his son and then searching for his son's killers. This poor father discovers more than he imagined about his son, the killers, and the conditions in Iraq that may make some individuals act out in a violent manner when they return to the United States. Tommy Lee Jones plays Hank Deerfield, who is a retired military police officer. He meets brick walls in his investigation of his son's disappearance. He is joined in his search by police detective Emily Sanders, played by Charlize Theron, who realizes that the pieces of the puzzle don't add up in the search for the killer or killers of this young man. She is able to obtain an inside perspective that assists Mr. Deerfield in his search. Do soldiers sometimes use drugs? Do they form strong bonds with the other young males? Do they sometimes engage in violent behavior? Do they sometimes witness violent behavior? Do they sometimes lose themselves in the group or pack mentality? The answer to all these questions is certainly. Thus the film is showing one incident where these factors come together with a tragic outcome and is not meant to be an indictment of men and women in the armed forces. I never suspected that that this was a motive for the film. The film is well acted and thought provoking. The mysteries within mysteries keep the viewer entertained and attentive to the details.",1295308800,,1803,4.6375
3069160,4,B0011V7PSC,"This film is a loose interpretation of a true story about a man searching to learn what led up to his son's mysterious death after returning from Iraq; however, its real message is far more than that.  Jones' character, Vietnam veteran Hank Deerfield, tells another character the story of David meeting Goliath in the Valley of Elah, a metaphor that runs through every facet of the film, in particular Deerfield's grief.  Indeed, who exactly is the giant Deerfield's son faced that led him to his death?  Deerfield's journey through the effects of PTSD of the newly returned soldiers provokes questions around their ability to discern right and wrong, and shows him that despite his son's earlier pleas for help and to come home, the boy's judgment and empathy was as impaired as his fellow soldiers.  As facts around the son's death are revealed, so, also, is Deerfield's legacy of guilt for pushing his son into service.

Jones and Sarandon delivered fantastic performances, with Theron a little stiff in her role. Some secondary arcs seem out of place in the greater context and don't move the plot along, though they reveal details significant to the supporting cast.  Graphic in some places, such details are no more gritty or gratuitous than the evidence of the scarred psyches of the returning soldiers.  Qualities of this film rare in so many other war films are its ability to show a range of emotion without being sentimental, to show both depravity and desperation without being maudlin, and to deliver a powerfully personal story about a Universal dilemma.",1291075200,4,1568,4.961832061068702
3069161,4,B0011V7PSC,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

The biggest surprise about ""The Valley of Elah"" is how far Paul Haggis has developed as a writer. I felt his screenplay for ""Million Dollar Baby"" was awful: a flimsy, clichd melodrama full of complete one-dimensional characters. Then there was ""Crash"" which certainly was a vast improvement over ""Baby"" but that too had many moments that were too incredible to believe as well as being generally inconsistent. But now along comes ""Elah"", a subtle, murder/detective mystery with cogent social undertones.

""Elah"" operates on two levels--there is of course the main plot of a dogged detective (very capably played by Charlize Theron) who must go up against duo bureaucracies of her own police department and the US Army in order find out who murdered the son of a veteran (a former Military policeman/investigator--Hank Deerfield) played by Tommie Lee Jones. The second level is the more subtle mystery as to what happened to Deerfield's son while he was a soldier in Iraq.

This 'subplot' in some ways proves to be just as fascinating as the solution to the actual murder of the soldier. The subplot is unraveled visually: Deerfield surreptitiously removes his son's cell phone from his room on the base and then has a local underground computer expert extract the digital video from the phone. Throughout the movie, Deerfield is trying to decipher what's going on from the distorted and shaky images captured on the cell phone.

The message of the film is clear--war (and particularly the war in Iraq) can lead to trauma and worse, damage to the psyche of the soldiers who are there to the point where they have become totally desensitized to their own feelings and emotions. To his dismay, Deerfield finds out the truth about his son--that he went from being a fairly normal young man before he went into the Army and ends up desensitized and psychically damaged along with his buddies who end up responsible for his death. Deerfield already knows that things weren't right 'over there' when it's revealed at the end of the film that he received a call from his son while he was still in Iraq, crying over something that happened. A confession by the soldier who murdered Mike Deerfield reveals that he was upset over an incident where he and a partner in a Humvee run over a child. Mike Deerfield is so riddled with guilt that he gets out of his vehicle (despite the danger of being shot by insurgents) and takes a picture of the child's corpse. But we also find out the meaning of Mike's nickname ""Doc""--that there were two sides to the traumatized soldier; one side was guilt-ridden but strong enough to take the picture of the dead Iraqi boy. But he also was a sadist who tortured a prisoner by poking him with a gun in areas on the man's body that had been wounded.

Haggis could have depicted Mike Deerfield as a complete victim of war but oftentimes life is more complex--Mike is both a victim and a victimizer. The main plot also keeps one riveted. At first, the main suspects, Mike's buddies seem to be cleared when a surveillance photo of them returning to base in their car turns up. Later, an Hispanic soldier (who has gone AWOL) is suspected and Hank Deerfield loses his objectivity and tries to beat the fleeing suspect (showing that he's not perfect also). Finally, the case is solved when the detective receives a copy of Mike Deerfield's credit card receipt which is signed by one of the soldiers he was with instead of Mike himself. The soldiers confess but the detective feels thwarted when she learns that the Army and local prosecutor have agreed to reduced sentences for the murderer and his accomplice (a third soldier commits suicide before the arrests out of guilt).

The motive for the murder is chilling--there is no real reason. Just a bunch of drunk soldiers who have no control over impulses due to being desensitized by their experiences of war in Iraq. Of course not all soldiers end up desensitized by war and we probably needed to see a few more ""well-balanced"" Army people in this film. In addition, most of the military and civilian police investigators were pretty negative characters who were determined to stonewall the investigation at every turn. That makes for good drama I suppose, but it wasn't completely realistic.

Haggis's plot was supposedly based on real events. Obviously he needed to compress the action so that the story moved along and kept the audience's interest. Again, much of the chronology of the events in the movie did not seem completely realistic. Still the story is quite gripping and Tommie Lee Jones was excellent in an understated performance. Why wasn't ""Elah"" nominated best picture? It's simple--the Academy believes in spreading out their awards to as many filmmakers as possible. Haggis already has gotten his 'awards' for Million Dollar Baby and Crash. Now it was the Coen Brothers' turn. But Valley of Elah was a superior picture.",1286841600,,4948,4.84160756501182

3069163,2,B0011V7PSC,"""In the Valley of Elah"" could have an interesting film about Iraq vets returning from battle and having a hard time adjusting. Instead it chooses to demonize Iraq vets the same way Vietnam vets were demonized in films - as aberrant, crazed and damaged by their experiences in war.

The basic story is about Michael, the soldier son of a former military policeman, who has gone missing after his recent return from a tour of duty in Iraq. Dad (Tommy Lee Jones) takes off to find the boy. A former army investigator, he uses his skills to find out what happened to his son. He finds Michael's cell phone and downloads a number of short film clips that the boy shot while in Iraq. These spin out improbably over the course of the movie, throwing out red herrings and clues about the story. The film obviously is building to a heavy and deeply meaningful climax, but when the time arrives and Tommy Lee finally figures out what happened to Michael, it's a letdown. Michael's buddies are seemingly unmoved by what has happened to him. And his fate doesn't make any sense. I guess this was intended to convey the message that war is senseless and makes people crazy. The great and fateful event that supposedly warped young Michael, and for which we had been primed for the entire film, was no more horrifying than a traffic accident.

By the way, there is more than one film's fair share of stripper clubs and topless dancing in ""The Valley of Elah."" There's even one middle-aged (to be charitable) lady serving as a topless bartender, if that sort of thing floats your boat. The film could have done without these completely unnecessary bits, as it could have with the ill-conceived and pointless allusions to the David and Goliath story. I'm no Iraq war-groupie, but the film's moral - that something is deeply wrong with America's involvement in Iraq - seems tacked on and doesn't flow from the film's narrative.",1284336000,,1910,4.681547619047619
3069164,5,B0011V7PSC,"If you have not had enough of Iraq movies like the Green Zone, the Hurt Locker, etc. and your psyche does not yet bleed enough for the poor troops we have ordered over there, this will be another straw on the camel's back.  As always the scenario is a bit empty, but the actors, especially Tommy Lee Jones, Susan Sarandon and Charlize Theron, are first class.  I think this is one of the better Iraq movies because it happens after the troops come home from their overseas tour.  I plan to see this one several more times because each time, I get something else out of it.  After the horror of Viet Nam, you would have thought we would have stayed away from any further major invasions by our foot soldiers.  I think these movies try to drive the message home, but apparently our politicians are totally out of touch with reality and suffering to care.  Next time, if you must absolutely fight, use our Nukes!",1283817600,,909,4.445783132530121
3069165,4,B0011V7PSC,"The over long Valley of Elah delivers its anti-war sermon with all the subtlety of a sledghammer.  Trust us, we get it.  War turns people into creatures their parents don't recognize.  It always has and it always will--that's what war is, and several much better movies have addressed it, like The Deer Hunter and Born on the Fourth of July.  If VOE had contented itself with being a murder mystery and character study and let us draw our own conclusions on the order of The Hurt Locker, it would have been a much more powerful film.  As it is, we're bludgeoned by both the main plot and an unnecessary subplot about an Army wife who is terrified of her husband.  Throw in an element about how the flag is flown just in case we missed things the first time around, and the message becomes borderline insulting.

Inspired by a true story as is most fiction, the gist of the plot is that Pvt. Mike Deerfield has gone AWOL shortly after returning from combat in Iraq.  His father Hank, who just happens to be an ex MP is alerted to Mike's status by a phone call from the base attempting to locate him.  Hank solves the case despite the obstacles and lack of enthusiasm he gets from the Army and the local police and some very painful information he unearths. And oh, yeah--did I tell you the Army and the local police weren't helping much?  The title comes from the Biblical location of David's epic slaying of Goliath, but I have no idea what that has to do with this story.

*Spoiler Alert*
What is given the buildup for a grand conspiracy turns out to be a squalid, pointless Saturday night crime rather easily solved.

That said, this movie is a must see for the splendid acting which makes the weak script irrelevant.  Charlize Theron is a wonderfully understated detective, Susan Sarandon is heartbreaking as Mike's mother, and Josh Brolin is a splendid good ol' boy police chief.  The standout however, is Tommy Lee Jones' exquisitely nuanced performance.  As Hank, Jones manages to balance and make believable an experienced investigator's exasperation with incompetence, a father's guilt, love and pain, and a soldier's discipline.  It's one of the most amazing things I've ever seen and thank goodness the director had enough sense to spend a lot of time on Jones' face.  At best, this movie would rate two stars for script alone, and three stars only without Jones' stunning performance.  See this movie for the acting alone.  It's worth it.",1276992000,2,2449,4.679906542056075
3069166,4,B0011V7PSC,"It's a good movie - I'd give it a 7 or 8 out of 10. It moves slow, but it does move. There's no really spectacular, stand out moment to the movie, nothing instantly memorable. And while it's about people returning from the battlefield, what they've seen and done, how they can't adjust to 'civilian' life, it doesn't really touch on any of that except briefly; it dances around the subject. There's no lecturing on any one subject, which is good, but on the other hand it doesn't seem to pay any attention to any one subject. But then, the movie does focus on the people involved, and in that it does a good job.

Tommy Lee Jones is one of those that for me are hit or miss - I like him in some things (such as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fugitive/dp/B00005ATZT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fugitive</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-I-B/dp/B00177YA1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M.I.B.</a>""), don't like him in others. He does a good job here - the role fits him. Charlize Theron... she's usually very good, and she is in this as well. She can be a chameleon, fitting into the part, but it doesn't quite feel like she fit into this - she tries damn hard, but it just misses by a hair. Plus she's just too damn good looking for the role. Susan Sarandon barely has much of a part in this, but she fits right into it - very good, very well done. Reviews, etc have mentioned Josh Brolin - probably because he's a 'name', because he has less than five minutes of screen time in this. Basic stuff, and I guess he does it well enough.

It's something that I'm glad I've seen, and that I'll probably watch again at some point. It's worth what I paid for it, and that's all that can really be said.",1273622400,,1785,4.849180327868853
3069167,5,B0011V7PSC,"i checked out The Valley of Elah and i've got to say that it was a great, sad, well acted must see film.

The film has an all-star cast with subperb acting from Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Susan Sarandon, Jason Patric, James Franco and Charlize Theron, who is amazing in this film.

The movie is based on actual events revolving the murder of Army Soldier Richard Davis.

Lee plays father Hank Deerfield, who receives a phone call from the army base that his son has gone AWOL. Hank doesn't know that his son has returned from Iraq for a brief stay and goes off to find out what happend. Once there, he finds out that the remains of his son have been found, and what begins to unravel is a story of deciet, sadness, and the loss of humanity.

Throughout the film, Hank is viewing clips of vidoes from his son's camera showing events from their combat in Iraq, including burned and chared bodies.

The film really centers around Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the overall effect it has on soldiers returning from Iraq back into their homeland. From drug use, to sudden nightmare flashes, to brief scares. The film explore the loss of humanity and the overall effects of PTSD.

It's a great film and the acting is authentic and realistic. I would recommend The Valley of Elah if you want to see a good overall film.",1272153600,,1326,4.504166666666666

3069169,5,B0011V7PSC,"With the fresh spate of suicidal bombings violating the impending election in Iraq, my viewing of Haggis's terrifying, Valley' has added resonance. Yes, so many war films have urged us to outrage, to sense the futility, the heroics, the cruelty, the power plays and their perversions. But not since, 'The Deerhunter', have the chilling consequences of violence been so devastatingly enunciated. It is no surprise that the tale has connexions to an actual event (albeit tenuously, as a lead reviewer notes. Though I don't mind that Haggis even uses the actual dad as a surrogate authority for his own film's moral integrity).We need feel the sympathy and ramifications of all the characters caught in the malestrom(though I do think the young woman found murdered in the bath is stacking the cards too high even for these dramtic ends. And the inverted flag is flawed overstatement. T L Jones, whose gritty and sullen demanour has made him the perfect messenger, this decade, for late mid-life crises roles, chases down the causes for his son's death. He will tally his own contribution in this saga, having been reminded by his wife(a nicely understated performance by Saradon). The old-boy's network is unravelling.

3069170,5,B0011V7PSC,"In the Valley of Elah tells a story that will stick in your mind long after you watch it even if you don't agree with the message of the movie. The acting is extremely well done although I do think Susan Sarandon's role could have been beefed up more; I'm one of the people who feel that she was underutilized in this film although her acting was brilliant. The plot moves along at a good pace although things speed up during the last forty-five minutes or so of the film; and that does make things more interesting. As the plot deepened, I really couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. In addition, the cinematography is excellent.

When the action starts, we meet Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones) who lives in Tennessee with his wife Joan (Susan Sarandon). Hank gets a phone call from his son's military base at Fort Rudd, New Mexico, stating that his son Mike is AWOL from the base. Hank didn't know that Mike had returned from Iraq just a few days earlier. Hank, having been in the military as an investigator for quite some while, wants to find his son Mike without bringing in the military police so that Mike can be found without getting him into too much more trouble.

When Hank travels to Fort Rudd in the Southwest, he meets police detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron) who doesn't display any interest in helping Hank find his son. After some prodding, Emily takes Hank to the place where Mike's body was found--chopped up after being burned and dragged along a field. Although there is some fighting between the army and other police officers over which agency bears the responsibility of working on the case, eventually an extensive military investigation into the crime starts with Emily trying hard to lead the crew who are working on the case. Once all this starts, there are plot twists and turns that you simply won't see coming. Many people are interviewed about the crime including Cpl. Steve Penning (Wes Chatham), Spc. Gordon Bonner (Jake McLaughlin) and Spc. Ennis Long (Mehcad Brooks). Emily and a few others think they have the killer when they corner Pvt. Robert Ortiez (Victor Wolf); but that lead turns up cold after quite a chase scene. At the same time, Hank Deerfield forms an unlikely friendship with Emily as they continue to work together to determine who killed Mike when and why.

The plot, of course, can easily go in many different directions from here. What happens when Mike's mother Joan goes to Fort Rudd to see the remains of Mike's body? How can Hank push the authorities when he himself has limited power? After all, he really can't do much more than prod Emily Sanders and the others to do what's right. Will Mike's friends Steve, Gordon and Ennis be able to provide clues to what happened to Mike? No spoilers--watch and find out! In addition, the DVD comes with some interesting outtakes.

In the Valley of Elah tells a powerful story about the degree to which people can become corrupted by war even after they have finished serving in the battlefields. It's an interesting and poignant story that could happen anywhere even though this particular film is merely based on actual events. In addition, the film brilliantly portrays an unusual type of coming-of-age story--not of a younger person but, in this case, of the young man's father, Hank Deerfield, who learns that war doesn't always produce heroes.",1252540800,,3359,4.7465753424657535
3069171,5,B0011V7PSC,"This is an excellent film which rewards repeated viewings, whatever your politics. It's not a film that's opposed to the Iraq War itself, and it never properly addresses the rights and wrongs of the conflict. Rather, it's a depiction of what can happen to the individuals involved.

It's also a film with shifting perspectives. Tommy Lee Jones' character makes a lot of good calls-- and a few bad ones, just like the people he's working with. And the soldiers are not damned by any means-- they each achieve varying degress of redemption.

The fact that a film like this can come out while the conflict is ongoing and still find an audience is a tribute to the film industry, and The United States generally. Consider the Vietnam War and look at how long it took for Hollywood to start getting into those issues.

3069172,5,B0011V7PSC,"The film does not want to demonstrate anything about any war in particular. It is just a silly ""accident"" in which three GIs back from Iraq gets to fists and blows with a fourth one on some Saturday night in the city where they are stationed. The fourth one is killed, then burned and dismembered, or vice versa, and the pieces are scattered in some open waste land. Then they go to some diner's and have fried chicken and pay under the signature (fake of course) of the dead one. The father comes and tries to find out the truth. It takes time to make up what happened and lead the three killers to confessing their crime. But that's obviously not the only interest of this particular film. The father wants to know and understand why they did that. He himself is a veteran who fought in Vietnam, whose elder son was accidentally killed in Fort Bragg and whose younger son just disappeared. And there comes the picture of a war in our modern world, an ugly war that has no justification and in which young people are thrown, innocent, virginal and dumb like silly teenagers. They are bored and frightened and they have the power of weapons and uniforms. They abuse that power and then they misuse that power only because they are frightened and they shoot first a long time before ever imagining they could have asked a question first. But in what language? Then they get bored they have to find some entertainment and killing some innocent child or torturing a wounded prisoner is funny like hell in a hell of a war. And no remorse about the prisoner and his being tortured since eventually he will be killed or forced to die in a way or another not to tell anyone. That could be called military eugenics or wartime house husbandry or cleaning up warfare. If we reduce that horror to only Iraq we will not understand some moment in the film when the father explains, for example, to a young child how David vanquished Goliath because he was able to understand that his being afraid is the very effect the bully Goliath wants to create and if one is not afraid of the bully then the bully does not know what to do and you can then take advantage of this moment to push him aside in a way or another, even only with a simple slingshot and a small stone. A big bully is used to people being afraid of him, not of people not being afraid and using miserable weapons against him. That's the Valley of Elah. That moment is not a justification of war but a complete denunciation of the use of force by the more powerful party against the weaker party which creates a lot of fear and will be answered with a lot of unpredictable unmilitary small actions that will sting and hurt even if it does not win the war, but it will create fear among the powerful, and that the powerful don't know how to cope with it.

Though the film deals with war and murder, it is surprisingly unemotional and uninvolving.  There is no tension or danger, there were too many minor characters to keep straight, and all the actors delivered their lines with such unrelenting poker-faces that it actually became tedious and boring.

While World War II was, by most people's standards, a just war against a tide of totalitarianism in Europe and Asia. Today, questions abound whether American involvmement in Iraq exhibits similar value. Now six years after our 2003 invasion and five years since the events portrayed in this film took place, an ugly side of America is shown in this movie.

The film is about a soldier returned from Iraq that goes AWOL and is later found killed. The film shows what happened and the long search for this truth by the police, military establishment, and the soldier's parents. It is played out by two of America's best actors -- Tommy Lee Jones as the ex-military investigator father of the deceased soldier, and Charlize Theron as the police investigator trying to overcome bureaucracy and roadblocks to find out what happened. Together, they put on a great show that will keep you involved for the duration. While perhaps not the greatest filmmaking, it surely succeeds as political theater.

We saw a lot of this kind of thing after Vietnam, another long conflict around the world based on spurious motives. Our enemy in Vietnam was said to be communism; in Iraq it is said to be terrorism. Vietnam spawned coming home readjustment films like ""Coming Home"", ""The Deer Hunter"" and, my favorite, ""Rolling Thunder,"" all about returning veterans making the adjustment to civilian life. In each case, the life they came back to was more complicated and less fulfilling than the one they left for one reason: the war changed them as people in ways that weren't good.

This is the fundamental message of ""In the Valley of Elah"", whose content is based on the real-life killing of one soldier. Its broader vision, however, goes way beyong that case and postulates that our involvement in Iraq, like our involvement in Vietnam, will divide, weaken and desensitize us to other's suffering -- just as Vietnam did.

I think this postulate works well -- the reason I gave this film a 5 star review -- for a very personal reason. A few days before I saw this film I had dinner with my grandson and his family. He had just returned from six months military duty in Iraq. I saw a person changed from the one I'd seen a half-year earlier. He smoked more, drank more, and swore more. He had more tattoos, also, but that's beside the point.

Even more telling were his comments about Iraq, where he was stationed in the north, Kurd country. I asked if he saw violence; yes, every week, he said. ""You don't see where it's coming from so it's hard to shoot back,"" he said. His comments aobut the nation itself turned exceedingly negative. At one point, he wondered aloud why anyone would want to live in that place. ""They should nuke it and start over,"" he said.

This is the nihilism that is exhibited in ""In the Valley of Elah."" This is a startlingly good film, exceptionally well acted in the lead roles, with a timely and absorbing story, probably based on something that really happened. Its longer-term themes, however, are deafeningly negative. I expect it's the kind of film we will see a lot of once our invovlement in Iraq is history.",1237248000,,3720,4.721109399075501

It is a film that examines some of the horrors military men and women often face.  It is a film that focuses on the suffering many families of fallen or returning soldiers often face.  The film is not for the faint of heart.

The acting by Tommy Lee Jones, Charlize Theron, Susan Sarandon and others is superb.  The direction, cinematography, editing, pacing, music, and storytelling are first rate.

The title ""In The Valley of Elah"" refers to the Biblical story of David and Goliath.  The film investigates and speculates on how our formative stories may shape our aspirations.  And the film explores how the complexities of reality often challenge us, sometimes leading us off the course and away from the ideals we originally aspired toward.",1235433600,,862,4.896551724137931
3069182,3,B0011V7PSC,"Unfortunately, Mr. Jones is about the best that can fished out of this movie.  Fortunately, Mr. Jones is a very, very good actor.  The story line, although supposed to have been told from a real incident, took so much ""artistic"" license as to make the thing a fiction.  The reader can check this out from other sources.

The viewer will come away thinking that the US Army is as loosely-run as this picture tries to show.  The viewer with any military experience would normally laugh at some of the sequences, were it not for the fact that the tale received so much fawning and raving. E.g., no soldier with any memory at all (good or bad!) of daily morning reports knows that it is darned near impossible for anyone to go missing, as in this movie -- even for a day.  Further, how on earth could even a retired veteran, portrayed by Jones, have such unfettered access to an Army base?  Free to wander here and there, talk to anyone he wished (few of whom actually seemed to have any real job), and generally go unnoticed by the universe inside the base.  True, ""it wouldn't be a movie"" without that drama.  This drama, though, fell very far inside the false and disrespectful range.

The final incredible straw was the implication, through a dialog between T.L. Jones and another Army old-timer, that the Vietnam War was a respected time, when all soldiers were serious and super-competent, etc.  Gads.  Maybe viewers under 45 will get sucked in by that monstrosity, but that was truly a gaff.

In spite of all this, do see the move for Tommy Lee Jones. This is his kind of flick: serious, non-nonsense, tell-me-straight-or-I'll-bop-ya' kind of character which we all know him for -- and somewhere between ruggedly- and ugly-handsome.

3069183,1,B0011V7PSC,"Liberals: This Baby has it all! A plot whose central organizing event is a US soldier in Iraq running his massive Army truck over an innocent Iraqi child standing helplessly in the middle of a dusty street. No, it was not exactly ""deliberate"" - he was ordered to to do it to comply with a standing Army order that no truck in a convoy under attack must stop for any reason. The memory of the child's body flopping around in the undercarriage drives the otherwise virtuous soldier to a form of drug fueled sadism/insanity which ultimately leads his murder by his fellow soldiers, also ""messed"" by the Horrible Injustice of It All. To add impact and visual interest the writers of this screenplay have the young soldier's body dismembered and then burned and there are many opportunities for quick glances at photos of the crime scene.

But wait there's more! Susan Sarandon does her nauseatingly condescending impression of a Red State mother who blames her husband (Tommie Lee Jones) for the death of her son because he idealized military service to the son! Jones resists the temptation to display his great range by playing exactly the same character he always plays, only tireder. There is even a scene where he has a depressing conversation with another burned out old man who happens to be the same actor with whom Jones had a similarly pointless scene in No Country For Old Men.

What would a movie like this be without the old Glass Ceiling theme?
So we have the tall svelte knockout (Theron) as the detective whose career is devalued and demeaned by older pot bellied neanderthal male detectives who insist she only got her position through prostitution.
There is the crusty cynical white male police chief (Brolin/Bush) who is only interested in re-election but reluctantly agrees to let Theron do the right thing in the case. The gritty reality of everyday police work is brilliantly captured by Theron's wardrobe. She is, inevitably, a single mother with a precious pre-pubertal male child.

As sharp and worldly wise as Jones' Father is even he succumbs to...yes, cultural insensitivity, when he refers to a Mexican American soldier as a ""wetback."" In the powerfully affecting denouement of the story he and this soldier are reconciled by their mutual pain and disgust with Life and the Military.

3069184,1,B0011V7PSC,"I watched the movie because I thought it was a murder mystery and because it starred Tommy Lee Jones. Toward the end, I realized it was only another political propaganda piece. It would have been more accurately entitled ""Broken Army,"" ""Terrorism American Style,"" or ""Army Psychopaths from Iraq.""

Tommy Lee Jones plays a father who is looking for his missing son, Mike. It turns out that Mike was stabbed 40 times and sliced into little cubes by his fellow Iraq War veterans. His body parts were found partially eaten by wild animals. During the confessions, the soldiers tell the father that Mike could have easily done the same to them. The Iraq War had left them all nuts.

The horror doesn't stop there. The father also finds out that his psychopathic son, Mike, ran over an Iraqi child while in convoy, and that he tortured a prisoner. Mike had captured the muffled, haunting screams in a cell phone video, which plays during dramatic moments throughout the movie.

And, of course, the Iraq War veterans were drug addicts trying to smuggle heroin out of Kuwait.

The last scene is where the father hangs a treasured, battered American flag upside down to show that the country is in distress.

Vietnam War veterans have been portrayed for many years in movies and news stories as homeless misfits and drug addicts. The same myths are already being applied to the Iraq War veterans.",1233360000,17,1387,4.7866108786610875

When it's discovered the young man has actually been murdered in a hideous way, the father and a woman detective, played by Charlize Theron, struggle to put together the true story of what happened...and why. The images from this film are disturbing, but the story opens the eyes to the perspectives and attitudes toward soldiers and the present war in Iraq. As a mother of a young son, this story hit me extremely hard emotionally and may be very difficult for many to watch. That being said, it is a film worth watching.

3069186,3,B0011V7PSC,"This is one of the disastrous antiwar movies that came out in the last few years; They all bombed no matter what budget class they were in.
This was one of the A list entries and acting wise it was by far the best of the entire a or b list movies.  It's a murder mystery and it showcases the supposed damage that happens to men of war.  That they may suddenly butcher their own friends for no reason. this is outrageous in some regards and made most people laugh in the movie house I saw it in when a character claims everyone kills their friends.  This is not a proven fact but what is proven is that drugs or heavy drinking (both are even worse) combined with bad experiences can lead to violence or suicide.  In spite of this the movie is well acted by top performers and has a decent story behind it. This isn't a smear job like other antiwar movies instead it seeks to say that we are in distress and in truth we are.  You can't medicate war traumas with substances this leads to disaster and that should have been more in the front of this flick.  But that being said the movie is a murder mystery and it has a small basis in fact , and it is not mean spirited and anti military people like lets say the loathsome 'the generals daughter"" or the absolutely false ""haditha""  were.  On blu ray this movie looks great and it was a early release relatively on the format.  Whatever your views on the war one can find sympathy for the soldiers we sent over to iraq as they were sent over and over into battle in a ruthless manner. But it's the use of hard drinking or drugs that inevitably lead to most violence among vets and without that factor many vets (but not all)  who did violent acts , would have never committed crimes and in truth most returning vets don't commit crimes either, something the movie doesn't state. The film mainly focuses on those who are violent.  Still with three great actors heading this film it's hard not to enjoy their efforts.  The movie isn't boring and is straighforward and isn't about smearing the vets of today and this makes it a more decent type of antiwar movie than most.",1232928000,,2115,4.313131313131313

However, my criteria when watching a story falls to the plot, characters, and how well it engages my interest. In that respect I have to give this film high marks, especially for the acting of Tommy Lee Jones and Charlize Theron. Yes, the film takes potshots at the military, but no group should be sacrosant. Just look to the Tillman case to see an example of military screwup. All wars produce a group of mentally damaged vets, and Iraq has fathered it share of them. Just enjoy this film for the drama and forget about the politics.",1232841600,,603,4.441441441441442
3069188,5,B0011V7PSC,"This movie was criticized in the magazine Salon for taking the easy way out and by the Los Angeles Times for incorrectly conveying an important message. In spite of such criticism, the director Paul Haggis won an award given by the SIGNIS  at the 2007 Venice Film Festival, and Tommy Lee Jones was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.
Much as ""Crash"", the previous movie directed by Haggis, this movie presents a serious, controversial and divisive topic. Certainly it is expected that not everyone in the audience will be pleased by Haggis' strong and straight forward approach.

The plot of the movie is based on the actual experience of Richard Davis, an Iraq war veteran, who returns home in 2003 after he and his comrades participated in the April 11, 2003, ""Midtown Massacre,"" in downtown Baghdad. On July 15, 2003, less than two days after returning from Irag deployment, Davis was murdered brutally outside Fort Benning, Ga by fellow soldiers.
Lanny Davis, the father of Richard Davis and a former military police officer, launches his own investigation to find out what happened to his missing son, because the army wouldn't investigate the case and treated it as AWOL/desertion.

While minor details and the names of the characters have been changed, Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding in the role of the father, who finds out the truth with the help of detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron).
While the investigation reveals the details of the murder, it also reveals the emotional and psychological destruction the American soldiers suffered watching innocents being killed by mistakes, women raped, and prisoners tortured. The movie is a close look at the dilemma soldiers face, when they go back to their normal lives after watching war crimes, and the loss of faith and ambivalence Americans feel between their loyalty to their government and the reality they are all faced with during the war.
Tommy Lee Jones out did himself showing conflict and confusion between a father's love and loyal citizen. Also, the ending of the movie is a thought provoking and symbolic one inspired by the United States Flag Code.

Now that president Bush is out of the White House leaving some unfinished business, I recall what  Mahatma Gandi once said: ""What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is brought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty or democracy?"". Six years after the beginning of the war against Iraq, what justification will we offer the dead innocents? What comfort will we give to the American soldiers who have suffered enormous trauma facing an enemy they don't even know and now question their values?
What brush will we use to paint the canvas of our history in Iraq? Will we use the brush of denial, self justification and delusion or the brush of perspective humility and profound sorrow at an action gone badly wrong?

I don't expect many people to agree with my review, especially because of the way we as a nation continue to hide our heads in the sand and follow with blind faith our sense of righteousness and superiority about the Iraq War. Great movies like ""In the Valley of Elah' are the simple impetus that force people to open their eyes to wonder and question their actions and political maturity.",1232409600,6,3323,4.903914590747331
3069189,1,B0011V7PSC,"I'm rather surprised buy the glowing reviews.  Tommy Lee Jones and Charlize Theron, give good performances, but others in the cast do not and in general the film feels cheap and preachy.  Some secondary characters seem like locals given a few lines as a favor, not professionals.  Apparent location shots in buildings were framed distant and clinical.  Likely this was to create a mood -but its so often used in cheap direct to video films, that's the impression it leaves.

As to the peachiness, the film is ""inspired"" by an actual case, but has little in common with it.  In the film Tommy Lee is a straight-laced country, core, God in that order vet.  He slowly finds his son was missing, then murdered, and slowly that his son had become a drug using sadist.  Tidbits like a scene set in a gun store where they frame the huge selection of guns, and a local case where a guy in a chicken farm likes to poke the eyes out of the chickens seem to be there to imply the innate cruelty and violence of Americans.  And the arc of the story shows Tom Lee gradually seeing the Army and the war in Iraq as brutalizing and dehumanizing the troops into becoming utterly cold blood killers who can cheerfully kill and torture.  In the end he's shown turning his back on core and country with a closing scene where he disgraces a long cherished family flag.  It reminds me of Vietnam war era films portraying all vets as dehumanized baby killing psychos; both because of its preach bias, and its sloppiness with the facts to make theirpoint.

As has been mentioned the film plot shares little with the actual events, and it also is often clich and contradictory.  Tom Lees character rapidly shows up the local police and Army investigators, finding clue after clue missed or bungled by the other investigators.  The dead sons body is so brutally destroyed that little was recovered, and of that there were signs of at least 40 stab wounds.  Which as any detective show watcher knows implies uncontrollable rage.  The murderer however expresses no real feeling at all about the killing, though he apologizes and seems a little sorry to have lost his friend.  An argument got out of hand, and then he realized he stabbed him.  It's sufficiently unlikely I expected it to be a false trail to quickly unravel.  After the murder the body was cut up, burned, and disposed - near by to virtually the only streetlight in a deserted road at the edge of a dessert.  Near the end there is a flashback scene that seems to be what was supposed to have broken Tommy Lees son, but seems unclimactic to have had such impact..

All in all the film seemed to me, to be Tommy Lee Jones and Charlize Theron in a film well bellow their normal standards.  Where they gave good performances, but not up to their best work.  I was stunned to hear it won raves from Hollywood, and a award nomination for Tommy Lee.  I sincerely can only believe it was due to its slanted plot, appealing to strong political biases.",1231977600,9,2979,4.545966228893058
3069190,5,B0011V7PSC,"I watched this film to find out why Tommy Lee Jones got an Oscar nom, but wasn't considered by any other critics group (even the Indie Spirits). Well, it's an amazing character driven narrative by Paul Haggis (Crash), and Tommy Lee shows incredible control, eschewing his natural penchant for humor. This is not a humorous film; rather bleak, dark, riveting and a darn good mystery. This is based on fact, though modified to make a coherent narrative; I found no problem with that, but don't watch the DVD extras first, or it will destroy the mystery. I won't blab away the plot, but it's about a son who goes missing, and Tommy Lee tries to find out what happened. Excellent support from Charlize Theron and a small but touching cameo by Susan Sarandon as Tommy's wife. Previous reviewers were put off because it didn't follow all the facts of the case. Who cares? It's a film, presenting a story that is interesting. Throwing in some ambivalence from the authorities adds to the angst that Tommy Lee Jones displays so well. It's a worthy film.

3069191,4,B0011V7PSC,"""In The Valley Of Elah"" isn't really a movie about the Iraq War - it's about the soldiers who return home from it and the parents of those soldiers who don't return home at all.

Written and directed by Paul Haggis (who did the equally superb ""Crash"" and ""Million Dollar Baby""), the movie is far less showy than ""Rendition"" and less posturing than the ridiculous ""Lions For Lambs"". And while ""Elah"" has an unfolding power in its carefully measured pace, it's also braver in its assessment of the American military and their less-than-angelic ways...

Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Sarandon play Hank & Joan Deerfield, the parents of a young soldier Mike Deerfield, who has inexplicably gone missing since his return from a tour in Bosnia and Iraq in November 2004. Hank visits the base where his son bunked, but neither Jason Patrick as Lieutenant Kirklander, James Franco as Sgt. Carnelli nor any of his division buddies are helpful - and worse - many seem unnerved - almost as if they're hiding something very nasty. A local beleaguered Detective in the police force, single-parent Emily Sanders (played by a superb Charlize Theron) gets embroiled in what she suspects is a grieving father being shafted by the canny US military. And without giving away too much, on the story goes...

One of the movies great strengths is of course the presence and capability of real heavyweights like Jones, Sarandon and Theron. Tommy Lee in particular is sensational. Just when you thought you'd seen every stone-clad grimace he can throw at you, for ""Elah"" he digs down deep and finds tremulous moments that floor you with their power and humanity. His character Deerfield is ""army"" - old-school values and discipline - he presses his trousers over a table to get the crease right - fixes an American flag that has been hanging upside down - calls all women 'mam' and won't be seen without a clean shirt on in front of any of them. Yet Hank is not naive either - he knows that his boy's tour of Iraq wouldn't have been without sickening cruelty or even dishonour. But what gives the movie its emotional core is his skill at depicting that. You can 'feel' his barely-contained lashing-out rage bubbling underneath - or when he just quietly sits in his pick-up truck in sad-eyed despair - why are American sons left in pieces on scrubs for wild animals to feed on - did I impose my `will' on my boy and force the army life on him - and why does civilian America not give a shit about any of it?

There's a scene where Sarandon walks away with her husband down a corridor - there's no music - just them walking away - her hand outstretched in disbelief. The camera stays stationary - watching them walk away in silence - and you know the buckle into his arms is going to come - you know it - and yet when it does - it still has the power of real hurt.

Theron is great too - one of the most intelligent actresses working in Hollywood today - she has her beauty toned down by dowdy dark hair and clunky uniforms - and it works - you concentrate on her first rate acting. There's a scene when she hugs her sleeping son at night who needs the bedroom door open because he's scared - she hugs him close - thankful that he is not another statistic of some ignored list somewhere - you 'feel' what is precious to us - and the utter devastation of having that link to our very soul taken away...

The supporting cast is also universally superb - really good actors in a quality film given quality material to work with - and they know it. Jason Patrick gets his best part in years as the Forces spokesman trapped between the two worlds of the Army's need to cover up and the public's need for the truth; Josh Brolin plays the local Police Chief, weary of unsolved cases and ever so slightly disinterested, but a man who knows that his female detective will terrier out the ugly no matter what. Barry Corbin (of Northern exposure fame) puts in a touching old-army buddy cameo with Tommy Lee in a caf, while Jake McLaughlin and Mehcad Brooks are idealistic and young as the 'just following orders' grunts. Wes Chatham in particular is chillingly fantastic as Corporal Penning - detached and jauntily psychotic as he discusses how hungry he gets after a good day's killing...

""In The Valley Of Elah"" is a phrase from the Bible parable about David and Goliath - where David must beat his fear of the monster - and win. ""Elah"" is neither jolly nor pretty - but it has amazing truths in it. I thought it was an exceptional movie and it stayed with me long after I pressed the stop button. Much like war and its aftermath I suspect for those who really did lose someone...

Soldiers are active participants in surival games that require them to kill with or without reason in order to preserve their won life or the lives of the people around them.  This story is a story of the current generation of young people going to Iraq.  They are used to video cameras, simple comforts of every day life, while long stays in a third world country like Iraq are having lasting effects on their psyche.  Tommy Lee Jones plays a father whose sons goes AWOL. He is convinced that if his son is missing, there must be a valid reason and decides to launch his own investigation.  When a body was found just outside of the city and identified as remains of his son, he is determined to find a person that committed the crime.  Local police and military police fight over jurisdiction and the right to investigate the crime.  Is it that military wants to keep this hush-hush, or that the local police does not want another murder on their worksheet?  Caught in the battle are the grief stricken father and a female police officer, herself a victim of endless sexist torture at the workplace.  What is mesmerizing is the way that a young man was killed (over 40 stab wounds with the knife, body cut up in pieces and burned).  Even more troubling is the discovery that it was his military buddies who did it.  What sort of experience do these young men go through to be able to kill in the most gruesome way one of their own?  Are they sociopaths enabled even more by their participation in a war where killing is a part of the daily life, or just irrevocably damaged goods with no shred of consience left?

3069196,4,B0011V7PSC,"It is all written on the faces, the harried father who desperately seeks the whereabouts of his son after a tour in Iraq, the others who served with the young man, their proud military bearing and soft-spoken reverence for authority belied by what they have seen and done in service to their country. In this powerful, haunting tale, the rigors of war fall upon the survivors. Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones), ex-career military, leaves his home in Tennessee, wife (Susan Sarandon) waiting anxiously behind. Hank's last words: ""I'll find him."" Setting off in his pickup truck, Hank heads for his Mike Deerfield's military base. There are insufficient answers to ease a troubled father's mind. Hoping to circumvent the military police, Hank requests the help of Detective Emily Sanders, a young woman much derided by her fellow detectives. Resistant to Deerfield's imprecations, Sanders at allows him to accompany her to the scene of a recent crime, the mutilation and burning of an unidentified victim.

Once the victim is identified we come to the heart of the film- the reasons for a brutal slaying that straddles the border of military and civilian jurisdiction. Clinging to his rigorous daily standards, military corners on his motel bed, spit-shining his shoes each night before the terrible revelations of the next day, Deerfield is the contemporary American father, patriotic, hard-working, respectful of the institution that has formed the backbone of his life and that of his family. But everything he believes is challenged by the facts, piece by disheartening piece, all pointing towards an institution overwhelmed by the necessities of an ongoing war and the collateral damage inflicted on those who honor their country's call. Director Haggis is circumspect- at no time does he disrespect the military or the soldiers who serve their nation. But he cuts to the heart of war as etched on the face of one parent who bears the unbearable, the loss of a son in circumstances that baffle and disturb him.

Reviewing snippets of film accessed from his son's cell phone, Deerfield watches his son's reactions to the stresses of war, the moral dilemmas faced daily by soldiers in combat. Returning home, these young men are as tightly coiled as when in Iraq, struggling to integrate in a world that has moved on. As the detective slowly unravels a web of deceit engineered by the army, Deerfield hovers nearby, unable to return home without answers. Those he receives do little to lessen his pain, the internal struggle writ clear on the actor's face, more powerful than the declarations of the guilty, the smooth, untroubled faces of Mike's friends. One laments, ""I couldn't wait to get out of Iraq. After two weeks here, I wish I could go back."" This portrait of loss is scathing and painful, with no villain to blame, save the grim realities of war in the modern age, when powerful machines of destruction are wielded by the flesh and blood of fallible humans. David slays Goliath in the Valley of Elah, but this is a monster of our own making, the nature of war and its necessary, if inhuman demands. With a superior supporting cast (Charlize Theron, Susan Sarandon, Jason Patrick), Jones stands alone, much like his character, his grief relentless.

3069199,2,B0011V7PSC,"As soon as I saw the, ""Based on True Events"" disclaimer at the beginning of the film, I immediately became suspicious that the film would use dramatic license too liberally.

And it did. Yes, some soldiers murdered another soldier. Yes, they tried to burn the remains. But that's where the similarities end.

This is just another despicable, ""The war is making baby killers out of our boys"" film that exploits a true life tragedy to advance anti-war sentiment...and dishonors the other brave men and women who did serve honorably in Iraq.

Everything else depicted in the film did not happen--no cell phone with graphic videos of events in Iraq, no father doing his own detective work, no fried chicken after the murder, no brother who also got killed in Iraq, no assisting female detective, no sexist pig detectives, no suicide, no stonewalling military police, no city police unwilling to investigate...

One word sums this movie up perfectly--fraud.  If it were just a work of fiction, fine.  But instead it tries to dupe the audience into thinking it's real by claiming it's based on true events.",1219708800,6,1100,4.918918918918919

His investigation takes him from his sons closest friends in the military to local bars and a restaurant. He gets the assistance of a female police detective, played by Theron, that is first reluctant but then more than understanding of his concern.

3069204,3,B0011V7PSC,"This film is solid in terms of acting and direction. The story is exciting and well constructed. But the film subtly projects a message (subtle in that it is hidden in Tommy Lee Jones's quest to solve his son's murder) that our soldiers in Iraq are self-destructive psychos with no moral fiber. War is, indeed, hell. But it does take two to fight, another truism. It is very easy to criticize when all seems to be secure; our soldiers are fighting to protect our security. The main thing that I got out of this taut drama is that the media can manipulate our sentiments. When Jones flew the flag at the end, I thought he was going to fly it the proper way to honor his son. I was surprised.",1215388800,3,690,4.315384615384615
3069205,4,B0011V7PSC,"Usually when I'm told that anyone is ""complicated,"" I shy away, having too often found the term a cover for someone who is a self-dramatizing bore. However this movie presents complicated people who are inherently interesting, and a complicated situation that is inherently moving and not just a layer-cake of contrived emotion.

This might be one of the few movies you'll see that does NOT assume a young enlisted person who fought in Iraq is automatically ""a hero."" In fact, much of the compelling drama of this film revolves around the viewer's discovery of just how unheroic young Mike Deerfield was.

The disillusionment is made all the more poignant in that we see it through the eyes of the young man's father when he goes to his son's state-side base to find out the circumstances of the young man's grisly death. The disappointment in who his son had grown up to be comes in subtle ways at first, as when Tommy Lee Jones goes to Mike's regular off-duty hangout and finds it's a sleazy strip-joint. One could dismiss that - boys will be boys. But the realization of the young man's character flaws starts to go deeper.

Two mysteries haunt this drama. The first is the obvious one about who killed the young man. But the second mystery, the one that is legitimately complicated, revolves around how this young man, born with so much promise, could have devolved into such a flawed and actually corrupt human being.

Was it his father's stern military influence skewing the boy to place more emphasis on spit-and-polish appearance than on warm human exchange? Was it the brutalizing circumstances of the guerilla war in Iraq? Was it humankind's innate propensity for evil?

The bonus material on this DVD includes one particularly telling outtake. I usually agree with Director's decisions about which scenes were best left on the cutting room floor. But in this case, the main outtake would have added a lot to the character study. In any case, be sure to check it out in the DVD extras.

Susan Sarandon doesn't have a great deal to do in this movie, and outside of one or two wrenching scenes, is almost wasted in the role of the quietly suffering, marginalized wife. However Tommy Lee Jones gives a tour de force performance, really making us feel the consequences of a family's emotional estrangement. This is a memorable film all the way around.",1215302400,2,2357,4.793103448275862
3069206,4,B0011V7PSC,"I have to admit it was with some trepidation that I finally saw this 2007 murder mystery directed and written by Paul Haggis. His last time doing double-duty was the polarizing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>, an omnibus fable of LA-based race relations, powerfully acted but also a manipulative model of melodramatic contrivance. This time out, he is less patronizing because the storyline is more contained and based in fact. However, Haggis still shows the same need to stay topical, seek restitution for his characters and convey an undeniable sense of parable. These factors are what make movie-watchers either love his work or hate it for the way he often undercuts the credibility of the drama to make his points. Regardless, there is no arguing with the fact that Tommy Lee Jones gives a masterful performance of a man who can barely contain his grief under a veneer of old-school reserve. It's a gratifying continuation of the recently stellar work he has done in his own directorial debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Burials-of-Melquiades-Estrada/dp/B000F8O2QU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada</a>, and the Coen Brothers' bleak&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Country-for-Old-Men/dp/B00118T63C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Country for Old Men</a>.

Jones plays taciturn Hank Greenfield, a retired Army officer and ex-military cop who now hauls gravel in Tennessee. He receives word that his son Mike, a soldier just back from Iraq, is about to be reported as AWOL from his base in New Mexico. Immediately sensing something is not right, Hank leaves his concerned wife Joan at home and drives straight to the base to see if he can get to the bottom of his son's disappearance. He receives next to no assistance from either the military or the local police, who argue over whether it's a matter for the Army to resolve. Things change dramatically when a charred, dismembered body is found abandoned in a desolate field outside of town. Once it has been identified, Hank works diligently and fractiously with Emily Sanders, a sympathetic, overworked detective, to find out not only who the murderer is but what the reasons were for such a vile act of inhumanity. Naturally, they encounter an abundance of military red-tape, pervasive apathy from the local police force and a couple of red herrings before coming to a resolution.

Without giving anything away, I have to say the ending lacks a deep emotional resonance that would have made Hank's journey to know his son truly memorable. Instead, we find Haggis informing us how the day-to-day bloodshed in Iraq cannot help but impact the hearts and minds of those who make it home, a lesson one would have thought was made clear from Vietnam. Beyond the quietly nuanced work of Jones, a somewhat deglamorized Charlize Theron continues to prove she can be a fine actress in worthy roles like Emily (and not the comic-book dominatrix&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aeon-Flux/dp/B000EOTAM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aeon Flux</a>). She fluctuates between strong and empathetic with impressive fluidity. In the understandably smallish role of Joan, Susan Sarandon barely has any screen time for an actress of her caliber, but she makes her couple of wrenching scenes count. Similarly powerful actors have been cast in relatively minor parts - James Franco as an officious base official, Josh Brolin as Emily's ego-driven chief, a nearly unrecognizable Barry Corbin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Northern-Exposure/dp/B000V6LSO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Northern Exposure</a>) as Hank's old Army pal, and Jason Patric who is allowed to make of an impression as a poker-faced lieutenant who appears to be stonewalling the case. Frances Fisher has a thankless cameo as a topless waitress who provides one of the key clues in the case.

Except for a couple of unnecessary detours toward the end, Haggis has ultimately made less of an involving mystery and more of a dramatically effective ""message"" movie - not as heavy-handed as ""Crash"" and of a less arguable variety. The 2008 DVD offers no commentary track from either Haggis or Jones, a surprising omission, but there is a sobering 43-minute video diary of the production spotlighting a number of the actors playing the soldiers as well as the parents of the real-life soldier upon whom Haggis based his story. Also included is an ""additional scene"", which amounts to an eight-minute deleted subplot about Mike's unknown girlfriend rather absurdly named ""Jennifer Lopez"" for easy laughs. The laughs evaporate when we see she is a multiple amputee who began to see Mike's changing nature. Particularly fascinating is the variable use of green scene to hide her limbs.",1215043200,2,4995,5.802452316076295
3069207,2,B0011V7PSC,"Valley is a beautifully shot movie, with great acting and an engaging thriller script.  Plus it criticizes the Iraq War.  Hence the great reviews.

But there is another side to Valley - disrespect for soldiers and dishonest manipulation of the facts.  Soldiers in Valley are pretty much all depicted negatively:  they spend times in strip joints and with hookers, do drugs (meth, just in case viewers don't mind marijuana) and booze up constantly.  And, oh, yes, they are also torturers, psychopaths and murderers.

At the core, Valley is a true story, but a wee bit ""spiced up"" to get the PC message across.  Do soldiers booze up and go to strip clubs?  I'd be surprised if many didn't.  Do they all do that and are they all druggies?  Hmmm, probably not, but that's not what Valley shows.

Another example is that you have 2 simultaneous murders on the same base.  The main story's and the bathtub drowning incident.  In real life, the bathtub drowning didn't happen in the same place and time.  Now, 1 grisly murder is a big story, sure.  2 murders imply a trend.  Valley is all about implications by twisting facts.

Does the VA always treat veterans well?  Ummm, there was a scandal about that, no?

Is the Bush administration incompetent and did they royally mess up in Iraq?  Yes and yes.

Are vets at risk of coming back traumatized?  Yes, and they need help, not being spit on.

Do soldiers, under the pretense of caring for them, need to be generalized as psychopathic low-lives?  I think not.

And if you wanna tell me that the real-life dad of the victim liked the movie...  so what?  Do you really expect him to sing the praise of the Army and its soldiers, considering what was done to his son?",1214870400,5,1708,4.584717607973422

If you're a supporter of the war, you will be forced to reconsider the reasoning for it. However, the documentary in the special features section will raise guilt in those who have not supported the war. Soldiers returned from Iraq speak about how they expected to return to a society that understood the trauma that they had undergone. When in reality, very little has changed.

The overall message of the film is extremely powerful. For those interested in the cinematography, it
 was as strong as nearly any film I've seen.

While your political views may not be in line with those that come across on the surface of this film, I urge you to give it a shot. Renting is always a good way to see if you like it before considering purchasing it.",1214784000,,1004,4.535911602209945
3069210,4,B0011V7PSC,"This is a truly exceptional film, I didn't think I could like Tommy Lee Jones any more than I already do but he is really outstanding in this movie.  I have to agree with the person who said it's depressing, it is. My heart ached after watching this and I didn't think I'd ever want to watch it again but I can't stop thinking about it.
I take exception to those who say it's nothing more than an anti-war, Bush-bashing, movie. Paul Haggis was inspired to write the screenplay after reading an article in Playboy (""Death and Dishonor"" by Mark Boal, 2004) about Army Specialist Richard Davis, an Iraq war veteran who was murdered shortly after his return from Iraq. Richard Davis's father Lanny is also a former military police officer like the character Tommy Lee Jones plays, he too mounted his own investigation into his son's murder as did Tommy Lee Jones' character.
The case of Richard Davis' murder was also featured on CBS' 48 Hours and author Cilla McCain has written a book about it entitled, ""Murder in Baker Company: The Forgotten Soldier"" (Ms. McCain's own review can be found here: [...]
During the Vietnam War they sold POW bracelets that had engraved on them the name of a missing soldier, his rank and the date he went missing. Along with the bracelets came stickers for you to stick on the bracelet after the status of the missing soldier was discovered. Sadly the soldier on my bracelet was MIA until long after my bracelet broke, but I will never forget his name: Sgt. Harold Reid. I researched a few years ago and found out they had finally recovered his body and brought it home for burial near his family in Utah.
Isn't it unfortunate that for all the ""Support Our Troops"" yellow ribbons and magnets I see on cars everywhere, so little is done for them once they return home, they're essentially forgotten. Why aren't we equally supportive of those who have returned so changed from a needless, senseless war? Why would they need us to remember them and how they've selflessly given of themselves to serve our country? After all, they're ""done"", right?",1214611200,,2074,4.666666666666667
3069211,5,B0011V7PSC,"Trying to rationalize IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH will challenge your views. Many of them. And this is the signature of good cinema. We all know that war changes people. Men go to foreign lands, are ordered to do horrendous things in the name of ""god and country"", and then are supposed to return home to a normal, happy, healthy life. Nothing could be further from the truth. Director Paul Haggis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>) once again shows us a complex issue with morality taking a tailspin.

Based on a true story, In the Valley of Elah is a chilling and disturbing tale of how some young men are affected by the war in Iraq. Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Country-for-Old-Men/dp/B00118T63C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Country for Old Men</a>) is awakened one morning by a disturbing phone call. His son has gone missing ...but not in Iraq. He's back home at his army base but hasn't been seen in days. Hank -- a retired army man himself -- kisses his wife Joan (Susan Sarandon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enchanted/dp/B0011U52EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enchanted</a>) goodbye and heads out to find him. And what he discovers is numbing and completely irrational.

The mood is set immediately when Hank leaves home and finds an American flag flying upside down; the international distress symbol for soldiers in trouble. Why and who did this is never known, but the message is clear: our boys in uniform need help.

When Hank's son's body is found mutilated, Hank turns up his private investigation skills with the help of Detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-Country/dp/B000CQLZ8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North Country</a>). Learning a great deal from each other, the two form a tenuous friendship based on the discovery of the truth about the murder. And the truth will flabbergast many viewers ...but in a thought-provoking way.

The cast of this film is simply phenomenal. Tommy Lee holds the production to a very high standard, and watching him trying not to burst into tears is probably one of the more powerful moments in the film. Also, I didn't realize that Det. Sanders was Charlize Theron. Minimal make-up and a tight hairdo (as well as some great acting) made me just see her character. A special note also MUST be made for one scene in particular. And this scene involved Susan Sarandon as Joan, the wife of Hank and mother of the murdered soldier. This scene was so powerful that it made me hold my breath. It is when she demands to see the remains of her son but can only view them through a glass pane that looks into the morgue (""Is that all? It looks so cold in there. Can I go in?"") Gut-wrenching!

I applaud director Paul Haggis for making us look at the faults that surround us. Similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>, this film holds nothing back and forces us to peer into those places we dare not look.

3069212,5,B0011V7PSC,This is a great contemporary movie based on a true life story.  Tommy Lee Jones and Charlize Theron are great as always.  The story illustrates what happens to many of our soldiers after returning from Iraq.  A must see.,1212192000,,220,4.589743589743589
3069213,5,B0011V7PSC,"This is a nicely paced, intelligent and well acted movie that gives the three principal A listed actors, Tommy Lee Jones, Charlize Theron and Susana Sarandon ample opportunity to display their remarkable skills.  Susan Sarandon, as always, plays a strong supporting role as Tommy's distressed wife. Tommy Lee, in particular, is outstanding in this.  His trademark masculinity is perfectly suited to this portrayal of a former soldier in search of his son, suspected at first of being AWOL after a tour of duty in Iraq. Tommy gets to discover the whole truth with the assistance of Charlize's character, a jaded female cop, a good woman struggling with a cuture of apathy and male chauvanism. She makes a few bad calls earlier that dramatically come back to haunt her later on.  Her relationship with Tommy is tense at first, but she eventually sees the light and joins with him in his battle to find the truth, notwithstanding resistance from colleagues and the military police who seem intent on a cover up.  This is not a cops and robbers type story.  It is primarily about the dehumanising consequences of miltarism for the young men who serve. The director isn't forcing his ideas on the viewer, but allowing the story to unfold naturally. There is a particularly poignant piece of symbolism involving the stars and stripes.  Earlier in the film, Tommy sees a fellow trying to raise Old Glory upside down after allowing it to dangle on the ground.  He gently explains the proper protocol involved in respectfully honouring this proud symbol of the American nation. Towards the very end of the movie, however, and after discovering the truth about his son's dreadful murder, the flag raising is repeated.  This time Tommy hangs it upside down as he explain the symbolic meaning of doing so: ""It means,"" he says, ""we are in serious trouble and all hope is lost"" - or words to that effect.

3069215,5,B0011V7PSC,"Ex MP Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones in one of his best roles) once had two sons. The first one got killed in a war, the second one has gone missing after he returned from Iraq.
Without thinking twice or discussing things with his wife (Susan Sarandon) Hank goes looking for him.
But he is not prepared for the dirty truths that come to light. It doesn't take him long to realize that the young man he is looking for has changed. With the help of a few blurry shots and videos from his son Mike's mobile phone and a local detective (also very impressive: Charlize Theron) he is able to dig deeper into his son's past. Not only has Iraq destroyed a large part of Mike's psyche, it has also changed his life for the worse. Boredom, booze, drugs, strip clubs and more boredom, booze and drugs have invaded the young man's life.
Mike is found, or what is left of him. He was brutally murdered.
In the end the case is solved but the lives of all (including yours) will be changed forever.
I want to point out that for me this was NOT an anti military film. Although the army isn't always shown in its best light, the director Paul Haggis tries to show us a neutral vision on what happens when young men are exposed to the cruelty of war.
True, the army looks a little helpless. Bound by rules and regulations and afraid to lose the trust and support of the American people, they try to protect the soldiers by withholding statements and manipulating the investigation. But that is all understandable.
This film is anti war (and anti racist). No matter where you look, either the Deerfield family or Mike's army buddies, so many lives lost and destroyed all because of war.
It will stay with you forever. The acting is state of the art, camera, directing and script terrific.
With Blu-ray and HDDVD you have the story jumping into your living room - which I believe is what it deserves.
As an extra there is a small heart wrenching storyline involving Mike's ex-girlfriend (who is not in the theatrical version of the movie) and interviews with the co-stars who play the army buddies, most of which have served in Iraq thus knowing exactly what this is all about. My utmost respect goes out to these young men.",1211500800,18,2205,4.47394540942928

3069218,4,B0011V7PSC,"What a terribly sad film.  ""In the Valley of Elah"" tugs at heart strings and although not based on a true story is perhaps emblematic of many American veterans of the war in Iraq.

Tommy Lee Jones plays Hank Deerfield, a war veteran whose son, Mike, has just returned from Iraq.  Yet although Mike has returned, he has gone missing.  Hank decides to look into the matter.  He quickly learns that Mike has died a horrible murderous death.  His paternal instincts lead him to investigate the matter and, in the process, he forms a bond of sorts with a detective, Emily Sanders, who is played by Charlize Theron.  Slowly and methodically, they piece the puzzle together.  The result is very grim with soldiers who have witnessed great tragedy in a war having difficulties adjusting back to civilian life.

In many respects, ""In the Valley of Elah"" is simply a whodunit.  But to leave it at this point is to disregard a powerful story and a brooding plot that lets the actors shine.  The performances of Jones and Theron are excellent.  So too is the cameo role played by Susan Sarandon as Hank's wife.  Her world is truly ripped apart as this death follows the earlier death of her older son.  Her family is broken asunder.

Although this is a film where attention to detail is required, do not let this claim put off any potential viewers.  The film is challenging but, ultimately, rewarding.",1211155200,,1390,4.658436213991769
3069219,2,B0011V7PSC,"This is a dishonest film that suggests all military in combat can return home, still kill someone and, immediately after the deed, satisfy a hungry stomach. It makes no attempt to convey the idea that most combat service people, dealing with serious emotional issues, don't embrace this sort of attitude and conduct. The film also suggests that this is an issue unique to the situation in Iraq. All military, in all countries, in all wars have members who committed such acts. If you're going to protest the war in Iraq, through a screenplay, do so addressing the issues pertaining to this war. If you feel that the soldiers are victims, say it more clearly than how it is done in this screenplay. I say this as a Liberal Democrat.

In Paul Haggis' low-keyed drama, ""In the Valley of Elah,"" a retired army officer goes in search of his son, who may have gone AWOL while on leave from Iraq.  When Hank Deerfield receives the call informing him that Mike has not reported for duty, the concerned father heads to the army base in New Mexico to try to ascertain the young man's whereabouts and find out what's up.

Stylistically, ""Elah"" is the polar opposite of Haggis' previous film, the overwrought and overrated ""Crash,"" which fairly screamed its message from every nook and cranny, using its plot points and characters as little more than bludgeons with which to beat the audience into submission.  Here, the writer/director has toned things down considerably, finally trusting the drama and characters to speak for themselves.  Haggis is obviously against the Iraq War but he doesn`t make speeches about it, preferring instead to let the message filter its way through the story, such as having upbeat news assessments frequently playing on radios and TVs in the background as an ironic counterpoint to the foreground action.

In fact, if anything, the film touches on the subject of the Iraq War almost too obliquely at times, permitting the trite whodunit aspects of the story to take precedence over the human drama.  Still, there are some tremendously moving and powerful moments in the film, courtesy of incisive writing by Haggis and shattering performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Sarandan as the young soldier`s parents.  Jones, who is rarely off screen for the duration of the movie, conveys the world-weary stoicism of a man torn between a love for the military and a dawning awareness that his lifelong bellicosity might be in some way responsible for what has happened to his son.  It's an exquisitely internalized and understated performance.  Sarandon receives far less screen time than Jones but still manages to make an indelible impact as a longsuffering woman who may have been forced to go a bridge too far in sacrificing what is most dear to her for her country.  A scene in which the two of them talk on the phone is one of the most emotionally wrenching moments in recent movie history.  Charlize Theron plays a sympathetic homicide detective who assists Hank in his search for the truth.

At an overlong 122 minutes, ""In the Valley of Elah"" is in no hurry to tell its story, an admirable philosophy in and of itself, but one that frequently leads to attenuation and a dissipation of passion.  Nevertheless, in its own unassuming way, the movie makes its case for how boys are sent off to fight old men's wars (the Valley of Elah is where a young David defeated Goliath) and how they often return home so psychologically scarred and emotionally damaged that they can no longer function in a peacetime setting.",1209772800,,2812,4.880252100840337
3069222,4,B0011V7PSC,"After his career in the military, Hank Deerfield (Jones) settles down for a quiet life with his wife, Joan.  He's not particularly worried at first when he learns his son is AWOL after coming back from Iraq--these things happen.

When the local police call to tell him his son's dead, Hank can't believe it and he enlists Emily Sanders (Theron) a local cop to help him solve his case.  He gets his clues from his son's cell phone files, credit card receipts and testimony from fellow  troop members.

The story's a harsh reminder that the war does not end when ""Johnny comes marching home"" and many of our troops and their families need help they're not getting from either the military or local officials. While Jones initially is only seeking to find his son, he uncovers a lot more about the realities of war than many of us would want to see.  In my opinion, this is Jones' best performance yet.

The father of a young soldier who is reported missing at his U.S. base decides to start his own investigation to find him. A movie about the effects of modern war on unprepared young soldiers and the problems that will inevitably occur when they'll come back home. Recommended.,1207526400,2,374,4.859375
3069231,2,B0011V7PSC,"Much has been made of the fact that this movie is based on a true story, the 2003 murder of Richard Davis, a story chronicled by Mark Boal in an extensive magazine article, ""Death and Dishonor,"" that appeared in the May 2004 issue of Playboy (an article that can be found online and that is far more thought-provoking than this film).  Some reviews go so far as to say that the film hews closely to the story reported by Boal, but the truth is otherwise. (The film opens with the statement that it was ""inspired by actual incidents"" - a statement that usually heralds significant dramatic license.) Indeed, of adapting his story for the screen, Mr. Boal, who shares writing credits for the story with director Paul Haggis (Mr. Haggis alone is credited with the screenplay), had this to say: ""It's a fictional piece [the film], and so at various junctures Paul [Haggis] and I thought we should change Lanny's story to make it feel more universal."" The Lanny to which Mr. Boal refers is Lanny Davis, the real-life father of the victim and the model for the character Hank Deerfield, whom Tommy Lee Jones plays. Exactly what was done to make the story ""feel more universal""?  Be advised that spoilers follow.

Lanny Davis, upon whom Hank Deerfield is based, is, in fact, a 20-year veteran of the Army, 16 of those years with the Military Police. About a month after his son, Richard Davis, was reported AWOL, from his first 2-day pass following his return from six months in Iraq, Mr. Davis traveled to Fort Bragg, where he spent several days trying unsuccessfully to motivate a missing-person investigation into his son's disappearance by either Army or civilian authorities. Failing in that effort, he returned home. About two weeks later he enlisted the support of his congressman, who had the clout to push the Army to investigate Richard Davis as a missing person. At first, the men in Davis's platoon stonewalled. Then, as the Army pressed its cross-examinations, a single soldier repeated a rumor that had been circulating: four members of the platoon had killed Davis and left his body in a wooded area, and he identified both the men and the area. The area fell under the jurisdiction of the Columbus (Georgia) Police Department, which promptly investigated and quickly located remains of the victim. The same day that remains were found, the Army arrested the four members of Richard Davis's platoon identified as responsible and delivered them into civilian custody.

The stories the men told authorities were of an alcohol-fueled night on the town, their first since returning from six months in Iraq, that turned violent. After being evicted from a club, the group was angry with the victim, whose rowdy behavior, it was claimed, was responsible for their eviction, and an argument ensued in the club's parking lot between the victim and one of the group. Then, so their stories went, the group got into their car and left, but as they drove the argument continued. They stopped at an unfamiliar location, got out of the car, and a fistfight ensued between the victim and the fellow with who he had been arguing. But at some point, one of the men pulled a knife and began stabbing the victim. The others claimed to have tried unsuccessfully to intervene. Afterwards, they dragged the body into a more secluded area, and later they returned with gasoline and set it afire. No one involved with the case believes this version of events - it is far more plausible that three of the group were active participants in the victim's death - but the confessions were enough to secure two convictions: one for murder and one for voluntary manslaughter. (The fourth person, whose presence in the group that night was deemed incidental, received five years probation.) The convictions satisfied authorities but not Lanny Davis, who believes his son was killed because he had knowledge of a rape committed in Iraq by the perpetrators, and he remains angry that has not been investigated.

Throughout the film, the Army is portrayed as impeding the investigation, of covering up, and of not cooperating with local authorities, which, as the record shows, is not true. Neither is it true that the civilian authorities were eager to avoid investigating the case. Lanny Davis did not play Sherlock Holmes and conduct his own investigation; neither did he beat a suspect (he first saw the accused at trial). The civilian detective played by Charlize Theron is fiction. (You'll have to ask Mr. Haggis why her fellow detectives and superiors are portrayed as sexist pigs.) There was no cell phone rich with imagery of soldiers acting badly; no suicide. Richard Davis's only sibling is a sister. (In the film he supposedly had a brother who was killed while a soldier, in a helicopter crash, which plays into an emotional scene in which Susan Sarandon asks Tommy Lee Jones something to the effect of ""couldn't you have left me one?"", suggesting that the father encouraged both his sons to join the military. In fact, Lanny Davis did not encourage his only son to join.)

Furthermore, the film seems to suggest that the killers were fine, upstanding young men so dehumanized by what they saw and experienced as soldiers in Iraq that not only could they viciously kill one of their own, they could be hungry enough afterwards to require stopping for fast food. In fact, the three soldiers convicted of Richard Davis's death were hardly fine or upstanding, a fact that leads to the more interesting question: what happens when we send misfits into an environment like Iraq. And as for stopping for fast food afterwards, I found nothing in the record to suggest that is anything but dramatic license. (Lanny Davis dismisses the suggestion that post-traumatic stress syndrome played a role in his son's murder.)

Some aspects of the film may be inspired by actual incidents, but incidents that had nothing to do with the Richard Davis case and which were included, depending on your perspective, either to stack the deck against the policies and institutions whom the director targets, or to make the film ""more universal."" For example, a woman tells Charlize Theron's character that her husband (a veteran of Iraq) drowned their dog in their bathtub, that she's afraid he will hurt her, and she appeals for the authorities to intervene. The response of Ms. Theron's character is to suggest the woman have her husband seek help from the VA. Of course, the woman is later found drowned in her bathtub. To avoid possible ambush, did Lanny Davis's son run over an Iraqi child rather than stop the vehicle he was driving? No. Might these two incidents be based on real events? Yes. Does their inclusion in this story make it more universal? You be the judge.

Tommy Lee Jones's performance has been justly praised, and he is ably supported by others of the cast. But the problem here is not the performances, it's the script. The film touches upon important issues but does so dishonestly in its quest to make the story ""feel more universal.""",1207440000,112,7023,4.856427378964941

Instead of making heroes out of G.I's and terrorists out of Iraqi's, this movie excels in showing the adverse effects of the Iraqi war on young American soldiers.

Returning soldiers are depicted as soul-less, murdering, inhuman monsters.  In the film one soldier drowns his dog AND his wife and other soldiers brutally murder, chop up and burn one of their own men, run over children, desecrate dead bodies, and torture prisoners.  I am sure that atrocities have been committed by a select few in every war, but this film is SO anti-military that it is shameful.
I can only speak from my own experience, which has been that my husband and his fellow soldiers returned from Iraq and have all been upstanding citizens who have proudly served their country.  None of them have murdered anyone or have turned into soul-less monsters after returning from Iraq.  I'm saddened to think that people are giving this movie four and five stars and might actually think that this is what members of the armed forces are like.

The movie was clear, but the audio was not that great. I tried playing around with the Apple TV and the Sony Bravia's settings, and somewhat improved the sound quality. I am not sure whether the audio problem was due to the download or to the settings on my Apple TV and Sony Bravia.

I watched this movie outdoors in my farm, with a bonfire to keep my friends and I warm. I personally loved this movie, but my friends did not. They found it too slow, and didn't really understand what was going on. Two of my friends fell asleep (maybe it was the cold weather and the bonfire).

The movie is about an American soldier who had served in Iraq and who goes missing. His father, played by Tommy Lee Jones, sets out to find him. Throughout the movie we learn of the atrocity of war, and the psychological effect it has on soldiers. The movie portrays that the real villain is not the Iraq war, but war itself. All wars are evil, and there never is a good side. The movie has as a message that not only is the US losing its soldiers in Iraq; it is even losing the ones that return home. The scars of war are hard to heal.

The character of Detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron) is very well played and believable. Some reviewers have commented that she is too beautiful for the role. True, but she plays the role in such a natural and `plain' way that makes her very believable. She does not exude her sexuality, and one tends to quickly overlook her beauty for her genuine concern for the case at hand. She somehow dissolves into her character, and at one point I didn't even realize that it was Theron playing the part. She really is a great actress.

Tommy Lee Jones is another great actor. He expresses emotions so well that he need not say much or move much; the expression on his face says it all.

The title of the movie is derived from a Biblical story. The Valley of Elah is the scene of the battle between David and Goliath. In the Biblical story, Goliath was a ruthless and much feared warrior. He was a giant, and all feared him. No one dared to fight him. But one day, a young boy by the name of David volunteers to fight Goliath. The boy is so small that he floats in his armor. The story relates that upon seeing young David, Goliath charged upon him. Seconds before reaching him and slaughtering him, young David used his sling shot to catapult a stone on Goliath's head. Goliath instantly fell to his death from the blow. Young David, later King David, had to first overcome his fear in order to face and beat Goliath. The message the producers are giving us is clear.

The movie is seen by many as an anti-war movie. I saw it in that light too, and applaud all the crew and actors for this great movie. All wars are wrong and immoral, and no one can possibly justify them! Why do we spend billions of dollars killing each other when Life, given sometime, will do it for us, and for free!

The ending of this movie is one of the most memorable I have seen in a movie, and one that will stay with you for a long time. We see the US flag flying upside down, a sign of distress.

I also liked the scene when Tommy told the story to the little boy at bedtime. I thought that was an excellent touch that showed that he was a great father even though he had his weaknesses (being to hardcore at times). This movie shows how powerful and influencal a father can be in the lives of his children. I like that. During the movie whenever Tommy's son cried out for help during the war... he cried out for his father. Usually during movies Dad's never get credit or thought about. I'm glad there have been more movies made more recently that shows the value of fathers - The pursuit of happyness, Martian Child, Dear Frankie, John Q... etc. Maybe if the media starts showing that it is normal for a father to care about their children, there would be less dead-beat dads.... just a thought.",1206057600,2,1143,4.421800947867299

The calm, cool, collected way the movie goes about introducing the characters and the problem in the opening minutes of the film are amazing.  Everything is understated.  Jones shows his concern through his actions, quiet and controlled, rather than with further dialogue with anyone.  Susan Sarandon portrays Deerfield's wife, and their relationship's deepness and emotional complexity is played out in a few short scenes and sparse, meaningful dialogue that never overstates the worry.  You can see it in the characters, and that's the best way on film.

From the beginning, Deerfield comes across as Joe American.  He stops on the way out of town to help a school janitor to properly display the American flag.  His simple gesture, in the presence of his own crisis, really touched me.  And the movie continues to do that all the way through.

At Fort Rudd, the viewer learns that Deerfield isn't just an ex-military guy.  He was Army CID, part of the criminal investigation division.  That caught my attention immediately and amped up the interest.  Deerfield wasn't going to be easily taken advantage of.  You can almost feel the storm looming on the horizon.

I was thoroughly irritated at how quickly the military blew Deerfield's concern off.  However, I can see how this can sometimes be the case.  Still, Deerfield is slyer than anyone thinks, and quickly manages to get his son's cell phone from his things when the sergeant isn't looking.

I enjoyed how Deerfield, though at least fifteen years away from his past as CID and technologically challenged, picked up the reins on his own investigation so quickly.  Everything started falling back into place for him, and his insight into the military mind was great to watch.  Especially after the interaction with the local police began.

Charlize Theron enters the story when Deerfield goes to the police for help.  She plays Emily Sanders, the only female detective on the squad, and takes a lot of crap about her gender and her relationship with their boss.  She's a single mom trying to find her way, and the last thing she needs is to get tied up with Deerfield's problems - especially with the US Army waiting to shut the investigation down at any moment.

The movie took some surprising twists and turns along the way to the solution of Michael's disappearance and who was actually involved.  I loved the way Deerfield broke his ""cover"" as a quiet, concerned father and became a crusading investigator, and I also feared for him when he lost control and endangered the case and their pursuit of the truth.

Throughout the film, no one ever loses sight of the characters.  As much time is given to the development of the characters as to the development of the investigation.  Deerfield's character was great, and Jones played him to a T.  There's one scene in the laundry where Deerfield is washing his clothes that my wife didn't understand.  Deerfield was sitting in his undershirt waiting for his clothes to dry and spots Emily coming to talk to him.  He hurriedly gets up and pulls a wet shirt out of the dryer and puts it on.  I had to explain to my wife that the kind of man Deerfield was wouldn't allow himself to be seen in his undershirt by a woman not his wife.

The Blu-ray disc is packed full of extras relating to the movie as PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).  If you've got loved ones overseas, this movie can be hard to view on several levels.  However, it might also give you a deep appreciation for what they're doing and what the real cost of the war is going to be.

One of the best scenes in the movie is when Deerfield is telling Emily's son the story of David and Goliath, to let him know where his name came from.  Later, at the end of the movie, Emily is telling her son the same story because he wants to hear it again.  This time her son asks her why all the soldiers let a boy go fight their war for them.  After everything that's been revealed in the movie, that question resonates for a long time.

It did a passable job keeping the story moving along at a comfortable enough pace that I didn't lose my patience, but the thing is, for every two or three exciting segments, we had to put up with two or three uninteresting ones.  To me, that meant the pacing was inconsistent, and the storytelling didn't quite live up to the standards you'd expect.

Furthermore, a few scenes made it appear like not all soldiers are honest when they finally come home from war, and that's not really a good thing to feature in a movie.  It's the kind of story that might be offensive to some people.  I'd rather see the soldiers portrayed as brave people who had to be a part of war and history.",1204934400,,893,4.381818181818182

(ok maybe John Kerry)  A soldier kills his wife, another group kill a friend.  This happens I agree, but not to everyone.  During Vietnam soilder were called baby killers, now are they all going to be considered crazy or mentally unstable.  I hardly think not.  But, why the five stars.

Jones plays a retired Military Police officer who has to undertake an investigation of his army recruit son's disappearance.  I don't recall ever having seen such a broad range of emotions conveyed with so few gestures.  Hank Deerfield is a man of few words, but it's amazing what Jones was able to get across with just his eyes.  Sadness, courage, hatred, dumb anguish.

3069253,5,B0011V7PSC,"When Hank Deerfield's son goes missing upon his return from Iraq, he decides to investigate for himself.  What he discovers, though, takes him on a whirlwind emotional journey.  It's an excursion into the heart of humanity--what makes a hero different from you and me, and what makes you and me different from everybody else.

Tommy Lee Jones is spectacular.  Plain and simple.  Watch this movie, if you have any doubt about the quality of his performance.  Jones had two great movie roles in 2007 (the other being ""No Country For Old Men,"" and half the cast of that movie is in this one).  It's a shame he didn't win Best Actor for this...but oh well.  We can watch the movie and enjoy it--or ""enjoy"" it.  You'll have your heart ripped out of your chest; I'm not sure I'd call that ""enjoyable.""

The supporting roles, too, are very well-performed.  Charlize Theron is a bit too sexy for her role, but we'll forgive her; she chews her way through it like it was nothing.  James Franco, Jason Patric, and Josh Brolin make the best of their minor roles.  Susan Sarandon is a wonder; she's upstaged at every turn, of course, but that isn't her fault; her role isn't big enough for her to milk to its full potential.

""In the Valley of Elah"" is not an easy movie to watch; it's an emotional rollercoaster that leaves you breathless, aching, empty.  But it is a movie you SHOULD watch.

Jone's character learns his son is missing from his army base just after his return home from Iraq. What follows is the unraveling of a mystery and an emotional trajectory in which Jone's character comes to grips with the fact that America's moral anchor has lost its grip and that the war that indirectly killed his son ruins everything it touches. I'm no prude, but as a woman, I was put off by the ubiquitous strip club scene. Yes, you could say it added local color, being near an army base and all, but to me it was just the Director or whomever, indulging their adolescent fantasies. It's ironic that a film with such a strong message has to stoop to exploitation of this sort. If this country is ever going to heal itself, someone in Hollywood is going to have to take a stand! Susan Sarandon, you are are one of the stars of this film. Say something!",1204156800,,937,4.390804597701149
3069255,4,B0011V7PSC,"You can't go wrong with Tommy Lee Jones in a title role.  He perfectly plays the father of the Iraq war vet who returns home and vanishes.  No histrionics, no hysterics, no tears, but that craggy old face of his tells all.  Jones as Hank Deerfield sets out to find out what happened to his son, and ends up discovering a lot more than he might have wanted to.

His son has returned from Iraq a changed man, and not for the better.  He was ordered to run down an Iraqi child (which has really happened, according to some vets) and tries to communicate to his father, through his tears, that he'd done something terribly wrong.  Deerfield throughout the movie repeatedly hears his son's agonized ""dad....daddy"" in his dreams and only at the end do we see how he dismissed his son's anguish.  The latter eventually cracks up, torturing wounded Iraqis and treating women like dirt.

Indeed, many of the featured returning vets have become twisted in some way by their experiences in Iraq, which is no doubt a major point of the film and all too frequently accurate.  The film likely overplays this facet a bit, which is why it gets four, not five stars from me.

Because this film otherwise has superb acting and plot, with a combination of murder mystery, young men warped by war, and decent folks trying to sort it all out.  An emaciated Charlize Theron plays the detective who reluctantly helps out Deerfield in his own informal investigation and must put up with his gruff insults.  She downplays her good looks with a severe hairdo and a pencil-thin body--somebody needs to get her some beef fat and chicken soup immediately.

Susan Sarandon perfectly portrays the worried, then grief-stricken mother, although the old standby retort ""you don't have any children, do you"" has gotten awfully stale through overuse over the years.  Nonetheless, the scene in which Jones breaks the news to her of their son's ghastly death is one of the most heart-wrenching pictures of sorrow and anguish I've ever seen on the screen.  This is fine acting which cuts close to the bone without ever threatening to go over the top.

Also moving was the quiet way Hank Deerfield's father's love for his son is shown, as contrasted to his wife's motherly heartbreak.  It's a nicely nuanced and effective approach the director and writers took

The valley of Elah refers to where David slew Goliath, where the courage of the weak overcame the strength of the mighty.  Unfortunately for the  Deerfields the powerful continue on their course in Iraq and elsewhere.  Paul Haggis and company found out the same when this movie bombed at the box office, despite being a better than average show.  It might be decades before this kind of look at the Iraq war will shine through the miasma we face now.

At the end, in complete reverse of the beginning, Hank Deerfield instructs the local school custodian to hang the American flag--one which his son sent to him from Iraq--upside down, the universal signal of distress.",1204156800,7,2990,4.751937984496124
3069256,4,B0011V7PSC,"Unparalleled performances, a wickedly thought-provoking story, and masterly direction by ""Crash"" director Paul Haggis skyrocket ""In the Valley of Elah"" to the top of the list of best films of the year. While the story builds slowly, the payoff is intense and brilliantly troubling, and demands repeat viewings. Many will walk away from this film with contrasting interpretations of the conspiratorial nature of the army and the detrimental effect war has on human lives, but everyone will undoubtedly leave entertained.

Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones) makes a trip to an army base in search of his son Mike, who is reported as having gone missing. Shortly after his arrival, badly burned body parts are discovered in a field near a gun shop and they are identified as being the remains of Mike. Heartbroken and angry, Hank sets out to discover the heavily guarded truths behind his son's death and those responsible for this heinous crime. Along the way, Detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron), a local cop taking pity on Deerfield's situation, takes extra measures to ensure that the truth is uncovered.

A deceptively simple murder mystery, In the Valley of Elah uncovers the plot behind a vicious murder that entwines the U.S. Army and a neighboring town. Essentially a vehicle for Haggis to comment on the chaos of the Iraqi War, the mixture of crime, drama, suspense and action make this both an engaging and thought-provoking exercise in filmmaking. The film builds very slowly, but it's careful to introduce just enough new elements in each scene that the plot thickens with masterful precision. Occasionally the pacing is off, with the introduction of unnecessary elements that could have been cut to speed up the progression, but the time spent on developing characters is largely appropriate.

Tommy Lee Jones fleshes out a deep, complex character that lives by a strict sense of honor, influenced heavily by the discipline of the Army for which he served as a sergeant for many years. He is anxious to correct those who are ignorant about the importance of patriotism, such as preventing a U.S. flag from touching the ground and absolutely not raising it upside down, which symbolizes a state of disorder and disarray. Yet as he uncovers more about the tragic death of his son and breaks several laws to seek truths and vengeance, he begins to wizen to the corrupted clockwork of the Army and its intense defense of image and members. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, Tommy Lee Jones delivers one of the best performances of his career.

Charlize Theron's Emily is tough and stern and battles discrimination and prejudice within the police force because she is a woman. Her determination and stubbornness rival that of Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling (from The Silence of the Lambs), and her performance is equally Oscar worthy. Aiding Hank in his mission of justice, she takes hints from his uncanny intelligence, as well as uncovering key clues that draw the shocking conclusion closer. A true hero who isn't afraid to partake in action, including chasing suspects through grungy dark alleys, Theron's character is also fully developed with a wide range of emotions and complexity to match Jones.

Susan Sarandon's supporting performance as the strong but concerned mother of Mike is powerful and tear-inducing and was sadly forgotten for the 2008 Oscars. Other supporting cast including Frances Fisher, Josh Brolin and the many soldiers involved in the conspiracy, deliver emotional and striking performances that demand the spotlight.

The nature of murder mysteries is to build to an unforgettable and unpredictable conclusion, and it accomplishes the detailed setup to the satisfyingly alarming finale quite well. With the intensity of The Silence of the Lambs and an equally baffling title for anyone unfamiliar with the Biblical reference, In the Valley of Elah was one of the first Oscar-worthy films of 2007, and an excellent follow-up to Paul Haggis' critically and commercially acclaimed ""Crash"".

3069257,3,B0011V7PSC,"While I will excuse ""Chicago"" for winning Best Picture since it was at least a little fun, I thought ""Crash"" was one of the worst Best Picture winners in many years. With its overwrought, simplistic approach and lack of any real character development, the film might as well just had characters say ""racism is bad"" every 10 minutes. ""In the Valley of Elah"", Paul Haggis' directorial followup, one can say that he's getting a bit better and even improving in key areas but he falls back on the simple tricks and story conceits that plagued all throughout Crash. It's a good film and I like what it's about, I just don't like the way we get it.

Hank Deerfield is a former Vietnam veteran with a very strong view that the US needs the Military and that none of its uses or personnel are at fault for anything. His son, Mike, who returns from Iraq, is listed as AWOL and Hank tries to find him. Instead of just finding a soldier cutting loose and having fun becomes a bit more as mysteries need to be solved and truths have to be revealed, even if they are truths you didn't even think were possible.

One thing that drove me nuts in ""Crash"", as well as most of Haggis' scripts, is that rather than let the audience figure something out for themselves, the film will not only do it for you but will do it frequently in case you missed it the first time. While Elah isn't as bad, it does end up slipping back into his old routine of having overt symbolism such as its title, taken from the Bible where David met Goliath, which is recounted twice. Could David be the hardworking, tax-paying citizens and Goliath is the government? Or the military? Or the evildoers? Granted it at least allows a story to breathe this time but with things like the Biblical story, as well as its closing shot which is as overt as anything, it's still a small nag.

The film's story itself is interesting and there's a couple interesting tidbits or trivia such as car colors or the upside down flag that I didn't know before but one of the things basically required in a mystery is a drive, a sense of propulsion that makes us ache to see how it would unfold. While the idea of the story is interesting, it's how it was presented that bugged me and the film just sort of....was for the entire film, never really becoming exciting or intriguing. Thank god for Tommy Lee Jones though who brings out another great performance as Hank who says more with his eyes than some shouted ""look at me Oscars, I'm yelling!"" speech. The others are good like Charlize Theron who does another non-glam role and while underutilized, we do get James Franco and Susan Sarandon as well as 2007's comeback kid Josh Brolin who appeared in no less than 4 big movies (this, American Gangster, No Country for Old Men and Grindhouse).

3069260,5,B0011V7PSC,"In recent years, there has been little film work by Tommy Lee Jones that has not been worthy of viewing. Nominated for an Oscar for this movie, though he probably will lose, he is well deserving.

In the wee hours of the morning, occasionally a movie will totally capture my interest and sleep becomes a secondary concern. This was such a film. Tommy Lee Jones, portraying the father of a soldier, receives a phone message from the young man's base in the Southwest advising the father of the soldier's AWOL status. The father, Hank, sure that the young man is still in Iraq, realizes something is seriously wrong and embarks upon his own investigation of his son's disappearance.

This story was based on actual events, which adds poignancy to the film. Hank, an ex-military man himself, who still lives by military code and formality, immediately drives to his son's base to find out what happened. The boy's mother, played by Susan Sarandon, is equally strong but has a limited part in the film. Hank uncovers questionable activity as soon as he arrives - things he didn't believe his son of being involved with; but suspends disbelief in the interests of arriving at the truth. He uncovers the seamier side of soldiers at play, bolstered by a camera cell phone of his son's that he surreptitiously lifts while visiting his son's Army quarters.

He enlists the assistance of Charlize Theron, in another unglamorous role for her as a homicide detective; she somewhat mirrors aspects of her ""North Country"" role as a strong, smart woman up against the boorish macho boys on her squad, stuck doing the pathetic oddball cases of homicide until Hank's son turns up dismembered and burned in a field near the base. Hank, who desperately needs an ally in a place where no one knows him, no one wants to help him, and where the true tale is being covered up anyway, gets through Charlise's character's wall of defense, and between them they find a world neither really wanted to discover; how war, in the present age, desensitizes, dulls the senses of right and wrong, makes monsters of people who were children only bare years before.

If Tommy Lee Jones gets the Oscar for this movie, it will be well-earned; with his dogged determination to get at the truth, he spares his character nothing, and follows every lead. He probably would have made an outstanding detective. Charlize, also, continues to prove that she is not just a pretty face, but a savvy and effective dramatic actor.

3069261,2,B0011V7PSC,"I am active duty military so I know what I'm talking about when I say this. Not only that, but I have visited the base (Ft. Hood) that this movie takes place around several times.

This may have been intended to be an anti-war movie, but it is to me, an anti-military movie. It depicts the Army as a bunch of country bumpkin losers who all do drugs and love killing people. The fact is is that we all have random drug tests several times a year, and if we were hiding anything like a pot pipe in our barracks, it would be found by the officers who perform our room inspections every day. Drug use in the military is a terminal offense. If you are caught, you get kicked right out after one offense. Another point I would like to mention is that our rules of engagement (do not fire unless fired upon) regularly put our men and women in danger, get them injured and sometimes even killed. While casualties are inevitable, our current military does more than has probably ever been done in history to prevent them from happening.

Regarding the running over of the little girl, and the messing with dead bodies; I must sadly admit the messing with bodies does happen. It is the charge of the platoon leaders to ensure that this kind of conduct does not happen and they need to do their job as most of them do. I guarantee that no one in my chain of command will be getting away with any of this kind of conduct. Regarding the running over of the little girl, I've never heard of an order like that, BUT the unfortunate fact of modern war is that little children, old women, pregnant women WILL come out with bombs under their dresses, in their purses etc. to kill soldiers. If they are in a combat area and the girl does not move out of the way as told / warned / honked at / etc. I can see that this could become a necessity. Having one vehicle taken out by a harmless looking civilian can cause great damage to an effort to hold or take an area, not to mention the several American lives that could be lost by ignoring the possible threat. A career soldier like the main character in this movie (Tommy Lee Jones' character) would know better. Especially being a Vietnam vet as I think he was, he would know that these types of things have been minimized to a high degree compared to the Vietnam era. If he was so distressed about what happened in this war, he would have deserted during the Vietnam war.

I give this movie 2 stars because the story was somewhat engaging, and while I do find the general theme insulting, I don't think it was as bad as some of the other leftist movies out there.

3069262,5,B0011V7PSC,"Highly emotionally charged, topped with excellent performances from three Academy Awards winners (Jones, Theron and Sarandon), ""In the Valley of Elah"" is a compelling drama about a Vietnam war veteran Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones), who finds out that his son Mike went missing shortly after returning from Iraq, in October 2004. Already having lost one son who was serving in the Army, Hank sets off to find his son.

What Hank did not expect was to find Mike's butchered and charred remains in a bare field close to a military base.  Hank, knowing the tight-lipped military investigatory services, decides to ask for help from the local police department.  A detective (Charlize Theron) decides to help Hank in his search for truth and Mike's killer.  Through this process Hank discovers truths about his son through Mike's videos made in Iraq, truths that Hank never wanted to believe.

Fantastic performances and true to life accounts (the film is based on actual events) make ""In the Valley of Elah"" a great movie, one that has nothing to do with political opinions of our presence in Iraq.  Just like some truths about our soldiers in Vietnam came out after the fact, some truths are starting to come out now about our soldiers in Iraq.  I should know, as I have two Iraq tours behind me.

3069263,5,B0011V7PSC,"As this country continues to struggle with the tragedies inflicted upon all who are being singed and scorched by the Iraq War (and that includes every citizen of this country, whether directly or indirectly), films addressing this war are wither avoided by the theatrical audiences or cause flare reactions of judgment.  Into this milieu writer (with Mark Boal) and director Paul Haggis places this painful examination of the effects and aftershocks of war in the persona of a father whose only son is reported as 'missing' after he has returned from his tour of duty in Iraq.  By keeping the story focused on the effect of the devastation on one man Haggis makes his point all the more clear, and the result is one of the finest documents of the insanity of war that has been released in some years.

Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones) has served in the military and encouraged both his sons to serve their country (much against the emotional reaction of his wife Joan - Susan Sarandon): his older son is killed in a helicopter crash and his younger son, recently returned from a year's duty in Iraq, is reported as missing. Hank drives to the base where his son was stationed, learns of his son's death 'by friendly fire' at home, and tries t enlist the help of the military to investigate the affair without success. He encounters a sullen police detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron) who appears bruised by life in general and by her prejudiced co-workers and military men in particular. Gradually Emily sides with the grieving Hank to explore the horrid details of Hank's son's brutal murder, dismemberment and burning.  Despite endless barriers of red tape and military secrecy lead by Lt. Kirklander (Jason Patric) both Emily and Hank slowly piece together the truth, using email videos Hank's son had sent him from Iraq, interviews with Hank's son's fellow soldiers, and examination of the body parts of Hank's son.  Once the truth is out the effects on all concerned reveal the inevitable permanent scars of war on all concerned.  Yet it is the strength of character as revealed in Hank's responses that drive home the pungent message of this difficult film.

Tommy Lee Jones gives the most subtle performance of his fine career as the grieving yet stoic Hank.  Charlize Theron once again proves that she can disappear into a demanding role like few other actresses.  Susan Sarandon, Jason Patric, James Franco (in a tiny but pivotal role), Josh Brolin, Frances Fisher (in a cameo that is very impressive), and all the young men who play the soldiers involved in the investigation are superb.  The film pulls no punches, yet it also refrains from sensationalizing events - as though Haggis realized that the truth was viciously cruel enough without embellishment.  Special mention should be paid to the fine musical score by Mark Isham, a pulsating, minimalist background that heightens the effect of the film.  This may be a difficult film to watch but it is a necessary experience if we are to constantly re-evaluate our philosophy of war and intervention.

3069264,4,B0011V7PSC,"First of all, I have no idea why this movie was panned or lauded during its theatrical release as some kind of statement for or against the Iraq war. After having watched it, the political ramifications of that war are, in my opinion, totally irrelevant to this movie as a work of entertainment. There have been atrocities in every war since tribes were clubbing each other with mastodon bones, so let's just put that aside.

Having been raised in the military as an Army brat -- and being a veteran myself -- I really love movies oriented toward military subjects, and this movie doesn't disappoint. In many ways, it's territory we've explored before in movies such as ""The Caine Mutiny"", ""A Few Good Men"", ""Basic"", ""The General's Daughter"", ""Rules of Engagement"" (another Jones movie), and many others. Why this one was castigated as being anti-war in any special way is totally beyond me.

We have a stellar cast in what is essentially a ""Courage Under Fire"" genre movie, a Rashomon scenario, wherein Tommy Lee Jones -- the father of a murdered vet -- tries to uncover the details of his son's murder with the help of an outcast female police detective played by Charlize Theron.

Jones is always a marvel to watch, and the supporting cast is also top notch: Josh Brolin, Jason Patric, Susan Sarandon, Francis Fisher (in a gutsy role for a middle-aged woman), as well as the lesser lights.

But in my opinion, Charlize Theron stole this show, hands down.

Having won an Oscar for her incredible performance as the serial killer in ""Monster"" a couple of years back (and keeping in mind her physical transformation for that role), and also bearing in mind her usual public persona as a beautiful woman gracing the red carpet in a slinky gown, it would be easy to dismiss her as a one-hit wonder who got lucky a couple of years ago.

This movie disproves that idea. Though she doesn't transform herself as grotesquely for this role, it's actually a much more subtle and sublime transformation, which in my opinion makes her success in the role even more difficult. Where in ""Monster"" she could hide herself behind the grotesquery of the physical transformation, in this movie she simply makes herself...... plain.

How much harder it is to be a distinctive blade of grass than it is to be a toadstool.

I can't believe she wasn't nominated again for this role.

ANYway.... I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, especially for that performance, but it also worked very well on all levels.",1203465600,40,2482,4.766899766899767
3069265,5,B0011V7PSC,"I have been writing the comprehensive true story behind the murder of Richard Davis titled ""Murder In Baker Company, the forgotten soldier."" I've seen the film several times and even though it is fictionalized, I never cease to be amazed at the thread of truth which runs through Elah from beginning to end. The script was actually written before any major details of the case were available; the trials had not taken place. Yet Paul Haggis instinctively had his finger on the pulse of this tragedy and the far-reaching effects of THIS war. It's absolutely uncanny when I stop to think about Elah's prophetic substance. And whether planned or not, Tommy Lee Jones' performance eerily captures the essence of Lanny Davis right to the core. The film is a labor of love for everyone involved.

This war is different, as they all are. There are very specific issues behind the dramatic increase in PTSD and the violence following our men and women home. Issues that could be avoided if it were not for the profiteering, apathetic system of government in charge of our troops. Everything that is wrong with this war played a role in the events leading to Army Specialist Richard Davis' murder. It is a horrific tragedy that unfortunately serves as a beacon for the truth.

Do you also think that ""E/R"" depicts the daily activities in a hospital?  This movie is a work of fiction.  It does not factually portray the happenings in Iraq, or the heroic actions of our servicemen.  It does, however, serve as a medium for its creators to sway public opinion (Susan Sarandon, anyone?)  And to the poster above who thinks the military is trained to run people over....are you kidding me?

If anyone is wanting to watch a movie that will actually help them learn about the Iraq war, they must wait a little longer.  None of the movies currently out on the subject are remotely relevant.  The programs on The Discovery Channel, The History Channel, and The Military Channel are currently the closest sources you will get to what actually happened/is happening there, without the anti-war distortions (and they don't portray each and every servicemember as a criminal in order to force their political and social positions on their viewers.)

3303540,3,B0011V7PSC,"In The Valley of Elah is a rahter good effort but there are some things about it that seem rather flawed and dragged. Tommy Lee Jones takes about 20 seconds in the film to walk over from a field to a car, the scenes are predictable, the film lacks action being a true story, fathers and mothers are more likely to like it. I couldn't help but feel that many scenes in the ""film"" were repeated. I understand it was based on a true story, I don't think it's the editing which was lacking, I just felt the impact of the film, overall, was quite measly.

Let me mention that Charlize Theron is very beautiful. Of course, she is miscast yet she's definitely the film's strongest point. Her character is that of a single mother ,her way of fighting ""wrong"" is by stating what's right and never raising her voice. Some scenes were well depicted because they were believable but the scenes featuring the American flag were done over the top. In a way, very film and rather incongruent to the story's issue at hands.

There are no bad guys in the film for you to dislike. Susan Sarandon appears in the first scene and I was a bit delighted to see her but she hardly has any role except the one scene where you might see her howl. I'm not sure if it's just me who took notice but isn't Theron a bit too beautiful to be interested in being a detective, she looks remarkably easy and settled in the film yet real.

The end is a bit strange but you might just be too yawned by then.
Strengths : Charlize Theron, a sturdy character represented by Tommy Lee Jones

Weaknesses : Not meant for all audiences, direction tried to play it a bit too much by the book, some scenes irritating you because characters seldom display anger

Remarks : If you liked United 93, you will like this. If you're looking for something to make you go ""Whoa"" , it is only the last ten minutes that might do that but by then the effect will be dwindled because the film seems lackluster for a bit too long.",1202428800,15,1969,4.3108108108108105
3303541,5,B0011V7PSC,"There have been many films about the aftermath of war, but never have I seen such a brutally honest and shocking depiction of the de-humanization of soldiers back from war. This is the underlying premise of the new crime thriller from academy award winning writer/director Paul Haggis (Crash).

Hank Deerfield (played by Tommy Lee Jones) is a retired veteran and military police officer searching for his son who has gone AWOL. A detective Emily Sanders (played by Charlize Theron) becomes interested in the case and starts helping Hank outside of her job. When Hank's son's body is found, the search suddenly turns into a search for the murderer.

One of the many aspects I appreciated was that director Haggis did not turn this into a typical Hollywood crime thriller and also not turn it into a political propaganda piece against the war and President Bush. Instead he mixes the two plots together seamless and subtle, letting you decide for your self.

Tommy Lee Jones gives the best performance of his long career as he plays a quiet, emotionless war vet, but still shows tremendous amount of emotion. Just watching his face as he sits in a diner and listens to one of his retired friends tell him about plans to go visit his grandchildren is heartbreaking. We can almost see the internal emotional struggle as he realizes he will never be able to do that. Charlize Theron does a wonderful job as the detective, and despite her small screen time Susan Surandon plays the grieving wife of Jones to perfection.

This film is such a moving masterpiece on so many levels it is simply wonderful to watch. The quiet pacing of the film building up to the climax is captivatingly intense in its own way. I am sure this will be a popular film at the Oscars this year, and if they gave out awards for best scene this would be sure to garner a nomination for a simple, poignant, yet profoundly moving scene when Frank tells the story of David and Goliath (which took place in the Valley of Elah) to the little son of detective Sanders.",1202256000,67,2029,4.659217877094972
3303542,5,B0011V7PSC,"This past weekend, we saw the first truly great movie to come out thus far on the terrible subject of the unfolding American disgrace in Iraq. ""In the Valley of Elah"" is that movie, and we strongly recommend it to all, not just for its entertainment value, which is significant, but more for its importance in displaying for all to see the horror of this ill conceived adventure in its most human terms.

The story involves Hank Deerfield, brilliantly played by Tommie Lee Jones, a retired military police investigator, whose son, Mike, has been deployed with his Army unit in Iraq. Deerfield receives the call at his Tennessee home that his son has gone AWOL from his Army barracks. Deerfield replies that this can't be so: his son is in Iraq. No, the caller informs him. The unit has returned, and Mike is gone from the base. He'd better get back ""pronto"".

Deerfield tries to raise his son on the cell phone, to no avail. He senses something wrong, and sets off to the Army base to discover what it is. On the way, a significant, though symbolic scene takes place. Deerfield observes a flag flying in front of a school. But the flag is flying upside down, a sign of distress. Deerfield investigates, only to find that the immigrant janitor was unaware of this important aspect of flag etiquette.

Arriving at the base, Deerfield finds his son is still missing. Army CID is no help. And neither are the civilian authorities. And then the mutilated corpse of his son shows up near the base. It appears that Army CID wants to suppress the case. Deerfield turns to the civilian authorities. But the authority in this small town is rather suspect, represented by Charlize Theron in a wonderfully understated role as the civilian detective.

Deerfield and the female investigator form an unlikely duo and finally solve the gruesome crime. But that is only half the story. What they discover is the depravity that the young soldiers have come to through their involvement in this brutal, absurd conflict.

A terribly important, and possibly overlooked, scene occurs at the home of the female investigator. Deerfield tucks in her young son and, eschewing ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"", tells the lad the story of David in the Valley of Elah. David, the little shepherd boy is the only one of the Israelites who can overcome his fear of the monstrous giant, Goliath. He chooses to fight both his fear and the giant. And he wins, against all odds and logic. This is the essential message of this very important film. Goliath represents the power of the modern state, what Hobbes styled as Leviathon. David represents all of us who, rather than cower in fear of this monstrosity, have the courage to take it on.

Some have styled the ending of this movie as ""over the top"". I strongly disagree with this assessment. In my view, the ending is perfectly understated, and extremely powerful. This country is, indeed, now in distress. And those who truly care need to act and act now. False ""conservatives"", like the mendacious Michael Medved hate this movie. This is so because it well illustrates the total bankruptcy of their insane policies. It is a great and terribly important movie. See it. Pick up five small, smooth stones. And have no fear!",1201996800,43,3248,4.75
3303543,5,B0011V7PSC,"The movie shows the devastation that this war causes to America. It does this with high intensity and without any cheap political shots. One might even say it manages to keep its subject out of the political area. It does not discuss the question whether the invasion ought to have been done in first place, it only shows how the role of occupiers in a civil war constellation destroys the life of the soldiers of the occupying force. Its subject is not the dead on either side, but the destruction in the souls and minds of those who survive.
The movie shows that Hollywood has not become entirely irrelevant; it is an argument against those who claim that Hollywood has nothing to add to civilization, or that its influence is only devaluing morality.
It also shows that films can be made with more than making money in mind.
And a personal lesson: if you ever receive signals of distress from your son or daughter, please listen, or you might have to regret it like T.L.Jones.",1199059200,20,979,4.6

3303547,4,B0011V7PSC,"Released in 2007 and directed & written by Paul Haggis, In the Valley of Elah is a crime drama/mystery inspired by the real-life case of Richard T. Davis. The story revolves around an elderly Tennessee couple (Tommy Lee Jones & Susan Sarandon) who get word that their son has gone missing from his base in New Mexico shortly after his return from Iraq. A retired military investigator, Hank Deerfield (Jones) goes to the base to find out the awful truth. Charlize Theron plays the civilian detective near the base who tries to help Hank while Jason Patric plays the Army counterpart. Josh Brolin is on hand as the town police chief.

This is a slow-burn mystery highlighted by great acting by the principals, especially Jones, and a thoroughly realistic story, which isn't surprising seeing as how its based on true events. Speaking of which, I was surprised to find out that the basic details of the story are all accurate. The actual events took place in the Fort Benning area of Georgia rather than the fictitious Fort Rudd, NM.

The movies not anti-Iraq War, but rather anti-PTSD; it merely reveals the awful truth about war in general: When we send our young men off to far-off lands where brutal warfare is normal they can bring that desensitized mentality back with them where the barbaric behavior that might be acceptable in war is anything but normal or conducive to a successful life, to say the least. Add the idiocy of alcohol abuse to the mix of PTSD and the results almost certainly WONT be good.

The title refers to the valley where David, as a teen, fought and defeated the utterly intimidating Goliath from 1 Samuel 17.

ADDITIONAL ACTORS: James Franco, Wes Chatham, Jake McLaughlin, Mehcad Brooks and Roman Arabia play soldiers who knew Deerfields son while Frances Fisher has a curious cameo (youll know what I mean).

The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in Whiteville, Tennessee, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, with Morocco substituting for Iraq.

As the father of someone currently serving in combat operations, and as a chaplain that ministers to veterans, this film is appalling in its betrayal of those serving overseas and the role of volunteer citizen soldiers.  In an attempt to portray the main character as a Bible thumping, overly macho, wacko Vietnam vet,  Jones refers to ancient Israel as 'Palestine"", a term that was never used historically.  From there, the John Kerryish narrative of U.S. military torturing Iraqis and returning home as psychotic, drunken, heroin smoking wife killers unfolds.  As the Vietnam vet with his own ghosts realizes that all of the television spots of G.W. Bush constantly in the background have created a generation of murderous American zombies that must be kept on base, he is last seen flying the American flag sent home by his son and used on missions upside down.  This film is a giant middle finger to all of those who have served and their loved ones.

3303560,3,B0011V7PSC,"I rented this movie after the strong recommendation a good friend, a retired Colonel; I was sorely confused and disappointed. It became obvious that no military consultants were used in the making of  ""In the Valley of Elah"". When you hire a cast such as Jones, Sarandon and Charlize Theron, it would be wise to put them in a vehicle with power. This movie started out slow, which sometimes proceeds a powerful and engrossing climax and conclusion, not so in this movie. It became obvious almost immediately that the film had an anti-military, soldiers are all one step from climbing a tower with a rifle nuts, message with no basis in reality only one based on prejudice and misinformation. The first sign was: ""Sir""; you do not call an NCO sir and you damn sure don't salute a civilian one.
Tommy Lee Jones' performance was good, although one dimensional, Susan Sarandon's part was so thin that any actor could have pulled it off. The only redeeming aspect of the whole film was Charlize Theron's amazing ability to morph into a complex character seamlessly, although even that was formulaic and poorly written.
It seems to me that this movie had a message, the military and our boy's are drug fueled, stripper chasing, psychopathic torturers who once back in America are time bombs waiting to explode. Even the good old boy abuse of a pretty woman in a man's world is so much of  ""A Priori Argument"" as to be juvenile. Poor movie, stereotypical, preconceived, prejudiced, confusing and transparent.

3303561,5,B0011V7PSC,"This grim and superbly casted film reminds its viewer that war isn't over when the boys come home. Too often, it gets inside the boys and lurches on in quiet, painful and sometimes devastating directions.

Yet Tommy Lee Jones and Charlize Theron have not lent their formidable gifts to a monotone anti-war flick. The film's focus does not ascend to the larger question of the war in Iraq and its justification or the absence thereof. The lens is far more personal than that. A gritty man's son has been inexplicably murdered. The film opens with the deep irony that Jones' Hank Deerfield knew where his son was when he was in far-away Iraq, but the boy goes missing immediately upon his return to the US.

Susan Sarandon's Joan Deerfield appears relatively briefly, but long enough for her powerful presence to communicate a mother's calamitous grief in spades.

It is largely up to Jones' Deerfield and Theron's underrated Detective Emily Sanders to provide the grim grit and relentless investigative rigor that will not let things go until solved. The other characters in this drama would prefer to sweep things under the rug, let sleeping dogs lie, and otherwise not get to the awful bottom of a returned platoon that has turned in upon itself.

This is not an easy film to watch. In this reviewer's eyes, it chooses not to wave flags for or against the larger arguments of war.

Also, there are numerous reviews here about the similarities/differences between the actual events the movie is based upon. I would agree this is an anti-war film, yet disagree that reflecting upon the horrors of war and what it does to some is an entirely bad thing. There's a HUGE difference between anti-war and anti-American which some have seem to have forgotten. While conflicts may sometimes become necessary, even unavoidable, we should all be anti-war in hopes that it can be avoided and lives not be lost.

3303607,5,B0011V7PSC,"Yes, it is about the fall-out of war and some people will hate this film because they feel it is too political.  Others will love it for the same reason.  So, if you are just shopping be aware that this is an issue.  Reading the one star reviews will give you a clear sense of how others feel about it.

Here I'm just discussing the merits of the film and it rates very high in my opinion.  I had a teacher once who said that any work of art should be judged according to how well it succeeded at its own aims.  The film is based on a true incident which has been somewhat fictionalized.  Again, you can get more background information from some of the other reviews.

The story is about one man, a retired military man, whose life seems to have been built around military service.  He carries his spit and polish discipline with him, even now that he's delivering concrete at home in Tennessee.  His two sons were raised, according to his wife, in an atmosphere where they could not have not gone into service themselves.  One was killed in combat, before the film opens and at the beginning of the film we learn that, the other one has been reported AWOL.  Soon the charred and mutilated remains of his body have been found near the base where he was stationed.  The father, brilliantly played by the superb Tommy Lee Jones, goes to the base and does everything he can to discover just what happened.

While there he lifts his son's cell phone from his room and gets someone to decipher the film that the son has made in Iraq.  The contents are garbled and unclear but a horrible picture  gradually emerges as the father digs further into the crime.  Helping him, and sometimes hindering him,is a local police officer, played by Charlize Theron.  There is a certain amount of business about conflicts of jurisdiction between the civil police and the military police that occupies much of the story.

I won't tell more....only to say that the film is stunning in its revelation of how the son actually died. It has stayed with me for days.  Jones is brilliant, as I've already said.  Susan Sarandon is very good as the mother who has lost both sons to the war.  Theron is ok as the police officer.  She looks good but somehow I didn't find her convincing in the tougher aspects of her job.  Her character was pure fiction, not drawn from reality and it shows.  It seems like they wanted a  glamorous  star for audience appeal.
She's not terrible, though, and her performance doesn't detract from the power of the picture.

The point of the film is to show the transformation of the Jones character as he discovers what happened to his son. In an early scene we see him stopping to correct a janitor who has mistakenly hung an American flag upside down outside a school.  At the end, we see him return, to hang his son's own flag, and this time he hangs it deliberately upside down.  It's a stunning moment. I highly recommend the film.",1400630400,,2936,4.47457627118644
3303608,5,B0011V7PSC,Very good movie....great story line....great actors....kept my attention the whole movie....I would highly recommend it.  Makes you think about how going on a tour of duty really affects our soldiers.,1395532800,,200,5.666666666666667
3303609,5,B0011V7PSC,"Very good to the end of the story.  When there are people who will ""do the right thing"" eventually the truth does come out.  Some military leaders show little in the way of concern for the ones who do not always do the right thing.

The police can be very uninterested when it does not serve them personally.  Thanks to those who leave ""no stone unturned"" to find the real truth.",1393632000,,379,4.295774647887324

3303627,5,B0011V7PSC,"Many people try and watch ""a movie based on actual events"" like it portrays facts and the truth.  Nope, it's a movie, not a documentary.  I compare all ""movies"" to novels, and those doing the writing can take all the artistic license they want with the facts and storyboard.  Documentaries I compare to non-fiction, and the writers better get the facts straight, making clear distinctions between truth and conjecture.  ""In the Valley of Elah"" is a movie, not a documentary.

The ""actual events"" upon which the movie is based are atrocious and heartbreaking.  The same characterization occurs in the movie.  The full facts of the actual murder were never revealed by the court.  The movie wraps things up a little too quickly.  Although there is quite a bit of artistic license in the movie, it wove many of the actual facts into the plot.  That said, the characters were strong, the plot patiently revealed, and the message clear about how the inhumanity of war can change people.

Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Sarandon were the perfect decades married couple.  Tommy Lee's character and his calculating patience was powerful.  Charlize Theron, with bare makeup, was outstanding as the woman trying to make her mark in a man's world.

As a veteran, what I found refreshing was the underlying theme of the movie; the contrasting expectations of soldiers brutally adapting on the battlefield with their peaceful adaptation back into safety and security after a brief 24 hour flight home. As anyone can tell you who has faced the continuous and indifferent threat of death, that transition takes time.",1376697600,6,1596,4.951127819548872

It is loosely based on actual events and shows an ugly side of the military.  A father is searching for answers about his missing son, but as he uncovers the truth, I think he gets more than what he bargains for.  He finds out that his son had serious flaws.  Rather than being comforted by learning the truth, I would think he would be ashamed of it. We can kind of understand what causes these soldiers to act the way they do after what they have seen and done, but there are lies upon lies before we learn the so-called truth. I felt empty when it was over.  It is an unfortunate story.",1374364800,,702,4.2406015037593985

It's a movie for C's-sake, from Hollywood - the place that makes movies for money - for C's-sake. Each and everyone of YOU adds BS to all your own stories. The bottom line is: until there's a movie written by THE DEAD from times like these - you all are just wagging tongues. I (too subjectively for some no doubt) always think of the last verses to ""Powderfinger"" by Neil Young. ""Raised my rifle to my eye, never stopped to wonder why, then I saw black, and my face splash in the sky. Just think of me as one you'd never figure could fade away so young, leaving so much left undone. Remember me to my love, I know I'll miss her."" Close enough? And regardless of how noble/ignoble. righteous or unrighteous etc etc etc.the cause might or might not have been, I'd bet that ANY of the survivors who lost loved ones, if they could, would have them back, if they could. I know from having a son of my own, whom I love and never want to leave, that I share the sentiment expressed (by the deceased) in another song (""Vivian"" - Delta Spirit) : ""Sleep oh sleep, my Vivian, Heaven is too cold without you. Well I'll stay right here above the clouds, waiting to see heaven with you.""

3303643,5,B0011V7PSC,"In The Valley of Elah is a true story, that follows the disappearance and murder of a solider, recently returning home from Iraq. Tommy Lee Jones plays that soldiers father, a retired Military Police Officer, who launches his own investigation, and he continues to be the best actor I've ever seen. Jones rightfully received an Academy Award Nomination for this role and really should have won. No matter the film, no matter if it's good or bad, Jones simply steals the show and makes it work. Charlize Theron was also terrific as the Detective who wanted to solve the case that nobody else wanted. In most things I've seen her in, I didn't like her, but here her performance actually rivals Jones's. This film is extremely well written and very methodical. If The Valley of Elah can't keep your attention and have you on the edge of seat, talking to the screen, than nothing else will. This is honestly one of the best written, acted, and important films I've seen in a very long time.

3303645,3,B0011V7PSC,"I will limit this review to the watchability of the movie as entertainment. First of all it grabs your attention and presents itself as something outside of the traditional Hollywood mold. Second, the movie is sad and depressing and leaves one feeling a little the worse for wear. Third the acting is outstanding and conveys a range of emotions that is moving and convincing. Tommy Lee Jones does a captivating job as the bereaved and anxious father, Hank Deerfield, who is initially searching for his son and then later the truth.

Charlize Theron is highly effective as police detective Emily Sanders who refuses to take no for an answer. I am amazed by her ability to look so different in different movies; I found it hard to believe she was the same person who played the part of Aeon Flux in the movie of the same name. Although Susan Sarandon's role as Joan Deerfield is limited she brings her extraordinary talent to bear in those scenes she has and powerfully conveys the distress of a mother who has lost her son.

This is not a movie for children; it is justifiably rated R and is filled with four letter words, some severed body parts, and occasional sexual nudity. I will not watch it again.",1360800000,3,1203,4.616822429906542

3303649,5,B0011V7PSC,"I'll admit I was a little leary about this movie. I had never heard of it. But it starred Tommy Lee Jones; who, in my humble opinion, is one of the finest actors in America. The film has so many layers. I've seen reviews that stated that Tommy Lee's performance was wooden and lacked emotion. To me, he was more like a man that was keeping his emotions barely at bay. He wanted to understand why his son was brutally murdered and mutilated. Sure, he could have been screaming and yelling at everyone, but never gets anyone anywhere. Most people that have served in the military knows that.

Mr. Jones is surrounded by a great cast. Charlize Theron as a cop that people think can't handle anything besides domestic disputes and lost dogs, Susan Sarandon as the mother who has lost one son already and has just lost her second son. Even Jason Patrick turns in a great performance as a representative of the JAG. All turned in above the bar performances.

The plot is based on an actual event. This brings a sense of realism to the movie. I mean, let's face, it's hard to find a character driven mystery anymore. It seems that all Hollywood wants to do it spit out movies that compete with each other as to who can create the largest explosion or highest body count. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy these as much as the next guy. But when a film like this comes along, it should be pushed and advertised with the same zeal.

Tommy Lee Jones, a retired military investigator, may have been hauling gravel for the twenty years since he took his pension, but single-handed he can still find more useful evidence in five minutes than a squad of active professionals working overtime. He is also the stereotype of the loyal ex-soldier who still lives in the military after years on civvy street. He's so bottled up that he can scarcely speak.

Charlize Theron is the courageous detective who tries to ignore the sexist boors she works with because she's the only one in the office who is willing to Seek The Truth.

Susan Sarandon does an unnecessary turn as a grieving military mother, unnecessary because the plot could proceed perfectly well without her. Stoking up the emotional fires seems to be her character's principal raison d'etre.

It's never clear what exactly brought about Mike Deerfield's gruesome murder. Because the final explanation we're offered may still be the Army's lie, we don't find out who's responsible.

You will never see acting any better than in this film.  It is hard to say that you would ""enjoy"" this movie like it would be hard to ""enjoy"" Saving Private Ryan.

This is a great movie with great actors turning out fantastic performances.  I suggest that you get a regular DVD as there is no scenery or fantastic landscapes that would make you wish you had it on blu-ray.  It is all acting at its best.

Jones plays the roles of father perfectly and draws on his own military experience to aid Theron's character as she investigates the death further. The story is interspersed with footage the son shot in Iraq on his mobile phone, which fleshes the back story out and leads to a disquieting conclusion. Jones and Theron both acted superbly and Sarandon's role was shamefully small and with a steller supporting cast, the acting was amply taken care of. The storyline was ok, it lacked a certain tension you come to expect from these detective murder type stories, but it still managed to get you second guessing and intrigued whilst you watched. I feel Jones performance in `No Country For Old Men' to be better than this, but he certainly seems to be on a roll at the moment, picking class acting roles and performing them to perfection. For a couple of hours of solid acting and a fairly good murder thriller type story, set against the timely backdrop of the US war in Iraq, you can't do mush better than this. Worth a look.

3303656,4,B0011V7PSC,"I can certainly see why this film is controversial. I personally liked it and assumed it was about a single terrible and tragic incident and was not true of every man and woman who served and serves in Iraq. There are critics of the film who think the film is saying negative messages about all the men and women who serve in Iraq, which I don't think is the case with this film. Basically the film tells the story of a career military father searching for his son and then searching for his son's killers. This poor father discovers more than he imagined about his son, the killers, and the conditions in Iraq that may make some individuals act out in a violent manner when they return to the United States. Tommy Lee Jones plays Hank Deerfield, who is a retired military police officer. He meets brick walls in his investigation of his son's disappearance. He is joined in his search by police detective Emily Sanders, played by Charlize Theron, who realizes that the pieces of the puzzle don't add up in the search for the killer or killers of this young man. She is able to obtain an inside perspective that assists Mr. Deerfield in his search. Do soldiers sometimes use drugs? Do they form strong bonds with the other young males? Do they sometimes engage in violent behavior? Do they sometimes witness violent behavior? Do they sometimes lose themselves in the group or pack mentality? The answer to all these questions is certainly. Thus the film is showing one incident where these factors come together with a tragic outcome and is not meant to be an indictment of men and women in the armed forces. I never suspected that that this was a motive for the film. The film is well acted and thought provoking.

3303657,4,B0011V7PSC,"This film is a loose interpretation of a true story about a man searching to learn what led up to his son's mysterious death after returning from Iraq; however, its real message is far more than that.  Jones' character, Vietnam veteran Hank Deerfield, tells another character the story of David meeting Goliath in the Valley of Elah, a metaphor that runs through every facet of the film, in particular Deerfield's grief.  Indeed, who exactly is the giant Deerfield's son faced that led him to his death?  Deerfield's journey through the effects of PTSD of the newly returned soldiers provokes questions around their ability to discern right and wrong, and shows him that despite his son's earlier pleas for help and to come home, the boy's judgment and empathy was as impaired as his fellow soldiers.  As facts around the son's death are revealed, so, also, is Deerfield's legacy of guilt for pushing his son into service.

Jones and Sarandon delivered fantastic performances, with Theron a little stiff in her role. Some secondary arcs seem out of place in the greater context and don't move the plot along, though they reveal details significant to the supporting cast.  Graphic in some places, such details are no more gritty or gratuitous than the evidence of the scarred psyches of the returning soldiers.  Qualities of this film rare in so many other war films are its ability to show a range of emotion without being sentimental, to show both depravity and desperation without being maudlin, and to deliver a powerfully personal story about a Universal dilemma.",1291075200,4,1568,4.961832061068702
3303658,4,B0011V7PSC,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

The biggest surprise about ""The Valley of Elah"" is how far Paul Haggis has developed as a writer. I felt his screenplay for ""Million Dollar Baby"" was awful: a flimsy, clichd melodrama full of complete one-dimensional characters. Then there was ""Crash"" which certainly was a vast improvement over ""Baby"" but that too had many moments that were too incredible to believe as well as being generally inconsistent. But now along comes ""Elah"", a subtle, murder/detective mystery with cogent social undertones.

""Elah"" operates on two levels--there is of course the main plot of a dogged detective (very capably played by Charlize Theron) who must go up against duo bureaucracies of her own police department and the US Army in order find out who murdered the son of a veteran (a former Military policeman/investigator--Hank Deerfield) played by Tommie Lee Jones. The second level is the more subtle mystery as to what happened to Deerfield's son while he was a soldier in Iraq.

This 'subplot' in some ways proves to be just as fascinating as the solution to the actual murder of the soldier. The subplot is unraveled visually: Deerfield surreptitiously removes his son's cell phone from his room on the base and then has a local underground computer expert extract the digital video from the phone. Throughout the movie, Deerfield is trying to decipher what's going on from the distorted and shaky images captured on the cell phone.

The message of the film is clear--war (and particularly the war in Iraq) can lead to trauma and worse, damage to the psyche of the soldiers who are there to the point where they have become totally desensitized to their own feelings and emotions. To his dismay, Deerfield finds out the truth about his son--that he went from being a fairly normal young man before he went into the Army and ends up desensitized and psychically damaged along with his buddies who end up responsible for his death. Deerfield already knows that things weren't right 'over there' when it's revealed at the end of the film that he received a call from his son while he was still in Iraq, crying over something that happened. A confession by the soldier who murdered Mike Deerfield reveals that he was upset over an incident where he and a partner in a Humvee run over a child. Mike Deerfield is so riddled with guilt that he gets out of his vehicle (despite the danger of being shot by insurgents) and takes a picture of the child's corpse. But we also find out the meaning of Mike's nickname ""Doc""--that there were two sides to the traumatized soldier; one side was guilt-ridden but strong enough to take the picture of the dead Iraqi boy. But he also was a sadist who tortured a prisoner by poking him with a gun in areas on the man's body that had been wounded.

Haggis could have depicted Mike Deerfield as a complete victim of war but oftentimes life is more complex--Mike is both a victim and a victimizer. The main plot also keeps one riveted. At first, the main suspects, Mike's buddies seem to be cleared when a surveillance photo of them returning to base in their car turns up. Later, an Hispanic soldier (who has gone AWOL) is suspected and Hank Deerfield loses his objectivity and tries to beat the fleeing suspect (showing that he's not perfect also). Finally, the case is solved when the detective receives a copy of Mike Deerfield's credit card receipt which is signed by one of the soldiers he was with instead of Mike himself. The soldiers confess but the detective feels thwarted when she learns that the Army and local prosecutor have agreed to reduced sentences for the murderer and his accomplice (a third soldier commits suicide before the arrests out of guilt).

The motive for the murder is chilling--there is no real reason. Just a bunch of drunk soldiers who have no control over impulses due to being desensitized by their experiences of war in Iraq. Of course not all soldiers end up desensitized by war and we probably needed to see a few more ""well-balanced"" Army people in this film. In addition, most of the military and civilian police investigators were pretty negative characters who were determined to stonewall the investigation at every turn. That makes for good drama I suppose, but it wasn't completely realistic.

Haggis's plot was supposedly based on real events. Obviously he needed to compress the action so that the story moved along and kept the audience's interest. Again, much of the chronology of the events in the movie did not seem completely realistic. Still the story is quite gripping and Tommie Lee Jones was excellent in an understated performance. Why wasn't ""Elah"" nominated best picture? It's simple--the Academy believes in spreading out their awards to as many filmmakers as possible. Haggis already has gotten his 'awards' for Million Dollar Baby and Crash. Now it was the Coen Brothers' turn. But Valley of Elah was a superior picture.",1286841600,,4948,4.84160756501182

3303660,2,B0011V7PSC,"""In the Valley of Elah"" could have an interesting film about Iraq vets returning from battle and having a hard time adjusting. Instead it chooses to demonize Iraq vets the same way Vietnam vets were demonized in films - as aberrant, crazed and damaged by their experiences in war.

The basic story is about Michael, the soldier son of a former military policeman, who has gone missing after his recent return from a tour of duty in Iraq. Dad (Tommy Lee Jones) takes off to find the boy. A former army investigator, he uses his skills to find out what happened to his son. He finds Michael's cell phone and downloads a number of short film clips that the boy shot while in Iraq. These spin out improbably over the course of the movie, throwing out red herrings and clues about the story. The film obviously is building to a heavy and deeply meaningful climax, but when the time arrives and Tommy Lee finally figures out what happened to Michael, it's a letdown. Michael's buddies are seemingly unmoved by what has happened to him. And his fate doesn't make any sense. I guess this was intended to convey the message that war is senseless and makes people crazy. The great and fateful event that supposedly warped young Michael, and for which we had been primed for the entire film, was no more horrifying than a traffic accident.

By the way, there is more than one film's fair share of stripper clubs and topless dancing in ""The Valley of Elah."" There's even one middle-aged (to be charitable) lady serving as a topless bartender, if that sort of thing floats your boat. The film could have done without these completely unnecessary bits, as it could have with the ill-conceived and pointless allusions to the David and Goliath story. I'm no Iraq war-groupie, but the film's moral - that something is deeply wrong with America's involvement in Iraq - seems tacked on and doesn't flow from the film's narrative.",1284336000,,1910,4.681547619047619

As always the scenario is a bit empty, but the actors, especially Tommy Lee Jones, Susan Sarandon and Charlize Theron, are first class.  I think this is one of the better Iraq movies because it happens after the troops come home from their overseas tour.  I plan to see this one several more times because each time, I get something else out of it.  After the horror of Viet Nam, you would have thought we would have stayed away from any further major invasions by our foot soldiers.  I think these movies try to drive the message home, but apparently our politicians are totally out of touch with reality and suffering to care.

3303662,4,B0011V7PSC,"The over long Valley of Elah delivers its anti-war sermon with all the subtlety of a sledghammer.  Trust us, we get it.  War turns people into creatures their parents don't recognize.  It always has and it always will--that's what war is, and several much better movies have addressed it, like The Deer Hunter and Born on the Fourth of July.  If VOE had contented itself with being a murder mystery and character study and let us draw our own conclusions on the order of The Hurt Locker, it would have been a much more powerful film.  As it is, we're bludgeoned by both the main plot and an unnecessary subplot about an Army wife who is terrified of her husband.  Throw in an element about how the flag is flown just in case we missed things the first time around, and the message becomes borderline insulting.

Inspired by a true story as is most fiction, the gist of the plot is that Pvt. Mike Deerfield has gone AWOL shortly after returning from combat in Iraq.  His father Hank, who just happens to be an ex MP is alerted to Mike's status by a phone call from the base attempting to locate him.  Hank solves the case despite the obstacles and lack of enthusiasm he gets from the Army and the local police and some very painful information he unearths. And oh, yeah--did I tell you the Army and the local police weren't helping much?  The title comes from the Biblical location of David's epic slaying of Goliath, but I have no idea what that has to do with this story.

*Spoiler Alert*
What is given the buildup for a grand conspiracy turns out to be a squalid, pointless Saturday night crime rather easily solved.

That said, this movie is a must see for the splendid acting which makes the weak script irrelevant.  Charlize Theron is a wonderfully understated detective, Susan Sarandon is heartbreaking as Mike's mother, and Josh Brolin is a splendid good ol' boy police chief.  The standout however, is Tommy Lee Jones' exquisitely nuanced performance.  As Hank, Jones manages to balance and make believable an experienced investigator's exasperation with incompetence, a father's guilt, love and pain, and a soldier's discipline.  It's one of the most amazing things I've ever seen and thank goodness the director had enough sense to spend a lot of time on Jones' face.  At best, this movie would rate two stars for script alone, and three stars only without Jones' stunning performance.  See this movie for the acting alone.

3303663,4,B0011V7PSC,"It's a good movie - I'd give it a 7 or 8 out of 10. It moves slow, but it does move. There's no really spectacular, stand out moment to the movie, nothing instantly memorable. And while it's about people returning from the battlefield, what they've seen and done, how they can't adjust to 'civilian' life, it doesn't really touch on any of that except briefly; it dances around the subject. There's no lecturing on any one subject, which is good, but on the other hand it doesn't seem to pay any attention to any one subject. But then, the movie does focus on the people involved, and in that it does a good job.

Tommy Lee Jones is one of those that for me are hit or miss - I like him in some things (such as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fugitive/dp/B00005ATZT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fugitive</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/M-I-B/dp/B00177YA1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">M.I.B.</a>""), don't like him in others. He does a good job here - the role fits him. Charlize Theron... she's usually very good, and she is in this as well. She can be a chameleon, fitting into the part, but it doesn't quite feel like she fit into this - she tries damn hard, but it just misses by a hair. Plus she's just too damn good looking for the role. Susan Sarandon barely has much of a part in this, but she fits right into it - very good, very well done. Reviews, etc have mentioned Josh Brolin - probably because he's a 'name', because he has less than five minutes of screen time in this. Basic stuff, and I guess he does it well enough.

It's something that I'm glad I've seen, and that I'll probably watch again at some point. It's worth what I paid for it, and that's all that can really be said.",1273622400,,1785,4.849180327868853

The film has an all-star cast with subperb acting from Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Susan Sarandon, Jason Patric, James Franco and Charlize Theron, who is amazing in this film.

The movie is based on actual events revolving the murder of Army Soldier Richard Davis.

Lee plays father Hank Deerfield, who receives a phone call from the army base that his son has gone AWOL. Hank doesn't know that his son has returned from Iraq for a brief stay and goes off to find out what happend. Once there, he finds out that the remains of his son have been found, and what begins to unravel is a story of deciet, sadness, and the loss of humanity.

Throughout the film, Hank is viewing clips of vidoes from his son's camera showing events from their combat in Iraq, including burned and chared bodies.

The film really centers around Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the overall effect it has on soldiers returning from Iraq back into their homeland. From drug use, to sudden nightmare flashes, to brief scares. The film explore the loss of humanity and the overall effects of PTSD.

It's a great film and the acting is authentic and realistic. I would recommend The Valley of Elah if you want to see a good overall film.",1272153600,,1326,4.504166666666666

Yes, so many war films have urged us to outrage, to sense the futility, the heroics, the cruelty, the power plays and their perversions. But not since, 'The Deerhunter', have the chilling consequences of violence been so devastatingly enunciated. It is no surprise that the tale has connexions to an actual event (albeit tenuously, as a lead reviewer notes. Though I don't mind that Haggis even uses the actual dad as a surrogate authority for his own film's moral integrity).We need feel the sympathy and ramifications of all the characters caught in the malestrom(though I do think the young woman found murdered in the bath is stacking the cards too high even for these dramtic ends. And the inverted flag is flawed overstatement. T L Jones, whose gritty and sullen demanour has made him the perfect messenger, this decade, for late mid-life crises roles, chases down the causes for his son's death.

3303667,5,B0011V7PSC,"In the Valley of Elah tells a story that will stick in your mind long after you watch it even if you don't agree with the message of the movie. The acting is extremely well done although I do think Susan Sarandon's role could have been beefed up more; I'm one of the people who feel that she was underutilized in this film although her acting was brilliant. The plot moves along at a good pace although things speed up during the last forty-five minutes or so of the film; and that does make things more interesting. As the plot deepened, I really couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. In addition, the cinematography is excellent.

When the action starts, we meet Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones) who lives in Tennessee with his wife Joan (Susan Sarandon). Hank gets a phone call from his son's military base at Fort Rudd, New Mexico, stating that his son Mike is AWOL from the base. Hank didn't know that Mike had returned from Iraq just a few days earlier. Hank, having been in the military as an investigator for quite some while, wants to find his son Mike without bringing in the military police so that Mike can be found without getting him into too much more trouble.

When Hank travels to Fort Rudd in the Southwest, he meets police detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron) who doesn't display any interest in helping Hank find his son. After some prodding, Emily takes Hank to the place where Mike's body was found--chopped up after being burned and dragged along a field. Although there is some fighting between the army and other police officers over which agency bears the responsibility of working on the case, eventually an extensive military investigation into the crime starts with Emily trying hard to lead the crew who are working on the case. Once all this starts, there are plot twists and turns that you simply won't see coming. Many people are interviewed about the crime including Cpl. Steve Penning (Wes Chatham), Spc. Gordon Bonner (Jake McLaughlin) and Spc. Ennis Long (Mehcad Brooks). Emily and a few others think they have the killer when they corner Pvt. Robert Ortiez (Victor Wolf); but that lead turns up cold after quite a chase scene. At the same time, Hank Deerfield forms an unlikely friendship with Emily as they continue to work together to determine who killed Mike when and why.

The plot, of course, can easily go in many different directions from here. What happens when Mike's mother Joan goes to Fort Rudd to see the remains of Mike's body? How can Hank push the authorities when he himself has limited power? After all, he really can't do much more than prod Emily Sanders and the others to do what's right. Will Mike's friends Steve, Gordon and Ennis be able to provide clues to what happened to Mike? No spoilers--watch and find out! In addition, the DVD comes with some interesting outtakes.

In the Valley of Elah tells a powerful story about the degree to which people can become corrupted by war even after they have finished serving in the battlefields. It's an interesting and poignant story that could happen anywhere even though this particular film is merely based on actual events. In addition, the film brilliantly portrays an unusual type of coming-of-age story--not of a younger person but, in this case, of the young man's father, Hank Deerfield, who learns that war doesn't always produce heroes.",1252540800,,3359,4.7465753424657535
3303668,5,B0011V7PSC,"This is an excellent film which rewards repeated viewings, whatever your politics. It's not a film that's opposed to the Iraq War itself, and it never properly addresses the rights and wrongs of the conflict. Rather, it's a depiction of what can happen to the individuals involved.

It's also a film with shifting perspectives. Tommy Lee Jones' character makes a lot of good calls-- and a few bad ones, just like the people he's working with. And the soldiers are not damned by any means-- they each achieve varying degress of redemption.

The fact that a film like this can come out while the conflict is ongoing and still find an audience is a tribute to the film industry, and The United States generally. Consider the Vietnam War and look at how long it took for Hollywood to start getting into those issues.

It's a tremendous, affecting film with spot-on performances, and strong messages, and it will stand the test of time.",1250121600,2,931,4.734567901234568
3303669,5,B0011V7PSC,"The film does not want to demonstrate anything about any war in particular. It is just a silly ""accident"" in which three GIs back from Iraq gets to fists and blows with a fourth one on some Saturday night in the city where they are stationed. The fourth one is killed, then burned and dismembered, or vice versa, and the pieces are scattered in some open waste land. Then they go to some diner's and have fried chicken and pay under the signature (fake of course) of the dead one. The father comes and tries to find out the truth. It takes time to make up what happened and lead the three killers to confessing their crime. But that's obviously not the only interest of this particular film. The father wants to know and understand why they did that. He himself is a veteran who fought in Vietnam, whose elder son was accidentally killed in Fort Bragg and whose younger son just disappeared. And there comes the picture of a war in our modern world, an ugly war that has no justification and in which young people are thrown, innocent, virginal and dumb like silly teenagers. They are bored and frightened and they have the power of weapons and uniforms. They abuse that power and then they misuse that power only because they are frightened and they shoot first a long time before ever imagining they could have asked a question first. But in what language? Then they get bored they have to find some entertainment and killing some innocent child or torturing a wounded prisoner is funny like hell in a hell of a war. And no remorse about the prisoner and his being tortured since eventually he will be killed or forced to die in a way or another not to tell anyone. That could be called military eugenics or wartime house husbandry or cleaning up warfare. If we reduce that horror to only Iraq we will not understand some moment in the film when the father explains, for example, to a young child how David vanquished Goliath because he was able to understand that his being afraid is the very effect the bully Goliath wants to create and if one is not afraid of the bully then the bully does not know what to do and you can then take advantage of this moment to push him aside in a way or another, even only with a simple slingshot and a small stone. A big bully is used to people being afraid of him, not of people not being afraid and using miserable weapons against him. That's the Valley of Elah. That moment is not a justification of war but a complete denunciation of the use of force by the more powerful party against the weaker party which creates a lot of fear and will be answered with a lot of unpredictable unmilitary small actions that will sting and hurt even if it does not win the war, but it will create fear among the powerful, and that the powerful don't know how to cope with it.

Soon it appears that Mike was the victim of foul play, but Hank finds the military authorities strangely uncooperative and his only hope is a civilian police officer (Charlize Theron) who is disliked by her colleagues.

Though the film deals with war and murder, it is surprisingly unemotional and uninvolving.  There is no tension or danger, there were too many minor characters to keep straight, and all the actors delivered their lines with such unrelenting poker-faces that it actually became tedious and boring.  Jones always gives a sensitive performance and makes it look easy, but here he's given so little to work with that he seemed to  sleepwalk through his scenes.  Theron plays a superwoman cop and mother who looked way too glamorous and was too emotionally upset by her work to be convincing.  Susan Sarandon has a small part as Mike's mother.

Based on a true story, this is ultimately about the futility of war and the dangers of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, but I just didn't find myself caring about any of the characters and thought it was too long and too dull.",1246320000,2,1222,4.869565217391305

Tommy's two sons, following in their father's footsteps, enter the military and are subsequently involved in the war in Iraq. The oldest is killed and the youngest, Mike, disappears once released. The Army has tagged him AWOL, but Deerfield doesn't believe this and goes searching for his son. When Mike's dismembered, burned corpse is found, the Army is all too willing to put this down to a drug kill. Deerfield teams up with a female cop, played by Charlize Theron, to find out what really happened to Mike. What they learn about the reason behind the murder, and about Mike and his role in the war, is shocking.

This film is based on actual events. Tommy Lee Jones excels in this role; his rigid, stoic demeanor fits the character, and the emotions we see play across his face as he discovers things he never even considered facing, is truly dramatic. Susan Sarandon plays a peripheral role as his wife, and Charlize Theron's detective character comes across as put-upon and just tired, but she's a fighter and is imperative to finding out what really happened.

Both times it resulted in lengthy military engagements that tested our national character and resolve. Some might say they also defined our national character and resolve.

World War II produced many memorable films including ""The Best Years of Our Lives,"" a movie about the mechanics of readjusting to civilian life after the war. This film, based apparently on real life events from 2004, will, I believe, have long-term affects showing our adjustment to the events in Iraq.

While World War II was, by most people's standards, a just war against a tide of totalitarianism in Europe and Asia. Today, questions abound whether American involvmement in Iraq exhibits similar value. Now six years after our 2003 invasion and five years since the events portrayed in this film took place, an ugly side of America is shown in this movie.

The film is about a soldier returned from Iraq that goes AWOL and is later found killed. The film shows what happened and the long search for this truth by the police, military establishment, and the soldier's parents. It is played out by two of America's best actors -- Tommy Lee Jones as the ex-military investigator father of the deceased soldier, and Charlize Theron as the police investigator trying to overcome bureaucracy and roadblocks to find out what happened. Together, they put on a great show that will keep you involved for the duration. While perhaps not the greatest filmmaking, it surely succeeds as political theater.

We saw a lot of this kind of thing after Vietnam, another long conflict around the world based on spurious motives. Our enemy in Vietnam was said to be communism; in Iraq it is said to be terrorism. Vietnam spawned coming home readjustment films like ""Coming Home"", ""The Deer Hunter"" and, my favorite, ""Rolling Thunder,"" all about returning veterans making the adjustment to civilian life. In each case, the life they came back to was more complicated and less fulfilling than the one they left for one reason: the war changed them as people in ways that weren't good.

This is the fundamental message of ""In the Valley of Elah"", whose content is based on the real-life killing of one soldier. Its broader vision, however, goes way beyong that case and postulates that our involvement in Iraq, like our involvement in Vietnam, will divide, weaken and desensitize us to other's suffering -- just as Vietnam did.

I think this postulate works well -- the reason I gave this film a 5 star review -- for a very personal reason. A few days before I saw this film I had dinner with my grandson and his family. He had just returned from six months military duty in Iraq. I saw a person changed from the one I'd seen a half-year earlier. He smoked more, drank more, and swore more. He had more tattoos, also, but that's beside the point.

Even more telling were his comments about Iraq, where he was stationed in the north, Kurd country. I asked if he saw violence; yes, every week, he said. ""You don't see where it's coming from so it's hard to shoot back,"" he said. His comments aobut the nation itself turned exceedingly negative. At one point, he wondered aloud why anyone would want to live in that place. ""They should nuke it and start over,"" he said.

This is the nihilism that is exhibited in ""In the Valley of Elah."" This is a startlingly good film, exceptionally well acted in the lead roles, with a timely and absorbing story, probably based on something that really happened. Its longer-term themes, however, are deafeningly negative. I expect it's the kind of film we will see a lot of once our invovlement in Iraq is history.",1237248000,,3720,4.721109399075501

The film is not for the faint of heart.

The acting by Tommy Lee Jones, Charlize Theron, Susan Sarandon and others is superb.  The direction, cinematography, editing, pacing, music, and storytelling are first rate.

The title ""In The Valley of Elah"" refers to the Biblical story of David and Goliath.  The film investigates and speculates on how our formative stories may shape our aspirations.

3303679,3,B0011V7PSC,"Unfortunately, Mr. Jones is about the best that can fished out of this movie.  Fortunately, Mr. Jones is a very, very good actor.  The story line, although supposed to have been told from a real incident, took so much ""artistic"" license as to make the thing a fiction.  The reader can check this out from other sources.

The viewer will come away thinking that the US Army is as loosely-run as this picture tries to show.  The viewer with any military experience would normally laugh at some of the sequences, were it not for the fact that the tale received so much fawning and raving. E.g., no soldier with any memory at all (good or bad!) of daily morning reports knows that it is darned near impossible for anyone to go missing, as in this movie -- even for a day.  Further, how on earth could even a retired veteran, portrayed by Jones, have such unfettered access to an Army base?  Free to wander here and there, talk to anyone he wished (few of whom actually seemed to have any real job), and generally go unnoticed by the universe inside the base.  True, ""it wouldn't be a movie"" without that drama.  This drama, though, fell very far inside the false and disrespectful range.

The final incredible straw was the implication, through a dialog between T.L. Jones and another Army old-timer, that the Vietnam War was a respected time, when all soldiers were serious and super-competent, etc.  Gads.  Maybe viewers under 45 will get sucked in by that monstrosity, but that was truly a gaff.

In spite of all this, do see the move for Tommy Lee Jones. This is his kind of flick: serious, non-nonsense, tell-me-straight-or-I'll-bop-ya' kind of character which we all know him for -- and somewhere between ruggedly- and ugly-handsome.

A plot whose central organizing event is a US soldier in Iraq running his massive Army truck over an innocent Iraqi child standing helplessly in the middle of a dusty street. No, it was not exactly ""deliberate"" - he was ordered to to do it to comply with a standing Army order that no truck in a convoy under attack must stop for any reason. The memory of the child's body flopping around in the undercarriage drives the otherwise virtuous soldier to a form of drug fueled sadism/insanity which ultimately leads his murder by his fellow soldiers, also ""messed"" by the Horrible Injustice of It All. To add impact and visual interest the writers of this screenplay have the young soldier's body dismembered and then burned and there are many opportunities for quick glances at photos of the crime scene.

But wait there's more! Susan Sarandon does her nauseatingly condescending impression of a Red State mother who blames her husband (Tommie Lee Jones) for the death of her son because he idealized military service to the son! Jones resists the temptation to display his great range by playing exactly the same character he always plays, only tireder. There is even a scene where he has a depressing conversation with another burned out old man who happens to be the same actor with whom Jones had a similarly pointless scene in No Country For Old Men.

What would a movie like this be without the old Glass Ceiling theme?
So we have the tall svelte knockout (Theron) as the detective whose career is devalued and demeaned by older pot bellied neanderthal male detectives who insist she only got her position through prostitution.
There is the crusty cynical white male police chief (Brolin/Bush) who is only interested in re-election but reluctantly agrees to let Theron do the right thing in the case. The gritty reality of everyday police work is brilliantly captured by Theron's wardrobe. She is, inevitably, a single mother with a precious pre-pubertal male child.

As sharp and worldly wise as Jones' Father is even he succumbs to...yes, cultural insensitivity, when he refers to a Mexican American soldier as a ""wetback."" In the powerfully affecting denouement of the story he and this soldier are reconciled by their mutual pain and disgust with Life and the Military.

Tommy Lee Jones plays a father who is looking for his missing son, Mike. It turns out that Mike was stabbed 40 times and sliced into little cubes by his fellow Iraq War veterans. His body parts were found partially eaten by wild animals. During the confessions, the soldiers tell the father that Mike could have easily done the same to them. The Iraq War had left them all nuts.

The horror doesn't stop there. The father also finds out that his psychopathic son, Mike, ran over an Iraqi child while in convoy, and that he tortured a prisoner. Mike had captured the muffled, haunting screams in a cell phone video, which plays during dramatic moments throughout the movie.

And, of course, the Iraq War veterans were drug addicts trying to smuggle heroin out of Kuwait.

The last scene is where the father hangs a treasured, battered American flag upside down to show that the country is in distress.

Vietnam War veterans have been portrayed for many years in movies and news stories as homeless misfits and drug addicts. The same myths are already being applied to the Iraq War veterans.",1233360000,17,1387,4.7866108786610875

This was one of the A list entries and acting wise it was by far the best of the entire a or b list movies.  It's a murder mystery and it showcases the supposed damage that happens to men of war.  That they may suddenly butcher their own friends for no reason. this is outrageous in some regards and made most people laugh in the movie house I saw it in when a character claims everyone kills their friends.  This is not a proven fact but what is proven is that drugs or heavy drinking (both are even worse) combined with bad experiences can lead to violence or suicide.  In spite of this the movie is well acted by top performers and has a decent story behind it. This isn't a smear job like other antiwar movies instead it seeks to say that we are in distress and in truth we are.  You can't medicate war traumas with substances this leads to disaster and that should have been more in the front of this flick.  But that being said the movie is a murder mystery and it has a small basis in fact , and it is not mean spirited and anti military people like lets say the loathsome 'the generals daughter"" or the absolutely false ""haditha""  were.  On blu ray this movie looks great and it was a early release relatively on the format.  Whatever your views on the war one can find sympathy for the soldiers we sent over to iraq as they were sent over and over into battle in a ruthless manner. But it's the use of hard drinking or drugs that inevitably lead to most violence among vets and without that factor many vets (but not all)  who did violent acts , would have never committed crimes and in truth most returning vets don't commit crimes either, something the movie doesn't state. The film mainly focuses on those who are violent.  Still with three great actors heading this film it's hard not to enjoy their efforts.  The movie isn't boring and is straighforward and isn't about smearing the vets of today and this makes it a more decent type of antiwar movie than most.",1232928000,,2115,4.313131313131313

3303685,5,B0011V7PSC,"This movie was criticized in the magazine Salon for taking the easy way out and by the Los Angeles Times for incorrectly conveying an important message. In spite of such criticism, the director Paul Haggis won an award given by the SIGNIS  at the 2007 Venice Film Festival, and Tommy Lee Jones was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.
Much as ""Crash"", the previous movie directed by Haggis, this movie presents a serious, controversial and divisive topic. Certainly it is expected that not everyone in the audience will be pleased by Haggis' strong and straight forward approach.

The plot of the movie is based on the actual experience of Richard Davis, an Iraq war veteran, who returns home in 2003 after he and his comrades participated in the April 11, 2003, ""Midtown Massacre,"" in downtown Baghdad. On July 15, 2003, less than two days after returning from Irag deployment, Davis was murdered brutally outside Fort Benning, Ga by fellow soldiers.
Lanny Davis, the father of Richard Davis and a former military police officer, launches his own investigation to find out what happened to his missing son, because the army wouldn't investigate the case and treated it as AWOL/desertion.

While minor details and the names of the characters have been changed, Tommy Lee Jones is outstanding in the role of the father, who finds out the truth with the help of detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron).
While the investigation reveals the details of the murder, it also reveals the emotional and psychological destruction the American soldiers suffered watching innocents being killed by mistakes, women raped, and prisoners tortured. The movie is a close look at the dilemma soldiers face, when they go back to their normal lives after watching war crimes, and the loss of faith and ambivalence Americans feel between their loyalty to their government and the reality they are all faced with during the war.
Tommy Lee Jones out did himself showing conflict and confusion between a father's love and loyal citizen. Also, the ending of the movie is a thought provoking and symbolic one inspired by the United States Flag Code.

Now that president Bush is out of the White House leaving some unfinished business, I recall what  Mahatma Gandi once said: ""What difference does it make to the dead, the orphans and the homeless, whether the mad destruction is brought under the name of totalitarianism or the holy name of liberty or democracy?"". Six years after the beginning of the war against Iraq, what justification will we offer the dead innocents? What comfort will we give to the American soldiers who have suffered enormous trauma facing an enemy they don't even know and now question their values?
What brush will we use to paint the canvas of our history in Iraq? Will we use the brush of denial, self justification and delusion or the brush of perspective humility and profound sorrow at an action gone badly wrong?

I don't expect many people to agree with my review, especially because of the way we as a nation continue to hide our heads in the sand and follow with blind faith our sense of righteousness and superiority about the Iraq War. Great movies like ""In the Valley of Elah' are the simple impetus that force people to open their eyes to wonder and question their actions and political maturity.",1232409600,6,3323,4.903914590747331
3303686,1,B0011V7PSC,"I'm rather surprised buy the glowing reviews.  Tommy Lee Jones and Charlize Theron, give good performances, but others in the cast do not and in general the film feels cheap and preachy.  Some secondary characters seem like locals given a few lines as a favor, not professionals.  Apparent location shots in buildings were framed distant and clinical.  Likely this was to create a mood -but its so often used in cheap direct to video films, that's the impression it leaves.

As to the peachiness, the film is ""inspired"" by an actual case, but has little in common with it.  In the film Tommy Lee is a straight-laced country, core, God in that order vet.  He slowly finds his son was missing, then murdered, and slowly that his son had become a drug using sadist.  Tidbits like a scene set in a gun store where they frame the huge selection of guns, and a local case where a guy in a chicken farm likes to poke the eyes out of the chickens seem to be there to imply the innate cruelty and violence of Americans.  And the arc of the story shows Tom Lee gradually seeing the Army and the war in Iraq as brutalizing and dehumanizing the troops into becoming utterly cold blood killers who can cheerfully kill and torture.  In the end he's shown turning his back on core and country with a closing scene where he disgraces a long cherished family flag.  It reminds me of Vietnam war era films portraying all vets as dehumanized baby killing psychos; both because of its preach bias, and its sloppiness with the facts to make theirpoint.

As has been mentioned the film plot shares little with the actual events, and it also is often clich and contradictory.  Tom Lees character rapidly shows up the local police and Army investigators, finding clue after clue missed or bungled by the other investigators.  The dead sons body is so brutally destroyed that little was recovered, and of that there were signs of at least 40 stab wounds.  Which as any detective show watcher knows implies uncontrollable rage.  The murderer however expresses no real feeling at all about the killing, though he apologizes and seems a little sorry to have lost his friend.  An argument got out of hand, and then he realized he stabbed him.  It's sufficiently unlikely I expected it to be a false trail to quickly unravel.  After the murder the body was cut up, burned, and disposed - near by to virtually the only streetlight in a deserted road at the edge of a dessert.  Near the end there is a flashback scene that seems to be what was supposed to have broken Tommy Lees son, but seems unclimactic to have had such impact..

All in all the film seemed to me, to be Tommy Lee Jones and Charlize Theron in a film well bellow their normal standards.  Where they gave good performances, but not up to their best work.  I was stunned to hear it won raves from Hollywood, and a award nomination for Tommy Lee.

This is not a humorous film; rather bleak, dark, riveting and a darn good mystery. This is based on fact, though modified to make a coherent narrative; I found no problem with that, but don't watch the DVD extras first, or it will destroy the mystery. I won't blab away the plot, but it's about a son who goes missing, and Tommy Lee tries to find out what happened. Excellent support from Charlize Theron and a small but touching cameo by Susan Sarandon as Tommy's wife. Previous reviewers were put off because it didn't follow all the facts of the case. Who cares?

3303688,4,B0011V7PSC,"""In The Valley Of Elah"" isn't really a movie about the Iraq War - it's about the soldiers who return home from it and the parents of those soldiers who don't return home at all.

Written and directed by Paul Haggis (who did the equally superb ""Crash"" and ""Million Dollar Baby""), the movie is far less showy than ""Rendition"" and less posturing than the ridiculous ""Lions For Lambs"". And while ""Elah"" has an unfolding power in its carefully measured pace, it's also braver in its assessment of the American military and their less-than-angelic ways...

Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Sarandon play Hank & Joan Deerfield, the parents of a young soldier Mike Deerfield, who has inexplicably gone missing since his return from a tour in Bosnia and Iraq in November 2004. Hank visits the base where his son bunked, but neither Jason Patrick as Lieutenant Kirklander, James Franco as Sgt. Carnelli nor any of his division buddies are helpful - and worse - many seem unnerved - almost as if they're hiding something very nasty. A local beleaguered Detective in the police force, single-parent Emily Sanders (played by a superb Charlize Theron) gets embroiled in what she suspects is a grieving father being shafted by the canny US military. And without giving away too much, on the story goes...

One of the movies great strengths is of course the presence and capability of real heavyweights like Jones, Sarandon and Theron. Tommy Lee in particular is sensational. Just when you thought you'd seen every stone-clad grimace he can throw at you, for ""Elah"" he digs down deep and finds tremulous moments that floor you with their power and humanity. His character Deerfield is ""army"" - old-school values and discipline - he presses his trousers over a table to get the crease right - fixes an American flag that has been hanging upside down - calls all women 'mam' and won't be seen without a clean shirt on in front of any of them. Yet Hank is not naive either - he knows that his boy's tour of Iraq wouldn't have been without sickening cruelty or even dishonour. But what gives the movie its emotional core is his skill at depicting that. You can 'feel' his barely-contained lashing-out rage bubbling underneath - or when he just quietly sits in his pick-up truck in sad-eyed despair - why are American sons left in pieces on scrubs for wild animals to feed on - did I impose my `will' on my boy and force the army life on him - and why does civilian America not give a shit about any of it?

There's a scene where Sarandon walks away with her husband down a corridor - there's no music - just them walking away - her hand outstretched in disbelief. The camera stays stationary - watching them walk away in silence - and you know the buckle into his arms is going to come - you know it - and yet when it does - it still has the power of real hurt.

Theron is great too - one of the most intelligent actresses working in Hollywood today - she has her beauty toned down by dowdy dark hair and clunky uniforms - and it works - you concentrate on her first rate acting. There's a scene when she hugs her sleeping son at night who needs the bedroom door open because he's scared - she hugs him close - thankful that he is not another statistic of some ignored list somewhere - you 'feel' what is precious to us - and the utter devastation of having that link to our very soul taken away...

The supporting cast is also universally superb - really good actors in a quality film given quality material to work with - and they know it. Jason Patrick gets his best part in years as the Forces spokesman trapped between the two worlds of the Army's need to cover up and the public's need for the truth; Josh Brolin plays the local Police Chief, weary of unsolved cases and ever so slightly disinterested, but a man who knows that his female detective will terrier out the ugly no matter what. Barry Corbin (of Northern exposure fame) puts in a touching old-army buddy cameo with Tommy Lee in a caf, while Jake McLaughlin and Mehcad Brooks are idealistic and young as the 'just following orders' grunts. Wes Chatham in particular is chillingly fantastic as Corporal Penning - detached and jauntily psychotic as he discusses how hungry he gets after a good day's killing...

""In The Valley Of Elah"" is a phrase from the Bible parable about David and Goliath - where David must beat his fear of the monster - and win. ""Elah"" is neither jolly nor pretty - but it has amazing truths in it. I thought it was an exceptional movie and it stayed with me long after I pressed the stop button. Much like war and its aftermath I suspect for those who really did lose someone...

Put this film high on your `must-see' list and well done to all the good people involved.",1229558400,,4733,4.508158508158508
3303689,4,B0011V7PSC,"War is always ugly.  It does not matter where it is fought or by whom.  Soldiers are active participants in surival games that require them to kill with or without reason in order to preserve their won life or the lives of the people around them.  This story is a story of the current generation of young people going to Iraq.  They are used to video cameras, simple comforts of every day life, while long stays in a third world country like Iraq are having lasting effects on their psyche.  Tommy Lee Jones plays a father whose sons goes AWOL. He is convinced that if his son is missing, there must be a valid reason and decides to launch his own investigation.  When a body was found just outside of the city and identified as remains of his son, he is determined to find a person that committed the crime.  Local police and military police fight over jurisdiction and the right to investigate the crime.  Is it that military wants to keep this hush-hush, or that the local police does not want another murder on their worksheet?  Caught in the battle are the grief stricken father and a female police officer, herself a victim of endless sexist torture at the workplace.  What is mesmerizing is the way that a young man was killed (over 40 stab wounds with the knife, body cut up in pieces and burned).  Even more troubling is the discovery that it was his military buddies who did it.  What sort of experience do these young men go through to be able to kill in the most gruesome way one of their own?  Are they sociopaths enabled even more by their participation in a war where killing is a part of the daily life, or just irrevocably damaged goods with no shred of consience left?  Tommy Lee Jones is so good in this role.  This film will make one think abour consequences of war and its affect on people for a long time.  It redefines humanity and what it means to different people.",1226275200,,1889,4.416184971098266

3303693,4,B0011V7PSC,"It is all written on the faces, the harried father who desperately seeks the whereabouts of his son after a tour in Iraq, the others who served with the young man, their proud military bearing and soft-spoken reverence for authority belied by what they have seen and done in service to their country. In this powerful, haunting tale, the rigors of war fall upon the survivors. Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones), ex-career military, leaves his home in Tennessee, wife (Susan Sarandon) waiting anxiously behind. Hank's last words: ""I'll find him."" Setting off in his pickup truck, Hank heads for his Mike Deerfield's military base. There are insufficient answers to ease a troubled father's mind. Hoping to circumvent the military police, Hank requests the help of Detective Emily Sanders, a young woman much derided by her fellow detectives. Resistant to Deerfield's imprecations, Sanders at allows him to accompany her to the scene of a recent crime, the mutilation and burning of an unidentified victim.

Once the victim is identified we come to the heart of the film- the reasons for a brutal slaying that straddles the border of military and civilian jurisdiction. Clinging to his rigorous daily standards, military corners on his motel bed, spit-shining his shoes each night before the terrible revelations of the next day, Deerfield is the contemporary American father, patriotic, hard-working, respectful of the institution that has formed the backbone of his life and that of his family. But everything he believes is challenged by the facts, piece by disheartening piece, all pointing towards an institution overwhelmed by the necessities of an ongoing war and the collateral damage inflicted on those who honor their country's call. Director Haggis is circumspect- at no time does he disrespect the military or the soldiers who serve their nation. But he cuts to the heart of war as etched on the face of one parent who bears the unbearable, the loss of a son in circumstances that baffle and disturb him.

Reviewing snippets of film accessed from his son's cell phone, Deerfield watches his son's reactions to the stresses of war, the moral dilemmas faced daily by soldiers in combat. Returning home, these young men are as tightly coiled as when in Iraq, struggling to integrate in a world that has moved on. As the detective slowly unravels a web of deceit engineered by the army, Deerfield hovers nearby, unable to return home without answers. Those he receives do little to lessen his pain, the internal struggle writ clear on the actor's face, more powerful than the declarations of the guilty, the smooth, untroubled faces of Mike's friends. One laments, ""I couldn't wait to get out of Iraq. After two weeks here, I wish I could go back."" This portrait of loss is scathing and painful, with no villain to blame, save the grim realities of war in the modern age, when powerful machines of destruction are wielded by the flesh and blood of fallible humans. David slays Goliath in the Valley of Elah, but this is a monster of our own making, the nature of war and its necessary, if inhuman demands. With a superior supporting cast (Charlize Theron, Susan Sarandon, Jason Patrick), Jones stands alone, much like his character, his grief relentless.

3303696,2,B0011V7PSC,"As soon as I saw the, ""Based on True Events"" disclaimer at the beginning of the film, I immediately became suspicious that the film would use dramatic license too liberally.

And it did. Yes, some soldiers murdered another soldier. Yes, they tried to burn the remains. But that's where the similarities end.

This is just another despicable, ""The war is making baby killers out of our boys"" film that exploits a true life tragedy to advance anti-war sentiment...and dishonors the other brave men and women who did serve honorably in Iraq.

Everything else depicted in the film did not happen--no cell phone with graphic videos of events in Iraq, no father doing his own detective work, no fried chicken after the murder, no brother who also got killed in Iraq, no assisting female detective, no sexist pig detectives, no suicide, no stonewalling military police, no city police unwilling to investigate...

One word sums this movie up perfectly--fraud.  If it were just a work of fiction, fine.  But instead it tries to dupe the audience into thinking it's real by claiming it's based on true events.",1219708800,6,1100,4.918918918918919

3303701,3,B0011V7PSC,"This film is solid in terms of acting and direction. The story is exciting and well constructed. But the film subtly projects a message (subtle in that it is hidden in Tommy Lee Jones's quest to solve his son's murder) that our soldiers in Iraq are self-destructive psychos with no moral fiber. War is, indeed, hell. But it does take two to fight, another truism. It is very easy to criticize when all seems to be secure; our soldiers are fighting to protect our security. The main thing that I got out of this taut drama is that the media can manipulate our sentiments.

3303702,4,B0011V7PSC,"Usually when I'm told that anyone is ""complicated,"" I shy away, having too often found the term a cover for someone who is a self-dramatizing bore. However this movie presents complicated people who are inherently interesting, and a complicated situation that is inherently moving and not just a layer-cake of contrived emotion.

This might be one of the few movies you'll see that does NOT assume a young enlisted person who fought in Iraq is automatically ""a hero."" In fact, much of the compelling drama of this film revolves around the viewer's discovery of just how unheroic young Mike Deerfield was.

The disillusionment is made all the more poignant in that we see it through the eyes of the young man's father when he goes to his son's state-side base to find out the circumstances of the young man's grisly death. The disappointment in who his son had grown up to be comes in subtle ways at first, as when Tommy Lee Jones goes to Mike's regular off-duty hangout and finds it's a sleazy strip-joint. One could dismiss that - boys will be boys. But the realization of the young man's character flaws starts to go deeper.

Two mysteries haunt this drama. The first is the obvious one about who killed the young man. But the second mystery, the one that is legitimately complicated, revolves around how this young man, born with so much promise, could have devolved into such a flawed and actually corrupt human being.

Was it his father's stern military influence skewing the boy to place more emphasis on spit-and-polish appearance than on warm human exchange? Was it the brutalizing circumstances of the guerilla war in Iraq? Was it humankind's innate propensity for evil?

The bonus material on this DVD includes one particularly telling outtake. I usually agree with Director's decisions about which scenes were best left on the cutting room floor. But in this case, the main outtake would have added a lot to the character study. In any case, be sure to check it out in the DVD extras.

Susan Sarandon doesn't have a great deal to do in this movie, and outside of one or two wrenching scenes, is almost wasted in the role of the quietly suffering, marginalized wife. However Tommy Lee Jones gives a tour de force performance, really making us feel the consequences of a family's emotional estrangement. This is a memorable film all the way around.",1215302400,2,2357,4.793103448275862
3303703,4,B0011V7PSC,"I have to admit it was with some trepidation that I finally saw this 2007 murder mystery directed and written by Paul Haggis. His last time doing double-duty was the polarizing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>, an omnibus fable of LA-based race relations, powerfully acted but also a manipulative model of melodramatic contrivance. This time out, he is less patronizing because the storyline is more contained and based in fact. However, Haggis still shows the same need to stay topical, seek restitution for his characters and convey an undeniable sense of parable. These factors are what make movie-watchers either love his work or hate it for the way he often undercuts the credibility of the drama to make his points. Regardless, there is no arguing with the fact that Tommy Lee Jones gives a masterful performance of a man who can barely contain his grief under a veneer of old-school reserve. It's a gratifying continuation of the recently stellar work he has done in his own directorial debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Burials-of-Melquiades-Estrada/dp/B000F8O2QU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada</a>, and the Coen Brothers' bleak&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Country-for-Old-Men/dp/B00118T63C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Country for Old Men</a>.

Jones plays taciturn Hank Greenfield, a retired Army officer and ex-military cop who now hauls gravel in Tennessee. He receives word that his son Mike, a soldier just back from Iraq, is about to be reported as AWOL from his base in New Mexico. Immediately sensing something is not right, Hank leaves his concerned wife Joan at home and drives straight to the base to see if he can get to the bottom of his son's disappearance. He receives next to no assistance from either the military or the local police, who argue over whether it's a matter for the Army to resolve. Things change dramatically when a charred, dismembered body is found abandoned in a desolate field outside of town. Once it has been identified, Hank works diligently and fractiously with Emily Sanders, a sympathetic, overworked detective, to find out not only who the murderer is but what the reasons were for such a vile act of inhumanity. Naturally, they encounter an abundance of military red-tape, pervasive apathy from the local police force and a couple of red herrings before coming to a resolution.

Without giving anything away, I have to say the ending lacks a deep emotional resonance that would have made Hank's journey to know his son truly memorable. Instead, we find Haggis informing us how the day-to-day bloodshed in Iraq cannot help but impact the hearts and minds of those who make it home, a lesson one would have thought was made clear from Vietnam. Beyond the quietly nuanced work of Jones, a somewhat deglamorized Charlize Theron continues to prove she can be a fine actress in worthy roles like Emily (and not the comic-book dominatrix&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aeon-Flux/dp/B000EOTAM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aeon Flux</a>). She fluctuates between strong and empathetic with impressive fluidity. In the understandably smallish role of Joan, Susan Sarandon barely has any screen time for an actress of her caliber, but she makes her couple of wrenching scenes count. Similarly powerful actors have been cast in relatively minor parts - James Franco as an officious base official, Josh Brolin as Emily's ego-driven chief, a nearly unrecognizable Barry Corbin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Northern-Exposure/dp/B000V6LSO0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Northern Exposure</a>) as Hank's old Army pal, and Jason Patric who is allowed to make of an impression as a poker-faced lieutenant who appears to be stonewalling the case. Frances Fisher has a thankless cameo as a topless waitress who provides one of the key clues in the case.

Except for a couple of unnecessary detours toward the end, Haggis has ultimately made less of an involving mystery and more of a dramatically effective ""message"" movie - not as heavy-handed as ""Crash"" and of a less arguable variety. The 2008 DVD offers no commentary track from either Haggis or Jones, a surprising omission, but there is a sobering 43-minute video diary of the production spotlighting a number of the actors playing the soldiers as well as the parents of the real-life soldier upon whom Haggis based his story. Also included is an ""additional scene"", which amounts to an eight-minute deleted subplot about Mike's unknown girlfriend rather absurdly named ""Jennifer Lopez"" for easy laughs. The laughs evaporate when we see she is a multiple amputee who began to see Mike's changing nature. Particularly fascinating is the variable use of green scene to hide her limbs.",1215043200,2,4995,5.802452316076295
3303704,2,B0011V7PSC,"Valley is a beautifully shot movie, with great acting and an engaging thriller script.  Plus it criticizes the Iraq War.  Hence the great reviews.

But there is another side to Valley - disrespect for soldiers and dishonest manipulation of the facts.  Soldiers in Valley are pretty much all depicted negatively:  they spend times in strip joints and with hookers, do drugs (meth, just in case viewers don't mind marijuana) and booze up constantly.  And, oh, yes, they are also torturers, psychopaths and murderers.

At the core, Valley is a true story, but a wee bit ""spiced up"" to get the PC message across.  Do soldiers booze up and go to strip clubs?  I'd be surprised if many didn't.  Do they all do that and are they all druggies?  Hmmm, probably not, but that's not what Valley shows.

Another example is that you have 2 simultaneous murders on the same base.  The main story's and the bathtub drowning incident.  In real life, the bathtub drowning didn't happen in the same place and time.  Now, 1 grisly murder is a big story, sure.  2 murders imply a trend.  Valley is all about implications by twisting facts.

Does the VA always treat veterans well?  Ummm, there was a scandal about that, no?

Is the Bush administration incompetent and did they royally mess up in Iraq?  Yes and yes.

Are vets at risk of coming back traumatized?  Yes, and they need help, not being spit on.

Do soldiers, under the pretense of caring for them, need to be generalized as psychopathic low-lives?  I think not.

And if you wanna tell me that the real-life dad of the victim liked the movie...  so what?  Do you really expect him to sing the praise of the Army and its soldiers, considering what was done to his son?",1214870400,5,1708,4.584717607973422

However, the documentary in the special features section will raise guilt in those who have not supported the war. Soldiers returned from Iraq speak about how they expected to return to a society that understood the trauma that they had undergone. When in reality, very little has changed.

The overall message of the film is extremely powerful. For those interested in the cinematography, it

3303707,4,B0011V7PSC,"This is a truly exceptional film, I didn't think I could like Tommy Lee Jones any more than I already do but he is really outstanding in this movie.  I have to agree with the person who said it's depressing, it is. My heart ached after watching this and I didn't think I'd ever want to watch it again but I can't stop thinking about it.
I take exception to those who say it's nothing more than an anti-war, Bush-bashing, movie. Paul Haggis was inspired to write the screenplay after reading an article in Playboy (""Death and Dishonor"" by Mark Boal, 2004) about Army Specialist Richard Davis, an Iraq war veteran who was murdered shortly after his return from Iraq. Richard Davis's father Lanny is also a former military police officer like the character Tommy Lee Jones plays, he too mounted his own investigation into his son's murder as did Tommy Lee Jones' character.
The case of Richard Davis' murder was also featured on CBS' 48 Hours and author Cilla McCain has written a book about it entitled, ""Murder in Baker Company: The Forgotten Soldier"" (Ms. McCain's own review can be found here: [...]
During the Vietnam War they sold POW bracelets that had engraved on them the name of a missing soldier, his rank and the date he went missing. Along with the bracelets came stickers for you to stick on the bracelet after the status of the missing soldier was discovered. Sadly the soldier on my bracelet was MIA until long after my bracelet broke, but I will never forget his name: Sgt. Harold Reid. I researched a few years ago and found out they had finally recovered his body and brought it home for burial near his family in Utah.
Isn't it unfortunate that for all the ""Support Our Troops"" yellow ribbons and magnets I see on cars everywhere, so little is done for them once they return home, they're essentially forgotten. Why aren't we equally supportive of those who have returned so changed from a needless, senseless war? Why would they need us to remember them and how they've selflessly given of themselves to serve our country? After all, they're ""done"", right?",1214611200,,2074,4.666666666666667
3303708,5,B0011V7PSC,"Trying to rationalize IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH will challenge your views. Many of them. And this is the signature of good cinema. We all know that war changes people. Men go to foreign lands, are ordered to do horrendous things in the name of ""god and country"", and then are supposed to return home to a normal, happy, healthy life. Nothing could be further from the truth. Director Paul Haggis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>) once again shows us a complex issue with morality taking a tailspin.

Based on a true story, In the Valley of Elah is a chilling and disturbing tale of how some young men are affected by the war in Iraq. Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Country-for-Old-Men/dp/B00118T63C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Country for Old Men</a>) is awakened one morning by a disturbing phone call. His son has gone missing ...but not in Iraq. He's back home at his army base but hasn't been seen in days. Hank -- a retired army man himself -- kisses his wife Joan (Susan Sarandon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Enchanted/dp/B0011U52EC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Enchanted</a>) goodbye and heads out to find him. And what he discovers is numbing and completely irrational.

The mood is set immediately when Hank leaves home and finds an American flag flying upside down; the international distress symbol for soldiers in trouble. Why and who did this is never known, but the message is clear: our boys in uniform need help.

When Hank's son's body is found mutilated, Hank turns up his private investigation skills with the help of Detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/North-Country/dp/B000CQLZ8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">North Country</a>). Learning a great deal from each other, the two form a tenuous friendship based on the discovery of the truth about the murder. And the truth will flabbergast many viewers ...but in a thought-provoking way.

The cast of this film is simply phenomenal. Tommy Lee holds the production to a very high standard, and watching him trying not to burst into tears is probably one of the more powerful moments in the film. Also, I didn't realize that Det. Sanders was Charlize Theron. Minimal make-up and a tight hairdo (as well as some great acting) made me just see her character. A special note also MUST be made for one scene in particular. And this scene involved Susan Sarandon as Joan, the wife of Hank and mother of the murdered soldier. This scene was so powerful that it made me hold my breath. It is when she demands to see the remains of her son but can only view them through a glass pane that looks into the morgue (""Is that all? It looks so cold in there. Can I go in?"") Gut-wrenching!

I applaud director Paul Haggis for making us look at the faults that surround us. Similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>, this film holds nothing back and forces us to peer into those places we dare not look.

3303710,5,B0011V7PSC,"This is a nicely paced, intelligent and well acted movie that gives the three principal A listed actors, Tommy Lee Jones, Charlize Theron and Susana Sarandon ample opportunity to display their remarkable skills.  Susan Sarandon, as always, plays a strong supporting role as Tommy's distressed wife. Tommy Lee, in particular, is outstanding in this.  His trademark masculinity is perfectly suited to this portrayal of a former soldier in search of his son, suspected at first of being AWOL after a tour of duty in Iraq. Tommy gets to discover the whole truth with the assistance of Charlize's character, a jaded female cop, a good woman struggling with a cuture of apathy and male chauvanism. She makes a few bad calls earlier that dramatically come back to haunt her later on.  Her relationship with Tommy is tense at first, but she eventually sees the light and joins with him in his battle to find the truth, notwithstanding resistance from colleagues and the military police who seem intent on a cover up.  This is not a cops and robbers type story.  It is primarily about the dehumanising consequences of miltarism for the young men who serve. The director isn't forcing his ideas on the viewer, but allowing the story to unfold naturally. There is a particularly poignant piece of symbolism involving the stars and stripes.  Earlier in the film, Tommy sees a fellow trying to raise Old Glory upside down after allowing it to dangle on the ground.  He gently explains the proper protocol involved in respectfully honouring this proud symbol of the American nation. Towards the very end of the movie, however, and after discovering the truth about his son's dreadful murder, the flag raising is repeated.  This time Tommy hangs it upside down as he explain the symbolic meaning of doing so: ""It means,"" he says, ""we are in serious trouble and all hope is lost"" - or words to that effect.

3303712,5,B0011V7PSC,"Ex MP Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones in one of his best roles) once had two sons. The first one got killed in a war, the second one has gone missing after he returned from Iraq.
Without thinking twice or discussing things with his wife (Susan Sarandon) Hank goes looking for him.
But he is not prepared for the dirty truths that come to light. It doesn't take him long to realize that the young man he is looking for has changed. With the help of a few blurry shots and videos from his son Mike's mobile phone and a local detective (also very impressive: Charlize Theron) he is able to dig deeper into his son's past. Not only has Iraq destroyed a large part of Mike's psyche, it has also changed his life for the worse. Boredom, booze, drugs, strip clubs and more boredom, booze and drugs have invaded the young man's life.
Mike is found, or what is left of him. He was brutally murdered.
In the end the case is solved but the lives of all (including yours) will be changed forever.
I want to point out that for me this was NOT an anti military film. Although the army isn't always shown in its best light, the director Paul Haggis tries to show us a neutral vision on what happens when young men are exposed to the cruelty of war.
True, the army looks a little helpless. Bound by rules and regulations and afraid to lose the trust and support of the American people, they try to protect the soldiers by withholding statements and manipulating the investigation. But that is all understandable.
This film is anti war (and anti racist). No matter where you look, either the Deerfield family or Mike's army buddies, so many lives lost and destroyed all because of war.
It will stay with you forever. The acting is state of the art, camera, directing and script terrific.
With Blu-ray and HDDVD you have the story jumping into your living room - which I believe is what it deserves.
As an extra there is a small heart wrenching storyline involving Mike's ex-girlfriend (who is not in the theatrical version of the movie) and interviews with the co-stars who play the army buddies, most of which have served in Iraq thus knowing exactly what this is all about.

3303715,4,B0011V7PSC,"What a terribly sad film.  ""In the Valley of Elah"" tugs at heart strings and although not based on a true story is perhaps emblematic of many American veterans of the war in Iraq.

Tommy Lee Jones plays Hank Deerfield, a war veteran whose son, Mike, has just returned from Iraq.  Yet although Mike has returned, he has gone missing.  Hank decides to look into the matter.  He quickly learns that Mike has died a horrible murderous death.  His paternal instincts lead him to investigate the matter and, in the process, he forms a bond of sorts with a detective, Emily Sanders, who is played by Charlize Theron.  Slowly and methodically, they piece the puzzle together.  The result is very grim with soldiers who have witnessed great tragedy in a war having difficulties adjusting back to civilian life.

In many respects, ""In the Valley of Elah"" is simply a whodunit.  But to leave it at this point is to disregard a powerful story and a brooding plot that lets the actors shine.  The performances of Jones and Theron are excellent.  So too is the cameo role played by Susan Sarandon as Hank's wife.  Her world is truly ripped apart as this death follows the earlier death of her older son.  Her family is broken asunder.

Although this is a film where attention to detail is required, do not let this claim put off any potential viewers.  The film is challenging but, ultimately, rewarding.",1211155200,,1390,4.658436213991769

The film also suggests that this is an issue unique to the situation in Iraq. All military, in all countries, in all wars have members who committed such acts. If you're going to protest the war in Iraq, through a screenplay, do so addressing the issues pertaining to this war.

In Paul Haggis' low-keyed drama, ""In the Valley of Elah,"" a retired army officer goes in search of his son, who may have gone AWOL while on leave from Iraq.  When Hank Deerfield receives the call informing him that Mike has not reported for duty, the concerned father heads to the army base in New Mexico to try to ascertain the young man's whereabouts and find out what's up.

Stylistically, ""Elah"" is the polar opposite of Haggis' previous film, the overwrought and overrated ""Crash,"" which fairly screamed its message from every nook and cranny, using its plot points and characters as little more than bludgeons with which to beat the audience into submission.  Here, the writer/director has toned things down considerably, finally trusting the drama and characters to speak for themselves.  Haggis is obviously against the Iraq War but he doesn`t make speeches about it, preferring instead to let the message filter its way through the story, such as having upbeat news assessments frequently playing on radios and TVs in the background as an ironic counterpoint to the foreground action.

In fact, if anything, the film touches on the subject of the Iraq War almost too obliquely at times, permitting the trite whodunit aspects of the story to take precedence over the human drama.  Still, there are some tremendously moving and powerful moments in the film, courtesy of incisive writing by Haggis and shattering performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Susan Sarandan as the young soldier`s parents.  Jones, who is rarely off screen for the duration of the movie, conveys the world-weary stoicism of a man torn between a love for the military and a dawning awareness that his lifelong bellicosity might be in some way responsible for what has happened to his son.  It's an exquisitely internalized and understated performance.  Sarandon receives far less screen time than Jones but still manages to make an indelible impact as a longsuffering woman who may have been forced to go a bridge too far in sacrificing what is most dear to her for her country.  A scene in which the two of them talk on the phone is one of the most emotionally wrenching moments in recent movie history.  Charlize Theron plays a sympathetic homicide detective who assists Hank in his search for the truth.

At an overlong 122 minutes, ""In the Valley of Elah"" is in no hurry to tell its story, an admirable philosophy in and of itself, but one that frequently leads to attenuation and a dissipation of passion.  Nevertheless, in its own unassuming way, the movie makes its case for how boys are sent off to fight old men's wars (the Valley of Elah is where a young David defeated Goliath) and how they often return home so psychologically scarred and emotionally damaged that they can no longer function in a peacetime setting.",1209772800,,2812,4.880252100840337

When the local police call to tell him his son's dead, Hank can't believe it and he enlists Emily Sanders (Theron) a local cop to help him solve his case.  He gets his clues from his son's cell phone files, credit card receipts and testimony from fellow  troop members.

The story's a harsh reminder that the war does not end when ""Johnny comes marching home"" and many of our troops and their families need help they're not getting from either the military or local officials. While Jones initially is only seeking to find his son, he uncovers a lot more about the realities of war than many of us would want to see.  In my opinion, this is Jones' best performance yet.

3303728,2,B0011V7PSC,"Much has been made of the fact that this movie is based on a true story, the 2003 murder of Richard Davis, a story chronicled by Mark Boal in an extensive magazine article, ""Death and Dishonor,"" that appeared in the May 2004 issue of Playboy (an article that can be found online and that is far more thought-provoking than this film).  Some reviews go so far as to say that the film hews closely to the story reported by Boal, but the truth is otherwise. (The film opens with the statement that it was ""inspired by actual incidents"" - a statement that usually heralds significant dramatic license.) Indeed, of adapting his story for the screen, Mr. Boal, who shares writing credits for the story with director Paul Haggis (Mr. Haggis alone is credited with the screenplay), had this to say: ""It's a fictional piece [the film], and so at various junctures Paul [Haggis] and I thought we should change Lanny's story to make it feel more universal."" The Lanny to which Mr. Boal refers is Lanny Davis, the real-life father of the victim and the model for the character Hank Deerfield, whom Tommy Lee Jones plays. Exactly what was done to make the story ""feel more universal""?  Be advised that spoilers follow.

Lanny Davis, upon whom Hank Deerfield is based, is, in fact, a 20-year veteran of the Army, 16 of those years with the Military Police. About a month after his son, Richard Davis, was reported AWOL, from his first 2-day pass following his return from six months in Iraq, Mr. Davis traveled to Fort Bragg, where he spent several days trying unsuccessfully to motivate a missing-person investigation into his son's disappearance by either Army or civilian authorities. Failing in that effort, he returned home. About two weeks later he enlisted the support of his congressman, who had the clout to push the Army to investigate Richard Davis as a missing person. At first, the men in Davis's platoon stonewalled. Then, as the Army pressed its cross-examinations, a single soldier repeated a rumor that had been circulating: four members of the platoon had killed Davis and left his body in a wooded area, and he identified both the men and the area. The area fell under the jurisdiction of the Columbus (Georgia) Police Department, which promptly investigated and quickly located remains of the victim. The same day that remains were found, the Army arrested the four members of Richard Davis's platoon identified as responsible and delivered them into civilian custody.

The stories the men told authorities were of an alcohol-fueled night on the town, their first since returning from six months in Iraq, that turned violent. After being evicted from a club, the group was angry with the victim, whose rowdy behavior, it was claimed, was responsible for their eviction, and an argument ensued in the club's parking lot between the victim and one of the group. Then, so their stories went, the group got into their car and left, but as they drove the argument continued. They stopped at an unfamiliar location, got out of the car, and a fistfight ensued between the victim and the fellow with who he had been arguing. But at some point, one of the men pulled a knife and began stabbing the victim. The others claimed to have tried unsuccessfully to intervene. Afterwards, they dragged the body into a more secluded area, and later they returned with gasoline and set it afire. No one involved with the case believes this version of events - it is far more plausible that three of the group were active participants in the victim's death - but the confessions were enough to secure two convictions: one for murder and one for voluntary manslaughter. (The fourth person, whose presence in the group that night was deemed incidental, received five years probation.) The convictions satisfied authorities but not Lanny Davis, who believes his son was killed because he had knowledge of a rape committed in Iraq by the perpetrators, and he remains angry that has not been investigated.

Throughout the film, the Army is portrayed as impeding the investigation, of covering up, and of not cooperating with local authorities, which, as the record shows, is not true. Neither is it true that the civilian authorities were eager to avoid investigating the case. Lanny Davis did not play Sherlock Holmes and conduct his own investigation; neither did he beat a suspect (he first saw the accused at trial). The civilian detective played by Charlize Theron is fiction. (You'll have to ask Mr. Haggis why her fellow detectives and superiors are portrayed as sexist pigs.) There was no cell phone rich with imagery of soldiers acting badly; no suicide. Richard Davis's only sibling is a sister. (In the film he supposedly had a brother who was killed while a soldier, in a helicopter crash, which plays into an emotional scene in which Susan Sarandon asks Tommy Lee Jones something to the effect of ""couldn't you have left me one?"", suggesting that the father encouraged both his sons to join the military. In fact, Lanny Davis did not encourage his only son to join.)

Furthermore, the film seems to suggest that the killers were fine, upstanding young men so dehumanized by what they saw and experienced as soldiers in Iraq that not only could they viciously kill one of their own, they could be hungry enough afterwards to require stopping for fast food. In fact, the three soldiers convicted of Richard Davis's death were hardly fine or upstanding, a fact that leads to the more interesting question: what happens when we send misfits into an environment like Iraq. And as for stopping for fast food afterwards, I found nothing in the record to suggest that is anything but dramatic license. (Lanny Davis dismisses the suggestion that post-traumatic stress syndrome played a role in his son's murder.)

Some aspects of the film may be inspired by actual incidents, but incidents that had nothing to do with the Richard Davis case and which were included, depending on your perspective, either to stack the deck against the policies and institutions whom the director targets, or to make the film ""more universal."" For example, a woman tells Charlize Theron's character that her husband (a veteran of Iraq) drowned their dog in their bathtub, that she's afraid he will hurt her, and she appeals for the authorities to intervene. The response of Ms. Theron's character is to suggest the woman have her husband seek help from the VA. Of course, the woman is later found drowned in her bathtub. To avoid possible ambush, did Lanny Davis's son run over an Iraqi child rather than stop the vehicle he was driving? No. Might these two incidents be based on real events? Yes. Does their inclusion in this story make it more universal? You be the judge.

Tommy Lee Jones's performance has been justly praised, and he is ably supported by others of the cast. But the problem here is not the performances, it's the script. The film touches upon important issues but does so dishonestly in its quest to make the story ""feel more universal.""",1207440000,112,7023,4.856427378964941

A tricky video transfer capures the grainy imperfection of warfront video and cellphone imagery well. It looks flawed, but right.",1206576000,,823,5.4375

3303739,5,B0011V7PSC,"In the Valley of Elah stays with you long after the movie ends.  Haggis does a commendable job of taking an actual event and extrapolating this haunting film from it.  While some may focus on the political message to its varying degrees, it is a great movie because of the story, the characters, the actors, the writing, and the direction.  The emotional tautness is consistent throughout and every carefully chosen word and gesture adds depth to the story.  Certain phrases, almost ""throw away"" lines, resonate and gather power.  There's a particular line towards the end of the movie when a character says, ""I'm sorry for your loss"" not ""I'm sorry for what I did"".  It speaks volumes about the mindset of returning soldiers and, exponentially, about the mindset (of certain segments) of this country.  Haggis also made the tremendous decision to avoid romanticizing or glorifying his characters: all are flawed in their own way and none are the heroes of our fairytales.  Although the ending reminded me of ""I'm going to hit you over the head with my message just in case you didn't get it during the preceding three hours"" Spielberg, it was also an effective way to bookend the story.",1206489600,,1187,4.841584158415841

3303741,5,B0011V7PSC,"This is the first movie I watch on Apple TV. I downloaded it from iTunes as a rental, and had twenty-four hours to watch it once I started it. The movie was clear, but the audio was not that great. I tried playing around with the Apple TV and the Sony Bravia's settings, and somewhat improved the sound quality. I am not sure whether the audio problem was due to the download or to the settings on my Apple TV and Sony Bravia.

I watched this movie outdoors in my farm, with a bonfire to keep my friends and I warm. I personally loved this movie, but my friends did not. They found it too slow, and didn't really understand what was going on. Two of my friends fell asleep (maybe it was the cold weather and the bonfire).

The movie is about an American soldier who had served in Iraq and who goes missing. His father, played by Tommy Lee Jones, sets out to find him. Throughout the movie we learn of the atrocity of war, and the psychological effect it has on soldiers. The movie portrays that the real villain is not the Iraq war, but war itself. All wars are evil, and there never is a good side. The movie has as a message that not only is the US losing its soldiers in Iraq; it is even losing the ones that return home. The scars of war are hard to heal.

The character of Detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron) is very well played and believable. Some reviewers have commented that she is too beautiful for the role. True, but she plays the role in such a natural and `plain' way that makes her very believable. She does not exude her sexuality, and one tends to quickly overlook her beauty for her genuine concern for the case at hand. She somehow dissolves into her character, and at one point I didn't even realize that it was Theron playing the part. She really is a great actress.

Tommy Lee Jones is another great actor. He expresses emotions so well that he need not say much or move much; the expression on his face says it all.

The title of the movie is derived from a Biblical story. The Valley of Elah is the scene of the battle between David and Goliath. In the Biblical story, Goliath was a ruthless and much feared warrior. He was a giant, and all feared him. No one dared to fight him. But one day, a young boy by the name of David volunteers to fight Goliath. The boy is so small that he floats in his armor. The story relates that upon seeing young David, Goliath charged upon him. Seconds before reaching him and slaughtering him, young David used his sling shot to catapult a stone on Goliath's head. Goliath instantly fell to his death from the blow. Young David, later King David, had to first overcome his fear in order to face and beat Goliath. The message the producers are giving us is clear.

The movie is seen by many as an anti-war movie. I saw it in that light too, and applaud all the crew and actors for this great movie. All wars are wrong and immoral, and no one can possibly justify them! Why do we spend billions of dollars killing each other when Life, given sometime, will do it for us, and for free!

The ending of this movie is one of the most memorable I have seen in a movie, and one that will stay with you for a long time. We see the US flag flying upside down, a sign of distress.

I strongly recommend this movie to all.",1206230400,2,3275,4.245585874799358
3303742,4,B0011V7PSC,"By just looking at this movie as just another anti-war film, I believe one misses the most important part of the film... the love the father (Tommy Lee Jones) had for his sons and the guilt he felt by allowing them to follow his footsteps (Even though their deaths weren't his fault) and for him to not be there for them when they needed him. I also liked the scene when Tommy told the story to the little boy at bedtime. I thought that was an excellent touch that showed that he was a great father even though he had his weaknesses (being to hardcore at times). This movie shows how powerful and influencal a father can be in the lives of his children. I like that. During the movie whenever Tommy's son cried out for help during the war... he cried out for his father. Usually during movies Dad's never get credit or thought about. I'm glad there have been more movies made more recently that shows the value of fathers - The pursuit of happyness, Martian Child, Dear Frankie, John Q... etc. Maybe if the media starts showing that it is normal for a father to care about their children, there would be less dead-beat dads.... just a thought.",1206057600,2,1143,4.421800947867299

Most of the recent spate of ""anti-war"" movies aren't really anti-war at all, because liberals have never actually cared about Americans dying in a foreign country for no real reason, which is what is happening now in Afghanistan and Iraq. These liberal made movies are really about the fact that there is a Republican in the White House and they want one of their own, which they will surely have for better or worse, by next year.

3303744,5,B0011V7PSC,"Tommy Lee Jones delivers an outstanding performance as a father searching for his missing son in the movie IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH.  I was pulled into the mystery of what happened to Hank Deerfield's son from that first phone call at the beginning of the movie.  As a father myself, I've occasionally wondered how my grown children were and if they were all right.  With the Iraq War going on and so many soldiers over there, that phone call from the military is the last thing any of them want to deal with.

As it turns out, Deerfield's son Michael is AWOL, away without leave.  The military is looking for him.  Deerfield says that if his son was in the United States, he would have known about it.

The calm, cool, collected way the movie goes about introducing the characters and the problem in the opening minutes of the film are amazing.  Everything is understated.  Jones shows his concern through his actions, quiet and controlled, rather than with further dialogue with anyone.  Susan Sarandon portrays Deerfield's wife, and their relationship's deepness and emotional complexity is played out in a few short scenes and sparse, meaningful dialogue that never overstates the worry.  You can see it in the characters, and that's the best way on film.

From the beginning, Deerfield comes across as Joe American.  He stops on the way out of town to help a school janitor to properly display the American flag.  His simple gesture, in the presence of his own crisis, really touched me.  And the movie continues to do that all the way through.

At Fort Rudd, the viewer learns that Deerfield isn't just an ex-military guy.  He was Army CID, part of the criminal investigation division.  That caught my attention immediately and amped up the interest.  Deerfield wasn't going to be easily taken advantage of.  You can almost feel the storm looming on the horizon.

I was thoroughly irritated at how quickly the military blew Deerfield's concern off.  However, I can see how this can sometimes be the case.  Still, Deerfield is slyer than anyone thinks, and quickly manages to get his son's cell phone from his things when the sergeant isn't looking.

I enjoyed how Deerfield, though at least fifteen years away from his past as CID and technologically challenged, picked up the reins on his own investigation so quickly.  Everything started falling back into place for him, and his insight into the military mind was great to watch.  Especially after the interaction with the local police began.

Charlize Theron enters the story when Deerfield goes to the police for help.  She plays Emily Sanders, the only female detective on the squad, and takes a lot of crap about her gender and her relationship with their boss.  She's a single mom trying to find her way, and the last thing she needs is to get tied up with Deerfield's problems - especially with the US Army waiting to shut the investigation down at any moment.

The movie took some surprising twists and turns along the way to the solution of Michael's disappearance and who was actually involved.  I loved the way Deerfield broke his ""cover"" as a quiet, concerned father and became a crusading investigator, and I also feared for him when he lost control and endangered the case and their pursuit of the truth.

Throughout the film, no one ever loses sight of the characters.  As much time is given to the development of the characters as to the development of the investigation.  Deerfield's character was great, and Jones played him to a T.  There's one scene in the laundry where Deerfield is washing his clothes that my wife didn't understand.  Deerfield was sitting in his undershirt waiting for his clothes to dry and spots Emily coming to talk to him.  He hurriedly gets up and pulls a wet shirt out of the dryer and puts it on.  I had to explain to my wife that the kind of man Deerfield was wouldn't allow himself to be seen in his undershirt by a woman not his wife.

The Blu-ray disc is packed full of extras relating to the movie as PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).  If you've got loved ones overseas, this movie can be hard to view on several levels.  However, it might also give you a deep appreciation for what they're doing and what the real cost of the war is going to be.

One of the best scenes in the movie is when Deerfield is telling Emily's son the story of David and Goliath, to let him know where his name came from.  Later, at the end of the movie, Emily is telling her son the same story because he wants to hear it again.  This time her son asks her why all the soldiers let a boy go fight their war for them.  After everything that's been revealed in the movie, that question resonates for a long time.

This is a fantastic film and has tremendous acting.  Paul Haggis CRASH, FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS, CASINO ROYALE) wrote and directed.",1205020800,4,4829,4.633686690223793

It did a passable job keeping the story moving along at a comfortable enough pace that I didn't lose my patience, but the thing is, for every two or three exciting segments, we had to put up with two or three uninteresting ones.  To me, that meant the pacing was inconsistent, and the storytelling didn't quite live up to the standards you'd expect.

Furthermore, a few scenes made it appear like not all soldiers are honest when they finally come home from war, and that's not really a good thing to feature in a movie.  It's the kind of story that might be offensive to some people.  I'd rather see the soldiers portrayed as brave people who had to be a part of war and history.",1204934400,,893,4.381818181818182

I don't recall ever having seen such a broad range of emotions conveyed with so few gestures.  Hank Deerfield is a man of few words, but it's amazing what Jones was able to get across with just his eyes.  Sadness, courage, hatred, dumb anguish.

It's an excursion into the heart of humanity--what makes a hero different from you and me, and what makes you and me different from everybody else.

Tommy Lee Jones is spectacular.  Plain and simple.  Watch this movie, if you have any doubt about the quality of his performance.  Jones had two great movie roles in 2007 (the other being ""No Country For Old Men,"" and half the cast of that movie is in this one).  It's a shame he didn't win Best Actor for this...but oh well.  We can watch the movie and enjoy it--or ""enjoy"" it.  You'll have your heart ripped out of your chest; I'm not sure I'd call that ""enjoyable.""

The supporting roles, too, are very well-performed.  Charlize Theron is a bit too sexy for her role, but we'll forgive her; she chews her way through it like it was nothing.  James Franco, Jason Patric, and Josh Brolin make the best of their minor roles.  Susan Sarandon is a wonder; she's upstaged at every turn, of course, but that isn't her fault; her role isn't big enough for her to milk to its full potential.

""In the Valley of Elah"" is not an easy movie to watch; it's an emotional rollercoaster that leaves you breathless, aching, empty.  But it is a movie you SHOULD watch.

I'm no prude, but as a woman, I was put off by the ubiquitous strip club scene. Yes, you could say it added local color, being near an army base and all, but to me it was just the Director or whomever, indulging their adolescent fantasies. It's ironic that a film with such a strong message has to stoop to exploitation of this sort. If this country is ever going to heal itself, someone in Hollywood is going to have to take a stand!

3303752,4,B0011V7PSC,"You can't go wrong with Tommy Lee Jones in a title role.  He perfectly plays the father of the Iraq war vet who returns home and vanishes.  No histrionics, no hysterics, no tears, but that craggy old face of his tells all.  Jones as Hank Deerfield sets out to find out what happened to his son, and ends up discovering a lot more than he might have wanted to.

His son has returned from Iraq a changed man, and not for the better.  He was ordered to run down an Iraqi child (which has really happened, according to some vets) and tries to communicate to his father, through his tears, that he'd done something terribly wrong.  Deerfield throughout the movie repeatedly hears his son's agonized ""dad....daddy"" in his dreams and only at the end do we see how he dismissed his son's anguish.  The latter eventually cracks up, torturing wounded Iraqis and treating women like dirt.

Indeed, many of the featured returning vets have become twisted in some way by their experiences in Iraq, which is no doubt a major point of the film and all too frequently accurate.  The film likely overplays this facet a bit, which is why it gets four, not five stars from me.

Because this film otherwise has superb acting and plot, with a combination of murder mystery, young men warped by war, and decent folks trying to sort it all out.  An emaciated Charlize Theron plays the detective who reluctantly helps out Deerfield in his own informal investigation and must put up with his gruff insults.  She downplays her good looks with a severe hairdo and a pencil-thin body--somebody needs to get her some beef fat and chicken soup immediately.

Susan Sarandon perfectly portrays the worried, then grief-stricken mother, although the old standby retort ""you don't have any children, do you"" has gotten awfully stale through overuse over the years.  Nonetheless, the scene in which Jones breaks the news to her of their son's ghastly death is one of the most heart-wrenching pictures of sorrow and anguish I've ever seen on the screen.  This is fine acting which cuts close to the bone without ever threatening to go over the top.

Also moving was the quiet way Hank Deerfield's father's love for his son is shown, as contrasted to his wife's motherly heartbreak.  It's a nicely nuanced and effective approach the director and writers took

The valley of Elah refers to where David slew Goliath, where the courage of the weak overcame the strength of the mighty.  Unfortunately for the  Deerfields the powerful continue on their course in Iraq and elsewhere.  Paul Haggis and company found out the same when this movie bombed at the box office, despite being a better than average show.  It might be decades before this kind of look at the Iraq war will shine through the miasma we face now.

At the end, in complete reverse of the beginning, Hank Deerfield instructs the local school custodian to hang the American flag--one which his son sent to him from Iraq--upside down, the universal signal of distress.",1204156800,7,2990,4.751937984496124
3303753,4,B0011V7PSC,"Unparalleled performances, a wickedly thought-provoking story, and masterly direction by ""Crash"" director Paul Haggis skyrocket ""In the Valley of Elah"" to the top of the list of best films of the year. While the story builds slowly, the payoff is intense and brilliantly troubling, and demands repeat viewings. Many will walk away from this film with contrasting interpretations of the conspiratorial nature of the army and the detrimental effect war has on human lives, but everyone will undoubtedly leave entertained.

Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones) makes a trip to an army base in search of his son Mike, who is reported as having gone missing. Shortly after his arrival, badly burned body parts are discovered in a field near a gun shop and they are identified as being the remains of Mike. Heartbroken and angry, Hank sets out to discover the heavily guarded truths behind his son's death and those responsible for this heinous crime. Along the way, Detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron), a local cop taking pity on Deerfield's situation, takes extra measures to ensure that the truth is uncovered.

A deceptively simple murder mystery, In the Valley of Elah uncovers the plot behind a vicious murder that entwines the U.S. Army and a neighboring town. Essentially a vehicle for Haggis to comment on the chaos of the Iraqi War, the mixture of crime, drama, suspense and action make this both an engaging and thought-provoking exercise in filmmaking. The film builds very slowly, but it's careful to introduce just enough new elements in each scene that the plot thickens with masterful precision. Occasionally the pacing is off, with the introduction of unnecessary elements that could have been cut to speed up the progression, but the time spent on developing characters is largely appropriate.

Tommy Lee Jones fleshes out a deep, complex character that lives by a strict sense of honor, influenced heavily by the discipline of the Army for which he served as a sergeant for many years. He is anxious to correct those who are ignorant about the importance of patriotism, such as preventing a U.S. flag from touching the ground and absolutely not raising it upside down, which symbolizes a state of disorder and disarray. Yet as he uncovers more about the tragic death of his son and breaks several laws to seek truths and vengeance, he begins to wizen to the corrupted clockwork of the Army and its intense defense of image and members. Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, Tommy Lee Jones delivers one of the best performances of his career.

Charlize Theron's Emily is tough and stern and battles discrimination and prejudice within the police force because she is a woman. Her determination and stubbornness rival that of Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling (from The Silence of the Lambs), and her performance is equally Oscar worthy. Aiding Hank in his mission of justice, she takes hints from his uncanny intelligence, as well as uncovering key clues that draw the shocking conclusion closer. A true hero who isn't afraid to partake in action, including chasing suspects through grungy dark alleys, Theron's character is also fully developed with a wide range of emotions and complexity to match Jones.

Susan Sarandon's supporting performance as the strong but concerned mother of Mike is powerful and tear-inducing and was sadly forgotten for the 2008 Oscars. Other supporting cast including Frances Fisher, Josh Brolin and the many soldiers involved in the conspiracy, deliver emotional and striking performances that demand the spotlight.

The nature of murder mysteries is to build to an unforgettable and unpredictable conclusion, and it accomplishes the detailed setup to the satisfyingly alarming finale quite well. With the intensity of The Silence of the Lambs and an equally baffling title for anyone unfamiliar with the Biblical reference, In the Valley of Elah was one of the first Oscar-worthy films of 2007, and an excellent follow-up to Paul Haggis' critically and commercially acclaimed ""Crash"".

3303754,3,B0011V7PSC,"While I will excuse ""Chicago"" for winning Best Picture since it was at least a little fun, I thought ""Crash"" was one of the worst Best Picture winners in many years. With its overwrought, simplistic approach and lack of any real character development, the film might as well just had characters say ""racism is bad"" every 10 minutes. ""In the Valley of Elah"", Paul Haggis' directorial followup, one can say that he's getting a bit better and even improving in key areas but he falls back on the simple tricks and story conceits that plagued all throughout Crash. It's a good film and I like what it's about, I just don't like the way we get it.

Hank Deerfield is a former Vietnam veteran with a very strong view that the US needs the Military and that none of its uses or personnel are at fault for anything. His son, Mike, who returns from Iraq, is listed as AWOL and Hank tries to find him. Instead of just finding a soldier cutting loose and having fun becomes a bit more as mysteries need to be solved and truths have to be revealed, even if they are truths you didn't even think were possible.

One thing that drove me nuts in ""Crash"", as well as most of Haggis' scripts, is that rather than let the audience figure something out for themselves, the film will not only do it for you but will do it frequently in case you missed it the first time. While Elah isn't as bad, it does end up slipping back into his old routine of having overt symbolism such as its title, taken from the Bible where David met Goliath, which is recounted twice. Could David be the hardworking, tax-paying citizens and Goliath is the government? Or the military? Or the evildoers? Granted it at least allows a story to breathe this time but with things like the Biblical story, as well as its closing shot which is as overt as anything, it's still a small nag.

The film's story itself is interesting and there's a couple interesting tidbits or trivia such as car colors or the upside down flag that I didn't know before but one of the things basically required in a mystery is a drive, a sense of propulsion that makes us ache to see how it would unfold. While the idea of the story is interesting, it's how it was presented that bugged me and the film just sort of....was for the entire film, never really becoming exciting or intriguing. Thank god for Tommy Lee Jones though who brings out another great performance as Hank who says more with his eyes than some shouted ""look at me Oscars, I'm yelling!"" speech. The others are good like Charlize Theron who does another non-glam role and while underutilized, we do get James Franco and Susan Sarandon as well as 2007's comeback kid Josh Brolin who appeared in no less than 4 big movies (this, American Gangster, No Country for Old Men and Grindhouse).

In the wee hours of the morning, occasionally a movie will totally capture my interest and sleep becomes a secondary concern. This was such a film. Tommy Lee Jones, portraying the father of a soldier, receives a phone message from the young man's base in the Southwest advising the father of the soldier's AWOL status. The father, Hank, sure that the young man is still in Iraq, realizes something is seriously wrong and embarks upon his own investigation of his son's disappearance.

This story was based on actual events, which adds poignancy to the film. Hank, an ex-military man himself, who still lives by military code and formality, immediately drives to his son's base to find out what happened. The boy's mother, played by Susan Sarandon, is equally strong but has a limited part in the film. Hank uncovers questionable activity as soon as he arrives - things he didn't believe his son of being involved with; but suspends disbelief in the interests of arriving at the truth. He uncovers the seamier side of soldiers at play, bolstered by a camera cell phone of his son's that he surreptitiously lifts while visiting his son's Army quarters.

He enlists the assistance of Charlize Theron, in another unglamorous role for her as a homicide detective; she somewhat mirrors aspects of her ""North Country"" role as a strong, smart woman up against the boorish macho boys on her squad, stuck doing the pathetic oddball cases of homicide until Hank's son turns up dismembered and burned in a field near the base. Hank, who desperately needs an ally in a place where no one knows him, no one wants to help him, and where the true tale is being covered up anyway, gets through Charlise's character's wall of defense, and between them they find a world neither really wanted to discover; how war, in the present age, desensitizes, dulls the senses of right and wrong, makes monsters of people who were children only bare years before.

If Tommy Lee Jones gets the Oscar for this movie, it will be well-earned; with his dogged determination to get at the truth, he spares his character nothing, and follows every lead. He probably would have made an outstanding detective. Charlize, also, continues to prove that she is not just a pretty face, but a savvy and effective dramatic actor. This was a very good film.",1203811200,4,2507,4.7695852534562215
3303758,2,B0011V7PSC,"I am active duty military so I know what I'm talking about when I say this. Not only that, but I have visited the base (Ft. Hood) that this movie takes place around several times.

This may have been intended to be an anti-war movie, but it is to me, an anti-military movie. It depicts the Army as a bunch of country bumpkin losers who all do drugs and love killing people. The fact is is that we all have random drug tests several times a year, and if we were hiding anything like a pot pipe in our barracks, it would be found by the officers who perform our room inspections every day. Drug use in the military is a terminal offense. If you are caught, you get kicked right out after one offense. Another point I would like to mention is that our rules of engagement (do not fire unless fired upon) regularly put our men and women in danger, get them injured and sometimes even killed. While casualties are inevitable, our current military does more than has probably ever been done in history to prevent them from happening.

Regarding the running over of the little girl, and the messing with dead bodies; I must sadly admit the messing with bodies does happen. It is the charge of the platoon leaders to ensure that this kind of conduct does not happen and they need to do their job as most of them do. I guarantee that no one in my chain of command will be getting away with any of this kind of conduct. Regarding the running over of the little girl, I've never heard of an order like that, BUT the unfortunate fact of modern war is that little children, old women, pregnant women WILL come out with bombs under their dresses, in their purses etc. to kill soldiers. If they are in a combat area and the girl does not move out of the way as told / warned / honked at / etc. I can see that this could become a necessity. Having one vehicle taken out by a harmless looking civilian can cause great damage to an effort to hold or take an area, not to mention the several American lives that could be lost by ignoring the possible threat. A career soldier like the main character in this movie (Tommy Lee Jones' character) would know better. Especially being a Vietnam vet as I think he was, he would know that these types of things have been minimized to a high degree compared to the Vietnam era. If he was so distressed about what happened in this war, he would have deserted during the Vietnam war.

I give this movie 2 stars because the story was somewhat engaging, and while I do find the general theme insulting, I don't think it was as bad as some of the other leftist movies out there. If you are pacifist who hates war, or someone who hates the military, this may be your movie.",1203638400,14,2689,4.299802761341223
3303759,5,B0011V7PSC,"Highly emotionally charged, topped with excellent performances from three Academy Awards winners (Jones, Theron and Sarandon), ""In the Valley of Elah"" is a compelling drama about a Vietnam war veteran Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones), who finds out that his son Mike went missing shortly after returning from Iraq, in October 2004. Already having lost one son who was serving in the Army, Hank sets off to find his son.

What Hank did not expect was to find Mike's butchered and charred remains in a bare field close to a military base.  Hank, knowing the tight-lipped military investigatory services, decides to ask for help from the local police department.  A detective (Charlize Theron) decides to help Hank in his search for truth and Mike's killer.  Through this process Hank discovers truths about his son through Mike's videos made in Iraq, truths that Hank never wanted to believe.

Fantastic performances and true to life accounts (the film is based on actual events) make ""In the Valley of Elah"" a great movie, one that has nothing to do with political opinions of our presence in Iraq.  Just like some truths about our soldiers in Vietnam came out after the fact, some truths are starting to come out now about our soldiers in Iraq.  I should know, as I have two Iraq tours behind me.  This film is not against the war in Iraq - it simply portrays what our young soldiers go through in attempts to deal with horrors of war.  Highly recommended.",1203638400,,1456,4.768924302788845
3303760,5,B0011V7PSC,"As this country continues to struggle with the tragedies inflicted upon all who are being singed and scorched by the Iraq War (and that includes every citizen of this country, whether directly or indirectly), films addressing this war are wither avoided by the theatrical audiences or cause flare reactions of judgment.  Into this milieu writer (with Mark Boal) and director Paul Haggis places this painful examination of the effects and aftershocks of war in the persona of a father whose only son is reported as 'missing' after he has returned from his tour of duty in Iraq.  By keeping the story focused on the effect of the devastation on one man Haggis makes his point all the more clear, and the result is one of the finest documents of the insanity of war that has been released in some years.

Hank Deerfield (Tommy Lee Jones) has served in the military and encouraged both his sons to serve their country (much against the emotional reaction of his wife Joan - Susan Sarandon): his older son is killed in a helicopter crash and his younger son, recently returned from a year's duty in Iraq, is reported as missing. Hank drives to the base where his son was stationed, learns of his son's death 'by friendly fire' at home, and tries t enlist the help of the military to investigate the affair without success. He encounters a sullen police detective Emily Sanders (Charlize Theron) who appears bruised by life in general and by her prejudiced co-workers and military men in particular. Gradually Emily sides with the grieving Hank to explore the horrid details of Hank's son's brutal murder, dismemberment and burning.  Despite endless barriers of red tape and military secrecy lead by Lt. Kirklander (Jason Patric) both Emily and Hank slowly piece together the truth, using email videos Hank's son had sent him from Iraq, interviews with Hank's son's fellow soldiers, and examination of the body parts of Hank's son.  Once the truth is out the effects on all concerned reveal the inevitable permanent scars of war on all concerned.  Yet it is the strength of character as revealed in Hank's responses that drive home the pungent message of this difficult film.

Tommy Lee Jones gives the most subtle performance of his fine career as the grieving yet stoic Hank.  Charlize Theron once again proves that she can disappear into a demanding role like few other actresses.  Susan Sarandon, Jason Patric, James Franco (in a tiny but pivotal role), Josh Brolin, Frances Fisher (in a cameo that is very impressive), and all the young men who play the soldiers involved in the investigation are superb.  The film pulls no punches, yet it also refrains from sensationalizing events - as though Haggis realized that the truth was viciously cruel enough without embellishment.  Special mention should be paid to the fine musical score by Mark Isham, a pulsating, minimalist background that heightens the effect of the film.  This may be a difficult film to watch but it is a necessary experience if we are to constantly re-evaluate our philosophy of war and intervention.

3303761,4,B0011V7PSC,"First of all, I have no idea why this movie was panned or lauded during its theatrical release as some kind of statement for or against the Iraq war. After having watched it, the political ramifications of that war are, in my opinion, totally irrelevant to this movie as a work of entertainment. There have been atrocities in every war since tribes were clubbing each other with mastodon bones, so let's just put that aside.

Having been raised in the military as an Army brat -- and being a veteran myself -- I really love movies oriented toward military subjects, and this movie doesn't disappoint. In many ways, it's territory we've explored before in movies such as ""The Caine Mutiny"", ""A Few Good Men"", ""Basic"", ""The General's Daughter"", ""Rules of Engagement"" (another Jones movie), and many others. Why this one was castigated as being anti-war in any special way is totally beyond me.

We have a stellar cast in what is essentially a ""Courage Under Fire"" genre movie, a Rashomon scenario, wherein Tommy Lee Jones -- the father of a murdered vet -- tries to uncover the details of his son's murder with the help of an outcast female police detective played by Charlize Theron.

Jones is always a marvel to watch, and the supporting cast is also top notch: Josh Brolin, Jason Patric, Susan Sarandon, Francis Fisher (in a gutsy role for a middle-aged woman), as well as the lesser lights.

But in my opinion, Charlize Theron stole this show, hands down.

Having won an Oscar for her incredible performance as the serial killer in ""Monster"" a couple of years back (and keeping in mind her physical transformation for that role), and also bearing in mind her usual public persona as a beautiful woman gracing the red carpet in a slinky gown, it would be easy to dismiss her as a one-hit wonder who got lucky a couple of years ago.

This movie disproves that idea. Though she doesn't transform herself as grotesquely for this role, it's actually a much more subtle and sublime transformation, which in my opinion makes her success in the role even more difficult. Where in ""Monster"" she could hide herself behind the grotesquery of the physical transformation, in this movie she simply makes herself...... plain.

How much harder it is to be a distinctive blade of grass than it is to be a toadstool.

I can't believe she wasn't nominated again for this role.

ANYway.... I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, especially for that performance, but it also worked very well on all levels.",1203465600,40,2482,4.766899766899767
3303762,5,B0011V7PSC,"I have been writing the comprehensive true story behind the murder of Richard Davis titled ""Murder In Baker Company, the forgotten soldier."" I've seen the film several times and even though it is fictionalized, I never cease to be amazed at the thread of truth which runs through Elah from beginning to end. The script was actually written before any major details of the case were available; the trials had not taken place. Yet Paul Haggis instinctively had his finger on the pulse of this tragedy and the far-reaching effects of THIS war. It's absolutely uncanny when I stop to think about Elah's prophetic substance. And whether planned or not, Tommy Lee Jones' performance eerily captures the essence of Lanny Davis right to the core. The film is a labor of love for everyone involved.

This war is different, as they all are. There are very specific issues behind the dramatic increase in PTSD and the violence following our men and women home. Issues that could be avoided if it were not for the profiteering, apathetic system of government in charge of our troops. Everything that is wrong with this war played a role in the events leading to Army Specialist Richard Davis' murder. It is a horrific tragedy that unfortunately serves as a beacon for the truth.

Do you also think that ""E/R"" depicts the daily activities in a hospital?  This movie is a work of fiction.  It does not factually portray the happenings in Iraq, or the heroic actions of our servicemen.  It does, however, serve as a medium for its creators to sway public opinion (Susan Sarandon, anyone?)  And to the poster above who thinks the military is trained to run people over....are you kidding me?

If anyone is wanting to watch a movie that will actually help them learn about the Iraq war, they must wait a little longer.  None of the movies currently out on the subject are remotely relevant.  The programs on The Discovery Channel, The History Channel, and The Military Channel are currently the closest sources you will get to what actually happened/is happening there, without the anti-war distortions (and they don't portray each and every servicemember as a criminal in order to force their political and social positions on their viewers.)

8242548,1,B0011V7PSC,"This is not entertainment, it is slickly packaged propaganda.  If ISIS gathered supporters in Hollywood to make a film to defame and demoralize Americans, they would make this movie.  The messages are:

 American soldiers are all sadistic psychopaths, one step away from killing anyone including their comrades
 American soldiers are all strung out on drugs
 Everyone who comes back from war is psychologically mutilated
 Amid their depravity, they pray at dinner and value the Bible
 The nobility of serving your country, patriotism and bravery itself are myths for suckers
 Males in the military, and law enforcement, treat women with contempt and as degraded sex objects only

Tommy Lee Jones is well known for his far left politics, see Crowdpac, but one would still hope he would have stopped short of this kind of slander of his countrys institutions.

Its one thing to be anti-war, but another to be anti-American or anti-military.  If there had been even one admirable patriotic or military character, the anti-war faade might seem credible, but there isnt.  There would be far more effective ways to draw attention to the fraction of vets who need and deserve counseling and treatment for PTSD than to portray them all as monsters.

This is a pernicious re-hash of the demonstrably false 1970-1980s Hollywood narrative that Vietnam vets were drugged out psychotics who could never successfully fit back into civilian life.  Thankfully, consumers didn't buy the deception this time.  The movie barely broke even and was the 157th ranked film of 2007.
