4229681,5,B003YJEO1A,"I thought this documentary fascinating.  I have been doing some spiritual studying this year (Yeah Kindle!).  I re-watched the show a couple of weeks back when I saw a piece on Dateline NBC featuring the gentleman whose son was murdered on the bus.  It was interesting to see his evolution during that time frame.

I felt that it showed both ends of the spectrum with the fundamentalist Christian woman who I felt was close minded.  But would definitely be interested in learning more of her story.",1310947200,,498,4.744186046511628
4229682,5,B003YJEO1A,"The film is outstanding: the characters are riveting to watch as their stories unfold, keeping you on the edge of your seat. Emotional, funny, charming, moving, ridiculous. I cannot believe that everyone viewing doesn't at some point during the film consider going to visit Lily Dale. Priceless.",1306886400,2,295,5.297872340425532
4229683,5,B003YJEO1A,"Before going into my own opinion exclusively, I would like to simply note that it is interesting that the only other person reviewing this film (at this time) promotes himself as ""Rev. Hernandez,"" and claims to be a Buddhist. He then roundly criticizes the members of the Spiritualist community in Lily Dale for calling themselves ""reverends.""  I've never heard of a ""reverend Buddhist,"" so I can't help but wonder if he isn't projecting some uneasiness about his own representation onto other people.

That being said, I found Nobody Dies in Lily Dale to be lovely overview of the people of the Spiritualist Church in upstate New York.  While it is true that this institution has a checkered past, there are things that are seen and experienced in this film that make you question the popular claim that all of these people are ""frauds.""  The mediums shown in the film do seem, at times, to be rather ""ditsy"" and vague, but they all seem so enveloped in a cloud of happy certainty, that it is tempting to consider the possiblity that their relaxed quality of joy stems from the reality that they, indeed, have found heaven before actually going there.

One point that I definitely agree with ""Rev."" Hernandez about, is the fact that I wish that the film would have contained even more specific information about the Spiritualist Church and its history.  I would have also liked to have seen a more complete portrait of one woman who visted Lily Dale after she lost her son to cancer.  She was a Fundamentalist Christian, and seemed to be bristling with negativity towards the members of the Lily Dale Assembly, but she visited mediums there despite her misgivings.  I would have liked to have known what her final ""story"" within the film would have been, because she does represent the large percentage of people who doubt the veracity of the Spiritualist movement.",1291507200,26,1866,4.809375

4229695,4,B003YJEO1A,I enjoyed it.  It was a good depiction of what Lily Dale is all about.,1434499200,,70,3.6666666666666665
4229696,4,B003YJEO1A,"I had read a book on Lily Dale some time back and enjoyed it very much.  The film was interesting but not as in-depth.  Still, for people who want to  learn more about this old-time community and their beliefs, its good to have a work in a DVD format.  Obviously, some of the people took away more from their readings than others, but that's life; grieving is a tough road to walk, so no judgments here.",1432857600,4,403,4.2631578947368425

4229698,4,B003YJEO1A,"Anyone who has spent any time at Lily Dale can see the ""Hollywood"" spin of this story. Some parts contradict but other parts illustrate the healing experience of many visitors.

4229703,5,B003YJEO1A,I really enjoyed watching this.  If you are interested in the paranormal you will definitely enjoy this documentary.  Are the mediums in this movie fakes or for real?  With some it's hard to tell!,1400803200,,196,4.705882352941177
4229704,5,B003YJEO1A,"This was fascinating - an open-minded look at a town filled with psychic mediums. It gives a fair introduction into Spiritualism, and follows some visitors, even showing what happens in actual readings.",1385769600,,202,5.34375
4229705,5,B003YJEO1A,"Very intriguing and fun to watch. Makes one think about the after life and how we are all connected int he universe. Didn't care for the ""haters"" in the film but it did show how constipated humans have no room in their minds to even consider an alternate belief. What a shame.",1382832000,,276,4.326923076923077
4229706,5,B003YJEO1A,Once again HBO makes available to the public an excellent Documentary showing us now the small town of Lily Dale. It is a place where the living and the dead commune and their voices are heard.,1371686400,,193,4.388888888888889

4229708,5,B003YJEO1A,"I had read books about Lily Dale and I wanted to go there, but I am in Arizona, so I bought this DVD.

 I was surprised at seeing SOME psychics in the DVD who came across as ""wanna be's"". It saddened me. BUT I'd still love to visit and check it all out for myself. I know a real reading brings great relief to a person who has lost a loved one. A reading is never a substitution for grief counseling, but it can be a wonderful experience to know that your loved one is safe and happy.

I loved seeing the homes and scenery. It was fun to watch, I watched it 3 times and shared it with my grandchildren who are also psychic. (I am a Medium) They liked watching the children run through the Fairy forest.
I would recommend it, if you have been there or would like to visit.",1370044800,,771,4.026143790849673
4229709,5,B003YJEO1A,A very good movie to put something in your mind. Was captivated while watching it. A great movie to add to my collection.,1360022400,,121,4.304347826086956
4229710,3,B003YJEO1A,"I am a fan of Michelle Whitedove. My husband is a psychic, and I decided to buy this as a surprise for him while he was recovering from a surgery.

I am your typical snob when it comes to documentaries, or cinema in general. This documentary left everything to be desired and seemed to veer into multiple places -- going nowhere. All the interesting threads were never knotted, just left dangling.

It almost seemed that in trying to portray Lily Dale without bias the documentarians made it more obvious that they were merely voyeurs.

i would much rather hop on Netflix and watch the litany of shows there than watch this -- and I spent almost 20 dollars on it. Shame.",1356134400,,670,4.520661157024794
4229711,2,B003YJEO1A,"Documentary that jumped all over the place.  Not worth the money.
No follow through on anything.  Also kind of boring.",1352678400,,118,4.85
4229712,3,B003YJEO1A,"While I enjoyed this ""documentary,"" I do question that there was actually a protest at the gates. I've been to Lily Dale several times, and everyone who lives there and has for years says there has NEVER been a protest and that the producer actually paid actors to film that scene. If that is true, this filmmaker should be run out of the documentary field.

The sequence of scenes in the film is also really scattered and seems to be short clips spliced together. Someone commented here that people are paying $65.00 for a few minutes. That's not true. It's generally about forty or fifty dollars for a half hour to an hour reading. They did this in kind of ""blurb"" format, jumping from one quick scene to the next. There is no real depth here, and it is impossible to capture the energy of Lily Dale in a film. It is the most peaceful, centered place I have ever been and, living a hectic life, I often physically ache to be in Lily Dale and absorb the amazing energy. Even if a person doesn't believe, the energy is like no other.

They also only have a very short clip of people filing into the healing temple with no explanation of what it is or what is happening. I have gone just to be able to go meditate at the healing temple and get a couple of healings each day. It's beyond healing.

As for the claims that these people are ""frauds"" who are ""ripping people off,"" I would argue that no one is forced to enter the gates anymore than they are forced (at least once they grow up) to enter a church and put money in a collection plate. People are free to go to Lily Dale, yes there's an entrance fee, and roam at will without seeking out a psychic. I'm a firm believer that we all have to experience our own truth and whatever makes us be the best we can be is a good thing.

Overall, it is a solid introduction to the Spiritualist world, but there is much more to the experience than is captured in this film.",1344124800,18,1917,4.258241758241758
4229713,5,B003YJEO1A,This movie is very interesting. It tells you everything you would want to know about Lily Dale and it's people. It's a must have if you're planning a trip there!,1336867200,4,161,4.4
4229724,5,B003YJEO1A,The film shows how many people can get answers to ease thier pain and also answer many questions that are needed. One thing that bothered me is one woman who in the film was too much of a bible banger to see the mysteries of god in front of her being revealed. No offense to anyone religious.,1334966400,,292,4.140350877192983
4229725,5,B003YJEO1A,"I originally saw this as a documentary on HBO.  Amazon was the only place I could find a copy of the DVD.  It is absolutely wonderful!  It leaves the viewer with a choice...to think about what you saw, which  shows both sides of the spectrum of people who have had experiences there...those who were skeptics and became believers in the power of God and the ""spirit world"" and those who totally were not opened minded.  I highly recommend this video.  I also purchased two books about people featured in the docimentary/DVD and they were excellent.  The most important thing about this video is that it was presented as an HBO Documentary...showing an unbiased view and allows the viewer to make their own choice! One thing to keep in mind, this actual documentary type story of God/Spirit world only show people seeking help in dealing with lost ones and wanting closure.  I would love to know if there is more on Lilydale dealing with the ""Spirit World"" in more areas other than closure with departed loved ones.  In reading books from some of the minister/healers that were featured in Lilydale and available through Amazon, so much more is available there!",1331078400,2,1160,4.788944723618091
4229726,5,B003YJEO1A,I heard about Lily Dale from a program I was listening to on the radio and immediately ordered No One Dies in Lily Dale. I have now watched the dvd five times and will surely watch it again and again and hope to visit there one day. There seems to be great peace in Lily Dale.,1328486400,,276,3.9464285714285716
4229727,5,B003YJEO1A,"This was the best Christmas gift ever!  The person I bought it for was so excited and everyone thought it was the best gift for her.  They were a bit disappointed they didn't think about it themselves.  This is a great documentary, everyone should watch it.",1326758400,,257,4.543478260869565
4229728,2,B003YJEO1A,"This documentary didn't really seem to be of the same quality as other HBO documentaries I've seen.  It gave a decent history and description of Lily Dale, but that's about it.  They interviewed many residents and followed a couple of visitors, but it was disappointing to say the least.  Many ""stories/people"" they showcased seemed to be left unfinished or given very little info in their readings.  It seems HBO was trying to be objective in the filming, but it just turned out to be kind of boring and uneventful.",1325376000,3,516,4.764044943820225
4229729,5,B003YJEO1A,THIS IS A GREAT DVD AND NICE TO SEE MANY FRIENDS IN IT !! iF YPOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TO LILY DALE YOU NEED TO GO . IT IS MAGICAL !!,1323302400,2,128,3.161290322580645
4229730,5,B003YJEO1A,"I am not usually a big fan of documentaries--however, this one is just great.  One aspect I like is how there's no narration for the entire movie.  You meet the mediums at Lily Dale and then four people are followed; you see there experiences and what they come to believe is the result of their visits at Lily Dale.  Even if you're not into anything metaphysical, it's a great documentarty--the story lets you form your own opinoin of what  you believe.",1318204800,5,454,4.567901234567901
4229731,4,B003YJEO1A,"This documentary gives a good long look at Lily Dale, a Spiritualist community in upstate New York. It follows a number of individuals who are there to try to connect with departed loved ones, showing a variety of mediums and their methods. There are tears of happiness and of frustration, showing that it's not always easy to make the connection yet celebrating the occasional break-throughs. It leaves one with a wish for a more complete and in-depth look at Lily Dale itself; its residents and its life throughout the year.",1316908800,3,526,4.855555555555555
4229732,5,B003YJEO1A,"This video is a very good description of Lilydale, NY. I travel to Lilydale every summer at least once or sometimes twice a summer.  I lost my mom, dad, husband, my little buddy Taco (my dog) my father-in-law and a close cousin all within 5 years. I don't know what I would do without Lilydale. Just knowing that I can go there and get messages from my deceased loved ones really help me deal with the grief of loosing all of them, especially my husband who was so young when he passed away unexpectedly in 2007.

The mediums in Lilydale are all registered in that community and belong to the Spiritual Church. I have been traveling there since 2003 when I first discovered Lilydale by the book, Lilydale, The Town That Talks To The Dead. My dad had passed away in 2002 and suddenly I start having unexplained things happen to me. My very first reading in Lilydale really made me a believer. The unexplained things that were happening to me were explained to me in my first reading from my dad and he told me something about each of my brothers and sisters, my kids, and my neices and nephews and my mom. I have 7 brothers and sisters and 2 kids and a lot of neices and nephews. Everything he told me were things that no one else knew. There are many times I will talk to someone about something that I wanted answers to and when I go to Lilydale my husband or parents will give me the answers.

Lilydale is a nice peaceful place to go. It is like walking into another world. There are no Televisions, phones and modern conveniences in the places to stay there. It is a very spiritual town. It is like going back into the 1800's.  Everyone is there for the same reason and everyone leaves there happy to know that they have just talked to their deceased love ones. A few days in Lilydale once a year helps you deal with the loss you live with when you get home and have to live your everyday life without your loved ones.

God put every human here on earth and I believe God wants us to have the experiences we have in Lilydale to help us through our grief. He has a reason for everything and he gave the mediums in Lilydale the gift of communicating with the dead to help us live on this earth and learn the lessons we are here to learn before it is our time to go.

The video of No One Dies In Lilydale really is true to its word. It is just nice to know that there really is a place on this earth that we can go to and know that we are not getting scammed by fake mediums. Lilydale, NY is the largest spiritulist community on earth. When it is time to leave and go home you really don't want to leave. Thats how peaceful and serene this town is. The way I see it is that there are hundreds of religions on earth and if we only had one religion earth would be a pretty boring place to be. I am Roman Catholic and I am also a Spiritualist. I believe we can talk to the dead even though the Roman Catholic Church doesnt but I don't care. It helps me to get through my day knowing my loved ones are around me and that I can talk to them through a medium.  God doesnt care what religion we are, he made them all and he still loves all of his people as long as we all believe in him and live a good life.

I recommend this video to anyone that has a hard time dealing with their loss of a loved one and I also recommend that a visit to Lilydale will really change the way you live and deal with life without your loved ones. All I can say is Thank God for Lilydale.",1313884800,41,3462,4.1109467455621305
4229733,5,B003YJEO1A,"This documentary was definitely worth the purchase. A very fascinating look at an increasing world-wide phenomenon. There were a few extremely touching moments in this film, but I think they were trumped by the tons of inspiration I received to further explore the subject. Having lived in NY my whole life, with out hearing a whisper of this place, I think I owe it to myself to plan a fun visit and do a little investigating with a couple of friends. Hopefully I can give an update to this review, sometime in the future!",1311897600,3,523,4.574468085106383

8409445,3,B003YJEO1A,"Nice little documentary, but could've been a little more in depth.  Being a beginner psychic/medium, I had wanted to hear more on how they perform their service using their wonderful gifts. I would view it on Amazon Video before you purchase it.",1516838400,2,245,4.833333333333333
8409446,5,B003YJEO1A,"As I had been warned, I watched it with a pinch of salt. It is actually a fun game to spot the impostors from the real thing. To check whether your medium is leading you is : does he/she ask you questions ? (big no, no), does he/she keep it generic ?
The whole love, letting go and be with joy is a recurrent theme and the spirit world is really full of that so it's OK for he/she to tell you about that.
Basically your reading should be at 50% of the time spent identifying who has come to see you and NO ! mediumship is NOT a telephone call, you will never know who's coming. Again, if you're sitting across from someone telling it's specifically who you came to talk to, they are lying, unless they give you very specific details. Only answer with yes or no. Please help keep the charlatans out of business.
as for the movie, it's like a documentary about Disneyworld : it's colourful, there are those who buy into it, the doubters and some real magic too.",1492560000,,959,4.217391304347826
