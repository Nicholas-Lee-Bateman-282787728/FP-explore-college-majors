3930973,4,B002HI6LGK,"Who knew John Abraham had it in him? The Bollywood hunk, who has long been dismissed as eye candy, delivers an astonishingly strong performance that establishes him a serious actor. His character, Sam, who's as American as apple pie, goes through wrenching experiences after 9/11 because he's Muslim, and Abraham more than meets the demands of the role. Neil Nitin Mukesh is spot-on as Sam's college buddy, the sensitive Omar, who is scared out of his wits and trying desperately to save his own hide as well as his dear friend's. Katrina Kaif gives a competent performance as Sam's wife, despite the limitations of her rather underdeveloped character. Irrfan Khan is impressive as usual, this time as a Muslim FBI agent who uses any means necessary to catch terrorists. The plot is not without flaws, and the climax could have been better finessed, but the film is an intelligent, balanced, and gripping story of friendship and betrayal, persecution and patriotism, told from the perspective of an American minority. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1253750400,4,1252,5.809782608695652

I loved watching the 3 lead actors in the film and yes I cried my eyes out at the end during that emotional scene.

I think I will be ordering more films that star John Abraham and Katrina Kaif from now on.",1352937600,2,448,4.022471910112359

3930986,4,B002HI6LGK,"Fantastic cast, uniquely expert handling of terrorism - this one's a winner. As the other reviews have noted, all three leads are flat-out fantastic. While John Abraham has garnered the most praise, Neil Nitin Mukesh is just right as the hapless pawn in an FBI operation launched in the aftermath 9/11 to track a sleeper cell. As truths are revealed, and the noose tightens, you can sense his character gasping for air - reminiscent of Henry Fonda coming apart in Hitchcock's under-seen ""The Wrong Man."" All the characters in the movie, civilian and law enforcement alike, are wrong ""men"" at the wrong time. Structurally, ""New York"" is obvious and Abraham's flashback sequence threatens to fall apart more than once. Someone like Scorcese would have filmed the whole gripping story head in sequence, making us feel the layers of despair and betrayal chipping away at the promise of American dreams. Regardless, ""New York"" is powerful Bollywood with the courage of its human - and laudably humane - convictions.",1278720000,3,1010,5.053892215568863
3930987,4,B002HI6LGK,"Some may be offended by a film that has you feeling sorry for a man like Samir.  However this film is about more than just friends caught up in 911.  I find the director and writers did a satisfactory job of showing the perspective of an Indian in this 'war on terror' versus an Arab.  This film is about three characters from India who find themselves at a univeristy in New York. They become friends and find some popularity. Two of them, Samir and Maya would end up married.  But after 9/11 one of them; Sam, becomes involved in an investigation surrouding terrorism. He is detained, questioned and held for about 6 months. The waterboarding scenes show you how the US got answers from Sam. Upon his release, Sam is distant and tortured by what he went through. His old school friend Omar visits him to find Sam to be a changed man. What happens is that the FBI uses Omar spy on Sam. Why? Sam is suspected of plotting terror activity.  Omar of course feels quite ashamed at what he is doing behind his friend's back.  At this point the audience cannot decide whether Sam is innocent or is indeed seeking revenge for what was done to him. Sam's wife Maya is seen as someone with questionable ties (involving herself with detainees after 911).  During the film I admired the relationship between the three.  I thought this film would be about harassment the three would get from the public...boy was I wrong.
I will not reveal who Samir was or what happens to him, but will say the film had the right amount of suspense for a 2 1/2 hour viewing. Of course the was dramatic. I give a thumbs up to the flow and directing in the film. One is able to follow each chapter even though flashes of information is given at times. I couldn't stop watching.

N.B Facts about US detainees were given at the end of the film regarding that the methods used on detainees failed to lead to the arrest of about 1000 men.",1275177600,2,1904,4.417142857142857
3930988,3,B002HI6LGK,"Is it just me or is this the umpteenth Hindi movie to bash the United States? It just seems like some Hindi movie makers have an idea in their head that just won't leave them alone and that idea involves the United States, terrorism and injustice. Frankly, I am tired. New material please!

Coming to New York, the movie seemed to lack depth. There really isn't much background information about Maya (come up with a new name please) and Sameer (again, new name needed). Sure, Maya gives a brief run down to Omar about her parents and Sam's, but they seem to be absent during some crucial moments, like when Sam is released from the detention center. Where were they?

John Abraham is earnest, Neil Nitin Mukesh needs to tone down on the histrionics and Katrina Kaif is eye candy. Watch this movie if you want to see the U.S. take another hit from U.S. bashers or have nothing else to do.

Also, this movie does not present both sides of the situation. The only view really presented here is that of someone who is not American. When Irfan Khan's character, an FBI agent (this talented actor seriously needs to consider getting roles such as the one in The Namesake and stay far away from the police man type roles he has been doing) does manage to speak out and state his opinion in the midst of Mukesh's tirade, he is given one sentence with which to explain the U.S.A's side of the story.

Good time pass, but only that.",1273449600,6,1423,4.461538461538462

Although I did not expect the ending it was still worked very well with the story.  The music combined with the emotional ups and downs of the story telling makes this truly a compelling movie.

3930992,5,B002HI6LGK,"a great movie. taut direction, well made action sequences, good songs (especially the slow number tuune jo na kahaa). It doesn't take any sides (US Government or aggrieved muslims). both john abraham and neil nitin mukesh play their roles exceedingly well. the movie has some scenes of torture at gitmo, and violence, but none of the usual bollywood silliness like hero bashing the bad guys, rescuing his lady love, endless songs etc.",1259884800,10,434,5.041666666666667
3930993,4,B002HI6LGK,"This is a good quality first Blu Ray from Yash Raj. Image and sound quality are up to snuff. As it should be with brand new films that had a digital intermediate which is the source for this BD. 2 negative points are present nonetheless:
- Yash Raj logo superimposed for some seconds at the start of songs. Unnecessary and annoying. Logos don't belong on Blu Rays!
- No subtitles for supplements so some Hindi sections are incomprehensible if you don't speak Hindi
A good first effort worth a purchase if you like the film.",1256342400,5,523,4.515789473684211
8370388,4,B002HI6LGK,"Good movie, good plot, important message, but several of the scenes that were supposed to be in New York were actually in Philadelphia. The Brooklyn Market was actually shot in the Italian Market on 9th Street in South Philly, not 15th Street (where Sam supposedly got off the bus), let alone Brooklyn. Montrose Street is in South Philly.  The first Building where John Abraham was on the window scaffolding was used to be the First Pennsylvania Bank Building on 15th and Market Streets in Center City Philadelphia.  When Maya is sitting in front of the window in the FBI Conference Room you can seen Philadelphia City Hall in the background. One scene was shot driving across the Ben Franklin Bridge. And the restaurant where Omar met the FBI agent (where Maya saw Omar standing outside) had a Philadelphia Police Department SAVE Program sticker in the window.",1524355200,,861,4.890410958904109

I was supposed to get the speaking role in scene, but the other actor in the front with Neil Nitin Mukesh is S.A.G., so he had the right of way in a manner of speaking)....
