8729568,3,B0142YXYNE,"I read on a Skynyrd message board that this was supposed to be the ""Volunteer Jam"" concert that the surviving members of Lynyrd Skynyrd  did with Charlie Daniels Band in 1979.  I was disappointed when I received this DVD because it is actually a concert at Winterland from April 27, 1975, which I already had.  This concert includes a lot of songs from their current album at the time ""Nuthin' Fancy.""  The track list for this DVD is:

1. Whiskey Rock-A-Roller
2. I Aint The One
3. The Needle And The Spoon
4. Im A Country Boy
5. Gimme Three Steps
6. Dont Ask Me No Questions
7. Saturday Night Special
8. Railroad Song
9. Call Me The Breeze
10. Sweet Home Alabama
11. On The Hunt
12. Free Bird

The line-up at this concert was Ronnie Van Zant, Allen Collins, Gary Rossington, Leon Wilkeson, Ed King, and Artimus Pyle.",1448236800,8,817,4.413333333333333
8729569,5,B0142YXYNE,I enjoy a band that draws you into the act by presenting a spectacle on stage with great musicianship. Southern rock has a melodic base played hard but songs that you can sing along to. The sound and picture quality of this DVD makes it one to be played time and again. Rock on Lynyrd Skynyrd,1447200000,,292,4.232142857142857
8729570,1,B0142YXYNE,"As you know, there was a plane crash in 1977 that caused the band to disband to 1987. To say this is a recording from 1979 would be wrong.",1447200000,,138,3.793103448275862
