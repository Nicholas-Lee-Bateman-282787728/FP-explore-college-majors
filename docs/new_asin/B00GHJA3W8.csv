8623236,2,B00GHJA3W8,My 2 year old loves Sesame Street and especially Elmo. These movies were disappointing. They were more setup like a Sesame Street episode than one of their movies. Also the clips were so old (I'm talking 20 year old Julia Roberts) and other clips clearly from the 80s. These did not hold my daughter's attention at all. I would recommend Abby in Wonderland. This is more of a movie and my daughter loves it...more what I was hoping these would be setup like.,1416873600,,458,4.530120481927711
