7907407,1,B00000F8IR,I love the original Dark Shadows and I've already purchased the first ten collations and plan on getting the eleventh soon. But who's going to pay over $227 for twelve episodes of a TV show when you can get entire seasons of most other shows on DVD for less then $50?,1116979200,,267,4.254901960784314
7907408,5,B00000F8IR,"This miniseries was awesome! I loved the original 60's soap, but this revival series had fantastic sets, scripts, costumes and acting. Sadly, the Gulf War ruined it before it ever had a chance. Constantly interrupted by the war coverage, nobody got to see the show in any sort of sequence. Such a shame. But you can still see the 13 episodes on video (MPI Home Video-- where's the DVDs?). The series started out a little slow, but by episode 5, it was rocking!!! The cast was amazing: Ben Cross as Barnabas Collins and horror queen Barbara Steele as Julia Hoffman? Need I say more?  Michael T. Weiss (The Prentnder) Joanna Going, Jean Simmons and Adrian Paul (Highlander) make up a fabulous supporting cast. How sad that NBC didn't give it another try after the war was over. Being a huge Barbara Steele fan ever since Black Sunday (1960)and Pit And The Pendulum (1961), I was thrilled to see this totally unique cult actress in front of the cameras again. This series kept the camp of the original series, but added class. Hear Dan Curtis is going to try this one for a third time soon? Mr Curtis, if you do, get Cross, Steele, Simmons, Going, Weiss and Paul to reprise their roles. How can you possibly top a cast like that? Otherwise, don't bother.",1115251200,,1251,4.584821428571429
7907409,5,B00000F8IR,"The original Dark Shadows aired as a daytime series from 1966-1971. This revival was aired for half a season in 1991 and got me so hooked at the time I started watching the oringinal serial on videotape. This has excellent atmosphere, sets, etc. The only thing that brings it down is the casting and acting, but even that's pretty good, just not great. Get this to see a classic gothic piece or if you want to see what all the Dark Shadows hoopla was about, it's a great introduction.",992390400,,484,4.449438202247191
7907410,5,B00000F8IR,"i enjoy the original dark shadows series from the mid '60's to early '70's but, the 1991 version of dark shadows rules. too bad it only lasted 12 episodes. i would love it if nbc would re-broadcast all 12 episodes and cbs re-broadcast the mini series.",982454400,4,251,4.478260869565218
