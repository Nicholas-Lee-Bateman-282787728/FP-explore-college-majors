7908055,5,B00000FBOZ,"This is another one of my favorite Roaring Glory Warbirds DVDs.  The bright paint job on this Thunderbolt is amazing!  It was even more amazing watching it fly!  That is the real strength of this series; the planes fly again and the viewer gets an earful of the engines roar and an eyeful of the speed, power and grace.  The series provides information on the history of the plane and it's specifications.  Often, there is a reenactment to try and capture the experience with the aircraft and these, unfortunately, fall short of some viewers expectations (as evidenced by one reviewer).  The original pilot training films are fabulous!  I recently purchased the TBM Avenger dive bomber&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roaring-Glory-Warbirds-Vol-4-Grumman-TBM-Avenger/dp/B00000FBP1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roaring Glory Warbirds, Vol. 4: Grumman TBM Avenger</a>&nbsp;and after watching it a couple of times, felt like I could fly it!

I highly recommend these DVDs.  If you can't own or fly these planes, Roaring Glory Warbirds DVDs are the next best thing!",1344470400,,1610,7.382198952879581
7908056,1,B00000FBOZ,"I jumped at a chance to get a good DVD focusing on the P-47. Unfortunately that did not happen. What I got turned out to be a mismatched collection of scenes made up of some old, b&w, uninteresting shots with a few gun camera images here and there. All those were sprinkled lightly among a great many recently made color shots of somebody's very well maintained P-47 with a gawdy paint job not remotely suggestive of this great aircraft's role in helping to save the world. An attempt is made to weave a story or two into the  DVD, but fails miserably. As a first or second year film student's production it would be received with a few yawns.",1154563200,4,643,4.4033613445378155
7908057,3,B00000FBOZ,"It's a nice video, but it's a bit too superficial for my taste. I want more details, and I want to see all the little details of the aircraft. Nice aerial shots though, and the training film is interesting.",933465600,5,206,4.3076923076923075
