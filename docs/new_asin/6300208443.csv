257580,3,6300208443,"In the introduction to one of his routines, Lenny Bruce expressed his hatred for the clichd contrivances and sanctimoniousness of Hollywood message movies, but made one exception - Stanley Kramer and Mark Robson's Home of the Brave. Which seems particularly ironic today since in the intervening six-and-a-half decades the message has been handled much more impressively by other films and the film now seems at times ripe for parody in its naivet and clumsiness: it's an undeniably important film, but it's often not a particularly good one. Arthur Laurents' original play dealt with anti-Semitism among front line soldiers, but with Crossfire changing its murdered homosexual into a murdered Jew two years earlier, screenwriter Carl Foreman opted to change the play's Jewish soldier who cracks up due to a toxic combination of what we now know as post-traumatic stress disorder and a lifetime of racist abuse into a black soldier instead. The change works well, but the film often doesn't: it does a reasonable job of hiding its very low budget (though the voices of the unseen Japanese soldiers taunting the G.I.s are laughably poor), but much of the dialogue is horribly on the nose (there's much talk of fried chicken and watermelon), the psychiatry diluted into layman's terms for a climactic miracle cure (though the film does at least threaten a relapse) and the optimistic ending feels awfully Hollywood.

What does still work, Jeff Corey's idealist Dr Irving D. Explainer psychiatrist aside, are the performances, with James Edwards making the most of a rare substantial role for a black actor in the 1940s in the lead, avoiding the hamminess of some of his later performances by keeping his emotions and anger pent up for most of the picture, and Frank Lovejoy and Steve Brodie impressing as two of his companions on the fateful mission. While Lloyd Bridges thoroughly decent old college friend tries his best with an idealised role he seems too old for in the flashback scenes, the trio of Edwards, Lovejoy and Brodie have more shades of grey to work with, and it's their frayed interaction that keeps the film compelling even when Dimitri Tiomkin's overblown score is cranking up the volume and hitting you over the head as the choir tries to impress you with the monumental importance of it all. Of course, you have to bear in mind that in the still-segregated 1949 this was daring taboo-busting stuff, especially when so many black actors were still reduced to playing shuffling racial stereotypes for cheap laughs if they wanted to work (something the film does touch upon), but seen today it's more historically important and influential than dramatically convincing.

Olive's Region A-locked Blu-ray release has come in for some criticism because of the master material used, which has its fair share of scratches and contrast problems in a couple of shots, but as an extremely low budget independent production made under the radar this is a film that probably never looked that great even when new. But within the limitations of changed ownership, poor storage and no budget for a full restoration it's a respectable transfer of a print that few would complain about if they saw it projected at a revival house. As usual with Olive releases there are no extras, though.",1403136000,2,3289,5.021978021978022
257581,4,6300208443,"Set in the Pacific Theater, a small group of soldiers are volunteered to map an island held by the Japanese. The movie is based on a hit Broadway play by Arthur Laurents. Originally, the lead character was a young Jewish soldier, who becomes a victim of anti-Semitism. Here, our hero is a young African American played by James Edwards, who delivers a dimensional, believable performance, paving the way for actors such as Sidney Poitier and Denzel Washington.

The story deals with bigotry and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Edwards character, Private Peter Moss, returns from the mission unable to walk. He isn't wounded  not in the flesh  but harrowing events on the island as well as his life, have taken a toll. We find out what happened in a series of flashbacks as a therapist tries to heal Moss from his psychosomatic paralysis.

Home of the Brave is a bold film on two major counts: It deals with racism and with PTSD, a disorder that wasn't even recognized at the time. Viewers today may find the treatment and solutions predictable. Still, this was a courageous film in 1949, made when Hollywood experienced a flash of social consciousness. The performances are all good. Its now relatively unknown  and Olive Films, a young company dedicated to bringing back classic, independent and foreign films  gets major kudos for its HD release.
It isn't a pristine restoration - there are has dirt and scratch marks - but contrast, and black and gray scales are good. The picture has a nice, overall grain. All that's forgotten, however, as the story plays out. Dialogue and score come through clearly on the DTS HD mono soundtrack.

Would have loved some extras and its too bad Olive didn't provide any. Still, what a find!  Kay Reynolds",1402704000,2,1742,4.841750841750842
257582,5,6300208443,"Quality acting from a cast headed by Frank Lovejoy, Lloyd Bridges, Steve Brodie and James Edwards, strong direction by Mark Robson, plus a powerful well-written script, make HOME OF THE BRAVE (1949), Stanley Kramers production about racial prejudice, one of the most memorable WW2 drams ever filmed.

Carl Foreman adapted Arthur Laurents stage play, in which the central character was Jewish rather than African-American.  The plot adjustment was made because there had recently been two other films (i.e. GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT, CROSSFIRE) dealing with anti-Semitism and the producer feared that that theme might be overdone.

The story, conveyed mostly in flashback, tells of a reconnaissance mission on a vital Pacific island.  One of the soldiers is black; another is a bigot.  Tensions between them and, indeed, the entire squad, build rapidly to a tense, hard-hitting climax that sees one man dead, another wounded and a third paralyzed because of his psychological upheavals.  Good ideas.  Good action.  Great movie.

257584,3,6300208443,"Home of the Brave, 1949 film

In the night ships shell an island, troops are sent to invade this enemy island. This is the story of one incident on one island. One soldier has lost his memory and is paralyzed from the waist down. Major Robinson tells the story of the reconnaissance mission. ""Let's leave the thinking to headquarters."" The soldier from Engineering arrives, the others are surprised. Finch knows him from school (he played basketball). They are the best men for this job, a picked crew. There is some disagreement about the personnel. Finch says ""yes"". The doctor has a treatment for his patient. Will it cure him? ""Maybe."" Moss begins to recall the past. TJ made cracks about him. We learn more about Moss' past.

A boat brought them to the island at dusk. They come ashore. One man has a tommy gun. They walk through dense growth. Finch loves C-rations. Moss has friend chicken for them (he knows somebody). [Smoking in the dark?] They talk about the future. The sentry has the tommy gun. Moss surveys the land. The soldiers talk about their lives. TJ makes another crack, there is a fight. [So who doesn't fit in?] Moss tells about his past. A shot warns them. ""Got `im!"" Finch makes sure that sniper is dead. The men return to the beach. Finch looks for the map case, and is shot. Moss returns with the important map case to save the mission. The major tells them the map is more important than any man. ""There's nothing they can do."" Screams disturb Moss. TJ is sent to check out the buried boat.

We hear more about the men's lives as civilians. Mingo tells about a letter from his wife. Moss hears a bird call in the night! Finch has returned to the clearing alive. Moss is first happy, then very sad. The other men return for Moss. The enemy soldiers draw near. But Moss can't walk! The tommy gun keeps the enemy away. They leave the island for the boat, whose twin machine guns keep the enemy away.

IT was TJ who carried Moss off the island! Moss tells about his feelings, about leaving Finch. The Captain explains why Moss couldn't walk after Finch crawled back to the clearing. Moss will be sent back home. The doctor explains why every soldier is glad when a friend is shot: ""It wasn't me"". Then guilt takes over. People look down on others so they somehow feel superior. ""Do you believe it?"" ""Get up and walk."" An insult creates a miracle.

The static scenes show its stage origin. It is a low-budget production to match its expected audience. Was it ""ahead of its time""? The guilt from a wounded friend can explain the policy of not leaving any soldier behind. This effort may expiate any guilt feeling that could result. This is a good example of a message movie that uses the ""talking cure"" to solve a problem. Does it work in the real world?",1326153600,,2775,4.508946322067595

I am keeping the DVD as it is the only copy I could fine,  the message is somewhat obscured with all of the washouts, skips, lost dialog...but perhaps the message of understand, patience, and tolerance can be learned by watching such a bad reproduction.

257587,5,6300208443,"The film re-enactment of the stage play was a break through for black actors as James Edwards portrayed an intelligent soldier who had developed a friendship growing up with a white teenager played by Lloyd Bridges. Sent on a mission to a Japanese held island to gather intelligence, the mission goes awry and Lloyd Bridges character is captured and tortured by the Japanese. James Edwards is forced to listen to the sounds of Bridges torture. The Americans escape, leaving Bridges behind and Edwards deeply scared by the experience. He is sent for psychartic care and under the influence of drug therapy re-lives growing up black with his white friend. In the end, the character played by Frank Lovejoy who has lost his arm and Edwards team up to work together by opening a bar in post war America, an early portent of blacks and whites being able to break out of traditional stereotypes.",1259107200,5,889,4.816993464052287
257588,5,6300208443,"One of the most interesting movies that I always wanted to see was this movie. I thought Lloyd Bridges would play this troop dogging on James Edwards character, but come to find out that Bridges and Edwards characters knew each other as children, and though Bridges is accepting of him, the others are more cagey of him. A very interesting character study on a platoon of soldiers in a precarious and delicate situation. I wish it was on DVD by now but sadly, it hasn't made the transition yet. I was blessed to see it on TCM (Turner Classic Movies)some years back.",1217548800,3,565,4.549019607843137
257589,5,6300208443,"Watched this one having read Donald Bogle's book and curious about James Edwards, MGM's first black leading man in the 1940s.  Bogle paints Edwards as a dangerous rebel, skilled in New York acting techniques and like other newcomers to the screen, Brando and Clift, striving to bring a new realism to glossy studio confections.  And in the period there seems to have been a shortlived interest in producing progressive, ""social awareness"" pictures that inevitably included racial struggle.  All of the Hollywood studios made one or two apiece during a single year, and MGM turned out this one (along with INTRUDER IN THE DUST, an old fashioned, classic film compared to the B-movie innovations of HOME OF THE BRAVE).  It is a curious piece of work, but Edwards' performance is transfigurative.  He rips up the screen as Private Peter Moss, a black serviceman attached to a white volunteer platoon of engineers assigned to mao out a dangerous Pacific atoll at the height of World War II.

Blacks weren't integrated into the larger Armed Services, and only later would Harry Truman force the policy of integration down the army's throat, but of course there were individual liberals and ""social conservatives"" everywhere, even during the 1940s.  Lloyd Bridges plays a boyhood friend of ""Mossy,"" and he seems genuinely, even freakishly colorblind, not understanding why Moss has a problem being his friend.  For him, racism doesn't exist except if individual people see it as a problem.  His character, Finch, a warm volkstmlich type of guy, gets captured by the Japanese on the island and the rest of the platoon, in hiding while surveying.  Were the Japanese so cruel as this movie makes them out to be?  To lure the remaining men out of the underbrush, they pierce Finch with bayonets to make him scream, over and over again.  No wonder Mossy suffers from post traumatic stress and loses the ability to walk again!

A kindly yet gruff psychiatrist (Jeff Corey, authoritative and hammy as Freud himself) is assigned to snap Mossy out of it and return him to society in one piece.

But how can he do that when society itself has race consciousness embedded in it?

It's the rare US film in which a contemporary poem, in this case Eve Merriam's ""The Coward,"" is given a full and dramatic close reading that preciptates the action on the one hand, and on the other helps to characterize one of the other GIs, the gruff sergeant, Mingo (Frank Lovejoy), whose wife supposedly wrote the poem, then a Dear John letter to him.

- Only we two, and yet our howling can

Encircle the world's end.

Frightened, you are my only friend.

And frightened, we are everyone.

Someone must make a stand.

Coward, take my coward's hand.

While Edwards is ostensibly the main character, HOME OF THE BRAVE is Corey's show too, and their pas de deux in the film's last quarter has the genuine power and sweep of director Mark Robson's best work.",1161561600,19,2921,4.823293172690763

Every bit as good as I remembered, a thoroughly enjoyable, intense film to watch, and an important piece of cinema history.
The year is 1949bigotry is addressed, PTSD is addressed (not by that name, of course) and a man of color has a leading role in a motion picture.  This was a groundbreaking movie, most definitely.
The acting is outstanding by all members of the small cast.  Perhaps the psychotherapy is oversimplified, and may even seem dated by our current standards, but depicting that sort of treatment for WWII vets, especially in 1949, is way ahead of its time.  The video and auditory quality are fantastic.  No extra featurestoo bad, because if ever a movie screamed out for an audio commentary by a film historian, this would be the one.
