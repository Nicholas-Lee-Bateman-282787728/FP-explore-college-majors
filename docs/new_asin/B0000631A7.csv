1687767,4,B0000631A7,"This is pretty good opera, considering that it was recorded over 10 years ago. Typical sets and singing manner of Russian vocal school of that era (and I grew up there). Of course, it is not comparable to any of the newer productions from Met or La Scala; however, considering that this opera is not a very popular choice for opera houses by some reason (although I truly think that this is one of the best operas by Thaikovsky), it is worth to buy.",1217203200,4,449,4.357142857142857
1687768,5,B0000631A7,"Being a complete fan of all Peter I. Tchaikovsky works I will get this DVD.  I have recently purchased ""The Tchaikovsky Handbook, A Guide to the Man and His Music, Volume 1 by Alexander Poznansky.  In this book it says that Tchaikovsky wrote 11 operas and that there were many, many more that were ""unrealized"" as Poznansky stated.  I will get all the ones that Amazon offers.  After all, the more Tchaikovsky tunes the merrier!  I will never get bored with his music.",1144972800,3,468,4.590361445783133
1687769,3,B0000631A7,"This is such a mediocre routine performance that I don't understand how it made to a DVD. The singers are good, but they sound ordinary and uninspired. The costumes are visibly old. Gegam Grigorian's gorgeous voice is the only highlight of this recording for me. If I were to choose I would have put on DVD a Kirov performance of this opera in Met with Gorchakova and Hvorostovski, although I would replace omnipresent Domingo with the best Hermann of our time Vladimir Galuzin.",1095724800,6,478,4.771084337349397
1687770,4,B0000631A7,"I completely agree with artlover's review, but I would like to add a correction and a complaint.
Contrary to what the reviewer says, ""Pique Dame"" was not Tchaikovsky's last opera, but his next to last. ""Iolanthe"" (1891) was his last.
I would like to warn possible purchasers that the level of recording is rather low, and one has to increase the volume to get a satisfactory reproduction.
As for the cast and musical direction, there is not a word to add to artlover's review.",1056931200,24,476,4.678571428571429
1687771,5,B0000631A7,"I disagree with the editorial review given for this wonderful, well-rounded opera.  What the reviewer calls, ""...stand and sing, and lack of action...,"" I see instead as the effect of the spacious Mariinsky stage -- probably triple the standard U.S. performance stage.  There's plenty of action and activity, it's just sometimes dwarfed, if you will, but never to the point that it detracts from the overall production.  Also, as an opera lover, I'm not looking for an Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick, but instead want exquisite voices, quality acting, complementary orchestral accompaniment, and sets, staging, costumes, and lighting that appeal to my visual senses and support the storyline.  This opera has all these qualities in abundance. The performances are superb:  Herman is a likable, pathetic creature with a captivating, lyrical tenor's voice.  Liza is vibrant and affected, singing with perfect diction and clarity, always perfectly hitting her high notes.  Olga Borodina's melancholy aria in the first act will take you to another world.  The choruses are absolutely beautiful -- even reminding me of stunning Verdi scenes.  The orchestra, under Gergiev's baton, produces the musical intensity and obsession that Tchaikovsky intended, in this, his final opera.  The production itself is excellent with beautiful costumes and sets.  The lighting and filming is also first-rate, far better than the large stage performances on video/DVD from the Met.  This is a rewarding, satisfying performance in every way, and without question the choice video/DVD selection of this opera.",1034208000,75,1591,5.528925619834711

7958544,5,B0000631A7,"Gergiev's recording is marvelous. Grigorian, Guleghina, and Leiferkus bring star power to a classic tragedy based on Alexander Pushkin's story.",1402099200,,143,6.2
7958545,4,B0000631A7,"Although I don't particularly like Russian opera, I decided that I had to try something beside ""Eugene Onegin"" and I was not disappointed.
This is a very typical production of its vintage with decent settings and costumes and very good voices. To me, it was very interesting to ""encounter"" a young Maria Guleghina and Olga Borodina who have gone on to world renown in the meantime
As I have very little that I can compare with this DVD, I can only say that I found it interesting and satisfying.",1370736000,5,495,4.573033707865169
7958546,5,B0000631A7,Loved the music and even the setting.  Very different than a MET DVD but it satisfied me because the voices were exceptional.  Sort of felt like being in Russia.,1363219200,5,161,4.517241379310345
7958547,4,B0000631A7,"It is quite anomalous to compare this with Tchaikovsky's earlier opera based on a Pushkin story: Eugene Onegin. Musically, the latter is far more advanced in every respect. There are many scenes in the former that cry out for the brilliance of the party pieces such as the Polonaise and Waltz that grace Onegin, or the heart-rending strains of Tatiana's Letter Song and Lensky's farewell aria. Arguably, Onegin is far richer dramatic material than the rather contrived and obsessional plot of The Queen, despite being a later work --- a short story rather than a novel in poetry. All of this notwithstanding, it is unpardonable that the great Russian master who had established a uniquely Slavic personal idiom in his composition should have reverted to Haydenesque and Mozartian pastiche in a work that is so dominantly set in the Russian Court, even allowing for its ridiculous convention of employing French for aristocratic conversation. This DVD is my first and only experience of the work, and I must warn those others in my position against expecting a masterpiece.
On the other hand, without knowledge of other performances, I found this one satisfying in almost every respect. It is hard for a stage designer to do badly on the wonderful stage of the Kirov, and the orchestra plays superbly under a young thick-black-haired Valery Gergiev, actually waving a baton with considerable grace instead of, as nowadays, punching his fists and twiddling his fingers by way of persuasion. Others have criticized the static character of the action and acting. To me, this was not a concern, because the whole concept of the production was severely classical, and one might even suggest that the kind of full-blooded acting to be seen in recent Met and Salzburg performances would have jarred with the rest. Brian Large directs the video component with consummate skill. His shots and editing extract every ounce of drama from the events taking place on stage, and the photographic quality is gratifyingly high. So, too, is the sound --- state of the art for 1992, although I agree with the reviewer who found it necessary to turn up the volume more than usual. A useful brochure is included covering cast, synopsis, and an essay on the origin and subsequent history of the opera.
And so to the singers. The only one to disappoint was Olga Borodina who turned in an insipid performance as Pauline, a friend of the heroine Liza, sung persuasively by Maria Gulegina. Sergei Leiferkus is a strongly resonant Tomsky, and Alexander Gergalev does a fine job with the role of the Prince. All the other singers, as well as the chorus, make convincing contributions notable for excellent team-work as well as fine individual singing, but the honours go to Gegam Grigorian who accomplishes the difficult task of vocalising the tortured and conflicting aspirations of Herman without destroying our sympathy for this central character. I expected no less, having been greatly impressed by his work in the equally difficult part of Pierre in Prokofiev's ""War and Peace"". All in all, there is nothing I would want to change in the performances or the technical realisation of this DVD, but there is much that could bear improvement in Tchaikovsky's score.",1326067200,5,3239,5.01113172541744
7958548,5,B0000631A7,"Being The pque dame so tragic an opera, you need  very talented singers to portray the characters and their undoings, and here we get two of the best performers i have seen, Gegam Grigorian and Maria Gulegina. At the beginning of the opera we get a glimpse of what it is to come,when Herman appears,even when he is not singing, and that is the merit of Mr. Grigorian, and the same  by the Liza of Gulegina, another tormented soul. After that, all their singing is anguished, and at the death of Herman,the most pathetic and moving singing and acting i have seen in opera, with the final chorus asking mercy, making us believe that can be hope even for such a selfdestructive man. Together with these two great singers, we have Sergei Leiferkus, who is splendid in his role, and Ludmila Filatova, who sings the old countess,the title name role, who also is excellent ,giving an ethereal atmosphere with her aria of Gretry "" Richard coeur de lion"" and her memories of times past,and the choruses in the last act, joyful at the begining and mourning at the end. I liked very much the staging and dressing, and the conduction of Mr. Gergiev as usual. I wish the Kirov continue producing these Russian jewels,to our everlasting pleasure,and in this case, thoughtful wonder at the human behaviour.",1293321600,4,1291,4.707964601769912
7958549,1,B0000631A7,"Recently I bought some DVDs of Russian operas from Amazon. I have been quite happy with most of them; but there is something wrong with the DVD of Pique Dame. Apparently, act 1, scene 1 is damaged in my copy. Sometimes the music fades away, or there are jumps in the performance. This is not the case with the rest of the DVD, but here there are other technical failures. Sometimes, but not always, the picture and sound are not synchronized which clearly can be seen by the moving of the lips of the singers. Sometimes, but not always, the arias cannot be heard for the orchestra, so one has to make the sound louder just to be blown away when the chorus comes. I had for several reasons been looking forward to this DVD, and it has mostly been a disappointment, for technical reasons, not for the performance itself. For instance. the artist who plays Hermann, is doing a very good performance, and one has apparently chosen him for his resemblance of Pushkin, who wrote the original story, which to my opinion has been a good choice. And the conductor is excellent too.",1220313600,3,1072,4.530927835051546
