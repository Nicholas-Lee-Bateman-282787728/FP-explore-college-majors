4460942,3,B004RPQSVE,"Good news: this recent purchase from Import. CD.com via Amazon is the best presentation I have seen yet.  There are several releases out there, but many are far too dark to enjoy.  The movie I received from Import. CD is the first to be a widescreen presentation and sound is decent.

Bad news: Picture-wise the presentation still has problems with scratches, dirt and fuzziness (out of focus - may have been the way it was shot)in several scenes.  Also, when I opened the package, the case looked very much like it could be a dub.  That's where my question lies: would MGM or FOX (also labeled on the back of the box)deliver such shoddy looking artwork?  I've ordered several DVD-R titles from other studios (Warner Bros. Universal), but none looked anything like the cut-and-paste job that was present in this (official?) MGM release.  The side of the box practically looked typed,the back of the box presented an out of focus shot from the movie and all the artwork had a scanned appearance.  I've purchased other DVDs from Import. CD and never had a problem before.  But the box artwork and some of the flaws mentioned makes me wonder if this is another unofficial release.",1318377600,,1177,4.730392156862745
4460943,3,B004RPQSVE,"Fantastic cast (JOHN SAXON, BASIL RATHBONE, JUDI MEREDITH, and DENNIS HOPPER.) This formula program uses a standard threat that you have seen from the old 50's sci-fi and even pops up now and then today. Check out the 1990 technology such as a reel-to-reel tape recorder of which many of today's viewers have never seen. If you only had $50,000 to make a movie you would bring your home tape recorder also.

In the year 1990 a technically advanced society has crash-landed on Mars just prior to our plans to go there. We sped up the process to see if we could help the survivors. I will not go into details however at one point the female alien (Florence Marly) looks up and find the female astronaut owns three male food containers and she is green with envy. What great threat can this being pose to earth? Worse still she seems to have her eye on a young Dennis Hopper.",1306972800,,872,4.45
4460944,4,B004RPQSVE,Queen of Blood or Planet of Blood as it has called before is a very good classic sci-fi film. The acting is very good and the film has an eerie atmosphere about it. It can be a bit claustrophobic though. The female alien was both creepy and unusual. I had recorded this movie on VHS from TV years ago and was glad it was finally released on DVD. Most 60's sci-fi fans will enjoy this movie and will be glad to have it in their collection.,1306540800,,438,4.104651162790698
4460945,5,B004RPQSVE,"I always enjoyed this movie as a kid. It is like comfort food to watch this guilty pleasure. It is great to see it done better than the knock offs going around.
First it is an edit job where the film is both an AIP picture with a russian sci-fi film spliced together. It is put together well but you do see a differnce in the film, When you are in space the ships asnd planet are all the great effects from the Russian film. When on board it is AIP. Knowing this will help when viewing and wondering where the look comes from.
John Saxon is as always a solid lead and does a good job. Judith Meridith is an attractive female lead who also does quite well with the bland role she is given. She does manage to bring  some personality to the character,  Basil Rathabone the great actor of all those 30's and 40's Sherlock Holmes movies is also here as the project director. Curtis Harrington is probably one of the most underated directors. His workmanlike job here suits it just fine. The sets are colorful and look low budget(but in a good way) and last but not least The late great Forry Ackerman is in a cameo. Babyboomers who read Famouse Monsters of Filmland should watch this film just to see Forry.
Pick it up make some macaroni and cheese and sit down watch and have some great comfort.",1305676800,18,1292,4.31275720164609
4460946,3,B004RPQSVE,"The reason for those big red stars on the American space ships? - Well just maybe they're Russian FX space ships. Yep that they are.

Talented B movie writer/director Curtis Harrington assembled The Queen of Blood using almost all the exterior shots clipped from Russian Sci-Fi films. Then very cleverly interwove them with a brand new plot, newly shot interior clips and English speaking actors - think along the lines of the Raymond Burr Americanization of Godzilla...on steroids!

So how is QOB?  It's a mixed bag.  If you are a 60s Sci-Fi bug or a Harrington fan or a Roger Corman fan for that matter and looking forward to this film then you probably already know what you're getting into. For everyone else QOB is a very colorful, unintentionally campy, Saturday matinee-ish, tongue in cheek, sci-fi, horror yarn with dated but fun sci-fi effects. It's far from the ultimate in entertainment but it's watch-able on a number of levels.

Queen of Blood boasts a pretty good eerie atmosphere that kind of sneaks up on you and for me the atmosphere is what saves the QOB from the obscurity of clunkersville.  I think this due to three things: First, the gaudy FX and colors used throughout the film.  Second, the background sounds - mostly werring noises usually heard aboard or around space ships. And finally the appearance and silent performance of Florence Marly.  Marly plays a thirsty sleeping beauty Alien weirdo who dons a red, skin tight pant suit, an eye catching, beehive quaff, green skin, glowing eyes and a disarming, creepy smile that Peter Lori would envy. My only question is how she got that giant beehive under the snug swimmers cap.

Now the negatives (and please don't let them stop you from seeing this baby at least once)  There really is not much going throughout most of this short but slow moving film.  For two thirds of the film you might as well just relax and enjoy the eye candy - an array of space ships getting ready for take-off, taking off, flying around, landing, and oh yes, people talking about spaceships taking off, flying around and landing.

The plot is pretty familiar: first, bring aboard a green but hot female alien hitchhiker - who, as it turns out, happens to dig a pint or five of plasma before each beauty sleep.  Second, have her run amuck (due to a multide of inexplicably stupid decisions by the crew members and their earth counter parts) until Third, (OK I won't give it away).

If this plot sounds a bit like familiar.  Well it should be - this plot has been redone ad nauseum.  But there is a reason for this - we like this plot and it would be OK but for one thing - this part of the plot does not begin until the film is almost two thirds of the way through.  Up to then its mostly...well...spaceships flying around and peopled talking about space ships flying around. To top it off there really are very few crew members to kill off by the time our sexy Alien works up an appetite and by then its pretty close to the end of the film. The kills are more slow and creepy then scarey.  But that is not necessarily a bad thing.

Now if I had to name the least good thing about the film - is the music.  The music is pretty pedestrian.  For the most part it really belongs in a 1950s western serial and not a 1960s Sci-Fi. I half expected someone to shout ""HI-O Silver"" every time a space ship took off. Remember the really cool soundtracks of Forbidden Planet, The Thing or The Day the Earth Stood Still - well forget about it.  Every time the music kicks in it knocks you right out of your space boots and plants you right back on earth.  A real shame - a better soundtrack would have advanced film up a few notches.

Now for the camp for there is camp-o-plenty: Glaring plot holes, hokey props, clunky dialogue, and ludicrous decisions by the crew and earth folk (that in no way resemble decisions of real life space people. Not that I know any, other then Major Anthony Nelson of course.  The America astro-folks who take on board this obviously ultra intelligent, human-like alien behave as if they just found a stray puppy. They don't bother to communicate with her with sign language or drawings. Our Astro-nut-ical heros don't even bother to keep their buddy under any kind of surveillance for that matter. At one part of the film the entire crew seems to wonder off or go to bed leaving their new found friend sitting alone in their space ship's control room! They don't even bother to put down pee-pee pads for her.

The clich&eacute; ridden dialogue becomes very noticable when delivered by the very wooden space ship commander played by Robert Boon - lets just say Plan Nine...But this kind of acting can be kind of fun in the right frame of mind. That goes for his work-out routine on the high-tech exercise equipment as well.

Most of the cast do OK although some deliver just enough performance so as not to destroy the proceedings.  A very thin Basil Rathbone is one of the culprits - other then when he is playing Sherlock Holmes - Basil is just not a very believable good guy.  Denis Hopper seems out of his element as well - you just want him to do something. (oddly Dennis is playing some kind of a bland, nave, goody good) John Saxon looks and talks the part of a hero and as always he does a pretty decent job. There's not many actors who have the extraordinary ability to take the lamest part and make it believable, Mr. Saxon does. Then there is Judith Marideth, a cute actress under an overt sixties hair style not really suited for astronauting or sleeping on (not without getting flat spots) and she's pretty and pretty good at making her ""in-charge"" style astro-woman Laura James work. We can assume that her winning a key arquement with Mr. Saxon will probably play a strong roll in the human race becoming Alien cocktails someday. ""I'll have white a Russian please"".  Yes, she proves that an astro-woman can be just as bad at making decisions as an astro-man.

Here's a short list of a few props that almost pegged the camp-o-meter: Heavily riveted space helmets that do not seem to be attached to the space suits, flimsy face shields that are not sealed to the helmet (woops no oxygen...well...lets just put down the shield...oxygen again?.. let me just flip up this ol shield thing.) Space suit gloves pull on and off like gardening mittens. In fact the whole space suit get-up looks pretty porous. A very important area of space head-quarters has a nice little white sign that reads Astro Communications Room. The Astro Communications room is pretty sparse to say the least. Then of course the before mentioned sophisticated gym equipment.  OK lets face it Queen of Blood would be pure kiddie stuff accept for the Russian FX and the sexy alien vampire.  You might think that its a bit demented to have a sexy blood sucker theme in a Sci-Fi kiddie matinee - but I suppose its no worse then torturing brats, Oompa-Loompa Men and cutting a real chickens heads off in Willy Wonka. Now that's demented.

Finally Id like to share a couple of my favorite lines of dialogue.  Setup - Two men with food trays are planning to sit down while cluing in the audience as to their occupations. - ""mind sharing your table with a couple of starving astronauts?"" Set up - the commander's initial reaction to landing on Mars. ""Lets go Paul and see what we can find"".

So bottom line - if you think you might enjoy what is an off-kilter, very colorful, hammy but better then average early 60s sci-fi horror with a good eerie atmosphere, almost no action and a heavy dose of camp. Then go ahead stick out your thumb and hop aboard the next ship from mars and enjoy this Queen of Blood. But please - bring enough hemoglobin for everyone.",1304467200,7,7705,4.55394641564084
4460947,5,B004RPQSVE,"MGM has reached into its library of rarities and has released Writer/Director Curtis Harrington's great Sci-Fi guilty pleasure from the mid sixties 'QUEEN OF BLOOD' aka 'PLANET OF BLOOD'-1966 for the modern day digital audience.  Based on a short story called 'The Veiled Woman', Harrington utilized footage from a Russian movie called ""MESHTE NASTRESHU'- 1965 and filmed a vampiric storyline around it creating a low budget classic of menace and dread.  After 35 minutes of build up, our space travelers headed by John Saxon, a young Dennis Hopper and hot babe Judi Meredith encounter a beautifully seductive space alien played by Florence Marley rescued from a derelict spaceship.  Veteran actor Basil Rathbone is earthbound throughout the proceedings and you'll spot a silent Forrest J. Akkerman in some scenes. Very soon our brave crew is eliminated one by one as our alien happens to need human blood for nourishment.  The film has the same claustrophobic look and story of Edward L. Cahn's classic 'IT-THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE'- 1958 as a monster from Mars winds up hitch hiking aboard a ship returning to Earth and sucking them dry.  Writer Dan O'Bannon would take liberties with the concept 13 years later with Director Ridley Scott's 'ALIEN'- 1979. However , Harrington directs with a great understanding of the horror genre utilizing an incredibly horrific atmosphere throughout the films final minutes. He is no slouch for this type of film.  No matter what budget he had , he always had some classic horror set pieces within such films as 'NIGHT TIDE' also starring Hopper, 'GAMES' , and the cult TV hoot' THE CAT CREATURE'. But the true chills are delivered by its eccentric foreign actress, Florence Marley with her feline looks and silent performance which gives the role a Max Shreck-like feel where you really can believe that she is extraterrestrial and a true monster.  The film is co-produced by Stephanie Rothman who 5 years later would make a vampire film of her own, the underrated 'THE VELVET VAMPIRE' with Celeste Yarnall dosing out the blood sucking. The only thorn in the production is the supposed music score by Leonard Morand.  Morand does not seem to do anything but rip off various passages from the scores of Ronald Stein.  Fans will definitely hear parts of 'NOT OF THIS EARTH' and 'ATTACK OF THE 50FT. WOMAN' and gives a new meaning to the word blatant.  All in all, the film delivers the goods in its 78 minute running time better than the over bloated genre films which are passing for SciFi/Horror released today .  MGM releases the film in a beautiful, widescreen transfer and take it from this viewer who was used to seeing it in poor, reddish color, its a revelation.  Recommended for all lovers of vintage Sci/Fi Horror films, you know who you are.",1302134400,62,2794,4.908704883227176
4460948,5,B004RPQSVE,"Other than Forbidden Planet, this is probably one of the prettiest science-fiction epics you'll ever see. Each frame is composed in a painterly way, with unusual colors popping off the screen and a truly exceptional use of darkness in many of the scenes. The dark scenes are like watching Gordon Willis doing a space opera. The strange color details almost put Mario Bava to shame. It's a good thing that this film is so interesting from a purely visual standpoint, because for the first 50 minutes absolutely NOTHING happens in it.  And for the final 28 minutes not much happens in it. Still, I imagine this film had its original audience on the edge of their seats, as there's a lot of protocol material establishing how the spaceship is going up, how it's going to land, how it's going to get back, etc. Since the USA was involved in a space race at the time, and anything remotely outer-spacian was guaranteed to draw an audience, this presents an intelligent and imaginative interpretation of the progress the States would achieve in the far distant future of 1990. Plot-wise, not much, though there are some genuinely frightening scenes with Florence Marly as the Queen of Blood herself. Dennis Hopper doesn't have much to do, but he offers a number of quirky line deliveries that seem like he was taking it upon himself to make such leaden scripted lines interesting. For those who love old-school science fiction, this is definitely worth a purchase; just don't expect too much action. Incidentally, Uncle Forry appears in the early scenes when the gang is first deciding to rendeveous on Mars. He has no lines, but he was still writing about his participation in the film in 1968 issues of Famous Monsters.",1301702400,40,1715,4.813559322033898

4460982,4,B004RPQSVE,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an hones review

Fifty years ago, director Curtis Harrington helped usher in a new era of terror by combining horror with space.  He did not invent the genre, but he indeed helped shape it.  Despite his minimal budgets, Harrington still managed to draw big names into his films.  And although his name is associated with several classic low-budget films, I would wager QUEEN OF BLOOD is probably one of his most notorious.  Crammed full of top-notch special effects taken from a lesser known Russian film, QUEEN OF BLOOD is still a visionary foundation on which future films like ALIEN and LIFEFORCE would be based.

The name of the Russian film from which the special effects shots were taken is MESHTE NASTRESHU.  I would love to give this film a look, as the effects appear truly excellent onscreen.  Yet, my efforts to track down a copy of the film have been unsuccessful.  Still, its evident to see why Harrington chose to use them for his film; they are a beautiful accent to the plot.

QUEEN OF BLOOD looks great from a cinematography aspect, however I wish I could watch a restored HD version of the film.  The landscapes and painted backdrops are lush and vibrant, yet watching a low-resolution DVD on an HD television just makes them dull and grainy.  Still, you cannot deny what Harrington achieved here, and the results could be breathtaking if restored properly.

The acting is actually quite good, with a cast made up of some well known names.  Basil Rathbone is probably one of the most recognized names in the history of Hollywood, while John Saxon and Dennis Hopper have both made their marks as well.  The rest of the cast does a fine job, better than many of the B-grade movies Ive seen from that time period.

QUEEN OF BLOOD is a great film from yesteryear, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I recommend giving it a look, if anything to see some great performances from some of Hollywoods older elite.",1452556800,,1972,4.6531791907514455

Blasting off from a moon base, the astronauts, including Dennis Hopper (NIGHT TIDE), locate the alien spaceship, and enter it, finding only one occupant, and he's dead! A second mission, this time w/ John Saxon (CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE, BLACK CHRISTMAS, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET) aboard, is dispatched in a hurry. Saxon and company find a comatose female alien (Florence Marly) and rescue her. Saxon joins the first mission, and the QUEEN OF BLOOD regains consciousness. Green, beautiful, and mysterious, the title character is both eerie and alluring. Ms. Marly pulls off a predatory air w/ ease. Without a word, she devours those around her w/ her eyes. Not surprisingly, she has a bewitching affect on the males of the crew. Horror occurs when the QOB begins to slake her thirst. This is an excellent example of horror / sci-fi from 1966. A fantastic twist on the vampire legend, w/ a nifty, doomsday finale! Saxon is believable in his heroic role. Co-stars Basil Rathbone, pretty much reprising the same role he played in VOYAGE TO THE PREHISTORIC PLANET, stuck in the lunar command center. Also, watch for Forrest J. Ackerman as Rathbone's assistant. Highly recommended...",1443312000,,1815,5.114478114478114

Warner Brothers, MGM and Universal are all using these cheap cases to sell you their archived classics.

When you open the case you're immediately hit by a strong, sweet, pungent and (more than likely) brain damaging odor.  Then, after you set the movie aside for a week or more, the case begins to warp and expand opening up and releasing that brain-cell killing odor into your home.  Luckily, I had some extra old empty DVD cases lying around so I was able to replace it.

An Earth space expedition heads for Mars when they get a signal from an alien civilization that they want to meet Terrestrial envoys there.  When they get there they bring aboard the sole survivor of the aliens, a female that is beautiful, silent, and creepy.  When the Earth spaceship heads back home with their prize package she starts decimating the male crew when they're asleep.  Florence Marly plays the alien vampire and she is truly memorable.  Just by sitting there and smiling she really creeps you out.  Also the film has some atmospheric scenes taken from a couple of early 1960's Russian sci-fi films, Nebo Zovyot and Mechte Navstrechu.  It would be nice to see these movies released to DVD, even with only subtitles.  Anyway the Queen of Blood DVD-R release is great quality, though it has absolutely no extras.

4461010,5,B004RPQSVE,"I got to admit, I was skeptical to say the least about watching this movie. Thinking it was just another poorly produced cheesy scifi movie. After I saw a movie trailer about it on youtube, it aroused my curiosity Especially when I realized Basil Rathbone was starring in it along with John Saxon. Queen of Blood does have some cheesy special effects, and predictable storyline. It does have actors who at the time were just starting out in the acting business. Like Dennis Hopper, who I thought his first acting role was Easy Rider. Imagine my surprised that he started out in a kind of weird scifi movie. Really can't say too much about the movie itself other than it steals sound effects from Star Trek and the movie from The Fly. All in all I really enjoyed watching this movie, which is not too surprising since I do like scifi movies. Even though some can be a bit weird.

4461013,2,B004RPQSVE,"This is a Sci-Fi B Flick from the early Sixties.

The producers of this film got hold of an obscure Russian Sci-Fi film and built an American-Interntional Sci-Fi film around it.

There's lots of footage from the Russian film in the first 3 quarters. It's colorful and rather garish. I easily recognized Ronald Stein's Music for ATTACK OF THE 50 Ft. WOMAN and, I think, some of the Moog Music from Forbidden Planet. As far as those things go, it's mildly interesting.

The best part of this film is the last reel, which would have made a great episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE or, better yet, THE OUTER LIMITS.

A team is sent to Mars to ""bring 'em back alive"". What they find is a deadly predator. If this sounds like an ALIEN movie, it does remind me of one, right down to the camera angles, but done on a shoestring budget.

Great 30's Star Basil Rathbone is here as the project leader. Judi Meredith is the Leading Lady, looking a fright in too much makeup and hair spray. Did our girlfriends really walk around like that? Dennis Hopper is a crew member and John Saxon is the Leading Man. The best performance though, comes from Florence Marley as the Alien Queen and she doesn't have one line of dialogue.

If you collect vintage Sci-Fi or are curious about this film, here it is, but frankly, i don't see much to recommend this movie.

Sorry, Two Stars.",1370390400,2,1354,4.4574898785425106

The detail is finally brought back to this film.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of cult science fiction, especially ant new Indie film producers.  It is also a great piece for film students to watch.  It opens the third eye as to what creativity can do when your film budget is not as high as you would like.  The use of lighting and sound effects fills in many gaps and by using footage from other film it completed the science fiction vision.  Featuring Basil Rathbone, John Saxon and a young, pensive Dennis Hopper didn't hurt!",1359504000,2,688,4.404761904761905
4461015,3,B004RPQSVE,"In terms of story alone, Queen of Blood is about as aimless and boring as possible. Just short of an hour and a half, the film's essential conflict only takes place in the final thirty minutes, and then in about a perfunctory and simple manner as possible. And there's certainly nothing new about the thematic material, even for the 1960s. What brings this movie up from one to three stars, however, is its visual aspect, beginning with utterly gorgeous paintings by John Cline that serve as background for the opening credits, underlayed with electronic music by Ron Stein under the alias of Leonard Morand, and continue with the color scheme for the spacecraft interiors and the makeup and garb of the alien queen. As noted by other reviewers, the depictions of rockets et al are drawn from Soviet science fiction footage, most notably the movie that was released in this country in a reworked Francis Ford Coppola version (under the aegis of Roger Corman) titled Battle Beyond the Sun. Those model shots are truly fun to behold. It's really a question of whether they're worth the agony of sitting through a truly lousy movie which nonetheless boasts John Saxon, Basil Rathbone, and an exquisitely styled Queen of Blood. Oh, and Forrest Ackerman in a non-speaking role.",1358380800,2,1272,4.893518518518518

4461017,4,B004RPQSVE,"Released in March of 1966 by American International Pictures as the second half of a unique double bill that included BLOOD BATH (see my earlier review of that), QUEEN OF BLOOD aka PLANET OF BLOOD retains its power to amuse and astonish as it manages to create its own unique atmosphere. It remains an excellent example of science fiction as fantasy as opposed to the ultra realism that would come about 2 years later with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Taking its inspiration from 1958's IT, THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE!, QUEEN is part IT, part FLASH GORDON, and part Mario Bava's PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES which AIP released the year before. Like BLOOD BATH which preceeded it, QUEEN is also an excellent example of the Roger Corman school of hybrid cinema.

As he often did in the 1960s, Corman bought the distribution rights to a foreign film (in this case two Soviet era sci-fi flicks) and then turned it over to one of his proteges to see what they could do with it. You could do anything you wanted as long as you didn't exceed the miniscule budget or the tight shooting schedule. Director Curtis Harrington (GAMES, RUBY) seamlessly blends the Russian footage with his American scenes and negates the cheapness of the studio sets with strong performances from John Saxon, a young Dennis Hopper and an aging Basil Rathbone. The shipboard sequences use primary colors to create a visual look that lingers long afterwards. Florence Marly with her green skin, Faberge egg helmet, beehive hair, and especially her glowing eyes makes an unforgettable impression as the titular character.

For years this film was available only on VHS in a poor print with washed out colors and in the wrong screen ratio. The early budget DVD copies weren't much better. But now MGM (who owns the rights to the AIP back catalogue) has issued a Limited Edition DVD-R version which is made-to-order. They have gone back and used the original release print which captures the rich hallucinatory color scheme and the wide screen aspect ratio that made this film so effective when it first played the drive-in circuit. If you are one of the many who first saw it on TV and remember it fondly than this disc will be a revelation. If you get the chance, be sure and see the companion piece BLOOD BATH which makes effective use of its hybrid nature with strong performances and stunning black & white photography.",1342828800,13,2379,4.757869249394673

Added in a super cheap interior sets that has a lot of wood painted with silver paint to look like metal.  Toss in Basil Rathbone that is the head of the space program.  But for some unknown reason is always wearing a lab coat.  Have John Saxon and a very board and high looking Dennis Hopper that has a hard time keeping a straight face saying his bad lines.  Both in weird looking matching jackets.  The good spot in the movie is Florence Marly as the alien queen.  She does a great job without having a word of dialog.
