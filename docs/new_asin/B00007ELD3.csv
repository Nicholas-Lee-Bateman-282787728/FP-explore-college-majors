7975370,4,B00007ELD3,"This DVD is a great one in a series featuring the Jay Jay the Jet Plane characters.  The stories are educational and have great moral themes.  For example, one story features a Switch-Around Day - where two characters trade places to see what life is like in the others shoes...errr...wings!  The DVD is setup with an option to play the entire feature or select individual stories which I like since my toddler is particular to certain characters.  A must have for Jay Jay fans.",1105574400,8,478,4.654761904761905
