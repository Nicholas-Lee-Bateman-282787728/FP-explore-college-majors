5613298,2,B00BF4S1X8,"I have a toddler boy who loves Elmo!!!!  This video doesn't have much signing which is what he loves so much about Elmo.  Disappointing as the title say ""musical"".  Maybe when he is older he will enjoy!  I would but again however not for 15 months.  Maybe 2 yrs.",1393459200,,262,4.26530612244898
5613299,5,B00BF4S1X8,"Sure, I wish there were more than five episodes on this disc. However, that aside, what IS on the DVD is stellar. Many children's programs will delight youngsters but cause adults' brains to melt out of their heads from boredom. Elmo the Musical, however, is a fantastic example of a children's product that is unnecessarily well-made. Amusing and creative plot points, funny lines and great performances. And the songs are great - written, performed and recorded very well. There was a high level of talent and skill that went into nearly every element of this production. The songs stick in your head but you won't mind - they're that amusing.",1378771200,,645,4.872727272727273
5613300,5,B00BF4S1X8,"This DVD is different from the standard Elmo's World DVDs - there are no segments with real kids or Mr. Noodle or Dorthy, etc.  This DVD has 5 short skits in which Elmo imagines different roles for himself (president, athlete, sea captain, circus performer, and a prince).  The story is delivered via standard Sesame Street puppetry with lots of singing.  Some of the segments are a little annoying for parents, but my 2 year old ADORES this DVD and picks it over other Elmo's World videos.  My toddler loves that Elmo is always on the screen, and she loves the music.  There is one segment that I find distasteful (there is a hill of beans in the prince segment that makes load burping sounds) but otherwise it is pretty cute.  Some of the lines make me laugh out loud.  I would rate it 4 stars, but since my todder loves it so much, I rate it 5 stars.",1375315200,4,853,4.360759493670886
5613301,4,B00BF4S1X8,"We love this video! I don't let my toddler watch a ton of TV, but we turn on PBS every morning to catch the ""Elmo the Musical"" sketch because they're so darn cute and catchy. The production quality of the Elmo skits has gone way up since they changed Elmo's world (which used a lot of old non-HD footage) to Elmo the Musical. All of the skits have a core lesson that's either knowledge or value based which I like (numbers & shapes versus helping a friend, winning isn't the most important goal). Introducing music to babies & toddlers is also really beneficial, and I love to see my son dancing along with the tunes. I do agree that the packaging made me think there would be more skits per DVD, so it lost a star from me for that -- but I don't think that's a good reason to bomb it. It's 5 skits (Athlete, Sea Captain, Prince, Circus and President) for ten bucks and my son loves them. He brings me the case all the time and says ""Melmo""! We will definitely be looking for the next DVD installment of Elmo the Musical, hoping some of our favorites make the next cut (Space Pizza Delivery & Queen of Machu Picchu).",1370822400,4,1116,4.268867924528302
5613302,1,B00BF4S1X8,"Doesnt have many of the ""elmo the musical"" videos as seen on youtube.  very disappointed their are only 5 episodes.  don't wastes your money",1369785600,3,140,4.791666666666667
5613303,2,B00BF4S1X8,Bought this thinking they would have all the episodes i have seen on youtube. but to my dislike only 5. are they even going to release another dvd with the rest of episodes. what a waste of dvd for only 5 short episodes.,1368921600,3,220,4.1395348837209305
5613304,1,B00BF4S1X8,"We preordered this thinking we were going to get a DVD full of episodes plus 5 new ones. The front of this DVD says ""5 new to DVD episodes"", which typically indicates there are 5 NEW episodes. I can't believe they wasted an entire DVD to only put 5 episodes total on this, especially when you can just record Sesame Street for free and have them on your DVR.  This is a complete waste of your money - if I could return it I would.",1368316800,3,430,4.0588235294117645
5613305,2,B00BF4S1X8,"My daughter loves Elmo the Musical, and we have several of them on the DVR. I thought this might be a good way to stop fast-forwarding through Sesame Street all the time but failed to realize that there are only 5 episodes on the DVD, all of which we already had on the DVR. Somehow when I saw ""5 new to DVD episodes,"" my overly optimistic mind thought it would be all of the televised Elmo the Musicals plus an additional five. The episodes are great, and my 2.5-year-old daughter adores them, but if I'd been smart enough to realize there were only five, I wouldn't have bothered with this DVD.",1368144000,3,596,4.378378378378378
5613306,3,B00BF4S1X8,"My 3 boys( under 3) love Elmo and Grover. Elmo's world is a life saver and Grover gives them those Belly laughs, Elmo the musical is different but somehow fails to entertain and keep their attention. I believe their is too much going on, but if you love Elmo this is a good try. The songs are catchy but no Mr Noodle, no Dorothy , which every kid loves.",1367884800,3,353,4.130434782608695
