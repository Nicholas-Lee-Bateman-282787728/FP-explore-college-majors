6192503,5,B00HNTOVWE,"This film is exactly what it claims to be, a fun , campy tribute to the drive-in movie of old",1398556800,3,93,3.7
6192504,3,B00HNTOVWE,"I thought this was a sincere effort to do an updated remake of the Giant Gila Monster. Acting was decent which is typical for these films (don't expect Joan Crawford or Cary Grant)  but this film was played straight without the usual Wynorski touches. Hardly any gore and no nudity with his bodacious women. The monster is CGI and isn't bad overall. It's a really good looking Gila monster design.
The setting takes place in the 50s (the women in the movie didn't look very 50s-esque however and one of them had a tattoo which wasn't commonplace in that era) just like the original film and there are many cool nod's to that film as well. The hot rods were beautiful to see in 2014 and the whole 1950s look was perfect, even the music in the background was spot on. Unlike many remakes this wasn't a complete revisionist effort like the Thing, the Fly but actually stuck with how the original was to an extent. We don't get a real lizard this time, but I think we can accept that :)
Another movie if it peaks your interest enough - check it out...It's not that bad at all. Just be prepared for a movie that isn't his usual fare...and there is a Don Sullivan Cameo as well for us Gila Monster fans !

6192577,4,B00HNTOVWE,"Why remake ""The Giant Gila Monster,"" one of the cheesiest teen drive-in flicks of the late 50's? Well, it has name recognition. Even with the name alteration, it's still marketable. The original story is in the public domain, so there're no royalties to pay. Maybe just for fun? My guess it all of the above. Make a few bucks and have fun. Why not?

The original 1959 film has little going for it other than it's nostalgic cheese factor and for it's collection of great hot rods. So what's the harm in a remake? Absolutely none! And this update, still set in the 50's, is better by far, which is rare and a minor miracle, if you ask me.

As bad as the acting is, which might be deliberate, the characters are more complex and interesting. The story is also a little better, the direction is much better and the cinematography is totally competent. Totally. And, even though the CGI title character is so obviously animated, that's completely predictable, so no real harm done. Besides, with a film like this, ya laugh, let it go or get angry. Viewer's choice. Convincing giant monsters in low budget films are hard to come by, anyway. All that's decent praise for a low budget, straight to TV movie.

The only thing that the original has over this one is that wonderfully ridiculous opening narration, which lacks any facts or logic. It's priceless. The toxic spill accounting for the giant lizard's existence in the remake is too cliche to be any fun. No explanation would have been better, I think.

The hot rods are still very cool and a couple of the chicks are an upgrade from the original. And, the soundtrack of rock n' roll oldies and contemporary rockabilly is very good, maybe even the least flawed aspect of the film.

Even though it is forgettable low budget garbage, it's still pretty fun. I'll probably give it another look, one of these days.",1471996800,,1857,4.615151515151515

I have to admit that I did get a little bored a couple of times when the action started to drag just a little, and some of the scenes were a little too silly even when your not trying to be serious. But I did enjoy the movie and all of the big fake smiles, overacting, and dead spots from script fails. If you're looking for a serious movie then you need to just keep right on looking, but if you want a little fun and nostalgia then grab some popcorn, pour you some soda, and kick back for a couple of laughs with a good natured friend who will not hold the loss of an hour and a half against you.",1447718400,,872,3.877094972067039

6192638,2,B00HNTOVWE,"A campy effort to re-imagine monster-movie fun from the 1950's, GILA! suffers from too many weaknesses to be a truly entertaining film.  The 50's setting isn't very well-realized, the plot lacks resolution, acting is wildly uneven, the dialogue is atrocious even if you factor in the campy nature of things, and the overall tone of the film suggests that the filmmakers are more interested in satirizing classic monster movies than paying tribute to them.  Ironically, considering the film's obvious budgetary weaknesses, the eponymous giant lizard is probably the film's highlight and is a surprisingly effective creature--even if the monster attack scenes themselves are poorly done.  GILA! might have been a fun little b-movie if the filmmakers had some respect for the kind of movie they were making, but instead it's a poor substitute for the real thing.",1445558400,,859,5.255474452554744

The original ""Giant Gila Monster"" was actually a better movie.
BTW, did anyone notice the little yellow, '32, 5-window, deuce coupe was the same hotrod Paul LeMat drove in ""American Graffiti""?  Right down to the same license plate, ""THX 138"".

6192705,2,B00HNTOVWE,"The original ""Giant Gila Monster"" was a low budget, teenage drive in feature that was no worse than most of them, (except for ""the mushroom song""), and better than a few. The frustrating thing about this remake is that with a little effort, it could have been fun instead of boring. Making a period piece on a low budget has to be difficult and I can easily forgive some of the issues, such as all the cars being either beautiful expensive restorations or old junkers. Sixty year old cars in average shape can't be easy to find.
The real problem is what appears to be a total lack of interest. Although the actors don't appear bad, they appear bored. It's like the entire cast is on lithium. Nothing excites these people, not even a sixty foot lizard. This lack of interest appears to be on both sides of the camera. Nothing is visually interesting. The cave that is the beast's lair looks like it should have a conssession session stand and public restrooms. A little creative lighting and camera angle, plus the right music would have gone a long way create a creepy atmosphere. When the explorers discover crickets the size of cats, their reaction isn't much more animated than if they'd found an old tire.  The ""desolate wilderness"" area haunted by the creature would have been a bit more believable if they had positioned the camera to miss the busy highway a hundred yards away. The plot is lost, several subplots exist that are never satisfactorily resolved.
Then there's the Lizard. The original used a real gila monster bashing around through some mediocre miniature sets. Not cutting edge, but but with proper camera angles, lighting, music and editing it did the job acceptably well. The CGI lizard in the remake is about as believable and threatening as an escaped Macy's parade balloon. It makes the original look cutting edge after all.

Nine shots from a six-shot revolver, firing a .30 cal machine gun held under an arm with no finger on the trigger, an AR15 in ca1958(?), having four flasks of nitroglycerine just lying about in the garage, blowing up the monster and NOT CHECKING TO SEE IF ITS DEAD!!  At a dance the band is not playing what is in the sound track, the deputie's holster moves from left to right hip in the same scene and what's with the sheriff's shirt?

The basic premise of GILA is the same as the original, THE GIANT GILA MONSTER- 25yo ""teens"" engaged in hi-jinx, come up against the voracious lizard. In this update, there's an actual reason for the creature's titanic size. This being barrels of toxic waste, stored in a cave. Director, Jim Wynorski (CHOPPING MALL, NOT OF THIS EARTH, DINOSAUR ISLAND) shows great restraint, as he is well-known for gratuitous nudity and bloody violence (No boobulars are unveiled, and the CGI blood just isn't all that revolting). As for the CGI GILA, it's serviceable enough, though it has a bit of a clunky walk. The cheeeze-factor is blessedly, excessively high! What sets this movie apart from other ludicrous, CGI monster epics  is its sense of humor. It also wears its low budget proudly, boasting a sheriff w/ the cheapest, most oddly-fitting hat available!

The hands of time have wound back to 1959 when some evil doer stock piles 55 gal. drums of toxic chemicals into an abandon mine to save money and to hide his toxic waste from the publics eyes. His barrels leak and leach the toxic waste in the mine and possibly the water table. This waste produces giant insects and a giant Gila Monster (wonder how that thing wound up in the upper midwest?) that wreaks havoc on the local townsfolk and their livestock.
Yes it was a simpler time when most boy's and girls knew how to behave and treated their elders with respect except for a few of them HOT RODDER TYPES. Many of the youngsters don't even use swear words.
The story also has racy girls who dress provocatively in public and ""don't act lady like at all"" and we have the good clean boy who's only vice is hot rods and drag racing pitted against the juvenile delinquent and his hussy of a girlfriend injecting their poisonous lifestyle onto the community.
Its up to the All American Teen and the local Sheriff to come to the townsfolk's rescue and rid them of this menace to society with the help of AAT's girlfriend and a few others. The shunned town juvenile delinquent bad boy even pitches in to help save the locals from certain death!!!
The production values are very good with a couple of exceptions in acting abilities and CGI (may be intensional), but overall the cinematography, direction, acting, story, hot rods and copious amounts of cheese all add up to a 500 acres of cheese covered yummy corn.
If the kids would step through the time machine with their folks and watch this movie they may see what kind of rabble raisers their parents or grandparents were and get a good laugh.
This one is for all ages if they can handle the time period because there is only some suggestive hints here and there about sex and with very little violence. I don't remember hearing any cursing at all, but if there was it was the d or h words. There is alcohol use in the movie, but no drug use.

Sure, there were a lot of goofs, but who cares - there's a 60 foot lizard about to eat the town of Franklin, Indiana!

8633901,5,B00HNTOVWE,"I absolutely loved this picture! It reminded me so much of the 1950's horror flicks I so loved when I was a kid. Except, they were black & white, and somewhat scary. This was in Technicolor and so damn funny, it is unbelievable. When you are ready to suspend disbelief, and settle down for some total nostalgia, this is your flick. It has everything: Pretty girls - one in particular - beautiful old cars from the 1950's, rock & Roll from the days before Elvis, villains, heroes, predictable dialog, a hokey plot, and, of course, the obligatory big monster that eats people. I was totally entertained the whole time, laughing at scenes so hokey that there was no other way to enjoy them. There was even the tug at the heartstrings plot twist of the cute baby sister crippled by polio.

There were also lots of glitches in the timeline. In one scene there is a 1920's era phone, the old wooden box on the wall with only an earpiect for a receiver, and a microphone attached to the box on the wall. Then, in another scene there is an M-16 on the wall of a supposed gun collector with a WW II era private arsenal. I also caught a scene with a restored, and repainted 1955 Chevy, but the bubbles in the 60 year old window glass were obvious where it was delaminating with age.

Overall, I just loved this movie.

Spoiler alert: If you were looking for a serious 1950's style horror flick, with serious acting dialog, plot, realistic monster, and a genuine effort to be scary and realistic as sci-fi can get - this ain't that movie. Not what I was looking/hoping for, but very delightful diversion.",1491264000,,1593,4.4862068965517246
8633902,4,B00HNTOVWE,"This review is for the standard DVD edition of 'Gila' by Polyscope Media Group released in April, 2014.

This movie is a remake or reimagining of the 'The Giant Gila Monster' released in 1959. Like the original, this movie was produced in Texas. The movie had a budget of just under a million dollars. I felt that it was quite good for the budget. Thus the 4 star rating.

I am a big fan of 1950's science fiction so I was interested in seeing if this was going to be a movie just using the name or a tribute movie or something else. It turns out that is really more of a reimagining of the original.
The setting is the same as in the original and in the same time period. Just like in the original, the main protaganist, Chase Winstead, has a hot rod and has a crippled sister. He is also friendly with the town sheriff. The climax of the movie is almost exactly the same as in the original. Not everything is the same though. For instance, there is no disc jockey and dance party.

The movie is taken seriously and there is very little comedy in it. To me that's what the difference is between this movie and most tribute movies. Most tribute movies usually poke fun at the original's. This one does not. They seemed to make an effort to make 'Gila' a serious movie. That is a positive as far as I'm concerned.

The monster itself is CGI whereas a real lizard was used in the original. The CGI monster is a bit cartoonish looking and could have been better but once again, the budget probably didn't allow for it. On the positive side, they did still manage to incorporate the actors into the scenes with 'Gila' and it looks as if some effort was put into that and it looks pretty good.

The acting is not bad and generally above average for a movie of this type. While the outfits and and hair styles aren't all late 50's style, they are still not bad and at least some effort on some of the actors was given to make them look 1950ish.
The original lead, Chase Winstead was played by Don Sullivan. Don Sullivan was also the star of another 1950's science fiction movie called 'The Monster of Piedras Blancas.' He was still alive at the time this movie was filmed and was a given a small part in it. I love when the old time actors are given parts in remakes of old science fiction movies. I think it would be better yet if they were given a bigger role.

Recommended for fans of the original 'The Giant Gila Monster.' Also recommended for fans of recently released low budget monster movies.
To reiterate, I give the movie 4 stars  for the effort.",1490572800,,2550,4.311064718162839
