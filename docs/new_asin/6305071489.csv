7882439,3,6305071489,"Filmed in '58, 'The Haunted Strangler' is a somewhat entertaining English horror/murder mystery from '58 starring the legendary Boris Karloff.

Plot: Set in London, England circa 1860, accomplished writer James Rankin (Boris Karloff) develops an obsessive interest in a twenty year old series of can-can girl killings. His investigation into the matter eventually unveils a harsh (and I might say totally expected) reality bringing dire and deadly circumstances when the truth is finally uncovered.

While Boris Karloff delivers a fine performance, the real interest in this now OOP DVD is the presence of the very sexy Vera Day in the role of the ill-fated Pearl, the first victim in a new series of killings. Vera was a very popular model in England in the mid-to-late fifties. Of the few films she appeared in, 'The Haunted Strangler' is the most successful at showing this incredible beauty to the appreciative audience.",1146528000,5,924,5.194630872483222
7882440,3,6305071489,"This movie -also known as Grip of the Strangler-marked the great Boris's return to the UK to make a movie after a 20 year gap and it is a somewhat neglected and capable little movie .
He plays a Victorian writer obsessed with a 20 year old murder case ,that of ""The Haymarket Strangler"" .A man was convicted of murdering a number of women in the Haymarket area of London and summarily executed for the crimes .The writer is unpersuaded of the deceased's guilt and re-opens the case ,claiming the real killer is still at large
He takes on the personality of the strangler and begins killing .The mystery reaches its climax in a bleak and wintery graveyard where the truth is revealed .
The star did this kind of Jekyll and Hyde role more than once in his career -as per The Body Snatcher and also The Black Room .He was able to suggest a divided personality without recourse to elaborate make-up merely by a subtle facial reconfiguration -the sign of an assured professional..He gives a subtle and measured performance aided by a literate script from Jan Read and vivid monochrome photography by Lionel Barnes

This is neat little movie and merits viewing as an example of the horror movie which shows us that the monster can be internal rather than some ravening werewolf or vampire",1121644800,2,1282,4.647577092511013
7882441,5,6305071489,This is one of the best horror movies that Boris Karloff made and he really shows his acting talent.,1056585600,,100,4.315789473684211
7882442,5,6305071489,"For can-can enthusiasts, this film contains two EXCEPTIONAL can-can numbers in full costume (including traditional suspender stockings and frilled underwear)....",1045612800,3,161,7.1
7882443,4,6305071489,"I don't see why this movie gets such poor reviews. Boris does a great facial contortion with paralisis when possesed by a dead murderer. Great victorian costumes help set the stage for a pretty good mystery. I guess most of todays audience expect special effects to replace acting. No twisting heads or spewed pea soup here. While its not as good as Frankenstein, The Mummy or the afore mentioned Corridors of Blood, its still a pretty good Karloff movie.",1013644800,5,455,4.772151898734177
7882444,2,6305071489,"This is a surprisingly lurid little shocker (for 1959), with a clever plot and some nice ideas. It just takes a smidgen too long to get where it's going, although the ending is fine.
Due to the title and cover art, it is not revealing too much to say that Karloff becomes a killer, one with a rather scrunched-up face. These contortions seem appropriately gruesome at first, yet ultimately distract from the film. For one thing, for the movie to have us believe that these meager facial alterations would make him totally unrecognizable to those around him is asking a bit much.
Still, some strongly dark atmosphere and intriguing storytelling are present. Probably worth a half-star more, but the bad slightly outweighs the good.",989020800,2,730,4.895161290322581
7882445,2,6305071489,"Image Entertainment's release of THE HAUNTED STRANGLER is similar to many of their other DVD releases of old horror films: it's very cool that they're releasing the movie, but special features are kept to a bare  minimum.  With HAUNTED STRANGLER, the only added bonuses are a scene access  menu and a trailer.
I am a big Boris Karloff fan, and I really enjoy  old black and white horror movies, but I'm at a loss to explain why this  movie has frequently received positive reviews.  The story is quite obvious  and plods at a snail's pace.  Karloff is good as the kindly old doctor, but  his Jekyll & Hyde transformations are surprisingly unconvincing and  juvenile.  Several dance sequences in an annoying burlesque show hinder the  movie further.
The movie is still watchable, however, and for any  Karloff collector, a must.  Consider carefully, though, before you buy the  DVD at this price.  Even with the trailer, the disc only runs 80 minutes.  Image also released another, vastly superior Karloff film of the same  period that I'd recommend over THE HAUNTED STRANGLER.  It's called  CORRIDORS OF BLOOD and also stars Christopher Lee.",958348800,6,1141,4.936507936507937
7882446,5,6305071489,"This is absolutely the best picture Karloff ever did. Owing a lot to not only his acting talents, but a suburb script. Karloff plays an author in victorian Edinburgh, Scotland....who believes a man hanged 20 years before  was innocent of the Hayside Stranglings. His search leads him to the doctor  who had performed the autopsies on the strangling case, who was later  committed to an insane asylm, and who had from there disappeared. Finally  the search leads him inevitably to none other than himself!  Amazingly  interesting plot. Good suspense and all the rest.",955238400,3,566,5.032258064516129
