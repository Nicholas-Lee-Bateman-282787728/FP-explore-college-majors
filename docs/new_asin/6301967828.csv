SYNOPSIS--
In a story set in 1937, Ling Tan farms his ancestors' land in southern China with reasonable success. Although not a wealthy man, no one in his extended family is hungry. Everything changes for the worse when Japanese planes descend from the north, the prelude to full occupation of a nearby small village.

Ling's three sons react differently to the evil threatening their lives and safety. The youngest, Lao San (Hatfield) becomes a Resistance leader who will relish killing the enemy. Middle son Lao Er (Bey) and his pregnant wife Jade (Hepburn) evacuate with a group of city folk that carry factory machinery to safety. Oldest son Lao Ta (Bice) chooses to stay, a decision with tragic consequences, for Orchid (Rafferty), his wife is sexually assaulted and murdered by the enemy and their two children die of starvation.

Soon after commander of occupying troops Captain Sato (Lewis) gives orders that all harvested crops must be turned over to him, Lao Er and Jade return with an infant son. Jade announces that Ling's house has been chosen as a base for the Resistance, Thus begins a determined struggle against overwhelming enemy forces.

and his Communists and ignore the Nationalists of Chiang Kai-shek.
The strange thing is that as villainous as the Japanese are made out to be in this movie, the truth was actually worse in the Japanese troops in their rape and kill spree while taking China.
There is a fortune cookie Chinese  used in this movie speaking wisdom proverbs.
Sort of like a Charlie Chan movie, the Chinese here bear very little real resemblance to real ones.
That is why it is ""propaganda"" like the posters the cousin makes for the Japanese. The Japanese were true monsters in this war,
but movies like this did very little to stop the Korean war that followed from happening. For the real Chinese all the colonial oppressors were alike:
Japan, Britain, France and the USA.",1241222400,,801,4.680851063829787
391064,5,6301967828,"June Allyson was pencilled in tentatively as the studio's choice for Jade, the young and rebellious daughter-in-law of a provincial Chinese family, until Joseph Pasternak was made aware of Katharine Hepburn's sudden interest in the property.  As a newcomer to the studio, Allyson was foisted off into a lesser property, Two Girls and a Sailor, to allow Ms. Hepburn the chance to stretch her muscles once again.  Pasternak would reward Allyson for her acquiescence by gradually building her and Van Johnson into a screen love team that eventually eclipsed (in terms of box office popularity) the older pairing of Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.  Looking back on DRAGON SEED today, it is hard to imagine it with June Allyson's husky jocularity, but that is because we are used to Hepburn's New England angularity which makes her Asian makeup almost transparent.  Most of the actors look (initially) bizarre, but we get used to them pretty quick.  By the time the film is about thirty minutes on, we have forgotten the repellent and offensive makeup work, and we are concentrating on the story, and on the wonderful way Jack Conway had with actors.  And oh, what a band of actors he has assembled here.  Aline MacMahon did little memorable screen work, though she popped up in everything from GOLD DIGGERS of 1933 to DIAMOND HEAD, but was she ever better than here, playing essentially the O-LAN role from THE GOOD EARTH?  Hurd Hatfield is splendid, evil with a human face, evil nearly decipherable.  Agnes Moorehead is a good match for him, slimy and repellent, utterly self-obsessed and a liar.  Conway stages the big scenes with the bad characters with relish, almost as though he enjoyed them more than the milk and water meekness of Turhan Bey, etc.

Pauline Kael used to recommend this film, freaky as it is, for one superbly directed setpiece that, she said, equalled the best of Hitchcock for downright sweating suspense.  All those who have seen this film know which scene it is--and for those of you who are DRAGON SEED virgins, you're in for a treat.",1109548800,5,2053,4.867816091954023
391065,5,6301967828,"First let me say I am not a Katharine Hepburn fan.  This is only one of two movies where I can take her.  (The other is Stage Door).  Perhaps its because she's playing a character part....a chinese one at that, though not a visually convincing one....

The story and production values of this fine film are top notch and the story is captivating and arresting.  The finest scene in this great motion picture (from MGM), is Hepburn pouring poison into the duck soup towards the end.

The acting is superb, Hepburn is at her best (without mannerisms and twittering), the cinematography is excellent, the music score is haunting and this is one of the most underrated gems of the classic films.  I am very hard to please so trust on this one......It is great!",1091577600,11,756,4.597014925373134
391066,4,6301967828,"Even though Katherine Hepburn makes a lousy visual Chinawoman, she is still a great woman and it comes out in this film. Very soon into the viewing you fully believe in her. The plot is full of horrors; the rape of Nanking jabs me a lot harder in this 1944 movie than blood-spattered killings do in, say, Blade. When this film came out it rated as propaganda, but recent it has come out that a lot of this kind of stuff did happen and so this is a valid historic document. I have not read the Pearl Buck novel, but I've read other novels of hers and ""Dragon Seed"" rings true.",1007856000,9,575,4.1891891891891895

7818362,4,6301967828,"Let us get the obvious criticisms out of the way first: DRAGON SEED could be held up as a classic example of mimicry and/or orientalism, with the supposedly Chinese characters played by a variety of actors from different backgrounds. Led by Walter Huston as the familial patriarch, the cast also includes the Russian-born and Stanislavski- trained Akim Tamiroff; Turhan Bey, the Viennese born son of a Turkish father and Czechoslovakian mother; New England patrician Katharine Hepburn; the English-born Henry Travers, and the Irish American J. Carrol Naish as a Japanese kitchen overseer.

On the other hand the film must be approached in context as a propagandist flag-waver designed to highlight the Japanese menace while emphasizing the importance of the global fight for freedom. In these terms Jack Conway and Harold S. Bucquet's epic works extremely well: the Japanese are portrayed as sadistic brutes who will stoop at nothing to achieve their aims - shooting dogs, raping and killing innocent women while relishing the thought of getting Hepburn's Jade Tan into bed. With the aid of Chinese traitor Wu Lien (Tamiroff), they set themselves up in a grand mansion and enjoy elaborate meals prepared by slave cooks, while capturing locals as slave labor.

Pitted against them are the local Chinese, part of a farming community dedicated to centuries-old rituals. Nothing, it seems, can disturb the peace of their lives. When the Japanese invasion occurs, they are pitifully under-prepared to cope: Ling Tan's (Huston's) eldest son Lao Er Tan (Bey) and wife Jade (Hepburn) leave to help build a city in the hills dedicated to making weapons; while another son Lao San Tan (Hurd Hatfield) goes off to join the Chinese army. Ling Tan and his wife (Aline MacMahon) are left behind to forage for themselves, often living on scraps.

While the film emphasizes the importance of rituals as the foundation of a stable society, it also looks forward to the future. Jade wants to teach her newly-born son to read, for it is only through reading that enlightenment can occur. Lao objects at first - he favors more traditional pastimes such as love-making - but as the action unfolds he understands his wife's concern. DRAGON SEED also preaches a doctrine of sexual equality: Jade spends most of the action working alongside her husband in manual labor dressed in overalls rather than the traditional attire of a rural peasant.

In the end even Ling Tan comes to realize the importance of fighting for his country's future, despite his love of peace. The film ends with a climactic sequence reminiscent of MGM's GONE WITH THE WIND, as the Chinese community decamps from its long-established village to make a new home in the hills.

Based on a best-selling novel by Pearl S. Buck, Marguerite Roberts's screenplay contains a few clunky lines, where the propagandist elements assume more significance than plot coherence; but the film offers the role of a lifetime to Turhan Bey, hitherto associated mostly with B-pictures and horror films for Universal. He takes the opportunity with both hands, proving as competent as Hepburn in delivering lines with lan, as well as convincing us of the character's sincerity of purpose.

DRAGON SEED is certainly long - perhaps too long at 144 minutes, but it certainly fulfills its purpose, especially for those forced to fight the Japanese at first-hand during the mid-Forties.",1470009600,2,3407,5.096774193548387
7818363,3,6301967828,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Listening to the unique dialog, methods of address, and expressions of tenderness and love made me wonder if something was lost in translation. I imagined a Chinese translation of English 'Oh Honey!' might be 'I bow to my glorious powerful master'??? Seems when life is just a bare existence and immensely challenging women are treated with great respect to carry the load as well. Who knows but reading books, especially the Bible, was an executionable offense back in the day. I certainly remember my husband complaining he wished I never went to college so he would maintain his superiority. Ha! Like that routine would have lasted very long.

So now we are worried about the potential invasion of China here while our debt is so precipitous and fear incites such a divisive destabilization of our country. You wonder how people survived such cruel inhumane treatment but this is no different than our treatment of many peoples we have occupied and conquered. I would appreciate those foreign films that address the reality of the Western Devil. Let's face it, men everywhere throughout the ages are mostly responsible for this mess and if women were to take over we could likely take advantage of the situation as well. Perhaps that is why there is such a concerted effort to maintain inequality because payback is going to be a b itch!

I was able to move beyond seeing Clarence the Angel in his Fu Man Chu glasses and whiskers as well as Kate Hepburn with her Yankee accent. It is not difficult to take away sympathy for all oppressed people and be thankful for the many friends, family, security and those ever vital material possessions.

High recommend for the scene of a great Chinese sm&ouml;rgsbord of Duck Soup and the many wild and crazy ingredients that make this film memorable.",1452902400,,1836,4.837579617834395
