7343229,1,B0126ZKKII,"Nothing against the actual film (one of my favorite Bond films actually), this is a complaint with the actual release of the collection itself.

It's a complete shame they did not include digital copies for this and the Timothy Dalton collection. I thought these collections were perfect since fans of certain Bonds can select the ones they really like without purchasing the entire collection. But in this day and age, I am working on slowly converting my physical movie collection to the cloud so that when I'm not home I can have access to my movies wherever I go. It makes no sense that they would not include digital versions of these particular ones especially since UV codes are provided for all the movies if you buy the Complete Bond boxset.",1452297600,8,750,4.7251908396946565

7343231,5,B0126ZKKII,"ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE was the first film to address James Bond, the man. It seemed to have been made for Connery. This is the one we had been waiting for. This film brought the series to a culmination of emotional fervor. ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE may indeed be the quintessential James Bond film. My initial reaction to seeing this extraordinary film on its first release was summed up in one indelible question that I kept repeating over and over again to myself. If Sean Connery decided not to appear in a Bond film, why did it have to be this one? I thought it was an excellent film, but Connery wasn't in it. Yet, I also could not get the image of George Lazenby out of my head. He looked the part and there was something very unique about his facial features. Many critics said his performance was bland. Even if they were right Lazenby still possessed the physique and physical attributes that really fit the part and again his unique looks just added to the wordily and masculine aura he exuded. I went to see the film three more times. I really liked it. I missed Connery, but I still couldn't get the screen image of Lazenby out of my head. I did some real self-analysis of this film over the next two years.

I started to read the Fleming books. To my amazement they were very dry yet very interesting and appealing at the same time. Fleming single-handedly drew the reader into the world of James Bond whereas the filmmakers achieved the same result in a collective effort of talents. When I read ""Dr. No"" and ""Thunderball"" I visualized Sean Connery or someone vaguely familiar to him yet not with his sardonic humor. When I read ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" I could visualize no one other than George Lazenby. As it turned out ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is the one film closest to any Fleming novel of the same name. I began to see the merits of casting Lazenby for his visual presence and resolute performance of Fleming's dedicated civil servant.

The filmmakers had gone out of their way to make this the epic Bond film. The introduction of Lazenby as Bond was a well thought out and well crafted piece of pure cinema. There is no dialogue and only the strains of the James Bond Theme in another innovative interpretation by John Barry are heard. Less dialogue is better. Let the images tell the story. In the case of George Lazenby that's what worked best for him. Early on in the film he is having a bad night at the tables and you can see the disgust on his face as he deals out another loosing hand. He breaks into Gumbolt's office and penetrates his safe with assuredness and conviction while under the clock. This well directed scene is nerve racking and suspenseful again played without dialogue. The editing, music and Lazenby's presence make this another tour de force of pure cinema.

It wasn't until the release of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER that I realized that ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE was the best Bond film for me. The combined efforts of all the filmmakers and Lazenby's performance of a James Bond with conviction, assuredness and determination made this the definitive James Bond film. The film had a sense of real drive behind it accentuated by Lazenby's no-nonsense approach and the urgency of John Barry's instrumental theme used repeatedly to never let up the pace. If James Bond was ever the dedicated civil servant it was in this film. I can't even imagine Sean Connery in this film any more. The filmmakers traded in Connery's worldliness for Lazenby's energetic determination. It seems apparent that Lazenby probably looked to DR. NO for inspiration.

FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE is considered to be one of the better Bond films in the series. It follows the directorial style of DR. NO. Sean Connery in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE continued his portrayal of the character in the Fleming literary mold, but refined his performance adding more depth to the character's worldliness, intellect, social graces and wry humor. Lazenby reverts back to the James Bond we saw in DR. NO concentrating on his resoluteness and tenacity as the man with a mission who will not be deterred until the opposition is completely vanquished. Lazenby's scenes with Diana Rigg as Tracy, his bride to be, showed genuine compassion and depth. This was Bond's only true love interest up to that point in the series. Connery had showed genuine subdued sorrow tinged with anger at the death of Jill Masterson and her sister Tilly Masterson in GOLDFINGER and again with Aki in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. However, I don't see how any actor could have given a better reaction as George Lazenby did to the death of James Bond's new bride slumped over limply into his lap. Perhaps Daniel Craig could have. ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE for many reasons is the stand alone the Quintessential James Bond film.",1449619200,13,4828,4.689858490566038
7343232,5,B0126ZKKII,"This is not only one of the best 60's bond films, it is one of the best Bond Films of all time. Despite Lazenby's questionable performance, every other aspect of this film is spot on. Great plotting, great pacing, phenomenal action scenes, and amazing casting for Blofeld and the Bond Girl. The Blu-Ray transfer is exceptional, with both the picture and audio leaving me impressed. My only complaint with this edition is that it doesn't have a Digital copy, which the Moore, Brosnan, and Connery collections do.",1446336000,13,511,4.885057471264368
7343233,4,B0126ZKKII,"This apparently is not the George Lazenby Collection because there is only only 1 film. There is no digital copy. Still you get ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" in blue ray. They put the star actor on the front of the box and the title on the back of the box. Cheaper than having the title of the film on the front. To make it look like a collection?

This is a good James Bond Film. I don't think it is in the top 5 but it is in the top 10. Getting it on blue ray gives you the best quality. There is Diana Rigg (The Avengers) in this film. Get this if you want it in blue ray. If you want a digital copy you will have to get it separately.",1443830400,4,642,3.827067669172932

7343239,4,B0126ZKKII,"Good Bond movie but that great I still gave it a four star rating because for the last hour of very nice action scenes.  The first hour and twenty minutes were more plot scenes building up to the action scenes,  but the movie still keep my intrest for most of the film.  The film itself for it's time was done very well and the price couldn't be beat by amazon.  There was a 6 second glitch but rest of the movie played perfectly for me so I'm not going to worry over a few a seconds delay in the movie playing in my dvd player.  I do plan to buy each set piece by piece until I have the whole sets and then buy the newest Bond movie,  so in closing I say buy this movie if your a true Bond fan and enjoy alot of action scenes and can get threw alot of plot build up first.",1459468800,,773,3.8607594936708862
