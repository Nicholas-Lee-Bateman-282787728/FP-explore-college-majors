8080324,5,B000AY6S3O,"Little Bear is one of the sweetest most lighthearted cartoon shows I've ever watched. The show also has beautiful background music, and cute characters. It is based on the books by Else Holmelund Minarik, and Maurice Sendak.

The show is about a bear named Little Bear and his daily adventures with his friends and family. Among his friends include Duck, Cat, Hen, and Owl. He also meets other characters throughout the series. This particular DVD called ''Grandmother's House'' is a great DVD to start with because the episodes are just so sweet and fun. I love this show.",1378080000,2,573,4.846938775510204
