7892153,5,6305609357,"The work of John Hubley up until the time of his death in 1977 was that of one of the greatest creative geniuses the medium has known, he showed the true meaning of what rebelling in the face of the rigid domination of the Disney empire really means. This mans best work is as good as animation ever gets and his work has few equals, it's that good.
I went to graduate school to study with him in 1976 and had barely gotten acquainted with him when he died, among the worst catastrophes of my life. I visited with him the night before he died, not grasping the gravity of his condition.

The little time I did have with him  was truely wonderful and the conversations that we engaged in while driving him from the train station to the campus, among the few chances to be alone, were encouraging and showed me I had chosen well to travel three thousand miles and borrow a larges sum of money to attend a school I had no other interst in other than his presence. Unfortunately he was quite managed and controled by his wife Faith, who took over his reputation after he died. She was a high powered driven woman, once among the early women to work in film editing in Hollywood along with Dede Allen.

John was the creative brain and she knew how to get things to happen, and how to twist arms, I suspect largely in the business world by being a ferociously unstoppable force. It was hard to not like Faith for her drive but her intensity was domineering and and distracting. I wanted to have quiet conversations with John but her agenda was to push push push, and I found her personally exhausting. I found his death to be an overwhelming tradgedy which I had to bear alone.

His lyrical, gentle, imaginative work is what the Hubley studio stood for and you can see some of his influence in the Disney features he worked on before rebeling from the Disney machine. There are hints of his work in films he's credited for in Fantasia and Bambi as well I believe. The films made after his death by his wife seem to have emerged rubber stamp like at a furious pace and that of his daughter is an acquired taste in my opinion. Their work should in no way be confused with his as the films bear little of what make his so special. When you go to school to study animation you see a lot of student work including your own and you get to know the differece between the work of a master and that of a fumbling amateur. John was a master.

It is supremely unfortunate that his wife and daughters films have been packaged with his because they are so far out his league that it's embarrassing to feel a need to comment, but that is what you have to do to see his films. Obviously each viewer needs to make up their own mind.

Those familiar with him have their favorites. The short film that sold me on him and made me choose him as a potential mentor was Cockaboody. Also superb are Windy Day, The Tender Game and Moon Bird are among the best of the short films. Everybody Rides The Carousel is a marvelous ambitious intelligent piece that I first saw as a PBS special as soon as I arrived in the east just before meeting him at Yale.",1335916800,2,3121,4.299319727891157
7892154,1,6305609357,"John Hubley was a genius and the sole reason the words ""Hubley Studio"" have resonance today.  Unfortunately he passed away long ago, and Faith has continued to work under the ""Hubley Studio"" banner.  Her work, which lards these DVDs, is egregious.  She cannot draw, but we are to believe that's really no problem, as she claims to be influenced by ""primitive art"".  Actually, the association is an intolerable slur on primitive art.  Her animating strategy, displayed in tedious short after tedious short, seems to be ""draw a squiggle and make it wriggle"".

And I cannot believe my eyes and ears:  occasionally, this tripe is interrupted, with no rhyme or reason, by direct swipes from the classic Hubley toons.

Don't even get me started on their daughter, Emily Hubley.

John's work, of course, is some of the most awe-inspiring, utterly original, and downright funny stuff you will ever see.  The use of improvised, seemingly overheard dialogue tracks is but one of his masterstrokes.  It would have been possible to create a half-dozen DVDs of John-supervised shorts.  When I ponder why that wasn't done, my heart sinks.",1071792000,6,1124,5.0162162162162165
