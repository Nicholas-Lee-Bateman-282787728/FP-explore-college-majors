1212197,4,B00000F316,"I bought this after seeing the 2014 George Clooney film:  The Monuments Men about the WWII men that saved the art confiscated by Hitler.  Someone I know recommended, ""The Train"" with Burt Lancaster.  These are all old movies before my movie viewing time, so they are all new to me and I thoroughly liked them.  I was surprised to like, ""Manchurian Candidate"" with Frank Sinatra.  I bought this, quite frankly, because I'm cheap!  I could have rented one movie for just a little less than buying this 4 movie DVD.  To me, buying the DVD for 4 movies was a better buy.  The movies are good and I can watch them again or lend out them out.

Good deal.  Good movies.",1397347200,,662,4.396694214876033

1212203,3,B00000F316,"Ronin - Great film.  Enough said.

The Train is a good film.  A bit dated, but still entertaining.

The Young Savages expresses the ""it's society's fault"" thinking of the early sixties.  Very dated, not convincing, and could have been alot better.",1212019200,,247,4.926829268292683

1212205,5,B00000F316,4 films from legendary and I use that word with great respect..director John Frankenheimer.  The Train is perhaps one of the last truly great WWII action films in Black and White and featured a gutsy performance by Burt Lancaster. The Manchurian Candidate is a stone classic and the extra features are very well done and  add to the enjoyment.  Ronin is a good example of later work by Frankenheimer and frankly the 2 disc set you can get  on its own has tons of very informative featurettes that go missing on this set...which brings us to The Young Savages..another Frankenheimer and  Lancaster project which sadly is the reason I had to buy this set as I own the other three and this isn't currently being  offered on its own.  Shame on the studios for these tricks.  I think they should not penalize folks who actually buy their movies by bundling  up ones you can only get in sets..with ones that have been out for years...I refuse to devalue this set however it is truly worth 5 stars at the price its offered.,1201046400,26,1016,4.538461538461538

Manchurian Candidate?  Do remember seeing parts of it, so will have to watch it.  As for Ronin and the The Young Savages?  Haven't watched them yet; so may do so and edit this review.

Others may have already reviewed the other movies, but I won't say for sure.",1444435200,,435,4.156626506024097

So far, I have never been disappointed and although I just received these films (yesterday afternoon), I'm looking forward to my own little film fest.  LOVE Burt Lancaster (especially his walking towards/away view)!! And, let's face it, John Frankenheimer never made a bad movie.",1436832000,2,450,4.756410256410256

1212281,5,B00000F316,"THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is director John Frankenheimer's definitive film. The mesmerizing story of a political and psychological subterfuge is devastating. This film is distinctly a John Frankenheimer film and I believe his best. One thing that strikes time and again when I think of this film is Laurence Harvey's performance as Raymond Shaw. Could a figure be more tragic, so torn apart and put back together? Could a character be so devastated and tossed away like a lump of flesh to be used for some inhumane political ambition? I think not. And what of Frank Sinatra's performance as Major Marco? He too is a pawn in the threatening dark forces whose political point of view is one that would subjugate all for the greater good of mankind. Major Marco's heartbreak is that he has uncovered part of their scheme and he knows that Raymond Shaw too is a pawn, but to what purpose? This is one of Frank Sinatra's finest performances (he has always been underrated as an actor in my opinion) as is Laurence Harvey's (also underrated and somewhat forgotten). These two strong performances make this film or the more real, all the more horrifying. Behind it all is David Amram's score that is so prophetically apt. There is such a tragedy at work here. What happens in the name of freedom, not only for American values, but the values of the free world is solemnly told here by John Frankenheimer.

RONIN is perhaps director John Frankenheimer's last great film. During the early and mid 1960s John Frankenheimer directed some of his best and most memorable films. They include THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, THE TRAIN, SECONDS and GRAND PRIX. All those are among my favorite films. RONIN is a very good spy film that is characterized by great location cinematography, car chases, sets and great performances from a very solid cast that includes Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan Skarsgrd, Sean Bean, Michael Lonsdale, Jonathan Pryce and Katarina Witt. French cinematographer Robert Fraisse achieved a look of realism in color similar to what John Frankenheimer had envisioned similar to THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE shot in black and white. With the Production Design by Michael Z. Hanan, Art Direction by Grard Viard and Jean-Claude Lagniez supervising over 100 stunt drivers with Frankenheimer's close direction and sense of realism is achieved much like seen in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, THE TRAIN and GRAND PRIX.

Director John Frankenheimer's THE TRAIN was released in 1965. Set in the final days of Nazi occupied Paris during the WWII it tells a tale of how the French Resistance attempted to stop a train carrying a cargo of paintings from entering into Germany. The paintings had been held in a museum in Paris throughout the German occupation. These were not works by the old masters but instead were works painted by the impressionist and post impressionist artists whose paintings had been labeled degenerate by Nazi Germany. Though labeled degenerate or depraved by the Nazis these paintings had not been destroyed. At the beginning of the film we are introduced to German Colonel von Waldheim played by Paul Scofield. At first he appears to be a sympathetic character who allowed the museum curator Miss Villard to remain in charge of these paintings. She thanks him for not removing her and expresses that she detects his appreciation for the paintings after he admits to her that as a German officer he should not have been moved by degenerate art. When German soldiers come into the museum and crate all the paintings for railway shipment to Germany it is evident that the paintings have a monetary value to the Nazis if not an aesthetic one. Colonel von Waldheim uses this point to procure a military train. Miss Villard seeks out the help of the French Resistance namely Labiche, a railway yardmaster, played by Burt Lancaster to stop the train. Labiche is at first disinterested because the efforts of the Resistance should be aimed at military targets. However, Villard pleads that the paintings are part of the French culture and part of France itself and should never leave the country. Labiche gives in and the story focuses on the determination of Labiche and German Colonel von Waldheim to thwart each other's attempts from accomplishing their tasks. This is one of Burt Lancaster's greatest performances demonstrating his athletic abilities and his intuitive sense of histrionics to create a visual screen presence of pure determination to stop an equally determined foe who represents a [badness] gone beyond the limits of an already [horrible] Nazi regime. Paul Scofield's performance is the complete opposite but equally determined played with a strange and enigmatic detachment. As the movie progresses we see that von Waldheim's [character] degenerates even though he remains oblivious to his own shortcomings as a human being. The more obstacles that Labiche puts in the way of the train we see von Waldheim respond with firing squads for all those that assist Labiche. Colonel von Waldheim has stolen and transports the paintings under the pretense that they a resource to the Reich. In fact von Waldheim has convinced himself that he alone or only a man like him is capable of appreciating such paintings. Air raids, derailments, staged locomotive crashes, diversions, detours and so on hamper the train ever mile on its way to Germany. Near the end of the movie von Waldheim puts French hostages along the walkways of the locomotive to stop Labiche from blowing up the tracks and engine. ... Composer Maurice Jarre's score ends the film on a melancholy note of reflection using the dynamic melody he created for the French Resistance now played on a muted harmonica in a bittersweet comment on the futility of war. ... Director John Frankenheimer created this epic with such precision that you just can not appreciate the labors of all the technicians and actors went into making this film. John Frankenheimer is one of my favorite directors. He's way up there on the list. This film is a cinematic achievement of storytelling, action and great ... soul searching.

1961's THE YOUNG SAVAGES is visually a very stark film. I love this film's resolute perseverance for truth and its enigmatic point of view. The acting is first-rate. I saw this film when it was first released and I have never forgotten it. John Frankenheimer's films have that effect on you. It is a good one and I liked it then and I still like it now. It has stood the test of time. Burt Lancaster's performance is brilliant and very focused. I also like David Amram's score. It fits the concrete landscape beautify as did Lionel Lindon's stark black & white cinematography. THE YOUNG SAVAGES is a gripping and austere tale dealing with street gang violence set in New York City in East Harlem. When assistant district attorney Hank Bell, played by Burt Lancaster, learns that one of three gang members accused of murdering a blind member of an opposing gang is the son of an an ex-girlfriend, it gets personal and very tangled. The film is a good drama that considers themes of poverty, ethnic bias, mental capacity, psychosis, morality and many other issues that make up society. David Amram once again composed a very good score and Lionel Lindon's stark photography sets the mood brilliantly. As the tale unfolds there is much more than meets the eye.",1424736000,2,7388,4.961259079903147

Frank Sinatra is great, Angela Lansbury is total control freak, and Laurance Harvey is amazing as the brainwashed Sergeant. The Train is also a fantastic movie, and one of the better WWII movies.
